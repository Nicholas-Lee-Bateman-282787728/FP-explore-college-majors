1497523,5,B00005JMQW,"When you really get right down to it, it only makes sense that for the first true silver screen outing of everyone's favorite ""friendly neighborhood Spider-Man"", that his nemesis for the film would be his comic book arch-rival numero uno - the Green Goblin! And since Norman's Goblin died in the comics, it was no big to kill him in the movie.(For those who don't know, Harry later took on the Goblin name and costume, but later sought psychiactric help. And then his PSYCHIATRIST took on the Goblin name...and got killed. And let's not get started on the Hobgoblin...)
  So for a sequel, looking at all of ""Spidey's"" other main villainous staples, who would be the best? Sandman? Scorpion, perhaps? Or the Shocker, Chameleon, or Kraven the Hunter? Rhino, Mysterio, or the Lizard, maybe? But, when you get right down to it, there was only one with the potential to really light up the screen alongside the famous wallcrawler - Doc. Ock!(Can you tell I'm eager to see what they do with him?)
  As to the black costume that later attached to reporter-gone-rogue Eddie Brock to become Venom, that gets tricky just in figuring out how the black costume/symbiote gets to Spidey! After all, it spawned from some sort of goop in the 93-98 animated series, and in the comics he got it by accident while on the Beyonder's mash together planet near the end of the original ""Secret Wars"".  (Okay, so the film makers will probably take the cartoon's route...)
  But for now, I shall await the battle of Spider VS. Octopus. And though I give 5 stars, I actually reserve rating until I have actually seen it.  Until then, Spider-Friends......",1068508800,,1628,4.74822695035461
1497524,5,B00005JMQW,"After grossing over 800 million worldwide, Spider-Man 2 is an eagerly awaited movie. I myself cant wait for this movie to come out. But something is still on my mind...when will we see Venom!?!
He has to be one the best villians in Spider-Man period. We know for a fact that the new threat this time is Dr. Octopus (I also heard so is the Lizard, this true?), so that puts my hopes of seeing that wicked  Black symbiote costume. The red and blue costume is alright, but the black suit blows them all out the water, the black spider man is just amazing compared to the red/blue one. I am very interested in how Raimi will handle the symbiote costume when or if we ever see that storyline. Nevertheless the design for Octopus is really amazing, Spider-Man  2 (is it going to be called ""the amazing spider-man"") should be able to blowout the first one.

1497682,5,B00005JMQW,"This is still to this day the best Spider-Man movie made, it's got all the heart of the comic captured perfectly, in my opinion Tobey McGuire was born to play this part and is perfectly cast as Spider-Man/ peter Parker. It's too bad that the movie after this was terrible, this and the first one are among the best superhero movies ever made.

1497686,5,B00005JMQW,"For my $$ so far Sam Raimis second Spider-man is both his best and the superior Spider-flick to every other one before or since, including Spider-man: Homecoming. Sure Peter Parker is older and Tobey Maguire even though youthful was certainly no teenage tool but the depth of characterization they gave to Doc Ock made him such a great and even profound villain; he was never far from the likes of what Parker wanted to be. And Parker had almost got the girl but his persona and commitment to being Spider-man was making that dream slip away. I thought that they handled his losing his powers as a psychosomatic response to his stress and doubt in a well-crafted manner and having his best bud Harry find out who he really was forced Parker to embrace both sides of his own personal coin, which also helped him get the girl, but more importantly it helped him distinguish himself from the twisted villainy of Doc OckOck was willing to sacrifice everyone else to achieve his dream, Parker was willing to sacrifice everything including himself to save everyone else, scientific dreams be damned. This movie hit it on so many different levels: characterizations and meaningful character motivations (you cant simply denounce the bad guys in this film, you have to feel something, especially pity, for them); engaging and clever fight sequences (Spider-man saving aunt May as Doctor Octopus ascends the side of the building is just thrilling); good effects; romance; and slithering, hissing, metallic snake-like possessive tentacles could genuinely give one the willies (the scene with the doctors about to remove them in the hospital and they begin to protect themselves is pure Evil Dead genius horror). The best Spider-man movie and easily in the top 10, if not top 5, of the best superhero movies ever.",1512864000,,1802,4.9504950495049505

1497690,5,B00005JMQW,"Spiderman 2 reveals the desire of spiderman in battle by showing him pushing his abilities to their limitations. Also it reveals spiderman as someone that remains hated by super villains apparently as something that will never end. Also its has like all other spiderman movies the kindness of spiderman not only for Mary Jane but for his aunt may. I think if you want to experience the reality of this superhero character in a sense of what Stan Lee and Sam raimi created, spiderman 2 is what they were trying to reach. When I saw it when spiderman is battling octo at the train fight I about fell off my bed when spiderman jumps of a building gliding through the air landing on octo. Its not just up to movie makers to create a legend its also up to the beginnings of a story! I definitely recommend this one not only as entertainment but as a learning experience for everyone.",1510358400,,878,4.49375

1497761,3,B00005JMQW,"This movie takes up where the first one left off. Peter (Toby Maguire) has fallen on bad times he is a loner happy because he knows as Spiderman he can not have friends including Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst); the bad guys would use his friends as pawns. Everything is going to pot. He loses his job, cant pay his rent, his aunt is on foreclosure, he can not make schedule on anything he does. His best friend is out to get Spiderman. And heaven forbid he is falling behind in school.

Looks like it is decision time between his Spidy personality and Mary Jane Watson.
Which does he chose?
Which would you chose?
Is there a way out of the dilemma?

This film is very slow moving and depressing for at least the first third. They are relying on the reputation of the first Spiderman to carry this almost similar story. When the action picks up that is all it is just action. You may want to fast forward through this as nothing is said or reveled that will have any bearing on the end.",1504915200,2,980,4.291891891891892

The casting, direction, production design, music and editing are all spot-on. I just wish Sony and Columbia would analyze this film and try to recapture some of its greatness. The Garfield films were a trainwreck, and while HOMECOMING was a step in the right direction, it's still weak sauce compared to the perfection of Raimi's SPIDER-MAN 2.",1503187200,,498,5.0120481927710845

1497840,3,B00005JMQW,"Released in 2004 and directed by Sam Raimi, ""Spider-Man 2"" stars Tobey Maguire as the troubled hero with spider powers who struggles with relationship issues with MJ (Kirsten Dunst) and battles Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina), a brilliant scientist who has acquired four long tentacles as extra appendages. Rosemary Harris returns as Aunt May while James Franco returns as Harry Osborn.

There's this ongoing myth that ""Spider-Man 2"" is a great movie. While Doc Ock is excellently realized the movie is severely flawed by two subplots: Since when are Spider-Man's powers dependent upon Peter's confidence level? He received them via a radioactive spider bite, which has nothing to do with faith/belief. And what about the stoo-pid subplot where Spider-Man's identity is revealed to a dozen New Yorkers on the subway train with the implication that they're going to keep mum about it. Why sure!

The movie runs 127 minutes (135 minutes extended cut) and was shot in New York City, the Los Angeles area and Chicago (the train sequence).

UPDATE: This disc also includes Spiderman 2.1, which adds 8 minutes of footage not found in the original theatrical release. I watched it and found the extra minutes completely unnecessary.

1498104,4,B00005JMQW,"An entertaining Spidey sequel, with Tobey Maguire continuing to perfectly capture the character of Peter Parker on the big screen. An entertaining story, plenty of action and a larger-than-life Doc Ock really made this film work. The special effects are still sharp (although occasionally cheesy when they incorporate the CGI characters in combat.) The dialog can get a little mired in cheese sometimes, such as Peter's long and tedious confession to May about the events of Uncle Ben's death (I realize it's important to the narrative but it still did mire the film a tad.)

One neither here nor there observation is about James Franco's Harry Osborn character. He really does a fantastic job as the bitter, unresolved-revenge character (who you know is being built up for the sequel) and seeing him so filled with rage just makes me think he would have made a much better Anakin Skywalker in eps. 2-3 of the Star Wars prequels.

1498533,5,B00005JMQW,"My review is strictly about the quality of the Blu Ray, and my feelings on the whole Mastered in 4K concept.
First and foremost, this is a regular Blu Ray that will play in 1080p, and should not be considered a true 4K source. But it says mastered in 4K though, you may ask. Which it does, what that means is instead of a 1080p source being transferred onto a Blu Ray disc, the 1080p source goes through a 4K upscaling source and color corrector. However, the technology didn't exist at the time for 4K to play on disc (I will get to that towards the end) so what Sony did was come out with a Mastered in 4K line. Is it a gimmick... Maybe. Will you notice a difference... Very little unless with the right accessories.
You see, this movie went through a wider color correction called xvYCC. Which not all TVs or players support, almost all of them don't support it even though it gives a wider range of color. The most common and widely used format has always been standard sRGB, however it discarded a lot of color. Sony TVs and players support this color format, I want to assume the new OLED, and SUHD would as well since these TVs support HDR (High Dynamic Range) which far surpasses xvYCC. But still need the player to support that color, which Sony's Blu Ray player and possibly the PS3 and PS4... Possibly those. I don't know of any other Blu Ray player that does because it's such an unused color format.
Without those, you won't get the true picture that the disc wants to give, but it's still the best 1080p picture you can get on any Blu Ray disc.
After which it goes though Sony's 4K detailing, then gets downloaded on to a single Blu Ray disc. You'll notice that there isn't any special features, commentary, trailers... Nothing. Because the entire disc space was used to download a more detailed, colorful, high definition movie.
Now, is this movie worth buying? Yes and no, if you don't already own the movie and you want to then this is the better option to have. If you already own it, I wouldn't buy this again. While this is the better version of the movie, it's only so much better that you may or may not notice much of a difference.
If you're going from DVD to Blu Ray, then yes this would be a better one to get.

Now, when I said the technology wasn't available at the time... It's because the Blu Ray association was currently working on a disc formate that could handle 4K, 3D 4K, and HDR. Because there wasn't enough space on the Blu Rays we have now. They finally announced a few months ago that they finished finalizing the format that would support 4K. I don't know if we will see another battle between two disc formats like HD DVD and Blu Ray, but I'm confident they will stick to a single format.
Panasonic at the beginning of this year showed us at CES that they had a prototype 4K UHD player, but was only a prototype. However, Samsung introduced their 4K UHD Blu Ray player that will come out in February next year. While they haven't listed a price, they did say it will play DVDs, Blu Rays, 3D movies as well as 4K and have a fantastic upscaling ability because it will also be upscaling with the HDR color coding. The only TVs now that will give you a wider range of HDR color is the flat LG OLED, and Samsungs SUHD TVs. TVs that support HDR, will be Samsungs JU7100-7500, Samungs HU8550 and up (with purchase and upgrade from the evolution kit), and select Sony 4K TVs.
With this being known, I suspect a lot of Sony 4K movies being released on that format. So if you have the money, and you are an early adopter to new technology, I would wait a little while longer before you buy any Mastered in 4K movie. If you aren't, and have no intention of buying a new player, then this is as close as you are going to get to a 4K movie on a disc.",1450742400,9,3779,4.307584269662922

1498605,5,B00005JMQW,"The second film could be a runner-up for my favorite comicbook movie. The first one was campy, but this film I'd argue is legitimately good. It is goofy, but remember that it's a COMICBOOK movie, so it can pass. It's an entertaining flick from beginning to end and has a lot of heart. I much prefer the extended cut(Spider-Man 2.1) since it extends the already brilliant action scenes and gives some more moments to the supporting characters. It may be over ten-years-old, but it's still the best Spider-Man movie. It's probably in my Top 10 All Time Favorite Films, it just leaves you with such a satisfying feel at the end, which kind of makes Spider-Man 3 all the more disappointing...

This Blu-ray is just about perfect. The video and audio are both reference material and it comes with a lot of special features that have some great audio commentaries, plus both versions of the movie. I highly recommend this Blu-ray.",1444262400,,924,4.739130434782608

well this time around the studio has done the smarter thing
for the 2012 reissue of Spider-man 2
columbia has added all the special features from the 2 Disc dvd set
and i mean all of them
MAKING THE AMAZING which is a 2hour long Documentary on the making of spider-man 2, incredible Doco aswell
plus many other featurettes, Deleted scenes, bloopers, and lots more
plus the extended 136mins version is added aswell you can select this when you click play movie
Play movie gives you the option to player the 127min or the 136mins up to you
all this on 1 Blu-ray Disc
so if you want all the special features plus the 2 versions of the film which look beautiful in High Definition
both film versions have been given the exact same HD transfer in 2:40:1 ratio the quality looks amazing very nice & clear picture quality
much better than the old dvd version, plus the sound has been boosted up to 5.1 master mix

If you have an LG tv you can ignore the warning - the picture was absolutely stunning.  Sadly I think the last movie mastered in 4K was the re-release of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" about 3 years ago.

1498685,5,B00005JMQW,"""Spider-Man 2.1"" is, for all practical purposes, the director's cut for Spider-man 2.

This movie is identical to Spider-Man 2, except for 8 added minutes of content, and possibly some rearrangement of other minutes (though I don't remember any of that happening). Knowing other ""director's cuts"" that I have watched (zealously at times), there may have been some content in the earlier movie that was not in the second. For this reason, I generally purchase every version of a movie, usually two if there is a director's cut, or in the case of Christopher Reeve's Superman, three versions (theatrical, two-night television event (Lester's Cut), and Donner's Director's Cut (2006).

I highly recommend that you purchase both Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 2.1 (and of course, the other movies that ""Spider-Man"" swung his web for.

1498817,5,B00005JMQW,"My 2 year old has been fascinated with the Toby Maguire Spider Man films. She probably spends most of her time watching the first one, but she finds this equally captivating.

Really, this is one of the better super hero films out there. Spider Man is an interesting character because he is usually portrayed as a high school teen or a college age kid. What this means is that he doesn't have all the answers, so it's typical for Spidey to do something stupid like think he should deny himself time with the woman he truly loves.

In Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man's denial of his love for Mary-Jane Watson manifests in a loss of powers. The first time I watched this film, I thought that plot device was just a gimmick, but after watching this film more than 100 times (because my 2 year old keeps calling for it), the power loss makes sense. Before Dr. Octavius goes bad, he has a line about how ""you can't keep something as complicated as love bottled up inside"" and that's clearly what Spidey's power loss is meant to represent.

Rosemary Harris has the sequence of dialogue that the screenwriter was probably most happy with, and she does a good job delivering it as Aunt May. She has kind of a Morgan Freeman moment with her ""I think there's a hero in all of us"" speech, and the scene where she is rescued by Spidey is effective.

The best part of this film is the revelation of Spidey's identity to Mary-Jane. This is the culmination of two films of heart-ache in the romance between Peter and Mary, and the release that is felt when Mary-Jane realizes the truth is palpable. Actually, that's one of the better screen moments that I can remember. Poor, foolish, noble Spidey has been trying to protect Mary-Jane...but it's true that something as powerful as love can destroy you if you try to bottle it up.

The various action sequences are very good. Rami's camera mimics the acceleration and deceleration of a man swinging on a wire, which is probably the only way to shoot spider-man. This one is superior to the first in all aspects except for the lack of Williem Dafoe (he appears in one scene). A must-watch for all superhero fans.",1431993600,,2138,4.557291666666667

Peter Parker transitions from awkward teen to young adult and finds that his role of Spiderman is consuming him, and causing his grades to slip, causing him to lose jobs, and inalienating him from his friends. His love interest, Mary Jane Watson, announces she is getitng married to the son of none other than J Jonah Jameson, who hate Spiderman. It's a bitter pill to swallow. Peter meets Dr. Otto Octavius, a brilliant fusion fusion engineer whose experiments wind up killing his wife and driving him insane. He becomes obsessed with his experiments and creates a mechanical set of six arms that take his unstable mind over, becoming the villain ""Doc Oc."" There are some incredible scenes here, one comes to mind in the restaraunt where a car is thrown through the window. Spider man has to deal with Doc Oc, while trying to put his personal life back together.

This has amazing action scenes, great character development, and such a villain as to make Spiderman reach within himself to find the hero within. When he questiosn why he even does all this, without telling his Aunt May he is Spiderman, of course. She answers concerning Spiderman and the child next door who admires Spiderman and needs a hero; """"I believe there is a hero in all of us. That keeps us honest. Gives us strength. Makes us noble.""

1499088,5,B00005JMQW,"At the time of its release Spiderman 2 was hailed as the greatest superhero movie ever created. And just to satisfy the doubts of anyone whos never had the privilege of seeing it, this movie hasn't aged a bit. First and foremost, it is a sequel film but Spiderman 2 doesnt consider itself any more important that its predecessor. Sam Raimi, who returned to his series with just as much passion as before, treats it like a continuation of the same story hes working on but didn't hesitate to improve his directing abilities.

Strangely enough, for being one of the best films of all time, its also one of the most personal and character driven superhero movies ever created (and thats saying a lot, considering the way superhero movies are). Some lessons deserve repeating; like that Sam Raimi likes to portray Spiderman as the troubled adolescent like he was the comic book. Where the first movie introduced us to this wonderful and complex hero, its sequel picks up where the first one ended and continues flawlessly onto the next phase of Peter Parkers journey.

While our hero is trying to do his civic duty by fighting crime, we quickly discover that trying to be Spiderman is costing Peter Parker a lot of the things he both wants and needs in order to get by. This is an unusual direction for a superhero movie, which usually don't emphasize the way that being a hero is so taxing. In fact, Spiderman 2 has a very long setup time that calls a lot to our attention before were even introduced to a villain.

But what a villain he is... Otto Octavius is a brilliant scientist, straight from the comic books who dreams of using his intelligence to benefit humanity. With a revolutionary idea to change society for the better, he attaches four robotic arms to his body right before his experiment malfunctions and does damage to him and his robot arms; being transformed into the iconic Doctor Octopus. But unlike the comic books, Doctor Octopus is decidedly sympathetic as hes discouraged that his experiment was a failure. But after his robotic arms are revealed to have an artificial intelligence too strong to control they start manipulating Doctor Octopus and we see his very believable decent into villainy; to prove to the world he is still brilliant.

Peter Parkers development as a character is even more tragic as he discovers the girl he always loved, Mary Jane Watson, cant stand to be with him any longer because she doesnt know hes Spiderman. Peter even has the brutal honesty of admitting to himself that they could never be together if he has enemies. To make it even stranger, after Mary Jane gets engaged to another man Peter Parker discovers that his spider powers are starting to fail him and is faced with the decision to abandon his life as a superhero.

Though not necessarily a flaw, its never really mentioned how or why Spidermans powers start failing him. After watching the movie for the first time in years I almost thought this subplot added nothing to the conflict. That was before I realized this movie is about an internal conflict that every superhero probably faces some time or other. And when it comes time for Spiderman to confront Doctor Octopus he shows how their struggles are the same because of the things hes gone through in this movie.

Like I said, this is an unusually dramatic superhero movie, but it has all the other ingredients we expect. The action scenes have been improved upon tenfold. Sam Raimi continues to deliver with his stylized vision for the Spiderman franchise, but having Doctor Octopus for a villain really presents some amazing inspiration. He can walk on walls, lift tremendously heavy objects and his four mechanical arms must have been great fun to animate.

Not to mention, Spiderman 2 is known for one of the greatest superhero fight scenes ever filmed. The train battle scene is legendary, since its nothing but nonstop action from the first second and no interruption to explain stuff or spout witty catchphrases. The action flows flawlessly from one perfectly filmed shot to the next, some of them only split seconds long, and each frame crowded with movement from Spidermans swiftness and Octopuss brutality. And then it ends the way all superhero fights should. Spiderman has to save people and I cant help but watch in silent horror as hes pushed to the very limit a hero can endure before the outcome is decided. But Ive heard this fight scene is even more incredible because its deleted footage would make it even more epic if it were left in. Does one fight scene really warrant a whole paragraph to itself? This one does.

I gotta admit, for one of the best and still one of the most enduring superhero movies ever made, it is a very unconventional kind of plot that still manages to win my love and appreciation, because Spiderman 2 is rightly the best of Sam Raimis three movies. Its not just him either, because every actor who returned to continue on as the characters they were in the first movie really showed their appreciation for Spidermans story by giving it their all. And all the people behind the scenes really gave it their best to make this ambitious project possible. I believe this is one of the few superhero movies that will always be considered a masterpiece for all generations.",1421712000,,5283,4.741022850924918

1499163,2,B00005JMQW,"This is really for the whole series but none of them are very good. It's funny to me how people specifically pick out the 3rd film as being terrible. Yes, it has the infamous dance scene, yes they ruined venom, and yes it took one of the best stories of Spiderman and played it for laughs. It's perfectly understandable that people would be hostile towards it but let's look at the whole series. Did we really take these movies seriously to begin with? I don't think so.

When I look back at these movies, they haven't aged well. I especially think of all the campy stuff. It really tells me that Sam Raimi was not the right fit for this project. The bad dialogue, the goofy extras, the poor cgi effects. Who didn't laugh their balls off at the green goblin in Spiderman 1? Who didn't cringe every time Mary Jane needed to be saved, again and again? Of course they're comic book movies but it didn't need more silliness nor to take itself too serious. Top that off with some poor writing and cramming and it's a wonder why the movies are so critically acclaimed. They're just dumb fun movies and that's it, but for me I stick to the cartoons and comics. I doubt they'll ever pull off a really good Spiderman flick. It just doesn't translate as well to the big screen or at least it hasn't thus far.",1420761600,,1298,4.363636363636363

Ok they just get better and better. I was actually disappointed they stopped at 3 as they introduced other characters into the movie that later become villains.

This one is Doc Oc and Harry Osborne, only he doesnt know the person he hates most in the world is his best friend.

As always Mary Jane is in the way and always in danger. You would think she and Aunt Mae would put two and two together and figure out that trouble is always around when Peter is around and Spider-Man always shows up as Peter disappears. It is the same Super-Man conundrum.

I would recommend this movie and I feel it is good for the younger set my son has been watching it since he was 5 years old. Spider-Man was his one time all time favorite super hero.

1499591,5,B00005JMQW,"This is absolutely fantastic. This isn't just a sequel that was just as good as the first, it whooped the first movie so hard and it set the bar extremely high for future superhero movies and movies in general to come. Toby Maguire, Alfred Molina, James Franco, Kirsten Dunst, Rosmary Harris and extras play their roles wonderfully. The characters have matured and you'll care for these characters. The story is much deeper and the stakes are higher than they wee in the first film.

2 years after the first movie, Peter is suffering to balance his normal life and his crime fighting life. He's low on pay, he doesn't make time for Harry or Mary Jane, Peter is doing poorly in school, he doesn't want to feel this pain anymore. He meets Doc Ock, a scientist invested in his work, but when his experiment goes bad and kills his wife, he avenges her and swears to take down Spider-Man and all of New York by rebuilding his work, but bigger and stronger than ever. Now, Peter has to stand up and do what's right.

The action in this movie is just perfect. Not too boring and not too intense. The CGI looks really amazing for 2004 and it hasn't aged yet. I love the fight on the clock tower and on top of the train. Although I did enjoy Danny Elfman's work in the first Spider-Man, he brings his A game to the sequel and it's fantastic. The music is calm, ambient, sad, and frantic when it appropriately needs to be. This is personally my favorite film score. It's just a shame that Elfman had an uncomfortable time composing for the movie.

Quoting from the film critic Roger Ebert who didn't enjoy the first Sam Raimi Spider-Man that much, he said that Spider-Man 2 ""May be the best superhero movie I have ever seen."" If you have not seen Spider-Man 2, go and watch this. You are doing a massive disservice to yourself by missing out on a compelling story and spectacular fight sequences. 10 years later and I still love this movie so much. This is a special movie, one of my top 10 favorite movies ever. This will go down in the film history books.",1405814400,,2047,4.424403183023872

1499595,5,B00005JMQW,"This past week was the 10th Anniversary of one of the best and greatest Spider-Man movies ever, so in favor of that I decided to get a grab on the 2.1 cut (previously released before Spider-Man 3 happened) which includes scenes that was removed from the final cut - that we all know - due to time restraints. I have to take back everything I said blantantly about Spider-Man 2 for the last 8 years, it's still one of the BEST Spider-Man movies ever and one of the GREATEST comic book movies period.

Looking back at this movie has alot more nostalgia than Spider-Man and Spider-Man 3 does. Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus, Peter's storyline in this, and the train sequence are the top 3 highlights that made this an excellent film. (Spider-Man 3 has nothing on this and can never top it), The only con I have to point out is the hokey amount of celebrity cameos and extras - Donnell Rawlings (Chappelle's Show) as the Pizza Witness, Emily Deschanel (Bones) as some recept., Hal Sparks in the elevator scene with Spider-Man, Daniel Dae Kim as a scientist during Octavius' demostration, Phil LaMaar (MadTV fame) in the train scene, and more famous (and some unsung) actors to name a few that have made cameos to overstuff the film to make this look like a downright comedy. Actually, come to think of it, other than the film's primary focus on its uber-serious moments, Spider-Man 2 DID feel like a comedy thanks to all of those actors that made appearances cameo after cameo after cameo after cameo.

I bought the 2.1 Director's Cut DVD on the film's 10th Anniversary day (June 30) since the original DVD got damaged. I love the new features that wasn't released on the original. The Spider-Man 3-related extras, are a pass. Let's face it: Spider-Man 3 sucks. All of the above with the director's cut is that you get to see what scenes that were removed from the film earlier here like -

*Extended versions of the Train sequence, Pizza delivery scene, Peter's visit to the nurse, Peter's vision of seeing Uncle Ben.
*And rare scenes like J. Jonah Jameson wearing Spidey's suit in his office and Peter at Dr. Connors' class the first time.",1404604800,6,2138,4.635883905013193

1499676,4,B00005JMQW,"Spiderman 2 is, without a doubt, the best Spiderman film that has come out so far.  That is not to say that the movie does not have its problems because it does.  However, despite its issues, this is the Spiderman film that, has the best effects, has the best action, has the most heart, and most importantly stays true to the spirit of the character the most.

The story is as follows.  Peter Parker (Tobey McGuire) has now been Spiderman for years now.  He is trying to balance his job as Spiderman and his normal life and is not doing very well.  The city hates Spiderman despite all the good he does.  He cannot hold a steady job, his grades are slipping, and he finds it difficult being there for his friends Harry Osborne (James Franco) and especially Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst).  Meanwhile a scientist named Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) is trying to master this process called nuclear fusion in order to produce infinite and free energy for everyone.  However, his experiment fails which nearly destroys New York and he loses everything.  He then becomes the villain Doc Oc and attempts to try the experiment again.

This film almost embodies Spiderman almost perfectly.  This is definitely Tobey McGuires best performance as Peter Parker/Spiderman.  I cannot say it is his best performance period because I haven't seen all of his films, but it is definitely his best performance as this character.  This film really captures Spiderman and people love him even now.  Everyone hates Spiderman and regard him as a criminal despite all the good he does, him trying to balance his life as Spiderman and his personal life, and no matter what he does things just never seem to go his way.  Thats Spiderman and thats what made him so relatable in the comics and why so many people gravitated towards him even to this day.

They also handle Harry and his ark perfectly.  In this film he is still trying to get revenge on Spiderman for killing his father in the last film.  This has become an obsession it virtually consumes his life where he does nothing else.  At the end of the film you see where that ultimately leads him.

Rosemary Harries gives an amazing performance as Aunt May like in the last, except she is even better here.  The scenes where Peter is talking to her about Uncle Bens death and when she gives her speech about heroes they are amazing and the best scenes in the movie.  I do not care what anybody says, Rosemary Harris is Aunt May not the one from Amazing Spiderman.

Doc Oc, I think, they actually improved upon from the comics.  In the comics he is just a stereotypical mad scientist with four robotic arms.  In the film they make him for of a three-dimensional character.  He has a noble goal, to create renewable energy for all.  After his experiment fail he loses everything; his reputation, his wife, and his dream.  You can see why he goes off the deep end and tries the experiment again.  He has nothing left but his dream.  You can feel sympathy for him and see where he is coming from which are almost always the best villains.

The action is also top notch in this.  This film has the best action scenes of all the Spiderman films.  Spiderman 3 had some great action as well but this, in my opinion, still takes the cake.  The fight between Spiderman and Doc Oc on the clock tower and the train are phenomenal.  It is the best fight in the entire franchise.  The effects are amazing and really help make the action amazing.  Some of the effects in the original were a bit off which hurt the action a little.  The effects in Spiderman 2 beat the crap out of almost all the other films including the new ones, which is sad.  Spiderman 3 had slightly better effects but is still quite close.

The film, however, is not without its faults.  The film, while coming close, does not capture Spiderman perfectly.  Spiderman still does not use his wit enough.  He does use it but not often enough.  Mary Jane is still a very poorly written character.  I still think Kirsten Dunst, while a good actress, is miscast.  This Mary Jane is still not like the Mary Jane from the comics, is still annoying, and is still just there to be Peters token love interest and the person he saves.  She also comes off as a bit selfish in this film as well.  It is not as bad as the third film but is still annoying.

There is also the plot point of her and Jamesons son.  That goes nowhere.  I am not too familiar with the Spiderman comics but I think he had a bigger role there.  Here he is simply a throw-away character.  Weak!

The plot-point of Spiderman losing his powers, while not, seems a little weird to me.  Not-to-mention it is ripped-off wholeheartedly from another film.  I swear Sam Raimi ripped off Hayao Miyazaki.  The same plot point was used in the 1989 Miyazaki animated film Kikis Delivery Service which is an awesome movie by the way.  You have a young witch named Kiki coming to town to start her witch training.  She is trying to find her place but she has a hard time fitting in.  Eventually that outsider feeling gets the best of her and she loses her witch powers.  Sound familiar!  It does not bother me too much since I saw Spiderman 2 before Kiki, but I still find that quite amusing.  I wonder if it was because of Kirsten Dunst.  Dunst who plays Mary Jane in these movies also voiced Kiki in the dub of Kikis Delivery Service which is her best performance in my opinion.  Did she have some creative input she was not credited for?

Overall, Spiderman 2 is the best Spiderman film easily.  If you are a fan of Spiderman then definitely see this film.  It has great action, great effects, great story, and it comes closest to the characters in the comics than any of the other films.  You really do not even need to watch the first movie before this.  I would recommend you do, but it is not required to understand this.  This film is pretty self-contained.",1404086400,,5896,4.4901036757775685

We've all seen superhero film sequels that fell flat or outright bombed (i.e. Batman and Robin, Superman IV.)  This film did no such thing.  It continued an interesting story, introducing new characters and plots while building on what the first film had left us with.  It also gave me my favorite Spider-Man villain ever:  Dr. Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus, played by Alfred Molina, whose performance can be called nothing short of ""humanizing"" for this character.  Seriously, this incarnation of Dr. Otto Octavius is Spider-Man's equivalent of Mr. Freeze, but with a bit more humor, and that makes him so great to watch over and over again.  It was also nice that this film didn't go the way of other superhero sequels by trying to cram more villains into its plot.  Sure, Harry Osborn was rather evil, but he's been around in the previous film, so his story ark was merely continuing rather than just beginning.  This film also did something I can't recall any other superhero film doing...it showed us Peter Parker's struggles with keeping up with his double life.  Sure, there have been films, including this movie's predecessor, that showed such problems to a certain extent, but here, we truely can see and identify with his trials and sacrifices, and that only adds to his character and the plot.  We surely have Toby McGuire's acting to thank for that as well as the great writing.  I never really got the part about him just losing his powers and then getting them back, but otherwise, I loved this film.  Mary Jane Watson was unfortunetly just as bland as in the previous film, taking the role of the female lead in superhero films back to the days before Margot Kidder played Lois Lane in the first Superman film.  Nevertheless, I feel quite comfortable labeling Spider-Man 2 as my favorite in this series...I'd give it six stars if I could.  Enjoy.",1401408000,,2063,4.785310734463277

1499814,5,B00005JMQW,"Even though this is a superior film to the first, I like the first one better. That's not to say that this could quite possibly be the greatest super hero movie of all time! It's got everything a great super hero film needs, great story, acting, pacing, action,hero, villain, love interest and a touch of comedy. Spider Man 2 also develops the character and answers all the questions the first film didn't fully flesh out. I thought Alfred Molina (a guy I had never heard of at the time) was absolutely fantastic as ""Doc Ock"" . The FX look better and the fight scenes are more appropriate for our web slinging hero with high flying air battles, Spidey shooting web balls and a villain who looks much more like his comic book counter part.

Besides having great action sequences Spider Man 2 also has a lot of heart and the love relationship and guilt issues keep this film from becoming just another super hero movie. The blend of drama and action would not be complete without a pinch of comedy which this film hits on every cylinder. Whether it's Spidey delivering pizza, taking an elevator ride or the hilarious use of the song 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' this film has some wonderful funny moments.

The Blu Ray is an improvement regarding visuals and sound, but doesn't carry over the wealth of bonus material from the 2 disc DVD
edition, so you may want to hold on to it.

1499884,5,B00005JMQW,"This is what a good summer movie should be.

Spider-Man 2 transcends the boundaries of being just another comic book movie to being a richly character driven movie with a very conflicted hero. Here, for the first time, we see the actual emotion behind the facade of the hero behind the mask. Gone is the richly colorful look of the first part, here in Spider-Man 2, we are plunged into a world of shadows and off colors.

Picking up two years after the first Spider-Man left off, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has his hands full with three full-time jobs. He is going to school full time, he is working full time to pay off his rent, and he is a hero always on call whenever he hears a siren. Not to mention, we see the emotional toll that has been taken on him, his only surviving family member, his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), has become consumed with grief and loss over the death of her husband (incidentally, creating Spider-Man in the first part), Peter's friend Norman Osborne (James Franco) is now at odds with him since he has become consumed with revenge over Spider-Man killing his father (the Green Goblin), and his love affair with Mary Jane-Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is slowly being extinguished because he is never there for her to return the feelings she has for him. And this is all in the first fifteen minutes of the film.

As Spider-Man, Parker is even in danger of losing his powers as his exhaustion slowly begins to take over. Is it medical or is it because he has stretched himself too thin? Eventually, Peter decides to give up being Spider-Man to finally bring peace into his life. There is a brilliant sequence in this film when we see Parker returning to his alter-ego from the first part before the mutated spider bite as he puts on his glasses again, clouding his vision to the world around him. When he sees someone being beaten up in an alley, he turns around to walk away. When the familiar sirens fly past him again, he just eats a hot dog. In short, Parker has finally succumbed to being a New Yorker.

In the midst of all of this, we see the creation of a new villain, this time in the form of a deranged scientist named Doctor Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), who has four frighteningly powerful arms welded to his spine after a disaster with his life's work. This disaster not only turns the Doctor into Dr. Octopus (Doc Ock as the papers call him), but the artificially intelligent arms seemed fuse to his id, placating his desires to not want his life's work to be a failure. Doc Ock will try again at the expense of anyone around him.

The standout here is Tobey Maguire, who can convey the film's entire heart with a look or a gesture, but is most heart-wrenchingly done in his hesitations. For a man so used to having quick reflexes, when he has to slow down and realize what is going on around him, we are instantly in his head. Maguire also has to command the screen as Spider-Man and convince the audience that he can stand up to someone like Octavius and not seem fantastic.

Sam Raimi also does a knock-out job as well, knowing when to hold on a character's face long enough or swinging the camera along with Spider-Man to give the audience the exhilaration of flight. Raimi is more than competent enough to give this movie the look and feel of a moving comic book and by utilizing his most signature camera shot (zooming into and out of the character's eyes), the audience is invited to live for a moment in the tights of a superhero.

Spider-Man 2 has so many great messages to be heard in this film, the best of which seems to draw both Peter and Octavius together in the end: In order for the right thing to be done, does it mean that we have to put away what we want the most? In both cases, there are some strong arguments and that is what makes this movie such a surprise is the depth that it possesses. Seemingly, we have entered the bizarro world of sequels, where they seem to surpass the original (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Toy Story 2, etc) and Spider-Man 2 definitely joins these ranks. Perhaps in allowing a series to expand rather than compliment the original, we can expect more depth out of movies, which has been as equally absent in this day and age as heroes as Spider-Man 2 also suggests.

1499994,5,B00005JMQW,"Superior sequel that deals with its themes effectively while striking the right balance between action and dramatic scenes - both complementing each other rather than drowning each other out. A Heidigger for beginners in its central character's awareness of his need for dasein for his crime fighting to be effective, it is markedly more parodic than its predecessor and so that much more enjoyable.

Moreover, a more sensitive adaptation of the Spider-Man comic and less violent - as if the filmmakers gained confidence in an imperfect superhero; the first film being a rehearsal for the quality here. This combination of realism and fantasy is compelling.

The usual post-9/11 politics of claiming that formerly-alienated New Yorkers now stick together against unspeakable evil - be it terrorism or whatever - is risible, but dramatically effective.

A subtle analysis of the myth of the super hero from the point of view of a super coward. A personal hinterland requires a life divorced from punishing the bad guys but also entails hostages to fortune - those one loves. Peter Parker's alias is scared to take this gamble, yet becomes less effective as your ""friendly neighborhood Spider Man"". It is in the risk-taking that one becomes truly effective - as our hero learns while spending much time trying to run away from the very great privilege of his not inconsiderable abilities.

The performance of J K SIMMONS as J Jonah Jameson is a comic standout in a film replete with running gags and in-jokes for the fans.

The only real (minor) problem with this movie is its unrealistic violence: Those knocks that would badly bruise the likes of you and me hardly phase these characters.

It's the best of all 3 of the trilogy as it goes deeper into Peter Parker than Spider-man, which is something that made Marvel Comics the greatest comic company ever (in my own personal opinion) This is the 2.1 version, so it includes more content in the movie. The greatest problem I have with this ia the fact that the movie doesn't fill the whole screen for some reason. But don't worry, I'm not the kinds guy to rate a movie or book by the quality, I prefer to judge the content. The actors do a fantastic job. Tobey Maguire knows how to play hero. Better than that, he knows how to play a Peter Parker. You can really believe that he's going through the things that're happening in this movie. Kristen Dunst plays Mary Jane like Drake Bell plays Drake Parker from Drake & Josh. She plays it with passion and with expression. Alfred Molina is very menacing in his role as Doc Ock. All together this has got to be in the top 2 superhero movies I've seen (the other contender is The Avengers, but I think this might beat it) Absolutely a must buy for any Spidey fan out there.

1500268,4,B00005JMQW,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just a drive-thru review of this already legendary superhero movie...

Spider-Man 2 (2004) pretty much lives up to its praise since its release.  Tobey Maguire turns in a solid performance in the leading role.  Kirsten Dunst also does pretty well.  The movie seems to have a little bit of everything - action, romance, suspense, etc.  Not to mention tons and I mean TONS of CGI.  I must say that a lot of the action sequences are a little unbelievable, even for a guy who spins webs and swings all over the place.  A movie like this really can only be made by using CGI technology.  For the many people out there who want CGI to look totally real and believable, this movie falls short somewhat.  It looks cartoonish in a lot of sequences.  Personally, it doesn't matter too much to me if CGI looks fake or real because I'm not a big fan of CGI to begin with.  I just get a kick out of the movies that come out that look like video games and it makes me think that the makers of the movie should have waited for technology to improve before they made their movies so they'll look more realistic for the always-demanding audience.  For all the nit-pickers out there who want everything looking crystal clear, in high definition, and with believable ""graphics"", then this movie does fall short.  Maybe the Spider-Man movies came out too soon.  Maybe they should have been made in the last couple of years instead of 2002, 2004, etc. since CGI technology has improved since then.  I hear the new Spider-Man movie called ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" looks more realistic than these Tobey Maguire movies.

Anyway, I recommend seeing Spider-Man 2.",1355875200,,1695,4.634228187919463

1500271,5,B00005JMQW,"Spider-Man 2(2004) is a good sequel and a good superhero movie. It's the first Spiderman movie filmed in 70mm widescreen format. The first Spiderman movie was an origin story while this film is more of a coming of age story. There's deja vu moments such as Peter Parker going into a burning building to rescue someone. For some reason, Spider-Man 2 has high levels of ""brightness""! We also get to hear B.J. Thomas' catchy song Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head. Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) struggles to be with Mary Jane, go to school, work at a job, and fight crime as Spider-Man. Spiderman also has to stop Doc Ock from destroying New York City. Spider-Man 2 is blessed with slick, first rate visual effects. It also starts on a fun note with Peter Parker trying to deliver pizzas with a 29 minute time limit. Alfred Molina(Raiders of the Lost Ark, Species) plays a more human version of Doctor Octopus/Doc Ock. There's an alternate version of the film known as Spiderman 2.1. It deletes the Hal Sparks cameo and has more footage of Mary Jane. The scene where Doc Ock kills the doctors and nurses echoes Sam Raimi's Evil Dead movies. The music by Danny Elfman is good. From what I've heard, there's alternate music cues in the film by different music composers. Spiderman and Doc Ock's fight on a subway train is awesome. The fight scene was staged by Hong Kong filmmaker Dion Lam. The credits from Spiderman 2 show us a recap from the first film through comic book artwork. I hope the 1970's Spiderman TV show gets released on DVD and Blu Ray. There's also the Japanese Spiderman TV show where he had a Power Rangers style robot. Spider-Man 2 is a good film that delivers style and substance.",1354665600,,1695,4.634551495016611

1500363,2,B00005JMQW,"I have bought all three Spiderman movies and, at the time, felt as if I had to be complaisant with them, due to the lack of other Spiderman films. The fact of the matter is, I will gladly pawn those for three dollars at my local pawn, to put in my gas tank, now that I own The Amazing Spider Man. The first three with Toby McWhere is he now, lost their Spidey roots, as to where The Amazing Spiderman gave them the much needed, CPR they needed after being ""killed"" by the first three films. Point is, The Amazing Spiderman Blue-Ray, has the following: Better script, better acting, better depiction of The Webbed Avenger, and better graphics. Let's not forget that the comic book hero we loved to read about as kids, was campy, SMART, and out to avenge the death of his uncle, by kicking evil doers asses. Oh and Stan Lee should've smacked the comic to film adapters in the face, for having his webs come directly out of his wrists. I do believe I recall them coming out of his homemade wristdevices. Oh and Mr. Magwire failed to make us believe that Peter Parker ever had a bigger form of intelligence, than snapping half-turded pix for the bugle. This review only got two stars based off the fact of having a great brilliant villain Doc Oc, which is more than I can say for SM3. Then when our dreams had been crushed by all three first films, from the ashes caused, by the destruction of the franchise firsts, an unlikely hero from high school arose. THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN(2012) Bottom line spend the extra few bucks on Amazon.com and buy the combo blue-ray of The Amazing Spiderman before wasting time and money on any of the Toby MacGuire series.

Tobey Maguire returns as Peter Parker, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane, James Franco as Harry Osbourne. This movie feature Doctor Octavious, now the weak point of this movie is the motivation for Doc Oc being Doc Oc. My other problem is that magically peter doesn't want to be Spider-Man, because he keeps missing out on dates with Mary Jane. And because of that, he starts to lose his powers if you will. Until the end, when Mary Jane gets kidnapped by Doc Oc. And Spider-Man comes roaring back, with a fight on the subway with Doc Oc. Who is really working for Harry, who has gone crazy. Blaming Spider-Man for the death of his father, which Harry in the comics actually did blame Peter. And lead to Harry being the Hobgoblin, of course that doesn't happen in this movie. Although Harry does find out that Peter is Spider-Man, In the end Peter rescues Mary Jane, without his mask on. And he convinces Doc Oc, to destroy the machine he was trying to build.

1500469,4,B00005JMQW,"Spiderman 2 builds on the foundation of the previous movie and I can honestly say it worked quite well for me. The character of Peter Parker continues to grow and become a man while his friends begin to wonder about him.

The story follows Peter as he and several others watch as Dr. Octavious exhibits a fusion device. Something goes wrong, and the mechanical arms Octavious was using to manipulate the fusion energy somehow become welded to his vertebrate; in addition to this the neural inhibitor at the apex of his spine is fused, thus making the fair-minded Octavious a crazed sciientist. With the loss of his wife, Octavious cares for noting but his ""science project."" Nothing will stand in his way of achieving his goals.

Before and after the first engagements with Doc Ock, Peter loses his confidence and subsequently quits being Spiderman. The loss of his confidence has him wanting to be a normal person again (Similar To What We Saw In Superman II). But when he sees that the people of New York miss him and that Doc Ock must be stopped, he dons his costume (Stealing It Back From Jameson) and engages Doc Ock in two climactic battles. The first he loses, and he's delivered into the clutches of his former friend Harry Osborn. Osborn is stricken upon learning that Spiderman is in fact. Peter Parker. Parker convinces his friend to put aside the animosity and allow him to save the city from doom.

The final climactic battle has Peter save Mary Jane, defeat Octavious and convince him to return to the man he once was. Octavious sacrifices himself in order to save New York City. Mary Jane discovers that peter is Spiderman and changes her opinions about him. In the end of the movie she leaves her husband at the altar, running to join with Peter Parker, knowing she will never have him all to herself. Despite this, she knows it's her decision to make, not his.

Harry has his epiphany and there is a foreshadowing as to what he will do and become in the next movie. Spiderman 2 was good. I liked the supervillain they had. Molina's portrayal of Doc Ock was right on the money. I enjoyed him in the role and part of me wishes he had lived in the end, but that was not to be.

Buy this DVD and you won't be disappointed. I plan to buy the 2.1 version at a later date. In the meantime I shall continue to await for Andrew Garfield's Spidermen movies in the theatres. This movie earned its Four-Starer Rating. A major quibble of mine is the damsel in distress routine that Kirsten Dunst is always being forced to portray in the series. I'm surprised that this was used so much, and frnkly I blame the writers and filmakers for overdoing this routine.

1500470,5,B00005JMQW,"Spider-Man 2 is what fans dream about when the sequal to a movie as fantastic as Spider-Man is announced. Topping a film as great as that one is a definite challenge, but it seems to happen more and more each passing year. Sequals like this one, X2: X-Men United, T2: Judgement Day, The Dark Knight, and others all have one thing in common. Beyond just being a ""sequal"", they managed to outdo their predecessors in almost every way. Spider-Man 2 is not only a great sequal, it is one of the best comic book movies ever made. It doesn't go for the mature adult feel that The Dark Knight has. On the contrary, Spider-Man 2 maintains that corny camp and tongue-in-cheek humor that made the first one so good. Sure some of the dialogue is cheesy at times, and the action is never tries to be realistic, but isn't that why we go to these movies? To be virtually thrilled to the point of exhaustion? Okay, maybe that's taking it a bit far, but my point remains that these films don't need to strive for realism. Their fantasy elements and use of childlike imagination and wonder are what make them so great.

Its about a man with spider-like abilities fighting a man with mechanical tentacles attached to his back. The only thing I felt was lacking in TDK, is very abundant in Spidey 2. There is great humor, and the movie has the overall feel of an actual comic book. I also got a sense of the director and writers respect for their source material, but not being afraid to have fun with it. The ending of this film gave me chills the first few times I saw it. It wasn't until Spider-Man 3 actually came out, that the end of Spidey 2 lost some of its magic. Spider-Man 2 is in a solid second place on the list of my favorite comic book movies of all time. Right above films like The Avengers, Sin City, Iron Man, etc. There is really only one thing I didn't like about the movie. There were too many close-ups of random women screaming. It was okay once or twice, but not four or five times. That's minor though. This movie was a fine achievement. As for the Blu-ray transfer. Is it as great as the first one's? An emphatic yes! Even better, in fact. The adundance of detail and clarity are remarkable. This disc is a reference disc to show how amazing catalogue blockbusters can look.

1500477,5,B00005JMQW,"First of all, I have to say that, along with the first Superman film, X2: X-Men United and The Dark Knight, Spider-Man 2 counts as one of the greatest comic-book-based films ever made. Is the film a PERFECT adaptation of the comics? That's up for debate. But, I certainly wouldn't change this film in any way.

Along with a wonderful supporting cast, I love the acting from Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire as the leading characters, Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson. They have real chemistry, despite the intense anger and apprehension their characters are feeling toward each other. If you remember the end of the original film, Peter left MJ, standing in a cemetery, hurt and rejected and very confused. She has every right to be angry with him. However, Peter Parker is still Spider-Man. He's still the most honest, decent young hero the world could ever ask for. An audience can't help but be drawn to someone who is so good, especially when that person is being treated as badly as Peter is treated by his peers in Spider-Man 2.

I also love the writing. Spoiler alert: Just when the future of Peter and Mary Jane's relationship is in doubt, she leaves J. Jonah Jameson's son at the altar to go to our hero, running through New York in her wedding gown. She stands in his doorway. She tells him, ""I've always been standing in your doorway."" She tells him, ""I know there will be risks, but I want to face them with you."" She tells him, ""Can't you respect me enough to let me make my own decision?""

This is the most powerful and amazing declaration of love a woman like MJ could ever do for a shy, kind, good, caring guy like Peter. My heart continually sinks when she lays her hand on his cheek and says, ""Isn't it about time someone saved your life?""

This Blu-ray is well worth every penny. I would go so far as to say that Spider-Man 2 is the Casablanca of romances in superhero films.",1333238400,3,1894,4.481159420289855

Is it fun to see?  Sure.  But I would have preferred to see all of the extra stuff in  a DELETED SCENES section.  The original was extremely well-paced and well-edited.  The new cut belabors every point and is, well, too long.  I appreciate and think it's great fun to see the alternate elevator ride and JJJ in the suit, but there isn't a single scene that adds anything to the story EXCEPT the extended doctor scene where Peter's college doc explains that his psychiatrist tells him to have a ""strong focus on what I want,"" which Peter repeats when he next tries to use his dwindling powers.  Obviously, though, we didn't need that line since none of us questioned where it came from - we got it.

I'm a huge fan of extended Director's Cuts, but unlike some extended versions (ALIENS, LOTR) SPIDER-MAN 2, like STAR WARS, actually loses something with the additions.

1500537,5,B00005JMQW,"Spiderman (who is essentially Superman in a different outfit) versus his evil super-spider counterpart.

A really fabulous movie about epic Do-Good heroism in which the double personality of Peter Parker/Spiderman undergoes an identity crisis as he tries  to decide who he really is and who he will CHOOSE to be, all in the midst of being pulled apart by his circumstances.

Two of the big questions Peter/Spiderman must face in coming into his own are:  Should he choose a normal down-to-earth existence instead of living out his effective gift for doing super-good that interferes with the usual life of merely ordinary achievement?  And, could someone who is an exceptional do-gooder like Spiderman is--always liable to have super-enemies--give himself to human love or marriage?

Spiderman's evil counterpart, a genius Super-but-Human/Machine whose ""web"" must ultimately crash into destructive havoc, also undergoes identity crisis and ultimate choices.

If you haven't already put aside any stuffy prejudice you might have about this being trivial kid's-stuff from ComicLand, trumped up with awesome meaningless exaggerated Super Effects out of evil Hollywood, do put them aside right now and hasten to Watch this Super Show.  It is epic Idealism, all to the GOOD.  And it is all innocently presented!  There's nothing here to offend anyone's good moral code.

It's a very uplifting movie, in more than one way, to say the least.

Whoever designed the intricacies of all the battles and special effects in the movie is a real-life super Genius with a wild and daring sense of engineering!  To watch this movie is to be filled with Wonder.

Since I have a fear of heights, I felt very uncomfortable tension watching some scenes.  But if you see the movie on a TV or computer screen, you don't feel as much the fullness of the special effects that you would in a theater and I was better able to bear the movie as seen on the smaller screen.  When I saw just the previews of the first Spiderman movie in a theater, I felt way too much fearful sensation regarding the high-flying sequences.  Another thing that I had a reaction against was the too-real, scarry effect of an immense amount of shattered glass flying out of the screen in one scene.

I'm really enthusiastic about this movie and recommend it highly.  I enjoy it and like it from a feminine point of view, but I'd venture to say that for guys it would be at least as exciting as watching a Super-bowl game, and probably even much more so.

1500641,1,B00005JMQW,"There have been 2 major motion pictures made in the 00s that have absolutely, positively baffled me with how they have received such praise and recognition from BOTH critics and moviegoers, and, ironically, both films are based on ""comic book"" characters. One is THE DARK KNIGHT, which if you read my review of that, you'll know of the disdain I have for that movie, and the other is this film SPIDERMAN 2 (2004). I just plain do not get it! Yes, of course SPIDERMAN 2 has a lot of CGI-style effects, but I'm not going to harp on that too much as it this is the new direction of films (but very few filmmakers have figured out how to make it work), and also, if everything else is done well, I can forgive overdone effects (which this movie has!), but that's the point...EVERYTHING ELSE IS NOT DONE WELL!

There is not one single likable character in SPIDERMAN 2 and the most annoying is (of course!) the main one Peter Parker/Spiderman (played by Tobey Maguire). I saw Sam Raimi's first SPIDERMAN in 2002 and thought it was actually a good movie. It had been years since I had seen a new superhero film (last one was BATMAN AND ROBIN in 1997...Yikes!) and the failure of that one and ones after made me think the genre was dead. But I was really drawn into the story of SPIDERMAN...The first SPIDERMAN was formulaic, but, at the end of the day, it was GOOD. This is one reason why I can't believe how many people actually think that SPIDERMAN 2 exceeds SPIDERMAN, when SPIDERMAN is at the very least a GOOD movie, while SPIDERMAN 2 is such a POOR one...poorly acted, poorly written, poorly paced, just plain POOR!

I wouldn't even call SPIDERMAN 2 formulaic because it has stuff in it that doesn't remind one of a superhero film at all, mostly Parker pining for his fatal attraction high-school wannabe sweetheart Mary Jane (M.J. if your nasty!) played by Kirsten Dunst. Yes, typically in superhero films, there is a love interest, but the hero isn't acting like a sap for the entirety of the film! I've got to say that while Dunst was immensely appealing in the first SPIDERMAN, Raimi doesn't do a good job of making her look appealing at all in this sequel. Like Maggie Gylenhaal (check spelling) from THE DARK KNIGHT, I just don't see why so many guys are into this girl...the THREE guys being Parker, his ""best friend"" Harry (reprised by James Franco, who is barely used in this film), and J. Jonah Jameson's (reprised by J.K. Simmons) astronaut son, who M.J. is engaged to in this (no explanation given as to why!). In addition to the utterly sappy romantic aspects of this film, there is sappy dialogue all around, with a terrible (and unnecessary) scene of Peter revealing to his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) that he was indirectly responsible for his uncle's death in SPIDERMAN, as well as an absurd (and again, unnecessary!) moment where a major reveal happens on a subway train. SPIDERMAN hinted that Peter was going to develop into a hero to be reckoned with, but in 2, he regressed to being more juvenile than he was at the start of 1!

One of the biggest fails of SPIDERMAN 2 is the main villain Doc Ock (played decently by Alfred Molina, but he's not given much to work with or do), too.  His tragedy is interesting that turns him into a villain, but it is all done in an all too melodramatic manner and he gets the sappiest moment during the climax in an extremely cheesy scene of him, errr, ""communicating"" with his octopus arms after Parker (I mean, Spiderman, but he doesn't have his darn mask on, just like in most of the movie!) convinces him to turn away from evil...So that's it? The villain gives up...THE GREATEST COMIC-BOOK SUPERHERO MOVIE OF ALL TIME...Yeah, right!",1280880000,3,3690,4.577912254160363

1500643,4,B00005JMQW,"Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002), was an uneven, and somewhat unsteady feature film debut, for the intrepid webhead.  With the preliminaries out of the way, Spider-Man 2 (2004) is a bit scattered in places, but is still a more streamlined and focused effort, that solidly delivers action, drama, and excitement.  Technical advances in special effects, and a tighter screenplay, contribute to the impressiveness of the film.

Alfred Molina is cast as Dr. Otto Octavius, and he nails the character almost perfectly.  Although it might have been better if they had him keep his shirt on, and made him look slimmer.  Donna Murphy as Octavius's wife Rosalie, has a brief but key role, demonstrating that Otto is really a lovable, sensitive guy, who only becomes delusional, when his mind is taken over by his mechanical arms.

The sequel picks up some two years later, with Peter Parker (Toby Maguire) in college and living in New York City, but struggling to keep a steady job, pay his rent, and maintain his grades.  Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) has moved on, and is involved with astronaut John Jameson (Daniel Gillies), son of J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons).  Harry Osborn (James Franco) has assumed a significant role in Oscorp, and is backing Dr. Octavius's fusion experiment.  When an accident occurs during a test, Rosalie is killed, and a set of `smart' mechanical arms becomes fused to Octavius's body.  The arms take over his mind, and after disposing of a surgical team, Octavius decides to finance his fusion experiments by turning to crime.  Doc Ock and Spidey tangle for the first time, in a spectacular battle inside a bank, which continues up on the side of a building, with a very plucky Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), in the middle of the fray.

The subtext of the film is Peter's inner conflict about being Spider-Man, which apparently is keeping him from finding happiness.  The conflict manifests physically, when Peter becomes nearsighted, and occasionally loses the ability to generate his webbing.  The resulting George of the Jungle like crash landings, get old fast.  Peter's head gets so messed up, that he sees a psychiatrist, who screws him up even more.  Peter tosses his costume into the trash, quits being Spider-Man, and returns to a `normal' life, looking like Harry Potter.  Peter is blasted out of complacency, when Doc Ock kidnaps MJ.

The special effects are stunning, as Spidey returns to battle Doc Ock on a train.  Unfortunately the ending of this thrilling sequence, is marred by pure idiocy, as Spider-Man makes like Fred Flintstone, trying to stop the train using his feet.  Spidey winds up without his mask, this time before a trainload of witnesses.  Doc Ock is relentless, and delivers an unconscious Spider-Man to Harry Osborn in return for the tritium he needs for his experiments.  Doc Ock didn't bother to unmask Spidey, but Harry does, becoming perhaps the 100th person, to discover Peter's `secret' identity.

The film's final battle is visually impressive, and quite brutal, but still somehow kind of hollow and contrived, as Doc Ock regains his senses, and decides to try and redeem himself, by `drowning' the fusion reaction, and sadly himself as well.  Doc joins The Goblin in supervillain heaven, after becoming the 101st, to discover that Peter is Spider-Man.  MJ follows as the 102nd, and the crisis ends on a romantic, but bittersweet note.  Harry receives a visit from his dead father, while in a very uncool move, Mary Jane mimics The Graduate, setting the stage for Spider-Man 3.

Spider-Man 2 is the best of the three films produced so far.  The central story involving Doc Ock is strong, an effort is made to devote some quality time to Aunt May, and a few moments are spent with JJ Jameson, and the Daily Bugle gang.  The MJ/Peter relationship remains pretty awkward, and sometimes silly, but is still an improvement over the first film.  Kirsten Dunst shines, when put in a dangerous situation.

It seems that Sam Raimi can't resist unmasking Spider-Man.  Perhaps he believes that providing proof that Maguire is really inside the costume, results in the audience identifying more with the character, but it is just so overdone.  Spider-Man 2 nicely builds momentum, and moves forward strongly.  It loses focus at times and gets off on a few silly tangents, some related to trying appeal to a youthful audience.  The resolution may not be entirely satisfying, and but the overall ride is quite exciting and fun.",1268352000,,4474,4.959731543624161
1500644,5,B00005JMQW,"In this second installment in the Spider-Man franchise, Peter Parker has his back against the wall as he tries to juggle life as a student, being best friends with Mary Jane Watson, carrying the guilt of his uncle's death, freelancing for the Daily Bugle, delivering pizza, and, of course, being ever on-call as your Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-Man.

No matter how hard he tries, Peter just can't seem to balance everything at once and the constant sacrifices he makes in his personal life so he can help others wears him down . . . down . . . down . . . until he can't take it anymore and his spider-powers begin to change.

Then vanish.

The timing couldn't have been worse, either, because Dr. Otto Octavius's energy device backfired and has fused four robotic arms to his body, their AI worming its way into his brain, controlling him. All they care about is fulfilling their purpose and they don't care who they have to hurt to recreate the device they were made for.

Dr. Octopus's (Doc Ock) rampage through New York is met with little resistance until our favorite web-slinger attempts to take him on.

This movie thrills the inner fanboy much more than its predecessor and officially is my favorite so far in the Spider-Man series. This flick carries near start-to-finish classic superhero goodness: stellar aerial battles, eye-popping web-slinging, dual identity troubles, nerd-can't/won't-get-the-girl issues, a hardcore villain bent on his mark, trials, sacrifice--all crammed into a little over two-hour movie. But the pacing works and doesn't feel over cluttered at all.

You feel for Peter Parker every minute of this film, both when he's at the top of his game and when he's at the bottom, and when he loses his spider-powers, your heart sinks and you cry out, ""No! Not Peter! His powers are part of who he is. How can you take them away?""

Tobey Maguire was extremely believable in this film and brought a real depth to Parker that--though was present in the first one--really shone through in this one. And Alfred Molina as Doc Ock? Such duality. When you first meet Otto Octavius, he genuinely seems like a nice guy, an almost fatherly figure in a way, but when he loses his project and those he cares about, things switch and he barely resembles the man he once was. Yet deep within, you see him struggling against the mechanical arms that have taken over his body and mind.

J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson was hilarious as always, and Kirsten Dunst as MJ--there was more maturity in the character this time around and though she still acted kind of ""high school-ish,"" you also saw someone struggling with who they were--more specifically, trying desperately to reach out to the man she's fallen for but who is pushing her away.

Spider-Man 2 thrilled me to pieces. I was there on opening night and I left the theatre all smiles and in a state of disbelief at how downright cool it was. I wasn't sure if it would top the first one because most sequels--till that point because the Superman movies and the previous set of Batman films were pretty much what we had to go on except for X2--usually don't nail it like the first one.

I was proven wrong.

This movie rocked so hard I went back a couple more times and bought it on DVD as soon as I could.

Check this flick out. You're in for an amazingly cool, web-slinging good time.

Recommended.

1500645,5,B00005JMQW,"It's no surprise to many people here that I consider `Spider-Man 3' to be a travesty.  I was looking forward to that movie so much and I was let down SOOOO much by the sloppy construction, poor visuals, ridiculous scripting and overall messy structure.  The reason I was looking forward to it was because, as many have already stated (critics alike), `Spider-Man 2' is probably the best superhero movie EVER!

Plot holes or not, I still slightly prefer `The Dark Knight' (I love my superheroes to have a little grit on them).

Where `Spider-Man' was a nicely constructed origin story, `Spider-Man 2' becomes a brilliantly orchestrated expansion on that origin, complete with a profound moral structure that elevates the film from a mere `comic book movie'.  With a solid script that really gets to the heart of the characters and makes them real and relatable, `Spider-Man 2' is an outstanding film, no matter what genre you place it in.  It has layer upon layer of interesting and memorable development.

The film is, in a word, very complex (but that is a good thing).

Picking up where the first film left off, Peter Parker is struggling to accept who he has become.  He still suffers from guilt, but he has masked that guilt with a newfound responsibility.  That responsibility is making it very difficult for Peter to strike a needed balance between his personal life and that of being Spider-Man.  This is making his budding romance with Mary Jane Watson more aggravating than it should be.  His past actions (involving a certain flying villain) have posed a threat to Peter's relationship with his best friend Harry, who has vowed to avenge his father's death.  When you add to that a brilliant man controlled by his own genius (a marvelous Alfred Molina), you have a recipe for some exciting and provoking entertainment.

And that is JUST what `Spider-Man 2' proves to be.

Sam Raimi is at his very best here.  What I admire so much about this film is that, while Raimi definitely `goes there' in the visual department, he never goes so far that the film appears fake.  That was one of my biggest issues with that Spider-Mess of a third film.  Everything was SOOOO computer animated that it came off like a really bad video game.  Not so here.  Sure, there is a lot going on, but everything maintains a crisp, slickness to it that establishes a sense of realism.  Yes, I know that it is improbable that a tentacle clad man is ever going to scale buildings and wreck havoc in the streets, but Raimi made me wholly believe that it is not impossible.  His attention to detail here is impeccable.  I love the way that Raimi captured what it felt like to read a Spider-Man comic book as a boy.  The film has this light and airy (colorful) feel to it, yet it is laced with that suspense that only comes from truly engrossing yourself in this character and his purpose.

Bravo.

And yet still, the most impressive facet of `Spider-Man 2' is the fact that it has a real heart.  It is less the story of a superhero and more the story of a complex and conflicted young man, trying desperately to juggle his life in a way that makes the most sense; paying his dues where they belong while still developing a life that will satisfy and complete him.

We are all Peter Parker, minus the superpowers.

I still firmly believe that Toby Maguire was BORN to play this part, and it is still the only role I've ever really believed him in.  He is not my favorite actor, but this is one of my favorite characters, and my heart is welled up in this man because of what Maguire does here.

So, best superhero movie of all time?",1262044800,2,3613,4.572317262830482
1500723,4,B00005JMQW,"In 2002, Sam Raimi made a Saturday morning cartoon.
In 2007, Sam Raimi made an unabashed piece of s***.
In 2004, Sam Raimi made an actual film with a story.

I could really relate to Peter Parker's plight when I saw Spider-Man 2 theatrically. During that time, I was lazy and always late; disappointing my professors and yes, even employers. I was brilliant but couldn't quite pull it together. It's nice to be reminded of an actual personal connection I had to a superhero character.

I'm tempted to make an erectile dysfunction joke about Toby Maguire losing his powers but that isn't the right metaphor so I won't.

Spider-Man 2 has uncommonly witty, intentionally funny dialogue for the comic book movie genre. Here are some of my favorite exchanges:

Peter: ""I've been reading poetry lately.""
Mary Jane: ""Whatever that means.""

Miss Brant: ""Sir, your wife's on the line, she said she lost her checkbook.""
J. Jonah Jameson: ""Thanks for the good news!""

And of course, anything from Mr. Ditkovich, the humorous, debt-obsessed Russian landlord for Peter's apartment building:

Ditkovich: ""Rent!""
Peter: ""Hi.""
Ditkovich: ""Hi? What's hi? Can I spend it?""

Ditkovich: ""If promises were crackers, my daughter would be fat.""

A happy, glasses-wearing, 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' montage is infinitely better than Spider-Man 3's jackass, emo-hair Saturday Night Fever montage.

High points: Alex Ross' spectacular opening title design, Ditkovich and his family (including a cameo by Louis Lombardi aka Edgar Stiles from 24), an Evil Dead-style hospital massacre, Alfred Molina, J.K. Simmons, Doc Ock lighting a cigar with one of his tentacles, the lakeside climax and ""Go get 'em, tiger"".

Low points: James Franco's acting, Aunt May's 30-minute monologue, little ""Henry"" the plot device, a mask-less Spider-Man saving dozens of saintly train passengers (in a Crucifix pose) who promise to keep his secret safe.

It is arguably the best Marvel film of all time! (X-Men 2 is in this same category). From beginning to end, Spider-Man 2 is an inspiring and exciting tale that will have you wanting to watch again and again.
Like I said about the first film, the best part about this film is its story. One of the best things about this film are Spider-Man's struggles. Spider-Man is caught up on whether he should live a normal life or live as Spider-Man. Both come with their positives and negatives, and Spider-Man doesn't know what to do. The stress that he has to deal with is something of us have to deal with. Choices are very important, and sometimes it can be hard to make the right choice.
The other great thing about this film is the villain. Whereas the Green Goblin in the previous film was just utterly insane and evil, Doc Ock fights for a greater cause. He believes what he is doing is right, even if he is being controlled by his mechanic arms. With a villain that you can feel sorry for, Dok Ock brings further emotion and excitement to the story.
All in all, Spider-Man 2 is a must see for both fans and newcomers alike.",1249948800,,1279,4.517241379310345
1500727,4,B00005JMQW,"The action is always simple and direct : save the victims of the bad guy. The method is always the same: stop the bad guy's mechanics by throwing a few strings in its gears. The rest of it is building up a network, in that case a cobweb. But this is a film, not an electronic game and we are at the cinema not in front of a game console. So the film adds a good layer of sentimental events and feelings. The girl friend from far behind. She is afraid and fascinated. She is jealous and possessive. She is maybe adult and open-minded. That kind of stuff gives to the film some interesting dimension. In the same way, in this film in particular, the super hero loses and even chooses to lose his powers, for a while at least. This whole dimension of a normal guy, a normal boy capable of normal feelings and cowardice is exploited here to reveal the other super-hero dimension is both a choice and a responsibility, a responsible choice and a chosen responsibility. Then the film can work as a film and not a dumb computer game. Then the bad guy has a new dimension. He is the self-victimized inventor of a machine that will destroy the world. But keep in mind that the solution to sink that nuclear fusion machine in order to kill it is rather primitive in intellectual value. But it is full of emotional pulpy strength. The fear of nuclear power is also typical of the beginning of this century when the oil companies were still the masters of the energetic game. We have since then entered the final stage of that oil dominance and we have to consider other solutions, particularly that do not produce carbon dioxide. It is also a reflection of a way of thinking in these 2002-2006 years: nuclear energy was only seen from the American point of view as basically criminal either in the hands of criminal individuals (that's the case here) or in the hands of criminal states. Luckily this dimension  is aging pretty fast.

1500783,5,B00005JMQW,"It would be way too predictable for me to use an exaggeration here like, ""since this is better than the first, and I gave the first one a 10 out of 10, then I'm giving part 2 a 15 out of 10!!"" I won't quite say that. There's only one movie that deserves such an outrageous claim of actually scoring OUTSIDE the scale of numbers allotted for the rating, and that's Back to the Future part 1. Sorry, I got a off on a tangent, Spike Lee style. Back to Spider-Man 2.

This truly outdoes the first movie in terms of scale. And I guess that's how it works, you tell the origin story, after that you're free to explore different themes in that universe you've created. I don't like to use this word to describe a lot of things, but truly only one word describes this movie: epic.

There's a single driving force in this movie that instantly gets you worrying, and hoping for a good outcome: Peter Parker's tragic downfall, or to be more specific, him hitting ROCK BOTTOM with Mary Jane. He literally lost it all here at one point in this movie. I mean it doesn't get anymore serious than being told ""Oh, I'm getting married.."" As if that weren't enough, he couldn't even be in her life as a friend because of his constant disappointments he caused her because of his responsibilities as Spider-Man. Add to that his stressful friendship with Harry, his identity crisis, and you've got a pretty complex story, superhero action movie or not.

**You feel the full spectrum of emotions in this movie. Or at the very least, you feel the maximum emotion at one part of the spectrum, sympathy. I've said it already and I'll say it again, Peter Parker's crumbling relationship with Mary Jane was executed perfectly. There's two scenes that captures this feeling of desperation perfectly:

1) At that dinner party thing they were at, Peter gets hit with a 3 part combo: A) his friendship with Harry takes a further dive after being slapped by him twice, B) his friendship with Mary Jane takes a further dive after being told by her while they were outside on the balcony that she pretty much doesn't want anything to do with him anymore, in so many words, and finally, not too long after, C) gets hit with the ultimate crushing blow as he hears the announcement that Mary Jane officially agreed to marry her boyfriend. I think anyone can imagine how embarrassed, humiliated, and heartbroken Peter must've felt standing there, as his world slowed down to a dreamlike state, vaguely hearing J. Jonah Jameson shouting to him to snap a picture of none other than Mary Jane and her new fianc.

2) After falling to the ground after his webs failed him again, he picks up that newspaper and sees how he's hated by the city and gets no appreciation, with the scene then cutting to him sitting on his bed, tossing that paper away in disgust. It's at this point that we're on the edge of our seats, just wondering what he's gonna do next. His life was a complete tragedy.

**Amazing, lengthy action sequences.

**A sympathetic villain, much better than Green Goblin.

**It takes a certain expert hand to be able to have lines spoken by one character (Aunt May), then have those very same lines repeated by another character (Peter) to another character (Doc Ock), which is what finally gets that other character to see the error of his ways, all without seeming forced or convenient. There's certain elements of the plot that do seem convenient, but it's never contrived or forced. It's like a complex tapestry that all fits together and makes sense somehow.

**If I had it my way, I'd change the ending. I think it would've struck a better emotional chord had they ended it with the scene of Mary Jane hugging her fianc, after being dropped off by Spider-Man, as she sadly looks up to her love that would never be, as he then shoots out a web and flys off into the night. It would've been a great place to end, the music was PERFECT right at that instant she looked up into the sky at him, with that bright light illuminating her face. This angelic, melodic tone or music, whatever that was that played. Either end it there and move the scene with Harry and his father up BEFORE this scene (because you can't skip the Harry scene no matter how you end it), OR, end right after the Harry scene, after discovering all the Green Goblin equipment. Have that whole cancelled wedding and running scene be the START of part 3 (obviously it's too late for that). I guess the argument for keeping it the way it was shot is the fact that you then wouldn't have the shot of Mary Jane in Peter's window, looking out with a look that you can't quite tell if it's happiness or fear, in regards to her new life.",1230940800,,4670,4.5041322314049586

With the origin of how Spiderman came to be out of the way, the movie kicks right in. Peter Parker has put his social life on hold and has taken to crime fighting fulltime; which puts a damper on his college studies and work life. Now there is a new villian, Doc Ock. He has four mechanical arms. So I guess if you add his own arm and legs gives reason to an octopus; which has eight tentacles. This is a great movie all around.",1229731200,,574,4.0

1500787,1,B00005JMQW,"This movie is a masterpiece. It has a broad reach, genuine complexity in the emotional lives of the characters and a compelling storyline. I used to read Marvel comics all the time when I was a kid and this film captures those more fully than anything else in this genre. Peter Parker's anguish, star-crossed lovers, megalomaniacs running amok..it is like Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet and Julius Caesar rolled into an action movie.  Speaking of action, some of the sequences in this film are jaw dropping. The elevated subway ride is the best use of a subway in a movie since The Matrix and is just breathtaking. At the same time the movie is very well paced, razzle dazzle action sequences are mixed up with quiet moments of tenderness. The original Spiderman movie was fine but not in this league. ( Hey, wish the matrix sequels had followed same trajectory!). I also really enjoyed the humor scattered through the movie.  For everyone who loves this comic genre, I'd say this is the movie where they got it right. For people who don't, you will enjoy it anyway.",1224460800,,1060,4.693548387096774
1500788,4,B00005JMQW,"The dread franchise film has killed off many a potentially interesting character (Superman, Batman, Ripley, Rocky) & given leases of life to characters that are paper-thin (Indy Jones, Jason Voorhees, Catwoman). The latest franchise film is Spider-Man 2, directed by Sam Raimi. The 1st Spider-Man was probably the best comic book film ever made- mostly because its leads- Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, & Kirsten Dunst as his love- Mary Jane Watson a) can both act (unlike, say Christopher Reeve as Superman), b) are well cast (unlike Michael Keaton in the 1st 2 Batman films). & c) have chemistry (unlike Reeve & Margot Kidder in the Superman films). Maguire, especially, is so good an actor that he is 1 of those rarities that can run a panoply of emotions through just his eyes. He is almost irresistible to watch onscreen.... All in all, a very good film, & along with the 1st film, simply the best superhero films ever made. I hope the writers from this film stick with the whole series because, next to Batman, Spidey probably has the best pantheon of villains in comic book lore. Future baddies could include Dr. Doom, Venom, Carnage, the Sandman, Rhino, the Lizard, & Electro, among others. But, what makes good writing in such a film valuable are the little moments- like Peter's confession to Aunt May about how & why Uncle Ben really died, a surreal moment on an elevator between Spidey & a shocked citizen, references to other characters in the Marvel Comics universe, allusions & parallels to Oscar Wilde's The Important Of Being Earnest, & a street musician singing the old Spider-Man tv cartoon series theme song from the 1960s. Such touches are what invigorate this franchise above the others & what killed off the increasingly dark & directionless Batman franchise. Sam Raimi proves he is a director who knows how to milk a proven commodity without imposing his own distorted `vision' on it- unlike Batman director Tim Burton.",1221696000,,1954,4.924242424242424
1500789,4,B00005JMQW,"If you liked Spider-man 2, you should love Spider-man 2.1. The extra scenes are all great scenes that add nuance to the already-excellent film. They're mostly extra character bits, things that weren't needed, but certainly help paint the picture. The extra bits are so well-blended into the old footage that I didn't even recognize one new shot as such until, when watching the original version again, I noticed that it wasn't there.
Most memorable to me were J. Jonah Jameson wearing his newly-found Spider-man suit and pretending that he's the superhero, a much more rational and less venal confrontation between Peter and Harry at his birthday party (I'd always thought that scene in the original version was a bit choppy and emotionally sporadic) and a wonderful conversation between Mary Jane and her Maid-of-Honor about why she's marrying John Jameson.
The DVD set was lacking in features. There is a new commentary track featuring Producer Laura Ziskin and Writer Steve Ditko, but it's not very interesting. In addition, the other two commentary tracks were removed. For commentary buffs like myself, this should not be.
Most of the rest of the special features are all new, including a featurette about the new material. Unfortunately, these few extras have replaced the old bonus disc. You could do what I did, find a cheap copy of the original Spider-man 2, keep that bonus disc and give the movie itself to a friend so you have a 3-disc set, but that seems a lot to do just to have the complete set of bonus features.
In all, I would highly recommend this version. If you're a Spider-man fan or just a DVD geek, get this movie, just be prepared to have less bonus features than before.",1221091200,,1696,4.831615120274914
1500790,4,B00005JMQW,"Very few directors really understand the appeal of superhero comicbooks. It's a short list of successful superhero adaptations.

  Sam Raimi was firing on all cylinders when he made this movie. The result is solid action-adventure with well developed characters that pull you into the story and keep you emotionally invested. The action choreography is stunning and the special effects are polished. Spider-Man 2 has a talented cast that really brings this story to life - with Alfred Molina being a particularly inspired choice to play Dr. Otto Octavious and J.K. Simmons delivering a larger-than-life J.Jonah Jameson. Some serious writing skill is in evidence here - the story has excellent pacing and a great sense of increasing stakes. There are moments of emotional gravity, but the tone remains light while delivering the goods at the ""big moments"" - just like a summer movie should.

  Some nice cinematography really makes the most out of some truly inspired set pieces and it's all edited together rather elegantly. When all is said and done, there is more than enough fun and visceral thrills to go around - handled in a way that keeps the material close to it's pulp roots. More importantly, the conclusion is satisfying without everything being tied up into too neat a bow.",1215907200,,1285,5.037735849056604

1500855,5,B00005JMQW,"This review will be split into three parts, they will be split into The Story, The Characters and the Verdict. This will give you a fair and honest view of the characters, story and the movie itself.

The Story: Harry Osborn has now taken over Oscorp and he's financially backing a scientist called Otto Octavius who's experimenting with sustained fusion as a way of replacing conventional fuels. In order for Otto so sustain the fusion reaction he's developed artificially intelligent arms that attach directly to his spine that he can control as if they were additional arms. One day while demonstrating his experiment, Otto is unable to contain the reaction and it all goes wrong. The experiment becomes unstable but Otto refuses to halt it, it eventually gets worse and his wife is killed and the neural inhibitor chip on the arms is destroyed and they are fused to Dr. Octavius' spine. Thanks to the help of Spiderman the plug is pulled on the experiment and nobody else is hurt, but Dr. Octavius blames Spidey for the disaster. The AI of the mechanical arms seem to tap into Dr. Octavius' brain and begins to manipulate him into wanting to try the experiment again and set out to kill Spiderman. Spidey begins to struggle with juggling his powers, his education and his job and on top of that he has to handle the difficulty of his powers constantly halting at the worst times. Mary Jane is becoming a successful stage actress and desperately wants Peter to be there when she needs him and Harry is looking for revenge against spiderman for killing his father.

The Characters: I've discussed both Tobeys & Kirstens characters in my review for the first spiderman film and my feelings are generally the same. The character I'm going to discuss is the character of Dr. Octavius.

Doc Oc:  Played by Alfred Molina this is an intelligent choice for Doc Oc as he genuinely looks like the Doc Oc from the comics. He gives us his own brand of intelligence and sophistication when showing us the mental anguish that the character is going through in the movie.

Harry Osborn: We've seen a bit of a development in this character from the first movie. In that he was the kid with high expectations and a kid who idolised his father and was chasing after the girl (MJ). In this movie we're introduced to what some could consider a very different character, he seems arrogant yet he's tormented by the death of his father so he's someone who has a lot on his mind. James Franco is great at playing the tormented figure of Harry Osborn.

The Verdict: This is clearly the strongest film of the three, the action sequences particularly the fight sequence on the train is one that really gets your heart racing. Alfred Molina really fits the Doc Oc character perfectly and he really makes it believable. It has the general comedy moments that help you relax after witnessing a strongly emotive scene or a high impact fight sequence. The mixture of CGI and real life is un-seamless which gives it all the more realistic look. This is a movie that every comic book fan should own and enjoy for many years to come.",1214006400,,3102,4.661791590493602
1500856,5,B00005JMQW,"In Spiderman 2, Peter Parker, ahem Spiderman, decides to give it up. This is because he is beginning to believe that this wasn't his destiny. Was he really the one who should be looking after the city, especially when the city is still lukewarm about him? But, can Spiderman actually have the gall to turn his back on this city, especially when Doc Ock is running loose, causing havoc?

Spiderman 2 really examines who Peter Parker really is. Well, a better way to say this is that Peter Parker seems to try to figure out who he is. Is he really just the geeky guy who would love a shot at romance with Mary Jane, or is he destined to be Spiderman, the mysterious hero who is there to save the city from its malevolent forces?

Normally I'm not a big fan of comic book hero movies, but Spiderman 2 is about as complete of movie in its genre that has ever been made. It is an action movie, with plenty of suspenseful scenes and CGI effects, but it doesn't overdo them ad nausea to the point where it is being shoved down your throat. It is a comic book movie with heart and IQ. We see this as Peter Parker struggles with not only his friendship and family issues, but his own identity dilemma. How can he possibly balance the struggles of his real life with the struggles of being a hero? Is there a happy medium?

Another plus is the cast. Toby McGuire does a superb job again (for the 2nd time) as Peter Parker. He typifies the nerdy guy who would be the last guy you'd expect to be saving the city from world domination or crime. Kirsten Dunst is also phenomenal as Mary Jane, a perfect fit for this character who wants to love Peter, but doesn't feel like she knows who he really is.

There is probably a little more emphasis on Peter Parker's personal life in this film than on Spiderman fighting the city's nemesis, Doc Ock. This is good, though, because it really makes the story more real and doesn't dumb down the film to just a special effects show. Spiderman, we find out, is more human than meets the eye.

In the two disc set, disc one has a section of commentary with director Sam Raimi, as well as some of the cast, and a blooper reel. Disc two has a documentary about the making of the film, along with a documentary about the history of the villain, Doc Ock.

Over all, this is a sequel that is as good if not better than the first one. That is saying quite a bit, considering how lousy sequels usually turn out. Great movie!

1500857,4,B00005JMQW,"Pretty solid. I grew up reading Spidey comics in the late 60s/early 70s and I think Tobey really hits Parker nicely. J Jonah Jameson is also perfectly done. Not so happy with Mary Jane; she's too wimpy here, while a real tiger in the original comics.
But, this is a movie with its own agenda, and it fulfills that well. Good job on making Doc Ock believable; Molina is solid.
All in all, worth watching for pure comic book-style fun.",1212796800,,433,4.425
1500858,5,B00005JMQW,"Following up on the tremendous success of the first Spider-Man film, `Spider-Man 2' swung into action two years later in '04 re-uniting Maguire, Dunst and Franco and most of the original cast in a sequel worthy of its predecessor. In this second installment of the series Spidey battles another deranged scientist, the multi-appendaged Doctor Octopus played by Alfred Molina.

Along with the expected high quality special effects, terrific action sequences and unfulfilled romantic desires between Peter Parker (Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Dunst) this storyline delves into the deeper, more complex aspects of the Parker/Spider-Man psyche. The death of his best friends Father and his beloved Uncle Ben, his inability to share his secret with the girl he loves and the heavy responsibility of being a superhero take a toll on a young man. Is it better than the first? There are many who think so and they may be right, but either way it's definitely a welcomed addition to the Spider-Man saga!",1212796800,,996,5.110429447852761

1500860,5,B00005JMQW,"Let me say right off the bat that Spider-Man 2 was a great film the way it was!

While Spider-Man 2.1 didn't damage its original predecessor, it didn't add much to it either. Of the new scenes, the only ones that were significant in my view is where Mary Jane Watson discusses her impending marriage to John Jameson with a girlfriend and the added footage of the fights between Spidey and Dr. Octopus, especially on the train! The others were okay BUT weren't really missed.

Overall, I still enjoy the new version nonetheless. Worth the money but I'd find it at a lower price than what's there right now.",1212537600,,605,4.541284403669724
1500861,5,B00005JMQW,"Coming on the heels of a success like Spider-Man, it is sometimes hard to avoid a 'sophomore slump'. The temptation to make a 'different' movie sometimes leads them down wrong paths. Not so here. The followup feels very much cut from the same cloth of the first movie, but with more of a direct threat and momentum to the movie.

In the first movie, the Goblin was bad, yes. But his actions had little to no pattern or goal to them (except disintegrating the board members of course). He was simply out to either hurt or turn Spider-man. It worked well enough for the movie, and since the Goblin was basically a man unhinged anyways. However, in comes Doc Oc.

After a lab accident leaves him with four new appendages and the belief that Spider-man had ruined the attempt, he sets out to complete his life's work and rid himself of the one he blames his failure on. The fact is, if his experiment is completed, it could destroy the entire city, which gives real threat to the villain this time.

The drama plays out well enough, but it's the action sequences you wait for. You are not disappointed on that front here. The fight sequences are intricate, large and fast-paced.

In the end, it can be a matter of personal opinion as to which of the two movies you consider superior. For my part, my ballot is cast in favor of the 'sophomore success.'",1212451200,,1347,4.485714285714286

After a great title sequence, the film has a bit of a shaky start with some forced humor related to a janitor's closet but improves from there on in. Your enjoyment of this film will no doubt depend on your tolerance of Tobey Maguire's klutzy character and the continuing tease around his romance with Kirsten Dunst.

1500913,4,B00005JMQW,"This is the winter (or perhaps the autumn) of Peter Parker's discontent.  Two years after receiving his spider-powers, his life seems to be falling into chaos.  He's devoting so much time to fighting crime as Spiderman that his part-time job (from which he's fired in the first 15 minutes of the movie) and his college career are floundering.  For reasons unclear, he's no longer rooming with his buddy Harry Osborn, who has assumed the chieftainship at Oscorp; instead he's living in a poky one-room apartment in a shabby old brick building--and he's in arrears.  His beloved Mary Jane Watson, who's made it as a model and on Broadway, is mad at him because he hasn't come to see her in ""The Importance of Being Earnest.""  And he's discovered that his Aunt May's house, where he grew up, is being foreclosed on.  Then he finds that his webbing isn't always shooting when he calls on it, and he can't always stick to the walls he tries to crawl.  A doctor pronounces him healthy--physically.  What's a floundering Spiderman to do?

To makes matter worse, a new villain has arisen in New York--Dr. Otto Octavius, a physicist who, in trying to originate a working fusion process for Oscorp, is transformed into the terrifying Dr. Octopus.  Peter's first battle with him is nearly fatal, though he does contrive to rescue his endangered aunt.  Shaken, he begins to doubt his calling.  In the end, his solution is to ""hang it up""--or rather, to dump his costume in the garbage (it ends up mounted on Jonah Jameson's office wall).  But there's no rest for a hero.  Gradually, with Aunt May's unwitting help, he realizes that his Uncle Ben was right: great powers require great responsibility, and he'll ""always be Spiderman.""

Besides the continuing angst that is a Marvel trademark, this film is distinguished (of course) by eye-popping SFX--perhaps not *quite* so good as those in the first installment (when Doc Ock climbs up a wall, you can tell it's a computer animation), but still very impressive.  Especially noteworthy: Spidey's battles with Octopus and a thrilling sequence in which he barely manages to stop a runaway el-train (the fact that Manhattan doesn't have any of these any more is beside the point) with his webbing and nearly tears himself apart in the process.  (The following scene, in which the rescued passengers gently and carefully draw him into the car and to safety, is all the more affecting on account of the contrast.)  And Doc and his sentient robot arms, when seen at ""eye-level,"" are definitely among the better film villains on DVD.  Both Spidey and Ock are human-scale despite their powers, capable of doubt and, in the latter's case, reformation.  And there's a great surprise at the end of the film that makes all of Spidey's trials worthwhile.  In the final scene we see him (urged by Mary Jane to ""Go get 'em, tiger"") once again swinging through the skyscrapers toward another crisis, whooping joyously, with two NYPD choppers close behind him--a sort of symbolic suggestion of the possibility that he and the forces of law and order may finally be coming to an accommodation despite Jameson's ongoing (and, at one point, rather hypocritical) efforts to demonize him.  Though probably not for the youngest and most sensitive members of the family, this is a great wild adventure ride for everyone else, and may well serve as a launching point for some good conversations about ethics, perseverance, and the definition of heroism.",1201996800,,3465,4.897260273972603

I viewed this movie about as much as I saw the first I think. It just seems like they slowed down during production and the thought process during, was much broader, albeit more violent and even darker.

At first I didn't like this much, but I watched it the 3rd and 4th time through and I was throughly impressed. One wasn't this good and I only hope that Three will be as great (date is 4/4/08 and I'm still on my way to watch it).

Mary Jane is his love interest again, and she's married. However, she breaks up with Harold and goes back to Peter again. They love each other and unlike one, he actually makes time for her this time.

The action was great and the villain was a methodical genius. I liked the fight at the bank where money bags were thrown all over and Aunt Mae almost got crushed by that desk. That was entertaining.

1500919,4,B00005JMQW,"I liked Spiderman 2 even better than Spiderman 1. There were some scenes where he ran around with his suit but not his mask that added some interesting twists. I really liked the ending, but I don't want to ruin it for you, so you'll have to watch it yourself to find out. The second disk that was a documentary about the making of Spiderman was great too. I couldn't believe that Doc Ock was a Brit! He's very different in the documentary than he is in the movie. It was fun seeing all the blue screen stuff too.",1194134400,,513,4.191919191919192
1500920,3,B00005JMQW,"I know mine is not a popular opinion, but I do not understand why Spider-man 2 is praised as being one of, if not the best comic book movie ever made.  Spider-man 2's plot is profoundly flawed.  The worst of these flaws is the ""spider-man no more"" premise borrowed from the comics. I found the idea that Peter's mysterious loss of his power was a physical manifestation of his psychologically desire and that his power's could be completely nullified by his will alone to be ""very thin"" (To quote Riggs from Lethal Weapon). It would have been more meaningful (and believable) if Peter simply made a conscience decision to be spider-man no more with powers intact.
Another flaw is the movie version of Doc Ock. I think it is sad the writers decided to use the tired and overused idea of ""evil A.I.,"" reducing Doc Ock to a victim technology, instead of a truly menacing villain like Willem Defoe's Green Goblin. Alfred Molina is a gifted actor who deserved better. It would have been better to have Doc Ock driven into madness by the death of his wife and swear vengeance on Spider-man, who he blames for her death. Doc Ock could then regain his sanity by coming to terms with his role in his wife's death.
The last flaw I will discuss here is the fact that Spider-man appears unmasked in the presence of every major character in the movie, not to mention half the city of New York (unconvincingly portrayed by the city of Chicago).  The reactions of the New Yorkers who filled the train car as they peer on an unmasked Spider-man are more unbelievable than a teenage boy being bitten by a genetically altered spider and receiving super powers from it.
Thankfully, it is clear that the actors have comfortably grown into their roles for the sophomore film. Additionally, the visual FX in this film have trumped its predecessor. Lastly, the film does a decent job of continuing the character relationships of the previous film.",1192492800,2,1924,4.669616519174041

My favorite scenes were when Doc. Oc was climbing the buildings, all those arms moving around everywhich way. And the scene where he and Spider-Man have a fight on a moviing train were awesome!
This movie had a good solid storyline, and plot, as well as some of the best characterization of any of the Marvel franchise movies. The action scenes were intense (especially in 3-D) but they always advanced the plot. While they were definitely eye candy, they were also important to the storyline. This movie also continues the storyline of the Goblin, which culminates in Spider-Man 3. (I went and saw Spider-Man 3 at the theater and took my 3-D glasses. It looked amazing, especially the Sandman and the final battle between all the characters. I can't wait to get it on DVD and see it again at home.) All three Spider-Man movies have been brilliant examples that comic books are not just for kids, and that entertaining, meaningful stories can still be told, even with superheroes.

1500974,4,B00005JMQW,"I recently saw the first Spider-Man, and I loved it. After hearing tons of criticism - as well as reading numerous negative reviews on here - I became so weary of this film that I was hesitant to purchase it even at $5.99. After viewing this film, I was able to place all the in the proper perspective: Some people simply don't know anything about Spider-Man.

Over and over again, people constantly complain about the action, or lack thereof. Well first of all, Spider-Man was NEVER (I repeat, NEVER) marketed towards the action-crazed. Spider-Man was always divided equally between his personal life, and the villains he fought. He started out a little heavy into the crime fighting, but as the story went, more focus was placed on his personal life, and how he struggled to balance being Spider-Man and being human. That was the entire appeal of Spider-Man - he was the one superhero who actually had a life, as apposed to the way they always placed the lives of other superheros in a nutshell. As the series went on, there were some instances in the comic book (or even the cartoon) where the majority of the episode/issue dealt with his family and his love for Mary Jane. Basically, the main downside to this movie is the main thing that made Spider-Man different from the other characters of Marvel. Some people called this movie sappy. Well guess what? Peter Parker was a sap. That aspect was introduced in the first movie, so it's actually nothing new. Parker was always the geeky guy who was madly in love with the girls he could never get. As far as some reviewers claiming this movie brought ""nothing new"" - well sorry to disappoint you, but a significant portion of the Spider-Man series dealt with on going issues of his personal life. Again, that was the entire angle of Spider-Man: the balance between his personal life and being a superhero.

I am in no way saying this movie is perfect - or even classic for that matter. I can understand (and respect) disappointment, but to say this movie is total garbage unworthy of watching is simply ridiculous. For the most part, this movie is pretty true to form. In my opinion, filming movies like this are always mission impossible. If you keep the balance of action hero and love story, people complain to no end (as they are now). However, if edit all of that out, and target it more to Joe-Sixpack action fanatic, then the comic book purists will cry fowl about their heroes being butchered.

I strongly advise you watch this movie and judge for yourself.",1189987200,,2517,4.664414414414415
1500975,5,B00005JMQW,"It's not always easy to make a movie sequel. In some cases, it's not even a good idea. In my not so humble opinion, they did a great job with this one!

I admit I was worried. I wondered just how they'd handle Doctor Octopus. They did a good job.

Some classic moments that stick with me: Peter Parker's frenzied attempt to make a timely pizza delivery, while fighting crime at the same time. Whoever thought a super hero would have such concerns? Peter Parker has difficulty paying the rent because he can't keep a job!

The funniest scene was one in which his spidey powers had failed him. He was forced to take an elevator wearing his Spider-Man suit. A man was in the elevator with him, and casually talked about the suit. It went something like this:

""Nice suit."" Spider-Man, ""Thanks... it rides up in the crotch a bit.""

The most dramatic scenes involved Dr Octopus and Spider-Man fighting aboard the subway. Spider-Man had just managed to save the train and lie there, exhausted. His mask was torn, and everyone had seen his face.

They reassured him that his secret was safe, and he was their hero.

Dr Octopus arrived, ready to take Spider-Man away. The entire crowd stood up to support Spider-Man.

The special effects were terrific and the storyline either had you grinning wickedly from ear to ear at Doc Ock's puns or you were petrified at the horrifics of his intentions.

I love Tobey Maguire for this role as he has the face that just stays pique and forever young.  This is truly a great comic book story because it is totally unebelievable, yet the audience sits and reacts as though they are taken in by the whole thing.

This story picks up where the last one ended.  Harry is bereaved over his father's death and blames Spiderman.  Spiderman tries to deny who he is in order to spare MJ from being the object of an attack from his arch enemies but this all backfires when Doc Ock takes MJ to seduce Spiderman to come to him.  Harry is using Doc Ock to capture Spiderman for him to personally kill.  Spiderman ends up rescuing MJ and taking her to his web.  Tobey Maguire fans will sigh over this.

1501042,3,B00005JMQW,"There are so many people who laud this as the best comic book movie ever. I call shenanigans on that. Lifting the excellent plot device of Superman 2, Petter Parker decides to surrender being Spider-Man in order to find love and a life. Unlike the decision made by Superman, where he is forced to change who he is in order to embrace a normal life and find true love, Peter Parker selfishly gives up being Spider-Man to continue being who he was to begin with, a dork with school, girls, and work on his mind. The opening of the movie leading up to the central part of the story work quite well and I applaud the writing. Dr. Octopus' origin and goals, Harry Osbourne's continuing disdain for Spider-Man, and Peter Parker's angst all come across realistically and draw the audience in. Then they start to throw in the cliches and lame plot devices, a clear foreshadowing to what was to cripple the third installment: Peter's subconscious ridding him of his powers because deep down he doesn't want to be Spider-Man, the kid asking Peter where Spider-Man disappeared to giving ol' Parker second thoughts on surrendering the persona, etc. This is New York City. The belief that Spidey's removal would prove dire not only insults the true heroes of the city (firemen, police, etc.) it also stretches the realms of believability. With Superman, the world truly suffered when he surrendered who he was to become someone else. With Peter, it never really makes sense as to why he would want to be Spidey again, especially since his life improved once he surrendered the persona. The death of Doc Oc at the end was unnecessary as was Harry's pause when he could have killed Pete and finally gain vengeance for the death of his father.

Overall this was a fun movie. The best comic book movie, not quite. There is great writing and a good arc, but deep down it just rings hollow as to why Pete would want to remain Spidey.",1181174400,3,1914,4.629411764705883

It isn't a BAD movie, it just isn't terribly good.  The action is fine, most of the plot, sure, its ok, but I didn't like a few very big things about this movie.

1. What a stupid reason to lose your powers! He wasn't sure he wanted to ""be"" spider-man anymore or something, so he lost his powers.  Who knew that you could just turn them off whenever you got emo?

2. Wasn't Spidey just... not that funny? I mean, spider-man is infamous in the comics for being a sarcastic jerk to those he beats up on.  But he hardly cracked a joke in this movie. He just kind of... was sad and depressed and conflicted.  In the comics, Peter's life is terrible sometimes, but he ALWAYS keeps it together.  He uses these jokes to help himself stay sane.

3. Doctor Octopus's arms could've had a better story behind them. I know they probably didn't want to rehash the same plot from the first movie (replacing ""goblin glider"" with ""octo arms""), but something else needed to be done. Dr. Octopus was one of Peter's biggest enemies, and they kill him of in a ""I'm redeemed!"" moment.  Can't a bad guy just die a bad guy for once? And can't we have that classic comic ending where its like ""oh wait, but is he really dead?""

4. The romance story was weird.  For one thing, MJ left her fiance, who happened to be Peter's boss's son, at the altar for Peter, and we're supposed to assume Peter still has a job at the daily bugle after this?

5. OK, here's the scene that really pissed me off... The whole part on the train, where everyone saw his face but they were all like ""Don't worry, we won't tell!"" How stupid can you get? What a dumb scene! Almost as bad as the ""Don't mess with New York!"" scene in the first. Maybe worse, come to think of it.

6. Peter isn't invincible.  He can't just do what he did with that train. Yeah, he's super strong, but he can be broken... What Peter did in that movie would be something that maybe Venom would be capable of, but not Spidey.

So the action was great, the story was good, but so many little things annoyed me a lot.  This is actually my least favorite of the three because I was just too distracted by its weak points to really enjoy it.  While most say numbe 3 will be the worst, I enjoyed it much more.  I like the way they took liberties with the Sandman, adding a more human element to him... but they did totally ruin Eddie Brock. And Gwen Stacy. Well, you can't win them all.

So I will base this review on the extra scenes and the DVD specs and not the movie itself.

Disc 1

This one includes the movie with 8 minutes of bonus footage, this footage is not shown separately as `deleted scenes', instead, the scenes were added to the movie so we can consider this an extended edition of the film.

- Peter's birthday party is extended. Here, we see Peter and Harry going over Harry's issues with Spidey and the death of his father.

- The elevator scene in which Spidey talked about his costume was replaced with another that I personally didn't like, the new one feels awkward and not as spontaneous as the original.

- MJ at the shoe store. Mary Jane talks about love and the kiss she got from Spidey with a friend.

- Two fight sequences are extended; in the one in which Dr. Octopus takes aunt May hostage, a new bit in which they both crash into an office through the window and fight inside was added. Also, the train sequence has new bits of Spidey and Dr Octopus fighting while hanging besides the train.

- Jonah Jameson wears the Spiderman suit while the staff looks amazed, a quite silly scene that I understand why it was originally removed.

Bottom-line, the extra 8 minutes do not add anything to the movie; they are tiny bits that were originally removed for a reason. If you are a Spiderman fan and a collector you can get this for a very decent price, if you liked the original and expect to see major changes, the 2.1 version will only disappoint you.

The movie includes a trivia track with a lot of information about the comics, the actors and the movie itself; if activated, it will also show you behind the scenes during the movie. The movie screen will be minimized in the lower left corner to show the behind the scene footage in the full screen. Presented in English, French and Spanish (all three in Dolby Digital 5.1) and subtitled in the same three languages. It includes also an audio commentary by Laura Ziskin & Kirsten Dunst.

Disc 2

The features included here are more oriented to promoting the third movie of the hero. There is a sneak peek for the ""Spider-Man 3"" movie, which is basically the same scenes from the original trailer plus some interviews with the cast. I rather watch the last trailer for the movie but that one is not included here.

There is a `Inside 2.1 Featurette' that describes the process of completion of the scenes, ironically the last comment in this featurette says that `the movie the people will remember will be Spiderman 2 and not the 2.1 version'

Another preview for the video game is also here, but when you see it you'll see that it was added just to justify more features in the disc. Also, a look at Danny Elfman composing the music for the Spiderman saga is shown as part of the special features.",1177545600,36,2997,4.487132352941177

1501187,2,B00005JMQW,"Version numbers in the software industry are used to indicate the magnitude of changes in a product and typically indicate an improved experience.  Sometimes the point release winds out being worse than the previous iteration.  Such is the case with Spider-Man 2.1.  There are some interesting moments in the film but those scenes rarely elevate the product above the level of a crass marketing effort for Spider-Man 3.  I can only recommend it to hard core fans who have to own all the bonus featurettes, people who are exceptionally curious about the new scenes, or individuals interested in the film making process who want to see why editing makes a difference in films.

>>> 2.1 Spoilers <<<

Positive changes:

Viewers no longer have to fast-forward through a 2 minute trailer for Hitch before watching the film.

The revised Train fight and Aunt May kidnapping scenes are exciting.  Fans of the theatrical release aren't missing anything if they don't see these scenes but they are an improvement over the original.

The dream conversation between Peter Parker and Uncle Ben was extended.  The conversation is more coherent than the theatrical release.

The revised ""on the set"" Spidey-Sense and the new special effects featurettes are good.  If you haven't seen any of the trailers for Spider-Man 3 they include them on the bonus disc.

The Sand-Man comic reprint available from some retailers is a nice touch to promote the upcoming third film.

Neutral changes:

There's an alternate take of Joe's Pizza palor.  Joe criticizes his employees' pie making skills.  This take adds more flavor to the scene but Joe's line delivery to Peter Parker was crisper and more urgent in the theatrical release.

A new scene was added where MJ goes shoe shopping with another actress from the play.  They talk about how MJ feels about John the astronaut. The scene was likely cut for time reasons because the same information is relayed during the wedding planning scene when MJ kisses John and discovers her feelings for him aren't very strong.  Somebody on the crew must have liked this scene because one of the production stills was used in the marketing of the theatrical release.

The conversation between Peter and Dr. Octavius at the lab is longer.  Peter gets a formal introduction to Rosie.  Peter commments on how amazing Dr. Octavius' invention will be if it works before asking about the risks.  Later in the scene when Dr. Octavius brings up poetry he says some lines from T.S. Eliot that have a Einstein ""Theory of Relativity"" ring to them.

J. Jonah Jameson has an entirely different reason for wanting Spider-Man's suit than what's implied in the theatrical release.  The joke is funny but I think it's out-of-character for J.J. in both the film and the comic books.

Negative changes:

Peter's birthday party is drawn out at the end.  Harry tells Peter how he wants his father's killer to die and then reiterates how they're friends.  The scene ends with everyone singing Happy Birthday to Peter.  This section was cut because it violates the rules laid down by the Robot Devil to Fry on Futurama,  ""You can't have your characters say what they're feeling, Fry.  That makes me so angry!""

Peter's backyard meeting with Mary Jane is extended.  The added dialog and delays between the line delivery ruins the intensity of the scene.  It'd be a great example for a film class on how proper editing can improve a scene.  Peter compliments MJ's billboard.  MJ explains that it was supposed to be a picture for a catalog but the photographer liked her and then the acting job came up.  All her dreams are coming true. She asks Peter how his dreams are coming along and he says he's fine.  MJ asks if Peter is coming to see her play since he was always encouraging her to act - a reference to the first film.  Peter says he was planning on it. The subsequent dialog is from the theatrical release.  Later when MJ says she's seeing someone Peter's first response is a knowing  ""Therapy."" MJ says she's dating someone - a man.  The rest of the scene plays out like the film.  I'm glad they dropped the therapy line from the theaterical release.  It was probably a reference to MJ's troubled home life in the first film but it feels awkward and diminishes Peter's love for MJ.  Her answer is equally clumsy.  Of course MJ is seeing a man.  Does anyone think she's shacking up in Greenwich Village with Gwen Stacey?

The DVD commentary for the theatrical release mentioned the actor in the elevator was a comedian and they had multiple takes of him improvising lines with Toby McGuire in the Spider-Man suit.  An alternate take was used for 2.1 release where the man identifies himself as an image consultant and suggests Spider-Man branches out from news print and promote products.  They should have kept the original take from the theatrical release and used the best of the remaining takes for an elevator scene featurette.

Peter Parker's pizza delivery sequence to the secretary was extended.  He pulls some webbing off the pizza boxes.  As he's leaving he heads for the janitor's closet before being directed back to the elevators.  The scene was a bit drawn out but what really bothered me was the cuts as Peter is leaving the janitor's closet.  There's a side view of Peter closing the door.  The camera cuts to Peter's front so you can see him pick up the pizza boxes.  Then there's a very quick cut to a close-up of Peter's head and shoulders.  The perspective change is jarring and I believe the second or third cut was removed from the theatrical release and it works a lot better that way.",1176854400,21,5604,4.762993762993763
1501188,4,B00005JMQW,"The ""2.1"" release of this film is just a gimmick to get some more product on the shelves prior to the release of Spider-Man 3 -- the extras disc doesn't even include a trailer for Spider-Man *2* though there are a few repetitive looks at #3 on there.

This is a slow, contemplative film, especially for a box-office blockbuster. Most of the conflict and action is going on inside Peter's head as he tries to reconcile all of his personal worries (no money, poor grades in school, his aunt losing her home to foreclosure, lost potential relationship) with his sense of responsibility to share his gifts to help society. The action is slow-burning, but the set pieces are spectacular and all the characters (even the villain ""Doctor Octopus"" as played by Alfred Molina of ""Frida""), are thoughtful and three-dimensional.

The real draw to this DVD, in the event that you haven't bought this movie before, is the low price and the 8 minutes of additional footage. They're mostly quiet additions, focusing on the characters: Peter Parker (Spider-Man, of course) and his elderly Aunt May, his rich friend Harry, and his would-be girlfriend, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst, looking sad but lovely). If you haven't seen the theatrical cut more than once, you might not even notice the additions. One is an extended take of Peter's birthday party, which introduces the characters and sets up the conflict between Peter and Harry. My favorites are the lingering shots between Peter and MJ, which were dropped because they interrupted the pace of the theatrical film. It's clear why some were cut out: The improvised elevator goofiness with Hal Sparks runs a bit long, and the scenes of newspaperman J. J. Jameson in Spider-Man costume romping around on his desk are just silly. Other additions which I didn't notices were some special effects shots from the fight scenes, which  just weren't finished in time for release.

Spider-Man 2 is heartbreaking, dazzling, uplifting, romantic ... all while avoiding cheesy cliches as much as possible. I'm cautiously optimistic that chapter 3 will be as good (same cast and production team), but this one will be hard to top.",1176854400,,2150,4.947368421052632
1501189,5,B00005JMQW,"When I found ""Spider-Man 2.1"" at Wal-Mart, I wasn't expecting much. Ever since ""Lord of the Rings,"" extended DVDs of movies in franchise series have become the norm, and some are not very impressive. One thing that made me decide to get it was completely new Special Features. I'd bought the first two Spider-Man films earlier this year, and I hate getting a DVD with an altered movie but the same Special Features rehashed.

The extended film is worth it! (Especially at $13) Instead of little bits where you immediately think ""Oh, look, something new,"" the new bits of footage here are so seamlessly interwoven, most of the time I realized ""That wasn't there before!""

There's a longer talk between Harry and Peter during Pete's birthday party, which leads into Aunt May and MJ bringing in the cake. (I didn't pause to count the candles!) There's a new scene where a friend of MJ's asks her if she's sure she's with the right guy, strengthening the ending. The elevator scene is not extended: it's a completely different and longer version! I don't laugh at movies much, but this new scene dug up some chuckles! There are also new bits added to the fight on the train, as well as other bits. Because of the seamless integrating, I can't quite recall them all!

I would have liked to have seen some other scenes extended: more about Aunt May would have been nice: in fact, after watching this, I found out there was a scene in some theatrical versions that had Peter call Aunt May near the end of the film, but for some reason she doesn't answer the phone, though she is seen hearing it ring. This would've been interesting, and helped further whet our appetites for ""Spider-Man 3.""

However, there is nothing here that would make the movie go beyond a PG-13 rating, so if you're looking for more violence, blood, gore, nudity, or sexual or sensual material, it's not here. As above stated, some of the fight scenes are extended, but nothing worse than what was already in the movie.

Regarding the Special Features, now: I haven't watched them all yet. Like I said before, the Special Features of the previous DVD are not repeated, but the menus are otherwise identical. Not even the Audio Commentary is the same. In fact, this time Producer Laura Ziskin and Screenwriter Alvin Sargent get to do the commentary. I'm an aspiring screenwriter myself, so I intend to listen to this commentary soon.

From what the packages say, the Spidey Sense feature (I haven't used it on the other one) is at least enhanced, showing you behind the scenes footage. However, the shrinking of the movie to make it ""Picture in Picture"" can be annoying, especially if your DVD player pauses for a transition.

There is one weak special feature: ""Inside 2.1"" just points out the new and extended scenes... really, shouldn't this be on the audio commentary?

The other special feaures are ""Sneak Peek: Spider-Man 3,"" ""Multi-Angle: Danny Elfman's Score,"" ""With Great Effort Comes Great Recognition,"" and ""Visual Effects Breakdowns.""

If you're planning a ""Spider-Man Party"" before going to see ""Spider-Man 3,"" get this one! You will not be disappointed!",1176768000,3,3131,4.804832713754647
1501190,3,B00005JMQW,"The idea that Spider-Man 2.1 is a gimmick should come as a surprise to no one.  With the release of Spider-Man 3, very possibly the most anticipated movie of 2007, right around the corner, it is only logical that Marvel would try to cash in on the unprecedented hype surrounding the franchise's latest entry.  Setting this fact aside and looking at Spider-Man 2.1 for what it is, fans of the soon-to-be trilogy will surely enjoy this DVD release.  With eight extra minutes of footage, not only extending scenes but also completely reworking the story in some areas, Spider-Man 2.1 is quite a different experience from the theatrical release of Spider-Man 2.  To start, the breath-taking fight sequences during the bank robbery and on the train have been added to in subtle, but brilliant, ways; for example, when Spidey launches himself like a rocket into Doc Ock or when Doc knocks Spider-Man out a window only to be taken along for the ride.  These clips that last no more than a few seconds a piece make the fights much more intense.  They work wonderfully, the result feeling even closer to the scrappy, up-close and personal fights that Spidey and Doc Ock had in the original comics.  The rest of the material added is questionable.  While there are funny moments such as the alternate take of Spidey and Hal Sparks in the elevator or Jameson's new scene involving the spider-suit, they don't really add anything to the film.  The other extended and added bits, though they add depth to the relationships between the characters, don't flow right with what was here previously.  The main reason this is a problem is the lack of Sam Raimi's presence on the project.  As far as one can tell from the DVD, Raimi had no involvement in this release whatsoever. This version of the movie is filled with scenes that were left on the cutting room floor for a reason--not because they're bad per se but because they don't work with the best of the material that Raimi used to make up his theatrical cut of Spider-Man 2.  If Raimi had been allowed to make a director's cut, it stands to reason that there could have been a version of Spider-Man 2 superior to the theatrical release.  As it is, Spider-Man 2.1 is an interesting experiment that didn't really need to be conducted. Even the coordinator on this project admits in the ""Inside 2.1"" featurette that the theatrical cut will be the one that people will remember.  Even so, those interested enough to watch Spider-Man 2.1 will most likely find it intriguing and get some enjoyment from this unnecessary but harmless curiosity.",1176768000,,2577,4.748878923766816

1501192,4,B00005JMQW,"Peter Parker (Tobey McGuire) is having a hard time balancing his priorities.  Thanks to his secret identity as Spider-man, he's lost his job, his grades are failing, he's lost his best friend Harry (James Franco), and he lost the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  While he still sees these friends occasionally, Harry is obsessed by his desire for revenge on Spider-man and Mary Jane has a new boyfriend.  Things are even a struggle for Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), who can't seem to pay her mortgage.

All this is enough to make Peter rethink his superhero ambitions.  And, since he seems to be losing his superpowers, maybe he can put everything behind him.

All this couldn't come at a worse time, however.  The brilliant Dr. Octavius (Alfred Molina) is conducting a dangerous experiment with fusion.  When it goes wrong, he winds up with appendages wired into this nervous system, giving him four extra arms.  The arms also begin to control his actions, and the newly named Doc Ock soon becomes a danger to the city.  Can Peter pull himself together to save the day?

I loved the first movie, but this one isn't as good.  They tried to replicate the emotional impact of the first movie, but it doesn't ring as true here.  In fact, the emotional story slows the movie down in places.  Frankly, I don't go to see superhero movies for lots of emotional story telling.  Some is fine, but they went a little overboard here.

But the movie is still entertaining.  The action sequences are great.  The entire cast does a great job again.  And the special effects have improved since the first movie.  There are only a couple times I can even tell that it's not 100% real this time.  The climax was weaker then I would have liked, but I am willing to forgive that.

1501193,5,B00005JMQW,"NOTE: This review is for SPIDER-MAN 2.1 Extended Cut.

I wouldn't have thought it possible, but the best superhero movie just got even better, with 8 minutes of restored footage.  Sure, 8 minutes doesn't sound like much.  But most of the additions are subtle--a few lines of dialogue which extend existing scenes.  Most of them make sense, especially (SPOILERS AHEAD) those which evoke better understanding of/sympathy for certain characters, and a few which are strictly for laughs.  In fact, it's hard to believe that what is arguably the funniest moment in the film was left on the cutting room floor.  I won't spoil it, but it's a real treat for fans of J. Jonah Jameson.

I realize that the timing of this release coincides with the theatrical release of SPIDER-MAN 3.  So what?  Sam Raimi has made 2 (maybe 3?) of the most well-defined and purely entertaining comic book films ever.  I don't mind spending a few extra bucks to support his efforts, and get to see a bit more of a film that I love.

By the way, don't sell your original copy of SPIDER-MAN 2.  All the bonus materials are new to this release, so you're not getting duplicates of the film itself or the extras.",1176508800,4,1179,4.615384615384615

1501228,4,B00005JMQW,"SPIDER-MAN 2 is arguably the best comic book action movie ever made. When I saw it in the theaters, I said: ""wow""!!I was already satisfied with the original cut and now with Spider man 3 in the horizon, Marvel is coming out with 2.1. Luckily, I managed to see my friend's  sampler.

Forget everything else when you watch this extended cut and it's outstanding. The extra 8 minutes of footage add context, lengthen and deepen some emotional scenes, inject the funniest moment of the film and (surprisingly) add and extend fight scenes.

From what I can tell, almost all the deleted scenes are incorporated in. The elevator scene when spidey lost his powers, more emotional scene and character depth why he is losing his powers and the clock tower/subway fight with Doc Ock has been extended(although the extended scenes are very subtle).

For Spider-man fans(such as myself), it is something that completes the entire context of the film and defines why Peter Parker is such a comic book hero than shall I even say Superman or Batman. He is broke, have a lot of hardships but he still travels the straight and difficult path just to do the right thing. His problems caused him to slowly lose his focus, hence his powers. He believes in (Stan Lee came up with this)""with great power comes great responsibility."" and Aunt May's ""sometimes we have to give up the things we want the most, even our dreams"" just defines Peter as human, with flaws but he is always willing to make a sacrifice.

Now, I have some experience with marketing gimmicks to know this is also one. But for Spidey completist, (if it wasn't for us, no 2.1 wouldn't be released)it may be worth the purchase. It is not a superior cut of the original but it does fill up the void between 2 and 3. I already own the SE 2 disc release, as well as the outstanding Superbit version(the superbit version utilized 6.8 gb space out of the 7.4 gb dual layer)and I can't help getting a bitter taste in my mouth and now I heard Fantastic Four is also getting an extended cut.

Video: The picture is amazing, although the superbit version is still a bit better. It looked like it has a better transfer from the first release. I didn't see any noise because of the extended scenes. Colors are radiant and vibrant. It was sharp and clean, and for some reason, the 2.1 transfer seemed brighter and yielded more detail in the black levels where needed. Superior transfer from the original SE.
Audio: French, spanish, Portugese, English 5.1 DD track, sorry, no DTS-ES. Sound is crisp and loud with 5.1 Dolby Digital track.
EXTRA FEATURES: Weak. The special features in the original dvd release are a lot better. For die-hard fans, you still cannot get rid of the original version, it has the best special features.

I cannot say this version is better than the first Special Edition or the Superbit, but die-hard fans will be happy to own it although I CANNOT give it a ""HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"" RATING. It is something you have to think about, if you already have the first SE version, but definitely grab this one if you don't own any of the other previous dvd releases.

RECOMMENDED!! It is a weak 4 stars for the dvd release, 5 stars for the movie.",1175990400,18,3194,4.601054481546573
1501229,5,B00005JMQW,"Like many skeptics I approached this dvd with great caution. I thought this is another sales gimmick. 8 minutes. Big Deal. I managed to get my hands on a region 3 disc and thought I was going to waste 2 hours of my time. But being a Spidey fan I thought what the heck.

I was wrong. Dead Wrong. This is a whole new movie. All the scenes are totally reworked. The fight scenes are longer and more violent (that is great). The added scenes to the movie actually improves on the theater version. I guess Sam Raimi had a look at his movie and said hey why don't we do that scene we had done in a new way... The closest thing I have ever come across something like this is the Teddy Rawling's Alien 3 Cut. It is a whole new cut and elevates the original movie. Sure it is 8 minutes longer but nearly all the scenes are woven together from a different cut.

The most obvious is the elevator scene. Here the guy who is stuck in the elevator actually knew he was talking to the real spidey. The original cut features him speaking about the spidey outfit to someone he thought was an impostor. Here the elevator guy wanted to sell his marketing plan to the real spidey.

Another example is the first fight with Doc Oct. The extended version shows the fight taking place from the high rise buildings and continues inside an office. It is more violent and more dramatic. The operating scene where Doc Oct was introduce is remade to look like a scene from the ""Evil Dead"". I have not dwell into the features yet.

I hope this convinces you as much as it convinced me that the Spiderman series is one with its intergrity in tact. I won't tell you more and save the rest for you to find out and savour.

I agree w/the other posting which stated... (and I am semi-phrasing here)

They are correct!

Everyone will have certain (specifics) that THEY want to see in a movie...

For me... I like directors commentary, plenty of special features... etc

I read the packaging...and ""compare"" ...and see what is REALLY different between the 2 versions... for me this is a simple solution ....

I ""was"" one of those who complained about the different versions of a DVD which seem to always come out... so, instead of complaining... I now do the following... (and this is also what I do after a new version (of any film) that has been released)

1. I have seen Spiderman 2... (enjoyed the film)

2. I have the Spiderman 2... (old version)

3. Will rent/find obtain THIS (2.1) version and see what exactly intails withn the 8 minutes... and IF they are really anything worth while...

4. If it is worth the effort/money... (if it is)...I will trade the OLD version of S2 (granted at lower cost, but meh).... then GET this version to replace it... however ...I will wait until it drops in price and or buy it used...

5. If it is NOT worth the addiotnal 8 minutes... I will remain with the version I have...

Sam Raimi clearly stated that Sony wanted to do an extended version of the movie, but time constraints prevented them from finishing the effects. This was months before the first release of the film on DVD. I was grateful to him for announcing this long before the first release as I was chomping at the bit to buy the disc. So I held off for this one. Of course I wound up getting the first release as a gift, so now I'll have both. Can't wait to pick it up.

1501317,1,B00005JMQW,"I'm not a spiderman fan, and thus am not blinded by fanboy/girl love for comic books to recognize this movie as bad.  Compared to the first movie, which was at least very well done and interesting, this one is a trashy sequel that takes an extra half an hour for awkward romance scenes which would make the romance scenes in ""Attack of the Clones"" look like Romeo and Juliet.

The movie seems to take a 2 hour idea and stretch it 30 minutes longer, with the fight between Spiderman and Doctor Octopus never really reaching a head until the third or fourth fight, with the previous two just being excuses to show them crawling around buildings hurling stuff at each other.

Perhaps the absolute worst part of the movie is the romantic scenes between Peter Parker and Mary-Jane.  The scenes are so horribly awkward as to make the romantic scenes in Star Wars Attack of the Clones look like true Shakespearean love.  Peter just says the most terribly awkward things to Mary-Jane, even so far as trying to get her to be his girlfriend when she's engaged, and pissed off at him for not coming to her play even once.  There is such little chemistry between them, they could literally be digitally replaced with each other or with apes and there'd be little change.

While some actors like Alfred Molina and the guy who plays the Osborne kid actually put effort into their roles, the main guy, Tobey Maguire, has the same stupid, ditsy, awkward state to his entire character unmasked.  Bumbling about from getting fired to avoiding his landlord in stale and uncomical moments, to trying to get Mary-Jane to fall for him (in very lame and unbelievably awkward exchanges and dialogue) and trying to be Spiderman and a student all at once (despite the fact that all the crime he appears to be fighting is a purse snatcher in one scene, some robbers or so in another, and Otto Octavian towards the latter parts, after he's become Spiderman again), rather than make you wonder why Spiderman puts up with all this crap, it makes you wonder why there aren't any cops in this city.

All in all, it was a very lackluster sequel, and Maguire, suitable for the simpler plot of the first movie, looks terribly one-dimensional and ditsy for a movie with a decidedly darker tone.

One more thing, unrelated to the plot or anything, is one highly disturbing scene that must have been heavily edited in order to keep the movie from becoming an R or an NC-17: The scene where Octavian bludgeons several surgeons to death with his metal tentacles.

This scene was the most disturbing and violent scene I've ever seen in any movie, and had it been given the suitable amount of blood necessary, would have made Caligula seem tame.  In the scene where the surgeons are trying to cut the tentacles off Otto Octavian's back, they come alive, and start hunting and beating the doctors to death, hurling them around the room, smashing into them, crushing them.

There's one particular part which is beyond gruesome, showing a female doctor being dragged across the metal floor, while she digs her nails somehow into the metal, and shears ribbons of it off with her fingernails.  Considering that this is thick metal, her fingernails should have snapped clean off, and had her fingernails stayed pressed into the metal, they should have been shredded down to the bone, in a disgusting mess of blood gushing rapidly from her fingers.  Of course, to keep this PG-13, they didn't do such a thing, although the sound and sight of this heavily implied such.

That snuff-like scene, coupled with godawful acting on Tobey Maguire's part, horribly stilted and awkward dialogue, and a movie that drags on and on listlessly, with little chemistry between the main characters, makes this sequel a truly terrible one.",1172880000,3,3772,4.744648318042813
1501318,4,B00005JMQW,"The Spider-Man series is one that I feel is complete and with intergrity. The re-occuring charecters are portrayed by the same actors and actresses in each movie keeping the entertainment value higher than predecessors of other super-hero movies that have changed the casting too much-- distracting away from the believability of the charecters' lives. I must commend the Sony studios and producers for that.

However, I'm bothered by this up-coming re-issue of what most Spider-man fans already own (without the extra schene as this new one). Why must fans have to pay more for what they have already paid for? Why couldn't the studio release the ""extended version"" with the first release of the Spider-man 2 movie like other movies and studios have done? Why must they make it so tempting for young people and kids to spend money on something that really isn't worth the extra cost? I'm honestly bothered by this.

I enjoy the movie and can't wait to see what the extended version is all about, but it's just a shame the studios feel it neccessary to drain money from Spider-man hungry fans when really they're paying more for what they're getting.",1172275200,27,1150,4.892307692307693

1501385,5,B00005JMQW,"No, Harry Oswald doesn't go around quoting ""The Princess Bride,"" or referring to Inigo Montoya's famous quest to revenge his father's death by a six-fingered man. However, he blames Spiderman for the death of his father (AKA the Green Goblin). He'll do anything to avenge his father, and that includes making a deal with Dr. Octopus.

That, and several other excellent subplots help make Spiderman 2 the best screen adaptation of a comic book series. I argue that it is better than best-of-show in a genre, and can be placed in the echelons of great movies overall.

Although incredible effects help create a real Spiderman, the movie excels because of the humanity of Peter Parker.

Peter is in love, but isn't willing to tell Mary Jane. He uses Spiderman as his excuse even though it is old fashioned fear of commitment and rejection that are at play. Any teenager or young 20s man has felt that angst, and so we relate to Peter.

Peter loves his Aunt May and the late Uncle Ben, and feels heavy guilt for Uncle Ben's death. It was Peter, after all, who let the thief who later killed Ben escape. The relationship between Aunt May and Peter is like a grandmother and grandchild, and is believable.

Mr. Jameson is the least believable character, and the most caricatured. Snapping quickly at any opportunity to malign Spiderman's reputation, he acknowledges that Spidey's apparent retirement causes an increase in the crime rate.

The Plot:

Peter tries to set aside his Spiderman persona to forge a real life. Too often, he found Spidey interfering with his ability to keep his word, to be on time, keep his grades up, to earn money and to keep and grow relationships.

After soul-searching, he quits, and tries a post-Spidey lifestyle. He watches as police rush by a few times. When Peter saves a baby in a burning building without the assistance of super powers, only to learn someone remained in the building and died, he knows he could've done something.

Meanwhile, Harry Oswald introduces Peter to his hero, physicist Dr. Octavius. Dr. Octavius is working on a project that can revolutionize and resolve the world's energy problem. During a demonstration, the experiment goes awry. Spiderman launches into action, and saves the day. Unfortunately, Dr. Octavius's beloved wife dies in an explosion, and the Dr. himself finds that the robotic arms he used to help with the experiment have fused to his nervous system.

Raging against Spiderman for, as he believes, killing his wife, Dr. Octavius seeks revenge. Concurrently, he tries to rebuild the dangerous experiment. He needs rare materials, and deals with Harry, who also wants revenge. If Dr. Octavius captures Spiderman, Harry will give him the material.

When Harry pulls out a dagger, ready to kill the bound up Spiderman, he pulls off the mask, and everything changes. How can his best friend be Spiderman?

All of the while, Peter is trying to make ends meet. The cantankerous Mr. Jameson hires Peter to photograph a social event involving John, his son, a famous astronaut.

It turns out that John is seeing Mary Jane, and becomes engaged to her. Peter's heart sinks, and he tries to talk her out of it and back into a relationship with him. MJ counters that she and Peter have no relationship to return to. It is over, and Peter knows it.

When Dr. Octavius kidnaps MJ, and tells Peter to tell Spidey to meet him, Peter must decide if Spiderman must exist to save MJ, the world, but in doing so, lose MJ's heart.

What will Peter choose? The love of a woman, or her life? It is an impossible choice, and replete with danger either way.

The transition between comic book and movie screen has never been as smooth. Ang Lee's ""Hulk,"" had no depth, just as Christopher Reeve's ""Superman."" Fun? Yes, but neither were great movies. ""Spiderman 2"" is a great movie.

We forget who are the actors. Kirsten Dunst as girl-next-door Mary Jane Watson is fantastic, being beautiful and ordinary simultaneously. Rosemary Harris looks as much as like Aunt May as anyone could. Finally, Tobey Maguire is so perfectly cast as Peter Parker, that all is seamless.

I fully recommend Spiderman 2. I'm ready for ""Spiderman 3,"" and hope the producers realize that there is enough good Spiderman material to make another five movies as good as this.

1501386,5,B00005JMQW,Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)~ Tobey Maguire is a stupendous sequel to an amazing superhero movie. Tobey McGuire is doing a bang up job with the role as Spider-man and Kirsten Dunst is so beautiful. The music is great and is right on mark for a super hero movie. The script is very well written and one of the best movies that I have seen in a very long time. I highly recommend it and I give it 5 well deserved stars.,1167177600,,430,4.2560975609756095
1501387,5,B00005JMQW,"To quote the tagline from the first `Spider-Man' film, ""With great power comes great responsibility"", and in this case that is very true.  After the sheer brilliance that was `Spider-Man', Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst had a great responsibility to make at least an equally impressive film.  Well, if you've been privileged to have seen `Spider-Man 2' (yes I did say `privileged') then you know that they succeeded in delivering a top-notch sequel!  Giving us sharper graphics, deeper story lines and excellent acting, `Spider-Man 2' is utterly fantastic.

With the origin of Spider-Man out of the way, the second chapter has more time to explore how Peter Parker (Maguire) will deal with his new `responsibilities', including whether or not he should pursue a relationship with Mary Jane (Dunst) or stay alone in order to protect the ones he loves.  His decision is almost solidified by the appearance of the evil Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina).  Once a great physicist, Otto Octavius was transformed into the monster known as Doctor Octopus after an experiment went haywire.

Not only does Peter have this new atrocity to contend with, but his very best friend Harry (Franco) is bent on avenging his father's death at the hands of Spider-Man, and thus is determined to hunt him down and kill him.  When the very lives of his love ones are put in jepordy because of his newfound powers Peter is troubled with where to turn, and what to do.  Should he continue to fight the crime plaguing the streets or should he hang it up for good to protect those around him?

`Spider-Man 2' serves as top-notch entertainment, ready and willing to please any who watch it.  I really don't see a down side, and with `Spider-Man 3' on the horizon there is sure to be plenty more to praise and look forward to as another chapter is unfolded.  Here's to hoping Sam and company can keep this up!",1166659200,,1890,4.781538461538462
1501388,5,B00005JMQW,"The three pinnacle comic books films are Spider-Man 2, Batman Begins, and the first Superman movie.  Batman Begins and Spider-Man 2 have something in common; they have comic book fans making and writing the films.  If you're going to make a film about a comic book character, then you need someone who is familiar with the characters and the world they inhabit.  This is why so many of the comic book films today are not very good.

Al Gough and Miles Millar co-wrote the screenplay for this film.  They are the same ""dynamic duo"" who gave life and re-ignited the Superman mythology with Smallville.  As comic book fans, they obviously knew what they were doing when they penned this fantastic sequel that surpasses the original at almost every turn.

There is a reason why Spider-Man is Marvel's most popular character and the icon for it's company.  No one has the thumb on justice and doing what's right more than Superman, nor does any character surpass Batman for his psychological complexities. Spider-Man is the hero that everyone can relate to.  This is because Spider-Man is a hero with realistic problems that everyone has and goes through.  Despite his impressive array of abilities, Peter Parker has trouble attending classes at his university.  He can barely pay the rent each month.  There was once a scene in one of the comic book series, where Peter Parker has forgotten to do the laundry, and the only clean shirt he has to wear to work is a Strawberry Shortcake t-shirt that a co-worker at the Bugle had given him as a gag.  This is the life of Peter Parker.

The movie really hones in on Peter's character and his problems.  He gets fired from his job for always being late.  He's late to watch Mary Jane in her play.  He's back-logged on his paychecks because he's already asked for an advance at the Bugle.  He's on the verge of failing his courses at school.  How is he able to balance his life as Peter and Spider-Man?  This is the inner conflict that befalls him.  At one point, the load is such a burden, that he feels he can't be Spider-Man anymore.  And, yet again, the audience can relate to his character.  The movie works so well because it focuses on Peter Parker instead of Spider-Man.  Batman Begins works because it focuses on Bruce Wayne instead of Batman.  And Smallville is a hit show because it focuses Clark Kent.  Audiences now want and demand rich and interesting characters.  And Spider-Man 2 delivers big-time!

Tobey Maguire is wonderful as Peter Parker.  I confess that I had my reservations about him when I first heard that he was cast to play the part.  He mirrors Peter Parker from the comic book so well.  Part of that tribute has to go to director Sam Raimi who is one of the biggest Spider-Man fans around.  He still has a poster of Spider-Man in his bedroom from when he was a kid.  Tobey is able to humanize Peter to such an extent that we share his joy and his pain.  Tobey has also mastered the ability to communicate the feelings of Peter with a simple look.  Words aren't necessary.  We all know what he's feeling.

Spider-Man's new foe is Doctor Octopus.  He's wonderfully played by Alfred Molina.  Spider-Man has had many foes over the years, but during the 70s-80s, you can consider Doctor Octopus to be one of his best and most creative foes.  He is not as much a personal nemesis as the Green Goblin, but he has a great intelligence.  Molina give Doctor Octopus an almost sympathetic feel.  Given powers that are a bit similar to Peter's, Octopus obviously chooses a different path.

The special effects are much better in this film than the last.  We see Spider-Man swinging in between cars and trucks, fighting Doctor Octopus against the sides of buildings and battling Doctor Octopus on top of a subway train.

This DVD is fantastic with lots of great extras, including interviews with famous comic book artists about Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus, and the women of Spider-Man's world.

As a former comic book reader for nearly fifteen years, it's wonderful to see this fun character come to life on the big screen.  But, you don't need to be a comic book fan to enjoy it.  As I said, most everyone can relate to Spider-Man.",1165622400,,4187,4.63265306122449
1501389,5,B00005JMQW,"I felt that the sequel showed another side of Spiderman that the cartoon(1960's) or the tv series in the 1970's didn't show.  Peter Parker can't do it all such as being in love with Mary Jane, going to college, saving the world and holding down any job.  He has a special talent which makes his life miserable and you can read it in his expressions when things go wrong.  This is something we all have a problem with and the movie resolves his conflict by showing us and him that we can have it all.  It all about priorities and making it balance.

It is always impressive to see Spider-Man display his powers, and with modern special effects, we get to see him in all of his glory, as his creator Stan Lee had intended.  There is one particular part in this movie that brings a tear to my eye.  It is that powerful.  It is this one part where Spidey uses his powers to the max in order to save a trainload of people.  It is simply AWESOME.  The rest of the movie is good too, but that is my favorite part.  If you like comic books, action films, or both, I recommend this title to you.",1158451200,3,678,4.045112781954887
1501442,5,B00005JMQW,"I was hesitant to see Spider man 2 because the first one did not struck a cord with me. The first one is not bad, but it's like every other comic-book adaptation superhero movies out there: you know, cheesy villans, large reliance on 21 century CGI and actions. Basically makes you always come out of the theatre unsatisfied.

But Man, this time for some reason the writers decided to give us a superhero action movie with a PLOT!!! Imagine that!!! Instead of the usual comical superhero movie we've seen many times, Spider Man 2 was written into a drama. instead of the movie spent half of it on the villain and his evil plans and half the hero has to stop the villain. We have a movie that solely focuses on the main character and his struggles. the villian was as simple as a villain could be- a mad scientist turned into a monster and ended up almost destroying the city. At first look at Dr. Octopus, I thought the character was going to be even more ridiculous than the last one- the Green Goblin (which was one of the main reasons of my hesitancy to see this movie). But hey, he works. He's formidable enough for Spider man, faithful to the comic books. And we didn't have too much of irratation in watching his evil plan formations and how he became what he is, it was smooth enough to make us understand, and quick enough to sit through. The rest with him in it would be the breath-taking action.

Lots of times when the producers decided to make a sequal to a movie, they often made the movie more complicated than it has to be (X-men, pirates of the carribean anyone?). But Spider Man 2 was really a SEQUAL, it was a continuation of the first one, and more character-driven and in depth. It was brilliant in the way that it's understandable, it's simple, and it's something we could all connect.

The ""twist"" in the movie-in which Spider man was ""turned"" into just Peter Parker again, wasn't a twist so much as part of the story. This I find exhilarating. This twist is something we have seen in lots of other superhero movies, like in Superman 2. The difference is that instead of showing us all the negatives in being a human as to being a superhero which made the hero change his mind, this film showed us all the positives of being a human, that it was something burden stripping and something to be cherished upon. Peter Parker started to enjoy school, do his homework, and actually for once made it to his heartthrop-M.J's show. And the writer triumphed again in showing us, in that powerful fire-rescue sequence, that a human being be hero too, that just because we don't have superpowers doesn't mean we can't do good like superheros. But in the end my favorite twist- in which Peter saved ONE person but could not save another, his conscience stirred up in the way that he COULD do more but he didn't, and this started to change his mind. So instead of the hero being humiliated (like in Superman 2 Superman was badly beaten by a goon after turned human) and therefore recognized his vulnerability in not pocessing superpowers, Parker's mind was changed in recognizing his conscience in his choice-making. This brilliant scene not only sticked to the whole theme about CHOICE, but that superpowers, like intelligence, is a gift to be used for the good of mankind.

Spider man 2 was also a movie in which EVERYBODY can connect, simply because the main character was just so ordinary, in comparason to other superheros. He doesn't have financial back-up like batman, he isn't immensily tall or good-looking like Superman, he's not an undead or alien. In fact, he doesn't even have a stable job. Many times in other superhero action movies there are always things that make us scratch our heads like: oooookay, so where did you get the money to buy all that cool equipments?? Or, after all this time with the secret identity-the he's here, he's not thing wouldn't at least SOMEBODY start to suspect?? But in this film it was so realistic: how do you manage to be 24/7 superhero AND manage to keep your job going?- YOU DON'T. Parker was fired more than once in taking on this big responsibility. Even the Spider-man outfit was something ordinary- its colors dyed on other clothes in the washer, now that's REAL story-telling.

Of course one of the major highlights of Spider man 2 would be its humor. And the irony in humor using was just great. The lines were funny, Peter Parker was just pathetic in the you-want-to-give-him-a-big-hug kind of way. It was both funny and heart-braking

The cliffhanger in the end set up the third movie very well. Not only was it a happy-ending cliffhanger, but makes us anticipate lots of questions to be answered in terms of characters and character transformation: so now that Harry Osborn know the truth about his father, would he follow his father's footstep and become the next Green Goblin (God I hope not), or forgives Spider man in understanding? The last scene in which M.J watches Spider man going off with a look of concern on her face- what was she thinking? did she see something in Spider man that we did not? Why wasn't she happy in seeing Spiderman go off, especially since they just made up??? I can't wait for these questions to be answered in the third film

Finally I just want a big shout out to TOBY MAGUIRE!!!!! He was simply BRILLIANT throughout the whole film, KEEP IT UP TOBY!!!!

This film was 2 hours long and not a single second was wasted. This got to be the first sequal of a superhero film in which I was not the least unsatified, not only that, but made me want more. Please keep it on the same track for the third movie writers!!!!",1157328000,3,5616,4.564484126984127

1501445,4,B00005JMQW,"Spider-Man 2 is better than the original Spider-Man. I feel I should get that out of the way first, since most sequels have a tough time topping the first one. However, I feel Spider-Man 2 is only better in the sense that if the same production staff remade Spider-Man, it should naturally be better. That's what this sequel feels like, a literal remake with some spiced up elements here and there. It's a good film, but it's not really the way I thought a sequel should be.

Effects are even better than the first, and the tentacles of Doc Ock make for some truly spectacular battles, including a centerpiece on a runaway train. Tobey Maguire continues to give an excellent portrayal of Peter Parker, and has good chemistry with Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. Alfred Molina has more to work with as Doc Ock than Dafoe did as the Goblin, and humanizes what was once a wacky villain. James Franco continues to develop Harry Osborn well, and the supporting cast like JK Simmons and Rosemary Harris fill out the high-caliber acting.

But the script needs work. It uses one of the worst superhero cliches as the main plot, that of the hero calling it quits. It's never convincing, and the film drags as we wait for Peter to realize things we've known all along. Character relationships, though well-acted, don't seem to have progressed since the first movie. We're still treading the Peter/Mary Jane love triangle, just with a different third wheel. Harry still has his on/off friendship with Peter. There are nice plot twists that shake things up towards the end, but most of the film is wasted on the exact same angst from the first one. For a story supposedly set 3 years later, it might as well have been 3 days.

Peter Parker is becoming exuasted, saving the citizens of New York has finally taken its toll on the Web-Slinger. With the knowledge of Mary Jane moving on in her life professionally and in the aspects of being in love with the Web-head, is a major distraction in Peter's life. This tremendously clouds Parker's sense in being able to see two new rivals rise. One is an idol in Spidey's interest in science, and the other is an old friend who is reeling from the fact that Spider-man killed his father. In his quest to pursue his own desires, Parker's attention falls upon only one of these new villians in a city wide wave of destruction. The other nemesis remains waiting in the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike....

Once again, the talented Sam Rami directs this film; bringing the world of Spider-man alive to the big screen. He also remains true to the characters and the comics' storylines. The beautiful and talented Kirsten Dunst performs an amazing role as Mary Jane Watson and would make anyone in love with her, not want to let her go.

1501447,3,B00005JMQW,"I've never been a huge Spiderman fan, but I did enjoy the first movie.  The second time around I did still enjoy the movie but it did not seem to be as good as the first.  The problems are that the movie has way too much going on.  It's a bit to over stuffed.  There are 4 endings.  Also the movie shoves way too many moments where you are supposed to say ""awww poor Peter Parker"".  It's ridiculous.  His life somehow becomes perfect right when he gives up being a superhero.  That's not very realistic.  Also the movie suffers from way too many gags.  It's all just silly humor.  I would have liked the humor to be a little better than falling down in front of a bunch of people and drinking a drink that was already finished by someone else.  There are good moments too.  For one, the special effects are great, not that I expected them to be anything otherwise.  The story is coherent, (for the most part).  The action sequences are a bit cartoon-ish at times but still solid.  There is a nifty train sequence and an even better climatic battle at the end that the first movie.  One thing that I do not like is J Jonah Jameson the chief of the Daily Bugle.  He is way over the top cartoon-ish and the paper itself is more like the National Inquirer than a reputable newspaper.  Also if Peter does not want to sell him the pictures, there has to be another newspaper in New York.  But regardless, it's still a decent popcorn movie that most people will enjoy.",1151884800,,1461,4.301470588235294

1501518,4,B00005JMQW,"The first Spider-Man movie was so comprehensive, I thought that there would be nothing new to add in the sequel. I was right, HOWEVER, what the producers/writers/directors did do was expand on the elements planted in the original. The first movie centered on Peter Parker's new found powers. SPIDER-MAN 2 focuses on the conflict he has balancing those powers with his personal life. Tobey Maguire does an admirable job capturing that dilemna.

The nemesis this time is Doc Ock, played with enormous composure and then terrific high-handedness by Alfred Molina. The sleepy-eyed Kirsten Dunst returns to play M.J., the object of Parker's desire, whom he disappoints time and again. J.K. Simmons is the ultimate scene-stealer as the hot-headed, fast-talking J. Jonah Jameson.

There is action galore in SPIDER-MAN 2. There are also a lot of inaccuracies. There are no elevated subway lines in Manhattan, except way uptown. However, the train on which Spidey and Doc Ock battle it out, is filmed in Queens (even though the train's destination is clearly marked ""Bay Ridge"" which is in Brooklyn). Also, in one scene, with one swing of the web Spidey goes from mid-Manhattan to City Hall Park way downtown. There's no web big enough to do that. (All right, so I'm showing off. And nit-picking. Sue me.)

But this isn't what detracted the one star away from my rating. My problem with the film is the incredibly sl-o-o-o-w pacing in so many scenes. The talking between Peter and M.J., Peter and his aunt, Peter and the ghost of his uncle, etc., etc., just go on and on and on... It just kills whatever adrenaline that was produced by the action sequences. Even the comic scenes, which could have been so funny--Peter's confrontation with the snooty theater-doorman, the awkwardness of his elevator ride with the rich dog-walker, the mops and brooms that endlessly fall out of a closet in an early scene--drag on way too long. It's like someone telling you the same joke three times a day. These elements really mar the movie.

However, as pure mind candy, and for anyone who followed Spider-Man in the comic books, this is still worth seeing! Nuff sed.",1150675200,3,2145,4.900826446280992
1501519,2,B00005JMQW,"After reading some of the reviews for this movie I have to wonder, am I the only one who was really dissapointed with this movie?

After 2002's Spider-man, which in my mind was one of the greatest superhero movies created (Surpassed only by X-2 the year later) I was getting ready for the sequel. It had it all: the cast was back, Alfred Molina as Doc Ock seemed like a great casting decsion, and all the reviews were postive for spider-man 2. However as I watched the movie I couldn't help but feel the huge dissapointment. What baffles me is that so many people thought this was the best superhero movie of all time and I just can't see what's go good about it.

The story of course is Peter Parker having troubles between his regular life and the life of a superhero. When Spidy loses his powers he gives up beign Spider-man around the time that Doc Ock begins is terror. Now here's the problem. Kirsten Dunst is just horrible in this movie. I'm sorry, she was ok in the first film but in the sequel, scenes with her are just hard to watch. Then for a good part of the film we have to watch Peter Parker try and express his love for Mary Jane. After awhile the film just loses it's momentum and just dies. I'm not the guy who's saying there's no action in it and too much drama. Believe me, I'm all for more drama in superhero movies but it just takes up way too much of the film. Then Alfred Molina who is a convicing Doc Ock gets a little to much like a cartoon villian. It's also a little hard to believe that the wise cracking spider-man is really the dull Peter Parker, Toby Maguire is the perfect Peter Parker but because of the things Peter goes through in this film, he just becomes dull and boring after awhile. Then comes the ending of the film where Mary Jane gets captured...again. There's a thrilling action scene with Doc Ock and Spidy on a train but then after he saves the train, all the passengers find out who spider-man is. harry (James Franco saved what was left of this movie for me) finds out who he is and so does Mary Jane. The only gratfying part of the movie for me was Harry finding out who his dad really was and William Dafoe coming back for a quick cameo.

I don't know why everyone thought this film was great because to me it was a huge step down from the first film. I'm all for lots of personal character drama especially when it comes to Spider-man which the comics are filled with it, but at one point this movie just comes to a stop and was very dissapointing. I hope Rami gets it together for the third film but looking at the villians, the story, and some of the casting decsions including Sandman as the main villian and Topher Grace as Eddie Brock/Venom, I think I'll wait till that future summer flick comes out on DVD because it seems like it's just another big dissapointment.",1150588800,6,2823,4.312617702448211
1501520,5,B00005JMQW,"Batman & Robin, Daredevil, The Hulk... All of these are examples of how not to make a comic book hero movie. Of the real 'Big 3' heroes out there, Batman and Superman of DC comics have had their big budget movies and have met with mixed success. Spider Man and Marvel themselves though have really never got off the ground as far as the silver screen goes... Until X-Men

There's no denying that the success of the X-Men film and Marvel's documented financial difficulties are what allowed the studios to get their claws into these franchises and while Hulk and Daredevil may have been disappointments, Stan Lee was never going to let his flagship character suffer the same fate.

Spider Man 1 was, in my opinion, the best superhero movie I had seen. The character stuck to the comic books, with a few minor exceptions(the webbing being the one that really bent the fanatics noses out of joint). The temptation to cast a Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt in the role was held at bay and some relatively unknown supporting members proved to be great in the from of Osbourne Jnr and Jameson.

This was a sequel that had a lot to live up to... And boy did it deliver! Again, some of the origins were messed with, we all know Doc Ock was never a humanitarian or 'controlled' by his claws, he was evil of his own free will. Regardless, Molina was excellent as the villain, McGuire was still the dork he should have been and his wrestling with his alter ego really gave the movie the depth it needed.

What makes Spiderman 2 a great movie is, not just the action sequences, but the realistic and believable relationships between the characters, with the exception of Jameson who is a welcome dose of 'over the top'. Osbourne's hatred for spider man slowly poisoning his friendship with Parker, Parker's love for MJ which he is forced to hide and MJ's pained frustration at Parker's refusal to open up, all add to the action we expect of this sort of movie.

Then there is the action. Acrobatics, explosions, runaway trains, fights atop skyscrapers... This has them all. The set pieces are breathtaking and Spidey gets more than as good as he gets from Doctor Octopus. Molina may have been a less than orthodox action man, and the slight paunch evident at points supports that, but he pulled the role off magnificently.

In wrapping up this review all I can say is the Spider Man 3 has some big boots to fill as this was a film that deserved all the box office records it broke and the DVD has some extras that really make it stand out as well",1150329600,3,2526,4.504366812227074

1501522,5,B00005JMQW,"Perfect - just like, exactly like, and indistinguishable from the comic! Peter Parker, always striving to stay out of trouble, always late, never getting anyone's approval, self doubting, always dissatisfied with his life. A nerd, can't dress, living in a dump, the worst of luck (which I think he brings on himself when he doesn't believe in himself, esp since his cosmic spidey sense should correct for that). He doesn't have all the snide, quippy humor in costume he had in the comic, but given his stage in life and on screen it makes sense; I'll expect it in the next film.

Dr. Octopus, perfect. His look, his mannerisms, his portrayal, the tendrils, absolutely dead on. Could not have done any better if you had pulled him straight from the imagination of the child I was when I first discovered the comic.

Jonah Jameson, good lord, hysterically dead on. Impeccable.

This movie has completely restored my faith in hero/comic films. Granted, many of the Marvel films of late have been pretty good, but this one by far exemplifies the best of Marvel, the best of Spiderman. The scene after he saves the folks on the train, that is how heroes are thanked.

I bought this movie on a fluke, despite not having seen it in the theater, because it was on sale. It is now my favorite superhero film ever, outdoing both Xmen and the original Tobey Spiderman.

It is a synthesis of good acting, good sets, good CGI, good cinematography, good direction, perfect timing, and blends both light hearted sense of humor with seriousness and as well as both dreams & daily life. Excellent!!",1149206400,2,1581,4.734545454545454
1501523,5,B00005JMQW,"""Spiderman 2"" makes ""Spiderman"" seem like a warm-up.  Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and his alter-ego, Spiderman, have enough problems to make the movie continually interesting.  The melodrama envelops our attention, and the action scenes are marvelous.

In the beginning Peter Parker sets his sights on Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), but he's conflicted by his role as Spiderman.  He not only juggles his identities, but his responsibilities as well.  As college student and breadwinner, he stumbles with all of his relationships, including with his aunt and his best friend.  Ironically, this friend has connections with a scientist who can be the key to Peter's success.  When the scientist presents an innovative energy invention, his demonstration goes awry.  It turns the scientist into a monster, Dr. Oct., with barely a will of his own.

""Spiderman 2"" is a substantial movie because, unlike similar superhero movies, we remain interested and are often at the edge of our seats.  Frequently many hero figures vanquish their opponents too early or too often, but Spiderman has many problems and an incredible adversary.  In the story, the chemistry between Peter and Mary Jane is likable, and Dr. Oct. is certainly menacing enough.  The supporting roles are effective, too.  The portrayal of Peter's Aunt is endearing, and his newspaper editor boss provides an entertaining caricature.  His relationship with his friend provides good connections and variety to the plot.  Screenwriter Alvin Sargent (who won an Oscar for ""Ordinary People"") gives the screenplay the right touches, and director Sam Raimi is an expert for leading us along this great adventure.  ""Spiderman 2"" has the look and feel of a flawless comic book hero classic.",1149033600,,1742,5.28
1501524,4,B00005JMQW,"This movie blew my mind away. When I first heard that the villian was going to be Dr. Octopus, I was thoroughly disappointed, especially considering that many of the rumours involved Venom, Carnage, and some of Spider-Man's more colorful cast of villians. That being said, the way Dr. Octopus was portrayed was magnificient, especially the way with which Peter meets Dr. Octavius as a student at Columbia University. What drove this film (other than the terribly miscast Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson), was the notion that being a hero is as much a question of mental fortitude as it is a question of super-powers (although those help as well). Tobey Maguire makes the perfect Peter Parker, awkward yet affable. The opening scene where he tries to deliver pizzas before Sal's 30-minute guarantee expires, shows a full range of emotion - from excitement to pure disappointment at having lost yet another job. When Peter is released from his repsonsibilities as Spider-Man, a newfound joy enters his life and he is finally able to pursue without abandon both his studies and the girl next door - Mary Jane. I really can't say more positive things about this movie. I think I would have given it 4 stars if Kirsten Dunst was not in the movie, as well as if a better sense of Peter's homelife was provided.

1501559,5,B00005JMQW,"I used to read and enjoy comic books when I was a young boy. What a pleasant surprise to see such a fascinating adaptation of the comic book into a well made movie on the superhero, Spider-man. This is an excellent movie, well produced with fantastic special effects and an interesting story.

A shy and awkward school student, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is bitten by a genetically modified spider resulting in him acquiring special and unusual spider like abilities such as scaling walls and ceilings. He has superhuman strengths and agility as well as powers to sense approaching danger. Peter uses his special spider like abilities to fight evil and protect the common people.

Spiderman plays his role as the champion of ordinary folk exceptionally well. He is a kind and selfless person. His nemesis is the rich CEO who plays as the cruel and devilish Green Goblin (perfectly played by Willem Dafoe). The pretty Kirsten Dunst (as Mary Jane Watson) who is Parker's sweetheart also plays her role exceptionally well.

1501560,4,B00005JMQW,"From a one-time owner of Spider-Man #6 on, and someone who is not a fan of bombastic Hollywood mega-films, this is high praise - it's good. The emotional life of the characters, which is what always distinguished Marvel's best work from other comics, is ripened (even over-ripened) for the film. It's done with love and care, and except for young Harry (callow actor instead of the performance of a callow character) it's very well cast. I kept hoping Donna Murphy would be regenerated too, she's much too interesting to die so quickly. The shifting camera expands on the original artwork of Steve Ditko who thought in odd camera angles. Rosemary Harris is eerily like the Ditko Aunt May, and like Alec Guiness in ""Star Wars"" it's her fate now to be remembered for this instead of a lifetime of great stage work. Hopefully well paid. In the comic there was usually some rather bitter comic moment to break the pathos and the opening section could use one, as Peter begins to take on Job or Christ dimensions of burden, but the tone is just right otherwise. There is a strange quality of several sequences filmed and played is if they were dreams (the child lifting Peter in the fire) without explanation, but the consistancy of it becomes the style. For an adult movie-goer, this genre from Hollywood is never going to be any better. Which is high praise and criticism at once. This fan suggests the Sandman would make for spectacular effects in another sequel; too bad Joseph Cotton isn't around to play him (Ditko's drawing resembled a squared off version of the 40s star).",1142121600,,1575,4.7309090909090905

1501563,5,B00005JMQW,"""Spider-Man 2"" is the best comic book superhero movie made to date, and not simply by default. The story and screenplay come from Alfred Gough and Miles Millar (co-creators of ""Smallville""), Michael Chabon (author of ""Wonder Boys""), and Alvin Sargent (Oscar winner for ""Julia"" and ""Ordinary People""), and more than any other film in this genre it is true to the character and what made him Marvel Comics' most popular superhero in the 1960s. I teach a unit on Spider-Man in my Pop Culture class where we compare the original Stan Lee & Steve Ditko stories to what is being published today and my students have to deal with the key elements of the comic book. This time around Sam Raimi has those elements nailed big time.

The story picks up two years after the first film, which is reprised through artwork by Alex Ross during the title sequences. Peter (Tobey Maguire) is now in college, working a part time job, fighting crime, and generally making a mess of everything. Being Spider-Man is a burden and it is beating Peter Parker down. He loses his job, his grades are slipping, and even his powers seem to be leaving him. He still loves Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), but all he can envision is a life where his enemies would threaten her life and he has to endure seeing her picture on billboards and posters all over New York City. It becomes clear that our hero is coming to a cross-roads in his life, but we have no idea what will be the final straw, as it could be anything from the bank foreclosing on the house of Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) or Dr. Curt Connors (Dylan Baker) flunking him to J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) really firing him from the ""Daily Bugle"" to Mary Jane ending up with some other guy (Daniel Gillies).

What made Spider-Man endearing was that he was the victim of such bad luck. With power comes great responsibility but you would think a guy could catch a break now and then. There is a point where a bruised Peter tries to make his way home and as he reaches out to steady himself against a parked car you KNOW that as soon as he touches it a car alarm goes off. Spider-Man endures a lot of slings and arrows in this film (e.g., Aunt May never told him how to do laundry) and all the while the gods just look down and laugh.

The Green Goblin was something of the ultimate villain for Spider-Man because he was the one who learned the web-slinger's secret identity. But the consensus of my students each semester is that Doctor Octopus is the best Spider-Man villain. Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) intends to make nuclear fusion work and is employed by Harry Osborn (James Franco), who dreams of making a fortune during the day and of killing Spider-Man to avenge his father at night. Of course things go horribly wrong, and the four metal tentacles that Octavius has created are now fused to his body and have driven him insane.

We have all seen the trailer for ""Spider-Man 2"" and the scene where Doc Ock interupts a potentially tender moment between Peter and Mary Jane by throwing a car through a window at them. This must happen over an hour into the film but it starts off a series of fantastic computer generated fights between the hero and the villain. The reason for this and why the pairing is so perfect is that Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus can both fight on the vertical axis as well as the horizontal. These two go at each other on the side of buildings and falling through the air as well as on top, on the sides, and through the middle of a subway train. Then you throw into the mix that Doc Ock can be carrying off someone Peter loves and still have three mechanical arms pounding away at Spider-Man. More importantly, when Spider-Man travels around by his webbing in this film it no longer looks like something we would expect from a Saturday morning cartoon.

But the conflict between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus is only one of a half dozen that provide the interpersonal web of problems closing in on Peter and the way they all fit together gives ""Spider-Man 2"" a weight hitherto unsuspected in superhero movies. This point is best evidence by the fact that Aunt May is major supporting character in the film just as she is in the comic book. There were always two women in Peter Parker's life and the one constant was always Aunt May.

I applaud the decision to make Otto Octavius a good man for once who becomes the victim of his own brilliance. His scientific discussions with Peter in their first meeting not only show his decency but also reveal to our hero the path he can take if he pursues science rather than crime fighting. After all, Otto is married to the lovely Rosalie (Donna Murphy), who is clearly the doctor's own MJ. Eventually Peter comes to the realization that he does not have to be Spider-Man.

I have some ambivalence about what is happening with Mary Jane, mainly because one of my favorite scenes in the comic book was when she finally confessed to a stunned Peter that she knew he was Spider-Man and could no longer stand the fear that he was going to get killed. But I appreciate the idea that Mary Jane gets to be there from the beginning in the movies (as she is in Marvel's ""Ultimate Spider-Man"") and that Hollywood does not have time to go through Betty Brant and Gwen Stacy to get to Mary Jane Watson Parker and the final shot of Mary Jane in the film certainly gives weight to her character and reinforces again the idea that this time they got everything right.",1140652800,,5462,4.505549949545913

1501565,2,B00005JMQW,"I like comic books.  I like superheroes.  And after hearing everyone talk about how this is one of the best superhero movies around, I figured I'd give it a shot though the first Spidey film didn't impress me much.

Well, this is a pretty bad movie.  Scratch that.  It's not bad.  It's just not very good.  And it's damn annoying.  If this is what people think makes a good comic book movie (including people who read comics) then I guess I must read them for different reasons.

To begin with, I only liked one character in the whole film.  Doctor Octopus as portrayed by Alfred Molina was an exceptional character, alternately likable, sinister, and tragic.  As for the rest of these whiny narcissistic babies, all I can say is yuck.  Toby Macguirer's portrayal of Peter Parker is a complete and utter loser who has no self-esteem, common sense, or personality.  He just mopes.  MJ is just as bad, being a terrible friend who is primarily concerned with herself.  And Norman Osbourne is willing to put his friends' lives and the whole city in danger in his obsessive desire to kill Spider-Man.  J. Jonah Jamesone comes across as a walking cartoon.

I also just didn't care for the story.  Of course, Peter Parker would have no life if he went chasing after every siren he heard.  NEWSFLASH:  Maybe it's just a speeder, Spidey.  The cops can handle some stuff without you.  Also, a ""Life of Responsibility"" doesn't mean giving up your own life.  Cops, soldiers, and firemen seem to do okay on that end.  And the notions of love explored in the film are childish and just plain silly.

Spidey in the comics was never this immature.  Please, do not judge all comics by this rather silly film.

On the plus side, I did really like the action sequences.  Much better than the short and unremarkable moments in Spider Man 1.  Otherwise, an unexceptional, often annoying film.",1138406400,7,1871,4.653374233128834
1501631,3,B00005JMQW,"Poor Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire)!  As if being an unappreciated superhero in New York isn't enough, he's too skint to pay his rent, his life long sweetheart MJ (Kirsten Dunst) is betrothed to a national hero, Aunt May's (Rosemary Harris) house is about to be repossessed by the bank and his best friend Norman (James Franco) is consumed with hatred of Spiderman who killed his dad.  What's more, there's a new super villain Dr Ock (Alfred Molina) on the loose.  Maybe this superhero lark isn't all it's cracked up to be and it's time to grow up.  Or maybe being a hero means more than just rounding up baddies, leaping between buildings and wearing a cool costume?

This second installment of Spiderman's adventures is unusually sophisticated for the costume superhero genre.  Writer Alvin Sargent assails our hero with numerous mundane and profound problems, and reflects his situation in the subplots.  He's also been allowed to move the story along a couple of years and to avoid revisiting ground covered in the first film.  A little extra care with the science would have helped avoid some annoying statements (for example, Dr Ock's fusion device generates one thousand megawatts of power without immediately incinerating everyone in the room).

Director Sam Raimi keeps a tight grip on the story and the tone light.  He pokes gentle fun at the essential silliness of the genre (the lift scene is hilarious) and doesn't let the special effects overwhelm the most down to earth superhero in the world.

The cast look as if the characters in the comics have come to life, especially the editor of the Daily Bugle, J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons) with his flat top haircut and overbearing behaviour.  The leads, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, are starting to look a bit too old as college kids in their first jobs.  There's a cameo appearance of Sam Raimi's buddy Bruce Campbell as the snooty theatre door attendant.

1501632,5,B00005JMQW,"Better than the original. I'm sure plenty of people will hear that when they hear people talk about this movie, and what can I say except that it's true. Yes, that's right expect numbers to be divisible by zero, mass to exceed the speed of light, objects to fall faster than 9.8 m/s^2, and Wile E. Coyote to remain in the air even after he has looked down, because a sequel has bested the original. Spiderman 2 has joined that rare pantheon of films that are actually better than the original: Terminator 2, The Empire Strikes Back, and Dawn of the Dead to name a few (and the last one's stretching it).

At the heart of this movie is an actor who has really grown into his own and taken America's heart by storm. He's always been talented, but this is the movie that has really catapulted him to superstardom. That's right, Alfred Molina, you had me at ""Throw me the idol, I throw you the whip."" Seriously though, Alfred Molina has been in every movie ever, and I didn't even know it until I saw this movie last year. He must have a bet going with Jude Law to see who can be in more films. Of course, he does a fine job in this film, and must be a really good actor because I didn't recognize I had seen him previously in about fifty movies, he just blends into the character.

Everyone does an excellent job in this film (except for Kirstin Dunst. Now that we know Topher Grace is going to be in the next film can't he bring over the redhaired chick from That 70's Show to play Mary Jane). Actors are often reiterating that comedy is the hardest thing to do (although it doesn't seem like the Academy is ever listening to them), and in Spiderman 2 they not only need to master comedy but make believable drama in the midst of complete fantasy. This change of gears isn't an easy thing to do I'm sure. At one pivotal point in the film Peter Parker has to confess to his aunt that he was responsible for her husband's death, and later in the film there is a montage that can only be described as an homage to sixties television. Tobe Maguire is able to play these extremes confidently and sells us the character in both scenes.

The biggest strength of this film is that Sam Raimi is able to mesh together so many genres without it seeming jarring. During the course of the film it takes on the characteristics of a drama, comedy, romance, horror, action-adventure, cartoon, monster movie, and none feels forced or out of place. Most of these genres aren't subservient to the others either. It could just as easily be argued that this film is a comedy as it could be argued that it is it is a drama or action-adventure. I have rarely seen this even a mixture of genre without the film itself feeling uneven.

Speaking of comedy, that is the single biggest advance between this film and the last. In the original Spiderman they just expected us to accept the cheesy one-liners as camp. This was fine for those who had read old comics before and were in on the gag, but those who hadn't just thought it was corny. The aforementioned montage to Rain Drops Keep Falling on My Head is perhaps the biggest risk the film takes, but the film makers are so confident that it works perfectly. It is easily the funniest part of the film.

What makes the Spiderman films in general so great is that Sam Raimi really believes that these characters have depth. In fact, I don't think I've seen two films since this movie came out, coming from a major Hollywood studio, with characters as developed as these are. Sam Raimi is not afraid to put real people in the middle of what can be essentially a big cartoon. This is only fitting because that was the exact characteristic that made Stan Lee such a genius. In Raimi, Stan Lee has someone who truly understands his creation.

There are some wonderful scenes in here (besides the montage, which I decided I might as well mention a third time), but if you haven't seen the movie I'll just let you discover them for yourself. It really is the kind of movie you hope they make every summer, but are usually disappointed by. Great movie.",1137196800,,4068,4.410119840213049
1501633,2,B00005JMQW,"I liked the first movie. It was generally Hollywood fluff, but was interesting enough that I could suspend my disbelief to the point I found it enjoying. An acquaintance of mine recently raved about the sequel and between that and the reviews here I was very anxious to see it when my colleague mentioned she had just bought it. Imagine my surprise when I caught myself watching the clock, rolling my eyes and eventually contemplating shutting off the machine during several points in the film.

Kirsten Dunst lost whatever acting ability she had shortly after Interview with a Vampire. She doesn't seem to have the range or depth to portray the complexities of the relationship between M.J. and Parker. Macguire, I guess, plays a sadsack to a tee - but I don't think I've ever seen him play anything else.

In this case however the DVD comes with two high quality booklets, one is a comic book reprint and one that (if it were in bigger scale) would pass as a first class 'Art of Spiderman 2' book. On the left they composited a few preproduction shots and sketches and on the right you get the corresponding scene in the movie (why can't the 'Art of Star Wars' books be like this...???).

1501636,3,B00005JMQW,"I heard many mixed reviews about this movie so I put off buying it for quite some time.  After having watched it I felt it was definitely lacking many of the characteristics that made the first movie appealing.  The two main themes in this movie are Peter Parker having trouble with his powers failing and the new super-villain Doctor Octopus.

Now Doc Oc was never one of my favorites but this revamping is even worse.  Pains have been taken to show Doctor Octavius as a truly good man.  Artificial intelligence has been added to his arms and an inhibitor chip to keep them under control.  But after the accident with the completely unshielded reaction the Doc falls victim to the arms.  I have to say that when one of the arms told him to rob a bank I had to wonder why he had ever programmed the arms with such knowledge.  Spider-Man has his arms full trying to stop him before the movie ends.

We also have scenes of Spider-Man having trouble with his powers.  Sometimes his webs won't work and he loses strength and web-crawling abilities off and on.  But the thing that really got me was the way he pulled off his mask at every stumbling block.  By the end of the film one has to surmise that half of the city has had the chance to see who he really is.  Peter seemed completely unconcerned with protecting his identity.

Mary Jane, Harry, Jonas and Aunt Mae all make their appearances and have their roles to fill with Peter bouncing around uncontrolled from one situation to another.  All in all it was a disappointing film and far below the standard set by the first.",1132099200,4,1576,4.461538461538462

1501673,4,B00005JMQW,"After all the hype, I went to see this movie with very high expectations. With sights that high, it's tough to come out of the theatre completely statisfied. This movie came close to my expectations, but not quite. On the positives: Great story, great casting, fantastic special effects, great villian, good acting, no foul language, no nudity, and some great action sequences. As for the negative, there are a few flaws that annoyed me.

Okay, what is the deal? Why is is that every director, that makes a superhero movie, thinks that the audience wants to see him unmasked to everybody. Every stinking superhero movie made now has the hero unmasking himself(Batman, Superman, Spider Man, Daredevil, etc). WHy? The secret identity exists for a reason. In the comics, these characters take great care in protecting their identity. Not so in the movies. In these flicks, the hero's are all too happy to allow themselves to be unmasked to everyone. It's really stupid. This movie is no different. Peter Parker reveals himself to just about everyone: Mary Jane, Doc Ock, Harry Osbourne, and a train car full of people. It makes no sense that he's worried about protecting his loved ones(like Mary Jane) from his enemies, but then reveals himself to everyone. The only other probelm I had with this film is that some scenes were just silly and drawn out and could have been omitted without affecting the story. For instance, way too much time is spent dealing with Peter's landlord. We get the idea that he's behind on his rent, so why do we need to see 10 - 15 minutes of it? I'd say about 30 minutes of storyline could have been taken out and not affected the quality of this movie.

In conclusion, this movie is still top notch and I recommend it too all. The flaws are minor enough to be overlooked.",1131062400,,1799,4.689873417721519
1501674,5,B00005JMQW,"""Spider-Man 2"" finds Peter Parker about 2 years after the first ""Spider-Man"" film, but in much the same predicament we left him in. Peter (Tobey Maguire) is finding it impossible to balance making a living, attending college, and being a superhero. There is no time at all for Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), and it looks as if Peter has lost her for good. With both his superpowers and his stamina for the leading a double life diminishing, Peter is frustrated and conflicted. His boyhood friend Harry Osborn (James Franco), now head of Oscorp, is determined to avenge the death of his father, for which he believes Spider-Man was responsible. In the meantime, Harry has high hopes for the invention of Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), a scientist whose fusion machine promises to be a perpetual source of cheap energy for the world and a great success for Oscorp. But, when a demonstration of the fusion machine goes awry, Dr. Octavius is transformed into Doctor Octopus, a man-machine hybrid who goes on a rampage to finance rebuilding his dreams.

""Spider-Man 2"" and ""Spider-Man"" are consistent in style and tone, thanks to Sam Raimi's repeat directorial effort. ""Spider-Man 2"" is spared the necessity of introducing characters and providing backstory, so this film is more evenly paced and cohesive than ""Spider-Man"". It's more angsty, too. Peter Parker's internal struggles seem endless in this film, but, in retrospect, ""Spider-Man 2"" may simply be the ""conflicted"" chapter of the saga. We will have to see if ""Spider-Man 3"" brings a new theme. It has become obvious that Peter cannot balance his two lives, so the idea of choice and self-sacrifice becomes dominant in ""Spider-Man 2"". J.K. Simmons returns as J. Jonah Jameson, Peter's overbearing, unscrupulous boss at the tabloid where he works. Simmon's bluster is pure fun to watch and one of the most enjoyable details of the Spider-Man films. ""Spider-Man 2"" is a big, bold comic book adaptation that overcomes its own silliness with great looks, action, and fun. A good time for all.",1130803200,,2042,5.0058823529411764
1501675,4,B00005JMQW,"I have to admit that I thought the storyline centered too much on the ""M.J. aspect"" of Peter Parker's life. But then, Spiderman has always been one superhero a little more preoccupied by the women in his life than most. I will give a little on that front, even though I believe that most movies with a hero grappling with world-wide (or galaxy-wide) consequences end up putting a little more romance than neccessary into the story.

  My main beef with all superhero flicks is this: A strength of the hero in one instance will be forgotten or overcome a few minutes or scenes later into the movie. I don't want to give anything about the movie away. I won't give examples that spoil the story or plot, but I am a very critical eye when it comes to superhero strengths. I catalogue them. I see that a superhero can perform a certain feat, and remember it!

  For an example, I'll use Superman 2. When Superman meets Jor-el's nemesis General Zog, he employs a few tricks that you never get to see him use again, and they would really help him keep his untouchable image. He can disappear and reappear in three or four places, and he can ""zap"" with his hand. There are very many points in the sequels where these powers would make things easier for him.

  Not to make this about Superman, but I won't mention any part of Spiderman 2 for fear of ruining the surprise. Suffice to say that it seems that spidey has an advantage in some parts of the flick that evaporates into weakness. You can make a great movie that has everything in line, but if I notice a small inconsistancy like that, forget about it. I'll still love the movie, but my tongue will be bleeding heavily from my bite.

  Conclusion: Great movie! I own it without regret, but will always pick it and any other movie with that sort of inconsistency.",1130457600,,1812,4.457575757575758
1501676,5,B00005JMQW,"I have a confession to make: I hated the first Spider-Man.

I despised it, loathed it all the more for having anticipated it so much. For a big-budget superhero flick I thought it looked astonishly cheap; it was poisonously saccharine-sweet, and the spectacle of the two masked super-adversaries---Green Goblin and Spider-Man---taunting each other without being able to see their mouths---was ridiculous.

So I came into Spider-Man 2 with a mix of dread and boredom.

Faced!

I can report that Spider-Man 2 is not only a deleriously enjoyable film in its own right, but it is that rarest of sequels: the sequel that makes its predecessor better by virtue of its sheer existence.

The best thing about this Spidery successor is it feels shot like a horror flick: this is, after all, Sam Raimi, the abrasive, hyperkinetic, revolutionary young director who had conjured up the unabashedly gory and improbably funny ""Evil Dead"" movies. Spider-Man 2 succeeds in large part because of the camera-work, which delivers because it mimics the movements of the hero and villain , whether we're webbing through the Manhattan canyons with Spidey or lumbering up the side of a skyscraper with the brilliantly evil---albeit enslaved---Doctor ""Octopus"" (played to fleshy perfection by the underrated Al Molina).

Tobey McGuire has toned it down in this installment: he's more relaxed, more comfortable with the role even as his stymied superhero is becoming less comfortable with his powers. James Franco (Osborn Jr.) flexes some acting chops with his parsed, but critical role; Kirsten Dunst is amiably bland, as always; and of the wildly overracting JK Simmons (J. Jonah Jameson) the less said, the better.

But the real jewel in Spidey's crown is its villain: Spider-Man has found a worthy foe, and the flick its lodestone, in the tormented and complicated Dr. Octavius, played to perfection by Molina. Molina gives this second outting its gravity, tragedy, and (no pun intended) heft---props as well to the FX crew on the tentacles, each of which bristle with menace.

And that's another place where Spider-Man 2 shines: its judicious, effective use of CGI. For a blockbuster, SM2 made use of many traditional effects, eschewing CGI unless the scene was literally impossible to creature with stunts, sets, and props. That realism gives the film a gritty heft, a raw physicality, missing from other CGI-larded blockbusters, and it redounds to Raimi's credit.

One slight complaint and a general note to Hollywood: stop killing off a supervillains every single flick---these guys are good for at least another picture, especially Doc Ock! Besides, a lower supervillain bodycount means less money spent on brainstorming new sequel stuff, and surely that can't be bad for business.

1501679,4,B00005JMQW,"This is another fine addition to the saga of Peter Parker.  Additions tend to underperform when the sequels are an afterthought.  The previous film felt like a complete story, but it seemed to leave open the story for this film.  After watching this film, the viewer knows (especially if the viewer is a fan of the story already) that there are many stories still to come.

The story again touches on the theme of responsibility.  Peter is still struggling to accept that he has to sacrifice the things he wants because of the responsibility that comes with his superpowers.  He wants a normal life and wants the proverbial girl, but he must stand between the bad guys and the people of New York City.  Alfred Molina, in a great turn as Doctor Octopus, gives Peter a lesson and example in accepting responsibility.

The writers have left several hints of future stories.  First, we see J. Jonah Jameson's son the astronaut.  Second, we see Dr. Connors teaching one of Peter Parker's classes.  For a comics fan, I can't wait to see the movie versions of these characters in the future.

The film's focus is on Peter Parker's coming to grips with his responsibility and does not show as much of Doctor Octopus as I may have liked, but this is still a fine story.  I would recommend seeing this movie.",1127347200,3,1298,4.615720524017467
1501680,4,B00005JMQW,"""Spider-Man 2"" continues the story from ""Spider-Man"" naturally. This time, ""Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man"" (Toby Maguire) faces one of his deadliest enemies Doctor Octopus, played brilliantly by Alfred Molina.
The special effects are mind blowing. Rather than just witnessing the fights like in the first movie, you actually get to see what it is like to be Spider-man traveling along the skylines of New York City. And the fight scenes are as if they are ripped out of the comic panles.
the plot will seem to be the same as ""Superman II"" to non comic book fans. In ""Superman II"", Superman gives up his powers to be with the woman he loves, and villians comes to town and Superman must get his powers to save the day. in ""Spider-Man 2"", Peter parker looses his powers and starts to get a meaningful relationship with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)and Doc Oc comes to town, and Peter gets his powers back in order to save the day.
Overall, it is a good movie to watch pop corn with. It has great action, drama, and even comedy in it as well. Sam Rami did a grerat job with this film, and be sure to find Sam Rami movie staple, and ""greatest B movie actor ever"", Bruce Campell.

Some extras on the DVD are very good. It has a making of documentary (very good), all the history of Spider-man/ Peter Parker's love interests(boring), and the history of the main villian Doctor Octopus(interesting). A neat option on the first disk is pop up factoids that let you know little tid bits about the movie (enhances viewing experiances).

It was pretty neat that Sam Raimi brought the EXACT SAME characters as the first one such as JK Simmons, James Franco, Rosemary Harris, and also there was that small appearance of The Green Goblin at nearly the end of this movie. This is a good movie. And it's about where Peter Parker (Tobey MacGuire) has a few difficulties, first he got fired from his job at the Pizza Place for being late and he goes to college. He's late then too. But also he doesn't pay the rent as of his apartment. But the main part, Harry Osbourn (James Franco) takes him to meet his friend Dr. Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina). Also known as 'Dock Ock' or Doctor Octopus. Because Peter is writing a paper on Octavious. Then the next day, Harry takes Peter to see Dr. Octavious and his creation of the tentacles but there is a bad malfunction along the way that destroys Octavious' plans and makes Harry mad. He's even more mad when he sees Spider-Man after saving Harry's life. Then his wife Rosie gets killed after a piece of glass goes into her eyes. Now Octavious is thinking about the stuff that went wrong and if he's going to drown the destroying tentacles down the river, Octavious is going to have to go with the tentacles. So now, he decides to be a villian wrecking the city and being mean. But then later on, Peter goes to his friend Mary Jane's play but has to catch a couple of villians. This causes him to be a little late and the Snooty Usher (Bruce Campbell) doesn't let him in. And then MJ wants to go out with a new boyfriend who works for NASA, John. And then Harry still is mad about what happened with Octavious and the malfunction. And gets more mad at Peter and keeps on questioning him about Spider-Man. So Peter decides ""He's Spider-Man No More."" So he acts like a regular guy. But MJ still doesn't want to go out with Peter. And stuff comes worst after Octavious destroys half the city. And later on, after he asks Harry for more tritium, the most dangerous thing on earth that destroys stuff, Harry gives it to him under one condition. If Octavious brings Harry Spider-Man, he'll give Octavious all the tritium he wants. Next J Jonah Jameson (JK Simmons) feels sorry about taking Spider-Man away. So then Peter Parker returns as ""SPIDER MAN!"" And then Octavious and Parker fight on the subway. And all the people on the subway care for him and say ""It's good to have him back."" But after one punch from Octavious' tentacle, Otto takes Spider-Man to Harry. This is one of the moments from Spider-Man that we've all been waiting for. Harry reveals who's under the mask. And it showed PETER! I thought Harry was going to beat him up but Harry was surprised. And Harry tells Peter where Octavious is and now Spider-Man goes to save the city and capture Octavious and save MJ. Soon he says a little Phsycology to Octavious. And Octavious decides he should do the right thing. Drown the tentacles and himself. Then the next day, during the wedding of Mary Jane's MJ changes her mind and doesn't want to marry John.

But after all, even a spider-man fan such as myself doesn't go to see these films for the intricate plot so let's talk about the visuals: all right there are some great sequences like the vertical and free fall fighting but all the rest is unbearable to watch:tobey maguire is just useless, and what is up with the CG shots?

1501756,5,B00005JMQW,"Okay I LOVE Spider-Man II for so many reasons it would be impossible to truly list them here in a review. However, I am a die-hard, old time Spidey fan, and have been collecting Spider-Man comics for most of my life, on and off. As such, the poetic license taken by Sam Raimi sometimes mystifies me.

For instance, in the movie ""reality"" Spidey has organic webbing created by his body. Peter Parker was also bitten by a genetically engineered spider. In the Comics, Pete makes his webshooters and created cartridges filled with web fluid that snap into the web shooters. This NATURALLY created a very cool predicament, as sometimes Spidey runs out of web fluid at some of the most inopportune times. It was a cool plotline to see him have to battle his way through a shortage of webbing.

Also, and this is a bit nitpicky, Peter Parker was bitten by a radioactive Spider, NOT a genetically enhanced Spider. One of the common prevailing themes of Spider-Man has ALWAYS been that Spidey has ""Radioactive blood"" not some wacky genetic mutation from a mutated spider. I just don't see the so called ""reality"" of science inbreeding a bunch of spiders and then somehow one of these genetically enhanced spiders gives a person superhuman powers with a bite. That's like saying that if you eat nectarines you will somehow be endowed with the powers of the two cross-bred fruits! Radioactive blood just makes SO MUCH more sense to me.

Another problem I have is that the villains (Doc Ock and Green Goblin) are so far away from the comic book villains, that they really are a stretch.

Another issue I have is a minor one, but one that bothers me nonetheless. Peter Parker, in the first movie, as he conveys the story to Aunt May, gets revenge on the fight promoter who cheated him. The PROBLEM with this line of the story is that it is BOGUS and in my mind DOES NOT illustrate the common theme of ""with great power comes great responsibility"". Why? Well because the promoter deserved to get robbed in the movie, and any sane person would be GLAD that he was robbed. Whereas in the Comic, the reason Spidey didn't save the day was because he was too cocky and self absorbed and couldn't bother to stop counting his winnings to stop the thief who later killed Uncle Ben. To me, this is a far more powerful theme, because the IMMENSE guilt of his uncle's murder is compounded horribly by Spidey's complete lack of concern for his fellow man, and this serves to be the launching point of a crime fighting career that borders on obsessive. Truth be told, in the Movie reality, the fight promoter DESERVED to get robbed, and even though Peter's not acting directly causes his Uncle's death, the fact that the promoter cheated him, in my mind, gives a certain justification for his not giving a rat's behind about the promoter being robbed!

Now all of these things I can excuse, and I do excuse, with the caveat that the movie has a different ""reality"" than the comics, but I have to confess that these wild and sometimes un-necessary deviations from Old School Spidey, are a source of at least minor annoyance to me.

There is however ONE problem I have that I am having an increasingly difficult time overlooking and excusing. The problem is Mary Jane. okay, let me first say that I have nothing against Kirsten Dunsts and I also believe that she is a fantastic actress who did the very best that she possibly could in this role. however, the huge issue I have with the MJ of the movies is that she is NOT ""the girl next door""! Not by a long shot. Nope. The Mary Jane of the comics looks more like a voluptuous, curvy, hard-bodied Playboy Playmate! She was an absolute hotty, gorgeous, cocky and just a little bit slutty. She was a hot party girl, later on a model, NOT some goody-two-shoes actress! As much as I like Kirsten Dunst, through no fault of her own, she completely nauseates me as MJ. Because she, quite simply, is NOT MJ. They should have used Pam Anderson before the breast reduction, dyed her hair red and given her acting lessons! Well okay, maybe not, but I think you get the point here.

One more problem I have with BOTH movies is that there us just NOT enough of a demarcation between the Peter Parker persona and the Spider-Man persona! one of the most fabulous things about the comic book is that Peter Parker is kind of a tool! He is s nerdy, geeky science student. HOWEVER, when he dons the Spidey costume, he is transformed into a cocky, sometimes even arrogant superhero who ALWAYS has a funny comment, which serves both to entertain the reader and to throw off his opponent's concentration. The problem in both movies is that Spidey and Peter are TOO MUCH alike, and there is just not a clear cut demarcation of where Spider-Man begins and Peter Parker ends, and visa versa. There are not nearly enough wise-cracks, and very often, Spidey comes off as just as much of a tool in the movies as Peter Parker, particularly the crap about him losing his powers due to psychological issues. just bizarre!

Anyway, with all of those issues you may be scratching your head wondering why I am giving the movie 5 stars? Well the reason is because I am rating the movie as a ""stand alone"" entity, or more accurately, as the sequel to a stand alone entity. Meaning that I am rating the movie in terms of pure story, action, acting, special effects and the ""feeling"" of it. In order to rate this movie, and dare say, in order to even ENJOY this movie, I have to SUSPEND everything I already know about the Spider-Man I grew up with, and pretend that he never existed. On that basis, the movie is absolutely fantastic.

However, if I was rating the movie with the bias of a Spider-Man fan who grew up with the hero, I would probably have to give the movie 2.5 stars for the un-necessary bastardization of the characters and the whole Spider-Man Universe.

So, that said, the reason the movie gets 5 stars is as follows:

The acting is top notch, superb! Regardless of the fact that I personally disliked a lot of the direction that Raimi and the writers went with the movie, everyone did their job to the utmost levels of professionalism, skill and style. Regardless of how I felt about Dunst as MJ, her acting and presence were impeccable. The directing is also top notch and the special effects are startlingly realistic. I really felt Spidey swinging from building to building, and the fight scenes between Spider-Man and Doc Ock were miles ahead of the ones between the Green Goblin and Spider-Man in the first movie.

The story was engrossing and riveting and you really felt a profound empathy with the plight of a teenager given superpowers and the trainwreck that his life turns into because of this so called ""gift"". That much the movies REALLY captured very well from the comic books, and even made it seem more real on the screen.

Again, let me just say that as a stand alone movie series, that both Spider-Man I and II are FANTASTIC, couldn't be better. They went from very funny to heart-wrenchingly touching without missing a beat. The action was heart pounding and had me literally on the edge of my seat.

So, by completely divorcing myself from literally EVERYTHING I know about Spider-Man, and pretending the comics never existed, the movie is virtually flawless. However, as an old time Spidey fan, if I force myself NOT TO suspend that particular disbelief, then I have to confess disappointment in the movie for not following more traditional Spidey lore.

Oh and one more thing. I completely understand why Raimi went in this direction for many (but not all) of the plot deviations from comic book Spidey, and I confess that I agree with most of them. I guess it is just the trade-off of having only 2 hours and not several decades to unfold a story.

I hope my review wasn't too confusing. ;)",1125446400,,7817,4.584824624194703
1501757,5,B00005JMQW,"There is a fine line when creating a movie based on a comic book character between satisfying the comics' diehard fans, as well as satisfying the casual movie fan who might not be a fan of the comic in question. Director Sam Raimi has accomplished both in ""Spiderman 2"".

Long-time, diehard fans of Spiderman (like myself) should be very satisfied with some of the classic Spiderman storylines brought to the big screen in this latest cinematic episode. Grading on a comics curve, the acting is also top notch.

The chemistry between Tobey Maguire (""Peter Parker/Spiderman"") and Kirsten Dunst (""Mary Jane Watson"") is top-shelf, and I felt even better than the first movie. They do a fine job at recreating the tormented romance the characters experienced in the comics.

Alfred Molina absolutely delivers as Otto Octavius, a brilliant scientist who falls victim to a horrible accident involving his own creation, giving birth to the maniacal Doctor Octopus.

I've always regarded the fight scene above Metropolis from ""Superman II"" as the measuring stick for comic movie fight scenes. However, the fight scenes between Spiderman and Doctor Octopus may quickly become the new standard. The CGI is second-to-none, and the intensity between the characters is fantastic.

It is, by no means, a perfect movie. There are flaws within it, and there are certain scenes that I took issue with (the climax of the train scene, Octopus' inner monologue, etc.). However, Raimi seems to have learned from his mistakes from the original movie, and delivers a movie that has a near-perfect balance between action, romance, character development, laughs, and honesty to the original characters. All things considered this is a movie that will satisfy both the Webheads, as well as the average moviegoer-on-the-street.

The DVD extras are also top-notch, rounding out a perfect package for the comic fans in your life.  This one is definitely a must-own for comic fans, and specifically Webheads.",1125446400,,1978,5.181818181818182

1501835,4,B00005JMQW,"I usually don't enjoy comic book-inspired movies, but the ""Spiderman"" films are an exception to the rule. That is partially because Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast as Peter Parker/Spiderman, and also because the scripts, special effects, and supporting cast are phenomenal as well.

""Spiderman 2"" is even better than its predecessor. The story picks off where the first film left off: Peter is struggling to suppress his feelings for Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), whose acting career is finally taking off. Peter begins to doubt his decision to lead a double life in exchange for his own happiness: he decides to throw in the towel (or in this case, the spider suit) and try living a ""normal"" life. But normalcy doesn't stop Mary Jane from getting engaged to another man, nor does it allow Peter to turn his back on the insurgence of crime that has plagued New York since Spiderman hung his suit out to dry.

Ultimately, Peter decides to continue fighting the bad guys, and he comes face to face with a villain who is even more impressive than the Green Goblin: ""Doctor Octopus,"" a mechanically-powered scientist whose experiment takes a turn for the worse and results in his tentacled creation taking control of him.

The audience will be glad to see a resolution to the Peter/Mary Jane romance, as well as a surprise cameo at the end that gives us a big hint as to what ""Spiderman 3"" will be about.

It is a true thriller in all aspects. The character of Spider-man becomes a much more realistic human being, a little less angst and a little more real world coarseness really works. The moment where Peter Parker decides to walk away from his other persona and return to the world of meekness and academia is quite effective. His self doubt seems to wash away as he moves further away from being a hero. But it is only a temporary respite, and when the moment calls he answers fearlessly, finally accepting the twin burdens he must carry as a hero and a human being. The film has so many incredible moments that it would be useless to list them all.

1501841,4,B00005JMQW,"One day, I walked into my local Blockbuster the day Spider-Man 2 came out. I came twenty minutes after it opened, so I could get a copy. ALL THE SPIDER-MAN 2 DVDS WERE ALREADY RENTED. I came back a week later, because by then the rush should've been over. All the Spidey 2 DVDs were gone. Two weeks later, I finally got a copy, and I was blown away.
  OK, first off, the SFX. They absolutely rocked. No flaws, screw ups, or even something that didn't look real. AMAZING. From begginning to end, there were no errors. Next, the characters. I do read the Spidey comics, and I must say that the Doc Ock presented in Spidey 2 was a lot more fun and entertaining then the one in the comic. His arms are more realistic looking, and the technology more believable.
  Now, you're probably asking yourself, why the heck didn't this movie get five stars? Well, when Peter flips off his bike to avoid the car, he lands, and some kids go, ""Hey, how'd ya do that?"" Peter's reply: ""Oh, well, you know, work out, eat your green vegetables."" The kids say, without feeling or nothin', ""That's what my ma's alawys sayin'. I just neva believed 'er."" It was stale and boring.

1501842,5,B00005JMQW,"With the blockbuster success that accompanied ""Spiderman"", Sony Pictures wasted no time in getting Sam Raimi back behind the camera for the sequel.  With the majority of the original film's cast being signed for 3 movies (according to their contracts), odds were looking good that ""Spiderman 2"" could possibly surpass the original film, in terms of box office success, story, and quality.  Well, the results did not disappoint, ""Spiderman 2"" was a sensational success with audiences, critics, and the box office.

""Spiderman 2"" picks up sometime after the events of ""Spiderman"", as Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is trying to make his way through college, hold down a pizza delivery job, shoot photos for the Daily Bugle, visit his Aunt May and Mary Jane, all this while still being the hero Spiderman.  Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is now a Broadway star, and drops a `bombshell' on Peter, by announcing she is going to be married and that it's too late for Peter and her.  Peter's best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco), continues to blame Spiderman for the death of his father Norman, which is beginning to cause a rift in his friendship with Peter, due to Peter's constantly shooting pictures of the wall-crawler.  Friendship troubles aside Harry invites Peter to meet Dr. Otto Octavius, a scientist that has made revolutionary breakthroughs in the field of robotics for Oscorp.  When a mishap occurs during an experiment, even though Spiderman tried to stop the accident from occurring, Octavius' wife was killed and the semi-sentient robotic arms that Octavius had created were fused into his body.  The semi-sentient robotic arms are now slowly taking control of Octavius' mind causing him to go insane and lash out at those who have wronged him.  Now as the evil Dr. Octopus, his main focus is eliminating the one man he believes to be responsible for his current condition and his wife's death, Spiderman.

The storytelling and the acting were so incredible and even more mature than expected, that the original film almost pales in comparison, and the original film was great.  ""Spiderman 2"" sets the bar even higher in terms of quality and craftsmanship, for future installments in this franchise, and other comic book movies in general.  This sequel is a definite must see for comic book fans and movie audiences in general, it contains a little something for everyone, from romance, to action, to comedy, ""Spiderman 2"" will not disappoint.

1501869,5,B00005JMQW,"I was, initially, one of the very few who wasn't ""blown away"" by the supposed brilliance of the first Spider-Man. My opinion changed later, however; for the better. But, at the time of SM2's release, I was still quite unimpressed with Director Raimi's first offering of Spider-Man. This, of course, affected by expectations on the sequel slightly. But then Spider-Man 2 came and, frankly, surprised the hell out of me. Every little problem I had with the original, seemed to be either corrected or lessened. This wasn't just a fun little popcorn movie like the first. This was an epic. And this was excellent.

Like its predecessor Spider-Man 2 is a fun, light, (sometimes campy) movie. However it adds on to that enjoyable premise an increased quality of acting, and a greater depth in both characterization and plot.

While SM1 was little more than the cinematic equivalent of bubble gum, SM2 turns the Spider-Man movie series into a full-blown saga. The changes from the first film are subtle on their own (stepped up dialogue and acting, better subplots, and a larger scope overall, to name a few), but all together, these improvements lift Spider-Man 2 above almost any other superhero movie to date.

At the center of it all is, obviously, Peter Parker; Spider-Man. Everything around him is larger this time around; his problems (both as Peter Parker and Spider-Man), his fears, and most of all, his enemies. And, of course, just as the danger surrounding him becomes greater, his life quickly begins to fall apart. We open the film with Peter struggling desperately to balance his two lives, his two identities, as Peter Parker's life is slowly being taken over by Spider-Man's, and the world's near-constant need for his heroics. We also delve deeper into his relationship (or lack thereof) with the girl of his dreams Mary Jane (Kristen Dunst). This, also, is going less-than-splendidly for Peter. All in all, at the beginning of the film, life is going pretty poorly for ol' Spidey.

The man to bring this all to life on the screen is none other than Tobey Maguire. And, honestly, he does a pretty spectacular job of it. Carrying over from his performance in SM1, Maguire adds a greater amount of depth and believability, that improves his character, and in turn, the film as a whole.

However, Maguire isn't quite the highlight of the film. That honor falls to Alfred Molina, and his amazing performance as Doc Ock. Molina was simply born to play the roll. Ock, or rather Dr. Octavius, is a kindly scientist and mentor when he needs to be, and conversely, a cold-hearted killer when it is called for, and, at times, a little bit in between. Though, the real beauty of the performance, I believe, is Molina's perfect execution of serious acting, with a light, often ""fun"" delivery. It's fun to watch, but it's not campy, it's not silly. It's just Molina having fun with a role; delivering every line with excellent fervor and zest. Molina's Doc Ock may very well be the best film villain yet in a superhero movie.

While Ock may not be campy, J.K. Simmons' portrayal of J. Jonah Jameson sure is. As Peter's grouchy, demanding boss, Simmons' delivers corny line after corny line with such skill and ease that he transcend the normal (negative) bounds of camp, and turns it into something that's actually fun, and extremely enjoyable. The rest of the supporting cast is strong, though not particularly memorable, and Rosemary Harris, James Franco, etc. all deserve mention for their roles in the film.

In all honesty, I had never even heard of Sam Raimi before the first Spider-Man, I have quickly become quite a fan of his. He captures the mood of Spider-Man's word perfectly, both storywise, and visually. Every scene is injected with bright and vibrant color palate to create a very comic book-like feel to the movie. His crafting of the story is also quite enjoyable. Some have criticized the film for it's rather slow-moving second act, but I found the ""slow-down"" quite apt in regards to the story; adding to the rather one-man epic feel of the movie.

The weakest part(s) of the film would without doubt have to be the love story with Mary Jane, and the woman that plays her, Kristen Dunst. Despite actually liking her as a child actress, it simply astounds me why ""they"" ever picked Dunst for the role. It's nothing horrible to be sure, but it's certainly nothing great, and Dunst just doesn't had anything to either her character or the movie as a whole. This may not entirely be her fault however as the romance does plays out much like a teenage soap opera, with quite a few corny lines, and stupid situations.

Luckily, the romance does little damage to the film overall; the solid acting from MaGuire and the supporting cast, the absolutely excellent acting of Alfred Molina, and Raimi's strong direction more than make up for it. Which in the end leaves us with what is one of the best comic book adaptations ever put on film.

1501871,3,B00005JMQW,"I haven't seen this movie since it was in theaters, but after all the praise it's received I can't help but write a belated review.  Simply put, the action in this movie is usually pretty good, but it's mostly just generic romance/drama crap.  Here's the thing: I don't like Parker, or Mary Jane very much.  He's a dork.  She's a dorkette.  When it comes to their personal lives, I just don't care.  (And the musical montage. Eww.)  And it's not just that it's mostly whiny romance/drama: It's *lame* romance/drama. I spent most of the movie wondering when the hell Dr. Octopus was actually going to DO something, or anyone else, for that matter.  I liked Dr. Octopus alright.  He's kinda charming, and comes off a lot better then you'd imagine, on film.  But, he's just not around all that much.  And while the surprisingly few action sequences are usually pretty good, they faulter at times.  For example, the scene where he saves the train is stupid and convoluted.  And, it pushes believability way past the breaking point, a remarkable feat for a frickin superhero movie.  And other than that the action is good, but hardly mindblowing.

Overall, this movie is passably entertaining and all, but I'm easily amused.  But, in the end, it's kinda lame.  I really can't understand why this is so critically acclaimed.  There are lotsa films out there that I dislike that critics love, but I can usually understand their reasoning.  Not so here.  Who knew, decent action movie + generic semi-comic, semi-dramatic quasi love story equalled genius.  Though I guess thats where it comes from: Critics hate superhero movies, so when they see one that really deemphasizes this central fact, they get real excited.  Course, I don't like most of these comic book and superhero movies either, but replacing it with cliched drama isn't gonna help.  But hell, there are worse movies that have made a bazillion dollars, and it's nice that Raimi's got to be a real big deal.  Hopefully, he'll start making good movies again, someday.

To tell you the truth, I am not a comic book fan, but yet I am familiar with some comic book heroes, and Spiderman is on the top of the list.  I became aquaintted with Spiderman with the animated show some time ago, and really never watched it because I thought it was silly.  But after watching the movie version, the whole story of Spiderman and the adaptation from the comic book blew me away.  First off, the story is great, the concept of good versus evil, a true love story, and a struggling young man trying to take responsiblility for many things in his life, and many people could relate to Peter Parker.  Second, Peter Parker is transformed into an incredible super hero that saves the city from petty crimes to evil villians trying to destroy everything.  The casting for the parts in this movie franchise could have not been any more perfect, Toby Mcguire is great as Peter Parker, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson and Alfred Molina as the unique Dr. Octavius, or/ and Doctor Octopus.

1501873,3,B00005JMQW,"It wasn't as good as the first. It had more talking and thinking, and blended that with some action and fighting and pulled it off very well. It was interesting to see Spider-man give up in the middle of the movie and return later. Also, it was interesting to see him lose his powers. This made the movie vary a little from the first, which was good. However, the web swinging scenes have become even more fake. It is so obvious that the are computer generated. Also, when did Spider-man become so strong? I understand that he is stronger than normal people, but is he really strong enough to stop a train speeding at 120 mph that has no brakes or hold up a wall of a building? I think that was a bit exaggerated. Also, when ""Doc Ock"" was building his fusion machine, didn't he ever consider the radiation? There was no protection from it and it wasn't mentioned in the movie. Obviously these guys also relied on Peter Parker for high school science.  But overall it was good movie, and I would recommend that you watch it if you want to see a good movie or if you liked the first one. Also, if you need some tips on how to make a girl fall in love with you, see this movie. And if you like bad guys that turn good, see this movie. You know what, to make things short, see the movie.

1501960,5,B00005JMQW,"After being somewhat disappointed with the original ""Spider-Man"", I avoided paying the hefty $10 price tag to watch this in the theatre. After seeing this film for the third time on television, I kinda wished I would have seen this on the big screen.

What makes this film better than the original is not the Hi-Tech effects and bloated story-line but the emotional struggles torturing several of the main characters, from our heroes to the villain. ""Spider-Man 2"" is more emotionally charged and the very human conflicts add a sense of realism to a technically over-the-top film.

Toby Maguire's charming portrayal of Peter Parker is great here. The constant mental anguish of being unemployed; not being able to be with the woman he loves; the guilt he carries over his Uncle's death and his doomed friendship with Harry Osborne, all make his Spider-Man come across as a flawed but exceptional super-hero and not a caricature. Despite having extraordinary powers, he leads a a pretty miserable and marginal life. His physical appearance is also a stand-out. Maguire is not a tall, buffed, physically imposing individual. His demure appearance makes his Spider-Man more attainable. A simple guy who was suddenly thrust into a surreal and dangerous world of science-fiction. Kirsten Dunst is also an emotional wreck, being totally in love with Parker and not understanding as to why he refuses to be a permanent part of her life. Emotionally, the film works well because the 2 main characters are likeable enough to make us care for them and their emotional plights.

Even the villain, Doc-Ock comes across as rather sympathetic during the final segment. A genius who's creation and megalomania overcame him. Despite all of the evil he caused, it was his creation that caused all the chaos.

As mentioned previously, this film is considerably over-the-top and some scenes are unbelievable at best. The scene in which Parker looses his Spidey powers and falls several stories to the ground with not one bruise or broken bone is one of the examples and the subway scene is another. But hey, this is based on a comic book... What else should the viewer expect? And when all is executed so cleverly, who the heck cares?

""Spider-Man 2"" towers above many in the genre. It's a thrilling tale of an all too human super-hero and a not to human villain. If a sequel is to follow, it sure has tough shoes to fill.

Highly recommended.",1119398400,3,2424,4.9

1501962,5,B00005JMQW,"No, Harry Oswald doesn't go around quoting ""The Princess Bride,"" or referring to Inigo Montoya's famous quest to revenge his father's death by a six-fingered man. However, he blames Spiderman for the death of his father (AKA the Green Goblin). He'll do anything to avenge his father, and that includes making a deal with Dr. Octopus.

That, and several other excellent subplots help make Spiderman 2 the best screen adaptation of a comic book series. I argue that it is better than best-of-show in a genre, and can be placed in the echelons of great movies overall.

Although incredible effects help create a real Spiderman, the movie excels because of the humanity of Peter Parker.

Peter is in love, but isn't willing to tell Mary Jane. He uses Spiderman as his excuse even though it is old fashioned fear of commitment and rejection that are at play. Any teenager or young 20s man has felt that angst, and so we relate to Peter.

Peter loves his Aunt May and the late Uncle Ben, and feels heavy guilt for Uncle Ben's death. It was Peter, after all, who let the thief who later killed Ben escape. The relationship between Aunt May and Peter is like a grandmother and grandchild, and is believable.

Mr. Jameson is the least believable character, and the most caricatured. Snapping quickly at any opportunity to malign Spiderman's reputation, he acknowledges that Spidey's apparent retirement causes an increase in the crime rate.

The Plot:

Peter tries to set aside his Spiderman persona to forge a real life. Too often, he found Spidey interfering with his ability to keep his word, to be on time, keep his grades up, to earn money and to keep and grow relationships.

After soul-searching, he quits, and tries a post-Spidey lifestyle. He watches as police rush by a few times. When Peter saves a baby in a burning building without the assistance of super powers, only to learn someone remained in the building and died, he knows he could've done something.

Meanwhile, Harry Oswald introduces Peter to his hero, physicist Dr. Octavius. Dr. Octavius is working on a project that can revolutionize and resolve the world's energy problem. During a demonstration, the experiment goes awry. Spiderman launches into action, and saves the day. Unfortunately, Dr. Octavius's beloved wife dies in an explosion, and the Dr. himself finds that the robotic arms he used to help with the experiment have fused to his nervous system.

Raging against Spiderman for, as he believes, killing his wife, Dr. Octavius seeks revenge. Concurrently, he tries to rebuild the dangerous experiment. He needs rare materials, and deals with Harry, who also wants revenge. If Dr. Octavius captures Spiderman, Harry will give him the material.

When Harry pulls out a dagger, ready to kill the bound up Spiderman, he pulls off the mask, and everything changes. How can his best friend be Spiderman?

All of the while, Peter is trying to make ends meet. The cantankerous Mr. Jameson hires Peter to photograph a social event involving John, his son, a famous astronaut.

It turns out that John is seeing Mary Jane, and becomes engaged to her. Peter's heart sinks, and he tries to talk her out of it and back into a relationship with him. MJ counters that she and Peter have no relationship to return to. It is over, and Peter knows it.

When Dr. Octavius kidnaps MJ, and tells Peter to tell Spidey to meet him, Peter must decide if Spiderman must exist to save MJ, the world, but in doing so, lose MJ's heart.

What will Peter choose? The love of a woman, or her life? It is an impossible choice, and replete with danger either way.

The transition between comic book and movie screen has never been as smooth. Ang Lee's ""Hulk,"" had no depth, just as Christopher Reeve's ""Superman."" Fun? Yes, but neither were great movies. ""Spiderman 2"" is a great movie.

We forget who are the actors. Kirsten Dunst as girl-next-door Mary Jane Watson is fantastic, being beautiful and ordinary simultaneously. Rosemary Harris looks as much as like Aunt May as anyone could. Finally, Tobey Maguire is so perfectly cast as Peter Parker, that all is seamless.

I fully recommend Spiderman 2. I'm ready for ""Spiderman 3,"" and hope the producers realize that there is enough good Spiderman material to make another five movies as good as this.

1502040,2,B00005JMQW,"2 &  stars for SPIDERMAN 2.  Where should I start with this disappointment?  Well, there was an underlying feeling of dissatisfaction for this reviewer with the `beat down' approach to the film-that is, with the way that absolutely nothing seemed to go right for Peter Parker.  While there was an expectation that things would begin to look up as the cinematic denouement approached, the grim experience that was SPIDERMAN 2 was slow to improve as the movie progressed.

There were several other things that I can quickly point out after watching the movie too:

First, was the dippy and drawn out `train scene.'  For this reviewer, this is where a lot of the problems began.  Aside from the villain having no reason whatsoever to even drag Spiderman into his problems (he could have very easily taken what he wanted from Peter's `friend' without this preposterous detour, though SPIDERMAN 2 would have been missing about 30% of content), after the villain taunted Spiderman to `catch the train,' it was really quite boring to watch him do things that were so absurd:  you have to watch Spiderman throw webbing around, which does nothing...until he throws a little more webbing around.  Bravo.  But before you have to slog through twenty minutes of web-throwing, Spiderman tries to drag the train to a standstill with his foot!  Spiderman isn't Superman, and he could no more stop a train by using his foot as a brake than I could.  I just hate it when superheroes that we know and love do things that we very well know that they could not do, or when their powers are inconsistently displayed throughout the movie.  Well, if you don't like this phenomenon, then you will really have to be patient in order to get through SPIDERMAN 2.

Second, Spiderman's identity-his SECRET identity-is revealed way too much, so much that it made this reviewer roll her eyes and just sigh several times.  Spiderman stops the train, gets bodysurfed  to safety by its passengers and because all of these passengers see his face (he takes off his mask sometime during this sequence...and generally way too often throughout the movie for my taste), they solemnly swear not to reveal his identity.  If this sounds corny, then your blood sugar will thank me for not telling you more about this silly scene.  And then this same secret identity is revealed to the friend of Peter Parker's who has got the grudge against him (for being Spiderman's friend or for killing his father, depending on how you look at it).  It's really too too much.

Third, getting back to this notion about endowing heroes with abilities that they would never have...in the final action scene, Spiderman holds up a side of a building or some kind of wall-??-and then throws it like it's a feather!  Okay, now this is something that I would not blink at if it was Superman or the Incredible Hulk or that rock monster guy from Fantastic Four (a name anyone?), but Spiderman?!  No, he could not throw that wall anymore than Batman could. Again, too too much.

And finally, speaking of overkill, the only way the last sequence with M.J. fleeing a very important event and ending up in the last place she is expected to be would have been acceptable, is if when she prompted:  `Well, say something,' the other person had said:  `Wake up.  You're dreaming.'  Believe me, I wish I had been dreaming, but it's true:  SPIDERMAN 2 didn't fulfill its great potential.  They had all the makings for a great action/drama/romance, but it was only pretty okay.  I guess they forgot that `to whom much is given, from much will be required.'

But my old man likes them and my girfriend told me it was ok, so I threw it on in hopes it would put me to sleep. Within the first few minutes I thought the CGI looks as bad as the 1st film. But I soon realised this one didn't take itself too seriosly. I laughed at the situation when Spiderman becomes web-impodent and has to to catch an elevator to get down from the building, and it sparks the point, what would it be like to ride the elevator with one of these guys?

The low-key opening third of the film in which Parker's character and situation is explored and revealed is quite engaging. Maguire has a soft, laid back approach that is quite appealing. This feels like a real film with real characters. The surrounding characters are a little over-blown, but seen as a film about a real person living in a comic-book fantasy, they work well, and there is a healthy, knowing tongue-in-cheek intelligence about the film that pulls me in. But at some point in the middle when the action film section really gets going I realized that I had become bored. The film had lost the art-house feel of the opening, had become yet another Hollywood No Brainer with big action sequences, no character development, no surprises, just the usual crash scenes. It was hard to stay focused, and I wondered why and where exactly the awareness of the intelligent viewer had been dropped. Certainly Molina plays the villain with wink-wink, thigh slapping gusto, and there is enough humour and drama in the ending to make most readers forget the tedium of the the middle third.

1502046,2,B00005JMQW,"They say never to mess with a winning formula. Spider-Man made a HUGE ammount of money in theaters, and set quite a few records. People really loved this movie, (myself included.) It had all the action it needed, characters were well-developed, and it was just like a comic book. It was even very funny and enjoyable.

Why, then, did they mess this up with Spider-Man 2? All the fun of the first movie is gone, instead replaced by endless sappy conversations. Other reviewers have mentioned all the crying that goes on in this movie. I agree, there was way too much of it. In almost every scene, characters are always in tears. This was not what I expected from a sequel to one of the best ACTION movies of 2002! This one tries way too hard to be dramatic, and it was simply boring.

The plot was not fun, either. Essentially, Spider-Man distances himself from all his friends, and they're all upset about that. There you go. Oh yeah, and there's a scientist who installed tentacles onto himself and is now on a violent rampage.

Compared to the plot of the first movie, this one is simply laughable. There is also almost no action scenes in this movie. Maybe 2 or 3 big action sequences, but the rest of the movie is simply one ""crying scene"" after another.

The action scenes, by the way, aren't really as much fun as in the first movie. Sure, they are bigger and more explosive, but they are too violent to be fun. Now, violence is not a problem for me in most cases. I really like many movies and video games that people considder violent. But it seemed so pointless and out of place in Spider-Man 2 that it drained all the fun out of the action scenes. Endless close-ups of people SCREAMING at the camera before being killed is not only very violent, but it's also cheesy. (What is this, a B-movie?)

A big scene showcased on the trailers and commercials ""Let's see who is behind the mask!"" Is not nearly as cool as it seems. They wanted you to expect this to be a huge deal, and this whole scene ended up falling flat.

Overall, Spider-Man 2 was simply a dull, tear-filled sequel to one of the coolest movies of 2002. Obviously, you should see this if you were a fan of the original simply to see where they're going with the story, but overall....this movie just doesn't even come close to what the first movie offered.",1114128000,5,2326,4.448356807511737
1502047,4,B00005JMQW,"Spider-Man 2 is alot better than the  overrated 2002 'Spider-Man'. I say that because the film itself has a generous story that's very realistic. Tobey Maguire as usual was good as  Peter Parker/Spider-Man  (despite his 5'7 frame)>>>>>no pun intended.  Throughout the film Peter Parker is struggling w/ his own personal problems  and appears to be a recluse to MJ, Aunt May & Harry Osbourne. He's so involved w/ being Spider-Man he ignores the little things in life. By the way, he's still in love in MJ........which leads to the Superman 2 plot (spoiler). For the villain of the film, we have  Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina). He's pretty good in the role, though his screen time is limited. Viewers get a dose of good action scenes involving Spider-Man vs Dr Ock (though not alot of scenes)........Kirsten Dunst was so-so as MJ (not my 1st casting choice in the role)......she basically whines off & on about Peter not being true to his feelings about her ( Maguire/Dunst have bad chemistry,  not as bad as Reeves/Moss in Matrix).  James Franco improved(acting-wise) in the film. Franco in Spider-Man 1 was too dull, but in Spider-Man 2 we can see the darkness that lies within him,  but I'll admit,  the scenes with  Peter/Harry  were highly amusing  and badly scripted at the same time. Oh,  and for all you Willem Dafoe fans, he's in Spider-man 2 as well (in a unexplained  ending).  Yeah................I think Raimi should've nixed the whole  Norman Osborn taunting Harry scenario if he's not going to be the villain in Spider-man 3...............All & all I loved the film alot, a few things could be changed (like most films)>>>>>>>I hope my review helps",1113782400,2,1659,4.888888888888889
1502048,5,B00005JMQW,"I think Spiderman 2 is one of the all time best movies. It is full of both action and adventure, based on the old superhero comics and cartoons. The effects used in this movie obviously took a long time to develop and administer. A large-budget movie with a large-budget profit.

I saw this on the big screen several times, and not once did I loose my interesting. I think my favorite part about this movie-and there are a lot-is the criminal. This one is so much more original and developed than the green goblin, which was used in the first Spiderman movie.

The third Spiderman movie is due out May 2007. While my hopes for that are high, I firmly believe that Spiderman 2 will be better simply because I know the basis of the plot for the next movie.

Spiderman two takes the viewer into the depths of the main character, Peter Parker aka Spiderman. Very strongly developed. I think one of the main reasons this film was such a big success, other than from the past fame, is that it was relatable. Many people who saw it could relate to the pain that he felt and the utter hopelessness for success and for the woman he loves.

This movie is also one of those rare films that are rated PG-13 for a questionable reason-stylized action violence. Because of this, it is acceptable to be viewed by most ages of the audience.

To summarize it all, Spiderman 2 is a great blockbuster movie full of action, adventure, and suspense. It will keep the reader to the seat, and at the end of the film, awaiting the day when the third movie will be released.

1502108,4,B00005JMQW,"As children, most of us grow up wishing we could become gravity-defying super heroes, flying around the world, battling villains, rescuing the innocent, and fighting for truth, justice and the American way.  But what if the burden of such a calling turned out to be too much for us?  What if saving the world became a 24-hour-a-day/seven-days-a-week occupation that prevented us from leading a normal life and finding happiness with our one true love?

That is the dilemma Peter Parker faces in ""Spiderman 2,"" a deeper, richer, more psychologically nuanced follow-up to the rather innocuous ""Spiderman"" from 2002.  Most of the major players from the original have returned, including director Sam Raimi and stars Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst.  What's different this time around is that the filmmakers have chosen to emphasize the inner conflict Parker is undergoing between needing to fulfill the awesome responsibilities that go along with being a crime fighting super hero and wanting to chuck it all in order to win the heart of the literal girl-next-door.  Parker finds that being Spiderman keeps him from fulfilling the mundane, run-of-the-mill, day-to-day commitments one needs to in order to have successful relationships with other people - most especially the girl he loves.  When the conflict becomes too much for him, Peter has to decide whether or not he is going to continue to lead this double existence or return to the simplicity of life as a mere mortal.  It is this added intellectual dimension that gives ""Spiderman 2"" the thematic heft that ""Spiderman 1"" lacked.

The plot, involving a brilliant scientist who inadvertently becomes a killing machine when one of his experiments goes awry, is reasonably entertaining and interesting, though it pales in comparison to the love story and the complex internal conflict taking place in our superhero's overtaxed psyche.  The special effects seem vastly improved over the original, with Spiderman's movements through the air appearing considerably more graceful and natural than they did the first time around.  A spectacular scene involving Spiderman attempting to arrest a runaway train racing uncontrollably through Manhattan is the action highlight of the film.

As Parker, Toby Maguire provides the emotional gravity the story needs to be effective.  His shy, self-effacing demeanor draws us to the character and makes him a believable, sympathetic figure whom the audience can relate to and root for all the way through.  The sweet, vulnerable, yet eternally self-assured Kirsten Dunst makes for the perfect romantic counterpart to this young man who's all thumbs and who seems perpetually tongue-tied when he isn't donning his webbed designer jumpsuit.

I wasn't a big fan of the first ""Spiderman"" movie, but ""Spiderman 2"" has an intelligence and charm that make this particular installment awfully hard to resist.

Firstly, the beginning of the movie seemed to dwell on the ""troubled hero"" issue for a very long time. While some of this was undoubtedly central to the character of Pete, I felt that it was dragged out for too long. It became somewhat monotonous in the end.

However, once the action started, the movie really entered its own league. THe villian, Doc Ock, was awesome and well-played by Alfred Molina, bringing his own sense of internal conflict to the plot.

The visual effects are astounding and greatly add to the overall feel of the movie. Also, as a minor point, the Editor provided some nice comic relief, as always. He was not uproariously funny, but he was amusing in his own stingy, opportunistic ways.

1502114,4,B00005JMQW,"I would call the follow-up to the hugely popular Spider-Man movie a masterpiece did it not possess numerous boneheaded gaffs. For instance:

Dr. Otto Octavius becomes the evil Doctor Octopus as a result of his attempts to create a fusion reaction, an artificial sun. The key ingredient in this experiment is ""precious tritium,"" a substance so rare ""there's only 25 pounds of it on the whole planet,"" presented as a gold-colored metal. I truly, deeply wish they'd chosen a different substance. In real life, tritium is (a) a gas, not a solid, (b) so common and inexpensive it's used - because it glows in the dark - in mass production firearms night sights.

Doc Ock is sent by Harry Osborn to capture Spider-Man. In order to do this, he's told to question Peter Parker. (Harry believes Peter has entered into an arrangement with Spider-Man to take pictures of him, thus Peter must have some means of contacting the wallcrawler.) Then Ock, to get into the cafe where Peter and Mary Jane Watson are having a heart-to-heart talk, throws a car through the front window. If Peter hadn't - barely - been able to fling himself (and MJ) to the floor in time, Ock would have squished the person he needed to talk to, needed alive to take a message to Spider-Man - which makes him seem hideously incompetent. Peter was sitting right at the front window, Ock had to see him there....why nearly kill someone he needed alive by tossing a car at him? Come to think of it, how did Ock know Peter was in that particular cafe? Did he use his Octopus sense? Maybe he staked out Peter's apartment, then followed him to the cafe? But then why didn't Ock jump Peter before he reached the cafe? Why did he wait the entire time Peter and MJ were talking? The more you think about it, the less sense this entire scene makes.

We're told that J. Jonah Jameson has ""turned the entire city against Spider-Man."" But every time we see the citizenry they're cheering him as he swings past, singing songs about him, treating him like a rock star.

Late in the film, Peter unmasks himself while saving a train. Exhausted afterwards, his bleeding and unconscious form is carried into the train car by the passengers, from hand to hand over their heads until he's finally laid gently and reverently on the floor. The Christ-being-pulled-from-the-cross imagery is not lost on me; it's a beautiful scene. When Peter wakes and realizes, oh, 50 people have seen him without his mask, a little boy solemnly informs him, ""We won't tell nobody."" All I could think was how unlikely it was, in our media-obsessed culture, out of 50 random New Yorkers not one of them would run to the National Enquirer screaming, ""Give me a million dollars and a sketch artist, quick! I can show you what Spider-Man looks like without his mask.""

As in Daredevil, the hero in this movie is unmasked entirely too often. Three times, actually. Twice Peter unmasks himself in front of others (great job maintaining the ol' secret identity there, Pete) for reasons that seem to me wholely insufficient. By the time SM2 is over, not only has an entire train car of New Yorkers seen Spidey without his mask, but Doc Ock, Harry Osborn and Mary Jane Watson all know that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. In the case of Doc Ock that strikes me as extremely shortsighted - it's going to be a real problem if they ever want to bring back the character.

And so on. Believe me, I could continue but I only have 1,000 words here.

So the movie has problems. And yet....while you're watching it, they don't really matter. Spider-Man 2 is based loosely on an old Stan Lee story from the 1960s titled ""Spider-Man No More"" in which Peter Parker tosses his Spidey outfit in a trashcan and tries to have a real life. The movie works - mostly because of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker. From his first second on-screen in the first movie, Maguire totally inhabited this character, he's utterly believable as the achingly decent, slightly geeky young hero with an overdeveloped sense of responsibility. I'm less enthusiastic about Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson; she's a tolerable actress but somewhat miscast. James Franco as Harry Osborn is, eh, okay. On the other hand, Rosemary Harris makes a wonderful Aunt May; her speech to Peter about why the world needs heroes like Spider-Man literally had me crying. J.K. Simmons is absolutely perfect as J. Jonah Jameson; every second he's on-screen is magic. Alfred Molina, a fine actor, as Doctor Octopus looks like the comic book character come to life, and his tentacles are believable. Stunning, actually. Through a combination of expert puppeteering and CGI, these inanimate objects are almost characters in their own right. The story pulls you along with a pace that makes Raiders of the Lost Ark seem slow....which is a good thing because it gives you less time to think about its many glaring logic flaws.",1111881600,,4874,4.72032902467685

Has a lot of action in it, but that's not all the movie focuses on. The movie really shows Spiderman's internal struggles, how it's not always so great to be a hero.

1502200,5,B00005JMQW,"I am seriously surprised to see some of the negative reviews on here.  I can't understand it.
I liked Tobey Maguire a lot more in this one than I did the first movie. He just seemed better for the role. I don't even know exactly why. He just looked, and acted the role so much better. I guess it's that it's his second go at it and doesn't need to get into the character anymore.
Kirsten Dunst, again, was awesome. I liked the hair colour more in this one. It looked realistic, like a red head should look. It fit her much better. I guess they could always say that her hair was dyed in the first movie. That would make sense to me.
Alfred Molina was a welcome addition to the cast. I felt he did the part of Doctor Octopus justice. I believe it's always hard to play a character that people already know. The character has a good 40 years of background and I feel that Molina played it to perfection. He stayed true to the character and gave it his own flare.
And it was great to see Jameson with a bigger role this time. I think that J.K. Simmons is an amazing actor and got to play with his hilarious character more.
The special effects were pretty awesome. I'm not usually one to praise a movie for it's special effects, but really, it was spotless. And it wasn't overused. Sam Raimi wanted to make sure that when it was possible to use animatronics for Ock's arms, he would. I can understand some of the action sequences needing computer animation to pull it off. How else would they do that battle on the train?!
Some people I found complained greatly about the lack of action and the copious amounts of romance. I didn't feel that was the case. Being someone who follows the comics, I found it to be true to the Spider-Man stories. It was showing that Peter was having a tough time, and it could only be emphasized by showing his relationships with his family and friends. If this wasn't to happen, we would be stuck with a film starring a protagonist that no one really cares about that much. I, for one, will not stand for that.
Besides, how is he supposed to fight when he doesn't have his powers for half the movie?
The action that was present was just amazing and surpassed the first movie in every way. Seriously, the visuals of Doc Ock and Spidey duking it out can't be beat! It just can't!
My only big complaint was the whole idea that Doc Ock's arms were alive. They squeaked at him and stuff. That's just a little too cheesy for my liking. The arm's designs were awesome, but I think it would just have been better to have him go crazy from the accident like in the comics. I'm sure they could make it work.
All in all, a terrific film. I can't wait to see the next one because I know there will be a next one.",1111190400,,2727,4.254335260115607

1502204,5,B00005JMQW,"Spider-Man 2 is better than most other superhero movies you have seen, not because the comic and hero makers are still alive to help carry Hollywood through those taxing story hurdles, but because director Sam Raimi is at the helm, period. If Spider-Man 2 suffers from anything, then obviously it is a restricted budget (seen in the budget CGI effects of the first outing) because Raimi was a relatively unknown director with only a big list of unknown films (Evil Dead movies) behind him. If anything blame the studios for throwing an extra 30 million in the direction of 10 Direct to DVD moves you never watched last year.

Spider-Man 2 takes off from where the first one almost left off, Mary Jane is still the love Peter Parker can not have, the new Green Goblin/ Hobgoblin is in the making, Aunt May copes with the loose of her husband and we learn some new things about her life and where it is going, Dr. Octavius is in town for a science class and more of The Daily Bugle means Spider-Man 2 is almost like watching a re-run of the first, with the side story that when Parker becomes depressed he looses he powers. Thus when the bad guys start winning more, Parker starts to loose his powers more. It is a very good new character development in Spider-Man's abilities to fight crime.

I quite like the character of Dr. Octopus. What Raimi does with his character towards the end is very interesting. Most Superhero movies are about bad vs good. Here Raimi does fallen good guys vs mutant good guys. The CGI effects in this opus are a notch up or two from the last one. It is just such a shame that Spider-Man is not getting the credit that the studio should have given it from the start.",1110499200,2,1694,4.461290322580645
1502205,5,B00005JMQW,"It's been two years and Peter Parkers' world is crumbling around him as he struggles to meet the demands of everyday life. After two years nothing has gotten any easier. Bashed by the Daily Bugle, tormented and miserable because of secrets he can never reveal, and forced to give up the girl he loves, at times his gift and curse of being Spider-Man is too much to bear. As more aspects of his life become unbalanced and miserable, Peters' stress begins to give him mysterious web-failures, a very dangerous thing to happen when he's web-swinging more then 300 feet up high in the air. What's even worse is that his idol Doctor Octavius is turned into a madman now dubbed 'Doc Ock' as the result of a failed experiment.
Unable to cope as his life turns to crud and more of his powers begin to leave him, Peter snaps and throws away his costume for good. Thus giving up being Spider-Man, and determined to get his life back on track. Living a fantastic dream that can never be, Peters' life seems much better for a short while. Very soon his dream fades away into darkness and everything goes wrong again when Peter is unable to help citizens in pearl, upsets his Aunt by revealing the truth about Uncle Bens' death, and when Doc Ock snatches Mary-Jane right in front of Peter's eyes. Now Peter must hope that his powers return, re-think his choice and learn the true meaning of responsibility. With many lives in danger, above Manhattans magnificent skyline, Spider-Man must face his fiercest enemy, his destiny, and himself.

I saw this movie the first day it opened in movie theaters. I loved this movie so much; it's now my favourite. I found it to be so much better then the first in many ways. It was all about a selfless man deciding to become selfish, then having to learn that he has to give up the thing he wants the most, even his dreams. Tobey Maguire was perfect as his portrayal of both Spider-Man and Peter Parker, he really showed Peters' character and essence. Kirsten Dunst couldn't have been better; once again she nailed it right on the head with her portrayal as Mary-Jane Watson. James Franco and Rosemary Harris were also fantastic as Harry Osbourne and Aunt May. Alfred Molina was awsome as Doc Ock, he gave a perfect performance.
The special effects were brilliant, now that web-swinging has been perfected. The music was so full of excitement and vibrant energy, I remember getting so excited when I saw the trailer for this movie. The movie was suspenseful, action-packed, and very entertaining.
This movie is a great buy you surely won't regret.

It pretty much goes snivel, snivel, snivel, brief moments of action, snivel, snivel, some quick special effects, snivel, snivel and so on.  I gave it one star because, admittedly the special effects for Doctor Octopus are pretty cool and the humor of Jameson is fairly amusing as well.  Spidey's character is nothing more than a sniveling loser.  Whenever two of the main characters in the movie get together, with the exception of Doctor Octopus, you can feel free to go to the fridge because of good 15 minutes of sniveling will undoubtably ensue.  There is Spidey sniveling, MJ sniveling, Aunt May sniveling, Spidey and MJ sniveling, Spidey and Aunt May . . . you get the picture.  There is even a part where Spidey starts to lose some of his powers because of all his sniveling and what does he do . . . he snivels about it.  If I were Spidey, I would be embarrassed to be such a loser.  The battle of Spidey vs. Doctor Octopus actually takes a backseat to Spidey's endless whiny ""self discovery"".  My advice is to skip this one.  I got it out of the library and am still bitter about the time I wasted watching it.",1110067200,15,1158,4.419811320754717

I get that a superhero action movie needs to establish the humanity of the character, but does he have to be such a dull dimwit? As far as ""best superhero movie ever"" goes, I'll still stick with the first Superman and Batman movies and perhaps even Daredevil.  When not in costume, the hero needs to avoid being pathetic or at least be interesting and amusing enough to overcome that state.  In his first two big budget  movies, Peter Parker has been neither interesting nor amusing while being far too pathetic to engender any sympathy.

1502209,5,B00005JMQW,"It's an odd circumstance when a sequel surpasses the original in most every way, and it is perhaps even more so when the original was nothing to scoff at to begin with.  Nonetheless, director Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man 2"" is in every way a superior film to the original.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the original ""Spider-Man"", but in this follow-up Raimi has really found his stride, and explores themes that are awfully sophisticated for what could have easily succeeded as a vacuous summer thrill-fest.

Specifically, it is in Raimi's on-going exploration of the everyman hero that is Peter Parker where the film shines.  As the story progresses, Parker begins to realize that there is a price to be paid for his abilities, and that perhaps heroism isn't quite what its made out to be.  This facet of the super-hero is nicely realized by Tobey Maguire, who, while he may be a rather leaden actor, nonetheless carries himself with a certain dignity that nicely suits the role.  In sharp contrast is the superb Kirsten Dunst, who once again steals the film as the vibrant Mary Jane.  Finally, Alfred Molina offers an outstanding performance as the erstwhile villain, Doctor Octavius.

As I indicated, this film is more than adequate as a typical Hollywood blockbuster.  The special effects are nicely handled, and those surrounding Doc Ock's mechanical arms are particularly impressive.  While Spider-man occasionally looks a little too perfect, he nonetheless offers some remarkable visual treats.  However, it is the deeper elements which really set this film apart.

Above all, this is a New York movie, and more specifically, a New York movie informed by 9/11.  While the original was released after the tragedy, it was filmed almost entirely prior, and as such, it didn't really reflect its impact.  In ""Spider-Man 2"", Raimi takes the perspective we all gained as a result of that day, and applies it to his film.  Cops and firemen aren't heroes because they are cops and firemen, they are heroes because they choose to do the jobs that most of us don't want.  It is this element of choice that Raimi explores in his perfectly conflicted Peter Parker.

Parker didn't ask for his powers, and it is only as he begins to lose them that he realizes being a hero has nothing to do with ability, and everything to do with subsuming one's desires to the greater good.  Once he steps outside of his own self interest, he begins to realize the totality of his gift.  This transformation is nicely illustrated in a series of scenes that parallel events in the original movie.  In particular, a fire scene links the two movies together in a very effective way.

Conversely, the portrayal of Doc Ock as a truly conflicted villain provides the perfect counterpoint.  He's not evil per se, and his acts are as much a result of circumstance as ill intent.  He reveals the latent dark side in all of us, and displays the all too ready dangers of hubris.  At this same time, early scenes create a character with tremendous pathos, and as such this is a villain that you don't want to root against out of disgust.

Exciting, funny, original and deeply thoughtful, ""Spider-Man 2"" is a unique film.  While there are elements that need to be taken with a grain of salt, one can't deny that Raimi has striven to rise above the ordinary action movie clich&eacute;s.  While it can be enjoyed as the mega-hit that it was, there is a lot going on under the surface, and as such, this film stands apart.  ""Spider-Man 2"" is a real treat, and definitely not to be missed.

1502284,2,B00005JMQW,"After all the raves, I never expected such a terrible disappointment. This film is badly plotted, poorly scripted, self-indulgent, over-stuffed and under-edited.

It did have its moments. J.K. Simmons is a joy to watch as he nails the J. Jonah Jameson character -- his scenes are the best in the movie -- and the Doc Ock role could not have been more perfectly cast. The action scenes did the best job I've ever seen of capturing the feel of comic book action sequence. Unfortunately, much of the writing was equally true to capturing the feeling of comic book thought balloons -- and in a movie, that's a bad thing.

Worse, much of the plot made no sense at all, the Doc Ock resolution was insipid at best, and the entire first hour was painfully dull. Everything in it could have been fully established and better done in 30 minutes -- 40, tops.

Sam Raimi's usually deft touch with humor was painfully absent. The broad humor was overdone, highly repetitious and delivered with a sledge hammer. At the end, I felt I'd just watched Spiderman Meets Abbott and Costello, with poor Tobey Maguire being forced to play Spiderman and Abbott and Costello.

I love Sam Raimi's work as a rule. Commercially, he has another hit here. But for any viewers who watch with their brains engaged, this one's a turkey.",1109808000,5,1303,4.676855895196507

In this movie, I LOVE the fact that he is actually at a sort of war with himself over whether to follow true love...and live a normal life...or continue his life of responsibility as Spiderman.  He's also fighting with knowing that he killed Harry's father, and Harry desperately wants revenge against him, not knowing of course that he's Spiderman.

I never would have thought an action movie like this could intertwine such a good plot, but Spiderman 2 does it pretty well.  It all comes together pretty well at the end, and of course, the option of another installment of Spiderman is left open.

The ONLY flaw I found with this movie was with Spider-Man's inability to keep his mask on during the second half of the picture. At one point, I thought everyone in New York would get to see Peter Parker's face in the Spidey suit.

1502288,5,B00005JMQW,"""Spider-Man"" was one of the best superhero movies ever made; perhaps somewhat short of movies such as ""Superman"" and ""Batman,"" but worthy of being grouped with these two movies.  ""Spider-Man 2"" is even better than ""Spider-Man"" and raises the superhero movie bar.

Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is now in college, trying to hold a part time job as a pizza delivery boy while also being a superhero and still taking the occasional photograph for J. Jonah Jameson (played to perfection by J.K. Simmons).  Threaded through all this is his deep love for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  Unfortunately Peter is failing at nearly everything, even the superhero part.  Because Peter feels as though he must be a superhero first, he often delivers pizza late.  He is often late to class, and he still is unable to tell Mary Jane that he loves her.  To add insult to injury, Peter's powers are on the fritz from all the stress he is under.  In short, Peter's life is a disaster in slow motion.

In addition to all the other stress Peter is under, Aunt May is being forced to move from her home.  Perhaps the single biggest reason for that is the death of Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), which was partially Peter's fault and for which he continues to feel guilt.

Peter is getting near a low when he goes to a demonstration by Doctor Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) of a new technique for creating fusion.  As part of his technique, Dr. Octavius has created a unique set of arms that allow him to directly manipulate the fusion process.  The arms have their own built in artificial intelligence that will enable Dr. Octavius to more easily control them.  Dr. Octavius is asked how he will keep the artificial intelligence (AI) from controlling him once the arms tap into his nervous system.  He explains that there is a specially designed chip that blocks the AI from taking over his brain.

Dr. Octavius begins the experiment, which goes horribly awry, killing his wife Rosalie (Donna Murphy), and nearly killing Harry Osborn (James Franco), who was saved, barely, by Spider-Man.  However, Harry still hates Spider-Man and what he did to his father Norman Osborn, aka Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), and once the AI arms take over Dr. Octavius's brain, Harry agrees to provide Doc Ock, aka Dr. Octopus (his new improved name with the extra limbs), with tritium in exchange for Doc Ock bringing Spider-Man to him.  The reason that Doc Ock needs the tritium is to create another fusion generator.  Unfortunately, the fusion generator needs a lot more perfection, and if he succeeds the design has the potential of destroying far more than the city.

As you can perceive, there is a significant amount of complexity in this movie.  However, Director Sam Raimi manages to keep the elements coherent and believable.  While there was a point where I wondered how much lower Peter Parker could go before losing it all together, and I started to get a little frustrated with the constant depression he faced, the deep angst provided an excellent contrast as Peter slowly overcame his problems.  It is the depth of character development that makes this movie different from ""Superman"" and ""Batman.""  While ""Superman"" touched on Clark Kent's difficulties in being a person as well as a superhero, the focus of the movie was on his powers.  ""Batman"" did a much better job of character development, but even then the principal focus was on the one event in Bruce Wayne's life that caused him to become the Batman.

In ""Spider-Man 2"" we see someone a lot like us, a person that has not only bad days, but perhaps bad years, where nothing seems to go right.  But we also see Spider-Man figuratively pick himself up, mentally challenge himself to overcome his problems, and do exactly that.  While Peter's life will never be perfect, for a superhero and a human, it may be somewhat normal.

I am typically ambivalent regarding special feature versions on DVD that contain two discs because the second disc is often not worth the price.  However, in the case of this release there are a number of interesting features worth watching for those who appreciate the technology behind the special effects.  I was particularly fascinated by how the Dr. Octopus's arms were animated.  The blooper reel (which had a few funny moments but also had a number of not-so-funny moments) showed Alfred Molina trying to take a drink provided by one of his mechanical arms; a good trick once perfected sufficiently to appear in the movie.  There are numerous other features to show how some of the more interesting effects were created.

Historically, it has been difficult to bring comic book heroes to life.  Technology has been one of the biggest barriers, and has made it easier to create animated characters than live characters.  Now that technology has overcome much of that hurdle, the next difficulty is to make the characters human.  This movie has focused significant effort on developing Peter Parker as a young adult with all the normal problems of a young adult, with the added difficulty of being a superhero.  While some may cringe at how real life is for Peter, with the incredible angst created by all his problems, others will applaud the excellent translation from modern comics to the big screen.  Tobey Maguire, Sam Raimi, and the excellent supporting cast have made Spider-Man seem real.  In the process of making Spider-Man real they have also created a sequel greater than the original, and created a movie worthy of joining ""Superman"" and ""Batman"" was a landmark superhero movie that is destined to become a classic.",1109548800,4,5593,4.846315789473684

1502349,4,B00005JMQW,"I'm pleased to find another movie franchise that is able to sustain itself (unlike the Matrix or Star Wars).

This second (of multiple?) installment is darker than the first. Spidey is full of angst and is broke. What's the last time you saw a super-hero who couldn't pay his bills?

The FX are flawless and Elfman's score is great as always.

What we find here is solid character development and plot complications. I'm surpised at the choices made seeming so ""early"" in the franchise (unless this is just a trilogy). Unmasking Peter Parker took me by surprise.

A few points to pick -- I think the film did lose some momentum with the sporadic talkiness and I wished that the revelation to MJ would have taken a bit longer with more suspense. But these rough spots don't damage the vehicle as a whole.

I was excited by the characters' interaction and the general plot arch. I'm no Spiderman authority (I'd have to consult my Foushee guide for plot points, but I've sadly lost that guide), but I think it is a solid second chapter in the story.

1502350,5,B00005JMQW,"This is a perfect movie with all the good things in it. Good story, good visuals and good acting. Tobey rocks in this movie as a Spider-Man.

1502351,5,B00005JMQW,"Peter Parker can stop any crook (generally pretty easily) but he can't make it to an appointment on time. He can reach out to his friends and family but when they begin reaching back he sometimes can't be there. When they want an explanation, he's stuck. The writers and producers have captured Pete's dilemma perfectly. Tobey Maguire brings it to life. His portrayal of Peter Parker, with all his strength, frailty (and borderline neurosis) is perfect. Kirsten Dunst excels as his foil. She's the one who most wants most to believe that there's an explanation and that he's really trying, regardless of how things look. Rosemary Harris brings a sense of vibrancy to the character of Aunt May that was sometimes lacking in the original strip. The emotional range given to these characters is immense and the principles involved capture it without becoming excessive. Whenever the action involving the superpowers the character has strains belief the humanity of these figures serves to remind viewers that they're people like anyone else.

The role the supporting characters play is just as pivotal to the success of the film. J.K. Simmons has begun to flesh out the character of J. Jonah Jameson. If there are more sequels it'll be interesting to see what the producers give him to do with it. James Franco has done the same the same thing with the character of Harry Osborn. He was given more to work with as well. The only complaint here is that the direction his role is being directed in seems too obvious. Still, there could be a few surprises.

Casting Alfred Molina in the role of Doctor Octopus, and the treatment given to the character was a stroke of genius. He's sympathetic character who's capable of great evil, one that's compassionate but monstrous and brilliant but ruled by his ego. The role of Doc Ock is the only one where the player is called on to overact to any great degree. It would have been easy for the character to become a caricature because of it but Molina keeps that from happening. He manages each and every facet of the role with great aplomb. His performance is a triumph.

Without these facets intact some of the greatest action scenes ever done and any amount of fabulous CGI work would be meaningless. The strength of the Spider-Man series from the early days of the comic series through to the present has always been the principle characters in the series. Peter Parker was (and still is) the great 'every-man' of the medium. His world was everyone's world. The writers involved, Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, Michael Chabon, and Alvin Sargent, along with Director Sam Raimi recognized that point and stayed true to it. His world was a mirror of the conundrum everyone faces and his spider powers just served as a trigger for it. The producers of the films have made it a point to stay true to that. Because of that, the CGI work (which is excellent), and the action scenes (which are exceptionally well done) only serve to enhance a film was already well on its way to being a great one.

And this is a great one.",1108252800,8,3053,4.711610486891386
1502352,5,B00005JMQW,"To appreciate the power of this movie, one first needs to understand and acknowledge that Spider-Man is a character from the comic books, which, to say the least, are not the pinnacle of literary brilliance, especially as written at Marvel in the 1960s. (Sorry, Stan, but it's true.) If you're one of those pompous critics who thinks a movie needs to be deep, realistic and profoundly thought-provoking to be good or entertaining, then this flick just isn't for you. But if you're somebody who simply wants to spend two hours watching the Web Slinger and his colorful orbit of characters being brought to life again by Hollywood, then Spider-Man 2 will awe you.

Yes, the movie has its share of corny moments and simplistic dialogue, not to mention a plot that could have been written by dreamy 12 year olds everywhere, but to criticize it for that is akin to criticizing, say, the sport of football for containing too much hitting and not enough debating. Teenage angst and neurosis aside, the character of Spider-Man is about a guy with super-human strength and agility who slings his way across the city fighting criminals and saving the day. In other words, it's about action. The movies aren't meant to be cerebral; they're meant to give cinematic life to one of the 20th Century's most famous and popular fictitious heroes, and Spidey 2 does it in spades.

The special effects are breathtaking; magnificent in scope and more than seemless enough to prevent you from laughing and/or rolling your eyes at the action, which is considerable, particularly in the second half of the movie. Plus, if you're a fan of the original Spider-Man comic books from the 60s -- which, of course, is the heart and soul target audience of this franchise -- you'll find that the story is right on the money, with a few gleeful plot twists and moving moments thrown in.

The bottom line is, Spider-Man 2 is the best realization of a comic-book superhero that has ever been made, bringing Spidey even further to life and surpassing the first installment by, pardon the pun, leaps and bounds. Big budget Hollywood movies, which otherwise bore me to tears, don't come any better than this. I can't wait to see how they top it.",1108252800,5,2208,4.774869109947644
1502353,3,B00005JMQW,"The first half of this movie is the best half.  Instead of non-stop action sequences there is a lot of humor and much richer character development stemming from the first film.  However, I still think Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst look more like kissin' cousins than potential lovers, but they are obviously friends and the chemistry is good.  The dialogue in the first half of the movie is sharp and witty and fun.  There is even a scene where a street-urchin violinist stops what she is playing and plucks the Spider-Man cartoon theme song from yesteryear as the new Spider-Man walks by.  But by the time Bruce Campbell's now gratuitous cameo appears the script takes a left turn and becomes way too serious.  In fact, I don't ever need to hear all the reasons why Spider-Man and Mary Jane can't be together ever again.  I heard them all in the first film and I heard it three times in this second film.  Enough!  The second half of the movie tries to make up for all its unnecessary dialogue by incorporating a couple of good action scenes and special effects that range from good to mediocre.  It is frequently all too obvious that this Spider-Man is a CGI creation.  As an avid movie-fiend I want to suspend my disbelief, and I am more than willing to let a few discrepencies slide if the story remains interesting.  But ""Spider-Man 2"" has way too many flat spots, particularly in the second half of the film, to make it an engrossing experience.  There is even a grotesquely deliberate set-up for a part 3 in the not-too-distant future.  The fact that by the time I wrote this review, 185 merchants were trying to unload this DVD on the public should say something about the low replay value of this film.  Anything over 100 merchants is grounds for suspicion.  Give this flick a 'pass.'",1107993600,2,1794,4.59433962264151
1502354,5,B00005JMQW,"I still have fond memories of seeing the first Spider-Man movie back in the spring of 2002 and it is still a very good movie. It was worth the wait and left a great deal to be desired. So how was it that they were going to follow up on a really good original especially amidst the improvement that X2 did upon ""X-Men"". Well my verdict on this is that ""Spider Man 2"" is a grand improvement over the first one, is light years better, and greatly expands Spider Man's character in the movie series and the result is without a doubt one of the greatest sequels that I've ever seen! ""Spider Man 2"" is the number one movie of 2004 and is a highly recommended DVD! Be mindful that this review may contain some spoilers to this movie but I'll do my best to minimize them.

 Two years after the fiasco with Norman Osborn, Peter Parker starts to enter into uncharted territory in his life. Amidst the changes he's going through, things gradually deteriorate as his personal and professional life begins to come apart at the seams. Still devastated by the murder of his uncle Ben, His long time juggling of his superhero duty and his normal civilian life begin to take a massive toll on his well-being. He first loses his job as a pizza parlor when he fails to deliver the pizzas to his assigned destination and his boss fires him after repeatedly reprimanding him. He is a brilliant student at school but despite his brilliant mind, his grades rapidly deteriorate to the point that he's beginning to fail his classes. Even his teacher Doctor Connor is giving him failing grades. His peers start looking down on him due to the odd and sometimes unpleasant changes in his behavior and even Mary Jane Parker, his love of his life, parts ways with him due to his failing to meet her at the right time or the right place. Even worse is when his Spider-Man superpowers are starting to fail on him and it's believed to be the result of immense physical and emotional burnout. Literally, his life is now falling apart to the point that he finally throws the costume in the garbage and decides to leave the superhero business behind and just live a normal civilian life.

 But on a whole other note, Peter Parker is invited to visit a brilliant scientist named Doctor Otto Octavius, a world-renowned scientist who Parker idolizes. During a special demonstration at a laboratory, Octavius heads a promising project that utilizes a stable form of fusion power. The new project involves a state of the art nanotechnology that involves a set of mechanical arms that are designed to work in the fusion reactor machine where an unprotected human hand could not enter without being incinerated by the intense heat and radiation. However the experiment goes horribly wrong (don't they always?) when the fusion reaction goes out of control, starts pulling unsecured metal objects in to the fusion reaction to sustain itself, and the prominence-like flares engulfs his mechanical arms, electrocute him, and fuses the nanowires into his entire nervous system. The resulting accident literally destroys his ambition, severely deforms Octavius, as well as claims the life of his beloved wife Rosie Octavius.

 After the accident at the lab, Peter Parker, who finally has had enough of the demands of crime-fighting throws in the tower and decides to pursue his quest for a better life. Since putting the superhero business to rest, his life literally improves almost overnight. His grades begin to rapidly improve, and Peter is on his way to rebuilding his self-esteem. He even begins to win back Mary Jane's affection as well despite the fiasco from earlier in the film. He seems to have finally gotten firm ground in his life...or so it seems.

 Driven mad by the loss of his wife as well as the destruction of his fusion power dreams, Otto Octavius who is now a deranged shell of his former self flees to a foul decrepit abandoned warehouse in the Hudson river and with the manipulation of the robotic arms fused to his body, he decides to rebuild the fusion reactor that he designed only to make it much bigger than the old one and will do whatever it takes to do it, even if it endangers the lives of millions nearby. Dock Ock as he is now called, kidnaps Mary Jane and takes her to the foul abandoned warehouse by the Hudson River and holds her hostage there while he restarts the fusion power project that he seeks to complete and achieve his goals by any means necessary.

 Now with Mary Jane in peril, Harry Osborn wanting Spider-Man dead for the death of his father Norman, and the prospect of a much larger catastrophe than what happened at the lab, Peter Parker is faced with an excruciating dilemma of if he should continue to live normally or don the suit again in order to save New York City. His choices whichever one he makes till take agonizing effort to live through.

 This sequel to the first ""Spider Man"" movie completely took my world by storm even with sky high expectations. Almost everything about this movie is nothing short of brilliant. The major action fighting sequences between Spidey and Dock Ock are among the greatest battle scenes that I've seen in years. The major conflict between all of the characters is very intense be it Peter's conversation with Aunt May, his conflict between his choices as well as Otto Octavius' descent into madness.

 What especially carries this wonderful movie are the characters as well as the special effects. The special effects are really breathtaking and awesome. Pretty much everything that is more than 30 feet away are almost all CGI effects and they are highly realistic. The movie also expands the characters immensely. My favorite one was delving far deeper into Peter Parker's past. As I said in the review for the first Spider Man film, Toby Maguire was absolutely perfect for the role of the former geek student Peter Parker transformed into a superhero. The way they fleshed out his character is nothing short of phenomenal. Kristen Dunst as Peter's love Mary Jane is also better than in the last adventure and the tension between is almost revolutionary. Even Aunt May (who's at least in her 70s or 80s) brings some eye-opening surprises and some emotional moments are brought forth. Of course there's also the pompous flare-tempered J. Jonah Jameson of the Bugle newspaper.

 However the number one effects shared by two things are what especially buoy this movie upwards above its Marvel Comics peers. The first one is the arch nemesis Doctor Octopus/Dock Ock/Otto Octavius. Dock Ock is one of my favorite super villains in the comic series and that he would be the villain in this movie thrilled me very much. Even better was the actor who was selected to play him named Alfred Molina. Those who are old enough may remember him as Indiana Jones' former friend later traitor that met his end in the beginning of ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"". Well Molina is absolutely amazing and unbelievably perfect for the role of playing a brilliant benevolent scientist later twisted by grief and rage into a deranged shell of his former self. The way he acted in his role is nothing short of a future legend. Dock Ock in this case is perhaps the class of super villains that one could almost feel sorry for. The other thing that I also enjoyed was the fusion machine itself. Perhaps I'm just a mad science nerd but the whole concept of fusion is fascinating and one of my favorite science subjects. The way they showed Octavius' fusion reaction looking like a miniature version of the Sun while grossly inaccurate was really cool and how they showed the scenes of when it went out of control were well filmed and generated. In real life though a fusion reaction like that would be unimaginably bright, and would kill any unprotected human who was standing near it. This movie is perhaps the subject of many debates over this but I'm willing to brush aside real laws of physics in this one. I just can't get enough of the fusion device and the action that results from it's activation and the metal that is pulled into the fusion itself. Real fusion machines are likely much different from the one in the movie. The only major thing that I didn't get which I won't count as a flaw was why did they conduct an experiment in an unshielded apartment building in the middle of a crowded neighborhood? That's the only questionable thing I had about this movie.

 The DVD itself leaves a lot to be desired but I enjoy watching the part where they built the minature sets as well as filming the many action sequences, as well as the story behind the movies making. I still wonder why there isn't a more detailed look into how they made the fusion power machine and generating the sun-like fusion reaction itself.

 Overall, this movie is just a few yards short of being perfect! I have never seen a comic book movie work so well on improving on the greatness of it's predecessor. It is brilliant, it is highly emotional and nothing short of stunning and breathtaking! With everything I said about it, I would go far as to say that it does a greater job of improving on the first movie than ""X-Men United"" did on improving on 2000's ""X-Men"" movie. To put it this way, this is perhaps my favorite sequel of any sorts since 1986's ""Aliens"" which also improved on its scary 1979 predecessor ""Alien"".

 I strongly recommend that you get this movie as soon as possible. Believe me, there isn't any comic movie that took my world by storm like ""Spider Man 2"" did. If there is a true ""Amazing Spider Man"" movie, this is it! I guarantee it.",1107648000,5,9561,4.668449197860962

I've watched the original Spiderman time after time.  Everyone knew after they watched the original that there would be more to come.  Unfortunately no movie could ever live up to the great visions concocted in many of our imaginations.  Overall I enjoyed Spiderman 2.  The special effects were fantastic and the story line was still rather engaging.  My only complaint would be that the visions in my head will have to wait for Spiderman 3.  I totally overlooked any thoughts of Dr. Octavious.  I was expecting to Harry Osborne to put on the mask and become the new villain.  Unfortunately all Spidey fans will have to wait for that as young Osborne doesn't start to crack until the end of this film.  Overall this film is another great edition in a fantastic series.

1502448,4,B00005JMQW,"It's plot meanders and shamelessly riffs off the first movie, slams us with special effects and brazenly ends off arrogantly predicting a sequel.  Yet this could easily be one of the greatest superhero movies ever made.

SM2 picks up 2 years after the last movie.  Though the last movie ended with Mary Jane confessing her lover for Peter Parker, the two remain unconnected by the start of the new movie.  Trying to juggle college, a part-time job and saving the city from random acts of mass destruction, Peter Parker's life is a wreck.  Both Harry Osborn and MJ have moved on with their lives (and don't dodge foreclosure like Spidey has to).  After losing his job and MJ, and on the verge of flunking college, Parker begins losing his powers, and is forced to consider hanging up his sticky alter-ego for good.  Meanwhile, Parker's idol, the Brilliant physicist Otto Octavius, is on the verge of cracking the key to safe fusion power, while Harry Osborn holds Spiderman responsible for his father's death, and plots revenge.  Will there be an horrific accident at Dr. Octavius's demonstration?  Uh huh.  Will his mind become twisted as he becomes fused with a quartet of robotic arms?  You betcha.  Will he turn criminal to finance experiments that may blast NYC to kingdom-come?  Hey, is Darkman mean?

Though a special effects treat, SM2 flies on the strength of Tobey Maguire's understated performance, it also rides the steam of the other players - Rosemary Harris as a feisty Aunt May, Alfred Molina as a likeable if scary Doc Octopus (even though the script just re-writes the same characters Defoe played in the last movie) and of course JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson.  With a script padded with tons of in-jokes yet slick enough for the non-fan who doesn't even know that superhero is one word, SM2 is a rare treat.  Best of all, SM2 stays true to the every joe-a-hero theme of the first movie (a point made during a titanic battle royale between Spidey and Doc Ock on a runaway El train).

CAVEAT: The flick is, if anything, scarier than the last - a good example being the scene when the arms of the near-dead Doc-Ock come alive and tear up an OR.  If you've got an 8 year-older who loved the first movie, SM2 might still be too much.

Lastly - a flick of this scale just can't be enjoyed in full screen.",1106611200,3,2318,4.623471882640587
1502449,3,B00005JMQW,"""Spider Man 2"" is probably a good reminder that I should not read movie reviews before checking out a flick.  Roger Ebert, as I recall, has dubbed ""SM2"" the best comic-book movie adaption ever made.  Perhaps I was suffering under these high expectations, but I found ""SM2"" to be a rather pedestrian, ""safe"" story with weak characters . . . and colossal special effects that almost, but not quite, save the day.

""SM2"" opens with an imaginative comic-book montage that relates the key moments from the first movie.  As the movie opens, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is struggling mightily to keep his life afloat.  No Bruce Wayne (heir to multi-gazillion dollar Wayne Enterprises), Parker is struggling to make it as a pizza delivery boy, closet superhero, and college student.  He does the superhero thing well, the college student thing poorly (a ""genius, but lazy""), and gets fired as a delivery boy.

He's also struggling with his romance with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) . . . if romance it can be called.  Mary Jane, now a successful actress, still carries a torch for Parker and suspects that he is Spider Man, but is turned off by Parker's perpetual demonstrations of indifference.  Of course, we know that Parker is ""protecting"" her by refusing to acknowledge his love for her . . . the scenes of tortured blighted romance between these two don't quite work, as the depression gets weighty (and on several occasions MJ looks sleepy rather than sad).

Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) almost steals the show as the tortured genius scientist.  The Spider Man series appears to thrive on tragic villains . . . both the Green Goblin of the first movie and Doc Ock are ambitious-yet-decent men who get corrupted (or trapped, depending on your perspective) by the results of their ambitions.  Maybe it says something about me, but I prefer my villains to be straight villains, a la the Joker from ""Batman.""  Still, Molina offers several touching scenes and gives the best performance in the movie.

Much of the movie is given over to Parker's various struggles with his identity.  These are interesting, but begin to flag as every single aspect of Peter's life falls apart, and there is even a relatively unexplained faltering of Parker's spidey-powers which is apparently connected to Parker's psychic struggles.  Sure, it's great to have a ""human"" superhero, but this note gets hit a little too often in this movie.

The action scenes are fantastic, and are much improved over the first film, which had a slightly cartoonish air to it.  There are several scenes to marvel at, and make the movie worth seeing all on their own.

Director Raimi continues one unfortunate trend from the first movie.  Both films are pretty family-friendly -- while there is some violence, it is not very bloody at all, there is virtually no profanity, and the romance does not get beyond a few kisses.  But both films go to great lengths to include shots of voluptuous women in clingy clothing . . . and this is just jarring.  In the first film, we were treated to an inexplicable ""hello, nurse!"" shot of the lovely Ms. Dunst.  We get more of this in ""SM2"" -- the worst example coming when a character swoops down over an amazed crowd, and two women gasp in astonishment, mighty bosoms heaving mightily.  Since this was obviously a shot involving great special effects, this is not an accident.  I ask -- why?  I understand that films want to avoid being too saccharine so as to be ""uncool,"" but these cheap scenes aren't the way to go about it.

A special effects bonanza and a decent story (as well as its other dubious ""features"" make ""Spider Man 2"" a perfect film for boys aged 10-15.",1106524800,,3659,4.757527733755943

1502451,4,B00005JMQW,"I truly fail to understand why people consider this the best superhero movie ever made.  I loved the first Spider-Man film, and after seeing the trailer for Spider-Man 2, I had nothing but high hopes.  After watching it, though, I feel that while this sequel has its heart (and many other pieces) in the right place, I didn't see very much that wasn't done, and done better, in the first film.

Several things did improve:  James Franco's performance in the first Spider-Man was so self-conscious that it was almost puerile, but in the sequel he appears at home, as if suddenly freed of the weight of all those James Dean comparisons.  And Alfred Molina gives a beautiful acting turn as Dr. Octopus -- while Willem Dafoe was amusing as the Green Goblin in the first film, Molina's refusal to ham up Doc Ock made him immensely likeable from the get-go.  And Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane character is allowed to have more facets than just sweet and placating this time -- no embarrassing ""Is that an angel?"" speech this time.

But the elements which made the critics go ga-ga over this sequel are really not as developed as I would've liked them to be.  The idea that Spider-Man should abandon his calling is not a new one -- every superhero story I've seen, from the X-Men to Batman, from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Tru Calling, from Dragonball Z to Saint Seiya -- has mined this concept.  And Spider-Man 2 doesn't cut deep enough into Peter Parker's frustrations with his powers.  Many of his ""I'm giving up"" scenes are repetitive -- when his spider powers fail, we get two almost identical scenes where no webbing shoots out of his wrist and he falls.  Amusing, but doesn't help move the through-line forward.  Peter's conversations with Aunt May are the most obvious Hollywood spill-your-guts exposition scenes, one-dimensional, tired and uninteresting.  Most grievously, Peter's relationship with Mary Jane goes around in circles, never progressing.  After already having given her up in the first film to pursue his calling, Peter's dilly-dallying with Mary Jane is painfully tiresome.  An emotional cat-and-mouse with the two character could have been involving and dramatically important.  Peter always falls back on a loop of ""I want you, I want you not"", and by the time the ending finally rolls along, I wanted Mary Jane to just marry the other guy and get it over with.  And the second act of this film drags horribly, with Doc Ock's progress on his (not-so) nefarious plan coming to a standstill while we segue off into Peter's personal life.  The first film did a far better job at advancing the emotional plot and the supervillain plot simultaneously.  The running times of the two films are not too far apart, but the first film felt much more compact.  There were actually a couple of small spots in Spider-Man 2 where I felt bored and almost apathetic -- which I didn't even come close to feeling on the first Spider-Man.

Does this mean Spider-Man 2 is a failure?  No, because while I thought the emotional layers weren't probed deeply enough, the action-adventure elements still work great.  Spider-Man's fight with Doc Ock on top of a clock tower is spectacular, the finale is suitably engaging and action-packed, and the centerpiece of the movie -- where Spider-Man has to stop an elevated subway train from sailing off the edge -- is a real adrenalin pumper, with an unexpectedly moving end to the scene.  This was much more what I'd expected out of the rest of the film, where one element of the original Spider-Man film (the New York camaraderie) was expounded on, improved, and made more resonant.  Just this scene alone is worth the four stars I give to this film.

The outlook is good for the next Spider-Man film -- as long as they don't commit a 'Batman and-Robin'-sized blunder.  If they can complicate the issues Peter Parker and Mary Jane face and take some more risks with the relationship, then it probably *will* be one of the best superhero films of all time.

1502452,4,B00005JMQW,"Spiderman 2 has been labeled by many as the greatest superhero movie ever at best, and at least a very good movie probably better than the first.  So, I had high hopes going into this movie knowing I thoroughly enjoyed the first.

The strength of the series lies in the relationships between Peter Parker, Mary Jane and Harry Osborne (Tobey McGuire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco).  These three people are ordinary people with ordinary problems like everyone else.  I enjoyed both movies because of the interaction and conflict between these characters.

The primary plot of the story, aside from Doc Ock, is Peter's love for Mary Jane.  Peter doesn't want to get close to her in fear of him being Spiderman coming back to hurt her.  This is the big problem I have with the movie.  The movie does such a great job of centering the entire conflict in the movie around Peter loving Mary Jane but constantly disappointing her.  A great way to resolve this would be for Peter to win Mary Jane's heart without Spiderman having anything to do with it.  Unfortunately, director Sam Raimi takes the easy way out and throws away the conflict between Peter and Mary Jane at the end.

This obviously isn't a story you can carry on forever.  Mary and Peter had to get together sooner or later.  I just wish that it hadn't happened so easily.

Overall, this is a good, solid movie, and the ending sets it up for a great Spiderman 3.",1106092800,,1420,4.583333333333333

This is about when Peter Parker is at college and he is really getting overworked being Spider-Man and being a college student. He lives in a run-down apartment. He finds out that his childhood friend, Mary Jane, is getting married. Peter really starts to hate being Spider-Man and he starts losing his confidence. When he loses it his spider attributes start to change. He can't web sling anymore. He can't walk up walls either. Also he reveals to his mother that he is the one that caused the killing his dad. She is terrified but she starts to forgive him. It's a wonderful movie and I can't wait until Sam Raimi makes Spider-Man 3!

1502540,3,B00005JMQW,"Several critics and filmgoers have named ""Spider-Man 2"" as the greatest superhero movie ever made. However, I disagree with that notion. ""Spider-Man 2"" feels more like a part of a ""Greek tragedy"" than a superhero film. The film is too much of a downer, with tragedy after tragedy taking place, before the film's uplifting-but-unimpressive climax. The actors do what they can, and the film features some impressive fight sequences and visual effects, but nothing saves the movie from a depressing, highly melodramatic story. Not only is this a disappointing sequel to ""Spider-Man,"" but it is also a fairly poor entry into the pantheon of superhero films. If this is indeed part of a ""greek tragedy,"" then we know where ""Spider-Man 3"" is heading.

Instead of viewing one film inferior to the other I feel that ""Spider-Man 2"" should be viewed as the logical extension of an ongoing saga.  The first film did an excellent job of explaining the origins of Spider-Man.  The second film explores what it actually means to be Spider-Man.  Essentially Peter Parker-Spider-Man is in the midst of an identity crisis here.  Tobey Maguire does an excellent job in showing the angst of being a superhero.  Kirsten Dunst, once again, glows as Mary Jane Watson.  Alfred Molina is outstanding as Otto Octavius-Doc Ock.  It's refreshing that the filmmakers have cast an actor for their appropriateness for the role instead of some major star who just bring their name to the proceedings i.e. the ""Batman"" films.  Once again Sam Raimi brings a sure hand to the proceedings and Alvin Sargent should be commended for writing a script that adds depth and shading to the characters.",1105488000,2,1026,4.947368421052632
1502544,5,B00005JMQW,"Just when I was beginning to consider boycotting the endless stream of painfully bad sequels pouring out of Hollywood (""The Matrix Reloaded"", ""The Matrix Revolutions"", ""Shrek 2"", ""Alien vs. Predator"", ""Princess Diaries 2"", ""Ocean's 12"", ""Scooby Doo 2"", ""Barbershop 2""), in swoops ""Spider-Man 2,"" the latest comic-book-turned-smash-hit-film-franchise featuring the everyman's superhero, Peter Parker/Spider Man, played perfectly by the versatile Tobey Maguire.  And guess what, ""Spider-Man 2"" is even better than the first one!

Picking up where the smash-hit ""Spider-Man"" left off, audiences are treated to a truly pulse-pounding, involving story complete with a few tear-jerking moments, breathtaking special effects, solid acting by a solid cast including Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and Alfred Molina, and astonishing action that doesn't compromise the quality of the film ala ""The Matrix"" sequels.

This is an intelligent, touching, and wonderfully-paced film that really threw me for a loop as I realized just how powerful a movie based on a comic book series could be!  I loved the way director Sam Raimi takes the trademark quote from the original, ""With great power comes great responsibility"" and weaves it in as the very soul of this film.  With such a powerful core, ""Spider-Man 2"" focuses on all the right aspects of the young Spider-Man, connecting him beautifully to the audience and really drawing us into his psyche.  This is what separates ""Spider-Man 2"" from most action films out there right now.

1502546,4,B00005JMQW,"Far from being a cookie cutter movie, Spiderman 2 offers a lot that will definitely keep it as one of the most live action movies that will probably have more hot and exciting sequels. The two motivating factors that I found intriguing and what gives a debate around the plot of the movie is the use of nannotechnology or in this case 'nannowires' and fusion technology that makes scenes and storylines appears more of a reality than a fiction. Believe it or not we aren't too far away that nannochips and the technology that surrounds the use of molecular technology will by far replaced most conventional forms of technology we see today. In fact a world driven by nannotechnology will reflect the depth and nature of the problems we have today--such as an ever growing population crises exarcabeted with recent events such as the recent Asian tsunami crises and perhaps growing regional instablility along with subsequent massive wars. If indeed there would be required more usage of nannotechnology, the way we see life and tackle our daily social and cultural problems will in due time place a radical stronghold on the debates and the approach of future public policy.

Spiderman 2 like most of the comic book series is set supposedly in New York City, a city that is recovering from the fears of terrorism from the recent World Trade Center. Some of the scenes in the movie  such as the fact when Spideman lose his mask and the crowd around him saw his face and  responded that they won't tell anybody who he is reflects as what the director would assume that people make great and enlightening choices but there is in the world we live in stuff like that going on everyday and subsequently about to happen.

Scientific accomplishment such as cold fusion as we see with Doctor Octopus only states that evils comes from the megolamania of scientific and economic achievement, nothing more than a part of human nature. Of course whether or not cold fusion ever really happened because of the claims that it did happened remains questionable but if ever in the events the likelihood of such achievement were ever to occur, there will be bound to be, de novo institutions, individuals and entities that poses societal, international and public danger and threat  that is unforeseen.  That is what makes the future future and the past just history.

Though the movie itself might come off simple it is just that some of the points and motifs that it is surrounded by allows the script more to be work with. In my opinion, expect a lot from the next couple of sequels.",1105488000,,2569,4.746636771300448

1502616,4,B00005JMQW,"""With great power comes great responsibility"". Director Sam Raimi, Screenwriter Alvin Sargent, and the Spider-Man Producers all seem to appreciate this fact. Following the runaway success, both critically and commercially, of the original film, in Spider-Man 2 they have expertly crafted an exciting action film, with surprising depth. As Raimi and Sargent have chosen to focus on their characters and story as much as the amazing SFX and action sequences, the end result is a plot-driven, roller-coaster ride filled with action, suspense, drama, and romance.

The very talented and creative Stan Lee created Spider-Man for Marvel Comics. (Lee is also responsible for the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, Iron Man, and the Hulk). Spider-Man made his debut in 1962 in a comic book series - Amazing Fantasy 15. Spider-Man was immediately popular, and the series was quickly renamed Amazing Spider-Man. Indeed, the growing popularity of Spider-Man helped Marvel Comics to become the dominant comic-book publisher by the early 1970s.

In 2002, Spider-Man: The Motion Picture came to the big screen. With a cumulative box office gross of over $US800 million, Spider-Man happily sits in the Top 10 of all-time box-office films. Apart from its great commercial success, Spider-Man was also warmly greeted by critics and comic-book fans alike.

A long-time Spider-Man fan, Raimi, and star Tobey Maguire had both contracted for three Spider-Man films (before the script for the first one was even written), so following the success of the first film, sequels were inevitable.

Thus, the arrival of Spider-Man 2 was not a surprise. Spider-Man 2 also earning a place in the all-time Top Ten Box Office films was also not a surprise. The amazing CGI, visual effects and SFX generally in the sequel were not a surprise. Furthermore, the breath-taking stunts and gripping action set pieces were not a surprise either. What was surprising about Spider-Man 2 was the depth of the story and characters.

What I, and I imagine most people, love about Peter Parker/Spider-Man is that despite being a super hero, he is spared none of the problems of ordinary life: He has ups and downs with his friends, family, and employers. He struggles to get or keep a girlfriend. He gets sick and he definitely gets tired. A bit of a geek, he's ""intelligent but lazy"". A genuine nice guy, with a good sense of humour. Indeed, he's often referred to as ""your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man"". Peter's an ordinary young bloke, with an amazing gif, which he chooses, with great responsibility, to use for the good of humanity.

In Spider-Man 2 we find Peter (Tobey Maguire) at the end of his tether. He's struggling to hold on to his job, pay the rent, and pass his exams. Furthermore, he seems to be losing his Spider-Man powers. And, the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is engaged to another man. To make matter worse, his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), blames Spider-Man for his father's death, and is seeking revenge, and Peter's Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is about to be kicked out of her house.

A strong theme in Spider-Man 2 is choice: Consumed by insecurity and inner turmoil, the strain of being a super-hero permanently on call is taking its toll. Peter's secret identity is a weight on his shoulders that he no longer wishes to bear. Peter must choose between what he wants to do and what he feels he must do.

Instead of creating a stand-alone film, Raimi has opted to further explore the characters and relationships he set up in the first film. All the main characters in Spider-Man 2 have dreams: Peter dreams of an ordinary life where he can pursue his love for Mary Jane, and his love of science and photography; Mary Jane dreams of success as an actress, and of being happily married; and Dr. Otto Octavius dreams of creating a new energy source through fusion. And this brings us to our villain . . .

Every hero is measured by their nemesis, the villain, and unlike the Hulk, Spider-Man 2 is not all soul-searching. Dr. Otto Octavius (a wonderfully restrained and subtle performance by Alfred Molina) is a good-hearted and genius scientific researcher, working for Oscorp. Peter admires Octavius, just as he did Norman Osborn (before Osborn became the Green Goblin). Octavius dreams of creating cheap renewable electricity through fusion. Tragically, his fusion experiment goes horribly wrong, killing Octavius' devoted wife, and leaving him with four robotic tentacles (""actuators"") fused into his spinal cord. The evil AI of the actuators soon begin controlling Octavius, and the mild mannered scientist degenerates into Doc Oct, a cruel, selfish man, driven by vengeance, and hell-bent on achieving his fusion dream no matter what the costs.

First of all, this movie was way way too overhyped.  The only reason I saw it was because of how great everyone said it was.  Whatever they saw in it that made it ""great"", I did not.

The characters are all uninteresting and unlikeable.  Peter Parker's friend and him seem to be strangely close, almost gay with each other, while Parker avoids Mary Jane and wonders why she's dissapointed with him.  Doc Ock was a lame villan because he had no substance to him.  All he was was a fat man with some claws attached to him.  All in all, unimpressive.

The CGI effects were also very poor and unconvincing, at some points laughable.  Again, unimpressive.

Lastly, it was very non believable.  At least with the first Spider-Man you had some moments that were kind of believable.  This one is just rediculous though.  Spiderman falls off a freaking building, and gets right back up, not only once but twice.

Very young children may want to to take care before watching this as there are a few shocking scenes, including one were Doc Ock brutally kills all the doctors in a hospital room, and there are a few violent scenes, but nothing to bad.

Infact, the thing I think is the best about this movie are the scenes showing how Peter is having to cope with all the things in his life. It shows him trying to win Mary Jane's heart back, although I feel this makes the film seem more like a romance, than an action movie.

There are only a few action sequecnes in the film, but they are quite long and are very well thought out, such as the highlight of the movie: the train fight.

This in itself nullifies all allegedly intellectual reviews that argue the depth of plot or portrayal, or the fact that characters as Octavius were or were not believable. Believable? Is the very premise of a guy in spandex with ""spider powers"" believeable?

This being the case, one must move beyond the obvious, being particularly careful not to be influenced by any preconceived expectations negative or positive that come with such a highly-publicized film, and take it as it is. In other words: was the movie well-crafted, emotionally fulfilling; did it have a meaningful story line, did the characters have chemistry . . ?

I hadn't seen the first movie, nor had I any impression of it or this, its sequel. I had no idea of its popularity or failure, I had no knowledge of its director, actors, or even the comic books on which it was based. As a result I saw it through indifferent eyes, but once doing so, I walked out decidedly impressed.

It's a tale of psychological depth and meaning. It's a movie of unique direction: well-crafted in its scenes and symbolism. It tells it's story without apology: not afraid to make its hero troubled (surprising in our soulless society) or even to delve into the problems of an over-seventy aunt. It's an unusual film in its broadness: not afraid to use comedy, technology, action, and human drama to portray the diversity of the human condition. Yet it balances these elements with the type of nuanced timing that keeps them from seeming disjunct or becoming thrematically fatiguing. In the same way the actors are seamlessly joined together by great chemistry, making the characters seem alive.

  . . . A very, very well done film. Then when you consider it's a movie based on a stereotypical comic book character: it's excellent.

But my suggestion isn't that you take my word for it, but that you judge it for your self . . . without any bias derived from this or any other review.",1104710400,,2148,4.651715039577836
1502703,4,B00005JMQW,"I grew up reading comics as a kid, and Spidey was always my favorite.  Several decades later, I'm still enjoying the action and antics of NYC's one and only photog/arachnid.  This terrific sequel took the strengths of the first Spidey outing and built on them.

Tobey Maguire is terrific as Peter and Spidey.  The humanity of Peter struggling with school, job, and love life is engaging, sad, and funny.  Kirsten Dunst, not to be outdone, brings more to Mary Jane this time around.  She loves Peter, but is not going to wait for him to make up his mind.  Alfred Molina is also fantastic as Doc Ock.  He, too, brings a real humanity to his alter ego.  As a dedicated scientist he simply can not let a lifetime of work evaporate, and is driven to take the necessary steps to see his work to its completion.  Finally, props gotta go out to JK Simmons who literally rips J Jonah Jameson from the page and breathes life into the character.

Some of the comedy was a bit over the top.  Some of it was ironic, and dead-on(such as the nod to the infamous Seabiscuit injury).  All in all, a great mix of action, romance, laughs, and sheer adrenaline.  The movie isn't perfect.  I'm especially leery about the direction we're headed for number 3, and its villain.  C'mon folks...  Give us Venom.

1502704,4,B00005JMQW,"Spiderman 2 is a great movie and has recieved tons of accolades so I went into it expecting the best.  It lives up to its billing.  All of the characters are back.  Tobey McGuire is great as the bumbling Peter Parker who has to deal with the pressures of leading a normal life while at the same time being a super hero.  Kristen Dunst is beautiful as the vulnerable Mary Jane who deep down loves Peter but has been able to move on to another man.  James Franco is good as the tormented Harry Osborne who values Peter as a friend but is still haunted by his father's death by Spiderman.

Warning: spoiler below

Doctor Otto Octavious is being sponsored by Oscorp and Harry to develop a new form of energy.  When that goes wrong, Otto becomes Doc Ock, a man with 4 metal tentacles with a mind of their own.  The usual dual with Spiderman follows, but the heart of this movie lies in the characters and the dilemmas they face.  In the end, we'll see Dr. Octavious redeem himself in spite of the tentacles that have fused themselves to his spine.

Harry continues his quest to discover the identity of Spiderman.  Harry makes several discoveries that will be key plot points of the sequel.

But the best part of the plot is between Mary Jane and Peter.  Peter loves Mary Jane but doesn't want to get involved with her, fearing him being Spiderman might harm her.  Thus, Peter appears very irresponsible and Mary Jane assumes he doesn't like her and he has let her down so many times she just doesn't want to see him anymore.  As a viewer, I wanted Peter to somehow let Mary Jane know he does love her and redeem Peter in her eyes.  But unfortunately, this never happens.

The movie takes a surprising turn in the end and throws all the conflict between Mary Jane and Peter away by revealing in the battle with Doc Ock that Peter is really Spiderman.  Thus, all of the doubts Mary Jane had with Peter are washed away without Peter, or the movie having to expend any effort.

The superman movies allowed Lois to discover that Clark was Superman and it hurt that series.  I can't help but wonder if Spiderman 3 will be hurt by the fact that Spidey's identity is known.",1104710400,,2161,4.406565656565657
1502705,1,B00005JMQW,"I can honestly say that this was the WORST film I have seen this year.  While I had some excitement for this film, due to the amazing sequel known as X2: X-Men United, what I actually witnessed was nothing more than an unlimited budget creating some of the least creative characters in film history.  I had several friends tell me that this was one of the best ""character study"" films of the year.  That this sequel was more than just good vs. evil, but also an inner dilemma between Parker's personal lives and that which he has been called to do.  While this may have been the case, what actually translated onto the screen was a reassurance that Toby Maguire was miscast, Kirsten Dunst is loosing her sexual appeal (though Raimi felt enough self-guilt to place her in water to reveal her ""bits and pieces"" for the pre-teen in all of us), and that you can go too far with a villain creating a cartoon instead of a physically frightening creature.

So, where do I begin?  At first I had hope, here we find ourselves following Peter as he attempts to get to work after noticing that he was running late.  He has just a few minutes to deliver some pizzas (oh, how the mighty do fall) or he will be fired from his job.  He apparently really needs this job, so he resorts to transforming himself into his alter-ego personality Spider-man to help him get out of the tight situation.  While we are stunned by this cheap display of his super powers, we assume that it will show that Spider-man is a crafty guy.  Immediately, we are proved wrong as Peter Parker is fired and forced to go back to his run-down apartment that he cannot afford.  Instead of showing us a hero for children to look up to, we have a guy that says to the youth of our nation, be late to work, don't pay rent, and everything will be just fine.  This is not the character that I was hoping for.  This only leads us deeper into the mind of Peter Parker as he struggles to maintain a very busy life.  Also saying to our children that if you have too much to do, please just give up.  When life throws you lemons, go ahead and cry like the babies that you are, or at least like Toby Mcguire has patented.

Spider-man is not the hero for our youth.  He is not the passionate crime-fighter that we have envisioned or at least that was drawn for me in the first film.  Instead, Toby is given the possibility to ""grow"" his character and give him ""5000 dimensions"" that continually fail.  He uses the technique of huge-teary eyes to portray the struggle that is happening inside of him.  He never really feels strong.  He never really makes a decision.  He only does what the villain forces him to do.  He continually remains indecisive and weak through all moments of this film.  I lost respect of his heroine status.  I instead saw him as this whiney kid that couldn't handle the pressures of the job that he was handed.  He cries, and is wimpy instead of showing a true emotional struggle.  This only proved to me that you couldn't take an independent actor, one that prides himself on the dramatic element, and give him a role in a huge-budget film.  I once thought of this in the first film, but this sequel only proves my theory correct.

This goes the same for Kirsten Dunst, who progressively became uglier throughout the film and whose bosoms fluctuated in size in nearly every shot.  She was drenched yet again for the pre-teen audience and for those that like to use the stop-motion feature on their DVD player.  She was useless, and perhaps should be replaced for the third installment to this series.  Finally, there was the unsupportive villain that seemed less ""evil"" and more like a cartoon Elmer Fudd, constantly messing up and not really causing any chaos or destruction.  He didn't frighten the people of Spider-man's city, so why should I be frightened of him?  Molina was horribly cast as Doc Ock, only proving that a large man with tons of robotic work can be evil, or at least try to be evil.

Finally, I would like to say that Raimi needs to go back to his roots.  For me to ever be interested in one of his films again (especially after this sequel), I would need to see Raimi go back to his roots.  He needs less money, better scripts, and an unknown cast that can prove themselves and try something new.  All I could see in this film was the strong hold of Hollywood telling Raimi how he needs to create the film and what scenes would be needed to ensure tons of people going into the theater to give their money to these characters.  It was sad, it was poor, and it was an inexcusable issue.  Raimi is a ""cult"" film director that has eyes the size of Toby whenever money is thrown his way.  This was a very poor film.  It was exactly what Hollywood represents and the type of film that I despise.  There was no substance, no structure, and nothing exciting about this sequel.  It was, for lack of a better word, very poor.  I am embarrassed to say that I have seen this film, and will deny it whenever anyone asks.  This is my final word on this film.  Good-bye!

1502707,5,B00005JMQW,"When he called Spidey 2 the ""Greatest Superhero movie,"" he was right on the nose. Ebert's reviews are usually completely against my thoughts of a movie, but this time we agreed 100%. This movie is fantastic.

I hated the first one. Let me get that outta the way. It was an 'okay' movie, but with Sam Raimi directing, I expected *A Lot* better, and getting the mediocrity I did in watching it, it's caused me to hate it. But this movie, which I was really unsure about, ended up being Fantastic. Everything the first one should have been, this one is. It's got the emotional impact the story needs, it's got a very well cast Doc Ock, and, of course, it's got Bruce Campbell. He's only in one scene, but when he appeared, I stood up and cheered in the theater. I'm sure many of the folks out there understand.

The movie isn't perfect, mind you. They should've cut a few of the endings. It seemed to end three times. Plus, if it were about 10 minutes shorter, it'd be a lot easier to watch. Some of it just seemed a bit slow. Plus, Peter Parker, as in the first film, seems to be a complete knucklehead. Maybe that's what Sam was striving for: A very bright person, but not one with a load of common sense. I know a great many people like that...

But, these are all very minor complaints, and don't really take away from the movie. For $16.49 here on Amazon, you'd be nuts not to buy it immediately.",1104624000,4,1398,4.307984790874524

1502709,1,B00005JMQW,"There was nothing Amazing or Spectacular in the Web of Spider-man 2. It truly is the one of worst movies ever made plain and simple. I don't understand how people constantly deride Batman and Robin and Catwoman but call this horrible film the best superhero movie of all time. At least Batman and Robin and Catwoman were movies that focused on one story and paced so they didn't to put you to sleep. This slow boring sequel didn't know what it wanted to be about. Spider-Man 2 tries to be an action movie, a comedy, a romance and an art house film all at once. This movie has such a bad case of ADHD you need Ritalin just to view the DVD.

The posters and the trailers feature big action sequences between Spider-man and Doc Ock. That's false advertising. Only about ten percent of the movie has Spider-man fighting Doc Ock. Sixty percent of the movie focuses on the hard times of Peter Parker and his blubbering about how bad his life is. That's totally out of character for Peter Parker. Peter Parker would not act like the pitiful Midol abusing leg waxer featured in this movie. He loves his aunt and would do anything for her. He would not stand idly by as she was about to lose her house. He wouldn't be taking art photos to submit to the Daily Bugle knowing that Jameson wants only pictures of Spider-Man and those are his bread and butter. Peter Parker doesn't take his mask off in public for anyone (read the comics and watch the 90's animated series) because he fears that his enemies will get his family. He wouldn't be worrying about hurting Mary Jane; as a matter of fact he'd be dating someone else like Gwen Stacy, Betty Brant, or Deborah Whitman and getting on with his life. Watching this movie I wondered what happened to the confident young man of the first movie and the comics who took his problems in stride. I kept asking myself how did confident Peter Parker turn into an insecure whiny twerp like Dawson Leery?

In addition to being totally out of character, for Peter Parker, this repetitive irrelevant footage (over an hour of it) does nothing to advance the story and slows the pacing of this movie to a crawl. I would like to ask Mr. Raimi what was the purpose of the scenes with the Landlord's daughter? The scene with Peter at the Laundromat, the scene where he saves the kid in the burning building, Aunt May's speech about heroes, the entire idiotic ""Raindrops"" sequence. The lady strumming the violin. The ridiculous overdone train battle in Midtown Manhattan (I live in New York and there are NO els in Manhattan.) What was with all the SCREAMING? Why does Peter take off his mask in public when he's so concerned about his enemies finding out his identity? Doesn't that contradict your own story a few minutes earlier? What did you do with over $200 million in Sony's money? How did an action packed Spider-Man movie turn into scraps that belonged on the cutting room floor?

The other thirty percent of the film focuses on Mary Jane and her frustration at Peter Parker. How did the bright, bubbly strong independent woman of the first movie get replaced with this annoying whiney Joey Potter/ Lana Lang/ Mary Camden/ Felicity Porter WB network knock-off? Her story seems to be just another way for the writer to pile problems on poor Peter Parker. By the time Spidey finally confronts Doc Ock in the bank I was rooting for OCK to kill Spider-man so I could stop watching this horrible movie.

Clearly the actors aren't at fault. Tobey Maguire, Kristen Dunst act well in spite of the horrible script given them. James Franco is clearly frustrated here; you can see it in his performance. It's justified; they give him absolutely nothing to do in this screenplay except pout and pimpsmack Parker. Rosemary Harris is the only one who overcomes the puerile script and takes Aunt May to a new level. J.K. Simmons is still a scene-stealer here as J. Jonah Jameson. The producers of this movie did a terrible disservice to Alfred Molina. His role is so underdeveloped that we don't clearly know what he wants or why he wants it. His character doesn't even feel dangerous or threatening; he's just fodder to feed the franchise. The only bad actor here really is the CGI; it's actually worse than it was in the first movie. We really could have done without those ridiculous green toy helicopters in the end.

It's clear to me Sam Raimi's hands were tied by the horrible screenplay and producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. They try to apply the Smallville model of storytelling to the Spider-Man franchise and fail miserably. If you've watched that show you know how slow it is and how underdeveloped the characters are. Most of the show (at least 45 minutes of each episode) focuses on Lana and Clark fawning over each other. And that's the big problem here. This wasn't a Spider-man sequel; it's a Smallville movie with Spider-Man's name on it.

As a longtime comic fan I anxiously anticipated seeing Spider-Man 2 all year. Having seen the film I have never been so disappointed in my life. I feel so cheated by this movie that I will not be seeing Spider-Man 3 or any other future films in the franchise. If you have to see it, borrow it from the library or borrow it from a friend. This one isn't worth paying Marvel Value Stamps for.",1104364800,17,5269,4.594048884165781
1502710,5,B00005JMQW,"This is quite enjoyable movie, and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys fictional heroic movies (i.e. everything from Star Wars to Lord of the Rings). I absolutely love movies with three dimensional villains. Too many super-hero movies have villains that are simple and easy to understand. The Green Goblin in the first Spider-man movie was a good step away from this, but I don't think we saw enough of his personal struggle against the Goblin. However, in this movie we see the transformation and eventual return of Dr. Oct in full color.

I also thought that the transformations that Peter went through were very interesting to watch, and there were many scenes that had nice touches. I also loved the introduction of more characters that play parts in Spider-man's world, like John Jameson and Dr. Conners. However, the producers had said that there will only be three movies total, so the series might end of up being a disappointment because there will be only three of the many villains showcased.

Overall, watching the movie was a quite enjoyable experience, but there were a couple things that annoyed me: elevated railways in manhattan? That's Chicago! And the ""fusion"" reaction was really unbelievable. Spider-man always has some degree of suspension of disbelief, but it isn't too outrageous (for example, by simply inserting spider genes into goats they produce spider silk). However, the so called ""sun"" was completely unbelievable and has no basis in fact whatsoever. Oh well, it's just a movie and as such was very good.",1104278400,2,1543,5.0
1502767,4,B00005JMQW,"Spider-Man II is by far a better movie than the first. The only thing it was lacking was a Lucy Lawless cameo, although Ted Rami did make up for all of that. The spider man II has improved on the mistakes the first one made in such a phenomenal way, I couldn't help but watch the entire thing in awe. Plus the movie was free of all corny scenes like the one in the first movie when the Green Goblin was about skewer Spider-man who happened to be holding on for his life while keeping a trolley of children from falling from their deaths, but was then attacked by a bunch of New Yorkers on the bridge. The Goblin didn't even try to kill them or something. Corny.

The story doesn't exactly pick up where the last movie left off (since the movie didn't start with Spider-man swinging over NYC), but with a simple narrative by the overwhelmed Peter Parker who has far too much on his mind and far too much to do in such a small amount of time while at the same time try to Juggle being Spider-man and Peter Parker at the same time.

Peter is constantly fired from his job the daily bugle and other part time jobs and his grades in collage are falling fast because of his constant reversal roles; his relationship with Harry Osborne and Mary Jane Watson grows farther apart as well. His life takes a nose dive when Harry takes him to meet Doctor Otto Octavious, who has an unexpected accident with a machine he was creating. Thus the turmoil of Peter Parker begins anew. Unlike most sequels for movies, SM-II doesn't jump right into the action nor does it focus solely on the action itself because the producers think since they've explained the story in the first movie they'll jump right into the action and barely focus on a storyline. Spider-man remains to be one of the most story driven superheroes around; it focuses on the humanity of the characters and their own personal struggles while at the same time maintaining Spider-man's witty humor.

The animation in the movie was done superbly. It was hard to tell if they used CGI imagery in someone of the action and spider-man scenes, although there were moments when it was painstakingly noticeable (Doctor Octopus' arms and movements, the runaway light-rail scene *I was expecting that nonetheless*, and most of the destroyed environments in the movie). It was easy on the eyes and nicely detailed to the smallest piece of glass.

The Characters in SM-II remain the same with a few maturity tweaks; While Mary Jane is still musing over the fact that Peter won't tell her the truth, she doesn't try to pry it out of him (Like Lana and most of the characters of Smallville) but does give him a hard way to go when he tries to explain things. Harry still despises Spider-man and is no more charming than he was in the first movie, and Aunt May.... well she rmains to be the same old wise lady with more screen time added into the mix. However, there was something missing from Doctor Octopus' character; there seemed to be no rhyme or reason as to why he wanted to rebuild his machine besides the fact that voices in his head (his mechanical arms) were telling him to do so. He was missing a villainous vibe and personality to him, he just seemed to be robbing banks and stealing things for the sheer sake of it (but most villains do, but at least they had a motivation, an objective. Doc Oct didn't).

But all in all the movie was solid in places I had believed it would be lacking, a great movie for marvel comic fans and newcomers. [a 4 out of 5]",1104192000,,3859,4.499286733238231
1502768,2,B00005JMQW,"I really enjoyed the first Spider-Man film. It was one of the best movies of 2002. I liked it so much, in fact, I went out and bought a personal copy for my home collection. I was thinking of doing the same for Spider-Man 2 before even watching it, since I have heard its surpasses the first from most of the people I have talked to. Instead I rented it, and I was expecting something amazing. What did I get instead of that? A corny, bubble gum piece of fluff. Spider-Man 2 was just a very predictable movie without much of a well played out story, unlike the first one which unfolded really well. Kirstein Dunst, Tobey Mcguire and the rest of the cast can hardly act. They were horrible, with goofy, cheesey lines that I felt embarresed to even listen to at times. I also didn't like the plot very much, even though I really dig comic book films and I love the art style. Needless to say, the special effects were top notch, and the action wasen't too shabby. The rest of the movie falls flat though, unfortunately. I want the two hours and ten minutes of my life back! Well, this was another lousy 2004 movie and another Hollywood big name box office cash in. I'm telling you, only rent it if you must see it! Do NOT purchase it for any price. You'll be sorry.

The story seemed to be written by a 4th grader, the cinematography was so choppy, the characters so poorly developed - and the acting was beyond weak. I actually liked Tobey Maguire being selected and thought he was a good fit in the first movie but in the sequel he seemed so pathetic. When the movie began, I jokingly said to my husband that apparantly Spiderman meets his demise by suicide since his life is such crap. There were so many sub plots that never went anywhere - the annoying friend, the annoying landlord, the annoying landlord's daughter, Aunt Mae moving out - where is a good edit when you need it?

1502771,5,B00005JMQW,"This, along with the first Spider Man movie, is the best super hero movie ever.  You just can't really do better than this.

This is one of those rare action flicks where the hero is actually more interesting than the villan.  Rather than waiting around for Peter Parker to turn into Spider Man, you will become completely engulfed in Parker's life.  Seeing him tear up over seeing Mary Jane with another man damn near made me tear up.  Okay, it did make me tear up.

One of the most moving moments of the film is when Spider Man is finally recognized as a hero by the passengers on the L-Train.  Powerful comic book/mythological stuff!

And the light touches are great, too!  Street musicians perform different versions of a familiar Spider Man song throughout the film, and it is just delightful and funny.

The soundtrack is great as well.  Danny Elfman is in top form, and the song selection is as fitting as any Scorcece(sp?) film.

When Spider Man loses his powers, ""Rain Drops"" paints a perfect picture of Peter Parker's ""dumb"" happiness at having the hero burden lifted from his mind.

This is a comic book-based movie as it should be done.  True to the original source material, but condensed into a two hour film.

Sam Raimi should direct the inevitable upcoming Superman movies as well.  His love and respect for the comic books that these films are based on shines through like no other super hero movies that have been brought to the silver screen.

Take out all of the action, and there is a bona-fide unrequitted love story here.  Awesome!",1104019200,,1554,4.650735294117647
1502772,5,B00005JMQW,"Most people moan and complain about sequels once they are out. And even when they are only mentioned. For a long time sequels are looked down upon, and are almost never as good as the original. But a superior sequel, while rare, does happen. Just look at ""Aliens"" and ""Terminator 2"", among few others. And so Sam Raimi and his cast and crew have done one of those rare hollywood achievements. A big Hollywood sequel that's so much better than the original. Not saying anything about part 1, of course. Here, with a bigger budget, more dazzling effects, a better, more interesting villain, and a more richly textured script and story with more heart and meaning, the films eclipses the first one on all levels. I am surprised with how well I took in the franchise because I was never a Spider-Man fan when I was little. Knew absolutely nothing about it. What a surprise. Tobey Maguire returns as Peter Parker, still a young kid now in college, who is trying desperatley to keep his life together, although with school, a job, and being a web slinging superhero, it's not going very well. Enter Dr. Otto Octavius(Alfred Molina), a brilliant scientist whose recent research is funded by Peter's good friend, Harry Osborne(James Franco), who is out for revenge against Spiderman who he thinks killed his father. Things go bad when Dr. Octavius' new experiment foes horribly awry(don't they always?), and soon his tentacle arms he created are now a part of his body. Instead of getting help, the tentacles become more ominous and soon Doc Ock(as he is now referred too)begins to go mad to continue his research. What will he get?. Harry offers Doc Ock whatever he needs, if he brings Spiderman to him. Besides all that, there is the ongoing story of Peter's love for the lovely Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst). And this is what's so great about the movie, and how it foes against the expected Hollywood conventions. The action and all of the superhero aspect of the movie is not what's important. It's not what's going on here. It's not how to make it bigger and bigger and throw in a storyline here to balance it out. In these movies, the movie is about the people. Not the heroics or the effects or whatever. Raimi and his writers create characters that, under some odd circumstances, are real. People we believe in. The movie doesn't come back two years later and throw these people into just another wild adventure. The characters grow as anyone in reality does, and they are where they should be in two years. They don't stay in once place. They grow and mature and the storylines develop and go further, instead of forgetting everything and just making another movie. It's about the story and characters, and in this day and age, that is so refrshing and welcomed. The actors here are as good as ever. Maguire continues to prove that he is an excellent Peter Parker, and makes a convincing super hero. Kirsten Dunst emits just a lovely radiance that really makes her seem like the sweet girl next door that anybody would fall in love with, even tho her character still kinda becomes the ""damsel in distress"" here. James Franco is good, but his obsession with revenge got old pretty fast. It was a nice story arc for him and the movie, but it got annoying. Whenever you saw him, he would just change direction and throw it in Peter's face. Or at the party when he, drunkenly, sloshes up to Peter and just starts accosting him. It just felt pushed more than anything else. Alfred Molina was so much more likeable as the villain, because he had the humanity left in him. At the end, he was the nice guy we met earlier on. Willem Dafoe, who cameos, was good, but Molina and the character of Doc Ock was just so much better. It was also nice that J.K. Simmons and Rosemary Harris got bigger roles as well. And yes, Raimi regular Bruce Campbell makes another welcomed cameo. As does Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben. Things happen in this movie that will forever change things in the next film. I won't say what they are, but it will bring a new dynamic to the ongoing storyline for Part 3. The extras on the DVD are also incredible and exhausting. Spider-Man 2 has been hailed as the best superheo movie ever, and while I have another one that takes that place, this one is definitley strong enough to take that title. This movie makes Spider-Man 3 that much more exciting. Thanks Sam.",1104019200,,4377,4.612820512820512
1502773,2,B00005JMQW,"Ok, I realize I'm in the vast minority here, but I really wasn't that impressed with this film. I felt the whole thing dragged along, until the few action sequences, which were short. The CGI, in my opinion, really wasn't too great, some scenes were just too un-realistic to carry alot of weight. One problem I had with the first film which carried over to this one through most of it was Peter Parker shutting out Mary Jane, ""for her own saftey"". Was I the only one in the entire world who felt this was totally rediculous? The second film, at the end, seemed to resolve this, until the last fade-out. The look on Mary Jane's face left me with an unsatisfied feeling. I felt Doc Ock to be well-done and well-acted, but the descent into insanity seemed a bit contrived and fast. Overall, the study of what a person must sacrifice for an ideal is touching, but perhaps too deeply involved here. This is a superhero movie after all, not a session on a shrinks' couch. Hopefully the third film in this series will better display what spidey fans have loved about the charactor for years, and be a worthy film at the same time.",1103932800,4,1123,4.456310679611651
1502774,5,B00005JMQW,"Spider-man has always been my favorite comic book hero because he was a ""regular guy"" like the rest of us.  He had girl problems, job problems, money problems, and all the other things people deal with in their day-to-day lives.  Naturally, I was concerned when I heard that they were going to make the first movie, because I thought Hollywood would focus on the super-hero stuff and downplay the human element of Spider-man that I always thought was so important.

Wrong.

I was also concerned when I heard there would be a sequel, since sequels are never as good as the first movies, right?  Sure, Doc Ock would make it interesting since he was always one of Spider-man's most formidable enemies, but I had doubts, nonetheless.

Wrong again.

This movie, like the first, has tons of heart, like a good super-hero movie should, like Spider-man should.  Doc Ock is a monster, and he isn't; Spider-man is a super-hero, and he isn't - they both grapple to come to terms with their humanity and their alter-egos at the same time.

All actors concerned turned in huge performances: Alfred Molina, Toby Maguire, and Kirsten Dunst.  I can't pick between them - they all make a believer out of me.  With only a little imagination, I could imagine myself with super powers but plagued with head problems, or a humanitarian genius becoming lost in my work, and a threat to society.  For all the above, I give this movie my highest rating - *****

The DVD package is produced very well also.  There are two discs with about eight or ten hours of extra content, interviews, ""making of"", and video game information.  I especially liked the ""Ock-umentary"" about bringing Doc Ock from the comics to the screen.  Although there is nothing super-special about the DVD extras, it is well done, nonetheless, so I give it four stars.",1103932800,,1814,4.729299363057325
1502831,5,B00005JMQW,"2004 was a year that actually saw the advent of several top notch motion pictures (""the Incredibles"" comes to mind). I'd have to say that for sheer entertainment quality, this was one of the better years for the cinema as a whole.

Unquestionably, the cream of the crop was ""Spiderman 2."" A life long Spiderman fan, and a die hard fan of the original film, I admit that I was biased when I went to see the premier.

Honestly, I suspected that this would at least be a worthy successor to the dynamic original. My only real concerns were the fact that it was churned out in just two years (quickness in sequels often suggests slipshod work) and the unoriginal title (anytime they use the same title and just suffix it with a '2' its an ominous sign that the cash machine is at work).

However, nothing could have prepared me for the mastery of the medium that Sam Raimi demonstrated with this film.

Every shot , even the quiet moments when Peter Parker is sitting in his lonely, squalid apartment contemplating the crisis in his life, is enagaging. The action sequences are jaw dropping due to clever staging and some of the best f/x work ever to grace the screen (that sequence on the subway is the best action scene ever) and the performances (particularly Alfred Molina as the diabolical Doc Ock and Tobey Maguire as the conflicted Peter) are nothing short of astounding.

The film picks up where the original left off, some two years after the fact, with Pete trying desperatly to reconcile his normal life and dreams with the repsonsiblity of being a champion for justice.

He's not terribly successful at it, and as a result unwillingly alienates the love of his life Mary Jane Watson and his best friend Harry Osborne, who is slipping further and further into psychosis, obsessed with avenging his father's death at the hands of the wall crawler.

The human relationships are given mopre depth and resonance this time around, and because we grow to genuinely care about this amazing young man who has been endowed with both a gift and a curse, the events in the film matter.

Most times - as in the awful ""Blade: Trinity"" or the later ""Batman"" films - filmmakers seem to think that we'll cheer just because 'the hero' is using some awesome superhuman moves and defeating ""the villian.""

Films that approach their protagonist on that level become boring and repetitve action films that are simply an excuse to blast the audience with high tech effects for two hours.

""Spiderman 2"" is ingenious in that it realizes by having us really like and care about Peter and the people in his life, it means that much more when he triumphs, both in battle and on a personal level. I remember upon my second viewing of this film in the theater, when Mary Jane tells Pete ""Go get 'em, tiger"", the audience went ballistic, cheering and everything. That's because we were emotionally involved .

The other aspect that raises this film above all others of its genre is that Raimi wisely used the trademark imagery that marked his indie work. Anyone who fell in love with the ""Evil Dead"" franchise or the orginal ""Darkman"" will recognize the stylized camera work in the terrifying sequnce where Doc Ock runs rampant in a  hospital ER. It is one of many subtle touches Raimi adds to the mix to remind his fans that, yes, this is the same director we know and love.

The best way to summarize this film is as follows: If you did not like ""Spiderman 2"", I recommend that you stop watching comic book films. It's doubtful that its going to get any better than this.

If theres even a modicum of honesty left in the Academy , this film will take top honors at the oscars. On all levels, both technical and in terms of plot and performance, it deserves it. This was indeed the movie of the year, and is a stunning example fo how to do it right. Bravo!!

1502832,5,B00005JMQW,"SPIDERMAN continues the Spiderman saga as Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) tries to juggle his responsibilities as a superhero and as a student at Columbia University trying to pay his rent and attend his classes. Things are not easy, to say the least---especially when a new villain arrives, in the form of Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), endowed with four cyber-intelligent tentacles that force him to continue with experiments that could put Manhattan in mortal danger. And of course Peter still has a crush on Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) still has a vendetta against Spiderman for the murder of his father.

Peter Parker feels the great burden of his responsibilities, and the ways in which he tries to deal with it is part of what makes SPIDERMAN a worthy sequel to the 2001 original. SPIDERMAN was a good genre film because, through all the special effects and action scenes, director Sam Raimi never lost track of the human element, never allowed the film to sink into a brainless action spectacle. Peter Parker the character is fully given his due, and there is a wonderful authenticity to the film's emotions-nothing artificially heightened or manipulative. SPIDERMAN 2 is emotionally richer than the original, and that is quite an accomplishment for a sequel. Even better, the special effects are slightly more convincing than they were in the first film, and there are some bravura action scenes---particularly one in which Spiderman has to use all his power to stop a moving train---that equal the best of any superhero epic.

One would be hard-pressed to think of anyone else that could have played Spiderman as convincingly as Tobey Maguire does in both films. He never expresses emotions through attention-grabbing gestures, but always stays in character beautifully. The other performances are good, but Maguire helps take the film to a higher level. SPIDERMAN 2 is a great sequel, a worthy superhero movie, and terrific entertainment. Highly recommended.",1103846400,4,2005,5.147239263803681
1502833,1,B00005JMQW,"This review is for those of you who are getting tired of superhero movies. If you're sick of these bubblegum flicks, you're probably not going to read a review on it anyway. But, if I can stop just one soul from wasting 2 hours of their life and killing some more brain cells, this review will be worth it. To start off, remember that this is Howard Stern's favorite movie franchise.

More one dimensional acting from Tobey Maguire. More horrible acting from Kirsten Dunst (her last name is so apropos). And some dreadful scenery chewing by James Franco. Be careful, that set's not dipped in chocolate, you know. What really boggles my mind are the reviews that praise the actors in this. There's some really shoddy CGI here, too. No question about it, the CGI in the first SPIDERMAN was better. The story had me yawning and yelling, ""C'mon,"" at the television. Wait a minute? What story? You know, the generic superhero story where the girl is in peril and the hero saves her at the last... blah, blah, blah. Why tell an original story when you have SPIDERMAN and CGI to pull in the crowds. Can an action flick be boring? This one is so boring, I was staring at the walls of my living room watching a real spider that was spinning a web. You also get some crummy ""B"" movie special effects at the conclusion. What the heck did they spend all that money on? Probably marketing and advertising. Even Alfred Molina couldn't save this dog of an action flick. The only reason I rented this is because Molina is such a great actor (and the first movie was somewhat decent). But, if you're looking for acting, avoid this like the plague. This is COMMERCIAL HOLLYWOOD FRANCHISE PRODUCT ENTERTAINMENT at it's worst. Save your money and buy a ""happy face"" t-shirt instead. SPIDERMAN 2 is mindless eye candy for the masses.

IT'S OFFICIAL: Ebert and Roper have lost their minds. This is a bad ""movie."" It is not a ""film."" I thought they were crazy with their RAVES for KILL BILL VOL.2, but this takes the cake. It just shows to go ya, the critics are bombarded with so much garbage, they can't even spot bad filmmaking anymore. Shame on you. I think I'll get my reviews from Henry Rollins on IFC from now on.

What happened to the Sam ""Evil Dead"" Raimi I used to know and love? He SOLD OUT to the HOLLYWOOD MONEY MACHINE. Shame on you.

When are they gonna come out with the HOGAN'S HEROES movie franchise? I want my MTV... I mean, my mindless entertainment!!

After seeing this odious movie, I swore I'd never rent another Hollywood superhero action flick. I promise I'll never review another. This one is for children under 12. You may hit the NO button now.",1103846400,8,2649,4.521920668058455
1502834,5,B00005JMQW,"Not often does a sequel surpass the original, but Spider-Man 2 does. Really, this is the best movie of 2004 and if the Academy had any sense, it would be a Best Picture nominee. Unfortunately, it is too popular a movie to win awards. However, the character development is the major piece of the plot and the action just enhances it.
Peter Parker struggles with being a regular person and a superhero. His life is in shambles and his sometime employer, J. Jonah Jameson, continues to portray Spider-Man as evil. In order to make ends meet, Peter must help him do this despite the fact Peter is Spider-Man. His personal life is in the dumper too - MJ's marrying someone else, Aunt Mae is being foreclosed on, he can't pay the rent. However, the public loves and needs Spidey.
Watching Peter struggle with all of this, lose his confidence, give up Spider-Man and try and be normal shows how great a performance Tobey Maguire puts on. Critics loved the movie, moviegoers thronged to it, now the Academy should give it and its actors the awards it deserves.
The twists and turns of this movie lead to many surprises and revelations. Bring on Spider-Man 3!",1103760000,,1150,4.642156862745098

1502836,4,B00005JMQW,"Doc Oc was always my favorite Spidey villain, so I was interested in seeing how they portrayed him. I was surprised in that they made Doctor Octopus a more ""sympathetic"" villain than the Green Goblin--Alfred Molina did an excellent job portraying him.

A lot more introspection in this movie, more internal conflict and yes, it's a slightly more depressing movie because of all the runs of bad luck Peter Parker has while trying to juggle being Spiderman and his ""normal"" life, while keeping his superhero identity hidden from his friends and relatives.  But I feel this is a realistic portrayal of the struggle somebody with a double life would be going through.

It's definitely worth having if, like me, you're a big Spidey fan--a good companion to the first one and it looks like they're setting up for a good story arc to be resolved in the third movie.

I gave it four stars because there wasn't quite as much of the clever humor as there was in Spidey 1--while they try (a scene where Parker washes his Spidey costume with his whites and dyes his underwear blue and red), the writers and director were clearly going for a more dark look at the life of a superhero.",1103673600,,1171,4.615384615384615
1502837,5,B00005JMQW,"Spiderman is back and better than ever in this highly-charged, thrilling sequel to the original.  Tobey Maguire reprises his role as Peter Parker and the web-slinging superhero.  A normal, but somewhat geeky college student, Parker springs into action as Spiderman at the first sign of danger. Kirsten Dunst is back as Mary Jane Watson.  At the end of Spidey one, Mary Jane and Peter told each other that they were in love, but Peter said that he could never be with Mary Jane.  She is now a highly successful Broadway actress who has fallen in love with an astronaut who happens to be the son of J. Jonah Jameson, the editor of the Daily Bugle.  James Franco stars as Harry Osborn.  He has taken over contol of his father's business after his death in the first movie.  (His father was the Green Goblin in Spidey 1).  Harry blames his father's death on Spiderman and vows to avenge his father by destroying Spiderman.  His company has developed a way to improve the fusion process, and with the cooperation of Dr. Otto Octavius, played by Alfred Molina, they have developed a strange set of titanium tentacles that can be controlled by the brain of the person wearing them.

However, something goes terribly wrong during a demonstration, and Dr. Octavius is forever changed as a result.  Somehow, the arms seem to have taken control of Dr. Octavius, and he is now under their power.  Determined to complete his research, Dr. Octavius turns to crime and becomes known as Doc Ock, due to his similarity to an octupus.

Soon, Doc Ock and Spiderman are fighting it out, waging battles in banks and on top of speeding commuter trains.  Ock realizes that he needs money to complete his research, so he visits Harry and makes a deal; Ock will kill Spiderman and Harry's company will give Ock the funding he needs to finish his research.

Will Ock succed in his devious plan to finish his fusion research and possibly destroy New York City in the process?  Will Spiderman stop him before its too late?  Will Peter and Mary Jane get together?  Will Harry succeed in his bid to destroy Spiderman?

I thought Spidey 2 was much better than the original.  The actors, especially Alfred Molina, give excellent performances, and the action and thrills are non-stop.  The ending of the movie is left wide-open for a possible Spidey 3.  I highly recommend this fun and action-packed movie.

Toby Maguire, Kristen Dunst, and Alfred Molina give great performances and give this sequel an emotional edge over the original and Sam Raimi goes for the jugular in the drama as well. It's very rare that a sequel is able out do the original but this one does it in spades.  I'm already on line for Spiderman 3 and I can't wait to know what happens next in the life of our favorite wall crawler. It was well worth the wait.",1103414400,,579,4.263636363636364

Some of the dialogue is very clever and funny, and the train scene was suspenseful and well done.  Alfred Molina was not villainous enough although he tried hard.  James Franco looked deranged (intentional or not).  Tobey Maguire was the best (and very good) but he spent too much time acting like a lovesick puppy.  The plot was too much and too messy.

Spderman deserves better than this, maybe next time...",1103328000,5,658,4.8125
1502881,4,B00005JMQW,"The sequel to Spider-Man brings the audience to where the first film left off through a brief sketched review of the first film during the opening credits, which is rather cool.  Quickly the film jumps into action as Spider-Man a.k.a. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) must save the day as he struggles to keep his job as a pizza delivery boy while maintaining good status as a science student at Columbia University.  This is a difficult balancing act for Parker who also works as a freelance photographer for the Daily Bugle where the owner, J. J. Jameson, does everything possible to make life sour for Spider-Man.  Moreover, the most difficult issue for Parker to tackle is what his uncle once taught him, ""with great powers comes great responsibility"", as he must withstand his love for Mary Jane in order to protect her from his enemies.

The balancing act performed by Parker is catching up with him as it causes him great stress, which in the end begins to negatively influence his life.  Parker's grades are slipping, as he must write a paper, which he has decideds to write on Dr. Octavius (Alfred Molina), a prominent physicist.  It happens to be that Dr. Octavius works for Harry Osborn (James Franco), Parker's friend and father of the late Green Goblin, as he is developing fusion in order to provide the world with free electricity.  However, the experiment goes wrong and it creates the monster Dr. Octopus, which soon becomes Spider-Man's new archenemy.

Internally Parker struggles with what most people face everyday, choices and the stress brought upon him through his choices, as they influence those around him.  However, his choices have a slightly grander influence on people as he saves lives and fights against evil.  Parker also envies the normality of humanity, which he feels that he cannot have, as he must use his great powers responsibly.  This struggle produces an overburden of stress and seems to weaken him in all aspects of life, as he also finds himself pushing away the people for which he cares.

Spider-Man is a roller coaster that brings the audience through the high and lows of Parker's life, as he struggles with his existential identity.  The director Sam Raimi projects this internal struggle onto the silver screen through popular psychology and a heavy dose of scripted dialogue, which is at times a little awkward.  The method in which Raimi portrays Parker's difficult position in life comes across to the audience a little too straightforward.  This straightforwardness makes the internal struggle seem slightly absurd, much like our contemporary pop culture's need for instant gratification.  The notion of instant gratification ushers thoughts to ponder that the making of Spider-Man 2 was hastened, as the film does not leave anything for the audience to ponder.  However, Spider-Man is a superhero and it is expected that he will win as he brings his justice to evil.  Nonetheless, it is intriguing to see Raimi depict the human side of Parker.

Sam Raimi does a great job telling the story of Parker and his endeavors as he goes about to find a solution to his problems.  The detailed computer generated images and cool special effects provide spellbinding action as Spider-Man attempts to win over evil.  However, the sequel does not deliver the same caliber of work as the predecessor did, which offered more for the audience to reflect upon as Parker had to learn how to live with his gift.",1103241600,3,3445,4.935875216637782

For those expecting Indiana Jones non-stop action, you're not going to get it in Spider-Man 2. I found myself enjoying Parker's problems and interactions as much as Spidey's.

The casting wasn't as strong as it could have been. Stargate SG-1's Michael Shanks would have been a far better Peter Parker, but his age puts him a bit out of reach. And finding a Mary Jane everyone would fall in love with just isn't met by Kirsten Dunst. Let's face it, MJ was someone way out of Parker's league who just happened to be attracted to him. This wasn't realized in the movie, alas.

But the acting was passable and the story and action tremendous. I wish they'd put the full screen and widescreen editions on the same disk. There are times I'm in the mood for both. I don't know how much better the Superbits is with this movie, but this is the film I chose to try it out on.

1502953,3,B00005JMQW,"The Spiderman franchise really took off with this movie. The first one was sort of a let down. It's 2 hours of build-up to a climatic fight with the Green Goblin that is woefully short and anti-cllimatic. The only thing I have to nitpick is the addition of NY citizens hurling stones at the Green Goblin, supposedly to show American spirit or unity. But it doesn't really work, because soon, these same civic-minded citizens did not appear again.

Back to Spiderman 2. As with all superhero sequels, the main protaganist will be faced with new problems (personal,social,professional,etc.) as well as a new super-villian. This time, it's Doctor Octopus (a classic Spidey villian). Sam Raimi pummels Peter Parker with the sort of problems a socially inept geek would face in a high school.

He works his character through various mishaps and obstacles. He's so engrossed with developing the character so wholeheartedly and thoroughly that he had forgotten to insert more action sequences,forgetting that he's actually directing a superhero movie.

I caught this movie twice in the theatres. The first time round is the charm. The second time round, bored at having to sit through the exhausting exposition just to wait for the next action sequence to turn up, I actually timed the duration of any CGI action onscreen. It came up to about 22 minutes or so. Even the mmuch talked about and praised subway fight sequence lasted a mere 7 minutes.

Talk about being short-changed! This is a 127 minute movie and that's only a mere 22 minutes of action and 100 plus minutes of puppy dog stares and ""soliloquys"" about the moral dilemma of being a superhero? Come on! I don't mean to grouse. I don't mind the exposition, but this is a superhero movie! Where are my money shots?

X2 sort of delivers in the previous summer, but Spiderman 2 just didn't cut it. The sub-plot about Peter giving up his superhero persona only slows down and bogs down the action.

SPIDER-MAN 2 has everything a good movie should have:  a marvelous cast; superb direction; awesome and incredible effects; a great score; and a well written plot.  Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst give their characters a welcome sense of realness and one can't help but feel for them:  poor Peter can't be on time for anything; being Spider-Man interferes with everything in his life:  his job, his education, and most importantly, his relationship with Mary Jane.  Dunst meanwhile is not only stunning physically, but she is a darned good actress, giving Mary Jane just the right amount of naivete and spunk.  A supporting actor and actress nod should go to Alfred Molina and Rosemary Harris.  Molina is the perfect villain as the incredibly designed Doctor Ock!  He uses his impressive acting abilities to bring both compassion and hatred.  Ms. Harris is beautiful as Peter's Aunt May.  A seasoned theatrical and movie actress, Harris embodies the essence of paternal and familial love.  J. K. Simmons as Peter's editor boss is outrageously campy and brilliant.  James Franco as Harry gives a good performance, but his character is getting annoying and redundant---although it looks like he might be around as a villain in the third.

First of all, what's up with Peter Parker being a dork again?  After getting his spidey-powers, Peter Parker gained confidence.  Why regress him to his old, somewhat boring, self?  He says, ""Oh Boy,"" way too many times.  Second, please cut down on the screaming.  I know Sam Raimi also directed the Evil Dead movies but this is not a horror movie.  It's kind of annoying. Third, the dialogue needs a bit of work.  Some things just aren't very coherent.  Watch the WB's Gilmore Girls for an example of well written, interesting, and intelligent dialogue.  Lastly, cut out some of the story.  I'm not saying it was bad, it just kind of seemed to drag on a little sometimes, which I did not see as a problem in the first movie.  I feel that it was probably necessary for the 2nd movie to flesh out the story, so I predict the 3rd movie will not be as bad.  Oh yeah, and lastly, please try to keep Spiderman's secret identity SECRET.

What to keep?  Keep up the great work on the fight sequences.  Spiderman's use of webbing is awesome and realistic.  Keep the actors, they truly did an amazing job with what they had.  Kudos to all of them.  Doc Ock was a great villain, he surpassed the Goblin in my opinion.  Keep up this trend of ""loveable"" villains. : )  All in all I am loving Spiderman so far, and have really high hopes for the 3rd movie.",1102464000,,1802,4.323353293413174
1503014,5,B00005JMQW,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this wonderful movie? Let me suggest that ""Spiderman 2"" is to ""Spiderman"" what ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is to ""Star Wars."" Sure, the original films are lots of fun, but the sequels take things to a whole new level. ""Spiderman 2"" is much more fleshed out and emotional, much more focused on character development, and downright operatic at times. Here's Peter Parker having a REALLY bad day. He can't get a break, he can't even get a frigging HORS D'OEUVRE, poor guy! Maybe a little sunshine and a more carefree attitude (not to mention a brilliantly-placed freeze-frame) would help. On the other hand there's Alfred Molina as the wonderful Doctor Octopus, one of the most excellent villians of all time. And beyond that there are just so many clever little touches to this film that it becomes one of the best superhero movies ever made. Case closed.",1102377600,7,902,4.751592356687898
1503015,5,B00005JMQW,"As a Spider-Fan from an early age, I am steeped in the geekiness of enjoying comic books, which makes me a stickler for details when it comes to my favorite characters.  When I heard Spider-Man would be brought to the big screen, I had the familiar sinking feeling of ""Oh, no, they're gonna screw it up.""  Then Raimi & crew blew me out of the water.  Then I was dreading the let-down of a sequel.  But Spider-Man 2 joins Empire Strikes Back in the pantheon of sequels that exceed the original (does that reference make me an uber-geek?  Yeah, but you knew what I meant).

This movie is dead-on true to the comic, from Peter's real-life difficulties to Doc Ock's maniacal genius to the public's attitude towards Spider-Man.  The entire ""feel"" is like you've been transported into this parallel New York where superheroes and supervillians are a fact of life.  And not to be overlooked is J.K. Simmons stealing every scene as J. Jonah Jameson.  Watching him is like seeing JJJ sprung forth from the forehead of Stan Lee himself.

  This movie begins with Peter struggling to keep his job as a photographer and pizza man, and having trouble keeping up in school. Also, Harry's hatred for Spiderman has grown, along Mary-Jane's seeming resentment towards Peter about him not sharing anything with her. Also, she is getting married to Mr. Jameson's son. His Aunt May is getting foreclosed from her house, and Peter is not even sure he wants to be Spiderman anymore. Then comes Dr. Otto Octavius, a brilliant, albeit misguided, scientist who is making an attempt at a fusion reaction. When it goes awry and he is stuck with 4 tentacles on his back, we have our villian and story-line.

  This movie's greatest attribute is obviously its special effects, but it has a lot more to show for than just that. It has an amazing and incredible plot'line and will leave you wanting more when it ends.",1102291200,2,1088,4.670157068062827
1503018,5,B00005JMQW,"The important question is, do you like comic-book super-hero movies or not?  If you do not, you might still like this movie, but probably not as much as you should.  However, if you do, this is probably the best one ever made.  Sam Raimi does a magnificent job with every aspect of this movie.  He recaps the first movie in drawings over the opening titles, and away we go.  The visual effects are much better than the first movie and the story line is more involved and, being Spider-Man, still achingly sad in a teen-age angst comic-book sort of way.

Here I am thinking of Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) gazing from the stage at Peter's empty theater seat, not knowing that poor Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is indeed at the theater, being kept out by an overly officious usher.  It is touching in the way it is handled.  These are good actors portraying these roles.  It is an outlandish story, but played as if they were real people and all this exotic reality were perfectly normal.

Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina is especially terffic) battle it out in terrific sequences, as they did in the original stories.  It is interesting how they create him in this film.  Of course, the whole story is preposterous.  That is not the point.  You have to get past that before the film starts.  There is a sequence on an elevated train that is absolutely superb.  If you quibble about it not being even marginally possible in any universe, you should just go home and put on a t-shirt that says, ""I don't know how to have any fun at all.""

1503019,5,B00005JMQW,"Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire)is trying to lead a normal life, despite the fact that he is still taking on the responsibility of being Spider-Man. Unfortunately, the stress of his alter-ego is making him have a difficult time of doing so. The love of his life Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) has now become engaged to another man, and is trying to move on with her life from when she had feelings for Peter and was ultimately rejected by him. To make matters worse, Peter slowly begins to lose his superpowers, which makes him question if being Spider-Man is the right life for him. Peter decides to hang up the suit and never perform another duty as Spider-Man to pursue a normal life and win Mary Jane's heart. Things do not go as planned however, when a freak accident transforms Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) into a supervillan refered to as ""Doc Ock"" who has four metal tentacles coming out of him. Now with Doc Ock on the loose, Peter realizes that only Spider-Man can stop him. But things become interesting however, when Peter's best friend Harry Osborne(James Franco) puts a price on Spider-Man's head to gain revenge for the death of his father Norman, and Doc Ock willingly accepts.

I was extremely skeptical regarding Spider-Man 2 because sequels often fail to live up to the first film. However, due to the fact that I am a huge fan of the superhero genre, and since the first Spider-Man film was so enjoyable, I decided to put my skepticism aside and give this film a shot. I was literally blown away by how good the film turned out to be. Not only was it more enjoyable than the first film, but I can honestly say that it is the best superhero film that I have ever seen beating out Batman, Superman, and X2. The reason that Spider-Man 2 is such a cut above the rest is because of the acting and the amazing special effects. I also love watching the story unfold in this film. It has a menacing villan in Doc Ock and gives a well rounded look at the hero of the story by offering excellent character development with both Peter Parker and his alter-ego Spider-Man. Peter has to struggle with losing his powers, facing a very formidable advissary in Doc Ock, as well as trying to lead a normal life, win Mary Jane's heart, and keep his identity secret from his best friend Harry who holds his alter-ego responsible for killing his father. Tobey Mcguire was absolutely brilliant in the role of Peter Parker and made the super Spider-Man seem believingly human and easy to relate to. Watching Peter Parker struggle to have a normal life was my favorite aspect of the film. Alfred Molina deserves a round of applause for his portrayal of Doc Ock. Molina has openly admitted that this was not the usual type of character that he plays, and that is what impressed me so much with his performance. He was downright menacing in the role.

Overall, I feel that Spider-Man 2 is the best superhero film that I have ever seen. The incredible acting, amazing special effects, and well rounded story all make this film extremely enjoyable. The 2 disc DVD is jam packed full of special features that include a blooper reel, three featurettes, and much more.

1503020,5,B00005JMQW,"""Spiderman 2"" is a marvelous action-adventure, sci-fi thriller which won't please everyone because it emphasizes story over action. There is plenty of action, of course, but much of the movie dwells on the loneliness, alienation and complexity of its hero, Peter Parker/Spiderman. Its premise is that being a hero has its price - a theme which everyone from the ancient Greeks to Shakespeare and beyond has written about. It also employs the idea that greatness is often thrust upon an unwilling participant and plays havoc with such a person's personal life.

The movie's screenplay employs the ""Gone With the Wind/Titanic"" approach. These movies had as much story as action. They were the most successful films of their time.

There is -and always has been - a portion of the audience which demands all action all of the time. For these viewers, ""Spiderman 2"" is a disappointment. It's not in the ""Independence Day/Starship Troopers/The Day After Tomorrow"" format, in which the characters are cardboard ones who exist only to move the action along.

Tobey Macguire reprises his role as Spiderman. He is perfect. Something tells me that Macguire is a bit perplexed by the fact that he has become known as one of the great actors of his generation, much like Spiderman is confused by his powers.

This episode finds Parker down on his luck and depressed. There are no great villains for him to fight. He's still madly in love with MJ [Kirsten Dunst] but is afraid to show his feelings because he knows that his enemies could harm her if they knew of his feelings for her. Harry Osborn [James Franco] is remains his best friend but does not know that Parker as Spiderman killed Osborn's mad scientist father in the first movie.  Finally, another madman comes to the rescue - Dock Ork [Alfred Molina], yet another scientist taken hostage by his own overly ambitious science project.

Full enjoyment of this sequel requires one to see the original, because so much of the story hinges on knowledge of what happened in the first film.

My main criticism of ""Spiderman 2"" is that the ending is a blatant setup for ""Spiderman 3"". Otherwise, it's a greatly entertaining endeavor.",1102204800,,2172,4.885869565217392
1503021,5,B00005JMQW,"Spider-Man 2 sure lives up to the expectations set up by the first. This movie has some great action that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Very few sequels can live up to the original, but Spider-Man 2 sure does. I can't really say much more than what has all ready been said about this awesome film. I have to say this Superbit edition is truly breathtaking with the vibrant picture detail and amazing sound. The regular Spider-Man 2 edition is clear but the superbit edition is much clearer and much more detail is seen. Another great thing about the Superbit edition is the choice of sound options. You get the DTS soundtrack (dts only available on superbit edition) which brings the film to life far more than just the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. You have to be a true die hard fan to really appreciate this superbit edition. If you want to experience Spider-Man 2 with the best picture and sound get the superbit edition because it blows the regular edition away. The only downside to this superbit edition is you get no bonus features, but the clarity and sound more than make up for that.",1102204800,2,1104,4.525

1503070,5,B00005JMQW,"Taking issue #50 of ""Spider-Man"" as its starting point, Peter Parker decides he needs to get a life outside of Spider-Man. Parker discovers that crime never pays for the hero (or at least his overdue rent). Since he doesn't have time to do his college homework, is failing classes and no has relationship with MJ because of his alter-ego, Parker decides to give up the Spidey suit. When his powers begin failing him because of his indecision, it's the final web for Parker. Parker has lousy timing, though, as just as all this is occurring as Doctor Octavius (Alfred Molina in a marevlously nuanced performance)one of Peter's idols goes mad and becomes a supervillain causing havoc. J. K. Simmons is hillarious as J. Jonah Jameson capturing just the right element of tabloid journalism (and the scenes at The Daily Bugle plays like a miniature screwball comedy that could well have been made in the 40's)that drives Jameson to make Spidey a villain. The rest of the cast from Maguire, Dunst, Franco all the way down to Rosemary Harris as Aunt May capture elements of what made the comic characters so compelling.

With a witty script written by Alvin Sargent (""What About Bob?"", ""Julia"", ""Straight Time"" and ""Unfaithful"" among many other scripts)and with contributions by other notable writers (Michael Chabon Pultizer Prize author of The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay), ""Spider-Man"" soars precisely because of the issues that Parker faces. Sam Raimi's sure handed direction and visual effects that rank among the best  (although sometimes the CGI Spider-Man looks exactly like, well, a CGI representation of Spider-Man)keeps ""Spidey-2"" from being earthbound. ""Spider-Man 2"" visits familiar territory for super hero films (already visited by ""Superman 2"")but has enough originality to stamp the story with its own stamp. Is it better than the original? You'll have to decide for yourself as the first film was exceptional but ""Spider-Man 2"" at least measures up precisely because it's more character driven.

Comparing the different versions of ""Spider-Man 2"" is a challenge (there's three out there in the US). The best looking of the bunch is the Superbit edition in which all the extras are shaved off with all the extra disc space devoted strictly to the high definition transfer of picture and sound. Not surprisingly, this edition looks and sounds the best with a crisper picture, sharper images and top notch sound that sounds only slighly better than the 2 disc convention set. The catch is that the Superbit Edition has no extras and is a single disc. You'd also have to have a top-of-the-line system to really, really appreciate the differences (although on a big screen TV you'll see some of them readily apparent). If the person you're buying this for is into the best looking and sounding digital audio and video, this is probably the edition to get.

The 2 disc set looks pretty darn good with a high definition transfer that looks and sounds almost as good as the Superbit Edition. We also get ""Spider-Facts"" which is, essentially, a text only commentary track. While it occasionally has some interesting tidits about the film (and many outside of the film such as tidbits about New York City), it's dispensable. There's also a blooper reel which is amusing included on the first disc as well as previews/trailers for various films.

The second disc (which could easily have been included in a deluxe 3 disc Superbit Edition set for videophiles)includes a stunning 12 part documentary that discusses the production of the movie from pre-production to the premiere. It's exhaustive and fascinating to watch all on its own as a documentary. ""Ock-Umentary: Eight Arms to Hold You"" (a rather witty reference to The Beatles' film ""Help!"") is also a very good documentary on the history of Doc Ock from his first appearence in Spider-Man # 3 to the 60's cartoons to how they adapted the character for the film. There's also a number of very good featurettes including a discussion of the women in Spidey's life (which is only appropriate as two women dominate his life and influence most of his personal decisions),""Enter the Web"" uses multi-angle technology to give a glimpse behind-the-scenes of the shooting of the climax of the movie. There's also an art gallery of Alex Ross' paintings from the title sequence (which is used as a brilliant device to sum up the first film for viewers who missed it and reminding everyone of what happened). We don't get any worthwhile games (that's a definite negative for gamers who want to try ""Spider-Man 2: The Game"") but get a featurette on the making of the game. There's also the usual weblinks. Oh and if you click on one of Doc Ock's tentacles you'll find an Easter Egg showing a very funny practical joke director Sam Raimi played on actor Alfred Molina.

The commentary tracks feature director Raimi, Maguire and the producers and there's also a separate Technical Commentary featuring effects supervisor John Dykstra and others discussing how they achieved the look of the film. For those folks who purchased this at Best-Buy early enough got an extra disc that had the VH-1 Special on the production of the movie. It's OK and more promo piece fluff than behind-the-scenes documentary.

The boxed comes with the conventional two disc set (without the Best Buy disc which is a bit curious as it would have been a nice addition) plus a comic collector's dream team of 25 artists with paintings inspired by the film. There's a portfolio that allows you to view various scenes from conception to final product (which would have been put to better use on a multi-angle DVD for videophiles). Taking an idea from the re-release of ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" (a Raimi favorite), there's five postcard sized reproductions of the artwork used to publicize the film including the trio of promo posters that were plastered all over cities. Finally, there's a reproduction (reduced to fit in the set)of The Amazing Spider-Man # 50 issue that inspired much of the story. They probably also should have included The Amazing Spider-Man #3 where Doc Ock first appeared as well, but that's a pretty minor point.

All in all,the last set makes the better Christmas or birthday gift for fans. Regardless, the film is the same just differing in presentation. ""Spider-Man 2"" has a number of detractors that don't care for it. They probably shouldn't buy the film or rent it. For the rest of us who liked it, this is an intelligent, fun film thats only major flaws is that it runs about 15 minutes too long.",1102204800,5,6557,4.916892502258356

Again directed by Sam Raimi, ""Spider-Man 2"" finds Peter Parker struggling to earn a living, lives in a dumpy apartment alone, attending college and continues to crave Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and while saving the lives of people in trouble as costumed & secretive Spider-Man.  However, Spider-Man is starting to have problems slinging webs and scaling walls like a spider, while Peter's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), who has taken over the leadership of Oscorp, has invested millions of dollars into a project to create fusion energy as designed by the scientist Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina).  To help him successfully control the fusion reaction, Dr. Octavius designs a set of four cybernetic arms that he attaches along his spinal cord.  While Peter, Harry and a host of invited guests watch Dr. Octavius start the reaction, it suddenly goes out of control and destroys the chip that keeps the cybernetic arms under the control of Dr. Octavius' mind.  The result: Dr. Octavius is taken over by the less-than-ethical cybernetic arms and becomes a powerful criminal force determined to reattempt his dangerous fusion experiment regardless of the consequences.  As for Peter, with diminishing superhero abilities and his desire to recapture Mary Jane's heart from her new fianc&eacute;, the astronaut John Jameson (Daniel Gillies) who is also the son of J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons), he decides to throw away his Spider-Man costume in an attempt to live a normal life; but will that be possible with a menace as powerful as Dr. Octavius, a.k.a. Dr. Octopus, roaming the streets and threatening innocent lives?  Will Harry ever come to terms with his father's death, as shown in the first ""Spider-Man"" film?  You will just have to watch this exciting return of Spider-Man to find out!

As with the first ""Spider-Man"" film in 2002, the 2004 sequel has wonderful cinematography and great special effects.  The story is also quite entertaining and engaging.  Other memorable characters include Aunt May Parker (Rosemary Harris), Rosalie Octavius (Donna Murphy, who played Anij in the 1998 ""Star Trek: Insurrection""), Mr. Aziz (Aasif Mandvi) and a brief appearance from Harry's deceased father, Green Goblin/Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe).

1503073,4,B00005JMQW,"I'm going to risk getting a bunch of ""Unhelpful"" votes now by saying this- ""Spider-Man 2"" is slightly overrated.  This is an entertaining and sometimes moving film, but it's not without its flaws.  Those who are saying this is the best comic book film ever have likely not seen many comic book films.  I found ""Spider-Man 2"" to be somewhat below such films as ""Supermans I and II"" (In fact, this film borrows some themes from ""Superman II""), ""Hulk"" (for those who haven't read my previous reviews, I was one of the few that loved that film), and even the second ""X-Men"" film.  However, this is still a very good movie, and it will probably end up in my year's Top 10 list (out of the 50 or so films I see a year).

Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst continue to be an appealing couple.  Really, there couldn't be a better Spider-Man than Maguire.  My personal favorite of the acting jobs is JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, who gives the film all of its funniest momemts.  I honestly believe he should be up for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  Another stand-out is Alfred Molina, who makes Dr. Octopus equally sympathetic and dangerous.  The sole sore here is James Franco as Harry Osbourne.  I sensed that we were supposed to sympathize with him as well, but from the beginning of the film he's too angry and hateful.

The action in ""Spider-Man 2"" is almost spectacular.  In this area, ""Spider-Man 2"" improves on the first one in almost every way.  My only complaint is that there's not enough of it.  The film feels about 20 minutes too long, and I honestly think that it could have done with fewer of Peter Parker's ""agonizing over what to do"" moments.  Don't get me wrong, the movie did need some of these scenes.  There are just too many of them, and things occasionally bog down.  However, the film corrects itself at the climax, which works both on an action-filled and an emotional level.  Needless to say, we can't wait for ""Spider-Man 3"".

On the whole, I would say that ""Spider-Man 2"" is a huge improvement over the first film, which I was slightly disappointed with.  The acting is even better, the villain is perfect, and the climax is rousing.  While I won't say ""Spider-Man 2"" is the best comic book film out there, it's a good way to kill a couple hours, and to give yourself an adrenaline boost.",1102118400,,2313,4.509615384615385
1503074,1,B00005JMQW,"Spiderman I and II have got to be two of the worst contemporary movies I've seen. I truly do not understand why they are so popular and well-reviewed. I can admit when a movie I don't like is good in spite of my opinion of it. But that is not the case here. This movie sucks, plain and simple (when compared to all movies in general)

However, as far as comic book movies go, this movie is even worse than above! It isn't on par with X-Men I or II, Hellboy, Spawn, etc. I haven't seen it, but I bet Daredevil is better than this garbage.

Why does it [...]? I think the comic it is based on is the reason. This movie was destined to [...]. Spiderman is about the lamest series in comic book history. Some bookworm gets bitten by a spider, and now he can spit nasty crap out of his wrist? Oooh lemme get in to that! I want a badass superhero (any of the X-Men, Hellboy, Spawn, Superman, Batman, etc. etc. etc.), not some weakling you used to beat up in school.

And NO, this difference in superhero character does not make Spiderman more endearing, touching, real, human, or any other similar description. It makes it lame, sappy, boring, and in need of 20-minute close-ups during the movie to distract the viewed from its lack of entertainment value.

1503075,5,B00005JMQW,"Crime fighting doesn't pay, discovers Peter Parker in ""Spider-Man 2,"" released this week on DVD.

Like the record-breaking 2002 film, the sensational sequel sticks mostly to the rich source material, the Marvel Comics title from 1963.

Toby Maguire looks suitably uncomfortable as the conflicted web slinger. His heroic deeds wreak havoc on his personal life. He's always late, he's broke, his grades are falling and he can't confide in the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).

His problems would have most of us climbing the walls. They make the wall crawler lose faith in his superpowers and force him into some tough choices.

While Parker can't pay the rent, the film snared a juicy $373 million at the box office.

Indie-film actor Alfred Molina is a great casting choice as out-of-control Doc Ock.

1503076,5,B00005JMQW,"He's back!! The Webbed Wonder returns to DVD and even better than part one. I'm always cautious to purchase a sequel to any movie because it seems that movie companies take advantage of the success to the first part, and  in haste release junk.

The Exorcist part II immediately comes to mind. With this said, I am please to inform all you ""Spidey Fans"" that this sequel is definitely worth purchasing. Packed with action, great special effects, and (for those who like love stories) a nice continuation of part one.

Part II features all the main characters  who survived part I with the original cast playing their part plus a new and a more formidable foe for Spidey ""Dr. Octo"".

Peter Parker finds himself torn between the obligation to do good for society, his burning desire to show his love for M.J. and telling her the truth about who he really is, and  his desire to keep his friendship with his best friend Harry ( the Green Goblin's son). Harry meanwhile is determined to find Spiderman and avenge his father's death ,not knowing who Spider Man really is.

I'm not one to enjoy sappy story line, but after seeing Spidey II, I must say that the story of M.J. and Peter Parker was nicely presented to the viewer without taking away from the purpose of the movie, which is, blow away the audience with great special effects.

Tobey Maguire (Peter Parker) and Kriten Dunst (M.J.) do a wonderful job of convincing their audience of their undeniable love for each other while Peter can only keep his love for M.J. to himself,  which is something most of us can relate to from our own experiences. With all these personal decisions that Spiderman has to juggle with, he learns that, whatever direction he takes will have an impact on his spider powers.

Spiderman effectively touches base on the definition of what a true Hero really is which is important for youngsters of today's society.

Spider Man II is a Nicely told story with tons of action and great special effects that in my opinion surpasses part I. Viewers will not be disappointed with this sequel.

This set comes with lots of special features that include, Bloopers, The making of the movie, Trivia , Documentary on the newest Villain, multi angle look into one of the most exciting scenes of the movie, and much more.

Spiderman II is available in 3 different technical/visual formats, widescreen , full screen with 5.1 Dolby Digital Sound, and Superbit with 5.1 DTS availability. So be sure that the set you buy is compatible with your system. Though my DVD is not in DTS audio, the Dolby sound is excellent. The picture quality is unsurpassed as well as the special effects, though there are some parts that are not so convincing.

Overall this release has Lots of action, lots of special effects, nice story,  so don't just sit there, go out and buy this DVD.

1503077,5,B00005JMQW,"This was one of the best acted, well scripted movies of '04 period!  Maybe, even of the last decade.  It had action, drama, humour, pretty much anything you could ask for in a movie.  Even Kirsten Dunst, whom I personally find a bad actress and hardly attractive enough to play the role of Mary Jane, managed to not annoy me this time around.  Every actor played their role perfectly!  About the only complaint I had with the movie is that the credits rolled far too soon.

Even my date, who hates superhero stuff typically, found this to be an enthralling movie!

Final note:  The train scene where Spidey saves everyone, without giving away the whole scene, I'll just say it's one of the best movie sequences I've seen in ages.  I never get misty-eyed as I'm too much of a cynic, but I definately came THIS close to crying on that scene!

Oh, and don't listen to Susan, if you REALLY want a bargain, I found this at suncoast.com for only $15.99 and $.2.27 shipping.  Her site is $16.99 and $1.50 shipping.  I got the best bargain because suncoast.com is doing free shipping on orders over $25, so it wasn't hard to find another bargain and combine for free shiping.

Anyway at the very least, go out and rent the best movie of 2004!  You'd have to be Scrooge himself not to enjoy this one!",1102118400,2,1291,4.438297872340425

If this movie really has such glaring flaws then why such high ratings!?!?! I saw the movie in Japan on its openning day, birthday gift from my wife, first showing on a saturday with only being 20 people in attendance there?!!? Someone forgot to mention that the theater holds over 150!!! Harry Porter raked in over 120 mill at the box office in JP and Spidey recieved only half that much during the same run in summer. Too bad for Spidey. You know, I used to be a big spiderman fan and even subscribed for one year to the Amazing Spiderman, it was during the time of Todd Mcfarlane. Those were great comics!! Great art and great stories!! But this movie...OMG!! This was awful! The last time I can remember seeing such a horrible super movie was the Punisher, about 10 years ago. SM 2 was just as bad. The acting, writing and story. This movie was not well paced by any stretch of the imagination. This was almost as badly paced as George A Romero's Day of the Dead. And I would rather watch Day of the Dead 100 more times than this pile of ""rotting"" garabage.

PLease! Oh please! I can't give this movie any lower of a mark!! If I could I would! Save your money and purchase Carl Sagan's Cosmos. Now there's a story...",1102032000,3,1505,4.333333333333333
1503158,5,B00005JMQW,"This is just another year where the Marvel franchise has taken the the world by storm. They started the year off with a great adult oriented movie call the Punisher. Then came the allmighty god, Spiderman 2. Next in line is Blade Trinity. I'm starting to think, these movies are goinna take over the movie business lol. Anyways, this is a review regarding Spiderman 2. I went to theatres the following Friday that this movie opened (it opened on a Wednesday) and I was shocked at how a sequel could far surpass its predecessor. Spiderman in my eyes was one of the best movies ever made, for any genre. I absolutely loved it. Then it all changed, and its because of this movie. This movie is so much more than the previous one. For instance, Green Goblin ain't got nothing on Doc Ock. Doctor Octopus is the coolest super villain I've ever seen, and even cooler in a movie. He is so much more badass than the Goblin ever was! The story progresses so much better this time around. Peter Parker, at one point, Peter Parker decides to give up being Spiderman, to make matters in his life better. He later finds out, it isn't worth it to make himself happy, he decides that other people are more important and he goes back to being what he was meant to be. The love story between Peter and Mary Jane Watson grows intensely in the sequel, and it makes you wonder how well it will work in the next movie. There is so many things about this movie, I can't believe were achieved. The DVD is awesome, packed with 10+ hours of special features. I picked it up when it was released and couldn't be happier. I recommend each and every one of you superhero fans because you won't be disappointed...I can guarantee you that!",1101945600,,1708,4.442675159235669
1503159,5,B00005JMQW,"The Spidey 2 movie, far exceeded my expectations surrounding it. The movie has great action(epecially the fight on the train between Spidey and Doc Ock), superb characters, and a wonderful story and I was really glad that Peter and MJ got together at the end of the movie. The extras were also great, which tells about Spidey, his history, the history surrounding his supporting cast and about the story of the movie.

I think that this is a great DVD and I definitely recommend it to any movie and/or comic book fan",1101945600,,516,4.608695652173913

1503161,5,B00005JMQW,"Hey, they always said that sequels never quite measured up to the movie they follow--but this has got to be the MAJOR exception to the rule. The movie grabs your attention the very instant it starts and it never fails to entertain.

The acting is magnificent and it's obvious that the cast worked their little tushies off! GRIN Tobey Maguire shines again as Peter Parker, who when he's not Spiderman is the ""Everyman"" who is stuck in a rotten, very low paying job, having problems committing to his girl because he can't tell her he's Spiderman, and he's not exactly able to afford a nice home, either. Yet he possesses such incredible powers! He is Spiderman yet incredibly enough he can't make up his mind if he should continue on as both Peter Parker and Spiderman. Should he hang up his Spiderman uniform, he wonders? Great acting here! Equally true, Alfred Molina cannot fail when he is cast as the tragic but evil villain Doc Ock. Parker must choose between fighting evil Doc Ock in his role as Spiderman or settling instead for a MUCH more meager existence as Peter Parker and Peter Parker alone. Worse yet, Peter Parker is also challenged by The Green Goblin once over again played by William Defoe. Kirsten Dunst also is cast so well as Peter's girlfriend Mary Jane; their chemistry is awesome! Again the acting is totally convincing and a real treat to enjoy. Don't forget to look for the train scene! GRIN

And yet there's MORE! The DVD is loaded--really loaded--with great extras! There's a technical commentary, a ""Spidey Sense 2"" pop-up trivia track, a blooper reel, a 12 (yes, TWELVE) part documentary on how they made the film, and a little special something called ""Ock-umentary: Eight Arms to Hold You!"" SMILE There are quite a few other extras as well.

The picture and sound quality are excellent and the DVD 2 disc set is nicely packaged. SO, with the holiday season upon us, who could resist getting a copy of this film? Give yourself and the people you care about a much deserved present this year! I guarantee you won't regret it! And by the way, can we get a Spiderman 3 soon in the new year?

I want an action movie from my superheroes.  I don't want to watch self doubts, insecurities or other nonsense that I can see for free in my everyday life.  Still, the action sequences are fabulous.  The villain this time is top notch!  Doc Oc rules.  Much better than the lame Green Goblin they came up with last time.  This version is more character driven.  It's a love story (i.e. The chick flick part).  I found it to be a little distracting and boring at times.  However, the battle scenes are some of the best ever created.  There is a sense of peril and doom around every corner.  The loose ends from Spidey One are all tied up nicely, leaving lots of room for chapter three.

Between the sad, predictable, badly-acted lines and dorky plotline, there isn't much to admire. Nothing in this movie made me think Spiderman was real (come on, it's freaking 2004, hire a company that knows CGI for petes sakes), nor any of the lame romance lines or any of the ""enemy's"" lines. I'm sure a good kid with superpowers would turn his back on someone getting pummeled. Yeah. I'm sure some redheaded [...] marrying someone else would still love a dork who acts like a hero but really ain't. Right.

1503230,3,B00005JMQW,"I was very dissapointed in movie.  I am a huge fan of the first and eagerly anticipated this one.  However I was met with a dissapointment.  The storyline is not nearly as good as the first and Peter Parker goes through an emotional relapse that takes entirely to long.

  Spiderman 2 starts when Peter begins to think that he should stop being Spiderman and become Peter full time.  His alter ego is tearing up his personal life.  But after an hour or so of this soapy drama, he ends up right back where he started.  I know that this was an important part in the comic, but they could have made the segment a little shorter.  So the bottom line is that by the end of the movie, you want Maryjane and Peter to die.

  With all this emotion fluff added into the movie there isn't alot of room for a main plot.  So they just thought up one in about four seconds.  Doc Ock's wife dies, he goes crazy, and for some reason blames spiderman.  The film lacks the charm of the first and is often rambles.

  The violence in this one is much darker than the first.  There is one perticularly violent section about Doc Ock in the Hospital.  However I don't think you should prehibit you seven year old from seeing it.  Though he will most likely be bored with all the emotional minagery.  I was, not because I'm an insane action buff, but becasue the two characters have no chemistry and the relationship is dumb.

  However the film was fairly origional and better than some of the other summer films.  I am going to buy it, watch it, and be critical all the way.",1101859200,2,1554,4.305555555555555
1503231,4,B00005JMQW,"I saw it last night, for the first time.  This movie is significantly better than the original.  You get a much greater understanding of the struggles faced by the different characters.  I loved the theme of ""responsibility"" and how it is highlighted throughout the movie.  One particularily strong moment was immediately after the train rescue, when the crowd carried the injured Spider Man to safety.  The concept that each of us are given certain gifts (strength, intelligence, agility, etc...) by our creator and we are obligated to use those gifts for the benefit of mankind is driven home by several of the characters, including the bad guy...DocOck.

1503232,5,B00005JMQW,"I loved the movie.  That's all I'm saying about that.

I've read some of the bad reviews posted on here and came across one.....only one! that is actually well thought out and deserves any respect.  I don't agree with the opinion of that particular person about the movie but I can see their point of view.  The others?  Come on, people......  Look, if you are not sure about the movie and want to read some reviews, think about something for a minute.  How much advice do you want to take from someone that can not even write out a simple thought?  Look at the spelling, look at the grammer.  These people just seem to come out of the woods or something just looking for anything popular to rip apart and be the 'minority' on any particular subject.  I read those reviews only because i've seen this trend on amazon revolving around the 'mainstream', popular stuff.  If you read any review on here (good or bad) just please keep in mind the type of person you may be taking advice from.  There's no reading-between-the-lines necessary on here.

(okay, I will say one more thing about the movie.  I've collected comics for 16 years and have well over seven thousand.  I believe the train rescue scene to be the greatest superhero moment i've ever seen.  Comics or movies.  It just showed the hero in him to risk his life to save those people, no matter how difficult the task or how much it hurt him.  Look at the acting during that.  Fantastic.  He was standing in a blue screen environment with props and still pulled off the pain of being stretched out on the front of a run-away train.  Don't believe me?  Watch it again and think about that.)",1101859200,4,1647,4.474747474747475

1503234,2,B00005JMQW,"This film was a waste, in a lot of ways. First, it was a waste of a movie rental for my wife and I. Second, it was a waste of Tobey Maguire's acting talents. Third, it was a waste of effort for all the CGI artists who worked on this film. Lastly, it was simply a waste of the time spent watching it.

Why so negative? Several reasons:

* The dialogue is wooden and utterly predictable. Even Mr. Maguire's talents can't rescue this material. Every time a character speaks, I am thinking, ""Was this written as a daytime soap opera?""

* The CGI Spider-Man, while better than in the original, was still utterly beyond belief. Gravity has no effect on him, and his movements have none of the rhythm of human movements.

* James Franco is AWFUL. The portrayal of the Harry Osborn character is so bad, that I wanted to fast forward the movie every time he appeared on the screen (which was far too often).

* Remember the old 1950s movies like Tarantula? Remember the way the camera would give you a close-up of a woman's face while she opened her mouth wide and screamed? Well, that happens in this movie, too... a lot... and it's dated.

* The train scene was simply ill-conceived. I've read a lot of Spider-Man comics over the years, and this is simply not true to the comic book hero... at all.

* Too much time was spent establishing Peter Parker's tragic life. Pete's luck isn't just bad, folks... it's surreal. The movie makes him out to be the personification of Murphy's Law. Hint to the writers: some audiences can ""get it"" without being hit in the head with a 2 by 4.

* The subplot of ""Oh no! I'm losing my powers!"" was poorly done. They want to turn it into a kind of impotence, but as usual they did not think through it well at all. Again, in the comic books, Spidey's powers were never just a ""state of mind"".

* The plot is the same plot we saw in Spider-Man 1. I can already tell you how #3 is going to go: Harry Osborne will become the Hobgoblin. He will terrorize the town. He will kidnap Mary Jane. He will lose. He will develop a sense of remorse at the end (as he dies). No originality whatsoever.

Was there anything good about it? Yes. The villain was a definite improvement over the original. There is some humor in the film (the scene with the brooms comes to mind), which Tobey handles very well. There are some good action scenes, but they all had that annoying CGI problem. Hmm, that's about it. I saw the first one in the theater; I rented the second; I won't be seeing any of the others. This was simply a waste.",1101859200,4,2537,4.310924369747899

Not as classic as Superman: The Movie IMO, but few films are. A great ride from start to finish, and director Sam Raimi not only twisted the movie into something uniquely Raimi (like Doc Ock's hospital scene, pure Raimi!), but he threw in a LOT of comic book references! See if you can spot them all!

S-M2 isn't for everyone, but if you enjoy superheroes, comic book adaptations, action/adventure movies, or just the wallcrawler, you should enjoy this movie too! A great setup for the third movie too!

The special features are LOADED, lots to check out. Thankfully more content than even the Deluxe DVD for S-M1, and there are some Easter eggs too, hit the Internet to find out how to access them! However, if you're planning to buy this DVD, you should know that a Spider-Man 2.5 DVD is already in the works, which will add some footage cut from the theatrical release (a few minutes rumored) and still include everything on this DVD release.

My 4 year old loves Spiderman and I took him to Spiderman 1 without any problems.  During the Spiderman 2 movie there is an operating room scene that I had to cover his eyes and ears until it was over.  That was probably the worst thing that happens in it.

It is much more action packed than the first one, which is great.  There's also more of a love story theme in this one as well.

Not being a big fan of marvel myself shows me how good it is and i would think that the fans of the marvel comics would greatly enjoy this. More action has been added and i think that doc. oc is a far cooler super villain than the original one which i hope does not return in the third part to the series( you'll know what I meen after watching the movie).

1503262,5,B00005JMQW,"It's a bit of an understatement to say that Spider-man 2 is the most exciting film I saw in theaters this year. As far as I'm concerned, Spider-man 2 is in the same ballpark as The Empire Strikes back in terms of sequels. Everything that the first Spider-man did was expanded upon and polished to the point of perfection. And yes, as many people have already said, this is by far the best comic book movie ever.

I thoroughly enjoyed the first Spider-man, but I'm afraid it just can't compete with the second. Spider-man 2 is the type of movie we all hope for but rarely get. It really is something of a masterpiece. The writing, the acting, the special effects... it's all beautiful. I was astounded by the character development. We usually don't see arcs like this in action films. I was moved, to say the least, by the intertwined fates of Peter Parker, Dr. Octavius, and Harry Osborn. And these three characters are played perfectly by Tobey Maguire, Alfred Molina, and James Franco. I was particularly surprised by the screen presence of James Franco. He stepped up to the plate and hit a home run here, delivering a breakout performance sure to merit him great roles in the bright future he has ahead. And I don't mean to single him out; all the returning cast members perform even better than they did in the first film. Everyone put in work here.

Sam Raimi's vision is fulfilled in Spider-man 2. The film flows with sublime efficiency, never losing its cool and never blowing its top. Thanks to the astronomical budget Raimi was allotted (over 200 million dollars) to make the film, the special effects are astounding. I remember hearing many complaints about some of the special effects in the first Spider-man, but there is absolutely nothing to complain about here. From the clock tower battle to the insanely exciting runaway train scene, I was utterly thrilled. So thrilled was I during the runaway train scene that I couldn't help but break into a cold sweat (I'm not lying).

I have to take some time out here to talk about the character development. The screenwriters did such a great job here. It just blows my mind. The struggles of Peter Parker here are so easy to relate to, the sympathy I felt for Spider-man was real. In fact, I was so moved by Parker's struggles that I couldn't help but cry tears of joy for him at the victorious conclusion of the film, which is nothing short of majestic. And, not to forget Harry and Doc Ock, whom I had no difficulty sympathizing for, even as villains.

This is a comic book movie, people! And these characters are real people with real problems! So gratifying is it to be so thrilled and so moved from one film that I'm really at a loss for words. This DVD is essential. Movies don't get much better than this. I cannot wait to see the direction the third Spider-man goes.

Oh well... until then, I've got Spider-man 2 to watch!

1503264,5,B00005JMQW,"Director Sam Raimi has raised the comics-to-cinema bar to new heights with SPIDERMAN 2, the highly-acclaimed sequel that has turned out to be a blockbuster in more ways than mere Box Office numbers.

Tobey Maguire returns as Peter Parker/Spiderman, now scrambling more than ever to meet his engagements on time. And it's not just Work - his college courses are suffering, even a commitment to see long-time crush Mary Jane in one of her plays ... because someone ALWAYS gets into trouble on the way there. Torn between being 'Spider-man' and plain old Peter (his love for Mary Jane and that less rushed, more ordinary lifestyle), Pete faces a new challenge to his dichotomous identity: Is he any longer cut out to BE Spiderman? Throw into that existential crisis a much-publicized fission experiment gone terribly wrong, a newly potent, tentacled villian who can climb skyscrapers and hurl automobiles like soda cans, as well as a director with a respect both for the genre and for the origins of the story, and you have the makings for a smart and suprisingly well-crafted tale.

Spidey-Two is one of those sequels that truly is better than the original. For one thing, on almost every level it is more complex than the first, handling and balancing those complexities as professionally as any movie of its kind. The story itself contains more intricately interrelated elements than did its predecessor. The pacing is careful. The character portraits - most notably that of Peter Parker - are deep and could rival everything else we've seen this year in cinema. Actually, in the two-plus hours that show us his hopes and struggles, Peter Parker became visibly more human than any other put-to-film superhero I've ever seen. And no other superfigure can best Spiderman for sense of moral direction. Also, the action-sequences and visual effects are equally, or more, stunning than in the original. Here we get a much better sense of Spiderman's speed, agility, and even his sheer strength. For a final image we have a hero who is both very much someone with whom we can identify and yet somehow larger than life. As for other cast members, everyone who was anyone in the first movie comes back for the second. Adding to that is the reality, as one critic has said, that those same actors/actresses take their roles with utmost seriousness, making their characters the more believable. Finally, Sam Raimi directs those persons and their crises through some very refreshing plot turns.

Chaulked-full of DVD extras (including Commentary by Sam, Tobey, and producers; blooper reel; trivia track; a women-of-Spiderman featurette; 'Doc Ock'-umentary; and much more), SPIDERMAN 2 remains a motion-picture force to be reckoned with - one entirely worthy of the praise it received.",1101686400,2,2773,5.050218340611353

Needless to say, this one passed all of my expectations.  A better villian, better story and superb acting across the board elevated this from being just a ""superhero movie"" to one of the best films that I have ever seen.  I can't wait to get this one on DVD tomorrow(I live in Japan, so we're 13 hours ahead of the states).  I even convinced my wife, who didn't like to first one to see it with me after I went on opening day, and she liked it as well.

1503266,4,B00005JMQW,"Since I had seen the first Spiderman movie [and I thought it was okay] my interest was piqued by the glowing summer reviews of Spiderman II. Those July reviews served as my motivation to go see what I had hoped was a sensational action blockbuster. You know what happens when you expect to see sensational ? That's right -- disappointment. It's not that Spiderman II is a bad movie, it's not, it is very watchable, but Jaws and Jurassic Park were sensational summer action movies that moved you emotionally - Spiderman II does not. The best parts of the movie were those with Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), and there were just not enough of them to suit me. Too much time was spent with  Peter Parker pining pitifully about not being able to reveal his true identity to his girlfriend, and trying to hide his identity from his best friend. Tobey Maguire is good, but he does not match the star power of Jack Nicholson in Batman. Spiderman II is a good, passable action movie like Spiderman I, but it is not sensational.",1101600000,2,1013,4.53551912568306
1503352,5,B00005JMQW,"The best way I have found to describe this movie to people is this:

I have collected comics since I was 8 (I am now 30).  One of the main titles for me during this time is Amazing Spider-Man.  Spidey is one of, if not my favorite character, because I could always identify with the nerdy Parker.  When the first movie came out, I loved it, it was everything I could've hoped after waiting almost 20 years for a Spider-Man movie.  But the second movie was like a gift to someone like me.  I was speechless as I walked out of the theater.  I could be a real fanboy and nitpick at things (origins, organic web-shooters, or Mary Jane being inserted for Gwen Stacy), but I can't bring myself to do so because what is used works.  It's hard for me to describe exactly what I loved about this movie because it's so much more of an emotional attachment to the character.

If you like/love the Spidey comics, and you aren't too much of a fanboy, you will most likely enjoy this movie, at the very least.",1101600000,,995,4.278074866310161
1503353,4,B00005JMQW,"Great direction and action went into to this film, but i can't say the same about its story. While being one of the best super-hero action films, it also seems like a cheesy love story. The movie focuses too much on his relationship with Mary Jane, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, both being highly talented actors, don't seem to be allowed to use all of their acting skills, which i think hurt the love story they were trying to accomplish, but 4 stars has to go to this film, its downsides are made up with it's action scenes, great CGI work went into its action scenes, and great surround sound made the action scenes better, some fantastic direction, Spider-man 2 can't be denied by comic book fans.",1101513600,,704,4.551181102362205
1503354,5,B00005JMQW,"Director Sam Raimi and superstar Tobey Maguire return for more high-flying heroics in the remarkable blockbuster sequel ""Spider-Man 2"". The strain of having a secret identity is seriously affecting the social life and responsibilities of mild-mannered Peter Packer (Maguire) and forces him to abandon his role as the wall-crawling crime-fighter Spider-Man. When the menacing Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) threatens lovely Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and the rest of New York, Peter will have to face his greatest challenge yet. ""Spider-Man 2"" is a spectacular and emotionally powerful comic book adventure that succeeds over the original 2002 smash hit. The critically acclaimed summer film contains a compelling plot and appealing characters with strong emotional depth. ""Spider-Man 2"" also features some breathtaking action sequences, amazing special effects and delightful humor. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Alfred Molina deliver some moving performances. The fine cast also includes James Franco, Rosemary Harris, J. K. Simmons and Bruce Campbell in a brief funny appearance.

If you were amazed by ""Spider-Man 2"" in theaters then ""Spider-Man 2"" Special Edition will indeed surprise you. The comic book blockbuster is presented in 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD has a fine picture quality with great contrast and nice bright colors. Its Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is very impressive with splendid surround effects.

1503355,3,B00005JMQW,"I watched Spiderman 2 about 2 or 3 months after it came out so I read and heard all the amazing reviews.  Yet, after watching it, I still for the life of me cannot understand why everyone hails that this is better than the first and even the best comic book movie of all time (X2 or Batman Returns still hold that title in my comic book).  Bear with me people, as the only voice of dissension among the crowd, this review is going to be long:

1) ""With great power, comes a great need to whine for 2 hours...""  Having superpowers is something unavoidable, it was accidental and Peter can't avoid it or get rid of it, though he does lose it temporarily in the movie.  Yet being Spiderman is entirely by choice so I cannot sympathize and I'm not really sure why the audience is expected to, for Peter when he can't balance his life as both Spiderman and Peter Parker.  No one asks you to put on a costume and go out and fight crime, dear boy.  There are these people called police officers, who are paid to do it.  Go do your homework.  After an hour of useless scene after scene of ""Peter can't catch a break""  ""woe is Peter"", I was ready to gag.  That brings me to...

2) Two hour plus movie which easily could have been trimmed down by at least 20 minutes.  There were so many superfluous scenes in there that served no purpose but to drive the point home that Peter's life sucks and he is a loser.  Okay, we get it.  Despite the fact that the story of Spiderman/Peter Parker was already established in the first movie and also known through basic pop culture, thank you writers (one including my favorite author/Pulitzer Prize winner, Michael Chabon.  was he actually involved in this movie?  I can't believe that) for beating the dead horse that is Peter's miserable life.  I mean, just one of the many instances, the cake scene with the landlord's daughter??  I literally spent a good 5 minutes afterwards trying to figure out why that didn't end up on the cutting room floor.  My only conclusion was that she is the daughter or mistress of a powerful producer whose money was involved in the making of this movie.  I understand that children are going to watch this movie, but the repetitive and unnecessary scenes of Peter's bad luck/misfortune were way too much.

3) Um...action, where'd you go?  Did anyone notice how nothing happened for a good half hour to 45 minutes expect for lots of whining?  I understand you need to draw out a story and set up the plot but come on.  Compared to the first movie, this movie had very little action in it and the much-hyped subway scene fell into sentimental drivel at the end...

4) what was up with literally everyone in New York City discovering his secret identity in like the last 10 minutes of the movie.  Who's idea was it to throw that in?

5) I really wish they had used more James Franco (Harry Osbourne) his character is so rich and complex and his bitch-slapping Peter at the party gave me such great pleasure because I felt like doing that throughout watching the whole movie.

6)Otto Octavius.  First off, I feel Willem Dafoe (amazing actor) got a bad rep in the first movie.  Everyone says he was terrible, I thought he was great.  I also think the characters of Doc Ock is just like the Green Goblin.  Essentially good man, plagued by another personality of his own invention (mechanical arms/goblin gas).  The mirror scene in the first movie where Osbourne plays himself and the goblin was great.  Also Doc Ock's dialogue was so corny, I wanted to retch.

7) I will give props to Rosemary Harris (Aunt May) who is much better in the second movie.  She was awful in the first in my opinion and JK Simmons who steals every scene he's in especially in the last scene where MJ doesn't show up at the altar.  (sorry if I just ruined that for someone) that was hilarious!

8) Speaking of which, the whole standing the groom up at the altar/running to Peter in her wedding dress.  Wow, so original!  The character of Mary Jane, who in the comic books, is smart, independent and doesn't take any of Peter's wishy/washy b.s. is reduced to villain bait and pretty much a village bicycle in this movie (she's passed around more times than the hors d'ouveres at the party, geez!).

Okay, I could go on but I think you get the point.  Spiderman 2 in my opinion was no better than the first, and for the most part was hokey, sentimental drivel that came off more as an afterschool special than a comic book movie.  *Sigh!*  I only hope that Batman Begins (June 17 people!) with Memento's Chris Nolan and Christopher Bale, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, etc. will show everyone what a good superhero movie is supposed to be like.  (Here's hoping Katie Holmes doesn't ruin the aforementioned flawless casting).",1101340800,17,4771,4.508158508158508
1503356,5,B00005JMQW,"Two years ago, we were all re-introduced to Spiderman, the Superhero with everyday problems that cramp his style as a day-saver.  In the opening munites of ""Spiderman 2,"" the thrilling and deeper sequel to the wide-eyed original, Perter Parker (Tobey Maguire) loses his job, ruins his laundry, gets behind on his rent and finds he is still living in a low-rent apartment with a nosy tenant.  Life sucks, even for a revered Superhero.  All Peter Parker wants to do is finish his college work, meet with one of his idols Dr. Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina) and especially enter into a meaningful engagement with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and keep a devastating secret from his best friend, harry Osbourne (James Franco).  But of course, he must always save the world.  Soon however, he must fight Octavious as his demented alter-ego Dr. Octopus comes to the service with a vengence, and Mary Jane gets engaged to someone else.

This is ambiguous and heavy stuff, especially for a big-budget summer action flick (and a huge action flick, with a budget of $200 million).  But director Sam Raimi and screenwriter Alvin Sargeant have higher goals.  They stick to the story and tone of the comic books,  giving the film has a sense of integrity and rich charcter development that elevate to the realm of greatness.  The quiet moments have tha same amount of impact has the big ones, but Raimi does not hesitate to pull out all the stops for the action sequences, seamlessly combining CGI, puppetry and Billl Popes' astounding camera work into one adreanalized package.  Spidey's battle with Doc Ock are breathtaking, climaxing in an above-ground train fight that leaves one absolutley brain-boggled.  But more imprtantly, the filmmakers put the focus squarely of the characters and their relationships (good, bad and ugly), ""Spiderman 2"" achieves nothing short of greatness and longevity, encompassing the best of what comic book films have to offer.",1101254400,10,1950,5.040498442367602
1503357,5,B00005JMQW,"I've been a fan of Spider-Man for as long as i can remember. The Batman movies were never anything specail to me (especialy since the first one was the only good one) and the Superman movies flat out sucked (no disrespect to chris reves R.I.P.) But in 2002 the Spider-Man movie rocked the comic book movie universe, and fufilled a promise hollywood made to me when i was about 8.

When Spider-Man 2 came out, my expectations were high. and They were beyond surpassed! The story telling is fantastic. No fan boy should be disapointed here. It the right balence of action, and drama! The storys are half of what always drew me to Spider-Man over any other super hero. The fact that Peter Parker is just a normal kid who was give extraordinary powers. He's not some millionaire who lives in a made up city, or some alien from a made up planet )protecting some other made up city. Spider-Man was a normal guy, who lived in my city. And this movie sure doesn't forget that.

The story deals with the paraleling worlds of Peter Parker and Spider-Man. His reactions and discions are extreamly human. What would any of us do if we became over whelmed with life and had super powers?

This movie has something for everyone of all ages. Action, Drama, Comedy, Romance, and so much more. Spider-Man 2 did me, and every fan justice and made us feel it was worth waiting all those years.

1503390,5,B00005JMQW,Doc Ock is better as a black hat in this one. I believe he came across better because you could see his facial expressions in this one. Green Goblin's face was hidden during his evil moments. I like this one better because there is more at risk in this one. For Spidey fans that don't know; Jameson's son becomes a Man Wolf in the comics...and professor Connors becomes the Lizard.  Now if only the Lizard is in number 3; it might be just as good.  I have to reccomend this one. It has a lot more Spidey action that wasn't in the first.

We get that rarity, a GOOD sequel, and still rarer, one that surpasses the original. Kirsten Dunst FINALLY gives us a strong heroine who stands by her man instead of weepingly accepting that She Must Only Be Loved From Afar because of danger (unlike the annoy un-coupling of Superman and Lois Lane in the Superman series!). We're given an eerie and haunting look at the next movie in the works at the end, but I don't want to spoil it for you. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? Buy the DVD.

1503395,5,B00005JMQW,"One of the only movies where I can say that the sequel is better than the original - by a mile. Excellent storyline, incredible graphics and special effects. Holds ""true to form"" for Marvel's printed material and original character development, ulike some of the other Marvel movies of late (ahem....Hulk, which was uniquely too ""dark""; and Punisher - when will they EVER get this ""right""). Doc Ock is an excellent character development, and played masterfully by Alfred Molina. Excellent Casting, Direction and Production. Masterful artwork on the CGI and special-effects, to the point where WYSIWYG - the viewer has no perception of the ""cheezy"" transitions of actual vs. computer-aided graphics in terms of the viewing, which plauged movies even just a few years ago.

Follow-ups will likely include a host of very cool super villans, and some interesting overall plots twists and new interpersonal Peter Parker twists like Gwen Stacey, Aunt May's transformation into Madam Web, Venom, the Black Suit, etc. With over 40 years of comic books to tap into, most of which were outstanding in their own right, there is abundant material to make this a landmark series that can go on for years to come. One can only hope that Marvel will continue to insist on scripting the follow-ups as well as this picture (and the original) without butchering them by ""skipping"" or ""cramming"", which happens often (Marvel Take Note: Franchise Series...along with DD if you develop it correctly, so don't blow a good thing !!).

Kids enjoyed immensely - And even though it carries PG rating, I let my 4 year old watch it (supervised, of course). Younger children should have a parent with them to explain some of the more violent action scenes - but if your kids read the comics (heh, they read my comics...haha) - they will have already been tought that it's just ""make believe super-hero stuff"" - ""just like the comics"". Once they digest that and make the connection, even the youger kids can enjoy it with a parent present.

Adult purists will love the acting, script, character development, and the (more or less) adhearance to the original comic book series storyline and character development. Overall a keeper, and in the DVD library already. 5 Stars for a job well done across the board.",1100217600,3,2278,4.942558746736292
1503396,4,B00005JMQW,"I went into this movie with low expectations. Two years earlier I had sat through every disappointing moment of the original movie full of all that missed opportunities and blah blah line deliveries.

So, switch to 2004 and my date and I stood outside a movie theater in Reston, Va. pondering our choices. There was DODGEBALL all sold out (to my silent relief since my date was the only one who had expressed an interest in the screwball comedy). Somehow we ended up putting down our cash (or at least mine) for the second Spiderman and I entered the theater and braced myself for what might come.

Lo and behold two hours or so later I left the theater energized and excited about the emerging franchise. The simple fact was that this second installment was far better than the first. Not saddled with having to explain Spidey's abilities and his coming to terms with his powers. This follow-up was able to focus on the action and adventure without losing focus on what for me was the best part of the picture - the relationship between Mary Jane (played by the seemingly omnipresent Kirsten Dunst) and Peter Parker. It was an interesting parting shot that tied up that storyline nicely (at least until the next movie).

Another element that separated this movie from its predecessor was Alfred Molina as the main villain. A truly sympathetic character he was not the evil meglomaniacal villain that so often inhabit the superhero canon, but a good man trapped and manipulated by his own invention.

One element I really liked was the unmasking of Spiderman (you'll have to see the movie to see what I mean) and this element should lead to some interesting developments in the third movie.

Fans should beware that director Sam Raimi is reportedly working on a directors cut for this movie with extra and extended scenes that Columbia TriStar is apparently willing to finance (new spfx etc). I for one will more than likely be picking up the one to be released at the end of this month.",1100217600,6,1987,4.698275862068965
1503466,5,B00005JMQW,"Spider-Man 2 is an awesome movie from beginning to end and leaves Spidey fans craving for more.

The beginning of the movie has some very comical scenes as Parker juggles his life as Spider-Man and Peter Parker.  Every action scene is breathtaking and Spidey's struggle when fighting Dr. Octopus is felt while watching the movie.

But the best part about this movie other than its action scenes and great visual effects is its sense of character.  Tobey Maguire really conveys the character of Peter Parker well, in that he is able to show the inner struggle Parker faces between choosing to lead a normal life or a life as Spider-Man.

J.K. Simmons is great as J. Jonah Jamison and Molina is very effective in his role as Dr. Octopus.  However, I think Molina should have worked on speaking with a German accent since Otto Octavius is obviously German.  This would have been even better, but no big deal.

Kirsten Dunst does a much better job in her role as Mary Jane than the first film.  She does well in portraying Mary Jane's frustration and anguish over not being able to get close to Parker until the very end.

Overall, the movie was GREAT and exceeded any and all of its expectations, which were relatively high to begin with.  For those who say the movie was just okay, it's obvious they don't quite understand the background of Spider-Man and don't have a feel for the comic book series.  Spider-Man 2 is just as good if not better than X2.  This coming from a HUGE X-Men fan.

1503467,5,B00005JMQW,"Spider-Man 2 finds Peter Parker dealing with the harsh realities of being a superhero. His grades are slipping, he can't keep a job and his relationship with Mary Jane is non-existent. How is he to be a normal person when he must spend his nights slinging through the city after New York's villains?

With this set-up, Spider-Man 2 attempts to break the mold of the superhero genre. Yes, there is a sub-plot dealing with the multi-armed Dr. Ock, but the thrust of the story deals with the inner-conflicts of Peter Parker. Will he abandon his crime-fighting ways and become a better student, nephew, employee and boyfriend? This film actually builds character development and gives the audience a Peter Parker that everyone will want to pull for.

But the film does not abandon it's comic book roots. The eye-candy fight scenes are enhanced by unbelievable technological advancements made since the first Spider-Man. The incredible creation of Dr. Ock works as the special effects' greatest invention. His mechanical arms work with him in such a realistic way that many moviegoers will swear actor Alfred Molina really had those things fused to his spine and wired to his cerebellum.

So much of the success of these films should be placed directly on the shoulders of its star, Tobey Maguire. Many questioned his original casting as the webslinger. While his past works have not exactly made him a surefire choice to play a superhero, his depiction of sensitive, lonely characters in his previous works (Pleasantville, Cider House) made him the perfect choice for Peter Parker. He is why Spider-Man 2 is able to revolutionize superhero films by allowing them to be about more than just special effects.",1099785600,,1702,5.007067137809187

Most of the time, when dealing with computer simulated fight scenes, everything goes so fast you never get any detail. Not so with Spiderman 2. The battles with Doc Ock are fabulous. They interweave a plethora of close-up shots of Spidey and Doc involved in a greatly pugilistic donnybrook with the far screen shots of them falling off buildings and Spidey jumping out of the way of Doc's arms. With this type of action, you only need to suspend your belief for a few seconds as opposed to the entire battle (a la ""Van Helsing""). The plot is incredible. It has everything. Action. Drama. A mother's love for her son (even though we all know Aunt May is not technically Peter's mom). A love story between two people who are really in love with Peter and MJ. A deceptively creative subplots like Harry's discovery of his father's Green Goblin gear. I do not think I could reccomend a movie more.",1099526400,5,1013,4.540983606557377

Consider Spider-Man 2 the movie that leapt both hurdles, and made it look easy.

This movie takes on the difficult inner struggle of Peter Parker, trying to come to terms with two lives, with only the same, standard 24 hours in a day that the rest of us get. Which is more important? ""With great power comes great responsibility"" we heard in the first movie - but in the second movie, Peter struggles with that mantra, vs. his right to have a normal, happy life.

Great job, wildly entertaining, excellent FX, super super-villian! Worth adding to your collection.

I know he had the skills to do other genres but I feared what he would do with one of my own beloved characters that I had grown up with.  Then he started making the second one, I asked myself; would he go push the limits further because he has more money?  Thankfully no.

Raimi, the script writers, Toby Macguire, Kirsten Dunst and the rest of the cast created a deeply emotional and stunning portrayal of life as a Superhero in the real world.  He gets fired from his job, he watches helplessly as his Aunt goes bankrupt, he fails his courses in school, all because he feels this hard bound responsibility to use his powers whenever he sees trouble.  He is obsessed with righting wrongs because of his uncles death that he could have prevented.  He can't even tell the girl he loves how he feels because he fears for her safety, even though she throws herself at him.  The massive burden he has placed on himself because of his abilities puts him in a position to think of everyone but himself.

There are moments in this movie that will have you welling up with tears.  Aunt May gives a speech about `the hero in all of us' that will have you begging her to stop.  There is a scene where a group of New Yorkers on a train, after he saves their lives, learn more about Spiderman than they thought they ever would.  In that moment the true nature of his intentions and motives are revealed to them and and in turn, change their view of him.  The sacrafices of Peter Parker can make you re-think all those childhood dreams of wanting to be a superhero.  The trials and hardships could make anyone decide that juggling the life of a superhero and everyday person can be the most difficult and selfless thing a person can do, and in turn make them decide that it is not something they can deal with.

This movie is awesome, emotional and complete.  The effects are better then the first movie and the story is involving.  I'd give it six stars if I could.",1099353600,,2373,4.328054298642534
1503551,5,B00005JMQW,"Spiderman 2 is superior to its predecessor in every way, and that's saying something.  The original Spiderman was an amazing accomplishment, matching action and special effects with excellent storytelling.  Spiderman 2 expands on that ideal, with bigger and better special effects and a more in-depth emotional backdrop.

Spiderman 2 finds our hero Peter Parker suffering from the increasing strain of leading his double life has college student Peter Parker and superhero Spiderman.  This strain can most notably be observed in his relationship with Mary Jane, who has become increasing annoyed with Peter and his apparent unreliability to be there when she needs him.  His best friend Harry Osborne is still spiteful about Peter's ""relationship"" with Spiderman, who he blames for the death of his father, the Green Goblin from the first film.

This time around, Spiderman must take on Dr. Octopus, played by Alfred Molina.  Molina's performance is probably one of the most memorable for a villian.  Willem Dafoe's performance is the first film was very good but at times a bit over the top - Molina does not suffer from this drawback.  Dr. Octavius has his mechanical arms welded onto his body during a lab accident.  Soon, the arfitical intelligence that governs the arms have corrupted his mind, turning him into Dr. Octopus.  Doc Ock becomes obsessed with rebuilding his fusion reactor to create an unlimited energy source and resorts to crime in order to achieve this goal.

The special effects are turned up a notch in this film thanks to it's larger budget.  The fight scenes between Spiderman and Doc Ock are more intricate and convincing.  While this makes the film more enjoyable, what really separates this film from other superhero movies is the story revolving around Peter Parker.  Unlike other films, this movie is just as good when we are watching Peter as when we are watching Spiderman.  The action isn't required to carry the entire film, which allowed the film to explore Parker's life as well.

This is definitely the best superhero movie of all time, hands down.  Fans of the Spiderman comic book will be thrilled with Sam Raimi's ability to accurately capture the web-crawler than fans have enjoyed the past 40 years.  If you're not a comic book fan, this is probably one of the few films that you might still enjoy.  Give it a try.  You won't be sorry.",1099353600,6,2377,4.952020202020202

The special effects are worth a viewing...they are amazing...and really show how far we have come along in the art of cinema.  But unlike numerous other superhero movies (the hulk and the punisher) the spidermans are just well-written.  The dialog is as great as the action.  The story line is engrossing and every end is tied in this installment.  Well almost everything...gotta leave some stuff for the third movie!  The casting is sensational...these actors really bring the comic book characters to life and I feel as if this movie as stayed as true as possible to the comic book story.  The villian is scary (i mean come on... that many arms is freaky!)  and the hero over comes his internal battle as well as his external ones.  But i find the humor in the movie to be just as enjoyable as anything else.  This movie has it all but above all else it is just really entertaining... if you like good story lines, comic books, special effects, love stories, action, and comedy...then you will find something to like in spiderman 2 along with the original...

To be honest, i don't like carnivals of aspect ratios in my collections, so i'm going to skip any other comment about that fact.

i think the special-effects percentage was equal to the first one. Of course, special effects are a lot better, but, i don't know, it makes me think about those 200 million dollars spended in this movie, it was a total robbery.

The action and overall playout of the story is unbelieveable. Doc Ock and his arms were awesome to witness and Peter's character wa great.  Tobey Maguire did a fantastic job of relaying exactly what Peter was going through.  There are very great sequels but this is definitely one of them.  Spiderman 3 has a challenge ahead of it, as does Sam Raimi but I believe that there is no doubt that it'll be fantastic!!!!",1099094400,3,589,4.36697247706422
1503556,5,B00005JMQW,"Much the same way that Star Wars relegated most science fiction movies to B reels, so has the Spiderman franchise done to comic book hero movies.  It starts with one of the best young actors of his generation, Tobey Maguire,  He has a fantastic ability to delve into the most human aspects of a character, and Spiderman is no exception to his resume.  He creates a sympathetic and identifiable character, who only appears to be a superhero in the most extreme action sequences, yet otherwise, comes across as just another man thrown into an amazing situation.

Another comparison to the Star Wars trilogy, as The Empire Strikes Back, this is another sequel that over time may prove to be better than the original.  The spectacular effects are used well in this sequel, but toned back a little bit to allow the exploration of the characteres of both the hero and the villian.  Alfred Molina, as Doc Ock, delivers a magnificent performance, bringing to the screen a villian that one can not help but feel sympathetic for.  Doc Ock proves to be just as much victim as villian, a man tortured by his the horrible effects of his own brilliance.

There was one aspect of this film that I felt did provide a less than perfect part of the exectution.  While delving into the tragedy of Spiderman and the catch-22 of his life, there are an awful lot of scenese where Tobey Maguire is crying.  It does, to a degree, seem to be just a little overdone.  However, as you see, I STILL gave this film 5 stars, as it is not nearly enough of a negative to drag down what is otherwise a great character study of both a hero and his nemesis.  The other superhero movies that have come out in the past couple of years, and those coming just ahead, have a huge standard to live up to, and very few, if any, will reach the heights of perfection of Spiderman and Spiderman 2.",1099008000,,1852,4.479166666666667

When spider-man chooses a normal life over a super-hero, the affects of this action brrings about conflict between him and his ex-villians, his loved ones and and also with his previous life. The actors were too good to be a part in this movie but played the roles of the characters as if it was high school theatre. The plot was interesting and kept my attention, yet it was the details around the main concept of the movie that were boring. This movie also lacked suspense because it revealed to the audience in the beginning of the movie about what was going to happen in the end. The film seemed rushed  and it had enough material to be a 4 hour movie. When spider-man gave up his powers, due to the overwhelming stress and hatred that was drawn to him by his friends and the media, you knew he was just bound to pick that spider-suit up from the garbage can and save the day once again. In the end it was just another sequel to be put away on the shelf and to be forogotten as just another summer flick.

Of course there will be a part 3, and it will be interesting to see how and if it will top part 2.

I'm glad they introduced Dr Oc. as the bad guy, but when they eventually introduce the character of the Hobgoblin (Harry Osbourne's Alter Ego) and the Kingpin (Fisk), I'll feel like Spiderman has finally finished his transition to the big screen! On the whole, a really enjoyable viewing for the whole family.

I think there was less fighting in the second, though...I just paid to watch a giant fight, which I wish it would have been.  Too much plot.  But when there wasn't plot, it picked right back up into cars being thrown...so don't worry pro wrestling-watchers...you'll get your fix.",1098748800,,596,4.6826923076923075

Tobey and Kirsten are truly talented, though, and Spider-Man 2 was all I could think about for at least a week after watching it.  Doc Ock was a much more believable and better-costumed villain then the Green Goblin, in my opinion.  Spider-Man 2 is now one of my favorite movies, even though I didn't want to see it in the beginning.  This movie was definately better then the original Spider-Man!  Hopefully, if they make a 3rd movie, it will be just as good as this one was.

Nice opening credits sequence, which is enough to orient those who haven't seen the first movie. There are also plenty of allusions to the first movie as well. The end is not only satisfying, but leaves a cliffhanger for ""Spider-Man III"", coming summer 2006. Everyone in this film was convincing in their roles. Shouldn't have been rated PG-13, though there are some frightening images. Keep it up. Better than the first one. Hope the third one exceeds expectations and brings the saga to a close, although making more wouldn't be a bad idea; but you better not push your luck.

1503663,5,B00005JMQW,"Before Spider-Man was created in the early 60's, super heroes tended to be a step down from gods (and some actually WERE gods). They were powerful, morally upright, and unwaivering in their convictions. In other words, it was fun to follow their adventures, but they were a bit hard to relate to.

Stan Lee changed all of that when he created Spider-Man. He decided to make a hero who was an unpopular, nerdy kid who just happened to get stuck with powers he wasn't even sure he wanted. He had everyday problems like dealing with bullies, being uncomfortable around that cute girl he likes, and feeling left out in general. And who hasn't had experiences like these at some point in their life?

I've seen some great comic book adaptations that really got down to the core of a character (Batman), and I've seen movies that simply made me cringe and wonder how they could have been so far off the mark (Daredevil, anyone?). As far as capturing the true essence of it's title character, this movie tops them all.

In a lot of ways, this is THE Spider-Man story. This is Peter Parker's struggle to decide just who he is and what his resposibility is to the world, his family, and himself. And it's not an easy decision to make.

It's been beaten to death a bit by now, but it all boils down to what Uncle Ben told Peter: ""With great power comes great responsibility."" And Peter rages against this logic for the entire movie. Should he live for himself, enjoy his life, and ignore the powers he's been given? Or should he put the needs of others before his own, essentially sacrificing his personal happiness in lieu of the satisfaction and knowledge that he's made a difference in the world? This is the conflict that is at the very core of this character, and this movie captured that in ways that I'm sure made Stan Lee proud.

To be totally truthful, this movie should probably be called ""Peter Parker."" If you're looking for mindless action, go buy Terminator 3. This is a movie about a young man trying to find himself--it just so happens that this particular young man has some extraordinary powers.

Don't get me wrong; there are some absolutely amazing action sequences. Doctor Octopus is a visually dynamic (as well as tragic) villain, and he makes for a lot of exciting scenes. And I must say, he's played to perfection by Alfred Molina; I don't have a bad thing to say about his performance. And special effects? I get goosebumps every time I see Spidey swingin' through the concrete jungle. Spectacular!

But at heart, this is a movie about character development. I can't express how grateful I am to Sam Raimi for turning out such a quality film that stays so true to the character. He did an amazing job, mixing drama, action, humor, and just a dash of Evil Dead-like horror into a final product that left me emotionally drained and wanting more. It's gonna be tough to top this one. I'd give it 10 stars if I could.",1097625600,3,2928,4.565714285714286

There were a couple of good parts (Peter puts his Spiderman suit in the washer with his whites) but it focused WAY too much on Peter Parker trying to find himself.  That, of course, made the entire middle of the film nice to take a nap to.  It was sooo boring, that you just couldn't help but feel tired and fall asleep.  Too bad I was nudged in the shoulder about 5 minutes into my nap and asked why I wasn't watching the movie.  Oh man.  I'm starting to whine through the entire center of this review like Peter Parker did through the center of the movie.  Sorry about that.  Anyway, the special effects were great, but of COURSE special effects don't make the movie.  And the train scene seemed to drag on and on and on.  Plus, it was just a stupid scene anyway.  ""We're glad you came back Spiderman!""  Corny.  There was barely any character developement.  No, Peter Parker whining about how his life sucks through most of the movie is NOT DEVELOPING HIS CHARACTER.  Now, the ending scene was alright, except when the wall was about to fall on MJ.  I actually laughed at that part.  I got some dirty looks, so I covered my mouth and lowered down to a light giggle.  MJ was being such an idiot.  Sitting there.  Not trying to move the piece of metal across her lap.  Just screaming.  Looking up.  Oh MAN, that's sure quality entertainment.  The actual ending was completely stupid.  If you read the original comic, you'd be rolling your eyes at this horrible excuse for an 'action' movie.  This isn't action.

It's hard to say what's wrong with the movie without writing spoilers.  Let's just say that the setup takes up half of the movie.  Some people are not going to have that kind of stamina.  Also, the movie should have ended ten minutes earlier.  Those of you who have seen the movie know where this point is.

Overall I definitely recommend Spider Man 2 to anyone who is looking for a great film to watch. It has tons action for the people who love action. The movie also has an underlying love story that I feel makes the movie all the more realistic.

Toby McGuire believably portrays Peter Parker as a boy-hero guilt-ridden over his Uncle Ben's death. His after-hours life as a masked crime-fighter doesn't assuage the guilt and barely pays the bills. Peter has no life. Yet his inner decency won't let him abandon those who need him. Or will it?

Spiderman II is best when it shows the choice a hero makes between normalcy (as defined by we non-heroes) and being true to his inner gifts. The only weakness of the movie is that some of this turmoil is resolved a bit too neatly and quickly.

Alfred Molina as terrific as bad guy Doc Ock. The special effects, showing the good doctor walking and climbing on his robotic arms, are completely believable, as is Ock's sinister, machine-enhanced megalomania. Entertaining and interesting!",1097366400,3,1008,4.883040935672515

It's not perfect, of course, but still worthy of five stars and repeated viewings.  It's been said over and over but the best thing about this movie is that it chooses to focus on Peter Parker rather than Spider-Man.  The major theme is: What drives us to do the things we do and is it worth doing these things even if we suffer?  Someone mentioned to me once that he found it ridiculus that Parker only seemed clumsy and unsure of himself when he was in street clothes and not in the Spider-Man suit.  Actually, this is what is facinating about the character.  His clumsiness is all in his head untill he puts on the mask....then he reafirms himself that he is more than just a geeky kid.  Parker's problem is that he doesn't know how to carry that confidence with him throughout his ordinary life.  This is what's so charming about the character.  He's NOT a super-man.

Of course, growing up I was a huge Spiderman comic book fan, even through the clone comics. (Those of you who don't know your comic books don't know about those years!) But the first one lacked something that these other two comic books had, not sure what it was but it just wasn't there, but I still loved it, and I had been waiting a long time to see it brought to the screen, and still surpassed my expectations.

Then comes Spider-Man 2. I went to the movie expecting, you know, the mediocre comic book sequel. I mean, you know how it is, the original is always better than the sequel right. WRONG!!! This went beyond my expectations, everything was brought to a whole new level. Emotions ran higher, enemies were tougher. None of this pitting Spidey against double enemies like they did in some other comic book movie franchises. The acting was even better as the characters became the actors.

I thought it was rather dumb, but after watching the first movie on DVD I was surprised by how well done it was. So in order to make sure I saw the second movie on the big screen I immediately went out and waited almost two hours to see the second one on the day it came out. And it did not disappoint......

This movie picks up where Peter Parker [Tobey McGuire], aka spiderman, is now doing. Although the first movie showed how much fun Parker was having, the second movie goes into detail on how the super powers can take its toll on the young guy. Parker is falling behind in his classes from lack of sleep, his teachers are concerned and want him to do better.

Then to add insult to injury his job isn't exactly great also. Some of the opening scenes have him racing to try and get a pizza to a costumer on time, only to be a few minutes late. Can't win them all the time! And probably the biggest pressure is one that gets us all, love. Parker realizes that he is in love with his best friend, Mary Jane [Kirsten Dundst], but cant seem to get it off his chest. One memerable scene is that he tells his friend how much he loves her, only to say it to the dead end of a telephone reciever.

Of course this is right on time when an evil villan is about to make his grand entrance. Alfred Molina gives a surprisingly great role as Dr. Octopus, a man with four seemingly invincible metal arms that are attached to his spine after a horrendous accident.  He first doesn't want to be evil, his plan was to get the arms off him. However, something gets inside his head, and he realizes he needs to steal money in order to get the parts for his machine that he needs.

Basically that is the main plot, Parker struggles to clear things out of his head, and Dr. Octopus turns to a life of crime. But that isn't all, the son of the Green Goblin, the main villan from the first blockbuster show, wants spiderman dead, for revenge on what spiderman did to his dad. And the ironic twist is that he is also Parker's best buddy, who could have seen that coming?

All in all, this is a fantastic movie, don't listen to that idiot who says that the two moives suck, they are anything but bad. The  special effects are brilliant, and it truly is one of the best superhero movie ever made. Lots of intense fight scenes, my favorite one being on the train, and an emotional decision by Dr. Octopus at the end are fantastic.

And did I mention the fact that Tobey McGuire gives an absolutely credible performance as the nerd by day Parker, and the awsome spiderman by night? Lots of great and suspensful scenes guarantees that this movie will never get boring, so buy it when it comes out on DVD!",1096329600,15,2786,4.223684210526316

1503709,5,B00005JMQW,"Poor Peter.  He's misunderstood by his aunt, his boss, that loudmouth at the Daily Bugle, and the love of his life.  He can't get past an obnoxious usher, can't deliver a pizza on time, and just can't get a break!

But he's Spider-Man.  Still haunted by the memory of his uncle Ben, he knows that it's his destiny to help those who are in trouble.  Once again, Aunt May and Mary Jane are under the gun, and he has to save them from the sadistic villain.

Yet he has someone else to rescue, a man whose troubles are as relentless as the mentor-turned-monster of Dr. Octavius, and that person in distress is Peter himself.  For over two hours, we're brought into the life of this young man who has the weight of the world on his shoulders.  And by the time the closing credits roll, we realize that we've been given something special.

Spider-Man 2 has no catchy subtitle, and could have easily been a remake of the first.  Yet Sam Raimi did something that few seem capable of:  he continued the story.  Cameron did it with Aliens and Terminator 2.  Irvin Kirshner did it with Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.  And like those other sequels, Spider-Man is not only a continuation of the ""original"" in their franchise, it's far superior.

It superior for many reasons: It boasts a tighter script, cleaner directing, better effects, richer acting, and even has a villain without a plastic halloween mask.  And finally, it has a resolution to Peter's hidden struggle, his love for Mary Jane.  I walked out of the theatre feeling like I took something with me.  When Spider-Man 2 is released on DVD, I'll feel the same way when I walk out of the video store... with this DVD in my hand.",1096070400,,1682,4.513245033112582

1503785,4,B00005JMQW,"""Spider-Man 2"" is one of the best sequels around.  Unlike many people, I don't think that it is any better than the first film, it just deals with a little tougher material.  In this go-round, Spidey is finding it hard to deal with the fact that he is living two lives.  It's so hard, in fact, that it's affecting his performance(in real life and as the Wallcrawler).  Basically, his whole life is a mess.  He's lost his girl, his best friend, and a mentor(Dr. Octavius) loses his mind.  The film pans out as our hero tries to figure out exactly what's going on inside of himself and how can he juggle being normal and a hero at the same time.

The action in this film is second to none.  It is the one aspect of the film that I believe is better than the original film.  Spidey and Doc Ock beat the hell out of each other in all of their confrontations.  Unlike the first movie, where the Green Goblin let Spidey go to mull things over, Ock fights until either one of the duo gives up or gets preoccupied by something else.  There is some brilliant action in this flick.

The acting is brilliant as well.  Alfred Molina makes you love Doc Ock from the get-go.  Then you want to feel sorry for his tormented soul.  Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have good chemistry on screen.  The standout performance, though, is from James Franco, who reprises his role as Harry Osbourne.  He begins the film in the same way that he ended the original--angry at Spidey for murdering his father.  As the movie progresses, he plummets into vengeful insanity, leaving things wide open for Spidey 3.  His acting seems to have grown since the filming of the first movie.  Let's hope he keeps it up.  He may have a bright career ahead of him.

The special effects were good.  There's more of Spidey swinging between buildings.  Sam Raimi has really captured the essence of Spider-Man, and I hope he stays on to do more sequels.

Highly recommended.  Definitely a film to purchase on DVD, regardless of any extras included with the package.",1095984000,,2020,4.4958677685950414

1503851,5,B00005JMQW,"I am not necessarily going to agree with everyone that this is the best comic book adaptation ever rendered on the screen, simply because I will be the first to admit I haven't viewed all of them. But I will honestly say out of the countless superhero films I have seen: this is, without a doubt, the best.

What seperates Spider Man 2, a sequel no less, from its counterpart and all of the other fx crazed superhero movies hollywood has to offer? Simply put, it takes its time. It pauses for a breath and dwells on the human side of Spider Man. He is after all, Peter Parker beneath the mask. He is a human being full of emotional weakness' with physical and spiritual longings. There's love pounding at his hearts door and he doesn't know what to do with it.

The villain this time around is a caring professor that loves what he does and has a tender heart for education and furthering the betterment of man. Only when he is ""possessed"" by his creation is he a villain. He wasn't heading that way in the first place like Willem Defoe in part one. I found myself, as many others, feeling sorry for him, and hoping all the way through that he too will be saved.

Sam Raimi took hold of the reins with the same ambition of his original films, the Evil Dead series. Like the saga or not, you could see the fun they were having all the way through. Now it seems, he has developed the same sincerity towards Spiderman.

Spiderman 2 rests on common ground, then stands tall, rising uniquely over the rest. Add this to your collection, it has my seal. ~S.A.O.S.~",1095465600,,1557,4.377162629757786
1503852,5,B00005JMQW,"I thought the first ""Spiderman"" movie was a very good movie. But ""Spiderman 2"" is on another level. Although the first ""Batman"" and maybe second ""Superman"" movies are comparable, I think ""Spiderman 2"" is the best superhero flick ever made. It has great action, special effects, and humor found from beginning to end. The element that separates it from the rest of the superhero pack, however, is the sensitive emotional depth displayed by Peter Parker, his grandmother, and Peter's girlfriend towards each other. I haven't seen this showing of pure sweet emotions since ""Titanic,"" which will go down as one of the greatest movies of the 20th Century. You can bet the same will be true of ""Spiderman 2"" for the 21st Century.",1095379200,,723,4.8861788617886175
1503853,5,B00005JMQW,"This is probably the best superhero movie perhaps this side of 'Superman,' and if you don't like this kind of film, you must see it.  Not because of its special effects; they are superb as expected, but that is not the point.  You should see it simply because it skillfully presents the credible characters with deep emotions, and the film is not afraid of stopping a while to show how a superhero can be a real human, and a villain can too.

The carefully written script (by Alvin Sargent, 'Julia') picks up the story of the original after two years.  Peter Parker is still a struggling photographer while Mary Jane is about to have a commercial break as stage actress.  Peter is still in love with her, but because of the incessant crimes of the city, he again broke the promise he made with her.

Then Peter is invited to a room of genius scientist Doctor Otto Octavius (by pefectly cast Alfred Molina).  Doc's new experiment, supported Peter's old friend Harry Osborn (James Franco, reprising the role), is going to be held in the city, and Peter is allowed to witness it, and its awful failure, which turns Doctor into a villain with robotic tentacles.

Written on paper, the story looks as silly as any other recent films you name, but the results are just brilliant.  The story is always interesting, being unpredictable at times, with slight amount of humor and lots of first-rate special effects.  In the middle of the speedy action scenes, director Sam Raimi shows his sense of humor, which is both surprising and hilarious.  (My favorite: Spider-man using elevator.)  And see Doc in labo, making a havoc there, which is shot with his trademark camera work that made him famous in 'Evil Dead'.

'Spider-Man 2' is probably better than the first one, in making more convincing characters and presenting well-balanced storytelling.  Of course its great CGIs are not to be missed, but more amazing thins is that these CGIs really support the main feature of the film -- the characters we truly care.  And that can be rarely found.",1095292800,2,2036,4.7280453257790365
1503854,5,B00005JMQW,"I'll tell you why. Spiderman 2 has romance, action and is very character driven.  If you don't want a spoiler stop reading now!

Peter considers stopping his superhero venture cause he can't have his cake and eat it too or so he thought.  He stops and he still is a hero. So... he decides he can't just stand by while people are in trouble.  And for the guy(or lady) who says he read this in a comic book well Um... sorry to break this to you but Spiderman is a COMIC book hero, um... the first one was in a comic book too, well a series of comic books, and so will the third one and so on and so forth, first of all if the veered away from comic books the comic book readers would be up and arms saying well spidey would never do that cause ya know ya didn't follow the comic.  They even put the comic book in the first dvd so you could COMPARE it. So sorry to bust your bubble but spiderman is a comic book hero he was a comic book hero before he was a movie star so they are gonna try to stick to continuity in the comic books.  Anyway I loved this movie.  Some people who like mostly action and little plot will probably not like this movie because it is heavy with plot.  Anyway I enjoyed it. Please keep in mind Spiderman is a comic book hero and has been for several several years... what 60 now? so yes material is gonna be gotten from comic books, personally I like that. It's much better on the screen but you can go back and read it also if you like that.  They don't totally follow the comic but the gist is there.

Spiderman has always been one of my favorite comic book heroes and the first movie was, while not true to the ""T"" for the comic book, an excellent rendition.

I was extremely disappointed, aside from the humor and Peter and his aunt and the new character of Dr. Octavius, everything in this movie was miserable.  The only reason people are saying this is better than the first is due to the better special effects and action scenes.  The plot is almost non-existent, the character development is weak...these were the best things about the first movie.  The main characters of MJ and Harry were watered down and made almost laughable.  It wouldn't bother me if neither of them were seen again.

How about the guy with like 8 arms; like we haven't read this in a comic book somewhere before. I swear these movies are a rip off of an old comic book, but I can't remember what it's called. I have no respect for a movie that steals ideas from a comic book. I think they even used some of the same names.

1503858,5,B00005JMQW,"This movie does what a lot of special effects/action movie sequels forget to do....It spends time developing the characters beyond what we saw in the first film.  This was the main problem I had with movies such as ""Men in Black 2.""  In that movie, we didn't learn more about what the M.I.B. do when they're not on duty or even exactly where they live and how they deal with society while off the clock.  This movie, though, we see how Peter Parker has to deal with being an average guy while not out fighting crime.  We see how difficult it is for him trying to juggle being a responsible superhero who puts others' lives ahead of his own and then on the other hand being considered an irrespoinsible slacker while just being himself.  They could have went the simple way with this movie and just said ""Okay, part 2, we already know who the characters are so let's just give it more action and more special effects!""  I'm glad they didn't do this, the director actually said that this movie pretty much has about the same amount of action sequences as the first, and while this does seem true, it doesn't take away from the movie at all.  Because now since we have more character development, we care more now for each character involved in the story.  Whereas we knew who Aunt May was in the first ""Spider-man"", we now care more about her and how she's gonna get through life without Uncle Ben.  And now we even care more about Peter Parker.  In the first film, we cared about how he was going to adjust to his superpowers and get good enough to use them to help save New York and those he cared about.  In this film, though, we not only care about how he's gonna save the city and those he loves, but how he's going to even save himself.  The reason we feel this way this time around is because we see how vulnerable Peter Parker is.  Yes, as Spider-man he has the ability to pick up some of the heaviest of objects and is agile enough to dodge many of the things that are thrown at him, but we know that he's still only human.  And we know that his worries about his own personal life can interfere with his ability to fight supervillians.

He cannot do his homework and regularly misses classes at college. He still cannot express his love to MJ, who has anyway given up on him and is marrying an astronaut. In short, Spidey's life is in a mess. That is how the movie Spider-Man 2 starts off. Enter Doctor Octavius, the former subject of his term paper whose nuclear fusion experiment goes very wrong and as a side-effect of that disaster his robotic arms are now fused to his backbone and they have an AI of their own which is now overpowering his own thinking. Spider-Man has to come out of his depression, find the meaning of his existence, balance his lovelife and protect New York from Doc Ock.

I cannot come to any conclusion with this movie. Really liked the way a superhero has been humanized and has to face problems faced by normal people (love, money, study, etc). The movie is filled with funny bits (Spidey in the elevator, the violin woman with her song, the pizza delivery scene, Doc Ock with the train travellers, etc). Some emotional scenes felt a little drawn out. Absolutely loved those train fight and save scenes. Also, liked the way the NY skyline is shown this time around. Those dusk/dawn shots of NY were too cool. Am really confused with their plan for further Spidey movies, now that the identity of Spider-Man has been exposed to some city dwellers and (more importantly) to MJ and his future villain. Also, Doc Ock's robotic AI arms are really cool. I am thankful they didn't try to make Spider-Man and Doc Ock in the seventies ;-) I will take back my earlier words; I liked the movie!",1095033600,,1709,4.548701298701299

1503880,4,B00005JMQW,"Spider-Man 2 is hands down better than the original. The reason for the improvement is clearly the villain, Doctor Ock. The villain in the first film, the Green Goblin, was horrible. Green Goblin had a terrible costume, terrible motives, and there wasn't anything resounding about him. This time around we have a villain that is compelling and tragic. His story as a driven scientist and the sudden and violent demise of his career and spouse makes this character much more human and real. The tentacle effects are great. Overall the action seems much more real as compared to the over use of the CGI Spider-man that the first film employed.

What keeps me from falling truly in love with the franchise, and most comic book franchises, are the super heroes themselves, in this case Spider-Man. In most of these comic book films the heroes are real downers. They constantly whine about their powers and their responsibilities. They seem to pout a lot about not having a ""normal life"". That's why the X-men films are better in my opinion. I like seeing characters like Magneto who embrace their powers and use them to their full advantage with enthusiasm.

I look forward to the third film of the franchise as it seems a lot of the emotional weight that Peter Parker carries in the first two films is lifted which might lead to a more enthusiastic and exciting superhero a few years from now.",1094342400,2,1390,4.739669421487603

June 30, 2004

The day ""Spider-Man 2"" came out, was the day I tried to remember aii of the great superhero movies that came out in the last 20 years. The first ""Batman"" film was okay, ""Superman"" was considered the best superhero film ever, it showed the mythology of Superman in a graphic way. The first ""Spider-Man"" Film showed more action than plot, or the characters that I'd grown to love. I wanted to know more about Peter Parker and Mary Jane. I like the original Spider-Man, but I was a little disappointed  by the film. That's all I remember about ""Spider-Man"" was the epic fight scenes between Spider-Man and The Green Goblin. I went to AMC Theaters, I sat down in my seat, and relaxed. I realized I felt that same feeling again, I haven't felt this emotion in two years, I was happy.  I was even happy to walk into the theater, I know that I'm about to see something spectacular when I'm happy.

The film began, I was very annoyed by the commercials being showed before the film. In my mind I was thinking, ""START THE FILM ."" As the lights dimmed I got excited and as the film began, I heard the musical score and I was thrilled

THE CRITICS

The critics finally got it right. Roger Ebert and Harry Knowles said that this film is probably the best superhero film ever. This time, they were right. My favorite scene was when Peter Parker and Mary Jane were arguing, this scene seems almost human and very emotional. Peter Quotes: ""I'm a person, I'm not just an empty seat, punch me I bleed."" This scene is an awakening to directors who want to direct. I feel that scene has inspired me in a lot of ways. This scene also got me thinking about our love for Marvel Comics. The hero's in Marvel have other jobs besides saving people, and the ""X-Men"" are minority's just like other people on earth. We feel sorry for these characters, so in the end we love them more than anything. The DC Comics hero's are either rich or born rich, we can't really fell anything for them, so why should I care about Batman, or Catwoman. As I was watching the film, I realized that the screenwriters had skipped a few Spider-man comics. The film is focused on the morality and the mythology of ""Spider-Man."" I now know that I was watching the amazing Spider-Man unfold.

This film is the new milestone to not only superhero films, but to all films. It not only redefines action films, but changes the way we look at a person and a hero. I LOVE THIS FILM, I RECOMMEND IT.",1094169600,,2632,4.368098159509202

Doc Octopus is the comic book villain, with a blubbery look that just adds to his dis-appeal. Peter Parker comes across well, too. He's the mousy little loser by day, with his job, schooling, and love life all falling apart. He's also Spiderman, hero to all but one in the city. That's the unsubtle irony. He's too busy saving other lives to keep his own life from falling apart. Spiderman finally realizes that Peter Parker needs saving, too. That phase of the story begins with a triage decision: Spidey walks away from an apparent mugging, giving Parker back his life at someone else's expense.

It's a good story, with some chaste romance (boy has/loses/regains girl), some romantic chases (when MJ is taken hostage), and some teasers for an inevitable sequel. Spiderman was never the Great American Novel and never meant to be. It's just a comic book, with all the good and bad that implies, and this movie captures it perfectly.

1503885,4,B00005JMQW,"I was really looking forward to seeing SPIDER-MAN 2. SPIDER MAN was one of the best comic book movies ever made and with almost all of the original cast returning, being helmed once again by the brilliant Sam Raimi, and having the enigmatic and paradoxical Dr. Ock as the main villain, SPIDER-MAN 2 was a movie I definitely wanted to see.

The movie leaves off two years after SPIDER-MAN ended. Peter Parker is still struggling his way through school while fighting crime at night as Spider-Man. He's living in a run down apartment and keeps losing his jobs because he gets distracted by citizens in distress. His grades are dropping at school and he looks more worn out than parents with a newborn. Peter's best friend from high school, Harry Osborne is doing well and has taken control of OsCorp and turned it around into a competitive profit making business once again. Harry and Peter still have problems in their relationship because Peter refuses to tell Harry what he knows about Spider-Man. As for Mary Jane, she's enjoying the fruits of her labors and is performing in a successful professional theatre. Haunted by the death of Uncle Ben, Peter's inner life is full of conflict and struggle. Things get even more complicated when the famous Dr. Octavius, a man who Peter admires and respects, is transferred into the sinister villain, Doc Ock after a freak accident at OsCorp. What's a guy with amazing powers supposed to do?

As a sequel, SPIDER-MAN 2 is better than most. It successfully continues the story from the original film without leaving audience members who haven't seen the first movie in the dark. The special effects blend seamlessly into the film. There's a great plot and the Doc Ock is perhaps even more complex and enigmatic than the Green Goblin. The acting is superb (especially considering this is a comic book action film) bringing more depth and life into the characters we met in the first movie. And the direction, well what else is there to say except ""Sam Raimi is the man."" (I especially liked his homage to the Evil Dead movies).

However, I was somewhat disappointed by the movie. There aren't as many fights between the hero and villain. Then there are the moments that are pure cheese (e.g. the scene where ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"" is played). It also was apparent that the producers (I won't blame Raimi, because he's too good of a director to purposely do this without some prodding from someone else and I also know that he might not direct the next film) just wanted the movie to blatantly set up the next sequel and begin building the franchise. The first film stood completely on it's on. SPIDER-MAN 2 stands on its own until the last fifteen minutes of the movie. Then it becomes nothing more than one long trailer for SPIDER-MAN 3. This was a drag and severely disappointing, especially in a movie that for the most part, was done so well. It glares like a smudge of coal on a wedding dress and is the one thing that keeps the movie from being the perfect sequel. But don't let that stop you from watching it, because the movie is worth watching. Just ignore the glare at the end.",1094083200,,3141,4.666064981949458

1503962,5,B00005JMQW,"Dang I'm impressed.  I realize that some people would read that as sarcasm but truthfully, I'm being sincere.  This one is without a doubt the best movie of 2004.

On the heels of the first Spiderman movie (a mere two years ago) we find Peter Parker graduated from High School and being put upon by life in general.  Fired from his carpy day job, beset by a grating landlord for the overdue rent on his rinky-dink apartment, missing and failing college classes, lack of love life staring him in the face every time he sees the billboard plastered with his ex-girlfriend's face...we all know guys like this.  Heck, we could all be this guy from time to time.  Even worse, his alter ego as Spiderman is being publicly slandered in the newspaper by his own boss.  Here is one average joe superhero who is taking a massive ego beating.  You're not alone, Charlie Brown.

Hold on action fans, Spiderman 2 is no downer!  There's a good balance between the sympathetic backstory and the energy that lured us into the theaters.  Spidey gets plenty of fight play from Doc Octopus, the new supervillain on the block.  There is a great deal of incredible web-swinging as well, better than in the first film; you really get the sense of fun from the spider's-eye view.  I dare say the animators have finally perfected their art here.

Now a word of caution to parents.  Like me, you may have assumed that since S1 was fairly low on the violence meter that S2 would be similar.  Regrettably, I think the violence level of S2 was jacked up a bit too high for a movie that appeals so widely to children.  There are just a few too many scenes of actual humans being graphically savaged by Doc Oc for my comfort as the parent of a 6-year-old Spidey fan.  If I had realized that I wouldn't have let him see it until we could buy it on dvd and selectively fast forward through the intense parts.

On the whole though, I loved this movie.  I saw a hero that was made more heroic for the fact that he was a very real person with problems who chose to sacrifice his own interests and go fight the good fight anyway.  That's what made this a standout in the genre of comic superhero flicks, the real heroism of the human spirit embodied by Peter Parker.  The cool costume is just a nice bonus (by the way, my eternal thanks to Stan Lee for giving us a superhero without that annoying cape).

Go see this on the big screen while you have a chance to enjoy the maximum effect, then buy this for your kids on dvd later.  It's really worth it.

1503966,5,B00005JMQW,"""Somehow, I've always been standing in your doorway.""
 - Mary Jane Watson tells Peter Parker to open the damn door in ""Spider-Man 2""

On November 30th 2004, the saga of Spider-Man continues as ""Spider-Man 2"" hits DVD for the holiday season of '04.

I got the spec. details today and this sounds like the best version of the film to get.

The Gift Set contains the 2 disc widescreen version of ""Spider-Man 2"", with a reprint of ""Amazing Spider-Man"" number 50 (the issue that inspired the film), 4 postcards that each represent one of the four teaser posters that were released last spring in theaters, a sketch book on character, costume, & set design, and a photo book closing out the set. The box is a black with webbing background, with the image from the final release poster (Spider-Man holding onto Mary Jane) in the center (as of this review, Amazon doesn't have an image of the box art to show).

The movie itself is up there as one of the best sequels in recent memory. Right up there with ""The Godfather part II"", ""The Empire Strikes Back"", ""Terminator 2"", & ""Aliens"".

After his life hits the skids, Peter Parker hangs up his webs as Spider-Man, convinced that New York's popular web-slinger has done nothing to Peter but brought emotional pain to his family & friends and destroyed his life as a whole. But, Mr. Parker is about to get an unwanted second opinion in the form of a certain six-armed Doctor, wreaking havoc throughout New York City.

With great power comes great responsibility.

But, at what cost?

The film has quite a few memorable moments both dramatically, as well as action (the film doesn't drag). The scene where Peter finally confesses to his Aunt what happened the day of his Uncle's death is one of the more powerful and heartbreaking in the film. The SFX are leaps and bounds above the first film. The subway battle is the best in the series so far and the bank heist fight isn't too shabby either.

If you missed this one in its theatrical run, well, your loss, loser! But, this is your chance to get one of the best films of 2004 in a deluxe box set.

If you are one of the three people who missed this one in theaters, I got three words for ya.

1503967,5,B00005JMQW,"Now that the applauds have subsided and the movie has made its money, the main complaint about SPIDER-MAN II from some of the detractors is that Spider-Man revealed his identity to too many people in the film.  However, this is a very minor complaint because this is just a great film.  On an emotional level, it has everything.  On a character level, it has everything.  On special effects, action, and story-telling it has everything (The fight sequences between Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man are outstanding. Also, the elevated train sequence with Spider-Man is an emotional highlight of film and just a great piece of filmmaking. This sequence alone should garner an Academy Award nomination for special effects achievement).  This is by far, the best film adaption of a superhero comicbook character surpassing the first SPIDER-MAN, SUPERMAN:THE MOVIE (I/II) and BATMAN (I/II)movies. All involved stayed close to the source material but the magnification and enhancement of the source material is a hundred-fold and director Sam Raimi put it all together because he has a love and respect for the character(s).  Tobey McGuire was almost a no-go for the sequel due to some behind the scenes health problems (and other situations clouded in mystery), but thank the movie gods that he pulled himself together and made the film because he is so good as 'Peter Parker'.  Alfred Molina is equally great as Doctor Octopus/Otto Octavius, and even this character was expanded to more than a one-dimensional villian. As for the rest of the cast, not one flaw especially the character of Aunt May(Rosemary Harris). The film is laden with a lot of humor, but it is not campy nor is it a distraction to the overall dynamics of the film. This is a very satisfying film bringing to life one of most popular comicbook superheroes in the world and raising the bar for future film adaptions of comicbook heroes.  The film had everything, but this reviewer still wanted more...Looking forward to SPIDER-MAN III.",1093478400,,1997,5.03030303030303
1503968,5,B00005JMQW,"'Spiderman 2' could possibly be the perfect movie. It has action, suspense, romance, drama, and isn't too complicated for the younger audiences. Kids will wow it, adults will be amazed by it.

One way that the film is better than the first is through the internalization that Peter Parker must face. He is Spiderman, and he is Peter Parker at the same time. As we learned in the first installation, 'With great power comes great responsibility,' Parker is forced to take this to heart - trying to maintain the delicate balance between Spiderman, being a student, having a job, and making time for friends and family. Not many people would normally think that a being a superhero could be such a strain. The psychological aspect of the film is worth five stars alone.

The fight scenes are also stunning. There is more feeling in these scenes, especially as Spiderman's identity is unveiled to the world (on the train). The villains are made eviler, as we know that they truly cannot help themselves. The forces working against Spiderman seem more benign, as Parker seems unable to stop them through his Spidey-ways, but still are pain inflicting.

'Spiderman 2' is a sublime movie also because it gives us the power to choose. Ultimately, we must choose our own destinies, our own fates.",1093392000,,1287,4.840909090909091

1504008,4,B00005JMQW,"You would think a sequel to one of the highest grossing films of all time, sixth on the list once Shrek 2 swings past it sometime this summer, would have an easier road to completion but what kind of challenge would that be for the Amazing Spider-Man? As the original film was racking in nearly $115 million in cash at the box office and smashing every box office record in the book, the ink was drying on the deal to develop two sequels for the comic-book superhero, with more to come gathering that the profit margin was still worth the high production price for Columbia Pictures. Unfortunately production for the highly anticipated sequel didn't start off on the right foot with Tobey Maguire, fresh off his new horse-racing drama, Seabiscuit, holding up the film's start date due to complaints about back problems. It didn't take long for the rumors to start churning out possible replacements, among which was the boyfriend of Kirsten Dunst, Jake Gyllenhaal. But, like the web-slinger he plays on the big screen, Tobey bounced back and in a small way, though inadvertently, he demonstrated one of the film's prominent themes.

The story picks up near where the last film left off, only several months in difference, with Peter Parker balancing his personal life and the life of New York's favorite web crawler, Spider-Man. No one said the life of a superhero was going to be easy, though no one said it was going to be quite this hard either. Peter Parker tries as hard as he can to live a normal life but every time he's handed the opportunity to keep his promises, whether it be showing up to Mary Jane's performances, performing his job correctly or paying the rent, the role of Spider-Man gets in the way, thus allowing the one's that depend on him to suffer. As Peter does all he can to balance his two lives, those in the real world are moving on with theirs ... Mary Jane, tired of waiting for Peter to admit his true feelings for her, plans to marry the son of J.J. Jameson, a handsome and successful astronaut. Aunt May, struggling after the death of her husband, falls behind on her house payments and faces eviction from the bank if the late payments are met. Even his best friend, Harry Osborne, has moved on and taken over operations at Oscorp ... but the anger left by the death of his father at the hands of Spider-Man still remains and threatens to push him over the edge. The family business is all that keeps him on the level of sanity and Harry has big plans for Dr. Otto Octavius' new device to create and control fusion power, which, in essence, puts the power of the stars in the hands of mankind. But in a freak accident which results in the death of Octavius' wife and the fusion of the mechanical arms to his spine, Octavius goes on a rampage to finish his work, possibly taking half the city with him if he fails again. Just as he is beginning to enjoy the retirement he has taken from the superhero life, Peter Parker must again put on the suit and fulfill the promise he made to protect the innocent and bring justice to those who deserve it.

The story for Spider-Man 2, though flawed, is without a doubt one of the best comic-book adaptations ever put on screen and excels beyond the expectations set not only by the original but every comic-book franchise that has come before it, including that of the winged one himself, Batman. As was said previously, the storyline is far from perfect and there are some noticeable flaws. Among them, the whole discussion of fusion power between Doctor Otto Octavius and Peter Parker in which they use strange and complex scientific vocabulary and theories is lost on the majority the movie-going public, unless you happen to be on the same level as these individuals but to be sure such people would be few and far between. Granted these individuals are meant to be in sync with the subject of science but since the discussion is so obscure, the audience is just meant to trust what they say, which takes away some of the attachment they are meant to have with the story. And there are moments within the film that seem to last a little longer then some would like them to, and, in part, seem to drag the film a bit, but they are easily forgiveable.

Most, if not all, of the cast from the original film are back for another go-around and there is substantial improvement in their performances from the last time we saw them, though that can not be said of everyone. One performance that fails to disappoint is once again given by Tobey Maguire in the lead role of Peter Parker, or better known as Spider-Man. The non-superhero side of the character appears to get more screen time then in the original which isn't a bad thing. Maguire is given a lot more room to demonstrate emotionally what the character of Peter Parker is going through; at one end attempting to fulfill the promise he made to his Uncle Ben in the role of Spider-Man while at the same time trying to lead the life of a normal human being. Kirsten Dunst, returning to the role of Mary Jane Watson, gives another wonderful performance by maintaining the ""girl next door"" charm she had in the original film but at the same time demonstrating a character that is desperately yearning for something more. Crafted in such the perfect manner, Mary Jane is not another dimwitted damsel in distress as the connection between Spider-Man and Peter Parker slowly begins to develop in her mind. It's hard to say who's the better villain, the Green Goblin (who could forget that terrible costume) or Doc Ock, but even if Doctor Octavius' performance wasn't quite what everyone may have wanted it to be, Alfred Molina fits properly into the role. The only truly bad mark out of the entire cast belongs to James Franco, who drops the ball with his over the top and, at times, flat-out ridiculous performances as Harry Osborne. Rather the see the slow transformation of his impeding insanity, the audience notices the unbalanced behavior of Harry right off the bat and don't really sympathize with his situation, though the understanding of who his father really was may be also to blame. And just when you thought he was gone for good ... don't miss the quick, though wonderfully developed, cameo of William Dafoe as Norman Osborn, which, in turn, hints at the possible villain for the third film.

Overall, Spider-Man 2 delivers most of what the hype and promotion promise, not only in the areas of spectacular special effects and an emotionally driven storyline, but in the film's enduring message of heroism and self-sacrifice. Before rounding off what made this sequel the fulfilling feature it was, let's focus on items that failed to live up to the rest of the film. First, the random shots of normal civilians, though some well placed, were mainly an annoyance. There is one specific shot, when Spider-Man (costume and all) makes his first appearance, where a woman shouts, ""You go, Spidey!"" ... this was humorous for the wrong reason and should have been left out, along with the several long focus shots of people screaming and running in terror. Not that they weren't needed but it was the amount of time Raimi used to focus on them that was the problem. Secondly, as was said earlier, it hard to determine whether the Green Goblin or Doctor Octavius is the better villain as Doc Ock isn't nearly as menacing as Goblin was, though he does offer up more action packed fight sequences in return. Depending on how you felt with the first film, this feature's villain could go either way. Third, some of the sequel's more subtle jokes, namely the homage to Butch Casidy and the Sundance Kid, are lost on the majority of the film's target audience, though they are quite humorous to those that know what they are referring to. And finally, the film's final sequence, in which the audience sees Spider-Man swinging between two helicopters over the rooftops of Manhattan on his way to another crime scene, is quite possibly one of the worse computer animated sequences presented this year and is a severe disappointment considering the sensational sequence the last film ended with. The problem is that the computer graphics are way too obvious and ends the film on quite a sour note considering most of the effects presented in the film were spectacular.

Though the problems of Spider-Man 2 seem to significantly out weigh the good, the film's emotionally driven messages of self-sacrifice and heroism are what truly set this one apart from all the rest. Where the first film hammers the idea that even the most unlikely of individuals in this world can be heroes, the sequel drills home the belief that there is a hero is every one of us ... we just have to make the choice listen to the voice that lets it shine through if it means we have to give up on the things we want the most in life. It's easy to relate the idea of self-sacrifice with the fire and police departments of this country after the tragic events of September 11th but there is another aspect that many of us as Americans fail to respect or even recognize. Right now thousands of American troops are deployed overseas, either in Afghanistan or Iraq, bringing about freedom and opportunity in parts of the world that have not experienced such fundamental principles for over three decades ... they are risking their lives not only for the protection of the American people but to further the causes our founding fathers endowed upon us nearly three centuries ago. It is obvious that there are polarizing views in this country on the conflicts we find ourselves in but there once was a time in America's history where the people of this land looked upon the self-sacrificing men and women of the armed forces with respect and admiration, and, in a slightly smaller way, they still do today. But there are also the people who view these true ""heroes"" with anger and hatred, not understanding nor having the will to accept the good they are doing in the world, despite what many may say. Symbolism of this can be found in Spider-Man 2 and, like in the comic book adaptation, we believe that a time will come when frustration and hatred can be washed away to fully understand the reasoning behind their sacrifice, as well as the sacrifice of every ""superhero"" in this world ... to bring justice to those that deserve it.",1093219200,,10319,4.65825562260011

1504012,5,B00005JMQW,"Spiderman has always been a great comic.  Not because Spiderman was the most powerful superhero, but because he was one of the most human characters.  And this movie does not neglect to show this one bit.

Peter Parker has many concerns, and most of them are because of his alter-ego, Spiderman.  He can't give the attention he wants to give the girl he loves.  His best friend doesn't trust him because of his affiliation with Spiderman.  He can't keep a job.  He isn't doing well in school.  All because being Spiderman is a full-time and often thankless job.  So, he is faced with the possibility of making his life easier by leaving his crime-fighting days behind him.

Worst of all, he is still burdened with the fact that it was his fault that his Uncle Ben was murdered, and this is a heavy burden to carry and not share with others.

And then there is the Spiderman side of this wonderful story.  Spiderman has a new enemy by a scientist turned mad-man with four metal and indestructible arms bent on recreating an invention that could destroy the city.

The action is incredible.  The story is fantastic.  You care and feel for the characters.  This movie is unforgettable and nearly unmatchable.  You've gotta catch this movie if you are one of the few who haven't yet.",1092787200,3,1279,4.613333333333333
1504013,3,B00005JMQW,"This movie actually has everything. Action, drama, romance, comedy, special effect etc. The problem is that all these categories fail to be very mediocre in it. I'm a big fan of the first Spider-Man movie, and I think this one is very mediocre in all aspects.

First, it was so cheesy and phoney at times I couldn't believe it. I'm talking about the special effects and the dialogue. The special effects and stunts were overall OK, but in times looked like a computer game or a cartoon or something. It looks much more realistic in the first movie.

The dialogues in the first one was also much better and obviously less cheesy than here. Pete's aunt is great, but seriously talks too much. The dialogues between the other characters were often very lame and sometimes seem like they were made for 8 year-old children.

Like I said before, Sam Raimi blends here many styles: drama, action, comedy etc. It the first movie it came out great; not in this one. It felt very rushed and confused here.

The ending was so unbelievably cheesy and corny. The cheesiest ending I've ever seen. I'm talking about the last 5 minutes. Those who watched it know what I'm talking about.

I probably sound very negative so far, maybe I just had very high expectations after watching the first movie. but there are positive things too. I gave it 3 starts because I think it was overall OK, it's very entertaining and fun. also, unlike other superhero films, Spider-Man 2 has a HUGE heart. It deals with everyday life questions and friedship and is very kind-hearted.

1504065,3,B00005JMQW,"Oh wait, did I enjoy the first one? I didn't think much of it that's for certain. And along with this one, they're both alright. Not excellent. Not really, really bad either. Having heard this was better than the first, and the CGI was better, I went off to see it. Now lets face it, I could have seen many other films, among them Catwoman, or King Arthur (although it's done by Jerry Bruckheimer, who did Pirates of the Caribbean, and since that was utter clap-trap, I've kinda gone off the idea of begging around to see who would chum me)

To start with, I was very unimpressed by the credits, which are highlights from the first Spiderman. It was Sam Raimi trying to be smart, and it fell flat with me. Very artistic to look at, but I want to see a film, not a bunch of people's names. If you're interested in seeing that, you watch it at the end of the movie!

The CGI was loads better than the first, which had an almost computer game quality to it. Some shots were still a little iffy, but if you're watching for that, then you should really get a life.

I'm still not keen on the casting of this. Tobey MacGuire does nothing for me. The faces he kept pulling, especially when he was exerting himself, were just downright ugly, and he looks too much like the eager boy in class, who knew the answers to every question. Kirsten Dunst can be reasonable, but her hair colour seemed to change continuously, and from what I've seen *ahem* I thought she was a vivacious red head. Not a whiny, practically blonde, oh-I-like-two-guys-I-can't-decide-which-one little girl.

I preferred Doc Ock to the Green Goblin from the first. Dr. Otto Octavious was just a man who loved his wife very much - his face says it all when his wife gets killed, partly by him. He was just a little too into his work at times.

I found this movie to be extremely tedious, and even if I looked away, and then looked back, I hadn't missed anything important. There seemed to be too much talking, and too little action, which I seem to find a common problem in these movies. The only bit of excitement I had was when my Dad whispered in my ear that Bruce Campbell was on the screen, and I leapt out of my seat - but by that time he'd gone off the screen. (He's credited as playing the ""snooty usher"".)

This would have got a much lower rating if it hadn't been for the ending, cos I was about ready to give up all hope of ever getting out of there alive. The ending is really spectacular, and therefore, upped my rating of the movie. It's amazing on the big screen, and Mary Jane features pretty big in the finale - come on, you're all rooting for her to decide on the right person. But you don't do it in your wedding dress or with a very big engagement ring on your finger darling! There are also a lot of hints about a Spiderman 3, so watch carefully. I'm reckoning the next one could go two ways. Two possible bad guys? Maybe not, cos it could rehash this one. But then the other one could rehash the first one. Oh heck, I'm confusing myself now.

Another thing I didn't like was Spiderman taking his mask off, excuse me, but what the heck was the point?! It just didn't ring true. Of course, MJ sees him without his mask on, and suddenly realises she knew it was him all along. Yes dear, whatever dear.

Despite not liking (hate is too strong a word) most of this film, I did enjoy the ending, and it will be interesting to see what they do with the third, without rehashing the first two. And a note to Sam Raimi: please transform Bruce Campbell back to the way he looked in the Evil Dead movies - I'll definitely notice him on screen that way!",1092268800,3,3624,4.288011695906433
1504066,5,B00005JMQW,"I was totally impressed with this dynamite sequel to the first Spider Man movie from 2002. This sequel surpasses that one by light years, even more than X2 surpassed the first one.

 Spider Man, aka Peter Parker, has been wracked with personal problems as of recently. His double life as a student and superhero have been taking a huge toll on his personal life. FIrst his relationship with Mary Jane Watson has been going downhill, his grades are plummeting, his attendance at school has been going downhill and everything else that could go wrong goes wrong. It reaches the point that he decides to give up being a superhero in order to get things straight again.

 His decision however is put to the test when a scientist named Doctor Otto Octavius who Peter has worshipped as an idol has brought forth a project that involves a powerful fusion device that he believes will provide free energy for the entire country from just the one machine he built but when doing an experiment with mechanical, an accident occurs which the fusion causes a super gravititional force and the metal arms fuse onto his spinal cord, he is transformed into Doctor Octopus. Now Peter is faced with the daunting decision to just continue with his normal life or return to slinging webs to battle Dock Ock. Dock Ock aims to rebuild his project even when he realizes the dangers of it after the accident and now Spider Man must aim to save New York from his goals.

 This movie is amazing. The first was great but this one is even better. The comic humor is brilliant especially with J. Jonah Jameson getting ticked off all the time with Spider-Man and wanting to make his left a living hell. The special effects are great and not overdone and they look very realisic especially the fusion reaction that occurs when the machine is activated.

 While not necessarily the greatest sequel of all time (That honor belongs to ""The Godfather Part II, and ""Terminator 2"") this is nonetheless one of the greatest sequels ever and I strongly recommend seeing it today. I cannot wait for this to come out on DVD!!",1092268800,,2083,4.672131147540983
1504067,5,B00005JMQW,"Spiderman was GREAT, but Spiderman II is even BETTER, and that is a very pleasant surprise considering that most would expect the sequel not to be as good.

The movie combines action, adventure and comedy. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding, making this movie one of the best of its kind. The actors' great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again!

The plot, the dialogues, the setting, the special effects, the battles and the costumes are all wonderful!

In short, keep them coming!!!",1092009600,3,626,5.117647058823529
1504068,4,B00005JMQW,"Its taken some time for me to gather my thoughts on this film as I walked away from it with a lot of mixed feelings. The film was fantastic in a lot of ways, but somehow I can't help but feel like it fell short.

 The special effects were fantastic, drastically better than the previous film's poor CGI, and almost as realistic as LOTR's Gollum.

 The story was very good, and enjoyable, but there were some points of the film that I found myself bothered by. Although an over all-enjoyable movie it bothers me that Spidey isn't making jokes at the villain's expense. Readers of the comic know that Spider-man always has a huge arsenal of witty remarks, and quips that are often hilarious and make the over all story a little more light hearted in light of its over all very deep drama. I don't mind that Toby McGuire is still portraying Peter Parker as being somewhat shy and quiet, but once that mask comes on Peter is always talking, and talking a lot. I was disappointed that Spidey didn't make a remark about Doc Ock's hair do. Granted its not the traditional bowl cut, but still...

 It also bothered me that Peter's mask came off so many times throughout the film. Perhaps Sam Raimi is building up to do to Spider-Man in the movies what Daredevil has had happen to him in the comics. Lately there's been a trend of removing the ""secret identity"" element to a lot of super heroes. But the secret identity, and the double life of Peter Parker in an integral part to the overall drama. Peter is risking loosing his secret identity. In reality the people on that train would talk, and sooner or later a description of him would reach the likes of the Daily Bugle... Perhaps this is something that will be explored in a later film, but in the mean time the only ones who should have found out Spidey's Identity are Harry Osborne, and Mary Jane. I'm glad to see Mary Jane and Peter together at last, and I'm also very impressed with how the movie is doing such a brilliant job of handling Harry's decent into insanity. I feel that if Harry becomes the Green Goblin in the next film, however, it'll be too soon. With Mention of Eddie Brock in the first film, and the appearance of Doc Conners in this film it's easy to see that there is room for another villain as Harry slowly slides into insanity. I am begging the producers not to rush that slide! Let it happen gradually.

 Tobey McGuire was great in the first film, this time out he seemed... bored. Distant, disinterested in what he was doing. Moline (Doc Ock) was fantastic, however. It seems that most of the actors did fantastic except McGuire, and Dunst, who just seemed so distracted somehow. I certainly hope this isn't going to lead to cast changes. I hate when that happens in a long-term series.

 I also found Doc Ock's inadvertent dooms day device a bit hokey. In my mind creating a miniature sun isn't even a good dooms day device for a comic book. In fact I roll my eyes any time a villain makes a doomsday machine. I wish that Doc Ock's motives had been more similar to that of Ultimate Doc Ock's... more in the line of he's been turned into a freak, and is angry, and wants revenge on those at fault. Perhaps he could have blamed Harry Osborne for the mishap and would be trying to kill him? Regardless of the doomsday device Doc Ock was fantastic in this movie, even if he strayed quite a bit from the comic character that inspired him.

 It is beginning to worry me that Spider-Man will follow in Batman's footsteps of killing every villain. I understand the killing of Norman Osborne, Green Goblin has been killed in the comics (several times) but would it hurt to have the villain say... go to jail? Perhaps they could be reused in later stories?

 These issues aside Spider-Man 2 is a great epic adventure, its a lot of fun, quickly paced, and does a great job of keeping audience members at the edge of their seat. Despite minor complaints the over all experience is so enjoyable that most people will not notice its flaws.",1092009600,5,4000,4.461643835616439
1504069,5,B00005JMQW,"Wow!!!!!! This is really a good sequal!!! Usually sequals suck,but this was a HUGE exception. I thought the acting was great(especially from Tobey as Peter/Spidey and Alfred as Doc Ock)the storyline was really good and the action scenes were jaw-dropping. Overall,THIS is the greatest comic book movie,This is the perfecct sequal to the first,and THIS is the film to see this summer. See this now!!!!!",1092009600,2,401,5.184615384615385
1504070,5,B00005JMQW,"One of the best summer movies, of the 2004 summer movie season! Spider-man 2 was definitely worth the 2 year wait in theaters. Much more action can be seen in this movie than in the first. If that is at all possible! Sam Raimi did well in this movie, to move along the story in the Spider-man movie franchise.

I originally had mild reservations about this sequel however the were unfounded. Sam Raimi did well humanizing Spider-man/ Peter Parker. The director also does well drawing in the audience. To ""care"" about the characters, good or evil. The actors have definitely grown into their characters. (See my review on the first ""Spider-man"" movie.) This can be both good and bad. We'll have to see what happens.

I for one can't wait to see what they do for ""Spider-man 3.""  I just hope Spider-man doesn't run into the same fate as the Batman franchise. Different actors playing lead roles in a movie sequels can hurt business.

Spider-man 2! Better than the first film! Recommended!",1091923200,2,986,4.715116279069767
1504129,4,B00005JMQW,"This is one of the few times that the sequel is better than the original movie. Now that the origin of the superhero was narrated in the first ""Spider-Man"", the creative team was free to explore new elements of the abundant universe of the comic. In few words the story is better because they used more elements this time.

 In ""Spider-Man 2"", Peter Parker is caught in a dilemma: he must use his powers or he must quit and resume his normal life? Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is a more developed character this time, she is Spidey's love interest, but she now wants to move on with or without Peter. Also Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) plays an important role in ""Spider-Man 2"", her dialogues are richer and her performance is tender and sweet, just like Aunt May in the comics.

 This time Harry Osborn (James Franco) is more important than just a good friend, Harry presents another dilemma to Spidey. And the villain is a big improvement over the ""Green Goblin"", Willem Dafoe was great in the first movie, but Alfred Molina as ""Doctor Octopus"" is one of the best villains in a comic-based movie. ""Spider-Man 2"" covers much more ground than the first movie.

 The special effects are very improved, still there are some effects that look like a videogame, but overall the visual and sound effects are convincing and help to built the action. By the way, this movie has the most incredible action sequences seen so far in a comic-based movie, the action is bigger and better.

 The music is more dynamic in ""Spider-Man 2"", Danny Elfman used some of the old tracks, and added new ones. The cast and the director seem more comfortable in ""Spider-Man 2"". Kirsten looks better with her new hairstyle, she was the ideal girl next door in the first movie, but now she looks like the ideal Mary Jane Watson (Parker). Tobey Maguire is as reliable as always, Alfred Molina is outstanding as Doc Ock and the rest of the cast is very solid.

 ""Spider-Man 2"" has a little bit of everything: it has action, drama, romance, comedy, good performances, great direction by Sam Raimi, outstanding visual and sound effects, and it's better than the first one. Can't wait for the DVD release.",1091750400,,2167,4.649214659685864
1504130,5,B00005JMQW,"Spiderman 2 was everything I had hoped it to be and then some. While watching it, I truely felt like I had been transported right into a comic book. They did an incredible job of keeping the essential elements of comics in the movie and portraying them right. In the movie, just like the comic, the most important character is the elusive girl. While Spiderman 2 is an action packed super hero flick, you could equally argue that it's a love story.

Peter Parker once again has to deal with his desire to be with Mary Jane but unwillingness to place her in harms way. He has to balance his lifestyle of being both a normal newspaper photographer and a crimefighting superhero. These worlds often collide, and have adverse effects on Parker. He struggles to keep his identity secret and struggles to deal with demons from his past. He also struggles with the shortcomings of his costume (you'll understand when you watch it).

Man vs. Nature, Man vs. Man, and Man vs. Himself. All those elements of conflict are in the movie and they keep you on the edge of your seat and biting your fingernails. Sure you know Spiderman won't die, but that doesn't mean that things will work out perfectly. Situations arise that weave a web of conflict (pun intended) between the characters and bind them together. The characters are round and dynamic and behave how you would expect normal people to behave. They get angry and sad. Dissappointed and happy. And when the pressure builds to points where they can't take things anymore, they fold.

Unlike a lot of sequels, Spiderman 2 is not a standalone film. True, you could watch it without seeing the first and get the gist of things but there are a lot of tie ins to the first film (and even some hints to the third film). I loved watching how the characters have evolved in between the two films. I thought it was particularly interesting how Harry Osbourne had learned how to handle his father's company and grown into being a businessman. The film is just like a comic book in the sense that the characters are always evolving and issues from the past always have effects on the future.

The action sequences were incredible. The computer generated graphics looked amazingly real. One of my favorite scenes in the movie involves Doc Ock using his arms to mercilessly attack a team of doctors (the scene reminds me of the Evil Dead series). I liked how they created the conflict between Spiderman and Doc Ock. The Doc didn't want to kill Spiderman just for the hell of it, he had a good reason to battle the webslinger. And when they did fight, it was awesome. I loved seeing Spiderman struggling to handle the eight armed Doctor Ock.

The movie also has several comedic moments. Bruce Campbell has a hilarious cameo and there are, of course, cheesy one liners. What comic book movie would be complete without those?

I don't really have any big problems with this movie. Overall, I don't like Doc Ock as much as the Green Goblin, but I still think he is a great villain. I don't think the theater I saw it in had the volume turned up as high as it needed to be, but that's not a problem with the actual film. I guess the biggest problem is that I'll have to wait two to three years for the third installment. Oh well. Patience is a virtue.

I could write a lot more on the movie, but I don't want to give away too much. Go out there and enjoy the movie for yourself. It's nice to watch a sequel done right.

1504131,5,B00005JMQW,"This film is quite possibly the best film sequel ever made.  It outshines the 2001 original.  The action, special effects, acting, story, and the villain are all improved.  The action is this film is heart pumping, non stop, and fun to watch.  The special effects have greatly improved over the past three years, especially in the aerial shots of New York City.  The acting in the film is better especially in Mary Jane's character.  The story is definately improved, due to the emphasis on Harry Osborne's hate of Spiderman, and Peter Parker having to juggle his life around being a superhero.  Another great aspect of this film is the new villain, Doc. Oc.  This villain you can hate and sympathize with unlike the totally sinister green goblin.  The film's ending sets up perfectly for a third installment to this wonderful film series that will last for generations.",1091491200,2,870,4.863945578231292
1504132,5,B00005JMQW,"I enjoyed the first film and just like X2 I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel even more. The effects were much improved from the first film. It seems that John Dykstra and crew have fine-tuned the CGI Spider-Man not to look too cartoony.

 Maguire's seem to have grown into the role of Peter Parker and looks more comfortable in all his scenes. The rest of the cast were more than adequate enough in the roles they had to play. The stand-outs other than Maguire have to be Alfred Molina's Dr. Otto Octavius. Molina's humanizing take on Doc Ock raises the character from just your ordinary power-mad supervillain into a tragic figure driven mad by circumstances beyond his control. Unlike Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin, Molina doesn't chew up the scenery but instead takes a more understated approach in portraying Spidey's nemesis. Kudos must also go to J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jameson. His scenes were some of the funniest in the film and accurately brings to life the character from the comics. Some of his lines are straight from the comics themselves.

 As some may have mentioned the script and some of the dialogue can be weak and corny. I have to admit that they are at that, but the script overall wasn't as bad as some may have pointed out. The overall tone of the film and its script has the feel of a comic book. This is a comic book film and as such I went into it thinking of it as one. Some of the dialogue are bad and to be honest the dialogue in the comic itself can be bad. But the effect some of the corny dialogue had on me wasn't enough for me to thoroughly enjoy the whole film. Alvin Sargent's (two-time Oscar winning screenwriter) may have had his hands full trying to convey the feel of the Spider-Man comics in 2 hours. I think Michael Chabon's (Pulitzer-prize winning author of The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay: a novel about comic books)help in doctoring the script may have helped save the enitre tone of the film from becoming too corny. I hope they hire him to write the third film instead of just helping on it.

 One thing, I like to point out is the effects used for Dock Ock's mechanical tentacles. As I watched the film the first time then a second time a few days later, I still couldn't tell when the CGI tentacles and the animatronic tentacles were on-screen. The effects work on Ock's helpers has to be some of the best FX work I have seen. The tentacles themselves seem to have individual personalities as they came to life.

 And for all Evil Dead fans, Raimi was generous enough to bring in Bruce ""He is God"" Campbell to make a cameo in one of the funnier scenes in the film. Raimi also brings abit of a Evil Dead vibe to the hospital scene w/ Octavius pre-Dock Ock.

 For a summer blockbuster and comic book superhero film, I recommend this film. It's not Citizen Kane and when taken for the whole of its parts Spider-Man 2 succeeds and entertains.",1091404800,4,2887,4.481904761904762

One minute, some mind-blowing FX are turning your knuckles white with heart-thumping application of digital dolby, then suddenly you see that thrill casually offset by some cheeky humor or some humane spotlight on relationships. None of which ends up too sappy.

Barring a stray cheesy moment or two that sneaked in (e.g., the final 5 minutes that slyly burrow a small hole to fit a Part 3 in), I don't have enough praise for this absolutely dazzling summer spectacular for your entire family!

This movie is where Peter learns about how to balance his hero and his human side. I was moved to almost tears in a few scenes,especially when Harry finds out who Spidey really is and he is fighting whether to kill him or not. Mary Jane is another whole issue knowing that he loves her/also realizing he can't have her as he wanted,and finally telling his aunt how is uncle died.

1504207,5,B00005JMQW,"Spiderman is back in one of the best sequels since The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  This time Peter Parker is trying to juggle keeping a job, maintaining a run-down apartment, keeping his grades up, while continuing his Spidey exploits.

Peter starts regretting his life as Spiderman because it interferes with all other parts of his life, especially his hidden love for Mary Jane Watson.  This starts to affect his powers.  Sometimes his webs fail to fire and his vision starts to go back to what it was before he was bitten by an enhanced arachnid.  Peter must make a decision whether or not he wants to give up being Spidey and try to better his Peter life or stick to the credo he learned from his dying Uncle Ben (with great power comes great responsibility).

Meanwhile his friend Harry (who is obsessed with killing Spiderman) is now one of the heads of Oscorp and is funding a scientist who has a new way to generate atomic energy.  Dr. Octavius has a way to create and harness a tiny sun.  This is through the use of robotic metal arms that are attached to his body and controlled through a computer chip that feeds impulses to his brain.  Something goes wrong with the experiment and the chip gets destroyed.  Out of control, the arms take control of Octavius's mind, turning him into the evil Dr. Octopus.

The special effects outdo the original and Alfred Molina is likeable as the unfortunate Dr. Octopus (unlike the annoying and pompous villain portrayed by Willem Defoe in the first film).  The movie overdoes the comedy somewhat.  There is a take-off from Midnight Cowboy (done to the tune of Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head) and J. Jonah Jameson is one joke after another.  However, the ending is great!  The movie also sets up for the possibility of at least two villains in the next film (Harry Osborne and The Lizard, who was Dr. Curt Connor in the comic).

1504209,5,B00005JMQW,"With ""Spiderman 2"", Director Sam Raimi delivers that rarest of beasts: an action/adventure movie with real emotional depth. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) finds himself at odds with his super hero powers. His crime-fighting duties have left him penniless, red-eyed with exhaustion, and in danger of flunking out of college. What's more, his long-time love, MJ (Kirsten Dunst) is on the brink of cutting him out of her life. Although he can save children from careening cars, he can't help Aunt May stop the foreclosure on her house. So what's a superhero to do? Even the villain - brilliant scientist Dr. Octavius turned Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) - is conflicted as his mechanical arms transport him into a life of crime. However, these emotional complications do not wreck the flow of the action; the fight and chase sequences are high-paced, sometimes even too tumultuous to take it all in, and they ratchet up the tension scene by scene. The humorous and ironic moments serve as yet another layer of texture.

 From the stunning graphic art sequence of the opening credits to the final scene, ""Spiderman 2"" is a visually impressive film, even more so than the first. In this sequel, everything seems to come together, from the comic book feel to the Hollywood special effects to the acting to the screenplay itself. Although the person accompanying me complained that the film had ""too much talking"", I felt the balance between action and character development was perfect.

 If you liked the first ""Spiderman"", you'll like this one even more. Naturally, you can't expect an art film here, or even a drama, but Spiderman 2 excels at what it sets out to do: bring the comic book to life in an action movie.",1090886400,8,1711,4.889655172413793

Comic book and movies are usually aimed at little kids, buit I could tell that this wasn't when a whole freaking theatre of the little brats was screaming, ""IS IT OVER YET?!"" about an hour into the movie and every five minutes.

 This was an excellent movie taking place a little while after the first one ended. It shows Peter Parker trying to jugle being a superhero, trying to make a living, and being there for loved ones all at once. It doesn't work out, as saving lives is top priority and he can't tell anyone about his secret for reasons of safety and love. Very interesting, kids don't get any of that of course.

 Doctor Octopus rocked too. A way better villian than the Green Goblin and octavius was way more charismatic than that whatever his name was that went psycho as the Green Goblin. Very enjoyable and fun movie, looking to be the best superhero series ever made.",1090886400,2,938,4.4678362573099415

If Peter Parker were like this in real life, he'd be on Zoloft and would have ulcers from all the worry going on inside his head. I can only hope that young people today aren't going through near as much turmoil as Peter Parker or his love-interest. Both of them are sad. Just very, very sad.

 And Doc-Oct? I liked him and thought that did a real disservice to him by giving him such small content to work with. And what a lame storyline! The man created a machine that equals the power of the sun and then it's completely destroyed by simply drowning it? Nothing blown up? No waves of mass destruction? It's the POWER OF THE SUN, for goodness sakes! That storyline had the same effect as placing the tip of a lit match into a small pool of water. How stupid!

 Where was the action? Buried in Peter's muses, that's where! This guy was so depressing that I'm surprised he even knew that he had super powers to begin with. ""Oh, woe is me! I can't make up my mind about life and...wait! what's this? Super Powers? What am I? I'm a freak! A freak, I say! But I'll defeat crime with my newfound skills ....that is, until I get confused again (which won't take long). Woe is me! Woe is me!""

1504212,4,B00005JMQW,"Following up on a successful film--especially a runaway blockbuster like the original SPIDER-MAN--is always a risky undertaking, and one which frequently falls flat. Fortunately director Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and company are up to the challenge in SPIDER-MAN 2, the rare sequel to live up to its predecessor. When ambitious scientist Dr. Otto Octavius is transformed into a metal-tentacled man-monster in an experiment gone awry, even J. Jonah Jameson knows Spider-Man is the only one who can stop him. Or can he? And as if the rampaging Doctor Octopus isn't enough, everyone's favoite Wallcrawler must also contend with the generally grisly ups and downs of everyday existence as he struggles in vain to hold together something resembling a normal life as Peter Parker: his grades are slipping, he can't hold on to a job, best friend Norman Osborne obsesses over Spider-Man's demise, he's on the brink of losing Mary Jane forever to no less than Jonah Jameson's son, and even his relationship with his beloved Aunt May suffers. It's all enough to make even a hero consider throwing in the towel. But if Peter Parker isn't Spider-Man, then who is he?

  This is a tremendously exciting movie, with great stunts and special effects and the battles between Spider-Man and Doc Ock are a wonder to behold. But like the first Spider-Man flick, the sequel goes beyond the action and spends a lot of important time building characterization with all the leads. The characters in this movie are not just punching bags. They are real people with real-world problems and there are no easy answers. The script is literate and well-crafted, with the theme of identity/self-discovery skillfully interwoven throughout. Though it is a much more serious film than many comic-book adaptations, there is some nice comic relief and the sense of wonder never wavers.

  One reason for the success of the Spider-Man films is great casting. Tobey Maquire is of course letter-perfect as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, capturing the essence of the iconic Everyman superhero flawlessly. Kirsten Dunst is an excellent Mary Jane as well, and in some ways her portrayal of the character is more likeable than the one in the comic book. And Alfred Molina hits Doc Ock dead-on, bringing one of comicdom's great villains to devastating life just as effectively as Willem Dafoe did the Green Goblin. Many forget that for several years Doctor Octopus was Spider-Man's number-one enemy dating back to Spider-Man #3, when Doc Ock was the fist villain to beat Spider-Man head-to-head (temporarily, of course), but no one will doubt his status in Spider-Man's rogues' gallery after seeing this movie!

  The only real complaint I have with this film is that Doctor Octopus's character is drawn much more sympathetically than in the source comic, though his personal crisis does parallel Peter Parker's own quite nicely.

  Whether or not it's equal or better to the original in every respect, SPIDER-MAN 2 is highly entertaining cinema that most fans will love. The adventure, drama, and romance are all exceptionally well-done, and SPIDER-MAN 2 is certainly one of the best superhero movies ever made.",1090800000,3,3177,5.135658914728682

1504214,5,B00005JMQW,"OK, I'm not going to cover the plot as every one already has. I am going to say that Spiderman 2 was superior to the original, and I greatly enjoyed the original.  There was a lot more character development in this one, which is one reason it has gotten such rave reviews.  I actually sympathized with peter, though after the end of the first one and seeing the trailer i thought he was too whiny, the film shows why he did what he did. And of course the movie delivered on the Stan Lee and Bruce Campbell cameos.  I was surprised to see willem defoe return.  The action scenes are spectacular, despite the beatings spidey took, i cringed when he fell off the building and bounced off those two cars.

  Though excellent, this film does have its flaws.  First, doc ock's tentacles don't have a personality, it was an interesting take and cool to see him talking to one, it just seemed to echo green goblin a bit too much, science experiment going wrong and leading to split personality villain.  Second, Venom is not the villain in three, I know Harry becomes the green goblin in the comics so it had to happen eventually, and to the reviewer who said that it was cliche, raimi was just following the story.  I just wanted to see venom as the villain, hopefully in 4.  anyways hope that helps, I really want this movie to make more money then the passion cause that movie sucked.",1090713600,2,1379,4.432539682539683
1504215,5,B00005JMQW,"""Ladies and gentlemen, fasten your seat belts.""

 Spider-Man 2 was everything a comic book movie should be. From the opening credits, which were done cleverly by using comic stills to explain the events of the first film, to the closing credits, I sat in the jam packed sold out movie theater mesmerized as Sam Raimi flawlessly put together the definitive comic book movie.

 To begin with, I enjoyed this movie more than the first one in every category. I felt more characterization. I could relate with Parker's emotions on a higher level than the first movie. Also, all of the other characters put on better acting performances than the previous installment. The overall plot, I felt, was better too. This time, the plot surrounded Peter Parker, played by Toby Maguire, going through the days with his ongoing struggle as he leads on a double life. He has no time for his friends, his school work; he's even on the brink of being fired from his job of a pizza delivery boy. Meanwhile, he wants his relationship with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) to grow, but he has never made a move, because he can't, being Spider-Man and all. Harry Osbourne, played by James Franco, continues to be friends with Peter, but has an ongoing growing hatred for the man that killed his father, Spider-Man. From there, we meet Dr. Otto Octavious, a good hearted scientist that wants to create a new type of fusion energy. At the same time, he has created four mechanical arms, able to work with the reaction which he straps onto his body. With the use of trillium, supplied by OsCorp, Dr. Otto Octavious attempts this fusion process. However, things take a horrific turn for the worse when the reaction gets out of control and leaves Dr. Octavious victim to an explosion that leaves the mechanical arms welded to his body. Thus, Dr. Octopus, or Doc Ock as they call him, is born. From there, the movie becomes a dazzling spectacle of directing at its finest. Despite the action sequences being amazing, Sam Raimi does a magnificent job of making them believable, and not overdoing them either. There is still a lot of focus on Peter Parker, which makes this the most accurate and best comic book adaptation to date.

 Although I liked the first Spider-Man, I felt the acting was a little dry, and there wasn't as much onscreen chemistry between Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. This, however, is all fixed in Spider-Man 2. Toby Maguire is now an even more believable Peter Parker, and Kirsten Dunst is great as Mary Jane. Also, the two of them seemed to click onscreen, as they seem to work so well together. Willem Dafoe was great as the Green Goblin in the first Spider-Man, yet I felt that Alfred Molina was even greater as Dr. Octopus in this one.

 Growing up and watching the corny Spider-Man television cartoon on Fox Kids, Dr. Octopus has always been my favorite villain in the series. I imagined the fantastic possibilities of the use of the mechanical arms in combat, and while I felt my thoughts were creative, the fight scenes in this movie were better than I could have imagined. An amazing combat sequence atop a speeding train is among my favorite sequences, but there are others, and I won't go into detail of them. I can tell you though, I was very pleased.

 It seems director Sam Raimi has hit a homerun with this one. Improving upon the first installment in every category, it seems Sam Raimi has finally found his groove. The film sets up a third installment, and all I can say is that I literally can't wait. I hear May 2007 is the tentative date of release. Overall, Spider-Man 2 combines everything that a comic book movie should be to create an exhilarating ride that shouldn't be missed by any movie watcher. Much recommended.

1504216,4,B00005JMQW,"I agree with all the ultra positive reviews here (effects great, character development strong, etc) and I thought the film was good, maybe better than the first,

 But...just a few detractions

 I felt like it went too far in tie-ins to the first film.

 I know the intro comic has gotten rave reviews, but think...it was actually a bit boring. I knew what happened in the first film already! (Two Towers seemlessly continued The Fellowship.) A different SM comic would have been more interesting to read. Maybe something filling in the gaps between SM1 and SM2?? That might even make the DVD credits worth freeze-framing to reveal added details (like in the Def Leppard music video of 'Women'), but there was nothing new that I could see... Will we have a 25 minute comic intro to SM3?

 The tie-in linking Doc Oc to Harry was great! It was well done and molded with the larger (multi-film) plot incredibly well. Although maybe a bit too much fore-shadow to the next movie.

 Not a tie-in per se, PP losing his powers was a bit silly and strung out a bit to long.

 The mini tie-ins, ie. The ""Spidey Singer"" and the ""New Yorkers stick together"" theme, underscored from the first film were okay, because they were very short. But kinda reminded me of the tireless repetition between Austin Powers 1&2.

 Finally, The tie-in of MJ to JJJ's son was just too much. Many alternatives could have been used to give JJJ more screen time. I thought it was a bit TOO convenient, too much of a coincidence. I suppose it could create more conflict if PP ends up breaking up MJ and JJJ Jr. next movie or something, and JJJ hates him for it, but still needs his pix. (sort of a lame subplot though). I'd rather see PP go to another paper that pays him well and allows him to develop some new Spidey gadgets! haha!",1090713600,,1800,4.498461538461538
1504293,4,B00005JMQW,"The return of Tobey Maguire with Spiderman 2 is thrill to watch on a big screen keeping high on adrenaline as well as emotions as the web slinger makes sure that justice must triump over vindictiveness. This reminds of many Comic characters and how they were created! Stan Lee created the cartoon character Spiderman 40 years ago over protests from his superiors at Marvel Comics. As far as I know, Now 79, Lee no longer works on the Spiderman comics. By inventing a nerdy Peter Parker and giving him a secret life as angst-ridden super hero, Lee brought new sophisticational and emotional depth to what had been considered a child's genre. This movie has a heart and technical artistry alongwith the subtle allusions to the 9/11 devastation, the imaginative set designs, the astounding computer generated stunts and crackerjack tempo that keeps one engrossed. The young new yorker Toby maguire may possess incredible powers but still can't declare his feelings to the love (kirsten Dunst) of his life. Although, she is engaged to be married to an astronaut, he's hopelessly tongue tied. And than a lunatic scientist (Alfred) equipped with lethal tentacles must be vanquished before it is too late. Save the city and somehow win the girl's heart form the double agenda of the always do-well Spiderman. A great movie to watch with the screen story co-written by the celebrated novelist Michael Chabon. A good entertainer 'Spiderman'",1090713600,,1431,5.042194092827004
1504294,3,B00005JMQW,"I liked the first one and the second one here is ""Good""...not great or ""Spectacular"" but just ""good"".

 There was much too much talking in this one and less action. I like the fact however that for once the makers of a movie didn't rely HEAVILY on Special Efx, ie ""CGI"" to make the movie interesting like all these supposed summer blockbusters that Bombed this year so far. It was great that they delved more into Peter Parkers every day life, how he thinks, what his aspirations are, his fears, his love for MJ...but they dragged it a bit longer than necessary to the point that we want to say ""Alright already!""

 It was funny at first seing Peter Parker get dumped on by everybody in his life:

 1. Jamison Firing and hiring him in less than 5 seconds

 2.getting fired from the Pizza spot

 3.hiding out from his landlord for not paying his rent

 4. College Professor telling him to basically shape up or ship out

 5. MJ getting engaged to another man

 6.and most of all getting ""bitch slapped"" in front of everyone by his supposed best friend Harry Osbourne.

 I thought to myself ""god he's just having a real BAD week to say the least!"" then it wasn't funny anymore because you thought how much can this guy be in ""loser-ville"". Is there anything else in this movie that he can at least get good credit for doing when he's NOT Spiderman? Granted Peter Parker is a nerd but geez, give him a break! Even Clark Kent from Smallville doesn't get dumped on like this...and he too is going through the SAME EXACT things..but that's a different story...

 When there WAS action in the movie it was awesome. Excellent special efx and State of the art CGI efx. Fighting on the side of a skyscaper was exciting to watch.

 As far as Doctor Octopus he was missing in Action for alot of the movie, as a villain his character wasn't developed enough...in some cases at all. His goal was to continue his experiment to.......????. You never saw what he was developing after the malfunction changed him nor found out what he meant to do with this experiment once succeeded, after all; what good is a scientific breakthrough if it has no real meaning to anyone? Why Rob a bank to get funding when you know everyone knows it's you that did it? I mean if you rob a bank who really wants to discuss or do business with you afterwards??

 With his new great strength and powers he didn't really put it to much advantage.

 He wasn't ""testing it out"" on any crimes or innocent people like the average villain.

 At times I forgot about his character and got caught up reluctantly into the ""soap opera"" of Parker's life. ""Doc Ock"" was really likable even when he turned bad...you kind of felt sorry for him.

 A few other underdeveloped characters were MJs fiance'...what was that about?

 What happened to the landlords daughter? She liked Peter but nothing happened...at all.

 I don't think it was a good idea to make Spiderman reveal who he was to damn near every other person:

 1. His doctor (that ""I have a friend who dreams he's spiderman...."" ) we all know that when someone says that it's really THEM...the doctor would be stupid not to pick that up.

 2. The people on the train (in New York money is to be made..people would be using there cell cams and cameras to take pictures of who Spiderman is and sell it to the Enquirer and Daily news) what was the purpose of him taking it off in the first place??Because he couldn't breathe with it on or see with it on?? He's been through worse situations and he never took it off under any circumstances.

 3. Revealing to MJ (this was too quick)

 Who is the one mending Spiderman's torn outfits???

 Peter PArker sews??

 The movie once again was good but broke no new ground. Still an entertaining movie.

 I guess we can prepare again to see the Green goblin again? What about Spiderman's other enemies...the Juggernaut? why waste the final spiderman on the same character from the first???",1090627200,2,3935,4.507082152974505
1504295,4,B00005JMQW,"This is such a great movie. It is very well done. The characters, plot, story are all better. One thing for sure is that SM2 does not have a lame villain like the first movie. My only complaints are that as cool as he is, Doc Ock didn't get that much screen time. And the ending could have been more exciting/",1090627200,,309,4.081967213114754
1504296,5,B00005JMQW,"The Child Factor: We went without the kids. While the film remarkably contains no cursing or overtly sexual overtones (just a little kissy-kissy on the couch between MJ and her boyfriend) there is still some violent imagery. Though none of it is graphic meaning bloody and gory nor prolonged, if your kids have a fear of actual spiders or multi-limbed ""monsters"" in general, the imagery of the villian may disturb them. I also noted that a couple of trailers may bother the young ones. Particularly there was a preview for an ""Anaconda"" sequel that could be freightening for them.

 The Review: Often a ""something 2"" movie tends to be ""darker"". This means that the makers take off the gloves and up the ante with more violence, a more sinister and morbid feel and in some cases an overdoing of special effects. I don't feel that this movie falls into that trap.

 Peter, besides a new villian to battle, has a more intangible foe challenging him this time around: his own personal demons. He has a love for MJ that he can't share with her, he has a conflict with his best male friend who beleives that Peter is ""protecting"" the identity of the man who killed his father, not knowing his dad was the evil Green Goblin. Additionally, he is carrying the guilt he feels for causing his uncle's death by not stopping the robber who ultimately murdered Ben in the first release. To top it off, his material life is falling apart. He loses his job, has to duck his landlord who's owed back rent, and lives in a real crappy apartment. (which is refreshing real as opposed to the huge lofts or suites that movie characters always seem to have in cities with a high cost of living despite the lack of a discernable job or other means of income.)

 Peter deals with the threat of the villian and his personal problems as a human being instead of relying solely on his powers to bail himself out. Perhaps a nod to the failure when tried to do that in order to win enough money to buy a car to impress MJ. What insues is an intersting character study of a honest young man with a gift that he didn't ask for and a resulting life that is complicated to say the least. I actually felt more tension from his internal struggles than the external one having to battle ""Doc Oct"" as Jamison calls him.

 Without playing the spoiler role all I will say is that Peter follows his heart and instincts as he addresses a web of evil, love, friendship, redemption, and destiny, both in and out of costume. The effects and visual are great and there is a definite stylistic mood of a Spiderman movie which is urgent and foreboding yet somehow warm, never feeling over the the top. (For some reason, I liked what could be considered a ""throw away"" scene where Peter enjoys a piece of cake and some milk with his landlord's daughter who is shly attracted to him. It's cute and a nice little relief from Peter's battles on the ""streets"" and within himself.)

 The Moral Tone: Some may be turned off by me going there but to others it may be important as it is to me. I like the character of Peter. Though conflicted you can feel that at his core he is a grounded, solid person who is ultimately lead by a desire to do the right thing. While many movie heroes fall into the judge/jury/executioner mode, Peter stays above that led by his heart rather than his powers or raw emotions. MJ, while now successful with modeling and a budding career on Broadway, has not let her looks and ""fame"" turn her vain or shallow. She remains down to earth, open, and very likeable.

 Aunt May is also refreshing as a strong woman who despite still grieving the loss of her husband has come through it as a positive, affirming, and loving person. Even Doc Oct has a loving relationship with his wife early in the picture before the perfunctory accident changes him into a villian. Near the end his humanity re-emerges before it is too late. If you a Christian in particular, I didn't seen anything in this regard that will cause you to leave the theater feeling mocked or let down. A good number of movies seem to espouse the idea of ""nothing is black and white in morality"" and that everybody is evil. it's just a question of to what degree in each person. Whether this is true or not, when I go to the theater I need to see ""good"" triumphant and I get upset when the message is that no is truly fulfilled until they off 50 people or raze a city. The central characters while not being perfect clearly choose to take a better road.

 Overall, my wife and I enjoyed ourselves. I would recommend it if you liked the first movie or enjoy the super hero genre in general.",1090627200,,4621,4.440377804014168

In addition to the special effects and romance in the movie, there are also may comedic scenes. Very funny scenes showing you how helpless Peter is. The comedy that is inter-woven into Spiderman makes the movie even more enjoyable.

1504301,2,B00005JMQW,"Ok, I'm going to attempt to sum up this movie. Take the first Spiderman movie and replace Green Goblin with Dr. Octopus, and you generate Spiderman 2. Was I the only one smart enough as to realize this? Then as if to piss all over my better judgement, critics are calling this ""the best superhero movie ever"". First of all, the superhero movie genre is inherently stupid in the first place, because from beginning to end, you know exactly what will happen. So in other words, people just like to see moving pictures since we already know how the movie will begin and end.

 In case nobody noticed, all he did was fly around from his web in parts 1 and 2. Then there was a some talking between Peter parker and Mary Jane. Big deal. Another useless movie this year getting rave reviews. And well-written and original movies that came out this year like Secret Window and H.P. & the prisoner of Azkaban go unnoticed.

1504342,4,B00005JMQW,"The second installment of the ""Spider-Man"" saga is likely to be the crown jewel of the series, a blend of comic fantasy and human realism that satisfies action addicts just enough while exploring duality and classist society as well as the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy.

 In Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst director Sam Raimi has a couple that transcends the genre: They are not their generation's best actors - Maguire's squeaky turn in ""Seabiscuit"" proves that - but their personalities - bright, humble, hopeful, just a smidge goofy - are perfectly attuned to this fare. They like others, they like each other, we like them. ""Spider-Man 2"" works on other levels, but mostly because Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson are kids we'd be proud to know (or raise), played by actors who still seem closer to Earth than Hollywood.

 The sequel begins two years after the original: Peter is balancing crime-fighting, college and a pizza job while Mary Jane does off-Broadway Oscar Wilde (to unlikely full houses.) Peter's friend Harry (James Franco) still vows vengeance against Spider-Man for killing his father; he's also bankrolling a Nobel scientist working on fusion, Dr. Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina).

 Octavious, who wears artificially intelligent mechanical arms to work the ball of energy, is a idol of Peter's, who happens to be writing a paper on the doctor on the day of invention unveiling, when all goes awry. The accident leaves Octavious at the behest of the giant, powerful mechanical arms, who immediately want to recreate the experiment by any means necessary.

 Meanwhile, Peter is torn between duty and Mary Jane. His instincts and web slings are on the blink. He's late to Mary Jane's play. He loses the pizza job. He's on the outs with his Aunt May (an excellent Rosemary Harris). Harry wants Peter to produce Spider-Man. And newspaperman J. Jonah Jameson (J.K Simmons) still runs Spidey through the wringer on the front page of his tabloid. Peter seriously begins to contemplate walking away from heroism when Mary Jane gets engaged to Jameson's astronaut son.

 Alvin Sargent's screenplay understands what issues withstand the opening weekend box office; the movie takes its time to explore Peter's connection to friends, family, and the citizens he protects. Spider-Man is among the people, not above them. He tires. He gets snippy. An excellent ""dying with pride"" spech from Harris argues for duty against dream. It's a two-hour comic book, yet firmly rooted in working-class ideals. The subtextual arguments against the media and irresponsible science reject elitism - notice how villainous attacks in both movies are against everyday commuters. Notice that Jonah pits both sides against each other for what he believes to be maximum effect while the masses embrace Spider-Man. Notice in a small scene at Mary Jane's theater how petty, circular art rules conspire to keep Peter from the Oscar Wilde play. Raimi and Sargent are quiet about it, but the movie underlines classic themes, and it does so without gore or violence of nihilism run amok. For bright, receptive teens, ""Spider-Man 2"" carries an excellent message.

 Which doesn't mean the movie's perfect. Again the villain is thrown into the background, and while Doc Ock is more imposing than The Green Goblin, it doesn't make him any more memorable. Alfred Molina is serviceable but not wicked - his ""evil"" humor is droll and detached, his menace casual. Though Franco is a decent young actor, Harry Osborn is a poorly-written, ill-motivated villain-in-waiting, and ""Spider-Man 3"" looks less promising according to the hints dropped at the end of this movie.

 The central love story of Peter and Mary Jane, however, is strong enough to withstand hammy, average foes - expect two for the next ""Spider-Man."" This movie's final shot suggests there is more emotional terrain to cover despite Mary Jane's revelations; whether Raimi and Sargent remain a team for the future pictures, the critical groundwork is in place. ""Spider-Man"" and his girl will be with us for some time.",1090540800,3,4055,5.1057401812688825

In my opinion, the issue is not that this movie is better than the first one, but the fact that Spider-Man 2 is SOOOO GREAT because of the first Spider-Man movie... Am I making sense? Honestly, when I saw the first one, I thought it was GREAT, and was not expecting a sequel. But after seeing the second one, I realize how the original Spider-Man is made even greater by the second one, and viceversa... I really hope I'm making some sense.

Don't get me wrong.  I really liked the movie and recommend it strongly.  But the first was just as good or better.  They do end with a great lead-in for the next.  And yes, I can't wait.",1090454400,2,528,4.262626262626263

1504346,4,B00005JMQW,"Spiderman 2 is a worthy sequel that keeps pace with the original without destroying the franchise by contradicting established history the way the Batman series unfortunately did.  The performances are first-rate throughout. Tobey Maguire oozes with conflict and angst without ever being over the top. There are some bad moments with musical montages and poor grammar, but for the most part the film successfully walks the line between comic book camp and blockbuster thriller without doing disservice to either genre.",1090454400,2,518,5.475
1504347,5,B00005JMQW,"I know you are out there. You, like me, found yourself discontented upon seeing the original SPIDER-MAN two summers ago. We attended the first film with great enthusiasm. We grew up reading the comics, and looked forward to seeing a great adventure not unlike those we read about in our younger years. Nevertheless, we left the theater disenchanted. We cringed upon Spidey's utterances of ""Shazam!"", and the villain looked like he?d purchased his costume at Wal-Mart.

 It is now two years later, and SPIDER-MAN 2 is playing at the local Cineplex. For those of you who are, as I was, reluctant to view this film for fear of more discontent, allow me, without spoiling things, to put your mind at ease. SPIDER-MAN 2 proves to be everything the first film was not.

 In the previous film, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) was a wonderful blend of adolescent angst and heroism. His flaws enriched his character, and served to advance the plot. However, the moment he donned the red and blue suit, all his depth of character went out the window. Parker as Parker was wonderful. Parker as Spider-Man fell flat and maligned.

 The Peter Parker of part 2 is still very much the same. He is insecure and frequently unsure of himself as he endeavors to do the right thing. He's late for work, late for class, and even late for his birthday. The Spider-Man of part 2, refreshingly, carries the same qualities. The embarrassing part of life has found its way into the superhero's web. He begins to doubt his calling, and even trips up a bit in his skills. Like most of us, he falls on his face a few times as he struggles to sort things out.

 Whereas before the villain served to annoy us, the villain of the sequel is much more complex. Many of you may recognize him as Indiana Jones' traitorous assistant in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK He is Alfred Molina, and this villain finally has a goal other than world domination. He seeks to right the wrong that sent him into villainy in the first place. He?s a decent man, and like Parker, struggles to do the right thing, albeit through villainous means. Put another way, he possesses many of our less than admirable qualities, which makes him someone we can relate to.

 The writing this time around has hit its mark as well. In the previous film, the inane wise cracks and goofy gags seemed to ask for a laugh where there was none. This time around, the goofiness has a charm all its own. It even keeps the plot moving without becoming boring. When you see the film, listen for the classic song, ""Rain Drops Keep Fallin' on My Head,"" and you'll see what I mean.

 The screenplay is the movie's real joy. Parker's character arc is delightfully bereft of nonsensical musings and desire. His course to make his dreams come true is as real as ours is. Harry Osborne's character is also much improved over the first film, as he demonstrates the slow decay that hate inevitably brings.

 I expected this film two years ago, and I have finally received my wish. Granted, this is a comic book movie, and not to be taken seriously. But for those of us who enjoy butter on our popcorn as opposed to cheese, this movie delivers where its predecessor had not. Even the cheese tastes better this time around.",1090368000,8,3226,4.578125
1504348,5,B00005JMQW,"This is a excellent film. I felt that Sam Raimi kept the flavor of the spiderman comic which was one of my two favorites as a child (the other being the Fantastic Four).

If you were looking for lots of action you may be in for a disappointment.  The action is there and very brutal but it is primarily a love story a a redemption story with a superhero thrown in.

Alfred Molina was a excellent choice for the part of Dr Octopus and the effects of his tentacles were kinda creepy and nasty.

The visuals were much smoother in my opinion than the first one, particularly Spidey swinging along the buildings.

 What about the rest of us?

 If you haven't seen the first film, go rent it before seeing this one, it's really a true ""part 2"" and while it has enough adventure to be entertaining without knowing all the little details from the beginning of the story, it just won't play as well standing alone.

 I'm no huge comic book fan, and I had to keep reminding myself during the film that ""this is a comic book"" and not meant to be a realistic story. However, that being said, I was a bit disappointed that the story, in places, stretched my credibility. Yes, I know that sounds crazy, going to see a film about a guy that turns into a spider and I'm complaining about having my credibility stretched. But listen, if I'm going to accept a premise, say that it's possible that some guy could turn into a ?spider-man?, at least I want the story to stay in the borders its created and not push it even further.

 The acting was good, the love story well done enough for the genre and all in all I was entertained and enjoyed the movie, however, I'm still sticking with the same assessment that I gave the first movie, it's just an average adventure story with great special effects.",1090281600,3,1264,4.281512605042017

1504399,5,B00005JMQW,"After the blockbusting success of SPIDER-MAN 2, it was pretty obvious that director Sam Raimi and company would eventually revisit the world of the nerdy photographer Peter Parker and his arachnid alter-ego. The resulting film is not only spectacular, but tops the original in almost every way.  Picking up two years from the events of the original film, Parker finds himself struggling to balance both his personal and super-hero lives without much success.  He loses his pizza delivery job despite using his web-swinging powers for some super fast transit.  He?s unable to prevent his beloved Aunt May from losing the family home.  And perhaps most heart-breaking of all, he alienates himself from everyone, especially the girl he loves, by seemingly never being anywhere on time.  (The fact that he?s late due to the need for his super heroic services doesn?t help matters.)  When his powers start to fade on him, our hero makes the decision to give up being Spider-Man.  Unfortunately, the best laid plans of man and spider go awry as a new super-villain named Doc Ock threatens New York with possible nuclear destruction.

Just as before, Sam Raimi directs the whole thing with a keen and sure hand.  In fact, he seems to display more confidence as he effortlessly blends the film?s small and personable moments with the top notch CGI action scenes. Indeed, the entire cast seems more assured.  Tobey Maguire again proves that he was born to play the title role with his doe-eyed Peter Parker tugging at our heartstrings, even as we cheer his super heroics.  Kirsten Dunst matches him as Mary Jane, the girl he secretly loves.  J.K. Simmons again hams it up delightfully as J. Jonah Jameson, Peter?s bombastic newspaper boss.  Rosemary Harris gets a bit more to do as the always caring Aunt May.  However, it is the villainy of Alfred Molina?s Doc Ock that pushes this film up a notch.  Portrayed as a basically decent, if somewhat egotistical, scientist, Molina engages both our sympathies and our fears as his character is taken over by the mechanical tentacles that he wears.  It definitely is an improvement on the bombastic Green Goblin of the first film.  (In all fairness, Willem Dafoe, who reprises the role in a cameo, was handicapped by a costume that seemed to belong on a Power Rangers episode.)

All in all, SPIDER-MAN 2 grabs your attention from the very first frame to the last.  It?s character and heart matches the large scale action to make a superhero film that is rarely seen these days.  It?s a perfect follow-up to the first film and a movie that gets one of my highest recommendations.",1090281600,9,2613,4.855530474040632
1504400,5,B00005JMQW,"As a rule, superhero movies are a rather lackluster genre.  The emphasis is almost always on a bankable star, flashy special effects, and elaborate confrontations with super villains.  SPIDERMAN 2 lacks none of these things, but luckily it has a great deal more going for it.  More than anything else, SPIDERMAN 2 has a great story.  Somewhere along the line, the other superhero movies lost track of the story; this superb film brings that back.

I do not think that it is any exaggeration to say that this is the finest superhero movie ever made, and the primary reason for that is the super screenplay.  Film mastermind Sam Raimi obviously recognized that while special effects and stars are great enhancements to a film, at root you have to have a story worth the telling.  He therefore recruited Pulitzer Prize winning novelist Michael Chabon (whose novel THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER AND CLAY proved that he possessed an absolute mastery over comic book type stories) to provide the basic story around which the screenplay was written.  I found the first film to be mildly interesting, but the vast improvement in the second film over the first is overwhelmingly because of the greatly improved storyline.

Without giving away any major plot details, the situation is this:  in most superhero movies, despite whatever attempts are made at depicting the situation of the central character as tragic, we actually envy them.  What male wouldn't love to be Superman?  Who wouldn't want super strength, the ability to fly, or invulnerability?  Batman may lack these, but Bruce Wayne is a multi-billionaire with whom most of us would trade places in a second.  And while Bruce broods a lot, it is very difficult to feel that he truly has a rotten life.  The brilliance of SPIDERMAN 2 lies in the fact that an hour into the movie, it is impossible to imagine anyone wanting to trade places with Peter Parker.  Yeah, he is a superhero, but his life really and truly sucks, and in super fashion.  He has a horrible job, is struggling in school, discoveries that his aunt is being evicted from her house, lives in an absolutely wretched apartment (with a dreadful landlord, magnificently played by Russian comic Elya Baskin), and is feeling very, very lonely.  But worst of all, MJ, the love of his life, has not only gotten engaged in the face of Peter's reluctance to get involved with her, but is furious at Peter for his ongoing unreliability.  As he feels himself losing her presence in his life, he actually begins losing his powers.  And all this takes place as he has to face a new and dangerous enemy in Doc Ock, a brilliant scientist whose body and mind has been taken over by intelligent high-tech tentacles (played marvelously by superb character actor Alfred Molina).

Luckily, the film excels not only in setting up the situation, but does an excellent job of resolving the central concepts in the storyline.  Peter recovers his passion for MJ and thereby his superpowers (the precise instance that he once again has his powers is the moment when MJ in a coffee shop asks him to kiss her), recovers his sense of purpose, and in the end is rescued from some of his loneliness.

After SPIDERMAN, I was not especially looking forward to SPIDERMAN 2, but after this one, and especially after learning that Raimi has asked Michael Chabon to write another story, I am eagerly awaiting the next one.  Early rumor is that James Franco as Harry Osborn will resurrect his father?s Green Hornet, and that the Black Cat (perhaps played by Eliza Dushku, who is reportedly favored for the role by Raimi) will make an appearance.",1090281600,6,3630,4.808373590982287
1504401,5,B00005JMQW,"MOVIE: Once the opening credits begin so does a brilliant montage of the first movie done in the style of a comic book. Basically they used the opening credits as a backdrop to put in a prologue. What makes this superhero movie stand out from those before it is that it has an enormous amount of character development. What makes this different from Batman, Superman, and the upcoming Catwoman is that it's not all about the action. Sure the movie has outstanding CGI's and a train fight that rivals the trailer truck fight in Matrix Reloaded, but there is so much emotion put out through the characters. With Batman all the movie is about is kicking ass. The reason why Spider-Man is such a successful movie is that Tobey Maguire has created such a character in Peter Parker that it allows the audience to really relate to him. We aren't superheros but sometimes it feels like we need to be in order to accomplish some things in life. Also Peter Parker is a genuine character, a ""same as you and me"" type of guy. Batman's parents were murdered, Daredevil's father was murdered, but Spider-Man really has no dark past except for the murder of his Uncle. Okay maybe murders in the family do drive people to become superheros but Spider-Man is not some guy dressed in black trying to silence the pain of his past, he's just your friendly neigberhood kind of guy. What the movie lacks is some new stuff. If you think about it, it's just a deeper version of the first one. Basically the same of Parker dealing with his conflicting lives. One other thing that bothered me was all the science mumbo jumbo the filled the movie with. I kind of laughed at how Octavius described how he met his wife when she was studying English Literature and he was studying Science. Please! Overall though a new best for the genre. It's a croud pleaser with a little more depth that just an action fare.

 ACTING: You have to give it to the cast because without the cast they've got they would be nowhere. Alfred Molina steals the show as Dr. Octavius, his menacing Doc Ock just worked out so well. Tobey is Spider-Man, in and out, and Kirsten Dunst plays the lovely MJ Watson. Great casts make great movies.

 BOTTOM LINE: Some parts of the movie could have been changed for the better, but overall this was one great superhero movie. I really think the new Batman will be a flop because Spider-Man has not only raised the bar, Spider-Man removed the bar and has become the bar.",1090281600,,2456,4.537246049661399
1504402,5,B00005JMQW,"Sam Raimi has by far exceeded himself with this breathtaking sequel, making it almost hard to believe that he was the wonder behind the entertaining yet stupefied ?Evil Dead?. Spiderman 2 makes all the other of today?s comic-strip film phenomena?s (Hulk, X-men etc) look poignant.  I mean tell me what careless buffoon would release ?Thunderbirds? at the same time? Of course unless their every intention was to make Spidey look inconceivable suprafragilistically the ultimate blockbuster of summer 2004?or maybe ever!!

The sequel certainly leans to a more humorous script than the original, but I am not afraid to say it works, it works, it works. I cannot stand the cheesy song ?Raindrops keep falling on my head? and I hate its connotations with ?Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. So why on earth did I feel fantastically happy and warm inside when Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is walking to college in his geeky outfit to the same song I now find charmingly invigorating?  I guess sometimes a film can kill a song and a different film can rejuvenate it! ? oh the circle of life!

Spiderman still finds it hard to convince his fellow citizens that he is a good guy and not the menace the Daily Bugle portrays (no thanks to the feeble editor fantastically played by J.K. Simmons).  Peter in turn has stopped handing in snapshots of Spiderman to the newspaper because Spiderman refuses due to a damaging reputation, which means Peter?s photography looks to be on the verge of failure. Luckily he is fired then unfired to help out at an engagement bash. Along with the struggles of Spiderman and photography, poor Peter has to balance a part-time pizza-delivery job with his college studies. Not to mention his perplexed undeniable love for MJ (Kirsten Dunst).  Peter rendering into organised schizophrenia on the outside is suffering on the inner, and so it is not surprising that Spiderman is losing his powers. As the doctor puts it ? ?Maybe Spiderman isn?t supposed to climb those walls.?

The bad guy? Okay, some crazy scientist called Dr Octavius (played by our very own Alfred Molina) trying to create nuclear fusion in the palm of his hand. Obviously as usual ?his success in failure becomes his failure to admit defeat?, which in my opinion gives the character someone we can all share empathy. Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) depicts beautifully ?sometimes we have to be steady, and give up the thing we want the most. Even our dreams.? Rather than Spiderman using his special powers to save the world he remembers the powerful words of Aunt May to make Dr Octavius see sense.

Mr Maguire and Miss Dunst are both undeniably terrific in the film, Stan Lee and of course Steve Ditko (lets not get in a legal feud) could not have wished for better actors to play their beloved caricatures. In a very childish way I share the love for them so much as well.  In fact, I am already having withdrawal symptoms from my absence watching Spiderman and my viewing was only half-an-hour ago! Hurry up Spiderman 3!!

P.S.  Not that I complained much in the original Spiderman ? but I swear the special effects are much better this time! Spiderman does looks more realistic ? those who disagree ? please buy yourself an imagination!",1090281600,3,3226,4.805054151624549
1504403,3,B00005JMQW,"Tobey McGuire returns in this special effects loaded sequel however, I unlike some fans was disappointed with this sequel.
Toby McGuire once again stars as Peter Parker/Spiderman, now confronting a new enemy Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina).
The special effects were awesome, no doubt about that, however unlike the first one, the second half is pure nonsense and I was left unsatisfied.
Alfred Molina as Dr. Octopus is tremendous, just like Willem Dafoe's characters as ""Green Goblin"" we see his rise to power.
(Spoilers) Yet Raimi's dumb writers in the second half of the film have him playing as a patsy.
Spiderman clashes with Dr. Octopus several times and actually the fights are fair, however Dr. Octopus eventually gets Mary Jane (Dunst, who really doesn't do much as far as acting) and uses that to his advantage while creating a new weapon.
Tobey as Spiderman again like the first film is not a strong presence, yet I know some nerds are trying to hype him up to be like Christopher Reeve but please give me a break. He will never have the same charisma as him.
Alfred Molina is great as Dr. Octopus, but the story seems to go nowhere and we get the same crap from the same movie, like Parker, still being the nerd recluse who is unable to go after what he wants, though this is hilarious in retrospect, but then becomes tiring.
The special effects and action are what saves ""Spiderman2"" from being a disappointment as far acting and plot go, and that wasn't a surprise was it.
Still though I was left wanting more, and the cheap ending and the way Dr. Octopus out of the thin blue sky has a change of hear for not killing ""Spiderman"" was pathetic though, that wouldn't have happened really, still I know there will be many nerds seeing the movie 10 times and saying it was the greatest movie ever, but they aint kidding anybody.
""Spiderman 2"" is what it is a great special effects bonanza with some great action scenes, but not great character development and predictable plot lines.",1090195200,,1988,4.666666666666667
1504404,4,B00005JMQW,"The first Spider-Man movie was a careful, appropriate, and sincere retelling of the Spider-Man mythology. In essence, the mythology of Spider-Man carried the movie, not the movie itself. In contrast, Tim Burton's Batman was extremely...Burtonesque. It's a tribute to Raimi's directorial skill that he was able to put his ego aside and get the heck out of the way of a great story.
Spider-Man 2, on the other hand, has Raimi written all over it. Spider-Man 2 isn't just Raimi's magnum opus--it's bigger, better, more stylized, and ultimately, a different kind of movie altogether.
In Spider-Man 2, we pick up two years later and yet, things are still pretty much the same. Peter's (Tobey Maquire) living week-to-week on jobs he can't keep due to his nighttime superhero antics. His grades suffer. He never gets a date. Peter is a big loser...smart, but unlucky in just about everything.
Conversely, things are going swimmingly well for Mary-Jane (Kirsten Dunst). She's marrying J. Jonah Jameson's (J.K. Simmons) son (Danielle Gillies, who eventually becomes Man-Wolf after finding a weird space rock on the moon). She models for billboards. She gets great acting gigs.
In the background, Harry Osborn (James Franco), is now the CEO of Oscorp after his father died in a battle with Spider-Man. Harry is gambling on a dangerous perpetual fusion project, led by the inimitable Doctor Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina).
Comic book fans know the drill: Otto creates mechanical tentacles, attached at his waist, to act as his hands when performing experiments of extreme heat and radiation. That's why Dr. Octavius stands behind a reinforced wall and inserts his tentacles in a fashion similar to modern scientists manipulating dangerous chemicals today.
Oh wait. No that was the comic. In the movie, against all reason, Otto uses the tentacles without any protective gear whatsoever. Since Otto's conducting an open room demonstration with the people funding the project in a warehouse, mere feet away from a pulsating globe of energy, one must wonder if the tentacles have any use at all.
In the comic, Doctor Octopus had six tentacles. Here has only four, but they're plenty. It also becomes immediately evident why Alfred Molina had to play the part - wearing tentacles and not looking like an idiot requires a BIG man, and Molina is huge. Unlike the comic, where the tentacles bond with Doc Ock as a result of the explosion, giving him ""telepathic control over them,"" these tentacles are artificially intelligent. Each tentacle snaps and hisses like a snake, with a glaring red eye in its palm. And oh yeah, the tentacles work based off of Doc Ock's neuro-transmissions, so the suit that controls the tentacles digs directly into his spinal column.
My wife turned to me at this point and said, ""Why didn't they just sell the tentacles to make a profit?"" She's right - in the rush to get on with the rest of the plot, the weirdly plausible tentacles didn't need much explaining. And since when are scientists both mechanical engineers AND brilliant physicists?
The word ""tentacles"" should have perked up the ears of Raimi fans. Raimi is fond of tentacles, as evidenced by the Evil Dead movies (which in turn, was taken from Chinese Ghost Story). Doc Ock's tentacles attack with a mind of their own, flailing surgeons in a surrealistic scene that could only be described as Raimi's brand of horror. There's even a surgeon who grabs a medical chainsaw and tries to cut one of the tentacles. It doesn't save him.
I won't dwell on the unnecessary Mrs. Octavius (Rosalie) or some of the other minor quibbles about the Doc Ock character. However, once Doc Ock's rushed origin is over, all is forgiven. His tentacles have a personality of their own and they undulate and twist in the background as Doc Ock gestures. He has the round glasses, the trench coat, and all the moves that make Doc Ock Doc Ock. Visually, anyway, Raimi got it right. Certainly, he still makes more sense than the painfully strained justifications created for the Green Goblin (a surfboard AND a green suit AND little bombs that happen to look like pumpkins? What an amazing coincidence!).
The rest of the movie is Peter navigating the wrecked shambles of his life (and peripherally, that of his Aunt May). Spider-Man 2 stays firmly focused on the dizzying highs and piteous lows of a kid trying to make it on his own, including family squabbles, failed romance, and strained friendships. We are led to believe that Peter begins to lose his powers because he no longer believes in himself. Can't climb? Sure. Can't shoot webbing? Okay. Is physically weaker? Gimme a break. Spider-Man's muscles didn't deflate, so there's no reason for Parker to limp after a fall...except to make an in-joke about Tobey Maquire's back problem.
The first movie had a lot of CGI effects that just weren't up to par. Yes, Spider-Man needs to move like a superhero, but often times he looked like some kind of weird robot with extra joints, flipping around in ways that didn't feel like it could be a man in a suit. In Spider-Man 2, Raimi is cognizant of the limitations of CGI. We never see Spider-Man up close when the special effects are required, just like every director's been doing for years with good old fashioned make-up and animatronics.
Despite the change in pace, the fight scenes are filled with amazing feats of agility. Spider-Man's not just acrobatic, he THINKS fast and the contortions he resorts to display that magnificent superhuman speed. He has to move fast too, because Doc Ock's got six limbs to Spider-Man's four.
Props to Raimi for making a movie that doesn't flinch in dealing with its subject. Heck, the ending puts a stake in the ground that puts to rest the ""who will be the next villain?"" game. Barring some plot flaws that can be chalked up to a comic book style, Spider-Man 2 is a real treat.",1090195200,,5865,4.871871871871872
1504405,4,B00005JMQW,"The answer is yes, and SPIDERMAN 2 proves this theory true.  In fact, a sequel can not only stand up to its predecessor, but be more entertaining, fun, and suspenseful than the first.  Yes, it's true: SPIDERMAN 2 totally beats the first Spiderman movie.
I haven't read the comic books.  Is the movie up to par with its origins?  This I don't know.  But I do think I know a good film.  SPIDERMAN 2 is well worth seeing.  Why?  I can easily surpass the 10-reason mark.
(1.) Tobey Maguire puts his heart into his Peter Parker performance.  He is more emotional and really ""becomes"" his character, so to speak.
(2.) Kirsten Dunst is beautiful and ethereal as Mary Jane Watson.  It is two years since she and Peter graduated from high school and she has pursued her dreams of acting, taking on the lead in THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST.
(3.) The movie's villain is more frightening.  A renowned scientist experiments and the experiment not only backfires, but causes a plethora of drama, violence, and chaos as a machine he created to cheapen the expense of electricity instead hooks onto his body and gains control.  I was actually a bit scared, folks, and I'm 16!  DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT, take your little ones to see this.  Or cover their eyes when you sense the scary moments are approaching.  When I was in the theater, the little children were crying and screaming for their mummies and daddies.  Even if you think SPIDERMAN 1 didn't warrant its PG-13, this one is different.  Trust me.
(4.) It is far more suspenseful.  For one thing, Peter trashes his Spidey suit when he senses his powers waning.  We wonder if he will retrieve the suit and once again be on the run and on the watch to save the earth.  We also wonder if Mary Jane will forgive him for missing her play.  And will she marry her fiance???
(5.) A romance blossoms.  I won't say between who but I'm sure you can take a wild guess.  It looks like this romance shall last as well.  Will there be a sequel?  Yes.  SPIDERMAN 3 is in the works.
(6.) Amazing cinematography.  Filmed in New York, one of the U. S. of A.'s best cities, it captures the essence of NYC: the grunge, the glamour, the pizza parlors, the traffic holdups, the prestigious university at which Peter Parker attends.  The name is never mentioned, but I suspect it to be either NYU or Columbia.
(7.) Even more amazing special effects.  Spidey flys, soars, jumps, and shoots out web like aeresol confetti.  The results of pooled efforts and computer technology is an amazing sight.
(8.) Peter Parker's best friend is hot.  Oh...and a good actor.
(9.) ""VINDICATED"" was written expressly for SPIDERMAN 2 by Dashboard Confessional.  It plays during the closing credits.  It's a great song with excellent lyrics.  All the music from the movie is great, actually.  I'm ever-so tempted to purchase the soundtrack.
(10.) The dialogue is better - much more well-written.  The whole script is just great.
(11.) Spiderman saves more lives: a little girl in a burning building, his own aunt, a TRAINLOAD full of New Yorkers, Mary Jane (of course)...
(12.) The flashback of Peter and his deceased uncle was enough to make me cry.
(13.) It has something for everyone: suspense, drama, romance, tearjerkers, a smidgen of horror (can't get over the villain), and so much more.  All around, it's a very well done effort.
(14.) Did I mention that it's longer?  I do think it is.  Or perhaps it just feels that way.

1504406,5,B00005JMQW,"The excellent Tobey Maguire returns as Spiderman/Peter Parker. Two years on Peter is now in college and delivering pizza to earn extra cash. He's still saving the people of New York as his alter ego Spiderman but this causes him problems like delivering his pizzas on time and attending the play of his best friend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).
The new villain in this film is in the form of Dr Octavius/Dr Octopus, a brilliant scientist whose body has been overtaken by a machine of four giant mechanical arms he has created. Dr Octopus has also perfected a method called fusion to create unlimited energy but this method could destroy half of New York if he succeeds.
Meanwhile, Peter has inner struggles. He wants to lead a normal life and have a relationship with Mary Jane but then again he can't leave the city to the evil hands of Dr Octopus. Finally his better judgment overcomes him and he cannot give up his good deeds as Spiderman.
This sequel is on a par with the original, if not even better. The Special effect are astounding and the fight sequences between Spiderman and Dr Octopus are almost unbelievably realistic. This film is not only an action packed one but it is also very human as we see the inner struggles of Peter Parker played brilliantly by Tobey Maguire. It's also comedy and there are many scenes which will make you laugh. Definitely highly recommended.

I liked the fact that the villian redeemed himself in the end.  I think we need more movies like this, with the right things to fight for, instead of just beating people up, for revenge or other reasons.",1090108800,,405,4.233766233766234
1504477,5,B00005JMQW,"Spider-Man 2 was amazing in so many ways- actors, costumes, action sequences, music, props, sets, etc.  This sequel is one of the few that I can truthfully say is either equal to or better than the first.
The actors are incredible- Tobey Maguire plays a very believable Peter Parker/Spider-Man- he is a young man who is trying to do the right thing, but is torn between the people and things he loves, and doing what is right and just.  He is also kind of a dork, but in the nice sense- it would have been easy for Sam Raimi to turn Peter Parker into a geek who overnight becomes this indestructible superhero perfect guy, but he doesn't- he keeps him human; Peter's character is believable, because he is both a superhero and a struggling person.
I also found it very moving when Peter was struggling to do the right thing- aren't we all?  He knows his life is falling apart- his jobs, college, and the people he loves- Aunt May, Harry and MJ, all because he is willing to help as many people as he can- people he doesn't even know.  We see a scene that is in stark contrast to the superhero that is Spider-Man- (IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE, DON'T READ) Peter sees two guys beating up on a guy for his money, and Peter sees this- but astonishingly, turns around and walks away.  I have been to see Spider-Man 2 twice, in different theatres, and in both of them, when Peter walked away, I could hear small gasps and murmurs from the audience.  This scene was poignant to me for two reasons: we have already seen that Peter has made up his mind, but we also see the internal struggle- it takes him a while to make his decision to leave- and know that Peter is not sure if he made the right decision.  Secondly, I pictured Peter in the Spidey costume doing the same thing- walking away.  That was a difficult thing for me to picture- Spider-Man waking away from someone who needed help.
The music in this movie was great, and the music for each scene was well-composed and selected.  The special effects were absolutely brilliant!  I'm glad I can still say that the scenes where we see Spider-Man swinging through NYC are still realistic.
The theme behind Spider-Man 2 was an extension of the theme from the first- ""With great power comes great responsibility.""  Peter has been given these awesome powers, but now faces a dilemma- he has to be willing to give up so much- his lifelong dream of telling Mary Jane how much he loves her, his friendship with Harry Osborn, not to mention his college studies and jobs to pay the rent.  So, he decides to give up being Spider-Man, and is happy for a while, but we soon see that he needs to be Spider-Man again.  Like it or not, he has a responsibility to the people of New York City, and the people of NYC have a need for a hero, and we see this in several moving ways.
The rhetoric of Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin in the first movie is trumped by the wise words of Aunt May- the people need a hero- a true hero; a hero that is a hero 24/7, not just when the going's easy- but when its the hardest, and when is faced with the choice of taking the easy, comfortable, and happy way out or the hard, difficult and painful road, chooses the hard road, certainly not because it is easy, but because it is the right thing to do, not caring how hard it is.
This movie speaks to all of us- we each have talents, and we should use those talents for good (for the good of all mankind, as Dr. Octavius spoke of intelligence), and choose to do what is right, even if is hard to do.
This movie is the perfect combination of what I think is a must-see hit: good morals- choosing to do good over the comforts of life, great actors, believable characters, moving music, awesome special effects, good jokes, incredibly cool costumes and a great storyline.  If you haven't seen it, go see it now while it's still in theaters, and if you've already seen it, take friends or family to see it- either way, see it again!  (And if you think that this movie stinks, then I feel incredibly sorry for you, cause you're really missing out)  I like what the Amazon review said- and though it ends on an ominous note, I'll end on a positive one- this sets the bar incredibly high for Spider-Man 3- but I believe the Spider-Man team is up to the challenge, and I look forward to seeing Spider-Man 2 again, and Spider-Man 3 in the future.

1504478,5,B00005JMQW,"Aftter seeing the first installment of the Spider-Man series, I was left speechless.  When the second one was released, I rushed to theaters three times in the first week to see it.  For everyone who loved the first one, this movie will make your mind go crazy.  All of the twists and turns in this movie lead up to one final scene that will leave you satisfied for weeks.  If you miss this movie, you are a disappointment to the Spider-Man series.  Not only was this movie satisfying and incredible, it was so inspiring.  The first movie is incomplete without this sequel.  This is by far my favorite movie ever!! Alfred Molina is amazing as Doc Ock, James Franco is great, Rosemary Harris, but as expected, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst steal the show!",1090108800,,756,4.597014925373134
1504479,5,B00005JMQW,"OK, in so few words, I'll tell you all.  Me= HUGE spidey fan.  Big time.  Ok, now that that's out of the way, let's get down to business.
I liked this movie better than the first one.  There I said it.  Yes, its a bit campier, a bit more...comic-bookey I guess you could say, but hear me out.
I've read some reviews saying that this movie was more about Peter Parker than it was about Spider-man.  All I have to say is...umm...duh?  This movie was all about Peter making peace with his inner demons about how and why he does what he does, and how it affects the life that he wants to have.  Don't forget, Peter is a young man (to quote the movie, ""He's just a kid""), and he is experiencing all the trials and tribulations of finding his place in the world.  The first movie was about him choosing how to use his powers, and this movie was about the consequences of that decision for Peter.  Now the next movie is a different story, but anybody who knows ANYTHING about the comics will know from seeing the second movie what is going to happen in the third, who the villain will be, etc.
PS to this, whoever still thinks it will be Venom/Carnage...give.me.a. BREAK!  Did you SEE the ending to this movie?  Two words(POSSIBLE SPOILER HERE): Green Bowtie.  Dear God.
Anyway, the non-story stuff.  Acting was top-notch once again.  Tobey proves once again that he was the right choice for this role, both psychologically and physically.  If anything, he looks like he fills out the costume a little better this time around.  Kirsten did quite well, better than the first I felt, but that was probably because she had more to work with here.  Alfred Molino did a great job as Octavius, the man consumed by his devotion to science.  And James Franco (that's Harry O. in case you didn't know) looks to be doing well, and I look forward to seeing him in the next movie.
Special effects and battle scenes were much improved in this movie.  Part of that was the fact that even in the comics battles between Spidey and Ock are highly kinetic and fast, and that was shown marvelously in this movie.  I really felt that this movie embodied the essence of Spidey's fighting style more than the first movie did.
Also, for those of us who know where Sam Raimi started as a director, there are some little moments or scenes in this movie where you can see that he was having a little fun.  Namely the operating room scene after Octavius has the tentacles fused onto him.  Has anybody other than me seen Evil Dead?  Anybody?  No?  Well darn, you're missing out.
The only thing that bothered me about this movie was a directorial thing also though.  And that is Spidey's hero carriage in the train.  The visual just...bothered me.  I thought it was entirely unnecessarily Gladiator or some such movie.  I liked the signifigance, but I didn't like that visual image.
Anyway, that's my one beef with the movie.  Despite that bother, I will gladly name Spider-man 2 the best super-hero movie I've ever seen.  Followed by Batman and X2 and the first Spider-man (in no particular order).",1090108800,4,3063,4.522768670309654
1504480,4,B00005JMQW,"It's no secret that I absolutely hated the first film. But Spiderman 2 has truckloads more excitement, pathos and humor. Almost every area where the first film lagged in improved upon.
Though I'm still not keen on Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker (not tall enough, too much of a geek) he was better in the role this time around. Though I'm not sure why he's still a total nerd. This is not how Peter Parker is portrayed in the comic books and it's weird that in the movie he comes across more like Clark Kent.
The CGI effects are miles better too. Some shots still looked a little iffy, but rest was so seamless I never noticed. Granted, it would be hard to get any worse than effects in the original but I was genuinely surprised at how good they were. A lot more time and care as been put into arranging them than before.
Alfred Molina as Doc Ock was a hundred what Willem Dafoe's campy, power-ranger Green Goblin was. You could tell that underneath he really was a good guy who was just too carried away with his work. He really did have a menacing presence in any scene featuring him with his extra arms (surely more resembling a spider Peter Parker). The earthquakes signalling his approach are very cool.
The sequel has a more structured feel to it and has more inventive set-pieces. The first one felt like an empty showcase for effects but here they were integral to the story.
I'm not keen on Kirsten Dunst though (she looks far too much like my ex). In the comics she is an outrageously proportioned and glamorous woman. I just don't see that in Kirsten Dunst. However, she really did get into the character and I believed in her relationship with Peter this time as before it felt like rejected sub-Dawson's Creek trash.
Spiderman 2 is also made in widescreen, which is cool as I was disappointed at Sam Raimi's inexplicablely shooting the original 'flat'. A movie of this scale deserves scope and size and this time we get what we should have got before.
Considering how the movie has already earned $40 kabillion in 3 weeks you hardly need me to tell you to go out and see it. But for once the box office receipts are validated by a good movie.

But when his powers suddenly fad he decides to give up being Spider-Man for good, however as Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molan) who has made a robot suit with monstrous tentacles somehow gets involved in a accident that makes the suit attached to him with his mind telepathically controlling it to become Dr. Octopus. Life seems good for Peter ever since he's giving up being Spider-Man and that his powers were gone, as now there's more crime especially involving Dr. Octopus whom has a plan on elimating the city! can Peter Parker's powers return or will the city be doomed?

This is a rare sequel that can be better then the original like say ""Terminator 2"", ""Aliens"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Godfather II"", ""Superman 2"" or ""Empire Strikes Back""! Sam Raimi and company knew what they were accomplishing when they made this fantastic sequel to the instant classic ""Spider-Man"" but with more emotion, more action, better special effects and some comical moments. J.K. Simmons along with Bruce Campbell, Rosemary Harris and James Franco return as well, the performances are nothing but terrific and it's even more true to the comic book then the original movie.

The emotional storyline of how Peter's life style affects Spider Man, it's point wasn't too clear to me, It looked like mary-jane was Spider mans power not his choices in life. The scenes of emotional distress lasted too long for my liking. Poor. The action scenes were excellent.

Now that the back story was out of the way, Sam Raimi could just take the franchise where it was supposed to go. This movie was like watching a comic book unfold, especially the fight scene with Doc Ock and Spidey when MJ is kidnapped. The acting improved and the characters seemed natural, and the cast fit their roles perfectly.

1504565,4,B00005JMQW,"One of the things that endeared me to the first Spider-Man film (and the first Matrix film) was its provision that it was a cheesey, comic book movie and not afraid to embrace that. I've always believed that super-hero movies/action-adventure movies shouldn't take themselves so seriously, because when they do it usually blows (Reloaded). Well, whereas the Matrix movies got all wrapped up in themselves, the second installment of Spider-Man is still as ready as ever to let that cornball dialogue fly. And that's not a bad thing. There's a real charm to this movie, like its predecessor, that elevates it to a much higher level than the mindless summer flicks with which it plays.
  And yes, it is better than the first film. ""Leaps and bounds"" better, as some critics are saying? No. But it's far more complex, more exciting, and more playful than the original. And while I'm on the subject of complexity, I have to mention maybe one of the greatest superhero villain creations of all time: 2's Doctor Octavius (Alfred Molina). Molina, and the writing and concept behind his character, is really the strength of the film. I was endlessly fascinated by how layered he is: he starts out as a completely aimable man, gets wrapped up in the notion of scientific discovery, becomes a slave to his work, then gives himself over to it, and pursues Spider-Man...not because he's bad, but to advance his scientific cause. Doc Ock makes other movie villains, naturally and illogically evil, look like cardboard cut-outs.
  And the plot that grounds the film in realism is intriguing, too. Writer Alvin Sargent's script explores the psychological complexities of being a superhero: sure, Maguire's Peter Parker is a superhero, but why can't he choose to be a normal 20something instead? Is his 'higher calling' so much that he should sacrifice his whole life as well? These questions aren't answered in some ridiculous way, but simply worked out through the smooth, churning gears of the movie's narrative that never slows down too much and picks up to a giddily exciting pitch during the action scenes (that subway fight!). Yes, all the stuff with Mary Jane and Aunt May is shamelessly cheesey, but it's never off-putting. In fact, a scene in which Parker and M.J. walk and talk down a night-time New York street is as well-executed and honest as similar scenes in any recent drama.
  Neither Spider-Man movie has been a great film; the fact that this is based on a comic book will always add a level of subliminal silliness that will never be 'overcome.' But why, really? Spider-Man 2 sets out to do something, accomplishes it well, and met my expectations. Even within the constraints of a comic book, though, it reaches depth that few movies of its kind bother to tackle and really makes us care about the characters, and not in a superficial way (James Franco's Harry Osborn is a great example of that - he's set up to be a villain, but do we blame him really?). And it's fun. I'm sick of movies trying and failing to inspire real terror when dark comedy should be the objective - a sublime scene in an operating room had me rolling in my seat and, agree with me or not, I think that was director Sam Raimi's intention.
  Should Spider-Man 2 have had the ending it did? Not really. The first two fades-to-black would have made much more compelling conclusions to the film; in fact, I would have been ready to applaud the movie had it ended where you think it might the first time. But why gripe about a final scene that, though syrupy as hell, made me happy in spite of it all? Of course, that's a feeling that stayed with me every minute of the movie, too.

The time on the train was understandable because spiderman could not see, but the rest of the times were just stupid choices for people to know spidermans identity.  Also, why did spiderman keep on losing his powers.  Shouldn't he still have his powers even if he didn't want to be spiderman.

Some flaws include Mary Jane Watson, Doc Ock, and well Peter losing his powers.
Why is M.J. Watson in this movie? What use does she have, except for a reason to make Peter lose his powers? She is worthless in this storyline, she is annoying too. The love story doesn't make sense, Peter talks with M.J. for about 2 minutes and then she ""loves him"" and cries when he leaves her (I know it happens in the first movie, but still, it's stupid, the love story is obviously faked.)
Doc Ock was in this movie for about 10 minutes, and about 8 of those minutes he was a good guy or he was talking with Harry. The train/bank fight was cool, but way too short. The last ""battle"" was pathetic, he spends days or whatever trying to make this energy whatever and then Peter tells Doc Ock what Otto taught Peter and Doc Ock changes (somehow), blah blah blah, boring.
Why did Peter lose his powers? Because he didn't want them? That's stupid. Boring, I want to see a SPIDER MAN movie, not a movie about a nerdy Peter Parker and worthless M.J. cry and complain that Peter isn't always there for her. No one cares, next please.

1504589,5,B00005JMQW,"Spider-Man 2 is a clever, fun, and suspenseful movie. It's a good sequel, with a good anatomy and interesting and unique characters. Peter Parker is juggling a job, a dying relationship with the beautiful and popular MJ, his guilt at his uncle's death, and, of course, how could I forget, his superhero secret identity, Spider-Man! His old friend, Harry, who is surpassing his father's dreams for OsCorp, is angry at Spider-Man for the death of his father, Norman Osborn, and will do just about anything to see him dead. When Dr. Otto Octavius develops a power source, he is financially backed by OsCorp and Harry. He is admired by scientific genius Peter Parker, who attends the demonstration for the power source. But something goes wrong, and not only does Otto Octavius, or Doc Ock, [Dr. Octopus] develop four practically invincible and mechanical arms, but he is consumed by them and becomes literally insane, trying to rebuild the power source, putting the town and all the inhabitants in it in danger.
Meanwhile, Spidey has thrown in the towel. He decides that there is so much he's missing as Spider-Man. But he may be wrong, and he may have just made the worst decision of his life. MJ is engaged to a famous astronaut, and Harry is financially broke, and descending into alcoholism. [The alcoholism is nothing major, nothing that needs to be a reason for not seeing this movie. But every time you see Harry, he is drinking a beer and his chin in wet and his words are slurred.]
Violence is mostly kept between Doc Ock and Spidey, [spoiler warning] but there is one instance where a drunken Harry slaps Peter twice. There is no sexuality, just some passionate kissing, and virtually no language. It is the sort of dramatic action/adventure-romance movie that can be geared to kids, teens, and adults, and they will all find it thrilling, fun, romantic, and cool. For such a popular PG-13 rated movie, parents will be relieved it is so 'clean'.
Tobey Maguire is cute, strong, and does a wonderful job, as does the beautiful and expressive Kirsten Dunst and Alfred Molina, whom I am sure had the time of his life. The movie had good sound, an excellent soundtrack, and an experienced cast and crew. It matches the first and is the perfect sequel. It captures the cartoon effect while still being realistic. The movie is pretty easy to follow, though at parts scientific things don't make sense, but hey, I don't do science. The movie is just a little formulaic, but still a brilliant piece!

After last years disasters(including HULK, DAREDEVIL, AND THE GOOD BUT NOT GREAT X2) We needed a movie that would give super heroe movies a good name. And Sam Raimi is our chosen one. Spiderman 2 is mainly based upon the troubled life of Peter Parker. Those who have seen the original Spiderman(My favorite super hero movie) know that as it was in the comic books Peter Parker is bitten by a super spider and gets super powers. Even though the ending of the original seemed to be a happily ever after...well. Now Peter Parker's life is a struggle. He's just lost his pizza delivery job on account that he was saving 2 kid's lives and he was late to deliever a dang PIZZA????????? He lives in a crummy apartment and he's broke. His Aunt May is being taken from her home becuase she's also broke, Harry Osbourne his best friend is still trying to kill his alter ego whom Harry thinks murdered his father, and he is flunking college. But worst of all, He can't even confess his love to Mary Jane Watson because he is afraid of what his enemies will do if they find out that he is Spiderman so she's marrying another dude. The pressure is so much that he decides to stop being a hero and live a normal life. He has a chance to improve  his whole life, but bad timing. After an experiment gone wrong, Otto Octavius, one of Peter's hero is transformed in to a man with four mechanical arms. Otto's wife dies during the experiment and as in the comics, he turns in to a villain. Peter is forced back in to the game when Octavius kidnaps M.J and demands Spiderman. He comes back for one final battle with Octavius and realizes that Spiderman is his life and he could not live with himself if he just let offenders go unpunished. Great action scenes.

1504592,5,B00005JMQW,"There are very few times when the sequel out does the original.  Usually the sequel can't live up because it just isn't the original.  This is not true in Spider Man 2's case.  Spider Man 2 FAR surpasses the first Spider Man movie and is quite possibly the best Superhero film ever made!
The movie begins with Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) showing up late to work.  He delivers pizzas but when he shows up late he only has seven minutes to deliever them.  Not an easy task for Peter Parker but for Spider Man, no problem!  He delievers the pizzas but he delivers them late and therefore losses his job.  It's quite easy to see what the film is trying to tell you right off the bat! It's hard being a Super Hero and living your own life.
Throughout the first half of the movie you see what being Spider-Man really does to Parker.  His grades are slipping, he can hardly pay the rent where he's staying and he misses a play that Mary Jane is performing in, one of which he promised to be to... but as the film goes to show, it isn't easy being a hero.
Doc Ock in this film is something else.  He's portrayed brilliantly and as the film goes to show, his coming about is merely an accident.  Dr. Octavious is merely trying to harness fusion energy, the power of the sun in the palm of his hand, but when the experiment goes awry the mechanical arms, controlled by AI are able to take over his mind.  Now he plans to redo the experiment knowing full well that he could decimate the entire city.
The characters are developed very nicely.  Harry Osboourne seeking revenge on Spider-Man and agreeing to help Doc Ock get him.  Mary Jane deciding that she can't be with Peter because Peter can't be there for her and Aunt May who is suffering greatly from Uncle Ben's death and has financial problems of her own.
But among all the characters, Peter Parker is perhaps the most well developed.  Aside from seeing how he goes about being Spider-Man the film shows how he has to go through a great deal with his struggles among friends.
By far Spider Man 2 is the most breathtaking Super Hero film ever crafted. This isn't like Batman where we see him take on a new villian with little connection to the first one.  In fact, this film makes sure you remember the first one as it takes off from where the first one left off.  As the film opens up it shows clips from the first film to remind you of what happened.
It's a grand film that no one should miss.  Truly a great accomplishment in Cinema.  See it and love it, Spider Man 2 is a movie that takes off and never comes back down!",1089590400,4,2569,4.3056133056133055
1504593,5,B00005JMQW,"Spider Man 2 breaks all the rules of comic book hero movies. Like the other comic book movies like Batman Return's, Superman 2, the list goes on and on, this movie has emotion, the characters feel like real people with real problems. The characters are not a cookie-cutter image. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is trying to balance work and school. In the beginning of the film, he is fired from the pizza place. Now, he is late for school and his grades are failing while he is trying to save the world. Peter then mets up with Mary Jane (Kristen Dunst) who is now a big model and her face is everywhere all over Manhatten. Mary Jane is in a play, and Peter is invited, but he ran into a problem so he is late, and he cannot get in because of the doorman. Mary Jane feels like she has been pushed aside, Peter tries to explain to her that he is busy, but then he finds out that she is getting married. Peter is crushed by this move. While trying to make some extra money, he then takes pictures of Spider-man for the Daily Bugle. The editor bashes Spider-Man for being the bad guy. Now while doing a paper on Octo, a scientist that makes cheap energy through a certain nuclear atom, the ball is small, but fuels enough energy as powerful as the sun. He then creates these robotic arms so that the people working with the atom would not get hurt. Then something goes wrong, whille showing everyone, the ball overloads and Peter stops it but it is too late. The arm's now control Octo, then he robs banks, and he is hired by a man who claims that Spider-Man killed his father. His father was played by William Dafoe who played the Green Goblin in the first Spider-Man movie. As Dr. Octpus captures Spider-Man while he is trying to save a subway train from going to the end of the line. So now as he saves the people, Dr. Octopus grabs Spider-Man and brings him to his place. He then finds out who Spider-Man is, and is shocked. Peter Parker is going through some other problems's, his string fails to work sometimes and decides that he does not want to be Spider-Man no more. So he tries to live a normal life, but things keep on coming up and eventually Dr. Octopus kidnappes Mary Jane while trying to get the nuclear atom to finish his life's work. Eventually, it ends happily, and a shock at the ending I am not going to spoil. Good movie, and one of the best comic book movies around.",1089590400,,2385,4.325892857142857
1504594,5,B00005JMQW,"I have to say that I thought the first Spideman was okay, and I am still surprised at how popular it was. So when I heard about the sequel, I didn't plan on going out of my way to see it. I was never into comic books, and am not really a fan of Superhero stories to begin with. Well, with all the hype and merchandising going on Spiderman 2 caught the attention of my son. He wanted to go so badly, I just couldn't say no. I have to say that I was extremely surprised at how good this movie is. The blend of action, humor and drama is fantastic! The special effects are amazing, and Doctor Octopus should go down as one of Hollywood's greatest villains! Even if you aren't a fan of Superhero movies, there is just too much to enjoy with this film to pass it over. The acting is top-notch and the high flying action will keep you glued to the edge of your seat! I can't say enough about Tobey Maguire. His portrayal of Peter Parker is great. You completely buy him as an average kid who gets caught up in extraordinary circumstances. You actually feel sympathy for this kid who has maybe taken too big a bite of something to swallow, all while rooting for him to start slinging some web. I also recommend seeing Spideman 2 in the theaters, because alot will be lost when it moves to the small screen. If you have been hesitant going to the theater because of the usual hype surrounding ""summer blockbusters"" which usually fall flat, don't be. Spiderman 2 actually lives up to or surpasses the hype. I will surely be in line when part 3 opens.",1089590400,85,1541,4.280821917808219
1504595,5,B00005JMQW,"I knew it was going to be good, but I had no idea it was going to be THIS good. ""Spider-Man 2"" is everything a sequel of it's caliber should add up too: better special effects, breath-taking action sequences and a deeper story-line. ""Spider-Man 2"" succeeds at respecting and building off of the story established in the first movie. Two years later, and Peter Parker is struggling to keep his head above water. His obligations to his alter-ego, Spider-Man, keep him from holding a steady job, making ends meet, keeping in touch with family and friends, and most importantly: being with the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson. As Peter starts to doubt himself, his abilities start waning away, and he finds himself conflicted and forced to make the choice of saving the world, or living a happy life. To make matters worse, a new super-villian is on a the loose by the name of Dr. Octopus, a respected scientist controlled by his own invention. The stakes in this movie are raised really high and the result is a more powerful and gripping film than the first one. So, yes, ""Spider-Man 2"" is better than the original, which is quite an accomplishment considering the standards it set. Sam Raimi's vision and passion for the material oozes through with each scene. Raimi is easily the most underrated director of the moment. Each scene is played to perfection, and all of the actors have grown into their characters a bit more, especially Rosemary Harris (Aunt May) and James Franco (Harry), both of whom give much more dimension to seemingly peripherral characters. Tobey Maguire shines through in this one, with an improved performance (looking and acting less and less like Keanu Reeves kid-brother) and Kirsten Dunst is fantastic as always. Considering this is a monstrous Hollywood block-buster of the grandest sorts and will no doubt break records throughout the summer, ""Spider-Man 2"" is intelligent and fun at the same time. Everyone who has interest in it will walk away happy, fully satisfied -- and most importantly -- salivating for what the inevitable ""Spider-Man 3"" will bring us.",1089590400,4,2092,4.895774647887324
1504665,5,B00005JMQW,"I had the opportunity to see Spiderman 2 (for free). All I can say is ""WOW!!!""
I loved the first movie. Despite Mary Jane's ""bottled"" red hair, the organic webbing and the really lousy Green Goblin costume, the movie was wonderful and deserved all that it took in at the box office. So, what's so good about the sequel?
The plot was amazing. In it, you could see all sorts of little nods to various issues of the comic book. When Peter is seen walking away from the costume that he has just thrown in the trash can, I could distincly remember the cover of the ""Amazing Spiderman"" comic where he gave up the duds.
The special effects in the first movie were, in my opinion, better than most people gave them credit for. But I'll admit that some of them looked unreal. That isn't a problem in this movie. The effects are so real, you won't even notice them. At times, they'll have close-ups of Spidey swinging through the city that look absolutely breathtaking. My favorite is when he swings between the cab and trailer of the rig while chasing a car with some thugs in it..
I noted that the producers seemed to ""compromise"" between Mary Jane's hair and that of Kirsten Dunst. The result is a Mary Jane with slightly ""strawberry blonde"" hair. I never even missed the comic character's hair color.
Doctor Octopus has always been one of my favorite Spiderman villains. I was looking forward to seeing what they would do with him. I wasn't disappointed. He was a true, well-rounded character. Seeing the battle between the wills of Octavius and the tentacles was good, even if the character was a bit different from the ""Doc Ock"" in the comics. This ""split-personality"" seemed to work so much better than the one between the Goblin and Norman Osborn.
On a side note, my daughter, her ""Spiderman and Friends"" teether held tightly in her hands, sat quietly on my wife's lap throughout the movie. If it can keep a six month-old busy, then you know that it had to be good.",1089590400,,1963,4.548022598870056

1504667,5,B00005JMQW,"For those of us old enough to recall the comic strip's beginnings and various later incarnations, ""Spiderman 2"" is the perfect tribute to Stan Lee's creation.  Straying little from its origins, the movie vividly brings to life one of the most unique characters to ever come out of comicdom.  Like its predecessor, this film skillfully balances the superhero antics of Spiderman with his struggle to be the very human Peter Parker, making for an engaging story of a man's struggle with his dual nature.
Much of the credit does go to the director Sam Raimi, screenwriter Alvin Sargent, the special effects technicians, and composer Danny Elfman.
However, the actors chosen to represent the various inhabitants of this MARVELous world seem to jump straight from the mag's pages.  Besides Maguire's brilliantly understated performance as the title character and Kirsten Dunst as love interest ""Mary Jane"", there's Rosemary Harris's truly believable ""Aunt May"", J.K. Simmons' flawless ""J. Jonah Jameson"", James Franco exorcising his own ""demons"" as ""Harry Osborn"", and Bill Nunn as Spidey supporter ""Robbie Robinson"".
Alfred Molina has a ""field day"" as the film's villain, ""Dr. Ock"", a role that he must've relished every scene in which he appeared.
To ""borrow"" from those other reviewers, I give this one TWO THUMBS and TEN TOES UP!",1089590400,,1328,5.196261682242991
1504668,5,B00005JMQW,"In SpiderMan 2, director Sam Raimi fulfils his promises to Spidey fans, drawing out the themes of sacrifice, choice and destiny even more lucidly than in its prequel. Tobey Maguire reprises his role as the web-slinging vigilante who wages with his identity and the life he wishes to lead. A crippled romance with sweetheart MJ Watson (Kristen Dunst), falling grades and late rents forces him to review his options. Peter Parker ends up as a disappointment to himself, MJ, his aunt May (Rosalind Harris) and even to his best pal Harry (James Franco) who is disillusioned by his personal vendetta with Spiderman. The brilliance of the sequel is further elevated by the tight casting of Alfred Molina as the tragic villain Dr. Octopus who turned mad after a lab accident destroyed his life's work. The action remains galvanizing esepcially in the cliff-hanging train chase sequence and the paranomic swings and pans across the city. SpiderMan 2 returns in its comic pulp fantasy glory and is even more focused in its portrayal of the superhero with his frailities and dilemma and reconciling with the fact that with great power comes great responsibility. Director Sam Raimi, with his unwavering passion, has beautifully spun a maginificent tribute to the beloved superhero crafted by Marvel whiz Stan Lee and Steve Ditko in this moving spectacle.",1089590400,3,1344,5.085972850678733
1504669,4,B00005JMQW,"With a more character driven plot and bigger tools at their disposal, director Sam Raimi and his crew have gone above and beyond the first Spider-Man film; crafting what some have hailed as the best comic adaptation of all time.  While I don't think Spider-Man 2 deserves that tagline (that honor goes to X2: X-Men United), the film sure is something special as more depth is given to Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire, ever perfect) as he struggles between being a super hero and his love for Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) as a new foe emerges.  The entire cast excels here like never before, with Alfred Molina perfect as the tragic Doctor Octopus (who is a shockingly better villain than Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin) and James Franco's Harry Osborn slowly descending into madness and vengeance as the stage is set for a third film.  The only real problem with Spider-Man 2 is that at times it can get too dramatic for it's own good, but the movie manages to keep steaming along as we see Spidey get pushed to his limits like never before.  It's definitely worth seeing, and even jaded web-heads will admire the film.",1089504000,16,1109,4.671794871794872
1504670,5,B00005JMQW,"Just have to add a word of praise for the filmmakers and actors. I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
This was a SPECTACULAR film both artistically and technically. Spider Man has always been a favorite character that has been well handled in both films but definitely better in the second movie.  All the actors were great and quite well casted.

A special note to Alfred Molina - if ever a comic book movie could win an Oscar for a performance this is it! What intensity and purpose! I usually watch so called frightening films with casual ease but something about the pace, presentation and the intensity of Alfred's portrayal of Dr. Ock is just plain scary! Great Job! He has got my Oscar vote.
It is interesting to note that both Dr. Ock and Peter Parker (both men of science) are dealing with the same kind of life crises (loss of loved ones, radical physical changes and new powers, seeking their purpose in life, etc)
Just one little issue that came to me about the plot. It would seem reasonable that Dr. Ock's robot arms could dish it out with Spider Man but the man himself was just plain human. It some scenes superhuman Spidey makes some really good punches connect. At Spider strength these blows should have killed an ordinary human. Dr. Ock is a genius with mechanical super strength and speed which makes him dangerous but still a basic man behind the arms.  He should have to be careful to avoid direct contact with Spidey. Just a little detail, but an important note for Dr. Ock's eventual return. He is just too good a villain.
Finally, it is great that both movies seem to show that the real hero of the show is indeed Peter Parker - the man who sacrifices so much for others. Even more interesting is the fact that when it all comes down only Peter can reach out to the person of the villain to finally save the day. It is also good to see those sacrifices being touchingly respected and reciprocate when both Peter and Spider Man are completely vulnerable as in the train scene and at the end of the show with Mary Jane's actions. Makes you just want to cheer.
Overall, a great movie.  Already has a place in my DVD collection!",1089504000,,2148,4.5
1504671,5,B00005JMQW,"Wow, what an amazing film! Sam Raimi has really outdone himself with Spider-man 2. Like any true artist, he has improved upon his craft with time and experience and it really shines through in the movie. Every element that could feasibly be improved upon from the last outing has. I.e. character development, plot, action, etc. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and Alfred Molina give spot-on performances and really help to enhance the emotional aspect of the story. The action sequences occur much more freqeuenly, are more elaborate and quite frankly, beautiful to look at. And for the die-hard fans, the film continues to remain faithful to the comics in the continual unraveling of Peter Parker's life. But what I enjoyed most about this comic-to-film adaptation is that underneath the flashy action scenes and the over-the-top super-hero/arch villian rivalry is that at its core, the film retains a beating heart and a moral foundation that has all but disentigrated when it comes to how most other super-heroes and their motives are conveyed. Bottom line: Spider-man 2 an eclectic blend of action, comedy, romance, and morality that is completely worthy of your time and money.",1089504000,3,1180,5.151041666666667
1504672,5,B00005JMQW,"Spider-Man 2(2004). The Second Movie In the Spider-Man Movies.
After the magnificent Spider-Man, which became the 5th Highest
Grossing Movie of All-Time(Recently Knocked to #6 by Shrek 2 though), a sequel was undoubtedly coming soon, and in June of 2004, Spider-Man 2 finally arrived in theaters. Critics were in a frenzy, giving Spider-Man 2 5 Stars left and right, and it was praised as ""being better than the first"" by almost everybody, and the hype was high upon its release. Much Like Spider-Man, when Spider-Man 2 hit theaters, it hit theaters with a
vengeance, and in the first 6 days, it grossed over 180 Million
Dollars, beating the Matrix Reloaded's Weeklong Record of 150 Million. So, with all the hype and expectations surrounding Spider-Man 2, how does the movie stand up to it in the end? If you ask me, with Flying Colors. Read on to find out why...
Plot- Peter Parker. Better known to the population as Spider-Man, a hero or a menace, depending on who you ask. Peter is challenged daily by his responsibilities, having to choose between Saving The Day or Surviving everyday life, his schedule seriously skewered with his Jobs, School, and Personal life because of his responsibility to defend the citizens of New York. Mary Jane, the love of Parker's life, abandons him after he fails to come to any of her shows, Peter loses his Job, He's
Failing in School, and his Best Friend Harry Osbourne disowns him because of his ties with the ""Bug"", because Harry believes Spider-Man cold-bloodedly killed his father, Norman Osbourne(AKA The Green Goblin). Meanwhile, Otto Octavius, a promising scientist on the brink of a major Fusion Discovery, becomes the City's Menace, accidentaly molding 4 Metal Arms onto his body in a freak accident, and they control him. He then wreaks havoc, robbing banks, hurting, and killing people, and Spider-Man is the only one who can stop him. Meanwhile, Peter Parker decides to abandon his life as Spider-Man, meaning to focus on his personal life instead, yet he begins to change his mind after the growing problems, especially after Mary Jane is kidnapped by Doc Ock(Otto Octavius). Spider-Man and Doc Ock's showdown could mean the fate of 8 Million people, including Mary Jane, so he faces off in a battle of the Ages.
Opinions-
First off, the first thing you notice about the story is how it picks right up where it left off, so if you didn't see the first Spider-Man, you might be in the dust, so go rent it if you're planning to see Spider-Man 2. S-M 2 isn't just a continuation of the original, it's a whole new story, showcasing Peter Parker's personal problems, and how his Personal Life and Responsibility clash. The love story here is not as obvious as in Spider-Man, yet in the end, Parker must risk his life for Mary Jane, and their love brings them together in the end. I found that the Special Effects were very well-done, with Doc Ock's metal arms, The Clocktower fight, The Train Sequence, and the Final Climatic Fight showcasing the Special Effects beautifully! Everybody's acting is top-notch, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and especially Sam Raimi's performance really standing out, and I expect them to be doing excellent things in the future. As for Spider Man 2 being better than the first, I must disagree. Why you ask? Mainly because I think the whole plotline of Peter Parker discovering his new powers and the responsibility that comes with it, and the resulting consequences to be a very intricate plot that edges out Spider Man 2 slightly. Nonetheless, Spider Man 2, a tale of Love, Hate, Friendship, and Betrayal, stands as a Cinematic Milestone, An Action Plot with a Great Story and Acting, and in the end, a moral we can all live by, With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility, and we can never waver from out duty.
Overall, Spider-Man 2 is the perfect movie for the Summer, and the masses of people seeing it show why. I can't wait for the Third, which was even broke open in Spider-Man 2(Harry Osbourne discovers his father's Green Goblin stuff after learning his Best Friend is his Father's Killer). The one thing I ask though is to make Venom, perhaps the greatest villian ever, an integral character in some of the next few movies. Till Next Time, Adeiu!

1504673,5,B00005JMQW,"I enjoyed the first Spider-man movie a lot... I tend to like comic book movies (though I have never read a comic book in my life - yet) and it was definitely one of the better ones I've seen.  Spider-man 2 picks up a year or so after the first one left off - he's in love with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), but can't be with her as he fears his enemies will hurt her to get at him.  His best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), is suffering and mourning the loss of his father - who he knows died at the hands of Spider-man (his father was the ""Green Goblin"" and the bad guy in the first Spider-man movie).  He is also suffering in school and at work because he spends so much time saving the city, he can't get to class on time.  His Aunt Mae is still mourning the loss of her husband, Peter's Uncle Ben.
During the first part of the movie, one of Peter's scientist heroes, Dr. Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina), is working on a fusion experiment with Harry Osborn's corporation that he hopes will change the world.  At the demonstration, however, things of course go horribly wrong and Octavious ends up with four mechanical arms stuck to him and the chip that ""controls"" their artificial intelligence breaks - so they have a mind of their own and begin to control him.  ""Doc Ock"" begins trying to rebuild his fusion machine (which could destroy half of New York City) and Spider-man sets out to stop him.
Spider-man 2 spent a lot more time on character development than you normally see in a comic book/action movie.  You really feel Peter's pain as he struggles to balance being a super hero with being a regular guy.  You really feel for him, wanting so badly to be with Mary Jane, but knowing if he acts on his desires, he is knowingly putting her in harm's way.  Poor Aunt Mae is struggling still with the loss of her beloved husband and dealing with the financial aftermath his death has caused for her.  The characters and conflicts are so believable, despite the inate silliness that comes from being a comic book movie.
The acting is superb as well, all the lead actors are phenomical and perfectly cast.  One of the greatest characters is J.J. Jameson (J.K. Simmons) who is Peter's boss at the Daily Bugle.  He absolutely nails the character and is hilarious throughout the movie.  Another thing the movie did really well was be funny, despite all the angst and conflict going on.  The ""elevator scene"" in particular was hysterical, as well as the scene with Peter at the laundromat.  I won't go in to detail so I don't ruin it, but suffice to say - they were funny scenes!
Action scenes were once again spectacular - with amazing CGI that was a lot less obvious this time around.  My one complaint would be there was a little TOO much time spent on character development and not enough action.  The action scenes were just phenominal - I really wanted to see more!  There was also quite a lot of subtle foreshadowing, indicating a Spider-man 3.  Many future villians were introduced that most people wouldn't recognize unless they were fans of the comic.  Fortunately I had plenty of comic book loving friends with me.  Some hints - MJ's astronaut fiance, Peter's professor and Harry Osborn - all future bad guys in the comic books. ;)",1089504000,15,3243,4.509401709401709
1504674,5,B00005JMQW,"I just got back from seeing ""Spider-Man 2"". I have to say that it definitely blows away the first film although the first film was wonderful. In the first film, we see how Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man. In the sequel, Peter Parker is struggling to balance his life as a college student, a freelancing photographer, a pizza delivery guy, a nephew, and a friend all at the same time. It is a constant, neverending battle for Peter Parker. Eventually Peter succumbs to his doubts as a superhero and whether the sacrifice is worth it. That in itself was well written out and the writers did an excellent job at fleshing out the true essence of the comic book Peter Parker and bringing him out in actor Tobey McGuire however director Sam Raimi gets full credit for keeping faithful to who the characters are from the comic book pages to the big screen. Alfred Molina as Dr. Octopus was the best casting job. Alfred's portrayal as the brilliant physicist turned psychopath was one of the best performances I have seen from Alfred. The most chilling scene from Molina in the film was when Dr. Octopus woke up in the hospital. That entire scene in general was rather intense and brutal to say the very least. Tobey McGuire and Kirsten Dunst were wonderful as their perspective characters but I have to say Alfred Molina was the highlight of the blockbuster smash for me. I also loved the brief cameos made by QAF's Hal Sparks, Bruce Campbell, and Sam's younger brother Ted Raimi (who played Joxer on ""Xena: Warrior Princess""). The special effects were amazing although there were moments that just screamed ""I am the cheese"" because I could easily tell that they were computer generated. It is rare to see a comic book turned into a movie that is so well written. Sam Raimi stayed true to the essence of the ""Spider-Man"" series.",1089417600,15,1822,4.679127725856698
1504723,1,B00005JMQW,"If you are not versed at all with Spiderman, DO NOT see this movie.  I was told by a lot of people I work with that this was much better than the first, were they wrong!!!  The movie leaves a lot of unanswered questions.  The plot is a joke.  Emotions in this movie are very easily changed and are not beliveable.  Tobey Maguire does the best he can with the silly plot.  I myself have never read a Spiderman comic book in my life but a friend of mine I went with had.  She was equally dissapointed with it.  I know that when most people go to see a movie, they understand that there is a lot that his going to be fiction. This movie really, REALLY stretches that concept.  Example.  You want Spiderman dead so bad that you are willing to let an evil scientist have something that could cause the deaths of millions of people just to get the chance to kill Spiderman. Only when you have the opportunity, it only takes 30 seconds to change that idea.  This is just one of the many scenes that takes place in this movie that really don't make sense.  Also, I don't know about you but if I were in a bank, I would notice a man with 8 limbs, 4 of which are metal, come in!
Harry Potter was released a month ago.  I thought that movie was 100 times better.  It has a plot, a hero and a well thought out script.  Spiderman 2 seems to struggle to get a very predictable plot climax at the end as well as having a hard time bringing a lot of ideas to a head.  Like a lot of people in the theater with me, confusion was on the brain.  Save your money, see Harry instead. Harry Potter that is!",1089417600,6,1583,4.0711974110032365

Along with Mr. Tobey Maguire, another great actor, and good news he's signed on for seven films?  I hope so.  Another credit goes to Mr. Sam Raimi who made the ""Spider-Man"" franchise possible.  I remember hearing he had a Spider-Man poster in his bedroom since he was ten.  Obsessed with Spider-Man.  Miss Kirsten Dunst does a spectacular job of playing Mary Jane Watson in this movie.  You know before the 2002 movie came out, I knew that there was a superhero named Spider-Man and that's all I knew.  I saw it and was in awe, it was a terrific film.  Willem Dafoe and Cliff Robertson have cameoes, reprising their roles as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin and Uncle Ben Parker.  I love this film, best film of 2004, along with ""Troy"".  I'd recommend, better than the original, but see the original first, anyway.",1089417600,,975,4.572254335260116

1504726,4,B00005JMQW,"While the first installment of the ""Spider-Man"" franchise was certainly a noble beginning, this sequel somehow manages to improve upon it in a big way.  The first movie accomplished the task of getting Spider Man's origins out of the way and setting up the important characters, and ""Spider-Man 2"" picks up right where the original left off, hitting the ground running as it further examines the struggles of Peter Parker.  As you may remember, Peter can't tell the woman he loves who he is, his best friend wants to kill him and doesn't even know it, and he's having a bit of trouble finding steady work.  While that may not seem like an auspicious beginning, things still proceed to go downhill pretty fast.
Much like its predecessor, ""Spider Man 2"" presents Peter Parker as the most human of superheroes, struggling to reconcile the responsibility that accompanies his powers with his desire for a normal life.  This guy didn't ask to have superhuman powers, and as we see in this movie, there are times that he'd much rather not be one.  After all, when you like a woman who looks like Kirsten Dunst, and you have lots of evidence that the feeling is mutual, it can be hard to get out there and perform the thankless task of fighting crime.  In all seriousness, though, the moral conflict that Spidey faces forms the heart of the movie.  With a level of emotional depth and a lack of heavy-handedness rarely seen in big-budget blockbusters, this movie brilliantly depicts the tension our protagonist feels as he tries to decide whether he wants to be Peter Parker, mild-mannered student, or Spider-Man, daring superhero.
Since it ups the ante from the original in virtually every other aspect, it only makes sense that ""Spider-Man 2"" would represent an improvement in the bad guy department, and it doesn't disappoint.  While the villain is once again a brilliant scientist victimized by an experiment gone horribly wrong, Willem Dafoe's cartoonish Green Goblin has been replaced by the fearsomely tentacled Dr. Octopus, portrayed with the requisite gravity by a glowering Alfred Molina.  The Spider-Man series has demonstrated a knack for crafting nemeses as vividly human as its hero, and as with the Green Goblin, we get to see the conflicts played out in Dr. Octopus's head as he decides to complete his fusion experiment no matter the cost.  Perhaps more importatntly, Dr. Octupus's tentacles are a marvel of modern special effects, swinging wildly and with a mind of their own, smashing through concrete, effortlessly tossing whatever they can grab, and dispatching a room full of doctors in one harrowing early scene.
This brings me to perhaps the most attractive aspect of this movie: it actually features believable, fleshed-out characters.  The ""X-Men"" franchise has done an admirable job in this regard as well, but the ""Spider-Man"" movies still take the prize thanks to unusually intelligent dialogue and acting that communicates the movie's key themes while keeping the melodrama to a minimum.  Maguire's everyman appeal as Peter is undeniable; Dunst's smart, sensible Mary Jane is one of the only female leads around who actually bring something to the table besides good looks; and James Franco is turning the tortured soul Harry Osborn into a tragic hero of near-Shakespearean proportions.
Anyway, with Dr. Octopus predictably set on a mad quest to finish his project, and Peter the only guy who can stop him, the stage is set for some truly unbelievable combat scenes, surely among the best to be seen in a mainstream movie in recent years.  While I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and character development and all that nice stuff, you can't have a superhero movie without some great action sequences, and this one has plenty of them.  Whether in a bank with bags of money flying around, on the side of a skyscraper with Peter's Aunt May serving as a human shield, or on a speeding train filled with innocent passengers, the two duke it out in frenetic, fast-paced battles that pit webs against tentacles and any other potential weapon that presents itself.  Sam Raimi's apparently one of the only directors in Hollywood these days who can film a tight, tense fight scene without overrelying on CGI effects or cutting every half-second, and we should all be grateful for it.
As if all that isn't enough, we're once again treated to the over-the-top antics of J.K. Simmons, who threatens to steal the show even in his limited screen time as the imperious Jonah Jameson.  Mugging furiously, yelling up a storm, and terrorizing those who come near him, Jameson's character is every bit as scary as his flattop haircut and Hitler mustache would suggest.  Someone could make a movie about this guy, and I might put down some cash to see it.  While many big-budget movies try to inject some comic relief into the proceedings, this one is notable in that it actually does it well.
Everything comes to a head in the movie's epic climax, with a concluding half-hour full of revelations, emotional drama, and of course lots of action.  In fact, the bittersweet nature of this movie and its conclusion practically position it as the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the Spider-Man series.  Given the massive receipts this movie has already brought in, it's inevitable that there will be a ""Spider-Man 3"" coming down the chute eventually, especially with the neat bit of foreshadowing at the end of this installment.  If the next sequel is as smartly written and skillfully filmed as this one was, it can't come soon enough.",1089417600,24,5522,4.928879310344827

I recommend this Movie whole-Heartedly to everyone that still believes in Heros. The Movie never slowed for me. I've read some other reviews stating the Movie maybe to long and could have been shortened but I say how when Raimi was and is creating a Character that we all can identify with and believe in and Love for years.

1504729,5,B00005JMQW,"Spidey is back, and with a vengeance!  Ever since I saw the first teaser for this film, I was eager to find out how our favorite web slinging hero would fare in this sequel.  Sequels are notoriously lesser films than their predessors but Spiderman 2 proves the exception!
This story starts two years after the last, with poor Peter Parker trying to balance his life as a struggling college student/employee while trying to fight evil in the greater New York area.  The stress of his overwhelming burden is getting to him and the girl he loves, Mary Jane Watson (again played by the lovely and talented, Kirsten Dunst) has decided to move on and find a man that will be present in her life.
Add to the mix a brilliant scientist that Parker admires, named Otto Octavius who, after an experiment goes wrong, becomes the villain for the sequel and Spiderman has his hands full!  Alfred Molina is excellent as a man who has good intentions that is turned wicked by the technology that he is developing.  He becomes a maniac with four mechanical tenacles, which along with his own four limbs, inspires the moniker, Doctor Octopus.
What makes this a great superhero film is that besides the great special effects and action sequences, there is a good story that is character driven.  Tobey Maquire is completely charming and improves a great deal in this role.  Alfred Molina, Kirsten Dunst, Rosemary Harris and the other co-stars give compelling performances making this summer blockbuster a must see for fans of all ages.  The story neatly sets up the next sequel and the romance, which is one of the best parts of this film, was just another component of a movie that offers something for any movie lover.
Spiderman 2 definitely raises the bar for all superhero films.  That is why people are going to see it in record numbers.  I plan to see it again, hopefully on IMAX the next time.  If you haven't seen it yet, you should make a trip to the cinema.  This is one summer blockbuster that delivers on all levels!  You are GUARANTEED to enjoy this movie---don't miss it on the big screen!!!",1089331200,3,2086,4.651226158038147
1504730,5,B00005JMQW,I thought the first Spider-Man movie was a thrill. This one was 100x better!!! I really thought the trailers would have spoiled the whole movie because they showed way too much but there are scenes they don't show that just blow you away! Dr. Octopus has always been my favorite Spidey villain and he's perfect here! Tobey Maguire really comes to life as Peter Parker in this film. I love the facial expressions he has when things aren't going well for Peter. The story leaves room for at least two more movies and the hints at upcoming villains are enough to ensure that the Spidey series will only get better and better!,1089331200,7,622,4.5625
1504731,4,B00005JMQW,"Let me explain the ""bad ending"" part. (Without spoling things.) Spider-Man fights Doc Ock three times in the movie. First, they fought in the bank which leads to fighting on the clock. Second, they fought on the train. (Which is one of the best action sequences EVER!) Lastly, there was a fight scene at the end of the movie...WHICH LASTED ALL OF 5 SECONDS! Instead of having a kick-butt final battle sequence...they use up all of the action throughout the film & probably 4 punches are thrown at the end. I was expecting more from the ending. Other than that, the movie was flawless, gripping, & awsome. I can't wait 'til Spider-Man 3. (And hopefully IT will have a better ending.)",1089331200,,682,4.644628099173554
1504798,3,B00005JMQW,"First off let me tell you that I Love Spider-Man and everything about the comics, cartoon etc. I absolutly loved the first movie but the second one was lacking alot on my opinion. Critics are hailing it to be wonderful but the critics hail the most awful movies. Now the actor who played Dr. Octupus seemed to work perfectly but I'm sick of them having something control Spideys enemy like the tentacles controlling Dr. Octupus. They did the same thing with the Green Goblin and his alter-ego and I thought that was stupid and I thought they would realize that was dumb and change the alter-ego idea for their second film. At the end of the movie I ended up liking the character Dr. Octupus and was sad he died, thats not how the protagonist is supposed to be. He should have been killed in the end by a viscious long battle with Spider-man noy by saving Spider-man. Now people say they should have more villains in the movies but they don't really need to add more villains they just need to make the villain scary and hated by the audience. The thought of the A.I. tentacles controlling him was bizarre and wasn't in the comic. Also I think Tobey Maguire did terrible in the 2nd film and tried too hard to be funny. I thought Tobey was great in the first film. Now I think Dunst did a good job as Mary Jane in both films. This film brought back too many issues from the first movie instead of bringing about new issues for Spider-Man. Now I'm not gonna totally bash it because I thought the special effects were great and Harry finding the Green Goblin things gave us an adrenaline rush but overall the film was boring because of the slow part where he lost his powers which copied off of superman by the way. But I suggest you see it for yourself because many people loved this movie so maybe you will to, I just thought it was a let down because the first was one of my favorite movies of all time.",1089331200,6,1902,4.345505617977528

1504800,5,B00005JMQW,"I've already seen this movie three times. Each time I went to see it, it was even better than before. This honestly is the best super-hero movie to date. The actor's personalities in this movie are so deep and colorful, it's honestly like the comic book has come to life. I was sad to hear that the director and dunst don't want to come back for a 4th, because if they went on with spider-man and had to change Mary Jane and Sam, that I don't think it would be the same.
They should keep going with the movies and just keep adding story. Look at Harry Potter, it's aimed for a kid demographic and it's making tons of money. Spider-Man is aimed for kids, teens AND adults. Spider-Man should live on through many more movies.
This movie was one of the best movie's I have ever seen, hands down. I almost feel like I can't wait another two years for the third because you just want to know what's going to happen next. See this movie, and accept everything about it. because it is the best everything.",1089331200,5,998,4.3138297872340425
1504801,5,B00005JMQW,"""Spider-Man 2"" is easily the best comic book movie in the last decade, and possibly the best ever.  Combining a great hero and villain with a great story and amazing special effects, ""Spider-Man 2"" is a great movie, period.  It picks up a few years after the original, with Peter Parker (Maguire) still pining after the girl he will never let himself have, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst).  He is fighting internally between what he wants and what he feels he should do, and not seeing a way to have both.  His friend Harry Osborn (Franco) is getting steadily more and more bitter with him because he will not give up Spider-man, the person who killed his father.  Add to that the fact that he is juggling so many other things in his personal life, and you have a pretty miserable Peter Parker.  When is powers start to fail him, he decides to be Spider-Man no more.
As all this is happening, Doctor Otto Octavius (Molina) is perfecting a fusion process for OsCorp that will be a great advance in the field.  An accident fuses four mechanical arms to his spine and sends him on a course of destruction that can only be stopped by Spider-Man.
Working from a story by ""Smallville""'s Miles Millar and Alfred Gough, and Pulitzer-prize winning author Michael Chabon, Sam Raimi has crafted a sequel that far outshines its solid predecessor.  Maguire has made Peter Parker his own, and Alfred Molina breathes intelligent menace into Doc Ock.  The special effects, especially during the fight scenes, and incredible.  These are easily some of the best fight scenes ever put on film.  This is a movie that can be enjoyed by anyone...the perfect summer blockbuster.
And finally, mark your calendars for May 2007, when ""Spider-Man 3"" will hit theaters.  ""2"" will be difficult to top, but if Raimi continues to pour his passion for the character into the movies, he will have a good shot.  Bring on ""3"".",1089331200,11,1884,4.689969604863222

Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has grown tremendously as a character, because in the sequel Peter is having more and more trouble with the burden of being Spiderman. Kirsten Dunst brings the movie home as Mary-Jane Watson, the longtime crush of Peter Parker.

I think we can all look forward to the next one which should feature the Hobgoblin and some other villian. Anyway I say that you all must go see this movie. It's very very good!!!

1504804,4,B00005JMQW,"The trailers for this movie looked great and the reviews have been stellar. Definitely the movie of the summer whether you are a Spidey fan or not. As most reviews have pointed out, the storyline is very well developed. Peter Parker struggles with complexities of living a dual life. And decides for a time to be Spider-Man, No More.

I won't go into detail too much about the plot as every other review on here will probably give you a synopsis. I will however, make some comments about what I particularly liked or disliked about this film.

I found that I came out of the movie thinking that there wasn't as much action as I expected. It was strange that Peter Parker's powers could go away simply because he didn't want to be Spider-Man anymore. And I found myself noticing that Tobey Maguire was starting too look a bit old for this part. He is already 28(?) now, and by the time Spider-Man 3 is released, I may not be able to be convinced that he Peter Parker anymore. I was also a little disappointed that the rumours of a Venom appearance weren't true and that the next movie will probably feature Harry Osbourne as the Green Goblin. And I didn't like how so many people saw Spider-Man's identity (Harry, MJ, Doc Ock, all the people on the train).

Among the things I liked most was the beginning of the movie, which was very clever in the way that it showed you storyboards from the 1st movie to refresh your memory and summarize what has happened. Undoubtedbly, the action scenes in this movie were great (eg. the scene where he has to stop the speeding train). And the storyline is very well developed. In addition to these, there was also a good mix of humour thrown in to make the movie even more entertaining (eg. when Peter gives up being Spider-Man to the tune of Rain Drops Keep Falling On My Head, and the elevator scene where the stranger asks him about the costume... ""a little itchy""... haha). We also saw characters from the comics such as John Jameson, which some of us know as Man-Wolf.

This is a great movie to see with the family and I hope that it breaks many box office records. (...) That's it for now Spidey fans! Have a great summer!",1089244800,22,2165,4.445843828715366
1504805,5,B00005JMQW,"I didn't like the first spider man movie very much and i'd have to probably give that 3 stars, but I decided to give this one a try and went to see it on opening night with a couple of friends. It was definitly alot better than the first, and unlike some movies it differed from the first in many ways but still managed to keep the same characters. If you could use half stars i'd probably give this film a 4 and a half. The ending definitly set you up for maybe another movie. I'd strongly recommend this if your looking for a good movie to see in theatres.",1089244800,2,558,4.081818181818182
1504806,5,B00005JMQW,"Peter Parker nearly forgets that when due to several crises occurring in his already hectic life, he chucks the famed red suit and mask in a dumpster.  ""I am Spiderman no more,"" he declares.  Indeed, his hectic life is divided going to college, working as a pizza delivery boy, trying to get enough money to pay his long overdue rent, and fighting crime as his alter-ego.  The trouble is, he doesn't have much of a life as a result.  He's so stressed, he even forgets it's his birthday, and hasn't been in contact with his friend Harry Osborn, still grieving over the death of his father in the first Spiderman and still seeking vengeance on Spiderman, and with Mary Jane, acting in The Importance Of Being Earnest.  Unfortunately, an act of crime fighting causes him to be late for the play, disappointing the already beleaguered MJ, who announces that she is seeing someone.  That someone turns out to be the son of The Daily Bugle's J. Jonah Jameson, the egomaniac tabloid editor who still treats Parker like dirt beneath his shoes and prides himself on wanting to drive Spidey out of business.
This installment has Spidey fighting Dr. Octopus, the former Otto Octavius, a scientist whose attempts to create a new kind of fusion technology that would yield cheap energy or make Manhattan toast with enough for a side of eggs result in an accident where the artificial nervous system with four shiny metallic tentacles become fused to his body.  Unfortunately, the chip that gives him control of his mind is destroyed, turning him into a villain who wants to restart the fusion experiment that failed.  And for that, he turns to crime, his appearance heralded by the same pounding footsteps reminiscent of a T-Rex in Jurassic Park or Godzilla in Godzilla (1998).  But Octavius isn't a clear cut villain, but a victim of circumstance, like Mr. Freeze in the fourth Batman.  Before his transformation, he's a genius, but also a loving husband to his wife.  He tells Peter Parker that knowledge is a privilege, but also not to suppress the love one feels for someone
It seems that Parker is happy to no longer be the webslinger.  His grades improve, he makes an effort to have a life, and his less-stressed look yields a smile on his face, evident in a series of shots with B.J. Thomas's ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"" playing.  But the question is this.  As his late Uncle Ben told him, he had a special gift, and with that gift, moral responsibility.  His wishes to have a normal quiet life, to win back MJ, are overshadowed by his moral responsibility because he is denying himself his potential, or the importance of being earnest, namely being Spiderman.  Loving MJ is impossible, because saving other people takes precedence, plus she would be his Achilles heel.  All his enemies have to do is take her hostage to gain an edge over him.  And more to the point, with Spidey out of the way, Dr. Octopus and other criminals have a free-for-all.
Tobey MacGuire fits snugly in the role of Parker as Parker does in the Spidey costume, someone's who quite appealing, sympathetic, and sensitive, a guy trying to juggle many priorities.  From Indiana Jones's treacherous assistant in Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Joe Orton's lover and murderer in Prick Up Your Ears, the religious mayor of the provincial town in Chocolat, and Diego Rivera in Frida, Dr. Octavius demonstrates another interesting role for the versatile Alfred Molina.  The real surprise here is Kirsten Dunst, who has never been more appealing than here instead of just being another pretty face.  And yes, there is another Stan Lee cameo, but you better look quick aboard a runaway train.
Spiderman 2 surprised me by being better than expected and the special effects, which I normally deem a secondary consideration, are superior.  There's a very human story beneath, and as a result, I deem it the best superhero movie I've seen since Superman.",1089158400,33,3910,4.787202380952381
1504864,5,B00005JMQW,"Weaknesses of the First Spiderman:  1.) little humor 2.) Mediocre villain 3.) Overrated and tensionless action sequences
Strengths of the Second Spiderman:  1.) plenty of humor 2.) One of the best supervillains portrayed on screen (and from weak source material, Doc Oc in the comic books was pathetic...the screenwriters did a masterful job of reinterpreting the character and making him more complex and more menacing for the screen) and 3.) heartstopping action sequences.  The first film neglected the wall-crawling comic book visuals that made Spiderman so popular, which was the image of Spidey jumping from wall to wall to ceiling.  Too many jumping up and down, punching, dangling from bridges in the first film.  In this one, the sideways battle against Doc Oc on the speeding subway is flawless and ranks w/, if not trumps, some of the ""artistic"" action sequences in the first Matrix.
I admit, I never cared much for Spidey when I collected comic books (even though I bought Amazing Spiderman and Web of Spiderman and Spectacular Spiderman regularly...go figure).  I liked Batman, Iron Man, Dr. Strange...Spidey was way down on the list.  This movie made me like Spiderman as a character.  Peter Parker is so root-for-able.  His inner conflict is both personal yet epic, he becomes a new mythological character for modern America--the struggle between living one's life for oneself, and living one's life for others.  He, and Superman, and Batman (and to a lesser extent the Hulk and the X-Men), are our Hercules and Achilles and Gilgamesh.
This movie hits the right note on so many levels, I almost fear  the 3rd movie.  How can they top this film, emotionally and viscerally?  Particularly if they do what is hinted, and turn to the ""Lizard"" as the next villain?  Enjoy this one, because it's about as good as a superhero/action film as you will ever see.",1089158400,9,1867,4.980645161290322
1504865,5,B00005JMQW,"Spiderman 2 simply rocks.  Everything that made the first film so good is back and is better this time.  Tobey Maguire continues to show us that there is no other option for this role, Kirsten Dunst is a picture perfect MJ Watson, the script is complex, yet understandable and logical, the villain is 10 times better, both in concept and in execution.  In short, there is no way that the first Spiderman can compete with this sequel.
The cast is basically the same as the first movie, the only missing actors are Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben and Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin because both of their characters were killed in the first film.  (Both are back in very small cameos in this film, however).  Naturally the stars (Maguire, Dunst)get a lot of screen time and are good.  Director Sam Raimi makes a great decision when he gives Rosemary Harris as Peter's aunt a larger role to show us her character with much more depth, and he lets us see much more of J.K. Simmons as the cigar chomping cut-to-the-chase editor who steals all his scenes.  These are great characters to give us more of.  He actually needs to cut back on the exposure to James Franco (Harry), who is annoying and bratty and only brings the film down.  Maybe he's there to give the girls something to drool over.  Being a man, I can't really say.
The special effects are better for two reasons.  First, they look more believable.  I agree with most critics who thought the CGI in the first film was too cartoon looking and not realistic enough.  When Spiderman jumped from building to building, it looked ridiculous.  Whenever something like that happens, it detracts from the enjoyment of the film.  Not here.  The effects are better, and so tight that you don't notice them.  But they are also just better tricks.  When Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) has the experiment which goes wrong in his loft, the sound and visual effects are mind blowing.  I can't wait to get this DVD and send it though my DTS system at home.
Also, the Doc Ock villain is so much better than the Green Goblin.  Dafoe is a great actor, but he was so over the top in that film and his costume consisted of a Halloween mask and a cheap looking sled to fly around on.  Molina's Doc Ock with his four tenticles and their power are not only visually stunning, but much scarier and the fights with Spiderman were fun.  Lots of real tough battles where both got in their shots.  I thought a possible weakness was the solution to the huge energy problem at the end, you'll see what I'm talking about.  That could have been better done.
The story is interesting and believable.  The reason Maguire is the perfect choice here is that he makes a perfect Peter Parker.  Most of his work as Spiderman is done with computers, but unlike a lot of superheros who don't have any weakness even in their citizen life, Maguire is great as the bumbling, down on his luck Parker.  He has serious questions about his ability to keep being Spiderman with the other things going on in his life and the film is not scared of that, to show that ""weakness"" in him.  I think it makes the film that much stronger.  In short, this is a can't miss film.  Lots of action, great characters played by great actors, and a fun story.  What more could you want?",1089158400,,3267,4.477157360406092
1504866,4,B00005JMQW,"I was one of the few who did not like the first movie too much, where its bad acting and 'great' story of adolescence was wasted on me.  It was still a good movie, just not great as many hailed it to be.  With the big hype for the second movie, I expected more - better acting, better story, and basically a better movie.  It did accomplish that but not without some flaws.
Well, I will say that I enjoyed this movie a lot more than the first one but that's only because they decided to add so many cheesy one-liners, overly dramatic scenes, too-well scripted scenes for scenes that should be more improv, and fan-service (scenes where fans will derive more enjoyment from ala Yoda fight in Star Wars Episode 2).  Basically, most of my laughter and enjoyment was derived from points that I think the filmmakers didn't plan for, which I won't get into specifically due to revealing possible spoilers.  The acting was subpar on the part of James Franco, who I like a lot, but I will put that of because of direction and his character.  Tobey and Kirsten did a lot better this time around, and the other supporting characters really do shine.
Story-wise, it was better.  I was surprised a few times that they decided to go a certain way already and my prediction for the villain of the third movie that I gathered since the first seems to be pretty much set (with possibilities of more).  The plot and characters were a lot more developed, spending time to accentuate those that needed it.  However, there were many times scenes were used that were just irrelevant or longer than needed, its pacing was off, and the change between scenes was odd making me stop and wonder why.  There was an imbalance of stories between that of Tobey's life as Peter Parker and that of Spiderman.  There were points where you forget about the villain, Doctor Octopus / Doc Ock, until a scene comes up with him doing whatever villains do.  Also, I'm not quite sure why they are making out Spiderman to be Superman because Spiderman should not be that strong, making him out to be invincible, which was never the case.  The point was that Spiderman was supposed to be more human, making him easy to relate to.  However, in this movie, he transcended that line becoming somewhat above humans especially with the number of people that were hailing him as a 'hero' to look up to.
So, basically compared to the first, it is better, but I say not by much.  I don't think this was as well-polished as X2 and definitely had some flaws.  I think what they were going for was good but in that process, they changed a bit of what I visualized Spiderman and Peter Parker to be.",1089158400,10,2644,4.488517745302714
1504867,2,B00005JMQW,"The first Spiderman was entertaining.  It did what it was supposed to do, which was give every comic book loving man and woman a decent action flick.  The new Spiderman however has lost something.  The directing is shoddy at best.  The script is awful.  There are just too many awful lines.  ""... you're just an empty seat..."" ""I've always been standing in your doorway.""  Spiderman is supposed to have a serious side, but the script was total garbage.  The actors did a good job with what was given to them, but the story just could not hold up the foundations.  Overall a disappointing movie.",1089072000,5,594,4.634615384615385
1504868,5,B00005JMQW,"Tobey Maguire stars as Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man, in this clever, thrilling, and sometimes poignant blockbuster, sure to please all ages.  Peter is something of a lost soul, living in a dump, forever in debt, habitually late to class, and losing jobs quicker than you can say, ""Pizza Time!"" - all the while moonlighting as New York City's greatest crime fighting hero.  He's also hopelessly in love with actress Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), but unable to tell her due to his Spider-Man responsibilities and the fact that he's the shyest and most naive young man ever.  Enter Dr. Octavious (Alfred Molina), a scientist who has discovered a new and very dangerous form of energy - which goes horribly wrong and changes him into an evil monster, complete with four super-strong metal arms.  He conspires with the late Green Goblin's son (James Franco) to kidnap Mary Jane and destroy Spider-Man!

Tobey Maguire gives Spider-Man a very real, EveryGuy face; an average-Joe who doesn't have all the answers (except when he's wearing that red and blue suit), but does have lots of problems and insecurities.  Maguire, with his puppy dog face and endearing lisp, is the boy you'd like to take you to the prom (or adopt, depending on your age).  Kirsten Dunst is suitably wholesome and perky as his love-interest, and Alfred Molina is just right as the creepy and campy arch villain.  The special effects are first-class and the whole movie is a feast for the eyes.

I really enjoyed Spider-Man 2.  The eye-popping scenes of Spidey sailing through Manhattan's skyscrapers are great fun; I heartily recommend Spider-Man 2 for family-friendly thrills.",1089072000,8,1641,5.0

1504870,5,B00005JMQW,"The web slinging superhero is back, and better than ever! Superstar Tobey Maguire (""Seabiscuit"") returns as the amazing Spider-Man in the summer's most anticipated sequel, ""Spider-Man 2""! About a couple of days ago at the theater, I saw what I expected to be not only one of the best summer sequels since last year's mega hit, ""X2: X-Men United"", but also a sequel that has more thrilling action and more breathtaking visual effects than its 2002 predecessor. And man, I was not disappointed to say the least! The direction of Sam Raimi (""Army of Darkness""), who helmed directing duties for the first blockbuster, has really outdone himself with his intense direction of this action-packed sequel! The performance of Maguire, returning as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, was nothing short of extraordinary! The performance of Alfred Molina (""Not Without My Daughter""), playing the villainous Dr. Octopus (""Doc Ock""), was outstanding! Possibly, this is Molina's best villainous performance since Willem Dafoe's Norman Osborn/Green Goblin performance in the first film! Also returning for ""Spider-Man 2"" are Kirsten Dunst (""Bring It On""), James Franco (""The Company""), Rosemary Harris (""Sunshine""), and J.K. Simmons (""Hidalgo""), in which they gave flawless performances! Joining the cast are the excellent talents of Donna Murphy (""Star Trek: Insurrection"") and Dylan Baker (""Head of State"").

""Spider-Man 2"" takes place 2 years after the events of first film, in which Peter Parker (Maguire), as Spider-Man, defeated the villainous Green Goblin. Things would seem back to normal for Peter, but as the forces of reality take a toll on Peter's everyday life (including declining grades from his college), Peter doesn't seem to have time for anything, including being alienated from his Aunt May (Harris), his best friend Harry Osborn (Franco), who not only has taken over his father's business interests at OsCorp, not only does he still hold a grudge against Spider-Man for the death of his father, Norman Osborn, but is also obsessed with trying to find out the identity of Spider-Man; and trying to declare his love for the beautiful Mary Jane Watson (Dunst). Mary Jane is now a model and actress, still pining for Peter's affections but ready to move on when she gets engaged to NASA astronaut John Jameson (Daniel Gillies), son of the Daily Bugle's sleazy editor, J. Jonah Jameson (Simmons), and Peter feels that he might lose her forever. Peter thinks that his double life as Spider-Man is the reason why his life is in shambles, and he feels that he should be Spider-Man...no more. But the worst is yet to come, though. Dr. Otto Octavius (Molina), a brilliant, renowned scientist working for OsCorp, has developed not only the formula for fusion but also has a set of four mechanical arms that can keep the gravitational pull and outlashings of the fusion in check. These ""smart arms"" have a mind of their own and are fused to Octavius' spine, but not to worry, because the arms contain a microchip that keeps them from straying from Octavius' will. A freak lab accident happens as the fusion experiment goes horribly awry, which kills his wife Rosalie (Murphy) in the process, and humiliating Harry. The end result of the accident: his four metal tentacles are grafted onto his skin, thus driving him insane with his power as he unleashes his rage against the city of New York as the super-villain, Dr. Octopus (a.k.a. ""Doc Ock""). However, Doc Ock decides to try again with his fusion experiment, only this time with enough fusion power to destroy New York City! Peter feels that his sense of duty as Spider-Man should come back to him as he realizes that only Spider-Man can stop this demented genius, but Doc Ock is only the beginning of Peter's problems. Because not only is Mary Jane caught in the middle of Doc Ock's terror, but Peter's best friend, Harry, enlists Doc Ock's help in order to take down the man Harry feels is responsible for his father's death! So not only will Harry's vengeance present a challenge to Peter, but also Doc Ock will prove to be an even more worthy opponent to Spider-Man. And Spider-Man will have to push his limits to the extreme if he is to survive against Doc Ock's wrath!

Like a Snickers candy bar, ""Spider-Man 2"" really satisfies. What a joy. For fans (like myself) of the first film, the sequel will be an exhilarating ride. Every element of the storytelling is a leap beyond the first film. For one thing, the special effects have gotten better. And as far as the character of Dr. Otto Octavius/Doc Ock goes, Alfred Molina is very human and real as Doc Ock, and his fiendish arms are like individual characters all their own, like four aliens riding his shoulders, snapping their jaws wickedly. But while the action occasionally veers into melodrama, we get a much more complicated and developed sense of all the film's characters. Even Rosemary Harris' Aunt May character has more to do, and her own drama and dilemmas are nicely rounded. This characterization is not at the expense of action, however. The stunts and fights are upped considerably, and a second-act subway showdown is exhilarating (not to mention, one of my favorite ""S-M 2"" action scenes)! But it is Peter's drama -- getting along in the world, finding love, liking himself -- that stands even higher.

In conclusion, ""Spider-Man 2"" has exactly what a blockbuster sequel should have: mind-blowing action and suspense, some laugh-out-loud humor, mind-blowing special effects, and a powerful, top-notch cast! In fact, just watching ""Spider-Man 2"" left me with a feeling of going back and watching the first record-breaking predecessor all over again! In a way, the highlight of ""Spider-Man 2"" is the human story, which best reaches its audience and, in doing so, improves upon otherwise excellent predecessors. ""Spider-Man 2"" tickles the heart and the brain, suspends considerable disbelief, and does so with commanding flourish -- transcending the genre and succeeding as a great movie in and of itself. ""Spider-Man 2"", without a doubt, is a DVD must-have when released! And in the end, all I have to say is...bring on ""Spider-Man 3""!!",1089072000,,6146,5.011741682974559
1504871,5,B00005JMQW,"This movie is being hailed as the best superhero movie of all time.  This may be true.  However, the greater accomplishment of this movie is the portrait of the give and take in life.  Peter Parker is broke, tired, and stressed out; he's also Spiderman.  With scenes that seem inspired by Blake Edwards and Peter Sellers, the character of Peter Parker finds himself as another one of life's losers.  This part of the movie, and the contradictions of life that make the Spider-Man character seem real and human, are what makes this film a movie for movie people, let alone comic book people who would appreciate this film anyway.",1089072000,,628,4.724770642201835
1504872,5,B00005JMQW,"I thought this movie was going just going to be action but it definitely wasn't. From the beginning, this movie had me laughing at Peter Parker's bad life and everything that went with it. The humor was refreshing since it focused more on what everyone went and goes through. For example, Peter dropping his books on the ground and then when he tries to pick them up, some people just passing you, accidentally swinging their backpack in your head. And then there was the even more original humor, like with Peter's grandmother, which I won't say more of because that was one of the most funny parts of the movie to me. Whenever I saw the grandmother again on the screen, I had to laugh in remembrance of that ""falling"" moment.
Some people might not have liked the lack of a LOT of action. But there WAS action between Spiderman and Dr. Octopus. There was action on the train, the walls, the air, and on the ground. There were nice special effects with the action sequences too. Plus the movie was so good to me, that I wouldn't have noticed if there were a couple action parts missing.
This movie is good even if you didn't watch the first one because I didn't and I got almost everything. It might have helped me though since I used to read the comic books when I was younger. The only part I was left wondering on was if Spiderman really killed Harry's father on purpose because Peter sure didn't spell that out when Harry asked him about it.
Spiderman wants to keep his identity a secret of course. But all throughout the movie, he ended up showing his identity to so many people. Then of course there is Mary Jane. She is in love with Peter but gets engaged to this other guy. I didn't understand how she could give up on Peter one day and then just get engaged two days after. But that is just me. Even with these tiny inconsistencies, the movie was absolutely great. Go see it and buy the DVD.",1089072000,4,1900,4.385269121813031
1504910,5,B00005JMQW,"Yes, Yes, Yes! This is how a movie should be done. Though it was your typical summer blockbuster fare, it has something for everyone- romance, action, comedy. We follow Peter Parker through the ups and downs of jugglingv being Spiderman , working, school and his romance with Mary Jane ( the beautiful Ms. Dunst). The most insightful character in the entire movie had to be the Aunt. Even though her lines were sappy, she proclaimed the message of the movie, ""There is a hero in all of us"". James Franco - whew! who knew that he would ever make playing the part of Harry Osbourne after getting tied to a bed in a thong in ""Whatever It Takes"". He is very talented though and in the movie you could feel his struggle with the pain of his Dad's death by Spiderman. I was excepting a lot more from the villian of the movie, Dr. Oc and received less from him. He didn't seem that much of a villian to me - a boring villian perhaps. This movie was fantastic and be sure to check it out b/c your  summer won't be right without it.",1089072000,,1023,4.27319587628866
1504911,5,B00005JMQW,"I won't waste many keystrokes on this review, as it has been well reviewed by others before me. However, I want to give my share of stars to this movie, because it really deserves that.
Personally I think this one was even better than the first Spiderman (2002), and I can't hardly wait for the 3rd one to come out (eta 2007).",1089072000,,326,4.274193548387097
1504912,4,B00005JMQW,"Let me just start out by saying that I am well aware of the difficulties and limitations that directors face when they take a treasured character and attempt to mold him/her into a living, breathing version. It is simply impossible to live up to everyone's expectations and the best thing that any filmmaker can do is to balance out his/her own experience(s) with the demands that devoted fans will undoubtedly heap upon the project.
Moving from there, let me say that Sam Raimi has done a decent job in translating Spider-Man from the comic-book legend to the silver screen, although there are a few things which have gotten in the way of a smooth transition.
I grew up collecting Spider-Man comics and loved how they developed knowledge and empathy in the reader. As hokey as it sounds, I truly feel that I grew up a little more each time I read a new issue. This has been the power of Marvel Comics over many years, since those wonderful artists allowed us to actually feel what it might be like to be an extraordinary individual in a real world facing real problems.
During the first hour of Spider-Man 2, I could really feel what Sam Raimi was attempting to do with the story and the characters, but I ended up feeling just a bit angry and overwhelmed. Watching Peter Parker having so much trouble with his life is normal for a true Spider-Man fan, but the first hour of the movie was like having the first 120 issues crammed into a fat taco and shoved into my mouth. I kept saying to myself ""Yes, yes, yes. I get it already! PETER PARKER IS A LOSER!""
Here's something that might confuse long-time Spidey fans. When Peter's powers start failing him, at first he loses his web-spinning ability. I thought to myself ""Oh here is how they work the web-shooters in."" I figured that his body might not be able to handle excessive web-spinning, and I thought that Raimi would deliver the entrance of a web-shooter by way of Peter's intellect. But then all of his spider powers began to fail! I was trying to figure out which way the plot was going. Then I remembered a few instances from the comics when Peter lost his abilities, one of which was mental. I'm glad that Mr. Raimi does his best to harness the power of the comic.
Although I felt really frustrated with how the first hour of the film couldn't seem to get a straight message across (the ""Raindrops-B.J. Thomas scene insulted me somewhat), let me say that the remaining portion of the film did a good job of redeeming it all. I can see how Raimi would want to prevent the film from being too serious, and so he tried to keep it light-hearted without being self-conscious. I appreciated how the film developed Doc Ock's character to be a bit more profound, although I scoffed somewhat at the notion of the arms as their own entities. The effects are excellent and are better this time at helping the audience believe that Peter and Spider-Man are one and the same. The Uncle-Ben dilemma is re-visited because of it's importance, but it almost goes a bit too far. As an audience, we already know that it is something that Peter will always carry inside him. The Doc Ock/Fusion plot is a tad far out on the edge, but gets the job done. All in all, the film does a nice job and I look forward to seeing it again.
Thank you, Mr. Raimi, for doing your best!
One more thing, though. Did quite so many people have to find out what Spider-Man really looks like under the mask?",1089072000,,3427,4.4848
1504913,5,B00005JMQW,"I cannot believe it! I love the first one so much and watched it again and again.  I did not expect the sequel to even hold up to the first.  Boy, was I wrong!  I went and saw Spiderman 2 today.  It was action-packed!  I loved it!  You felt bad for ""Peter Parker"" (Tobey Maguire) in this movie.  My heart went out to him.  I almost cried a few times (but I am a very emotional person).  There is also some romance as Peter battles his feelings for Mary Jane (Kirsten Durst).
I loved it from start to finish and will probably go see it again and will be sure to get it as soon as it is available on DVD!",1089072000,,602,3.909090909090909
1504914,4,B00005JMQW,"Terrifically charged and different than its predecessor, Spider-Man 2 is a must for lovers of the comic book and anyone who enjoys emotional and enriching storytelling. The special effects can either wow you or make you smell cheese, but that isn't important here. This time out, we get a level of emotion unlike anything seen on the screen in the past year and a line-up of incredible action sequences. MaGuire and Dunst are great young actors who need their proper credit. Anyone who misses this summer blockbuster should be jealous--it is truly a good film, even if you aren't into fantasy, with laughs, sadness, and action movie fun and intensity all balanced out by a sweet romantic subplot that is nearly THE plot. Now, I am actually hoping for a great sequel!!!",1088985600,,768,4.825757575757576
1504915,5,B00005JMQW,"I gave the first Spider-Man film five stars, but this one is even better.  This time out, Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) is up against Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina), a tentacled maniac who is obsessed with completing an experiment that may destroy New York City.  Since he depends on Harry Osborne's (James Franco) Oscorps for funding and vital materials, he is also drawn into that young man's obsession with wreaking vengeance on Spider-Man for the death of his father, the original Green Goblin.

As spectacular as the action is, there is a human dimension to this film that adds so much depth to it.  Peter Parker is torn between the demands of being Spider-Man and his desire for a normal life, so much so that it claims a toll on his powers.  The Peter Parker-Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) romance ends up exactly where it should at the end of this film, showing that this series has much more respect for the intelligence of its characters than the Superman series ever did.  This film has a lot of heart.  After a spectacular battle atop a moving train, Spider-Man must bring the hurtling vehicle to a stop before it flies off the end of the track.  The sequence is exciting, funny, and the way the passengers treat the exhausted Spider-Man after he has saved their lives is extremely touching.

You watch the movie to see Peter Parker near tears at the end of a long day, when everything seems to go wrong, and he pulls his underwear out of the laundry to see that his 'Spidey Suit' has stained them blue and red.

1504971,2,B00005JMQW,"Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is burning the candle at both ends. While trying to police the streets as Spider Man at night, he's going to school and working do the day, but he can't keep it up. Meanwhile, he's losing touch with his friends Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and Harry (James Franco), who is still hacked off about the death of his father at Spidey's hands in S-M 1.
This second movie largely concerns itself with whether Peter will give up his heroism to pursue MJ and his studies, or follow his destiny as Spider-Man. These existensial questions crowd out the action plot, which involves a mad scientist (Alfred Molina) who is trying to.... do something with a big glowing machine.
There's so much blather about duty, responsibility, and the use of power in SPIDER-MAN 2 that I have to say I've seen Ingmar Bergman movies with a better sense of pace. Maguire, terminally diffident, spends a lot of time looking confused and bumbling around, while Dunst and Franco are wasted. Molina finds some nuance in his role, but the script disappears him for far too long in mid-film. Rosemary Harris is good as Aunt May, but she's saddled with a ridiculous speech about heroism.
The action scenes do perk things up, especially when Maguire and Molina fight on a moving train, and although I'm not a fan of digital effects I thought they were well blended in here.
One other major quibble: The movie suggests that Peter's web-spinning power is tied to his self-esteem, which contradicts the traditional radioactive spider storyline. Peter has no trouble getting his power back when the story requires it.
Also with JK Simmons, Bill Nunn, Dylan Baker, Cliff Robertson, and Willem Dafoe as the ghost of Hamlet's father (oops, I mean Dr. Osborn)
SPIDER MAN 2 is a glum popcorn movie that tries and fails to achieve profundity .....",1088985600,4,1826,4.8
1504972,5,B00005JMQW,"When ""Spider-Man"" was released in 2002, I was amazed to see how good of a movie that Sam Raimi and writer David Koepp created about a comic book super hero.  Sony announced after seeing the huge box office sales that ""Spider-Man 2"" was set to release in 2004.  I was excited to hear that there would be more Spider-Man, but was also concerned.  My thought was that the first movie was so good that if the second one was a little less in quality, meaning its still a great movie but not as good as the first, that people will be disappointed and say that the movie sucks.  Well after seeing the movie, I don't have to worry about that anymore.
The story continues two years from where the first one stopped.  Peter Parker is trying to balance school, work and a personal life, along with being Spider-Man.  He is always tired, not doing well in school, never able to fulfill committments and still chasing after Mary Jane, who is now a success stage actress.  Peter is doing a paper on Professor Otto Octavious and his new science experiment.  But when his experiment goes wrong, Octavious' wife gets killed and he is now controlled by the robotic arms that he attached to his body in order to do the experiment.  The robotic arms make him evil and convince him that he needs to rebuild his project that has the capability to destroy haf of New York.  So he goes on a crime streak to get some money, hence becoming enemies with Spider-Man.  Peter Parker is becoming frustrated with his crime fighting life, especially after he finds out MJ is engaged.  He decides that he doesn't want to be Spider-Man anymore and soon enough realizes that can't escape his destiny.  Thats enough story without giving too much away.
The main players from the first movie are back in this one.  Tobey Maguire gives an amazing performance is this installment, a better performance than the first.  Thank God that he was able to make this movie.  Kirsten Dunst, James Franco and Rosemarry Harris also return for this movie.  The new memeber Alfred Molina plays Doc Ock and does a pretty good job.  I don't think he gave as good of a performance as Willem DaFoe did, but still an excellent job.  The most important person that came back for the sequel was Sam Raimi.  Most movies that have continuing storylines get bad if they lose the director, i.e. Batman without Tim Burton.  The direction of this movie, along with the first one, are what make the movies great.
As for the movie, this one has a more indepth storyline.  There is a lot of human emotion involved in the storyline.  I like the bad guy, Doc Ock.  He was my favorite bad guy in the comic books and the effects that were used and his creation to the big screen was awesome.  The action scenes were better in this movie and the special effects were a lot better.  My only grievence with the movie is that it moved slower than the first.  Too many long Aunt May scenes that really slowed down the pace of the movie.  Otherwise this movie is excellent.  Is it better than the first?  I would say that it has some better parts, but also some worse parts.  Its really too hard to choose which one is better.  I guess you'll have to go watch the movie, which I highly recommend that you do, to decide for yourself.",1088985600,8,3252,4.459322033898305
1504973,4,B00005JMQW,"Just having seen ""Spider-Man 2"" I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of its drama -- perhaps one could say the dramatic resonance is due to the long-known Spider-man back story, but director Sam Raimi actually makes the story and characters come first and the CGI and other effects serve the story, not the other way around -- which is how most comic book hero movies play out.
""Spider-Man 2"" actually has true, deep scenes of drama, enough to move you -- and it's very few, if any, comic-book hero movies that do that. The first ""Superman"" movie is probably the only other one that acheives true drama.
Whereas my reaction to the first ""Spider-Man"" was one more of curious interest, than true appreciation, since it was a rather safe delivery. But ""2"" handles everything deftly -- Spidey's/Peter Parker's dilemma, his relationships with Harry Osborn, Mary Jane, Auntie May -- and it even deftly shows the conflict within Dr. Octavius. While it is made primarily for a young/teen audience, it does have a maturity and even, at times, a grim, melancholy mood. Most importantly, you care for these characters -- and Dr. Octavius is not your run-of-the-mill, mustache twisting bad guy. He's an inventor with good intentions who, due to a string of bad coincidences, is trapped by his own invention. If there is a downside, it's the J. Jonah Jameson performance. Sure, J. Jonah Jameson is an over-the-top persona/character, but the performance, while done with a sort of corny charm, it doesn't really fit in with the other performances which are straightforward and not cartoonish.
""Spider-Man 2"" is a great improvement on the first movie, and definitely beats the sophomore jinx, making the rare sequel that is much better than the first.
Lastly, the ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head"" bit/montage was very humorous, and a nice touch, punctuated by one big wink.",1088985600,,1864,4.939490445859873

1504975,5,B00005JMQW,"I saw this movie on July 2, 2004 and it was awesome! In some ways, I think Spider-Man is even more appealing than Super-Man because you don't really know if he will win. That was the appeal of the early Bat-Man films as well!
Anyway, this has an even better story than the original film! Unlike The Green Goblin (who everyone wanted to see get whipped)Doc Ock was a villian that you will feel sorry for though you know he must be stopped! The Peter/MJ romance was further explored as well as their respective characters brought out more. Plus, at least three potential villians for Spider-Man 3 were hinted at in this film! I won't reveal which ones but it'll be easy to figure out.
Check this movie out! It is worthy of its acclaim!",1088985600,3,733,4.437037037037037

1505031,4,B00005JMQW,"***WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILERS!***
Some of the previous critiques of Spidey 2 were interesting, like the one of the little girl pulling Peter up from the hole (altho no one laughed at that in the movie, there was a group in the packed theater I attended that exploded in laughter when Spidey/Peter was being passed hand over hand to the back of the subway car, which I didn't think was funny)--and I respect honest criticism so I won't go over anything else that everyone has already said, so I will keep my following remarks after seeing the film brief:
Loved:
-Peter's budding scientific genius was FINALLY alluded to after being sacrificed in Spidey 1 to ""organic"" web-shooters;
-Franco's acting;
-Molina's casting;
-J.J.J. (Simmons deserves an Oscar! What timing! He reminded me of ""The Front Page"" or any other of one of those marvelous old snappy patter movies);
-more action sequences, one with--finally!--a Spidey mid-fight bon mot;
Loathed:
-only ONE Spidey mid-fight bon mot;
-Aunt May's borderline cruel reaction to Peter's confession and equally weak make-up to him they next time they meet;
-no resolution to the Aunt May housing situation (she lost the house?!?!);
-the Russian waif/choco cake and milk bit--am I the only one who found this scene clumsy, like it was going to be a set piece (MJ catches them and becomes jealous?) but was edited down?
-alhough I have no real problem with the Peter/Spidey speech at the end that turned Ock's heart around but I did expect the final arguement from him to end with a juxapoisition of Ock's wife and MJ situations;
-the ""My back, my back""--just an admitted last-minute added inside joke that ran the ""losing powers"" plotline into the ground and only served to allieviate the remaining bad feelings over the Maguire/Gylenhall debacle;
-the ""Raindrops""/slo-mo joke--an obvious out of place but typical for the old Raimi weirdo scene that I thought he had dropped to become a ""serious"" filmmaker;
Spidey 3 expectations:
-lighten up on the Spidey sturm und drang--unless you have him experience an embarrasment of riches (introduce Gwen Stacey? he becomes an assistant teacher?) as 2 was perilously close to Darkman with all the gloom and doom;
-more dramatic and comic interaction with Spidey and the police, Spidey with JJJ and Spidey with the villans--remember Spidey is Peter's true self coming out and that is a confident, devil-may-care personality that uses his spikey sense of humor as a weapon in itself--the humor at the expense of Peter is getting awful old and depressing already;
-no more scientist meets with accident and turns evil villans--either have the villian as a real criminal scumbag that gains powers (ala Electro, Sandman, etc.) or a force of nature/alien like Man-Wolf or Venom;
Bottom line:
I really didn't notice the previously mentioned logic gaps by other board participants as the editing was so well-done I really didn't have a chance to thing about it--also, I was willing to fill in the gaps with my own internal reasoning (maybe Peter/Spidey was still passed out after Harry unmasked him and that's why he didn't break the bonds to prevent the unmasking, and maybe the little girl help up to Peter was figurative as Peter was able to tap into panicked power reserves to get himself up)--this movie was every bit as good if not better than X-Men 2 (altho X-Men 1 was not nearly as good as Spidey 1) and I give it a solid 4 out of 5 stars but I cannot say I have seen the best comic book to movie adaption yet but then again I have high hopes for Batman Begins!

1505032,5,B00005JMQW,"Humor, vulnerability, and fabulous F/X all make ""Spider-man 2"" a wonderful entertainment for kids and adults alike.  Tobey Maguire is both Peter Parker and his alter ego, Spidey, and his life is a disaster.  He lives in a dump, he has no money to pay his rent, and he cannot declare his love for Mary Jane Watson because of his superhero obligations.
The villain this time around is the terrific Alfred Molina as Doc Ock, a brilliant scientist whose failed fusion experiment leaves him with metal tentacles protruding from his body and an irresistible desire to wreak havoc.  Peter, meanwhile, is so dispirited about his miserable, lonely, and impoverished existence that he contemplates putting his tights away for good and living the life of an ordinary man.  Will Peter turn his back forever on the forces of evil, or will he sacrifice his dreams in order to help mankind?
Alvin Sargent has written a very funny and touching script with just the right blend of action and emotion.  Sam Raimi directs with flair, and he gets fine performances from the young leads as well as from such veteran actors as Rosemary Harris, who plays Peter's Aunt May, and J.K. Simmons, who portrays Peter's unfeeling boss.
""Spider-man 2"" is fast-paced, witty, and even a bit poignant at times. Most of all, it's loads of fun. What more can you ask from a summer movie?",1088899200,14,1350,4.776824034334764
1505033,4,B00005JMQW,"First of all I want to say that I am a huge Spider-Man fan.  I collect the comics, watched the cartoon series, etc.
This movie lived up to my expectations and everyone of the critics reviews.  It was great, definitely better than Spider-Man 1.  The dialogue was better written.  The story was well developed and the acting was terrific.  Anyone who's read the comics will see the similarties.
Fight scenes were very well choreographed and the CGI was amazing.
My only complaints are the following:
1. Way too many people learned Spider-Man's identity and no one was going to say anything.  Come on.  If that really happened, first everyone would have been taking pics and second while he was unconcious everyone would have been tearing his costume off for a souvenir.
2.  Without giving away too much of the movie.  The problem with Peter's powers was never explained.  Problems started, then all of a sudden the problems went away.
3.  The way the final battle ended.  Why didn't Doc Ock try to save himself.  Why did he just die??
That's all for complaints.  I would recommend Spider-Man 2 to everyone.  Go see it.  You won't be disappointed.
One side note:  Did anyone else spot Stan Lee (The guy that created Spider-Man)  For those who haven't watch when Spider-Man and Doc Ock are battling for the first time.  When the debris falls to the ground, you see a man in a white coat pull a girl away.  The man was Stan Lee.",1088899200,2,1423,4.5936254980079685

Scenes in this movie had me gasping. I am a big diehard fan and I initially thought that you had to have an R rating to go all out. I was wrong. And you know what I don't mind that because this is a great movie well worth repeat viewings. As a matter of fact the price of admissions for this movie is a steal. And the idea to unmask spiderman was so touching. Run to your local theatre don't walk run. Kudos Sam Rami Kudos.",1088899200,,587,3.9411764705882355
1505035,5,B00005JMQW,"And I stand by that statement completly. Spider-Man 2 is an amazing movie, that is essentially 3 movies wrapped in one. It is a romance, a super-hero movie, and an action packed movie all wrapped in one to create what we call Spider-Man 2. The movie starts off 2 years after the first movie. Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) is still in college, doing his Spier-Man deeds and getting heat for being late all of the time (new jobs, appointments etc.) Harry Osborn (James Franco) is still mourning over the death of his father, and wants revenge on Spider-Man, and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) still has sort of a crush on Peter, and is now doing plays and trying to make it big in her acting career.
Throughout the movie there is alot of character development. You will see Harry and Peter's relationship grow from once great friends to hatred. you will see Harry as completely disgusted with Peter, especially because he takes pictures of his father's killer. Mary-Jane and Peter will also see character development with a new man in MJ's life.  These pieces of development add to the experience of Spider-Man 2 which adds so much to the great movie that it already is. The direction in the movie is great, not to mention the acting. James Franco does a great job with Harry Osborne. He is the true standout of the movie; acting wise and character wise.
Overall Spider-Man 2 probably won't be the best movie of this year - but it is the best movie I have seen this year. It has amazing special effects, great directing and acting, and the story is second to none. Think - all of the hype times about two and that is truly how good this movie is. I reccomend this movie to anybody out there - but I also reccomend that you see the original Spider-Man before watching this one.",1088899200,,1767,4.539184952978056
1505036,5,B00005JMQW,"Two years ago, I saw Spider-Man on its opening day. In my opinion, it was an average movie; there were several good action scenes but it wasn't anything special. I was greatly surprised when the movie grossed over 114 million on its opening weekend. Probably because of the movie's success, Columbia decided to do a sequel. Going into Spider-Man 2, I thought it would be a disappointment. Sequels were usually worse than the original and the original wasn't all that good. Boy oh boy was I wrong. Not only is Spider-Man 2 an excellent sequel but it also almost destroys the stereotype that sequels are bad.
Spider-Man 2 continues where the original left. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is desperately trying to cope with being Spider-Man and living his everyday life. His superhero ways have led to him to lose a job, to see his grades fall, and to find himself drifting apart from the people he loves. Meanwhile, one of Peter's best friends, Harry Osborn (James Franco), the son of Norman Osborn (the Green Goblin who Spider-Man faced in the original) is conducting an experiment with Doctor Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) to use fusion to build mechanical arms that can be operated by the brain. Harry wants Spider-Man dead after the murder of his father and his goal throughout the movie becomes to find the hero and unmask him. Anyway, Peter is invited to the experiment, in which Octavius explains that this thingy in the back of the device will make sure that he controls the arms and that they don't control him. Well, as you have probably guessed, the experiment goes wrong and the thingy breaks. Doctor Octavius becomes Doctor Octopus A.K.A. Doc Ock. As Doc Ock begins his reign of evil, it's up to Spider-Man to stop him. But there's another problem; struggling with his personal problems, Peter decides to stop being Spider-Man. Will he realize that the city needs him or will he forget about his life as a superhero?
The story in Spider-Man 2 isn't very original and parts of it seem taken from Spider-Man. Nonetheless, you almost forgot it as you're watching the film. Acting is the same; none of the performances are Oscar-worthy but aren't so bad that you aren't able to identify with the characters. Sam Raimi truly shows off his directional skills here. There are a couple of great shots. Visuals are just as good and the special effects are a large improvement over the originals.
Overall, Spider-Man 2 is the perfect popcorn summer flick. There is never a dull moment in this movie and it moves fast and quick. The movie lasts for more than two hours but it passes a lot quicker than that. The fight sequences are also a sight for the eyes and should appeal to any action fan. Perhaps the best part of Spider-Man 2 is how it has the perfect mix of stylized action and story. In fact, there's probably more story than action. Spider-Man 2 is five times better than the first and it deserves to be seen. It has everything a movie should have: a conflict that results in some action sequences, a moving story with great performances, some comedy tossed in to lighten the mood, brilliant visual effects, and excellent directing.
If you haven't seen Spider-Man 2, stop reading this review, run out, and get tickets. This movie must be seen; it is that good.",1088899200,,3268,4.715034965034965
1505037,2,B00005JMQW,"Disappointing and dull sequel. Put it this way, I'm not looking forward to #3.
Took the kids and another adult to see it. We were all bored. There were times when the movie grabbed you, but it seemed more like a parody than a continuation of the series. I was totally lost when ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"" played while Peter Parker  walked down the streets. This is the same thing that happened to Spy Kids, Star Wars  and other successful originals-greed takes over and quality suffers. So busy to rush to capitalize off the original, that the story, what little there is, takes a backseat to profit.
Of course the effects were good, and if you do the movie, be prepared to have your finger on the fast-forward button a lot.
There were times when Parker annoyed me. His grandmother is behind on her mortgage, and he just wallows in self-pity rather than helping her. Then he mopes some more and she loses her house. Then he mopes some more and bores me to death. I was a fan of the comics, and he would bend over backwards for his aunt. When I saw the scene where they show the past-due mortgage, I figured he'd spring into action and at least take a few pictures of himself to sell to the newspaper. And he doesn't even help her move out of the house. She had to get some little neighbor kid to help. Again, in the comics he's not mental, just a teenager with teenager problems; so it made me wonder if the writer was at all familiar with the Spiderman comics.
The theater was close to packed the day I went. I noticed one laugh from the audience, some mild amusement about two times, and that was it. When it ended I looked around and everybody seemed as relieved as I was that it ended.

No longer just dealing with the simply intricacies of relationships, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) now has to fix all his relationships, with his best friend, his aunt, and Mary Jane.  As Peter's life gets complex so does the movie with cooler shots and an overall more in depth story.  Dr. Octopus, another enemy born out of the Oscorp Corporation, comes to spoil the fun.  With a tantalizing touch of the trio's triumphant third movie (a lead into the third Spiderman), I would say the movie wrapped itself up in success.

This sequel is yet another worthy follow up from Sam Raimi, who've done a splendid job in recreating the SPIDERMAN Mythos for the present cinema's movie industry. Enter Doc Ock, that's well portrayed by the spanish/italian actor Alfred Molina- who is perfect for the role's bill I should say. There are cameos by no other than Bruce Campbell, and Stan Lee as well. No sign in the movieplots' deranged courtship of Doc Octopus for Aunt May (as it was in the comic books) - however, the battle between Dr Ock and Spidey's one among the toppermost best movie battlescenes that is ever seen on film. It could've been hackneyed, but hell no! it's damn great... reminds you of WWF's peak years back in the eighties, but only a lot more higher notch in the way the fight scenes are executed of course; the special effects by the way - are used in such great balance to the scenes that no fan of digital/CGI effects should miss.
On the other hand, what's with MARVEL Comics' list of upcoming flicks from their line of titles with rumours of the GHOST RIDER movie coming along the way, and the new PUNISHER flick as well -- for XMEN3 it smells like it would be the dawning of the Pheonix saga,,, but then again - that is another story.

There is a reason for this because - as anyone who has read his book, Marvels, will realize - he has influenced the look of the film.  Here, we see the Marvels through the eyes of ordinary people.  Sam Raimi started this look in the first movie, but here he has deepened and expanded it.
Spider-Man 2 is a better movie than the first one.  The reason for this isn't the fight scenes - although they are the best super-hero fight scenes ever!  What's great about this movie is that it is true to its subject-matter.  I attribute a lot of its success to novelist and comic-book geek, Michael Chabon, who contributed to the story.  The script is light-years better than the original's and it captures the spirit of the Marvel Comics.  There are a lot of smart in-jokes, including a completely random homage to Queer as Folk!

Everything about this movie is outstanding and not for one moment do you really want to take your eyes off the screen. Without revealing any of the story plot, I can honestly tell you that it is incredible, especially the romantically plot between Peter Parker (Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Dunst), Harry Osborne's (Franco) quest to kill Spiderman, and Dr. Octopus (Molina) trying to capture Spiderman. Dr. Octopus is truly scary, and is a great villain in this movie and the Spiderman franchise as a whole. Even though I hope in part 3 Venom or Carnage appear.  Every actor was extraordinary in this movie, with each actor accurately portraying the emotions they should feel and also showing style during action scenes. Maguire has shown us before that he is an outstanding actor, and he has shown us again that he has the ability to do it.

1505083,5,B00005JMQW,"When Peter Parker's Aunt May can't even get the bank to cough up her free toaster ... well, that's the sort of film this is.  The *characters* move this movie, altho the SPFX are icredible, too.

Spider-Man's 'performance anxiety', which leads to his retirement - ja, Spidey quits his job as Spider-Man - the not-so-brief appearance of Dr. Kurt Conners [later to become Spidey's foe, the Lizard], Peter trying to hide his costume in the laundromat [hey, even superheroes have laundry issues!] even Aunt May's reaction to being nabbed by Doc Ock [you *go*, Aunt May!] are all sweet grace notes, but the primary thrust of this film is the 'real' problems of being poor & a superhero.

Peter Parker, a/k/a/ Spider-Man, is trying to juggle several problems at 1ce: losing his job because he saves 2 kids in the street, failing his college courses, can't seem to find time to be w/his sweetie, Mary Jane Watson - when he meets Dr. Otto Octavius, a brilliant scientist whose own life has everything that Peter's lacks.  ""Be true to your heart,"" Octavius urges.

But Peter's problems are just beginning.  MJ has accepted a proposal of marriage from his boss' son, astronaut John Jameson ... an offer he can't even begin to top, as he fears MJ might become a target of Spidey's enemies if he & she are linked too closely.  & his powers are becoming erratic...

As to the above-mentioned SPFX: when Doc Ock 1st emerges, Donald [my hubby] gasped, ""God God, those things are ... hold it! ...  They sure look real!""  & he works as a computer artists' helper to make sure what they do looks OK!  Spidey looks real, too; & the scene where a maskless Spidey risks his life & self to save subway commuters is worth the price of the film, by itself alone.

1 character's reaction says it all: ""He's just a kid!  No older than my own!""  & so he's played...",1088812800,,1838,4.564024390243903

It's got great riffs, great heros, great action, and a great story. Peter Parker's struggle to embrace the sacrifices of his gifts and the compelling villain drive a fast-spaced story. You'll dig the flick and it's worth the price to see it on the big screen and dig the action on the big spreen. The subway scene was my favorite action.
A big motif is how Spiderman is revealed to many throughout the movie. Peter's got to wrestle with how to share his double identity with those closest to him so that the sacrifices of his double life don't paralyze him from utilizing his superpowers. Anonymous New Yorker's dig spiderman and respond well at a given point which I will not reveal to those who haven't scene the flick. Also, he needs understanding from them so he can deal with the boulders of guilt still lingering from his uncle's death. Many have commented on how character focus is a big strength of the movie, and I'll definitely agree on that point.
I watched Spiderman one on HBO a couple of times and that movie revealed some truly sappy lines that don't wear well on repeated viewings. Several scenes in Spiderman 2 will also probably grow moldy with age. A couple of characters from the first movie who have passed away are brought back in unnecessary sentimental ways. Much like Michael Jackson's ""I'm a lover, not a fighter"" cheesiness on Thriller, I think that some of the dialogue in this flick is pretty cheesy.
I recommend you see this flick, because it's probably going to be the best action flick of the summer, and it will hold up better on the big screen than on video. It's really entertaining. But on the whole it's a film to like and enjoy, and it's not the classic for me that ""Matrix"" is.

The plot was very boring with very little action.  They focused mostly on Peter's relationship with MJ.  Who wants to see that garbage in an action film.  There are very few fight scenes and they were not very good. Also the special effects in this movie were supposed to be awesome.  THEY SUCKED!!!!!!! For example, the fireball thing looked terrible, also at the end of the movie the helicopters looked like they were toys.

1505126,5,B00005JMQW,"There are many films whose storylines have encouraged sequels - many fail to be as good as the original, an audience's expectations raised due to the freshness of characters and plotlines.  There are only two that come to my mind that surpass their predecessors: ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"".  I can now add an easy third to my list, and ""Spider-Man 2"" is, without a doubt, that third movie.
The story continues with Peter Parker (so superlatively played by the boyish, nerdy Maguire) struggling through college, his grades rapidly declining because of the countless hours spent swinging about the city saving lives.  His one true love Mary Jane (Dunst) is now a Broadway actress and model, her face plastered on billboards and posters everywhere.  Aunt May has fallen on hard times, the bank threatening to foreclose on her home and Harry Osborn (Franco), now the proprietor of Oscorp, is still bent on revenge against Spider-Man for the death of his father Norman (the Green Goblin of 2002's ""Spider-Man"", played by Willem Dafoe).
Time to throw a superb supervillain into the mix.
Enter Dr. Otto Octavius (Molina), another scientist earning Peter's utmost esteem with a breakthrough experiment that will change the face of nuclear physics for years to come.  During a presentation of his latest invention that would make Oscorp a multi-million dollar enterprise again, the exposition goes horribly awry and ""Doc Ock"" is left with four mechanical tentacles bolted into his spinal column, each solid steel ""arm"" independently functional...and menacing.
Torn between the sacrificial life of a superhero and the normal life he truly wants, Pete decides to throw in the towel, surrendering his Spider suit to the trash and coming clean to Mary Jane about his feelings for her.
Or does he?
With Doc Ock up to no good and Harry's growing animosity for the masked crusader, Peter has his work cut out for him and there is no simple evasion of his civic duty.
So many aspects of this film aid in the surmounting of the original, primarily the overwhelming amount of CGI that was handsomely paid for ($54 million alone was spent on digital effects) on a $200 million budget.  What will really take your breath away are the two fight sequences between Doc Ock and Spidey, a melee atop a clock tower and a confrontation aboard a speeding ""el"" train gasp-inducing.  You'll become so engrossed by the intense physical combat onscreen that you'll forget that the two men you see fighting are not really men at all - they're computer-generated images (for the most part).  We even get an illustrated recap of the first film during the opening credits with original artwork by Alex Ross (""Kingdom Come"").  Fanboys will be especially proud of director Sam Raimi's homage to the comic, the shot of Peter depositing the Spidey suit into an alley dumpster taken directly from a panel in Issue #50 entitled ""Spider-Man No More"".
Raimi was so eager to get started on the sequel that he signed on to direct more than a month before the first film was even released and shooting began before the final draft of the script was completed.  Alvin Sargent, along with Michael Chabon, Alfred Gough and Miles Millar penned the screenplay with the guidance of Spider-Man creators Stan Lee (who has a cameo) and Steve Ditko and took the story out into left field.  Whereas ""Spider-Man"" relied on character establishment and a little schmaltz to win over its audience, ""Spider-Man 2"" gets dipped in a vat of serious drama, allowing every actor to really show their wares.
Maguire is excellent - Raimi knew what he was doing when he cast the then 26-year-old after seeing his portrayal of Homer Wells in 1999's ""The Cider House Rules"".  His participation in the sequel became hesitant when he was injured during a stunt in ""Seabiscuit"" and suffered severe back pains for several months.  A second injury (a broken arm) further delayed shooting, but Maguire rode the storm and kept Jake Gyllenhaal (the actor in mind to replace him, not to mention Dunst's current squeeze) from taking the role that was rightfully his.
Raimi made another wise casting decision with British thespian Alfred Molina, a chameleon of an actor who first got recognition as Indiana Jones' greedy jungle guide Satipo (""You throw me the idol, I throw you the whip!"") in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""; after the titillating scene where he is covered head-to-toe with tarantulas, Molina is certainly familiar with arachnids and the atmosphere of the ""Spider-Man"" set suit him well.  He eats the lens as Doc Ock, playing the character with a combination of zeal and earnestness.  After Willem Dafoe's over-the-top theatrics as the Green Goblin, Molina is a breath of fresh air and gives Doc Ock something very important - integrity.  Other actors who were considered for the role included Sam Neill (eh...), Robert DeNiro (`scuse me?), Ed Harris (no thanks) and Chris Cooper (sorry, I just keep thinking Col. Frank Fitts, US Marine Corps).  Aren't you glad Molina made the cut?
Dunst, still equipped with her B-movie scream, also gets a chance to put her talents to the test and makes Mary Jane a stronger, more independent woman with much less of a ""damsel-in-distress"" approach than the previous film.  James Franco is excellent this second time around as Harry Osborn, his bitterness towards Spider-Man spectacularly rendered through his dark, frigid glowering.  Rosemary Harris, a mere appendage in the first, gets to shine considerably as Aunt May, the Oscar-winning actress's dramatic prowess manifested in her scenes with Maguire.  J.K. Simmons is still a ball of fire as J. Jonah Jameson, senior editor of the Daily Bugle, with his perpetual anti-hero sentiments of Spider-Man and Elizabeth Banks (Betty Brant) and Bill Nunn (Robbie Robertson) reprise their roles with pride.
The film ends once again on a climactic note, setting the stage for a spectacular sequel and you'll have a pretty good idea which villain will make an appearance.  Sony Pictures greenlighted a third installment back in March of this year - the movie is slated for a 2007 release, but may even be pushed to 2006 if production goes well.  Let us hope so, because if ""Spider-Man 2"" is a promise of an even greater film to come, we're all in for a real treat!",1088812800,,6301,4.935727788279773

1505128,5,B00005JMQW,"This is definitely in the top three greatest superhero movies ever. It surpasses the first one in almost every way. The first one was definitely fun and was a great superhero movie, but it did have it's faults. This one, on the other hand didn't have any faults, at least not any I recognized on first viewing.
I liked the fact that MJ was much stronger in this movie then she was in the first one. May I also add that Kirsten Dunst is still hot. Doc Ock is a much better villain than the Green Goblin and he makes for better action scenes. The story line is great. I like the fact that character development is in the foreground rather than just something that happens (or doesn't as most superhero movies go) when there isn't any action.

Sam Raimi's style is perfect for this movie. With his direction and the casts talent and chemistry the movie works and then some.

I barely see movies opening night because I hate crowded theaters, but the teaser trailers were enough to spark my interest so that by the time the movie came out I couldn't wait.",1088726400,,1051,4.412371134020619
1505129,5,B00005JMQW,"We need Heroes. And in this world of 2004, where do we find them? In our Politics? In our Celebrities? I think not. Where we find our heroes is in the movies, and unfortunately we find them, not in or of the world in which we live, but among Superman, Daredevil, Batman and for the last couple of years we find it in Peter Parker or as he's better known...Spiderman.
Peter Parker as portrayed by Tobey Maguire is a conflicted hero: he knows what he needs to do, what he is destined to do but he's torn between Superherodom and an ordinary life of College, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and his best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco looking more and more like James Dean every minute).
""Spiderman 2"" is a touching, sad movie with a major emphasis away from the physical feats of daring and a audacious move towards, for this type of genre movie, the personal and emotional life of it's hero: Peter Parker wants a normal life but realizes that it is not in the cards for him.
Sam Raimi, director of ""Spiderman2"" has opted to make a movie filled with pathos and sadness, though the scenes of daring-do are done with bravado and expertise as befits this genre. But the lingering feeling you take away from this movie is one of emotional angst and the very real feeling that emotional connections are not easily attained nor kept. It is a very unfortunate reality of the world in which we now live: life is hell even for the super-human.",1088726400,,1436,4.484732824427481
1505130,2,B00005JMQW,"OK, I have to respond to the horribly incorrect evaluations of Spiderman 2 that have been posted on here as well as on rottentomatoes.com.  I absolutely love Spiderman 1. The movie caught Peter's excitement at leaving high school, his feeling of apprehension about what is in store for his future, and his questioning of who it is that he should become. The message ""With great power comes great responsibility,"" was brilliantly interwoven with the plot, and the scenes really created many dimensions to the character of Peter Parker and the changes that he goes through as he transforms into a hero. When I saw Spiderman 2, I was spellbound by the opening credits, which are totally gorgeous drawings of the classic scenes in Spiderman 1. Unfortunately, the quality of the opening credits surpassed the quality of the rest of the movie. The only reason that critics like this movie so much is because Peter is miserable, ""life sucks,"" everything's going wrong, and somehow critics seem to like stuff like that (i.e., ""Lost in Translation"" and other ""Life is stupid"" type of movies). Spiderman 2 did not convey ANY message besides ""Be honest with yourself and to others.""  That was absolutely it. And the issues brought up with Peter struggling to be a hero AND a college student are never resolved in the movie. The so-called solution given by Aunt May is ""Self-sacrifice"" and ""selflessness"", which basically imply that he has to flunk out in order to be a hero. This movie was so forgettable, having no moving scenes like the first movie did. In fact, just a day or two after having seen the movie, I can't remember anything except the appearance of Doc Ock and my confusion over the pointless Chocolate Cake Girl Scene. The special effects aren't even that great-- the nuclear fusion thing looked totally fake, and the villain's oh so amazing ""redemption"" at the end was just plain corny. The Green Goblin was actually insane, right up to the moment he died, and that was a villain to remember. I even felt sorry for the hot guy that MJ ditched at their wedding-- this very kind astronaut guy was humiliated and unfairly let down by MJ on their wedding day. I just had no sympathy for the main characters this time around. Peter was not the same sweet, pure guy that spoke those loving words to MJ in Aunt May's hospital room in Spiderman 1.",1088726400,3,2344,4.728606356968215

He and Kirsten Dunst are great couple that are so natural together. And Alfred Molina is a perfect villain.

- Aunt May gives her nephew a clue on how to deal with his secret arachnid problem in ""Spider-Man 2""

The best comic book movie ever. Ever.

The saga of Peter Parker and his alter ego, Spider-Man, continues as Parker has to deal with losing one of his two jobs, slipping grades (web-swinging at night is not a form of studying), a Russian landlord, Harry Osborn's drunken revenge on Spider-Man, and, worst of all, his life long crush, Mary Jane Watson, announces she's engaged to an astronaut that, adding insult to injury, is the son of J. Jonah Jameson, New York's tighest tight wad, publisher of the cities paper ""The Daily Bugle"", and Peter's boss. When Peter gives up being Spider-Man (thats after losing his web making abilities from psychological stress), things go from bad to worse as a new nemisis rises in the form of the six-armed mad scientist Otto Octavious.

Man, think you've had a bad day?!

""Spider-Man 2"" is easily one of the best sequels made (right up there with ""The Godfather II"", The Empire Strikes Back"", ""Aliens"", & ""Terminator 2""). Sam Raimi's direction is at his best (yeah, that includes ""A Simple Plan"" & ""The Evil Dead"" films) and, again takes extreme care of bringing the comic book storyline to life.

The cast is back and is in great form (it was also great to see cameos from Cliff Robertson & Willem Dafoe). You could almost peel the angst & heartache from Peter Parker right off the screen!

The action sequences are instant classics, especially, the bank robbery scene & the subway car battle.

Venom. Summer. 2007.

**It's been almost 3 long years since ""Spider-Man 2"" hit theaters & with the third installment less than a month away, Sony has decided to re-release ""S-M 2"" in a ""2.1"" version with 8 minutes of additional footage. Is it worth the upgrade? In simple terms - No. There are a couple of bits & pieces of fight scenes inserted back into the film, a scene between Mary Jane & her best friend that slows the movie down (MJ's best friend is actress Vanessa Ferlito who plays Butterfly in ""Death Proof"", the second film of ""Grindhouse""), & a few other alternate or extended takes. The bonus disc is nothing short of delving too deeply into the visual effects aspect of the film (it goes to the point of boredom).

It is not only better than the first movie, it is one of the best movies based on a comic book and one of the best movies ever made. It is on a par with the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars series in terms of quality, action and meaning.
An outstanding screenplay and great direction make the amazing action even more potent. The effects are better as is the screenplay.
The message is that each of us can be a hero if we take responsibility when we have the opportunity to help someone. It is very inspiring and the train sequence is very powerful.
The Cast:
Tobey Maguire does a fine job as Spider-Man/Peter Parker. Look for an inside joke about back pain as in reality back pain almost prevented Tobey from working.
Kirsten Dunst is perfect as Mary Jane Watson.
James Franco is a great Harry Osborn.
Alfred Molina gives a rich performance as Doc Ock/Dr. Otto Octavius
Rosemary Harris as Aunt May Parker has some outstanding moments.
Elizabeth Banks is a fantastic Miss Brant. She should have a bigger part next time, perhaps as competition for MJ.

The surprise of this movie was in its amazing depth of character.  The movie's greatness comes from its ""human"" side.  The first part of the movie shows how living the life of Spiderman has made Peter's life so hectic.  But even more, this movie is the true love story of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson, and it is a romance to remember.  The damsel in distress routine is the oldest story in the book- but this one is done perfectly.
I don't care how tough a guy you are or how hyped you are to just see to Spidey battle Doc Ock-  the scene at the end of the movie  when  Mary Jane is getting ready for  her wedding  to someone other than Peter is a real tear-jerker.

1505196,5,B00005JMQW,"My two favourite comic growing up was X-men and Spiderman. Stan Lee and Steve Ditka created an ageless hero. One that has problems such as family life financial burdens at school/college love issues etc. While saving the world in his spare time.
When Spidey was adapted to the big screen there were slight inconsitencies to the arachnid mythos that mildly rubbed me the wrong way.
But by the time I got the ticket to see the sequel these minor flaws to the continuity of the story didn't bother me at all. Mainly because the creative studio genuises stayed as close to the heart of who/what Spider-man is and what he stands for everything else is gravy. The fact he doesn't use web shooters like in the comic book becomes more than trivial when placed in a context with Molina's excellent characterization of Doctor Octavius/Doc Ock. He puts conflict into the villain making him more than a mere black hat.(Bad guy). Rosemary Harris's words of wisdom and James Franco's shadowy foreboding of avenging his father's death are only two examples of how this hero is more than bam boom bash on bad guys heads. Overall a surprisingly deep adaptation that is balanced in that it doesn't sacrifice story for its incredible special effects and action, or forget who its audience is by plumbing too deep into the romantic subplot between Peter and Mary-Jane.

But more than that, it is a triumphant return to the spirit of Marvel's comics--indeed, it is, in the very best sense, the high art of Marvel's best comics brought to life.
Don't get me wrong.  It isn't that deep--but it's more than deep enough, with some moments of honesty and depth that were surprising and satisfying.  Tobey Maguire is the perfect Spider-Man--likable, funny, and much more complex than the average superhero.  The movie puts him at the lowest point imaginable.  Just when you think his life couldn't get worse, it gets dramatically worse.  And so we get to watch this young man lift himself up by his costume and face extraordinary tests of will and self-sacrifice, all of which is done in a light enough way that you never feel preached to or torn out of the story.  All of it is pulled together by a great villain--Doc Ock, more than brought to life by Alfred Molina--extraordinary battles, and a romantic quadrangle that waits until the very last moment to reveal a satisfying, yet touching resolution.

1505198,5,B00005JMQW,"Just when I was about ready to throw in the towel on Hollywood and its univentive sequel/remake/book adaption craze of unoriginal recycling, I sat down to see the second chapter in Sam Raimi's ""Spider Man"" series. While I enjoyed the first film, it never really drew me in emotionally. It had some real cool action sequences and some interesting special effects but the story was very paint-by-numbers comic book fare. I enjoyed the film's cinematic style, which seemed to me like an homage to the 50's-style of films, but while I wasn't turned off by the the hero's backstory, I was never fully compelled by it either. When I had heard all of the cast members spit the usual studio speech about how the sequel would be even better, I took it very much with a grain of salt. By the time I came out of this movie, however, I was a believer.
""Spider Man 2"" takes place two years after the original where Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is struggling with the realization that his superhero alter-ego is alienating him from everyone that he loves. His best friend, Harry (James Franco) is stelling stewing over his father's death at the hands of Spidey and the object of his affections, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is fed up by Pete's inability to committ to her. If that wasn't bad enough, his commitment to crime fighting has cost him more than a few jobs and he's struggling to pay his rent. On the Spider-Man side of things, he has to deal with a new enemy, Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), a transformed version of Otto Octavius, a brilliant fusion engineer whose expirement ends up killing his wife and subsquently driving him insane. As far as super-villians go, this one's a doosy.
""Spider Man 2"" improves on so many aspects of the first film. Where the first film had Maguire as the akward teen coping with his newfound powers and subsquent responsibilites, this one paints him as the reluctant hero that is banished to a life of personal abandoment. The hero seems like a far greater underdog this go around as Spider-Man must deal with a much tougher villian while Peter Parker tries to put his life back together. I liked the fact that Raimi balanced out the film's jaw-dropping effects with some emotional character depth. There is a good mixture of storytelling and cinematic style here. Raimi also improved on the dialouge here. There are some comedic moments but the rivalry between Spidey and Doc Ock doesn't elevate itself to the level of cheesy line-trading that went on between Maguire and Dafoe in the first.
The performances are really what seperates this one from its predecassor. Tobey Maguire is given a lot more to do, this time around. While Molina doesn't have the same charisma as Dafoe, his villian is far more menacing. Kirsten Dunst is given a somewhat smaller role here but it serves its purpose. My one complaint is that Mary Jane doesn't really look the same in this one. In the first movie, she had a much different look to her than most of the characters that Dunst has portrayed. Here, she doesn't carry herself the same way. It doesn't really take anything away from the film but it is somewhat noticeable whether intended or not. There are a good deal of amusing cameo appearances here as well but I'm not gonna spoil them for you.
""Spider Man 2"" is not just one of the better sequels I've seen in awhile but also one of the best films of its kind that I've seen at the movies in some time. I can't remember the last time that I went into a movie theatre and was entertained on so many levels the way that I was with this film. Maybe low expectations might have played a part in it but in all honesty, I doubt it. No matter what your preconceived notion of this movie is, you will probably be drawn in just the same. You don't have to be a comic book fan or even a fan of the first movie to enjoy but it certainly doesn't hurt things. (Review: ****1/2)",1088640000,76,3883,4.540656205420827

I'm a big fan of the 50's cartoons( I so want that new box set!). It had a very good taste to it. As the years went by and the cartoon series got older( around the end of the 80's), it began to lose it's touch. I was hoping Sony would make this movie more like the 50's cartoons instead of the first one but it looks like they went there own way. What's the problem? Tobey Maguire can't act, the villain is laughable(wach the ending), you don't care about Maguire and Dunst relationship, not enough Spidey action, and you spend half the film laughing at Tobey Maguire facial exspressions(wach the train seane!!!!). Dunst is the ONLY good person at acting, well, the guy who played the villain was good to, but besids that, no one can act. I was hoping we would get a better film from the guy who made Evil Dead and Darkman. oh well, I guess every one has there flops.

1505257,5,B00005JMQW,"I must say that I was very excited about seeing this movie, so much that I was worried that I would be let down like with Star Wars I and The Matrix Reloaded.  Fortunately, Sam Raimi, Tobey McGuire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco were able to not only spellbind us again, but this film far surpassed the orginal Spider-Man, which was no easy feat.
Two years after the events of the first film, Peter Parker (McGuire) is down and out; he is losing his friends, his jobs, and and grades are quickly declining.  The cause for all this is because of his escapades as Spider-Man.  He can never keep an appointment with Mary-Jane Watson (Dunst), the woman he loves, and this drives her away.  His friend Harry Osborne (Franco) can't stand the fact that he has more loyalty to Spidey than to him.  Harry believes that Spidey killed his father, Norman Osbourne (Willem Dafoe), who, unbeknownst to Harry, was the Green Goblin.
Meanwhile, Harry is funding a project being researched by an eminent scientist, Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), which will create a new, cheap, almost never-ending energy source.  Sadly, things go wrong (surprise surprise), and Otto gets four mechanical arms fused onto his back, and they have minds of their own.  They begin to ""suggest"" that he do things, like start the project again, rob banks, and kill people.
Finally, after losing his friends and most of his jobs, Peter throws away his Spidey suit, vowing never to be Spider-Man again.  This of course opens up New York to a rapidly increasing crime rate.
All of the actors did a superb job in this film.  Dunst, Franco, Rosemary Harris (playing Aunt May), and J.K. Simmons (playing the hilarious J. Jonah Jameson) all got bigger roles, and even Cliff Robertson (Uncle Ben) and Willem Dafoe got small cameo roles.  The story remained strong, especially for a comic book film, and the effects were amazing.  This is definitely the ideal summer film.",1088640000,,1928,4.794561933534744
1505258,5,B00005JMQW,"I have to start by saying I'm fairly biased about this film.  The original was one of my favorite movies, and I grew up reading the comics religiously.  That being said, I do feel I would be able to give it an unbiased review if I didn't like it, but thankfully, that was not the case.

Spider-Man 2 is Sam Raimi at his best.  I've never been in a theater where I've felt an audience have so much fun at a movie.  This film had everything: incredible special effects, great dialogue, romantic themes, plenty of action, and some decent acting.  When I first saw the trailer for the film, I thought the special effects looked a bit shoddy, but the final release was amazing.  Everything was seamless, and the attention to detail was very noticeable.  One of the best parts aspects of this film is the comedic elements.  I didn't expect to laugh going into Spider-Man 2, but it pleasantly surprised me and I found it more humorous than most comedies.  The humor is very subtle and some of it is campy, but doesn't come off poorly.  It's great watching Parker trying to deliver pizzas in his costume to meet a deadline, or being forced to use an elevator and make small talk with the other occupant.  Raimi fans will also be pleased with a few Evil Dead II references, and one 30 second scene in a hospital realy stood out and showcased his talent for the horror genre.

Raimi captures the essence of Parker so much more closely in this film.  The Parker in this film is given a closer focus on the fact that he still experiences much of the flaws that every other New Yorker has to go through.  From having to live in a run down apartment, to never having any money.  Too many Super heroes come from wealthy backgrounds and have an unlimited supply of money, but Spider-Man is just a below-average teenager who's given an incredible ability. And this is why he's so identifiable and likeable to the audience.  As I said, Raimi does an incredible job of showing this and I couldn't believe how closely the film version of Parker matched the bumbling science nerd I grew up with in the comics.  In addition, comics fans will love this film for all of the hidden references that are stacked in the movie.  There's a cameo of creator Stan Lee, a photographic reference to a famous comic panel of Spidey taking of his mask, oft-quoted lines from the book, and Dr. Connors and John Jameson appear, who feature into the comic very prominently.

It does have a few faults, albeit they're hard to notice.  I found that some of Maguire's lines came off a bit forced, which I noticed in the first film.  Franko is also a little stiff as Harry Osborne.  I didn't notice any bad acting, but nothing I would consider Academy-worthy either.  There was also a subplot about a physical problem with Parker that felt out of place in the film and wasn't developed very well.  But it made for some really incredible scenes that I wouldn't want removed.

Overall, this is one of the best films I've seen in a long while, and accomplishes that rare feat of surpassing the original.  There were two or three specific events at the end of the movie that really blew me away and that I wasn't expecting, and will make for some very interesting sequels.  As a long-time Spider-Man fan, I can definitely say this movie is very fulfilling, and I would recommend it to audiences of any age and type.",1088640000,24,3367,4.493421052631579
1505259,5,B00005JMQW,"SEQUELS ARE NEVER AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL. Or so they say. But every know and then, surprisingly impressive part 2 comes along and wows audiences, scoops box-office success and critical acclaim. SUPERMAN, BATMAN and X-MEN et all have superior sequels. SPIDER-MAN 2 is no exception. A more fleshed-out story, deeper emotion and most importantly, fast-paced action (The train scene is incredible) work to fantastic effect. Director Sam Raimi has not only created a fantastic piece of action cinema, but also cemented the idea that sequels can outshine their lofty parents.
Returning to New York two years after the last one left off, SPIDER-MAN 2 sees Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) strain under the pressure of trying to balance a romance with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), his job at the Daily Bugle, college, fighting crime and trying to retain a sense of normality. And after a scientific accident, face off against Doc Ock, which provides for some fantastic action.
Maguire and Dunst show real chemistry and great angst as the tow troubled friends, however Alfred Molina's Dr. Otto Octavius is absolutely brilliant, and the computer-generated interaction with live action elements is seamless. Themes of friendship and self-sacrifice are well-written, and despite the genre, the story is firmly set in reality, paving the way for much easier writing, and thankfully, no cheese.
Some shaky dialogue and fairly heavy exposition didn't matter much in the first movie, and here-What can I say? An absolutely magnificent masterpiece that deserves all the box -office success and critical praise it is currently receiving.
I knew straight away after watching the previews that under Rami's steady hand, and having as much experience as you could possibly have with the comic-book ideas, that this would be something special. Much akin to Brian Singer's X-MEN 2, second time around a strong layer of confidence is evident, eschewing the fairly everyday filmmaking of Part 1 in favor of an experimental and kinetic style.
Much praise must go to those CGI effects boffins who sure had an immense job on their hands. The CG Spider-Man is a vast improvement. However given Raimi's track record for a fantastic storytelling style, it must be a gift to collaborate with people who understand the language of film so fluently. Danny Elfman's visceral score adds so much to the film's tone. Doc Ock's theme is an outstanding achievement, building on it's earlier subtle strings, slowly working up to a full-bore orchestra, amping up the film's biggest action set-pieces.
If the first SPIDER-MAN was set-up, this is the payoff. However by the end credits, we all know we'll be eagerly-awaiting round 3. I can't wait...",1088640000,28,2700,5.152619589977221

now im not one to go and entirely bash a movie, but i guess i was just really let down at what i saw in the theatre tonight.  My expectations for this movie were really high and i assumed it was going to be great.... boy was i wrong.  The whole plot of the movie just seemed to get worse as it went along.  The only real thing this movie had to offer were some pretty cool action scenes which i did enjoy, thanks computer nerds.  Besides that the plot sucked, and every 5 minutes i had to listen to a 10 minute drawn out conversation between peter parker and someone else talking about how much his life sucked and how great spiderman was.  I didn't think we needed to go so deep into the super hero role and explain it over, and over, and over again.  The love lines were totally cheesy and i just couldn't help but laugh at this whole attempt to make a sequal.  Anyway that is just my opinion, i thought X-men 2 was awesome, but this one really blew it.  I hope im not the only one in the whole world who really thought this movie sucked, but what a waste of money. YAAAAY!

There are lots of callbacks to the first movie, but never so that you'd need to have seen the first movie to understand what's going on here.  Recommended to everyone.",1088553600,,482,4.404494382022472
1505262,5,B00005JMQW,"""Spider-Man 2"" is the best comic book superhero movie made to date, and not simply by default.  The story and screenplay come from Alfred Gough and Miles Millar (co-creators of ""Smallville""), Michael Chabon (author of ""Wonder Boys""), and Alvin Sargent (Oscar winner for ""Julia"" and ""Ordinary People""), and more than any other film in this genre it is true to the character and what made him Marvel Comics' most popular superhero in the 1960s.  I teach a unit on Spider-Man in my Pop Culture class where we compare the original Stan Lee & Steve Ditko stories to what is being published today and my students have to deal with the key elements of the comic book.  This time around Sam Raimi has those elements nailed big time.
The story picks up two years after the first film, which is reprised through artwork by Alex Ross during the title sequences.  Peter (Tobey Maguire) is now in college, working a part time job, fighting crime, and generally making a mess of everything.  Being Spider-Man is a burden and it is beating Peter Parker down.  He loses his job, his grades are slipping, and even his powers seem to be leaving him.  He still loves Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), but all he can envision is a life where his enemies would threaten her life and he has to endure seeing her picture on billboards and posters all over New York City.  It becomes clear that our hero is coming to a cross-roads in his life, but we have no idea what will be the final straw, as it could be anything from the bank foreclosing on the house of Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) or Dr. Curt Connors (Dylan Baker) flunking him to J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) really firing him from the ""Daily Bugle"" to Mary Jane ending up with some other guy (Daniel Gillies).
What made Spider-Man endearing was that he was the victim of such bad luck.  With power comes great responsibility but you would think a guy could catch a break now and then.  There is a point where a bruised Peter tries to make his way home and as he reaches out to steady himself against a parked car you KNOW that as soon as he touches it a car alarm goes off.  Spider-Man endures a lot of slings and arrows in this film (e.g., Aunt May never told him how to do laundry) and all the while the gods just look down and laugh.
The Green Goblin was something of the ultimate villain for Spider-Man because he was the one who learned the web-slinger's secret identity.  But the consensus of my students each semester is that Doctor Octopus is the best Spider-Man villain.  Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) intends to make nuclear fusion work and is employed by Harry Osborn (James Franco), who dreams of making a fortune during the day and of killing Spider-Man to avenge his father at night.  Of course things go horribly wrong, and the four metal tentacles that Octavius has created are now fused to his body and have driven him insane.
We have all seen the trailer for ""Spider-Man 2"" and the scene where Doc Ock interupts a potentially tender moment between Peter and Mary Jane by throwing a car through a window at them.  This must happen over an hour into the film but it starts off a series of fantastic computer generated fights between the hero and the villain.  The reason for this and why the pairing is so perfect is that Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus can both fight on the vertical axis as well as the horizontal.  These two go at each other on the side of buildings and falling through the air as well as on top, on the sides, and through the middle of a subway train.  Then you throw into the mix that Doc Ock can be carrying off someone Peter loves and still have three mechanical arms pounding away at Spider-Man.  More importantly, when Spider-Man travels around by his webbing in this film it no longer looks like something we would expect from a Saturday morning cartoon.
But the conflict between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus is only one of a half dozen that provide the interpersonal web of problems closing in on Peter and the way they all fit together gives ""Spider-Man 2"" a weight hitherto unsuspected in superhero movies.  This point is best evidence by the fact that Aunt May is major supporting character in the film just as she is in the comic book.  There were always two women in Peter Parker's life and the one constant was always Aunt May.
I applaud the decision to make Otto Octavius a good man for once who becomes the victim of his own brilliance.  His scientific discussions with Peter in their first meeting not only show his decency but also reveal to our hero the path he can take if he pursues science rather than crime fighting.  After all, Otto is married to the lovely Rosalie (Donna Murphy), who is clearly the doctor's own MJ.  Eventually Peter comes to the realization that he does not have to be Spider-Man.
I have some ambivalence about what is happening with Mary Jane, mainly because one of my favorite scenes in the comic book was when she finally confessed to a stunned Peter that she knew he was Spider-Man and could no longer stand the fear that he was going to get killed.  But I appreciate the idea that Mary Jane gets to be there from the beginning in the movies (as she is in Marvel's ""Ultimate Spider-Man"") and that Hollywood does not have time to go through Betty Brant and Gwen Stacy to get to Mary Jane Watson Parker and the final shot of Mary Jane in the film certainly gives weight to her character and reinforces again the idea that this time they got everything right.",1088553600,106,5480,4.505549949545913
1505263,1,B00005JMQW,"I am a 21 year old male. Now that I have put myself in a marketing demograph situtation I will explain why Spider Man 2 LITTERALLY made me wish I had an uncontrolable sleeping disorder and I would knocked out cold for the next 2 hours and 10 minutes. Now I believe in having points, while not giving away the movie. Here it is...
*Drama, Drama, Drama
I saw ""The Notebook"" sneak preview, and I kid you not; Spider Man 2 is more dramatic. Except the notebook had creditable ""tear jerker"" situations. Spider Man 2 shoved down our throats 4 things, over and over again like a pep talk for indiviuals who want to commit suiside.
1. Be true to yourself, even when everyone else hates you
2. Life sucks..ALOT! There's nothing you can do but love another
3. It's ok to have un-needed 10 minute outta-no-where pep talks about being a ""hero"" from your nieve aunt
4. This 127 minute movie shoves all these ""life growing"" experience moments down your throat for a good 100 of the 129 minutes in this so-called movie.
Action... for lack of
The movie is dead for alittle over an hour, and that includes not even closely funny moments to keep us awake or off our cell phones (I would like thank my bestfriend Alexis for that one, she saved me). Dr. Oct and Spidey have good fights, not great, but not bad. With each ""battle"" scene 30 minutes apart for some more ""heart felt"" affectional pep-talks, as Peter looks like he's having a nervous breakdown cuz everything in his life just sucks. The final battle scene was not as good as the original. I love it when the hero gets his [back] kicked! Why not? Spidey uses.... a pep talk to ""save the day"" I guess you would say. Figures.
*CGI aka Computer (or I'd say Crappy) Generated Images
Downgrade! Probably to save money because Tobey wanted some more $$$ this time around for the squel. No seriously, this is a downgrade on CGI's. The original Matrix has twice the realness of Spider Man 2 and that movie was released in 1999.
*Compare to Spider Man Uno or basically anything else
This movie lagged, it's stupidly corny when we get a 3 minute song and freeze frame of peter parker and a happy life. Totally different feel, totally different direction than the first movie. It's not worth the price of ticket (esp. these days), infact the price for the gas that would spend to drive to the movies, is not worth seeing this movie.",1088553600,7,2361,4.4802784222737815
1505264,5,B00005JMQW,"The second film in the Spider-Man series is the most physically and emotionally realistic, as well as mythically and philosophically relevant, American super-hero film to date. Philosophically, it is an entry point into post-existential  America, intelligently but simply emphasizing the idea of the individual and the importance of conscious choices in the shaping of world around him or her. Emotionally, we see in Peter Parker an intelligent but otherwise normal man who often says and does stupid things, and we see a realistic emotional evolution of the man.  Parker isn't a simple character, and he has intrinsic faults and conflicts. Most people can relate to this on a very personal leverl. We also see an intense interconncted, um, web of relationships between every character in the film, and not some typical action merde of the invulnerable leader/hero that is about five, six hundred years dead now but still ridiculously prevalent in films and novels. I speak of those beautiful near perfect ideals of manhood who perform acts of heroism and maintain ideal personal relationships, in other words doing things which are impossible to acheive even in our fantasies, and yet we see portrayed more than often in our culture's stories. On the mythic level (and this, of course, originates from the original comic book level concept), this film puts forth a new Hero prototype that has not yet been seen and will not perhaps be fully appreciated for many years to come. A film like this, and I cannot namer another like it, deftly reshapes the modern concept of what a hero is, and the production does it with a wonderful sense of humor and professional sangfroid. And, hey, it has some of the most kick-arse fight scenes ever put to film.",1088553600,,1747,4.97945205479452
1505293,5,B00005JMQW,"Rarely would I give a movie a five star review.  Actually, this is my first.  Take it from me, the critics do not lie.  Spiderman 2 is an amazing achievement.  It is, in fact, as good, or better than the first.
We pick up where we left off in the first film.  Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is battling his double duties as Spiderman and Peter Parker.  Still, at the same time, he is trying to cope with his love for the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  This would be the focus point of Spiderman 2.
Peter's love for Mary Jane begins to take effect on his superhero obligations.  Back and forth, he begins to question his identity, feelings, and the everyday worries of job security, paying rent, etc.  All of his doubts, fears, and problems seem to revolve around, yes, Mary Jane.  He starts to lose focus as Spiderman and finds himself not able to use all of his gifts properly.  It eventually comes to the point where he decides it is time to give up being Spiderman in order to be able to be with the love of his life.
Mary Jane is not the only returning member.  Peter's best friend Harry (James Franco) is back.  Harry still longs to avenge his father's death by killing Spiderman.  Here, Harry has turned darker by really obsessing with his nemesis and trying to drink his problems away.  Another reason for this is because of his failed attempt at phenomenal success with his genius scientis Dr. Octavious (Alfred Molina).  Octavious' fusion experiment fails, but at the same time transfoms him into the villain Dr. Octopus, a man with four addtional limbs.  He later makes a deal with Harry in order to recreate an attempt at his fusion device.  This deal invloves bringing Spiderman to Harry so that he can finally seal the deal with his father's death.
Doc Ock, as later called, and Spiderman encounter each other on numerous occassions.  The fight sequences are enjoyable to watch.  Although, I did not feel they were as good as Spiderman vs the Green Goblin, they are worth seeing.  Especially in stages where they are fighting while climbing skyscrapers.  There is also one action sequence on a train, which is probably the main battle.  It is really great to see on the big screen.
There is also a break in the action.  As mentioned, Parker decides to give up his supehero identity.  We see shots of him going to school, being relaxed, eating ice cream, and so on.  However, all of this changes as soon as Mary Jane gets captured by Dr. Octopus.  This leads to the train fight mentioned above.
In the end, Spidey and Dr. Octopus duke it out one last time and the girl is saved.  However, we later learn about a new possible villain for the next movie as Harry finds his father's secret hiding place that is complete with Green Goblin artifacts.
Spiderman 2 is a really good movie.  One that is definitely worthy of the title ""summer blockbuster.""  Yet, the film is not about action.  Here, the story evolves around something much bigger.  In the first Spiderman, we caught a glimpse of the inner struggles of Peter Parker, here the come out in full force.  Watching the character grow, mature, and handle his problems makes the movie better.  Every superhero has a weakness.  That weakness can also equal strength.  Peter Parker finds that balance in this movie, and he is ready to swing back to theatres in 2007.",1088553600,3,3348,4.586846543001687

Lets also praise him for making a sequel that is a true triumph over the original. Spider-Man 2 is a terrific film. Yes it was good, and the reason I gave it only 4 stars was because the end battle scene was a bit too campy and invoked too much science-fiction fantasy. The rest, however, was excellent. The drama and script were much better, the acting was much better, the romance between Peter and MJ was both quirkier and more complex at the same time, and the early action scenes between Doc Ock and Spidey far surpass the action sequences of the first film. In this film, the drama is just as prominent as the battles, and believe me, the battles are very cool and well done. Hollywood may just be wising up on what factors strengthen the quality of sequels.",1088553600,,907,4.437125748502994
1505298,5,B00005JMQW,"Spiderman 2 I think is the best movie based on a comic that I've seen. It's one of the best sequels ever made as well.  The script is very well done with a ton of character build-up. Peter Parker loses his web slinging abilities and has to figure out how to get them back or maybe he doesn't even want them back. Him being too busy fighting crime is losing him jobs and also  Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst)  the women he loves. Fearing that she'd get hurt if she was part of his life is keeping him from letting her in. So she gives up on waiting for Peter and starts dating a hot shot astronaut. Harry Osborne  (James Franco), still blames Spidey for the death of his father and swears that he will get revenge. He's so obsessed with it that it's ruining his friendship with Peter. Since he thinks Peter knows who Spiderman is and is mad that he won't tell him.
  Harry's also using a brilliant scientist in Doctor Octavius (Alfred Molina) to try and invent something huge to get his father's business running once again. The invention fails and leaves Doctor Octavius with metal tentacles stuck to his spine. He's not a bad man but with the chip broken that let him control the tentacles, they now control him. He wants to continue his project but needs Harry's help but first Harry wants him to capture Spiderman for him.
  The result is a well put together movie full of so much that it feels like 3 hours and not just 2 hours and 7 minutes. There's a lot of dialogue and it can be slow but the action scenes are off the chart when there is action. It focuses more on the character Spiderman and the people in his life. May sound boring but when it all comes together at the end it's very satisfying. Plus it's more romantic than the first and Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have even better chemestry this time around. Spiderman 2 is no doubt the best movie of the summer and I doubt anything coming out can compare to it.",1088553600,,1923,4.322222222222222
1505299,5,B00005JMQW,"The first Spider-Man was okay, but part 2 is what the first one should have been in terms of pacing, story, acting, and of course the much improved SFX. This movie is much talkier and focuses in on the drama a lot more than the action. Some of the smaller children in the theater were getting restless for pretty much the whole film due to the little amount of physical action happening on the screen. Don't get me wrong there are some great action scenes, but they are spread thinly throughout this two hour plus film. Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus is great in terms of acting and is way cooler looking than that stupid Green Goblin outfit from the first film. Doc Ock is truly a memorable villian. Tobey and Kirsten are very good as well, but J.K. Simmons once again steal the show as the newspaper boss and thankfully gets a much bigger role in this movie. I also loved the opening credit sequence that fills you in on Spider-Man part one and the almost horror movie style done when Doc Ock is killing about 10 doctors with his tentacles while escaping from the hospital. The ending with Harry finding his father's glider and weapons was really pretty neat, but I just hope Spider-Man 3 has another villian to go with the not so interesting James Franco as the new Green Goblin. Bring on Venom in the next Spidey flick! While this comic book franchise can't compare to the first two Batman or Superman films, it sits nicely in third place behind them.

1505300,4,B00005JMQW,"Ok folks, I saw the premiere last night in Grapevine, TX at the 12:01am showing of this movie on opening day, June 30, 2004. I was NOT disappointed.
Spiderman is one of the all-time great superheroes, telling an under-dog story that reveals the American theme and dream. This story is a great addition to the movie genre and Spiderman folklore alike.
The thing I like most about this movie is that it follows the TRUE story line of the comic. Yes, there are a few minor details they changed for updated features since it is now 2004 and not in the mid-20th century when Spiderman was born, but overall the story unfolds the same way it did in the comic. In my opinion, this is why it is so successful.
I do not like when story lines are changed from the original. This robs the original plot and details and takes away the thing that has made the story great...its truth. Spiderman would not have stood the test of time if the original story hadn't been any good. It was good, and that is why it is still around today. And this movie does a great job of keeping that story alive.
I won't tell you about the plot of happenings of this movie. If you saw the first one, go and see this one. You won't be disappointed. The only disappointing thing for me is if they limit this to a Trilogy.
Spiderman movie guys....Mr. Stan Lee and Ang Lee...may a make a suggestion? Keep Spiderman true. Don't be like the last Batman movie, changing the Dark Knight into the ""'60's TV show-Batman and Robin-Public Servant"". If you do this, you could make 10 Spiderman movies and they will all be well received.

Films have exploited these superheroes as a means to put CGI into good use. ""Spider-Man"" felt like one of those. It was bland and dry and the characters skimmed on the surface of shallow. Now comes ""Spider-Man 2,"" where director Sam Raimi has focused on the internal labor and strain of Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) that makes superheroes like Spiderman more complicated and in-depth. Torn between this gift and curse of having supernatural abilities with his personal agendas of wants and needs, Peter Parker is the epitome of what it takes to be a superhero, and ""Spider-Man 2"" is what comic-book movie should be.
Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco are the key to the emotional success of these stories. Maguire has become so good in this role that is more than just an action-movie role. We get a full scope of Maguire's ability to make Spider-Man a well-rounded character instead of a two-dimensional cartoon character. Dunst, although still in her teens, is a veteran actress that has added layers to Mary Jane. Particularly the one where she has her fianc lie back on the couch so she can recreate that famous kiss with Spider-Man convinced me that Dunst has done a lot with her character. Franco is just as productive and even chilling because we begin to notice the menacing attributes that will eventually make him Spider-Man's next nemesis.

1505359,3,B00005JMQW,"Spider-Man 2 proves to be a very entertaining movie. The movie takes off basically from where it left on the first movie. I think the plot suffered because there really isn't a real story here. All the main characters and even the minor ones appears to be very confused about themselves. Peter Parker played by Toby Maguire proves to such a loser in civilian life, it almost pathetic. Peter Parker spent much of this movie confused about whether he wants to be Spider-Man or not. I supposes that is why he make such a good Spiderman. Kristen Dunst plays Mary Ann Watson proves to be beautiful but she's confused throughout the movie on whether she loves Peter or the other guy. James Franco who played Harry Osborn still regards Peter as his best buddy but regards him with hostility because he thinks Peter is buddy with Spider-Man. This character is totally twisted all over. Alfred Molina who played the main villian, Dr. Octopus, is pretty good. But he too, like the other characters, remains confused on whether he wants to be good or bad.  Even Jonah Jameson goes from anti-Spider-Man to pro-Spider-Man and back again. The entire movie appears to be populated with very confused characters.
What works is the special effects, action scenes and interaction between our confused characters. For a guy who likes to keep his secret identity secret, Toby Maguire's character spent a lot of time wearing that costume without his mask on. Why cheapen the character by showing us the actor's face all the time?? (Does Sam Raimi believed that Toby Maguire is so handsome that his face deserves more exposure??) But its a motion picture comic book, so everything work out in the end and as long as you don't think too hard about the movie, it should be quite enjoyable for everyone.",1088553600,3,1778,4.7727272727272725
1505360,5,B00005JMQW,"Watched it on 30th June 2004 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. I guess we in the UAE were lucky to watch it along with American cinemagoers, and rather not druel over and wait impatiently for it for a month or so. Tobey Maguire is the true Hero Spiderman. All audiences who will or have watched Spiderman II would say that no other actor can star better than Tobey Maguire. Though I may have thought like others that Raimi made a bad choice in choosing Tobey in Spiderman I, but he really did shine up the role in II. Spiderman is actually written on all over his face. I hope Sam Raimi offers him the role of Peter P/Spiderman in Part III despite his bad back. Cinemagoers will notice a 90 degrees clockwise S scar on his right cheek. Alot of Character development was done on the role of peter in preparation of Part III. Part III will be more of a ultimate showdown.
As far as the movie is concerned, it was better than Part I. This time we see more of Peter Parker and his issues with life (his superhero role of Spiderman, college education and MJ, the love of his life). There are some choices that he has got to make. There is also a very special HERO other than spiderman in the movie, I won't mention who. The Spiderman II xperience was very entertaining.
I do really love the Train sequence. It does reflect courage as a whole and does have strains of patriotism, self esteem and respect of ones courage. Whoever watched it would certainly agree with me.",1088553600,,1466,4.373626373626373
1505361,5,B00005JMQW,"Spiderman 2 has some of the highest expectations to ever be placed on a movie. Spiderman grossed $403 million dollars and is the fifth most successful movie in U.S. history. Spiderman 2 could shatter that number.
Spiderman 2 picks up right where Spiderman left us. Peter Parker(Maguire) is a struggling college student. His grades are slipping and so are his friendships with his best friends Mary Jane(Dunst) and Harry(Franco). His Aunt May(Harris) is worried sick about him. His duties as Spiderman are keeping him so busy he's starting to fall apart. He has a huge assignment due in school about a famous scientist and Harry happens to know the guy so he gives him the hook up.
Harry is now in charge of special operations at Osbourne Industries. Dr. Otto Octavius(Molina) is a world famous scientist who has ideas on how fusion will save the world. He's created four mechanical arms he wears that help him do the work. An accident happens though that causes the arms to fuse to the Dr and he goes on the rampage because the A.I. from the arms consume him. He is determined to make his fusion work and will stop at nothing to do it.
Peter is a little devestated by the accident. He enjoyed meeting Octavius but is saddened by the experience. His life is also getting very hard on him. He finds out Mary Jane is engaged and is so mad with him that she wants almost nothing to do with him. Harry is so obsessed with killing Spiderman because he blames him for his dads death. He's angry at Peter and wants him to give him info on Spiderman. Peter can't take it anymore so he gives up as the web slinger.
Peter is happy with his new life. His grades are improving, but his relationship with MJ isn't going the way he wanted. Doc Ock is still on the loose and must be stopped. Will the web slinger give up his new found happy life and stop Doc Ock or will he keep his new found happines. This is the movie that is Spiderman 2.
This movie destroys the first one. It's much more entertaing than the first. It doesn't drag like the first one did, because so many new character aren't introduced. The movie is quite humerous in places and it is obvious that Raimi is more comfortable with the character. Raimi's comedic charm is evident all over the film and he takes the story and runs with it.
An excellent story has been given to us. The Smallville creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar contribute to it. The screenplay is from Alvin Sargent who has written a comic masterpiece. The writers did a fantastic job with the story.
Tobey McGuire is excellent as Spiderman. He is perfectly cast as Peter Parker. He seems more comfortable with the role and he shines. Kirsten Dunst is hot as Mary Jane. Like everybody else it's obvious she is more comfortable with the role and it's a bigger one for her this time around. Molina as Doc Ock is perfect. A awesome cast was done with this movie and the makers really need to be complimented on the good job.
This movie is awesome. It's the most entertaining movie of 2004. It's easily the best comic book movie ever. Spiderman has always had a more humble human trait that so many other comic heros don't have. It's not so much about his powers and abilites, but how much he sacrifices to make the world a beter place. He puts other people above himself and he does so for the right reasons. With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility and that's why we love Spiderman.
You have to see this movie. This is what a comic movie should be. It's the best movie to this date of 2004 and is family fun entertainment. You can't call yourself a Spiderman fan and not see it. Go see it and be prepared for a great time.",1088553600,37,3648,4.4381520119225035

Just because i said the character development is deep does not mean that there is a lack of action here. The action is amazing. The special effects are quite literally breath-taking.

1505365,5,B00005JMQW,"""I need to know, do you love me?"" a timid, temperate Mary Jane asks Peter Parker, as they sit in a cafe, almost ready to be barraged by the villainous Doctor Octopus. In such a pivotal sequence, we can see the troubles of two characters, two dynamic characters...these are rare. You almost feel for them, as if their troubles are yours.
But isn't that always what Spider-man was meant to be? The one we all associate with? The imperfect hero? Come on, everyone knows it. I, for one, have never associated more perfectly with a character, well maybe Lloyd Dobbler(Say Anything), but nah, Peter Parker indefinitely; a reason why I'm so attached to the Spider-man story and a reason why I call myself such a Spiderman fan. So, tonight, when I was able to finally watch Spider-man 2, the hype came down to this, a 2 hour and 7 minute masterpiece.
Masterpiece is an understatement. When you walk out of a film and have chills and the urge to walk right back in and press...restart, well, that says something. 'Spiderman 2' has just that. I could easily call this the greatest superhero film of all time, but I'd be wrong. It's a wonderful addition to the greatest superhero saga of all time. Each section, like the original and now the predecessors, are brilliant.
Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco are the company behind this...they are the recurring ones. I'd even say J.K. Simmons, who shines so even better in this new installment. I've never seen a combination of great casting since maybe Back to the Future or Indiana Jones. When we look back, these films are going to be up there in the memorable favorites/classics, and it's primarily because of this working team. Maguire is Parker, Dunst is MJ. Simple, I can only wait to see where they go with their characters next, as it seems Maguire has the Parker bit down to a knot. Watch the finale and see the gel here, it's nothing short of perfect.
And where would these characters go without some clever writing? Taking time and making sure everything is well, is well, what makes this, THIS. The dialogue is ingenious and it wraps full circle, not a tag back, but a lesson you are told, and then acknowledged and learned by the time you pass the movie vendor, again. I'm still looking back at all the things said and done, and where are the actors' roads, without them being paved? The writers do an exceptional job here, paving highways to accessible storylines, where we are given hints, but all mere speculation, although, there is one big hint. Spare, no expense.
Sensational and overwhelming, every time I watch these films, it's just that. I think of that which means most, it's all association, its' all what makes these prolific. If I watch a film about titanium androids killing and then doing nothing but killing, I'll be bored. Well, if James Cameron's there, maybe not, but point being, there needs to be substance. This film, just like the original, has it. I turned, I kicked the seat, I squirmed, and it was all because of that. The film gets you, and doesn't let you go!
Immediately after watching the film, I phoned my girlfriend. Having known how much my life parallels certain aspects of the Spider-man aura, I told her how much I loved her and how I couldn't wait to see her again. She means a lot to me, everything in the world, I knew this already, and she knew this. But, knowledge can only be attained when reminded...and this is exactly what happened.
Go see it? Well, let's just say, of course.
Best film of the year, as far as I'm concerned, and yes, it may be a ""superhero"" film, but it's indefinitely more than that.
***** out of *****

1505422,3,B00005JMQW,"Spider-Man swings back into theaters today with webs-a-blazin' but he might need a shrink.
I recommend this film...but there is a LOT to take in here. While that isn't a bad thing, there's a lot of heavy-handedness here and some could argue that it pads out the film.
Yes, we all know Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a depressed young man. He only has time for one life and Spider-Man takes up most of it, leaving him exhausted. This point isn't hammered into your skull, it's DRILLED past your skull, into your brain and out your eyeballs and makes the movie feel longer than it is. By the time we get through half a barrel of celluloid molasses (including an excruciatingly syrupy sequence where Peter Parker struts around to Burt Bacharach's ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head""...no, I'm not kidding) and Parker FINALLY dons the Spider-Man costume again, the movie kicks into high gear.
Peter loves Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) but he can't tell her that because he's afraid that his ""enemies will find out who he really is"" and kill her. She loves HIM but can't figure him out because he can't tell her why he doesn't love her. Why Peter keeps tearing his mask off then in front of Doc Ock/ordinary citizens riding a train/Mary Jane/etc. is anybody?s guess, since he?s so protective of his identity. He?s even unmasked by Harry Osborne! After all the unmasking, it's a wonder that a) half of New York doesn't know who Spider-Man is, b) Mary Jane isn't cannon-fodder, or c) Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) isn't swimming with the fishes. Speaking of Harry Osborne, (played thanklessly by James Franco) he's busy trying to put his late father's company ""OsCorp"" back on the map with a new invention that will ""power the world for free""...if you create fusion from a ball of ""tritium""...and then power it up by shooting at it with lasers...and then use giant mechanical arms welded into your spine to handle the growing and dangerous ball of power...so dangerous, that it sucks everything metal...into...it's path...and...oh, nevermind.
It?s a comic book! Don?t worry, just enjoy!
Suffice to say, the villain this time is Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) AKA ""Dr. Octopus""(named thus by ""J. Jonah Jameson"" played by the talented J.K. Simmons, who almost steals the entire show like it was money). Octavius's character comes off as very smart and intelligent but his attitude and character do a complete turnaround when his ""arms"" malfunction after an accident...
Here's where it gets murky.
There is a ""control chip"" on the top of the spine which prevents the arms from going ""evil"". In the last film, they altered the Green Goblin's outfit terribly, making him look like a reject from the ""Ultraman"" series and here, they alter the idea behind Doc Ock: If Octavius crushes the chip, the arms control him and he becomes evil. If he goes mad, he still controls the arms, but uses them for evil. What scientist in their right mind created ""evil arms"" with a fragile ""control chip"" that could be so easily destroyed? But, again, this is a comic book, so forget that. Instead, let's focus on Doc Ock's ""evil plans"": he doesn't want revenge for the accident/his wife's death/etc. at all. Instead, he wants to continue his experiment at all costs(!). Why? I don't know. If you have total power, are now a murderer, and have the means to get more power, why would you still want to be a good guy? Keep in mind, this is never fully explained.
One of the most awkward parts of the film is when Spider-Man pleads with Doc Ock ""not to listen to his tentacles"" which induced unintentional snickers and laughter in the theater. Alfred Molina, a British actor, playing a German villain with an American accent, plays a fine Doc Ock but seems just slightly underdone through no fault of his own.
This doesn?t make the film bad! The battles between Spider-Man and Doc Ock are INCREDIBLE(the bank and train sequences are BRILLIANT, as if choreographed straight from the comic books) and the visual effects look incredibly lifelike...but the final battle is anti-climatic and the script and overall direction have some problems. David Koepp (writer of ""Mission: Impossible"" & ""Jurassic Park"") wrote the last film and he is SORELY missed. This one is by Alvin Seargeant (?Unfaithful?), one of four writers and, at times, it feels like it?s been handled too much. Spider-Man isn't even close to being the smart-alec he is in the comic book. With the exception of ""Here's your change"" while catching and throwing a bag of cash at Doc Ock, Spider-Man's lines consist of lines like, ""NO!"", ""You have to stop!"", ""Look out"", and the ever-famous, ""Whoo-hoo"" as he goes whipping through the air.
I see a LOT of potential for this series, but hopefully all of the characters will have grown up because, at times, it's like watching reruns of ""Felicity"" with latex-clad super-beings flying around. Sam Raimi is an incredibly gifted director. His contributions to the fantasy/horror genre are fantastic, but, at times, I feel like he's just building a rushed and  uneven bridge to the inevitable finish. I often wondered what the film would look like with more screen-time. And this series WILL finish. ?Spider-Man 3? is teased in a sequence with a surprise cameo by Willem Dafoe who played The Green Goblin in the last film.
So, how good is this movie? It?s a solid comic book film. As far as movies go this summer, ""The Terminal"" is still the best next to ""Fahrenheit 9/11"". As comic-book films go, this stands somewhere below ""Superman"", its sequel, ""Blade"", ""Hulk"" and the fantastic ""X2: X-Men United"" and right next to contenders like it's predecessor, ""Daredevil"", and the first ""X-Men"" film.
This Spider has yet to become a Man, but, then again, the story has yet to finish.

1505426,4,B00005JMQW,"(...)Spiderman 2 is pretty good - it's darker and edgier than the first.  It's not as much fun and doesn't go anywhere new in filmmaking, but does address some important issues, as the first one did.  I saw it at a recording of MTV's ""Moviehouse"" here in LA on the 14th.
Alfred Molina does a good job with Dr. Octopus, but didn't really seem like that much of a bad guy, especially with the plot addition of giving his tentacles their own intelligence.  Maybe they did that on purpose, but it's harder to get into a movie where the bad guy is generally likeable.  The other bad guy set up scenes were pretty good, too - we meet the Professor that probably becomes the Lizard later on in the franchise, and there's an absolutely fabulous scene where Harry discovers his dad's Green Goblin laboratory.  We even got to see slightly more of the girl who becomes the Black Cat.  Still no Venom, though.
The plot drags some, but not that bad.  MaGuire does a good job of demonstrating angst, and Dunst makes MJ stronger than she was in the first one.  I wish that they would have explained why he was having the problems that he did as Spiderman, and how the problem was fixed, though.
A movie with the taglines ""Choice"" and ""Sacrifice"" isn't bound to be very happy or fun.  But it's a good way to spend a couple of hours, and makes some good points.  The main thing I loved about it was the deemphasis on material wealth, and the idea of doing what needs to be done.  Things will work out, Sam Raimi says.

Simply by looking at the preview for Spider-Man 2 (contained in the Big Fish DVD) you will know this. Unlike many big budget, special-effects-dense movies the characters are not a backdrop to the effects. The characters will be the reason that people will stand in long lines to see this movie. If you ever read the Spider-Man comic book series you would know that Toby Maguire's portrayal of Peter Parker is a perfect fit and powerful. Kristen Dunst is the real Mary Jane and somehow I feel she is even better than the character developed in the comic book series.
When I see a movie I want to remember the characters and identify with them. If you identify with the characters then you identify with the plot. That is the main ingredient in making a movie successful and destined for glory. That is where Spider-Man 2 is heading.

Anyways, I saw a trailer for Spider Man 2 before it came on and judging from what I saw, this will be hands down the greatest movie of the summer and I think it will shoot up to the money mark the first one made perhaps even more so. The original key players return excluding the dead ones (i.e. Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin) with a few new ones like Alfred Molina's Dr. Otto Octavius or better known to comic book fans as Doc Ock. Like the first, it will sport good CGI battle sequences and pyrotechnics. But I hope that Molina can pull his character off. He looked like a good candidate for Ock in the trailer, but it's like the lesson I learned last summer. Hulk had a great trailer that made me green with anticipation but when I saw it, it was one of the worst superhero films of all time. It ranked with Batman and Robin and I have an undying hatred for that crapfest. But I hope that Spidey 2 can pull the  tricks that made the original so good.

If you have read that novel, you know what extraordinary ideas he has for comic book stories.  There is a very, very good chance that he can elevate SPIDERMAN II to a good space.

1505462,5,B00005JMQW,"2002 and saw the cinematic creation of Spider-man to the silver screen and boy was i empressed with Sam Raimi's directing and David Koepps screenplay with enough action  and humor to keep cinema goers happy, an intelligent script, powerfull acting and classful diecting to keep film buffs pleaased and of course a respectful adaptation to impress the comic book fans.
I was so happy with the film that I saw it five times at the cinema and countless times of DvD.  Today I watched (of course countless times already) the teaser trailer for SPIDER-MAN 2. I can't express how impressed I was with the visual and audio presentaion of this sneak preview for what looks like a corker of a movie. Roll on theatrical trailers and of course July 2002.",1071446400,,743,4.707692307692308
1505463,5,B00005JMQW,"oh yeah. Comic book super hero movie. 1960s classic. THIS IS GONNA ROCK, BABY!!!  ahem.  So anyway, I totally think this will rule the theatre. The prequel was,is, really cool. So, as the story picks up, this movie will be cool.
  Also, with the Punisher, another Marvel hero classic who also rocks, movie, there will be a hard competition. Hang in there, Spidey!",1070409600,,363,4.714285714285714

7940077,5,B00005JMQW,"The single best super hero movie ever made, largely because the story is perfectly structured and derives its plot largely from the actual Spider-Man comics. The only beef I have is that they skipped over Gwen Stacy entirely and MJ isn't true to her swaggering alpha female personality from the comics. Every other character is spot on. James Jonah Jameson is perfection.",1524355200,,371,5.0
7940078,4,B00005JMQW,"This was the best of the Spider-Man trilogy and probably one of the best superhero films of all time. Tobey Maguire follows up his excellent performance from the first movie into this one following the ""Spider-Man No More"" storyline from the comics. Rosemary Harris is Aunt May. She has a great speech towards the end about what makes a hero that is a standout in this film. Alfred Molina as Doc Ock is awesome. He goes from brilliant scientist to arch-criminal seamlessly. The tentacle effects also are a stand out as an entirely different character in this film. I'll walk this whenever it is on.",1523836800,,598,4.704761904761905

7940084,3,B00005JMQW,This is a pretty good sequel.  Maybe just as good as the firs Spiderman.  Tobey MacGuire and Kirsten Dunst both came back and are just as good.  Most of the cast from the first movie like Cliff Robertson came back for this one.  And Doc Ock as the villain is better in this.,1520467200,,274,4.113207547169812
