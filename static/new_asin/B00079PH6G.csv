I found it because I bought the film about the teenage years and decided to check this out too. Like the other movie, this one brings up commong challenging situations between children and their parents and explains how to overcome them and help kids become better people. The most important film in this collection is the one that explains how to teach children to tell the truth and shows exactly why lying is a bad thing. It's a good life lesson. These films are centered at a younger audience than the teenage years films but still are a practical guide to dealing with kids.",1148428800,,730,4.623076923076923
