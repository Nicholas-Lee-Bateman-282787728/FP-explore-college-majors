8618413,4,B00FRWI01C,"Raw movie that features a mysogynist sociopath man in his late forties that's looking for fame in the serial killer game. Yeah it's got a ton of flaws but it makes up for them in numerous ways. This is a must watch horror movie from 2013.

He drones on with these first person narrative philosophical ramblings and pontificates on the art of killing people. Which is probably a fairly accurate peek inside the mind of a seriously disturbed, delusional, narcissistic, misanthropic and perverted lunatic. Creepy music and a creepy dude make for one creepy movie. Its so revolting it almost makes me a misanthrope myself.

I dint understand why he liked her because she was such a bitch. Minor things because as a whole i really enjoyed this.",1412380800,,313,4.508771929824562
