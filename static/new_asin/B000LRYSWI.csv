8325374,5,B000LRYSWI,"Just had the privilege of doing an ashtanga class with Nancy Gilgoff last nite so I am watching this DVD before trying it.  Having taken ashtanga and iyengar influenced vinyasa classes for a little over a year this class looks very challenging and exciting.  As this is an intermediate/advanced class she does not mention too many modifications but if you have been taking classes from good teachers for a while you can figure out how to change the poses to suit you.

The disc appears to be a 'professionally burned' DVD with purple data side and no encryption, for those of you whom that makes sense.",1205539200,,602,4.660377358490566
8325375,5,B000LRYSWI,"I have been practicing power yoga about 5-6 times a week, at home, for about a year and a half. I have about 15 Power Yoga DVD's and had another 5 that I resold because I didn't like them. There are some that I like a lot for e.g. Brian Kest, Power Yoga for Happiness by Eoin Finn, Brian Baptiste, and others that are quite good as well, but I was never driven to write a review until I used this DVD. This is not for beginners. I would say it's at an Intermediate-Advanced level. This does not have a lot of Zen meditation stuff, just a few Ohm's at the beginning and is not as visually stunning as some other ones, but it is a fast-paced, comprehensive workout that leaves you invigorated, yet relaxed at the end. It feels like being in a real class with real people, not models, which I find the most motivating. The instructor's voice is pleasant, and she does not talk incessantly and make corny jokes. The routine has a good warmup, then almost every pose that I've seen on other dvd's and a nice relaxation at the end. She also includes a few poses that I haven't seen anywhere else and her sequencing and timing are quite good. If, like me, you like a sweat-producing but satisfying solid power yoga workout, I strongly recommend this dvd.",1200009600,4,1247,4.356223175965665
8325376,5,B000LRYSWI,This DVD is a great workout and also helps you let go of the stuff in your head that's stressing you out!  The Baptiste flow that is taught in this DVD works your entire body and feels great!  Get ready to sweat!,1166486400,2,212,4.023809523809524
8325377,5,B000LRYSWI,"This is a nice 75 min class led by Debbie Williamson, a certified Baptiste Power Vinyasa yoga instructor.  The class is challenging but can be modified down or amplified up to fit all skill levels.  You can learn a lot just watching the class.  Later, you can progress to doing the class along with the DVD.  When you no longer need to watch the DVD to get through the class you can practice along with the audio.  This is possible because there are such detailed verbal cues.",1166486400,4,476,4.425287356321839
