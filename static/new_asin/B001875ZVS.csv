3412112,5,B001875ZVS,"Come along and join an intrepid band of role playing gamers on a fantasy quest to save the fair maiden from the grasp of their mortal enemy, the Shadow. Your brave companions on this perilous journey will be: Mark the Red, Rogar (Barbarian), Nimble (Master Thief), Newmoon (Elven Archer) and Ambrose (Apprenice Mage). The trials and tribulations that lie ahead as revealed by the Game Master can only be overcome by careful deliberation and a favorable roll of the dice. Sounds like the perfect Friday nights entertainment doesn't it? Well, it is for these guys.

To be sure, 'The Gamers' is an amateur film comprised of amateur actors. In fact the cast is most likely comprised of real gamers playing themselves. Despite the lack of professional know how this film really works and is lots of fun for fantasy game players or those who just want to see a humorous depiction of what role playing is all about.

How do you rate a movie such as this? Well the usual rules don't apply. I judge it by it's uniqueness and wonderful nerd factor which in this particular case is a good thing!",1257033600,14,1084,4.640625
3412113,3,B001875ZVS,"Dead Gentlemen Productions started life as a bunch of friends goofing around and making zero-budget movies for their own amusement. However, after the success of their first project, Demon Hunters, in 1999 they got slightly more ambitious for their second, The Gamers, which was released in 2002. The Gamers gained a sort-of sequel, Dorkness Rising, released last year, which was a quantum leap forward in quality.

Both films are based around fantasy roleplaying games and use the device of where we see the same actors sitting around the table and then acting out the actions of their characters in the game world. The Gamers has the players sent on a quest to dispatch their recurring nemesis, the Shadow, who has captured the Princess of the kingdom. As the party's adventure continues, more and more roleplaying tropes are explored: one member of the party accidentally killing another, the replacement character simply joining the party without any in-story explanation, another player not present due to having a girlfriend resulting in his character erratically appearing and disappearing and so on. There are some exceptionally funny moments here, such as the dangers unleashed when the game designers fail to specify what weapons can and cannot be used for sneak attacks, and the intelligent use of a wizard spell to maximise the enemy's vulnerabilities to another player's special weapon. There's also an ongoing subplot in which the neighbour trying to revise for an exam constantly interrupts the group to complain about the noise. Events culminate in the final showdown and a twist ending.

The Gamers (***) is fun. It was made with limited resources and many of the key roles are not filled by actors but clearly the production team and their friends. This actually adds to the amateurish charm of the film. The writing, directing and editing are strong, especially given the team's budgetary constraints, and anyone who's played a tabletop roleplaying game will recognise a lot of the ideas used in the piece. Overall, a funny and entertaining 45-minute film.",1237852800,24,2075,5.154302670623146
3412134,5,B001875ZVS,"I do not write many reviews so i will keep this simple. If you were ever a fan of D&D or any other Tabletop gaming, the Gamers is a hysterical laughfest from start to finish. If you are familiar with gaming or have gaming friends and understand the ""lifestyle"" you will enjoy this movie. The sequel is even better!",1401408000,4,314,4.338983050847458
3412135,4,B001875ZVS,"If you ever played any table top RPG.  This is a must watch, I laughed just remembering this was how we use to play back in the day.  The ending is a little strange and you can tell its low budget but it was money well spent.",1393891200,6,225,3.765957446808511
3412136,5,B001875ZVS,This was a great start to what has been a great series.  I can't wait to see what they come up with next.,1379980800,,105,3.5652173913043477
3412137,5,B001875ZVS,"This movie is a delightful under-the-radar film highlighting a few real-life and mostly fantasy-life problems of a group of college Dungeons & Dragons players. Admittedly, the low budget shows through in the ""special effects"" and a few of the featured talents, but the writing is entertaining for those who have some inkling of the nerd culture it embodies. I have been a fan of the movie and the production company for years, and this movie contains some of the most-quoted material my friends and I verbalize. Not for those with a low tolerance of production/acting quality, but highly recommended for all types of nerds and geeks!",1379116800,,633,4.981132075471698
3412138,3,B001875ZVS,"As stated; I and other RPGers will enjoy this flick and am happy others told me to avoid the other movie that is a knock off of this one called ""Gamers"".  Simply put, this DVD throws at us many items that anyone who has RPGed D&D can relate to.  The person who does not show up to game and we have to drag his or her character along so they do not miss out when they finally DO show up.  The bar room antics to include the typical pocket picking and brawl that occurs.  And so on...  However, the only thing I can truthfully comment badly on is the length of the movie.  It in now way is ANYWHERE near 2 hours plus long.  In geek terms the ACTUAL ""The Gamers"" movie is shorter than an OS Star Trek episode with a running time of about 40 minutes.  This is why I do not like it for the price of about $25 (some other sites sell it for even MORE).  This DVD is definetly worth $10 but beyond $15 I believe is pushing it.  However, some of you may find the other comedy included on this DVD amusing, I did not find anything except ""The Gamers"" at all funny.  If your not on any kind of a budget and will not miss $25 from your wallet this is a must buy!  If you need to watch where you spend your cash then try and find a copy on here later at a more reasonable rate, at a local tag sale, ebay, or anywhere you can for $10 or less it IS worth that in my opinion!",1378771200,,1359,3.8840579710144927
3412139,5,B001875ZVS,"This is perhaps the best rpg spoof I've ever seen!  (With the possible exception of its full-length sequel.)  I won't spoil the ending for those of you who haven't seen it, but its great!  I especially love the family-friendly version included on this DVD that lets me watch it with my kids!  They love it too!",1374883200,,310,4.482142857142857
3412140,5,B001875ZVS,"If you have ever played RPGs or known someone who did, you will like this great little indie flick from Deadgentleman productions.  These guys actually have several great flicks out including a sequel to The Gamers.",1293494400,,215,4.972222222222222
3412141,5,B001875ZVS,"Hi!
I saw this version and thought... well some more stuff to laugh or smile. Scenes missing in the version I know and so I go ahead and bought it.
Well. There where no additional cuts some more ""special effects"" but nothing real new at all, beside the plenty ""bonus"" films.
At least the charm of the original film is still in place and the bonus stuff is nice to have so. Still one of the best funny films about this genre.

3412142,3,B001875ZVS,"I thoroughly enjoyed this dvd.
If you are not a gamer or do not know one, it probably won't be as enjoyable to you.
Lots of referential humor and some great sight gags.
One of the bonus cuts should have a strong language warning.",1278028800,,229,4.2272727272727275
3412143,4,B001875ZVS,"Although an amateur film with an extremely low budget, there is no questioning the role-playing integrity of the writers.  The hijinx and antics written into this film scream of personal experience and any role-player who has done his/her time will recognize the authenticity of this humor instantly.  This is really the essence of the film.  The picture and sound are often lackluster, but at the core of it all lies the unmistakable feeling that a bunch of gamers wanted to make a movie based on the ridiculous things that spontaneously popped up during their various adventures.  If you too game, you will see the merit of this film.  If not, this may not be the movie for you.  Also, as this film has a sequel, it is most definitely worth seeing it just to see how far the Dead Gentlemen have come.  ""Dorkness Rising"" has an -identical- core to this film although the plot, over-all writing, special effects, sound and camera work have vastly improved.  The only un-excusable downside is that this is only 45 minutes long, making it a bit pricey.",1262131200,6,1050,4.730769230769231
8268697,5,B001875ZVS,"One thing to note with this movie - It is incredibly low budget. The cinematography in particular is particularly lacking, you can tell that the available camera was not of the highest quality. But man, is it a ton of fun. It's got excellent humor, particularly if you're a tabletop gamer. But even if you're not, it's still an enjoyable experience. Very highly recommended.",1489276800,,374,4.859375

8268700,4,B001875ZVS,"In recent years, there has been a resurgence of tabletop gaming, including of role-playing games (RPGs). Their reliance on resolving actions by rolling dice, and on groups of players working together, makes for enormously entertaining and often unpredictable situations. This in turn leads players to develop their problem-solving skills, as well as some off-the-wall creativity, in order for their characters to survive and prosper. Both are on grand display in this movie, which simultaneously pokes fun and the social oddity of role-playing, while also giving affectionate nods to the capacity for gamers to solve problems. I gamed back in the day, and this movie took me back, to all the same fun and ridiculousness stemming from creative problem solving. I understand this movie was made on a budget of $1000, so don't go expecting a polished product, but that's beside the point. The writing is heartfelt and right on in capturing the humorous and creative elements of role-playing games. Kudos to Dead Gentlemen Productions!",1451952000,,1031,5.2926829268292686

8268702,4,B001875ZVS,"While I love the movie itself, I can't say I feel the same about the DVD. The menu looks like crap, and - for some odd reason - the audio is out of sync with the video in a handful of scenes, which ends up being really distracting when I try to watch the movie.",1428710400,,261,3.7636363636363637
8268703,4,B001875ZVS,"I like these people. Indie filmmakers with heart and willingness to tell a story on a shoe-string budget. One of the earlier pieces from Dead Gentlemen Productions, it does suffer from some sound and other issues. It also might not be as interesting to those who haven't done any RPGs. A bit of a surprise ending, which was revisited in Gamers: Hands of Fate, so looking to see how they explain it all in their sequel.",1425859200,,418,4.5131578947368425
