1243749,5,B00000JZHN,This has to be my all time favorite DVD far better than other productions of this I have viewed.  Absolutely delightful to watch for people of all ages - it's a keeper that you can watch over and again!,1207180800,2,202,4.17948717948718
1243750,5,B00000JZHN,"It's hard to believe, but I never heard of Wind in the Willows until I was about 16 years old, when it was first read aloud to me, around a glowing campfire. It was an instant love affair.

Years later, I shared the classic with my children. So when we found an animated version of the book for sale in a neighbor's tag sale, we snapped it up. We've loved the film ever since.

The animal characters--Badger, Mole, Toad, Weasel  and all the others--congregate often at Toad Hall and elsewhere, and the story takes many delightful turns.

This animated version, directed by Dave Unwin, is every bit as classic as the book. Your children will surely love it as much as we did--including the child in this particular mom.

1243751,4,B00000JZHN,"Since no one has revied this DVD and since I've never seen the DVD I don't know if this is the right movie. But if it is, it is classic.
I remember watching this during the holidays at my aunt's and uncles. Wild Mr. Toad and his crazy adventures and Ratty Mole and Badger. And the final battle between the heroes and the weasels to get them out of Mr. Toad's mansion.
The four stars are for the movie I saw as a kid, I don't know if this is that movie, but I hope it is.",1012176000,,470,3.8556701030927836
1243752,3,B00000JZHN,"This is the third version of Wind in the Willows that I've seen with my daughter. This may be the lamest version we've watched. Still, its a great story. Very funny and with the second movie, Winter in the Willows, make it a good buy. I don't regret buying it.",998265600,,260,4.22
1243753,5,B00000JZHN,"Our children already owned & loved these films on VHS, so I was suprised to see both full-length movies available on a single DVD for a bargain price.  True, there are no DVD ""extras"" in addition to  the two movies, but the important part -- the animated film -- looks better  than ever on DVD.  It's a crisp transfer of the charming Beatrix  Potter-style animation (not surprising, given that these were done by the  folks resposible for the fine ""World of Peter Rabbit &  Friends"" video series).
These wonderful children's films deserve a  much wider viewing than I think they've received. They are faithful  adaptations of the books, and the animation is, as I mentioned before,  charming. But perhaps the best parts are the delightfully engaging voice  characterizations -- Rat (voiced by Michael Palin of Monty Python fame),  Mole, Badger, and the irrepressible Toad are all done spot-on.  Toad's wild  antics usually give our young daughters the giggles, and the motorcars and  battle heroics are bound to capture the interest of young boys.
A  worthwhile purchase, or a great gift for children 2-7 who haven't yet seen  these films.",960508800,28,1139,4.941798941798941
1243754,5,B00000JZHN,"a longtime fan of the willows, i was pleased to see the producers of this dvd made few changes to the story. rik mayall's voice characterization of toad is perfect. mike palin's ratty is also excellent. and the lovely voice  of dame redgrave as the narrator adds to the pleasure.",959212800,6,279,4.58
1243755,5,B00000JZHN,And I thought the video's were fantastic!  I compared the sound and picture to the video versions. The dvd is in awesome stereo sound and the picture is crystal clear. Two of the best animated movies I have seen. Kids  and Adults will love it.,953337600,5,243,4.377777777777778

1243818,5,B00000JZHN,This is a classic that is missed by many young children- I read it to my third graders and then show the DVD- they love it! Highly recommend!,1390867200,2,141,4.071428571428571
1243819,1,B00000JZHN,"I loved these movies with my boys, we had them on VHS. When I spent way too much money for the DVD, it was the only disc that would not play in my player. Instead of replacing or refunding, Manasota wrote me and said that 'if' it played on their machine, I would get only the used price minus the maximum restocking fee! What are the odds that it will play on their machine??
  Too bad they don't re-release these, then you could but them at a reasonable price.",1387152000,6,461,4.168539325842697

1243821,5,B00000JZHN,"The production of these stories is wonderful and we return to them from time to time throughout the year, even as our grandchildren grow older.  We don't seem to tire of them and it's good to have both of these stories on one DVD.  It took a long time to find this DVD but I kept checking on amazon and finally was sucessful.

1243823,5,B00000JZHN,"This is the third version of The Wind in the Willows that we watched.

The first was ok and may likely appeal more to adults who grew up with the story.  It was the live action 2006 Masterpiece Theatre take on the story.  Fun, but not great for repeat viewing.

The second was the Claymation version which was made in 1983 with Richard Pearson and Ian Carmichael (re-released 2004).  We definitely enjoyed it but still made the effort to obtain the scarcer version (our third, below) with Vanessa Redgrave as narrator.

This one, the third, was charming.  It obviously followed the book storyline, used the British turn of phrase, and made the creatures absolutely delightful.  The production style reminded me of the Beatrix Potter videos we had so loved.  Those were quite superior productions as well.  This Wind in the Willows is by far the best one we viewed and needs to be re-released.

If this story is to be viewed by a youngster with no experience of British accents and phraseology, it is possible that my #2 pick with the Claymation characters might be slightly preferable.  The verbage and accents are more mainstream.  However, when my own children were young they loved the Beatrix Potter videos and the Britishness was never an issue.  It did not seem to be for the families to whom I gifted Beatrix Potter either.  They all loved them.

PLEASE RE-RELEASE THIS PRODUCTION.  Used DVD's are currently over $45.  It is a shame this is not in print.",1324339200,10,1461,4.707509881422925
1243824,5,B00000JZHN,"I am very happy to have this.  I had the VCR tapes, and wanted to upgrade to DVD.  These movies were very hard to find for a reasonable price, but this seller provided exactly what I needed.",1282867200,4,190,4.108108108108108
1243825,5,B00000JZHN,"I have been a fan of Wind in the Willows since I read the stories as a small child in England. They are great classics. I also have read the stories and watched the DVD's with my grandsons, who call me Pop Pop. Last year I took the liberty of writing fantasy stories about their imaginary adventures as junior Jedi Knights. It's called ""The Book Of Funtastic Adventures"" and is available on amazon.com In two of the adventures the boys fall down a rabbit hole, go back in time and meet Mole, Ratty, and Toad. This time Toad is into flying machines and is driving across his lawn at Toad hall much to the concern of Badger. The boys arrive and Toad wants them to experience the flying machine so he persuades them to climb in, promising the boys and Badger that he is just taxing across the lawn and will not fly, as he has no insurance and hasn't had any training. Unfortunately Toad gets carried away and takes off with the boys on a hilarious, crazy, adventure.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Book-of-Funtastic-Adventures-Silly-Bedtime-Stories-to-Make-Children-Laugh/dp/1888081732/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Book of Funtastic Adventures:Silly Bedtime Stories to Make Children Laugh</a>",1282780800,,1239,5.458333333333333

7914381,5,B00000JZHN,"This version of The Wind in the Willows is wonderful. I had recorded it on VCR when my grandchildren were small and we wore the tape out. I tried for years to obtain it on DVD but the price was insane - up to $200 at one time. I don't know why this version has not been re-released. The book was a childhood favorite of mine and I still enjoy reading it. One of the grandsons, who is now 17, watched this DVD with me as soon as I received it. Both of us enjoyed the quality and craftsmanship of this version. The animation is lovey, the music enjoyable and the store is true to the book.
