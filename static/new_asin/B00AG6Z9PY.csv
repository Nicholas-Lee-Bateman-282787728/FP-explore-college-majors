8551317,5,B00AG6Z9PY,"The Blu-Rays from Just Planes are of inconsistent quality.  This is one of the best.  We start with an hour of pre-flight, from dispatch to briefing to walk-around.  Everyone has an accent, but all are easily understandable, and we get a lot of useful information.

From there, it's flight to Mexico City, with a ton of information provided about the aircraft and the transatlantic crossing on the way.  There is also great scenery when the opportunity presents itself.  More detail in this video about the fly-by-wire system and how it relates to the stability of the aircraft than we get anywhere else.  We have a four engine aircraft here, so no ETOPS and a very direct routing unlike what most aircraft would have to take.

Descent into Mexico City is through some significant weather, which makes it pretty interesting.  Departure back to Spain is at night, also with significant bad weather, consistent weather issues across the US, since the return trip is at a more northerly latitude to take advantage of the winds.  (To Mexico is mostly over water, with some islands as scenery, to Spain takes us over Baltimore).

Cool video, with good use of the technology (long segments from cameras, rather than short flashes).  They also have a tail mounted camera on this aircraft, which means we actually watch a lot of the flight on the cockpit display showing the view from the camera which seems like it wouldn't work, but it actually works quite well.

Overall, very enjoyable almost four hours of video!",1357516800,,1509,4.84765625
