8743155,4,B018VSW3L6,"Who knew Sean Bean holding his hat and muttering ""I'm sorry m'lady"" for two seasons could be so interesting? This series is provocatively dark and macabre, a unique take on Mary Shelley's premise. An eclectic cast of intriguing characters, from humane to maniacal, makes this series a definite must-watch.",1529280000,,305,5.244897959183674
8743156,5,B018VSW3L6,"This is quite a good series. A reimagining of the Frankenstein story, as other reviewers have already noted. Sean Bean and cast are superb and the historical atmosphere is great. My only complaint, and it is a personal peeve of mine, is I hate it when the bad guys keep outsmarting the good guys and the bad guys ""win"". Please powers that be, we definitely need a season 3!",1519689600,,373,4.420289855072464
8743157,2,B018VSW3L6,"I give Sean Bean five stars because he is a great actor and makes a story perverted by political correctness, work. I give the writers one star as they chose to corrupt a great story with political correctness gobshite BS. So, ignore the political correctness shite and enjoy a good story. But the political correctness damn near ruins it.",1519430400,7,339,4.762711864406779
8743158,4,B018VSW3L6,"Just 4 stars because it doesn't have a real ending. We are left hanging, hoping for a season 3.
And how many throat slitting, gory, bloody murders must we endure? The acting is brilliant, the atmosphere is realistic for those days (having read Dickens). I love that Mary Shelley, Percy Shelly & Dickens are characters in this series. I was furious when certain characters were horrifically murdered.
Got quite sick of having to see sneery, horrible sociopaths in scene after scene.
All the actors are excellent.
It's a well written series but it is NOT final. It's a cliff hanger & we don't even know if it will continue.",1519344000,,621,4.706422018348624
8743159,5,B018VSW3L6,"Very good series! It's a good step back toward the original Mary Shelly story. Not necessarily in content, but in atmosphere. It lacks the silly exaggerations and over acting of the other film adaptations.",1514937600,,205,5.0588235294117645
8743160,5,B018VSW3L6,"The six-part TV drama inspired by the fictional story of Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein'
Set in 1827 London, the story follows Bow-Street Inspector 'John Marlott's' (Sean Bean) investigations ....
At first the inspector is given the task of uncovering a gang of 'opium-smugglers' which was successfully
completed...
When a body is washed up on the shore of the River Thames of a young girl which had been crudely
assembled from numerous body-parts the Home-Secretary 'Sir Robert Peel' (Tom Ward) appoints 'John
Marlott' to mount an undercover investigation into the sinister incident and assigns Officer 'Nightingale'
(Richie Campbell) to assist.
They will soon discover that young persons are disappearing from the streets never to be seen again, this
happening leads the Inspector to interview the parents of one such person 'Alice' .....'John' will make it his
mission to discover what happened the the young girl who innocently had left her home wearing her favourite
red-dress mysteriously not returning.
The two investigating Officers of the Law will learn of a mysterious and feared character known as the Monster
during their investigations.
The deeper into the case they get the more dangerous it becomes, they will come across many dark and seedy
characters along the way along with those that will appear to be credible upright citizens ...among the latter
and cleverly written into the tale 'Mary Shelley' (Anna Maxwell Martin) who's Frankenstein story had been published
during that time...a story 'John Marlott' will read and indeed as time passes will question in as much as is her story
based on real-happenings linked to the case ?
The closer to the truth 'John Marlott' and 'Nightingale' get see's many of those of standing and authority close-ranks.
This was a very absorbing series, well put together, totally gripping with the occasional jump-out-of-your-seat moment,
and several gory sequences.
Nice touch for those that followed 'Sharpe' ...'John Marlott' also serving in the military at the battle of Waterloo in
the same regiment.
I missed this when shown on TV, was encouraged to view having read one or two of the reviews....if you haven't seen
the series...i can recommend you giving it a spin.
