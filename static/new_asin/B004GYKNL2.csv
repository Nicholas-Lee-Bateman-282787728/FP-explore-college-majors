8429076,3,B004GYKNL2,"My rating of three stars does not mean this is a bad product.  I have decided to give three stars for several reasons.  First, don't let the cover picture and title fool you.  It leads you to believe this DVD will be showing young naked Asian boys (they are 18+).  Only part of that is true.  There is only ONE guy shown throughout the entire DVD, the guy you see on the cover.  Also, there is NEVER any frontal nudity.  His skimpy underwear allows you to see the outline of his ""anatomy"" and he does remove them completely at one time, but you are only able to see the very top part of his butt and his hips, but nothing else, so if you are looking for a DVD with fully naked Asian guys, this is not it!  But, while watching it, an idea for another use came to me -- an artist tool!  For any artist needing a young model for their drawing practice, this guy will do nicely as you get to see him at different angles and close ups for a good range of poses to use for drawing.  Basically, the DVD goes as follows:  the same young guy starts off fully dressed and smiling, then slowly takes of his clothes, until he is in only his underwear, then he usually takes a random object and rubs it against himself all over, while wetting his body down.  There are about 8 to 10 chapters and this is all he does in each one, with the only differences being him wearing different outfits and using different objects in each skit.  Other than that, don't expect too much.",1325462400,3,1460,4.189964157706093
