7474775,2,B016LGO67O,I am always on the lookout for new horror movies. The reviews for this one seemed fairly good so I took a chance. And I was let down. The acting was not that strong and there wasn't a well-developed concept.,1453248000,,207,4.2
7474776,1,B016LGO67O,"Terrible movie. Truly terrible. Don't watch this. If you feel like you just want to give it a try, stab out your eyes instead, it will hurt less.",1453075200,,145,4.214285714285714
7474777,1,B016LGO67O,This movie is so dark that you can hardly see anything. Why do you make a movie that no one can even watch?,1452556800,4,107,3.6956521739130435
7474778,5,B016LGO67O,"This movie starts off a little slow but it reels you in and by the end, you're totally left wanting more! More of a mystery thriller than a gore flick. I recommend this one to fans of The Shining, Session 9 and The Changeling.",1451865600,,226,4.159090909090909
7474779,5,B016LGO67O,This video  is one of the best independent movie I have seen in a long time. It looks like a multi million dollar movie. Good job,1451260800,,129,3.9615384615384617
7474780,1,B016LGO67O,"S***ty acting, terrible script, just pure stupidity. Can these crapfests get any worse?",1463443200,,87,5.769230769230769
7474781,3,B016LGO67O,"Not as bad as I thought! The movie starts off slow but picks up speed 30 minutes in. The fact that it was an abandonded insane asylum wasa bit of a stretch, the place was too gorgous, too nice and not that big! It isn't horro so much as psychological thriller that really takes no time in leading you to the conclusion...
The actrecess were REALLY ANNYING! Thelady that was a total b&*^h, and the other one well she was too obsessed about finsing out the nature of the house and it's history! I mean who goes into thier room, closes the door, puts on head phones and listenes to PHYCH TAPES while ALL THE OTHERS are looking for a lost girl?
If you want to know what would happen if you go off your psych meds this is it!",1462838400,,720,4.15
7474782,2,B016LGO67O,"Not so great, but I have seen worse.",1462752000,,36,3.625
7474783,1,B016LGO67O,"Everything that can be done poorly is done in this movie.

The dialogue is some of the worst I've seen on Prime, and that
is saying a lot. I could have written it when I was 12.

For fans of plot holes, you'll be orgasmic with delight.

Ace Jordan wrote and directed this. Pray that he never,
NEVER, NEVER  does so again.",1461542400,,321,4.129032258064516
7474784,1,B016LGO67O,"If you've been longing to watch a movie with hilarious, obvious continuity errors that makes no sense, this is the movie for you. The acting, writing and directing are all awful, but it's fun to watch the mistakes and think, ""Huh. I wonder what the editor was on when he put this together?"" At least we get to see Donny Boaz shirtless for about 5 minutes.",1459814400,,355,4.393939393939394
7474785,4,B016LGO67O,"Somewhat of a story, I watched to see the resolution of the show.",1459209600,,65,4.076923076923077
7474786,3,B016LGO67O,"The first 40 minutes are s-l-o-w and I almost gave up.  If you can make it past that, it gets really good.  Can only give it a 3 though for making me watch that first 40. lol",1458950400,,174,3.675675675675676
7474787,4,B016LGO67O,this was a good movie.. surprising ending!,1458864000,,42,5.142857142857143
7474788,1,B016LGO67O,"The plot was okay, however every time there was a new discovery made or something important that needed to be told suddenly""I don't have time for this,""

Extremely irritating. OMF? are you friggin kidding me your facing immanent danger and possible death and you cannot spare 5 seconds to share vital nfo that can maybe help save lives? Then there's the whole group separating to search for someone um ya stick together you know in case of attack you have backup DUH. It has a decent plot that had great potential that something really good could have been created had they left the stupidity out. Well I'm done bless you brave souls who decide to give it a try",1458691200,,661,4.554621848739496
7474789,3,B016LGO67O,"Considering this movie seemed like it had a decent budget (we'll go with somewhere slightly higher the original Paranormal Activity budget if I have to guess) for a low-budget film, the only big problem I personally had with this movie was the acting. Definitely docked off 1 1/2 stars. Being able to guess the ending less than halfway through was the last 1/2 star-- I can't count that against this movie too much, as it's hard to have an original and creative ending in a lot of horror plots-- it's mostly how they are executed that counts against them at this point.

If you are looking for a movie that you don't have to take seriously and has a certain amateur charm that adds unintended humor, this is for you.",1458259200,2,716,4.507692307692308
7474790,1,B016LGO67O,"This movie lacked any imagination, and the characters were the same ""tired"" stereotypes we've seen over and over again, especially in low budget horror films such as this.",1458000000,,171,5.142857142857143
7474791,1,B016LGO67O,Nothing to say did finish to film too much of a waste of time. Sometimes I enjoy bad film but not this.,1458000000,,103,3.727272727272727

7474793,3,B016LGO67O,if you want inane and  predictable this is your baby~,1458000000,,53,4.3
7474794,3,B016LGO67O,"It's basically the same plot with different scenery, actors and actresses, and a little bit more added to it. The movie itself is pretty decent, it's a good ""who-dun-it"" kind of movie. Bit gory in some scenes but really isn't too terrible. I rated it a 3 because I did see the movie, ""Session 6"" and so after a few clues I already knew what had happened and who did it kind of thing. If you haven't watched ""Session 6"" then you'll be surprised at the ending.",1457481600,2,458,4.275862068965517
7474795,1,B016LGO67O,"Horrible acting, and a confusing ending. I like b horrors, but this one wasn't even that good to make fun of",1457395200,,108,4.190476190476191
7474796,3,B016LGO67O,"People who are ripping this movie must have some kind of agenda. It is not ""so stoopit!!!"" It seemed average for a low-budget horror film to me. The problem I had with it were the plot holes. We see one character tied up in a chair. Later, we see her dead in the basement. Still later, she is just fine and walking down the path. Later yet, she is trying to rescue another character. As far as I could tell, these were not flashbacks. Yep, confusing, but not as much as some other low-budget horror movies I've seen. I did think the characters were a bit over the top, but they were not so so stoopit and all that. I did not find it so poorly lit as to be difficult to see what was going on, either. Seemed average in that way to me. Seems like a lot of ax-grinding going on in the reviews of this movie.  Kind of high-schoolish.",1457136000,3,829,4.117283950617284
7474797,3,B016LGO67O,"The film starts out with an incident at a mental hospital and then changes. The hospital has been converted into a retreat where a company is holding a getaway to brainstorm increased production. The cast of politically incorrect characters and comments made the film interesting. Teddy (Eli Bildner) and Lira (Devon Ogden) are polar opposites who annoy everyone. Rita (Trista Robinson) has a high squeaky voice and loves Jesus.

The connection of the past to the present was not as clever as the writers thought and the climax ruined a great cast of characters. I give credit to the director and cast, but the plot wasn't exciting.

Guide: F-bomb, sex, distant nudity ( Devon Ogden?)",1454976000,,684,4.939130434782609
7474798,1,B016LGO67O,"I usually love independent horror movies. I can usually look past the so-so special effects, bad camera angles...but this movie was aweful. The dialogue was the worst I've every heard. No one talks like these people in the movie. Not once could I get ""lost"" in the movie, because it was so bad.the only thing I lost was my 5 dollars.",1454371200,,333,4.475409836065574
7474799,3,B016LGO67O,Don't remember! Guess it was not that good?,1454284800,,43,4.5
8736713,3,B016LGO67O,"Low budget movie but by far not the worst movie I've ever seen. Cast members getting picked off one by one and making stupid decisions throughout, but hey.  There were several plot holes with the character, Rita. In fact, I began to think there must be three or four Ritas the way she came back to life, seemingly uninjured after dying or falling or whatever. Also I had a problem with Meghan and the headphones. Why for goodness sake? Why? I liked Dell who at least tried to respond intelligently even if some of his ideas were pretty awful. For example, Rita goes for a jog in the woods. The others want to look for her, but he warns them of Bears, traps getting lost and things that go bump in the night.  You could die out there so if she doesn't return by morning, we'll go look. Wait! Isn't Rita out there? Anyway, I thought the acting was pretty decent, especially the little kid. The exception to good acting was the gal who played the stereotype Bimbo. There were two endings. First the final scene in the Jeep. They could have ended the movie just before the glance into the rearview more and it would have been great but they included the rearview mirror which brought it down to been there, seen that. Instead of ending there, however, they did one more scene in the basement. That one just added to the continuity issue I had with a particular character. Also, I guessed the big mystery pretty early in the film. Bottom line: Not bad for what it is. Watchable and kind of fun if you don't think about it too much.",1523664000,,1526,4.3886925795053005

8736715,5,B016LGO67O,"Very good horror movie for being low budget!  Watched this based on Youtube's GoodBadFlicks recommendation and I cannot complain.  This would have easily been a 5 star movie with $5 million more budget.  Funny, not so scary, and great characters!",1497139200,2,246,5.1
8736716,2,B016LGO67O,Could have been better.  I've seen a lot worse.,1486598400,,47,4.222222222222222

8736719,2,B016LGO67O,"Really not scary at all. There were multiple subplots that didn't seem to go anywhere and I had to laugh at the convenient ""bear trap"" scene. This isn't the worst thing I've seen but it's just not scary so unless it's the only thing that's available, I would skip it.",1468713600,,267,4.36
