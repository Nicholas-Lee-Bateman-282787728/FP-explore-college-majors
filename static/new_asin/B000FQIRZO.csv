2581830,4,B000FQIRZO,"I loved the Soweto Gospel Choir when I saw them on TV and decided to order the CD.  As a professor in a community college, I start my 3-hour classes with music, play music during breaks, and occassionally during various activities.  I try to end the class with music, too. The student population is quite diverse; infact the students hail from approximately 30 countries of origin.  Last week, to the students' complete enjoyment, I used this CD.  Many of the students inquired where they could get it and wanted to see more than time permitted.  (It is much more interesting than my lectures, I'm sure!)  They, like me, enjoyed the vibrancy and  beauty of the music, costumes, and dance.",1205625600,2,688,4.73109243697479

2581833,5,B000FQIRZO,"I discovered the Soweto Gospel Choir quite by accident while I was searching for information on Josh Groban, and I decided to just give them a listen to see what they were like. And I am so glad I did! To say that I was impressed would be an understatement! They totally blew me away! I went to their website, listened to a couple of sound clips, and within just minutes I was so moved that I purchased all three of their albums and this DVD! I am definitely not disappointed! These people will rock your socks off! Buy this DVD today! You will not regret it!

I was moved to tears just watching it!",1176163200,7,599,4.208695652173913

2581838,5,B000FQIRZO,"I bought this DVD after seeing the performance

Live,here in Pittsburgh. The harmony immediately

brought to mind Ladysmith Black Mombazo and of

course,Miriam Makeba.

Each song reached me in a different way and drew

me closer to my African roots:Noyana,a soulful plea

to sinners to turn toward Heaven. Joko Yahao reminds

us that ""His burden is light,"" The sweet yet powerful

harmonies of Thapelo callus to prayer,and Nkosi Sikelele

Africa call to mind the South African struggle for

indepencence. I saw it all live,now I see it again and again.",1162512000,13,552,5.033333333333333

The only downer is the deadpan audience. This should be filmed again in front of an audience that is capable of being moved. I suspect a church would be a more vibrant setting.",1240185600,3,390,4.82089552238806
