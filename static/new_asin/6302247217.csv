Throughout the film the feeling of uneasiness is felt by the audience.  A good entry into the 80's horror genre.",1438732800,,247,4.212765957446808
7823280,5,6302247217,"This is one of my favorite films. I wish they would give this film its own DVD release and not that crappy 2 in 1 deal. Anyways, this film is pretty straight forward. Jamie is a lonely boy whose only friend is his stuffed Teddy. Everyone in his town is mean to him and his parents are never home, leaving him with a baby sitter for most of his time. He explores the woods one day and finds a giant hole in the ground with monsters that dwell below. He begins to feed them pounds and pounds of raw meat but once he runs out of money, he has to find a new way to feed his friends. Perhaps the mean people in town will suffice?

I found this film to be very humorous. I don't know if the film was intended to be funny but I think it worked to their advantage. Jamie looks like a kid but his mind is that of a teenager in his prime. He pulls a few pranks, which I will not give away, that were really funny and perverted.

All in all I think this is an absolute must have for any collector. Don't let this one pass you by, get it!",1369526400,,1026,3.9043062200956937
7823281,4,6302247217,"The premise is thus;  An adolescent boy named Jaimie is content  meandering through the woods and voyeuristically stalking his attractive twenty-something sitter while toting around a plushy brown teddy bear.  The little blonde boy listens attentively to every horrific plot and dark thing Teddy tells him and We the Viewer begin to realise that Teddy is somehow connected to the mysterious Pit in the middle of the forest!

The Pit is large in width and depth; strange growlings and chitterings can be heard from far below, but we're never privy to what lies in the dark recesses.  The boy does Teddy's bidding, flinging various enemies and neighbors down, and We the Viewer are still tense with curiosity;  what, you'll ask, is IN that Pit?  Stick around to the film's finale and your curiosity shall be assuaged.  That's the fun part!

A fine late seventies, early eighties B-movie!  Watch it and be amused, be very amused.",1063411200,6,926,4.916129032258064
7823282,4,6302247217,"Sammy Snyder plays Jamie Benjamin, a disturbed 12 year old who has a telepathic teddy bear, monsters in a pit, and a babysitter that puts up with his emerging hormones. Sociopathic and sexually curious, our hero feeds his adversaries to awaiting anthropods in a hole unknown to anyone except him. The monsters are only a sub-plot where that Jamie's deviations are the real focus of the film. His psychological make-up and his simmering male frustration is the real horror in this early 80s better than average monster film. Highly original and quite entertaining, ""Pit"" discovers the essence of malcontented pre-teen sexual discomfort, and delivers robust comedy as it's ultimate revenge.",992217600,2,688,5.263636363636364
