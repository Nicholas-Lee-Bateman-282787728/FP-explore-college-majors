7820160,4,6302037352,A good quality late sixties style horror film.,1526342400,,46,4.875
7820161,5,6302037352,I saw this movie when it first came out in the 70's. Yes it is cliche-ridden and some of the acting isn't all that great. But something about it is a lot of fun. It's one of my favorite B movies in the horror genre and I recommend it.,1522454400,,234,3.795918367346939
7820162,5,6302037352,"I love this movie!  I saw it years ago on TV, and as a kid it creeped me out. As a middle aged man who never grew up, it's still a bit creepy, but I've come to value the great little mystery surrounding the wax museum and the first rate performances of a bunch of old timey movie stars. Extremely enjoyable mystery; a real throwback to the Universal thrillers of the 40's.",1521244800,,372,4.166666666666667
7820163,2,6302037352,"All-star cast of veteran actors can't save this ultimately mediocre film. The ending was a real letdown. I expected more...much more than this film delivered. I'm glad I only rented it. There are much better wax museum films out there to enjoy (e.g. ""Mystery of the Wax Museum"" from 1933). Still, some might find some interest in ""Terror in the Wax Museum"". I suggest renting it before you consider purchasing it.",1517702400,,413,4.830985915492958
7820164,5,6302037352,"When we started watching this, we were expecting a run-of-the-mill, campy 70's flick, but this exceeded our expectations in the best way possible. The plot was original, and there was enough mystery to keep us guessing until the very end. Very exciting to see certain actors (Elsa Lanchester and Shanni Wallis) too! We highly recommend this as a perfect rainy-day movie.",1517616000,,370,5.081967213114754
7820165,5,6302037352,It's a classic. I don't know how i missed it.,1516665600,,45,3.6
7820166,5,6302037352,"This is a great movie,  It has recreations of some of my favorite stories and movies.  I love the period clothes the actors were wearing and when I guessed who had done it I was wrong.  I loved it.",1515888000,,197,4.0
7820167,5,6302037352,"Terrific old horror flick. Just the right combination of spooky, funny, and ""whodunit"" for a scary movie Saturday night.",1515110400,4,120,5.368421052631579

7820169,5,6302037352,"this movie is one of my favorites. it is a great movie to enjoy late at night.this is the classic who dunnit, which leaves the viewer not knowing who did it till the very end.elsa lanchester does a great job, as do all the cast. it takes place in england with plenty of fog and just the right atmosphere for a great late night movie.",1313366400,10,333,4.138461538461539
