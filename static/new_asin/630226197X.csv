444833,5,630226197X,"I have heard of the movie ""Another You"" and I'm looking forward to see it! Rated R for language.",1148860800,,96,4.105263157894737
444834,5,630226197X,"This film was the most recent for both its stars Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder. They did three other films together,1976's SILVER STREAK with Jill Clayburgh,1980's STIR CRAZY and 1989's SEE NO EVIL HEAR NO EVIL. In this film Pryor is a conman who befriends Wilder. Wilder's character does a great deal of lying(he plays a dual role). Great support from Stephen Lang and Mercedes Ruehl. Ruehl is Elaine,the wife of Wilder's character. Memorable scenes include Wilder's character being scared by Frankenstein in a haunted mansion,also faking a corpse at a funeral(he thanks those who attended). Vanessa Williams is Gloria,who Pryor's character takes romantic interest in. In the final scene,Pryor,Wilder,Ruehl and Williams are on vacation in Hawaii. Pryor and Wilder have a picture taken with them both holding a sign that reads ""Partners Forever"". Great film!",1097625600,5,858,5.3161764705882355
444835,1,630226197X,"I am a huge fan of Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor.  I loved Stir Crazy and Silver Streak.  When this movie came out, I made sure to see it on opening day.  I have never been so disappointed in a movie.
This movie starts bad and gets worse.  The script is so bad that Wilder and Pryor look like they're embarrassed to be acting in it.  As the movie went on, I held on to what little hope I had that the movie would improve.  It didn't.  When I thought things couldn't get any worse, the yodeling scene came on.  At that point, I too became embarrassed for having witnessed this.
I am only giving this film one star because Amazon has not allowed reviewers to give negative stars yet.",972345600,16,681,4.184615384615385
444836,5,630226197X,I love this movie.  It is so funny when Gene Wilder starts yodeling at the resteraunt and he calls it yodel elaine.  Gene Wilder & Richard Pryor sure do make a great team together.  It is also funny when Richard Pryor  can't play the saxaphone.,956188800,3,244,4.355555555555555
444837,5,630226197X,"This is another one of Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor's funniest movies in the world.  They are hilarious, and so is this movie.  I didn't stop laughing through the whole movie.  I love this movie, and also every other  one with Pryor/Wilder in it.  My favorite part of this movie was when Dave  aka Abe Fielding, ""comes back from the dead"" and starts yodeling.  If you want to laugh, watch this movie and every time you even think about  it after you watch it, you'll crack up.  I can't even see why that guy up  there says it's boring.",955756800,11,536,4.3232323232323235

444878,5,630226197X,I enjoy all the films Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder made together.  They had a special magic they shared and it made for some very funny films.,1397692800,,143,4.296296296296297
444889,5,630226197X,THIS WAS ONE OF MY VERY FIRST FAVORITE MIOVIES. GOD THIS WAS VERY HARD TO FIND. SO SO GLAD YOU HAD IT. LOVE YOU SOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH FOR IT. THANKS,1359244800,,144,4.0
444890,5,630226197X,When I read some of the negative reviews I could not believe it. This was the funniest of movies this pair made. How Pryor was mistaken for a great sax player to Wilder singing/yodeling a love song at the German resturant. I loved the guy imitating Capt. Kirk in the mental institution.,1343606400,,286,4.519230769230769
444891,1,630226197X,i'm not sure when this was released but Richard Pryor looks like he was so sickly while making this film. it was so sad to see him in this state and so not funny. and i'm so sick of the 'one note' acting Gene Widler does in this and most of his movies. this persona thats the same that he does in most of his movies just isn't funny to me. maybe you have to be having seen these movies when they first came out but didn't laugh once and at this writing there are 62 used copies of this dvd and after this review writing i'm addin mine to the lot and hope i get a penny for it!,1338768000,2,576,3.808333333333333
444892,2,630226197X,Enjoyed Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder in other films but this one lack hitting my funny bone. Richard looked painfully ill in this flick which probably contributed to the lack of chemistry in humor among this men.,1336176000,4,213,4.783783783783784
444893,1,630226197X,"From the moment they joined forces in ""Silver Streak"" (1976), Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder were a match made in comedy heaven - followed by entertaining vehicles such as ""Stir Crazy"" (1980) and ""See No Evil, Hear No Evil"" (1989). Unfortunately, ""Another You""  proved one film too many. The Wilder-Pryor chemistry was offset by the latter's ill health in this troubled 1991 production - evoking sadness instead of laughter. Pryor should have been in a hospital rather than a soundstage and Wilder's misplaced manic energy cannot carry the load. An ignoble end to the team's movie career.",1267401600,8,587,5.051546391752577
444894,4,630226197X,"At the time this film  was made, Richard Pryor was ill and had but a few years to live; Gene Wilder was a man in his late sixties. Without knowing these facts until a moment ago, my reaction to the film was that Pryor lacked the energy that had characterized his earlier performances; Wilder still performed with zest,  yet, it would seem to me, the phenomenon of which George Burns(regarding he and his wife, Gracie) and Jerry Lewis, among others, have spoken, that at a certain age, the characters with whom once they were very successful, now were too young for them to play credibly. Clearly Wilder found that  the fey youthful character he had created no longer suited him.  Nonetheless, there are enough funny routines here, enough good lines and visual action, to make this quite a  pleasant diversion. Of course, it is not Silver Streak, but it is fun, and the last chance to see one of the good comedy teams in films. I particularly enjoyed Wilder's citation, so to speak, of some classic comedy routines (for example, that of Smith and Dale) early in the film, when he fell into his chronic liar persona.
I suppose before buying, renting or borrowing this disc, you should ask yourself whether you are going to be in a relaxed, receptive mood or a critical one. This is not a movie that will stand up to a sharply critical analysis.",1257984000,2,1342,4.598326359832636
444895,1,630226197X,I got this movie in a three pack with other Pryror and Wilder movies. Needless to say this is the worst of the bunch. This movie is not really all that funny and is a bit confusing. I don't recommend this movie to anyone who wants too see a comedy. Stir Crazy or Hear No Evil See No Evil is a much better route.,1199491200,3,311,3.875
444896,2,630226197X,"I'm a huge fan of Gene Wilder's films especially when he pairs up with Richard Pryor.  As mentioned earlier, ""Silver Streak"" ""Stir Crazy"" are top gold for the duo.  ""See No Evil, Hear No Evil"", personally was also funny...it's from the late 80's--the magic is already diminishing.  Nevertheless, still enjoyable.  I love it even though it got panned by critics and reviewers here on Amazon.  I saw that this movie, ""Another You"" also got sad reviews across the board...but figured ""hey, if I liked ""see no evil, hear no evil.."" this might be good also.

It wasn't.  Trust me...I had a VERY open mind about this movie.  I was desperately SEARCHING for places to laugh...and unfortunately couldn't find any.  Let me clarify...there are many things that one COULD laugh at...but they didn't make me laugh.  I'm 22 and I suppose the comedy is dated or preferred for an older group (??) but some of the bits just don't work anymore.  Someone here reviewed that the yodeling scene in the movie was funny...I didn't laugh. In fact, i was shocked it went as long as it did.  The part where Richard Pryor fakes playing the saxophone?  A tired and old routine.  A bit like that isn't new...it's old.  Pryor tries to fake his way through a sax solo and fails.  That SHOULD be funny right?  The are many avenues and opportunities for gags in this movie...but their efforts are mediocre--at best.

I couldn't wait for the movie to end.  The acting was so fluffy and over the top that, THAT might be the only thing you can laugh at!  The plot is bareable but we're not watching a Wilder/Pryor movie for a plot!  Pyror's swearing is the only consistent comedic input he has in the movie which gets a giggle--not laughs.

Sadly, Pryor's medical condition escalates and is visible in the movie.  Facial reactions are not present much, and his overall frame is stiffening.  One would simply guess that it's old age but it distracts you when you're watching the movie.

The movie gets a very generous D as a grade.  People who would enjoy this would probably be people who watched it in theatres in 1991 and(for whatever reason) enjoyed watching it again today.  For ones who have never seen it and are younger...doubt you'll enjoy or compare it to the other Pryor/Wilder gems.",1179360000,2,2258,4.66497461928934

444898,1,630226197X,"I was hoping this film would be really funny like ""Hear No Evil, See No Evil"". Boy was i wrong. When i first knew Gene Wilder's Character was from a mental home, i said to myself, ""I have a feeling i will not like this movie at all, i think it's gonna be a very weird movie to watch"". Boy was i right. The yodeling scene drove me absolutely bonkers watching it, i was comtemplating turning it off, never to watch it again. When i watched the therapy session play near the start of the film, (When Richard Pryor came to meet George for the first time.) i really wanted to turn it off. The acting in that scene made me think how bad and WEIRD the acting is. The therapist in that scene should be commited too, he looked like he should be a patient himself. This film should be scrapped and made all over again. Sadly, The great funny man Richard Pryor, is no longer with us to create a remake.",1168387200,2,891,4.15606936416185
