5381550,5,B00A4F5A60,"Today is January 10,2013 and I have preorded The Virginian Season 7 but I can't give it a review yet as it won't be released until February 2013. But what I can say if it is good as the first 6 seasons I can't wait.  One thing about this show it is 75 minutes long without the commercials where it was 90 minutes with commercials. NBC aired this show on Wednesday nights its entire run. I watched it as a young kid with my family and loved it. The Virginian gave the viewer time to let a story evolve. Other hour long television shows had to get to the meat of the story quickly and the show was over as quick as it started. This show tells a good story in every episode and takes its time. Just the other day I watched the episode THE LONG WAY HOME from season 5 starring Pernell Roberts and Noah Berry (Jim Rockford's dad on The Rockford Files with James Garner)anyway this episode was exceptionally good with Pernell coming home to reunite with his son and wife but is rebuffed by his wife. He tries to cover up his past by leading a new life and a job at Shilo ranch.  Robert's performance in this show is not like you seen him before even not when he was on Bonanza!! I kid you not he is that good in the episode.

March 1, 2013

Well I recieved season 7 of the Virginian and I'm well into it. This season in my opinion is the biggest change with the addition of David Hartman from ABC's Good Morning America. Hartman's character is David Sutton who makes his way to Shilo in the first episode The Saddle Warmer and earns his spot as a likeable character. From what I have read he was on only for this season. What a shame his personality and character was a good addition to the show. I do miss Don Quine as Stacy, Universal chose not to give a reason for his departure but that was the way they did it back then compared today. Another episode I really enjoyed is Heritage starring Buffy Sainte-Marie who is a Shoshone Indian coming home from schooling back east and is torn between the white mans way of life and her native life style. It really tells a story how we tried to teach native americans the way of the world.  Also in the show is Eddie Little Sky and Jay Silverheels who round out the cast along with Ned Romero as JB. To rap it up, my opinion The Virginian is the BEST of the early westerns. It was well written, directed,and photographed and you can't forget Mr. James Drury who is THE VIRGINAN!!!",1357776000,16,2419,4.2272727272727275

5381558,3,B00A4F5A60,"First off I would like to say I'm a HUGE fan of The Virginian, especially James Drury.  Season 7 is different in that it takes on more sappy drama episodes.  (Like ""Eileen"", etc.) There seems to be less 'cowboy themed ' episodes. And each show involves one or two of our well liked stars instead of the whole Virginian family. I also noticed Trampas often takes more billing then the Virginian himself. And that is strange. I don't care for the new format. Another thing is that the very first episode of season one is filmed in a new large timber, woodsy film local. Then the remainder episodes are back to the Northern Los Angeles hills area with eucalyptus trees in the background. Very unlike Wyoming. I also wonder why the never 'make believed' it was wintertime? Like with fake snow etc. Still love the show despite the almost silly plots.",1478476800,2,845,4.589403973509934

5381570,5,B00A4F5A60,"Just when you thought that the VIRGINIAN had lost it's grip with a rather shaky season 6,the show redeem itself in season 7,enen though RYKER is gone. This is a wonderful surprize ,because THE VIRGINIAN was always the best western on tv because of it's quality scripts. THE VIRGINIAN and TRAMPAS bring DAVID HARTMAN,the futur host of GOOD MORNING AMERICA to the SHILOH RANCH.The first episode is rather bad,but after  that a miracle happens and we get the VIRGINIAN we all liked in the first five seasons. Sheriff MARK and many actors that we saw in previous years are back in the ranch. There was never a better western duo like DRURY and McCLURE on television. CRIME WAVE IN BUFFALO SPRINGS is the funniest episode and the most atypical of the serie. It was obviously inspired by the western spoof SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SHERIFF.Enjoy this, because this was as the old man says the golden age of television. Do we miss it with all the crap that we have right now. You bet we do.",1438041600,,976,4.577142857142857

5381595,5,B00A4F5A60,"Here are capsule impressions from season seven of ""The Virginian,"" a robust year despite one questionable addition to the cast of regulars.

VISION OF BLINDNESS -- Guest stars, John Saxon, Ben Johnson
Elizabeth Grainger, blinded in a stagecoach crash, receives succor from a seething ex-convict. Sara Lane hits all the right notes of fear, anger and despondency in supple yarn lent immense production value by a mountainous location shoot. David Hartman drips the milk of human kindness as inexperienced cowpoke David Sutton, but Johnson dries it up with a lean, mean reprise of his taunting baddie characters from ""Shane"" and ""One Eyed Jacks.""

THE WIND OF OUTRAGE -- Guest stars, Ricardo Montalban, Lois Nettleton, Lawrence Dane
Venturing far north to close a cattle deal, The Virginian and Trampas encounter a French-Canadian political exile and his fiancee, who once swindled Trampas. Montalban's trademark joie de vivre gives windy drama a push, assisted by the cushy Nettleton as his shady lady love. Drury has a bruising clash with a brawny trapper played by stunt man extraordinaire Max Kleven.

THE HERITAGE -- Guest star, Buffy Sainte-Marie
Shoshone woman who gained an education but lost her identity while studying in the east returns to Wyoming during a turbulent time for her village. Singer-peace activist Sainte-Marie plays her conflicted character soulfully under Leo Penn's direction in bountiful drama that yields generous helpings of action and is spiced by the casting of genuine Indians Ned Romero, Eddie Little Sky and TV icon Jay Silverheels as a wisely pacifistic old chief.

RIDE TO MISADVENTURE -- Guest stars, Joseph Campanella, Katherine Justice
The Virginian and Sutton track stagecoach thieves, who made off with vital anthrax serum, to a robbers' roost. Drury packs a season's worth of gunplay into uncharacteristic shoot-'em-up episode. Performances take a back seat to violence, but Virginia Gregg as a wicked-witchy town boss, Barbara Werle as a broken-down chanteuse and James Nusser as a sinister storekeeper are memorable. Sutton heedlessly lumbers into the line of fire during one gunfight, forcing The Virginian to risk his neck to bail him out.

DARK CORRIDOR -- Guest stars, Judith Lang, John Smith, Paul Winchell
The Virginian rescues a woman lost in a mental haze after a shocking event. Drury's calm presence props raven-haired Lang, whose imitation-Poe role isn't very stimulating. Murky episode is more notable for the oddball casting of ventriloquist Winchell, who whoops it up Gabby Hayes-style as a hirsute hermit. Former straight-arrow ""Laramie"" star Smith plays a dog heavy.

BIG TINY -- Guest stars, Julie Sommars, Roger Torrey
On a business trip to Durango, Sutton runs afoul of a jealous local Goliath, who's an old pal of Trampas. Director James Sheldon makes assets of Hartman's normal awkwardness and confusion amid plot's farcical complications, which are pretty funny. McClure, proficient at any sort of comedy, is in peak form, and spindly character actor Olan Soule is a hoot as a fruity shopkeeper. ""Cat Ballou"" composer Frank DeVol wrote the sprightly score.

DEATH WAIT -- Guest stars, Harold J. Stone, Sheila Larken, Murray MacLeod
After shooting a trespasser in self defense, Sutton copes with his conscience and the dead man's vengeful father and brother. Endless hand-wringing over the simple matter of going to the sheriff to explain a killing typifies contrived story's defiance of logic. Good moments are few, but veteran western supporting player Ed Faulkner has one as a cowboy who loses his nerve during a showdown. Sutton, no swashbuckling romancer he, woodenly rebuffs a saloon girl declaring her love.

LAST GRAVE AT SOCORRO CREEK -- Guest stars, Steve Ihnat, Lonny Chapman, Ellen Burstyn, Kevin Coughlin
The Virginian takes on a lawless town after a friend is lynched. Ihnat's layered portrayal of a slippery gunman who cloaks his murderous calculation with pussyfooting blandness elevates familiar morality tale. Coughlin has too much to do as the lynchee's whining son and Burstyn not enough as a non-grieving widow, although her peachy looks bask in Enzo Martinelli's cinematography. Bernard Herrmann composed the score.

THE LAND DREAMER -- Guest stars, James Olson, Cloris Leachman, Don Francks
The Shiloh crew brings in a farmer involved in a fatal shooting, but the victim's influential brother won't wait for justice to take its course. Maundering plot is reined in by some solid acting, including Leachman's refreshingly truthful portrait of a reluctant pioneer who hates the west. Sutton gets in the way as usual, frustrating The Virginian by trying to help a fugitive escape.

STORM OVER SHILOH -- Elizabeth is trapped in the abandoned mine where she took shelter from a storm. Clammy tension grows by the minute in taut drama directed by Michael Caffey and written by Frank Chase. The restrained acting of Drury, McClure, John McIntire, Jeanette Nolan and Lane reflects fortitude the viewer expects from their characters. Lane's brief reverie before the explosive climax is very moving. Strikingly shot and edited episode is one of the high marks of season seven.

FOX, HOUND AND THE WIDOW McCLOUD -- Guest stars, Victor Jory, Troy Donahue, Jean Inness
Escaped prisoner, an old cellmate of Trampas, finds refuge with a lonesome widow. Jory's captivating portrayal of wily convict Luke Nichols, a role he originated in the season six episode ""A Bad Place to Die,"" shines in low-key drama that grows gradually engrossing, with a wrenching finale. Former teen heartbreaker Donahue impresses as an ice-cold bounty hunter. Jory and Inness were a real-life married couple.",1372723200,11,5657,5.281423804226919

5381611,4,B00A4F5A60,"HEY JUDE by The Beatles was the Number 1 song in America when Season 7 of The Virginian premiered on Sept 18th, 1968  :)

>Picture Quality: SUPERB!  On a scale of 1-10, it's a 10. All of the seasons of The Virginian thus far have been visual feasts.
Digital Remastering doesn't get any better than this.

Even though there are some minor character changes from the previous year, nothing is profound enough to diminish the enjoyment. The quality writing and production remains top notch for the most part. John McIntire & his wife Jeanette Nolan return as Clay and Holly Grainger, owners of the Shiloh. Gone is nephew Stacy Grainger, played by Don Quine. His sister Elizabeth (Sara Lane) remains. Also hitting the trail for season 7: On again-off again Sheriff Ryker. (Clu Gulager)  This time he's gone for good (no big loss!), and once again he's replaced by Ross Elliot's likeable Sheriff Abbott.

The one new addition to the cast is ranch-hand David Sutton, played by none other than a young David Hartman. The same David Hartman who later found major fame as the host of GOOD MORNING AMERICA for many years. Here Hartman's rather awkward character never quite fits in. There are a couple episodes with him that work, one in particular with Trampas is quite entertaining, but mostly his character wasn't fully developed and his somewhat offbeat persona attenuated him to a very minor presence by the last half of the season. David was gone by Season 8.

The Virginian was always good for major guest stars and this season is no exception. Highlights include Pete Duel and Ben Murphy,(both later stars in Alias Smith & Jones) Anne Baxter, Burgess Meredith, James Brolin, Ricardo Montalban and more.

The ratings for Season 7  remained strong in 1968/1969 and the show was renewed for another year. But it was that next year's slight drop in viewership that caused the big make-over to The Men From Shiloh. Of course that was a bit of a bust and sadly what was left of The Virginian as we knew it rode off into the sunset forever.",1360713600,15,2031,4.714689265536723
5381612,5,B00A4F5A60,"I adore The Virginian, I also have not seen season 7 but the first 6 were outstanding. Gunsmoke has always been my favorite but The Virginian is right up there next to Gunsmoke. I didn't think any show would ever
come close to my Gunsmoke. I didn't think season 7 was ever going to come out so I started back watching season 1
They are that good and they always end up on a positive note. I hope this means that season 8&9 will follow.",1359936000,,435,4.129411764705883

8546691,4,B00A4F5A60,"This is the 1968-69 season! The episodes are now a couple minutes longer than previous years, running just under one hour & 18 minutes. New to the opening credits cast is David Hartman who plays Dave Sutton. He later became the host of Good Morning America.

This set is a two volume collection that came together. The first set had 15 episodes and the second set the final 11 episodes. Guest stars this season include Ricardo Montalban, Cloris Leachman, Yvonne DeCarlo, Victor Jory, John Aniston, Anne Baxter, Hugh Beaumont and many others. Some episodes don't feature guest stars. Jeannette Nolan is also back as Holly Grainger in many episodes.

No special features but the episodes look great in full color. This is a very beautifully produced program with sets, scripts, camera angles, acting, direction, etc. much better in quality than than average TV show. These are, after all, movies in length and production value.

There is some rewriting of show history. Liz's brother Stacy is not seen or mentioned and Liz is now a niece of Clay and not a great neice. Her father, Clay, and another dead brother Charles are mentioned and seen in an old photograph in one 1969 episode. In previous seasons Clay was a brother to Liz & Stacy's grandfather played by Charles Bickford.",1523232000,,1278,4.853211009174312

8546697,4,B00A4F5A60,"A fairly decent season.  The most interesting addition to the cast is David Hartman as David (I can't recall the characters last name).  David Hartman is, of course, the famous Good Morning American host during the 1970's, but I suspect many don't know about his previous television career as an actor. Mr. Hartman does a fairy decent job with his character.  Overall, this season, while not as good as the first three seasons, offers some strong episodes and should make an enjoyable addition to your DVD collection.  One final note, this particular season was not distributed by Timeless, but by Vivavisions.",1506556800,,610,5.00990099009901
