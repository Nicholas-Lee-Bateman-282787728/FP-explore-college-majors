4665128,3,B005ECLQ84,"I just opened my DVD and used it to workout.  Beginners of course!
The workout is good, it made my heart beat go up but there were a lot of areas that can be improved.
1) The actors never (until the very end) encourage the viewers to work out.  I think if they added `you can do it', `don't give up' during the cardio sessions it would help.
2) The actors assume everyone out there knows how to do squats.  Typically when you buy work out DVDs it talks about posture.  How to stand, knees bent, squat like you are trying to sit on a chair, check your posture, there was none of that.
3) The actors did not count, that is 1, 2, 3, 10... 4 more to go.
4) If you love bollywood music, it has the option to play that. This is a plus.
5) In the beginning the DVD focused on the actors face but really... I think focusing on how she is working out would have been a better option.
Over all 3.5! If all the above points were included then a 4.5!",1317686400,7,938,3.973404255319149
4665129,4,B005ECLQ84,"I exercise 3 days per week (most times).  Am in good shape, but must say that I am NOT trying to lose weight...simply like keeping in shape.  When I first did the workout I thought that there was no way I would even FEEL a burn the next day (as it FELT easy to me). But lo and behold, I felt it! Great work out! Rather funny with the ""love Yourself"" music in the background and the odd side notes spoken to us as we work out...but hey, motivation IS motivation, however you take it. I quite like the music. Didnt fidn it annoying. And I KNOW that continued use (in combo with other fitness routines and god eating) will help anyone who tries this, to both stay in shape OR get in shape!  (it is perfectly timed too! Great for busy people!",1312156800,7,738,4.146853146853147
4665130,4,B005ECLQ84,"I really enjoy this workout. I get a great workout in 25 minutes (that includes warm-up and cool down.) While I don't use this DVD exclusively, I do use about once a week. The circuit training is perfect for burning fat and building muscle. I am not Indian and I had no trouble understanding Bipasha or Deanne (her fitness friend who interjects a comment here or there.)

What I didn't like:
**The commercials

**The repeated ""Love Yourself"" song. However, like another reviewer said, you can change the music to avoid the annoying Love Yourself mantra played over and over and over again.

**The cool down has no instructions and it is difficult to follow your tv if your head is facing the mat. It also moves pretty quickly, so you have to play ""catch-up"" with the instructors. This makes you rush, which is counterproductive in a cool down period.

All in all, I really like this video. It is like an abbreviated version of Cindy Crawford's Shape Your Body. I am glad I bought it.",1311811200,6,983,4.6
4665131,5,B005ECLQ84,"I have to say this DVD is a surprise . The quality and production value is the best I've ever seen . This type of training works for me because it's interval training and the changes in routine and intensity keeps it fresh and interesting . Along with Bipasha there is also fitness expert Deanne Panday  demonstrating more advanced moves and I feel the exercises are well explained and thought out . There is a timer to show you the amount of time left in the entire workout as well as a separate timer to show you how much time  is left to do when the intensity gets more challenging .The packaging is amazing and the DVD cover flips open like a mini hard back book.

Finally Bipasha looks like she walks the walk , she's not just some celebrity going  through the motions she really is in amazing shape so it makes me even more motivated to do the workout . I would highly recommend it !",1307577600,10,889,4.273809523809524
4665132,5,B005ECLQ84,I would recommend playing the session w/out bollywood music first because she explains the technic in more detail. Love the continuous change throughout the workout.,1278201600,6,165,5.64
4665133,5,B005ECLQ84,"The only downer on this video, is the soundtrack ""Love Yourself"" playing over and over for 25 minutes.  However, I still gave it 5 stars because there is an option to change the music to Bollywood soundtracks which is much better in my opinion.  I was really surprised by this video.  It really works! I use 5 pound weights so it makes my workout a challenge (for me anyways).  I do it with my friends sometimes or on my own.  I like that I don't need a lot of equipment in order to do this video.  I think that a real challenge would be to do the beginners video and the advanced in one workout.  That would be hard!  The fact that its cardio, weight lifting and circuit training in only 25 min makes it an A+ because it takes care of everything and will give you results.",1275609600,21,773,4.175675675675675
4665134,5,B005ECLQ84,This is a great workout! It is fun to do and WORKS. I have 5 children all under the age of 13 and they can all follow and do the basic workout. The warm up is concise and you can feel yourself warmer by the end.  They do a great job of explaining what the individual exercises do as well as keeping you motivated. It is easy to follow without getting lost. The mix of cardio and strength training together makes it so if you get tired just pause and pick up the next exercise. Wonderful video,1275177600,9,492,4.072164948453608

8468126,2,B005ECLQ84,"She is very HUMAN
even she has nice body she seems very frank and nice

the movements are easy but very effective,
I can feel the muscle after the workout",1384041600,,154,4.133333333333334
8468127,5,B005ECLQ84,"I really think it is a motivating video with behind the scene input as well - which makes one realize the emphasis on HEALTH and not just figure. The video is of good quality; the only downer i found was that in the cool down  - you go from on your stomach to on your back in a change of scene and you don't get time to follow - more so, there is no instruction for the cool down part of it. But it does what it is meant to - which is motivate to work out.

You see results within days!! Energy levels increase and the body really tones up. Plus the workouts don't even feel like a workout. I would recommend this to EVERYONE!!!

PS: I don't find the ""love yourself"" or ""there is no limit"" music annoying - i enjoy it lol ^_^",1378598400,2,725,3.952054794520548
8468128,5,B005ECLQ84,This is a fun workout video. Although I would like it if the makers could allow you to skip the commercials every time you put the DVD in.,1377820800,,138,3.9642857142857144
8468129,5,B005ECLQ84,"I love this video. Bipasha is very good in the training. I just wish they would talk when they go to the next exercise when laying down, you don't know they have moved positions because you are relaxing and waiting for the cue to use the other leg. It love that I can use my rebounder for the times when the cardio is inserted. I wish other dvds were like this. But i have this and I enjoy it and It makes you love yourself no matter what type your body.  She does wear leggings so don't be put off by the lack of clothing on the cover.",1362614400,2,536,3.962962962962963
8468130,5,B005ECLQ84,"this video keeps you hooked and inspired. so much visual...... keep it going, its easy fun and really works you out without noticing your sweating,,,,,,,, smooth good smart moves. yes, its smart tooooo.",1361750400,2,202,5.151515151515151
8468131,3,B005ECLQ84,"OK, the overall workout is all right (I've only done beginner thus far); it is a circuit of strength training, cardio and floor work that did make me sweat and feel as if I got a workout. I also liked the timer that showed how long you had to do each exercise. But, having said that, here are the things that ticked me off.

First, when I pay for a DVD (even if I only paid $9.22), I don't expect to have to sit through a commercial for artificial sweetener. I expect ads on a rental, not a purchase. Next, they made a point of telling you exactly what brand and style of shoes they were wearing. After they made a little money, we got on to the workout.

I can't do high impact where both feet leave the floor because my knee pops out of place. I had to modify two of the main cardio moves. They don't offer a modification, but on the ""shuffles"" which are hopping from side to side, I just skipped from side to side instead. For the jumping jacks, I did heel jacks instead. So, be prepared to make your own modifications if you can't do high impact.

Next, whenever they switched from one camera angle to another, the exercises were out of sync. For example, you are following along and suddenly their hands are up while yours are down. This happens more than once. The thing that offsets this annoyance a bit is that the exercises are timed, so I just kept the original rhythm and tried not to let it bother me that I was out of sync. Also, in the cool down segment, they cut to the next exercise without giving you time to change position. So, for one exercise you are on your back, then there is a cut, and you are instantly supposed to be on your stomach, and the timer is going, so you lose time for that exercise.

Finally, the music. The horrible, horrible music. One song repeats ""love yourself"" throughout. The other repeats ""there are no limits."" When I was finished, it was an earworm repeating ""love yourself, there are no limits"" over and over in my mind until I wanted to scream, ""Make it stop!"" Another reviewer said you can change the music to songs from Bollywood musicals. I have to figure out how to do this if I'm ever going to try this workout again.",1358553600,7,2172,4.2773722627737225
8468132,5,B005ECLQ84,"It is a very good workout video. It has 2 levels, one for beginners and one for advanced. Each workout is is like a circuit training. The timer on the screen is a great feature. Narration is apt. You can listen to Bollywood music while working out which I am not sure is very synchronized with the workout.",1346371200,2,306,4.293103448275862
8468133,5,B005ECLQ84,"I have long admired Bipasha Basu's obvious commmitment to a healthy lifestyle and was glad when she came out with this dvd. It reminds me a lot of the  Jillian Michaels 123 dvd. You start with a warm up. Then you go into 3 minutes of strength training, 2 minutes of cardio, and 2 minutes of ab. The only difference was that with this dvd, I actually found myself better able to complete the moves without having a drill instructor screaming at me. You do have the option of changing the music to bollywood songs instead of the love yourself music. At the title screen you change it, and the songs are pretty decent. The dvd has two workouts on it. One for beginners and then a more advanced version. Buy this dvd, you will not be disappointed.",1335657600,4,743,4.384057971014493
