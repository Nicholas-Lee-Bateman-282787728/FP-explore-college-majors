 Let me start by saying I don't own ""nor would I"" this movie, I rented this film years ago from a now defunct video store (aren't but a few of those good ole video stores left these days) and rented it once, I will tell you this, I could have thought of a much better script and even have done so high on Marijuana or Cocaine, rather smoking or snorting would have made no difference.

The only part that has any type of film sense would be the very beginning of the film when the guy quits is job and empties his briefcase down the stars from the office he worked in.

As for Vanna, well she's never been known for saying that much,and she's really no differnt in this movie. So now, I know why she has arguably the easiest job in the world.",1296864000,,818,4.09375
