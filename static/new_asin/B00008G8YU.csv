*I disagree with a reviewer's claim that it was never boring. Several scenes were predictable and so drawn out that I fast-forwarded the movie on those scenes. The director could have cut to the chase and moved on but to do so would have considerably cut down the 88 minute runtime. I had several scenes in mind that the director could have added, which would've run the movie longer and made it more interesting. It could've received five stars that I gave the same intergenerational teenage romance movie `The Tit and the Moon'.",1216512000,4,646,4.626086956521739
