8395116,4,B003E113HQ,"Although the plot is based on factual history, it is not the most important feature of the opera. The different perspectives on life are what matters. In fact, the only character that has any development through the opera is Blanche la Force. The other characters are what they are from beginning to end, and the music is what presents them best. The production is minimalistic and, as such, very effective since the emphasis goes to the presentations of the characters and their perspectives on life and death. There are hints that the production has been transposed from the French Revolution to the beginning of the Nazi domination in Germany, but it doesn't disturb at all, although I don't think it adds anything either.
The use of clever lightning feels the scenario in a very effective way. It allows the singers to sing, act and be the center of the attention. Poulenc's music is just magnificent. Most of the scenes are dialogues between two people. In fact, there are no duets at all. Various musical motives are brought with each one of the characters making it easier to capture their inner thoughts. The singers, with the exception of Gabriel Shnaut as Mother Marie are very good. The role of Mother Marie is a harsh and dogmatic one, but  Shnaut made it very unpleasant to hear.
This production is staged in front of an audience. The TV filming has two main problems. The stage has a net in its front, most probably to make better light effects. When the singers approach it you can see the net and can be somehow disturbing in your TV screen.
On the last scene there are two lines of long rectangles, one for each nun. Each nun goes from the lighted one the front one that goes black once the guillotine comes down. In the theater I assume they are parallel to each other, but the TV image is at an angle, which confuses the viewer and greatly diminishes the dramatic effect.
Some of the photographic images are very well done and it adds to the overall effect created by the lighting. Audience in the theater can't have that perspective.
Overall, highly recommended.",1332115200,3,2082,4.6730245231607626
8395117,5,B003E113HQ,"Poulenc(1899-1963) became a Catholic in the 1930's and this influenced his choice of the Dialogues des Carmelites, a opera in three acts. The first performance was in 1956. The libretto is by the composer based upon the play by Georges Bernanos. The opera is mostly based upon the experiences of the Carmelite nuns of Compiegne. During the French Revolution, the revolutionaries confiscated all Church assets and began to secularise all orders in the name of Freedom. These nuns were forced to leave the convent. When the Republic was proclaimed in 1792, it forbade the wearing of all religious garments. In 1794 16 Carmelite nuns from Compiegne were executed in Paris. They had regrouped and found guilty of conspiracy against the Republic. These sisters went to the scaffold singing 'Salve Regina' as the crowds stood in respectful silence.

Lehnhoff has used a minimalist set which enables us to concentrate on the opera. It is about the religious order becoming exposed to the outside World, in the time of the Nazi's. So we view the inside working of the convent and their reaction to the ugly World. Simone Young conducts the opera at a fair pace, bringing to the forefront the gentle melodies. Young is one of only a few Women today, conducting a top orchestra, the Hamburg Philharmonic. I wonder why.? The Singing parts are mainly well taken, including Kathryn Harries, a Mezzo. She plays the dying Madame de Croissy. If you want to hear her at the peak of her form,get Massenet,s Cleopatre, which she sings. This opera was recorded in 1990. The piece is conducted by Patrick Fourniller. The orchestra is the Nouvel Orchestre de Saint-Etienne. 2 CDs-Koch. What a voice. Madame Lidoine is Anne Schwanewilms, who was Maria Theresa in the Japanese recorded Der Rosenkavlier-Bluray. The only problem is Gabriele Schnaut, Marie de Incarnation. The voice is ugly and wobbles. But it does not interfere with this wonderful opera. Amazing that this opera was written at the time of Serialism music, Stockhausen and Co. This opera then would have been seen as conservative, but so what. It is well worth having in your collection.",1309910400,,2129,4.980337078651686
8395118,5,B003E113HQ,"Francis Poulenc's 1957 opera, for which he both composed the music and wrote the libretto (from a play by Georges Bernanos), has many distinct and individualistic qualities that set it apart, not least of which is the unique subject matter of the execution of Carmelite nuns by French Revolutionaries in 1794.  The treatment however is just as fascinating, the subject of death ominously present not only through the novice nun Blanche's pathological fear of death, through the suffering of ailing Mother Superior and the eventual martyrdom of the nuns, but also in the delicacy of the musical accompaniments that evoke an almost romantic relationship or fascination with the idea of death.

One other notable and unusual aspect of Dialogue des Carmlites is the dominance and importance of female voices, in recitative dialogue and in relation to one another.  The opera really is a celebration of the female voice, ranging from soprano to mezzo-soprano and contralto, all used marvellously and, it has to be said, sung magnificently in this production.  There are male roles in the opera and they are not insignificant, lending a welcome variety of colour and tone to the overpowering predominance of female singing that could otherwise become a little tiring at such length.

The staging of this Hamburg production is a masterpiece of the minimalist style, well suited to the dark subject matter and achieving incredible intensity and drama mainly from its use of light and shade and some subtle colouration.  It's perhaps a little too intense and austere when the opera is more lyrically varied in its score and libretto, but it's true that the sense of death is omnipresent, the questions of faith and life discussed by the nuns all coloured by consideration of death.  When combined with the remarkable singing, the power of the denouement is simply shattering.  A truly unique opera experience.

The Blu-ray quality is superb, certainly in terms of the audio - an exceptional DTS HD Master Audio 7.1 mix - although, as noted elsewhere, there are issues with the image.  Rather than being a flaw with the recording or the transfer, the mosquito noise dots actually seem to be part of the staging, caused by a fine gauze screen at the front of the stage.  This is often used in stage productions for light diffusion, but rarely throughout a whole opera.  Although it seems a strange decision to film the opera with a screen in-between, it's presumably part of the production design to soften the otherwise harsh direct lighting.  The dots are not always noticeable - only when performers are filmed in close-up and when they are towards the front of the stage.  There's little here however that spoils the enjoyment of this beautifully staged and fascinating opera.",1283731200,3,2769,5.0174672489082965
8395119,4,B003E113HQ,"I have more criticisms than the the Australian lead reviewer does, though this fine opera still makes a very good impression here.  It is one of the few operas, or even dramas generally, that treat conventional religion maturely and respectfully.  Every opera fan should give this opera a chance, and this production will do quite well, though I strongly prefer the Muti DVD.
There are no sets to speak of in this newer production, just lots of blue columns with some imaginative lighting.  The only colors you will see anywhere for 166 minutes are blue, white, and grey.  This suggests spirituality, possibly, but can be tiresome.  The lack of sets, increasingly common in opera these days, screams low budget to me.  While the column theme is made movingly clear at the final guillotine scene, it also tried my patience until then.
The final scenes with the 2nd Mother Superior encouraging her flock is very moving, with the nuns looking like prisoners, perhaps even of a Nazi concentration camp.
There is some miscasting, most of it not a deal breaker.  Blanche (the lead character) is played by a good singer/actress who is clearly too old for role visually.  The Father, on the other hand, looks far too young for his role.  The only serious problem is Sister Maria, played by the appropriately named Gabrielle Schnaut.  She looks unpleasant and sings even worse, with a strident Soviet-soprano-like tone that had me cringing when she opened her mouth.  All other roles are played quite well, both musically and dramatically.
However, the Muti production on TDK is better, sometimes slightly and sometimes significantly so.  Muti's Mother Superior is played by Anja Silja who, were this a movie rather than an opera, would be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.  Opera singers who act really well with the handicap of projecting their voices as they must are marvels; like Ginger Rogers dancing with Fred while going backwards in high heels.  The Muti sets are also spare, but not as much as this one.
I cannot compare the sound quality and conducting; I find that with DVDs my attention is fully occupied with the singing, acting, and staging.
Do acquaint yourself with this opera in any production you can find.",1280707200,8,2242,4.912466843501326
8395120,5,B003E113HQ,"It is unusual for an opera to be so true to life as this one is - based on actual tragic events. The singing is very dramatic in keeping with Poulenc's glorious music and the staging is suitably simple, stark and effectively lit.

However the video was not up to the usual unblemished BD quality on the system used here (a Sony player into a recent model Sony 46"" TV). The resolution etc was fine but every so often one could see a mosquito net effect on the faces. As this was so inconsistent and switched on and off inbetween shots I can only guess it was a fault in one camera and occurs in the master copy. A pity the production is blemished in this way.  I doubt if that could be a fault in my equipment as it is the first time it has been observed.

Although this was composed in the 20th century it is not discordent and has some beautiful moments which can make the hair stand up on the back of the neck. But it might not be everyone's cup of tea, particularly if you are not a fan of the soprano voice because there is very little male singing in this work.

So, highly recommended, with a note of caution. The work itself, the audio quality and the artistry involved are first rate, but the faulty video can be distracting.",1280707200,3,1233,4.211864406779661
