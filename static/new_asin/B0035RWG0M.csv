4071562,5,B0035RWG0M,"I came across this series through Netflix arbitrarily and I'm really glad I did!  It's an interesting fantasy / historical drama.  The characters are likeable and not one-dimensional.  The animation itself is beautiful from the still scenes to the fight scenes.  The soundtrack meshes well with the storyline.  My only complaint is the same as one mentioned in the review above.  The DVDs are stacked on a single spindle in a double DVD thick case.  You have to take them all out to sort through to get the one you want if you keep them in chronological order.  I'd only add that this is not the series for you if you prefer series that are pure eye candy, non-stop violence or action.",1270857600,4,685,4.557377049180328
4071563,5,B0035RWG0M,"This is a fabulous series, well worth watching if you get a chance.  While I am happy to own the complete collection, I hate the packaging of this set.  While it does contain all 8 discs, they are just stacked on each other on a single spindle.  It does make getting to the disc you want difficult.  Might be worth waiting to see what sort of set the release next before getting this one and hope for better packaging.",1268006400,6,418,4.253164556962025
4071564,5,B0035RWG0M,Pretty nice box set for a cheap price,1479600000,,37,3.75
4071565,5,B0035RWG0M,"An amazing show, but I want to talk more about the box set itself. It's one of my favorites in my collection now. The box itself is extremely unique. The art on the box is beautiful. A nice and colorful color palette wtih some amazing landscapes with rolling hills and deep blue skies. The DVD cases themselves are also extremely unique. It's a DVD case that I've never seen before. Overall, it's a beautiful, sturdy box with unique DVD cases and an amazing TV show. Totally recommended.",1475452800,,487,4.609195402298851

4071567,5,B0035RWG0M,"I'm not going to talk about the plot, just the general feeling of the characters and themes.

If you like mature, down to earth, no nonsense, and kick butt women, then this is for you!! I love when a show portrays a strong female character without simplifying her by giving her a need to have a man as a significant other. There's romantic tension but its down played A LOT. I HATE FAN SERVICE anime that objectifies women as something to goggle at. None of that here ~,~
Also the other characters are so relatable with their struggles and dynamics. Its interesting with its power struggles and conflicts. The artwork is rich and the music really enhances the emotion of the characters. You will learn terms and deities easy enough as this series really explains it without a lot of exposition. Its not a fighting movie, yes there are fights but its not the main focus. Its about growing, adapting, accepting change and challenges. Its wonderful. Check it out.",1474588800,,960,4.680473372781065
4071568,5,B0035RWG0M,"It was a fun story, with the center of the book GREATLY expanded.  Action, adventure, coming of age... a wonderfully varied story.",1472688000,,130,4.909090909090909
4071569,5,B0035RWG0M,"I had been looking for this series for awhile, and most sites only had a few episodes.

I will enjoy this for a long time.",1472342400,,122,3.88
4071570,5,B0035RWG0M,"Nice complete collection. Ordered this a few days ago as a backup copy, plus price was very reasonable. Packaging was done well, no missing, damaged or scratches on DVDs, all DVDs accountable for. And works, runs on DVD player. Anime artwork is good, run time is nice, something to sit down to and watch. Again for the price its very good.",1471219200,,339,4.573770491803279
4071571,5,B0035RWG0M,"One of my favorite anime of all times. What does it include?

Daring sword fights and a prince in disguise, of course! Only the swords fights are fought by Balsa, a character who doesn't so much defy the typical stereotypes as ignore them, and the prince is a child being hidden from the royal court. The people in the anime are all drawn with a more realistic bent than is usually employed (one of them has buck teeth, for instance), and the rice fields will take your breath away. Although, now that I've seen it a few times, I have noticed that the characters' faces can look different depending on the episode, especially Balsa.

Plot wise, this story is adapted from the first novel of a series written by an anthropologist, and I think that shows. The world feels very established and natural, and the plot is a little better rounder than your typical adventure series. It's neither comedy nor political drama, but it has moments of both. And, though the battles are mainly concentrated in the beginning and end of the series, they do sprinkle in a fight here and there to keep you awake (although, most of the suspense in the middle episodes is created by not knowing how to solve the problem they're in).

I think what I appreciate most about this anime is that it's actually a story, simple and complete, and not just a cast of odd characters or a strangely intriguing hook. Though I do love the characters here, it would be possible to describe this anime in detail without really mentioning them at all and that's almost impossible to say about most shows.",1469059200,,1567,4.589285714285714
4071572,5,B0035RWG0M,"This is another one that I absolutely loved.  The anime was great, the colors outstanding, the plot completed and the characters were real.  My daughter and I found ourselves discussing all the various components and possible outcomes as well as the story development throughout the show.  I am glad I purchased this set of stories.  It was great.",1468886400,,347,4.931034482758621
4071573,4,B0035RWG0M,"Completed the series and don't really have any lingering feelings about it. Its was an enjoyable watch and concluded nicely, but it's not a series that really sticks with you. Solid story and characters with okay animation and music make Moribito just a middle B class anime in my opinion.",1466899200,,289,4.8
4071574,5,B0035RWG0M,"Its the same video that I saw on TV. However, be aware that each episode will play back to back, there aren't any episode indicators on the menu",1466380800,,144,4.178571428571429

4071576,5,B0035RWG0M,"What a fantastic show! A true heroine of power who is autonomous and self-creating. So hard to find in this world! Along with gorgeous settings and an engrossing story. I'm so glad we bought it. We haven't finished all the episodes yet, but I know I won't want it to end!",1463097600,,271,4.333333333333333

4071578,5,B0035RWG0M,I love this story.  It has action and a lot of different relationship storylines without being mushy.  The main storyline is of the prince who has been given the responsibility of being a guardian of a spirit in the form of an egg inside of him.  The female bodyguard hired to protect his life is awesome and the relationship between the two remind me of mother and son.  I can't spoil the ending but there are a lot of twists and turns and is far from predictable.,1458432000,,465,4.310344827586207
4071579,5,B0035RWG0M,"Okay, first thing first, I bought the Moribito series due to the positive reviews written here on Amazon. I am pleasantly surprised with this anime series. The storytelling is just as wonderful as the art direction. The character development and depth of plot is nothing less than spectacular. I can tell that the creators placed a lot of love and dedication in this project. Moribito series reminds me of the movie ""Princess Mononoke"" in style and storytelling. I would highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a well written story containing great depth in plot. I also recommend to scroll through the other positive reviews here on Amazon about Moribito. Many reviews are spot on and describe the series in great detail.",1458086400,,732,4.959349593495935

4071583,4,B0035RWG0M,This review is only based on how the package arrived and the first DVD (didn't check the rest).  I saw this anime once and instantly fell in love; when I saw it on Amazon for a great price I jumped at the chance to purchase it.  I didn't like the fact that the DVDs were stacked on top of one another; the package it came in was a bit rough as if it was mishandled.  The first DVD produced weird lines during the theme song; I watched the first half only for quality and I didn't see any lines; I'm hoping the remaining are okay.  I'm a bit apprehensive and slightly disappointed because I purchased DVDs from Amazon before and the quality was always great.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed.,1450051200,,690,4.276923076923077

4071619,5,B0035RWG0M,"This sweeping saga parallels the government structure of both China and Japan in many ways. The story is about Balsa, a bodyguard for hire who is hired by the second queen of the Mikado to protect her son from what she believes is assassination attempts from the Mikado. Balsa takes the job reluctantly knowing that this job would be her last and one that would last until the young prince becomes an adult.
  The young prince has been given the special and dubious task of being The ""Guardian of the spirit"". He carries in his belly the egg of a water God, who's survival is key for the entire civilization of this planet. If the egg dies, then rain will never fall again.

  This story is an action adventure but its also a story of morals as well, It teaches that we cannot forget our past, and that if we do, then we loose something extremely important, our heritage and our way of life. The artwork is superb, and the music score is breath taking. I found the storyline to be completely engaging and thrilling. Its an epic tale, and one worth watching over and over.",1413676800,,1071,4.4438775510204085

And so begins the saga of Balsa the spear wielder and Chagum  as they begin their perilous life on the run from danger.

This is an anime with amazingly drawn characters in a beautifully created world.  Chagum for the first time outside of the royal palace begins his life's lessons ... as well as Balsa's.

The characters were appealing and the graphics very fine. Perhaps it was that the character development was believable and the story and action better balanced than most of the awful stuff I try to watch. I think most of the anime the children watch is as dumb as the video games they play. There, I said it!

Even if you've never seen a Japanese animated series, you are sure to become a fan of ""Moribito!"" The animated series has a definitive time line and spans the length of a year in the story, where if you watch once or twice a week over one summer vacation, you will feel as though the story moves along with real life. The characters grow over the span of the series, so that in the end.... well I won't spoil the fun.  Unlike many series that I've seen before, ""Moribito"" has taken cultural study and cultural sharing to a higher level in Japanese animation. The values are true to many of the places that I know in lands similar to these in ""Moribito.""  Some of those I know have never been interested in Japanese animations have told me midway through the series that they enjoyed it so much that they couldn't wait to see more of the story.

It is not very well known but I strongly recommend this series to any lovers of anime.  Sure this may not be everyone's cup of tea but it is certainly mine.

Now aside from the wonder anime I mentioned it being ""a diamond in the rough"" as quite frankly having a single stack to put all eight discs on was not the smartest idea and I think one of my discs got a little scratched as I noticed a slight hickup in one of the episodes.  Still it is a very hard deal to beat but just be warned you want to handle it with care and keep it right-side-up just in case, or just find another way to store your discs.",1389312000,,811,4.081761006289308

However, I will say the Anime is quite a work of art and was a good change of pace from the simulcasts that were airing as of late. This stands along side similar ones I like such as Sword of the Stranger and Ninja Scroll.

The reason I bought the CD was because I wanted a physical item to somewhat 'collect' so to speak. Similar to my reasoning behind buying something like Shrek the Whole Story. Upon receiving the shipment I was expecting to be able to watch it in Japanese with subs, but wasn't able to. Also, the quality of the box seem used or beaten up a bit with low quality print. The actual CDs seem used, scuffed, and there are even bubbles in them. I don't think I've ever seen used CDs manufactured this poorly before.

I wasn't expecting something like a Robotech Remastered Extended Edition Set, but this was so below what I was hoping for that it's kind of sad.",1379289600,,981,4.326086956521739
4071642,2,B0035RWG0M,"Let's get to it:

***PROS***

ORIGINALITY is the identifier for this show. There are no winking pixies, sons of Dracula, or robotic sky scrapers dueling (not that there's anything wrong with those AT ALL). They design a pleasing, realistic world with many unique rituals and mysteries to unravel (slowly). The characters are not regurgitated from popular anime, although what looks deep on the surface is regrettably a kiddie pool (aside from the prince who's got a whole ocean in his belly).

ANIMATION, ANIMATION, ANIMATION is gorgeous. Character designs, while not screamingly original, are smartly done. The action (when it happens) is reminiscent of Aniplex and Studio Bones gems like FMA: Brotherhood and Sword of the Stranger. There are no flame swords or lightning orbs, so the fights consist of actual martial arts choreography. It's refreshing as hell.

***CONS***

AUDIENCE CONFUSION. I'm not sure what age group they were aiming for. The story is not intricate or intellectually stimulating enough for adults, not risqu/edgy or bold enough for teens, and yet there's not enough action or flashing colors for kids. I've seen slow period pieces and understand the allure, but this is a made-up period; they didn't spend sufficient time explaining the wonderful world they've created, nor did they go deep enough to make me appreciate it.

PACING was the nail in the coffin for this show. 26 episodes? This would have been better as a film or six-episode one-shot. I understand and appreciate the water prince and his journey to become a real human being. I also understand having the audience live among the main characters to breathe in their day-to-day life lessons; I understand the down-time that comes with hiding out and learning the value of being a dull peasant. After four episodes of that, though, I'm good. What, more? Five? Six!? Make it rain already, kid. Let's fight some monster crabs and be done with it.

MUSIC. The music for the actual show is fine. It's no Hans Zimmer score, but it works well. I list the music among the cons only to take a massive dump on the opening title song. If you liked the song, power to ya.  When I first heard it, I laughed out loud. The second time I heard it, I looked around, embarrassed that someone would see me listening to it. I'm now fighting for the rights of the series: Do not judge the series on the opening credits or you will launch the DVD case through your new flatscreen. What an unfair and tragic thing to behold before asking an audience to take your show seriously.

All in all, this piece has its charms. I love long drawn-out period pieces, but this truly tried my affection for them. After two hours, I was desperately looking for an explosion of character development (or even a real explosion, for that matter). This show DOES deserve a following and fans . . . it's just not going to be me. A great effort that quickly turned into a trial of patience.

I really love anime when it works. I'm an animator and writer myself, so I'm always pouring through the stacks looking for gems. I'll be doing a lot more reviews. If you find that these are helpful or our tastes seem to align, follow along. I'll try not to steer you into s***.",1378598400,2,3213,4.7214285714285715
4071643,3,B0035RWG0M,"Not so much here to give my opinion on the anime one way or the other (I watch before I buy, so-I liked it) but just wanted to recommend finding a different 'complete' version to purchase.

The box/case this comes in is a single-stack DVD set, in which there is only one stalk on which all of the DVDs are stacked on top of each other- with no buffering in between the discs, easily allowing them to scratch one another during shipping and moving on/off the shelves.

Mine came in OK in shipping but I loaned it to a friend and the center stalk actually chipped and scraped around throughout all 6 discs at some point passing between houses, ruining all of them.",1372291200,,662,4.373983739837398

I'm usually that is a little skeptical about new animes, since there are so many out there and not a lot that seem to be good.  I did stick this one out though, mostly because I was curious to see how the next episode unveiled the story further.  This kept happening with each episode until I reached the end of the series.

Overall, I felt that it was a really well done series.  There were a few slow episodes, but I think they helped to develop the characters a little bit more.

I can't think of a single complaint with this series. At first, I thought this was shaping up to be another typical action series. It isn't like that at all. While there is some violence, it's very conservative on the blood and gore issue. The main focus of this series is the story, and the characters.

I appreciated the strong, honorable, and determined female lead.  I especially found her appearance, with a more realistic body type, very refreshing.

My daughter adds:  ""The DVDs present a very well written, compelling story.  The writers respect all of the characters throughout the series by rendering the actions of each consistent with previous behavior, unlike typical television series.

Also, Moribito maintained standards of respectful character design for all females appearing in the show.  None were objectified, demeaned, or degraded by stereotypical characteristics, traits, personalities, or motives generally accompanying the portrayal of women by the media.""

When she travels to the imperial city to have her spear mended, she's asked by the queen to take her son and protect him, because he is possessed by a ""Water Demon"" and the Mikado (the king) wants to kill him in order to prevent drought in the land. Balsa agrees to do this and takes the boy into her custody. And that is where the adventure begins.

This is one of those rare anime that is both appropriate for kids and is entertaining for adults. I commend it for involving a strong female lead, deep characters who grow throughout the series, and excellent animation quality and fight scenes.

The only thing you will be disappointed with is the shipping. It was sent with no padding and when it arrived at my door, the front of the case was shattered. The dvd's were not touched, although they were stacked one on top of the other, which means they will scratch easily.

of the backgrounds and the story telling far out weigh any negatives. It has a beautiful hand rendered
2D quality about it regardless of how it was actually produced. I love the opening theme as well. I never
get tired of hearing it. The story is about Balsa the female body guard who is hired to protect the young
Prince Chagum. Who has been infected with the egg of a water spirit. That's all I will say about it.
The one negative I have to say is how it is packaged. The collection is on eight cd's which come stacked

4071660,4,B0035RWG0M,"""Moribito"" is a beautiful fantasy series with many mature overtones.  But one needs to approach this knowing what they are getting into.

FOR PARENTS AND OTHER CONCERNED FOLKS...
There really isn't much swearing...I honestly can't remember any.  So that area's pretty much safe.  Also, absolutely no fanservice (amazing, right? haha).  In fact, the few ""hot springs"" scenes that exist aren't troubling at all.  They are very serious and add to the plot progression/character expansion.  Also, the ladies wear some kind of full body gown.  So there's nothing to worry about concerning visual content.  The violence is not many, but what exists isn't very gratuitous...while remaining very artistic and dramatic...and very important for the plot and story telling.

MOVING ON...

PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):
When I first purchased this, I was looking for more of an action series.  It was definitely very different than what I expected.  One best enjoys when they realize that they will be watching a drama, not a pure adrenaline-action flick.  After getting past the ""shock"" that this wasn't what I was expecting, I found this to be a very engaging and beautiful work...no regrets.  The pacing is purposely slow, but always progressing and no time is ever really wasted.  In fact, even the fight sequences are emotional at times, and their own narratives in of themselves.  Everything is virtually counted towards the story.  I also loved how the story wasn't very one sided (meaning seen by one group or person entirely), but all the events were seen and experienced by multiple perspectives and angles.  Each was completely independent while still influencing/complimenting the decisions and situations of the others (and because of this, you really got to know many of the characters from all sides).  The characters, themselves, are very believable and realistic...and very relatable.  You can tell how much thought and refining went into the background and psyche of each character (stated and unstated).

ANIMATION/PRODUCTION STYLE:
Rarely do I find a need to comment on animation/production style.  But, the world that is drawn and depicted in ""Moribito"" is simply beautiful and stunning.  This isn't pop-anime style like ""Full Metal Alchemist"", ""Naruto"" or ""Inuyasha"".  Rather, it's a very cinematic and full animation style.  The world is vibrant and full of color, while still being very natural and real in look.  The use of light and shading is subtle, but greatly influences the mood.  Also, the characters have many subtle details about them that help maintain the realism.  Also, the characters are naturally proportioned with no real exaggerations...while still being visually attractive and amusing.  Simply put, it leans towards the more mature and serious style of animation...and it does it with class.  The crew really put some love and care into this project.

SUB VERSUS DUB:
When dealing with foreign films that have options for dubs, I often enjoy trying out both.  I've found some shows that Subs seem to fit better, and some Dubs that are simply brilliant.  In the case of ""Moribito"", it's dub is quite phenomenal and fitting.  The script is natural and smart.  The voices they chose not only matched the characters, but they were very expressive...and very complimentary to the visuals.  I definitely prefer the dub.

PACKAGING:
The set consists of 8 discs.  It's all contained in a single DVD case that is roughly the size of two standard single-DVD cases combined.  The discs are pretty safe and secure from my experience, however, some may still be a little concerned that all 8 discs are stacked on top of each other with nothing dividing them.  I was concerned, too.  But I've had it for quite a couple years now and haven't really gotten scratches.  This is probably because there are notches, as well as surrounding walls, that keeps the discs from moving.  So unless you have some strange penchant for spinning your discs hard against each other in a DVD case, they should be alright.

ALL IN ALL...
This is a slow but very good animated series.  Many good lessons and a complexed yet simple narrative.  Good plot development and character growth.  Beautiful fight sequences that help move the story is also a plus.  The lore is captivating and the world is simply stunning.  It's not for everyone, definitely one worth risking a chance to see if it is for you :-)",1335484800,5,4402,5.054242002781641

I've never found a series that could keep me interested. But this here is something else all together. It starts perfectly and gradually raises the bar from start to
finish. Slipping in surprises along the way many times. This was actually so good for me that I watched every season in three days.

4071665,4,B0035RWG0M,"I fell in love with this series about a year ago when I first saw it on the Crunchyroll anime streaming site, and I knew then that someday I must buy it for myself.  The fact that the strong female lead isn't there to fulfill male fantasies was enough of a draw for me; but in addition to that it has great characters and drama, occasional but very well-animated combat scenes, and an interesting storyline.  And it's good for a wide audience age range: engaging for older viewers, without the crassness and strong violence that often makes anime unsuitable for younger viewers.

This comes with both English dubbed and original Japanese audio with subtitles.

My ONLY complaint (and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars) is the odd disk packaging.  There are 8 disks in all, and I've seen some clever ways to package multiple disks so that they are easy to remove from the case, while making the case as thin as possible.  But instead of doing something ingenuous, here they just stacked up all the disks and put them on a spool, much like in those stacks of disks you buy to burn on your computer.  I might need to get some individual disk cases to store them in , because I really don't want to shuffle through them all when I'm switching from one to another.",1331596800,,1261,4.456521739130435
4071666,5,B0035RWG0M,"I am so glad to have added this series to my collection, the quality of the art is equivalent to a Miyazaki movie that spans through 26 episodes. The story is the real reason behind the greatness of this anime. The action scenes are well done and mixed in sparingly to achieve more impact. The 26 episodes are a perfect length to fully flesh out the story and characters. 8.7/10

For $16 this is probably the most value in terms of quality,episode length and cost per episode you can find on amazon. If I had to start my anime collection again, this would probably be one of the first 3 series I'd buy.",1331251200,,602,4.327433628318584
4071667,4,B0035RWG0M,"So many people have noted that the series is amazing and I completely agree. Go read those reviews for a talk about the series.
What bugged me was the quality of the DVDs themselves and the box they were packaged in. The DVD box is the cheap stacked variety where all 8 discs are stacked up on each other without anything in between, meaning they can get scratched easier. The DVD video quality is not great, actually it's probably not any better than videos you can stream online at about 480p.
However, that being said, the price you pay for them is what draws people to this set. Currently, the set is a little over $20 for the DVDs, a total steal if you ask me. The blu-ray collection will run you up near $70-$100 depending on where you look and if you can find them on-sale. So overall, If I can save $80, i can deal with the bad packaging and the below average video quality. The question you have to ask yourself is.... can you?",1329609600,29,936,4.293785310734464
4071668,5,B0035RWG0M,"Moribito: Guardian of the Sacred Spirit is definitely one of my favorite animes of all time. It's not so long it's painful and the art is fantastic, the whole series will have you awking at the background. I can honestly say that there was nothing I disliked about any of the characters. Chagum turned out to surpass the expectations of a young, might i add ""ex-prince"". He didn't wine much, or at all really, and he was not narrowly focused on revenge or anything like that. His character development is wonderful and Balsa is a total BAMF. The fight scenes there are are to die for, even though there is a large gap between action scenes and 'growing scenes'I call them. Over all FABULOUS anime, worth watching at least once, if not more times.
Oh and despite my ""So painful it's long comment"" I really hope they make another one!
after all there are ten books and this is only one!",1327449600,,884,4.496894409937888
4071669,5,B0035RWG0M,"My first exposure to Moribito came from the short lived and turbulent run it had on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. It's not a show for everyone. It's a slow thoughtful series with beautiful art. Moribito is the type of short that's is heavy on story, you may have to watch it a second time for all the little elements to coalesce in your mind--especially if you've seen it the first time on Adult Swim which often times had audio problems. However,what little action scenes it does have is absolutely gorgeous and fast paced. Often times the choreography in an action series look a little sloppy with the overuse of squash and stretch or just plain lazy through the overuse of speed lines and hold frames. Here, the fight scenes are well thought to point of looking very similar to a dance, with spears of all things (usually the weapon of choice are swords in anime).

I won't go into the details of story and characters as other reviewers have done so already. I will say if you like a rich story, excellent characterization, and a setting rich in its own lore then Moribito will be the show for you. Or, to put it simply, if you like The Twelve Kingdoms you would like this show. Generally, I don't go out and buy a series if I've seen it already however Moribito was so pleasing that I wanted to add it to my collection.

Now onto packaging. You have the choice of getting the complete series all in one collection or the 4 two pack volume sets. The volume sets have different art work and I suppose other goodies as well but it's rather costly option for a twenty four episode series that isn't even remotely popular. Incidentally, before buying the complete series off of Amazon, I went to Best Buy and bought volume 3 and 4 thinking it was the complete series at $26. I returned it soon after seeing it wasn't the complete series. I love the series but not enough to spend over $100 for 24 episodes. Instead, I bought the complete collection off a vendor called RightStuf for the same price. It's rather barebones in terms of the extras. It has a clean intro/outro, brief interviews with the novelist the show is based off and the show's director and a segment with the Japanese Voice Actors praising the first couple of episodes. It's nice, I'm not an extras kind of person so I'm not too bothered. I just couldn't stand the way the dvds were packed together. All the dvds are stacked on top of each other with a little snap spindle in the middle to secure it. When I got the collection, the spindle was already broken the dvds were sliding around inside. There are a few nicks on a couple of the dvds but they are still playable. For a dvd collector me, I was a little upset that dvds were already scratched before I got to play them. I didn't bother to return them because I didn't feel like going through the trouble.

Anyway, that's my two cents. I hope you find this review helpful.",1325548800,13,2894,4.446327683615819
4071670,4,B0035RWG0M,"A son of the Mikado is ""possessed"" by a spirit which the Mikado believes to be an evil demon.  This demon is believed to be very powerful and the Mikado believes it must be destroyed, even if it means killing his own son.  The Mikado's wife wants to save her son, so she hires Balsa, a professional bodyguard, to protect her son from the Mikado.  Much of the story involves Balsa and the prince running from, hiding from, and occassionally fighting the men the Mikado sends after the prince.  Meanwhile, they have to discover the truth behind the spirit possessing the boy.  Much later, we learn Balsa's backstory.  The series is unique in that there really is no villian, when you think about it.

I admit it's lame, uncreative, and boring to compare this to another anime, but I'm going to do it anyway, since I don't have much experience with the genre.  This series has fewer episodes, characters, subplots, creepy stuff, fight scenes, tearjerking moments and less humor (or attempts at humor) than Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, but I like it anyway.  My only real complaint with the series is that the 26 episode format makes the story feel a little slow and drawn out.  The animation is done in a (mostly) realistic style.  The fight scenes are mostly realistic as well, except for those times when the heroine is fighting while running backwards.  The voice acting is very well done.  No fanservice to speak of.  Not too violent, (most of the fight scenes are relatively bloodless, which is odd, since Balsa's weapon is a spear) though I guess any blood at all makes something PG-13 these days.",1325203200,,1604,4.723021582733813

4071672,4,B0035RWG0M,"I purchased Morbito: Guardian of the Spirit because I had read some great reviews about the anime.  Although defiantly not one of the best anime that I have seen, it was certainly enjoyable and a worthwhile watch by the end.

Anime Review:

Plot and Characters:
I must say I wasn't too impressed with this anime when I first started watching it.  The beginning seemed rushed and it was difficult to really get a feel for the characters.  They seemed to be driven by overarching story devices rather than human feelings and emotion, and I thought they were rather hard to relate to and tended to be a bit on the over dramatic side.  As the anime progressed the characters really grew on me.  Although a bit on the stereotypical side and not particularly original, I began to really relish the moments where the characters were able to interact with each other a lot.  I think that is what really saved this show for me.  The plot itself was iffy and spread to far apart the show.  What I really enjoyed were the more rural everyday episodes that took up most of the middle part of the show, where the story itself was seemingly halted.

Artwork and Music:

The visual aspect of this anime is for the most part incredible and breath-taking.  The scenery is beautifully rendered and there some truly stunning moments of animation.  The fight scenes were creative and entertaining and the character design for the most part was very well done.  However despite such attention to detail at certain parts it seemed that in others there was a lack of detail.  One thing about the animation in particular that really bothered me was the rendering of the clothing.  Whenever the characters interact physically in a way that should in some way disrupt the clothing, the cloth seems more like a wall than a garment, the result which, was a lot of moments that were tender or sentimental in character were often slightly awkward looking and ruined in a part the effect.  The music was beautiful as well and suited the show well, a very pretty soundtrack.

Packaging:

Okay, now on to my real issue with this dvd bundle.  As a few people have already stated the way that the dvds themselves are arranged is terrible.  They are stacked on top of each other in the case which not only makes it difficult to find which disc you are looking for but also makes it easier for them to get scratched or damaged.  This isn't the biggest problem, just be careful with the discs when you are using them.  What I really had an issue with was the way that the show was encoded onto the dvds.  It was clearly a very sloppy job, which for a show so stunningly beautiful at times, its a real shame that the company who released this on dvd didn't bother to spend a little bit more time to make the dvds a clean watch.  Often during playback there were signs of untidy interfacing (little lines that would appear through the screen).  This happened most often during times when there was something fast paced going on, but it also was triggered by smaller things like the movement of the characters mouths or a pan over the scenery.  Really, to have such beautiful footage ruined by such careless encoding was a real shame.  If you have blue-ray I would really recommend getting the blue-ray disc over the regular dvd (in hopes that they have cleaned up the footage for an overall better viewing experience).

Hope this was helpful!",1320710400,,3402,4.5844370860927155

4071676,5,B0035RWG0M,"Moribito is a fantasy story where a female bodyguard, Balsa, accepts a job guarding a boy prince. The prince has been possessed by a water spirit/demon, so his father tries to have him killed. During the time they spend together, Balsa begins to care for the boy, and the young prince grows into a young man.

Other people have already provided more details on the rich plot, so I will not reiterate. However, I do want to point out some of the elements of the story that I really enjoyed. First, I was particularly impressed by the visual detail in the setting. The backgrounds were beautifully rendered, and the city settings are very rich. You really feel like this is in a real place. The food is rendered in such detail that it almost makes you hungry. EVen the visual details of the water mill and the storehouse in Hunter's Hole are well done. It almost made me buy this series again on Blu-Ray.

In addition to the visuals, the setting detail is extremely well-done. There is a lot of background information about how the people live, from the workings of the aforementioned water mill, how Balsa and company prepare for winter in Hunter's Hole, and how the blacksmith forges swords. Very nicely done. You could show this series to a history class.

I also really enjoyed the characters. None of the characters are two-dimensional. Balsa and Prince Chagum are well-developed, and carry the story well. Tanda, Balsa's herbalist friend also provides a good strong character without being a combat monster. But even the antagonists are detailed. The elite royal guards aren't just a bunch of skilled fighters - they demonstrate loyalty, dedication, and ingenuity. Seeing them trying to guess Balsa's next move, or conducting intelligence-gathering agaist Touya clearly show they are not only skilled but intelligent. Even the emperor, who issues the order for Chagum's assassination, clearly hates having to choose between his son and his people. There are no villains in this story, but instead many different people who are all trying to to the right thing.

The story is almost acceptable for younger children, though it does move a little slowly at times. The fight scenes are quite realistic and intense - no slow-mo martial arts stuff here. But it is not particularly bloody, for Balsa has sworn to never take another life. It is also rich enough that someone who doesn't watch anime could enjoy it too - it doesn't even use any of the stock anime cliches. Instead, Moribito stands proudly on its own, a sterling example of storytelling.",1304985600,4,2548,4.864055299539171

While journeying to fulfill her oath, she finds her first opportunity in Prince Chagum. The young prince has had the misfortune to become possessed by a strange water spirit and his own father has ordered his assassination. While fleeing from the Emperor's assassins, Balsa and Chagum form a close bond, and soon Balsa protects him from affection rather than her oath. In order to save the prince, Balsa and her friends must unravel the mystery behind Chagum's possession and the changes affecting the land.

Based on the first book of the Moribito series, Seirei no Moribito (Guardian of the Spirit) is one of those series that reminds you that anime can sometimes move beyond stereotypes and clichd story lines and have characters with depth and a story with layers. The anime closely follows the book, which works greatly to its advantage. The only times it deviates from the source material, is when it needs to expand the story to fill 26 episodes.
Balsa and Chagum are really likable characters. I thought for sure Chagum would be a spoiled brat, but he adapts quite well to his new life. Not that there aren't some bumps; he does go through a rather dramatic change in lifestyle and on top of it all, is possessed by a water spirit. But his character manages to overcome these challenges and grow. Balsa is one of the few female characters in anime that I like. She is strong, but not invincible, but that doesn't hold her back. The supporting characters are also complex and interesting, and there are enough of them to add diversity, but not so many that they can't have time to develop.

I believe I read at one point that the world in which Balsa and Co. live in is entirely fictional, thought it draws many elements from various Asian countries. I certainly felt the Asian influence, but I couldn't say it felt like any culture in particular, which made it feel all the more real. It was very well planned and the animation really brought it to life. I enjoyed the art style for this series - it was very easy on the eyes and enjoyable to watch. It was also nice to have something that felt unique, and not like every other anime out there.

That said, this release is TERRIBLE. It looks like someone just took all of the eight individual discs and stacked them on top of each other in a single DVD case. Content is ok, the extras include clean credits and previews, but the presentation is just so cheap. I shudder to think about the next time I watch this series and have to pull out all of the DVDs every time I swap to the next one. But I guess I got what I paid for. I wouldn't have minded paying a little more for a better box, but at least I have the anime.",1302652800,2,2783,4.442270058708415
4071679,3,B0035RWG0M,"I don't think a person watching anime needs to be ""wow'd"" every 10 seconds with an action or fight squence, but Moribito could have used a touch more.  Don't get me wrong, I think the story and the beautifully drawn environments make the series watchable.  I just think that for a premise based on a ""champion woman spear-wielder protecting a fledgling young prince,"" there would be more conflict.  When the action sequences do occur, they are very sharp and intricate (no slow strikes or generic back and forth movement).  Maybe this gap in action is intentional; so that the viewer is sort of FORCED to pay attention to the meat of the story, which in itself is nicely told without too much backtracking.

The characters are greatly developed, but the only qualm I have with them is that they tend to be ""a little TOO dramatic"".  And that is actually quoting my wife, who happened to be walking by while I was watching an episode. I actually agreed with her.  I know this series covers some tough life lessons and realities of their world.  But I think a real human being would react differently in some scenarios.

To sum it up...this is, for the most part, almost a kid-friendly tale of trying to survive a destiny that puts you directly in harms way, with the help of a few friends.  Yes there is action, but not enough for ""action-buffs.""  Yes there is a good story, but perhaps dragged out longer than necessary.  I gave this DVD Collection 3 stars because it is beautifully drawn, partially encapsulating, and a decent watch from beginning to end, but leaves you thirsting for a little faster pace.

I will not comment on the way the dvd's are stored in the case (suffice to say, I try to be very careful with the discs).",1300233600,4,1729,4.55663430420712
4071680,5,B0035RWG0M,"""Seirei no Moribito"" or ""Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit"" is about a traveling warrior and bodyguard named Balsa, ""The Spear Woman of Kanbal"".
As Balsa is traveling the land, in part to fulfill a vow she made long ago, she comes across a prince of an Imperial Family. His name is Chagum, and Balsa is witness to a supposed accident that nearly claims the young princes' life.
After saving the prince, Balsa is invited to the Imperial Palace where the second empress pleads with Balsa to take her young son away and become his bodyguard, as she fears his life may very well be near it's end.
Chagums' father, the Imperial Emperor, believes his son the prince is possessed by an evil spirit and must be offered up as a sacrifice so that his Kingdom will not experience a deadly drought. Although most of the Imperial court is reluctant to go through with this, they see no other way to save their homeland.

After firstly declining her request, Balsa accepts the task. Balsa also has good reason to save this young boy, as she has vowed to save the lives of eight people in order to attone for a ""sin"" that lays heavy in her heart. Balsa and Chagum flee from the palace, with some help from the second empress, and our story starts to unravel.
If Balsa succeeds in saving Chagum, this would be the eighth and final life she has saved.

Great opening, yeah? That's just the first episode. There is so much to love about Moribito, I could write all day about it.
The animation production by I.G. is amazing. The english dub is also surprisingly good. And Balsa has to be one of the most powerful and courageous female leads anime has given us.
Alot of you will no doubt have seen or heard about this fantastic anime, as it aired on Cartoon Networks Adult Swim in 2008 and 2009.
But whatever the case it's a classic that all otaku need to have in their collection.

So, if you love a fantasy that's not so ""cookie cutter"", but is something high above the rest of the genre, then Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit is waiting. Highly Recommended!",1298851200,5,2039,4.490566037735849

I was thinking about getting this series for a friend at Xmas time.  The series is typically sold 2 discs at a time, and each 2-disc set is between $30 and $40 new (in store).  That comes to between $120 and $160 for the entire 8-disc series...

Or you could buy it all here in one shot for about $15.

I am not one to pay 8 to 10.6 times more (yes, that's the actual math) for the same product just so I can be happy about the case it came in.

And honestly, who hasn't ever bought a computer game before?  Sims 2, Civilization 4, and Half-Life 2 all came in cases with this design.  Granted, you only use all the discs once with those purchases.  But it's not like this design is unheard of.  In this instance, I wrapped the gift with 8 slim jewel cases so my friend could pull the discs out as needed and keep them somewhere, rather than messing with the case over and over again.

The story setting in Medieval Japan introduces to viewers many interesting references to Japanese culture and philosophies. Episodes usually end at some suspending scenes, just like other TV programs, to entice viewers continue on the next one, but that is when the ending music (Itoshii Hito) shrines with Sachi Tainaka's clear and calm voice in a beautiful melody.

The music is played along with a stunning video clip that starts with the half face of a main character - prince Chagum with eyes closed. The picture then gradually zooms out to reveal the grassland he stands on and the fire-scorched sky moving above, until Chagum's figure becomes small in a distance. The ripple lasts through out the clip seems to suggest Chagum's destiny under water spirit possession.....

This ending video is brief (only one and half minutes long for ending credits to run through) yet profound. It reminds me that Japanese anime is such a serious business, which has many talents contribute to its success and maturity. They are able to make an appealing production without the high-tech commonly used in American animations (like Toy Story, another master piece to me in a different way)",1290556800,4,1288,4.981395348837209

But his character manages to overcome these challenges and grow. Balsa is one of the few female characters in anime that I like. She is strong, but not invincible, but that doesn't hold her back. The supporting characters are also complex and interesting, and there are enough of them to add diversity, but not so many that they can't have time to develop.

I believe I read at one point that the world in which Balsa and Co. live in is entirely fictional, thought it draws many elements from various Asian countries. I certainly felt the Asian influence, but I couldn't say it felt like any culture in particular, which made it feel all the more real. It was very well planned and the animation really brought it to life. I enjoyed the art style for this series - it was very easy on the eyes and enjoyable to watch. It was also nice to have something that felt unique, and not like every other anime out there.

That said, this release is TERRIBLE. It looks like someone just took all of the eight individual discs and stacked them on top of each other in a single DVD case. Content is ok, the extras include clean credits and previews, but the presentation is just so cheap. I shudder to think about the next time I watch this series and have to pull out all of the DVDs every time I swap to the next one. But for $15, I guess I got what I paid for. I wouldn't have minded paying a little more for a better box, but at least I have the anime.",1287360000,5,2792,4.43859649122807
4071691,5,B0035RWG0M,this is a great movie for older kids young ones will not get what is going on.  this has action and adventure check it out!,1279584000,,123,3.92
4071692,5,B0035RWG0M,"Every once in a while, I pick out an Anime collection that surprises me in a good way. I honestly thought this was going to be more of a fighting/action Anime. While there are fights in the series, there is also much more to it. I would have thought that there was going to be a fight in every episode with plenty of bloodshed and cool moves. Boy was I wrong!

I mean this in a good way. In fact, I think this is an excellent Anime to add to anyone's collection.  Balsa is a strong, confident protagonist who is far from stereotypical in the Anime sense. There's absolutely no fan service in this story --if that's what you're looking for then you're going to be sorely disappointed. She's not giggly nor bubbly or any kind of exaggerated version of anything. It's patently refreshing.

While you'd expect Prince Chagum to be spoiled and bratty,maybe even a little whiney --he isn't. He takes his lot with cool grace and strives to find nobility in every day actions as he learns to live as a commoner. You can see him grow as both a young man, and a prince under Balsa's influence.

The other characters all provide a rich backdrop to this story come to life, making it visually appealing as well as smart, and sometimes funny. Even the minor characters get fleshed out to make them real and engaging. Balsa's past provides just as much conflict as the Prince's current situation. Even the ""Bad Guys"" aren't what they seem. It's truly an epic situation in which you feel for all those involved as they are forced to act this way out of their duty. You even feel for the Mikado --forced to kill his own son because they believe he's possessed by a water demon.

If you want to watch something intelligent and entertaining, I'd surely recommend this to anyone without hesitation.",1274745600,93,1778,4.526479750778816
8389234,3,B0035RWG0M,"The show is great, but the original DVD set (released in the US on June 7, 2011) is so badly INTERLACED that you can't 'decrapify' it even with the best deinterlacing software on the planet, unless you compromise on your HD homemade copy. That just kills all the pleasure of watching the anime because now it looks like flickering blinds on any HDTV. Do I have to buy a pre-Y2K tube TV to see it 'normal' and enjoy it or go for the Blu-ray version? Come on guys, offer us a nicely redigitized version for the 21st century! ;-)",1527638400,,526,4.3232323232323235

8389238,5,B0035RWG0M,"I'm going to make this comparison: ""Moribito"" is like an anime ""Game of Thrones""! It's got magic, martial arts, and palace intrigue... it is also one of the most BEAUTIFUL anime series I've ever seen! Kenji Kamiyama is a brilliant and experienced director, and has dipped the audience into a world of royals, peasants, and Balsa. She's a martial artist--a spear-wielder like her father. She's also 30 years old, and how many adults star in anime? I couldn't spoil the plot if I wanted to: 26 elaborately worked-out beautifully drawn action-filled episodes of world-building.

There are homemade viral videos online that are better quality. If poor quality doesn't bother you, then go ahead and buy it. I want to enjoy this series in its full glory, however.
