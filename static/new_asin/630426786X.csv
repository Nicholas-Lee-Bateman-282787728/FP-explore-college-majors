821683,5,630426786X,"A unique film ,to be sure, blending Christian, Greek and Native American mythological semiotics with mise en scenes inspired by Fredric Remington, Bev Doolittle and CM Russel. Possibly Director Jamarsh(sp) finest film.  Extremely hypnotic and surreal while also brutal, funny and poetic.  Featuring a once in a lifetime cast of contemporary character actors, this  film is to be sought out and savored. Also captures the Coastal Indian  Culture- a feature not usually highlighted in the southwestern-centric  western films of old.",927590400,2,530,5.575

821685,5,630426786X,"This film I saw about a year and a half ago, and it's impression has done nothing but grow. Jarmusch takes thoughts and bleeds them into sights and sounds like many try but few succeed. He as been not only an influence in  my writing, but also a sense of affirmation in my own style. I believe in  staying true to the notion, and not letting the artistic part of your  message overshadow the statement itself. This is something that is quite  difficult, and I feel Jarmusch has found the formula, not only with this  film, but also with other greats such as ""Down By Law"" and  ""Mystery Train"". A true visionary, but visionaries are more  common than one that can share their vision with a minimum of pretension  and self indulgence. Thank you Jim!",922665600,,747,4.481481481481482

821687,5,630426786X,"Johnny Depp and Gary Farmer are utterly brilliant. This movie is actually about the soul's journey after death - Blake's death represented by ""leaving Cleveland,"" the mundane world or life as we know it, and  entering a kind of Hell (the town of Machine) where the Devil (Mitchum as  Dickinson) rejects him. Like Dante he picks up a Virgil-type guide, Gary  Farmer as Nobody (read the real William Blake's poems sometime and look for  the Nobody reference) who guides him through hell, defending him from the  other damned souls who wish to consume him, until he can pass through the  ocean of light to...where?  Brilliant, brilliant movie.",917481600,5,640,4.925233644859813
821688,5,630426786X,"This film has gone widely unnoticed, but who would have expected any different. A film of ideas and indictments, Dead Man is perhaps one of the most important films of the last 10 years. The reasons are many in number,  but simply put, the film redefines the western as an imperialist mode,  while demonstrating that our ideas about how our country arose are  generally based on myth and deception. The film deals with the American  Genocide of the Native Americans, and our own savagery of materialism.  Anyone vaguely interested in understanding american history's plethora of  frontier myths should see this film as soon as possible. By the way, Johnny  Depp gives a wonderful and subtle performance.",916272000,,703,5.008620689655173

It's overly drawn out (two hours?) to compensate for a lack of plot and action, all of the gunshots and injuries are laughably fake looking and the whole movie feels like it was directed by a college student who called in a lot of favors to get so many notable actors involved.

822033,5,630426786X,"A powerful, and sad western-noir (not sure if I've seen one of those before) about the violent last few days of a normal (albeit very unlucky) man's life.  Gary Farmer co-stars, and completely steals the show, but it really makes sense, because the story is equally about him.  At its core, it's about a man who's lost all connection with conventional American society, but before death, has found a very important friend, who takes him on a spirit quest in his last few remaining days.  It's infinitely more respectful of Native American society than other 'white man goes native' movies, and goes to great lengths to show the evil and wrongness in white society, especially on the 1800's frontier.

The main downside of the film is it sort of flounders to an overly drawn out finish in the last 15 minutes, but despite that I feel it's a very strong movie.  4.5/5 stars.",1496620800,2,872,4.673202614379085

A stranger in a strange land, this is Johnny Depp's best role of his career as William Blake. He discovers connection and friendship, not among those of his own cultural background, but with an outcast, wonderfully portrayed by Gary Farmer, my favorite character in the movie. The sound track is intense and accentuates the experiential atmosphere of ""being there"". So many striking cameos of an all star cast, other Fellini-like characters,symbolism and humor.

Everything goes downhill from there. Not having any money, he goes to the home of a prostitute. Her boyfriend comes and shoots the woman and him. The bullet lodges next to his heart and cannot be removed. He kills the man. He has pain from the bullet wound. The man's father, a rich man, puts out a reward to bring him back dead or alive. The father hires strange gunmen to find him and has wanted posters posted all over, including in the forest. He ends up killing many people. He joins with an Indian who insists that he be called Nobody. The Indian, who is very fat, and acts in a bizarre way, thinks that he is a poet who happens to have the same name that he has.
The film has good acting, all of the characters in the film are strange, and the film is funny. One can read all kinds of ideas into the unusual film. Once one begins to watch it, it is hard to stop.",1490313600,,1028,4.165829145728643
822037,5,630426786X,"a commercial flop upon release, and generally dismissed by ""professional"" critics of the 20th century (you know: those dying dinosaurs that got paid for what we all do online for free now).  a bit of a sensation internationally and on the film festival circuit in its time, Dead Man now seems to be getting at least some of the appreciation it always deserved as a modern Western classic.

i would call this Jim Jarmusch's best work to date (said work can be hit-or-miss, but the highs are extremely high, and this one soars).  Dead Man is moody and dynamic, like the ""alternative"" '90s whence it sprang.

Johnny Depp usually strikes me as cartoonish and/or pretentious.  here, he tilts cartoon at times, but manages to hit sophistication without the pretense.  solid campfire cameo by Iggy Pop and Billy Bob Thornton.

the show is stolen by the character Nobody and the actor that portrays him.  classic quotables abound.

Definitely a western, but with a much deeper meaning, it pulls a lot of its philosophy more from the perspective of different Native American cultures. That in itself is refreshing. It's very much a stream-of-consciousness film that doesn't tell you what is happening; you know about as much as William Blake. So you have to look at it from his perspective.

Filmed in a crisp B&W, J Depp gives a decent performance as the fish out of water until he starts to realize maybe he needs to act as the Romans do 'When in Rome'...and his simple accountant persona turns to survival and killer instinct as he encounters colorful and eccentric characters along the way. I enjoyed the soundtrack too, although overdone and monotonous at times, very period correct for this movie. Lots of big name actors and graphic scenery will keep you engaged from beginning to end.

Shot in the chest, Blake comes across a native American (""Nobody"") who mistakes Blake for the poet by the same name.  ""Nobody"" helps Blake make his journey to the spirit world.

Depp brings his usual comedic slant to the film.  Despite the morbid subject (death a la William Blake), he manages to elicit a laugh or two as his aim is improved by removing his glasses (I guess you're a better killer if you're less civilized).  There is an interest-sustaining evolution of Depp's character:  first, as he travels from the civilization represented by Cleveland (the east) to the wild west of the Pacific coast, the physical trip mirrors the slow progression towards his death, guided by ""Nobody"" who he meets along the way; then, as he improves his ""poetic bent for killing"" in response to the events that transpire.  To quote Nobody, ""that weapon will replace your tongue. You will learn to speak through it. And your poetry will now be written with blood.""

Jarmusch has a certain style that is both funny and tragic- his trademark it seems (at least in the movies of his that I've seen). Very entertaining. The Indian was especially fun.

Not exactly sure how to describe this movie; maybe it was too artsy for me; or maybe it was just a dumb movie!  I found it to be depressing, sluggish, grisly, and grimy (kind of a mild Stephen King yarn set in the Old West).  The only theme that was consistent through out the film was the grimy characters shooting each other.  Not sure how much talent it took to play the William Blake role, other than looking bewildered most of the time.  The only possible bright spot was the character Nobody, and I almost cheered when Depp said he didn't understand and was tired of Nobody's Indian malarkey. The bright spots were Robert Mitchum and John Hurt. Just couldn't get in sync with the message in this film, if there was a message.

You have to open your mind to this film and listen deeply to what is being told in the dialogue. This is a spiritual journey of a man who lost everything in the hopes of a good life and was struck with bad luck. When he thinks things cannot become any worse he is caught up in a shootout and then blamed for murder when he was only defending himself. On the run he is befriended by a spirit guide. ""Nobody"", who teaches him to open his mind to the spirit world and find his path to peace. Along this journey he is faced with jilted characters of ignorance, greed, and pure evil in which he must persevere and rise above these wolves that are out for his blood. I absolutely love this film and the style of story telling it portrays and in a way is a bit of a dark psychedelic comedy. I was deeply immersed the entire time and ""got it"". If you do not understand metaphors, poetry, or spiritual meanings, this movie is definitely not for you as it evokes spiritual thought at times.

826093,5,630426786X,"Spoilers, I guess. The best film of all time, pure and simple. I do not own it, but have seen it many times on different occasions. It's one of the very few films I want to own. It embodies so many things in life and death that it's absolutely, brilliantly transcendent. It's a quest from spiritual and literal death towards rebirth,  one man's journey from the dregs and darkness of civilization where one's soul is devalued and torn away from nature and souls of others, into the light of understanding and becoming one with the nature and the Earth, and the world beyond the mortal existence. It's black and white visuals and Neil Young's tormented guitar perfectly mirror that in-between-the-worlds feverish state of mind, that dying consciosness that goes in and out of focus, as the mortally wounded protagonist loses touch with reality and his fears, and his social awkwardness, his innocence, despair and desire to live are replaced by things that are truly important-finding courage and tranquility within, willingness to open his eyes and see that what he considered light was darkness, and what he considered the void and the ultimate end is light.

 When I saw this film at the age of 14, I was angry that everyone uses the poor wretch Blake for their own gain, and he just eventually gives up, considering even his guide towards the lands beyond, the Native American loner aptly named Nobody, does not attempt to save Blake's life, instead troubling himself with aiding his passing....but I see it differently now. First of all, the spirit guide is supposed to do just that-aid in safe passing. Second, if Blake  could survive, treat his wounds, and recover, he would not have been enlightened. And the only way for him to see that death is nothing but the journey into a  different plane of existence, and that aches and pains and wants and conflicts and cruel perversions of a modern man are nothing in comparison with the eternal and with the universe, was to die.

 He has no place in a petty scheme of life once he has been shocked into awakening. The way he is lead, without given the chance to change his fate and eventually, without wanting to change his fate, is used to show  us, the viewers, that no matter how much we struggle, we can't ""rule"" our lives. We are not our makers or rulers of our bodies, we get shot and killed and die of other causes and the only thing we can change is our spirit, is how we see things, how we perceive and interact with the inevitable, the only thing we can do is to make immediate, simple, almost instinctive decisions of hopefully correct nature in this life which is what dying Blake resorts to in the end of it all. He shoots to kill without concerning himself with fear of death-he is already as good as dead. He shoots to kill because his pursuers are as good as dead, too. Everyone is heading towards the inevitable -not tragic, just inevitable- part of the journey, and as he proceeds towards the end of his quest, we can see how the borders between life and death are distinct in the ""civilized"" town of the Machine, filled with drunks, prostitutes, destitutes and borderline psychopaths, -death is punished by law, avenged, and greatly feared-and how these borders blend as he enters the Native American territory, where death is perceived as a part of life, not in any way worse than living itself.

There are a lot more things to say about this beautiful masterpiece, especially the ""incarnation"" of the poet William Blake that Nobody believes the protagonist to be (William Blake has also become highly spiritually attuned/enlightened, and, I believe, saw God and a host of angles on his deathbed as he approached his own end without fear), of course, it's dark humour, the fact that wonderful Johnny Depp and funny and crass Iggy Pop are in it, and Gabriel Byrne, who unfortunately is disposed of in a very speedy fashion,  and there are much better reviewers out there whose first language is actually English :-) and who are a lot more eloquent and descriptive but I just had to say how much I love this film. It's truly new mythology for a modern man.",1459209600,,4126,4.6707988980716255

826521,4,630426786X,"This is a haunting little piece. Set in the Old West, the narrative of this film is made up of quirky vignettes of wounded fugitive Johnny Depp wandering through the wilderness encountering various Western stereotypes, most of them trying to kill him (an eccentric cast of bounty hunters include Jarmusch favorites Iggy Pop, Billy Bob Thornton, et al). Strung together, the vignettes reveal nothing less than a man coming to terms with his own death...though he seems to be the last to know it. One might even surmise that the protagonist dies early in the film and the rest is a dream. The viewer is left to his own devices to interpret. No spoiler alert needed here, the title of the film, Dead Man, says it all.

Shot in black and white it evokes the great Westerns of the 40s but with a modernist spin that includes emotionally detached violence, ironic humor, and an offbeat soundtrack of Neil Young's strange metallic guitar musings on a Western theme. The combination of these elements, not to mention Johnny Depp's transformation from likable Innocent Dude into as likeable Wanted Man cold blooded killer, create a stark commentary on the harshness of The West.

Dead Man has a way of getting under the skin, one of those movies that stay with you, the memory of it perhaps better than the actual viewing of it. Though sometimes off-putting by some of Jarmusch's straining for hipness like all of his films, this film holds up on its own as cinematic poetry. Perhaps it is the iconic nature of The Western and the magnificent landscape cinematography inspired by Ansel Adams and Depp's engaging performance (that does not strain for hipness) that work so well on the subconscious. Whatever the case, this one hits the mark and kudos should be given to all its participants. It might even get better with age and emerge as Jarmusch's masterpiece when he is done.",1433116800,2,1869,4.78328173374613

Maybe, then, it is like a Pink Floyd album, all of it, where you just sit there comfortably numb, but totally into it.

The short plot, which is at once somehow integral to the movie and non-essential, is that Johnny Depp's character, William Blake, accepts a job which takes him from home in Cleveland out west. Turns out he arrived later than the boss was expecting, and his job had already gone to another guy. Blake is off on his own without any money.

He gets caught up with another man's girl, and kills that man in self-defense. Unfortunately, the way the authorities, and more importantly, the man's powerful father, think is different, and gunmen are hired to take Blake out.

Good, or, depending on how you see it, bad luck ascends onto Blake when a well-read Indian mistakes Blake as THE William Blake, the real poet and artist. The Indian helps Blake, and things progress into him (Blake) killing others along the way.

It feels something like Voltaire's ""Candide,"" and it as realistic in the midst of absurdity. While the movie is occasionally humorous, it carries a dark overtone through to the end.

A slew of great actors are in it, including Gary Farmer, Billy Bob Thornton, Iggy Pop, Crispin Glover, John Hurt, Michael Wincott, Lance Henriksen, Gabriel Byrne, and Robert Mitchum (his last film).

If you are looking for a quirky Johnny Depp movie with a go-lucky ending, this is not it. It is rich but not always clear. I loved it.

826937,3,630426786X,"Johnny Depp 'is' the Dead Man.  The premise is mildly comical, that he is mistaken for the poet William Blake, by an American Indian (who, in turn is mystified no end that Johnny doesn't remember his own poetry.)  Now this is compounded by the innocent ignorance that can sometimes beget racial stereotyping, only it's dramatized in reverse by this story, in that his Indian friend literally not only doesn't imagine two people sharing the same name, but hasn't assimilated the realization of vast population blocks sharing similar family names.

It was actually one of the better comedic reliefs of the picture when the Indian is describing how as a youth he'd been out hunting and been captured by the British.  They then proceeded to take him with them from one colonial city to the next as an exhibit.  He marvels that all the people in the first city and all their families magically packed up everything and rebuilt and populated the next city before he arrives, (all the same people) and then the next city and the next one after that.  And only after being taken to England and learning to read does he discover in the voice of the poet William Blake, a kindred spirit.

Whereas many of the Hollywood westerns seemed to showcase very sparse elements of plot, thinly disguised as protests against the absence of  gun control during the settlement of the American west, Dead Man wallows in the barbarous anti-social climate of which projectile weapons were only one more tool among many follies.  Discrimination and prejudice run rampant, but prostitution, gambling, looting, murder and all manner of debauchery are swilling through the social outpost where Mr. Blake touches ground.  (Replete with -R- rated content.)

It's a Sadd-Sack kind of a tale, where cannibalism, burning outposts, Indian villages, settlements and skeletons litter the landscape to an extent that if the film weren't filmed all black and white the gore would compete with Chicago stock yards.  I can't imagine another actor craftsman (besides Johnny Depp), who could deliver as many well punctuated literary puns (not quotes) with such a straight face.  Three and a half stars for comedic merit, brilliant cinematography, and rawhide sound track.  Be forewarned, too many grotesqueries to watch while dining.",1420761600,2,2289,5.053191489361702

This is indeed one of the best movies of all time, and one of Jim Jarmusch's best. I highly recommend every minute of this film. 5 stars all the way.

The blu-ray, however, has a big problem. The sound and picture are great, but about halfway into the film, the color tint of the black and white picture begins to change at random intervals. It goes from a neutral black and white to a purple tint, then back to neutral, then to a green tint. This happens more and more frequently as the movie goes on.

This won't be it.  It's a postmodern revisionist tale that happens to be set in the far western US during the late 19th Century.

The story is about the journey of William Blake (Johnny Depp) who shows up in a town called Machine to accept an accountant's job he was offered (by letter) at a local factory only to be told to get lost at gunpoint as the job was filled. That night, after being taken in by a young woman he meets on the street, the man who considers himself her ""fiance"" shows up and shoots at Blake, but the woman moves to protect him an is killed. Blake and the man shoot at each other, with the intruder being killed and Blake mortally wounded, becoming a ""walking dead"" slowly dying from the wound. Blake flees the town on the intruder's horse; he turns out to be the son of the factory owner who hires guns to track Blake down and posts a reward for him. A Native American who calls himself  Nobody (Gary Farmer) finds Blake and thinks he's the noted British poet William Blake (he's not). Nobody had resided for a while in England, and came to revere his poetry which he has memorized and recites passages from. He knows Blake will die soon from his wound and assists by taking him on a final journey to aid him in reaching the next life (spirit world) out of admiration, respect and reverence (of who he thinks is the British poet).

The entire mood of the movie is dark with a noir character, containing dreamlike scenes, Some critics characterize it as ""acid"" or ""psychedelic"" but I prefer surreal. Blake is mortally wounded with bouts of delirium and dizziness and we see many of the events in his scenes from this perspective. The journey encounters numerous challenges and obstacles. It does an excellent job of realistically depicting the far west and northwest in that era, particularly as it relates to Native Americans and their culture. Comic relief is provided by alternating between absurdities delivered deadpan, and very dry sarcasm and witticisms. The movie is as much about Nobody's quest to see Blake properly sent off to the spirit world as it is about Blake's metamorphosis from an eastern ""white collar"" office professional to a Native American who becomes one with the nature around him during the journey from his train ride to the town of Machine to the end of the film. It's laden with symbolism everywhere, some of which is blatant such as the town's name of Machine and Nobody's name, and some of it's subtle in the poetry passages.

Pitch any expectations of what this film should be out the window and enjoy it for what it is, a postmodern revisionist Western that contains a moving tale about Nobody's quest to facilitate Blake's journey to the spirit world.",1398988800,4,2881,4.619140625

***
Not every scene or passage worked at a four star level for me -- but. enough of the film did. This was one that stayed with me long after viewing.

Jim Jarmusch is, I suppose, an acquired taste. Many find his films lacking in plot and feel nothing 'happens' in them. There is possibly more ""action"" in Dead Man than many of his films, I suppose, but that said, I think the narrative of these films tend not to be reliant on the traditional idea of action or plot.

The opening sequence -- on a train heading West -- was key: economical, humorous, terrifying. An almost entirely visual foretelling of the entire film. A journey from ""civilized"" to ""savage"" and then, to -- ""salvation"", perhaps.

Black and white, when used well, can afford a richness, depth and mystery that may be compromised by color. It suited this mythical film about identity, self discovery -- mortality. There is a lean, stark quality to Dead Man that works best -- I think -- at its leanest and starkest, so that the weakest part was the flurry of cameos.

The three principal characters: William Blake (Johnny Depp), Nobody (Gary Farmer) and the landscape are all quite memorable. Jarmusch uses Depp's rather delicate androgyny and his quiet minimalism to great effect. Farmer's Nobodybegins  (appropriately) as rather a cypher -- Blake tells him he doesn't understand him -- and in many ways neither does the viewer. But as time passes -- his words, action and Blake's fate all become clearer.

The land these travelers pass though is harsh, lush, treacherous and gorgeous. Like life. And possibly death -- and the film.

Oh yeah -- the soundtrack. Neil Young. WOW. Four ****",1394150400,,1664,4.737024221453288

If you like mainstream cowboy stuff this ain't for you. If the odd, or bizarre is entertaining, and you like straight up electric guitar go for it. About that last, Neil Young of all people did the soundtrack. It is some of the best striped down work he has ever done. He is obviously playing Old Black (pretty much a 53 Gibson Less Paul, heavily modified, it sounds lovely), there are no vocals, no pushy keyboardists, nothing but guitar.

This movie has wonderful moments of tension and anticipation...reminds me of the Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns at times. There are no heroes...only bad people. Some start out empty but all fall victim to the horrors that men are capable of. Sometimes our path in life is chosen for us, especially if we are incapable or unwilling to chose it ourselves. One of my favorite Johnny Depp movies. If you can't appreciate the beauty of darkness, if you can't appreciate the art of tension and suspense or the bleak world of black and white...if art is lost on fast pace and explosive action...this movie is not for you.

827993,5,630426786X,"I am not sure if is is e venue for film theory, but I would like to entertain the other reviewers here win revision, or correction of a misconception that may or may not exist. The misconception is that William Blake, Johnny Depp, is alive. I prefer to think about this film as another heart of darkness, or apocalypse now., in that the soldier, the warrior, the lost soul, is already dead. Blake is essentially dead and the train ride,in a way becomes less and less civil, but all are on the train. The riders change as the tran gets further and further into the ""wilderness"" which represents the psyche as much as the physical journey. ( Blake, incidentally, is no stranger to the psyche and the twist of fit and wrong - which Jarmish does nicely to his audience- who want Depp to survive- even as he becomes the best murderer in the wilderness, with the highest bounty n his head.

To continue, The dark faced figure, representative of a Charon, the ferryman, or perhaps beezelbob, properly identifies Blake and then is amazed that he is headed for the last stop - machine, which is a nice representation of the inner depths of hell with its smoke filling, resource destroying, machine pounding, melted making, labyrinth, called dickensons. Where Blake has been fumbling around and losing his way - between heaven and hell - in the words of Blake.

The movie is really a journey with Blake coming to grips with the loss of his parents, his love and probably own, mental and physical suicide. The movie, then becomes Blake's journey to find peace in e horrors of his deals and to indeed become whole again so that he can go to where the spirits are. Machine is his purgatory.

The last part of the movie, again resembling the station in apocalypse now, ends at a very strange India outpost that is more of a cemetery, or launching place for the souls who have made the journey. The very last scene shows Blake's heaven angel (nobody) and his devil ( bounty hunter/killer) both shown in representative colors, dark vs light, killing themselves and in essence becoming unifying e conflict inside Blake between heaven and hell and innocence and experience. The race between the two ends, and Blake is able to take his final voyage.

That is why it gets 5 stars. It's really well done. I would say not perfect, but e music does fit.",1377993600,4,2330,4.607228915662651

828297,5,630426786X,"Recently I saw a list of Top Ten Westerns of all time.  It might have been Entertainment Weekly's list.  I was familiar with all on the list except one.  I had never heard of ""Dead Man.""  Amazon had it cheap, so I bought it.  Here's the deal.  Johnny Depp plays a milquetoast accountant from Cleveland riding the train to a town call Machine, somewhere on the American frontier in the mid-19th century.  For the first 6 or 7 minutes there is no dialog.  Just William Blake (Depp) looking around at the passenger car filled with buffalo hunters.  The contrast is stark.  A wire-rimmed-glasses-wearing Blake complete in his city-slicker suit and hat in the company of brusk, long-haired hunters with rifles in hand.

When Blake gets to Machine to begin his job he learns from the supervisor, John Hurt, that since it took him 2 months to get there, the job went to another.  This is confirmed by the company's owner (Robert Mitchum, in his last American feature film), who throws Blake out at gunpoint.  Broke and without work, Blake helps out an abused flower salesgirl (and likely part time prostitute) played by Mili Avital.  She pays back the favor by sleeping with Blake.  They are interrupted by her former boyfriend Charlie Dickinson, son of Mitchum's character.  Things go downhill from there.  Charlie kills the girl but the bullet goes through and lodges in Blake's chest.  Blake manages to kill Charlie but is now a hunted killer.

Still seriously wounded, Blake escapes on Charlie's pinto but passes out in the hills.  When he awakens he finds a large Indian called Nobody (very humorous Gary Farmer) who is unable to dig out the bullet as it lies too close to Blake's heart.  This begins a constant point of conversation throughout the film.  Does Blake have any tobacco?  He is constantly explaining to everyone who asks - and that's everybody he meets - that he doesn't smoke but that doesn't alter their constant requests for tobacco.

Blake and Nobody, now buddies, are on the run from 3 hired guns, all mean and fearsome with Lance Henriksen's Cole Wilson the meanest.  Others are played by Eugene Boyd and Michael Wincott.  Another trio that shows up along the way is Iggy Pop, a cross-dressing ""Sally"" Jenko, Jared Harris as Benmont Tench (named after one of Tom Petty's Heartbreakers) and Big George Drakoulious played by Billy Bob Thornton.  As a footnote you will find many of these characters are named after people in the music industry.  I suspect that may have something to do with the fact that Neil Young handles the musical score in the film, and it's a dandy.  Throughout the film, Young interjects his mournful electric guitar.  Catch the bonus music video for a nice film recap featuring Young.  You might even see some plot points clarified.

""Dead Man"" features goodly amounts of humor throughout the film.  In one scene the 3 bad guys chasing Blake go on for a couple minutes about how one of them has had his fly open and nobody called it to his attention.  In another, 3 supposed ruffians marvel at how soft William Blake's hair is.  ""How do you get it like that?"" one asks.  I'm shortchanging Farmer's Nobody.  He feels a closeness to Blake but some of that is due to the fact that he believes Blake is the famous British poet, whose work he studied while spending a few boyhood years in London.  The movie has many jokes, some I got, some I'm sure I didn't catch.

Directed by Jim Jarmusch who is probably best known for ""Broken Flowers"" with Bill Murray, the movie is a winner.  The photography is terrific.  Shot in black and white, several scenes are stunning beautiful, including one where the characters traverse through a winter time forest filled with what I think are white Aspen trees.  I will also suggest that this is one of Depp's best performances.  He is always good at playing out of the ordinary characters and this is no exception.

The Blu ray transfer, as suggested earlier, is first rate.  With video resolution at 1080p the aspect ratio is 1.78:1.  The black and white film has excellent contrast and boasts fine detail with no video noise.  The audio come in DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0.  Overall I would say it is acceptable.  It is nothing special and is inconsistent at times.  Other than the music video, there are a few deleted scenes and that's it.  Granted, the film isn't for everyone, but if you're looking for something well made and out of the mainstream, check it out.  I loved it.",1373414400,12,4449,4.6895213454075035

Starts with a man leaving the ""Lake Eerie""  (purposely spelled that way) area, talking to another passenger on a train to answer a job as an ""accountant"", and winds up accounting for for more than he ever could have imagined.

Pay attention to every word, every image. This isn't a movie you'll understand by half watching & the plot isn't spoon-fed.

Best movie I've seen in years! I don't know how this jewel was missed by main-stream media. Sad some critics missed the entire point, the symbolism, and even the comedy in the movie as Depp's character takes this journey.

A deep movie that takes you on a journey, IF you let it & have some understanding of the subject matter. Beautifully done.

If cable TV had movie movies like this, I might not have cancelled my cable. We need more movies like this & less mindless, spoon-fad garbage in mainstream media.

828465,5,630426786X,"Spiritual ecstasy or too much early reading of the poetry of William Blake? There has to be some organic explanation for the bizarre genius of Jim Jarmusch. At one point in ""Dead Man"" the rotund and orotund Indian ""Nobody,"" acted by Gary Farmer, ingests something hallucinatory which he withholds from the wounded greenhorn accountant William Blake (Johnny Depp) on the basis that Blake isn't yet ready for a vision quest. ""Nobody"" quotes the poetry of the original William Blake as blithely as Jarmusch's later mystic mouthpiece ""Ghost Dog"" quotes Jotaro's ""The Art of the Warrior."" In several ways ""Dead Man"" is in fact a black-and-white artistic prelude to the more popular ""Ghost Dog."" But the black-and-white makes it prettier as well as more bizarre. ""Nobody"" has his own vision of Blake's spiritual destiny as a killer of stupid white men.

I'm familiar enough - academically, of course - with peyote to have a strong suspicion that Jim Jarmusch has had psychedelic experiences. ""Dead Man"" is as convincing a psychedelic trip as any film ever made. I'd strenuously advice anyone who thinks of dropping a psychedelic and watching this film NOT to do so. The film doesn't need help, but you may.

And that's all I want to say about this gorgeous comedy of ghastliness. It's already 16 years old, with almost 400 reviews. You'll either love it or hate it. The fewer requirements and expectations you bring to it, the more you're likely to love it.",1357689600,2,1451,4.894308943089431

828470,3,630426786X,"Jim Jarmusch's 1995 film DEAD MAN is set sometime in the late 19th century, when the young accountant William Blake (Johnny Depp) leaves his native Cleveland to take up a job in the Western frontier town of Machine. When he arrives, the position has been already been filled and his would-be employer John Dickinson (Robert Mitchum, in his last role) refuses to offer him anything else. When Blake is caught up in a gruesome scandal and has to flee the town, the Native American outcast Nobody (Gary Farmer) shelters him and, as the audience gradually becomes aware, guides him through the wilderness towards a mysterious destination.

The director himself termed DEAD MAN a ""psychedelic Western"", and Jarmusch's subversions of the Western genre are jarring. The film portrays the true violence of the old West and the lack of any real law and order. In that respect it can be compared to Cormac McCarthy's modern classic BLOOD MERIDIAN, a novel that held up violence as the overriding principle of America's westward expansion. Native Americans are depicted with their real tribal diversity and spiritual beliefs, not as the caricatures of old films.

But along with the realism of the film, there are surreal elements. In a reversal, it is white missionaries who are depicted tongue-in-cheek as ridiculous stereotypes. Then there are the literary allusions: Nobody is familiar with the poetry of William Blake, reciting it at various points in the film, and he believes Depp's character to be either a reincarnation of the poet, or the man himself. A team of bounty hunters includes an African American with no racial conflict among them. Reflecting its international cast, the film is a mishmash of American, English and other foreign accents without little attempt to hide them.

In the years leading up to DEAD MAN, Jarmusch had released a series of films dealing mainly with life on the outskirts of American cities. This film, however, stands far apart from his work to date (2012). Only the amusing chit-chat of three homosexual ruffians (one of which is played by Iggy Pop) has a recognizable Jarmusch touch.

Though DEAD MAN aims higher than any of Jarmusch's other efforts up to the time, I count it as one of the director's least successful films. The pacing is not as tight as it could have been, and by the end there are somewhat sloppy moments (namely as Depp walks through a Native American village). The soundtrack by Neil Young, really just noodlings that Neil Young recorded on guitar while watching the final cut, is also a disappointment. Finally, I take issue with Jarmusch's decision to revert to black and white after his stunning transition to colour in his preceding two films. Not only does the B&W format drain the Western landscape of its poetry, essential for any Western, but it obscures much detail in the scenes to the point of annoyance, as if the decision to go with B&W was an afterthought instead of a core aspect of the cinematography.

Still, film buffs will probably find even this Jarmusch disappointment worth seeing, along with the rest of the auteur's work.",1352332800,2,3101,4.932950191570881
828579,5,630426786X,"The film is pure poetry and it revolves around poetry, and I should not even have to explain it because of the name of the main character, ""William Blake"". It is Jarmusch's way of delivering William Blake's work through cinema. And the setting he chose was the 1800's in the United States. So this is pretty much the homage of American westerns, oppose to a Spaghetti Western, as far as the setting goes. Overall, this film is for true cinephiles and people who appreciate arthouse-esque films. I do not recommend this to people who think of those ""fast-paced and abundance of action sequences"" Western genre(nothing wrong with that genre, but this film is completely different than those ""action western films""). And it definitely is a slow-paced film so try to go in with an open-mind and enjoy the beautiful mixture of William Blake's poetry, the American Western genre, and of course Jim Jarmusch's brilliant vision.

828580,4,630426786X,"The more I go into this movie, Dead Man, the more I understand that its shamanism parallels that of Marechera's short, episodic book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Sunlight/dp/0143026208/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Sunlight</a>.

Some precise parallels:

1. The extremely choppy, episodic nature of the filmic (Jarmusch) and written (Marechera) texts. This speaks to the way the mind sleeps, then wakes up and continues on its narrative. It's the shamanistic movement between the rational daytime awareness and irrational  sleep, a dialectic necessary to keep life going. This is faithful to the way we actually experience our lives: by going to sleep and the next day necessarily recreating the original narrative of the path on which we're bound. This pertains to the functions of our deep subjectivity and to natural bodily rhythms.

2. The encounters with extreme violence and death as a poignant and mesmerizing aspect of life. Society is changing order and there is violence all around. In Marechera's narrative anti-colonial riots, anarchy and war relentlessly assault the psyche as expressions of violence and resistance.

3. To be blind or without normal vision is represented as a different way of seeing more clearly. Lacking vision, one is dependent on the visceral senses. Instinct then predominates, after it has learned how to exert its intrinsic force. In Black Sunlight, Marie's blindness represents a shamanic way of seeing. Death presses in more viscerally, in that it reaches on through the faculty of smell, rather than knowledge or visual perception. In Dead Man, the Indian guide Nobody suggests that his charge would see better without spectacles. This turns out to be true, in that he can use his pistol more effectively without clear vision.

4. The episodes show nothing more than several consecutive plunges into a state of greater proximity to death, matched with a greater awareness of the immediacy, strangeness and fragility of life. This polarization of the distinctive elements of life, highlighted the contrasts between life and death, is a key feature of shamanistic doubling.

5. One moves from a world of logic and violence to a world of flowing organic unity. In the Jarmusch movie, one moves from a failed attempt to integrate with socially-defined reality in a town called Machine. Since one cannot become part of The Machine, one is compelled to die. In Marechera's novel, Chris joins with other social drop-outs at Devil's End. Jarmusch's protagonist, William Blake, meets his Indian protector, Nobody, only after receiving a bullet close to his heart. Thus, a shamanic wound sets the protagonist apart from the rest of society in each case. He starts to see reality differently, above all historical reality, through his wound.

6. In Jarmusch's film, Nobody gives Blake the initiatory drug, Peyote. After this, Blake sees the effects of the colonial war against the Indians all around him, but the violence cannot touch him as he is impermeable. In Black Sunlight, apocalyptic shamanic visions at the climax of the novel. They are later explained, as if denied, by the protagonist, who had become the double of himself, Christian, having taken ""Chris' psychiatric drugs"".

7. Marechera's protagonist is represented early in the book as a court jester, hanging upside down in a chicken-coup due to having offended the Great Chief. This is political satire, but is also a way of depicting the state of the uninitiated soul with his own superego. The author views himself as being condemned to be tortured and the source of this condemnation is political. The refrain of ""stupid white man"" expresses the political irony of Dead Man.

8. In Marechera's novel, the protagonist-author, reunited with himself finally, as one, ends up showing the whiteness of his bones by effectively releasing all the words out of his body through his wrists. Rain pours down as overabundant meaning. Everything is liquefied  This is indicative of shamanic ritual in facing death and finding unity with oneself through resignation. In Dead Man, Indians dress up Blake's dying body after he has been shot a second time, so that he can complete his journey on the other side of the mirror image of reality he has entered. This signifies that he can become one with himself again, on the surface of liquid (unconscious) (mental) processes.

9. Both texts suggest solutions to political and social problems (colonial domination and machine-like attitudes) by going more deeply into death. This is a means for detachment and shamanistic dissociation, by virtue of which, one sees historical reality more clearly.

10. In both texts, transgression of the normal social law is a result of accident, not deliberate. Blake's killing of a member of the Town of Machine (a mechanistic world) is an act of self-defense. In addition, his being framed for the murder of another member of the town gave him an outlaw identity that was incongruous with his inner attitude or intent. Marechera similarly shows how his protagonist becomes a revolutionary despite himself, because he has been driven mad by social norms. Shamanism is thus shown to be a state of primeval (but not historical) innocence, in the face of attributed social and political guilt.",1350432000,2,5315,5.275739644970415

828583,5,630426786X,"If you are not familiar with Jim Jarmusch's other films, you may view Dead Man from the wrong angle.  Jarmusch is one of my favorite directors due to his individualized approach to films.  They are not about straight plots and endings that sum everything up.  There is always great acting, and fantastic cameo appearances, and each film has a soundtrack that is intense and assists in the telling of the story.  You will wonder about them long after viewing them, wondering....  That is part of the fun.  Do not expect a typical Hollywood movie - I have no problem with those types of movies, just making sure that the difference is noted.
In Dead Man, there is more of a linear story than in any of his other films.  It is a tale of life, death and returning to wherever we all came from.  The interactions between the characters tells you more about each character than any form of back-story or individual development during the movie.  You need to accept them all as they are in the moment, not who they were or who they will become.  Usage of imagery, poetry (a bit of knowledge of Wiliam Blake helps, as Johnny Depp's character shares his name), and music (thank you Neil Young)shed some light on what issues are the true meaning of the story.
This is not a pretty movie...it has more grit than you may have ever seen.  Neil Young's savage guitar work sets the edge and discomfort that the movie is meant to impart.  Not a date movie.  Better off viewing this alone...late at night, no lights on, and a decent sound system.  If you are feeling frustrated after watching it, read up on it on IMDB or other review sites to gain some insight into what you just experienced.  I do not reccomend doing so prior to watching.  Find out what you get from it first.  You just might like it, and if so it is time to move on to Jarmusch's other films.
Did I mention that among the other treasures in this film, you get Iggy Pop wearing a praire dress and bonnet?",1341100800,,1957,4.421787709497207

Honestly, I don't see how anybody could rate this 2, 3 or 4 stars.  It's a 5 or a 1.  You either love it, or hate it.

For me, it's a 5.  I'd put it in my top 20 movies of all time  -- in terms of how much I enjoyed it.  I have to watch it over again every year or two.  And the sound track is always on my iPod.

Aside from being totally won over by the haunting Neil Young score, the rest of the movie is more of a surreal experience than, well, than it is a movie.  The plot is thin, the dialog is weird, the characters are, well... weird.  The sum of all these discordant parts came together to speak to me.  Jarmusch had a vision, and it might just speak to you as well.

Many reviewers have said something like ""you either get it or you don't"" but that implies some failing on the part of the viewer who hates it - which I don't think is fair.

Dead Man is a very odd take on just about every aspect of movie making, and liking it or not is a matter of taste.  If you think in terms of what most people are likely to expect in a ""good movie"", Dead Man is simply a bad movie.

But if you clear your mind and give yourself over to the movie, you might have yourself a truly great experience.",1338940800,5,1245,3.84251968503937

This is for a minority of film buffs that enjoy a bit of humor, romance, obscenity, violence and mysterious. Although reviews from the populous culture are mostly negative to mixed, Jim Jarmusch is possibly the closest non-American Indian to ever portray native peoples as non-stereotypes, something unseen in modern American cinema. The film balances on the edge of life and death for one mans journey and at the end of this journey, another begins. With the ever skilled musicianship of Neil Young for the score (I recommend the CD), a cast of crafted actors beginning with John Hurt and Robert Mitchum, Johnny Depps travels take him through a trip of a Lewis Carroll mixed with Louie Lamour oddity that keeps one wondering where this ride goes. I was disappointed to not see Gary Farmer getting no mention on the cover or major reviews, which consistently proves native artists being ignored in anything media related, especially films. Marlon Brando would love this? Anyway, after a brief one night tumble with a marked woman (Mili Avital) and the killing of her husband (Gabriel Byrne), WILLIAM BLAKE (Depp) is a hunted man. From Crispin Glover; Alfred Molina; Lance Henrikson; Michael Wincott: Eugene Byrd: Iggy Pop and Billy Bob Thornton, the film holds high marks for just how dirty and dark the west may have been over the glorious portraits seared into the American mind. Even the native languages of Cree and Blackfoot used in the film are not subtitled, which aims to include those tribes as viewers rather than appealing to the limited knowledge Americans like to keep about the west and American Indians.",1338940800,6,1720,4.914089347079038
828587,4,630426786X,"Very possibly Johnny Depp's strangest movie. If you've followed his career, that's saying quite a lot, actually.

Johnny plays William Blake, an accountant who travels from Cleveland all the way to the end of the line at Machine, where he's been promised a job as the accountant for Dickinson Machine Works. He's the classic green horn, with a plaid suit and a Prince Valiant haircut and a strange box-like hat. But Dickinson's clerk (John Hurt) tells him the job has been taken, he took too long getting there. He insists on seeing Mr. Dickinson.

Robert Mitchum plays Dickinson as the meanest, most ornery cuss you ever have seen. He's the stereotype, just as many others in this movie play out stereotypes. He tells Blake to get the hell out of his office.

Blake is sitting on the side porch of the local saloon, without a clue as to where he's going to sleep or what he's going to do, when a young lady selling paper flowers is tossed into the mud by a drunk with the comment ""I liked you better when you were a whore."" Blake helps her up, and she asks him to walk her home. Thel Russell (Mili Avital) is still pretty horny, apparently, because she invites Blake in to sleep over. However, her ""Charlie"" shows up, and makes this self-deprecating speech about how he knows they said it was over, but he brought her a present. He was about to leave when Thel says, ""Well, I never loved you anyway."" So Charlie turns and shoots her. Blake then pulls her gun out from under her pillow and shoots Charlie. Blake runs away, but apparently the bullet that killed Thel is now lodged in his chest.

Turns out Charlie's last name was Dickinson, and the senior Mr. Dickinson hires three well-known killers to track down Blake and bring him back, ""Dead or alive, although I reckon dead is easier."" They are Cole Wilson (Lance Henriksen), Conway Twill (Michael Wincott) and Johnny ""The Kid"" Pickett (Eugene Byrd). They each say they prefer to work alone, but Dickinson wants them out there working together.

Everyone in this movie is a real character, with strange ways. First there is Nobody (Gary Farmer), an Indian who was captured by whites and exhibited as a curiosity, eventually being taken to England. There he was put in a school where he read the poetry of William Blake. He is convinced that the accountant is the same person, and wonders that Blake doesn't remember any of his poems.

Then there's ""Sally"" Jenko (Iggy Pop), a scag drag pioneer, with Big George (Billy Bob Thornton) and a Cockney killer played by Jared Harris. Nobody tells Blake to go talk to them, and they offer him some beans. Then they start commenting on how soft and fine his hair is, and whose turn it is. Big George and the Cockney get into a fight over whose going to ""get"" him, and when the fight gets bad, one of them comments, ""Well, I guess Nobody's going to get you."" Just then Nobody comes up behind him and slits his throat.

An amazing number of people end up dead in this movie. The title, however, refers to Blake, because Nobody says he's a dead man. In fact, just about everyone in the movie ends up dead. Nevertheless, I'll give it four stars, for shear originality.",1336953600,,3160,4.5626102292768955
828588,5,630426786X,"I'm not surprised that this film has received so many negative reviews. To enjoy and appreciate this film, one must have an acquired taste for Jim Jarmusch. For me, the film captues the essence of defeat, lonliness, and despair. Its a dream and nightmare all at once.

I was so very impressed by the work of Johnny Depp here. As a young actor, he carried the film from start to finish. Depp managed to hold his own in one on one scenes with talented veteran actors Crispin Glover, John Hurt, Robert Mitchhum, and Gabriel Byrne in the first 20 min. of the film. Depp is also talented to work with the seemingly less experienced Gary Farmer for the duration of the film.

S P O I L E R S  B E L O W

Once Depp's fate is sealed, and he knows he's living on borrowed time, the film takes on a static, dream/nightmarrish, loud and annoying presence. I do not know what it feels like to be dying; however, it must not be pleasant. The film does become difficult as it goes on, but for me, facinating.

The cameo performances by Lance Hendrickson, Iggy Pop, Alfred Molina, Billy Bob Thorton, Michael Wincott, and Eugene Byrd are all kind of unforgettable. The one on one scene with Depp/Molina is a jewel.

The film is a ""road movie"" and a satisfying journey. We see some of the birth of technology....the telegraph and the constant ""wanted"" posters that appear in the film. The film also features a good running joke about the unavailability of tobacco. Along with the cinematography by the great Robby Muller, Dead Man ranks among the best from both Jarmusch and Depp. I hope they get a chance to work together again.",1334188800,,1612,4.465986394557823

828629,4,630426786X,"Ok, let me first attempt a brief synopsis: in 19th century America, William Blake (Johnny Depp) accepts an accounting job at the metalworks in the town of Machine, at the farthest reaches of the American frontier. Arriving too late and finding the job no longer available, he ponders his future when he meets Thel, a former prostitute (Mili Avital) who takes her to his room after he helps her. While talking in bed, her fiance Charlie (Gabriel Byrne) walks in and, after a brief exchange of words, kills Thel. The bullet that killed her wounds William, and in the heat of the moment he uses Thel's own revolver to kill Charlie. Trouble is, Charlie is the son of John Dickinson (the late Robert Mitchum), the owner of the metalworks. Dickinson immediately hires three bounty hunters to bring in William dead or alive. Thus begins William Blake's descent into a new world.

Wandering in the wilderness, William meets Nobody (Gary Farmer), an American Indian who thinks he really is the poet he's named after. Together, Nobody prepares William for his journey to the afterlife, for William Blake is indeed a Dead Man.

This is a very interesting and thought provoking film. The movie was shot in black and white, which adds an old fashioned vibe, but more importantly strips away the traditional beauty of color and adds a different kind of ethereal beauty. There are different elements at work here as well: drama, tragedy, even some buddy comedy in the interactions between William Blake and Nobody, two outcasts from their respective societies. Each character is a strong individual who work together and keep the story going to its conclusion. The brief but effective cameos from John Hurt and Crispin Glover add to the movie as well, with Glover's train fireman acting as a Charon from Greek mythology, bringing him to the underworld of Machine even before he has died. Or is he dead already? Like I said this movie makes you wonder, in a good way. Multiple viewings are recommended.

Now, the technical aspects: this DVD is bare bones. It contains just the movie. No commentary, no extras of any kind, not even a trailer. The picture quality is top notch, which I'm glad for since I've had problems with DVDs from Echo Bridge Home Entertainment before.",1328227200,18,2256,4.839378238341969

Gabriel Byrne, Crispin Glover, Robert Mitchum, Iggy Pop ... actors like that appear for a scene. It totally stars Johnny Depp and he plays the character of a young, but ""dead"", innocent William Blake well. He's a young, mid-westerner who travels by train to take a job in the yet wild west and I'm still trying to figure out when he started writing poetry! He ends up being wanted for murder. Perhaps it's too early for me to review this but I like it as I had to watch it a couple times and it gets more weird.

This certainly could be a classic 'acid western' as coined somewhere down the line, or just another snap shot, or better yet a MRI of the disingenuous, truly disturbed, yet completely intact current & historical versions of North American psyche. Of course the haunting soliloquy of Neil Young's over-drive decay ridden reverberated tremolo is well worth the ride in it's own right. The sound melded with the graphics helping to produce an indigenous atmosphere and attitude that only an unrelenting ironhorse could rouse. It is as if Depp's character is reborn in a sense, as the continent spits him out into the open sea of a universe. Although mortally wounded, now spiritually free due to the help and sacrifice of Nobody's guiding efforts. Was Nobody's interface of indigenous mysticism and Blake's honest spiritualism the human factor in guiding his lost brother on this final journey? The psychotic players, and violence of manifest destiny was well displayed and predictable, but Iggy's clan was very edgy, and just think of it...a blend of their kind of religiosity and spawn have merged into our current body politic, talk about devolution.

While viewing, I noticed that (about half-way through) the tint of the picture begins to change. Continually, to the end of the film, the black and white takes on tints of blue-green and reddish-orange. It wasn't a total distraction, but definitely noticeable.

I'm often accused of being too sensitive to picture and sound, so I investigated this online, to see if I just got a bad copy. The review on blu-ray.com doesn't mention this problem, and even comments on how beautiful and flawless the transfer is.

As well, I have always been glad, glad as hell, to review any movie starring Johnny Depp that might come my way. So here we have the combination of Johnny Depp as, well, Johnny Depp as usual (except maybe for those seemingly endless Pirate sequels) taking on an edgy role that less talented or more timid male actors would have walked away from, way a way from.

No one doubts that the old Hollywood (and dime store novel) vision of the old John Wayne ""howdy, partner"" American West is long gone. And with the ground-breaking work of The Wild Bunch back in the 1970d we have seen, well we have seen, more plausibly views of that old time West, including some pretty unsavory characters in search of fame and fortune around the edges of the great frontier before it melted at the turn of the 20th century. That pasting of the frontier, of course, did not stop anybody with the least carefree spirit or who was just plain tired of the ""civilized"" East from heading by anyway they could to the great expanses of the old-time West. And that is where William Blake (played by Johnny Depp), no not the 18th century mad man English poet and supporter of the ideals of the French Revolution (although that mistake plays a part in the plot), but an accountant, for god's sake, enters the story.

William Blake's transformation into a man of the West complete with notches on his revolver, seemingly in slow-motion at times and all in black and white, is what drives this curious film. We have an educated ""savage,"" Native American, savage white man bounty-hunters, a twisted rich land-owners (played by the late Robert Mitchum) and every mangy ""old dog"" who made it, or did not make it in the West. And every pathology known to humankind showed its face in this fierce portrayal of the West but also, a very surprising positive portrayal of Native American culture and its demise with the advance of the white man. William Blake, accountant, is one of Johnny Depp's edgier performances, no question, and if you can stay with the zen aspect of the thing a very well done performance.

828789,1,630426786X,"I can't think I've ever seen a bigger junk pile of a film than Dead Man.  The direction to the actors was amazingly bad.  True that it has a cast that could have delivered spectacular performances, it would seem this schlock director didn't want that.  Every single line delivered seemed like it was being read for the very first time by cardboard cut outs of the actors.
The story...um, what story.  I was able to make it to about two thirds through the thing and as far as I can tell nothing happened.  Even the gunfights, the pinnacle of action and drama on film, were somehow boring as hell.
I've never seen such tediously boring camera work out side of convenience store surveillance cameras.  They alternated between a kinda tight shot and a kinda wide shot.  Did they use this to add emphasis to the story, nah it just seemed to change at random.  I never notice camera work, it's not supposed to be noticeable.  This was so bad you couldn't help but notice that this was really really bad cinematography.
Is it a good idea to film in black and white in the forest? No. The background ended up being of the same grey value that was being worn by the cast.  Except for the bit in the birch forest in winter, thanks for the blinding white screen.  So either we suffered through badly directed actors reading a bland story that were blending like chameleons into the background, or we suffered through badly directed actors reading a bland story while our optic nerves overloaded into migraines from the super high contrast of BLACK on WHITE.

828853,5,630426786X,"""Dead Man"" is a western from a different perspective, the existential. Although westerns have occasionally delved into the existential such as ""The Searchers"" or ""Pursued,"" this may be a western that goes further west, to the mystical, it may be a psychedelic western.

Johnny Depp plays William Blake, yes, the naming after the English mystical poet William Blake is purposeful.  He's even mistaken for the poet by the Indian Nobody (Gary Farmer). The plot of ""Dead Man"" is kind of a standard plot in the post civil war, industrial revolution American west. Depp's Blake is moving west to take a job he's secured as an accountant, but upon arriving in Machine, a dirty, decadent city he finds his position has been filled.  He's then stuck in town with only enough money to buy a pint of whiskey. He befriends a hooker who takes him in. When her boyfriend shows up in the morning Blake is forced to shoot and kill him. He has to go on the run and become an outlaw, and that's where ""Dead Man"" departs from the usual western. Blake meets up with Nobody, an Indian of mixed heritage who wanders the wilderness quoting William Blake's poetry (yes, an explanation is given for this).

Blake is pursued through the wilderness by three eccentric bounty hunters, notably Michael Wincott as Conway Twill an overly talkative bounty hunter who won't shut up, and Lance Henriksen who gives one of his more animated, less stoic performances (which isn't saying much) as the cannibal bounty hunter Cole Wilson. As Depp wanders the wilderness with Nobody as a guide his reputation as an outlaw grows as he is forced to kill to survive running across characters such as Iggy Pop and Billy Bob Thornton exploring their own sexual wilderness. There are some other notable performances such as Crispin Glover in the prologue of the movie and really sets the tone of the movie. The legendary Robert Mitchum in a cameo as John Dickinson, the robber baron industrialist who runs the town of Machine.

Written and directed by Jim Jarmusch he has created an unconventional film that is a shamanistic journey into the underworld, and Jarmusch explores the visual poetry of film. Jarmusch films the movie as a study in black and white and the shades and nuances in between. The movie also has a textural quality to it, the characters focusing on things in the world they're noticing for the first time.

Neil Young did the soundtrack and it stands out.  Considering the unconventional nature of the film Jarmusch wanted an unconventional soundtrack from Young, and he gets one. Young's minimalist soundtrack works more of an accompaniment to the images more like a musician filling in an accompaniment at a poetry reading than a soundtrack.

""Dead Man"" is a movie you're either going to love or hate, but the journey is an interesting one on a lot of levels and worth exploring.

Like ""True Confessions"" this is a cast for the ages (Crispin Glover, Billy Bob Thornton, John Hurt, Robert Mitchum, Lance Henriksen, Iggy Pop).

It is almost a role-reversal in existential terms; it's usually about finding meaning in a meaningless world. The way people are reacting to this superficial film is trying to instill a sense of ethereal candor because they can't get over the fact that quoting Blake throughout and calling someone Nobody is not an essay on the meaning of life. So much so that all this kind of approach does is abandon the concept of nonverbal significance in life and focus on concrete words and moments... Now, it is easy to dismiss this kind of comment as someone who didn't understand the film... people become irritated because they are insecure about their own opinions, and feel that validation is needed for their own little psychic survival.. if someone told me I was green and had 4 heads, I'd laugh at them because it's completely untrue according to my notion of reality... if I take them seriously, it's because I'm second-guessing my own opinion.

828922,4,630426786X,"Well famous rock critic Greil Marcus loved the hell outta this Jim Jarmusch flick. Somebody asks what the Amazon reviewer who called ""Dead Man"" ""disappointing""  was smoking. I might want to ask the same of Greil Marcus who's lavish praise influenced me to buy this DVD. I mean it really is an interesting movie. I liked it a lot, but ""the best movie of the dog days of the 20th century""?? Why? Best is sayin' a lot, but it is best of the dog days. Marcus gave ten reasons (*spoiler warning*):
1. Made in 1996, it might as well be a silent. You can read the whole film off its faces.
2. I can never keep track of how many people Johnny Depp shoots.
3. The running Cleveland joke, which makes the whole movie -- not to mention the hero's whole life -- into a shaggy dog story.
4. There is no hint in director Jim Jarmusch's previous work that he was interested in anything but irony, and this movie has no irony.
5. Lance Henriksen reprising his head-vampire role from ""Near Dark"" -- as a bounty-hunting cannibal.
6. The fact that you agree with him that the only way to shut up one of the other bounty hunters is to eat him.
7. The sense of an undiscovered West -- a West that vanished before it could be incorporated into national myth. That's all there on the train ride from Cleveland to the Pacific, some time after the Civil War, as the white passengers shift inexorably into barbarism.
8. Depp is an accountant named William Blake; as he heads into the accursed little Northwest town to work at what almost smells off the screen as a tannery, you realize you are now seeing the dark satanic mills, and that it's no big deal.
9. I'm not sure it's Robert Mitchum or the painting of his character that has a stronger screen presence, but it was his last role.
10. But you know, when it comes to sweeping the century off the table, Ildik' Enyedi's film ""My 20th Century"" (1989) might be the one.
ANd then Marcus goes on to list 10 reasons why Neil Young's ""Dead Man"" soundtrack is the best music for the ""dog days of the 20th Century.

I can dig it, to an extent. It's a cool movie worth seeing. There are some other movies at the end of the 20th Century that are just maybe as good.",1247011200,2,2184,4.298543689320389
828923,5,630426786X,"While admittedly not everyone's cup of tea, Jim Jarmusch's ""Dead Man"" is a much deeper movie than most viewers are likely prepared for. Indeed ""Dead Man"" works on multiple levels with the aptly named protagonist William Blake (played by Johnny Depp), the same as the English poet. Blake is, in a true sense, a nowhere man in a nowhere land. His parents have died and has left his native Cleveland to venture west to the end of the railroad line. Possessing nothing he is venturing to nowhere, unsure of what he will find or what he is seeking, aside from the prospect of a job. Upon his arrival Blake discovers he has missed his opportunity and doesn't fit in to this new world. It is here where Blake's destiny begins to unfold with the help of his Amerindian guide, the equally appropriately named Nobody.

By turns the movie is akin to an ancient epic, requiring a journey to the underworld, except Blake is by no means heroic, nor is it preordained he will survive his journey. The movie is also very Taoist, reminding me of the expression ""He who feels punctured, must have been a bubble,"" which in a sense means a person cannot be imposed upon or invaded by external forces if he believes there are no outside forces. In Taoism 'that' and 'this' mean the same thing as the world and I are one entity. There is a certain serenity that Blake finds, and its hard to know if that comes from being shot and loosing blood or what, yet his is neither uncomfortable or startled. It was as though he anticipated what was to come and some ways was merely fulfilling it. In the end Blake becomes the gun-slinging poet, comfortable with his destiny, rather than being the casual observer. The incredibly complimentary soundtrack, by Neil Young, helps to set the dynamic tension and mood of the film. Consisting solely of distorted electric guitar feedback (similar to his ""Weld"" release) and minus any vocals, the music is by turns scattered and fragmentary.

""Dead Man"" often unfolds at a glacial pace which can be confounding to most viewers accustomed to a much quicker paced movie, yet patience will ultimately be rewarded.

Things start out painfully slow, so a fair amount of patience is required. Bill Blake (Depp), an accountant from Cleveland, is boarding a train for the town of Machine. He has just been hired by Old Man Dickinson (Robert Mitchum) to work in his steel mill. Blake's parents are recently deceased, his fiance ran out on him, and he used his last penny to buy a horrible suit and train ticket to get to Machine. He is looking for a fresh start. When Blake arrives at the steel mill he learns that due to a mailing error the accounting position has already been filled. Blake is furious and when he demands to speak with Dickinson he is chased out by the old man himself with a shotgun. Things don't get any better for Blake. By the end of the night he will be fatally wounded in a gunfight and wrongfully accused of a double murder which includes Dickinson's son (Gabriel Byrne). Three bounty hunters (Lance Henriksen, Michael Wincott, and Eugene Byrd) have been hired by Dickinson to bring Blake in. The only relief Blake finds is an Indian named Nobody (Gary Farmer), who tends to his wounds and offers him spiritual enlightenment. Nobody promises Blake that he will help him get back to where he came from. Through the character of Nobody Jarmusch unleashes this film's dark, dark, wit. Nobody is constantly putting down the ""stupid white man"" and his scenes with Depp are brilliant. These two actors have an unexpected team work and play off each other beautifully. Nobody is also the film's conscience as he tries to teach Blake about spirituality and quotes endlessly the real William Blake's' poetry. I haven't even gotten to Billy Bob Thornton, Iggy Pop in drag, or the brain smashing, and cannibalism that Jarmusch also sees fit to throw in. It is a film well worth taking a chance on.

Depp was marvelous in this. He made some great career choices; the main one being that he rejected ""pretty boy"" roles. Yet his William Blake character is an almost surealist parody of the very typecast he avoided.

Robert Mitchum was hilarious as the homocidal industrialist Mr. Dickenson

Gary Farmer stole every scene he was in. This was another role that thumbed its nose at typecasting. Yet Farmer's character Nobody, having endured all manner of humiliations his whole life, emerged as an arguably genuine holy man in his tradition. A little off beat, but the real deal.

Turns out, Blake's arrived too late. Dickinson's already hired an accountant. So, he's alone and penniless in Machine.

He spends his last coin on a bottle and comes upon a woman who makes paper flowers.  She takes him back to her room and presumably Blake is 'deflowered.' Dickinson's son arrives on the scene, angry that Blake has taken his girl.  The two lovers shoot each other, but the killing's blamed on the last man standing, Blake.

Blake, who is also wounded, takes flight on a pinto horse that young Dickinson was riding.  He passes out from his injuries and wakes to see Nobody (Gary Farmer) standing above him, cursing the stupid White men. Nobody, who is a Makah Indian, takes care of Blake through the film because he's under the mistaken impression that Blake is William Blake, the poet.

The film's one in joke after another, including two of the cast members being named after members in Tom Petty's band.  Iggy Pop is shown briefly in a dress.
This should be funny, but the humor fell flat.

I had several issues with the film.  First, the soundtrack to dialogue balance was way off.  If I wanted to hear what was spoken, the plangent 'fuzzy' Neil Young guitar nearly blew me out of the room.  I love Young's music, but this is his worst venue.  Second, the black and white filming lacked sufficient contrast and watching the film was tedious on the eyes.  Third, the disconnected vignette style just didn't work. While it was possible to keep the thread of the film in you mind, dealing with the storyline interspersed with Young's jarring chords was more work than it was worth. Finally, they just didn't even bother with realism. One key note was the teddy bear was invented several years after this film was supposed to take place.

Considering all the flaws, I'd give the film a one star rating, but the two I've checked go to Gary Farmer.  In my opinion, he gave the best performance in a very bad situation.

A mood piece with the varying landscapes serving to set tone, the actors all have an understated approach to their performances, even when the script, or ad libbing would have made an over the top performance too easy.  A film in which Iggy Pop can play a clearly feminine ""man"" with some believability, though suspension of belief in the rational world is an good attribute to have when viewing this picture, makes this a successful film.

If you love Westerns, you will probably be bored, frustrated, confused and ultimately disappointed by DEAD MAN.

If you like quirky Independent films with obscure points, talented actors reading demented dialogue as overwrought grotesques, a genre picture that is anti-genre...this movie is for you.

I liked everyone in the movie but found every character (except Johnny Depp and his goofy Native American guide) repellent and extreme.  The story appears to just meander, especially when it reaches its inconclusive ending.  It's not like the story just stopped...I just wondered why it was there in the first place.  I had the feeling that I would have to read a very long review in Film Comment to find out what really happened since it wasn't included in the film itself.

DEAD MAN has its moments.  I liked the slimy trio of killers (I laughed out loud while they all drew down on Robert Mitchum's portrait over and over just before he enters the room).  There was more tension and momentum in their scenes than Johnny Depp's sleepy ride through the wilderness.

Not the premise mind you, just the offbeat, stylish , very unHollywoodlike pacing and camera work, and that undefinable sense of mystery too. Movies like these two, you either appreciate for their heavy underlying artistic concept...or you don't. If your looking strictly for high entertainment, you'll probably be turned off. The stark soundtrack featuring Neil Young's guitar playing is really cool I have to say and pretty unique to hear only his guitar and nothing else. The oddball indian 'Nobody' mistaking Depp for a poet he'd read about makes for the oddest buddy picture of all time probably! I never could figure why he was hellbent on 'offing' Depps character, or sending him off to the 'next world' as he put it, unless that was like the highest respect he could pay to the 'stupid killer of white men'....truly a bizarre movie, with some very cool cameos by Billy Bob Thornton, Iggy Pop and others. One of the coolest delivered lines ever was when Depps character suddenly had the epiphany that his gun would soon 'write his poetry in blood', as Nobody had predicted, and Depp guns down two Marshalls as they ask , 'are you William Blake?' and Depp replies 'Yes I'm William Blake, have you read my poetry?' and guns them down with gunslinger precision.

However, having said that, I did recognize some unique things about this film that make it stand out (though I wouldn't watch it a second time).  There was some fairly innovative camera work, unique stylistic touches, grim realism superimposed on black comedy, and clever caricatures of some of the bizarrest of human behaviors. The result was that, even though the movie was unrelentingly depressing, at the end, all I could say about it was ""That was just TOO weird!""

I love Neil Young, and, as some people have noted, his soundtrack was perfect for the ""Too Weird"" character of this movie.  It was grating at times and too loud; but then, that was what was needed.

The ""William Blake"" theme that ran throughout the movie was another strange touch.  Probably most of the people who watch this film will have as little idea who William Blake was as the protagonist.  The bizarre experience of seeing a Native American quoting William Blake in the grim wilderness is just - again - Too Weird!

In the end, trying to give credit where it was due, even though it was not to my taste, I have to say that it was truly a unique movie, probably worth watching once just to be able to say ""That was TOO Weird!""",1203033600,,1482,4.604562737642586

829158,1,630426786X,"It has been years since I've seen Dead Man, but throughout those years it has consistently held a distinctive place among the worst movies I've ever seen. I've often considered watching it again, to give it another chance. But I doubt I could sit through another session of this film's endlessly mind-numbing plot, painfully pretentious attempts at being profound, and long, meandering camera pans that seem to serve only to fill space for lack of a story to be told.

I do get what the film was going for. It's an interesting concept. Johnny Depp is a dead man. The bulk of the film is literally a chronicle of his slow death. We are meant to see the world through the eyes of a man whose days are numbered, and witness his journey into death and how it transforms him. Interesting premise, but ultimately lost while we trudge needlessly through a quagmire of dull scenes that seem only loosely connected, and ridiculously over-the-top characters.

The film boasts some impressive talents, including Johnny Depp, Lance Henrikson, John Hurt, Gabriel Byrne, Alfred Molina, Michael Wincott, Crispin Glover...and the list goes on. Not one of them drew me in, and I'm a fan of every performer I knew in this film. Their roles were either so dreary and boring that I just didn't care, or so ludicrous that I completely shaken out of what little immersion I managed to achieve while watching this film crawl by. Even writer/director Jim Jarmusch impressed me with his later ""Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,"" so I know he's got the ability to make good films.

829159,2,630426786X,"The ""look"" of DEAD MAN is fascinating - a realistic, non-romantic view of the Old West as filthy, evil, poverty stricken and filled with demented murderers.  Clint Eastwood was able to give us this gruesome ""look"" in color in his Oscar-winning saga, but here we view in black and white - a suitable choice since there are no grays in this society, only good and evil.

In a plaid suit, with frame glasses, long hair and top hat, Depp delivers a bland performance, playing an accountant, William Blake, who seems to have no personality whatever.  As the Native American sidekick, Nobody, Gary Farmer proves not only that he is completely miscast, but that he has no acting ability whatsoever.  He shouldn't feel bad though because only two people in the cast can act.  John Hurt in a small cameo and Lance Henricksen as the evil bounty hunter, Cole, are splendid.

Everyone else from Robert Mitchum (three scenes)to Iggy Popp to Billy Bob Thornton are just pathetically bad.

There is an interesting guitar chord score by Neil Young and there is an interesting editing technique of cutting to black between scenes, thus making them seem like tableaux.  The disgusting gore is kept to a minimum but it's there.  I wonder about the Gray Tree Frogs, Spring Peepers and Whip-poor-Wills on the soundtrack, which I believe are eastern species and not found in the Pacific territories.  There are fifteen minutes of deleted scenes in the bonus material.

After 5 minutes-'Man, this movie is REALLY WIERD!'
After 15 minutes, I found myself backing up to watch scenes a 2nd and sometimes 3rd time. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.
After about an hour, I'd decided this was one of the better movies I'd EVER SEEN. Dead Man has got to be one of the most underrated movies ever made. It is a visually stunning movie. It is at times hilarious-the campfire scene with Iggy Pop and Billy Bob Thornton is classic-and at the same time brutal. Gary Farmer as the Indian Nobody is excellent. And Mili Avital, who is very pretty to begin with, is absolutly beautiful(for about 10 too-short minutes) in black and white as the girl who causes Blake's problems to begin.

It's artsy, and you have to get used to the format.  The black and white cinematography, I thought, was very good.  The format is more of a series of vignettes than a continuous flow of story and dialogue.  You get the hang of it pretty quickly.  The music isn't your normal kind of score.  Sometimes it fits the scene really well, and other times it borders on being annoying.  The acting is very good.  Don't expect some sort of ""Ocean's Thirteen"" cast with witticisms and glitzy movie-making.  It's not that kind of film.  If you're familiar with much of Depp's work you won't be too surprised that this film is avante garde.

In terms of the story, I'd recommend relaxing and taking the journey.  Each person will find something different in it, I think.  The story isn't hard to follow.  The choices that Depp's character makes result in the twists and turns of the story.  Don't waste time trying to figure out logic - you'll figure out pretty quickly that logic isn't part of the random sorts of things that happen.  Why does Depp's character do what he does?  He just does.  Could he do otherwise?  Yes.  But he doesn't.  He seems swept away by his circumstances - that's part of the interest of the story.  Obviously Native American spiritualism guides Farmer's character.  If you have any understanding of Native American myth you'll be able to figure Farmer's character, ""Nobody,"" out.  As to whether he's ""real"" or imaginary, that's part of the individual interpretation involved in watching the film.  That's part of what makes it artsy instead of ""hollywood.""  Everything isn't spelled out and spoonfed to the viewer.

If you want to walk away with a resolved ending and a happy feeling don't waste your time.  Likewise if you're sensitive to things that are dark and logic that is more random than systematic, you won't like this film. In my opinion those who are very critical of this movie either try too hard to find the ""meaning,"" or are frustrated by the dark mood and random manner of the events because they're trying to order things and find the natural flow.  There isn't a natural flow here.  If you're able not to take things too seriously and you're interested in something that will make you think a little bit, wonder a little bit, and philosophize a little bit you'll like this movie.

His situation in the hellish town of Machine becomes dire rapidly, and his urbane sensibilities become hardened with the issues of mortality, violence, escape, and mysticism, with the aid of an Indian friend, Nobody, who thinks he's the real poet William Blake.

I do admit to anyone interested in viewing ""Dead Man"" that so far, the majority of people I attempted to introudce the film to did not like it. This movie is made for a very particular audience, and I'm not sure if even the director can pin-point exactly who this audience is.

I loved everything about this movie, even the black & white, and I normally hate black & white movies. But ""Dead Man"" in color would have killed so much of the effect.

If Tom can only describe the superficial events of the story without recognizing the broader themes, then he is really missing out.  I am always amazed at how much storytelling punch Jim Jarmusch manages to pack into so few scenes- minimalism at its best.  He encapsulates the human experience in just a few short strokes- the innocence of the young as they make their way out into the world, taking the first long journey alone, seeing new & strange lands/people, encountering the decadence of the city, treachery in big business, enduring ridicule, sharing fragile dreams with another and seeing those dreams slip away.  In the end, William Blake is transformed from innocence to maturity and understands the necessity and tragedy of it.

829260,5,630426786X,"While admittedly not everyone's cup of tea, Jim Jarmusch's ""Dead Man"" is a much deeper movie than most viewers are likely prepared for.  Indeed ""Dead Man"" works on multiple levels with the protagonist (played by Johnny Depp) aptly named William Blake, the same as the English poet.  Blake is, in a true sense, a nowhere man in a nowhere land.  His parents have died and has left his native Cleveland to venture west to the end of the railroad line.  Possessing nothing he is venturing to nowhere, unsure of what he will find or what he is seeking, aside from the prospect of a job.  Upon his arrival Blake discovers he has missed his opportunity and doesn't fit in to this new world.  It is here where Blake's destiny begins to unfold with the help of his Amerindian guide (the aptly named) Nobody.

By turns the movie is almost like an ancient epic, requiring a journey to the underworld, except Blake is by no means heroic, nor is it preordained he will survive his journey.  The movie is also very Taoist, reminding me of the expression ""He who feels punctured, must have been a bubble,""  which in a sense means a person cannot be imposed upon or invaded by external forces if he believes there are no outside forces.  In Taoism 'that' and 'this' mean the same thing as the world and I are one entity.  There is a certain serenity that Blake finds, and its hard to know if that comes from being shot and loosing blood or what, yet his is neither uncomfortable or startled.  It was as though he anticipated what was to come and some ways was merely fulfilling it.  In the end Blake becomes the gunslinging poet, comfortable with his destiny, rather than being the casual observer.  The incredibly complimentary soundtrack, by Neil Young, helps to set the dynamic tension and mood of the film.  Consisting solely of distorted electric guitar feedback (similar to his ""Weld"" release) and minus any vocals, the music is by turns scattered and fragmentary.

""Dead Man"" often unfolds at a glacial pace which can be confounding to most viewers accustomed to a much quicker paced movie, yet patience will ultimately be rewarded.

Filmed in a rich, textured monochrome, the movie follows a young accountant who leaves Cleveland, Ohio for a job in a remote frontier town in the Pacific Northwest. The defining cinematic technique involves presenting the story in short snippets -- chapters varying in length that fade quickly to black. But while Dead Man captures the feeling of a dream, and is chock full of symbols of various kinds, it doesn't really work as much more than an hallucinatory trip of sorts, and its attempt to tell a greater story -- the path from life to death to afterlife -- ends up being more odd and pretentious than artistic. It has the feel of someone trying too hard to be profound and quirky. It left me empty and only slightly engaged.",1172966400,6,753,4.626865671641791
829335,5,630426786X,"Jim Jarmusch is unique among American filmmakers in that he is one of the rare few who owns the negatives for all his films and has final cut on the work he releases. When accepting an award on behalf of Robby Mller, Dead Man's cinematographer, Jarmusch was openly critical of the way in which Miramax, the film's distributor, had mishandled the film at the time of its release. His contention was that when he refused to allow them to recut the film to make it more commercial they dumped it on the market without the kind of support a slow-paced black and white art film would need to find its audience (see Jonathan Rosenbaum's fascinating book, ""Movie Wars: How Hollywood and the Media Conspire to Limit What Films We Can See"" for more on this subject). The mishandling seems to have continued. For example, the film's description on the DVD case is as follows: ""Johnny Depp delivers a remarkable performance in this highly acclaimed tale of adventure in the wild, wild West! A young man in search of a fresh start, William Blake, embarks on an exciting journey to a new town...never realizing the danger that lies ahead. But when a heated love triangle ends in double murder, Blake finds himself a wanted man running scared..."" This summary is remarkable because although it sort of presents the basic plot elements of the film, it distorts them to make the film seem something radically different from what it really is. In presumably attempting to sell the movie by misrepresenting it as an action-packed western it undermines its more subtle, but deeper, virtues and sets up a disappointment for the action-film audience while simultaneously failing to reach the audience that would seek an art film.

Jarmusch's sixth feature film (if you don't count the previously shown early segments of ""Coffee and Cigarettes"" or the initial short film version of ""Stranger Than Paradise""), is a significant leap forward from his previous work both thematically and stylistically. The film follows two lost souls, one an accountant, who happens to be named William Blake, and the other a Native American outcast named Nobody (brilliantly played by Gary Farmer) who mistakes Blake for the great 19th century poet of the same name. The story starts with Blake taking a train out west to accept a job. He arrives at the town at the end of the line to find the job has been given to someone else and without money is unable to make his way back home. Adrift, he meets a young woman, who sells paper flowers in the taverns, and that evening ends up in her bed only to be confronted by her estranged husband. A clumsy exchange of gunfire ensues, the woman and her husband are killed and Blake is mortally wounded. He manages to get on a horse and gallops out of town only to later awaken with a large Native man probing his chest with a knife in an attempt to extract the bullet next to his heart. The two form an unlikely friendship, drawn to each other by their being cast out from the worlds they've inhabited, Blake because he's being chased by bounty hunters for the murders he allegedly committed, Nobody because he's the product of the joining of two tribes that have long been at war with each other.

Their journey might be a spiritual one but it's never clear how much the Blake character understands about what is happening to him and how much is meaning imposed on him by Nobody. Along the way, Jarmusch critiques violence in America and the attempted genocide of Native Americans while exploring his characteristic theme of disorientation from the surrounding culture. Unique in the entire Western genre, ""Dead Man"" also paints a portrait of Native Americans that is richly detailed and not merely politically correct. The film is hypnotically paced and filled with images that are hallucinatory in their beauty. ""Dead Man"" was arguably not only the best film of 1995 but also one of the best American films of its decade. Even after repeated viewings it somehow manages to retain its mystery.",1172707200,6,3996,4.773121387283237

He meets an Indian who thinks he's the poet Wm. Blake. And tries to help Blake remember who he is. The whole thing is a surrealistic journey to find his true self.

The movie is told in short vignettes. Every time Blake closes his eyes the screen goes black and when he opens them again -- time has past and the scene has changed. It starts on the train. This allows sharp jumps in the film but in context it works well to tell the story. There's layers and layers within layers.

As the film opens, I thought, ""Well, I guess there's a reason why movies you've never heard of go on sale."" But, even as I thought this, there was still a quality to this film that captivated me. Even though the pacing was slow at first, the images and the dialogue seamed to be saying, ""If you pay attention, I'm pretty important."" Luckily, the little voice was right, and the film picked up steam as it moved along. Now, do not misunderstand me: at no point is this a fast paced film. Rather, your interest is taken captive by the pieces of dialogue and imagery that give the film a near-deat dream-like quality. The more you see of the film, the more you think you may understand, but, at the same time, the more dream-like it becomes. Others have bemoaned the grotesque portrayals of the supporting roles, yet this, too, leaves you with the sense that maybe all is not as it seems. As the film draws to a close, nothing concrete is laid into your lap. There is no nice and tidy ""explain it all to me so I understand this in totality"" wrap-up. No, instead, you are free to allow your mind to wander on the questions of reality, death, dreams, and fate. Weren't we told all along, even from the opening train ride, that this was how things would progress? Is William Blake dead? Is this the actual William Blake?

Johnny Depp plays William Blake, an accountant hired to work at the end of the railroad line in Machine, a town described as hell by the engine stoker on the railroad.

As is typical in these sorts of movies, the hero is down on his luck quickly and becomes a fugitive from the law.  He is befriended by an outcast Indian while  on the run from wild, cannibalistic bounty hunters.  William never seems comfortable in his desperado role but somehow stumbles through to the California Coast.

This film had some potential.  Unfortunately the stylistic conceit of Jarmusch doesn't really work in this film.  The constant fading to black gets tiresome when it happens every five minutes, as does Neil Young's discordant soundtrack which rarely fits the action and is ham handedly and generously slathered onto every scene.  The all star cast does a fine job, as does the star Johnny Depp who bemusedly acts as if he is in a dream--this is one aspect that really works for the film, though it would have been nice to see Depp play a larger range of emotions.  Another part that is finely done is the filming of nature.  Each tree and leaf seems to be perfectly delineated in the well-framed shots, evocative of Ansel Adams' prints.

The movie didn't really get good reviews and a lot of people didn't like it apparently. Truth is, I just wanted to check it out because Johnny Depp(he's my favorite actor, you see?) was in it. While it's unique, both as a movie and as a western...I don't see what critics saw in it that turned them off. The movie opens on a train, where we meet William Blake (Depp) who appears to be the only nicely dressed and clean guy on the train. A dirty man (Crispin Glover) talks to him for a few moments, where we learn that Blake is traveling from Cleveland where his parents have just died. He's been promised a job, but when he arrives...He's turned down and laughed at by John Dickinson (Robert Mitchum); John Hurt is there to as John Scholfield, Dickinson's assistant or something. Anyway, Blake begins walking around when he meets a young woman named Thel (Mili Avital). Thel and Blake go to her place and soon her fiancee (Gabriel Byrne), who also happens to be Dickinson's son,

shows up and kills Thel; but is quickly killed by Blake. Blake took a bullet, however, so he wanders into the woods and passes out. When he wakes, he's greeted by an indian named Nobody (Gary Farmer) who begins to teach him how to survive as a ""dead man."" Meanwhile, Dickinson hires three men to find and kill Blake. From there, we follow the men and Blake. Along the way Blake runs into characters played by a whole array of names including

Billy Bob Thornton, Iggy Pop, and Alfred Molina. In case you hadn't noticed, William Blake is also the name of a famous poet and painter. Nobody points out this and it's referenced several times throughout the movie, but it's never finalized on whether Depp is the famous poet/painter or not. This movie is not for all tastes, it's slow moving and it's in black & white. I, myself, loved every second of it. There's a great score by Neil Young too and a great ending.

Many people, after the first viewing, will walk away confused for this is not a typical brainless Hollywood movie. You do not see this film and then, as soon as it's over with, forget about it. Dead Man is the kind of movie that you see a second or third time and discuss with others. There is so much to think about and discuss on so many different levels. It deals with everything from Native American beliefs and traditions concerning shamans and tobacco to the technological progression of mankind and its effect on the natural world to the fundamental concepts of life and death to the meaning and morality of violence. It deals with death as a concept with different views of it influenced by cultural relativity. As an American I have a certain worldview that is relative to the life that I lead and the society that I live in but this movie offers a glimpse into an alternate perspective where death is just another part of life. It is believed to not necessarily be the end, which is represented by the tradition of sending the dead or dying person in a boat with food and supplies; as if it is the beginning of a new journey.

Neil Young's score paired with the film style of high contrast black and white serve to further enhance the tale. They both add to the rugged and strange atmosphere.

Dead Man as a whole is an entirely striking experience that leaves the viewer full of philosophical questions. Any William Blake or Dante educated viewer will be impressed with the way allusions and even direct quotes are slipped so casually and fittingly into the film.

Anybody with an open and inquisitive mind will walk away from this film very impressed. It is such a relief to see a film that seems to think unlike most mainstream movies (though I would hardly call this film mainstream) these days with their predictable plotlines and mindless moral points.

Director Jim Jarmusch seems intent on reviving every western sterotype from the dude accoutant in a plaid suit (Depp) to the evil rich guy who talks to a stuffed bear (Robert Mitchem). There is even a goofy Indian named Nobody who can quote poetry. If it wasn't for all the shootings and killings and serious, black and white filming and Finland-school ten-second shoot-and-cut scenes, I'd almost call DEAD MAN a comedy. But, instead, I'll just call it a joke. This is a boring, depressing, mindless film that seems intent on satirizing western films and slamming the western culture of violence. At one point when asked why she had a pistol, the girl says, ""This is America."" Not this is a wild-open, crime-ridden town where a gal needs a little protection, but this is AMERICA. So perhaps, DEAD MAN is a metaphor for violent America and its inevitable demise.

Okay, it won't take Unforgiven, Open Range, The Good, The Bad & The Ugly, or even none of the Magnificent Seven as one of the greatest Westerns but Jarmusch's direction and Depp's acting made it convincing enough.  The fact that legendary Robert Mitchum played the villain looking to off Blake in the movie added much credibility to it.  The film being in black and white added a creepy ghoulish effect to the movie.  I didn't care for Neil Young's addition as I think his music was used waaay too much in the movie.

To begin with, Johnny Depp is the only thing that earns this film a single star, and I've never thought he was the sharpest knife in the drawer. Still, his performance is head and shoulders the best thing about this abortion. It's a pretentious pseudo-intellectual tale about a young man's journey to enlightenment in the wild west. The only problem is, the ""enlightenment"" is all hog-wash.

I share Mr. Depp's confusion about the native American ""Nobody"" and his inane dronings. Let's face it, folks... anyone, myself included, can cloak things in allegory and inexactitude to the point that it SOUNDS profound, but that doesn't make it so.

Everyone here ripped the viewer off to the point that I wanted a refund on my time, not to mention my money.

True to the genre of Western, this film draws on symbols and images connected to the foundation myth of the USA, however, Jarmusch inverts these icons throughout. White people become debauched barbarians, whereas Blake (Depp) with the help of his companion Nobody (a native American who was taken into the white world) gradually turns into a killer of white colonialists - he becomes a militant version of the poet cum painter William Blake. Furthermore, Jarmusch makes use of an excellent soundtrack, namely Neil Young's recurring motif on the electric guitar. The recurrence symbolises continuity, but at the same time the viewer becomes mesmorised and is dragged into Blake's inverted world.

With Dead Man Jarmusch created an excellent post-colonial critique of the fondation mythology of America and, what is more, an extremely beautiful film.",1138924800,7,1118,5.171270718232044

He gets involved with a street babe, and then it's downhill from there.  He becomes an outlaw hunted by the likes of Billy Joe Thornton, and takes up with a lettered Indian.  The Indian thinks William Blake (Depp) is the real poet Blake.  Consequently, the Indian mentors Depp on the ways of the peyote spirits.  Then the film rides off to the Pacific Ocean intermittent with scenes of grisly violence and frontier homosexuality.  Get out the banjos boys.

Dead is in black and white.  This is a film stock that directors feel lends an authentic, Ansel Adams look to the Western States.  The theme is rather creepy, so again, black and white has ghoulish qualities, but I still yearned for the look of a 1950's Jimmy Stewart or Rory Calhoun, glorious cinemascope landscape.

Yeah... We lose people, we lose our jobs, we lose our minds, but we never really lose all sense of direction, finding a new path to our lives.  This is, for me, what the movie is all about: losing it all, all that is somewhat meaningless to realize nothing really meant that much anyway.  If you can see that, then you'll learn to appreciate what's left.  It'n not that we are alone, it's that we are never really alone.  It's hard to let go of everything, your work, your friends, your loved ones, even for a split second... That's what I mean by dying.

Anyway, when I watch this movie I get a little of that feeling.  The solitude and the freedom of being a DEAD MAN.  Nothing follows you when you take that final journey.  No one is there though ;P

But the similarities are haunting -- from the emphasis on technical details and the role of technology, to the pure evil embodied by Jarmusch's bounty hunter Cole/McCarthy's frightening Judge Holden.

This is a great film. It brings the Western genre into the postindustrial/postmodern era, and like all great Westerns it's not really about ""The West"" at all. Yes, Jarmusch hits us over the head with symbolic elements such as Indian's fire crowning the dead marshall's head or the sequence of the train's running gear leading Bill Blake toward his death in/rebirth from the dark Satanic mills of Machine. But this overt play of semiotics forces us to demythologize the code--or, at least, to question the structural narrative of the code as essentialist metanarrative/Truth.",1134691200,4,886,5.328571428571428

To describe this movie is pretty much a waste of time.  It has to be seen.  Only then can someone decide if they like it or not.  As for me I thought it was full of itself, boring, and trying way too damn hard to be meaningful.

It takes more than characters muttering strange dialogue and dramatic pauses to make a ""Deep"" movie.  And having every scene end with a fade out got old real quick.  I can't imagine anyone thinking this movie was very good.  Certainly, it's not worth hating.  It's just kind of okay on the not-very-good side.

829714,5,630426786X,"The opening scenes of `Dead Man', totally bereft of dialogue, effectively sets the tone for this strange and wonderful film while nearly overwhelming the senses with its gorgeous black and white cinematography. Depicted is the long train journey of the protagonist, Bill Blake (Johnny Depp) into the West. From one silent fade-out scene to another we are shown the changes happing inside and outside of the train coach, as both the passengers and landscape morph into ever more rugged terrain; the black and white landscapes that Blake views from his window have the beauty and majesty of Ansel Adams' photographs come to life, while the motley passengers of the coach could easily have stepped out of Dorothea Lange's portraits. Before a word is spoken, the viewer already has a sense that this is not your typical Western, and that they are in for a strange cinematic odyssey.

This spell of silence is finally broken by the enigmatic train fireman (Crispin Glover), who approaches Blake like a dour Cassandra speaking in riddles of the doom that awaits him. His words foreshadow Blake's fate, and perfectly predict the film's final scenes. From this point on `Dead Man' has little in common with traditional Westerns, and abandons most of the elements of conventional plot development and story telling as well. Instead, it is a mythical journey into the land of the dead, full of symbolism and iconic images. What develops has more in common with a dreamscape than any waking reality, and can really only be understood as such. If you are able to accept this mythic dream journey on its own terms you will be richly rewarded. It is full of gorgeous visuals, sly, erudite humor, and grotesque, fascinating characters. Even its abundant violence seems appropriate to the dark myth that the film is telling.

Johnny Depp (as the protagonist William Blake) turns in a masterful, minimalist performance as he heads an A-list cast full of so many excellent performances that I cannot even begin to do justice to them all. Gary Farmer deserves special mention for his outstanding performance as Blake's Indian guide, Nobody, who initiates the film's mythic pilgrimage when he discovers the wounded Blake and leads him through his transforming journey-quest to the land of the dead. Lance Henriksen and Michael Wincott provide much of the film's dark humor as a pair of mismatched assassins, one as pathologically laconic as the other is verbose. Also present are Robert Mitchum (in his final role), John Hurt, Gabriel Byrne, Billy Bob Thornton, Iggy Pop, Alfred Molina, and Steve Buscemi - all in small but brilliantly played roles.

`Dead Man' is director Jim Jarmusch's masterpiece. He demands much of his viewers, expecting them to be active participants in deciphering this odd film, and rewards them richly for their effort. `Dead Man' doesn't have a wide appeal - if you generally don't enjoy art house films you probably will not enjoy this one and should avoid it. But if you enjoy films full of odd vignettes and gorgeous imagery that both surprise and challenge you, this one may just become one of your favorites.

There are a dozen character performances in this one that are all worth a second viewing, but Mr. Depp manages to rivet attention in a very subtle performance with practically no dialogue to work with.

After learning that his position has been given to another, his life takes a turn of events that lead him on his journey to becoming a ""killer of white man"", as he himself slowly dies from a fatal wound.

Gary Farmer is his reluctant guide on this journey. Gary plays an outcast American Indian named ""Nobody"". Nobody believes that Depp is either ""William Blake"" the poet, or somehow an incarnation of this man.

There is not much I can say that isn't out there already (ie. the bold imagery, the sweeping black/white cinematography, the mystical overtones or dream-like consciousness, the coolness of Johnny Depp, the power of Robert Mitchum, the aloofness of Gary Farmer, and the poweful background provided by Neil Young), but I can't help but be intrigued by the polarizing effect this film has on it's viewers.

I'm not surprised by Keogh's negative analysis (one shared by Roger Ebert- a man who's insight and opinions I respect, but who is by no means my authority, for no such authority exists when it comes to art, except the eye of the beholder). Like Big Dog from Cleveland, I'm more apt to vehemently argue against those ""commercially influenced"" viewers, who can't or won't see beneath the surface and who refuse to seek out their art and instead accept only that which is fed to them. However, that is not why I'm writing this. At least Keogh and Ebert watched the film. The same cannot be said for those who let reviews dictate whether or not they watch a movie. If you are one of those people, I write to urge you to stop being one of those people, watch Dead Man and form your own opinion.

It's suprisingly multi-layered and innovative - filmed in black and white not unlike the dramatic lighting of silent films. Johnny Depp as William Blake seems to be aware of this silent film quality as his acting is more about body language - a glance, a stare, a studied gaze than dialogue. There is a pulp fiction feel to it as well as can especially be seen in the scene with Iggy Popp and Billy Bob Thorton.

The soundtrack is beautifully dark and compliments the plot thanks to Neil Young's understated guitar playing.

To make matters worse he then gets caught in a love triangle that ends with 2 of the members dead. The other male in the triangle just happens to be the son of a wealthy man who wants revenge. And so William Blake becomes a 'Dead Man'. The story moves along and the body count begins to grow, all pushed along by brilliant music and quirky directorial stuff. Johnny Depp keeps collecting 'white mans metal' and travelling around with no real goal as bad guys continuosly try to kill him.

With that plot the movie seems kind of weak, but it is done in an artsy and original enough way to make it entertaining all the way through. The movie is funny without trying too hard to be, and the tension grows whenever the director wants it to. Overall it is worth the watch, and should go up there with Tarrantino films for how action movies can be done in a way that is quite entertaining.",1121040000,3,1238,4.4298245614035086
829821,2,630426786X,"Stylistically I loved this movie.  It was beautifully shot and generally well acted.  The early scenes of Johnny Depp on the train out west raised my expectations very high for the rest of the film but I was sorely disappointed.  It seems as if director couldn't make up his mind whether he wanted to portray the mythic West of the old movies or the often dirty reality that historians are quick to point out.  I wouldn't have minded inconsistencies if he'd been going for a heady combination of the two, but at moments the film seemed almost documentary-like, making the historical blurbs seem sloppy rather than inserted on purpose.  For example,

1) The movie was obviously set sometime during the second half of the 1800s, my guess is not long before the American Civil War (trains going out west, Indian Wars, etc).  There certainly were major migrations of Aboriginal American back and forth across the 49th Parallel, but these were nearly always to escape the wars of expansion the United States was waging further south.  The British held territory was comparatively safe - not having been widely settled yet, and in fact the creation of the North-West Mounted Police (later the RCMP) was partially to prevent the tribes from being preyed upon in the various ways that were fashionable at the time.  This being said, the British were well over their ""taking Aboriginal children to Europe as curiousities"" phase.  That had happened centuries earlier.  So my point is that ""Nobody"" NEVER would have been taken to England like he had.  Don't forget that one of the biggest reasons why the American colonies rebelled against Britain was the prohibition of westward expansion into ""Indian territory""!

2)  Given the fact that most Aboriginals were moving north, not south during this era, the distinctive Hudson's Bay Company blankets and coats that pop up in places like the American southwest is lazy work on the costume designer's part.

3)  Were there any fat Aboriginals who lived off the land during this era?  Nope.  Obesity has been just one of the curses Europeans brought to North America.  This being said, ""Nobody"" was miscast and uncredible.

I could go on and on, but I'll just restate my summary instead:

Camera-work and acting aside - this film is a piece of crap.",1119225600,5,2284,4.880519480519481
829822,3,630426786X,"An ""alternative"" movie that exerts a compelling, hypnotic hold on some viewers, I wish I could say it did the same for me.  In any case, I think I know what Jarmusch is trying to get at.  Johnny Depp plays William Blake, the ""dead man"" who has much to learn about his namesake, his country, and his mortality while undertaking the archetypal journey from provincial Cleveland through a rapacious, exploitive, thoughtless culture ceaselessly engaged in the denial of its origins and its own primitive, life-killing ways.  Blake's mentor-companion throughout the journey is ""Nobody"" (a name adopted by Homer's Odysseus to assist him in his homecoming quest).  ""Nobody"" in turn is a curiously worldly but wise American Indian who knows more about the British poet-painter William Blake's visionary poetry than do most white Americans, certainly more than any other characters in the film.  He is part Virgil, part Charon in his relation to Depp's pilgrim traversing an American landscape that resonates with Dante's ""Inferno"" and Eliot's ""Wasteland.""  He leads Depp but is himself too implicated in a predatory, gun-tainted human ""nature"" (that destroys buffalo and preys on one other with equal indiscrimination) to be able to follow him to his ultimate destiny of a death that is a return to an uncorrupted, God-created nature.

Jarmusch obviously has read the historical William Blake, whose poetry is characterized, above all, by rage, anger, and indignation directed toward a presumptuous, merciless, cruel humanity that ""murders to dissect,"" perversely employing God's gift of reason to shackle and destroy.  The adult British subjects of Blake's poetry defile the Tiger and commit violence upon the Lamb, creatures that for the visionary Blake embody the power and grace of Creation.  In ""Dead Man""'s most memorable scene, Depp comes upon a slaughtered fawn, dips his hands in its blood, then cuddles it while sleeping the night alongside it.  At this moment he is Blake's ""innocent,"" aligned with the higher, spiritual nature that will be his final destiny.  This is the nature that Blake's poetry and Jamusch's movie celebrates, largely by focusing on the distorted impositions that human beings have forced upon a divine creation.

My problem with the movie is with its non-cinematic treatment of the subject.  The high-contrast black and white photography, the wrapping of each and every scene with a fade to black and, last but not least, the relentlessly mono-thematic role of Neil Young's distorted guitar on the soundtrack--these devices call so much attention to themselves that the viewer is forced/compelled/whip-lashed into taking a stand (probably Jarmusch's intention).  Either I acknowledge these techniques as irritations and dismiss the movie; or I acknowledge them as bold strokes that invite me to join the privileged few who choose to embrace and interpret the film (likening  Young's guitar to Blake's ""Songs"" or Jarmusch's mis en scene to Blake's paintings is a stretch).  Although ""Dead Man"" doesn't work for me, the film's popularity with some viewers could bode well for the continuing influence of filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman and Akira Kurosawa.  Its mere acceptance as an intellectually challenging work of art represents a consolation for those of us who refuse to believe that movies must descend to the mind-numbing depths of ""Patch Adams"" and ""Forrest Gump"" to survive.",1118966400,7,3407,5.302973977695167

Depp fans beware, you will have to be a real, die-hard follower to enjoy Dead Man if you don't have a fondness for the bizarre.

Dead Man is filmed in B&W, not the gentle, shade to gray B&W, but a harsh and glaring rendition of psychotic visions.  Dead Man also did not strike me as a professional film, it seemed quite amateurish in it's making and its choppy script, and yet...I enjoyed it.  Drugs would have made it even more enjoyable.

Depp plays William Blake, a man who travels to the small west coast town of Machine to take a job as an accountant in a factory.  When he arrives, he finds the position is already filled, and he has no money to go anywhere.  Blake goes to the tavern and buys whiskey, and when leaving stops to help out a girl selling flowers, who takes him to her rooms for a getting-to-know-you session.

Blake doesn't know that the girl, named Thel, is the fianc of the factory owner's son, and when the son bursts through the door, putting a bullet all the way through Thel and into Blake, Blake manages to shoot him.  Bleeding badly from his wound, Blake skips town on Charlie's horse.  Look for Robert Mitchum as John Dickinson, the factory owner, and Gabriel Byrne as Charlie Dickinson.

When Blake awakens, it is to a fat Indian trying to pull the bullet out of his chest with a knife.  The Indian turns out to be Nobody (Gary Farmer), an half-breed outcast who was educated in London and managed to return to his tribal grounds, but returned with a fondness for the poet William Blake.  Nobody believes this William Blake with the bullet wound is William Blake the poet.

Dickinson puts a bounty out on Blake, hiring three gunslingers to go after him, dead or alive, and bring back the pinto horse he stole.  Nobody takes Blake deeper into the woods, believing Blake is already a dead man and trying to take him to his spiritual grounds.

The movie isn't so much in the plot, but in the fragments of conversation that Blake and Nobody share, and the odd trio of gunslingers.  There are many funny scenes, Cole's campfire meal, the trapper dressed as a woman (Iggy Pop!), beans, and so forth, but the film is far from comedy.

The strangeness of the photography, the choppy script, the segmented scenes, Neil Young's jagged and glaring guitar soundtrack, all lend to the overall surrealism of Blake's journey with Nobody.  Look for short, cameo type roles from Robert Mitchum, Gabriel Byrne, Iggy Pop, Steve Buscemi, Billy Bob Thornton, and John Hurt.  My favorite scene?  Cole's supper, of course.

It reminded me just a bit of Howard Hughes' The Outlaw, only more low-brow and without Jane Russell to hold your attention.  I was under the mistaken impression that non-corporate cinema would be more concerned with exploring serious themes above the heads of the average viewer.  But Jarmusch shows us that the Hollywood establishment also exists to squash imbecilic hedonistic wastes of time like Dead Man (perhaps the establishment isn't so bad after all!).  In fact, Dead Man to me symbolizes the absolute worst of both independent and corporate cinema, all rolled into two hours of B&W film.  The massive A-list of Hollywood talent can't surpass a porno quality of acting as they waddle thru a script that could have been written by a ten-year-old boy.

The cheapish cinematography feels claustrophobic as if it was filmed in a little patch of woods behind the LA County Dump.

Blake's last penny was spent on that ticket and now he is stuck in a strange town far from his native home of Michigan.

Other aspects that make the film so memorable are the brilliant central casting of Gary Farmer (who has the great line: ""Stupid F****ing white man"") in a non-traditional and yet non ""Dances With Wolves"" stereotyped Native American sidekick as well as presence of Pacific Northwest Coastal Indian cultures. In the southwestern centric western film narratives of the past, this is a people largely ignored by Hollywood.

Neil Young's twanging and echoing guitar sends chills up the spine as it tweeters, stutters and chimes on the soundtrack. Johnny Depp again evokes the spirit of Buster Keaton as the clownish angel of death (think Eastwood's ""Man with no name"" trapped in the body of a silent film comedian). Many fine actors (John Hurt, Billy Bob Thorton, Robert Mitchum, Alfred Molina and others) make memorable cameos.

Is this film for everyone? Certainly not. Roger Ebert proudly hails it as one of the films he absolutely hates. If that isn't a reccomendation. I don't know what is.

  Shot entirely in black and white, the film's depiction of violence and blood does not affect the viewer on a visceral level. Instead, the story takes on a poignant, lyrical quality that would not be possible in color. I did not understand the film's allusions to William Blake, having never read the poet, but this film made me want to learn more.

  The greatest appeal of films of this type is that they pose more questions than they answer. As in all true art, everything is not spelled out for the viewer, and we are able to find our own meanings in this film. For me, it represented the interface between this world and the (possible) next. I was reminded of another of my favorite films, Jacob's Ladder. Both deal with a subject many find gruesome, and both these films resolve in a way that I can only describe as trancendental. I loved this movie.

  Of course it would be nothing without Johnnie Depp. He portrays the dying Bill Blake with delicacy and a frail asceticism that is irresistable. And Neil Young's musical background is a minimalist masterpiece. Dead man is one of the most intriquing film I have seen this year.",1104796800,,1305,4.6147186147186146

If this is what you are looking for then don't see this film as this one is truly an unbelievable and genuinely outstanding movie where a viewer's utmost attention is required.

I can honestly say that the viewer will be taken on a journey and live every moment of this film through the eye's of Johnny Depp's character ""William Blake"", and it will actually seem as if you are also on that same journey experiencing it all.

This is a multi layered picture covering many themes such as violence, religion, canibalism, symbolisms and tribal rituals amongst many others. The music is perfectly blended and is at times haunting which ofcourse reflects the dark tones of the film.

You will find yourself watching this film numerous times and each time you will uncover something you hadn't noticed before.

As a traveler in unfamilar territory with only a nascent consciousness of the world, he soon becomes a victim of the reflexive, mechanical violence practiced by one human being upon another.

830022,1,630426786X,"A few months ago I watched the film, Ghost Dog, by this same director. I was interested to see some of his early work to see if I could find the progression to what led him to create the Forest Whitacre samurai story. Sadly, this was not found with Dead Man.  What I did discover, and my wife commented on this as well, was a film directed and written by a man that thinks that he is a genius in the works of William Blake, the poet. We all remember these types of people from college. You know, the ones that sat in the back of the classroom wearing all black that read the works of Blake for fun and while getting high on a Friday night. Well, that guy sitting in the back of my class was Jim Jarmusch, and he proceeded to take his late night ""hallucinations"" and created the film Dead Man.

This film was horrible. I don't use that word lightly, but this film ranks as one of the worst of 1995. While this film is on the top ten of most critics for that year, I would have to credit this to a lack of independent films in the mainstream market. 1995 was the year when independent films were just starting to become more mainstream. Audiences were not yet fully developed in films where actors would work for the art they were doing instead of the paycheck they were going to receive. So, I can only assume, that by today's standards this film would just be passed off as a ""normal"" film that was poorly written and horribly acted. BUT, in 1995, this film was praised as new and innovated because mainstream independent films had yet to be fully developed. This is the only reason that I can think for the popularity behind this film.

The acting was horrible and the direction was choppy.  Apparently, Jarmusch knew he could capture critics in his web by releasing a ""new-age"" story based in the Wild West.  He also thought that he could use actors notorious for doing low-budget films (not yet called independent films) to create the story that he wanted. Unfortunately, what he got was a hodge-podge of different acting styles that just didn't seem to work in this film. The use of ""fade to black"" made me wish that he had used the song from the Rolling Stones to even further his point. This was also one of those films where Jarmusch knew he didn't have a very wordy script, so he included so many ""staring off into space"" scenes that were to symbolize life and complexities of nature. It didn't work for me in this film. I felt it was just more of filler than anything else.

Also, I don't think that Neil Young's guitar was the best choice of music to bring me into the time (or era) that this film was based.  I felt like I was, again, sitting in a dorm room one late night with a stoner who loved the poetry of William Blake and the music of Neil Young.

In other words, had the entire pace of the film been quickened, perhaps Jarmusch's voyage into the depths of doom and despair may have been more effective.

I would like to end with a quote from a critic about the film Dead Man. If you understand this, then I think you will really like this movie. If you do not, then you can join me in the front of the class smoking my candy cigarette.

""Enter the town of Machine, and you'll be processed as well. Just watch out for snags along the trail - they make the journey a bit annoying, and certainly longer than what is warranted by the reaches of the attention span...or simply the principles of artistic efficiency.""

830024,5,630426786X,"Whoever wrote the review above must not have seen this movie.  it isn't a typical movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a subtle and well balanced film that every fan of zen flicks, spaghetti westerns, and more psychedelic fare should check out.

This movie is based off a man by the name of William Blake, played perfectly by Johnnie Depp.  He is a timid man who is going to a small western town and the end of the railroad for a job offer.  He looks like he has lived a sheltered life and is shocked by what he sees on the frontier.  When he arrives in the town he finds that the job was given to someone else and the owner is a psychopath that chases him out of the factory.  He links up with a woman who is also down on her luck at the bar and ends up having sex with her.  It turns out that she was engaged to a man that still wants it to work and he walks in on them.  In a fit of rage, he shoots at william blake but hits her, and is in turn shot by William.  But you soon find that the bullet passed through her and into him.

This is where the movie really stars to pick up.  He starts to run and is found by a native, played by David Farmer, that tried to help him.  But proclaims that the bullet is too close to his heart to cut out, and he is a dead man.  He mistakes him for the real william blake whom he has read and is a big fan of.  he then decides he must take him on a journey to the west, where his destiney lies.

This is a very stylized movie, the pacing has a slow surreal quality to it.  Things that should be common place look odd and often menacing.  The fact that the main character feels this strongly adds to this.  It has a strong feeling of a zen movie with its phiolsophies and balance of events and characters.  But never strays away from the bizarre journey that it is is.

The actors were all perfect for their roles.  Johnnie Depp is as good as usual, becoming another completely different character with the sheltered William Blake.  The hunters offer a strange comic relief, made up of the quiet and menacing Lance Henrikson, and the oddly comical Michael Wincott(one of his few comical roles).  As well as packing the movie full of cameos, Gibby Haynes, John Hurt, Robert Mitchum, Alfred Molina, Iggy Pop, Billy Bob Thorton, Steve Buscemi, Crispin Glover etc.....  Many only have small roles, but seem to fit perfectly regardless of their lack of screen time.

This movie is very thought provoking, relying heavily on imagery and pace to convey its message rather than dialogue.  The music is done by Neil Young and gives it the feel of a spaghetti western, blairing in with loud twangy chords to set the mood.

This is a hard movie to describe, it has elements of a zen movie, a western, a b movie, etc....  But it is excellently balanced, well directed, and has top notch acting.  It also pulls off being funny, introspective, dire, and surreal in a successful manner.  None of the elements overshadow other parts of it.  so I highly advise this movie to any fans of the above mentioned genres.  Just don't expect anything, it will probably suprise you, and you will probably see something differnt than I did or whoever you happen to watch it with.  Bottom line is, watch it.",1095206400,7,3230,4.268533772652389

830112,3,630426786X,"Jim Jarmusch's DEAD MAN starts on a westbound train sometime in the late 19th century.  Johnny Depp is a young man going west, and in the long opening sequence we don't stray off the train or far from Depp.  Through a string of fade-outs we note the landscape and the passengers slowly change.  We are moving away from civilization, and en route the number of women decreases to nothing.  Men grow shaggier and more wild looking.  The first eight minutes of DEAD MAN set the hook deep in me, and allowed me to overlook its excesses and enjoy it.
 Depp arrives in the town of Machine to discover the job he was traveling to was filled my another applicant.  The owner of Dickinson's Metal Works (Robert Mitchum) orders him out at the point of a gun.  Depp hits a saloon, meets a woman selling paper roses, trysts, gets discovered by ex-lover Gabriel Byrne, shares a bullet with his tryst-mate, shoots Byrne, and flees into the movie proper.
  Depp wakes the next morning with a 300-pound Indian sitting on him, digging a knife into his chest. The bullet is lodged near his heart.  After some palaver the two introduce themselves.  William Blake, meet Nobody.  Nobody, played by Gary Farmer, was kidnapped by the English and attended school in London, where he fell under the spell of William Blake, poet.  Nobody believes the Depp William Blake is THAT William Blake.  And he believes that he is a dead man.  Nobody takes it upon himself to take Blake to the point of departure to the spirit world.
 It stretches credibility a little... okay, a lot... but I found the scenes between Depp and Farmer extremely enjoyable.  If you accept the logic of the situation the dialogue between the two is sometimes absurdly funny:
 Nobody: Did you kill the white man who killed you?
 William Blake: I'm not dead
 Later... Nobody: But I understand you, William Blake.  You were a poet and a painter.  But now you are a killer of white men.
 And I may be in a minority, but I even thought Neil Young's score - mostly playing a solo guitar under the scenes - worked well.  If was by turns driving and pulsating, if not necessarily tuneful.
 Jarmusch took the wrong approach with the other characters, though.  The white bounty hunters and town's people and travelers are too grotesquely portrayed.  A movie can only handle so many sociopaths, and DEAD MAN is chock full of them.  If they aren't demented, they're cannibals, or cross-dressers (Hi Iggy Pop.)  If I watch this one again, I'll use the dvd's scene selection option and skip over about half the movie.  The symbolism is laid on a little thick, as well.  At one point William Blake comes across a dead fawn.  He dips his finger into the fawn's blood, mixes it with blood from his own open wound, and smears the mixture onto his forehead and chin before lying down next to the dead animal.  He's on a Vision Quest, you see, and apparently the quest has led to identity himself with the slain fawn.  This scene occurs AFTER he's killed three or four men, so his embrace of innocence is open to question.
 DEAD MAN looks good, capturing the feel and appearance of the late-19th century Pacific Northwest in glorious black and white.  I'm giving it a weak endorsement.  I liked quite a bit of it, but I had to ignore a lot as well.",1086739200,69,3272,4.567986230636833

Jim Jarmusch is known for his keen sense of cinematography and laughs, but this picture shoots straight from the hip of seriousness and straight-forward conciousness:  Silent, subtle, and poignant, this film is brilliant.
  Driven by a powerful subtext, this movie finds Johnny Depp as William Blake (hint:  Not the dead poet) who is steering a seemingly promising life, straight into a dimming light, toward a city of burgeoning industry, somewhere in the old west.  Complete with an encounter with a an Native American Indian named Nowhere, whom soon becomes his guide, he sets out to find, unknowingly, what it is that his life has in store for him.  Throughout his travels, deep into woodlands, he makes his way toward, to meet what it is he does not yet completely understand.
  The underratted facet of this movie, is the fact that it is shot completely in black and white (or, as my friends refer to it, Blake and White); an aspect of film that has not been efficiently accomplished since ""Young Frankenstein"".  A perfectly foreshadowing cameo from Crispin Glover rounds out a cast that includes Robert Mitchum and Iggy Pop.  Watch this and please be impressed by the purely natural feel to this movie, for it is an art that has been lost with the passing of such directors as Alfred Hitchcock and Akira Kurosawa.",1082678400,,1648,4.931159420289855

The first time I rented this film, I watched it twice in a row. It is one of the most utterly captivating films I have ever seen. Photographed brilliantly in black and white across the western US, this film takes you on a journey through a surrealistc landscape filled with bizzare characters. Its complete vision is more of a tone poem - a meditation on superficially anomalous diversions of thought.  If you can have a little patience and an open mind, you will find incredible beauty here. A special nod to Lance Henricksen, who has given one of his finest performances; and to Neil Young for his incredible score that juxtaposes electric grunge with a simple western theme, affectively merging image and music into the totemic and iconic realm of 2001: A Space Odyssey.",1080604800,2,915,4.71875

830191,3,630426786X,"The screenplay is probably the best thing about the film. The spasmotic and threatening verbal interaction between crass and ignorant characters does more to portray the hard world of the West than does the gun play. Blake (Johnny Depp) is the innocent from the East sent to work in the wild wild West. He is the pure and decent man corrupted by the world. Nobody (Gary Farmer), a Native American, adopts him and guides him as he tries to escape the corruption. Blake is pursued by evil men, such as the bounty hunter Cole Wilson (Lance Henriksen), intent on killing him for some perceived crime. The end clearly reveals the angel vs. demon aspect of Nobody and Cole. The fade-to-black segue is overused as is the overamped electric guitar soundtrack. The cast is loaded with talent and there are some quiet references to cult and folk heroes, such as Benmont Tench of the Heartbreakers and Lee Marvin, who played probably the most memorable bad guy cowboy role in any western -- Liberty Valence. The obvious play on the name William Blake provides the basis for the screenplay -- an ode to Songs of Experience, I should think. The only thing I did not like is Depp's acting. He had one expression -- blank. Fortunately, it made little difference as his character is merely the vessel of the human spirit and not its personification.",1075248000,11,1333,4.725321888412017

The spectacular photography only accentuates the ridiculous sets, the endless guitar noodling, played, I am sure, straight through while a sleepy Neil watched the film for the first time, the staggeringly bad performances by many fine stars, and the anachronistic dialog and consistently perplexing locations make for a jumble that I, at least, cannot sort out. Nor do I want to.
One imagines slightly stoned college kids watching this mishmash and finding its observations about the white man's stupidity and cruelty movingly profound. They're not. And the humor is neither wry nor surprising. It is predictable, forced, and completely unbelievable.
When a film tries to create a surreal world, slightly fantastic and yet somehow touching reality, there is a difficult border to maintain. This film misses it completely. Too often I was wondering why these unreal characters in unreal places should create a response in me, or I squawked at the illogical or downright stupid aspects of the film. For instance, in the opening sequence, they travel west across a desert, and then the buffalo hunting begins. Where might that be?

The story is that Johnny Depp's character, William Blake, is going to Machinetown in order to apply for a job as an accountant. Upon his arrival, he finds that someone else has the job. After being laughed at, he goes to the bar to find solace. He then encounters a beatiful prositute, Charlie Dickinson. She sleeps with him, and the next morning, her husband finds the two in bed. He tries to shoot Blake, but ends up killing Charlie instead. William Blake then kills Charlie's husband, then rides off into the woods. The next day, he meets a strange Indian named Nobody, who is played by Gary Farmer (and really good too). He mistakes Blake for the poet and becomes his ""guide"" into the spirit world. Confusing?

Dead Man, no doubt, will be loathed by some as being meandering and slow. However, I'm one who was thought this was absolutely brilliant. Some would probably describe this as just the story of someone who is fatally injured right at the beginning of the film and spends the rest of the time dying - and they'd be right - but it wouldn't do justice to the amazing acting of all concerned (esp. the bounty hunters - The talkative Michael Wincott - who still manages to keep talking after being shot about 6 times, and the scary, taciturn Lance Henrikson).
Johnny Depp (Bill Blake) yet again proves what a good actor he is, he was totally believable as the accountant who finds himself penniless and adrift in an totally alien world and his slow descent from a ""stupid white man"" to ""killer of white men"".
Gary Farmer was excellent as Nobody, an English-educated Indian with a love for Williams Blake's poetry and a desire to see Blake ""return"" to the spirit world in the proper way. There are also some great parts played by Alfred Molina as the missionary, Iggy Pop, Bill Bob Thornton, Gabriel Byrne, John Hurt etc., all of whom added to the surreal atmosphere.
The black and white photography is magical, the story is bleak, funny, shocking, uplifting and painful in equal parts.
If you like your films full of action and don't want to think too much about the plot - this one is definitely not for you. If you love films that can be interpreted on many levels, with interesting characters, great acting and wonderful photography, you may - just possibly - love this film.",1070496000,5,1775,4.584905660377358
830267,5,630426786X,"This film, from director Jim Jarmusch, is a benchmark. It sets the tone for all bizarre westerns. It plays out fitfully; jagged like a nightmare. The black & white cinematography by Robby Muller is crisp and innovative; creating a Noir acid-dream atmosphere. The musical score, by Neil Young, initially thrills us; just the right chords and throbs. Then it becomes tediously repetitive. Is this intentional ? Is Jarmusch using this repetition as a motif ? Possibly.
I felt that from the opening credits the whole film was done in flashbacks. As the frontier train rumbled toward its dark destination, there were a series of fade-outs; with passengers changing into others, and terrain metamorphosing into a bleak arrid wasteland. The fades were like blinks, making the new scenes more illusionary and dreamlike.
Johnny Depp, with his performance of William Blake, added to his personal pantheon of eccentric roles. Part Buster Keaton, part William Bonney, Depp wandered the streets of a decaying town knee-deep in mud and depravity. We wanted to laugh, but were afraid to. In that desolate town, nothing appeared normal. The townsfolk were zombie-like, or possessed by unseen demons. Madness coarsed through the streets like a hot wind. Towering over the edge of town, like the feudal castle of Vlad, the Dickinson Metal Works belched black smoke into a cloudless sky.
Lied to and betrayed, Depp barged into the office of the owner, John Dickinson; played by Robert Mitchum. The character is obviously insane, paranoic, and dangerous. Rushing from the cavernous darkness of the factory, Depp found himself desolate, lost, and desperate. Wandering aimlessly, he met and bedded a flower girl (Mili Avital). She happened to be the former girlfriend of Dickinson's son Charlie. In the midst of their passion, Gabriel Byrne, as Charlie, burst into her room and in a fit of rage, shot her and Depp. In self-defense, Blake killed the intruder. Mortally wounded Depp began his flight, his quest, his Death Adventure.
The entire cast is first-rate. Gary Farmer, as the European-educated Indian ""Nobody"", dominates the film. Was he a spirit guide, an angel of death, or just a native American vagabond ?
We can decide for ourselves. Lance Henriksen and Michael Wincott are killers hired to hunt down Blake. Their portrayals are vivid and off-beat; especially Henriksen as Cole Wilson; evil incarnate. Along the way, as his strength ebbed, Depp met many colorful characters; an odyssey of sorts. One night he chanced onto a meeting with Billy Bob Thornton ( Big George ), and Iggy Pop as Sabatore ""Sally"" Jenko, attired in a dress and bonnet. They, too, had to be dispatched by Blake; in self-defense. As the death toll rose, it seemed odd that Blake never picked up a discarded weapon, or more ammunition. This was another inconsistency that pointed to the possibility that the film represented the last gasps, the sordid dreams of a wounded dying man. John Hurt, Crispin Glover, Alfred Molina, and Steve Buscemi spice up the narrative with sparkling off-center characters.
The film is unsettling, illogical, mildly maddening and wildly creative; both frightening and fascinating, like petting a pit viper. The end appears to be the beginning, dipping us into the cyle of a life; hinting that Death is not an end, rather it is a transition; that each life is but a smudge on a larger canvas.",1067385600,9,3381,5.060931899641577

The streets are muddy, the women are treated terribly...and everyone seems to be on the verge of insanity. Welcome to the Wild West.
I won't go too much into the plot, but William is rejected from the job he had been promised and is left with no money and no place to stay. He gets involved unknowingly in a love triangle and ends up fleeing the town as a wanted man for the murder of two citizens.
As William flees, he is aided by a remarkable Native American who calls himself ""Nobody"" (played to perfection by Gary Farmer). He is also hunted by three men who cliam to be the best killers in the West.
The cast, incredible. The direction, impeccable. The soundtrack, perfect (although some would argue that it simply sounds like a bunch of noise being made by a guitar). The script is witty enough to lighten the often heavy mood of the film, and the characters are very colorful (one of my favorites is the too friendly and very creepy Crispen Glover character, just see what kind of feeling you get from this friendly guy who has perhaps been working on the coal train too long)

At the time of its release, it commanded a bit of a stir but quickly went gently into that good night.  Unfortunately, I had not had a chance to see it before it came to cable.  Upon my first viewing, I immediately fell in love with it.

The story, set in the 19th century, centers around an accountant wearing a positively horrible suit who receives an offer of employment in this even more horrible town only to arrive a month too late to discover they had given his job to someone else.  He demands to see the boss, Robert Mitchum, whose performance is a stitch, quickly frightens him into letting well enough alone.

He then encounters a myriad of off-beat characters in his quest to survive.  Johnny's performance is enhanced by the quirky characters that abound in this story and it is fun trying to figure out who is who.  Your typical Western, this certainly is not, but the performances all around make this quite a memorable viewing experience.  Additionally, the sound track by Neil Young complements the film perfectly.

The film is multi-layered and I can assure you that on each viewing, you will undoubtedly discover some nuance you had missed before.

Suffice it to say, it is a story that perfectly captures the ""survival of the fittest"" theme.  There is nothing disappointing about it at all, though I must caution you, you may find yourself at the beginning asking ""What on earth is this about?!!""

Devoid of all humor, and even all color, the recurring joke of the movie deals with the fact that Blake never has tobacco, no matter how many times the Indian, the transvestites, the cannibals or anyone else might ask him. Pretty funny stuff, huh?
After defending himself in a fight, he goes on the lam and in practical slow motion rides around the forest doing nothing, while encountering other people who also do nothing. Then he dies. During his meanderings, he thinks of nothing, and really learns nothing either. No themes of life or death are explored. It's so deliberately empty of anything resembling rationality that some poor souls have fallen for it. Read the other reviews and see how many people who love the film cannot really describe it.

830341,4,630426786X,"Dead Man (Jim Jarmusch, 1995)
Dead Man may be the most underrated film of the last two decades, a brilliant, surrealist look at the Old West through the eyes of a number of characters just as brilliant and surrealist as their landscape.
William Blake (Johnny Depp) is an accountant from Cleveland, and perhaps a reincarnation of the poet of the same name. He is offered a job in the pre-Civil War west, and goes out to take it. When he gets to the firm who offered him the job, the supervisor (John Hurt) tells him the job was given to someone else, since he was late. He insists on seeing the firm's owner (Robert Mitchum), who cashes him out of the office with a shotgun. That night, in the hotel where Blake is staying, two people are murdered. They happen to the be firm's owner's daughter and her fiance. Blake is an easy target, and his pursuit and reaction to it forms the basis of the film.
Strong, wonderful performances about in this movie. The best of all is that of Gary Farmer, as Nobody, an Indian whose job, is says, is to prepare the soul of William Blake to go back to the land of the spirits. Nobody becomes Blake's sidekick and sometime mentor, helping him to understand how to get along in the West. Among those assassins sent out after Blake: a trio of crossdressing homosexuals (Iggy Pop, Billy Bob Thornton, and Jared Harris); an amoral cannibal and his two wannabe sidekicks (Lance Henriksen, Michael Wincott, and Eugene Byrd), and, hearing it through the grapevine, a pair of U. S. Marshals (Jimmie Ray Weeks, Mark Bringleson).
As should be obvious from the list above, this movie is packed with starpower. (And I didn't mention Gabriel Byrne, Crispin Glover, Alfred Molina, Gibby Haynes, Steve Buscemi, and a handful of others with smaller roles.)

This is not a perfect film. It's themes are muddled; the William Blake references are slightly 'hokey' and would seem extraneous for anyone who has read the poetry in question. Although Depp's character is a sufficiently subverted quirk on the familiar 'man without a name' paradigm, Famer's 'metaphysical Native American' performance at times threatens to degenerate into unintentional parody. Jarmusch, with this film, has tried too hard to iconoclastically subvert the familiar tenets of the Western. It was a noble attempt, which succeeds in fits and starts (especially the relationship between Depp's quirky chracter and his complement, 'Nobody') but must be deemed a (relative) failure.
Still, there is much to be admired; Neil Young's guitar and Robby Muller's gorgeous photography. Also, Jarmusch's languidly moody direction is a definite plus.",1050624000,8,1055,5.6415094339622645

Only one critic really got it right and that's the usually reliable Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader whose Dead Man review titled ""Acid Western"" is a must-read.  Rosenbaum also wrote a BFI book on Dead Man which is highly recommended.
Dead Man is the first movie I ever went to the theater on three consecutive days to watch.  The movie pulls me into its world like few others - 2001, Taxi Driver and Stranger Than Paradise come to mind.  Muller's b&w photography is stunning and Neil Young's soundtrack is one of the best ever recorded (Ebert, who hated the film, says it sounds like ""a man repeatedly dropping his guitar"" but then Ebert, as fine as man as he is, also thinks Tomb Raider, XXX and Daredevil are good movies.)
Some people will find Dead Man unbearably slow.  Others will find it hypnotic.  Those in the latter group will find the movie to be a unique, special experience, the kind only an auteur like Jarmusch can provide.  Nobody is one of the most unforgettable characters in modern cinema.
This is one of those movies, like Stranger Than Paradise, which makes me want to thank the director.  So, to Mr. Jarmusch, thank you so very much.  You've made my life richer with this movie.",1045699200,15,1314,4.682608695652174

830403,4,630426786X,"Jarmusch movies have always been a kind of hit or miss for most people, mainly because he's one of those directors whose name always pops up in serious conversations about cinema where a good three quarters of the people involved in the discussion haven't actually seen any of his movies. He's one of those filmmakers who seems to elicit a reflexive nod of recognition among those who can't name a single piece by him. Something like Hal Hartley in connotation.
Having said that, ""Dead Man"" is a great flick that got buried in generalized expectations and conclusions. Sure, it's a failed revisionist Western, and sure, the literary and cultural references are patronizing, and sure the choice of black and white over full color dirty Depp smacks of pretentiousness. But all of these apparent misconnections eventually translate into an indulgence on the part of Jarmusch that ends up being a truly meditative, strangely un-American and un-Western, perhaps even zen experience.
For example and in particular are the scenes around campfires, where characters engage in confounding conversation, sleep, literaral and figurative awakenings, and cannibalism, where narrative loses focus and the activity taking place in the dull lightning flashes of the fire, however sedentary or offensive, becomes its own commentary.
Weirdly enough, this isn't anything new, which is what's so surprising about how this movie has been generally received, even after the many years (by American movie standards) it's been around.
Given the context of his better received works (ie,""Mystery Train"" and ""Night On Earth""), it's actually, and suprisingly enough, refreshing to watch ""Dead Man."" It's not a movie to invite your friends over to watch for laughs or action, but certainly worth watching on a rainy night meant for conversation.

830404,5,630426786X,"As a child I loved the small candyballs made of layers of sugar in different colours. As you kept it patiently in your mouth, it changed its colour continuously. This amazing and wonderful movie is like that.
The first many times I watched it, it was confusing, fascinating, painful, disturbing and I was shifting from laughter to shock back to laughter. I couldn't stay away from it, it was a mystery to be solved.
I then began noticing the beauty of the movie, which was also confusing and fascinating because the contents of many of the scenes are anything but beautiful. Why did I then find the movie to be one of the most beautiful things, I had ever seen? How could violence be so poetic and still not be glorified?
A phase of quiet and intuitive understanding grew out of this, viewings became almost like a meditation. This phase lasted for quite some time, pure pleasure, but then the painful seriousnes of the movie slowly took over, and after perhaps 25 viewings I was ""hit"" by the enourmous sadness. I hadn't really noticed the sadness during the first viewings, it kind of took me by surprise at one point, making it almost impossible to laugh anymore.
This phase also lasted for many viewings, so many that I thought that the movie could bring no more surprises.
And then suddenly one day it seemed strangely new and unknown to me again and it fell on me as a shock: It's all love! The love between Bill and Nobody. The love of the american wildernes. The love of poetry. I could suddenly see all the love it must have taken to make this movie. Jarmusch must have written the script with his heartblood and all of his love in order to be able to create such a story and such characters. The actors must have really loved it (and Jim Jarmusch) to accept a probably rather poorly paid part in this unfasionable movie, and in order to be able to play the characters so that they come to live and seem strangely touching (even the evil ones) and believable in spite of the on the surface rather unlikely story. Neil Young must really have loved it in order to make the heartwrenching music and the photographer must have put his heart and soul in making the characters and the landscape present in a naked kind of way that make you almost feel part of the scene.
The love of all these artists flows from every scene, and as a viewer you sense this and you end up loving the movie because of the strange depths of your soul that it brings you in contact with. This is partly why the movie is so fascinating and so totally in its own league.
So - after many, many viewings what to me comes out as the strongest impression from this at first sight dark, violent, confusing and pessimistic masterpiece is the strange glow of trandescent love that unexpectedly radiates from it, when all the other layers have been peeled of.",1033430400,7,2830,4.475822050290136
830454,5,630426786X,"Is there any doubt that Jarmusch is the greatest living American filmmaker?  Certainly now that Woody Allen is well past his prime, I think not.  All of the man's films just blow my mind, Dead Man being no exception.
Unfortunately, as much as I love them, I always find myself floundering when called upon to explain exactly what it is that fuels this appeal.  Jarmusch is nothing if not subtle, and the poetry is so finely woven into the work that it's difficult to do anything other than take the work as a whole.  What it comes down to, I expect, is that the brilliantly stylized settings and cinematography, the invariably well-written dialogue, and the distinctive soundtracks come together as more than the sum of their parts.
I have no explanation for the poor reviews Dead Man has received, other than the general stupidity of the American film-viewing public.  The word 'slow-moving' is often used in a negative sense, suggesting that some people just can't tolerate watching a film without explosions, gee-whiz special effects, and snappy one-liners every five minutes.  As with so many things in life, a good part of the blame can probably be leveled at Star Wars.
However, this does not apply to you.  You are not a soul-deadened consumer-drone.  You are an intelligent, thoughtful person, and you should therefore pay no heed to the naysayers (and especially to the previous reviewer--rarely have I seen a more stupidly wrong-headed critique of ANYTHING), and give Dead Man a go.

But it's Gary Farmer who steals the show as Nobody, the mixed breed Indian who was raised in the White Man's world. Part mystic guide, part prankster.

Depp keeps nodding off and each time he opens his eyes he sees a dramatically changed world as the train ventures further and further into the frontier. It is also during these opening scenes that we hear the first harsh chords of NeilYoung's very memorable guitar only soundtrack. Depp is in easterner on his way west to find work. His plaid suit stands out more and more as a most unfitting attire as he gets closer to his destination.  The job turns out not to be available after all and the plot of the movie becomes the education of an easterner on the western frontier.  The plot is rather simple as Depp gets involved with a girl whose boyfriend tries to kill him. In self-defense Depp kills the boyfriend and for the rest of the movie he is a hunted man, or a dead man. The only person who befriends him  is a half breed called Nobody who was captured as a young boy and educated in England and so knows and quotes the poetry of William Blake assuming Depp to be the selfsame poet/painter. As they escape the bounty hunters, hired killers, and sherriff's(many of these characters played by disguised stars such as Robert Mitchum, Crispin Glover, Billy Bob Thornton, Iggy Pop) on their trail they become great friends. Highly entertaining western with just enough art in its cinematography and soundtrack to give it a special evocative power and charm all its own. One of the few movies I have purchased and  am glad to own. The episodic nature of the story and the excellent characters and dialogue which is often very funny makes it one you will want to see more times than once.

Then there are the other's who proclaim it a masterpiece, a meditation on the intrusion of European man into the New World, and a commentary on William Blake's ""The Marriage of Heaven and Hell"".  Well, it's that too.
But what cracks me up is that so many people blithely dismiss Gary Farmer's performance in this film.  Perhaps he's not ""indian"" enough.  I believe that his role was intentionally made as a slap in the face to America's perception of the Native American.  We are made to expect a lithe, sinewy, loin-cloth clad, brown-skinned fellow spouting pseudo-mystic back-to-nature platitudes.  What does this film give us but big Gary Farmer.  Sure he's spouting seemingly pseudo-mystic pronunciations, but so many of these are just an example of Nobody's incredibly biting humor.  (""How did you know I was here?""  ""Often the stench of white man precedes him."")  It may take a slight perceptory switch to understand how funny Farmer actually was in this role.  Bravo to Farmer and Jarmusch for creating a role that makes a real person of a Native American, and not a simple conformity to the cozy idea of an ""indian"".  For the record, Farmer is very much Indian.  Cayuga, to be exact.
But alright, I'm with the ""meditation"" people on this movie.  The relaxed, black and white approach of this movie points to the symbolic aspects of the film.  Every scene is a furthering of the journey of our protagonist William Blake.  Joseph Campbell would be flying about the room with this movie.
I also enjoy Neil Young's meandering guitar score.  I liked it so much I bought the soundtrack.
DEAD MAN is as sure an example of any as Jarmusch's desire to understand the intersection of a culture he was raised in and others he doesn't know.  While it may seem overwhelmingly bleak to some (How could it not?  Look at the outcome.), it's probably one of the most understatedly humorous examples of the form you'll ever see.",1028505600,5,2046,4.7585227272727275

Nevertheless ""Dead Man"" has obviously made quite an impression on some of them, in fact so much, that they get themselves all worked up and can't wait to forget it. An apparently unexpectedly difficult decision to follow through, the alleged emptiness of the movie taken into consideration.
Some of these angry reviewers obviously HAVE thought about it a great deal too, but it seems to have resulted in little more than a headache and a bad mood because they, like most of us after the first viewing, ended up confused. This can be a frustrating and scary experience, and with little tolerance for ambiguity and sad feelings they choose to give the movie neither a second thought nor a second viewing. They are thereby denying themselves a totally unique experience of coming to love a movie more each time you view it, even after 10 or 20 viewings.
Yes, it is a sad, disturbing and confusing movie! But for most people life is at times sad, disturbing and confusing, and for some it takes a turn where there is no going back to the wellknown, there is only the painful task of letting go. Jarmusch's movie illustrates this like no other movie that I now of, and does it in a way that adds terrifying beauty to the sorrowfull recognition of this. The sadness and the beauty imbedded in every second of the movie points to something deeply human and trandescent beyond the pitcblack emptiness that some reviewers limit their insight to.

Some are born to endless night.
  --William Blake
Blake knew (as who does not?) that the Poet has a murderer's heart and is condemned to live apart--marked and wounded--in the black margins of the everyday, envious and uncomprehending of ordinary happiness. ""Dead Man"" is engraved in the blacks and whites of this primal struggle. Individuality vs society. The soul vs mechanized civilization. The Poet's quest vs the appetites of life. Blake, the author of ""The Marriage of Heaven and Hell,"" knew that all creativity flows from the clash of opposites--from discord, rebellion, ambivalence.
In the first scene, Depp is a Lost Spirit, shuttling in a blackened fugue state, on a symbolic train. A solitary, still body--a Northern Star--aloof from the many landscapes and passengers (the passing generations) which flicker by. But the train has a destination: the blood-soaked bed where William Blake is destined to re-enter life. Though he cannot know it, he is a ""rough beast...slouching toward Bethlehem to be born.""
The perfect, pristine landscapes give way to a venereal scar on the earth: the factory town of Machine. In its feculent streets of blood, dung and tears, Depp gawks slack-jawed at the seeds of evil in this mercenary pus-hole: a prostitute wolfing on a drunk in broad daylight, the first of several cannibal motifs. (This may also allude to the so-called Primal Scene: the Child's shocked discovery of the sexual hunger of the adults who nurtured him).
Soon the Freudian gaze sharpens to the point of conflagration--when a flower girl (a Flower in the Machine!) takes Depp home to deflower him. They are surprised by her lover (Gabriel Byrne), and a Freudian bloodbath ensues. The Father has caught his Oedipal son in the forbidden bed. His phallic retribution (a bullet) pierces the Mother, and William Blake re-enters the world with the Poet's seed of death next to his heart. The bullet is both the sperm of creation and Depp's deadly legacy. The Mother's breast spurts--not milk but blood, and her blood-fed son finds a gun in his hand.
This is important. The first William Blake (1757-1827) was in open rebellion against the industrialization of his country. His violent, messianic verse condemned England's ""dark Satanic mills,"" which laid waste to the ""green and pleasant land"" and drowned the pastoral music of life in the grinding of machines. The spirits of the earth, to whom poets traditionally listened, were growing silent.
Now the rot has found the wildness of the New World--the West--and the situation is desperate. Blake Reborn is no less cursed to darkness, but now words alone will not do. An inhuman, ravenous, psychotic society must be answered with blood. Depp kills the Father (son of the Factory), as all poets must. This Oedipal overthrow brings the Furies of society against him. Factory magnate Mitchum (who kills and stuffs Nature) marshals a band of killers, a microcosm of unnatural, self-devouring civilization. (This oxymoronic ""society of outlaws"" implodes spectacularly).
So the Poet is born an outlaw and wounded animal. His mentor and guide is Nobody, a loner from a dying race, who knows where the spirits of the earth reside. With his help, Blake communes with them and perfects his poetry of blood. His metaphorical passage to the Land of Spirits, ending with the great scene adrift on the gray waters of death, is brutal, beautiful, indelible.",1017446400,15,3432,5.083333333333333

This left a bad impression and I was slow to return to the film until I saw it on Czech television (without commercial interruption). By then I was infatuated and have since purchased the DVD to study the terms and conditions of its claim on my imagination. The sometimes scorching, oftimes lyrical Neil Young score is so intertwined now with my appreciation of the film that its first aborted attempt to lay claim to my interest has receded. Jarmusch has found the great idiomatic middle ground of art by intonation - i.e., the making of a film that hardly requires dialog at all. The freakish elements of the narrative (the occasional gruesomeness) seem almost outtakes, and it may well be simply a gesture at pure surreality for Jarmusch to include the pathetic to compensate for the intense pain of the black-and-white odyssey towards death made by William Blake (Johnny Depp), ne'er do well and waif shipwrecked in the bleak and sinister twilight of the Wild West. Gary Farmer as Nobody, Blakes' Indian guide to the edge of the other side, is both a hoot and a well-crafted play on the noble savage.

Perhaps that was intentional; certainly, the story revolves around death and what it means to be dead.
The characterizations here are little gems in almost every case, and it's always surprising to me how Jarmusch can tell so much about characters with so little screen time.

Set in the late nineteenth century, we see Johnny Depp playing William Blake, a young accountant who gives up his sheltered life in Cleveland to head out to the Wild West. He has a job offer from a manufacturing company owned by John Dickinson (Robert Mitchum) in a lawless town called Machine which is literally, ""the end of the line.""
The film starts with his train journey out to the west and we see him becoming gradually more uneasy as the civilised East turns into the rough and dirty West. All too soon he is in Machine where he finds out that the job has gone to another man bacause Blake took too long in getting there. Out of money, he ends up in bed with Thel Russell (Mili Avital) the prettiest girl in town. When her boyfriend arrives, Blake's troubles get worse. After the ensuing gunfight, Blake flees, mortally wounded and leaving two bodies behind him.
The father of the dead boyfriend, Dickinson again, hires a group of killers to catch Blake. Also, he calls in the Marshals and posts public rewards. Since this is a road movie, Blake needs a buddy and he teams up with Nobody (Gary Farmer) an outcast Native American who just happens to have a passion for the poems of the more famous William Blake. Nobody accepts Blake as the embodiment of the real poet and assumes, because the the poet had already died and the man he sees now is slowly dying, that Blake must seek a place to die and return to the world beyond.
Nobody sets out to help and guide him on his journey. They must dodge the bounty hunters, marshals and citizens who want the reward and along the way, Blake turns into a man who can kill without remorse.
Surreal barely describes the people that they meet and, generally, kill on the way. There is a lot of humour ranging from Nobody's observations of European ""civilisation"" to the constant sniping (figurative and literal) between the three bounty hunters sent to kill Blake.
Shooting the film in black and white and using a soundtrack that is just a constant guitar presence rather than a set of songs, gives the film a outward appearance that well matches the content.

830810,5,630426786X,"How unfair is it that Tim Keogh of the Amazon. Com organization gets to lead off the list of reviews for this movie by stating - ""This disappointment from Jim Jarmusch stars Johnny Depp in a mystery Western about a 19th-century accountant named William Blake, who spends his last coin getting to a hellish mud town in Texas and ends up penniless and doom struck in the wilderness."" I don't know if Tim was busy stuffing his face with popcorn but he makes three erroneous statements in this first line of his totally off-base review.
  1) This movie is not a mystery! 2) Johnny Depp spends his last coin buying whiskey. 3) The ""hellish mud town"" of Machine is on the West Coast - not Texas. (After all, it would take a while to ride by horseback from Texas to British Columbia where the Coastal Indian Tribes were located).
You may be asking yourself why I take issue with such mundane details? The answer is obvious - to prove the point that Tim Keogh wasn't even watching this movie, and therefore, has no right to review it. Simply put, Dead Man is a cinematic masterpiece! Jim Jarmusch has made a number of strong movies, but Dead Man surpasses the others as a brilliant work of art.
You can see by reading the other reviews that support for Dead Man borders on fanatical. There are few movies that I have watched repeatedly but I continue to see this one over and over again. Everything about the film is different from the conventions of Hollywood mass consumption ""fast-film"". The story unfolds in a slow and methodical manner and requires much attention on the part of the viewer. If you invest in it, Dead Man will repay you many times over.
If you liked Forrest Gump and The Sixth Sense then you can go see another mindless mainstream movie with Tim Keogh and the majority of the ignorant American public. If you need more than that . . . buy Dead Man. I'll bet you watch it more than once!",967852800,894,1899,4.469740634005763
830811,2,630426786X,"Jim Jarmusch is an excellent filmmaker, there is little debateabout that. Why then do so many Jarmusch fans consider this film, Dead Man, as his finest work? I sure wish I knew...after reading the glowing reviews here I went out and rented and BOY do I wish I hadn't.
Positives: The cast is great, they all command the screen.... Depp, as usual, shows why he is one of the best young ... actors working today.
Disappointments: First and foremost: the look of the film. This film is black and white for no apparent reason. ... Throughout the film we will see some really pretty scenery which is only dulled down by the ugly black and white grain. Black and white certainly has its place ...!
Secondly,(spoiler) the story itself is very poor ... Throw in an oafish Indian who does nothing but utter nonsense and curse at white men, the ""Nobody"" character who has the biggest part in the movie. The film also commits a major faux pas in that it opens with a VERY tedious railroad sequence. Good films always start with an interesting spark. No spark here.
To make matters worse the sound mixing on the VHS widescreen copy I had was absolutely terrible with the dialogue being recorded very low with the music ...  being VERY loud. I had to sit there with remote in hand turning the volume up for dialogue then DOWN for when the music came on.
The climax of the movie is a letdown as well. Nothing is resolved. The most interesting characters in the movie such as the Lance Henriksen and Gabriel Byrne characters go NOWHERE and are simply bystanders to this catastrophe on film.
If you are new to Jarmusch then I highly recommend you check out another of his easily-found films, Ghost Dog. ...",966988800,7,1689,4.555921052631579

I am not American, but if I were, I'd be as proud of this movie as an  Italian is proud of being Leonardo Da Vinci's or Michaelangelo's  compatriot. This is not an exagerration - I think this movie should be  considered a part American cultural heritage and should be shown to the  next generations as an example of finest piece of American art. There's no  need to argue with the guy who wrote the editorial review - may be we  should just suggest him to see the movie again.",966643200,3,685,4.424
830813,4,630426786X,"I did not see Jim Jarmusch's ""Dead Man"" when it first played in theaters, in large part because of the many negative reviews it received.  Roger Ebert (who I admire) all but dismissed the film with his lowly  *1/2-star rating.  Ebert was a champion of Jarmusch's ""Stranger Than  Paradise"", so I trusted him and avoided the movie.  But now, having  seen ""Dead Man"" on video, I feel many of these critics (who may  have been expecting a traditional Western) were unfair in their judgements.  This is a movie serious filmgoers should not miss.
Johnny Depp stars as  William Blake, an accountant from Cleveland who travels west with the  promise of a job.  This westward journey - the basis for so many other  movies - is not, however, seen as something positive (Blake, in fact, is  warned early on that the Western town of Machine will only offer him a  grave).  Things do not start off well.  He arrives to find out that the  accountant position has already been filled. He tells the office manager  (John Hurt) that he wants to speak with the owner.  The owner (played by  the late Robert Mitchum) is, unfortunately, no more sympathetic and forces  Blake to leave.
Without enough money to return, Blake befriends a young  woman who (like him) has had her romantic notions of the West crushed.  She makes paper flowers, because a real flower would never be found in the  ugliness of Machine.  She shares her bed with him and is shot by her lover  (Gabriel Byrne).  Blake is also shot, but kills Byrne and escapes on his  horse.  He is soon found by an Indian named Nobody (Gary Farmer) who tells  him that the bullet is close to his heart, so he is already a ""dead  man"".  The two take off together and Mitchum (Byrne was his son)  places a bounty on Blake's head.
""Dead Man"" is an  anti-Western, in the same tradition as Robert Altman's ""McCabe &  Mrs. Miller"".  But the film, which is shot in beautiful black and  white by Robby Muller, is unlike any Western I've ever seen. There's a  poetic quality to the film.  Blake is told that he shares the name of a  great British poet not by any of the white people in the film, but rather  by the Indian Nobody (who believes he IS the poet).
The movie is very  much pro-Native American and I admired the film for pointing out some  unpleasant facts: like the fact that a million buffalo were slaughtered as  a means of wiping out Indians (buffalo was one of their staples).  Blake  witnesses such a slaughter even before he's left the train.
And while I  suppose this message could be found in ""Dances With Wolves"", I  found ""Dead Man"" to be the better film.",963100800,135,2603,4.496774193548387

830884,5,630426786X,"Haunting. Ethereal. Intellectual. Scathing.
Drama. Comedy. Western. Adventure.
All these words may be used to describe Dead Man, but none of them used alone will begin to capture the beauty of this film. It is not  your standard Hollywood ""movie"", but then, Jarmusch is in no way  your typical director. Dead Man takes us along as observers as well as  companions on this trip through one man's spiritual journey, the end of  which ultimatley culminates in death. But the man is dead throughout the  film, not physically so, but in spirit, and he is on the last journey he  will ever take, and the most important--for this will lead him to the place  where the veil between worlds is thin, or nonexistent. He must beomce an  outlaw, hunted, through the same experience which first killed him, and he  must, as his guide Nobody said, ""learn to speak through your gun  instead of your words. "" Therefore, his gun becomes his tounge, and  his words, death.
Johnny Depp's performance is incredible, very probing,  getting straight to the heart of the character and taking us along. From  the horror when he shoots Charlie, to the shock when he realizes he is, in  truth, a ""dead man"", to the peace which he finds when his journey  is over--he captures all of these, and more. Many a shot is a panning of  his face, and words are sparse--his eyes speak as if they had tounges.  However, he looks much more Native American than Gary Farmer in his role as  Nobody ever could, providing a rather disconcerting note. In fact, Depp  does have Cherokee blood in him, and I do not think Farmer has any Native  blood.
Jarmusch, the director of many indie films, and a cult moviemaker,  has truly created a masterpiece here. I can say quite assuredly that it  should become one of the remembered films, in ten years, twenty, thirty.  The only thing which surprises me is that there are not more people writing  in as college students who have seen this in a class-- has it been used  anywhere?  And if so, where?
Anyhow....see this film. You will feel much  better for it. Metaphysical, deep, stirring....all the adjectives in the  world will not make up for seeing it, over and over.

I would not expose a person new to Jarmush to this piece, but if you liked or loved any of his other works, you will truly savor this one. Dead Man distills his unique flavor of  visual and audible quirks into a fine blend. You need to have some idea of  what to expect (i.e. Stranger Than Paradise, Down By Law, Mystery Train),  but once you do, and you want it, this film will satisfy you like no other  Jarmush film (including GhostDog).",956707200,4,481,4.311111111111111

The movie checks in at a cross point  somewhere between Lynch's ""Eraserhead"" and the Coen's ""The  Big Lebowski,"" but topples both with its beautiful cinematography and  butonous black humour.

830893,3,630426786X,"There's some things to like with ""Dead Man"", but this is not some great masterpiece, which seems to be the running assessment here at Amazon.  The cinematography is superb, no question.  The B&W was shot  with a heavy contrast that gives the world a look of raw power and fear.  I  thought that was wonderful, and could have been put to excellent use.  The  acting was fine, if a little camp at times.  But I think we saw enough  staring into vacant space for one evening to get across the message that  the world's a puzzle and that the main character is lost.  These things can  be overdone, which Jarmusch seems not to realize.  So, in the end, this  whole exercise, as lovely as it is as camera work, went for nought.  Jarmusch, apparently, has almost nothing to say, which is surprising, since  he obviously lavished so much attention on his look.  The film does not  make any coherent statement about life or death or anything else.  The  characters are vapid and pointless.  The story is a throw-away.  And the  reviewers who have come before me bear this point our well.  They can't  tell you what this film is about either, except in the usual generalities.  You tell someone the plot, and then you look in your hands, and all you  have is a little pile of sawdust.  Too, too bad.  Jarmusch is very  interesting, but he keeps getting lost searching for ways to express his  modern ANGST -- the world is SOOOO dark, people are SOOOO bad, etc.  Who  needs it in the end?  It tells us nothing we haven't heard a hundred times  before and from writers whose spit he isn't worthy to have on his face, and  the idea really isn't true, especially in fat-and-happy modern America.  And the comedy, well, it was mildly interesting, but in sum mostly  sophomoric.  The Indian?  Silly.  You might as well go read Blake if you  want to know something about what he might, just might, mean to this film.  See the great ""Black Robe"", instead, if you want to study Native  American culture.  Or read the Brian Moore novel on which ""Black  Robe"" was based.  So I've had my say.  To sum up, even though I've  done some bad-mouthing here, it's clear that ""Dead Man"" is lots  better than every Hollywood film that came out in the same year, even  though it is a disappointment.  (Do you wonder what I like, as a contrast  to what I've said here?  The greatest film ever made, in my humble opinion,  is Kurosawa's ""Ran"".  Now you can decide whether to listen to me  or not about this film.)  Watch ""Dead Man"" for the splendid  photography (even Neil Young's score, as great as he is, gets a little  ridiculous at times -- it was haunting for an hour, and then just a plain  pain in the ear), but you better be ready to forget the story and the  vision, for they ain't much.  It's like a painting of a still life.  It's  awful pretty, but it ain't gonna tell you much about the meaning of  existence.  Hey, write to me is you wish to discuss this matter, though  what I'd really like to talk about is ""Ran"".",949622400,10,2995,4.392265193370166
