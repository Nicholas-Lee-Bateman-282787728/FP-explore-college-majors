209158,3,6300159140,strayed to far from the original radio play and book.,1484352000,,53,4.4
209159,1,6300159140,"! have purchased this item 3 times from 3 different dealers. All 3 discs have the sound missing from the last section of the movie. There is no problem with my player as it plays all other discs perfectly.  Some dealers claim all their dvds are checked. This is obviously not true.
I intended returning all 3 discs to the respective sellers but the postage cost of sending them from Australia to America is greater than the cost of the discs (which are not expensive).
I would recommend that anyone wanting the dvd 'The Day of the Triffids' (the Howard Keel version) refrain from purchasing until the fault (which is apparently common to all copies) has been rectified.

209161,4,6300159140,"The Day of the Triffids, the digitally remastered original released by Cheezy Flicks is far superior to other efforts.  It suffers from a color loss as others have written but that's not the fault of this release.  Triffids suffers from color fade due to being filmed using Eastman Color film stock.  This film stock replaced the more expensive and stable Technicolor system when studios were trying to save money.  The Eastman system was also able to be processed in most film labs further reducing costs.  Many great films have been damaged and restoration is difficult and expensive.  Triffids just doesn't have the potential to sell enough prints to make full restoration fiscally possible.  I prefer this original version of The Day of the Triffids to more recent remakes and, while disappointed with the color loss, it's still enjoyable and far superior to other releases mentioned.

I used to watch this movie on one of Chicago's local TV channels way back in the 70's (Sunday Matinee Classics) and I remember even the TV presentation had an excellent picture quality and color. BUT SADLY NOT THIS DVD TRANSFER. This product looks more as if bootlegged from who knows what master.

209203,4,6300159140,"A really great movie.  The Monsters in the movie are original and the plot is great.  This is one of the first movies where monsters arrived to Earth on meteorites.  It was also an interesting twist to see the impact of the meteors on the people who watched the meteor shower.  That was original, even by today standards.  The special effects were great for a movie of this time period.  The actors were strong and they played their roles well.  Even though the plot followed two unrelated groups of people, the superior cast and script made it easy to follow and to understand.  It is a great example of early 60s science fiction movies.  One reason it is so great to watch is that the movie unintentionally gives the viewer a great glimpse into life during the time period.  It does a great job of showing the urban and rural areas of London, France, and Spain which gives the view a great feeling for the way Europe used to be.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was that the plot did not adequately deal with the plight of the millions of people who were left hurt by the meteors.

Rather this is a review of the truly horrendous transfer of this movie provided by Cheezy Flicks Ent.

This is absolutely the worst transfer I have ever seen -- ever.

I tried playing the Cheezy Flicks Ent.  'The Day of the Triffids' DVD on two players: an Oppo DVD player and a Panasonic Blu-ray player.
Words cannot adequately describe how truly awful this transfer is.

The packaging describes this movie as being 'Digitally Remastered'.  By 'Digitally Remastered' Cheesy Flicks must mean 'copied from an
old worn out VHS tape.  I cannot believe this transfer has in any sense whatever been 'Remastered'.

The packaging also claims '16 x 9' aspect ratio.  The only thing '16 x 9' on this DVD is the menu system -- the movie itself has large black bars top and bottom when when played on 16 x 9 plasma TV.  Everything about this DVD is bad.

I could go on forever, but I'm just 'beating a dead horse'.  I only wish I could give this 'dud' of a DVD zero stars!

209334,1,6300159140,"There are three movie adaptations to John Wyndham's wonderful sci-fi novel The Day of the Triffids. And believe it or not, there are multiple abridged versions, both in print and audio, of the original novel. The abridgements are a mystery to me, because the original novel is only a bit over 200 pages. Why bother abridging such a short novel? The common denominator in all this is the original novel, so before I say anything about the movies let me encourage you to read or listen to the original unabridged novel, because it is a true sci-fi classic.

Of the three movies, this 1962 adaptation is the one not worth watching. First, it's not faithful to the novel, other than featuring triffids and blindness, and second, more importantly, it's simply an awful, laughably ridiculous movie. The acting, dialogue, and plotting are all terrible, as well as the bombastic background music. Our ""hero,"" Bill Masen, has a bad habit of putting little girls and women in danger. The only redeeming qualities of this movie are the triffids (the Beasts) and Janette Scott (the Beauty). The triffids were sufficiently convincing as carnivorous, mobile plants, and the noises they made were suitably spine-tingling. Janette Scott, as the wife of a scientist, was sufficiently scrumptious to gaze upon. And actually, that was her role. You see, it turns out that the folks who made this awful movie knew how bad it was, and they inserted a subplot about a scientist and his beautiful wife trapped in a lighthouse in order to make it more watchable. The scenes with Janette Scott were my favorite, so I guess it worked.

To give you a taste of how bad this movie is, I'll give you the final narration (which isn't in the novel): ""A simple method has been found to destroy the triffids. Mankind survived and once again had reason to give thanks [to the Christian God].""

I would say it comes down to this:

1) Don't bother with the 1962 adaptation, it's a waste of time, a truly bad movie. Some say it is a ""classic."" I have no idea what they see in it.
2) The 1981 movie is a decent B-grade adaptation and is the most faithful to the novel. If you're a fan of the novel and don't mind wooden acting and subpar dialogue, give it a try.
3) The 2009 miniseries strays a bit from the novel, but of the three this is the one that actually seems like a professional movie.",1435795200,,2355,4.6

The valedictory ending also mimics War of the Worlds.  The movie is also British produced, and so the standards are expectedly lower than Hollywood.  Massive meteor shower blinds most of Earth, and spawns moving, man-eating plants.  Focus is split between two groups of main characters:  an American sailor with a young girl, wandering around France, and a young English scientific couple trapped in a lighthouse.  The clumsy Triffids multiply in the thousands it seems, and are able to immobilize victims with poison gas it seems, and that adds to the credibility.  But overall, the movie is not as thrilling as ""War of the Worlds"" or ""Them"", and of course the Triffids can't compete with Martians and giant ants. By this stage of the game, writers had to imagine different ideas, and certainly the premise here of plants becoming monsters is a clever one.",1422835200,,1121,5.126373626373627

Instead of having zombies or vampires or aliens take over the world, we have strange plants taking over the world.  They are somewhat sentient and they have a craving for human flesh!  What's also a cool part of this movie is that like 99% of the human population is rendered blind by a meteor shower.

The quality feels like an old Kinescope, or like those early VHS videos where someone videotapes the screen of a home TV while a movie is being broadcast. I would wait to purchase until new reviews or a new edition confirm that this problem with the video transfer has been corrected.

But the movie itself is quite good, and quite 1950s-British. The depiction of an entire planet blinded by a seemingly benign comet is interesting and never done before. The idea of fast-growing, endlessly reproducing omnivorous predatory plants is intriguing.
The two together simultaneously makes for a nice scenario.

In the original book, the Triffids were a bio-warfare attack, engineered in a Soviet laboratory to release against the West. The film version alters this to the effects of a passing comet.

The film is rather slow paced, typical of British directing of the era but in marked contrast to fast-paced American SF of the era. I believe 'Triffids' is the first use of the post-apocalyptic plot device in which a patient awakens in a hospital's ICU and finds the world outside has suffered a catastrophe (28 DAYS, THE WALKING DEAD opening, etc).

Flashback: When 'Triffids' came out in the original drive-in theater release in the 1960s, theater staff gave out free packets of 'Triffid seeds' (actually seeds for 6' sunflowers). All the kids in my neighborhood saw the movie, planted the seedsin their backyards and, when the seeds started shooting up at speed just as sunflowers do, all the kids got nervous and their Dads took care of the 'Triffid menace' for once and all.

If you see this on Streaming, make some popcorn and enjoy. I wouldn't buy it until there's a new edition with better video quality available.

I hope this is helpful as you check out great old lesser known horror films. Have fun!",1410048000,4,1900,4.885093167701863

I'm pretty tolerant of these types of things, but Amazon should probably pull this.

There are two issues:
- The transfer appears to have been made from a letterboxed VHS tape. So it's an SD, 4:3 frame with the movie letterboxed inside of that. It's much lower quality than SD.
- The sound drops out of the left channel at  1:22:00
- The color is significantly faded. Although this may be a result of the original source material,

The few people world-wide that did not see the meteor storm are left to fight the ""Triffids"", plant-like creatures that can uproot themselves and put a fatal sting on victims. Don't know if it eats 'em or not, but they still gather and attack humans (and one poor dog).

Watch and ye shall see: the first stars Howard Keel (as the biggest star he went first in billing and story order and bigger budget) and Nicole Maury. The second is an intimate relationship film about a couple threatened by alcoholism, loser syndrome and carnivorous alien plant life, starring Kieron Moore and Janette Scott. There were probably two production companies working separately at the same time - no attempt was made to edit the stories into a literary or even genuinely cohesive whole. The two casts meet only for thirty or forty seconds in the tacked on ending when seagulls fly, ships blow horns and mankind rejoices in abundant saltwater. Still, both scripts and casts were good, the story was sufficiently new and spooky in those days, and the special effects were believable - why wouldn't an alien walking plant look a little hokey? However, there are moments of real fright - Keel in the wrecked city with the blind survivors trying to catch and use him for his eyes; a night watchman not quite sure if he hears noises in the back of the greenhouse; a house surrounded by triffids looking for a way past an electrified fence.

The film was shot in Cinemascope so it literally filled that big screen making it an overwhelming experience...and then the movie proper begins with most of the world gone blind and the triffids themselves moving about, making their unique clucking/cooing sound that chilled me to the bone. It was a movie experience that was revisited on TV many times throughout the 1960s and then pushed back into the recesses of my mind while other things took precedence but it never quite went away. When it first appeared on VHS I eagerly bought one but was stunned by the poor video quality which made my old pre-cable rabbit ears TV picture look good. This was because the movie was in the public domain. This means that anyone trying to make a buck could copy a poor quality print, usuallly in the wrong aspect ratio, and put it out for people like me, who remembered the film fondly, to purchase. When DVD came along the situation was still not good. Better technology but the same crappy transfers with DVD clarity making them look even worse. At last check Warner Brothers owns the Allied Artists back catalogue so maybe they'll issue a quality version courtesy of their Archive series like they did for FROM HELL IT CAME and BLACK ZOO.

If you've read many of the other reviews for this film you know the story and have probably noticed that 1) most people who saw it as children have a soft spot for it because of that and 2) like me thay have been appalled by how bad the video transfers of it have been. I had given up on ever finding a decent copy of TRIFFIDS until I read some of these amazon reviews and discovered the Cheezy Flicks edition. While there were some complaints, I could tell that this version was a cut above and I decided to take a chance so I ordered it, watched it, and was inspired to write my own review. Sure it wasn't my childhood Cinemascope experience but on my flatscreen TV it looked better than I could have imagined. The print isn't perfect. There are some signs of wear and you can see where the reel changes occur. Most notably the colors are a little washed out but overall this is probably going to be the best we're likely to get unless Warner Brothers decides to give us a pristine restoration. So TRIFFID fans rejoice! Increase the color level on your home entertainment device, up the volume, and sit back and enjoy this sci-fi classic. No, it's not the 1981 BBC version and it certainly isn't the book but it's still a really good B movie from that era of sober and intelligent (if somewhat naive) sci-fi when story and character meant more than special effects.

Although I didn't buy the previous release version to actually side by side compare, I did buy this particular version and all in all I'm not disappointed. Sound is fine and transfer and remastering seem decent enough for the vintage of the film. NOT perfect as some aspects seem a trifal 'red shifted'. I have quite a few different qualities of vintage monster movies in my collection...from public domain video transfers from online to Universal commercially released remasters. Taking into consideration every conceivable quality I have in my collection on a scale of 1 (being grainy, flickery, watery, and barely audible) to a 10 (being a perfect commercially released Universal Monsters commercially released official DVD) I would give the quality of this Trifids a solid 7 1/2. It would fit into MOST people's collection. Better than the quality of most ""100"" or ""50"" pack monster movie transfers. If you're a die hard monster movie collector of the 1940s you probably have had to 'endure' some truly awful video transfers and lame remasters just to have the movie in your collection (curucu beast of the amazon comes to mind as one that's virtually impossible to get in decent video quality)...this Trifids is, well, NOT BAD.

Next morning, all who saw the meteors are now blind and being attacked by hideous man-eating plants.  Bill makes his way to France where he meets a handful of others who still are sighted, but the hideous Triffids are everywhere.

This low-budget movie with primitive special effects is considered a cult classic by many these days, but the mechanical plants aren't scary and the acting is generally wooden.  The premise that most of the world's inhabitants are blinded is, however, very scary; we see what happens when all aboard a jet and a passenger train lose their sight.  People wander through the deserted streets of London with no hope.

Howard Keel is the best of the cast, although he never seems particularly worried about the strange events and handles each emergency with ease.  An odd side note is that the movie turned out to be way too short, so a completely unrelated story about some scientists trapped in an island lighthouse was added to lengthen it.  This plot line is interesting but jarringly disconnected to Bill's story.

Not one of Freddie Francis's better directorial efforts, ""Day of the Triffids,"" an adaptation of a John Wyndham novel, is a leisurely paced sci-fi thriller that is based on an interesting idea--that a meteor shower afflicts the world's populace with blindness, paving the way for an invasion of plantlike ""triffids.""

However, unlike the film's idea, the man-eating triffids themselves are silly.  They look more stupid than scary.  Like the movie, they move so sluggishly that it is difficult to believe they could instill fear even in a three-year-old tot.

The scene with the blind passengers panicking on the commercial jet in flight is engrossing, but the rest of the chills are few and far between.  This movie doesn't hold a candle to other British sci-fi movies produced at this time, such as, ""Five Million Years to Earth,"" aka ""Quatermass and the Pit.""  The grainy print on the ""Day of the Triffids"" DVD doesn't help the film's cause, either.

Another film based on a Wyndham novel, ""Villlage of the Damned,"" starring George Sanders, offers better suspense and more frequent thrills than does ""Day of the Triffids.""  Still, ""Triffids"" is an entertaining, if not compelling, movie, and I would recommend viewing it.

Although it is strange to see Howard Keel in this role, he does a valiant job. Don't expect to be awe-struck by strong plots and story lines.

209922,3,6300159140,"As I read the Amazon reviews on ""The Day of the Triffids,"" I was surprised to find that the film have received considerably low ratings. At the time of writing, it is below 3 stars, which is not very impressive. However, I soon found that most reviewers who gave negative reviews complain about the quality of DVD, not the film itself, so I decided to buy a VHS anyway and found that as old-fashioned sci-fi thriller, ""The Day of the Triffids"" is fine and fairly enjoyable, though not outstandingly so.

Original writer John Wyndham's unique concept itself is still interesting. What if almost all the people on earth suddenly become blind? The situation is intriguing and horrifying and it becomes even more so as the Triffids, flesh-eating walking plants, are now the fittest spices for survival on earth.

The 1963 film adaptation, however, unfolds its story too fast, missing every chance to make it a more exciting thriller or thought-provoking drama. Post-apocalyptic scenes like the deserted streets of London (later seen in such films as ""28 Days Later"") could have given us more impact with longer time and more events, but the film keeps moving on, following the story of the protagonist Bill Masen (Howard Keel). Three sighted characters Bill and Susan, a little girl who ran away from school, and Christine struggle to survive, but the Triffids are not scary at all, and compared with the novel's counterparts, what they have to go through is much less shocking. Sometimes it looks as if the characters are wandering aimlessly, going from England to France, then to Spain.

To lengthen the running time of the original version that was too short for release, they concocted a subplot about a married couple stranded in a remote lighthouse, fighting back the horde of triffids. The subplot just doesn't work and its conclusion is a huge disappointment.

In addition to the lighthouse scenes, several sequences are added for the adaptation. Some of the scenes are effective, still disturbing even now, such as the one set on a flying airplane of which crew and passengers are all blind. Here is an idea that could have been developed into something really gripping, but the sequences abruptly ends, as if the director abandoned the idea because of the lack of budget.

This is a kind of shocker you fondly remember watching on TV as a child and being truly scared of; a film that you now find dated and a bit cheesy, but you still cannot help loving it. This is a film that is waiting to be remade with today's visual technology.",1222387200,,2539,4.814220183486238

Of course, if your standard is not to re-live a wonderful time as a child in a cinema of screaming and laughing children, this film will probably do very little for you.  Viewed more cooly from my vantage as a middle-aged film buff, it is pretty weak as sci-fi.  Little is explained - the meteors somehow cause both blindness and a bizarre transformation in the triffids - and after the chaos of a society falling apart, the plot takes weird twists.  One group that the narrative follows forms a kind of family and inexplicably heads to southern europe, where after much danger they escape.  The other actors are a troubled couple of scientists, who miraculously discover that salt water dissolves the triffids after much failed study, again inexplicably.  And the effects!  Very bad compared to what is available today.

(horrible plant monsters that eat people) before Humanity is destroyed* if you have not seen this film you might want to check it out.

*if you can overlook the age of the film, bad transition, and cheesy storyline, then this might amuse the whole family. there is no gore and violence consists of some shrill screams and a few gunshots plus the gurgle noise of the plants *triffids* other then that this is a mostly forgettable movie unless you are like me and just love the classics that started it all. still a low end B movie though.

Not only is the person blind, but the whole world is blind except for the people who did not watch the meteorite shower.

John Duttine and Maurice Colbourne are great as Bill and Coker. Emma Relph is great as Jo as well.

Of course there are those tired folks who keep crying about the film's injustice to John Wyndham's book. We are not exactly talking about ""Heart of Darkness"" here, just appreciate the film for what it is.  What would have been the point of a meticulous adaptation when everything else about the film is relaxed and low-budget fun.

Speaking of fun there is Howard Keel, a Gordon MacRae type movie musical star (Showboat, Annie Get Your Gun, Kismet, and Seven Brides), playing the dashing hero after seven years of unemployment once Hollywood stopped making his kind of movies. Good Grief, Keel was fantastic as Petruchio in ""Kiss Me Kate""; what a contrast with his Triffids role. He and Joan Crawford (Trog) probably swapped career horror (pun intended) stories.

Watch for the scene in the hospital after Keel takes the bandages off his eyes and begins wandering around. They were so low budget that they used the stair railing set twice, just changing camera angle and distance to disguise the duplication.

A highly recommended all-time classic that is as much fun now as it was on television in the mid-1960's.

Yet, there have been plenty of other science fiction movies that also boasted fake monsters and still are considered pretty good--WORLD WITHOUT END with its rubber spiders comes to mind. What makes DOTT memorable is the ability of directors Steve Sekely and Freddie Francis to take a twin set of world wide catastrophes and slim them down so that the audience can see them through the eyes of the hero, played by Howard Keel.  Keel has just had a delicate eye surgery which causes him to miss the once in a lifetime opportunity of viewing the spectacular celestial fireworks caused by a meteor shower hitting the earth's atmosphere.  He awakens in a deserted hospital and has to cut off his own bandages only to find that nearly 99% of the earth's population has had their retinas scorched to blindness.  The film wisely does not attempt to portray a society in which the few sighted individuals rule their blinded neighbors although there are several scenes that hint at both the sexual fantasy of male to female predation and the probably much more common breakdown of a society that depends on its sight to maintain order and law.
Keel plays a seaman who has to survive in a London which is full of hardy survivors who insist on going through the motions of basic humanity despite their blindness.  Keel witnesses a city that slowly crumbles into anarchy despite the 'stiff upper lip' attitude of its inhabitants.  To make matters worse, the lights from the meteors have caused a mutated walking carnivorous plant to germinate ubiquitously.  Keel strikes up a father-daughter relation with 12 year old Janette Scott and a more conventional romantic one with Nicole Maury.  As this trio moves from one country to another, they see a world that is under the onslaught of these Triffids.  In a parallel subplot, two scientists, one male and one female, are trapped in a lighthouse by the triffids and must find a way to defeat them.  DOTT unfortunately panders to gross sensationalism as it shows an orgy scene in which an escaped bunch of sighted convicts descends on a group of blinded women in a house for a dance and drink prelude to mass rape, an event which is avoided by the entrance of the Triffids.  As I watched this scene and others involving Triffids I was reminded of similar such scenes from George Romero's later NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD in which zombies poured through smashed doors and windows to devour the living.  I was not deterred from enjoying this movie either by the fake plants or the fake convicts.  What held my attention was the view of a world under fire as seen through a trio of witnesses, all of whom emerge as individuals I would be proud of and thankful for their company should the lights go out all over the world.",1047686400,3,2881,4.692460317460317

210077,4,6300159140,"But, ""Triffids"" isn't a bad way to spend an evening. Monster plants. Cool effects (for the period). Brave hero. A damsel in distress PLUS a perky and disciplined child. Implausible plot elements.

210078,2,6300159140,"Wyndam's original book is still a very effective and frightening book which has lost none of it's freshness even though it is nearly 50 years old. This film is a fairly good story, although badly executed and with poor effects even for the early sixties, but it is very unfaithful to the book which actually focuses on the survival of a small number of survivors of a global calamity and the moral choices they face in how to deal with the millions of still alive, but doomed, blinded people. This film with its simplified story and happy ending does none of these things but is an average early 60s British SF film. However, if it interests you read the book and if you get a chance watch the 1981 BBC adaptation (not regrettably on video) for a much more faithful adaptation.",1014336000,4,777,4.5177304964539005
210079,3,6300159140,"One other review and they use the asparagus line!!!  Well, maybe my perceptions aren't really all that unique, after all.  ""Day of the Triffids"" was my Halloween rental this year.  It's good campy fun, and although it's been many a year since I've read the (quite good as I recall) book, I didn't get the impression that it did its source work as great an injustice as some other reviewers seem to feel.
Today's audience would laugh out loud at the cheesy special effects on display in this 1962 magnum opus, and musical buffs will likely be dismayed to see the depths to which latter day musical star Howard Keel (the only name in the cast I recognized at all) had sunk.  And how the heck did the couple in the lighthouse ever get off that damn island anyway?  Let alone share their discovery about how to kill this evil weed.  Don't expect answers.  This movie is clunky, awkwardly acted and poorly edited--but it's good fun in the way only late 50s-early 60s horror or sci-fi flicks could be.  See it with someone you love to laugh with.",1004918400,,1040,4.49468085106383
210080,1,6300159140,"'Day of the Triffids' has great potential - the idea of the entire world, except for the sick, waking up blind; the population of the planet panicking; a temporarily blind man waking up one morning and finding the great capital city London in shreds, the blind shuffling around like zombies, grabbing young girls; the invasion of a refuge for the blind by violent, sexually deprived French convicts, the women forced to service them; or an airplane flown by pilots who can't see - all of this, with its intimations of the surreal, could have made a splendid episode of 'The Avengers'.
Sadly, this production of 'Triffids' is a failure, for two fundamental reasons.  Firstly, its ambitions are too big for its budget.  The special effects are poor; the models of burning cities, with their famous landmarks, look tacky and unbelievable, lacking the frisson 'Independence Day', say, is supposed to have brought; the squelchy monsters are clumsy, silly and only frightening because we have others' words, or rather screams, for it.
The second, related problem, is the direction.  You didn't need a big budget to make 'Triffids' scary - by limiting its focus, by suggesting (by atmosphere, lighting, editing etc.) rather than showing, like Val Newton did in exceptional horror movies like 'Cat People', you could have made a genuinely creepy picture.
One of the major features of suspense is a skilled deployment of silence and the fearful anticipation it creates.  Here blasts of music fill up every second of the film, as if the producers were afraid the audience would nod off; there is no attempt to introduce us slowly and fearfully to the monsters, which makes them unscary.
The action, which should increase the pulse of a horror or suspnse film, is cackhanded - there are too many static scenes of people standing against what are obviously blank backgrounds which the special effects team will later fill in (the same problem blighted 'The Phantom Menace'.  The film cuts clunkily between two separate plots, which have no narrative connection, and only the slightest thematic reflection.",999648000,3,2093,5.055072463768116
210081,4,6300159140,"This is really a fun movie!
Howard Keel (who starred in the last few seasons of ""Dallas"", among many other things), is wonderful as one of the few sighted people left on the planet.
A bizzare meteor shower  blinds anyone who saw it, and causes chaos throughout the world as masses  of blinded people struggle to survive. The radiation from the shower also  activates the spores of the deadly Triffid plants.
Saved from blindness  because of a simple eye operation (requiring bandages so he cannot witness  the meteor shower), Keel must come to grips with the not only the horrors  of a world gone mad, but the horrible carnivorous plants as well!
They  come to life and attack the people. They can move and are attracted to any  sound.
The story also follows a sub-plot of a disillusioned couple living  in a lighthouse, stranded, and surrounded by deadly Triffids!
For you  sci-fi trivia buffs, look for a young Carol Ann Ford, who a year later  would be the first of Doctor Who's many companions as the Doctor's (William  Hartnell), niece Susan Foreman.",931046400,10,1055,4.736263736263736

7803170,3,6300159140,"One day a comet came by and a meteorite left off a triffid. So we are familiar with the little cuties. They never bothered anyone.

Little did we know that the next comet would bring a hungry version of triffid. Looks like the new one likes snacking on cute girls and little doges.

What do we care if a few slow moving plants are roaming around? No wait, the meteor shower has blinded most of the population. Now we have a problem as a plant that munches on people and propagates like rabbits can now feed without having to exercise.

This is more than just an eating story. There is also a lonely sailor that escaped being blinded while he was in the hospital. How he builds a family from acquaintances on his mission to regroup. Mean while back at the lighthouse on an island a burned out lush scientist has found a mission to bump off the triffids before he becomes triffid chow.

This is one of those movies that would have been more dramatic in Black and white.

The only draw back on this movie is the female in the lighthouse screams and screams and screams. Them she hears something and does not want to wake up her hubby so she walks right up to the poor triffid and screams at it. It looks like the poor thing lost its footing.

Again this is a pale reflection of an excellent book. Also to be politically correct the triffids that were genetically produced in Russia in the book now mysteriously come from a comet to let the Russians off the hook. However the movie captured the essence. And it is necessary to watch for cultural literacy. And it is just downright fun.",1505260800,,1581,4.378839590443686
