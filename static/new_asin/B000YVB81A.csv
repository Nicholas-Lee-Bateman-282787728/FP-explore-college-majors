3035991,1,B000YVB81A,"Deadhouse (Pablo Maysonet IV, 2005)

Deadhouse, according to IMDB, was Maysonet's debut; ""[h]e had never previously shot a film, short or feature, in his life. He attributes DeadHouse's lack of overall quality...to his inexperience at the time."" Which is as good a reason as any, I guess, though I do have to say that I've seen a lot of debut films that were a great deal more accomplished than this one, and so I'm not willing to give Maysonet too much leeway on this. Also, I wish I'd read this IMDB review snippet before seeing the movie: ""If you like Slipknot or [Insane Clown Posse], you'll love this movie."" Which, for all I know, is entirely true. I can't stand either of them, and had I read that, I might have steered clear of this. But I didn't, and so here I am to tell you about it.

The plot is about as old as the hills: four teens find themselves faced with a family of twisted, sadistic serial killers who like listening to really, really awful music. (Couldn't they at least develop a taste for Mushroomhead?) In other words, if you've seen the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you've basically seen this one, though the masks and methods are a bit different, and Maysonet throws in a different twist on the old slaughterhouse routine by making one of the characters a butcher. You might find it worth wasting ninety minutes on if you've seen The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as many times as you can take and you want a slightly different take on the same movie, but otherwise, you can avoid it. About the only good thing I can say about it is that it's not the worst movie I've seen so far this year. In fact, it's not even in the top ten. It does have a sort of brainless watchability to it, and if you do decide to take the plunge, you'll at least be mildly entertained. I wish I could say that about some of the other cinematic classics I've subjected myself to this year (Forest of the Damned, anyone?) *",1238371200,5,1923,4.429378531073446
