8232212,5,B000YDQJRG,"I was searching Amazon to see if Strategic Air Command with James Stewart is heading for a DVD release yet and found this little gem. It contains about 23 minutes of unedited, silent film as it was shot for ""SAC Alert"", an episode of an Air Force internal newsreel series called Air Force News Review.

From reading the slates at the start of each scene, this was filmed in a few days in December 1957 at SAC Headquarters at Offutt AFB and at Pinecastle AFB (today's Orlando International Airport).

The disc does not have a menu. It just starts on its own. When it reaches the end, it starts over again. The picture quality is excellent and there are some nice shots of B-47s, the Pinecastle and Offutt AFB gates, and the underground SAC command post featuring one of its big RCA TK-41 color television cameras.

Air Force News Review was produced by the 1365th Photographic Group, which was based at Orlando AFB, next to Orlando Executive Airport and just across town from Pinecastle AFB.

A few months after the filming Pinecaste AFB was renamed McCoy AFB in honor of Col. Michael Norman Wright McCoy. McCoy was killed when his B-47 exploded over central Florida on October 9, 1957.

This disc is for buffs only--most of whom will find it a real treat. (Although it would be pretty straightforward matter for a film student to edit this together and add a narration as a learning exercise.)
