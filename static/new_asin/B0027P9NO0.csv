All the prostitutes are zombies. There is an inept preacher who wants to burn down their brothel at some point in the film. I was given the DVD of this film by a friend who purchased it at a horror convention nearly a decade ago. I would not have been happy had I paid money for the movie.

I wouldn't recommend this film. If you're a lover of exploitation and SUPER low-budget horror comedies, then you might get some enjoyment out of it. It's not the worst thing I've seen, but it's hard to recommend this to zombie film fans when there are films like Night of the Living Dead and Shaun of the Dead out there. The plot if mildly amusing.",1488240000,,806,4.26797385620915

8355044,5,B0027P9NO0,"At the time I wrote this review, there was only one other. It was a 2-starred hatefest, a veritable opera of ignorance. That reviewer took the movie at face value, watching for zombie gore and hot lesbian sex, and I have to agree with him that if that is your objective, you will walk away disappointed. What the previous reviewer failed to realize, however, was the objective and nature of this film. This is a satire, carefully masked beneath two of the most popular trends in society, zombies and gay rights.

  The director uses the uncomfortable juxtaposition of a stereotypical, low-budget horror film and the tense plot of a romantic drama with homosexual overtones to highlight the hypocrisy of our media. Even the tagline, ""Dead sex is better than no sex."" is a jab at a society that favors sex over relationships. Even the low budget and inexperienced actors were used to draw attention to society's fixation with entertainment and appearances.

  I don't want to spoil the plot for anyone who would buy this movie to actually draw meaning from it, but rest assured it has a purpose. I bought this movie wary of its low budget and bad acting, but came away ponderous. Those things which were formerly obstacles the director has turned into tools, and for that I congratulate him. This earnest satire has changed the way I look at movies. Kubrick, get in line, Fugate is coming to town.",1358467200,8,1395,4.743801652892562
8355045,2,B0027P9NO0,If you like movies with no plot and fat ugly lesbian love scenes then this is your movie. I have a large zombie movie collection and this is one of the worst and that is saying something! The only reason I gave it two stars was the title makes me laugh. Save your money and buy toilet paper cause either way you put your money towards crap.,1347753600,5,340,4.08955223880597
