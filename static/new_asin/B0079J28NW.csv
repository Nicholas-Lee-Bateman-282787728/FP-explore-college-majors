bright colors and clear. The important part was the music that is done wonderfully in DTS MA 5.1. Especially Lucy in the sky with diamonds and the stunning visuals just blew me away.

5064549,5,B0079J28NW,"Edit to add:  I guess I should have included the following information when I originally wrote my review: I received a promo HD video excerpt of the project via email.  I did not appreciate the insults I received.

I'm really excited about this as Yellow Submarine is a classic piece of animation.  Add to that the music of the greatest rock musicians of all-time, frame by frame restoration, etc and...well it just doesn't get any better than that!

Here's my wish list in order for future Beatle's Blu-ray releases...

A Hard Day's Night (I own the Canadian version and it leaves a lot to be desired).
The Beatle's Anthology.

5064550,5,B0079J28NW,"This new 2012 DVD release of Yellow Submarine is advertised as having been lovingly restored frame by frame to ensure the best picture quality since it was first shown in theaters so many years ago. As for the movie itself, if you're a Beatles or animation fan (or hopefully both) and have never seen this film then you owe it to yourself to do so. The Peter Max-esque artwork is spectacular fantasy fun, the script is highly amusing, and the Beatles music chosen for the film sounds as good today as when it was new. Though the Beatles had little to do directly with the film and their voices are impersonated till the live footage of them singing recorded for the end of the film their sensibilities are all over this project and they did compose three new (at the time) songs for the film, all of them terrific. I can't recommend this movie enough and it's very ""family friendly"" if you are looking for something fantastic to enthrall your children and introduce them to the music of the Beatles. I saw it in the theater when I was a small child and jumped on buying it on VHS when it was first released. That VHS copy of Yellow Submarine was the most watched movie in our house when our son was very young and I never got tired of it no matter how many times he wanted to watch it. A good thing since he watched it countless times. Now I'm looking forward to this newly restored version on DVD.

According to announcements on The Beatles' official website the film has been restored in 4K digital resolution by Paul Rutan Jr. and his team of specialists at Triage Motion Picture Services and Eque Inc. Since the hand-drawn original artwork is quite delicate they have used no automated software in the digital clean-up of the film's restored photochemical elements. All the work was all done by hand, frame by frame.

Bonus features for the Yellow Submarine DVD and Blu-ray include a short making-of documentary titled ""Mod Odyssey"" (TRT: 7:30), the original Yellow Submarine theatrical trailer, audio commentary with producer John Coates and art director Heinz Edelmann, some brief interview clips with other people associated with the film, storyboard sequences, 29 original pencil drawings plus 30 behind-the-scenes photos. Both Digipak sets will include reproductions of animation cels from the film, collectible stickers, and a 16-page booklet with a new essay by Yellow Submarine aficionado John Lasseter (Chief Creative Officer, Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios).",1333411200,95,2481,4.849056603773585
5064551,5,B0079J28NW,"It was just a matter of time after seeing the ""Yellow Submarine"" book as a free download on I-Tunes that Apple would be re-releasing the movie. A remastered ""Anthology"" on blu-ray would be nice for the next issue.",1332115200,9,213,4.631578947368421
5064552,5,B0079J28NW,"""Yellow Submarine"" is one of those movies that, for me, is pure nostalgia. It was my first introduction to the Beatles, and one of the first non-Disney animated movies I saw.

Even though it makes absolutely no sense, ""Yellow Submarine"" is still a delightfully weird, acid-tripping story that bounces all over a colorful galaxy of hallucinatory nonsense. And yes, it stars the Beatles as heroes riding around in a Yellow Submarine, seeking to defeat the Blue Meanies. No joke.

Under the sea, there is an idyllic land known as Pepperland, where music rules. But then the music-hating Blue Meanies invade, petrifying the people with green apples and sealing away St. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Fortunately Old Fred the sailor manages to escape in a yellow submarine, to find help.

He finds it in Liverpool, where he enlists the depressed Ringo, and subsequently Ringo's four buddies John, Paul and George. So the yellow submarine sets out to Pepperland, but encounters many strange dangers along the way -- the Sea of Time, the Sea of Science, a monstrous vacuum, giant stomping boots, the Foothills of the Headlands (which is full of giant heads), the ""nowhere man"" in his ""nowhereland,"" and the mind-bending Sea of Holes.

But when they get to Pepperland, they find a ruined shell ruled over by the Nazi-like Blue Meanies. Can the Beatles elude petrification/capture, and somehow manage to bring music back to Pepperland?

""Yellow Submarine"" has almost no story, and the dialogue often makes little sense. This is a movie that is all about the visuals -- colorful, wild, acid-tripping visuals that seem to be trying to dazzle your eyes. It's a world filled with sea-anemone trees, flowers, patterns, giant grimacing teeth, a flying glove, time travel, stomping boots and strange puffballs with faces.

Seriously, it's like someone fed LSD to Dr. Seuss and Terry Gilliam at once, then told them to make a movie about whatever they saw. It's awesome.

Most of the story involves the Beatles careening wildly from one bizarre, surrealist world to another. The animators didn't make any effort to make anything seem normal, even in the real world -- for instance, John Lennon is introduced as Frankenstein's monster, who drinks a potion that poofs him into his human form. ""Hey Ringo. I've just had the strangest dream,"" he says casually.

And they do a pretty good job of integrating the various Beatles songs into the story. For example, the time-bending ""Sea of Time"" leads to a rendition of ""When I'm Sixty Four"" -- although some, like ""Lucy i the Sky With Diamonds,"" just sort of pop out of nowhere.

Don't watch it for the story -- ""Yellow Submarine"" is all about the Beatles songs and the dazzlingly colorful visuals. A must-see for animation fans and/or fans of surrealism.",1332028800,19,2786,4.96137339055794

They were so greedy and lazy to sign away their responsibility to even do their own voice acting. People make excuses for this nonsense and insulting greed but the group just took the money and didn't even attempt to lend their own voices to the project. Sure the visuals are fairly interesting but it's a style which is also lazy in that it's only semi-animated graphics not actual fully flowing animations. It's literally just a bunch of moody graphics linking their songs together.,1484438400,,598,4.815533980582524

With predictable precision , character dialogue is suddenly intruded upon by crash blasting sound effects. I found myself CONSTANTLY running my volume control from one end of the scale to the other.

5064742,3,B0079J28NW,"The Beatles were not enthusiastic about staring in an animated feature, but they saw YELLOW SUBMARINE as an easy way to meet a contractual obligation.  They supplied music, most of it previously released, some of it unreleased and presented as new, and they appeared in a brief live action scene to end the film, but they didn't bother to voice their characters; that was handled by Paul Angelis, Peter Batten, John Clive, and Geoff Hughes, with Dick Emery and Lance Percival in support.  Released in 1968, the movie received positive reviews and was a box office success.

There is little in the way of story.  A peaceful undersea kingdom, Pepperland, is invaded by the Blue Meanies, who despise music, joy, and laughter.  Only one citizen, Fred, escapes in a yellow submarine, in which he flies to Liverpool and encounters Ringo.  Fred and Ringo convince John, George, and Paul to help them, and they set off to Pepperland.  Along the way they encounter a sea of time, of science, of monsters, and nothing, where the meet the nowhere man.  After passing through the foothills of the headlands and a sea of holes, they arrive to do battle with the Blue Meanies.

The film succeeds on two points, the most obvious being the music.  The Beatles were near the height of their popularity, and fans flocked to the movie to hear the songs.  And most of the songs are impressive, with about a dozen songs ranging from Eleanor Rigby to Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds to All You Need Is Love.  The second point is the art, which is a mixture of pop art and psychedelia, a sort of amalgamation of Andy Warhol and Peter Max.  The imagery is often spectacular, and many of the visual concepts stick in your mind for a long, long time.

On the other hand, for all its sound and color and well-intended story, YELLOW SUBMARINE is a film without much emotional warmth.  It is also rather slow.  In the end, it is probably best recalled for its ideas and set piecesthe Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds is particularly memorablethan it is as a whole.  The DVD release restores the film to a near-pristine level, and includes a contemporary making of piece (enjoyable) and an audio commentary (less interesting than I had expected), storyboards, interviews, etc.  Of lasting importance?  Nah.  Fun for what it is?  Sure, and fans will enjoy it.

5064818,5,B0079J28NW,"BOTTOM LINE: This is a cool film, perfectly safe & suitable viewing for the entire family. A positive message, some classic Beatles tunes and mesmerizing animation make this a blast. This is a great way to introduce your young ones to some terrific music; they may quickly find it among their new favorites. 5 STARS for the marvelous magical mystery movie, the Beatles' YELLOW SUBMARINE!

THE STORY: The evil Blue Meanies declare war on the peaceful world of Pepperland because they can't stand music, thrive on disorder and, well... just because. The Beatles are brought to Pepperland aboard the trusty Yellow Submarine and, disguised as Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (whom they eerily resemble), the Fab Four battle the Blue Meanies with the all-healing power of their groovy music.

THOUGHTS: After catching only snippets of this film over the last 40 years, I finally plunked down some dough and bought myself a copy and sat and watched it from beginning to end. As soon as it was over I went through all of the supplemental material and then watched it again.  What a wonderful film this is! Hard to believe that the same animation team that produced the pedestrian Beatles cartoon show for ABC television also did this amazing flick. Obviously the era in which it was made & released almost dictated that it be a psychedelic assault on the eyes, but in so many ways YELLOW SUBMARINE isn't just a ""smoke some dope and trip out on this thing!"" film.  As the movie goes along, it all becomes rather a beautiful work of art in motion. In many ways, much of the visual style is heavily reminiscent of the crude-ish animation on the old Monty Python series. In many other ways it is unlike anything I've ever witnessed in animation - before or since. Of course it features some classic Beatles tunes, along with three made just for this film. They all sound clearer and more incredible than I've heard them before.

THE BLU-RAY:  Fans of this film should rejoice; you'll be amazed at how incredible it looks & sounds. YELLOW SUBMARINE was painstakingly restored by hand, one frame at a time, by a small team of dedicated folks. The impressive results make this well worth the investment. It looks pristine & perfect. The only gripe I have is about the dialogue, and it's a minor one. It's a little on the soft side, and much of what is said seems rather mumbled. Turning on the subtitles on my second go-round helped tremendously. (The subtitles looks really nice, crisp & sharp, by the way.) There are lots of great bonus content included on this Blu-ray, including new interviews with a few of the voice actors & film crew, a feature-length commentary track with the animation director & producer, a vintage making of featurette and the film's theatrical trailer. There's also 3 storyboard sequence breakdowns and several behind the scenes photos. But wait, there's more! In addition to the supplements on the disc itself, the packaging includes an informative 16 page booklet, four 4""x6"" cell transparencies, (one of each of John, Paul, George and Ringo) and even a cool little sheet of stickers featuring characters from the film!",1440288000,6,3142,4.820037105751392

5064864,5,B0079J28NW,"Yellow Submarine is an animated musical fantasy film based on the music of The Beatles. The film was directed by animation producer George Dunning, and produced by United Artists and King Features Syndicate. Initial reports said that the Beatles themselves would provide their own character voices,however, aside from composing and performing the songs, the real Beatles participated only in the closing scene of the film, while their cartoon counterparts were voiced by other actors.

The Blue Meanies take over Pepperland, draining it of all its color and music, firing anti-music missiles, bonking people with green apples, and turning the inhabitants to stone by way of the pointed finger of a giant white glove. As the only survivor, the Lord Admiral escapes in the yellow submarine and goes to London to enlist the help of the Beatles. The charming and innocent boys travel through strange worlds and meet bizarre characters, including the Nowhere Man. Several blissed-filled musical sequences and drug references later, the Beatles drive out the Blue Meanies and restore Pepperland to tranquility armed with only music, love, and witty remarks.

The movie is an animated meandering journey filled with puns and dry British humor, where psychedelic music videos take precedent over any linear story. What little there is of a plot, however, concerns a vibrantly colored place called Pepperland that resembles the album cover for Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band come to life. The swirling animation is a mixture of pop-culture images and modern artistic styles brought loosely together with a nave antiwar message and some clever political commentary.

Also,the animated feature could be considered a family movie as it will definitely provide fun and entertainment to viewers of all ages. Also,it is characterized by a joyful blend of colorful animation and the music of the Beatles will delight anyone regardless of age.",1430870400,,1932,5.327868852459017

5064914,4,B0079J28NW,"Bottom line first, for a first time viewer, this will be a fun popcorn movie. Good time for a family. Maybe Yellow Submarine in 2015 will not be all that those of us who can remember, will remember.
{}{}{}{{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{
I well remember my excitement all the way back in 1968 when I got to see Yellow Submarine. This was a time when movie screens were very big, newly released movies where shown in movie palaces and I was just beginning to get into Pop music. At that time this was a silly story, built around some wonderful Beatles songs, a few of them new and all held together by some very creative animation.

Not quite 50 years later , between the uneven color qualities, a much smaller TV screen and maturation of the concept of music videos and Yellow Submarine does not seem quite as magical.

The good news is that The Beatles Music is still as magical as it was then. Audio quality is not something I can attest to, I speak only to the artistry of the `Fab Four"". The musical inspiration is still there. Beatles movies are known for the verbal by-play and punning the best of the dialog are the comments they toss back and forth.  Some of the visuals remain trippy - No Where Man and It's Only a Northern Song, the Sea of Holes.  Lucie in the Sky with Diamonds music and visuals are ""waiting to take you away"" if you will let yourself go with it. Other parts just drag or look like filler. All Together Now once looked original and now looks tired.  Eleanor Rigby, has some powerful imagery but what is it doing is what is mostly a light entertainment?

I was looking forward to some special, special features. There are some short interviews, I guess mostly people still alive. Besides a few behind the scenes secrets, there is not much here. As much video as exists about this movie and the singers, the animators and yet the Special Features are underwhelming.

Yellow Submarine as a movie is uneven. As an early form of music video it is historic. Yellow Submarine is family friendly on almost every level. No bad words, no nudity and the violence is as near to comic non-violence as can be imagined. Given how subversive the Beatles were considered in 1968, that we can now see this movie as family friendly has to be a good subject for amazement.",1420675200,,2274,4.504854368932039
5064915,5,B0079J28NW,"Great family film whether sober or tripping out on some funny stuff.  The animation is revolutionary and so simple I never tire watching it.

I literally wept during Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.  You will see why.  If you have watched any of the renovation extras on any animation tape, then you will have a small idea of the time and love it took these artists to bring this film back to life (cel by cel).  I was eleven years old when this film made it to my small NJ town.  I screamed when the real Beatles appeared on the screen and told us to sing.  We all sang.  There were no VCRs or DVDs etc.  All I remembered about the film, was kept locked away in my mind and heart.  So though to some, this may mean very little; to many it means a great deal.

5064960,5,B0079J28NW,"One of my favorite films of all time - when it first was shown I even saw the uncut version which no longer exists (George Harrison's ""All Too Much"" was originally shown on-screen in its entirety, almost 10 minutes long. It was cut twice; first to 8 min, then down to 6 min). The unexpected success of Hard Day's Night enabled The Beatles to exercise considerable control over both ""Help!"" and ""Yellow Submarine"". ""Help"" was only modestly successful compared to HDN and TYS, but watching them decades later all three movies show the same sly humor and numerous puns so beloved of British comedies (such as the ""Carry On"" franchise). Despite artist Peter Max trying to take credit for the look of ""Yellow Submarine"", it was Czech-German illustrator Heinz Edelmann who was in charge of art direction and character designs for the 1968 animated film. This movie was a radical change from the 'everything realistic and pretty' style of Disney animation, and popular media from poster art to comic books to display fonts in advertising, was influenced by its success.

5065019,1,B0079J28NW,"The ""reissued"" version of the Yellow Submarine movie is an abomination.  The original film was a masterpiece.  The people who made it fought tooth and nail for artistic integrity.  The director died in the 70s.  The guy who gained control of reissuing the film was a producer and money man with no artistic credentials.  He reedited and revamped the film making substantial changes.  If someone did this to ""Casablanca"" or a Stanley Kubric film, people wouldn't stand for it.

The song ""Hey Bulldog"" was offered by the Beatles as the film was all but finished on the verge of its contractual deadline for completion.  A last minute attempt was made to try to animate the song to see if it could be fit into the film.  The animation was deemed to be sub-standard.  An aesthetic decision was made on the part of the creative team who made the film, not to include the song in the movie.

The producer who many decades later managed to position himself in a control of the film, reversed the decision of the film's original creators and put the song into the movie.  In addition to this, he changed the film's ending and generally felt free to re-edit the film to suit ""his"" own ""creative"" whims.

How is this possible?  Do we view this film as just a cartoon -- so it can be flippantly altered in this way without anyone objecting?  No movie deserves to be altered in this way.  Yellow Submarine was critically acclaimed in its own time and later acknowledged as a classic.  It and its creators deserve proper respect.",1392508800,8,1516,4.597014925373134

5065058,3,B0079J28NW,"This interesting tidbit of outlandish animation, Beatles music, and its trippy nature was given a new DVD release and a Blu-ray debut last year from Apple, who's team had just completed a 4K frame-by-frame resto.

The first DVD release from MGM in 1999 was a decent effort, but had its problems. While non-anamorphic, its video quality was a mixed bag ranging from washed out color to edge enhancement. There is some interlacing present in a few scenes (mainly the beginning and end credits), but not throughout (see where I'm getting at here).  Audio quality is somewhat inconsistent too, the 5.1 mix had dialog portions quiet as a mouse, but musical numbers were excessively LOUD; almost ear-shattering. But at least the mono track is present (although some parts switch to down-converted stereo, due to lost audio material).

The Apple/Capitol DVD from last year uses the 4K restoration the BR uses. It is a massive improvement in visual presentation as far as the source goes. Colors pop, details sparkle, and it looks like one of Disney's platinum releases (but obviously its not, tee hee). While this release has the chance to beat the MGM DVD, it falls flat in the video transfer. For some reason (likely to drum-up Blu-Ray sales) Apple thought it was smart to encode whole the feature film INTERLACED, meaning combing on fast moving images/sequences and a nasty case of staircasing. This is annoying on progressive displays even with 1080P up conversion via the player or scaler, though its not noticeable on CRTs as they are interlaced by default. Strangely, the trailers and featuretts are encoded progressive as most DVD's have them the opposite.  The 5.1 audio is the EXACT same one as the previous DVDs, meaning inconstant volumes. But it is in DTS, which sadly doesn't help much aside from the bit-rate. It also has German & Italian 5.1 tracks which are derived from the English mix, a 2.0 Eng Stereo track (downmixed from the 5.1 track) and the original Mono mix (which still encounters the same stereo switching issues).

If you want to see YS in its best (progressive Hi-res), shell out for a BR player and the Blu-ray disc.  Audio and extras are the exact same as the DVD, but the audio is DTS-MA (7.1 & 5.1 tracks) and DD 2.0 224kbs (ENG stereo and Mono).

5065063,5,B0079J28NW,"From KING FEATURES, creators of such low-budget cartoons as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BEETLE-BAILEY/dp/B000WC38NM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BEETLE BAILEY</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KRAZY-KAT/dp/B0000C2IX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KRAZY KAT</a>, comes the full-length animated classic, YELLOW SUBMARINE (1968).

This is a superbly crafted film, one that holds up remarkably well. Intense, vivid colors, complexly designed animations, easy-to-recognize characters and an enchanting story are only a few of the picture's highlights.

Best of all are the visuals that illustrate several Beatles tracks.

""Eleanor Rigby,"" like the song itself is properly British with its quick flashes of English scenery, crowds of faceless people and glimpses of the rundown neighborhood where this sad and lonely woman lived and died.

""Only a Northern Song,"" combined with its music is almost trance-inducing. Very trippy right from the outset, the sequence culminates with an arc of slowly-moving Beatles above a large cube that hypnotically pulses every 1/24th of a second between day-glo green and lemon yellow.

""Lucy in the Sky"" is an outline of a flapperish-looking girl, animated as a sort of rainbow color blotched Toulouse Latrec poster. She dances on the song's upbeat choruses in her flowing dress and feathers.

""When I'm Sixty-Four"" explains in animated text that there are more than 33 million minutes in 64 years, then illustrates how long a minute really is, by using giant numbers in a variety of bizarre designs (including characters from the movie) that click by in time to the song.

There's much more to enjoy here. If you're an animation aficionado and have never seen YELLOW SUBMARINE, please do so. It's a treat for the eyes, ears and soul!

In addition to an epilogue cameo by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, cartoon voices are provided by:

 Paul Angelis - Chief Blue Meanie / Ringo
 John Clive - John
 Dick Emery - Jeremy Hilary Boob, Ph. D - Nowhere Man / Lord Mayor / Max
 Geoffrey Hughes - Paul
 Lance Percival - Young / Old Fred
 Peter Batten - George

5065066,5,B0079J28NW,"I recently bought a Blu-ray player and was shopping for some movies that I hadn't seen in many years and which I suspected might benefit greatly from the Blu-ray treatment because of their visuals. That lead me of course to ""Yellow Submarine"".

""Yellow Submarine"" (originally released in 1968; 89 min.) brings the delightful story of how Pepperland is invaded by the Blue Meanies, and how the Fab Four is recruited to restore order in Pepperland. Several comments: first, I hadn't seen this movie in probably several decades and was delighted to see how it still captivated my attention with both its irreverent and nonsensical (intentional at that) plot and its outrageous (in the best possible way) visuals. Second, speaking of those visuals, the Blu-ray treatment of the movie is done masterfully. When the closing credits roll, we are informed that due to the ""delicate nature"" of the original movie, the update was done manually and frame-by-frame. All I can say is that the end result is fantastic. Third, as I was watching the movie, I couldn't help but think that the Beatles music featured in the movie is a further forewarning (following the earlier 2 Beatles movies) of the eventual video clip format of MTV, check out for example how ""Eleanor Rigby"" early in the movie is the perfect 3 min. video clip on its own. Fourth, the bonus materials (totaling about 25 min.) are nice but ultimately non-essential (for me anyway), and I doubt that I'll watch them again. The main item from these bonus materials for me were the interviews with Paul Angelis and John Clive, who provided for voices for Ringo and John, respectively, and how Eric Segal was recruited for a quick make-over of the script, but all these interviews are woefully short (1 to 2 min. each).

All that aside, it is amazing to me that ""Yellow Submarine"" is celebrating its 45th anniversary this year, yet it remains as fresh and as relevant today than it was when it first came out. And I cannot say enough about the fantastic visual upgrade this Blu-ray release is. Bottom line: ""Yellow Submarine"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1372982400,,2096,4.851955307262569

The Beatles' full-length animated feature is so unique that nothing quite like it has been done before or since.  'Yellow Submarine' is on the top ten--make that top five--of my favorite movies list because of the themes, the images, the battle, the journey--in all of its contexts--not to mention the way it interprets and elaborates on the music.

I'll always revisit this movie, so I my main concern here is to say what a treat it is to see it in all its Blu-ray glory, which doesn't disappoint.  It is vivid, and, of course, it doesn't hurt to have my first widescreen TV recently obtained being a part of the equation.  Of course getting a home entertainment system wouldn't hurt, and most of you reading this have already finished that step, but it is a good for judgment's sake to be able to state the enhanced visuals without being distracted by ""surround sound"" and not be able to focus on what a Blu-ray experience will enhance.

5065124,5,B0079J28NW,"I had the Yellow Submarine DVD and this BLU RAY is a major improvement in both picture and sound. The only reason why I watched the original DVD was to listen to the 5.1 surround sound mix,which was good. But on this Blu Ray the sound is dramatically improved and the surround sound mixes of the songs are amazing. Even a weak song like Northern Song becomes a joy to listen to in surround sound. You don't have to fast forward to get to the songs, you can select each song individually in the scene menu. You also have the choice of listening to the film in it's original mono. I'm not a fan of animated films, but this is a nice film for children, or adults who like animated films. When it came out it was ahead of its time. But for a big time Beatles fan  like myself, this is well worth having just to listen to the songs. The only Beatles recording that compares is the Beatles Love DVD Audio disc. The songs that are on this Blu Ray are, in my opinion, the best sounding Beatles tunes you can hear in terms of audio quality, with the possible exception of Beatles Love DVD Audio.",1360195200,,1086,4.221153846153846
5065125,3,B0079J28NW,"I guess when you're a kid, you'll watch darn near anything, as long as it's something that appeals to your 'kid' brain. Yellow Submarine fits that bill nicely, with lots of pretty colors, silly jokes and a good-vs-evil storyline. But as an adult, you need something more. Yellow Submarine certainly stands in a class by itself as an animated curiosity. I had not seen this movie since I was 10 or 12, and quite honestly, it was a lot tougher this time around. While the funny, flashing fish with human faces and the bright neon colors that could have been ripped from a deadbeat hippie's tie-dyed t-shirt might have been fun for a child, as an adult, it just comes off as a 90-minute assault on the optic nerves. The constantly changing colors and eerie geometric patterns are a guaranteed way to jump-start a headache. It was great to hear the Fab 4 sing their hearts out, especially on ""Nowhere Man"" and ""All You Need Is Love"", 2 of my favorite Beatles songs. But the irritating, garish colors, the clash of psychedelia meets pop art, just drags on for far too long. I kept thinking, ""Boy, they must have had some AWESOME drugs in the 60's!"" It comes as no surprise that the song 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds' (LSD) is included in the movie. And you have to wonder about the head Blue Meanie, and the fact that he's wearing what looks suspiciously like a Mouseketeer's hat. Is that just coincidence, a sly insult to Disney, or a tip of the hat to one of animation's undisputed masters?

As a good litmus test for your patience, you might consider the fact that one of the key people involved in the production was none other than Al Brodax,  responsible for some of the worst episodes ever in the Popeye cartoon franchise (1960-1962).

The restoration of this odd film was nothing short of immaculate, although the speaking voices of Fred and the Beatles sounds muddled compared to the music. I was constantly 'throttling down' the volume on the musical numbers. Honestly, this movie never looked better than it has on this DVD. But it's one of those films that, once you've seen it, you're good for another 15 or 20 years. It will take you that long to recover from the last viewing.",1360195200,2,2188,4.56234096692112

The film is colorful, funny and safe to watch with a four-year-old too. The extras and the packaging are great and anyone familiar with the film or the Beatles will be happy to own it. My only problem is with the film itself--it's a little too long and wears out its welcome before the conclusion. I understand part of the restoration was reinserting the Hey Bulldog section toward the end, but every time I watch it, I feel like it's ""done"" after the All You Need Is Love performance.

5065153,5,B0079J28NW,"Until I ordered this product, I had only seen bits and pieces of Yellow Submarine. Seeing the whole feature is a fantastic experience for anyone -- young, old, music fans, animation fans, fans of having fun, fans of pretty colors, and of course, Beatles fans. It is a visually spectacular tale filled with wonder, music and love. Viewing this now from an adult perspective, a few things are clear:

  * This is truly a seminal work of animation. Even if not Beatles fans (why not?), this is a must-have for cinemaphiles and animation-philes. You can see how it influenced Terry Gilliam (Monty Python) among many others.
  * This is classic story-telling. A bit of Wizard of Oz, a dash of Tolkien, some quasi-vaudevillian comedy and FAB music.
  * The Beatles stay true to a couple of Beatle-y themes: 1) Self-reference - can you spot all the references to their songs in the script? 2) Love is all you need.
  * Apple really did put out some creative products before it destroyed the Beatles.
  * If you ever want to explain to someone what ""psychedelia"" means, have them watch Yellow Submarine.

I read lots of reviews on here before buying this remastered product. I had no issues with the sound volume (loud, which is how I like it - and controllable by the listener anyway) or the visuals. Most colorful thing anyone will ever see. The accompanying booklet and cels are a nice bonus. Nothing not to like here.

5065161,4,B0079J28NW,"""Yellow Submarine manages to win over its surrealist, psychedelic edge with impressive and abstract visuals/animation of its time and legendary soundtrack. It is the kind of film that you watch while on drugs (but don't!). It does suffer from story/plot-based mechanics and overuse of limited visuals but the film eclipses its negative points by being what it was meant to be as a clear metaphor for The Beatles' quirky nature especially during the Sgt. Pepper Lonely Hearts Club Band era. It almost leads you to believe how much animation has to offer especially in the world of music of this calibre. As a person interested in animation, film, and experimentation, this is recommended or required viewing. I'm glad Disney did not try to distort the film's creative spirit with 3D motion-capture animation and also for not being done with much digital software.""

PRO: Psychedelic and imaginative spirit. Music soundtrack. The Beatles featured throughout. Strikingly vivid and austere visuals. Special effects. No use of LSD during the showing.

5065168,4,B0079J28NW,"The Beatles, having just completed their monumental recording of ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" in early April and started recording for the ""Magical Mystery Tour"" film project in late April of 1967, signed contracts in early May for the making of a full-length animated film based around their 1966 song ""Yellow Submarine"". They were to provide at least three new songs and allow use of others previously released for the soundtrack. The Yellow Submarine film was theatrically released by United Artists (in mono) in UK theaters premiering on 7/17/68 (the following day they worked on recording ""Cry Baby Cry"" and ""Helter Skelter"") and in the US on 11/13/68. The album of the same name however, wasn't released until UK 1/17/69 and US 1/13/69. There were two reasons for the delay. One was that the band felt the November 1968 release of ""The Beatles"" should take precedence, the other was that George Martin wanted to re-record his orchestral score for side two of the LP, which he did in two three hour sessions on Oct. 22 and 23. The first ""new"" song for the film was ""Only A Northern Song"", which was originally George Harrison's first offering for the Sgt. Pepper album, and began life in the studio on 2/13/67. This track was mixed mono for the film, mock stereo for LP, and never mixed stereo or 5.1 until 1999. The second contribution was Lennon/McCartney's ""Baby You're A Rich Man"", the first song recorded especially for the film. It was recorded and mixed mono on 5/11/67 in less than six hours. Though it was used in the film, it was released as the B-side of ""All You Need Is Love"" on 7/7/67, just prior to the film's release. It too was mono on film, and mock stereo until 1999 (except for The Beatles Box, Parlophone 1971). The next evening brought McCartney's ""All Together Now"". It also was recorded and mixed mono in less than six hours. May 25 began another Harrison number, ""It's All Too Much"". Finally,  Lennon's ""Hey Bulldog"", making it four new songs, was recorded. The song's lyrics were completed, music composed, recorded and mixed in a single ten hour session on 2/11/68.  According to engineer Geoff Emerick, everyone was especially pleased with that tune. They were filmed recording it, but the footage was actually used to promote ""Lady Madonna"". The happy mood seen on that footage might be because they knew it was their last recording session before leaving for their long holiday in India. The ""Hey Bulldog"" animated film segment was only seen theatrically in Europe and not available in the US until the 1999 DVD.

Video tape and LaserDisc was released for home use in 1987 by MGM/UA in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio and simulated stereo. After a couple of years, it went out of print.

Then, after cleaning the original film negative and rejuvenating the color in 1999, MGM/Apple released the widescreen DVD, 5.1 Dolby Digital, restoring the ""Hey Bulldog"" sequence and adding several special features. This version also went out of print.

Finally, we have the the 2012 Apple Blu-ray and DVD released in June, after the May theatrical release. Compared to the MGM 1999 DVD, the Apple 2012 reissue is a welcomed improvement. Both the audio and video are better.

Video: This is the major improvement of this new release. The film has been restored in 4K digital resolution for the first time by Paul Rutan Jr. and his team at Triage Motion Picture Services and Eque Inc. Because of the delicacy of the hand-drawn original artwork, no automated software was employed in the digital clean-up, it was all done by hand, frame by frame, over a four month period. I can't imagine the man hours involved, but the results are spectacular, clean and vivid! Though the 1999 DVD  release says ""widescreen"" and the new blu-ray says 1.66:1, there is more picture information visible on the blu-ray. I have not yet verified their true aspect ratios.

Audio: I am happy to say that the same 1999 5.1 remix by Pete Cobbin is incorporated here. He did an exceptional job! Messing with the Beatle's soundtracks is a delicate task, especially when ""enhancing"". Keep in mind that these new mixes originated from 4 track analog tapes, often having several separately recorded instruments overlaid on the same track and running though boards all intended for mono. The sound here is as if the master tape is being played back.  These recordings were made by Norman Smith and Geoff Emerick back in 1965-68, yet they sound better than most recordings made today. Listen for example to the vocals and the strings in ""Eleanor Rigby"" or the clarinets and tubular bells in ""When I'm Sixty Four"".  The surround enhancement is done very tastefully, especially during the songs. The songs don't sound pulled apart as some engineers would do. I especially like the surround effects done for ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"". Throughout the well known songs you hear more distinction between instruments and harmonies.

For the first time, we have it in DTS at home. The theatrical re-release of the film in 1999 included a new 5.1 remix in the DTS audio format, however, the subsequent 1999 DVD was released only in 5.1  Dolby Digital. We now have it in DTS-HD Master Audio (English only), which sounds better than in Dolby Digital.

There are however, two audio caveats. The first being that the output level is about 11.5 dB too loud. Though the dynamic range is actually improved by 2.0 dB over the Dolby Digital DVD, the over-all level is set way above reference level, so be cautious.

The second caveat is the omission of the music-only option, which allowed you to listen to the film's score only (no dialog or sound effects) on the 1999 DVD. I found it interesting, but I suppose most didn't.

Bonus features: Both the Yellow Submarine DVD and Blu-ray include a short making-of documentary titled Mod Odyssey"" (TRT: 7:30), the film's original theatrical trailer, audio commentary by producer John Coates and art director Heinz Edelmann, several brief interview clips with others involved with the film, storyboard sequences, 29 original pencil drawings and 30 behind-the-scenes photos. Both Digipaks include reproductions of 4 animation film cells, 10 collectible stickers, and a 16-page booklet (same text as 1999 insert) with a new essay by Yellow Submarine aficionado John Lasseter (Chief Creative Officer, Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios).

5065186,3,B0079J28NW,"My review will most likely be a lone, dissenting voice but I think it is worth recording.

By way of a disclaimer, I saw this movie in 1968 when I was 7 years old, when it came out in the movie theaters. I remember being surrounded by a lot of long-haired people who were smoking in a very large theater somewhere on the West Side of New York. It has always been and remains one of my very favorite films ever.

I bought the Blu-ray disc pre-order and did not watch it until tonight about two months later. At first I had set the audio preset to two channels stereo but had to switch midstream to the mono for the following reasons. There is also another point I will make:

First, the sound effects, including the music are mixed way higher than the voices speaking in the film. That means the volume has to be set very high to hear the dialogue, which means the music and sound effects volume will literally blast you out of your seat. We had to turn off the stereo and listen on the TV speakers because it was ear-shattering and I could not disturb my neighbors. The balance between volume levels is acceptable on the original monaural mix, meaning that the music and sound effects once again do not overwhelm the dialogue.

Another, sad complaint I think is that on my 720 dpi Samsung 32 inch screen the digital remaster of the print is just too hard edged. One comment I made to my friend was that it looked like it was re-mastered on a different drug than it was originally produced on. The eye-popping colors, hard edges and super-sharp images in my opinion detract from the softer, more ""user-friendly"" analog version I have seen over the years. I have never taken DMT but this is what I imagine it must be like, it was so pronounced it basically gave me a headache to watch.

In all, I feel they over-produced this master, both by focusing so hard on the audio to the detriment of the dialogue, which is lost in the mix, and the super-sharp  rendition of animation that were clearly hand-drawn etc.

The music, however, is masterfully produced and when the songs come on it is all glory.

As I said, this is likely a minority opinion but I would have preferred something a little truer to the conception of the film where it just seemed softer and more accessible, truly a peaceful spirit in the film which I feel is lost in this blu-ray remaster, maybe that is the nature of Blu-ray, but in an animated film you really see the difference and I not 100% pleased.

As a matter of fact, if I could I would exchange it for an earlier reproduction where I feel I could watch the film without the associated angst.

Thanks for sharing.",1346544000,33,2639,4.40041067761807
5065187,5,B0079J28NW,"I was never that big of a Beatles fan, chalk that up to timing and/or whatever, I appreciate their music and vast contributions to society........but that left me in the category of never having seen ""Yellow Submarine"" in my youth.  The review, however, of the DVD in the last issue of Film Comment made me take note and a chance on it.  Boy am I happy that I did, not only is it one of the most truly creative and inspiring animation films of all time but an absolutely terrific film to share with the family, in my case wife and five year old son.  Kids are already familiar with the submarine, blue meanies and oddly enough all of the beatles due to books that now circulate in pre-school, my son knew more going into it than I ever did!  And that's a real joy, we all watched the first time in awe and as of now, it's a DVD that has circulated on our screen multiple times without ever losing that magic.  The remastered release also comes with some nifty fan stuff in the DVD package, nothing that I'm apt to hold too sacred but great additions nevertheless.",1346544000,2,1063,4.321608040201005

This package is very well put together in a cardboard slipcase and a pocket that holds 4 transparencies for each of the cartoon band members plus a nifty 16-page colour booklet containing an introduction by John Lasseter of Pixar fame among a number of other interesting quotes and articles from others.

The all important picture quality is excellent looking fabulous in 1080p and I really enjoyed the sound quality in DTS-HD MA 5.1 surround although a PCM Stereo option is also available.  The only complaint I have about the sound quality is that the spoken dialogue is a little softer than when the musical bits come up which is a little annoying as the sudden increase in volume levels whenever the scene switches from the songs to the spoken bits may cause you to want to quickly reach for the remote before you wake up the neighbours but thankfully the difference in volume levels isn't too wide although it is wide enough for me to notice.

Otherwise, this is an excellent, very well put together release from Apple (the original non-tech company) with great cartoon content, very good picture and sound quality as well making this an easy review.

Also, why don't the extra's include both segments to show viewers the difference. Even more, the 1999 remaster went through P.Gabriel's 48 track set up to remaster the sound. Did they take the 1968 source and remaster it or did they take the 1968 remastered versions for the iTunes iPod and USB promos, or what?

The mix of traditional animation and the Peter Maxian designs still holds a fascination to this day, with the sound quality now absolutely stunning. Granted, the imaginations behind much of the movie was lysergically enhanced, but it adds to the time-charm of the movie. I can't recommend this enough to Beatles Fans, who already know the songs and probably many of the scenes by heart.

Extra Credit due Dept: I really dig the 'cell' reproductions included in the Blu-Ray package. The bonus interviews with surviving members of the cast and crew are brief but delightful, but the VH1 Interview with the surviving Beatles from the '99 DVD release might have been a nice addition. You can choose between mono and 5:1 surround, depending on your purist nature, and the sequence for ""Hey Bulldog"" has been reintegrated into the film seamlessly.

The quality is amazing. I have a 1080p screen. There is no way it could have been better. However, It is so bizarre and difficult to watch. I guess I don't appreciate the whole drugs and psychedelic thing. It just seems a product of mind that has already shown signs of deterioration form drug use.

Good vs. evil, Pepperland, The funny Yellow Submarine,  Bluish People and recreating The Beatles down pat to how they walk the walk is something to watch.  Original widescreen ratio of 1:66:1 restored with incredible vibrant colors brings 1968 up to date.  As a movie it is a busy, multiple movement of things happening at the same time that might even blow away the young gadget crowd of present times.  Short attention is no problem on this baby.  As a video music film for what it is, ""The Yellow Submarine"" is a fantastic trip of 1 1/2 hours that flys by quickly.  The plot?  Who cares.  Click on the subtitles so the English words don't get lost with the strawberries and cream.  Maybe a bag of nachos, too.  It's nice to be a kid again briefly before the monday morning work alarm goes off to start another week of grind.  Take the trip. It's fun escape back to Pepperland.  Better now than 1968.

According to the films addendum restoration credit, the restoration was completed frame -by frame, and is comparable to Criterion releases and superior to most High Definition remastered classics.

Let us not forget the films audio. The soundtrack employs all the care that any Beatles commodity deserves. The Beatle classics, as well as George Martin compositions envelop the viewer, not by overkill, but rather by complementing the film. My audio equipment, for watching video is a sound bar with subwoofer, using a fiber optic connection.  By far, it is the best sounding Blu-Ray that I own.
The content of the film is appropriate for all ages, although the dialogue offers a few double entendre's for a mature viewers. It is nothing objectionable, just a few comments that may go over most kid's (and some adults) heads.

5065232,5,B0079J28NW,"Even if, like me, you're not the biggest Beatles fan in the universe, the 1968 ""Yellow Submarine"" remains an utter delight. Made to finish off a contractual obligation to United Artists - by which point, in the late `60s, the Beatles were no longer interested in making movies - the psychedelic feature finds John, Paul, Ringo and George whisked away from England in order to save the magical undersea kingdom of ""Pepperland."" There, the music-loving inhabitants are under attack from the ""Blue Meanies,"" who have turned the citizens into statues. It's up to the Beatles along with ""Old Fred"" and his Yellow Submarine to restore color, music and life back to Pepperland, traveling through strange and surreal lands along the way.

""Yellow Submarine"" was produced by King Features and producer Al Brodax, who previously packaged a Saturday morning ""Beatles"" cartoon for ABC that was fairly plastic in its animation. The Beatles themselves, reportedly, stayed away from the movie during most of its production for that reason - only when they saw what was being worked on did they change their minds, agreeing to appear in a live-action sequence at the end and contributing new as well as previously-recorded songs to the soundtrack (""Eleanor Rigby,"" ""All Together Now,"" ""Nowhere Man,"" ""When I'm Sixty-Four,"" ""All You Need Is Love,"" ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" and ""Sgt. Pepper"" are just a few of the tunes to appear throughout). Brodax, director George Dunning and his animation team keep the movie fresh and perfectly suited to repeat viewing, with each song acting like its own set-piece, and constantly changing, eye-popping colors and eclectic design keeping both kids and adults stimulated. It's an all-time animated classic that has lost none of its appeal over the years.

Making its debut on Blu-Ray (as well as a new DVD edition) from Capitol Records/EMI, ""Yellow Submarine"" looks great and sounds absolutely spectacular. The DTS MA 5.1 audio is just amazing - the songs echoing into every speaker of the sound field and carrying a dynamic range that makes it one of the most effective home theater mixes I've ever heard. Though the movie's original mono mix and a PCM stereo track have also been included, neither compare to the brilliant sound design of the DTS MA mix. Visually, the AVC encoded transfer is also impressive, preserving the picture's original 1.66 aspect ratio and offering a gorgeous pallet of colors. Suffice to say, ""Yellow Submarine"" is one of the best looking and sounding discs I've yet seen in the format.

Extra features aren't overwhelming, but will come as welcome inclusions for fans. In addition to a full color booklet and collectible lithographs, the most insightful supplement is a commentary track from producer John Coates with some comments from animator Heinz Edelmann, whose visual designs for the Beatles themselves proved to be the lead inspiration for the project. There's a theatrical trailer (that seems to have been ""re-created"" using HD footage), a vintage featurette ""Mod Odyssey,"" storyboard sequences, pencil drawings, behind the scenes photos, and very short (mostly 1-2 minute) interviews with Paul Angelis and John Clive (who voiced Ringo and John, respectively), animator David Livesey, Edelmann assistant Millicent McMillan, animation director Jack Strokes, and co-writer Erich Segal, who notched one of his first commercial successes a few years before his script for ""Love Story"" became a national phenomenon.",1339632000,5,3476,5.214669051878354

5065234,5,B0079J28NW,"This is a review of the 2012 Blu-Ray release of Yellow Submarine, not a movie review (you can find those elsewhere all over the web).  This is the complete movie, as was the 1999 release.  Just to compare; this release was visually at least as much of an improvement over the 1999 release as that release was over all of it's predecessors, if not more.  Not surprising since the entire film was cleaned and repaired manually cell by cell.

MOVIE VIDEO: The picture is so nice it is hard to believe.  Having only seen the movie on the various home video releases over the last 25 or so years, I have never seen this movie look this good.  I know how bright the colors in various stills and even the 1968 comic book were, but I had no idea that the movie colors actually matched or even surpassed that vividness.  All of the animation looked perfect. The only flaws I could find (specifically looking for flaws, that is) were a very few occasional wobbles in some standing images and the only light pixilation on the entire disk was during the gradient fade up from black during sunrise in Liverpool leading into Eleanor Rigby.  To me, that is absolutely acceptable.  The actual Beatle footage at he end was still a bit grainy, but I consider that to be very acceptable as well.  There is only so much that can be done with poor quality filmstock of live action, at least at this time, and this portion still looks just fantastic compared to any other release of Yellow Submarine.

MOVIE AUDIO:  The 5.1 and mono mixes themselves sound exactly the same as the 1999 release, but both are now lossless audio.  I don't know if they did any new tweaking or reworking for this release or not, but it sounds as grand as you would expect a Beatles product to sound, and both sound very clean and crisp.  I have not listened to the running movie commentary at all yet.

BONUS FEATURES: All of the 1999 release features are here.  The interview footage looks pretty poor, having been recorded on video in the pre-HD days.  However; all of the bonus feature animation footage, including the entire original trailer and all the animation in the ""Mod Odyssey"" documentary, has been cleaned so the quality matches that of the movie.  As for new features; as listed on the packaging there are three storyboard sequences, two of which are alternate scenes from very early pre-production.  This is especially nice because we can finally see the story around The Beatles riding the birds dropped clip that was in the above mentioned Mod Odyssey documentary.  Sadly, that the snippet in Mod Odyssey seems to be the only existing footage of this, as no more was included here.  There are also some original pencil drawings and behind the scenes photos which are interesting to fanatics like me.

PACKAGING: Cardboard - digipack style packaging.  I am not a fan of this style because it is so hard to keep these in good shape over time with normal handling and shelf-ware, but overall it does look very nice.  Glad to have almost the original poster design back as the cover, but in person it looks a bit dark (not as clean and bright looking as the picture here on Amazon).  Not a big deal to me, only making an observation, but it is very noticeable.  The booklet is very nice with additional photos and artwork and some international poster art shown.  There are also some reproduction cells of each of The Beatles and a small page of stickers.  Very nice little extras for a standard edition.

OVERALL: if you are a fan of this movie, this is an unquestionable must for your collection.  Unlike most re-releases, this is worth every cent of re-purchase.",1339459200,26,3635,4.608087091757387

Technically, the transfer is excellent.  Content-wise, it was like putting on a pair of paisley bell bottom pants.  You look at it and think ""What the hell is that?""

The colors and graphics are vintage Peter Max style eye-exploding visuals.  The story and dialogue are mostly mumbles and nonsense.

I owned the tape and I owned the DVD but both of those fell flat.  The colors were washed out and on the tape ""Hey Bulldog"" had been removed.  This release brings back all those memories of that 10 year old kid sitting in the theater seeing it for the first time.  The audio mix is first rate.  The colors are vibrant.

I find the judder when panning to be an eyesore, but this is something that is inherent in the frame rate. It's just particularly noticeable on a cartoon.
The on-camera interviews (in the extras) are surprisingly brief; literally one or two sentences. I don't find some of the extras to be particularly interesting, but this is a great presentation of an innovative animated feature.
George Martin's score is terrific, and I still love the Eleanor Rigby segment the best. The Nowhere Man character still cracks me up; great voice work.",1339286400,,639,4.7657657657657655

It has unique imagery, a storyline that looks confusing, yet a simple one, and an excellent selection of Beatles music that fits the mood in selected scenes (it is a Beatles film after all!).  If you're a Beatles fan, you'll certainly get a kick from seeing.  Those that are not will enjoy the film's elements that it provides.  8.5 out of 10.

The restoration of this film is one of the best restorations ever made.  Based upon a 4K restoration, unnecessary dirt has been removed and colors have been re-adjusted to match how it's supposed to represent. Grain has mostly been removed, but finding moments of DNR movement are slim, and does not affect everything else that the restoration provides.  4.5 out of 5

As for the Audio... what a beast!  For a 1968 film, the 5.1 remix sounds like it was done today!  The entire sound field has been used throughout the film, with sound effects booming and spreading through different speakers, dialogue clean and consistent, and the music all taking advantage of the 5.1, with newly-remixed Beatles songs that are now better than ever.  Original Mono and Stereo soundtracks are provided, but both cannot be compared to the 5.1 remix.  5 out of 5.

As for extras, it seems all of the bonus material from the previous MGM releases (except for a music-only track) have been provided.

Fans of the Beatles or film collectors should certainly pick up this edition that is now a must-own.",1339200000,5,1495,4.744186046511628

Who would have thought that Yellow Submarine turned out to be one of the best blu-ray releases ever? It is. Color and detail leap from the screen, and the immersive 5.1 DTS soundtrack is nothing less than stupendous. I have never heard sound sound so good on a blu-ray disc before. I haven't seen the film since sometime in the late 70's, and boy how I had forgotten how funny and entertaining it is.

If you are a Beatles fan, a music fan, a sound fan, an animation fan or simply a film fan, Yellow Submarine should be on your short list of must-have blu-ray titles.",1339200000,2,690,4.390625

The  beautiful colors and sound are A-1 top notch.
I thought the 1999 dvd look great until I saw this brand new frame by frame restoration.
The extras on the blu-ray are pretty much the same ones from the 1999 release, but to se the film on blu, is like seeing a brand new print of the film, easliy one of the best reissues/restorations of the year, Paul Rutan Jr. did an excellent restoration, he also was the one who restored Help! and A Hard Days Night years back.
The digipack packaging also come with some cool pack-ins as a super cool bonus.
I like that the original mono track is included as well as the 5.1 HD and PCM tracks.
Kinda a shame that some new bonus features were not included, but that's a very minor quibble.

5065245,5,B0079J28NW,"My review of the Blu-ray Yellow Submarine can be summed up as perfection in digital restoration. No computers were used, every one of the hundreds of thousands of cells were restored by hand. Compared to my laser disk copy at 425 lines of resolution we now have true 1080p with not a single flaw, no bleeding of colors, no blurriness, no video noise, vibrant colors and upgraded sound to DTS high definition. Regarding the story simply turn off your mind and enjoy the psychedelic journey with the wonderful music primarily from Sargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It is a simple story of our eternal  battle against fascism; naively the Blue Meanies are overcome with love and music; if only it were this simple. The 1.5 hour commentary is of little value so expect no insights into the story, symbols, music or artistic decisions. There is only one...the Blue Meanies were supposed to be the Red Meanies (Communists), but an administrative error resulted in Blue and they decided to go with it. According to today's or even past Disney standards the animation is crude. But that does not matter. There is an element in this animation which is priceless. And that is, it embodies a naive and nostalgic 1968 flower power philosophy that the world can be changed and that we can all live in a peaceful paradise of freedom, joy, and creativity free from oppression....because all you need is Love.",1339113600,3,1401,4.813278008298755
5065246,5,B0079J28NW,"This Blu-ray version of YELLOW SUBMARINE is truly brilliant and vivid to the eye. It is really an endearing film especially if grew up during the period when this film was released. It is a product of that time and a most beloved one. Despite the Beatles not doing their own voices for their animated selves on the screen, it works wonderfully. YELLOW SUBMARINE is a work of art in its own right. One thing I have always loved about this film was George Martin's score. Without that score this film would not be what it is. George Martin's score and the animated images so are effectively integrated that the melding of the two created a very moving and singular narrative that has been engrained into the psyche of the viewers of that time any since that have been so enamored by this film.",1339113600,3,791,4.5
5065247,5,B0079J28NW,"and truly a labor of love, both in its original artwork and the meticulous attention to detail in the restoration process, both visually and audibly. As an original (now aged) Beatle fan, take it from me, this production never looked or sounded so good, not even in its original theatrical presentation. Nor have I ever heard the lads' songs in such detail through the use of such innovative surround processing. Don't let this slip through your fingers. Buy it, and be awe-inspired by the groundbreaking animation techniques applied in the brilliant Lucy In The Sky and Eleanor Rigby sequences that are so indicative of the decade and style of the Beatles, the sharp wit and humor, and some pretty good lessons along the way.

Colors are better, the picture is the sharpest its ever been and the music is well, still the Beatles which means if you're a fan it's a no-brainer. This is the same version as the DVD which means it includes ""Hey Bulldog"" and a few other minor changes from the VHS release. The audio is available in both a new HD surround track or the original film version.

The movie itself is very simple but wonderfully weird as it involves freeing Pepperland from the clutches of the ""Blue Meanies"", with numerous Beatles songs along the way.

5065260,4,B0079J28NW,"While I am not a great fan of the film itself, it is still an eye-opening return to the 1960s of Peter Max (and would have been a lot more fun if the Beatles had contributed their voices to the dialogue sections).

The picture has been beautifully restored by hand, frame by frame.  The colors are amazing!!!

The audio is stirring! The first thing you notice about the 5.1 track is how clean it is.  The only other time I have come across such great audio on Beatles' songs was with the DVD soundtrack accompanying the CD of The Beatles Love (Cirque du Soleil).

The special features on the disc are an odd assortment.  There are some pencil drawings, storyboard sequences, some behind-the-scene photos of the Beatles, a feature-length commentary, and  a few other extras.  The odd part of the extras section are the video interviews with some of the voice talent and other people involved in the production.  For some reason, most only run about a minute.  Why they limited it to that short a length is a puzzle.

The Blu disc is in one-half of a folder.  The other half is a pocket containing four repro film cels of the Beatles ( a neat item). There is also a small sheet of 10 decals.  A nice item in the pouch is a sixteen-page booklet with photos, drawings, and text (regretably, the text is so tiny that it makes a contract's ""small print"" look enormous in comparison.

Highly recommended!",1338940800,10,1397,4.536
5065261,5,B0079J28NW,I remember seeing this on the big screen when it was first released in 1968 when I was a true Beatle maniac.  I guess I still am really.  When I first saw it I remember thinking I wished someday I could have my own copy of it.  At that time there was no such thing as a VHS or DVD player so that thought was merely a fantasy.  Then along came VHS and I bought it on its first day of release.  Then years later it came out on DVD and I got it.  When I got the DVD I thought the color was not as good as my original Big screen viewing.  Well my friend the restored frame by frame hand painting was better than the first time I remember seeing the movie.  God bless the restorers they did an unbelieveable job.  I enjoyed every minute of this new version and the color is spectacular.  I also believe even if you've never seen this movie you will really enjoy it.,1338940800,6,860,3.9766081871345027
5065262,5,B0079J28NW,"""Yellow Submarine"" surfaces with a sharp, colorful presentation for Blu-ray. The 4K restoration for the film looks brilliant and is a huge upgrade when compared to the original 1999 DVD. I haven't seen the DVD remastered edition of this put out at the same time but I would imagine it uses the same high def source. The painstaking restoration for the film is evident in just about every frame which is brimming with more a sharper, more detailed image and colors that positively pop.

The Beatles (none of the band provided their own voices) are recruited to help overthrow the Blue Meanies when they take over Pepperland by Fred who is going to transport the Fab Four in his Yellow Submarine. Things go awry along the way as Ringo gets launched out of the sub, they meet Jeremy a Nowhere Man who finds helps them free Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band from being kept captive by the music hating Blue Meanies. A truly surreal adventure as Jon Lassiter points out in his introduction in the booklet, ""Yellow Submarine"" truly was revolutionary in its day and still looks dazzling.

Image quality is top notch with a painstakingly restored image filled with sharper images than previously seen. The film probably has never looked this good even when it was shown in 1968 as film development and projection techniques weren't quite as good back in 1968. In fact restoration efforts can often reveal flaws in a film as the resolution is so much better than before. The aspect ratio returns the film to its original 1.66:1 presentation (vs. 1.68:1 for the previous DVD and 1.33:1 for the VHS as I recall).

The lossless audio is marvelous sounding.

The special features include a 16 page booklet with behind-the-scenes photos and comments, mini-seri-cels (that resemble the animation cels although smaller and with each Beatle in one of the iconic moments from the film)of each of the four Beatles and stickers.  Audio Commentary by John Coates and additional contribution by Heinz Edelmann

Vintage featurette: The Mod Odyssey (7:40), we also get three storyboarded sequences - including two not used in the final film:* Sea of Monsters (4:21),Battle of the Monsters (Interactive), Pepperland (Interactive),Original pencil drawings (8:33), Behind-the-scenes photo gallery as well as interviews with crew and vocal talents: Paul Angelis (voice) (1:39), John Clive (voice) (2:04), David Livesey (key animation) - 1:13, Millicent MacMillan (1:14),  Jack Stokes (3:44), Eric Segal (1:38), Theatrical Trailer (3:45)

Plus:

16 page booklet, reproductions of animation cells of each of the four Beatles characters + stickers

Missing is the music only audio track that was on the previous DVD which is too bad but we do get the original mono soundtrack as well plus a stereo PCM mastered track.

This is a terrific reissue that is flawed only by missing the original music only track in 5.1 like the original DVD. It would also have been nice if the MTV Special (or was it VH1?) that was shown back in 1999 had been included or the BBC documentary but evidently Apple chose not to license either for this release. Even though it doesn't have everything it could have, this is highly recommended due to the stellar image and sound quality.

The old VHS & Laserdisc ""center-cut"" the picture, cropping off the sides to make a 1:33-1 frame.
Then the first ""restored"" DVD release (and also a second laserdisc release) chopped off the top & bottom slightly to present the film in 1:85-1 ratio.
Finally this Blu-ray presentation crops off nothing and gives us the full 1:66-1 ratio picture!

To see what we were missing in the past, just look at the 1:33-1 full frame bonus documentary ""Mod Odyssey"", the full frame clips show what has been missing on TV & video for many years.

The print was the best I have ever seen, and it is brand-new, not a reissue of the 1999 version.  The soundtrack was excellent as well; though some of The Beatles' songs had strange-sounding mixes, that was probably the fault of the theater sound system.  I am really looking forward to receiving the new DVD in June.  I will add to this review after I have a chance to watch the new DVD.  Stay tuned...

UPDATE:  I have now watched all of the new DVD, and the picture quality on the new version is much sharper and less grainy than the 1999 release; the soundtrack is much improved as well.  There are some differences between the two versions, which I will discuss now.

AUDIO OPTIONS:

1999: English 5.1 Surround (non-DTS); English Mono, 5.1 Surround (non-DTS) Music-Only Track (not on 2012 version, unfortunately).

2012: English Dolby Stereo, English Mono, English DTS 5.1 Surround, German 5.1 Surround (non-DTS), Italian 5.1 Surround (non-DTS).

The commentary track, featuring John Coates and Heinz Edelmann, is the same on both versions.

SUBTITLES:

1999: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese (Only English and French are listed on the packaging).

2012: English, German, Dutch, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, Polish (no Japanese - sorry, Yoko), and ""Hard-of-Hearing"" (HOH) English and German.  I wasn't sure what the difference was at first, but the HOH versions have parenthetical onscreen mentions of sound effects (e.g., (Laughter), (Giggling), (Explosion)), whereas the standard English and German subtitles do not.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Mod Odyssey"" Featurette - same content on both versions; transferred ""as is"" on the 1999 version, but newly restored on the 2012 version.

Original theatrical trailer - same content on both versions; transferred ""as is"" on the 1999 version, but newly restored on the 2012 version.  Also, the Apple Corps logo replaces the United Artists logo at the end of the trailer.

Interviews - same on both versions.

Storyboard sequences - appear to be the same content, but are presented in full-screen mode on the 1999 version, whereas they are in small boxes on the 2012 version.  For example, the ""Sea of Monsters"" storyboard sequence from 1999 has the storyboard sequence running at the top, with the film clip at the bottom.  On the 2012 edition, the two segments run side-by-side in little boxes, which are hard to see.

Pencil drawings: The 1999 version has 29 drawings, the 2012 version has only 26 (the three Hey Bulldog cels are missing). Has the same presentation problems as the storyboard sequence (full-size in 1999, smaller in 2012).

Behind-the-scenes photos - There are 30 full-screen photos in the 1999 version, but only 29 in the 2012 version. Once again, the 2012 photos are smaller.

Also, the 1999 version has a counter at the bottom center of the screen for the storyboards, photos, and pencil drawings.  The 2012 version does not, and it is very tedious to count them manually.

Booklet:  The 2012 booklet has a new essay by John Lasseter of Walt Disney Studios, and reproduces all of the mini-essays from the 1999 version.  The booklet also has more artwork.  The package also comes with four mini-cels of the cartoon John, Paul, George, and Ringo, a sticker sheet of both the individual and collective cartoon Beatles, a Blue Meanie, the Flying Glove (""It's not polite to point!""), Jeremy Hillary Boob, the LOVE logo, and the Yellow Submarine itself.  There is also a promotional flyer for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yellow-Submarine-Midi-Edition/dp/0763658545/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yellow Submarine: Midi Edition</a>&nbsp;picture book and the LOVE Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas (this is Apple, so what do you expect?).

Look for the 1999 version if you want the original non-DTS English 5.1 soundtrack, the ""music-only"" non-DTS 5.1 soundtrack, the Japanese subtitles, and a full-screen presentation of the storyboards, pencil drawings, and behind-the-scenes photos.  Otherwise, get the 2012 version.  Of course, serious Beatles collectors will want both versions, as well as the 1988 VHS (which has the original 1968 U.S. edit of the film without the ""Hey Bulldog"" sequence - the original U.K. film had ""Bulldog,"" at least in some early prints), if they don't already have them.",1336780800,5,4845,5.607142857142857

YUK!!!

And not only that, the 'restored' version has ""Hey Bulldog"" on it--talk about a momentum-breaker, a mood-breaker, and just totally wrong! Double yuk!!

I had been so thrilled about the release of Yellow Submarine ever since I saw the PROPERLY restored ""Help"", that when I finally saw Yellow Submarine, is was most displeased. I lost count of how many times I have watched the VHS version. I watched the horrible dvd version only once; it now continues to collect dust.

8512730,5,B0079J28NW,"Beautifully restored color, almost flawless sound mix, but what could one expect from 4-track session tapes of the musical selections?  Vocals aren't always mixed to the center channel, as they weren't always on isolated tracks on the 4-track masters, but what can you do?  The film was produced in 1968, but many of the songs were recorded prior to '68, and even the Beatles' final studio album, ""Abbey Road"" was recorded using the same 4-track equipment.  This Blu-ray disc is outstanding in spite of its sonic limitations due to the original music sources, and is a must in every collection.  The Blu-ray release turns the DVD into a coffee table coaster.",1525651200,,658,4.900900900900901
