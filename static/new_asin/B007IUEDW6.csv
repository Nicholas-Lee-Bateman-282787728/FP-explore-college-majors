8517846,5,B007IUEDW6,I use this in my psychology class when discussing DNA.,1520899200,,54,4.5
8517847,4,B007IUEDW6,"Fascinating and somewhat ominous look at a possible future when knowing our genomes will be a standard part of our medical history.  This film explores the considerable and troubling advantages and disadvantages of ""knowing"" our genetic predispositions.

My students viewed this in HS biology classes and it led to good discussions.  It was especially effective as background info prior to watching the movie Gattaca.  The NOVA film made GATTACA seem ahead of its time and enhanced its impact.",1491436800,,493,5.282051282051282
8517848,4,B007IUEDW6,"Informative and educational, as genetics applies to the medical profession.",1443312000,,75,6.6
8517849,5,B007IUEDW6,It was good and fast,1426636800,,20,3.2

8517851,5,B007IUEDW6,Great visuals and reinforces the curriculum.  Nova keeps up with the topics that we needs to teach effectively and grabs the attention of our students.,1397174400,4,151,5.04
8517852,5,B007IUEDW6,"I highly recommend this documentary, as a person with Huntington's Disease, which is a genetic neurological disease, I found this documentary to be really interesting, and I was especially pleased that it did cover Huntington's disease. Huntington's is often a disease left out of the media. If you're just a regular person interested in genetics/genetic testing you'll probably find this documentary a good view.",1354060800,6,413,5.46875
8517853,4,B007IUEDW6,I think this is a great video and show parts of it to my College genetics students every year. but perhaps it is getting a bit too dated. My TAs said that the students didn't seem very interested in it. They are certainly much more interested in the epigenetics nova video - i think its called a ghost in your genes,1352246400,14,315,4.180327868852459
