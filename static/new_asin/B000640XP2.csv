8038446,4,B000640XP2,"When people use the expression ""Its a small world"" when you meet someone and someone you know jsut happens to know that person too, it's completely true. Well, thats the case with this DVD. After fighting a harsh sea battle and damaging her plane, Cagalli crashes on an island in the middle of the Sea with no communication or supplies. Also stranded on that same island is Athrun Zala. After a long talk and a lot of fighting, Athrun and Cagalli finally start to understand each other even after meeting for the first time. But the funny thing is that they both don't find out that they both know Kira until later on. A small world indeed. This a DVD full of action, new types of warfare underwater and plenty of conflicts. And Kira and Cagalli's relationship gets better in this DVD too. And Kira's relationship with Flay may be at a close. This is an ok DVD overall, but the other volumes definatly are more in depth. But if you want to understand more about the story, if you want everthing to make sense and know how Athrun and Cagalli meet, this is the DVD to watch.",1116547200,,1072,4.41919191919192
8038447,5,B000640XP2,"After defeating the forces of the Desert Tiger, the Archangel heads out to sea. But it's not clear sailing from here. As any Gundam fan knows, travelling by sea means facing attack by amphibious mobile suits. In this case, it's ZAFT's bulky GOOhN and ZnO units that attack, with support from above by the aerial DINNs. But a greater threat looms on the horizon: all 4 stolen Gundams are now on Earth, preparing to resume their pursuit of the Archangel. But before that can happen, both Athrun's Aegis Gundam and Cagalli's Skygrasper fighter are shot down over a small uninhabited island, leaving them temporarily stranded together. And later, Cagalli's secret is finally revealed.",1100044800,3,680,5.0265486725663715
