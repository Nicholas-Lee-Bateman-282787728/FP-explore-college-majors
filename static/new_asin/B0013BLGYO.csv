Chris Seaver is a genius, albeit a mad one. Not many people can compare, and thankfully for our mortal souls, he's still doing what he does best  to this day!

8249729,1,B0013BLGYO,"I am a really big enthusiast of the b-movie, I am an avid collector, as well as a filmmaker. I have made Super Hell 1,2, and 3, as well as a few others in theme of abortion comedy, and sex with corpses..so, you see, there is nothing new about shock factor.. that is, unless you actually try, and it is clear that these guys do not try that hard. I used to see them at horror conventions, this one dude alway wore a bandana, around his flowing girl hair, and he was the among the most obnoxious, and genuinely dumbest teenagers one could have the pleasure of meeting. This group probably has fart contests, hits eachother in the head with bottles to see how bad it hurts...I could go on, this portrays well to the films. Yeah, I said it, films. It is all made of film, all recording material is made of film. Or, you can choose to just call it digital trash, whatever, I don't care. But I have been subjected to some of this stuff, and to this day, it makes me angry to think that I ever saw any of it. Although, I would happily watch this, and try my best to like it, opposed to any of the Twilight movies(also, avoid ANY movie with the name Bill Zebub on it). Hollywood does suck, but these films suck too, and two wrongs do not make a right. D.I.Y or die.",1353024000,,1257,4.155737704918033
8249730,4,B0013BLGYO,"Unlike a previous review, i bought this KNOWING what they are.  These are Spoofs on older movies by people who are just out to have fun Lampooning genre films.  Yes they are ultra-low budget and silly; done with the mentality of a Beavis and Butthead episode.  They spoof Lord of the Rings, Monster Squad, Kill Bill and so on... rather than blindly buying them, watch the Youtube prevues and get a feel for what these movies are.  I enjoyed all of them as Comedy/Spoof splatter films done super cheap and if you want more laughs, just listen to the commentaries after.",1328313600,2,568,4.594059405940594
8249731,1,B0013BLGYO,"Still in middle school?  Okay, then MAYBE this would be a good purchase... but only if you're taking remedial classes...

Otherwise, please listen to me and save your money.  These are bad.  They are not bad in a good way, either.  They are so amateurishly done that the producers seem to have had no interest at all in what the final product would look like.

There are some GREAT low-budget horror flicks out there like ZOMBIE HONEYMOON, SHATTER DEAD, FEEDING THE MASSES, BLACK SHEEP, FIDO, and STINK OF FLESH.  The problem with these films is NOT the low budget; it's the low expectations.",1210291200,2,592,4.689320388349515
