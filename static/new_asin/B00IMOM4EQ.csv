6281618,5,B00IMOM4EQ,"This is a wonderful series by the creator of Veggie Tales that gives kids (and adults) a more in-depth look at the Bible. We have learned so much here! The series is full of the same elements that made the Veggie Tales series so much fun -- silly songs, lovable characters and humor. We love the puppetry that is part of the Buck Denver (the little news announcer guy) What's in the Bible series, too. However, the best part  has been getting the historical information and scholarly perspective that makes Bible study more intellectual and relevant. This isn't just a ""be a good person"" and ""Jesus loves you"" kind of Biblical program. In these DVDs, older kids will learn about each book of the Bible in order but will also learn how the books are organized by scholars (i.e. the histories, the prophets, etc), the purpose of each book, the way the Old and New Testament are related and connected by these stories, how the Old and New Testament are different, key concepts (i.e. fullness of time, ritual law versus ethical law) and lots of important history (i.e. Who was King Cyrus? What happened between the OT and the NT? What role did the Roman Empire play?). Very informative! This series makes the Bible real and relevant in a way that no other series or book or Sunday School class that I have seen has. Tough questions are presented -- and answered! I love it and highly recommend it to anyone of any age who wants to know more about the Bible and the Christian faith. Excellent!",1482710400,3,1488,4.573033707865169

6281629,5,B00IMOM4EQ,"I bought a set of ""What's In The Bible"" some time ago to use with children at church.  But because of some changes, I never had the chance.  Several months ago I gave the whole set to my daughter for my grandsons, ages 10, 6, and 3.  The older boys love the series.  They watch it while eating breakfast every morning.  They have their favorite characters and favorite situations.  My daughter liked it so well that she wanted to gift a set to her friend's children.  So the set I have recently purchased is the second one I have bought.  This series is based on the books for adult students of the Bible, such as Henrietta Mears' classic, ""What The Bible Is All About""  There are about 25 episodes at 25 minutes each.  It is a broad overview of the whole Bible but done in a way small children will enjoy and understand.  Very good.  I recommend.",1461542400,3,847,4.32484076433121
6281630,5,B00IMOM4EQ,"After one watching Vol 2 for the first time I asked my 6yr old son what he learned to which he replied ""Putting yourself before your marriage is like breaking your marriage, just like putting yourself before God is breaking our relationship with God....and that's not good."" He then called me out a little later in the day when I kind of put my wishes before my wife's and said ""Dad, do you want to break your marriage?"" WOW!! I can't wait to see what else he learns. I know they play clips from some of these DVD's at our church for the school age kids and my 6yr old loves them. My 4yr old is just watching them for the first time and she seems to love them too.",1460332800,2,664,4.115384615384615
6281631,5,B00IMOM4EQ,"We absolutely love this series!  I got it as something educational and entertaining for my kids to dive into Bible study.  It is jammed packed with information of all the books in the bible and the histories and it's downright hilarious at times; my husband and I absolutely love watching with this our kids.  I adore how it handles more difficult topics, even the crucifixion is done with reverence.  An incredible series!",1459814400,,423,4.833333333333333
6281632,5,B00IMOM4EQ,Not just for kids - this well done and fundamentally sound walk through the entire Bible both educates and entertains.,1459555200,,118,4.95

6281634,5,B00IMOM4EQ,"Love this series.  Adults need it, too.  Seriously considering using it to answer Stoa apologetics questions for speech and debate club.  Of my six kids ages 4 to 14, my 14 year old is fixated.  The others enjoy it, too, and are apprehending through songs and stories, if not yet fully comprehending.",1458518400,2,300,4.711538461538462

6281638,5,B00IMOM4EQ,"This statement from Mr. Phil Vischer and his team ultimately helped me decide to buy the series:

""Our theological frame of reference for 'What's in the Bible?' could be described as 'centrist Evangelical.' We rely heavily on thoroughly vetted reference works like the NIV Study Bible, the ESV Study Bible and Eerdman's International Standard Bible Dictionary. We also have an extensive group of scholars who review each script. When Scripture is quoted within an episode, we use the ESV version.""

I found that that claim to be true throughout the volumes I've watched with my wife and kids. The show is also witty and has high production values (the songs are brilliant and catchy--even for toddlers!)",1456185600,,703,5.051724137931035
6281639,5,B00IMOM4EQ,"Sheer genius. Not just for kids. Every home should own the entire set. Going to get a set for my grandkids as well. So entertaining I know they'll watch them repeatedly. No better way to learn Biblical truths. But watch out adults, you think you already know your Bible? You will learn as well!",1455148800,,294,4.462962962962963

6281643,5,B00IMOM4EQ,"Awesome video series.  We've been doing these as a Sunday night bible study with our 4 and 6 year olds.  They absolutely love them.

It's 95% cut and dry historical (at least so far), without much talk about denominational doctrine.  We did find some errant references to decisional regeneration, which we just take the time to explain to our children the effects of God's sovereignty in regards to our salvation.",1453248000,,413,4.857142857142857
6281644,5,B00IMOM4EQ,"Great series. What's in The Bible truly simplifies the core questions that every Christian needs to know. It is great for kids but amazing for adults as well. Since it is geared towards children, hard questions such as ""What is sin?"" or ""Why do we follow certain laws from the Old Testament and not others?"" have simplified answers that get straight to the point. It is great for all ages.",1452816000,,389,4.571428571428571

6281648,5,B00IMOM4EQ,Our 7-year old grandson absolutely loves these DVDs. They hold his attention while instilling wonderful Bible teachings that he is able to relay back to us in his own words. I've been just giving him one disc to watch at a time. He watches them through twice then asks for the next one. He loves them! These are wonderful tools to educate children & adults alike!  I definitely recommend these DVDs.,1450310400,,399,4.619718309859155

6281653,5,B00IMOM4EQ,"As a mom who is new to homeschooling this year, I have leaned heavily on these DVDs during Bible time.  What an enormous blessing!  I am so grateful to Phil Vischer and the gang.  What a joy to hear my boys (aged 7 and 9) laughing and having fun as they learn God's awesome word!  Coolest thing ever:  We were memorizing the books of the Old Testament in order and we had gotten through to Song of Songs and I was a bit intimidated by the major and minor prophet books.  Do you know that just then, we received the DVD where Sunday School Lady raps ""Isaiah, Jeremiah, then Lamentations... Ezekiel, Daniel, without hesitation comes Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah... and so on?!!!!  What perfect timing from God!  That got us through the daunting task of memorizing the last several books of the Old Testament!  Such a huge blessing!  Thank you so much for the time and energy to put this together!  I plan to buy the whole collection and watch it over and over with my boys.  It's so amazing not just for kids but for adults! Though I've been a Christian for years, the Bible can be very overwhelming and sometimes, it's hard to know where to start.  This series fills in so many gaps and makes me want to read the Bible to find out more and dig deeper!  I attended a Theology class at my church where they talked about the different types of books in the Bible (The Pentateuch, the Gospels, etc) but it was difficult to remember.  Watching these, I got the gist really quickly.  These videos also address some of the tougher stories like David and Bathsheba in a way that is geared for kids but gets the message across.  I love the cartoon sketch of David ""stealing"" Uriah's wife, throwing her over his shoulder and running away with her.  And the Star Wars references had my boys rolling!  It's the best series out there, in my humble opinion.  You can buy these and share them with friends who know the Lord and those who don't!  That's what I'm planning to do.  To watch these is to increase your knowledge of the Bible and to be blessed immensely.  I feel like this is something I've been waiting for for years and I didn't even realize it until it came to my door.  Thank you!",1448236800,,2177,4.385

6281656,5,B00IMOM4EQ,We love these. Our plan for this purchase is to incorporate parts of the videos in children's church lessons as we go through the Old and New Testament. Accurate and engaging.,1445126400,,175,4.67741935483871
6281657,5,B00IMOM4EQ,"I got this DVD set for my 7 year-old Goddaughter and she absolutely loves it.  She is eating it up and can't get enough of it.  I'm so impressed by how easy it is for kids to understand and I can't wait to share it with my now 2 1/2 year-old nephew.

I gave the set to my sister as a present for her kids, and am also buying the digital versions so my niece and I can watch it on my iPad (or iPhone).

We also frequently pause it (on our iPad) so I can either answer her quesitons, or so I can further explain (expanding on it) or give real-life examples of what she is watching.

Great job!  I highly recommend these, in either DVD or digital form.  They are funny, educational, informative, and factual.  The characters are wonderful.  She has many favorites. : )

Keep in mind, she is being raised Christian, but hasn't gone to Church regularly (that is happening in the next year - her brother has been a handful).  So the fact she's so into this is very encouraging.  Praise God for this series! : )",1444953600,,1004,4.171875

We have had great discussions about the movies, characters, information shared, etc. It has been a great learning tool. I am so grateful that Phil Vischer realized kids are often left with little to know sound Biblical information and then he (with an amazing team) did something about it. Goodness, the first DVD talks about canonization and the Pentateuch!! Hello!

I can barely keep up and understand what they are saying and talking about, I can't imagine a little one 5,6,7 years old catching anything they are singing/talking about.  Not all of it is this way, but seems to me, the good ""stories"" are presented in this fashion.  I do look forward to the remainder of the DVD's.",1431561600,,444,4.188235294117647

Bringing children closer to God and showing them that not only is God holy but also approachable is hard to do. Phil does a great job through puppets and respectful humor that God is someone you want as your friend.  I've read some reviews here and on other sites that criticize this series as not being serious enough because anything to do with God must be serious.  But God created humor and there is nothing wrong with laughter. So buy the series and show it to your kids.  This series is highly educational and will teach them among other wonderful things that ""fearing"" God by respecting Him doesn't mean they should be ""afraid"" of God.  By that I mean, worshipping God because one is ""afraid"" of Him is not a loving act as that would be a forced form of worship, therefore, since ""God is love"" worshipping God out of fear goes against the nature of God as love is a choice which is His greatest gift to mankind.  Instead this series, reminds that God is their best friend and wants everybody to be His even though they are fallible.  So laugh and learn in a positive respectful way that ""God is good and His love endures forever"" and that God has a ""rescue plan"" for you as well.",1428883200,,1275,4.423076923076923

It shows the people in the Bible as real people in need of a savior just like us. David's sins of adultry and murder are NOT overlooked, for example. Instead it is one example of how even King David had to repent, and needed Jesus.
My goal is not for my child to just do good things all the time, I want hiM to have a heart that craves a relationship to the One who made him, loves him, and sent His Son to die for Him.

Terms like grace and justification are defined,  church history presented by, who else, a law-abiding pirate,  and some basic apologetics are introduced. Four stars because I wish they'd left out some gross jokes and references to pop culture as well as for some of the voices that are grating. But on the whole the series has been a great resource for our minivan trips and all of us have learned a lot. Think ""The Muppet Show"" meets seminary.",1422662400,,679,4.504065040650406

6281729,5,B00IMOM4EQ,"So far this whole series has been amazing! We've only seen the first 6 volumes of the 13, and also the ""Why Do We Call It Christmas"" video, but what we have seen has been incredibly well done and informative. It is very entertaining, and more importantly it takes concepts often thought of as difficult and makes them understandable. It addresses most, if not all, of the questions that are typically raised both about the contents of the Bible and the validity of the Bible, including who wrote it and how the books were chosen.

My children are very eager to continue watching and have begged each day since we've owned them to see the next episode (there are 2 per Volume), and I've always been eager to watch it with them. It's just so good!!

One thing to note: The downloads at the publisher's website are cheaper than the physical DVDs, but do not include the extras. After purchasing one of the downloads and 2 of the DVDs, we decided the bonus features were worth the extra money and bought all of the DVDs, including the one we had already downloaded (Vol 3). Glad we did!

6281747,5,B00IMOM4EQ,"""I need the calming salve of humorous puppets wielding the Word of God"" says Michael, king of the mini-van, at the start of Episode 2 on Volume #7.

Well said.

What do you get when you've got a hat-wearing boy named Michael ""king of the mini-van"" who sounds a bit like a Monty Python character, a blue-haired Sunday School Lady, a pirate, two brothers from Britain who wear pith helmets, a cowboy, a newsman, many other puppet characters, and add in an occasional reference to ""Star Wars,"" and put them all together with the biggest-selling book in history?

You get ""What's in the Bible?"" the new series from the creator of VeggieTales, Phil Vischer. VeggieTales is a highly successful direct-to-video children's series, because of its valuable good messages and fun. Its humor and references to popular culture have also made it a hit among adults.

Vischer lost his VeggieTales company, and tells about that experience in his book ""Me, Myself, and Bob: A True Story About God, Dreams, and Talking Vegetables."" He still does the voices of many characters and writes one episode a year, but has been freed from the vegetables now to create other projects.

He chose the Bible to work on, creating an entirely new set of characters, and with the help of a small team of animators and others, in 13 disks he covers Genesis to Revelation, creating an overview of the whole Bible in about 13 hours.

It's a grand adventure.

I own the entire series and have watched each DVD at least three times.

It helps connect all 66 books of the Bible. It defines terms, ranging from ""Pentateuch"" to ""grace."" It uses cartoons, puppets, clever brief songs, humor--and questions.

Questions are allowed. Questions like, why all the killing in the Bible? Can science show the resurrection could not have happened? What is science? If the Bible sometimes spells the same word differently, how can we trust the Bible to be true? If God knew the Hebrews would fail in following Him, why did He allow them to try? Why didn't He just go straight to the Messiah?

It covers history, occasionally making mention of the Jewish historian Josephus or other surrounding materials, just like any commentary.

""What's in the Bible?"" is at its essence, a brief video dialogue that engages viewers with the Bible through using puppets and fun, yet without talking down to viewers. It is like an animated commentary, full of riches.

It does an excellent job of reviewing material throughout, so if a viewer begins with DVD #8, for example, they still can watch without starting out lost.

It's like a fun college ""Christianity and the Bible Theology 101"" course, but more effective than most classes I've been in, and yet relevant to any age. It is fast-paced, and there is much to gain from each video, so they can be watched again and again, while still learning new things.

Each volume has two 25-minute episodes, and ""Show Outtakes,"" and most have more than one other bonus feature.

If you're looking for a fast way to have fun learning about the Bible, here is a video series worth watching. Inspiring, it also deals throughout with questions about faith and how to apply and use this material in living the Christian life.

I encourage atheists to get this, if only to become more literate about what they are arguing against. Those who have read the Bible all the way through, can also learn from these. On Volume 7 there is a bonus feature with some children who won a contest telling what they like about this series. One young child who walks but barely is able to talk yet, wakes up and asks for it. It is for all ages.

As the ""Show Outtakes"" let us see, Phil Vischer, who does all the puppets himself, besides writing the scripts, films each puppet separately on a green background. Expert editing and background animation are added to each puppet's performance so it appears they are engaged with each other. The result is personable puppetry combined with well-organized teaching that squarely hits the mark.

I recommend this series for anyone and everyone and for all libraries. It is not a substitute for reading and studying the Bible, but it is a wonderful way to have better understanding with an enjoyable overview of the whole.

6281753,4,B00IMOM4EQ,"I really enjoy this series.

Both my kids and I like how fun this is to watch. It is a little fast paced, skipping from character to character a little too much (hence the 4 stars), but I guess that is better than it being too slow. The songs are fun and the characters original (no Veggie Tales here) telling the story of scripture in a fun yet real way. I was impressed that the ugliness of sin is not watered down showing our need for a savior.

I am learning so much as I watch it along side my kids, and that is saying a lot, I have been in church my whole life and have read the bible through. Phil did a great job of presenting the facts in a fun way often explaining things in ways I had never thought of before. I have recommended this series to my own non denominational church and my in-laws Catholic church as it cuts right through man's differences and gets down to what God has revealed to us through His word -- Every church NEEDS this!

I highly recommend What's in the Bible - Oh, and you'll also love 'The Bentley Brothers'.",1416787200,7,1042,4.148514851485149
6281754,4,B00IMOM4EQ,"This series is SO well made.  Great production value and very true to the scriptures.  My only surprise was my perception of who the target audience was and who it should be.  I thought the intended audience was young kids.  But of the videos I've seen so far I believe the real target audience is actually Jr. and Sr. Highs.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Jr. and Sr. Highs need good quality video Bible lessons too!  (By the way, adults will love this too, either as a refresher course or as new if not basic Bible information.)  My only disappointment with the series (and the reason for only 4 stars) is the songs that are used to repeat the teachings by using a different teaching method.  Maybe I'm just not a ""teaching song"" kind of guy but they seemed TOO redundant and not a little mundane to me.  But it's simple enough to fast forward through them, or to use the songs independent of the teachings.",1416528000,2,913,4.445783132530121

6281759,5,B00IMOM4EQ,"Great Biblical teaching. Fun and engaging for both kids and adults. Phil does a great job of teaching younger ones some harder to understand areas of the bible, like the Wheel of Apostasy.",1413072000,,188,4.7272727272727275

6281763,5,B00IMOM4EQ,"Entertaining for young elementary age. We've only watched 3 so far but kids have loved them and retained quite a bit of information, which is great. Not annoying to listen to either like some kids' videos.",1411171200,7,205,4.722222222222222

8643386,3,B00IMOM4EQ,"I purchased this to help teach the main topics in the Bible to my young children in a fun and exciting way.  The reviews are usually really good, however, I think that for more traditional folks (like me and my family), this set of DVDs didn't live up to my expectations.  The substance is definitely there - Kudos for Phil Vischer for putting lots of time and effort into getting all the Biblical material in this production...but for me and my family, the presentation was too much like ""spong-bob square pants"" (which has been proven to change focus every 11 seconds and inhibit children from concentrating for any length of time).  The presentation style and format is somewhat cute and clever at times, but mostly, it is fast-paced, hard to follow, erratic, and down right annoying puppet show, using annoying voices and off-subject dramatic ""clutter"" to interfere with teaching a compilation of accurate stories and historical events in the Christian Bible.  My kids (ages 3-8) got bored quickly and were oftentimes doing something else while it was on in the back ground.  Instead of a strait forward educational presentation (like a play or story)...it jumped around to a variety of topics and reminded me of the really erratic and stupid ""sponge-bob"" cartoons...almost like an ""ADHD"" Bible presentation (no disrespect to those with this condition).",1515024000,3,1357,5.040178571428571
8643387,5,B00IMOM4EQ,My lil toddler was watching this in his Sunday school class & he loved it. So I searched for the conplete series & found this. I love that mr Phil V. Created this awesome gem. It helps children & adults of all ages learn about the Bible. Its very entertaining & well put together. I am so happy my boys love this cause its a huge hit in my home.

8643393,5,B00IMOM4EQ,"I am writing my first review ever to support this venture! The What's In The Bible series has been a huge blessing in our family! My children will literally finish one volume and beg for the next video in the series. The videos have a nice combination of puppetry, cartoon, real people (adults and kids), songs, and content (similar to Sesame Street--a tried and true method for pleasing kids)! I am so happy to be able to start presenting this type of information to my kids at a young age. If you need the help of the TV every now and then in your home, like I do (or every day--no judging!), why not put this on instead of all of the nonsense we fill our kids' heads up with, or at least in addition to it? I feel GREAT about putting the TV on for my children now that I have this tool in my toolbox. It not only goes through the stories of the Bible, but addresses many questions that teens and young adults struggle with (in a tremendously kid-friendly way)! I admire that Phil Vischer created this series in response to the dramatic rate at which children in Christian families are walking away from the church. Sometimes it is hard to know what our kids are really thinking, and it is wise to be proactive and cover all of your bases at home (or at least as many as possible), especially with all of the things they are learning in school.",1490659200,,1346,4.303149606299213
