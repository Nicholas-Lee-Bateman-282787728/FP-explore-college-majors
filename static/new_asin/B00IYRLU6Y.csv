6305424,4,B00IYRLU6Y,"A vast jungle with an ""invisible"" crater swallows up a downed plane.  Flash-forward to a few years later and a failed commando mission, resulting in a downed chopper in the same invisible crater...............filled with hungry dinosaurs befriended by a survivor from the earlier crash.  The new objective: stay alive, keep from being eaten, and escape from the invisible crater with the hostage (more or less in one piece).
And safe on the sideline, well out of harm's way, is Corin Nemec yelling at Vernon Wells.  (An unnecessary plot ploy.)

The film offers the usual gunplay, crashes, dinosaurs picking off the cast in ones and twos, gung-ho macho posturing, and little in the way of acting (stock characters doing what's expected).  I bought it for the dinosaurs and in that regard I wasn't disappointed.  But it's pretty uninspired.  I liked it enough to keep it for future viewings.  But I recognize it for what it is, dreck.  (But I happen to have a fine appreciation for bad movies.)",1407542400,9,992,4.892215568862276

6305428,3,B00IYRLU6Y,"This is also marketed under the title ""Jurassic Attack."" In our opening scene a plane goes down in the land of the dinosaurs. We then jump five years later as a team of military men are on a rescue mission. Their goal is to save a kidnapped chemical-biologist from terrorists in the fictional country of Verdi in the Amazon basin. The bad guys have developed a new chemical or biological agent that can be launched in a rocket.

That mission would take The Expendables 2 hours to complete, but ours does it in under ten minutes, and unfortunately a bit sloppy as their CG helicopter gets shot down by a CG RPG only to land where they will be hunted by CG raptors and a CG T-Rex. In addition to having to find their way out of the jungle, they have with them the terrorist leader and meet a professor who is studying the dinosaurs. He would rather see them dead too. Meanwhile back at headquarters two very bad actors are arguing over the next step of the mission.

The dinosaurs, helicopter, gun fire, flames were all Asylum grade CG, if that good. The acting was hit and miss, with it mostly being a miss. Alicia Ziegler and Natascha Berg provide the token eye candy.

Looked like more of a kids movie if they can get the rating down to PG-13.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Rated ""R"" for man eating dinosaurs. Minor language such as ""being a d***.""",1394668800,8,1364,4.422310756972111

6305434,1,B00IYRLU6Y,"If only...

This film is alternately titled, ""Jurassic Attack!"" or, ""Rise of the Dinosaurs.""  That should be our first clue - neither title is accurate.  Of the four - count 'em, four - types of badly animated CG dinos depicted, only one - an indeterminate sauropod, probably Brontosaurus/Apatosaurus - can be called Jurassic.  The main ones - Triceratops, T. rex, and oversized, featherless ""velociraptors"" (without killing claws on their feet) are all Cretaceous types.  And the Jurassic sauropods don't attack.

As for ""Rise of the Dinosaurs,"" the only time they could be called ""rising"" is toward the end, when they chase our ""heroes"" up a hill.

So, what do we have?  A team of American ""expert special forces"" (with mostly oddly British accents) who are flown into South America as dinosaur lunch - I mean, to rescue a female biochemist from an evil dictator (whose country seems to consist of about 30 guys talented mainly at falling down and dying).  The dictator, Marquez, has apparently forced her to create a biochemical weapon of unspecified nature (because of course all biochemists know how to do that) and he's put it in a missile and intends to do Bad Things with it.

Incidentally, they're introduced as a ""HALO team,"" to parachute in.  But to military parachute teams, HALO means ""high altitude, low opening,"" - you jump from too high to observe, fall a long way, fast, and open your chute at low altitude to minimize observability by the enemy.  It's usually done at night, ideally with no moon.  In a bold defiance of doctrine, this HALO team jumps in daylight, above the enemy compound, and links up during the drop like sport skydivers.  Then they open their chutes early, perhaps to try to give the enemy a fair chance of spotting them.

The enemy, of course, doesn't see them, and the soldiers make short work of a heavily armed defending force about five times their number, killing almost all the bad guys (without a single casualty) by jiggling their guns while sound and muzzle flashes are added in postproduction.  The lack of flying shells, smoke, and even reciprocating bolts is impressive - but it does explain why 30-round magazines can sustain full-auto fire for so long.

Incidentally, NOBODY on either side of the fight seems to have the first inkling of combat tactics, including fundamentals like, ""Use available cover - get behind a tree.""  Instead they simply step forward to look heroically stupid, and shoot.  The bad guys die (bloodlessly); the good guys are miraculously unscathed.

For now.  But wait!

When they bring out the female biochemist and Bad Guy Marquez (who's wearing disposable handcuffs so loosely it's surprising he even waits to slip out of them!), bad things start happening.  Any time one of the group loses sight of the others, he's attacked and eaten by ""raptors"".  The 3D dino meshes aren't terrible (for 20 years ago), but the animation is appallingly bad.  None of the dinos cast shadows, leave footprints, or visibly brush trees or grass.  Their movements are unconvincing and spastic.  When a T. rex eats anything or anybody, its victim immediately disintegrates into a gout of blood, most of which falls toward the ground but never gets there.  No meat.  No bones.  Just blood, badly animated.

Along the way they meet a kinda wacko professor, survivor of an earlier crash, who has managed not to get eaten.  He's as badly acted as the main squad (but not as bad as the subplot back at Command, in Panama, where two badly acted officials attempt to beat each other into submission with cliches).

The helicopters are CGI.  The dinos are CGI.  The fires are badly chroma keyed.  The weapons effects are CGI.  And our team of elite operators?  When attacked by dinos, do they shoot them with their elite weapons skills?  Nah.  Do the fight back with knives, pointed sticks, or elite unarmed combat skills?  Nah.  Usually they lie down and whimper, and get eaten.

There's a feeble attempt at an environmental message, in that the two scientists (the wacky professor and the biochemist) both talk about how rare and special these animals and this ecosystem are, and how they should be protected and studied.  But at the end (SPOILER ALERT!! Stop reading here if you don't want the spoiler!), our hero the surviving team leader (Gary Stretch!  What? You haven't heard of him?) - being safely evac'ed by another CGI helicopter, and therefore completely out of danger - disregards all this and blows up a T. rex with an RPG.

Moral?  There is none.  Cool guys are amoral, I guess.

Rating:  Stinkosaurus.  I'd give it zero stars if I could.  I kept hoping they'd get something right, but they never did.",1465084800,,4668,4.829545454545454
