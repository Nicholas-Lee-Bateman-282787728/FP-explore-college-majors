8590380,5,B00D7ECL0S,"This was and EXCELLENT DVD.  Mr. Evans is an excellent teacher.  Yes, some of these tunes may be too advanced for a beginner, however that should not stop a beginner from getting this DVD and working with it.  There are basic rolls taught and the tablature provided as a .pdf on the DVD is excellent and easy to follow.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to play bluegrass banjo.  I would also highly recommend an aspiring banjo player acquire the ""Earl Scruggs and the 5-string Banjo book"" with CD by Earl Scruggs.  That is the essential building block.",1473897600,,574,4.578431372549019
8590381,1,B00D7ECL0S,HE GOES OVER THE ROLLS IN THE BEGINNING BUT AFTER THAT YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN HE SAYS PLAYED THRU SLOW BUT DOES NOT TELL YOU THE ROLLS THEN WE PLAY IT MODERATE THEN FAST.  THAT IS IT WITH EVERY SONG NOT FOR BEGINNERS,1464825600,,213,3.840909090909091
