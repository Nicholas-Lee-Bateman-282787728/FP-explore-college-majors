2202372,5,B000772838,"This is an enjoyable collection of an early Sci-Fi Tv production.  It is a region 2 DVD, but there are DVD players which play all regions, out there.  I got mine through Amazon.",1374710400,,177,4.333333333333333
2202373,3,B000772838,I re-iterate on the heading. The action scenes are old and corny but I do like sic-fi. A more modern reproduction would be enjoyed.,1368144000,,131,4.5
2202374,4,B000772838,"First let me point out that these are region 2 DVDs, which will only work on an all-region DVD player or a region 2 DVD player. Most DVD players in the United States are region 1. But if you have a player capable of playing region 2 DVDs, and you are a fan of early sci-fi/horror, then this DVD set may be for you.

During the 1950s, BBC television came out with three thrilling serials written by Nigel Kneale. They were about a British rocket scientist named Professor Quatermass who always seemed to come up against some kind of alien menace that threatened the Earth. This set includes all three television serials - well as close as you can get really considering only the first two episodes of ""The Quatermass Experiment"" still exist. The other four are missing. But this set does include the two existing episodes as well as the complete adventures of ""Quatermass II"" and ""Quatermass and the Pit"". And for the complete story of ""The Quatermass Experiment"" look for the book or maybe the 1955 movie remake ""The Quatermass Xperiment (AKA: The Creeping Unknown)"". These old episodes were very well produced with some great stories and great acting that were exciting and scary!

Highly recommended!",1368057600,15,1202,4.774038461538462
2202375,5,B000772838,"I had read the books so when the TV productions were released on a DVD I had to have it.  What a pity that most episodes of the first play have been lost.  Three quite different science-fiction thrillers which stand the test of time very well.  Quatermass and the Pit might be considered by some as fantasy but I think that perhaps it is the best of them (and I liked the Goons' version too).  For possible purchasers:  The Q E - manned rocket returns to Earth long after it should have, with two of the three cew apparently missing.  Q II - sinister happenings occur in the vicinity of an isolated, supposedly innocent research station.  Q and the P - a deep ecavation in London reveals what might be a bomb from WW II, but a prehistoric skull has been found above it;  weird occurrences begin and culminate in a rather frightening climax.",1237939200,9,840,4.409090909090909
2202376,5,B000772838,"Although I have not seen the first Quatermass serial (Q experiment), Quatermass II is available free at Archive.org for download and burn onto
disc.  The third serial (Q and the Pit) will be available for public domain
next year.
  So, in the meantime, since the Doctor Who series has been available in America for many years; why not release this trilogy for us ""Yanks"" to enjoy?",1236470400,10,380,4.7272727272727275
2202377,5,B000772838,"Before the good Doctor, there was...

Professor Bernard Quatermass.

I had only seen Quatermass 2, and those were from very poor VHS prints copied onto DVD. However, I found it to be a facinating slice of BBC Tv / Science Fiction history, so when I finally wqs able to glomp onto a multi region DVD player, I decided to invest in this box set.

I really can't add more to what people over at Amazon UK have said about this item, so I won't even try. However, I will say Shame on you, BBC Enterprises, for not making this set not publicly available to us here over on this side of the pond.",1209686400,6,589,4.1946902654867255
2202387,5,B000772838,"Excellent product, rapidly delivered.
The booklet that comes with it is the most thorough write up
(47 pages) of a movie or series I've ever seen and covers
everything you'd want to know.",1429833600,,187,4.696969696969697
2202388,2,B000772838,Was alittle diappointed on the quality of the product...I've downloaded versions of this that is available on a video archive free download site and is pretty much the same 4-6 on a 10 scale quality and those are FREE!!! I really seeing BBC dropping the ball on this....they have the technology to ditially remaster these claccis TV roto scope masters and yet they didn't!!! VERY Disappointed!!!,1429660800,,395,5.0
2202389,5,B000772838,It seems to be clearly stated in the product described that this is not compatible with Region One dvd players. A worthy investment on my part was a region free Bluray player. I purchase many Region 2 and region B discs. Too impatient to wait for a USA release. This is a well-written and acted television series. In spite of the fact that the first series has just the first two parts. Genuinely atmospheric and creepy. Viewers will not be disappointed. Only drawback is the edges of the film seem blurry at times...almost Kino scope in quality....but a minor point. Very enjoyable.,1424736000,3,583,4.7254901960784315
2202390,5,B000772838,awesome collection,1424649600,,18,8.5
2202391,4,B000772838,It would have been nice to be told that the last half of the first movie of the trilogy didn't exist,1421193600,,100,3.8095238095238093
2202392,4,B000772838,"First thing first. The Quatermass Experiment only has the first 2 of the 6 episode series. The rest of the DVD for The Quatermass Experiment are special features, interviews, etc.  Why only the first 2 episodes? They were the only 2 that were actually recorded, the remaining 4 were not archived in any visual way at all, as the process was quite expensive at the time, and did not look all that good in the first place. If you want to see the first story, you can get the BBC 2004 live broadcast remake, or the Hammer Film version ""The Quatermass Xperiment"", although both are shorter version of the origional script.
As noted elsewhere, these are all Region 2 DVD's, so be aware of that issue.
The other 2 serials are presented in their full length, and have been cleaned up rather well for this DVD release. Quatermass II still looks a bit rough, and Quatermass and the Pit looks and sounds quite good, all in all.",1421193600,4,917,4.491017964071856

2202394,5,B000772838,"Years before Americans found Star Trek, the British were enjoying great science fiction on television. The Quatermass stories were powerful examples of what could be done with the media, even with limited special effects. I am particularly fond of Quatermass and the Pit. The problem though, is the DVD format. The British format does not work on U. S. players, but sometimes works with computers. If you can get these stories to play, I think you'll discover a missing part of science fiction history and enjoy it.",1415059200,,515,4.931034482758621
2202395,1,B000772838,"I gave this item one star because I could not give it ""zero"" stars.  I was unable to watch the films because they were formatted for the UK and Australia.  I know one film of the trilogy, ""5 million years to earth,"" from the Saturday horror movies.  It is a sci fi/horror classic and i would love to have it, but it is not offered for the US market.",1387152000,,349,4.028985507246377
2202396,5,B000772838,"As a brit living in Pennsylvania for ten years, I thought it would be helpful to tell my American fellows something that you may well not know. GOOD NEWS!

ALL FORIEGN DVD'S (WRONG REGION FOR USA) WILL PLAY PERFECTLY ON YOUR HOME PC.

ALL PC DVD PLAYERS ARE MULTI REGION AS THEY ARE SOLD GLOBALLY, AND THEREFORE NEED TO BE.

All my old DVD's from back home work on my home computers and have done ever since I moved here. I suppose I discovered this accidentally many years ago and now we watch most things on a larger screen anyway.

In my opinion, It would hardly be worth watching this classic movie on a huge screen, or buying a Blue-Ray version, simply because the original was such a low quality grain to start with. Smaller is sometimes sharper.

Hope this helps someone.

THE QUATERMASS EXPERINENT is a 6-part serial but **ONLY THE FIRST 2 EPISODES ARE INCLUDED**. The other 4, LOST EPISODES, ARE ONLY IN SCRIPT FORM as a special feature.
