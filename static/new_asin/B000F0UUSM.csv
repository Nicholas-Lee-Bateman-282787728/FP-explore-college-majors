2547951,5,B000F0UUSM,"This film is the most inspiring film I have seen to date, a film from the perspective of (Profoundly Deaf) Evelyn Glennie the film explores sound. The film deftly tosses aside the assumption that deaf people cannot make exquistively beautiful music. This is especially inspiring for me because I myself am profoundly deaf, and I too have a deep love of music. People have been telling me all my life of the things that I cant do because of my disability. Here's Evelyn Glennie proving them wrong! Experience sound in a new dimension, not by listening but by feeling, touching, and in the case of this film, seeing as well.",1145923200,8,622,4.663636363636364

2547980,5,B000F0UUSM,A dvd of wonderful sight and sound.  Evelyn finds great and interesting sounds from everything that surrounds her.  A must have dvd for those interested in today's contemporary music.  Recomended for all musicians and film makers alike.,1260835200,,236,5.324324324324325
2547981,4,B000F0UUSM,"A beautifully filmed montage of various settings in which sound and music play important roles.  Our guide is the ever playful and ever competent percussionist Evelyn Glennie.  Segments of this film can be shown to open the world of different  musics to students who have limited exposure to music other than that of the pop culture. Glennie relishes in hearing and in creating every conceivable kind of sound.  Interspersed in the montage of sounds are bits of her life's story.  Her deafness seems to have made her more sensitive to the wide range of rhythms, timbers, genres, cultures of the world of music and sound.  The pace is meditative, reflective, with beautiful images to complement the sounds heard on the film.  When shown in short clips, the film can be effective learning impetus for those who want to expand their repertoire of known and loved musical styles.  There is much to contemplate and savor in ""Touch the Sound"".",1252800000,2,937,4.886075949367089
2547982,2,B000F0UUSM,"1.  If you're a PBS type of person, who prides oneself on learning more than entertainment, this film may be of interest.  And... it was of interest to me because of the subject matter and due to my interest in music, especially percussion, I thought this would be an excellent documentary.  While the subject of this film may be very worthwhile, the actual film itself... well, basically it'll bore most humans to death.  The only thing that'll wake them up is the jam session on top of the roof in NYC.

2.  Bottomline:  If you pride yourself on being a sophisticated intellect--> you may enjoy this film.  If you're an ordinary person wanting at least 30% entertainment out of a documentary film, then save your time and money by skipping this film.",1252368000,,752,4.643939393939394
2547983,5,B000F0UUSM,"This DVD was simply awesome. Evelyn Glennie is incredible and the way she describes sound is throughout stimulating and interesting. I wasn't bored for a minute and being a musician made it all the more fascinating. It might be hard to follow for younger folks, but for those who are well educated and are interested by the question ""What IS sound?"" then this DVD is for you.",1241395200,,375,4.611940298507463
2547994,5,B000F0UUSM,"When I realized I had seen this documentary before, I thought I'd switch if off when familiarity made me lose interest. It didn't, and I watched the entire film, as absorbed as I was the first time. While it's true that the filmmakers' objective is more about opening all one's senses, particularly to visual and aural rhythms, the film also offers a wonderful introduction to the world of musician Evelyn Glennie, who somehow produces mesmerizing, sometimes haunting music on percussion instruments though she is profoundly deaf.

The film finds her in many different parts of the world, from Cologne in Germany to New York and Japan, with stopovers at her home in Aberdeenshire. She performs with a variety of other drummers and musicians, and though it is not a concert film, we get a sampling of a wide range of musical styles. Definitely recommended for anyone with a curiosity about pushing conceptual envelopes and relishing the unexpected.",1228780800,,947,5.031847133757962
2547995,5,B000F0UUSM,"This DVD is a must for everyone. It is an amazing revelation to the mystery of sound, percussion etc. Evelyn Glennie is just unbelievable and you just have to see to believe her amazing giftings.",1214352000,,195,4.6
2547996,3,B000F0UUSM,"Touch the Sound (Thomas Riedelsheimer, 2004)

I've watched two Thomas Riedelsheimer films this month, and have had a great deal of trouble reviewing either one. (I had no idea this was by Riedelsheimer when I DVRed it; I knew only that it was about Evelyn Glennie.) What that says about my method of approaching the films of Thomas Riedelsheimer I don't know. What I do know is that the best way to approach them is to sit back and let them wash over you. When you lock yourself into a Riedelsheimer joint, you're going to be buffeted with a large number of very attractive, somewhat loosely-joined images. There's no denying his films are documentaries, but often they seem as if they're documentaries as such things would have been filmed by Seurat, had he access to a handheld video camera.

Touch the Sound seems to center on Evelyn Glennie's meetings with Fred Frith to record The Sugar Factory, but there's a lot more about Glennie than that short description would imply; playing in a subway station, a trip to Japan to study taiko drumming, teaching deaf school students the joy of percussion, other stuff, all surrounded by that Thomas Riedelsheimer mystique, lots of environmental shots and the like that seem to have little to do with what's going on. (They do; you just have to turn your mind a little way off-center to figure out how.)

It should be noted, however, that a lot of people's reactions to this movie seem to hinge on whether or not they like the music being produced. This, of course, makes perfect sense, given that much of the movie's soundtrack comes from the Sugar Factory recordings; if avant-garde music isn't up your alley, you may want to give this one a pass. But, like all of Riedelsheimer's films, it's a very pretty thing, and worth watching. ***",1205107200,4,1784,4.711538461538462
2547997,5,B000F0UUSM,"I do not buy DVDs. That said, after renting this one I had to have it. I have watched it twice in the last month. There is so much eye candy that you never get enough. The music is complex enough to withstand repeated listening but accessible enough for the average musician. I also enjoy refreshing my memory with some of Evelyn's words of wisdom. Recommended for all musicians and cross-discipline artists. A must-have for percussionists.",1199664000,2,440,4.802631578947368
2547998,4,B000F0UUSM,"I liked this. This documentary presents the concept of sound in a way those of us who can hear don't usually think about. Evelyn Glennie is a percussionist who is deaf - something you don't normally see. This video captures her work, her philosophy, her style in an easy to follow format. While deaf, Ms. Glennie can speak quite articulately, and one has no difficulty following what she is saying. Her love of her work is quite evident, and will, oddly enough, open your eyes to what our ears so often miss.

2547999,5,B000F0UUSM,"This DVD is absolutely riveting. It's a true inspiration for anyone -- artists, musicians, writers. Evelyn Glennie's life is an inspiration and the film brilliantly tells us why.",1187049600,,178,5.392857142857143
2548000,1,B000F0UUSM,"I bought this movie from acorn media, and luckily they allow you to return it, which I did because it was just mind-numbing and tedious.  The only redeeming part was a very small quip about her childhood, which the director should have developed on.

Yes we get it, sound is everywhere, and you can feel it in the vibrations.  I don't need an entire movie to tell me this.",1186444800,2,372,4.36231884057971
2548001,5,B000F0UUSM,"This documentary is very much in the same style and aesthetic as ""Step Across The Border,"" the 2003 documentary on Fred Frith.  In fact Fred co-stars as he and Evelyn Glennie, the deaf percussionist, prepare tracks for a new album.  Recorded all around the world, with at least three different hair colors, Glennie is a mesmerizing presence, attuned to sounds and rhythms that most of us pass over unconsciously.  She gives quiet lessons in participating in life -- in accommodating so-called handicaps -- in striking out in new directions -- and in being connected to the instrument of your body.

Thought provoking, remarkably filmed and a damn sight more interesting musically than any of her CDs!",1185753600,3,700,5.008620689655173
2548002,5,B000F0UUSM,I find it odd that this video does not contain the almost ubiquitous DVD subtitles. Especially as this video would probably be of particular interest  to hearing-impaired musicians.,1185321600,,181,5.464285714285714
2548003,5,B000F0UUSM,This movie really captures the way sound influences our body and how limited of a view we have of an important source of information in our environment. Evelyn is truly gifted and this window into her world is fascinating. This is a slow movie compared to the usual sound bites we're used to in this day and age and I like that about it.,1176508800,2,337,4.28125
2548004,5,B000F0UUSM,"Other reviewers have already described the inspirational aspects of this DVD..I agree. Of particular interest to me are the many improvisational scenes between Fred Frith and Evelyn. The extra feature scenes are terrific. If you enjoy Frith's earlier improvisational outings, ya gotta get this. It's a real pleasure to see Evelyn in an improvisational setting. Many of her available recordings are not as improvisatory...also great imagery and ambient  sounds.",1174089600,3,460,5.666666666666667
2548005,4,B000F0UUSM,"Okay, so I have been in a learning mode recently.  I don't want to learn things a school might teach me.  I find myself wanting to learn about the human spirit and things that are not talked about.

I brought home yet another documentary tonight.  As I watched it I was kind of taken back by the artist's child like reaction to sound, in general.  As the show went on I started feeling as if her reaction to ""all"" sound was what made her an exceptional artist.

A long time ago my ex introduced me to a guitar player.  That is all this artist did.  I remember listening to the CD and being totally captured by a particular song.  It would literally sweep me away and make me feel so unbelievably sad.  There were no lyrics, I didn't know the artist, nor did I know the song.  It turned out to be Joe Satriani's ""Cry"".

This is how Evelyn's music makes me feel.  I don't necessarily mean that it makes me want to cry.  I am saying... there are no words but you know exactly what she is expressing.

Towards the end a guy quotes Richard Long.  He said something like, ""Artists are people who are in touch with the energy they had when they were children.  They never lost it.""

Evelyn later asks, ""What really makes you be you?""

I don't own anything by her at this moment, but I will!  Her music took my breath away and literally gave me chills.

She also said, ""We need to eat, we need to sleep, and we need music.""

Incredible!",1170979200,4,1428,4.230483271375465
2548006,5,B000F0UUSM,"An utterly absorbing portrayal of an artist  who discovers and produces beauty out of unusual materials, and whose work expands one's sense of what music is (and what sound is). The result is not just the chance to hear beautiful music, but also an enrichment of one's sense of living in a world of sound, and an attentiveness to an aspect of life often unnoticed. The documentary includes generous selections of music and interviews with Evelyn Glennie, who is not only charming and very articulate, but who also has thought deeply about her work and consequently has a lot to say about it. The film was made by the filmaker of Rivers and Tides (about the artist Andy Goldsworthy), and has the same mixture of wonder, mind-expansion, and sheer pleasure as that film. In this golden era of documentaries, this film standfs out as one of the best.",1170892800,3,846,4.716216216216216
2548007,4,B000F0UUSM,"In this documentary about her life and work, the percussionist Evelyn Glennie (a Grammy award-winner) does for sound what her fellow Scot and environmental artist Andy Goldsworthy did for sight in the film Rivers and Tides (2002). In fact, both films were directed by Thomas Riedelsheimer. ""My whole life,"" says Glennie, ""is about sound; it's what makes me tick as a human being."" That's a remarkable statement when about thirty minutes into the film you learn that by the time she was a teenager she was profoundly deaf. From playing a snare drum in New York's Grand Central Station, improvising with Fred Frith in an abandoned warehouse in Germany, visiting her brother at their family farm in Aberdeenshire, or staging an impromptu session in Tokyo using chop sticks on restaurant paraphernalia, Glennie explores the aesthetics, psychology and physicality of sound. Splattering water, pneumatic hammers at construction sites, a tap dancer, and general urban din all provide material for her reflections. Most of the sounds in the film are experimental, eerie, and dissonant, but to her credit Glennie amazes us with the complex miracle of one of our five senses.",1169596800,,1165,5.169312169312169
2548008,1,B000F0UUSM,"This DVD is mainly about the cinematographer's ego, lots of artistic shots of nothing. Having heard and seen Glennie perform, I was hoping for some of that magic on the DVD. There was none.",1167782400,7,189,4.588235294117647
2548009,5,B000F0UUSM,Totally changed my concepts of sound and music. I will never perceive sound the same way again.  Evelyn Glennie's story is an inspiration and proves what can be achieved when you listen to your own spirit and refuse to be limited.,1167782400,3,230,4.609756097560975
2548010,4,B000F0UUSM,"I first should  say that Riedelsheimer's previous documentary ""Rivers and Tides"" is one of the best documentaries ever made and it illustrates the complex trials of the creative process. I think he was attempting to do the same with this film. But Goldsworthy is Goldsworthy and Glennie is Glennie. As a subject, Glennie is not as eloquent as Goldworthy and her ""art"" is somehow less interesting.

As a film that attempts to capture the artist process, it is a worthy attempt and should not really be compared to ""Rivers and Tides"". Her performance is made all the more interesting by her lack of hearing.

The one jarring aspect of this film is the film itself call attention to Riedelsheimer's craft. He presents what he thinks Glennie senses and feels throught editing and sound design. Which left me with the feeling that this film was not just about it's subject but about the director's version of the subject. To me, a good documentary director stays out of the way and let's the subject reveal themselves.

While this may seem like a negative review, this is still an amazing film that anyone interested in the artistic process should see. It just does not compare to ""Rivers and Tides"".",1162598400,3,1195,4.786407766990291
2548011,5,B000F0UUSM,"The person who labeled this, ""Disappointing,"" missed the point altogether. While I agree that the actual performances are the most captivating part, the other parts of the film give us insight into why those performances are so captivating. Yes, it is a noisy world, so noisy that it can even inspire a deaf musician!

As a percussionist, what I like most about this film, is that while Glennie is best known for her work with symphony orchestras, the music here is improvised. And with that, it is often very playful (not the serious stuff of classical music). Glennie is at her best when challenged by the avant garde guitar stylings of Fred Frith. His view of seeing everything as possible sound seems to inspire the natural curiousness of Glennie (Frith takes a bow to various metal beams in the abandoned factory they are filming in, noting the sounds they make). Their duo improvisations are the highlight of the film. [As a side note, it would have been nice to have an option to view all the material they did as a separate feature. And what about a CD of their improvisations???]

Glennie is also playful and imaginative when she plays glasses, cans, and bottles in a Japanese club, showing that the music is in the musician, not the instruments. Surprisingly, some of the generous out takes reveal more of Glennie herself.

All in all a fascinating portrait of a fascinating musician. Highly recommended.",1155254400,15,1414,4.810699588477366
2548012,1,B000F0UUSM,"Even though I love Evelyn Glennie, this disc is a disappoinment.  Too little time is spent actually showing her play:  these few and far between moments are the best parts.  The rest is a bore.  We all know what the noisy world sounds like!",1149552000,9,240,4.386363636363637
2548013,4,B000F0UUSM,"Thomas Riedelsheimer's ""Touch The Sound - A Sound Journey with Evelyn Glennie"" presents the captivating world of sound and music, perceived and played by Evelyn Glennie, a renowned percussionist. I confess I never knew her name before watching the film, and perhaps you don't know her, but if so, don't let that fact discourage you to watch the documentary.

The documentary follows the journey of Evelyn Glennie traveling around the world - New York, Germany, Scotland, and Japan -- to discover the fascinating world of sound and music. For Evelyn, who has been hearing-impaired since she was 8 years-old, listening to sound and playing music should be called `touching the sound,' as the film's title suggest. And this documentary film, with the combination of beautiful images and thrilling music, is an attempt to explore the world perceived by Evelyn Glennie.

Though the film contains the interview with Evelyn, it is most arresting when it shows the gifted musician playing and improvising the instruments. The most beautiful moments is Evelyn's solo performance of playing the snare drum at New York's Grand Central Station. Another two standout scenes in this documentary film are her improvisation with guitarist/composer Fred Frith in a huge deserted factory in Cologne, Germany, and the Taiko drummers of `Za Ondekoza' in Fuji City, Japan.

The interviews given by Evelyn are slightly disappointing. Though the film brings her back to the farm in Aberdeen, Scotland, where she grew up as child, and gives her some occasions to talk about her views on sound and music, what she says sounds sometimes a bit too ordinary. She is mostly reticent about her life, and as to her remarks about the sound, the film includes the meditation at the Zen garden at Ryo-anji Temple in Kyoto, but it seems the artist is trying to find the right words to describe what she feels. Even the camera occasionally fails to reveal the artist's heart. When Evelyn is listening to the loud bleeping electronic sound of the basement food floor at department stores in Kyoto, what does her close-up face means? Is she enjoying it? Or is she annoyed by it?

For all its flaws as documentary film, ""Touch The Sound - A Sound Journey with Evelyn Glennie"" has thrilling moments that easily make up for the lack of words. Those moments are filled with her music, of which touching sound and thumping beat would fascinate the people who are not particularly fond of classic or modern music.",1147910400,22,2469,4.956521739130435

To realize how much we cut off ourselves from so many of our senses mainly focused on our vision. I know I have learned so much myself from animals, nature and other teachers regarding this. I used to judge people by vision alone and now I stop, breathe, connect, listen inside and outside. You watch the film and you will pay more attention to what you have not been hearing and perhaps heighten your other senses. I enjoyed the focus on sound. You sit back and allow yourself to be engaged in a new way. It is not an action based film or even one that tells a story, although it does. I enjoyed watching it on Amazon for a small fee and it changed my day. I will watch it again sometime because I am working on being more aware every moment.

I caught a tantalizing piece, the last 20 minutes or so of this mind blowing documentary when it aired on a local PBS station. Ms. Glennie a master percussionist who went deaf as a child, shares her insight and wonder at sound around us and how she integrates it into her music. A snare drum solo on the polished floor of the the star topped cavernous space of Grand Central Terminal is one of the greatest shows of percussion dynamics I've seen or heard. Highlight of the DVD is her sharing an industrial space with guitarist Fred Frith. The gritty abandoned post industrial setting becomes integral to the ""in the moment"" score; pipes, railings, beams, echoes, plus a broad range of various ethnic percussion instruments and Mr. Firths infinite ability to make stringed instruments break new sonic ground are alone worth the price of the DVD. Evelyn Glennie is mesmerizing, a genius if her craft, this DVD was one of the single most inspiring life of music treatise I've seen in decades and altered my practicing habits and playing since.
