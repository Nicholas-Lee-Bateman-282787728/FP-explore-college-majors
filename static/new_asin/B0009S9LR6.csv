I bought this because I was blown away by Liliana Komorowska's guest role as Mara in the Highlander series and I wanted to see more of her. She does not disappoint. She makes a terrific villainess, and clearly relishes the role. ""La belle Dame sans merci,"" indeed. She really makes the movie, and since she's on-screen much of the time, that works out fine.",1510531200,,410,4.708333333333333
8226783,5,B0009S9LR6,"Cronenberg at his finest. I saw this movie when i was about 9 or 10, it was a tape.

There are a lot of good shots here, especially the main city of Montreal where the BNP buildings are.",1509408000,,186,3.8947368421052633
