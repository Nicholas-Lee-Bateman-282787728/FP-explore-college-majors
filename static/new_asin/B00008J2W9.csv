7984708,4,B00008J2W9,Not a movie many have seen but a great cast provide some laughs but also a pretty darn good yarn. Steven Weber and Swoosie Kurtz are top notch and the rest of the cast are competent. A great flick with Kurtz providing a wonderful performance as Hutch's loyal and admiring right-hand employee. Worth a watch.,1475884800,,307,4.6

7984710,3,B00008J2W9,Insurance salesman has an affair with his secretary with murderous results.  Okay comedy/noir that tries to touch a few too many bases and drags a bit in the middle.  Entertaining and forgettable.,1090627200,,196,5.09375
