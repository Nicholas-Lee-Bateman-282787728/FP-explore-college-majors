8172414,5,B000MTFFOA,These women are hardcore. This is a great series,1437091200,,48,4.444444444444445
8172415,3,B000MTFFOA,"This DVD is okay because some of the women wrestle sloppy. Those women like their male counterparts, are brutal, sick, violent, and hardcore animals from your local backyard wrestling shows not those silly WWE Divas or TNA Knockouts. Like their male counterparts, they use many dangerous toys on each other like barbed wire, chairs, tables, cage walls, even light tubes. One of the matches had a woman and man wrestling, but it is not violent, but hilarious when she keep attacking him in the privates. I prefer the American Deathmatch DVD than the rest of those DVDs.",1384819200,,568,4.865979381443299
8172416,5,B000MTFFOA,"Despite what others say, this is a great dvd. IWA Mid-South is awesome! These women may not have the hot bodies of the WWE Divas, but they can really mix it up. Unlike the Divas, these women didn't get into wrestling to be eye-candy! This dvd proves female wrestlers can get hardcore. Vince McMahon's idea of hardcore is having Molly Holly, temporarily, become the WWF Hardcore Champion at Wrestlemania 18. I think Mayumi Ozaki & Micki Knuckles (trained by Ian Rotten) are the toughest. If you want to see some real women's wrestling & some awesome deathmatch action, this is it! THERE ARE NO DIVAS HERE!!!",1307232000,3,606,4.726415094339623
8172417,2,B000MTFFOA,Pretty horrible. Like in WWE women cant wrestle. Expecially harcore wrestling. Sexxxy eddy was the best part of the whole dvd. There is no bonus matches wtf!?

8172418,3,B000MTFFOA,"The 1st 3 DVD's in this series have been the best DVD's I have ever seen. So because of that I am setting the bar very high for this one as well. I am a bit worried since most women matches seem very boring and well bad wrestling (wwe and wcw). I have seen Lufisto before and she has done a good job in a few matches but then right away we find out she is not competing.

Unlucky 13 Staple Gun Death Match - Ann Thraxx vs. Mickie Knuckles- Cool to watch. They kept stapling dollar bills to each other. It was fairly brutal to watch. A few very good spots in the match. Grade B+

Thumbtack Death Match - Vanessa Kraven vs. Rachael Putski- This match wasn't bearly as violent. They both looked very sloppy. Some moves where decent, but others looked awful. Grade C

4 Corners Of Pain - Amy Lee vs. SeXXXy Eddy- This was more of a comedy match. We did seem some nice moves, and some nice use or light tubes, and barbwire. Grade C+

Barbed Wire Madness - Sumie Sakai vs. Mayumi Ozaki- Ozaki destroyed her opponent. Sakai was bleeding buckets! If it was more competitive it would have been even better. Grade B

Taipei Death Match - Mickie Knuckles vs. Rachael Putski - Just a brutal match! It was really a great Taipei deathmatch. I was amazed how much they just beat on each other with the glass. Grade A

2 out of 3 Log Cabin Lighttubes - SeXXXy Eddy vs. Mayumi Ozaki- Ok match, Eddy didn't pull of too many moves, he just took a beating. Ozaki  looks really goo and loves to use a dog collar effectively. Grade B-

Barbed Wire, Weapons, Steel Cage Match - Mickie Knuckles vs. Mayumi Ozaki- Solid finish but nothing spectacular. Both competitors where so tired they could don't much. They used a lot of light tubes on each other and we saw the occasional whip into the barbwire. Grade B-

Overall this DVD fell well short of the others. This one had less matches, and only reached 2 hours because of a lot of replays. It's a shame this one didn't live up to the other in the series because the others are truly remarkable. Overall Grade B-",1190160000,2,2037,4.283854166666667
