2911297,4,B000TYV3C6,"Is Spider-Man 3 as good as Spider-Man 2? No. Not really.

But that doesn't mean this box set isn't a great deal. 2-Disc Special Editions for the first two films, and the 1-Disc Widescreen for the 3rd (slightly disappointing, but let's face it: so is the third movie). The trilogy as a whole is awesome, and the price can't be beat.

Don't get a bunch of extra expensive editions of Spider-Man 3. There's no deleted scenes, so there's no hope of seeing what Venom bits were not included. If you're like me, and waited until now to buy these films, ow is the chance.",1193702400,4,564,4.413461538461538
2911298,5,B000TYV3C6,"An amazing boxset with TWO of the best Superhero movies of recent memory. The third... well not so much. Either way it is a trilogy and you can't ignore that the third didn't exist (hence the trilogy worth owning part). As for the bluray transfers, all are top notch and naturally get progressively better based on the age of each movie. I love it.",1193616000,,348,4.453125
2911299,5,B000TYV3C6,"Don't listen to the HD DVD fanboys, the Spider-Man trilogy release on blu-ray is going to be one of the biggest releases ever on any format.  Sony has a record of putting uncompressed audio on most of their releases, so expect this one to look AND sound great!",1193529600,,260,4.416666666666667
2911300,5,B000TYV3C6,I enjoyed these movies and plan on buying them to watch on my playstation 3.,1193011200,2,76,4.133333333333334
2911301,1,B000TYV3C6,"Amazingly silly dance routines. Baaaad acting. Lame, lame, lame story (I particularly love how the meteorite happens to land right next Peter and Mary Jane while making-out on a giant self-made web). And all for a mere $60 retail. Thank god for Amazon! If you're into this sort of thing that is. Don't let the effects dazzel your brain, this is truely one of the worst comic book movies, yet. And it's Spiderman, how can you screw that up.",1192752000,9,439,4.569620253164557
2911302,5,B000TYV3C6,"Well, everyone who has seen the three movies by now will probably agree that the first spidey was good, the second was great and the third was a letdown in comparison to the first two.

This set has the three films, so I think it would be unfair to punish the first two because of the third (like many reviewers have done by now). To watch Spider-Man 2 in full HD glory is going to be a blast for every Spider-Man fan out there.

The first movie is a very good movie that is worth enjoying in HD, the second is one of the best superhero films in history and the third... well, the story falls short after the big anticipation generated by Spidey 2 (to many villains end up being a mess like others have put it), and in some points it just becomes too campy to endure, but nobody can deny that in terms of visuals it is still worthy of HD. Add to this all the extras on HD as well and you've got yourself a nice package.

The trilogy as a whole is entertaining, and Spider-Man 2 has story, deep villain, epic moments... (I know, I can't spot praising Spider-Man 2), and despite being weak in comparison to the others, the third film isn't that bad. It just had a lot to live up to, and it failed to do so, but you still get some awesome action sequences, and this set in particular includes the other two films.

So, the question you should ask yourself: Are three movies worthy of being seen in HD worth of the price?  If you enjoyed the Spidey trilogy enough to want to buy it, and if you appreciate High Definition, then I think the answer is definitely yes.",1192579200,,1560,4.2040133779264215
2911303,5,B000TYV3C6,I cant wait to get this movie on Blu Ray..I already own the first 2 but its gonna be worth seeing them on Blu Ray in HD!!,1192492800,,121,3.5185185185185186
2911304,5,B000TYV3C6,"This is an amazing blu-ray box set of the 3 Spiderman movies. In beautiful 1080p high definition picture,  spiderman have never looked better ! IF you own a Playstation 3 or any another blu-ray player and looking for your first blu-ray to buy , GET THIS ONE ! Its one of the best looking and sounding titles out and the movies are great. Lots of detail and color pop in the picture

Pick this one up, you will NOT be disappointed.

2911305,2,B000TYV3C6,"Great picture quality, cool, and Blu-Ray is the premier format for all of its seamless feature interaction, and high storage capacity for more bonus material.... except Spider-man 1 and 2 have no special features (aside from the 2.1 stuff). Great use of space, thanks for all those perks, BR.

So, I have to wonder, is it really worth the $70 to pick this up again?",1188864000,4,365,4.615384615384615

2911318,4,B000TYV3C6,I enjoyed watching all of these movies again. I thought Tobey Maguire did a great job on these films though the third one had a little too many villains and kind of took away from the essence of what made the first two really really good. Having either Mary Jane or Aunt May constantly the victims of the bad guys was really worn by the third film. Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin was fantastic as was J.K. Simmons performance as  J. Jonah Jameson. He looked and acted so close to the comics it was funny and uncanny. Alfred Molina was a great Doc Octopus as well. This a must see for Spider-Man fans.,1520121600,,597,4.330357142857143

Excellent deal.  I love it.  When I ordered it, I didn't know if there were bonus features or not, but for five good movies it was definitely a good deal.

The cover looks way too off and when I opened the ""book"" the first pics isn't straight. You'll expect a better job for such an ""expensive"" set.

Edit: I was watching the first movie (4K) and these weird pixels came out from nowhere.

2911624,3,B000TYV3C6,"The packaging is very slim, as each disc is slide behind a cardboard sleeve so the risk of scratching the disc and/or tearing the cardboard is high. The discs include SM1, SM2, SM3, and SM3 bonus disc.

The set does include an Ultraviolent code for the Trilogy, and by that I mean one code for all three movies. So you have to redeem all three at one. If you dislike SM3, you still have to add it to your collection.

HERE IS MY BIGGEST PROBLEM: The HD Blu Ray set includes only Standard Definition digital copies of the films. The whole point of the HD format is show the better picture, why be cheap with the digital version?

Pros:
-Great price. I paid under $10
-Slim design. Only as think as two blu ray cases. And the spin says ""Spider-man trilogy""
-Digital copies included. For under $10 I got 3 HD disc, and 3 digital copies. You can't even get the digital copy of one film for that price.

Cons:
-Packaging is a cardboard foldout, so frequent removing of discs comes with the risk of damage to the discs and/or packaging.
-Standard Defintion Digital Copies. (This was my biggest disappointment).
-Digital copies are on one code. You can't cherry pick w/ films you get, you'll be adding all 3 to your UV library.",1449705600,11,1220,4.457399103139013

A 4-fold cardboard which makes it impossible to take the discs out without leaving a solid fingerprint on the disc or scratching the surface, and yet somehow it still doesn't save any real shelf space with this stupid packaging. I have BBC documentaries on 8 discs which come into a slimmer overall case, so I don't know why they could not fit 4discs in a standard sized BluRay case. The quality of the cardboard is also quite low, it bends and creases very easily - it is almost like this is a one time use only packaging, leaving you to contemplate what to do with the discs after you dare take them out and watch them.",1444867200,5,693,4.421875

2911713,4,B000TYV3C6,"The Spider-man trilogy with a fourth bonus disc of ""extras"" is a good collection at a good price compared to buying each of them separately. I won't try to review each film as it would take too much space. I watched the three over the course of about a week. There is cohesion between them as each successive movie extending all the main characters' arcs. The third provides additional closure to plot and character arc elements but not so much that it prevents additional movies. Even so, each one also stands OK on its own without being over-dependent on the previous film(s), unlike the more recent Hunger Games and Hobbit trilogies that employ absolutely infuriating ""cliffhanger"" endings to suck the audience back for more box office $$$$$ from the next movie in the franchise. Peter Parker is allowed to have all the common traits and emotional angst of a young 18-20 year old adult who is trying to find himself. The result is a very ""human"" Spider-man and a film that isn't simply a series of web-swinging action sequences. The action is a bit weak in a few places as it defies the Laws of Physics regarding mass, momentum and gravity just a little too much. Movies like these cannot be expected to have 100% accuracy but a little more attention to it could have made some of the action appear more credible than it did. Overall, the Sam Raimi trilogy is very good.

The packaging leaves much to be desired. I cannot imagine 6th-8th graders (or some high school teens) getting the discs out of the sleeves without destroying the packaging and the discs from scratches, fingerprints and whatever gooey crud they have on their hands. Worse than the book type packaging with each disc in a ""page,"" this one folds up into fourths with one disc sliding into each panel. Pulling the discs out of these sleeved panels without completely covering them with dozens of fingerprints trying to grasp them was quite frustrating. Consider getting some standard Blu-ray clamshell cases and putting the discs in them if kids are going to handle them. Otherwise, don't expect the fold up sleeve case and probably the discs to last past one or two viewings.",1422835200,,2147,4.740641711229946

2911763,5,B000TYV3C6,"It's important to note a couple things about this set: First, it is not the best set if you are looking for Bonus material. There is some, but not all the material from other sets for these movies. So, if you are looking for the most complete experience available, you should look elsewhere. While I like the occasional bonus material, I personally am much more interested in the movies themselves, so I don't have any problem with their lack. Upon its original release, this was a bit of a cash-grab product, and there was still that blu-ray vs. HD-DVD war going on, so there were some shenanigans in that regard, but in the end we have this as one among multiple options for owning these films.

The second thing of particular note is that this is the only blu-ray collection I own in which the sound is comfortably balanced. I spend so much time adjusting the volume to get the dialogue louder or the background music quieter that it is often too distracting to watch a blu-ray and preferable to seek other formats. Not so here. All three movies can be played and enjoyed from beginning to end without those problems. It's incredibly refreshing. The picture, too, is crisp and clear and beautiful.

As for the movies themselves, they are outstanding action movies. Yes, the third one falls short of the first two, but I still think it's very good, with huge action sequences and great focus on the characters. The first two, in particular, though, are without a doubt a pair of the best comic book movies of all time, right up there with Donner's Superman and Burton's Batman. If you like these movies and aren't concerned with every bell and whistle extra feature, this is a fantastic, affordable way to get them.",1407283200,,1717,4.644736842105263

Spider-Man was an entertaining origin and Spider-Man 2 is one of my favorite superhero movies. You just can't go wrong with Spider-Man 2, as well as The Dark Knight. In this set, you get the versions of Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 released in 2012 with the bonus features from the DVDs in tact and all the bonus features of the third Spider-Man. The PQ and AQ of all three films are great. If I do have to complain, I would have to complain about the packaging. The movies don't come in individual Blu Ray cases, they come all together in individual cardboard sleeves and one could scratch up the discs if they remove a disc haphazardly.

2911783,3,B000TYV3C6,"What could arguably be one of the greatest trilogy of films(easily in superhero films)to date comes to Blu Ray in a half hearted ""cash in"" release. I am a huge fan of these films and I already own the 2 disc DVD releases for each of the three installments. I was hoping for a definitive Blu Ray release when I bought this, but what I got was very good transfers with no new bonus material! To make matters worse the old bonus material and commentaries for the first two films were NOT even carried over! The only extra for those two films are trailers for two other films and both the first and second discs have the same two trailers on them!

Considering the space available on Blu Ray discs, I think this is shameful and insulting to fans. I'm all for moving forward with technology, but not at the expense of the consumer. ...so.......here we go again, first we introduce a new improved format, then we rush to release halfhearted editions, so they can release a better one a year or two later and the vicious cycle continues.

OK so now you get past that you will be keeping your original two disc DVD's because the bonus stuff is actually very good and well worth keeping on those editions. Now we get to the transfers, all three films show a very noticeable improvement, but the standard DVD releases look very good too and I'm not sure it warrants a double dip without the extras. The first film looks a bit grainy at times, with the second film looking much better. The sound is a big improvement on all three films. I just do not understand why the bonus stuff wasn't carried over for the first two films. It would have made considering this release to buy a much easier decision.

My ratings for the films

Spider Man - 4.6
The first film is creaky at times, but it is so much fun that I can forgive any flaws in it. It's got great characters, action, acting and heart, it's one of the best popcorn flicks you'll ever see. Tobey McGuire may not be the wisecracking Spidey we know from the comic book, but he is completely believable as the young teen with these strange new powers. Dafoe is perfectly cast as the Green Goblin even if the Goblin design could have been a little better. I also loved J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and Dunst, Robertson and Harris are great as M.J. and Uncle Ben and Aunt May. I know that some think there could have been a lot more development with Parker getting used to his new powers, but I believe this series was known to be a trilogy right from the get go and Raimi wanted to make Spider Man 2 all about the problems that would come with these powers and as we all know he pulled that one off in spades. When you think about the genius of how the first film was handled with Parker not giving much thought to the dangers of his new found gifts, it's a really good movie. I also love the ending of the film which I know also made all the ladies big fans of this film. There is nothing quite so bitter sweet as unrequited love. Besides being an extremely fun film it is also a very important film because super hero films were never taken too seriously until after this film made a ton of money.

Spider Man 2 - 4.9

Even though this is a superior film to the first, I like the first one better. That's not to say that this could quite possibly be the greatest super hero movie of all time! It's got everything a great super hero film needs, great story, acting, pacing, action,hero, villain, love interest and a touch of comedy. Spider Man 2 also develops the character and answers all the questions the first film didn't fully flesh out. I thought Alfred Molina (a guy I had never heard of at the time) was absolutely fantastic as ""Doc Ock"" . The FX look better and the fight scenes are more appropriate for our web slinging hero with high flying air battles, Spidey shooting web balls and a villain who looks much more like his comic book counter part. Besides having great action sequences Spider Man 2 also has a lot of heart and the love relationship and guilt issues keep this film from becoming just another super hero movie. The blend of drama and action would not be complete without a pinch of comedy which this film hits on every cylinder. Whether it's Spidey delivering pizza, taking an elevator ride or the hilarious use of the song 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' this film has some wonderful funny moments.

Spider Man 3 - 4.0

OK this one is for my Twin Andrew! I know this film has taken a beating and I would have to agree it is a disappointment. I really don't know how it couldn't be. It just had too much to live up to. The biggest problem with this film for me is that Raimi didn't make it long enough. I think he knew this would be his last Spider Man film and he should have given this installment the length it needed to tie up all the loose ends from the first two films with the detail it deserved.

 I do think this is a very good film and only in the area of Venom does it seem rushed. I think Venom needed another 20-25 minutes of time in the film before joining forces with Sandman. this would have given this interesting character time to develop. Venom is a unique character in Web Heads Rogue Gallery and he deserved more than just an add on in this film. He's stronger than Spidey, he knows who Spidey is, he is immune to Spidey's Spider Sense. I think the possibilities are wasted here and I think the extra time would have made all the difference in the world. Considering all that is going on in the bloated finale, I do think Raimi does a good job of keeping things moving without becoming too confusing. I know there are many changes in the comic book history, but you have to expect that sort of thing when a comic book character makes a transition to film. I think Spider Man 3 is a very good film and a fitting end to the series even if a little too ambitious.

So overall this is a good set, but for me I would rather have the DVD editions with all the interesting bonus material than better looking films with no bonus material. I will keep both the DVD and the Blu Ray versions. The choice is up to the consumer, but be aware that there is surely a better version around the corner.",1398297600,3,6181,4.301546391752577
2911784,1,B000TYV3C6,The worst actors ever cast.  This has nothing on the new Amazing Spider-man movies.  How they portrayed Venom made me want to cry.  Not comic book accurate at all.  They are painful to watch.,1398297600,,191,4.529411764705882
2911785,4,B000TYV3C6,"This Spider-Man Trilogy blu-ray box set is essentially a re-packing of previous Spider-Man blu-ray releases.  If you do not yet own these films, this new set is the perfect way to own the entire trilogy and nearly all the special features that were ever released.  But I do not think there is any need to repurchase these movies if you already own them because there is no new content in this set.

About the packaging... It should be noted that in this set, the discs are stored in a slim fold-out cardboard case with an outer box.  So it's a nice way to save some shelf space, but those who like all their movies to be in the traditional blu-ray cases will be disappointed.

2911829,5,B000TYV3C6,"I've always been a fan of this version of the Spider-Man story over the latest version that has been released. While this Blu-Ray trilogy does not have the special features of other editions, if you are like me, you are more interested in the movie itself rather than the presence of those features. However, in this product, the Blu-Ray for Spider-Man 2 does give you the option of watching the PG-13 version, or the ""unrated"" version, the latter appearing to simply be a slightly extended version of the PG-13 version. Yeah, I know, that's not what most of us normally think of when we hear ""unrated version,"" but I didn't see or hear any reason for the unrated version to be given any other rating higher than PG-13. Spider-Man 3 did come with another disk of special features, but as I am a ""movie only"" guy, I haven't watched it yet. The sound, clarity, and quality of the picture is excellent, and only gets better with each movie.

Overall, the picture quality is great and the audio is superb. The major problem is that Sony has dropped all supplements from Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 (hang onto the DVDs which were loaded with bonus content). However, all the extras from Spider-Man 3 are here on the bonus disc. There is over 2 hours of total bonus content provided which is light treatment for a 3-film collection.

2911888,5,B000TYV3C6,"I was a minor comic book geek as a kid (Marvel primarily, not DC), and I have to admit, I was fairly pleased when the Raimi-envisioned Spiderman series went into production.  The actual comic book was a decent mix of drama, action, and humor, and I was pleased that Sam Raimi did a good job of infusing a lot of those same elements into the movies.

I bought the ""Spiderman Trilogy Blu-ray"" series just a few weeks ago, after having never purchased ANY of the single movies either on DVD or Bluray (which is actually surprising for me as I enjoyed them for the most part), so there has been a fair amount of time between the recent purchase and my last viewing of most of the series.  I decided to watch all three again over a week, and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised.  I honestly didn't remember that the whole series was as good as it is.  Is it phenomenal?  No, but it is a solid, interesting, and entertaining presentation of the Peter Parker / Spiderman story.

I'm not one of those nitpicks who lambasts every little detail that's different from the actual comic book.  I try to consider the bigger picture, the spirit of intent, so to say, and take the movie production as a whole.  For the most part, this trilogy hits the target.  Tobey Maguire delivers a nuanced but impacting Peter Parker, and Kirsten Dunst delivers the right balance of emotion and spunk as Mary Jane Watson.  The other supporting characters (the Green Goblin, Doc Ock, the Sandman, Venom, Aunt May, etc) deliver with variable impact, but all still carry their weight in the series.  The weaker of the three films is number 3 (as most reviewers, myself included, seem to think), but it's still good enough to ably support the series as a whole.

Not sure I would give any of the individual movies a solid 5, but the series as a whole is, for me, a definite ""4.5 with a roundup to 5"" rating.

Pluses would be the story and character development, with weighty-enough performances delivered by the various actors in the series (especially the mains) and the well-balanced delivery of light and heavy plot lines.  Even when the story gets serious, there's a comical element to the whole delivery.

Minuses would be the ""everything and the kitchen sink"" approach to the third installment.  There's really just too many story elements that distract from a central theme to sink your teeth into.  It almost works...but not quite.

Again, having never watched the entire series in quick succession, I was impressed by how well it held up as a whole.  If for some fluky reason, like me, you haven't purchased any of the previous single titles, this is way worth the buying the series a whole.

The stories touch on plenty of action, romance and contain good character development. In this specific package Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 come with 2 DVDs each one being for the main movie and the other most likely extras (I don't examine the extra DVDs much). All 3 movies are in Widescreen format. This set is worth it for Spider-Man 2 and 3 alone. Get this.

2911895,3,B000TYV3C6,"So, I'll make this relatively brief:

The movies themselves are great. No bones about it.

However, the discs themselves leave a lot to be desired. It seems like the studio rushed this set into production and cheaped out on it. The first two movies have almost precisely zero special features. Completely barebones other than trailers for Ghost Rider & Surf's Up. Neither particularly interesting movies. The third movie has all the special features one would expect on a DVD or Blu-Ray release. But it hardly makes up for the utter lack of features on the first 2 discs of the series.

Clearly, the studio has produces Blu-Rays with all the Special Features one would expect for Spiderman&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1/dp/B007L4HFDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2/dp/B007L4HF74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3/dp/B007L4HET8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3</a>. So, I really have no idea why the studio cheaped out on this set and didn't include all the discs with the special features that clearly EXIST. Perhaps they had excess stock of the ""barebones"" releases because they were crap and not selling so they wanted to get rid of them? I really don't know.

Suffice it to say, this is not the ""ultimate set"" that any and every collector would be lusting after.

In my opinion, I overpaid for this set, considering the total lack of features on 2/3 of the movies. And also considering I already own the special editions on DVD, which came with all the features you could ever want. I had hoped this would be an ""upgrade."" However, it felt more like a downgrade on account of losing all the features, rather than an upgrade from getting better picture quality.

I'd even go so far as to say anyone who wants all the features should boycott this release until the studio comes out with a TRUE ""ultimate collection"" making use of the 3 ""complete"" (read: feature-rich) sets. You'd probably be better off buying the 3 individual releases of parts 1, 2 & 3 listed above, rather than this somewhat pathetic ""[in]complete"" set.

My hope is that by this set not sellign well, the studio will get the message and make the actual ""ultimate edition"" everyone wants. They clearly have the sets to do it. They just need to swap out which sets they include. Swap in the two sets with features in place of the two barebones sets. Problem solved...

So, again, overall bottom line: good movies, bad features. Vote with your money. Buy the individual releases with the features rather than this collection without the features.",1347148800,3,2729,5.511961722488039

2911897,5,B000TYV3C6,"Wow, the quality of these Blue-ray movies is awesome!  Spiderman 1-I feel introduces us to Spiderman pretty good.  I think the story-line is great, acting is decent to good.  I personally did not care much for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  I feel as if she was a little fake and overly dramatic.  Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) I know a lot of comparisons have been made to Garfield from The Amazing Spiderman, but for this series, Maguire was great.  I am not much of a James Franco fan as he plays Harry Osborn.  One carachter that I loved was William Dafoe playing the Green Goblin.  I like most of Dafoes movies though.  Spiderman 2-I personally liked more than Spiderman 1, I particularly enjoyed Doc Ock (Alfred Molina).  I loved this movie, the drama of Parker having to be Spiderman, and the train scene was the best!  Spiderman 3 was worth watching, but that is it.  The CGI was still amazing, but the story line was horible!  They were in a rush to end this trilogy and felt the only way was to introduce a bunch of villians at once.  Sandman would have made a good villian for a movie, Venom should have had his own movie!  I think the fightes were to short in duration as well.  Very disapointed with this movie altogether, but so were millions of other people!  Overall I bought the trillogy for $20 with free shipping.  My overall rating is for all three movies combined Picture quality- 5/5, sound quality 3/5 (this is mostly due to my TV's limitation, a sound system is in the works) Story 4/5 (Spiderman 1-5/5, Spiderman 2-5/5, Spiderman 3-2/5).

2911899,5,B000TYV3C6,"Following the cult classic status of Blade and the surprising box office success of X-Men, Marvel decided to lend out the rights of another one of their most cherished characters. Based on the success of the cartoons, this was sure to pull in a very specific demographic, but I doubt they expected it to be as popular as it became. It surpassed the success of X-Men, and ushered in a decade that would have many more comic book, cartoon, and toy movies set records. For too many years, these types of properties did not get the respect they deserved as real dramatic and action movies, and not just dumb superhero fun. Spider-Man finally got that due respect. The weekend it came out, my focus was on Star Wars Episode II, but after I saw Spider-Man I was blown away. Like many others of my generation, my fandome really started with the first Spidey film, and then blossomed into collecting stacks upon stacks of comics. The visual effects were not the standard for the time, especially with the aforementioned Star Wars film coming out, but they were still pretty damn good. The music was fantastic, thanks to Danny Elfman (the man behind The Simpsons music, and so many other great film scores). Director Sam Raimi created a truly stylistic and visual masterpiece. Honestly, I'm not a fan of the Evil Dead series. I doubted a director best known for horror movies would do the material justice, but he did not disappoint.

Neither did the cast. All of the actors were fairly new to me. I had no idea who most of them were, except Kirsten Dunst I knew from Small Soldiers (I was a child). But I always applaud and appreciate big blockbusters that turn lesser names into household names. Tobey maguire and Dunst had a chemistry that really dold the complex relationship of the two iconic characters they were portraying. To this day, my favorite character, besides Spider-Man, is definitely JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. If ever there were an actor born to play a specific supporting role, it was him. Willem Dafoe was great as Norman Osborn. As the serum changed him from a desperate businessman to a conflicted monster, the not so subtle nuances of Dafoe's performance really began to shine through. If only Green Goblin's costume had less of a silly looking design, then his character would be one of the premier villains in Marvel film history. As it stands, Goblin's costume only hurts the film by making it seem more campy than it really is. It serves as a constant reminder that you're watching a cartoon with real people acting it out. Nevertheless, Spider-Man should definitely be creditted as the film that sparked the hype and interest that comic book adaptations get today. If it were not for Spider-Man (as well as Blade and X-Men), I doubt that movies like Watchmen, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Fantastic 4, Ghost Rider, Punisher, Dare Devil, or any of the other countless comic book and superhero flicks would have been taken seriously enough to be converted from script into film.

And the Blu-ray presentation of this old favorite of mine was night and day upon my discovery of the disc. I had seen the DVDs countless times, but it wasn't until my eyes were laid upon the BD that I appreciated every inch of every frame as they were shot. Detail is remarkable. Color is rich. It truly is like watching the movie for the very first time.

Spider-Man 2 is what fans dream about when the sequal to a movie as fantastic as Spider-Man is announced. Topping a film as great as that one is a definite challenge, but it seems to happen more and more each passing year. Sequals like this one, X2: X-Men United, T2: Judgement Day, The Dark Knight, and others all have one thing in common. Beyond just being a ""sequal"", they managed to outdo their predecessors in almost every way. Spider-Man 2 is not only a great sequal, it is one of the best comic book movies ever made. It doesn't go for the mature adult feel that The Dark Knight has. On the contrary, Spider-Man 2 maintains that corny camp and tongue-in-cheek humor that made the first one so good. Sure some of the dialogue is cheesy at times, and the action is never tries to be realistic, but isn't that why we go to these movies? To be virtually thrilled to the point of exhaustion? Okay, maybe that's taking it a bit far, but my point remains that these films don't need to strive for realism. Their fantasy elements and use of childlike imagination and wonder are what make them so great.

Its about a man with spider-like abilities fighting a man with mechanical tentacles attached to his back. The only thing I felt was lacking in TDK, is very abundant in Spidey 2. There is great humor, and the movie has the overall feel of an actual comic book. I also got a sense of the director and writers respect for their source material, but not being afraid to have fun with it. The ending of this film gave me chills the first few times I saw it. It wasn't until Spider-Man 3 actually came out, that the end of Spidey 2 lost some of its magic. Spider-Man 2 is in a solid second place on the list of my favorite comic book movies of all time. Right above films like The Avengers, Sin City, Iron Man, etc. There is really only one thing I didn't like about the movie. There were too many close-ups of random women screaming. It was okay once or twice, but not four or five times. That's minor though. This movie was a fine achievement. As for the Blu-ray transfer. Is it as great as the first one's? An emphatic yes! Even better, in fact. The adundance of detail and clarity are remarkable. This disc is a reference disc to show how amazing catalogue blockbusters can look.

As far as Spider-Man 3 goes, I want start off by saying that I like this movie. Probally more than you do. With that said, I'll also add that it does serve its purpose, which is to prove that any Spider-Man movie will have great special effects, fine character development, okay acting, and make a shitload of money. Spider-Man 3 is a good film in its own right, but only a decent one when put in the tall dark shadow of its amazing, and incredibly revolutionary predecessors. It does not add much of value to the franchise, aside from introducing some of the most popular characters in Spidey's publication history. That said, those characters aren't given the attention and respect they deserve. They feel more like late additions that were shoehorned in. Overall the movie was not terrible though. It was definitely better than both of the Fantastic 4 movies, Ghost Rider, Elektra, and Daredevil, as well as some other less than savory comic book adaptations. The only thing that really held this movie down were the, not one, but two unnecessary dance scenes, and underdeveloped characters. The worst of the two dance scenes was Peter walking down the street like he was in a music video. The second dance scene reminded me of the jazz flute scene in Anchorman. That should never be. Those scenes made me feel like Sam Raimi was too comfortable with the fact that the movie would make alot of money, and there was no major competition in the superhero/comic book movie department, besides a few hits and a couple of upcoming challengers.

That may have been passable in the summer of 2007, but now we have The Avengers saga and The Dark Knight trilogy that have set the bar so high that movies like them should be treated with the utmost respect and care. The addition of Gwen Stacy seemed rather pointless to me, unless they planned on ellaborating on the love triangle between her, Peter, and Mary Jane from the comics in later installments that never came to fruition. The running time was noticably longer than the previous two films, and it felt like a bloated Thanksgiving turkey. There's no reason the two dance scenes should have made the final cut. Some editors and directors don't understand what truly qualifies as a ""Deleted Scene"". Aside from the dance scenes, perhaps the biggest issue I have with this film is the treatment of my all-time favorite Spidey villain, Venom. Venom was so obviously a late addition to the script that it made me mad. And in addition to that, he was not the towering, manacing presence that we know him as. I must admit though, I loved the wonderful, yet very predictable team-ups of Spider-Man and the New Goblin versus Sandman and Venom. That really brought something to the movie when it was in desperate need of a kick-start. Spidey 3 was not the disaster it has so often been called by geeks and armchair critics alike, but it wasn't an achievement either.

Now for the Blu-ray treatment of this rather mid-level, if slightly above average comic book film. Simply put, it's reference quality. The audio and video transfers are pretty much flawless. The extras are incredibly thorough and comprehensive as well. This trilogy is one of the best looking and sounding sets on the market. The only flaw with the set, aside from the decrease in quality entering the third installment, is the lack of extras on the first two discs. Overall though, this set is Highly Recommended, but the re-releases of the first two films are better than the first two discs in this set.",1344816000,4,9158,4.628536285362854

2911917,5,B000TYV3C6,"This review is for the Spider-Man: Ultimate High Definition trilogy Box Set.

It contains the following films:  ""Spider-Man"" (2002), ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004), ""Spider-Man 2.1"" (an extended cut of Spider-Man 2 featuring some new sequences, and some entirely different alternate scenes) and ""Spider-Man 3"" (2007).

As for the films, I'd rate them as such:
""Spider-Man"" ...  8 out of 10
""Spider-Man 2/2.1"" ...  10 out of 10
""Spider-Man 3"" ...  7 out of 10 (I didn't hate it, it had a charm and a lot of good factors, despite it's obvious large faults.)

The Blu-Ray image is pretty incredible.  I already owned all three on DVD, but I wanted to upgrade, as these films deserve the High-Def treatment.  All three look significantly better, compared to their standard-def DVD counterparts.  The first ""Spider-Man"" is the least dramatic upgrade, but the image is still clearer, sharper and more detailed...  I was able to see a lot of things I missed on DVD (I didn't realize how much of the image was lost on DVD from compression and whatnot, because every shot I was seeing things I hadn't seen since the movie theater in 2002)- so even though it wasn't the greatest Blu-Ray picture quality, it was still definitely worth the upgrade.

The second and third films are where the High-Def image pays off, though!  I had just watched the second and third films days before this set arrived on DVD, and it is like night and day.  ""Spider-Man 2"" was astounding in terms of how much more I could see in the image.  You felt like you could reach into the movie.  Textures looked real (DVD won't give you that), colors were brighter, small things (sparks, bits of glass, sweat, water) had astonishingly more detail.  It was a huge upgrade.  And ""Spider-Man 3"" was just as incredible- what really got me is that you could literally see things that are invisible on the DVD (Ex. You can see every single speck of sand during the Sandman scenes, and when we see the news broadcast towards the end of the film, I couldn't see the ""horizontal TV lines"" on DVD at all, whereas here, they're clearly visible.).

I can't comment much for sound, as I just play my sound through the TV speakers, but judging from that, everything is mixed well.

The special features are where this review almost slips- the only special features are those from ""Spider-Man 3"", which felt a bit odd.  They are cool features, but it seemed like a missed opprotunity.

But all in all, the price (which has come down a lot) makes it worth it.  You can find really good quality used or even new copies in the $25-$35 range, so I can't complain much about the features- the price is right, the quality is amazing, and what features there are, are very solid.

I'd highly recommend this set!  Great films.",1300233600,4,2755,4.654244306418219

2911920,5,B000TYV3C6,"First, a review of the movies. The first Spider-Man movie, while occasionally deviating from the original storyline, was a great movie. It was mostly true to Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original tale of the web-slinger. It pulled on the Norman Osborn/Green Goblin storylines and was really enjoyable.

The second movie was more goodness and was also really well done. This time we are introduced to Doctor Octopus and we see the beginnings of Harry Osborn going crazy (to later become the second Green Goblin).

The third movie was pretty bad, and I am a huge Spider-Man fan. While I really wanted to see Venom as the villain for the third movie, his whole story arc didn't mesh well with the Sandman/Green Goblin arc. And it also didn't help that Topher Grace played the part of Eddie Brock. All I could see is the kid from That 70's Show (not to say anything bad about Topher or the show, I liked them both). But since when was Eddie Brock a puny kid with a grudge? And what's with the symbiote lifting to show his face all the time? This movie had so much potential, but failed to be up to the quality of its predecessors.

As for the blu-ray trilogy, it looks amazing! The quality and clarity of the picture is truly great. The only negative I have against the trilogy is the lack of special features for the first movie. With the amount of space on a blu-ray disc, I'm surprised to see so little.",1294012800,2,1400,4.4609375

2911923,5,B000TYV3C6,"I am going to just briefly review the movies. For the most part they are great. The first movie was one of the best Superhero origin stories ever and a great mix of comedy and action. The only issue was with that goofy Green Goblin costume. You would think for the millions they spent on that movie, someone could have come up with a better costume. The second movie is one of the greatest films of the last decade. The acting, the direction, the story, everything hit the right notes and made for a thrilling, unbelievable experience. And finally, the third film. It was ok. It had some good points, but also some bad. Too many villains and a story that did not stay focused. It was a shame the series had to end on such a mediocre point.

The thing that is really important to take away from this review is how awesome it is to watch Spidey swing around in High Def. The Blu-Ray format was invented for movies like this. Even if you own these films in another format, you owe it to yourself to upgrade to these versions. Your eyes will thank you.",1291075200,,1048,4.319796954314721

2911925,4,B000TYV3C6,"The entire Spiderman trilogy is so good (particularly the first two) not because of its fantastic FX, made even more marvelous ;-) in HD, not because of great acting that, with intuitive genius, includes over-the-top performances by limited, key actors (editor, villains), combined with over-the-top powers and toys of the villains to link-in the comic-book (alright, graphic novelette) genre's mood, while keeping the performances of Parker and his personal circle on an emotional, earthly level, but the three movies are sooo good because the story is written so well, with the priority on character, character, character, and the love story, as stated in the first movie's opening monologue, and held true throughout.

Peter Parker's (Toby Maguire) trials with his family, friend, Harry (James Franco) and love-interest, MJ (Kirsten Dunst), are such that the audience is so drawn into the interactions and outcomes, including the strong, inner struggle Parker has with his super-hero alter-ego, that the FX, stunts, toys, and even the conflict with the villains (who are also excellently flushed out and played, with dual, warmly human and wholly evil sides)  is a secondary aspect that provides, more than anything else, pace and excitement to accent the real story that moves with the slower pace a plot moved by character demands.  This is what good writing, the most important component of any story, in any media, is all about, and with all three Spiderman movies, the good writing prevails, opposite to so many or almost all movies of the genre which make the FX and the combat of villain and hero the centerpiece and wraps a plot, if a story, around that, resulting in another Hollywood failure added to the heap of such two-star-and-less failures.

Great casting also contributes to the effectiveness of character development and the story.  The more common, physical attributes of the two leads helps keep their lives down to earth, contributing to an aurora of believability that the viewer can buy into, which would have been greatly diminished if the producers would have filled the role of Parker with a Twilight-James-Dean incarnation (like James Franco, who plays Harry, Parker's friend) and MJ with a compatibly stunning beauty.  And the villains' characters are excellently brought to life by Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, and Thomas Haden Church.

The three movies of the first-generation Spiderman are all anyone could hope for, except to hope that the new generation will be produced with care that the same values making the first generation a stand-out will be in the fore of the minds of the writers, producers, and director.",1280793600,,2650,5.177570093457944

2911927,3,B000TYV3C6,"What could arguably be one of the greatest trilogy of films(easily in superhero films)to date comes to Blu Ray in a half hearted ""cash in"" release. I am a huge fan of these films and I already own the 2 disc DVD releases for each of the three installments. I was hoping for a definitive Blu Ray release when I bought this, but what I got was very good transfers with no new bonus material! To make matters worse the old bonus material and commentaries for the first two films were NOT even carried over! The only extra for those two films are trailers for two other films and both the first and second discs have the same two trailers on them!

Considering the space available on Blu Ray discs, I think this is shameful and insulting to fans. I'm all for moving forward with technology, but not at the expense of the consumer. ...so.......here we go again, first we introduce a new improved format, then we rush to release halfhearted editions, so they can release a better one a year or two later and the vicious cycle continues.

OK so now you get past that you will be keeping your original two disc DVD's because the bonus stuff is actually very good and well worth keeping on those editions. Now we get to the transfers, all three films show a very noticeable improvement, but the standard DVD releases look very good too and I'm not sure it warrants a double dip without the extras. The first film looks a bit grainy at times, with the second film looking much better. The sound is a big improvement on all three films. I just do not understand why the bonus stuff wasn't carried over for the first two films.  It would have made considering this release to buy a much easier decision.

My ratings for the films

Spider Man  - 4.6
The first film is creaky at times, but it is so much fun that I can forgive any flaws in it. It's got great characters, action, acting and heart, it's one of the best popcorn flicks you'll ever see. Tobey McGuire may not be the wisecracking Spidey we know from the comic book, but he is completely believable as the young teen with these strange new powers. Dafoe is perfectly cast as the Green Goblin even if the Goblin design could have been a little better. I also loved J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and Dunst, Robertson and Harris are great as M.J. and Uncle Ben and Aunt May. I know that some think there could have been a lot more development with Parker getting used to his new powers, but I believe this series was known to be a trilogy right from the get go and Raimi wanted to make Spider Man 2 all about the problems that would come with these powers and as we all know he pulled that one off in spades. When you think about the genius of how the first film was handled with Parker not giving much thought to the dangers of his new found gifts, it's a really good movie. I also love the ending of the film which I know also made all the ladies big fans of this film. There is nothing quite so bitter sweet as unrequited love. Besides being an extremely fun film it is also a very important film because super hero films were never taken too seriously until after this film made a ton of money.

Spider Man 2 - 4.9

Even though this is a superior film to the first, I like the first one better. That's not to say that this could quite possibly be the greatest super hero movie of all time! It's got everything a great super hero film needs, great story, acting, pacing, action,hero, villain, love interest and a touch of comedy. Spider Man 2 also develops the character and answers all the questions the first film didn't fully flesh out. I thought Alfred Molina (a guy I had never heard of at the time) was absolutely fantastic as ""Doc Ock"" . The FX look better and the fight scenes are more appropriate for our web slinging hero with high flying air battles, Spidey shooting web balls and a villain who looks much more like his comic book counter part. Besides having great action sequences Spider Man 2 also has a lot of heart and the love relationship and guilt issues keep this film from becoming just another super hero movie. The blend of drama and action would not be complete without a pinch of comedy which this film hits on every cylinder. Whether it's Spidey delivering pizza, taking an elevator ride or the hilarious use of the song 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' this film has some wonderful funny moments.

Spider Man 3 - 4.2

OK this one is for my Twin Andrew! I know this film has taken a beating and I would have to agree it is a disappointment. I really don't know how it couldn't be. It' just had too much to live up to. The biggest problem with this film for me is that Raimi didn't make it long enough. I think he knew this would be his last Spider Man film and he should have given this installment the length it needed to tie up all the loose ends from the first two films with the detail it deserved. I do think this is a very good film and only in the area of Venom does it seem rushed. I think Venom needed another 20-25 minutes of time in the film before joining forces with Sandman. this would have given this interesting character time to develop. Venom is a unique character in Web Heads Rogue Gallery and he deserved more than just an add on in this film. He's stronger than Spidey, he knows who Spidey is, he is immune to Spidey's Spider Sense. I think the possibilities are wasted here and I think the extra time would have made all the difference in the world. Considering all that is going on in the bloated finale, I do think Raimi does a good job of keeping things moving without becoming too confusing. I know there are many changes in the comic book history, but you have to expect that sort of thing when a comic book character makes a transition to film. I think Spider Man 3 is a very good film and a fitting end to the series even if a little too ambitious.

So overall this is a good set, but for me I would rather have the DVD editions with all the interesting bonus material than better looking films with no bonus material. I will keep both the DVD and the Blu Ray versions. The choice is up to the consumer, but be aware that there is surely a better version around the corner.",1277683200,4,6182,4.302405498281787

To be honest I was somewhat disappointed with the transfer although it looks obviously better than the DVD. The PQ is not as sharp as, say, T2 Judgement Day (1991) given that this is a recent (2002) movie. Once of the very noticeable thing watching this movie on blu ray is how crappy the CG for goblin on his glider was. I was unpleasently surprised certain goblin scenes look very cartoony - particularly the Times Square scenes. The blu ray is in fullscreen.

The boxset came with damaged corners thanks to the casual packing in a box but item arrived very fast (to Singapore).

2911933,5,B000TYV3C6,"In this first movie of the Spider-Man franchise (2002) director Sam Raimi did almost everything right. He concentrated on character development and character growth. Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker becomes a fully-realized person before our eyes. He's not a cardboard or cartoon character hero. He's vulnerable, innocent, a wide-eyed likeable person that we can empathize with. Orphaned, he lives with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) in a very modest Queens(?) home. He has a lifelong crush on the girl next door Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst).
 Bitten by a spider, he gets great powers that he uses to fight evil. Fighting the bad guys becomes a mission more important than his personal happiness and his love for Mary Jane. His wealthy friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) has a father Norm (Willem Dafoe) who because of an experiment gone awry becomes a nut case villain, the Green Goblin, who buzzes around on a flying machine like a sled. The two masked men, Spider and Goblin, go after each other and all heck breaks loose.
The subsidiary characters are well-done including J.K. Simmons as Peter's editor who thinks Spider-Man is a menace. Uncle Ben is instrumental in carving out a career for Spider-Man/Peter.
Spectacular scenes of Spider aloft weaving in and out through the Manhattan canyons are memorable along with the Roosevelt tram episode.
This movie surmounts its action-oriented genre, and creates believable people. Toby's acting is a key to the movie's success and its artistry. Enough teasers and unfinished business was left in this one to spawn sequels and perhaps even a Broadway musical.",1256947200,,1633,5.116104868913857

2911936,4,B000TYV3C6,"""Spider-Man"" was arguably the first modern super-hero comic book. It demonstrated how a fundamentally idiotic idea (attaining super powers from the bite of a radioactive spider has been mercilessly parodied) could work, if the story resonated with the readers. Lee and Ditko had the sense to make the hero a geeky teenager who has super powers thrust on him, without the experience or wisdom to know what to do. The parallel with the transition from puberty to maturity is obvious, but it works. ""Spider-Man"" was probably the biggest single influence in moving comic books away from melodrama and toward drama.

Sam Raimi, a director notorious for over-the-top silliness, would seem the least-likely choice for such material, but he handles it perfectly. The focus is firmly on Peter's relationships with his family and Mary-Jane, even in the third film (which has too many villains, and too many plot lines to tie up). It's underplayed, with Maguire's performance convincingly shy without being sappy. He might be a geek, but he's no dork. Rosemary Harris is especially fine as everyone's idea of the perfect nuturing aunt. Her performance is much better than it has to be.

The only unbelievable character is J Jonah Jameson, but then, he was over-the-top in the comics, too; no Perry White, he. J K Simmons (perhaps best-known as the bisexual Nazi murderer-rapist in HBO's ""Oz"") shows he's just as good at comedy, nailing the character. (No jokes, please.)

If the Spider-Man films have a problem, it's that there's a limited number of feats a super hero can perform, and only so many emotional conflicts a human being can experience. Not surprisingly, their situations and story arcs are uncomfortably like those in the first three Superman films: Peter swings up to catch Mary Jane as she falls (he later repeats the act with his aunt). He abandons his super-identify because it interferes with what he most wants out of life. People ""on the street"" aid him when he's in trouble. He even loses and regains his super powers. And in the third film, Gwen Stacy's inevitable fall from a building is so close to Lois Lane's helicopter fall (with the mic cable replaced by a telephone cord) that it verges on plagiarism. Not to mention that, as in S3, a drastic change in the hero's personality is a central plot element. Whether or not this is conscious copying, it does give an uncomfortable sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, which is why I've awarded these well-done and entertaining films only four stars.

I can't resist pointing out that, as with most super-hero films, there is an utter disregard for the laws of physics. Worse, the animators don't understand one of the most-basic: F = ma. Objects and people move almost instantly from rest to motion (or back), which is not only unrealisitc, but impossible. (Disney had a good grasp of this 70 years ago. Digital animators don't seem to have caught it. Note, for example, how Shrek moves as if his body is massless.) S-M3 also overlooks e = mv^2/2 -- there's no way a swinging crane could crack a building's girders.

The Blu-ray transfers are of the high quality one expects. (They /ought/ to be -- Sony owns Columbia.) The second film includes the extended ""2.1"" version. I don't believe there's any supplemental material that hasn't already appeared on the DVDs.",1243382400,,3321,4.912655971479501

2911940,5,B000TYV3C6,"The Spider-Man trilogy has enthralled audiences and made comic book fanboys like myself so happy to see our beloved webslinger on the big screen. Here, we have the (so far) definitive Blu Ray release of the trilogy. We have Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2, and Spider-Man 3. All in all, it's a 4 disc set. Now, since it's in high definition, we can expect perfect picture and sound right? In this case, oh yes. The Spider-Man trilogy is a perfect showcase of the richness and power of high definition video and the capabilities of the Blu Ray format. It's sad to say that there are only a handful of Blu Ray releases that actually look great and this set is no exception.

First off, the video presentation is superb. I watched the films on my Sony BD-S350 Blu Ray player in 1080p (HDMI) on my new Toshiba Regza 42"" television with a Bose 5.1 surround sound system, just for reference. Spidey 1 is presented in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio with part 2 and 3 in 2.40:1 ratio. The films are filled with special effects and the 1080p transfer delivers the goods. Definition and depth be clearly seen in the actor's faces and even their clothes. You can really see the depth of the fibers in Mary Jane's green sweater at the laboratory field trip, it's that good. Flesh tones and black levels are fantastic and the films feel alive. If you thought the DVDs looked good, you'll see them as obsolete upon viewing the Blu Ray versions. DVDs do not do any justice to the films. The scenes of Spidey swinging through New York just look amazing and Venom in part 3 just looks fantastic. All in all, this is a MUST BUY for Spidey fans and just to show off your fancy Blu Ray player.

The audio is presented in PCM tracks and actually sounds better if not as good as TrueHD audio encode. The 5.1 mix is superb and allows great clarity of the voices, action, and music. The sounds just emit from the speakers with such vibrant resonance that you feel that you are swinging with Spidey around New York. Overall, the audio is dynamic and warm and will sound great with your home theater setup.

Next, we have the special features. One of the letdowns of this set is the lack of special features for films 1 and 2. Spidey 3 includes the second disc of special features found in the DVD set and stand alone Blu Ray copies. Although, Spider-Man 2 does feature the extended Spider-Man 2.1 which I believe is just as good if not much better than the theatrical cut. Spidey 3 features 11 behind-the-scenes featurettes going over the villains, the stunt work, and the sets. Seeing how Sandman and Venom were brought to life in intriguing. All in all, it's a shame that the extras from 1 and 2 didn't make it here, so I guess it's good I kept my DVDs.

Final words, it's a must buy. I can't recommend this set enough. Spider-Man 1 and 2 are landmark achievements and amazing films whereas part 3 was just cluttered with too much plot and an incoherent story ( I really hoped that they would redo this one but alas, they didn't). Even if you don't like part 3 ( I actually liked it for the action and effects), it's still enjoyable and you'll want to watch it when it looks this good. This is definitely a perfect way to show off Blu Ray, other than a nice CG animated movie or another special effects-ladened movie. Movie and comic fans alike will enjoy this box set and plus, it's the only way to get part 1 and 2 on Blu Ray. I give the video a 5/5, the audio a 5/5 and the extras a 3/5. the overall box is a 5/5 and a must buy.",1234137600,,3492,4.351226993865031
2911941,5,B000TYV3C6,"Anyone looking to purchase this trilogy is already a fan of the SPIDERMAN movies and wants to know how they stand up in the magic of blu ray.  We all know that the original SPIDERMAN was an amzing film - a rare treat of exemplary action with superb acting for a change.  Tobey Maguire and cast finally brought to the comic action movie acting ability that made the film believable.  With Tobey Maguire was born Peter Parker/Spdiderman.  We also know that with SPIDERMAN 2 the same cast and crew came together with a film that far surpassed the hugely succesful and critically acclaimed original to be the best in the trilogy.  All that was good in the first was raised many notches.  SPIDERMAN 3 was still a good film but certainly not a match for 1 and 2.  Very enjoyable but a little lackluster in comparison.

Now for the blu ray test. All I can say is AMAZING.  The source they are working from on the original is not as superb as the other two which makes the picture quality slightly grainy in its 1080p hd presentation.  But this in no means is a bad thing.  It is still a very vivid picture with blacks and colors strongly presented.  You quickly get used to the slight grain and the film becomes the best presentation you will ever see of it.  With SPIDERMAN 2 the caliber raises.  All grain is gone and the picture remains crystal clear and vibrant throughout.  All fight/action scenes are awesome and the entire film will leave you breathless.  SPIDERMAN 3 has  a picture of the great quality the same as the second film and it helps immensely to raise the quality of the film itself much higher for you will be in awe watching the richness and awe striking special effects.

With all three films the English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio is of the highest quality.  Dialogue is strong and crisp with all speakers in strong, heavy use for action sequences and it seems even the smallest scenes manage to work the rear speakers which is rare.  These three films are at their best here and perfectly made for the high standards of blu ray.  You cannot imagine how great these films appear in blu ray till you actually see them for yourself.  You will never be able to view them another way again.

I do agree that the only flaw with this set is the absence of substantial special features.  They do provide the 2nd disc with SPIDERMAN 3 that is all features but do not have it for SPIDERMAN 1 or 2.  Having all this would have made the set perfect.  So it is not perfect but it still cannot make me lower my 5 star rating for the blu ray presentation of these films is exemplary.

I actually never bought Spiderman 3 on DVD as to me, it is Spiderman's ""Batman forever"".

In the box:

Spiderman (1 disc)
Spiderman 2 and 2.1 (1 disc)
Spiderman 3 (2 discs, feature film and bonus features)

While the movies look and sound incredible on Bluray, Spiderman 1 and 2 have no extras whatsoever! For a trilogy set so eagerly anticipated by fans, Sony put very little effort in this release. Yes, they released the movies in full HD but got rid of all the extras on 1 and 2! Only Spiderman 3 has a bonus disc and like I said before, is my least favorite of the three. The documentaries, easter eggs (like Alfred Molina dressed as Doc Oc performing ""If I were a rich man"") and bonus features from the first two are not in the trilogy boxset!

I bought this set when it was first released and all that I did was to preview them.  That is, I looked at the picture quality and sound quality.  They are both excellent!  I still have not watched them through on BD, but I saw enough to give the highest marks.

I only speak on BD quality, not the films.  If I must, then I would say that the Mary Jane being caputred and held as bait should not be the plot point for all three films, but it is.  In the comic books, Spiderman did not spend any where as much time with Mary Jane as in the movies.  She was hardly ever involved with exploits.  I hope that the next film reduces Mary Jane's role, does not have the villian holding a Gwen Stacey hostage as bait for Spiderman(it will kill the series), and it would not be a bad ideas to follow the comics and have Spidey battle non-traditional Spidey foes such as Dr. Doom, The Punisher (that would have been a good way to tie-in a NEW Punsiher film - think!) or the Leader.

This set is a must buy and is probably (along with Casino Royale and politics) why Blu Ray won the war.",1227398400,,1192,4.139130434782609

2911956,3,B000TYV3C6,"...since the movies in the trilogy deserve their own reviews and have been done to death already.  The low cost (even lower by $10 since I bought it) is what motivated me to buy this blu-ray disc set.  I already have the special editions of all three Spiderman movies on DVD, so I wanted to see what blu-ray would bring to the home theater table, having recently bought a PS3.  True, the picture quality is awesome and the audio certainly will blow you away.  However, there are hardly any special features - only the third disc has any to speak of.  This is an underwhelming effort, considering the massive amount of space availalble on blu-ray discs. Compare, for example, the featurettes and even mini-movies on ""I Am Legend"".

One thing I discovered about audio selection: if you choose PCM and your receiver is not capable of processing uncompressed signals (my Onkyo only does HDMI pass-through), all you'll get is simulated surround (e.g. Dolby ProLogic).  So I ended up with 5.1 and although it may not be true HD, it's good enough for my 7.1 setup.  But if you're an audiophile you would have known about this already.

My summary - HD picture quality: a strong 4 stars, audio quality and options: 4 stars, special features: a dismal 1 star - hence the overall 3 star rating.  I guess for the price, this set is not too bad, but considering the wealth of possibilities for the Spiderman franchise, it fell short of my expectations.",1208390400,120,1440,4.6561264822134385

2911968,4,B000TYV3C6,"I purchased this product shortly after it was released on Blu-ray.  Now I am rating the blu-ray experience more than anything else, because it is a blu-ray trilogy.  I am not a movie critic (atleast I don't get paid for it) and the Spidey movies have been out for a while-we all know if we like them or don't.

On blu-ray these movies looks amazing.  I have a 1080i DLP (4 years old), Playstation 3, and XBOX 360 Elite with HD drive.  I run higher end HDMI from Monster Cable, as well as Monster optical for sound.  I have a 7.1 surround sound home theater and a 250W sub pushing the base.  Not the best setup but absloutely satisfying.

The clarity of the blu-ray discs is amazing.  Now, that isn't to say that every release is worthy of the new technology, but for this release it is.  The special effects are clear and crisp.  The sound is wonderful.  Just to make sure I was enjoying every little bit of my new experience, I watched the movies on regular DVD before putting in my BD's and I have to say that in some parts of the movie I heard sounds that were not audible before.  It is like night and day.

We can complain all we want about the content of the last installment in the trilogy, but what is done is done.  Yeah, I know that the character development was lacking in 3.  Yes, I agree that Topher Grace was a terrible choice for Venom/Eddie Brock... but this is about the technical side..

1. Price is a steal for 3 dvds (even if you own 1 of the movies this is still a better bargain than buying separately)
2. The 1st and 2nd movies are worth buying this set (both of which can cost you around $30)
3. Each dvd has a bonus dvd
4. It comes with a box to hold all 3 dvds

Note: I awarded 2 stars for the 1st reason if you were wondering why I gave it 5 stars

Conclusion: If you are a fan of the series and do not own any of the dvds, this is the set to get.  Even if you own at least 1 of the movies already, getting this set will save you from purchasing the dvds separately.",1198022400,,770,3.6707317073170733

If you're thinking of buying these movies in HD I'm sure you've seen them already in some other format so I won't bother reviewing the films themselves. The reason I gave these DVDs 4 stars instead of 5, however, is because of the complete lack of extras on the first two movies.

2911994,4,B000TYV3C6,"I won't bother to review the movies here--there's plenty of reviews for that.  Instead, I'm just going to give a quick overview of what to expect from the Blu-Ray trilogy.

First, SPIDER-MAN 3 is the same release as the double-disc Blu-Ray stand-alone version.  It has lots of special features, commentaries, an extras disc, etc.  The movie itself looks very, very good (video quality).

It's SPIDER-MAN 1&2 where the set takes a hit.  Again, video quality is excellent.  SPIDER-MAN 2 includes the ""2.1"" cut (via seamless branching, meaning you can watch the theatrical or the new version off the same disc) with extra scenes, including at least one that is VERY funny.

However, what you lose are ALL the extras from the SM 1&2 DVD releases.  No commentaries, no deleted scenes (other than ""2.1""), no ""makings-of"", etc.  To me, this was more than disappointing.  It's almost criminal.  I expected many of the old items to appear in standard-def.  Only one bonus blu-ray disc would have been required to hold every single non-commentary special feature, as BD's have 50GB of space compared to 9GB for a standard DVD.  Why skimp here, Sony?

Ultimately, this is the best way to view the movies.  They look AMAZING.  The extras in this set, however, are underwhelming, to say the least.  You're getting everything you need for SM3, but the first two films are severely shortchanged.",1193702400,7,1380,4.926086956521739
