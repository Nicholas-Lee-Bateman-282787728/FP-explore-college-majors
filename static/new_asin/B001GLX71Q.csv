3614964,5,B001GLX71Q,"I am so glad that this is out. I have most of these episodes on tape but to see them in great quality is super! What I am curious about is if we are going to get a big surprise if a second volume comes out called ""The ABC Years 1971-1975"" This would be a great release but the ABC episodes are presumed to be lost. The UCLA TV archive has about 10 episodes and GSN has ran 1 episode from the 1973 season with Jack Klugman and Brett Somers. There is also an episode from 1972 with Sheila MacCrae and Martin Milner that exists as well. Let's keep our fingers crossed and if you love classic game shows, this is a keeper!",1229299200,5,618,4.032520325203252
3614965,4,B001GLX71Q,"Ah, the celebrities, the clothes, the carefree Allen Ludden...What's uncanny about the disc is you end up getting caugt up in playing the game along with the contestants and what you're watching is over 40 years old! The money isn't even worth the same.
Who knew Jerry Lewis was on Password to plug his movie Way Way Out with Connie Stevens? Jerry looks upset when he's getting aced out of points and is his silly self when he's winning. He constantly has this look on his face that seems to say, ""Why am I here?""
Woody Allen is smart and charming and James Mason is there just weeks before Lolita would be released.
I've always played this game with my hand covering the answer and hitting mute when it's revealed to the home audience.
The password is: ""Purchase.""",1228694400,,765,4.550724637681159
3614966,5,B001GLX71Q,"I was dissapointed by the release of Family Feud as they didn't give you complete shows or all of the stars listed. So imagine my suprise when The Best of Password came out. I've only looked at 2 of the 4 discs so far, but they appear to be complete shows in excellent quality with loads of great guest stars. Kudos to BCI! I'm already looking forward to volume two!",1228262400,7,366,4.242857142857143
3614967,4,B001GLX71Q,"OK I know it's not out yet, and this is why I am leaving one star open.  But I must give it four for the idea alone...Password is one of the game show greats in its many formats, and is very deserving of the BCI treatment (as Match Game, Family Feud, and Price is Right have received so far).  And better still to go back to the beginning with the original version, which you actually don't even see on GSN now.

Keep 'em coming BCI!",1224374400,,433,4.070588235294117
3614968,5,B001GLX71Q,I enjoyed watching this while I used my eliptical. It helped to pass the time and I enjoyed the different stars on there.,1360886400,2,121,4.304347826086956
3614969,5,B001GLX71Q,"Considering how long ago this program aired, it is great quality. I loved this program when I was young, and I love this program now that I am older! I loved seeing all the movie/tv stars again! Simple game to play, but getting those answers not always so simple! One program from the set had Betty White as the guest star contestant, and she had, evidently, just married Allen Ludden, the host of the show. She was so pretty, but she's pretty now, too...just older.",1354752000,,466,4.4941176470588236
3614970,5,B001GLX71Q,"THE BEST OF PASSWORD (DVD): Few game shows trotted out more big name TV stars, singers and bona fide film legends in the name of intellectual fun than PASSWORD. The cerebral, fast paced series courted one word clues in order to deduce a secret term whispered by an off screen announcer; home particpation was not only encouraged, it was downright addictive. ALLEN LUDDEN, certainly one of the most congenial and best liked of all game show hosts, always seemed to be in total control, whether administering the rules, plugging his special guests' latest projects, or commenting on the often hilarious clues and answers inherent to the program. Pairing up celebrities with regular folk, the series attracted the likes of JACK BENNY, LUCILLE BALL, JERRY LEWIS, SAMMY DAVIS JR., CAROL BURNETTE, GENE KELLY, DICK VAN DYKE, JOAN CRAWFORD, PAUL ANKA, JIMMY STEWART, and LUDDEN's perky spouse BETTY WHITE, who all appear in this 32 episode edition. The emphasis was on teamwork and crafty deduction rather than gaudy prizes and shrieking contestants, making PASSWORD the one game show everyone admitted tuning into and no celebrity was ever embarrassed to be seen on.

RATING: FIVE LIGHTNING ROUNDS",1348444800,,1191,5.139175257731959
3614971,5,B001GLX71Q,This is a classic game show and has been done in various forms throughout the years like Password Plus Super Password and Million Dollar Password. All those are good and so is this which is the original Password. The only thing tough about it is that the clues had to be one word. I snached this up as I did DVDs of other game shows and its not a disappointment. You might be disappointed if you don't get it and trust me you should.,1338163200,,433,4.166666666666667
3614972,5,B001GLX71Q,"I bought this wonderful set at a local video store for $5.00. It was WELL WORTH it!
The folks at Mill Creek know where to get winners! And THIS one is no exception. I am a major fan of 1960's TV...back when TV WAS TV!
The quality is great for films this old.
Crystal clear sound and sensational video.
ANY fan of this show or others from the 1960's will LOVE this set.
BELIEVE ME! I don't go out there and waste my money!
WAY TO GO MILL CREEK!",1277337600,8,443,3.9887640449438204
3614973,5,B001GLX71Q,"Nice to see this old game show on dvd. Remembering watching this program on tv back in the 60's... A classic, a must buy!",1275868800,,121,4.083333333333333
3614974,4,B001GLX71Q,"This is a great trip back in the ""Wayback Machine"" that even Mr. Peabody and Sherman would approve of.
Love the sponsor tags at the beginning and end of each episode. And look for Allen Ludden doing a live read for Bufferin in some of the black and white episodes. Enjoy!",1275177600,,271,4.333333333333333
3614975,5,B001GLX71Q,"If you do not own this, or any other previous releases, this DVD is not a bunch of crock! These are original classic episodes featuring Betty White, Carol Burnett, and many more! This is a must for any game show fan!",1273449600,13,216,4.2926829268292686
3614976,1,B001GLX71Q,"I bought this, thinking it was an additional volume of episodes of the one I bought that was released in 2008. In fact, it's the same episodes, with 2 missing from the earlier edition.
Obviously, I wouldn't have bought this if I had known it was the same thing. Also, the title has been altered slightly. The first one I bought mentions the years 1962-1957. This new volume says 1961-1967, so naturally I thought new episodes were being released. So, as I said, What a Crock to the eggheads who released this in a misleading manner. Beware.",1265328000,19,540,4.577319587628866
3614977,4,B001GLX71Q,"I've always been a fan of word games, so when this DVD set came out I snatched it up. What a cavalcade of stars. Garry Moore, Carol Burnett, Joan Crawford, Eddie Albert, Lucille Ball, Sammy Davis, Peter Lawford, Jack Benny, and the list goes on. Password was a simple game that almost anyone could play, and this collection proves it. Host Allen Ludden, with his trademark glasses and gestures. I'm sure he's smiling from up above. The list of celebs should be enough for anyone to want to grab this piece of TV nostalgia, if you can find it. My set is fine and doesn't have any audio sync problems, like some other reviewers noted.",1255824000,,632,4.504347826086956
3614978,4,B001GLX71Q,"I think the 1967 slates may be because these are likely copies from the edited, syndicated reruns of the CBS network run of Password that local stations ran from 1967-69.  The slates are probably related to either the editing or for reference by the local stations running the show.  Presumably, the uncut versions of the daytime Password don't exist -- they certainly chopped them up rather jarringly for syndication and it would be great to see them with the original sponsor plugs and Allen's commercial tosses.  Nonetheless, this is a special treat for game show fans, especially those of us who grew up with the erudite, gentlemanly Mr. Ludden and this addictive, classic word association game (I grew up on the glitzy 70's ABC version).  Nice mix of prime time and daytime versions with quite the galaxy of stars, including Elizabeth Montgomery, Carol Burnett, and Dick Van Dyke, all with a very sophisticated 1960's air. *sigh* I always wanted to play the Lightning Round.",1248825600,2,979,4.951219512195122
3614979,5,B001GLX71Q,Received the product quickly and in excellent condition.  Watching the old shows is great entertainment.,1247184000,,104,5.933333333333334
3614980,1,B001GLX71Q,"I had been told by another collector that the prints on GSN were better than the prints on this DVD set but didn't believe it.  I got the set today and, yep, he was right.  The prints -- which are currently being aired on GSN this week as a matter of fact -- are much better, than the same ones here on this expensive set.  The GSN prints are much clearer, brighter and more vivid.

I also noticed the same errors in the dates as someone else noted.  We all know ""Family Affair"" made its debut in September of 1966 and not November of 1967.

To many the quality of nostaglic television doesn't matter to them.  But to purists like myself, we notice things like this and it can ruin the thrill.  If you're among the latter, I'd rent the set from Netflix yourself to see what we're talking about.",1239580800,2,794,4.246666666666667
3614981,4,B001GLX71Q,"What's up with Disc Four? This package was obviously taped to hype CBS' upcoming fall premiere week of 1966 (ie, Green Acres' Eddie Albert, first seen in 1965, chatters about his show's new ""second"" season; other series stars' comments about how long their series have been on air reflect same '66 season)--but all slateboard shots at beginning of these Password episodes indicate shows were shot in November 1967. (Not only is the year wrong but, back then, virtually all shows began new seasons in September--not November.) A check of imdb credits verifies these shows were indeed first broadcast in 1966. Were slates shot after the fact and spliced onto episodes in sloppy attempt to add ""historic"" value? Baffling.

Also, surprising to see how many passwords (barbecue, grouchy, oysters, etc.) were recycled season after season.",1237852800,,832,5.208955223880597
3614982,5,B001GLX71Q,I highly recommend Password to everyone to watch!  Password remains my favorite game show .  It is such a treat to once again watch Allen Ludden be the outstanding host he was.  It is as if he never left us.  And how marvelous to see once again so many wonderful celebrities many of whom are no longer with us.  It is so much fun as a viewer to play along as well.  This is a must see for anyone who longs for good old fashioned entertainment.  They don't make them like this show anymore.  I am transported back to my childhood watching these classic episodes of Password.,1234569600,2,573,4.289719626168225
3614983,5,B001GLX71Q,"This is really an amazing collection.  Really big stars of the day.  The later versions of Password were good, but they didn't seem to attract the same high caliber of celebrities.  And then of course there's the wonderful Allen Ludden.  Awesome!",1234483200,,246,4.926829268292683

3614985,4,B001GLX71Q,"Surprised that there are a ton of typos on the back inside covers of the DVDs and on the actual episode menu [Eydie Gorme fans will wince]  On the other hands, the DVDs are a joy to watch with a surprising funny [and scared] Joan Crawford, a charming Polly Bergen and Janet Leigh, YOUNG Jane Fonda, cute Laurence Harvey, and sassy Betty White and Carol Burnett play the game.  I doubt another volume will come out so pounce!",1230854400,2,424,4.423076923076923
3614986,5,B001GLX71Q,"I was born decades after this show aired but I love it. The celebrities are classy and the contestants are clearly enjoying themselves. Some of the celebrities are still famous today, including names like Dick Van Dyke, Johnny Carson, James Mason, Jane Fonda, Joan Crawford, Betty White, Sammy Davis Jr, Lucille Ball, Paul Anka, and Carol Burnett. Even the lesser-known stars have lots of personality. The contestants don't win much but that doesn't matter, in fact the word-game is actually quite addictive and can be played at home. I hope more episodes are released on DVD, including the eight 1970's episodes stored at the UCLA. Still, these 32 1960's episodes are a blast.",1230681600,3,677,5.0
3614987,2,B001GLX71Q,"There is no substitute for ""Password"" in the Goodson-Todman archive when it comes to ""star power"".  It was the first show to pair ""civilians"" with celebrities, and was one of the most challenging (and entertaining) game shows that ever aired.  So it's particularly painful to have to give this set such a low mark, particularly when it's based on easily avoidable technical concerns in the presentation.

The worst problem with this DVD set is in the conversion for tape to disc-- although ""Password"" was preserved on beautifully crisp quad videotapes (particularly the black-and-white episodes), you'd never know it to watch this set.  Unfortunately, the tapes have been transferred as 30 fps progressive images, instead of their original interlaced format.  This unnecessary de-interlacing not only has the abysmal consequence of softening the image, but also results in any sudden motion causing a flickery, ""flutter"" in the moving parts of the image, which thoroughly robs the program of its live ""video look"".  While still highly enjoyable in terms of content, the visual presentation is now noticeably degraded.

The disc authoring also leaves much to be desired... on my players, the video is stuttery for the first minute of each episode, and then slowly settles down and corrects itself as the episode unwinds.

So caveat emptor, ""Password"" fans-- with the recent shutdown of BCI (the company that issued this set) the problems in this set are never going to be fixed... but if you don't mind the quality compromises, there is still a lot to like.  It **is** ""Password"", after all...!!",1230508800,12,1594,5.147286821705427

8305925,4,B001GLX71Q,"This is a blasty. First of all the game is great but we get to see the stars who played who are now legends. JAmes Mason, Jane onda (at 19) Lucille Ball and her family, a young Johnny Carson and a young Bob Newhart. There's Betty white in her late 20's after onlyt TWO
 television series. We see Robert poreston and Olivia De Haviland, Gary Moore and a string of people who are remarkable.

8305926,3,B001GLX71Q,"This DVD is good only because it's about the only DVD of classic Password out there. Unfortunately, the particular episodes that were selected are certainly not the best. I think whomever made this complication looked for the most famous celebrities and did not take into consideration the actual game play. Many of the celebrities are quite famous (Joan Crawford, Lucille Ball, etc.), but they were not good Password players, and thus the playing of the game leaves a lot to be desired.",1389398400,4,487,4.951219512195122
