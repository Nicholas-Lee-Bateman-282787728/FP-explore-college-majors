2438635,2,B000BRBAD8,"Here are the similarities between Ian Rankin's John Rebus and the character as portrayed by John Hannah:

1) They're both Scotsmen.
2) ...Well actually there are no more similarities.

Don't get me wrong, Hannah's a terrific actor, I've always enjoyed him, but he's simply not the John Rebus I've come to know through Rankin's superb crime series.  He's not tough enough, angry enough, drunk enough, sad enough and -- perhaps most importantly -- certainly not funny enough.  None of Rankin's dry, stinging wit is anywhere in evidence here.  And I have to agree with the prior reviewer who said that the stories move way too fast, cramming too much plot into too little time.  At least they got Cafferty right, he's pretty much as I imagined him.  (Although just think what Brian Cox could do with the role!)  I'm off to check out the later Rebus series.  At least from the packaging that actor looks more the part.",1165795200,22,914,4.734177215189874
2438636,5,B000BRBAD8,"Great introduction to Ian Rankins character brought to life.  For many people who have a problem with British accents this may be in places had to decipher but once you get into the cadence (rhythm) of the speach it flows quickly.  Many will remember the lead actor as the smart mouth side kick from The Mummy, but this was his second BBC scotland show. the first was Maccallum.

2438638,5,B000BRBAD8,"Loving the character and the writing style, I read every available Rankin Rebus novel-- checking out screenplay was inevitable.  At first expecting to meet the buffoonish brother-in-law co-star from the Mummy, I was delighted to meet Rankin's John Rebus, AKA John Hannah. If you like the Rebus novels, then you'll enjoy these Rebus movies.  One caveat:  if you're new to Rebus, you might wish first to read the novel upon which the screenplay is based, avoiding potential confusion created by the quick pace, Rankin's complex plots, or the Scottish accents.  Enjoy!",1155513600,27,565,5.175824175824176
2438639,5,B000BRBAD8,"With wonderfully complex plots and recurring characters, Rebus is an absolutely first-rate crime drama based on the novels by Scottish author Iain Rankin.  Though set in Edinburgh, it is not the charming, picturesque, historic old city as seen by the casual visitor that we are privy to; rather, the viewer is taken on a journey through the dark, gritty, cankerous underbelly of what, on the surface, is one of Britain's loveliest old cities.  This is a series peopled by characters who are all too human, and it holds back no punches in its realistic portrayal of the criminal world.

Detective Inspector John Rebus (John Hannah (McCallum)) is one of the most curious, indeed fascinating, DIs I've come across.  He's a competent and committed police officer, but a flawed human being with his own set of personal demons with which he must contend.  He's a deep, multi-faceted character for whom nothing is black and white, and he's not immune to making serious errors in judgement, to lying in order to achieve his objective, or to experiencing the temptation of a ""pact with the devil.""  He often makes decisions which shock the viewer, for we know that, even though we may understand his motivation, they are decisions which would never be condoned by the police.  Indeed, is it any wonder he drinks a little too much and has more than a little trouble sleeping?  Nor are we surprised to find that he has more than a little trouble forming and holding on to relationships with women.

Rebus is a wonderfully rich, dynamic, and interesting character, and I personally felt that John Hannah did a superb job in bringing him to life.  I don't know why Hannah left the series or if he did any more series after this one, but I do know that I prefer these episodes and Hannah's portrayal much more than the recent pair of episodes wherein Ken Stott has taken over the title role (I just didn't warm to the character as portrayed by Stott).

The set consists of four 100-minute episodes and a very interesting dvd extra on the making of the series, which features informative comments about the nature of the series and the character of Rebus by both John Hannah and Iain Rankin.

In conclusion, this is a series I recommend unhesitatingly to fans of British mysteries and crime drama in general.  There may be less in the way of comic relief, but I would still say that if you enjoy shows like A Touch of Frost or Delziel and Pascoe, chances are you'll really enjoy this one.

Highly recommended!",1151107200,62,2494,4.703448275862069
2438640,5,B000BRBAD8,"What is amazing about this production is that even though many of the story elements are changed, the strength of each story is preserved in it's essence.  I have read most of this series and over time come to love the character of Rebus.  He is truly a 'real' person, with all the foibles and warts of each of us.  He is terrible at interpersonal relationships, and is at his best when he is doing everything in his power, not to show emotion.

Though he did not write the screenplays, Ian Rankin was very much involved in the making of these teleplays (see the secion on the Making of Rebus for his comments), and you can see his deft touch in the minor changes that are made.  Siobhan Clark is supposed to be attractive, in her late twenties, with an Scots/English accent; the actress who plays her is none of these.  Brian Holmes is nowhere to be found, and neither is Dr Patience Aikens.  But the actors who plays Big Ger Cafferty and the 'Weasel' are spot on.

Hannah as Rebus is able to show a great understanding of the character, who is as grey and tough as his home city.  My only complaint is that he is a little young for the aging Rebus who should be in his late forties.  A minor complaint.  Another is the plethora of Scots accents; it's hard enough trying to guess what some of the words mean, without trying to figure out what people are saying.  But, I guess they wanted authenticity since it was made for Scottish TV, and didn't care what us Yanks understood.  Ya think I can get a version with subtitles!",1149811200,4,1524,4.361702127659575
2438641,4,B000BRBAD8,"Like others who have reviewed this DVD I have read all of Ian Rankin's work, and enjoyed them mightily.  Rebus is one of my favorite crime/mystery creations, right up there with Andy Dalziel, Miss Marple and Thomas Lynley, so when I saw a video version was finally available in the States I was ecstatic.

The storyline is fairly true to the books, and the grittiness of the Edinburgh setting is a wonderful change from some of the more homogenized crime stories - this *feels* real.

I only have two issues with this dramatization, and one is not uncommon with any attempt to turn a rich, complicated and full-length novel into a two hour program:  because the time they have available on the screen is so short EVERY plot twist and piece of evidence always connects up serially, and, in the end, seems unlikely.  This is not confined to the Rebus stories, clearly, as many other dramatizations have the same trouble (specifically the Elizabeth George ""Inspector Lynley Mysteries."") It merely leaves me feeling a bit short-changed, after having enjoyed these novels so much, to blast through them at speed, and be left feeling just a bit cheated.

My other issue with this DVD was the casting of Hannah in the title role.  Perhaps it is just me, but I found him an odd choice, and lacking the age, depression and simple world-weariness which is so much a part of the literary Rebus.  As I said, perhaps this is merely my problem, and I cannot separate him from his previous comedy roles, but I am looking forward to seeing the next DVDs, and whomever they might have cast in his place.

I wouldn't have missed this DVD, and I enjoyed seeing Rebus come to life, but it did not live up to my very high expectations of the novels involved.",1146528000,11,1737,4.613636363636363

The scenes are gritty and seems realistic.  There is some violence but it's not overdone.  And yes, your ears have to adjust to the accents, but it's worth the trouble.

The plots are complex but seem to stay true to the book they are based on.  It does help to have read the book first but you can still enjoy this series even if you haven't.

2438667,4,B000BRBAD8,"I've read a lot of the Rebus mysteries and my mind formed some indistinct vision of what Rebus must be like:  weathered, a bit alcohol soaked, raw from abuse even in his forties, a little like Morse (John Thaw) without the classical culture but sophisticated in his own form.  Well, John Hannah's a good actor, very talented, but he doesn't look anything like what was in my mind; then again, his acting provided a Rebus who acted like what was in my mind.  A draw.  The casting of Siobhan was a disaster for me but in the one I watched, she didn't appear much and that helped to minimize the distraction.  And I only watched one and that was one I had read so I could follow it easily.  I can't really say how clearly the plot is presented since I read it but it was obscure enough that I'm waiting to watch the others until I've read them to make sure I can follow them.  The accents were less of a problem than I anticipated from Hannah's accent in other movies, e.g., Sliding Doors.  Some Rebus books spend a fair amount of time with the plots, with the logic of detection and in some the crime and discovery are almost peripheral to the characters' interior monologues.  I wouldn't want to be the producer or director trying to figure out what to do with these things although I'm glad someone took the chance; whatever you might choose to do, you'll produce a failure on some level.  Taking that into account, I'm happy I've purchased these DVDs and would do it again and, if you're realistic about what these can be, you should too.  One review said that the next series with a different actor playing Rebus were ""sunnier"" (or some word to that effect); what a horror to think of that.  The point of a Rebus procedural (as I make it out) is that clinging to morality in a dirty and compromised world is a nasty business where you get dirty and compromised yourself.  There's nothing pleasant about that and all victories then are partial and wry.  One must dare even to think one might be moral in this environment; one must be frustrated to try; it's hardly surprising that one would turn to alcohol to live with that frustration.  The Rebus you get from Hannah gives you this life even if he doesn't quite look like what your imagination gave you from reading the book.  Hannah's a good enough actor and these presentations are dark enough that if you buy into what's on the screen (suspending disbelief on a few levels), you'll be fine.",1315872000,,2446,4.462921348314607

2438671,4,B000BRBAD8,"Rebus the DVD is a fairly accurate adaptation of Ian Rankin's story and will only disappoint those looking for perfection in the minutiae of the story and John Hannah's portrayal of the slightly off, but intrepid character, DI John Rebus. For even though John Hannah's performance is absolutely splendid, it is the Rebus of the adaptation, and not an exact copy of the character as drawn by Ian Rankin's pen.

In truth, I'm a reader and fan of the novels and it didn't bother me at all. Any bit of license the show's creators took was more than compensated for by keeping the production entirely in the city of Edinburgh, which as every reader knows, is the real antagonist in the Rankin DI Rebus stories.

As a fan of crime fiction televison exported to the US from the UK, I was delighted to find this unknown to me Scottish police mini-series and quite satisfied with the purchase after viewing.",1214611200,,898,4.6415094339622645
2438672,3,B000BRBAD8,"The Scottish-made television series ""Rebus,"" filmed in that country and starring local boy John Hannah as the title character, made its TV debut in 2000.  It's based on the well-known series of the same name by Ian Rankin, who's now the most popular crime writer in the British Isles. Rankin is, of course, considered the founding father of the Scottish tartan noir school of mystery writing: a work that's darker and more violent than most, lightened, fortunately, by that grim Scottish humor.  Anyway, the show was released on video in 2006; it is a box of three DVD's that gives us the first four shows.

It was the first of what has also proven to be a series of TV crime dramas, although further entries in the series star Ken Stott, rather than Hannah.  The production is set in Edinburgh, as are the books; however, aside from the briefest sidelong glances, we don't see much of that beautiful city beloved of tourists.  (Nevertheless, I went there a few years ago, and carved out for myself such a Rebus tour as time allowed; as I too am a rather longtime fan, and have read every one of the books save the last.)  There appears to have been plenty of money thrown at the screen; it believably portrays the life of a modern business city, with clogged streets, bridges and roads.  Cars, dress, housing and bars all look like the real thing.

John Hannah, most of us know, achieved a lasting high-profile with his powerful funeral scene in 1995's ""Four Weddings and a Funeral;"" as it happens, I had first noticed him in the Glasgow-set ""Taggart"" series.  He sure is easy on the eyes, and I found him fine in the part; perhaps I'm not as demanding in this regard as a person of the other sex might be.  As to what Stitt, reputed to be a very good tv actor might do with it, well, I've no idea.

As the first of the series to be filmed, the makers had their choice of books, and, as you might expect, they filmed four of the most interesting and powerful.  The first disk gives us ""Black and Blue,"" and ""The Hanging Garden.""  ""Black and Blue"" is about a previous serial killer still at large, dubbed ""The Prophet,"" and a copycat killer who's sprung up, dubbed ""The Disciple."" The novel won many awards, and helped to make Rankin's name: the plot's complex, and moves fast.  ""The Hanging Garden"" is particularly powerful, as Rebus's daughter is hit by a hit-and-run driver and seriously injured.  It also gives us a local gang war, a look at the illicit international trade in women, and a subplot about a World War II prison camp sadist who's escaped retribution, and gone comfortably to ground in Edinburgh.

The second disk gives us ""Dead Souls,""an exploration of child abuse, and is a story that makes particularly good, resonant use of its setting.  The third disk is ""Mortal Causes;"" it, like the book on which it's based, makes really strong use of the city's little-known corners, and centers, as did the book, on a plea for racial tolerance.

All four episodes are just crammed full of plot; and may be rather difficult for anyone not familiar with the underlying books to follow.  They also all neatly, perhaps too neatly, have the detective solve every case within the allotted time:  He also did so in the books, but that seemed less troublesome.  Biggest problem with this series in my house was the sound track.  On the second disk, we sometimes had the volume turned up to near 100, highest it's ever been, and still couldn't hear the entire dialog.  Furthermore, this is a recently-made and -released series: why oh why doesn't it have subtitles?  Even when the dialog is audible, the actors are speaking, as we agree they should, in that city's strong accent. These American ears would have been totally unable to follow the action, had I not previously read the books.  That really shouldn't be so necessary, and I hope the further releases, starring Stott, are a little more helpful in that regard.",1206662400,5,3921,4.631502890173411

It's GREAT!

Yes, the pace is fast, and perhaps the plot lines are a little tightly woven, but heck, these are crime thrillers set in the real down-and dirty Scottish underworld. Not the crime world of Poirot or Agatha Christie, and not the Scotland of Braveheart - think Trainspotting as a background, but more violent. And the casual brutality is no myth. A street kid in Oban described to me his approach to fighting - ""Ah gie's him twa-three guid headers in the mooth, and then as he gings doon Ah pits the boot in.""

According to some reviewers, D.I. Rebus is not quite as complex or conflicted as he is in the books, but he's complex and conflicted enough for me.

I can't get over the attitude of some reviewers to the Scottish accents. OK, I understand they can be difficult for Americans, but work a little, replay some bits now and again, you'll get it. It wasn't made for you initially, so dismissive comments like ""unintelligible at times"" are way off the mark.",1179014400,6,1178,4.5424528301886795

Ahhhh, Rebus and his good friend, DS Siobhan Clarke, work well together. She is the only one who really understands him. However, as time does not stand still, Ian Rankin's new character DI Malcom Fox, heading The Ethics and Standards Division' makes his appearance,and he is shocked, shocked,,I tell you, to find Rebus back on the force. He dredges up all the old complaints, none of which went anywhere when Rebus was on the force. The cat and mouse game continues. I actually resented Fox in this novel, at first...

We get to meet Rebus's daughter as he travels to the north of Scotland on this case. He is trying to resurrect their relationship. We also see a great deal of Scotland, the north country and get to meet the people. This is a time when Scotland is attempting to exert it's independence, and we see the issues from all sides. This is a fascinating study of a man who was let out to pasture, trying to regain his foothold. Rebus has not changed much, his habits remain the same, but I do detect a little empathy in the man. He is trying to deal with the changes in the workplace and the computerization of his workplace.

Rebus is the man who loves the music, the whiskey, the man who pays little attention to the niceties of life. There are some tell tale signs that Rebus might be working with his unit again.. He is also privy to every bad duck in Scotland, and can often get them to help him in some cases.
