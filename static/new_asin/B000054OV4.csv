1393394,3,B000054OV4,"This film was director Sam Peckinpah's first feature, and it is a surprisingly good western.  What makes this film work is the chemistry and character study between Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith.  No, the sparks don't fly quite the same way they do between John Wayne and O'Hara, but both leads create interesting characters that seperate the film from most B westerns.  The supporting cast -- Strother Martin and Chill Willis -- were veterans of numerous westerns, and they provide plenty of color.  For anyone who enjoys B westerns this one is a cut above most.",997228800,20,564,4.84375
1393398,2,B000054OV4,"I wanted to like this movie.  I like the actors, particularly O'Hara and Keith.  I admire most of Sam Peckinpah's movies.  Here, there are traces of his brilliance on display, but despite his direction, the fine actors and the screenplay by the author of the novel, this movie just doesn't work.  It is slow and several scenes make little sense.  I watched until Keith and O'Hara buried the wagon to fool the Apaches.  These particular Apaches can't find a large hole or recognize foot prints not made by Indians?  Too much.  I quit.  I no longer care if they get to Siringo or not.  And what Yellowleg will eventually do with Turk holds no more interest for me.  Nor do I care what happens to Billy of the backwards guns.
I downloaded this movie via Amazon Prime so can not comment on any dvd's.",1461283200,2,796,4.458333333333333
1393399,5,B000054OV4,"Not a typical Western.  A complicated and redemptive love story set against a rough and dangerous background of deadly villains and and two people who risked everything to satisfy their deep longings for truth, love and justice and finally mercy which saved everything in the end.  This was really well done-- casting, directing, writing, music and chemistry and empathy between the main characters and the conventionally moral people of the town.  Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara are always great together.  A pure kind of love expressed in a consoling and deeply understanding embrace makes a profoundly satisfying beginning to a true love and a promising future.",1461110400,3,664,5.235849056603773

1393404,3,B000054OV4,"""It could have been a contender."" Borrowing a line from On the Water Front's Marlon Brando, too bad Director Sam Peckinpah did not have a free hand in this movie . . . a classic possibility held back by Ms. O'Hara's handlers including the Producer Charlie Fitzsimmons [at least in Peckinpah's view]. Glimpses of Peckinpah's brilliance come alive in scenes set against mountains or brush while following the rider-on-horse, but the action seems stunted in the dramatic situations where one realizes that would not have been the case with Peckinpah's unencumbered direction. The Producer also edited the movie, not using the remarkable talents of Peckinpah honed through television to make an exciting, fast-paced movie. ""Brian Keith and Bill Clothier give remarkable performances"" Peckinpah says in the book ""Sam Peckinpah Interviews,"" given what must have been real challenges during the weeks of filming. I'd add Chill Wills to the list of performances in this film, who comes back in his rascally ways in the Peckinpah classic Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.",1460246400,3,1059,5.1988304093567255

1393417,5,B000054OV4,I am a big fan of Brian Keith and enjoyed this old western of his released back in 1961.

Eventually he finds Turk and his partner Billy and persuades them to rob a bank in Gila City. However, during the heist a shooting ensues and Yellowleg accidentally kills the young son of dance hall hostess Kit. Full of remorse, Yellowleg forces his partners to accompany Kit and him through Apache territory to Siringo where Kit wishes to bury her son next to his father. Along the way Billy tries to force himself on Kit and Yellowleg throws Billy out of their camp while Turk flees. All three finally wind up in Siringo where Yellowleg learns that Billy and Turk have gone through the bank robbery without him and a deadly confrontation culminates in Siringo.

1393491,2,B000054OV4,"It's hard to know which tagline is the more misleading - `Pages torn from the diary of a frontier dance hall girl!' or `The stars of The Parent Trap trapped together again by their past,' but both serve warning that Sam Peckinpah's first feature The Deadly Companions aka Trigger Happy is not one of his finer hour-and-a-halfs. Opportunistically thrown together on the cheap by Maureen O'Hara's brother to capitalise on the success of her teaming with Brian Keith in The Parent Trap, it's not an unpromising idea but it is one that rarely comes to life thanks to a poor script, one note performances and the kind of production where finishing on time and under budget was more important than making it good. Peckinpah was Keith's choice of director (they had struck up a friendship on the TV series The Westerner), which apparently didn't go down too well with his producer or leading lady. Peckinpah wasn't the easiest director to work with if you weren't on his wavelength but reputedly banned from even talking to O'Hara on the set, let alone directing her, his suggestions for rewrites ignored and barely tolerated by his the ever-watchful producer who promptly re-edited the ending, it may be some sort of achievement that he delivered a fairly competent job, but it's a defiantly dull movie with few hints that Peckinpah had the stuff of greatness in him. It really could have been turned out by almost any capable Western hack and would be almost completely forgotten were it not for his later notoriety.

Keith is the Yankee drifter who saves Chill Wills' lowlife from an impromptu lynching for cheating at cards and persuades him and flashy partner Steve Cochran to come with him to a small town with a new bank and an old sheriff. Not that robbery's what he's really got on his mind: he wants his revenge on the Reb who tried to scalp him during the war. Unfortunately they get beaten to the bank by another gang, and even more unfortunately a war wound that prevents him from holding his gun arm properly causes Keith to accidentally kill dance hall girl and town pariah Maureen O'Hara's son. To make amends he sets out to accompany her and the boy's body to the ghost town to bury her son next to the husband none of the town gossips believe she had, initially accompanied by the two and later pursued by a vengeful Apache, but she wants none of it. And, for most of the running time, chances are neither will you because, despite the odd quirk like a town that can't agree what day of the week it is or Wills' mad Reb deserter who wants to use the money from a bank robbery to create his own republic complete with an army of Indian slaves, there's not a lot going on and most of it not happening very interestingly. You do get to see Strother Martin turn up as the first of Peckinpah's preachers, Wills looks appropriately serpentlike when draped around the branch of a tree leering at O'Hara and there's a nicely cynical payoff with the townsfolk demonstrating what they truly value enough to head into Apache territory, but it's a bloodless affair - the re-editing even ensures that one of the characters never kills anyone when originally he shot someone out of pure impatience.

If anything a bigger problem than the re-editing is the truly atrocious score by Marlin Skiles, which alternates between sounding like something written for a childrens' puppet show or the kind of amateurish library music lazily plastered over cheap video releases of silent movies. More than merely bad, it's insistently bad, rarely content to let the film play out in silence and constantly undermining what's on screen with an almost wall-to-wall carpeting of just plain wrong.

As if that weren't bad enough, the film has been plagued by dismal public domain copies that have littered the DVD market, most panned-and-scanned. Even Optimum's licensed UK DVD is cropped to 1.66:1. The Roan Group's 2.35:1 widescreen transfer is currently the best of the bunch Stateside, but many copies have been plagued with pressing faults and there's not much in the way of extras. Peckinpah completists with multi-region machines are better off going for Koch's PAL German DVD (currently going cheap on Amazon.de) features a restored 2.35:1 widescreen transfer, a lengthy extract from the documentary Passion and Poetry - The Ballad of Sam Peckinpah and an interesting stills gallery for the film (there's one particularly strikingly misleading video cover selling it as a spaghetti western!), although the audio commentary is only unsubtitled German. It's still a poor film that's easily the director's worst, but for the Peckinpah fan it's by far and away the only version to get.",1374796800,6,4669,4.83375

1393506,4,B000054OV4,"There's a lot to like about THE DEADLY COMPANIONS (1961), the first theatrical feature directed by Sam Peckinpah, but this gritty Western also has a fair share of problems...most of them stemming from it's low budget and a sluggish screenplay (by A.S. Fleischman) in which characters' motivations are not always credible.

Brian Keith stars as a gunslinger who accidentally shoots and kills the young son of dance hall owner Maureen O'Hara.  Despite her initial protests, he and his two desperado companions (Steve Cochran, Chill Wills) decide to escort her to an abandoned town in the middle of Apache territory where she plans to bury the boy next to his late father.  Keith, however, has a hidden agenda.  He plots revenge on one of the two men for an atrocity committed against him during the war between the North and the South.

All four actors are excellent in their individual roles, particularly Wills whose part is atypical of the likeable, folksy characters for which he was best known.  The desert vistas are nicely photographed, the story has a couple of interesting twists and Peckinpah's direction, although probably better suited for a television Western of the period, certainly portends of more impressive work to come.

Sadly, the film's mediocre budget forces the action sequences to be limited and rather static, and in the night scenes, it is often difficult to discern who is on screen and what is happening.

Nevertheless,  THE DEADLY COMPANIONS should please Western fans...particularly those who are aficionados of Peckinpah.

Strother Martin, a member of the director's ""stock company,"" has a small, but amusing role, as a preacher.

1393518,2,B000054OV4,"""The Deadly Companions"" is the first motion picture directed by Sam Peckinpah, following  his successes on TV writing and/or directing episodes of ""Gunsmoke"" (1955-8), ""Broken Arrow"" (1956-8), ""The Rifleman"" (1958), ""Klondike"" (1960) and the best damn TV western ever  - ""The Westerner"" (1960), which lasted a mere 13 episodes. In fact, Peckinpah not only directed most of the episodes of ""The Westerner"" he also created it. What distinguished this show from the plethora of TV westerns in the late 50s and early 60s was the realism Peckinpah brought to the story. Hero Brian Keith was seriously flawed (one time he leaves his dog - actually Old Yeller from the Disney film of the same name - to die because he can't share his water, although the dog, who co-starred, makes it back), but retained a sense of honor even while all around  him times were tough. Peckinpah would replay this theme many times in the films to come.

When ""The Westerner"" was cancelled, star Brian Keith who had appeared in a few dozen films as a second lead - ""Arrowhead"" (1953), ""The Violent Men"" (1955), ""Fort Dobbs"" (1958), ""The Young Philadelphians"" (1959) - was offered the starring role in ""The Deadly Companions"" and it's Keith who recommended Peckinpah for the job as director.

The same year Keith would go on to co-star with Maureen O'Hara in ""The Parent Trap"" and their chemistry in ""The Deadly Companions"" is probably a result of this collaboration. Keith would make dozens of films, including ""Nevada Smith"" (1966), ""The McKenzie Break"" (1970), and my personal favorite as Teddy Roosevelt in ""The Wind and the Lion"" (1975). He would continue making films throughout his career, but he moved back and forth to TV where he landed the role as Uncle Bill in ""Family Affair""(1966-71) where he earned 3 Emmy nominations. Interestingly enough, while doing Family Affair, Peckinpah asked him to appear as Deke Thornton (eventually played by Robert Ryan in one of his best performances) in ""The Wild Bunch"", but Keith couldn't work it out, much to Peckinpah's annoyance.

The great Maureen O'Hara co-stars. There isn't praise enough to describe Maureen O'Hara's contribution to the film world. Early on she lit up the screen at 19 as Esmeralda in ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1939) and followed that with her first John Ford film as the daughter Angharad in ""How Green Was My Valley"" (1941). She could play comedy (""Miracle on 34th Street in 1947), romance (""The Quiet Man"" in 1952), or action (""Bagdad"" in 1949) and her films with John Wayne (""Big Jake"", ""McClintock"", ""Quiet Man"", ""Rio Grande"" ""Wings of Eagles"") are all memorable. She had a lovely singing voice and, in fact, sings in ""Companions"".

For Charles Fitzsimons, O'Hara's brother (and her manager), this was his first time as a producer, having served as an associate producer for 3 forgettable films in the late 50s. Fitzsimmons would produce the first ""Batman"" movie (1966) and then work primarily in TV on various series. Fitzsimmons managed to get the script from Marlon Brando, who decided to do ""One Eyed Jacks"" instead of ""Yellowleg"" (the original name for the film), and spent a lot of time with the writer (Sid Fleishman). When Peckinpah was signed on and started to make changes, Fitzsimmon s exploded and ordered Peckinpah to follow the original script. Legend goes, he then forbid Peckinpah from talking to O'Hara. In a 1993 interview, Fitzsimmons said that Peckinpah ""didn't know his ass from a hole in the ground"" and that he didn't ""understand drama...and he did not understand morality."" Peckinpah made his cut, but then Fitzsimmons completely changed it around.

The film features Chill Wills and Strother Martin, actors whom Peckinpah would use again in several films. Chill Wills was a native Texan and mostly played in westerns. He's best known for his role as Beekeeper in John Wayne's ""The Alamo"" (1960) for which he was nominated as Best Supporting Actor (he lost to Peter Ustinov in ""Spartacus""),  one of more than 50 film roles he played. He made memorable contributions to films as  Uncle Bawley in ""Giant"" (1956), Drago in ""McClintock"" (1963), John Gage in ""The Man from the Alamo"" (1963), and Lemuel (the store keeper) in ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" (1973), and he was the voice of ""Francis the Talking Mule"".  Wills plays ""Turk"", a colorful lowlife that would characterize many of his performances.

Strother Martin is best remembered as the warden from ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967) who scolded Paul Newman that ""What we have here is a failure to communicate"", but personally I think his best performance was as the bounty hunter from ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969), a Peckinpah film. He was a regular in westerns including several with John Wayne - ""The Horse Soldiers"" (1959), ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (1962), ""McClintock"" (1963), ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" (1965), ""True Grit"" (1969), and ""Rooster Cogburn "" (1975) - and with Paul Newman - ""Harper"" (1966), ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967), ""Slap Shot"" (1977), ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" (1969). In addition to ""Deadly Companions"" and ""The Wild Bunch"", he appeared in Peckinpah's ""The Ballad of Cable Hogue"" (1970)

Peckinpah followed ""The Deadly Companions"" with ""Ride the High Country"" , one of the top 10 best westerns ever made, and then went on to make ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969) and ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" (1973), two of the finest westerns ever made, giving Peckinpah 3 of the top 10.

This is not a traditional Peckinpah film. His best known films focus on the transition when the old west was ending and the new west hadn't yet begun, but in ""Companions"" he has a set western piece, similar to his TV shows. Moreover, you'll find none of the slow motion action sequences here, and very little of the beautiful compositions that would mark his later works. Moreover this is one of the few Peckinpah films to feature a strong woman co-star  - his best films were macho films that focused on the interplay between two male characters, one of whom holds to the old west (Joel McCrea, William Holden, Kris Kristopherson) and one of whom is trying his best to accommodate to the new times (Randolph Scott, Robert Ryan, James Coburn). Of course, with Maureen O'Hara in the cast, a young Peckinpah probably had no choice. LOL.

But fans of Peckinpah will see some traces of his later work. Scenes of children playing and a frontier prayer meeting clearly anticipate the opening scene from ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969), the young harmonica playing boy anticipates Dylan's role in ""Pat Garrett"", the tension between the men on the ride through Indian country gets replayed in ""High Country"" as well as ""The Wild Bunch"", and the journey to bury O'Hara's son is grimly replayed in ""Bring Me The Head of Alfredo Garcia"".

From an historical point of view, people interested in Peckinpah will certainly like to see his first effort, even if it has been reorganized by Fitzsimmons. It's also a great performance from Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith and the rest of the cast, but as a film, it has a lot to be desired.",1269648000,3,7038,4.88107202680067

- A slimy companion (Chill Wills) who is the prototype for so many other slimy sidekicks in Peckinpah films.

It's Sam Peckinpah's directorial debut in motion pictures; most people reading this know that Peckinpah went on to become a highly acclaimed director with such notable efforts as 1969's ""The Wild Bunch."" In addition, ""The Deadly Companions"" was filmed on location in Arizona (including Old Tucson); you can't beat Arizona for fine, authentic Western locations. Lastly, the picture only runs 90 minutes, so it won't likely wear out its welcome.

THE STORY: Keith's character vengefully searches for a scumbag who tried to scalp him alive 5 years earlier and accidently kills a beautiful saloon girl's son. Feeling guilty, he offers to escort her to the ghost town where the boy's father was buried so she can bury the son as well. There's two problems: They have to go through injun territory and two lowlifes accompany them most of the way.

BOTTOM LINE: On paper this sounds like it would be a worthwhile Western, unfortunately it never rises above mediocre, and dangerously verges on being deadly dull. Plus the viewer can hardly see what's going on during the numerous (brief) night sequences. Moreover, two of the main characters are incredibly unlikable (which can be defended on the grounds that they're the real villains of the story). Hence, I can only recommend ""The Deadly Companions"" to uber-fans of Keith and O'Hara or Peckinpah completists.

With all that said, there are some worthwhile aspects, like the church service in the saloon and the depiction of O'Hara as a social outcast amongst the church folk (for legitimate reasons).

1393542,4,B000054OV4,"Brian Keith play ex-Union soldier referred to as Yellowleg and Maureen O'Hara plays a, er, performer at the Black Garter dance hall in Sam Peckinpah's feature film debut, THE DEADLY COMPANIONS.  Keith plays a character with a score to settle with a nasty hombre from his past when he gives O'Hara a grudge of her own to gnaw on when he accidentally shoots and kills her son.  Keith, with a brace of prairie thugs in tow (Steve Cochran and Chill Wills) attempts to make amends by escorting the headstrong O'Hara through hostile Apache country after which she'll bury her son.

THE DEADLY COMPANIONS has a lot going for it.  Dramatic tension is maintained at a satisfyingly high level - the group is threatened from without by the marauding Apaches and, for a variety of reasons, from within by each other .  Keith and O'Hara act and react well with each other.  O'Hara always seemed to give her best performance opposite a strong male co-star, and the underrated Keith proves a good match. Chill Wills, who was seldom given much more to do then bray and act mulish plays a shaggy ex-Reb with some blood on the hands of the skeletons in his closet, and who, in the course of the movie, reminds us that he was a pretty accomplished character actor.

  Although there are moments of explosive violence, Peckinpah doesn't dwell on them with the obsessively loving eye that would later become his trademark.  There are other signs of an unbecoming and uncharacteristic delicacy at work. During Keith's and O'Hara's great emotional showdown scene O'Hara talks about the scars she carries from the men with dirty arms who, for money she let pinch her and kiss her.  I don't know how many filters O'Hara's speech had to pass through before it reached the screen, but the final product sounds polite and phony.  Okay, the bar is set higher because Peckinpah is the director, but still, the way DEADLY COMPANIONS tiptoes around O'Hara's real occupation is aggravating, especially so in light of the fact that Peckinpah devotes an early scene to a clutch of town hens gossiping maliciously about the unwed O'Hara and her five-year-old-son and how it just ain't fitting blah blah blah and land sakes I reckon even she don't know who the boy's father is blah blah blah. (Strother Martin Alert - The church service takes place in a bar that modestly quits serving drinks during the service.  Strother Martin plays the town preacher, foreshadowing a similar bit role he'd play seven years later in Peckinpah's masterpiece, THE WILD BUNCH.  Oddly enough, in both films Martin leads the congregation in a stirring rendition of Yes, We'll Gather at the River.  Must have liked that one.)

  For all of its dated delicacy, DEADLY COMPANIONS was interesting and more than a little enjoyable.  Deeply undermining the enjoyment factor is the full screen, pan-and-scan presentation.  Unless there was absolutely no wide-screen print fit to print, a truly shameful decision.  Even so, a high recommendation for this one.",1118880000,29,2995,4.879446640316205
