7428781,5,B0153YEXDC,"Great 2 night performance blue ray disc of Baby Metal filmed March 1st Red Night & 2nd Black Night. I Enjoyed watching the 2 night performance as the set lists are different but both nights are equally enjoyable..... The filming is nice & the band sounds great ...Su-Metal ,Yui Metal, Moh Metal sound great also & have lots of energy.... This Is An Awesome performance DVD",1461715200,,372,4.651515151515151
7428782,5,B0153YEXDC,"Ok, so I was able to get my copy cheaper on eBay, sorry Amazon, but BABYMETAL was a brilliant idea from Japan, a fusion of J-pop and metal so works! Who doesn't like staring at cute Japanese girls singing and dancing it out, and hearing shredding guitars at the same time. Who knows how much longer this act will go on, cause as you know children do grow up. So snatch up what you can of this great spectacle! If you think the prices of BABYMETAL CD's & DVD's are expensive now, I can only imagine what it will be when BABYMETAL is no more. :(",1460246400,5,543,4.132075471698113

The audio is more raw, there's two full concerts on here, they play a song from their kiba of akiba split, yui falls off stage at one point, the only downside is they weren't playing their second album's stuff yet. I'd totally buy it, especially cuz when i bought it, it was way cheaper than all the other blu rays by them",1493769600,,370,4.152777777777778

7428792,5,B0153YEXDC,"BABYMETAL RULES! I love heavy metal and i understand that singers want there vocals as heavy as the band is, Maybe that's what hooked me. At first i was a little confused, but there was a big smile on my face and i realized the girls brought a fun and positive energy to metal. Su's voice is pure and powerful Yui and Moa ad a vocal halo around it ( especially on The One ). And the Kami band don't even get me started, as talented  as any metal players around! The show is amazing, well shot and the girls energy is boundless, and it doesn't hurt that their cuter than cute! I highly recommend this show!!! Yui Moa and Su Japanese girls o my!.",1489622400,3,644,4.152
7428793,5,B0153YEXDC,"""Leave it to the Japanese to mix Metal and Cute-J-Pop"" and make it sound respectable (Rob Zombie).  I lived in Japan for 2-years (2014-2016) I didn't even hear about Babymetal, until I returned to the states.  Wow!  I first saw them on Youtube Jamming with Rob Halford in Dec2016 - and was very curious.  After seeing their live videos on youtube (several times) and purchasing their 2-studio albums and their Live Wembley and Budokan - I decided to buy this.  No complaints here.  Like other blurry live concerts I have, this one never has a dull moment (My favs: Rush, Dream theater, Metallica, Prince, VH, etc).  The band (instrument players) is very legit metal.  It truly doesn't make sense that I have a guilty pleasure enjoying this band and video.  Part of it maybe the wonderful time I had in Japan... Part of it may be the experience I had whilst watching Eric Clapton (in person) in the Budokan in 2016... Part of it maybe reminiscing to live albums I grew up with;  Cheap Trick, Ozzy, Dream Theater, Winery Dogs and other classic rock acts who've played within this legendary venue.

Noteworthy Comments.
- The Bluray is filmed in two difference sequential nights.
- During Black Night: Mao-metal fell off the stage during 'Headbaaaangggger!!'  - that's why she disappeared half way through the song.  Yui-metal slipped during one of the acts - and continued throughout the remaining show. Like a trooper, both dancers performed flawlessly the next evening.
- If you decide to buy this, make sure the BR or DVD is marked 'Region free' or 'region-1' .  Your player make not work with this medium.  Beware on eBay - the copies and bootleg of this album are numerous.  I bought this via Amazon-Premum

Hope you enjoy... I did!!!",1486857600,6,1737,4.7558528428093645

7428798,5,B0153YEXDC,This is a fantastic blu-ray concert to own. My experience appreciating Babymetal's 1st album is enhanced by their live performances. Initially only a few songs stood from the album. After watching live renditions I have since changed that mindset.

7428821,5,B0153YEXDC,"Extraordinary vocals and dancing from the three extremely talented, hard working young women combined with virtuoso heavy metal masters and creative lighting make this one of the best bands I have ever seen. I grew up with the Beatles and followed rock music through all of the wonderful stages of the 60's, 70's, and 80's while watching the evolution of rock through its many changes and advancements. Babymetal is the culmination of all of rock music's appealing characteristics and they demonstrate their perfection of each element of the genre. I don't know where rock music goes from here. How can musicians sing better, dance better, and play faster or more precisely than Babymetal as they perform such an exciting show????",1466294400,5,730,5.091666666666667
7428822,5,B0153YEXDC,"Babymetal in concert = Pure Awesome.  Video plays fine, quality is great.  Bought this as a consolation prize since a ticket for their upcoming concert would have cost $300, and I'm glad I did!",1465862400,,193,4.647058823529412

7428831,5,B0153YEXDC,The mere suggestion that a band like this could work would probably land you in an insane asylum. But work it does. The girls singing and dancing compliment the band perfectly and vice versa. The Kami band are excellent musicians. They sound so tight and each band member take turns doing wonderful solos. The drummer has incredibly fast feet. Moametal and Yuimetal have boundless energy and must be two of the cutest girls on the planet. Sumetal is a real beauty with a voice to match. This is one of my favorite concerts on disc and you owe it to yourself to see this unique and fascinating fusion of jpop and metal in action.

FYI: someone said it works in us players, although the seller said otherwise. Just be careful, because I got the Made in German version, which indeed works on most blu Ray players.

Hope they do a follow-up concert DVD for the newer material! I've noticed that the ENGLISH button in the disc menu doesn't seem to do anything. Anybody know why this is? I was expecting at least some subtitles for the Japanese-speaking intro parts that start each concert and some of the individual songs, but no dice. Maybe it works with a different speaker configuration?",1464307200,4,526,4.791208791208791

this dvd has songs from the 1st babymetal record and also no rain no rainbow which is musically stellar, su-metal is elegant and perfect. black night dvd also has kimi to anime ga mitai which is just a cute-overload treat and musically satisfying as well
overall the performance and production is good but a bit rough (live) and somewhat light on the low-end frequencies, sometimes the cameras don't follow the action as much as i like (maybe it's intentional to not show an imperfection- like poor yui-metalchan falling off stage!) but it's not bad and i do watch it again and again
if ur new (or not) to bm, this is a great one to start with or add to the collection of happaydesu!

8732618,5,B0153YEXDC,"Frankly, I don't even know why I'm writing this review. If you know about Babymetal, its a no brainer. At about 20 bucks, you can't go wrong.

For those who may not know about them....why are you even reading this if you don't know about them.....after all....Babymetal, that sounds like a oxymoron.

Guess what, that's what I thought too. I came across them quite by accident. Was looking for old songs on youtube, and one of the links that always appears on the side was Babymetal. When I seen it, I thought it would be a bunch of 10 year olds trying to act like Metalica.

But I thought, wth, it should be a hoot.....so I clicked on it.

Well the video started and there were these guys dressed in white sheets with makeup on. They were laying down some pretty good heavy metal type music. I thought to myself....why the name Babymetal.

Then here comes these 3 young ladies on stage. I thought....well this is not going to end well.

Admittedly, at first I thought this was stupid..

Little by little, It started to get to me. I wasn't sold after first video, but was intrigued enough to watch another.

To make a long story short. After about 3 different videos, I went from this is dumb to this is fantastic.

There is literally nothing out there that compares to the show they put on. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you are open minded and looking for a visual and sound spectacle....this is for you.",1518739200,4,1420,4.409961685823755

8732620,5,B0153YEXDC,"I have thousands of songs in my music collection and there's only a few bands I have managed to fall in love with as quickly as BabyMetal, even faster than the Beatles. They put up some of the best concerts I have ever seen in my life. You only have to watch one song from this Blu-ray and you'll immediately wish you could go to one of their shows. The girls have so much energy and they look like they are having a lot of fun entertaining their fans. From what I seen in their interviews, they are very mature and humble for their age and they almost always have a smile on their face. I highly recommend you buy this concert Blu-ray, it's a roller coaster ride. Pretty much every song is entertaining and fun to watch and it leaves you with a happy feeling. I hope we see more of BabyMetal in the future, they are one of my favorite bands of all time and that's saying a lot considering I am a huge fan of The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Who and many other legendary artists.",1509580800,4,977,4.174603174603175
8732621,5,B0153YEXDC,"This BD presents two concerts, that were held back-to-back on March 1 and 2, 2014 at the Nippon Budokon. This shows what Babymetal can do with the HUGE Budokon stage. The first night is somewhat shorter (13 songs), compared to the second (15 songs). All the songs in both nights were performed in a very powerful and very professional way, in spite of two accidents on the first night. Fortunately, nobody was seriously hurt.

The first night starts with a fairly long speech by Cobametal (I think) in a skeleton costume. He introduces the Kami band, plugs the Babymetal album, and addresses the crowd. Then, the Babymetal dancers literally rise up from within the Bodokon stage and move right into Megetsune. The video coverage is excellent. We can see lots of closeups of the dancers' facial expressions, which encance their performance further. There are all sorts of special lighting and lasers. The Kami band fills Bodocon with music the whole night and gets a couple of solos, but, it was mostly the dancers who got the center stage. One exception is ""Rondo of Nighmare,"" in which the Kami guitarists are around the main page and Sumetal performs brilliantly about ten feet above them. Impressive!!

Then, there was the accident. About half-way through Headbangeeeeeerrrrr!!, the next-to-the-last song, Yuimetal fell off the stage while moving between two of the smaller side-stages. We don't get to see it, but there are two girls singing, a yelp, then just one singing. Even though the other two dancers knew that something was wrong, they finished the song with an undiminished level of energy and perfection. (I suspect they were being updated through their intercom, but did not know for sure what had happened.)  More remarkably, even though everybody in the audience had to know that Yuimetal was missing when Moametal returned to the center stage, no one in the audience said a thing. After the song ended, the lights went dark and soon, there were chants of ""Yui-chan! Yui-chan! ..."" Then Yuimetal came on the announcer's circuit, told everybody what happened and that she was OK. The audience cheered.

Yuimetal rejoined the other two for the last number, ""Ijmi, Dame, Zettai."" She seemed to be in pain, but did a very good job, nevertheless. Then Moametal slipped and fell. She got right up, and finished the number. Hard-core fans point out that neither of the younger Babymetal dancers completely hit their marks, but they did great, anyways. Tough kids!

If you don't want to see that part of the first night, the same two songs were performed the second night. Even though night 2 was titled, ""Black Night Legend Doomsday,"" nobody got hurt. Also, even though Yuimetal and Moametal had gotten hurt the night before, they were at the top of their game the second night. On the other hand, if you want to see young girls display an incredibly high level of bravery and professionalism, I can recommend the last two songs of the first night.

The second night begins with the Babymetal dancers moving deliberately and purposely down a wide set of stairs to a very rousing Kami Band march, while carrying light sabers!! It looked like Commander Sumetal with her two loyal lieutenants ready to take on anyone. They gave the light sabers up at the bottom of the stage, but the rousing Kami Band music continued as Babymetal took up their positions and then performed a very intense Babymetal Death. There was no doubt that everybody was in full form. Yuimetal and Moametal were definitely back! The two songs performed on night two that were not performed on night one are ""Kimi to Anime ga Mitai"" and one of Yumetal's very few live performances of ""No Rain, No Rainbow."" Because of Yuimetal's fall on night 1, extra railings were put up on the stage. We get to see Headbangeeeeeerrrrr!! without incident, as well as ""Ijmi, Dame, Zettai"" with everybody in full form. (The last would have been awesome with the light sabers, but ...)

In this BD, we get to see the Kami Band and Babymetal performing before a live audience, bringing out the best in all, while seeing the individual performers at distances and with details not normally possible in a live performance. The light effects and lasers greatly enhance the mood. Everybody and everything is right on the mark. Also, because there are no pyrotechnics, there is no smoke to obscure the view.",1503619200,3,4362,4.854838709677419
