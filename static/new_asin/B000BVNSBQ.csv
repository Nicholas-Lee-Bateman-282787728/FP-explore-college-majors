2443170,5,B000BVNSBQ,"A Squeeze fan since 1982, I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to do a review of Amy Packard's ""One for the Road!""  I've always wondered what it would be like to travel across the USA when Glenn Tilbrook was on tour and attend all of his shows...well, this movie gives a glimpse of just that!  Very funny, heartfelt, and extremely entertaining, I felt almost like I was part of the movie!  Great flick for all Squeeze and Glenn fans and anyone who has ever had an obsession with a rock band!  To sum up in one word that I know any true Glenn fan will understand---TOPTASTIC!",1140739200,3,577,4.364485981308412

Put the kids to bed, make sure the wife/husband doesn't have anything planned and settle down to watch.  You'll be entraced I promise you.

Thanks Glenn (and Chris of course) for everything over the years, loved every minute.

And a special thank you to Amy for putting all this together.

You deserve an Oscar!

I think I'm getting a bit carried away.

Buy it.  Enjoy it.

2443172,5,B000BVNSBQ,"""One for the Road"" is a visual delight to behold. And Glenn Tilbrook is a sonic genius.

This DVD fully encapsulates Glenn's joy of music. My brother, Joe, and I have seen Squeeze, Difford & Tilbrook and/or Tilbrook solo perform live at least 30 times. Needless to say, Glenn is one of the greatest singer/guitarists of all time. We were blessed to meet him, once again, in The OC during the 2001 ""Incomplete"" tour. In fact, my brother is the bloke with the Cool for Cat-esque SQUEEZE tattoo you see in this documentary.

My wife, Suzanne, has met Glenn as well. And she said, while viewing OFTR from the get-go, ""he is genuinely a sincere and nice person."" Indeed. Glenn always takes the time to chat, sign autographs and quaff a cold one. Cheers, then!

Squeeze made amazing music for 25 years. Now Glenn has picked up the torch, and he's running with it headlong. You won't want to miss this story...about a man, two guitars and a Cruise Master.

God bless you, Glenn!!!",1138406400,9,973,4.574712643678161
2443173,5,B000BVNSBQ,"As a long time fan of Glenn Tilbrook, both as a solo artist and founder member of Squeeze, I was delighted to hear about a film looking at life on the road with the man. I was fortunate to see a screening last year and I wasn't disappointed. Film maker Amy Pickard, is clearly a talent and has produced a movie that follows Glenn as he crosses the US of A in an RV.

It's a delight to see it finally appear as a DVD. The film is a mix of styles, part documentary and part interview that trails Glenn onstage, offstage and backstage.

Director Amy Pickard creates an atmosphere of intimacy that allows Glenn's exuberant personality to fill the screen. The music pieces are entertaining and give the viewer a ""live gig"" experience.

If you add to that the range of extras, this is a super package that shouldn't be missed.

If you're a Glenn fan, or Squeeze fan, this is a must. Music fans in general will also find this a good watch. Glenn is half of what is rightly regarded as, the best song writing partnership of their generation and this is a chance to see a great entertainer ply his trade.

This is Amy's first project but she has created a film that may be low on budget but is high on quality.

Nice work Amy, thanks.",1134432000,15,1225,4.2813852813852815
2443174,5,B000BVNSBQ,I saw this movie and couldn't stop talking about it for days.  Even if you know nothing about the band Squeeze this movie will make you smile.  A heartwarming story about a guy playing music for all the right reasons.,1134259200,12,217,4.4
2443175,5,B000BVNSBQ,"Ever wondered what it would be like to go on a cross-country tour with a rock star?  Well, I did and I made a film about it.  Expecting luxury tour buses and five-star hotels, I found Glenn Tilbrook, the former lead singer of Squeeze, touring in a mobile home and bedding down in roadside campgrounds.

This intimate film follows Tilbrook on every step of his first solo tour of America in his beloved-but not so reliable-home on wheels.  From the search for his missing RV; adventures in engine repair and exploding generators, to a musical house call that one fan will never forget: All access, all of the time.

It's the story of how an established artist adjusts to his independent surroundings.  It's a commentary on the current state of the music induestry.  But, most importantly, it's a human-interest story that transcends its musical base.  Includes exclusive live acoustic performances of Tempted, Hourglass, Take Me I'm Yours, Up The Junction, Pulling Mussels (From the Shell), Goodbye Girl, Another Nail in My Heart, Is That Love, Black Coffee in Bed, Parallel World, This Is Where You Ain't and Some Fantastic Place.

SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDE:

*A never before seen interview with Squeeze lyricist Chris Difford from 2002

*My 1991 public access cable interview with Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook from my music video show in Dayton, Ohio

*Audio commentary by Glenn Tilbrook

*Glenn's Q&A from the Tokyo screening of the film and more!!

""A very funny, unique travelogue that stays with you long after the credits roll.""  Ian Gittins/Q Magazine

""Glenn is the antithesis of Spinal Tap rock delusion and in this film, he comes across as the hardcore troubadour who loves what he does.""  Peter Curran/BBC

""Glenn is a great artist.  He's had a stellar career and would have one in journalism if he were so inclined.  I love him. You will too.""  Randy Newman

""When I first met Glenn, I thought he could write songs like Brian Wilson and play guitar like Jimi Hendrix. I knew he was going to go places and with this DVD he has!"" Jools Holland/BBC",1133740800,25,2060,4.825714285714286
2443196,5,B000BVNSBQ,"Glenn Tilbrook is a gifted musician who with Chris Difford wrote some of the finest sophisticated pop of the last 30 years.

The narrative is very strong. Amy Pickard has crafted an intimate portrait of a man who loves his job. Kudos to Pickard for staying true to the story she wanted to tell.

This film will be of interest to anyone who has ever wondered what the music business is really like. Needless to say, especially with the inclusion of an insightful interview with Chris Difford, this is a must-have for Squeeze fans.",1177200000,2,871,5.850393700787402
2443197,5,B000BVNSBQ,"If you love Squeeze, you'll love this.  Yes, you know who they are and have heard their songs, you just have to search a little.  The documentary is extremely inspiring and created by a person who adores her subject. Glenn is a wonderful entertainer and my only wish is that there was more of him singing.  But then again, no matter how much singing was included, I would want more.  I was extremely jealous of all the audiences and he truly knows how to connect and perform without taking himself too seriously.",1174176000,,512,4.532608695652174
2443198,4,B000BVNSBQ,"I certainly hope Squeeze is one of those bands that, some day, get the recognition they so richly deserve.  Perhaps some young band with some real musical skills will actually start writing interesting, meaningful songs, and possess the prolific ability to fill a disc with great music instead of one or two good songs so common in today's music.  And maybe they will tip their hats to bands like Squeeze.  Glenn Tilbrook still sounds great, and he seems to be taking it in stride that the music industry never got Squeeze the recognition (and hits) they deserved,and he's taken matters into his own hands, recording in his own studio, and touring solo.  Two things that spectators in this video said stand out in my mind.  One says that not many people can entertain a room full of strangers with just voice and guitar, captivate them, connect with them, and bring down the house.  Glenn is one of those few.  How true.  The other, a Scottish gentleman, makes the point about how people who grew up in the 70s and 80s are still very much pop music lovers, but the well of good new music has run dry for us.  Again, and sadly, how true.  This unique and funny cross-country journey will make you remember that time when new and unique bands were the norm, and Glenn Tilbrook is still young at heart.  I deducted one star for the following tragic flaw in this video:  None of the performance segments feature the entire song, uninterrupted.  They are used as backdrops for the plot of how Glenn interacts with his audiences and the RV cross-country trip.  I'm sure the cameraman caught entire performances, and they could have at least been included in the special features section, because Glenn Tilbrook can still captivate a home audience as well.  Perhaps future editions will include that awesome performance footage uninterrupted in its entirety.",1172880000,5,1851,4.776729559748428
2443199,5,B000BVNSBQ,"This one is so amuzing to watch, he's so funny and even a bit crazy from time to time. I've watched him live last summer and he's just the same and even developed the Jimi Hendrix number with playing is guitar behind his head just like Jimi",1169510400,,240,4.127659574468085
2443200,5,B000BVNSBQ,"Of course every Squeeze fan will want this disc, but it's really much, much more than just a collection of performances; truthfully, the performances, good as they are, aren't the best part of this DVD.

Others have noted how well Tilbrook comes across in ths film- and I can only echo their sentiments. He's just an absolutely charming fellow who dearly loves his music, and performing for people, as evidenced by such great moments as his leading a group of fans through the streets, singing and playing, while running *backwards*! Through all the difficulties of his trip-  the missing RV, the breakdowns- he just smiles and takes joy in the small things, like buying strings of Christmas lights at Target to decorate the RV, or chatting with clerks, or visiting the home of a fan.

I first read of this DVD a few months ago, and put it in my Amazon shopping cart then, but didn't get around to actually buying it until a few days ago. If you've been similarly thinking about buying it, all I can say is just go ahead and get it. You'll be delighted.",1162512000,,1053,4.560846560846561

2443202,5,B000BVNSBQ,"I just watched the movie and can't say enough good things about it - I LOVED IT!!

First of all having driven across the country a few times myself I can totally relate to the joy that Glenn gets from shopping for his rv and supplies. There's nothing I love more than being out on the road on a weekday while everyone else is slogging their way to work. I have always dreamt of owning an rv, so for me that aspect of the film had a lot of appeal.

Having said that, I was expecting a very Spinal Tap sort of adventure and was caught completely off guard. Glenn's sense of humor and adventure never allow that to happen. We end up laughing with him and not at him. He's a guy with a great ""English"" sense of humor who seems totally uninterested in the

idea of fame or celebrity. I was always a fan of his voice and music but

this film left me with a new found respect for the man himself.

I am sure there are many so-called rock stars who would cringe at the idea of touring like this but I found myself becoming envious at the sort of freedom his music has allowed him. After all how many of us can say, ""I want to drive across the U.S. and perform along the way"". What a great way to spend your life or even a few  weeks!

I never knew that much about Glenn beyond the music. This movie has saved a great story about a great guy for all to see for a long time to come. A job well done I'd say.

And, I'll be recommending this movie to all my friends.",1153094400,3,1454,3.989655172413793
2443203,5,B000BVNSBQ,"Glenn Tilbrook is a rare popular music triple-threat - which by my reckoning is the potent combination of songwriter, performer, and all-around decent human being.  Director Amy Pickard does an outstanding job of depicting all three aspects in her documentary, ""Glenn Tilbrook: One for the Road"".  Glenn has a way of drawing in an audience, which is portrayed brilliantly in the film.  Yes, there is footage of remarkable moments, such as Glenn taking his audience out into the street (literally), and beyond - but it is the sheer energy and personality of the performances that actually carry the day.  And, of course, the songs - those amazing songs.",1148256000,,652,5.0092592592592595
2443204,5,B000BVNSBQ,"I always suspected that Glen was a nice bloke as well as a very talented musician and singer. This proves it. Don't be tempted to rent this dvd. Buy it! Both Glen and Amy Pickard deserve to be encouraged and rewarded in full for this superb piece of documentary entertainment.

2443205,5,B000BVNSBQ,"A troubadour can be defined as a strolling minstrel.  That is what Glenn Tilbrook is, literally.  And a rarity - a truly likeable popular artist.  No Squeeze fan should miss this.  One wistful note to look for - Glenn salutes Paul McCartney as someone who kept his family together despite his career.",1144368000,3,300,4.711538461538462
2443216,5,B000BVNSBQ,"I just watched OFTR for the 3rd time, and it gets better each time. If you've never seen a Tilbrook live performance, you will travel far to see one after watching this DVD.

2443217,5,B000BVNSBQ,"This doc. is just fab. Besides being a huge Squeeze fan, Ms. Pickard captures the moments we all wish we could share with someone we admire, on the road. Kudos to her for this whole project. This deserves a VH-1 Prime time slot. Better yet, have Ms. Pickard produce/direct a show for them. She is ahead of her time. Even Robin Williams has jumped on the bandwagon with his new ""RV"" movie. BUY this DVD!",1143504000,3,402,4.373333333333333

Great depiction of a musician's life on the road sans the limo, bodyguards, groupies, fine hotel trashing and the posse. Instead it's an RV, the director, a cameraman/mechanic, Glenn's gal, the campgrounds,the Christmas lights, the trip to Target and the fans.

This film truly captures the life of a truly dedicated musician who lives for the music and not the glory. Amy Pickard takes you on the road with a handheld cam that makes you feel like you're a part of the tour.  The film was really edited well considering the weeks of tape that must have been shot.

I really recommend this film. It's as real as they come.",1143072000,4,715,4.469230769230769
2443219,4,B000BVNSBQ,Of course I loved it!  But then again how can you not enjoy clips of Glenn's concerts?  Having seen Glenn Tilbrook live last year in Ann Arbor it brought back a lot of very happy emotions for me.  Expected a little more music in the movie but enjoyed what was there. Would've liked to have heard more of his solo work instead of just Squeeze tunes.  Also liked the interview with Chris Difford.,1142726400,,394,4.3561643835616435
2443220,5,B000BVNSBQ,"Forget the power trips and the entourage.  Former Squeeze lead singer and guitarist Glenn Tilbrook has traded in 5-star hotels for a semi-functional Cruisemaster RV.  He's traded in Madison Square Garden for intimate acoustic venues.  And he seems happier than ever.

It's a given that anyone who's ever grooved to the music of Squeeze in the 80s (and I know there are lots of you out there) MUST have this movie.

But even if you just need the automatic mood lift you get when you watch someone who absolutely, passionately loves what he's doing...you will still really enjoy this movie!",1142467200,4,588,4.84
2443221,5,B000BVNSBQ,"As a film, the major assets this good-natured documentary has is total access to its' subject and the smarts to take advantage of it. Although it begins with Glenn Tilbrook embarking on a low-budget, seat-of-his-pants tour, his skill and passion as a musician is revealed as anything but low-budget; the same could be said for the documentarian. The apparent joy Glenn brings to his music is beautifully captured, and the enthusiasm of the film-maker for her subject is palpable. This film takes you along on a life-affirming labour of love ride that's just non-stop fun. Highly recommended.",1142467200,3,591,5.103092783505154

2443223,5,B000BVNSBQ,"Glenn Tilbrook, front man for the great 80's band Squeeze, is out there on the road, making people's dreams come true while living out his own. For those that saw him in the big arenas such as Madison Square Garden and never thought they'd get to see him up close and personal, this DVD shows that this is no longer a fantasy. Glenn is a true showman-a talented musician with a great sense of humor and great stage presence. This documentary shows this to all.

Veteran Squeeze fan or not, I think anyone that is interested in seeing what it is like behind the scenes of a music tour would enjoy watching this movie. And for those of us who are veteran Squeeze fans, this is definitely a dream come true. While we all wish Glenn and Squeeze would have huge commercial success again, there is a selfish part of us that is grateful for the small venues where we get to meet and chat with this great man.

The only thing missing from this movie that would make it more perfect than it already is-is an appearance by me-Glenn's biggest fan!",1141948800,2,1036,4.390625

I am a longtime Squeeze fan since 1981 when a dorm hallmate from South Africa via London introuced me to Squeeze, which led to a life long love of british music. I was expecting some live performances, the usual sad story of artists past their prime. I had no idea what an amazing personality Tilbrook has, nor what a great guitarist he is. Its easy to overlook his playing when you think of him as just the singer I suppose. Well worth a watch. I made my wife watch it again with me. All she knew about Squeeze was ""Tempted"" and she liked it too. What a great attitude he has . Very refreshing.",1342915200,,630,4.258333333333334

I still listen to Squeeze almost everyday on my iPod, and yes, I sing along to all the songs, but only when I'm alone. ;)

I sang along to the songs as I watched this, and my only wish was that Glenn had come to my hometown so I could have seen him on one of the tours in the RV. (I loved the part where he introduced himself to the other campers...then finally revealed that he used to be in a band called Squeeze, and they were like, 'OMG! We need to get your autograph!' Turns out they all knew who he was and were big fans!)

From the first moment I heard his voice on MTV, I knew I had to hear every Squeeze song I could get my hands on. I have always considered Glenn to be a very private person and this DVD shows fans his personal side. I found it to be very entertaining but bittersweet. I got the impression that he cared about his fans and loved what he did, but there was also an underlying sadness about him in some of the scenes when he was being interviewed atop a building as he was reflecting on his personal life. My favorite scene was at the campsite when other campers realized who he was. He was so polite and generous having his picture taken with them and signing autographs. I just saw Squeeze and Aimee Mann in concert last month in Royal Oak, MI and it was by far the best show I had ever seen. The sound was fantastic! I vas very happy to see Stephen Large from ""The Fluffers"" on keyboards. I can't wait for another US tour...I'll be there.",1221696000,2,1089,4.240384615384615

The documentary is a funny tour-de-force movie about the adventures of the honey-voiced co-frontman of one of the best and most underrated pop groups of the 80's and 90's, Squeeze. Featuring acoustic performances of many of the group's hits as well as a few of Glenn Tilbrook's solo songs, the fast-paced film follows Glenn's RV tour from upstate New York to L.A., with unforgettable fan encounters along the way. If you're a fan of Squeeze, you MUST see this movie. If you're not a fan of Squeeze, pick up a copy of ""Singles: 45's and Under"" when buying your copy. Better yet, throw in the discs ""Argybargy"" and ""East Side Story""; you'll be glad you did!

The film has a very ""homemade"" vibe to it that lends itself wonderfully to the premise of the documentary.  The Director, Amy Pickard is a long time fan of Squeeze, and indeed her subject Glenn Tilbrook.  She is also a fan of spreading the joy the music has brought her, and this film will make you a fan of Squeeze as well as Glenn Tilbrook.
