8338484,4,B001RPZDZE,"Jules Massenet (1842-1912) wrote more than 30 operas during his lifetime. Cloptre (1912) was his last opera and  was only performed posthumously (1914). The music is thoroughly Massenet's (later) style, closer to Don Quichotte (1910) than to Le roi de Lahore (1877). However, if you enjoy his Thrse (1907), Werther (1892) or Thas (1894), you are likely to enjoy Cloptre.

1. At the time of writing, this is the only DVD for Cloptre. The performance is in an outdoor concert form, recorded in Emperor Adrian's Villa, Tivoli, Italy.

2. The performance is good without being distinguished. The biggest name here is ""of course"" Montserrat Caball. She is good here, but one would in no way mistake her for her supreme former self. (Tone production becomes a problem in her -- in fact, all but very few's -- advanced age. Caball was around 70 when this is recorded(*).) The other singers are mostly young singers from Spain and Italy. They are uniformly good but no stars. The conductor is Italian (by name) and the orchestra players are young musicians from Mediterranean area. What I like about this mostly young ensemble is passion and enthusiasm. One thing (to my ear anyway) lacking in the performance is the ""French style"", as witness in, e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elie-Cohen-s-1931-performance/dp/B000005GOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elie Cohen's 1931 performance</a>. The opera under these mediterranean musicians sound more Italian than French to me.

3. For an outdoor performance, the recorded sound is adequate. Technically, the video is in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen format and audio is uncompressed LPCM. English subtitles are included.

4. Another reviewer complained about the defects of his DVD, but my DVD plays just fine all the way through. (I tested it on my oldest, and ""choosiest"", DVD player, which is a Japanese-made Panasonic.)

If you like Jules Massenet on DVD, this one, while in no way definitive, will not disappoint -- if you don't set the expectation too high, that is. Recommended.

(*) The DVD cover prints 2002 while the end credit in DVD displays 2006. Caball was born in 1933.",1416614400,6,2165,5.331378299120234
8338485,3,B001RPZDZE,"Unfortunately as with many American produced DVDs, this disk stops midway and will not play any further. Returning disks doesn't help as they are all made that way. However, I've found that sometimes you can restart the disk and go to the end of the program and back your way into it until you get the the number just after the place that stopped. If you are very lucky you'll get to see the rest of the performance. That's what happens with this disk.
 It's very unfortunate as the performance is excellent. The voices are strong. Caballe's voice is still wonderful and the high notes sung so softly are absolutely melting. I do wish more Massenet operas were being filmed so that those of us who can't attend live performances could still benefit from these wonderful artists' talents.
I gave only 3 stars because of the poorly produced dvd that won't play all the way through.",1326672000,7,879,4.634615384615385
