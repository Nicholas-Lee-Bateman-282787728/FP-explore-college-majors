8764057,5,B01GWDKWWO,"This is one of the most interesting segments within this series.  Les Desmoiselles dAvignon is of immense historical significance; Klimts The Kiss image now appears on thousands of objects and Dalis The Christ of St. John of the Cross has been described as the most important piece of religious art in the twentieth century.

The discussion of the Picasso is perhaps the most interesting, since the work had a deep impact on twentieth-century art.  We learn about Picassos own views of the work, about the techniques that he utilized in producing it and about its (sometimes jejune) antecedents, including contemporary African postcards.  The Klimt piece is also interesting, if less consequential.  One of the most interesting elements is a demonstration of the use of gesso to attach the gold leaf to the mans robe.  The Dali painting is the most controversial.  One of the critics praises it highly while two practicing artists are contemptuous of it.  Dali often evokes these kinds of responses.  We learn about Dalis use of the lake at his home to represent the Sea of Galilee as well as his use of a Hollywood stuntman to get the precise angles, perspective, muscle movements, etc. for the crucified corpus.  I found the commentary by the artists somewhat vapid; they seemed not to be aware of the notion of the Incarnation and its importance to Dalis conception.  There were some interesting comments on the realism within surrealism, but there was no in-depth commentary on the appropriateness of surrealism for Dalis subject.  St. John of the Crosss actual drawing was shown and its importance for the painting was explained.  This was fascinating, as was the background material on the purchase of the painting (along with its copyright) by the city of Glasgow.  A brief interview with Dali on the atomic age, the relationship between religion and science and his own beliefs was very interesting.

This is a superb series.  Each discussion is about 45-50 minutes in length.  The commentators are usually learned and engaging.  Germaine Greer is among their number in this particular disc.",1503792000,,2099,5.034782608695652
