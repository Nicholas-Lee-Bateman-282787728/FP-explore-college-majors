5406300,4,B00AAIRCOO,After using this religiously 3x week for a year my DEXA scan revealed improvement in my bone density from the previous year.  That said im getting pretty tired of this dvd by now.  But the instruction is very clear.  Its not the most professionally produced (sometimes cameras get in the way by mistake) but hey...this dvd really wotks and seems to be one of the best out there on the topic of osteoporosis.  Id also recommend pilates for buff bones by rebekah rotstein.,1390867200,5,470,4.626506024096385
5406301,4,B00AAIRCOO,"After going thru it the first time I thought maybe it was a little slow....so I gave it a chance to work for me.  And it does!  I was very sore after the first week since it moves places I forgot I had.  After 3 weeks I think it""s a great workout for me....65, normal weight but needed toning.  My tummy is tightening which is a plus.  I go thru it every morning and now enjoy Mirabai keeping me on a schedule....40 minutes is worth the benefits.  I am anxious to see my bone density test next year and will look for improvement.  It is worth the money.  Best to everyone.",1386633600,8,572,4.09009009009009
5406302,4,B00AAIRCOO,"I like the way it is divided into six, 10 minute segments. it is very different from the number 1 program and more fun to do. The only thing I am wondering about is that it does not use any leg weights like her other program did.",1384214400,,229,3.893617021276596
5406303,5,B00AAIRCOO,"I have been using Mirabai Holland's original Classic Skeletal Fitness for many years.
This DVD is a great companion to that DVD and has more cardio. The cardio and steps in this DVD are not hard to do and Mirabai is easy to follow. I highly recommend this DVD to add to your collection.",1383004800,2,286,4.314814814814815
5406304,3,B00AAIRCOO,The cardio routine is quite complicated but I can see it could be beneficial once I can get my hands and feet coordinated. It's probably good memory training.  It didn't really raise my heart rate as much as other cardio workouts but the balance exercises are good. I'll persist with it.,1376697600,2,287,4.627450980392157
5406305,5,B00AAIRCOO,"This is one of the best I have and I have many!  Mirabai directs a great workout, love her!  I feel great after after.",1374105600,,118,3.875
5406306,5,B00AAIRCOO,"I love this DVD and use it every other day.  The variety is excellent, and like the alternation of cardio and strength training -- for one thing, it's less boring than many other exercise DVD's I've used.  Mirabai is a good instructor, and I also find her exercises more aesthetically pleasing  than my other exercise DVD's.",1370390400,2,324,4.75
5406307,5,B00AAIRCOO,This is a great exercise routine for anyone...but especially the older crowd!!  Mirabai is good at going slow and using moves that are easy to do for the older person.  I am 67yrs and enjoy the moves and stretches that Mirabi takes you through.  You can repeat the video to even add more cardio!  I even have her first video and alternate days with both videos...skipping the strength training on the 2nd video if I do them on alternate days.,1362787200,2,442,4.4875
5406308,4,B00AAIRCOO,"It is just the right amount of exercise without feeling over done and it is fun to do.
I alternate days with the 2nd DVD.",1359849600,6,121,3.88
8549189,5,B00AAIRCOO,Prompt shippingVery pleased with purchase.,1520985600,,42,7.6
8549190,5,B00AAIRCOO,"Demanding exercises, but well worth to do it. Miss Mirabai is good teacher and it is pleasure to do exercises with her.",1513468800,,119,4.454545454545454
8549191,3,B00AAIRCOO,"At 58 and of average weight and reasonable fitness, I thought this workout was too slow and easy.  It may be very good for a 70-80 year old, but I don't think it does much for someone in my situation.  As for weight-bearing exercises, the dumbbells used appear to be 3lb and may be 5lb for some of the exercises, which in my opinion is not enough to really have any impact on building bone density.  It's a light workout for an older person or someone very overweight, or recovering from mayor illness , etc.  The scenery is beautiful and the music pleasant.  It is not filmed in widescreen format nor HD.",1467763200,,605,4.366071428571429
8549192,3,B00AAIRCOO,The arm work is good but there is really nothing for the legs in this video.,1448582400,,76,3.8125
8549193,3,B00AAIRCOO,I have another older video which I find much easier to follow than this one. The cardio sections gotoo fast for me to follow.,1420243200,,125,4.25
8549194,5,B00AAIRCOO,"This is a well-paced, informative, gentle yet effective full-body workout.  Mirabai has a calm approach, rather than the usual high-energy cheerleader style. Also, her program has a nice flow, so that when I feel like supplementing this workout with a few of my favorite exercises, I just stop the DVD. At 61, I've found that working out with some of short-segment videos I've used for years does not feel as satisfying as this long (approx. 1 hour video). With this, I  add some cardio (a nice walk in the fresh air), and I've got a program here I can stick with.",1418688000,3,564,4.574257425742574
8549195,5,B00AAIRCOO,I love the pacing of this workout. Mirabai Holland sets you up for the next move without slowing things down.,1414022400,,109,4.5
8549196,3,B00AAIRCOO,"I like it, but not as well as the original. If you can only have one, definitely choose the original, which works out the entire body with weights. This one uses weights for upper body only and the cardio sections are not my ""cup of tea"". However, this uncoordinated old woman will persist and hope this helps with my coordination! I'm sure I need to be doing cardio and doing it with Mirabai is better than others I've tried.",1404777600,8,426,4.405063291139241
8549197,5,B00AAIRCOO,"I have advanced osteoporosis especially in my back and this is why I picked this workout.  This is a very smooth workout.  No aerobics, no twisting and no bending.  I still don't have the routine down, so I'm usually a step behind, but that's okay.  It's about 45 minutes long.  I use 3 and 5 pound weights as recommended by my doctor.",1404000000,,335,4.338709677419355
8549198,5,B00AAIRCOO,"I'm a 70+ active senior who bought this video to work on my upper body, bone/muscle strength and balance, which I was not getting on the Y's machines. I like everything about it - the presenter (great voice & manner), @50 minutes in 6 separate segments, pushups are done against a railing or wall, no getting on the floor but just a very good workout that puts me through the paces. I use 2 sets of hand weights 3 lb & 5 lb. I've been using this for @3 months fine tuning my ability to get the moves; and can see & feel the benefits. Along with this video I bought another pilate video and a book, neither of which I can recommend. ""Skeletal Fitness 2"" is the workout video I can live with and enjoy.",1399248000,8,700,4.154411764705882
