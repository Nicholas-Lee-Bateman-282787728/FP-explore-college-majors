8140426,3,B000HLDDEC,"I love asian horror and South Korea being my favorite. Not bad for a made for TV series running at 48 minutes long. This is 1 of 4 stories and unfortunately for me I'm not able to find any sellers on Amazon or Ebay for the other 3. These stories are not your over the top horror frenzy as they are of course made for TV, but I enjoyed this copy for what it was worth. I was surprise the picture was clear for being an old DVD print, wasn't hazy or grainy like I would expect on older print DVD's. This is a good series to own for any asian horror fan. Just don't have high expectations going into it and you'll appreciate the series for what its worth.",1421020800,,652,4.023076923076923
