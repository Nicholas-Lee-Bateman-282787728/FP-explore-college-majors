8604553,5,B00EE6IBW0,A first rate DVD both in sound and picture quality not to mention Helene's playing!,1431129600,,83,4.6
8604554,5,B00EE6IBW0,Helene Grimaud is a tremendous modern day classical pianist. I might liken her to the great Lili Kraus of years ago. Her style and technical skills at playing classical piano pieces are par excellence. She does all of her pieces with utmost accuracy and exactness while still adding creativity and little nuances to her classical piano style. A great purchase and a lovely piece to hear.,1426118400,,387,4.878787878787879
8604555,5,B00EE6IBW0,"I saw Helene Grimaud perform with the Canton [Ohio] Symphony Orchestra many, many years, and she blew me away! Since then, I have been buying every single DVD she has been on. In other words, I am a bit biased.",1413072000,,210,4.275
8604556,5,B00EE6IBW0,It's always funny to hear the occasional odd person comment that Grimaud's popularity is only based on her looks. A ridiculous statement like that only firmly establishes the fact that the critic has no musical ear what so ever. Grimaud is the best and should for sure be ranked with the greatest pianists of all time. Her depth and sensitivity is so obvious even in her demeanor at the piano. Listen and see for yourself. It's not subtle. And this particular program couldn't be better. A fine addition to any classical collection. Buy it.,1411516800,5,540,4.75531914893617
8604557,5,B00EE6IBW0,"Top notch video and audio. Wonder-full venue and glorious Steinway grand. Then add Helene Grimuad with her extraordinary talent and passion! The touch, the phrasing, The way her pedal control lets the piano reverberate! One cannot ask for more! Bach Beethoven and Brahms at their very best!",1411344000,2,290,5.191489361702128
8604558,5,B00EE6IBW0,"Ms. Grimaud and I are friends. Anything I'd write about her would be biased. I just love and adore her as a Wolf Lover and a person. Her music is very girlishly refine, too.",1407974400,,173,4.117647058823529
