7982641,4,B00008G7QJ,"great service - great movie but this one and Zu Warriors are the same movie. Zu Warriors is just cut down to make it a dshorter film and is in English.  This one is longer, more to the movie and charaters but is dubbed. If you pick one this is it.",1413504000,,247,3.843137254901961
7982642,3,B00008G7QJ,"My title for this review pretty much sums it up. Hark was feeling his oats by busting butt to do the best special effects he could, and he succeeded quite well, actually. The effects are beautiful, overdone at times, but fascinating as imagery.

The problem is the movie is way too long. It seems to go on forever, leaving the viewer cross-eyed with boredom by the time he gets to all the great special effects at the end of the film. There's also no sense of humor in this film as there is in ""Chinese Ghost Story."" Good luck!",1327795200,,527,4.3232323232323235
7982643,5,B00008G7QJ,"The original Hong Kong version really is an incredible piece of work. I enjoyed the heck out of it. However it does require that you view it with a certain frame of mind. Most importantly you have to understand that it is not a character drama. There is little range of depth to any of the characters. They exist only to serve their various roles in the story. Think of it as if it were a legend passed down through the ages (like classic Greek mythology). In such legends you always hear the story told through a series of actions and outcomes. You're never given any insight into what drives the characters and we never see more than one side of them. They just represent these sort of unchanging idealized personas. The stories that come from this are fascinating nevertheless. So in this way The Legend of Zu is literally told in the style of a legend.

That said the story is actually quite awesome. The basic premise is again very, very similar to classic Greek mythology: There is a mythical mountain range in China called Zu. Its highest peak, shrouded in mists, reaches up into the heavens. This place is populated by immortal beings who, in their scattered temples, have devoted themselves to various schools of thought. Across centuries they've honed their skills in the martial arts and have attuned their spirits to the forces of the universe. It is their task to maintain order and balance in the universe so that man can live in harmony with nature. Their actions influence the fates of the mortals below. Trouble arises when an unstoppable entity of pure evil calling itself Insomnia threatens to overthrow the most powerful school in the heavens, the Omei clan, and throw the world into an eternity of discord.

The story is steeped heavily in Chinese lore so some parts are a bit esoteric, granted, but for the most part it's easy to follow if you can just keep up with it. There is a user on imdb who wrote ""The most soulful, spiritual film I've ever seen,"" and I think I might have to agree with him. One of the more interesting aspects of the mythology is that just as the warrior has a spirit, so too does his or her weapon. As the warrior achieves mastery with the weapon their two souls act as one; until finally their sword is no longer a physical object but rather an extension of the warrior's own spirit, capable of unleashing devastating effects and allowing the possessor to fly. The weapons are all so unique in form and function that it makes the battle scenes quite unlike anything you've ever seen before in a martial arts film.

The visuals and CGI effects, while perhaps not up to the level of say Lord of the Rings, are utterly stunning to behold. Every frame is like a painting straight from the mind of a creative genius. Matched to the superlative audio the film is quite a treat for the senses. All of this carried along by an engaging, complex, epic narrative and we have ourselves a little gem of a film!  But like I said - you have to be willing and able to both divorce yourself from western conventions and to appreciate the sensibilities and beliefs of a different culture. Step out of yourselves for an hour and fourty minutes and just allow yourselves to enjoy this fun, lighthearted spiritual journey into the world of Chinese legend!",1160611200,3,3284,4.579931972789115
7982644,5,B00008G7QJ,"This MOVIE is way ahead of its time. The special effects, or fireworks as some reviewers put it were well in advance of anything I've seen in Matrix, X-men, Hulk, Spiderman and the like. If your looking for a storyline, plot and all that pick up a book instead of watching a MOVIE. For action packed, VISUAL ectsasy this is one of the greats. CGI is the wave of the future for movies my friends. Hell, the CGI Smigel from LOTR almost got an Oscar didn't he?",1091750400,4,457,4.264367816091954
7982645,3,B00008G7QJ,This movie's plot is a bit hard to follow (or pay attention to ) but the action and effects are absolutely incredible! I bought this movie because I absolutely loved Storm Riders and was hoping this would be as good if not better. You are better off renting it if possible.,1090108800,4,273,4.372549019607843
7982646,2,B00008G7QJ,"This is a great film -- if you're 10 years old, that is. If you happen to be older than 10, you'll find the story lacking, the visual effects overly done to the point of being gratutious, and the action to be horribly unreal. Hong Kong movies have recently deferred to these CGI spectacles in recent years, with actors covered in a sea of CGI, wireworks, and such elaborate special effects that they don't need to know actual martial arts. The result? A standard Hollywood movie on par with anything Keanu Reeves has done. To wit: Nice to look at, but utterly empty.
Note: To the previous reviewer who claims to know so much about Asian/Hong Kong movies -- You don't have a true understand of Asian films, my friend. Your rant is based on anti-American bias and blind devotion to Hong Kong films. The Hong Kong film industry is like any other industry, if not worst -- when they see something that makes money, expect 100 more exactly like it in the next couple of months. Only in Hong Kong could two -- count them, TWO -- sequels could show up in the same year to a successful movie in the PREVIOUS year. Say what you will about Hollywood's output, but they ARE the pioneers of moviemaking. All of the CGI and effects in LEGEND OF ZU were tossed around a zillion Hollywood movies for YEARS before they ever made it to Hong Kong. To say that ALL Hollywood movies are born out of Hong Kong/Asia is to simply show your ignorance and blind devotion to all things Asian, and negativity towards all things American.
My grade: 2 out of 5.",1084665600,6,1532,4.4361702127659575
7982647,4,B00008G7QJ,"Here's a great analogy...  If you think of ""Storm Riders"" as being the ""Star Wars"" of Chinese mythology SPX movies, this might be considered the ""Phantom Menance.""
Miramax threw tons of money at Tsui Hark to make the Quintessential Chinese mythology SPX movie and just like Lucas, he got so carried away with wowing us with monumental scenes that he seems to have forgotten to tell a good story.  People who love to watch movies to explore new exotic lands with magestic visual landscapes and meet a race of immortals, who fly around with swords and have specialized powers, CHECK THIS MOVIE OUT.  People who love to be engaged in rich story, should probably stick with ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" or ""Hero.""",1082246400,2,713,4.827868852459017
7982648,5,B00008G7QJ,"This movie was great. I loved the original Zu warriors, but i especially loved the effects in this one. I say this mainly because i love movies like storm riders, but because of the lack of them i commend tsui hark on making another movie of this genre. Wish i could find more like this.",1081900800,4,287,4.236363636363636
7982649,3,B00008G7QJ,"Tsui Hark's 1983 special effects extravaganza, ""Zu: Warriors of the Magic Mountain"", was one of my all time favorite Chinese swords and sorcery movies.  Using Hollywood-style special effects not seen before in Chinese cinema, ""Zu: Warriors"" broke new ground and created a new generation of Tsui Hark fans.  Tsui would go on to create other Chinese movie classics such as the ""A Chinese Ghost Story"", ""Swordsman"" and ""Once Upon A Time In China"" series.  So it was with great excitement that I greeted the news in 2000 that Tsui was in the process of remaking his 1983 classic for release in 2001.  However, I must admit that I was absolutely disappointed when I finally got to watch ""Legend of Zu"" on the big screen in the summer of 2001.  The plot of ""Legend"" is totally convoluted - it seemed Tsui was more interested in stretching the limits of what he can do with computer generated special effects than in telling a good yarn.  And don't get me wrong - the special effects are mind-boggling for a Chinese movie and look fantastic on the big screen.  The sheer imaginative scale of the visuals created by Tsui's special effects team is amazing - the magical Zu mountain range is innovatively presented as a series of upside-down islands floating on top of mountain peaks - words cannot quite describe the scene, you have to see it on the big screen to feel the magic Tsui has created.  As most Chinese folk will tell you, the mythology of the Chinese swords and sorcery genre is full of gods, demons, superhuman powers and fantastic weapons, and ""Legend"" delivers all these in spades - so much so non-Chinese may be overwhelmed by seemingly nonsensical superhuman feats that make Superman's powers look like child's play.  The sound effects complement the visual effects well, making ""Legend"" one of the best sounding Chinese movies I've seen in a long while.  The Hong Kong version of the DVD that I recently bought includes a DTS soundtrack, which sounds absolutely perfect on my surround sound home theatre system.  But stunning visuals and great sound do not a good movie make.  While the lead actors (Ekin Cheng, Cecilia Cheung, Louis Koo and Zhang Ziyi - all great looking and talented young actors) make valiant efforts to flesh out their characters, the script's frenetic pace simply lets them down.  It took me at least two viewings to grasp all of the important plot points and to understand what the story was all about.  Too many special effects and not enough story telling made the whole movie look like a computer game.  Three stars from me and would someone restrain Tsui the next time he shows signs of going over the top?",1062720000,7,2642,4.737991266375546
