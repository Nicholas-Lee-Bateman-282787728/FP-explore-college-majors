4403911,5,B004LRPUN0,"This is released as part of Art Haus' Walter Felsenstein edition.  Felsenstein, a contemporary of Bertold Brecht, ran the East German Komische Oper from just after World War II to his death.  Felstenstein was famous for his ensemble productions and for the enormous amount of rehearsal time that went into his productions.
  This is a great performance and production and great in an interesting way.  First, let us get the difficulties out of the way.  It is in German and in black and white and since darkness (and, I would guess the contrast or nuances between darkness and light) are important to Felsenstein's conception of the opera, some of the opera is more dimly lit and therefore less clear than one would like.
  What is most interesting about the production is that while it is brillant about the nuances of interaction between the characters, it is almost wholly completely realistic, i.e. there is no sense of ambiguity as part of life, no sense of symbolism, and no sense of a world outside the reach of realism. This Giovanni takes place in a wholly materialistic world (which was probably politically appropriate for Felsenstein in East Germany).  No God or gods, no heaven or hell -- just these particular people.  From this production, one could never understand how Don Giovanni could be described by Kirkegaard and George Bernard Shaw as a force of life.
  The major exception to my statement is the presence of the statue as a statue (not as an old man as in some recent production) in the next to final scene.  And, to be honest, Felsenstein handles the shock of the statue's entrance brilliantly, letting us literally see it only through the reactions of Giovanni and Leoporello.  We ourselves don't get to literally see the statue until the middle of its scene with Giovanni when it asks Giovanni to shake on their agreement.
  The conducting, by the young Zdenek Kosler, is excellent, more powerful than many of his competitors.  All of the acting is better than good with special kudos going to Klara Barlow as Dona Anna - she is the most powerful Anna I have ever seen though there is one veddy silent movie melodramatic moment that some will, unfortunately, find funny - and Rudolf Asmus as Leoporello.  With the exception of the Don Ottavio, all of the singing is at least very good, with Barlow and Gyorgy Melis as Giovanni especially fine  Melis' interpretation of Giovanni is most interesting in his portrayal of the Don as less than a cosmic force that is almost always in control; what is special here is the amount of time he spends reacting to others.  Thus, when he does assert his devil-may-care, oh lets go for the highest possible intensity regardless of consequence, as in the finale of Act I, and the supper scene, his power is more surprising for the contrast.
  We are fortunate enough to have performances of Don Giovanni on DVD directed by three great directors: Peter Brook, Peter Sellars, and Peter Hall.  This one is in their league.",1272412800,4,2983,4.783203125
4403912,5,B004LRPUN0,"This black and white production is sung in German and it was a surprise to me that the change of language made no difference whatever in my ability to enjoy it!  The singing of the cast in this opera is startlingly powerful.  When Klara Barlow as Donna Anna discovered her murdered father, her performance and singing were Elektra-like.  What a voice!  Her eyes expressed great emotion throughout.  I wondered immediately, ""If this is what Donna Anna is like, what will Donna Elvira be like!""  Then, enters John Moulson as Don Ottavio, another fierce singer, who manages to equal her intense portrayal!

Anny Schlemm as Donna Elvira proves another powerful, Wagnerian-like singer.  As Gyorgy Melis, our Don Giovanni, prowls around her as she laments his betrayal, he actually looked goofy and ineffective in the role.  That was the start of my impression that if there were to be a weak acting link in the cast, it would be him.  Fortunately, he got better and no one could fault his singing.

Eva-Maria Baum as Zerlina and Fritz Hubner as Massetto were equally talented singers, but a little over the top as actors.  Rudolf Asmus is a fine Leporello.

And the famous Walter Felsenstein's role in all this?  This was a very good production, true to the composer.  One must appreciate his talent by default.  Compared to the current trend of some directors to impose their own interpretations of/on everything, creating disasters, you could call him a genius.

If you are a Don Giovanni lover, like me, you will enjoy this production.",1267747200,2,1533,4.857142857142857
8434723,5,B004LRPUN0,"If you are not familiar with this opera, it is arguably considered by many as the finest opera ever written. Mozart uses many comedic devises to point out many serious shortcomings in 18th century society. He shows women to be somewhat dim witted and fickle and just to be used for the pleasure of most men....especially the nobility who are anything but ""noble"". I am surprised that some women's organizations have not tried to ban the opera. In any case the opera contains some of the most glorious music ever written.

This is a modern dress version of the opera produced at the Glyndebourne Opera Festival in 2010 and it is very fine indeed. The festival was started in 1934 by wealthy Englishman William Christie who turned  his estate in Sussex into a summer opera festival run by by the great conductor Fritz Bush. It was a vehicle for Christie's opera signing wife Audrey Mildmay; they produced mostly Mozart operas in traditional dress and settings. I guess in order for opera and Mozart to remain relevant for millennials and other young people, a modern setting keeps up the interest and I (77 YO) have to admit that I also really liked this production. The Fellini like ""La Dolce Vita"" party scene in Act II was impressive. To those familiar to the opera, be warned that in this version of ""Giovanni"" ""the ""stone guest"" does not come to dinner and drag ""Giovanni"" the flames of hell; ""The Commedatore"" becomes sort of a zombie and kills ""the Don"".

The young people in this production are all very attractive and look very much the roles they are playing and are, at least for opera singers, consummate actors. If they are not ""golden age"" quality vocalists, they are plenty good. I still prefer Siepi's deep voiced, elegant  ""Don"" to anyone else and similarly, many of the singers of his era, but unfortunately they are not available at this time....They are all long dead.

The stage direction, camera work,lighting scenery, costumes and videography, audio are all first rate. Special plaudits go to  to conductor Jurowski and The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.",1521849600,,2083,4.804469273743017
8434724,5,B004LRPUN0,"I've written a few reviews here at Amazon in my time, a goodly number (no, not up in Santa Fe Listener territory, but still a goodly number), and this is the one I write with the most relish.  If you are alive and breathing, this Don Giovanni will take your breath away, will have you up on the edge of your seat.  All credit, it seems, gets back in the end to the director of this astounding production, Pier Luigi Pizzi, who also doubles as the set designer and who also triples as the costume designer--talk about a singleness of vision here!  I'll get right to it:  After the foreboding opening of the overture, as the tempo perks up the stage curtains open to a dumbshow for the rest of the overture, and what a dumbshow it is:  In it we see Giovanni tumbling out of bed and being dressed for the day's/night's activities by Leporello.  In this process we see Giovanni's self-absorbed vanity, his self-confidence, and his playful relationship with his dresser--already we get insights into the ""giocoso"", the jocundity, in this production, in that it is going to lie in the Giovanni attitude and in the Giovanni/Leporello relationship--no Leporello buffoonery here.  AND, this dumbshow is packed with ACTION, a foretaste of things to come.  And if all that were not enough, we suddenly see two singers, especially D'Arcangelo as Giovanni, who will be totally inhabiting their roles.  Take my word for it:  At NO time in this production will you experience even one solitary moment in which you see the part of Giovanni being actually acted:  Ildebrando D'Arcangelo here is a Force of Nature, a totally self-assured seducer, and totally ""is"" the character.  ""Incandescent"" is how one Italian reviewer described him here--apt indeed.

Now to the opening scenes:  Leporello's first aria is not the usual ""complaint"", but rather we see in it that he wants to be ""just like his master"", living the same kind of life.  Major surprises follow in the Giovanni/Donna Anna opening scene:  There's that bed again, and on it, with Anna on TOP, are the couple.  What??  It soon becomes clear that Giovanni is not attacking, or attempting to rape, Donna Anna (after all, he's a seducer, not a rapist), and she is torn between yielding to it or not--again, lots of ACTION--when all of sudden in comes the Commendatore.  She, who is betrothed to Don Ottavio, has been caught in an embrace with another (masked) man.  (In no other productions is this the case, and yet it all fits with the libretto and arc of the story.)  So now the Anna situation mirrors the Zerlina situation to follow, and we get to see how each of them deals with it.  Suddenly, here, Donna Anna is not the ""usual"" two-dimensional character of other productions, but is now fleshed out as a complex--and real--human being.  Eventually we discover that Anna's approach is going to be to divert Ottavio's attention from all that ""other man"" stuff by overdoing her remorse over her father's dying, to keep him fixed on that.  At the point where she falls into a ""swoon"", Ottavio's calling for something to revive her, she open's her eyes momentarily to check out how it's all going, this hoax.

There is so much to see here, to notice!  Later, when Anna is dressed ""in mourning"", with a black dress (low-cut, of course, as they all are here), a black wide-brimmed hat and a long veil, she starts removing said veil and hat after she and Ottavio have run in to Giovanni.  Why??  She's picking up his allure as a sexual animal and she as a sexual woman--and then it is THAT that suggests to her that he might be/must be the same man whom she was embracing and who killed her father.  All this conveys to us that, at the end of the opera when she tells Ottavio that she wants to ""mourn"" for a year before they marry, she's actually thinking--her sexuality having been fully awakened by Don G.--that she's going to go looking in the next year for some other man who turns her on as Don G. did and marry him instead.  I could go on and on here, and would love so to do!  But, on to the music and other stuff:

The singers:  D'Arcangelo:  amazing and glorious in his rich bass-baritone, and again, he inhabits the role like no one before him.  Andrea Concetti (Leporello):  excellent actor and a stalwart baritone.  Myrto Papatanasiu (nee Papathanasiou--altered by her for Italian speakers; go figure) (Donna Anna):  A very good actress with a minimum of semaphoric gestures and an absolutely glorious voice:  sweet, strong, beautiful, superbly supported, top-to-bottom.  She spins out a magnificent long melodic line, as in ""Non mi dir"".  She's good-looking to boot.  I rate her the TOP of all Donna Anna's I have heard (!), as I rate D'Arcangelo the top of all Don Giovanni's.  Carmela Remigio (Donna Elvira):  She comes alive in this production--once more, a three-dimensional woman.  Excellent actress with a fine voice who ""knocks it out of the park"" in the ""Mi tradi"" scene:  gloriously sung and sensually acted.  (By the way, note how Pizzi turns the Catalog Aria on its head here, revealing a great deal about both Elvira and Leporello.)  Marlin Miller (Ottavio):  Excellent tenor, but I will give him short shrift here in order to get to...  Manuela Besceglie (Zerlina):  She, like Anna before her, has to deal with her having messed around with Giovanni on her wedding day, and she uses a different approach:  Her ""Batti, batti"" is totally ironic (like the incomparable Bidu Sayao's long ago) and she will use her own seductive powers over Masetto to reel him back in.  Excellent singer as well.  William Corro (Masetto):  No country bumpkin/simpleton he.  He sees clearly that Zerlina is a ""hussy"", but, being a typical male, he ultimately cannot resist her sexuality.

Riccardo Frizza, the conductor, is superb here, fully realizing the music, aided by (surprisingly, to my ears) excellent sonics.  Sets:  totally minimal, focusing the action (the ACTION) where it needs to be, not diverting our attention.  Costumes:  18th century, sexy, summer-in-Tuscany colors.

I could go on and on here, and, in fact, I want so to do.  But I won't.  In sum, this is a production with so much LIFE in it that it weds magnificently with the life in the music.  It's an absolutely masterful achievement.  If you were to own only one DVD of ""Don Giovanni"", should this be it?  Without question.",1447286400,3,6342,4.741994510521501
8434725,3,B004LRPUN0,"Despite some excellent singing, this ""Don Giovanni"" absolutely doesn't add anything to the list of other available ""Don Giovanni""s.
I bought it because of Gerald Finley and Luca Pisaroni, neither of which disappointed. However, the production is neither here nor there. I have a lovely, traditional, actually intimate ""Meistersinger"" from Glyndebourne and expected something similar. No way.
If you go for the voices, great. Other than that, it may not add anything insightful to your collection.",1426291200,,496,5.5394736842105265

8434727,5,B004LRPUN0,"This performance is being released almost simultaneously with one from Royal Opera House and is very likely to be overlooked simply because it is not cast with the usual lineup of international singers. Interestingly enough the cast is virtually all Italian, the excepetions are the Anna. Papatatansiu who is Greek and Marlin Miller. the Ottavio who is American. The conductor is Roberto Frizza who does not appear to specialize in any particular genre, but who has clearly listened to HIP performances and his tempi are brisk and spot on with the ensembles utterly exhilirating. His orchestra may not be the Vienna Philarmonic, they may even be an ad hoc group since this performance is a document of a summer festival. Do not fear: they play Mozart as well as any major group.

The Don is a role made for Ildebrando d'Arcangelo. He is sexy, has a sense of Mozartian style (listen to his Figaro from Scala) a superb actor and possesses a virile bass voice of great beauty. To the best of my knowledge he has not sung at the Met--our loss. His Leporello is Andrea Concetti; together they form the only relationship that the Don has experienced. Indeed someone on the internet has referred to this performance as the ""homoerotic"" Don. I suppose we can read into this what we want to; I suspect someone simply has a vivid imagination.

The  productiion is minamalist with reflective panel and piecs of furniture--a bed, a table a chair. Not as bare as the Loy Abduction from the Liceu, bur for those requiring ""sets""................The period is evoked by the costumes. This is clearly not a personregie ""konzept"".

The Anna and Elvira are exciting performers, who are able to sing the music with great style and technique although occationally pressed by the vocal demands. The Zerlina and Masetto are unknown to me but also sing Mozart as to the manner born. We associate Mozart with Vienna/Salzburg or ROH/Sussex and sometimes Berlin but the three DaPonte operas are Italian and they benefit being sung with singers who can claim Italian as their native language, notably in the recits, nimble alert and dramatically sensitive.",1415404800,10,2128,4.919220055710307
8434728,1,B004LRPUN0,We are extremely disappointed by defective copy.  It stopped and started over a dozen times and froze altogther early in La Ci Darem La Mano.  MEGA Media shipped this terrible product.  We will try to return it.,1390608000,,211,4.648648648648648
8434729,2,B004LRPUN0,"Unlike other reviewer who praises Jurowski, I found the orchestra very disappointing from the first. Winds and timpani are too emphasized (especially, at dramatic moments like the last scene) to hear strings -- this is a very cheap way to create climax, which, however, is Not Mozart. Just compare Jurowski's overture with Muti's at Wiener Staatsoper (1999) on Youtube, and you will notice totally different music, even though I admit that OAE is not VPO and Jurowski is not Muti.",1388793600,2,480,5.0125
8434730,5,B004LRPUN0,"Great performance of this timeless classic.  Both the acting and the singing were terrific. The characters were multi-faceted, showing the levels of interaction with Don Giovanni as a person.",1365897600,,191,5.586206896551724
8434731,4,B004LRPUN0,Conductor Wladmir Jurowski shows us his great talent in this fine production of Don Giovanni. Maestro Jurowski brings out subtle nuances in the orchestra and is supportive of his singers. Gerald Finley as Don Giovanni and Luca Pisaroni as Leporello are outstanding in their roles! Glyndebourne has a winner here.,1311465600,6,312,5.26
8434732,3,B004LRPUN0,"The concept behind Jonathan Kent's production of Don Giovanni for Glyndebourne 2010 is somewhat tenuous in how its 1950s' setting relates to the pre-Enlightenment years of the opera's original period, but it proves to be not entirely without merit. It's not that Don Giovanni doesn't bear up well to modern interpretations - it's perhaps the Mozart opera most apt and subject to contemporary reworking - it's just that, even with the free-love of the 1960s just around the corner, the production's supposed ""Fellini-esque vision of post-war life"" doesn't succeed in grasping the spirit of the period or present all that convincing a parallel to the Age of Enlightenment.

The production at least starts off like it intends to make something of the risqu premise of Mozart's opera, with a quite brutal enactment of the rape and murder scene, but thereafter, it settles down to a rather non-committal blandness. The 1950s' setting doesn't really suit the wider European expansive viewpoint of the continental philanderer, but rather closes it down without seeming to bring any exciting or meaningful new ideas to the table in its place. The drabness and unimaginativeness of the setting (although technically impressive) is unfortunately reflected in the performances, which rather lack commitment. Everyone, but everyone - particularly Anna Samuil's Donna Anna - seems to walk around in a trance, scarcely showing any feeling or expression of the predilections and predicaments of their characters. The singing is generally fine throughout, with a delicate touch - the same can be said about the orchestration by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment on period instruments under the direction of Vladimir Jurowski - all very nicely and smoothly played, but much too nicely, with no passion, no torment, no raging desire and no agony of betrayal.

It's only towards the end of Act 1 that the purpose of the setting and the Fellini-esque elements come into play, with a wonderfully hedonistic party straight out of La Dolce Vita. For all the lack of fire elsewhere, the close to the first Act quite literally sets the stage alight, as the Don Giovanni's ambitions are unmasked at the party by his guests, their accusations directed forcefully against the libertine, and with it a condemnation that prefigures of the damnation of the nobleman for his crimes against humanity. With his Polaroids of the Don's conquests, Luca Pisaroni's Leporello here then is the Paparazzo to the Gerald Finley's Marcello, the two of them on a search for the ultimate high in the swinging lifestyle of the rich and famous. Like Marcello, Don Giovanni has pushed his hedonistic excesses to their limit, losing his humanity in the process, and his only recourse is towards the spiritual or the supernatural. Don Giovanni's downfall here then lies not so much in any kind of divine or infernal retribution as much as the inevitable result of his hubris for believing himself above mere mortals and worthy of consorting with those on an unearthly plane.

The concept behind the staging comes briefly through at this point, but although it provides one or two other fine moments (a tender scene between Zerlina and Masetto and a blood-spurting finale that is more Night of the Living Dead than La Dolce Vita), the remainder of the production unfortunately seems to rather go through the motions of delivering the story and its moral without adding anything new or challenging to the conventional line. The singers likewise seem to concentrate on delivering their lines and on hitting all the right notes at the right points, but without any real fire or ambition. All in all, it's a fine production that keeps the story accessible and meaningful, but there's not much here that can be said to be truly memorable.",1301270400,16,3789,5.068910256410256
