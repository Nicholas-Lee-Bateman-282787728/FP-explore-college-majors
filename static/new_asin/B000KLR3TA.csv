8158045,5,B000KLR3TA,Exactly what I wanted.  Superb!  145 gorgeous Renoir paintings presented with your choice of music- four styles to choose from.  I couldn't be more pleased.  Beware of another DVD with same concept that displays Renoir works that look distorted.,1494288000,,245,5.205128205128205
