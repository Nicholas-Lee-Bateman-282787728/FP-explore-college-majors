4487562,5,B004WMFQ06,"Didn't expect to but I really did like this movie best of all it isn't the usual run of the mill zombie movie with blood and guts everywhere there is minimal gore which I find to be a refreshing change

Plot

1 The dillweed twins I call them number 1 digs a whole finds a meteor tells dillweed number 2 to get the wheelbarrow so he goes and fetches it. When number 2 returns they wheel it into town and set it on the ground, but wait it gets better Dingus McStupid hits it with a pickax releasing a zillion spores infecting everyone. NOTE hey idiots dig a whole find green glowing thing swiftly recover it and run like hell, Duh

2 Handsome Rick Mora plays the young Indian warrior falsely accused of the rape and murder of a white woman whose father sent a bounty hunter after him, There is an interesting revelation made later on when he and the bounty hunter one day sit down and talk sharing history

3 The bounty hunter who was sent to track down and capture the Indian man arrives in town leaves his horse with an older guy to take care of. He then sets out to track his prey, he also has a tale of his own to tell

4 The beautiful blond girl in distress is rescued from a man trying to sell her by the bounty hunter and taken away, they end up traveling together. Later on they meet up with the Indian warrior who bounty hunter learns the truth

5 As they say the crap hits the fan when the freaking zombies start popping up. This little gem has minimal blood and gore and the film plot and characters run smoothly at a nice pace. At first I totally expected to hate but it turned out better than expected",1434844800,,1612,4.167202572347267

4487586,3,B004WMFQ06,"Lots of people went over the plot... no point in re-hashing here. A small point seemingly missed by some: I notice a lot of people get mad about the whole native american raping a white woman story, which is funny, because he explains that they had been seeing each other for quite some time and that her father made that story up to get him for various reasons; so that part of the plot is actually about the boring and too usual these days ""evil lying racist white man."" I do understand that this movie might have been a bit boring to some to follow the dialogue that far, though.

This is a low budget film, though the actual video quality seemed pretty good. So a decent camera was used, at least. I found it mildly amusing. I don't really expect much of a plot, any good dialogue, or even good acting in a film of this sort. I'm just kind of a zombie movie nut so I watch a lot of horrible movies hoping to be surprised. This wasn't horrible. I wish more genre mash-ups would happen, to be honest. Why no one has done a medieval zombie movie, I don't know. Perhaps its a budget thing, but you would think the hollywood types would jump on simple movie ideas like that. It isn't like these types of films are the only source of horrible cinema. Lots of big budget flops out there.

Getting back to THIS film, though, I found it mildly entertaining.

Anybody with firearms knowledge will probably be annoyed. They use a lot of cap and ball revolvers but keep loading cartridges into them. Revolvers firing upwards of a couple dozen shots before reloading can certainly be forgiven in a movie, though. The lack of skill in even cocking the hammer on one of them, by people who are supposed to be good with such firearms, is a tad annoying. Takes me out of the moment when it takes the gunfighter 5 tries to cock the hammer on a pistol... that jams every 30 seconds anyway. Fix your pistol.

I loved the blind zombie. That portion of the film was nice, making it worth watching the film. The rest was kind of boring, a little obfuscated by a flat overall delivery. Make-up was decent, some better than others, but pretty good considering. The couple of random boobage moments was a little cheap as a tool of keeping some interested, but it obviously still works for a lot of guys and annoys most of the ladies. Personally, I didn't care one way or another. Its kind of a staple of ""horror"" films, anyway.

For free, there's not a lot to complain about. There are far worse films than this out there, and it was mildly entertaining with some potential to be a lot better. Oh, and I liked the semi-surprise near-ending to the movie (to try and avoid a spoiler here). While perhaps not all that surprising, it left me some doubt for a few seconds, thinking I might actually see a sad ending.

If you're a zombie movie fan/fiend, its worth a watch. If you're more of a casual movie watcher, I would skip it unless you're feeling forgiving.",1384300800,2,2936,4.397790055248619
4487587,2,B004WMFQ06,"I didn't hate it, therefore not one star. But close...

Let me put it this way: I've been *in* better movies than this. The plot crosses the path of a wayward bounty hunter, his falsely-accused bounty, and a damsel in distress with that of radioactive-meteor-infected townsfolk who get hungry for human flesh. Hilarity ensues. Of course, by hilarity I mean boredom.

The actors sort of try, but the director certainly isn't good at eliciting anything remotely close to an emotion. The star, David A. Lockhart, is particularly stone-faced throughout, though Rick Mora is appropriately dour. The sets resembled that of the pan-back scene at the end of 'Blazing Saddles'. Digital blood was kinda fun, while makeup effects were rudimentary and sub-par to the work of 'Face Off' contestants. Perhaps some viewers will enjoy the pointlessly topless ladies a few times, but otherwise? I paid three bucks for this. It was two dollars too much.",1382832000,,935,5.064935064935065

4487592,3,B004WMFQ06,"My daughter gave this film 1 star--commenting to me ""If it was worth that ..."" I looked at the other reviews and wondered if I was wasting an hour and half of my life by watching this thing. It wasn't a waste. My husband and I had several good laughs as we watched this amazing indie production. I don't think the people producing the film intended the laughs, but it was funny.

Overall comments, first, Mr. Perez: It is bad form for an author/writer/director to review his/her work. Get your friends to do it. Second, acting lessons all around would be good, except for the zombies, who really had it down. Third, Stephen King gave the greatest writing lesson: ""Omit unnecessary words."" (That might have been Stephen quoting the Chicago Manual of Style.) This assumes that you've found the NECESSARY words to start with. Fourth, why are American Indians assumed to speak in a stilted fashion? Why don't they just talk like people? Fifth, and this drives me crazy, people riding horses in movies should know how to ride. Lockhart didn't. How do I know? I've ridden and shown horses most of my life. Details matter.

And yes, those were telegraph poles.

I watched this film because I'm a Rick Mora fan. (He's the Indian.) I wanted to see more of him. (If he'd been a female member of the cast, I would have gotten to see MUCH more of him, but I will not get into unnecessary display of boobage here.) Rick is gorgeous and I think ill-served by stilted dialogue and a stereotyped role. I hope he can find a better showcase for his talents.

With all this criticism, why did I give it 3 stars? It really is astonishing. I've never seen anything like it. I'd watch the next production of this crew, especially if they take this review to heart.",1368835200,,1742,4.538216560509555

4487596,2,B004WMFQ06,"I'm not a huge fan of zombie movies that explain the zombies but I do like zombie movies that try to set themselves apart from the rest. The western setting is a good setting for this type of movie. The problem is the movie itself. It's just not done well. I didn't mind the low budget or the acting, it was more the story that seemed to fall flat. It was almost like it tried to be better than it should be, but really fell flat across the board. There was also a problem with the nudity which was very, very forced. Any time a female character seemed to be in danger, her top fell off. I like breasts, but it got very silly very quickly.",1362009600,,639,4.079365079365079
4487597,2,B004WMFQ06,"Some Spoilers.

I'm going to keep this review short. I found the story to be very straight forward and nothing interesting to say about it.

It's about this bounty hunter wanting to capture an Indian that is accused of raping and killing this white girl. The reward for the Indian is $1,000 and to be captured alive. While that is all going on, you got these two town's people that went off in the woods somewhere and brought back this rock that glows. They break open the rock and out comes some sort of green mist. The whole town then gets infected. The town's people turn into zombies. Some of the zombies go out into the woods and find and try to kill the bounty hunter, Indian, and this other white girl. But, they fail to do so. When the bounty hunter, Indian, and the girl go back into town they found out that the whole town is zombies. Now they have to find a way out of town before they all die.

Now for something to really write about. Wow!!!! The 3 topless girls in the movie!!! That's just about the best thing there was in the whole movie. Maybe that's why it's two stars! Without those girls, this movie is a 1 star movie. Nothing really interesting in the whole movie and below I will say more about it but will have spoilers. But, wow, look at those HOT GIRLS!!! They're just pretty okay, when clothed, but HOT when naked like that!

So, if you want to see hot naked girls in a bad movie - this is it!!!

Spoilers below

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now for why this is a bad movie. I found the acting to be very amateur and script pretty bad. The ending was okay, but I didn't like how it ends. I know the ending makes sense, but seeing everyone dying at the end - I just did't like it. But, the endless amount of zombies coming out of no where and seeing how it looked to me that the last 3 people killed all the zombies and then seeing a whole new wave of zombies, didn't make that much sense, then they all must die!",1351036800,2,1984,4.345945945945946
4487598,1,B004WMFQ06,"First, Amazon seriously needs to investigate the reviews for this movie.
Several of them are probably shills.
How could anyone give this movie (I use the term loosely) five stars? Seriously!

Oh ya, except for one ""Rene Perez"". Who just happens to be the actual Director/Composer/Writer for this monstrosity.
Do you see Steven Spielberg or Martin Scorsese come here and give five star ratings for their own movies?
Of course not, and this should be a big tip off how bad this is.

I was interested in seeing it mainly because I happen to know the real James Town California.
I saw little if any of actual James Town in it.
Actually the town in the ""film"" looked like some cheap tourist photo-opt facade thing.
Furthermore the ""buildings"" were oddly miniature in like 3/4 scale or something!

The acting is pitiful, the ""special effects"" look like amateur PhotoShop or AfterEffects, it's boring, too many continuity errors to mention.  I like how you can see modern telephone poles (assume they are telegraphs?), modern buildings in the distance, etc.

First problem, these are not zombies.  They are mutants of some kind.
Some of the gore special effects are superimposed by a computer and is noticeable.
The high-lights of the film were when the women were topless, and when the
blind mutant was after the woman.  The make-up effects are pretty good.  The dvd cover is
very misleading because none of the mutants were shooting it out with their own guns.

Meanwhile there is a subplot of a meteor being found in a farmer's field with fluorescent green stuff and no Steven King.

The meteor turns the town's folk into the fast moving zombies as opposed to the raise from the dead variety.

You know I've watched this movie several times and it
still holds my attention the whole way through. It is
intriguing and exciting and despite the low budget it
delivers. I think there could have been more of a story
line but David Lockhart, Rick Mora and Camille Montgomery
give awesome performances. For a low budget film I was
delighted with the details of the zombies especially the
blind one. It has many great scenes and even though
limited in the scenery and props the suspense and
blood spatters were realistic and well done and made up
for that other stuff. The scene showing Brother Wolf's
demise was heart wrenching to me
because the whole way through you are rooting for these
men to win against the zombies. The movie had it had
more special affects and a more involved story would
have been all the boost it needed. The movie was
awesome itself a great zombie flick that I don't mind
watching over again. The ending wasn't that good even
though ironic it could have been explored a bit more.
This move was well done and casting was perfect they
all were on the same creative wavelength in their
scenes and their teamwork was awesome. If you like
zombie flicks I recommend it most definitely keeping'

The story line was fine and the gore was okay...those are the things that would have been overlooked or seen as quirky if the movie had been even halfway good...hell, a quarter of the way good.

I'll be honest: I expected a low-budget film called Cowboys and Zombies to be cheesy. Cheesy doesn't necessarily mean bad, but it rarely means good.

However this impressive film defied my expectations and proved to be not just good but frankly terrific. And not cheesy in the slightest. Well, maybe a tiny bit near the start. But no, let's be honest. Cowboys and Zombies is not only a good zombie movie, it's actually a good western too. And like all right-minded people, I love a good western.

David Lockhart (who starred in two Crow fanfilms) is Mortimer, a bounty hunter who is introduced to us in an opening shoot-out. Although I'm never a fan of starting a film with an action sequence because we don't yet know or care about any characters, we can at least surmise who we should be rooting for. Yes, he's got a black hat but he's considerably better-looking than his opponent so he's either a hero or an anti-hero. He'll turn out to be a bit of both.

Mortimer is a bounty hunter for financial reasons; not greed but because he needs the money for a good purpose (which we find out later). The next assignment he takes on is tracking down Brother Wolf, an Apache who is wanted for the rape and murder of a white woman.

Displaying a gloriously amoral approach, Mortimer buys a blonde from a guy (Colin Hussey, who did a voice for a Next Gen video game) who is trying to make an honest buck by transporting young women out to the west and selling them as wives (or, if that fails, whores). This is Rhiannon (Camille Montgomery) who is a feisty, independent spirit but Mortimer doesn't care. He takes her out to a location where the redskin might be, ties her to a peg in the ground and retires to a distance, leaving Rhiannon there like a tethered goat. (The IMDB calls her Rhianna but it sounds like Rhiannon on the film so that's what I'm going with.)

When Brother Wolf turns up we can instantly see that this won't be a western of black and white morality but nor will it be a modern, apologist, revisionist western. Writer-director Rene Perez isn't interested in cowboys'n'Indians, he's interested in this cowboy and this Indian: fully rounded characters and individuals. (Brother Wolf is played by strapping actor/model Rick Mora who is of genuine Apache descent and had a tiny role in a flashback sequence in Twilight.)

The bounty is payable on bringing in the Injun alive and Mortimer takes him prisoner but only after a well-directed, well-choreographed fight between the two. Without making a fuss about it, we can see how Perez sets up the white man's semi-formal fisticuffs against the red man's more freeform fighting style, telling us a great deal about each character.

Characters, as I believe I have noted in other reviews, are defined by their relationships with each other and Cowboys and Zombies does a cracking job of working and melding relationships to reveal, define and explore character. But first there's the little matter of zombies.

This is the slightly cheesy bit. A couple of prospectors discover a green-glowing rock and take it back to town where the townsfolk gather round to unwisely watch one of the prospectors try to smash the thing open with a pick-axe. Unsurprisingly, this cracks the `rock' open releasing a cheap, computer-animated sparkly green gas which before long has turned everyone into lurching mutants with distorted faces and a tendency to chomp down on anything living. Zombies basically, although obviously the word is never used.

On the way back to town, Mortimer, Brother Wolf and Rhiannon encounter a rival, German bounty hunter (Austrian bodybuilder Robert Amstler, who was Arnie's body-double in Terminator 3) and we get another shootout during which the first zombie appears and this is what I mean about character and relationships because there are so many relationships pointing in so many directions here. Mortimer and `The German' are fighting over possession of Brother Wolf, who must be kept alive. Mortimer doesn't care about Rhiannon and expects her to leave because, having served her purpose, she's free to go. But she feels a responsibility towards Brother Wolf who showed her compassion when she was tethered.

Then you throw the zombie into the mix, advancing on Brother Wolf (who is now tethered himself) and Rhiannon. It's an adroitly handled melange of connections between characters which goes much deeper then simple protagonist-antagonist. And all this while two cowboys are blasting away at each other and a zombie's trying to catch and eat someone!

One of the things I really loved about this movie was that characters behaved realistically, sensibly and consistently. Arriving in the deserted town, and now fully aware that it is in both their interests to collaborate, the two men decide to hole up in the hotel with Rhiannon. Which leads to probably the film's most memorable sequence as Rhiannon is stalked by a blind zombie, a hideously deformed once-was-woman tracking its prey by sound (brilliantly played by Lauren C Kelly). This is a fantastically clever and tense sequence and worth the price of admission alone.

With a small principal cast of solid actors, effective use of a standing frontier town set, and skilful direction that manages to be clever without pretentious, plus a well-honed script that doesn't waste a word, Cowboys and Zombies is great viewing. Exciting, sometimes scary, never silly or self-indulgent and a commendably taught 82 minutes. If the camera-work sometimes betrays its video origins, that's not enough to distract from an overall impressive B-movie.

The pace is perfectly judged, moving from deft action scenes (including an audacious `first-person-shooter' sequence!) to characterisation, notably a confessional scene between the two men which feels like so much more than two guys sitting on chairs telling each other about their lives. We find out why Brother Wolf really has a bounty on his head and why Mortimer really needs that money and both revelations add to our understanding of who these men are and why they do the things they do.

Perez, Amstler, cinematographer Paul Nordin, co-writer Barry Massoni and producer Mattia Borrani are part of a music/film-making collective called iDIC whose other movies include martial arts actioners War Machine and Ninja Warpath (the trailers for which, to be honest, look completely interchangeable). Most recently Perez has directed vampire feature Obsidian Hearts. Ed Martinez (Black Devil Doll, Death Row) supplied the imaginative make-up effects. Originally called The Dead and the Damned, the film was retitled for its UK release to opportunistically cash in on a certain Harrison Ford picture.

4487610,2,B004WMFQ06,"The Dead and the Damned is presented by Inception Media Group as an action-packed mutant zombie movie in widescreen and digital surround sound.

Mortimer, played by David A. Lockhart, is a bounty hunter in search of criminals. He is a man with a mission, working to collect enough money for his pregnant girlfriend to save the family ranch. His latest gig is to bring back alive Brother Wolf (Rick Mora) who, it's claimed, raped and killed a white girl from a prominent family.

After Mortimer buys Rhianna (Camille Montgomery), being sold in town, he takes her into the woods to trap Brother Wolf. After tying her up as bait, he sets himself up to ambush the man. While waiting, he nods off and Brother Wolf removes the bullets from his gun. Mortimer must now rely on his wits and his fists to capture his quarry.

Unbeknownst to the trio, back in town, miners have found a weird rock, and after digging it up, they return to the town to show off their prize. The townsfolk are bewildered and after cracking it open, spores pour out infecting everyone in the immediate vicinity.

Back in the woods, Mortimer has finally captured Brother Wolf alive. He has him bound and shackled, however, on the way back to town, Mortimer is shot at by another bounty hunter, The German (Robert Amstler). After an exchange of gunfire, The German is attacked by the mutant zombies, allowing the threesome to get away.

Not knowing what they are in for, the three come to realize that the woods are full of these demons and quickly head back to town. After arriving back in Jamestown, they find it empty of townsfolk and decide to hole up for the night in the town's saloon. After a relative calm, all hell breaks loose as the mutant zombies come to feed. Will they get out alive or become one of the hungry, mutant dead themselves??

The Dead and the Damned definitely falls into your B class of movie; the sets and costumes are not as authentic as you would wish. You can notice the sewing machine stitching in Brother Wolf's pants and the town is made of plywood, which was not invented until World War II. The acting is second rate and the plot is minimal at best.

Written and Directed by Rene Perez, this movie has many interesting aspects that could have been more substantially developed, but instead we are left with scenes of gratuitous breast shots without any real significance to the movie. In one scene, we are shown a young woman bathing in the middle of nowhere. Standing behind the bushes is one of the men who find the meteorite, however, there is no real substance of why this scene is included, other than to show some female skin. I found it to be tasteless and not required.

We are not shown when the meteorite actually falls, nor how the two men find it. There is absolutely no back story on the meteorite and I felt it was a significant part of the story that was lacking. I could see where the director wished to go with this film, and with better editing, these things may have been included, however, the editing aspects of the film may have hindered its overall presentation.

I loved the zombies and thought the makeup was great!! The special effects were decent for a low budget film as well as, some of the extras gave a great performance. With a little more experience, I can see Camille Montgomery performing in more productions of this genre. She played a great victim.
