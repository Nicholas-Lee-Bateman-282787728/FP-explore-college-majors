8409956,4,B003Z7ROVI,"If this were a painting it would be by Dali or Miro.  The plot is as follows: A young writer, Zeta,  is commissioned to ghostwrite a novel for another writer (Luppi) with writer's block, and looks for inspiration amongst the clientele of the Caf Rossignol. Zeta would like to write on his own behalf, rather than ghost write for others.  But his boss wants him to continue in this role.  Other characters include Alicia, a waitress who doesnt want to fall in love; Pascual, the owner of the cafe who waits for the arrival of his old friends and lovers Irene and Kurt (all are despondent over the fact that a theater they performed in is beingtorn down).  Finally, another character Don Jose lives in fear of the letter that he doesnt dare open. All of this gets sorted out in the end--no spoiler alerts here.  I bought the film based solely on the fact that Fredrico Luppi was part of the cast.  He is, but in more or less a walk on role and he is not particularly compelling in this role.  Nonetheless, the film is engaging and I found myself caring about the characters.  Leigh Zimmerman is outstanding as Irene; all the more so because she (according to an interview) spoke Spanish only phonetically.",1402876800,,1203,4.532407407407407
