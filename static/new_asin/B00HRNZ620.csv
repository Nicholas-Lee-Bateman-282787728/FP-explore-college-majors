6200780,5,B00HRNZ620,"First of all the treatment by the seller was just awesome.
I really like the arrangement of everything even if I have
to be careful with the DVD. That just have good size
and my only thought is why shout factory was more on
check with it because the fence for the DVD does not
have the same size with a result of pressure on this.",1400371200,3,330,4.015151515151516

8634898,5,B00HRNZ620,"This is the best DVD set I've ever bought. First the booklet is very helpful, with lots of information, pictures, and tells you exactly what is on each DVD. The helmet itself is a great display piece and always cool to look at. The DVDs feature every episode from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers to Power Rangers Megaforce. If I had to give some negatives, the metal tins the DVDs are in are great, but rather cumbersome when trying to get them out. Also, the DVDs only have the season and disk numbers labeled on them, they don't have the names of the individual episodes, so you will need the booklet. The Power Ranger Time Force DVDs are the post-9/11 edits and NOT the original broadcast masters. This is perhaps the most disappointing part of the whole collection. Other than that, this is a great, set highly recommended. Although I would't pay more than $200 for it. Anyone asking for more than that, like $500 or $800 are just looking for a pay day and I would not buy from them.",1474502400,,984,4.472222222222222
