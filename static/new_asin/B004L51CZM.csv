4400424,1,B004L51CZM,"The film mistakes the problems of peak oil and increasing energy demand for and get's confused with alot of it's 'facts', leaving the cause of high oil prices firmly at the door of big oil.  The main problem is people need to wake up to a finite resource that is oil, if you want to watch a good documentary on peak oil I'd recommend A Crude Awakening, and give GasHole a miss.",1308614400,3,377,4.236111111111111
4400425,3,B004L51CZM,"This is a great film if you are a firm believer that Big Oil is conspiring to stop any vehicles other than gas guzzlers using petroleum derived fuels from ever getting on the road - by any means necessary, possibly not even ruling out assassination.

But the filmmakers have intolerable ignorance on issues like EROEI, the energy density of gasoline, basic economics, basic physics, how much land it would take (all arable land in the US, probably) to replace petro-diesel with biodiesel.  They don't seem to know that 95% of hydrogen is made by using other fossil fuels (usually natural gas), splitting off the Hydrogen, and blowing the CO2 up the smokestack.  Their suggested version of having a solar powered electrolysis unit with a compressor to store your H2 in tanks, doesn't mention what you're going to do with all the O2 floating around in your garage, nor do they mention that the catalytic material in the passive electron membrane fuel cell (AKA PEMFC, or just ""fuel cell"") is platinum, currently selling at ~$3000/oz.  Nor do they mention it takes 1.7 volts to crack water to 2H2 & O2, and the PEMFC output will be just 0.7 volt when they are recombined, so you will need LOTS of them (which is why prototype hydrogen cars cost upwards of $1 million).  Besides, it would be clearly a better use of your 1.7 volts to just charge a fully electric car rather than waste most of your electric energy cracking water and running the compressors for your tanks?  Not to mention your PEMFC will wear out its catalytic material at something like 40,000 miles, and there you are having to spend anther million every 3 or 4 years to stay on the road!

Granted, Big Oil has run every disinformation campaign known to man, bought technology explicitly to keep it out of cars (like battery technology that would have made the EV1 more viable), has conspired to buy up and liquidate public transportation systems, and on and on.  But most of this was prior to the US Peak in 1970, when they HAD to find ways to sell the incredible amount of oil they were producing, even with the TRRC regulating output quotas ('til 1972).

Still, what these filmmakers have done is almost as deceptive.  They have taken second or third hand stories about 200 mpg cars (Ogle's patent, issued Dec 11, 1979, No. 4,177,779 ""A Fuel Economy System for an Internal Combustion Engine"") is on the web for anyone to download and manufacture - so it's not the conspiracy-type story they make it out to be. And as it turns out, this guy was deep in debt according to his widow, drinking and doing drugs all the time, and the Seattle company that bought his patent said it didn't even work.  Yet just about every time Ogle's face is flashed in the film - as if he were the avenging angel of fuel efficiency - it is followed by a 1946 patent (2,407,478 by Crozier & Vanderpoel if you want to look it up) for an ""antiknock or detonation dampening device"" which has nothing to do with the much touted 200 mpg invention attributed to Ogle.  And the verification is just old guys saying they followed Ogle in his 1971 modified Ford Galaxy on just one occasion up to some town in New Mexico and back to El Paso on 2 gallons of gas.  No clinical scientific evidence.  Nobody who knew anything about cars bothered to take photos of the miracle device, and nobody knows where it is now.  Accept at the patent office (see below if you want to get a copy).

The filmmakers also state that some guy named Ken Condi (sp?) was paid millions by Shell Oil for a patent on a  ""carburetor"" similar to Ogle's design.  I could find no patents issued under any spelling of Condi, Kondy, or anything else, or any news story about ""Shell pays millions for advanced carburetor,"" one would think it would have made the news.  It's just untraceable folklore.

Then we have he story of Ernie Pierce, who apparently stopped development on high efficiency fuel equipment of an undescribed nature due to feeling ""threatened,"" thought he does not say it was ever covert or that there was even any personal contact by the ""watchers.""  Tried looking him up too, but he has also vanished into fuel efficiency myth without a trace.

My point here is that the guys who made this film are either just incredulous, or they just wanted to add any rumor or old story that seemed to hold up their conspiracy theory.  As such, they are just about as guilty of subterfuge to sell their point as are the oil companies they criticize.

And again, I'm not defending the oil companies, but I do think documentarians are obligated to do a lot more research than was done in this film.  Especially about their main target - they didn't even examine the all important issue of oil reserves: Their ""Big Oil"" companies now own perhaps 7% of global reserves, so they aren't setting the price on anything.  OPEC owns about 80% - and the filmmakers say they intentionally left OPEC out.  When you own 7% of something and someone else owns 80% - who do you think is setting the price?

Not to mention, if the US economy collapses because we're exporting >$700 billion a day to foreign oil suppliers and the huge debt overhang this is creating bankrupts us, wouldn't it be a good idea if the US DID have high efficiency vehicles so that we could be a lot more energy independent?  If the US economy craters, the US Big Oil companies will crater with it.

And despite what the film tells you about biodiesel - it's mostly crap, a lot of it political (esp in CA), but drive through  Iowa soy fields and you'll see signs every 10 miles about the wonders of biodiesel - it isn't being nationally outlawed as the filmmakers insinuate - it's being aggressively developed, just as is the even stupider (in EROEI terms) corn ethanol.  There was just a large hiatus (for biodiesel) when it became common knowledge that CO2 aside, biodiesel produces more NOx effluvients, so it's not all that great for the environment, not to mention all the petro-diesel infrastructure that plow, plant, spray, harvest, and transport the soy beans to the refinery (which probably runs on coal-produced electricity) to make the end product bio-diesel, with an EROEI of 1.5 to 3 (depending on how many externalities one wishes to exclude).  So when examined from tilling the soil to going to your tank, exhaust issues aside, it's not that great a deal.  Not to mention that as of 2010, US biodiesel (as transportation fuel) production was around 1 million bbl/day, and that amount would run our diesel fleet for 3.25 days.  Additionally, most of the soy-for-fuel is actually converted to other distillates, like heating oil, with which biodiesel must compete in price.  It's just not a miracle fix, no matter what Josh Tickell says (see the documentary FUEL to see what I mean).

By all means this is a film worth watching, but the filmmakers had ample real facts to illustrate the lies and disinformation of Big Oil without resorting to hearsay stories they fail to follow up, but pass off as miracle solutions.  And though I know the copyright was 2009 and the film didn't debut (DVD) until 2011 - just look at what has happened to the electric car and hybrid markets in the intervening 2 years.

Pretty good film, guys, and nicely shot (except the irrelevant Crozier patent showing up 10 times implying it had something to do with Ogle - why didn't you just use HIS patent - it's a lot prettier), but you really should have done a LOT more homework on the GLOBAL oil industry, not just the old ""Seven Sisters.""",1306022400,51,7499,4.618222891566265

4400448,1,B004L51CZM,"A few simple questions (for anyone who thinks this is a 'good' documentary)...

#1 To REGISTER A PATENT ONE MUST PROVIDE CLEAR STEPS ON HOW TO CREATE THE DEVICE.
 This documentary talks about various patents (including the 100 MPG engine patent). If this patent exists, ANYONE will be able to get its blueprint... IT CANNOT BE SECRET AND PATENTED AT THE SAME TIME!!!

#2 All these supposed patents were registered decades ago and available free of charge to anyone wishing to use them (given that the 17-year age limit on those patents expired a long time ago).
WHY HAS NO ONE USED THEM???

Does anyone seriously think that Toyota (for example) would spend nearly $5,000 extra on a hybrid drive when all it had to do was use a (laughably simple) 50-year old patent instead?

What about the Japanese, Korean, European manufacturers? Are they in on it too?

Would GM rather go bankrupt rather than have a 100 MPG Humvee?

Wouldn't the Chinese spend billions creating 100 MPG engines (rather than hundreds of billion on oil imports)?",1331942400,3,1030,4.785310734463277

If there were cheaper sources of energy, the market would dictate and it would be used.

4400452,1,B004L51CZM,"As my title states, I am the choir they are preaching to.  I support any way we can have alternative energies, the elimination of dependence on imports of oil, more fuel efficient cars, etc. etc. etc.  And yes, I believe that the oil companies haven't been forthcoming in their testimony and their millions in campaign contributions have swayed the debates.  Ok, I've stated my creds.  This is plainly a bad documentary and a bad DVD.  Some of the other reviewers feel that to make this criticism means that we are shilling for the oil companies.  Even our favorite actors make bad movies so it isn't a stretch that film makers conveying an important message can do so in a low quality and sophomoric way.  After an hour of watching I had to walk to a different part of the room to just listen.  Every interview and narration is peppered with snippets from old and irrelevant movies and cartoons.  A voice says the word sweat and we are switched to a black and white scene of a guy sweating.  Over and over and over again. That is one of the reasons that makes this unwatchable.

Other notes:  1. is this company serious with the 10 or so trailers before the actual movie starts?
2.  On the opening sequence of the magic carburetor:  perhaps there were devices invented 70 years ago that were bought and buried.  I cannot comment on that. But let's face it.  There are enough mechanics and engineers tinkering in their garages to have come up with these things if they were feasible.

4400453,5,B004L51CZM,"I just watched this movie on Netflix and, like several others, am now ordering it.  It covers a LOT of ground and has MANY facts that highlight much of what americans with any common sense at all already pretty much realize with regards to the issues and problems that the oil industry has brought to our table, but, in addition, gives more detailed information pertaining to just how deep all of it really goes (VERY deep), how long the oil industry's deceptive practices have been going on (since at least the 1930's or so) and how much Americans and our country are paying in the interests of the greed-directed corporations in the oil and automotive industries (it's HUGE).

There are several really negative reviews here, but they are obviously either not smart enough to understand the basic concepts of the economy, industry and corporate america, they are effectively brainwashed to believe completely illogical conclusions (which I've been seeing a lot of over the last 13 years), or they are deliberately trying keep you from buying this DVD, in the hopes that americans will never understand what is happening to them - most likely a combination of these 3. ...so BUY THIS DVD!

The basic premise here is that oil companies are corporations that, by definition, exist to maximize profits and not necessarily to do the right things to help american consumers. They are extremely large and powerful, they have very strong and influential lobby groups that make a significant difference to bills and decisions made in congress, and they make ever-increasing astronomical profits quarter to quarter, regardless of the state of the economy or the occurrence of natural disasters. I'd like to hear the naysayers dispute that!

Once that is understood, viewing this movie at even a high level, simply confirms this premise. I've always been of the opinion that if you are desparately looking for something bad or something wrong, you will find it, and that's what these negative reviewers are doing.  So the bottom line is that, as with any documentary, there could possiblly be some innaccuracies and maybe even some errors, but the stated facts align perfectly with the above stated premise, and the vast majority of the facts stated are verifiable, many by just the inclusion of the actual video clips themselves.

So the bottom line is that Americans need to wake the hell up and rise up together for our rights, like we did years ago, and force our government to step in and enact real changes to help and protect us!  Had our government been truly working for us over the years, we would have had 200+ MPG gas cars, MUCH more mass transit, and MANY more alternate fuel vehicles, our economy would be MUCH stronger, we would have NO reliance on foreign oil!

So buy this DVD and then contact your congressmen to enact change.",1312588800,5,2834,4.865145228215767
4400454,5,B004L51CZM,"Disclaimer:
I am not affiliated with anyone involved with this movie, nor will I make any money if you buy it or not.  I am only attempting to provide an honest review.

I watched this movie on Netflix, then I bought it because people who do good work deserved to get paid for their labor.  This movie helped me see this situation more clearly.  This movie, unlike many of its kind leaves you feeling hopeful and empowered to try something new.

The following is a short and partial list of some of the information I felt was worthy of buying this flick:

1. The movie provides good sound documentation (from the 1930's till now) of the automotive and oil industries successful attempts to hide inventions from the public that could have increased the Miles per Gallon above 100 MPG (when you learn the actual MPG that Shell achieved in the 1970's you will be astonished and angry cause it is well over 200MPG).

2. The movie provides an actual patent number (2,407,478; H.E. Crozier ET AL) for a device that can help your cars fuel economy with a low cost modification.  Also, there is another modification that the movie talks about, called the ""Oglemobile.""  It was designed by Tom Ogle to get 100 MPG with just about any car (an airline mechanic said he followed Toms ideas, not his design and only got 60 MPG, Heck I would be happy with 50MPG right now).  Both can be looked up on-line for verification.  I did, before I wrote this review.

3. The movie provides an in-depth look at the foreign and domestic oil industry and the motivations for price fixing and limiting potential increases in MPG.

4. The movie provides an in-depth timeline of how the industry got to where we are throwing away this important resource (Oil) and how we have been manipulated and conditioned to wait for congress to force the industry to change things (it is not going to happen, we have to change this).

5. The movie was entertaining and the actual MPG that former Shell employee David Richard Blackmore states is mind-blowing!!!  OMG!!!  Life altering!!!

By the way, David Richard Blackmore was not just any former Shell employee, he was the editor of the book shell printed in 1977 that documented their attempt to reach the most fuel efficient auto possible (1000MPG).  Yes that is not a typo 1000MPG.  In that book, it clearly states that Shell achieved 149.95 miles per gallon with a 1939 Studebaker.  One heavy car, think umm Hummer sized auto.

Although the book shell printed for publication is out of print and has since been systematically erased from the shelves of the library, including the Library of congress records, it is still available, incase you want to see it for yourself, like I did, see this link to find a copy closest to your area:

Look, we have an oil problem, we need newer fuels and better fuel economy.  But get over the conspiracy theory crap!  Absolutely absurd.  The first part of the movie tries to convince the viewer that the technology has existed for a 100MPG+ vehicle in the 1940.  Terrible, this move is sensationalism at it's finest.

Other parts of this movie about the economics of oil are much closer to reality and offer a good view.  It is, however, hard to stomach the movie to get to this more informative part.

There is no science to back up the claims of 100mpg ""water carburetors"" and ""vapor engines"" discussed early in the movie. It is pseudoscience at best and I would prefer to call it ""anti-science"". The movie then uses the fact that these engines aren't in production to create a conspiracy theory that the oil and gas industry is intentionally trying to keep fuel efficieny down. There really is a simpler reason that they aren't in production though. They don't work!  If they ever existed in the first place, they can't work due to the laws of physics.

I do not know if the movie had any high points later on because it was unwatchable to me.

Then it tried to cover up the evidence that it had done so. Memos from the industry also show how they conspired to reduce refining capacity. This is ignorant and intolerable, and only hurts the market and American.

The other negative and stupid reviews are probably paid for by the oil industry that has dumped $80 million into Republicans and $20 million into Democratic candidates just since Bush left office.
