8369704,4,B002G81R0Q,"I honestly do not know what to make of this DVD.  When ""Animal X"" was on Animal Planet a few years ago, I tried to save as many episodes as I could, but missed recording this episode, which I thought was one of their best.  A few weeks ago, I did a random search for ""Animal X"" and noticed that individual episodes on DVD were available for purchase.  What follows is a two part review: first part on the episode and second on the quality of the DVD itself.

THE EPISODE:
""Monster or Murderer.""  The focus of the episode is an attempt to take seriously accounts of animal attacks in 18th century France and come to some type of scientific resolution about what could have been going on.  The attacks in question were chalked up to the ""Beast of Gevaudan,"" which described as anything from a massive wolf to a werewolf to a hyena.  The two ""on the ground"" investigators, Natalie and Daniel, travel to the region of France in which the murders took place and begin researching the story.  Bill Kerr is at his silly best yet again, but even he cannot disrupt the beautiful scenery and, of course, the competent work of Natalie and Daniel.  I won't spoil the ending, but the conclusion that the two investigators come to regarding the Beast attacks is at once inventive and alarming.  Truly more horrible than the belief that the attacks were the work of a supernatural creature.

THE DVD:
In all honesty, when this DVD arrived from Amazon, I thought it was a bootleg and am still not convinced that it is not a bootleg.  The DVD itself is in a slim case and did not come shrink-wrapped.  The front of the color sleeve looks good, but the back is another indication that this is a bootleg: poorly reproduced episode summary that looks like a cheap color printer print-out.  The disc itself has a nice ""Animal X"" color print glued on one side, but the back of the disc is clearly a DVR: purple in color, just like the ones you get at Best Buy.  However, the reproduction on this DVD is excellent: excellent color, sound and picture quality.  The picture is widescreen and there are no chapters or closed captioning; another indication that this is a bootleg.

In conclusion, it's my opinion that this dvd was worth the money.  This show was excellent and is impossible to find now.  For fans or inquisitive scholars of werewolves or cryptids, I'd highly recommend this episode.  However, the DVD itself is probably a bootleg, so I cannot give it the full five stars.",1257984000,2,2461,4.537414965986395
