1843541,5,B00008G640,This was a good movie.  Not the best I rvrt saw but a pretty good one.  The plot is a little twisted and sick at times but overall a good movie.  Very hot ladies that are funny and decetful makes it all the more life like.  I would recommend this movie to anyone I know.,1291248000,7,270,3.8545454545454545
1843542,3,B00008G640,"This is not a great movie, but it isn't a bad movie either. There is some entertainment value to it. This movie serves as a good introduction to viewers for future comedies that would follow in its formula like American Pie. There are a few moments the movie does get a little slow, but it does pick back up the pace to make for a great entertainment value.",1289779200,3,357,4.264705882352941

1843545,5,B00008G640,"Did I mention that IT'S A DVD? It's round, thin, has a hole in the middle and is very shiny on one side. It plays in a dvd player. A certain on-line retailer thinks that is a vhs tape. Does it sound like a vhs tape to you? OK, format rant aside, what's the movie like? Very funny. Hilarious. Teen angst focused on people who deserve it. Silly, over the top stereotypes. Suggested sex with a little peek at b&d. A total and complete jerk scratching his crabs. A teenage guy who finds bliss in sex. A spoiled rich brat waving around a dildo in public. Two overweight people in a grocery store, wearing spandex clothes ten sizes too small. If Mel Brooks and John Waters had collaborated on a movie while high on laughing gas, this could be it. A great comedy. If you can't find it to rent, just go ahead and buy it. If you can rent it, no one could stop you from buying it. By the way, it's no more ""used"" than it is a ""vhs tape"". The seller J2M2BROW is the director's company, which only sells brand new dvds. Again, that's DVDs.",1155945600,,1027,4.191919191919192
1843546,5,B00008G640,"I first heard of this movie when Joe Bob Briggs ""The Drive In Movie Critic"" gave it a ""Drive-In Academy Award Nomination"" and Howard Stern congratulated the maniacs who made this movie. I was not disappointed when I finally saw the film.

Raging Hormones"" is wild, sexy, and totally outrageous.  It takes the teen, ""coming-of-age"" comedy to a whole new level. Hot women, sexy guys, and hilarious situations tantalize you as it makes you howl with laughter.

No wonder Raging Hormones won the New York Independent Film Festival awards for ""Best Comedy"", ""Best Director"", ""Best Soundtrack"", and ""Audience Appreciation"".",1095811200,4,617,5.212121212121212

Some men never learn and some learn immediately.  Both deserve what they got in this movie.  And the women in the movie didn't seem to learn much but eventually got what they wanted, too.  The movie is entertaining if you can get past the acting.  The dalog is not bad; but the delivery stinks.  It does have some BD in it and some might consider the some of the sex kinky.

1845130,1,B00008G640,"This film primarily features two obese women in curlers and scarves, spandex, and enough cosmetics to make Tammy Faye jealous - saying many times that they used to live in a trailer park.  Most characters talk as if they never made it into high school, the difference between a decent job and a great job in this film is being a mechanic at a lawn mower repair shop in a garage of a house, or being the boss of that lawn mower repair shop in a garage of a house. The only hot chic nude scene is the first six minutes of the film (clearly a huge tease to keep you watching through the rest of the film, hoping to see something of that caliber - which never happens), and any other woman sharing her body with the camera is average looking but thank the Almighty skinnier by at least 2/3 of the featured main character sows.  The son of the focus family is lucky enough to end up next door with a spoiled rich young newlywed woman as her boy toy, the husband in the newlywed couple quits getting anything out of the relationship so he visits a seedy neighborhood and gets a STD which he gives to the only girl who will have him, who happens to be underage.  Any half-decent looking woman (after the first six minutes) who goes sans togs still has blankets, negligee, or dominatrix outfit covering what you want to see, and most of it should be rated PG.  This is a 1999 film, $600K budget, filmed in Florida and runs 93 minutes (all you'll care about are the first six).  I take my hat off to anybody who can enjoy watching a film that predominantly focuses a story around two morbidly obese women in curlers, scarves, and spandex who talk about being from a trailer park, as if the rest of the film giving us less than 3% of the remaining time to see better looking women is enough to make this DVD worth viewing.  The box cover art is a deception, and if you can't buy this used for under $5, don't.  I haven't spoiled the entire movie for you, Michael Dugan (producer / director) does that by himself.
