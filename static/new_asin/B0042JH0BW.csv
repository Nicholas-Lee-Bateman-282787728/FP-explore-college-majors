4251070,4,B0042JH0BW,"Yul Brynner seems to have played more different nationalities than anyone I can think of. In this one he's an Arab revolutionary, in a story that isn't nearly as dated as you would expect it to be. I wanted to give it 5 stars, but I know that's only because I'm such a Brynner fan. If you like him or Sal Mineo, you'll enjoy the movie. If you are looking for great art, I'm afraid this isn't it.",1359504000,,395,4.076923076923077
4251071,3,B0042JH0BW,"The sense of running, tension of escape, drama of conflicted characters is almost totally missing from this little desert story, though the filmmakers would certainly be disappointed to hear it from me. I had long wanted to see it and ordered the DVD which is technically of good quality. A surprisingly minor film in tone and execution, considering Yul Brynners epic stature at the time it was made, the film does deliver a very long and entertaining chase as Brynner and a surprisingly appealing Madelyn Rhue with Sal Mineo in tow break out and run for it, and run for it, and run for it. There is no big climax and Yul does not get to do his usual fine stuff; instead he is sort of hidden beneath a murky desert leader personage who is, untypically for Yul, a quiet type with little to say or do.

Yet, I did like seeing it and owning it. Its Yul, and some pretty good action.",1355011200,,879,4.392638036809816
4251072,5,B0042JH0BW,"Question: What can a 1962 movie about a motley group of ragtag misfits, cooped up for much of its 93-minute run time in a stolen, decrepit Dodge military ambulance, possibly have to offer? Answer: Plenty! ""Escape from Zahrain"" tosses a fugitive Arab freedom fighter (Yul Brynner), an idealistic but volatile student (Sal Mineo), a world-weary American embezzler (Jack Weston), a sadistic maniac (Anthony Caruso) and a gorgeous nurse (Madlyn Rhue) into the aforementioned vehicle and pits them against the trackless Zahrainian desert--and each other. It's a made-up country, of course, but you could easily substitute the name of one of several real Middle Eastern nations and you'd get the point.

With no food, very little water and barely enough gas to reach safety across the border with a neighboring friendly nation, the hapless adventurers, thrown together by a cruel twist of fate, start their arduous journey mistrusting and even hating each other. They must contend with more than the desert, as the forces of the evil Zahrainian ruler pursue them by air and ground over some of the roughest, most desolate yet photogenic terrain ever seen on film. The credits don't say where ""Escape from Zahrain"" was filmed, but the parched, rugged, rocky desert and mountain landscapes are simply stunning. As best I can tell, the Dodge actually does what it appears to be doing--ascending and descending steep slopes, almost tipping over sideways, creeping along the crests of mountain ridges, threading its way around massive boulders, crossing baked salt flats, and so on. None of its maneuvers are special effects. There's one scene where the film rate seems speeded up a little, but that's it. The rest is real, and it's amazing. Four-wheel-drive enthusiasts should love this film.

I won't give away details of the plot, but I will say its a non-stop, timeless story of a small group of ""normal"" people facing incredible natural and human adversities. Not everyone survives the journey, of course (otherwise, it wouldn't be much of a movie), and we care enough about the characters that the inevitable deaths are almost personal. Its fascinating to watch the changing dynamics of the relationships among the fugitives as they get to know each other during the long days of their escape. The story and script are exceptionally well-done. We care very much about the characters as we watch them fight for survival.

Before I got this DVD, I had seen ""Escape from Zahrain"" only once, at a theatre on its first release when I was (barely) a teenager. It stuck in my memory ever since--not in detail, but as a film that I remembered really enjoying. I'm pleased to say it is every bit as good as I recall. In my opinion, it compares favorably with any other films of the genre ever made, including ""Lawrence of Arabia."" I very highly recommend it.",1329696000,5,2844,4.970588235294118
4251073,4,B0042JH0BW,"One of the earliest movies I remember seeing as a child, possibly as a second feature to  another film I've long since forgotten.  As such, I have a special
fondness for it, but that aside, it's a likable chase-adventure, one where you get
the feeling you're actually traveling with these people. The acting, in most cases is fine, though Sal Mineo seems a little too earnest and Jack Warden could have
dialed it back a little in one or two scenes. Yul is excellent, holding his
powerful screen presence in check.  Actual action/violence is limited to the
beginning and end of the film (involving an exciting duel with a couple of armored half-tracks); the balance of the film deals with the dangers of a trek through the
desert and the inevitable personality clashes. Refreshingly, the movie is free of the ""whining coward/hysteric"" character which bogs down many character driven films.
Most of the film was filmed on location (as mentioned in another review), though a couple of scenes are obviously set on stages but they're not overly distracting. If you like straight-forward desert adventures, you would probably like this.",1295481600,3,1130,4.968253968253968
4251074,5,B0042JH0BW,"Olive Films continues to unearth important Paramount Pictures titles glossed over when first released but pack a punch in these modern times.  'ESCAPE FROM ZAHRAIN' is an absolute gem of a film and I can't believe as a movie buff all these years it has alluded me up till now.  Yul Brynner fresh from 'THE KING & I' plays political leader Sharif who is sprung from a police van on his way to a firing squad by young loyalists led by Sal Mineo.  Yul and the other prisoners kidnap an ambulance and head into the Arabian desert with the police in hot pursuit.  All the performances are magnificent: Sal Mineo showing his acting talents, Jack Warden in a wiseguy performance as an employee of Zahrain oil who was involved in embezzlement, Anthony Caruso as a slimy psychotic and the underrated Madlyn Rhue as a nurse who becomes emotionally involved in the proceedings.  There's also a surprise cameo by the excellent James Mason.  Produced and Directed by Ronald Neame who would give us another great adventure yarn a decade later, 'THE POSEIDEN ADVENTURE' keeps the nail biting action flowing relentlessly with beautiful cinematography by Ellsworth Fredericks and a rousing music score by Lyn Murray.  Kudos to Olive Films once again for finding this great action jewel.  Highly recommended.",1292025600,17,1290,4.912442396313364
4251075,4,B0042JH0BW,"I just was looking at a list of Jack Warden movies and I see a great 'sleeper' movie being released on disc that I haven't seen since about 1978 ANYWHERE!!!  I don't remember everything about it, BUT I do remember loving the acting ,story and the cast.  Yul Brynner is always a joy to watch, Sal Mineo, tragically having his life end too soon, was also a fine actor and maybe my favorite character actor ever in Jack Warden.  From his appearance in the classic Twilight Zone episode, ""The Lonely"", to his perfromances in ""Brian's Song"" as George Halas, the wonderful drama ""Tweleve Angry Men"", the likeable trainer in ""Heaven Can Wait"" and the underrated comedy from 1980, "" So Fine"", he was just a classic actor in every way.

4251084,5,B0042JH0BW,"It's amazing that there was a time when you could make a film which was one third about a truck going up a hill.  That you could, in near real time, see characters interact over a meal, have 5 minutes of constant dialog, without a CGI monster coming over the hill.  That a film could have a crew of men and women who are nearly all adults and yet still active and vital.  Yet, here is an example of that film, a great adventure tale with just a little bit of political intrigue, lots of roughhousing, great, great locations, and brilliantly written, and played, characters.

(I had this strange sense that young George Lucas may have seen this flick...especially the opening parts of Star Wars.  Layla.  Princess Leia.

The dictators then are the same now, and the suffering of the common people continues. The desire for freedom exists in man's soul. Wouldn't you hate your oppressor too?  The script is so kooky, the characters so formulaic, the scenery beautiful,  their trek is amazing, and the ending is weak.

4251114,5,B0042JH0BW,"Released in 1962, ""Escape from Zahrain"" is a survival-in-the-desert flick that takes place in the fictitious Arabian country of Zahrain. Yul Brynner plays Sheriff, a righteous Arab revolutionary, while Sal Mineo plays his young disciple who sets him free from captivity and certain death. An Arab nurse (Madlyn Rhue), an embezzling oil worker (Jack Warden) and a mad Arab (Anthony Caruso) are also along for the ride. Can they make it to a bordering nation and freedom or will they all perish in the desert?

Although it's Grade B (and cartoony) in comparison to the way more popular and sophisticated desert film ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (also from '62), ""Escape to Zahrain"" is actually more compelling, which is different than saying it's better, it's not. It's just more immediately satisfying. Two other survival-in-the-desert films that ""Zahrain"" brings to mind are ""Flight of the Phoenix"" and ""Sands of the Kalahari"", both released in 1965. If you like those two films, you'll definitely like this one. As great as they are ""Zahrain"" is as good or better.

There's some serious action at the beginning and end of the film, but the heart of the picture is the long trek through the desert and the interplay of the characters. Sheriff (Brynner) and Ahmed (Mineo) have had it with the corrupt officials of Zahrain who rape the land with the technology of the Americans but then greedily keep the cash for their own filthy rich lifestyles; meanwhile the citizenry wallows in poverty and ignorance. The nurse (Madlyn) was educated in Europe and doesn't understand the reckless passion of the revolutionaries. She's against them because she's nursed the wounded & dying followers of Sheriff, mostly youths. The American, Huston (Warden), is viewed as part of the problem by the revolutionaries, but they need him to escape and survive. And then you have the freakin' crazy Arab, Tahar (Caruso), also called ""Frankenstein"" or ""Franky"" by Huston. Is he friend or foe, or neither? Also on hand is a pleasant cameo by a major star from that time period, but I don't want to give it away.

The film was shot in the Mojave Desert, California, but you'd hardly know as the filmmakers did a great job of giving the illusion that it's somewhere in the Middle East. My wife, for instance, guessed that it was shot in Egypt.

At 93 minutes the film doesn't overstay its welcome.

FINAL WORD: Despite being a serious Grade B picture, ""Escape from Zahrain"" is Grade A in heart. The film is bookended by quality action sequences, but its core is character-driven. You get to know these characters as they trek through the sweltering desert. Their strengths and weaknesses are revealed and you can't help but start to care for them, just as they develop a sense of community amongst themselves.

Criminally underrated and unknown, ""Escape to Zahrain"" ranks with the best desert films, Grade B though it is. It's also one of Yul's best and the other principles. No kidding.

GRADE: A-",1366416000,4,2964,4.904191616766467
