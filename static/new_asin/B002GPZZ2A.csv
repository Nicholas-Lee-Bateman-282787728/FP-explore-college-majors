This is one of many tools I am studying to improve my playing.  When I complete this instruction, I will purchase other Frank Vignola studies.",1423526400,,279,4.770833333333333
8369910,5,B002GPZZ2A,"This was my first exposure to Truefire videos, I now have over 30. Without a doubt this has remained my favorite. It came along when I was struggling to get out of a rut in my electric playing. It has so many ideas and to me, seemed to really get more rhythm into my lead playing. Focusing me on listening to rhythm patterns and bringing them in for variation on leads. Frank is a fun, relaxed instructor and as I have found out a virutoso gypsy guitar player. I just don't think you can go wrong with this course.",1283212800,7,514,4.202020202020202
