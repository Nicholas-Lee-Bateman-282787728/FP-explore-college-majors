8226459,2,B000X1CM7K,"I'm the world's biggest John Huston fan, world's biggest John Hurt fan, but there's a reason this film didn't succeed and you've never heard of it. It's just a very very shaggy story of a Scottish highwayman/rogue/scoundrel, played beautifully by John Hurt but amounting to very little in way of engagement or impact. Beautifully shot, funny, colorful, but the screenplay never really amounts to anything beyond a series of action pieces that are competently filmed. The frame is filled with amusements but the the story is largely empty of anything beyond skits, winks and nods. Breaks my heart to say it! I would still recommend seeing it because it's Huston and Hurt, but it doesn't match the towering achievements of either great film artist.",1424390400,2,746,5.024193548387097
