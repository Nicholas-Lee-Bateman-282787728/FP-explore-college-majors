8495496,5,B0069TLDO8,"What a great dvd this is on Winair, great scenery and great flying over some of the asume parts of the world like all the islands like St. Barths, St. Maarten and the other islands that are featured in this dvd.  The flight crew was great on how they explained all about the Twin Otter and how it flys--I might also add that the Twin Otter is one of my favorite aircrafts and have traveled many miles on them back in California when they were used by Golden West Airlines and Inter Island Air in Hawaii.  Another Great dvd from World Air Routes and Just Plane Videos.
