Don't miss out on this one.  Welcome addition to any collection.

I'm 59 and have boils older than these guys.  They are NOT ""old school"" or anything like that.  Good music should always come to the top.....now you know thats not true.  Some very very impressive playing but not 24/7 ""wowing"" you....good compositions , as I said.",1301702400,,554,4.639175257731959
