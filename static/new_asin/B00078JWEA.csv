When my grandchildren get older I'm going to suggest that they watch these films which teach the importance of love and honor and chastity.

This is the type of movie everyone shoudl watch when they are growing up.

It's not that complicated.",1146787200,4,413,4.708333333333333

Watching the kids in these films, it's possible that some of them really did think they were magically created.

These ""educational"" shorts were made by the governement in the 1950s in order to scare teenagers away from having sex. They feature teenage characters who seem to have never heard of sex itself - they worry about whether kissing is ""going to far!""

I can only imagine that even back in the 1950s the kids watching this laughed as much as I did after I popped it into my DVD player.

It just goes to show that parents have been in dennial about their children's sex lives forever.",1146096000,,683,4.483870967741935
