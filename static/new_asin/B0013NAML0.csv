3118445,5,B0013NAML0,"Here was America's answer to the great literary and historical dramas and miniseries from Great Britain in 1976. It aired regularly only twice (multiple airings on different PBS outlets) in 1976 for America's Bicentennial and in 1986 for the centennial of the Statue of Liberty. After that, it was relegated to the vaults with only VHS and Beta copies made from the original broadcasts in the hands of a few collectors. It is a brilliant series, brilliantly acted and directed. The late George Grizzard seemed to be a lock for the Emmy for Best Actor in a Dramatic Series of Miniseries (it was won, and just as deservedly so, by the late Gordon Jackson - Hudson on the BBC's ""Upstairs, Downstairs"") for his outstanding portrayal of John Adams. William Daniels (who played John Adams on Broadway and in the film version of ""1776"") reprises his role of eldest son John Quincy Adams after 24 years. (He first played John Quincy in his 1952 television debut, the Hallmark Hall of Fame's presentation of ""A Woman of the Ages,"" a drama about First Lady Abigail Adams.)

In a production painstakingly assembled by Virgina Kassel and coordinating producer Robert Costello (""The Patty Duke Show,"" ""Dark Shadows,"" ""All My Children""), some of the great writers and directors of television's Golden Age came together with many of the finest of the Broadway stage to deliver 150 years of history. The series was taken from, not merely based on, the superlative volume of the same name, and much of the dialog comes from letters, journal writings and diaries from Adams family.

It's a decent transfer from the original tapes to the DVDs, but it was diappointing that the original ""collage"" openings (showing images from each of the 13 episodes as narrator Michael Tolan said, ""Four generations...one family...for one hundred-fifty years their lives are interwoven with American history."") from 1976 with the complete opening music weren't restored and the abbreviated openings from the 1986 rebroadcasts were used. Still, it is extremely satisfying to finally have this remarkable series about one of America's greatest and most historically influential families restored to us in a form where we won't have to wait another 22 years. It's a shame that it wasn't re-introduced while Mr. Grizzard was still alive to see a couple of new generations enjoy and learn from one of his greatest achievements. HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! (Pardon my shouting!)",1211155200,27,2438,5.077306733167083
3118446,5,B0013NAML0,"This reviews the history of a superlative family in American history, a family that we owe so much to. We tend to forget these days what patriotism truly is all about. This will help remind the viewer.",1210896000,9,201,4.45945945945946
3118447,5,B0013NAML0,"Good to have this important mini-series available, which was produced for the bicentenniel of 1976.  Great cast breathes life into four genrations of an early American political dynasty.",1210550400,9,186,5.642857142857143
3118448,5,B0013NAML0,"Back in 1976, in the midst of nonsense like ""Three's Company"", long before the excellent ""John Adams"" from HBO, PBS gave us this gift! Long unavailable in any format, now well restored on DVD, this series should be required viewing for all U.S. History classes, if they are to understand the true meaning of Patriotism.",1210291200,14,319,4.818181818181818
3118449,4,B0013NAML0,"One of our oldest PBS series dramas that focused on our Founding Fathers and their activities to create the United States of America from the roots of Revolution to the establishment of Political order has finally been brought back for us to enjoy once again. The series was based on a book by Jack Shepherd entitled: ""The Adams Chronicles, Four Generations of Greatness"" with an introduction by the famous author Daniel J. Boorstin (Long before he became popular for his ""Discoverers"", etc.) Published by Little, Brown in Boston, Mass. in 1975 (very appropriate !) and covered 150 years of the Adams family involvement in the emerging nation and the politics of the era in which they lived.
The series mirrored the book almost chapter by chapter. Intended to re-familiarize our nation with the leaders from Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, etc. for the celebration of the Bicentennial of America in 1976.,this is past history to be proud of in every respect. The most surprising element is how well the actors played their roles and the interesting insights we get to see, including the popularity of Dr. Franklin in France and his ""adventures"" in becoming a living pop icon of the era.
The transfer is very plain, but this was not a big production anyway and was rather skimpy with sets, relying on actors to fill out the picture for us. This they do very well. Any History major, specializing in the Revolutionary era in America will not be able to resist the charm of seeing pages of the past made into the land of the living.
A great legacy of cultural film. Reviewing it now you may find that you need to refresh your usage of certain words. The Adams were an educated lot and the words used in this work have been out of favor for some time, so have a Dictionary near to remind yourself when you hear them.
Well recommended, somewhat scholarly but also entertaining. Providing a unique look into a proud American past. You can't leave these 13 episodes without learning something and most likely a favorable impression.",1208649600,56,2040,4.798295454545454
3118450,3,B0013NAML0,"Apparently this series was just copied from tape onto disc without any sort of touch-up or restoration. So after thirty two years since this series aired this is what we end up with. Well, it is better than nothing but far from everything digital dvd has to offer.

3118451,5,B0013NAML0,"I am so glad this marvelous series is finally being released.  I watched the series in its entirety when it aired in 1976, as a young adult, and still remember it well.  For anyone with an interest in American history, this series is a must see.  The acting is excellent, and it is very accurate, which for me is crucial.",1207785600,32,321,4.316666666666666
3118452,5,B0013NAML0,"At long last, the ""Adams Chronicles"" miniseries is coming to DVD.  Anyone with any interest in American history will enjoy this great work.  The recently-deceased George Grizzard does a stellar job as John, William Daniels (accustomed to playing John Adams in ""1776"") is remarkable as John Quincy, and the rest of the cast is not too shabby either!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1206057600,57,369,5.116666666666666
3118453,5,B0013NAML0,"Produced by PBS as part of the American Bicentennial celebration in 1976, this superb 13 hour television film chronicles the lives of four generations of the illustrious Adams family. It depicts approximately 150 years - from 1750 to 1900 - in the saga of this family whose history is nearly synonymous with that of the difficult birth and adolescence of the American republic. Central to this sprawling tale are the lives of four Adams men: the patriarch John Adams, the second president of the United States, his son John Quincy Adams, the sixth president, his son Charles Francis Adams, an Ambassador to Great Britain during the era of the Civil War, and his son, the historian Henry Adams. Because the family inevitably participated in the central events of their time, especially during the era of the Revolution and shortly thereafter, the series becomes a splendid, often probing depiction of America's early years. Featuring superb acting, wonderful period sets and costumes and, most importantly, truly stellar writing, this may arguably be the finest miniseries, along with the still  unreleased Oppenheimer starring Sam Waterston, that American television has ever produced.

George Grizzard portrays John Adams from youth to old age. He is splendid, as is William Daniels who portrays John Quincy from ages 50 to 81. Daniels is no stranger to portraying Adams's having played John Adams in the film of the musical 1776. David Birney portrays John Quincy Adams from ages 36 to 48. John Beal plays Charles Francis Adams and Peter Brandon plays Henry Adams. John Houseman reprises his Paper Chase crotchety attorney role as the irrascible Justice Gridley, John Adam's early legal mentor. The series depicts all of the founding fathers, doing so with humanity and very few marble bust performances. The women of the Adams family are portrayed with sensitivity and subtlety, averting the temptation of allowing them to become mere cyphers. Kathryn Walker and Leora Dana play Abigail Adams from her youth to her death, both actresses portraying John Adams' beloved wife with warmth, gentle humor, keen intelligence and stunning emotional depth. Her character's portrayal is crucial to the success of this series and they acquit it with grace and style. All of the many performances are exemplary in their own unique ways. It is gratifying that this series is finally available on DVD. If you enjoy historical drama and/or American history, then you will certainly enjoy this superb series. Most strongly recommended.

The actors do a really great job of portraying the various members of John Adams family as well as other historical figures - Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Ben Franklin, etc.  It is broken up into very manageable units for those parents who want to incorporate some history into their children's television viewing.

Each episode covers a different period in the lives of the various members of the Adams family who served in public office.

3118510,5,B0013NAML0,"I grew up in Quincy, Ma and have been interested in the Adams family since I first toured the birthplaces as a child. I have also been in the Adams Mansion (Peacefield) and other Adams tour sites. A trip to Quincy, Ma is a must for any student of history.
The musical '1776' is excellent as well and mostly historically accurate. I did not care for the HBO production of the David McCullough biography but loved the book itself. Most people don't know that John Hancock was also born in Quincy. His birthplace is now the Quincy Historical Society, located between Peacefield and the Church of the Presidents, where both presidents and their wives Abigail and Louisa Catherine are entombed. Originally they were buried across the street from the church and you will find many famous names there, too.
John Hancock married Dorothy Quincy and you can take tours of her mansion, which has underground tunnels where the family hid from Indians and Redcoats. Go between May and October because not all places are open year around.

This series serves as an illustration of just how far we can go to realize our dreams when we live in a society where religious and individual liberty and free enterprise are not shackled by the socialism and oppressive government of today.

3118513,5,B0013NAML0,"After having read David McCullough's biography and having seen Paul Giamatti's treatment of the role, I was afraid this series would not compare favorably, but I really enjoyed it. It includes lots of small detail that was not included in McCullough's biography or the series based on it. The acting is lovely. I was impressed that the series really doesn't have that odd 70s feel that even period pieces  made during that time usually have.

3118548,5,B0013NAML0,"Back during the Bicentennial period when I was a college history student I remember being riveted to a 13 part PBS series called The Adams Chronicles, the story of four generations of the Massachusetts family which rose from hardscrabble farming to the heights of law, politics, industry, and scholarship.  Now that I've seen it again after thirty five years I notice that it's much heavier on dialogue and lighter on action than I remembered, but nevertheless I still found it interesting and often spellbinding.

The series begins with the young John Adams paying court to an outspoken and independent minded girl named Abigail Smith.  It traces his legal career and his growing involvement with other colonists seeking more self-government and eventually independence from Great Britain.  We see Adams representing the new United States in France and Britain, ably assisted by his son John Quincy Adams, and then watch as he becomes Vice President and then President.  The focus then shifts to John Quincy Adams, who serves the US as diplomat, Secretary of State, President, and finally as a Congressman from his Massachusetts district.  Next we see John Quincy's son Charles Francis Adams representing the US in Britain during the Civil War, then the final episodes focus on Charles Francis's sons Henry, who led a scholarly life as historian and writer, and Charles Francis II, who became an industrialist and controlled the Union Pacific Railroad for awhile.

The series is, as I said above, heavy on dialogue, but that's because most of it is taken directly from Adams family letters and other documents.  There are many lighter moments which amuse but do not detract from the overall high tone of the series.  Another positive feature which I didn't remember well from my first viewing is the attention paid to the Adams women, beginning with Abigail and continuing through her daughter in law Louisa Johnson Adams and thence to the wives of Charles Francis Adams and his sons, which makes it clear that they were all intelligent and outspoken. Although much of the attention of the series necessarily focuses on the family's public roles, notice is also taken of the Adams' numerous domestic difficulties.  They were not wealthy compared to many of their contemporaries, and emotional problems took a toll as well, particularly among the sons of John Quincy Adams and in Henry Adams' wife Marian ""Clover"" Hooper.

The history of these four generations of the Adams family is the history of the first century of the United States itself writ small, and this mini-series is an able chronicle of both.",1364342400,,2607,5.053613053613054
3118549,5,B0013NAML0,"I totally enjoyed this mini-series.  All the actors were outstanding in their roles.  I learned more about the Admams Family than I ever knew before.  The one thing that I would have liked to have seen was a chapter about the exchange of letters between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson after both left the Presidency.  Aside from that, you learn how the Adams's were way ahead of their time in the causes that they cared about.  I watched the mini-series ""John Adams"" and heard many of the lines that were used in the Adams Chronicles.  I guess that it is safe to assume that the people who put together ""John Adams"" also watched the Adams Chronicles. The Adams Chronicles is truly worth watching.",1363651200,,697,4.626016260162602
3118550,3,B0013NAML0,"I found the earliest part with John & son John Quincy the best.  I thought the John Adams mini series dvd (from HBO) was outstanding, & this series paled in comparison.  It still was entertaining, had not seen it in 1976.",1362268800,,221,4.365853658536586

3118553,4,B0013NAML0,"We loved the HBO ""John Adams"" series, in spite of some howling historical inaccuracies. Then, we made our way through the 13 episodes of this old series, not expecting very much, really. We were happily surprised, then, by its quality, its attention to detail, and its thoroughness. While not as glitzy and visually appealing as the HBO series, with little of the action and (often computer generated) splashy scenery, all in all, ""The Adams Chronicles"" does a better job of teaching American history to its watchers, less way-layed as it is by the demands of ""action"", melodrama, and commerciality. Most importantly, perhaps, by extending the narrative through four generations of the Adams family, this series does some important work in relaying the story of numerous often overlooked episodes in American history, especially the administration of President John Quincy Adams, US-British relations during the Civil War, and the development of the national railroad system. Some episodes are better than others, and the lives and careers of the two Presidents Adams might just be more inherently interesting than those of their later descendants. The episode on Charles Francis Adams was especially dull-- various people make long eloqutions while standing at various desks or seated at various tables, with little else happening-- and the quality of the acting, always uneven, declined precipitously through the last three episodes. The writing is occasionally stilted and rhetorical. But all in all, production values are very high (especially amazing when you consider that the series is now almost 40 years old), and ""The Adams Chronicles"" would be a wise and interesting investment of time and attention for anyone wishing a good survey of America's story from the Revolution trough the Gilded Age.",1341792000,5,1805,5.336842105263158

1.) Despite being set during various war eras, we never see so much as a squad of soldiers.
2.) Characters are distorted to suit the narrative.
3.) Lack of storytelling continuity.

Chapter One ends with John Adams prepared to defend eight British soldiers involved in the Boston Massacre. Part Two opens with the verdict being read. An excellent opportunity for courtroom suspense was ignored.

There's many scenes of the first Continental Congress arguing over various issues large and small (lots of caricatures here), but nothing of that all-important vote prior to the endorsement of the Declaration of Independence.

Alexander Hamilton is throughout the early chapters one-dimensional, a scoundrel of sorts with ambitions for the presidency. When John Adams retires after his single term ends, the Hamilton matter is left unresolved, as if he never existed.

In the first JQ Adams episode, during Treaty of Ghent negotiations to end the War of 1812, Henry Clay is presented as either a drunk out partying until dawn or an inflexible hothead bellowing demands at his British counterparts. Way too simplistic, as Clay was a consummate compromiser known in later years as the ""Great Pacificator.""

In Paris, Ben Franklin is shown as stubborn, easy to anger and a ""dirty old man"" out carousing at night. True or otherwise, we could've done without this tattling. Tom Jefferson fares better. He and the senior Adams have a falling out over support for the French Revolution, but Jefferson is never trashed for no longer being an ally.

Clearly, the budget available for this ambitious 13-part series went into costumes, props, sets and location shoots. The only action seen is wagging jawbones, and there's a lot of that. The formula for each Adams profiled seems to be two parts career to one part home life, a workable equation.

To read the above, you'd conclude I hated this program. Actually, within its limitations I looked forward to each episode, and can still recommend it as an opinion on historical events, if not a literal representation of them.",1341360000,2,2169,5.075842696629214

3118570,5,B0013NAML0,"I loved ""The Adams Chronicles"" when it first aired on PBS in 1976, and I'm delighted to see how well it holds up after nearly 35 years. People who saw HBO's ""John Adams"" and expect ""The Adams Chronicles"" to be a carbon copy will be disappointed in the earlier miniseries' staginess, borne of its low budget. But it's the history in ""The Adams Chronicles,"" and the vigor and passion with which it is presented, that make it exceptional. The scripts and dialogue make the historical issues crystal-clear, and also make it plain why they mattered. The dry lessons from our high-school history classes--the XYZ Affair, the election of 1824, the Slidell-Mason scandal--come urgently to life in this miniseries, making it a must-see for any history buff.

I appreciated the scope of ""The Adams Chronicles,"" which takes the story of the Adamses beyond the usual presentations of John and John Quincy to their children and grandchildren--diplomat Charles Francis, railroad magnate Charles Francis II, and historian-novelist Henry. Some viewers may feel a letdown in the series' last few episodes, which have inherently less drama than the stories of John and John Quincy. But those episodes also have their fascination, showing show how the Puritan rectitude and noblesse oblige of the Adamses became steadily less influential as America became a nation of immigrants. ""Do you know Sean O'Hara, Mr. Adams?"" one character asks Charles Francis II in the last episode. ""I know Sean O'Hara, and his vote counts just as much as yours.""

While I am second to none in my admiration of the performances of Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney in ""John Adams,"" the performances of George Grizzard and Kathryn Walker as John and Abigail are in their own way just as fine (Walker took home an Emmy, and Grizzard should have). I also loved the performance of William Daniels as John Quincy, particularly in John Quincy's last years as he became a fiery antislavery advocate in Congress and before the Supreme Court. It's also fun to see the familiar faces (John Houseman, Nancy Marchand, James Broderick) in small roles. Occasionally a supporting performance is less than effective (Tom Hulce as a law student comes to mind), but that is negligible. While you should turn to ""John Adams"" for greater dramatic sweep and better production values, ""The Adams Chronicles"" stands tall as a loving, often thrilling recreation of American history.",1268524800,4,2414,5.062814070351759

3118572,4,B0013NAML0,"I first saw ""The Adams Chronicles"" when it was originally aired on PBS. When it was released on DVD I purchased it. I thought I might use it in my Social Studies classes. The information - for people who LOVE history - is great. For today's high school audiences it is a bit dated and slow moving, but I thoroughly enjoyed it - again. The reader, as always must remember who is writing and if they are trying to send a message. Much of Adams' writing tends to put a positive spin on them and their thinking, but understanding that, the brilliant minds of both John and John Quincy easily shine through. This documentary, although not as insightful as Ellis's book on the John Adams, in it's own way helped to revive the reputation of a man lost in the shadow of Thomas Jefferson, just as he feared would happen. Great for the entire family old enough to understand the complex issues surrounding the Revolution and the founding of our nation.",1262044800,2,942,4.514619883040936
3118573,5,B0013NAML0,"I enjoyed this series when it first aired on PBS and it is even better seeing it again in comparison to HBO's John Adams.  While the HBO John Adams may have more elaborate sets and provides some interesting period details, such as how the Adams family got inoculated for smallpox, the savagery of tar and feathering, and John Adams' deteriorating teeth in old age, the Adams Chronicles brings to life the history and significance that 4 generations of the Adams family played in American History.

With superb acting from George Grizzard and Kathyrn Walker as John and Abigail Adams, William Daniels and David Birney as John Quincy Adams and strong supporting actors, such as John Houseman, the Adams Chronicles depicts the significance that the Adamses played in our country's history over some 150 years.  The Adams Chronicles is also largely faithful to the historically significant events, going past where John Adams left off.  A few episodes of John Adams are ones I would not be comfortable watching with my elementary school kids, nor ones I necessarily would want to watch again myself - the extended scene of John and Abigail's daughter Nabby's breast surgery in the last episode of the HBO series was uncalled for in comparison with what should have been a more extended portrayal of the historically significant correspondence and perspectives on the founding of the young nation that John Adams and Thomas Jefferson resumed in retirement for some 15 years, culminating in their deaths on the same day, the 50th  July 4th anniversary.  The HBO series also strayed a bit with some of the historic facts. For example, for some reason, it portrayed Nabby and Colonel Smith as marrying after John Adams was vice president and the Adamses were all reunited in America. In reality, they married two years earlier in England and already were parents with John and Abigail's first grandchild born a year before John and Abigail returned to the US.  However, one episode of John Adams that is superior to that of the Adams Chronicles is the second episode on the events of 1776 leading to the declaration, portrayed in more detail and dramatic effect, if not with the spirited singing of the musical, 1776.

In contrast, I would highly recommend the Adams Chronicles for anyone who enjoys great acting, intelligent dialogue and writing, and a perspective on significant events in US history.  The episodes on John Quincy Adams and his descendants were also dramatic and a good perspective on 19th century US history.  The episode on John Quincy Adams' abolitionist efforts in Congress and his defense of slaves before the Supreme Court, for example, provided a perspective on another outstanding episode in history.  This is a good complement to the movie, Amistad, which was an excellent drama as depicted by Anthony Hopkins.

In short, my family has enjoyed watching repeat episodes of the Adams Chronicles, and anyone interested in 18th and 19th century US history would enjoy this series.",1252713600,12,2995,5.016129032258065

Washington, King George III, John Hancock, Ben Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, and others were there when the Adams family worked in their way to make America the United States. What this delightful video history also presents, in addition, is the powerful force that wives and children had upon the family leadership.  Of course, the children would eventually become the leaders in the family as well as the nation.

""The Adams Chronicles"" is 13 chapters/episodes of a family 4-generation history that impacted upon every American. Also other countries.  Although not every detail of this family could be put into this 13 hours of history, enough is there.  We have the personal side of the Adams' history due to the preservation of the letters of John and Abigail (Smith) Adams.

The Adams Chronicles tells the story of 4 generations of the family.  In many ways what makes it interesting is that it is more than just the story of John and John Quincy.  Owing to the fact that the show was produced over 30 years ago it will look a little dated sound and picture wise relative to todays TV shows.  But, the quality is still quite good, and does not get in the way of the story.  The only reason I mention it is I'm sure some will compare it to the much more lavishly produced John Adams mini-series just put out by HBO.  Needless to say HBO had $$$ and computer technology not available in the mid-70s when the Adams Chronicles was done.

As for the history, well, a great deal is left out, and one can imagine most people being quite confused.

3352942,5,B0013NAML0,"Here was America's answer to the great literary and historical dramas and miniseries from Great Britain in 1976. It aired regularly only twice (multiple airings on different PBS outlets) in 1976 for America's Bicentennial and in 1986 for the centennial of the Statue of Liberty. After that, it was relegated to the vaults with only VHS and Beta copies made from the original broadcasts in the hands of a few collectors. It is a brilliant series, brilliantly acted and directed. The late George Grizzard seemed to be a lock for the Emmy for Best Actor in a Dramatic Series of Miniseries (it was won, and just as deservedly so, by the late Gordon Jackson - Hudson on the BBC's ""Upstairs, Downstairs"") for his outstanding portrayal of John Adams. William Daniels (who played John Adams on Broadway and in the film version of ""1776"") reprises his role of eldest son John Quincy Adams after 24 years. (He first played John Quincy in his 1952 television debut, the Hallmark Hall of Fame's presentation of ""A Woman of the Ages,"" a drama about First Lady Abigail Adams.)

In a production painstakingly assembled by Virgina Kassel and coordinating producer Robert Costello (""The Patty Duke Show,"" ""Dark Shadows,"" ""All My Children""), some of the great writers and directors of television's Golden Age came together with many of the finest of the Broadway stage to deliver 150 years of history. The series was taken from, not merely based on, the superlative volume of the same name, and much of the dialog comes from letters, journal writings and diaries from Adams family.

It's a decent transfer from the original tapes to the DVDs, but it was diappointing that the original ""collage"" openings (showing images from each of the 13 episodes as narrator Michael Tolan said, ""Four generations...one family...for one hundred-fifty years their lives are interwoven with American history."") from 1976 with the complete opening music weren't restored and the abbreviated openings from the 1986 rebroadcasts were used. Still, it is extremely satisfying to finally have this remarkable series about one of America's greatest and most historically influential families restored to us in a form where we won't have to wait another 22 years. It's a shame that it wasn't re-introduced while Mr. Grizzard was still alive to see a couple of new generations enjoy and learn from one of his greatest achievements. HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

The series was based on a book by Jack Shepherd entitled: ""The Adams Chronicles, Four Generations of Greatness"" with an introduction by the famous author Daniel J. Boorstin (Long before he became popular for his ""Discoverers"", etc.) Published by Little, Brown in Boston, Mass. in 1975 (very appropriate !) and covered 150 years of the Adams family involvement in the emerging nation and the politics of the era in which they lived.
The series mirrored the book almost chapter by chapter. Intended to re-familiarize our nation with the leaders from Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, etc. for the celebration of the Bicentennial of America in 1976.,this is past history to be proud of in every respect. The most surprising element is how well the actors played their roles and the interesting insights we get to see, including the popularity of Dr. Franklin in France and his ""adventures"" in becoming a living pop icon of the era.
The transfer is very plain, but this was not a big production anyway and was rather skimpy with sets, relying on actors to fill out the picture for us. This they do very well. Any History major, specializing in the Revolutionary era in America will not be able to resist the charm of seeing pages of the past made into the land of the living.
A great legacy of cultural film. Reviewing it now you may find that you need to refresh your usage of certain words. The Adams were an educated lot and the words used in this work have been out of favor for some time, so have a Dictionary near to remind yourself when you hear them.
Well recommended, somewhat scholarly but also entertaining. Providing a unique look into a proud American past. You can't leave these 13 episodes without learning something and most likely a favorable impression.",1208649600,56,2040,4.798295454545454

3352950,5,B0013NAML0,"Produced by PBS as part of the American Bicentennial celebration in 1976, this superb 13 hour television film chronicles the lives of four generations of the illustrious Adams family. It depicts approximately 150 years - from 1750 to 1900 - in the saga of this family whose history is nearly synonymous with that of the difficult birth and adolescence of the American republic. Central to this sprawling tale are the lives of four Adams men: the patriarch John Adams, the second president of the United States, his son John Quincy Adams, the sixth president, his son Charles Francis Adams, an Ambassador to Great Britain during the era of the Civil War, and his son, the historian Henry Adams. Because the family inevitably participated in the central events of their time, especially during the era of the Revolution and shortly thereafter, the series becomes a splendid, often probing depiction of America's early years. Featuring superb acting, wonderful period sets and costumes and, most importantly, truly stellar writing, this may arguably be the finest miniseries, along with the still  unreleased Oppenheimer starring Sam Waterston, that American television has ever produced.

George Grizzard portrays John Adams from youth to old age. He is splendid, as is William Daniels who portrays John Quincy from ages 50 to 81. Daniels is no stranger to portraying Adams's having played John Adams in the film of the musical 1776. David Birney portrays John Quincy Adams from ages 36 to 48. John Beal plays Charles Francis Adams and Peter Brandon plays Henry Adams. John Houseman reprises his Paper Chase crotchety attorney role as the irrascible Justice Gridley, John Adam's early legal mentor. The series depicts all of the founding fathers, doing so with humanity and very few marble bust performances. The women of the Adams family are portrayed with sensitivity and subtlety, averting the temptation of allowing them to become mere cyphers. Kathryn Walker and Leora Dana play Abigail Adams from her youth to her death, both actresses portraying John Adams' beloved wife with warmth, gentle humor, keen intelligence and stunning emotional depth. Her character's portrayal is crucial to the success of this series and they acquit it with grace and style. All of the many performances are exemplary in their own unique ways. It is gratifying that this series is finally available on DVD. If you enjoy historical drama and/or American history, then you will certainly enjoy this superb series. Most strongly recommended.

Each episode covers a different period in the lives of the various members of the Adams family who served in public office.

The musical '1776' is excellent as well and mostly historically accurate. I did not care for the HBO production of the David McCullough biography but loved the book itself. Most people don't know that John Hancock was also born in Quincy. His birthplace is now the Quincy Historical Society, located between Peacefield and the Church of the Presidents, where both presidents and their wives Abigail and Louisa Catherine are entombed. Originally they were buried across the street from the church and you will find many famous names there, too.
John Hancock married Dorothy Quincy and you can take tours of her mansion, which has underground tunnels where the family hid from Indians and Redcoats.

3353045,5,B0013NAML0,"Back during the Bicentennial period when I was a college history student I remember being riveted to a 13 part PBS series called The Adams Chronicles, the story of four generations of the Massachusetts family which rose from hardscrabble farming to the heights of law, politics, industry, and scholarship.  Now that I've seen it again after thirty five years I notice that it's much heavier on dialogue and lighter on action than I remembered, but nevertheless I still found it interesting and often spellbinding.

The series begins with the young John Adams paying court to an outspoken and independent minded girl named Abigail Smith.  It traces his legal career and his growing involvement with other colonists seeking more self-government and eventually independence from Great Britain.  We see Adams representing the new United States in France and Britain, ably assisted by his son John Quincy Adams, and then watch as he becomes Vice President and then President.  The focus then shifts to John Quincy Adams, who serves the US as diplomat, Secretary of State, President, and finally as a Congressman from his Massachusetts district.  Next we see John Quincy's son Charles Francis Adams representing the US in Britain during the Civil War, then the final episodes focus on Charles Francis's sons Henry, who led a scholarly life as historian and writer, and Charles Francis II, who became an industrialist and controlled the Union Pacific Railroad for awhile.

The series is, as I said above, heavy on dialogue, but that's because most of it is taken directly from Adams family letters and other documents.  There are many lighter moments which amuse but do not detract from the overall high tone of the series.  Another positive feature which I didn't remember well from my first viewing is the attention paid to the Adams women, beginning with Abigail and continuing through her daughter in law Louisa Johnson Adams and thence to the wives of Charles Francis Adams and his sons, which makes it clear that they were all intelligent and outspoken. Although much of the attention of the series necessarily focuses on the family's public roles, notice is also taken of the Adams' numerous domestic difficulties.  They were not wealthy compared to many of their contemporaries, and emotional problems took a toll as well, particularly among the sons of John Quincy Adams and in Henry Adams' wife Marian ""Clover"" Hooper.

The history of these four generations of the Adams family is the history of the first century of the United States itself writ small, and this mini-series is an able chronicle of both.",1364342400,,2607,5.053613053613054
3353046,5,B0013NAML0,"I totally enjoyed this mini-series.  All the actors were outstanding in their roles.  I learned more about the Admams Family than I ever knew before.  The one thing that I would have liked to have seen was a chapter about the exchange of letters between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson after both left the Presidency.  Aside from that, you learn how the Adams's were way ahead of their time in the causes that they cared about.  I watched the mini-series ""John Adams"" and heard many of the lines that were used in the Adams Chronicles.  I guess that it is safe to assume that the people who put together ""John Adams"" also watched the Adams Chronicles. The Adams Chronicles is truly worth watching.",1363651200,,697,4.626016260162602
3353047,3,B0013NAML0,"I found the earliest part with John & son John Quincy the best.  I thought the John Adams mini series dvd (from HBO) was outstanding, & this series paled in comparison.  It still was entertaining, had not seen it in 1976.",1362268800,,221,4.365853658536586

3353050,4,B0013NAML0,"We loved the HBO ""John Adams"" series, in spite of some howling historical inaccuracies. Then, we made our way through the 13 episodes of this old series, not expecting very much, really. We were happily surprised, then, by its quality, its attention to detail, and its thoroughness. While not as glitzy and visually appealing as the HBO series, with little of the action and (often computer generated) splashy scenery, all in all, ""The Adams Chronicles"" does a better job of teaching American history to its watchers, less way-layed as it is by the demands of ""action"", melodrama, and commerciality. Most importantly, perhaps, by extending the narrative through four generations of the Adams family, this series does some important work in relaying the story of numerous often overlooked episodes in American history, especially the administration of President John Quincy Adams, US-British relations during the Civil War, and the development of the national railroad system. Some episodes are better than others, and the lives and careers of the two Presidents Adams might just be more inherently interesting than those of their later descendants. The episode on Charles Francis Adams was especially dull-- various people make long eloqutions while standing at various desks or seated at various tables, with little else happening-- and the quality of the acting, always uneven, declined precipitously through the last three episodes. The writing is occasionally stilted and rhetorical. But all in all, production values are very high (especially amazing when you consider that the series is now almost 40 years old), and ""The Adams Chronicles"" would be a wise and interesting investment of time and attention for anyone wishing a good survey of America's story from the Revolution trough the Gilded Age.",1341792000,5,1805,5.336842105263158
3353061,4,B0013NAML0,"There are perhaps a few criticisms one can make of the Channel-13 NYC miniseries THE ADAMS CHRONICLES (1976).
1.) Despite being set during various war eras, we never see so much as a squad of soldiers.
2.) Characters are distorted to suit the narrative.
3.) Lack of storytelling continuity.

Chapter One ends with John Adams prepared to defend eight British soldiers involved in the Boston Massacre. Part Two opens with the verdict being read. An excellent opportunity for courtroom suspense was ignored.

There's many scenes of the first Continental Congress arguing over various issues large and small (lots of caricatures here), but nothing of that all-important vote prior to the endorsement of the Declaration of Independence.

Alexander Hamilton is throughout the early chapters one-dimensional, a scoundrel of sorts with ambitions for the presidency. When John Adams retires after his single term ends, the Hamilton matter is left unresolved, as if he never existed.

In the first JQ Adams episode, during Treaty of Ghent negotiations to end the War of 1812, Henry Clay is presented as either a drunk out partying until dawn or an inflexible hothead bellowing demands at his British counterparts. Way too simplistic, as Clay was a consummate compromiser known in later years as the ""Great Pacificator.""

In Paris, Ben Franklin is shown as stubborn, easy to anger and a ""dirty old man"" out carousing at night. True or otherwise, we could've done without this tattling. Tom Jefferson fares better. He and the senior Adams have a falling out over support for the French Revolution, but Jefferson is never trashed for no longer being an ally.

Clearly, the budget available for this ambitious 13-part series went into costumes, props, sets and location shoots. The only action seen is wagging jawbones, and there's a lot of that. The formula for each Adams profiled seems to be two parts career to one part home life, a workable equation.

To read the above, you'd conclude I hated this program. Actually, within its limitations I looked forward to each episode, and can still recommend it as an opinion on historical events, if not a literal representation of them.",1341360000,2,2169,5.075842696629214

3353067,5,B0013NAML0,"I loved ""The Adams Chronicles"" when it first aired on PBS in 1976, and I'm delighted to see how well it holds up after nearly 35 years. People who saw HBO's ""John Adams"" and expect ""The Adams Chronicles"" to be a carbon copy will be disappointed in the earlier miniseries' staginess, borne of its low budget. But it's the history in ""The Adams Chronicles,"" and the vigor and passion with which it is presented, that make it exceptional. The scripts and dialogue make the historical issues crystal-clear, and also make it plain why they mattered. The dry lessons from our high-school history classes--the XYZ Affair, the election of 1824, the Slidell-Mason scandal--come urgently to life in this miniseries, making it a must-see for any history buff.

I appreciated the scope of ""The Adams Chronicles,"" which takes the story of the Adamses beyond the usual presentations of John and John Quincy to their children and grandchildren--diplomat Charles Francis, railroad magnate Charles Francis II, and historian-novelist Henry. Some viewers may feel a letdown in the series' last few episodes, which have inherently less drama than the stories of John and John Quincy. But those episodes also have their fascination, showing show how the Puritan rectitude and noblesse oblige of the Adamses became steadily less influential as America became a nation of immigrants. ""Do you know Sean O'Hara, Mr. Adams?"" one character asks Charles Francis II in the last episode. ""I know Sean O'Hara, and his vote counts just as much as yours.""

While I am second to none in my admiration of the performances of Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney in ""John Adams,"" the performances of George Grizzard and Kathryn Walker as John and Abigail are in their own way just as fine (Walker took home an Emmy, and Grizzard should have). I also loved the performance of William Daniels as John Quincy, particularly in John Quincy's last years as he became a fiery antislavery advocate in Congress and before the Supreme Court. It's also fun to see the familiar faces (John Houseman, Nancy Marchand, James Broderick) in small roles. Occasionally a supporting performance is less than effective (Tom Hulce as a law student comes to mind), but that is negligible. While you should turn to ""John Adams"" for greater dramatic sweep and better production values, ""The Adams Chronicles"" stands tall as a loving, often thrilling recreation of American history.",1268524800,4,2414,5.062814070351759

3353069,4,B0013NAML0,"I first saw ""The Adams Chronicles"" when it was originally aired on PBS. When it was released on DVD I purchased it. I thought I might use it in my Social Studies classes. The information - for people who LOVE history - is great. For today's high school audiences it is a bit dated and slow moving, but I thoroughly enjoyed it - again. The reader, as always must remember who is writing and if they are trying to send a message. Much of Adams' writing tends to put a positive spin on them and their thinking, but understanding that, the brilliant minds of both John and John Quincy easily shine through. This documentary, although not as insightful as Ellis's book on the John Adams, in it's own way helped to revive the reputation of a man lost in the shadow of Thomas Jefferson, just as he feared would happen. Great for the entire family old enough to understand the complex issues surrounding the Revolution and the founding of our nation.",1262044800,2,942,4.514619883040936
3353070,5,B0013NAML0,"I enjoyed this series when it first aired on PBS and it is even better seeing it again in comparison to HBO's John Adams.  While the HBO John Adams may have more elaborate sets and provides some interesting period details, such as how the Adams family got inoculated for smallpox, the savagery of tar and feathering, and John Adams' deteriorating teeth in old age, the Adams Chronicles brings to life the history and significance that 4 generations of the Adams family played in American History.

With superb acting from George Grizzard and Kathyrn Walker as John and Abigail Adams, William Daniels and David Birney as John Quincy Adams and strong supporting actors, such as John Houseman, the Adams Chronicles depicts the significance that the Adamses played in our country's history over some 150 years.  The Adams Chronicles is also largely faithful to the historically significant events, going past where John Adams left off.  A few episodes of John Adams are ones I would not be comfortable watching with my elementary school kids, nor ones I necessarily would want to watch again myself - the extended scene of John and Abigail's daughter Nabby's breast surgery in the last episode of the HBO series was uncalled for in comparison with what should have been a more extended portrayal of the historically significant correspondence and perspectives on the founding of the young nation that John Adams and Thomas Jefferson resumed in retirement for some 15 years, culminating in their deaths on the same day, the 50th  July 4th anniversary.  The HBO series also strayed a bit with some of the historic facts. For example, for some reason, it portrayed Nabby and Colonel Smith as marrying after John Adams was vice president and the Adamses were all reunited in America. In reality, they married two years earlier in England and already were parents with John and Abigail's first grandchild born a year before John and Abigail returned to the US.  However, one episode of John Adams that is superior to that of the Adams Chronicles is the second episode on the events of 1776 leading to the declaration, portrayed in more detail and dramatic effect, if not with the spirited singing of the musical, 1776.

In contrast, I would highly recommend the Adams Chronicles for anyone who enjoys great acting, intelligent dialogue and writing, and a perspective on significant events in US history.  The episodes on John Quincy Adams and his descendants were also dramatic and a good perspective on 19th century US history.  The episode on John Quincy Adams' abolitionist efforts in Congress and his defense of slaves before the Supreme Court, for example, provided a perspective on another outstanding episode in history.  This is a good complement to the movie, Amistad, which was an excellent drama as depicted by Anthony Hopkins.

In short, my family has enjoyed watching repeat episodes of the Adams Chronicles, and anyone interested in 18th and 19th century US history would enjoy this series.",1252713600,12,2995,5.016129032258065

Washington, King George III, John Hancock, Ben Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, and others were there when the Adams family worked in their way to make America the United States. What this delightful video history also presents, in addition, is the powerful force that wives and children had upon the family leadership.  Of course, the children would eventually become the leaders in the family as well as the nation.

""The Adams Chronicles"" is 13 chapters/episodes of a family 4-generation history that impacted upon every American. Also other countries.  Although not every detail of this family could be put into this 13 hours of history, enough is there.  We have the personal side of the Adams' history due to the preservation of the letters of John and Abigail (Smith) Adams.

The Adams Chronicles tells the story of 4 generations of the family.  In many ways what makes it interesting is that it is more than just the story of John and John Quincy.  Owing to the fact that the show was produced over 30 years ago it will look a little dated sound and picture wise relative to todays TV shows.  But, the quality is still quite good, and does not get in the way of the story.  The only reason I mention it is I'm sure some will compare it to the much more lavishly produced John Adams mini-series just put out by HBO.  Needless to say HBO had $$$ and computer technology not available in the mid-70s when the Adams Chronicles was done.

For anyone interested in learning about the first 100 years of American history.  This series is an excellent, and very enjoyable starting point.",1215734400,5,1034,4.2615384615384615

Grizzard and Daniels are especially solid, giving two of the best performances ever to be seen on television.  PBS would be wise to reprise this series for broadcast.

As for the history, well, a great deal is left out, and one can imagine most people being quite confused.

Nevertheless, this production is about as bad as it gets.

Two performances, and only two, deserve to be lauded as exemplary, and were executed with the kind of craftsmanship, attention to detail, subtlety, realism, historical accuracy and evident commitment to bringing to life the men portrayed: That of William Daniels as John Quincy Adams and that of Albert Stratton as Thomas Jefferson. Both performances yielded perfect likenesses of the men  portrayed, inside and out. Never, in either case, does one sense that Daniels or Stratton are actors playing a role; but in both cases Daniels and Stratton  are unmistakably the men that they portray.

The rest of the production is a joke.

The script is artificial and stilted and  the experienced actors deliver the dreadful lines that they were given with about as much talent as one would expect of high school kids in their first attempt at acting.

The child actors all seem to have been chosen because of their relationship with someone involved in the production, as no other reasonable
explanation could be found for the comical artificiality and talentless performances of every single child ""actor"" who appears in this series.

The laughable makeup is very hard to look past, especially if one is the least bit familiar with the historical record; and the evident blindness of the production team to keeping the hair arrangements of the individual characters, especially the main ones, consistent with the historical record, in general, and consistent from scene-to-scene and camera-angle to camera-angle, in particular, is enough to send one into a fit of
agony.

But it is easier to cover so much ground in a book than on a screen.

From a list of the episodes, one gets a sense of the scope of the Chronicles:  (1) John Adams, Lawyer (1758-1770); (2) John Adams, Revolutionary (1770-1776); (3) John Adams, Diplomat (1776-1783); (4) John Adams, Minister to Great Britain (1784-1787); (5) John Adams, Vice President (1788-1797); (6) John Adams, President (1797-1801); (7) John Quincy Adams, Diplomat (1809-1815); (8) John Quincy Adams, Secretary of State (1817-1825); (9) John Quincy Adams, President (1825-1829); (10) John Quincy Adams, Congressman (1831-1848); (11) Charles Francis Adams, Minister to Great Britain (1861-1868); (12) Henry Adams, Historian  (1870-1885); (13) Charles Francis Adams, II, Industrialist  (1886-1893).

The final three episodes focus on men with disparate concerns.  These men went separate ways, and met separate frustrations.  They did indeed experience what Nagel called a descent from glory.  As Charles Francis Adams, Sr., reflects after dreaming of his grandfathers role in the Revolutionary Era, In those days, the fate of one man could be the fate of a country.  Or, as Charles Francis Adams, II, remarks to Henry Adams, Perhaps the models we placed ourselves against were larger than life.  But perhaps the Adams family was merely living out what John Adams had predicted for nations:  There is no special providence for us.  We are not the Chosen People that I know of.  We must and shall go the way of the earth.

A few observations on the historical accuracy of  the Chronicles are in order.  First, they were prepared in cooperation with the Massachusetts Historical Society and the Adams Papers project.  Unlike many similar docudramas, they are largely based on original documents--the massive collection of Adams family papers held by the MHS (copies of these filled over 600 reels of microfilm).  For example, the criticisms John Adams directed to his fianc Abigail Smith (not sitting erect, walking with her toes inward, etc.) come directly from a May 7, 1764, document that he bluntly entitled, a Catalogue of your Faults, Imperfections, Defects, or whatever you please to call them.

Second, viewers should remember that, because they are largely based on the Adams family papers, the Chronicles tend to reflect the views of Adams family members.  Thus, in the words of John Adams, Franklin may appear as a lazy, senile old mischief maker, and Hamilton as an intriguer.  (Those interested in what the Founding Fathers thought about each other should read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Founders-on-the-Founders-Word-Portraits-from-the-American-Revolutionary-Era/dp/0813927579/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Founders on the Founders: Word Portraits from the American Revolutionary Era</a>&nbsp;edited by John Kaminski.

Third, only some of the Adams family papers survivemany documents were deliberately destroyed.  Work on the family papers began with John Adams, whose comment that they would make you alternately laugh and cry, fret and fume, stamp and scold, suggests that he did not intend to destroy all the embarrassing records.  But some subsequent family members clearly did intend to do so.

Growing up as an Adams was not easy.  (John advised John Quincy, if you do not rise to the head not only of your Profession, but of your Country, it will be owing to your own Laziness, Slovenliness and Obstinacy.  When he was 5 or 6, John Quincy wrote to his cousin Elizabeth Cranch (who was a few years older than he), i have made But veray little proviciancy in reading . . .  to[o] much of my time in play  [th]ere is a great Deal of room for me to grow better[.]  And John Quincy, after trying to instruct his son Charles Francis, complained, I find as with his elder brothers a difficulty in fixing his attention.  Charles Francis was then two years old.)  The Adams children were being trained to be intellectual and moral athletes.  Some of those who survived this training did well.  But not all survived.  Some succumbed to alcoholism, or were fell short for other reasons.  Many records relating to these unsuccessful family members have been destroyed.  Few of the surviving records relate to Johns son Thomas Boylston Adams or John Quincys son George Washington Adams.  Similarly, there remain very few documents about Henry Adams wife Clover Hooper.  The Chronicles attempt to compensate, to some extent, for gaps in the documentary record.  But  they gloss over mental problems in Clovers family.  Before Clover took her own life, her aunt and her sister had committed suicide, and her brother eventually died in a mental institution after an unsuccessful suicide attempt.  Although it is not evident in the Chronicles, Henrys relatives had understandable misgivings about his marrying into the Hooper family.

Given their scope, the Chronicles had to omit and abbreviate much of the Adams story.  Missing are John and Abigails 1787 meeting with Sally Hemings, the reconciliation of Jefferson and Adams after Jeffersons presidency, Brooks Adams historical writings, or anything about the fourth generation after 1893Brooks Adams did not die until 1927.

This docudrama was highly successful.  It received a total of 11 Emmy Awards, and 17 Emmy nominations (1976 and 1977), only three of which (to George Grizzard, Kathryn Walker, and Pamela Payton-Wright) were for acting.  The appearance of certain characters is strikingly realistic (but most of them, from King George to John Calhoun, speak with the same accent).  This miniseries provides an interesting glimpse into American history and the Adams familys place in it.",1469923200,2,6945,5.953582240161453
