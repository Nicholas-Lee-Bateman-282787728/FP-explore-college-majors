I LIKE THALIA'S ROLE AND THIS NOVELA
SHE DID AND AWESOME JOB!

PS.. I LOVE SORAYA MONTENEGRO TOO  (ITATI CANTORAL) AND CARLOTA THE MAID HEHEHE!!
Y'ALL SHOULD BUY THIS NOVELA IF YOU ARE A THALIFAN DE CORAZON!",1201564800,,228,4.675
3002298,5,B000XFVINU,This is one of the best telenovelas ever made.  I just purchased my copy and can't wait to receive it.  I recommend this wonderful love story to anyone that enjoys telenovelas.,1201219200,,176,4.645161290322581
3002299,5,B000XFVINU,"Thalia is absolutely ravenously beautiful in this delightful melodrama that leaves you gasping at the end of each capitulo/chapter. It has never been seen with English subtitles in my area of the US. Most novellas from telemundo or univision are strictly in Spanish. If you click on the comments on the prior review you will see that 2 people have responded to say that the reviewer is not accurately reflecting the story. The story is not exactly as he states and I am not convinced what he was watching. But Thalia and the entire cast are excellent, the story gripping and heart wrenching. The title song is available on an album or as an MP3 download and it is a lot of fun...as is this much awaited novella on dvd format. There is deliberate pure evil, sweetness and goodness, funny business, stupidity, family values, unquestionable sexiness...everything you want in a novella. Forget the other reviewer story. Enjoy it. My husband was in love with Thalia for a few years after this aired...so it is not just a chica thing.",1198886400,,1028,4.748603351955308
3002300,3,B000XFVINU,"NOTE: MOST Novelas have ENGLISH subtitles including this one.
The 1995 soap, ""Maria la del Barrio"" (Maria from the Barrio) was very popular although not as sucessful as ""Marimar"" the year before. This was the third and last soap in which Thalia played a poor girl named Maria. After all three MARIA soaps had circeld the world, a census showed that they had been viewed by more than a billion people!
STORY PLOT: Maria Ernandes was a scavenger who lived in a Mexican barrio (neighborhood) on the outskirts of the big city with her Godmother, who suddenly dies, leaving Maria to fend for herself. The local priest had been asked by the godmother to help Maria when she was gone and so he asked one of his benefactors Don Fernando if he might employ her as a servant. Maria, wearing torn and stinky clothes, is brought to the De La Vega mansion, where she quickly meets Don Fernando's drunk son, Luis. She falls head over heels for him, despite his lack of respect and order. As a reult, Maria becomes the primary target of Fernando's neice, Soraya Montenegro, who suppoesdly ""loves"" Luis. Although Luis first marries the ambitious, possessive and bitter Soraya, who is unfaifthfull to him, he eventually divorces her soon after and then marries Maria. Soraya is later thrown out of the mansion due to her constant threats against Maria and her own family. As the wife of one of the most richest and respectable families, Maria is well educated. Months later she is with child. When Luis sees his brother and Maria embracing, fueld and blinded by jealousy he abandons her and goes to Europe, where she quickly followed him. She tried convincing him that he had the wrong idea about her and that the child she was going to have was Luis, not his brother. But Luis furiously throws Maria out, refusing to believe her. She is then forced to return to Mexico. When Luis sends a letter to Maria demanding a divorce, the desperate, lonely and heartbroken Maria wonders into the streets by herself. She however, passes out and is rushed to a local hospital where she gives birth to her son, whom she named after his father but as a nickname called him ""Nandito."" At this time still desperate and hearbroken, Maria suffers from a temporary bout of instanity and without knowing it, gives her baby son away to a poor peasent women in a park. When she realized her mistake, the once-happy, sweet and innocent Maria becomes a suffering woman, who would stop at nothing to find her son. Luis returns her home and, feeling horribly guilty for his misunderstanding and for losing thier son, he adopts a baby girl...whom Maria at first sobbingly rejects, then takes the baby as her own...but never loses faith that one day she may recover her lost son. Meanwhile Luis' ex-wife and Maria's rival, Soraya suffers a horrible accident and dies...years pass by, and still Maria goes out onto the streets daily, looking for her son, while this has placed tension between her and her husband, who believes that his son is dead or will never be found. With many more twists to come, ""MARIA LA DEL BARRIO"" has a rather enchanting storyline, but about halway through changes dramatically. I personally like the first half better, partly because the second half of the soap has many inconsistancies...a lot of scenes don't make to much sense. But the twists near the end of the story include the unexpected return of the villian Soraya, who spent months secretly recovering in a hospital, family reunions, family loses; Soraya later remarries, murders her second husband, sets Maria up and as a reuslt Maria is sent to a prision which soon after burns down and no trace of her can be found...finally there's the rather unexpected ending...or is it?

3002307,4,B000XFVINU,"Maria la del Barrio (Maria from the Neighborhood - 823 minutes)

Our sweet orphan is with her godmother at church when the old woman dies. As she dies, she makes the priest promise that he will find a place for Maria. A wealthy man, Don Fernando de la Vega (Ricardo Blume) takes her home over the protests of his family.

Before long, our sweet-natured 15-year-old Maria (Thala) has won them over and Luis Fernando (Fernando Colunga) the eldest, has fallen in love with her.

Enter an evil, scheming young woman named Soraya (Itat Cantoral) who has her own plans for Luis, so she seduces him while he is drunk and pretends to be pregnant, so he marries her. Once that problem is settled (she supposedly dies), our two lovers get married and Maria becomes pregnant. When Luis  discovers her talking with his brother, he jealously assumes the worst, so she runs away.

After many trials and tribulations, she has the baby, a little boy, but has lost her mind, so she gives him away to a fruit seller in the barrio, after requesting he be named Luis Fernando (""Nandito"").

Back with Luis (who realizes he had overreacted), she goes on a quest to find that missing baby. He tries to comfort her with an adopted baby girl, ""Tita,"" later played by Ludwika Paleta. There are many, many sub-plots and characters, all of which serve to entertain and engage. This is a satisfying and well-produced telenovela despite the brutal editing that is necessary to reduce this to miniseries length.

Televisa ganaria ms dinero si hiciera las cosas bien. deberia volver a editar grandes novelas como Cuna de Lobos, Rosa Salvaje, Los ricos tambien lloran en versiones originales completas. seguro que la gente las compra y tan encantadas. en fin, a ver si Televisa se digna a hacer las cosas bien.",1350950400,,742,4.455882352941177

I would have gladly paid triple for the full show without the horrible editing job and terrible music dubbing that makes it difficult to hear the dialogue. Definitely not worth the money as is. The only reason it gets 3 stars is because I still love the Maria story and having already seen the show, my mind was able to fill in the blanks and follow along.",1332633600,2,627,4.277310924369748

In short, here is the plot: Maria is poor ""barrio"" girl who meets Luis Fernando, a rich guy. Luis Fernando witnesses an encounter between Maria, now his wife, and his brother--who was in love with Maria--and he mistakenly thinks they are an item. Luis Fernando leaves Maria, who is pregnant, but when she gives birth a boy, she gives it away and due to her guilt she goes mad...

3002319,5,B000XFVINU,"Ordene este Dvd para Coleccionarlo.
Es la Version 2010 de Maria la del Barrio (Edicion Mexico).
Yo ya tengo la Version Internacional, (Region 1 Estados Unidos) con Subtitulos en Ingles, pero Me Gusto Mucho la Nueva Presentacion y decidi Comprarlo nuevamente.
Sinceramente Desconosco si el Resumen de la Telenovela es otro o es exactamente el mismo que el anterior, como tampoco se si en esta Edicion fue arreglado el Defecto que tenia sobre la musicalizacion de fondo. Ojala asi sea. La verdad es una Exelente Novela, y Me Encanto. Espero que le hayan mejorado eso a esta Edicion y que contenga la Msica Incidental Original.
Lo que si se es que las Fotos son Muy Bonitas, sobre todo las que trae internamente el Dvd, los Discos son Exelentes, de mucho mejor calidad que la version anterior (ya que venian de doble cara), en esta Edicion son 4 Dvds en lugar de 3 y trae impresos a Thalia y a Fernando Colunga en los Discos. Al ser Edicion Mexico/Region 4 No Trae Subtitulos en Ingles, pero de todas formas, aunque no contenga Subtitulos y la Musicalizacion Original, bien vale la pena Coleccionarlo, por la Calidad y el Producto en si mismo.
Cuando lo tenga y vea, les cuento que tal esta y si es igual al otro o no...
8/6/2011: Es Exactamente Igual a la otra Version, solo cambia la Presentacion y el Diseo del Dvd, pero el Resumen es El Mismo.
No tiene La Musicalizacion Original de la Telenovela, viene igual que el otro, una Msica encima de la otra... pero pese a eso No Me Arrepiento, Me Gusto Mucho el Set del Dvd y vale la pena Coleccionarlo.",1305936000,5,1548,4.551971326164875

3002327,2,B000XFVINU,"I received my order on time and was very excited to watch this show. However when I opened the box I saw that all of the DVDs were scratched due to the interesting box they're placed in which allows for the plastic surfaces around the DVDs to hit and scratch the DVDs very easily. It was impossible to miss and I cannot believe anyone would pack DVDs in this manner. Nonetheless I managed to make the DVDs work and watch them, until I reached the 3rd DVD whose first side is basically ruined entirely and my computer refused to read it. Hence I couldn't watch the rest of the show. I was not planning on writing this review had the DVDs actually managed to work in the end, but now that there is no way for me to actually watch the rest of the show I think it is quite appropriate that I write this review. I am extremely disappointed and am going to take action to get UNSCRATCHED DVDs shipped to me for free, because this is absolutely ridiculous.",1295827200,2,949,4.277777777777778
3002328,4,B000XFVINU,"La Edicion del Dvd no es mala, pero podria haber sido mucho mejor, primero porque no contiene ninguna de las peleas de Maria con Soraya, ni la del teatro, ni en la carcel, ni en la casa de Soraya por Nandito. Ninguna.
Por otra parte faltan algunas Escenas que estan Muy Buenas de Fernando Colunga en la Mansion de la Vega, en la piscina y demas, que tendrian que estar al comienzo, en el Dvd 1.
Tambien note que falta la parte donde Soraya intenta huir del pais, para no ir a la carcel y es capturada por la Policia.
Otra cosa a destacar es que en muchas Escenas no se entiende el dialogo ya que la musica incidental que pusieron sobre la original hace que no se escuchen bien las voces de los personajes. Y lo que realmente me molesto mucho fue que sacaron muchas partes del Final, cuando Soraya se pelea con Gonzalo por Maria y discuten y se golepan, esa es una de las Mejores Escenas casi sobre el Final, y de cuando Soraya secuestra a Maria le quitan la parte en donde Soraya le confiesa a Maria sus crimenes y maldades. La parte final de la Fiesta de Aniversario esta editada, solo dejan cuando Maria y Luis Fernando salen al balcon y ella le da la noticia de que esta esperando un hijo.
Me hubiese gustado que esta Edicion tubiera Extras, Entrevistas, Bloopers, Fotos, o algun extra, porque realmente es una Exelente Telenovela y hubiese estado bueno que pusieran algun Material, pero no contiene nada de eso.
Tiene la Primera Entrada Original, los Creditos y la Duracion que es de Mas de 13 Horas, Dura Exactamente 13 Horas y 21 Minutos. Pese a eso, lo Compre porque Soy Fan de Thalia y Fernando Colunga y (Para Mi) Itati Cantoral hizo un Exelente Papel como Villana en esta Telenovela, fue Magistral, uno de los Mejores Antagonicos de la Historia de las Telenovelas Mexicanas.",1287705600,,1784,4.475460122699387

The show is dated but still entertaining despite some bad acting. HOWEVER, the music score is AWFUL. It's harsh, jumbled noise that makes no sense, is highly distracting and drowns out the dialogue. So bad that I had to watch a lot of scenes with the sound off. It would be better to have NO music than such horrible music. It detracts from the show a lot. Many telenovelas (when originally shown on TV) have very good music that help the plot along. This one is all but killed by its horrible music.

3002336,2,B000XFVINU,"I remember watching this Telenovela with my mother, aunts, and grandmother back when it first aired because of its sensationalism and plot. Wanting to relive those moments of my childhood by buying the DVD and watching it caused me only disappointment. Upon watching the first episode, I noticed that some serious editing (cropping) was done to the DVD version. Clearly for timing purposes. That was hard enough to overlook as it is, but then I noticed that the original Score to Maria La Del Barrio was not used. In fact, the DVD version is dubbed with some different musical score over the original score and it all sounds ridiculous. In some scenes you have the original musical score playing, with the DVD score playing even louder on top of that to cover the original score for what I imagine is copyright reasons, and then you have the actors voices that you can hardly make out due to the two musical scores playing on top of each other. The entire DVD set comes off as extremely cheap from the marvel that it once was. It was a serious disappointment for those of us that have seen the GREAT ORIGINAL version of this excellent story. If you can overlook the time editing and horrible dubbing that was done to this DVD set, then perhaps you can enjoy it as much as the rest of us have enjoyed the original. I would never ever recommend anyone to purchase this, and would recommend to just wait and watch it when it reruns on latin american networks.",1232236800,3,1456,4.561068702290076

3002350,1,B000XFVINU,"Maria La Del Barrio one of Thalia and Televisa's biggest hits finally makes it to DVD. Was it worth the wait? NO. For those of you who fell in love with this series when it first hit the air waves in 1996 you will be in for quite a shock. This is a butchered version of the original story.

It really makes no sense in releasing these famous Televisa telenovelas if they are not going to be faithful to their original presentation.

The butchering done to these episodes in inexcusable! The storyline makes absolutely no sense now as it jumps to plot point to plot point. It's laughable. Actually it's infuriating.

If you're looking forward to finally having Maria and Zoraya's infamous cat fight inside the opera house parking garage you can forget about it --- it's been cut and is only referred to in a brief flashback! Actually Maria's first sit down dinner with the family is also gone along with a lot of other scenes. UNFORGIVABLE!

Granted we're not talking about ""Gone With the Wind"" here, but still MariMar, Maria La Del Barrio, Maria Mercedes and Rosalinda are four of Thalia's biggest and best in the telenovela genre and have garnered fans on an international level.

It's an injustice that just to make a quick buck these shows are being rushed out on DVD in such a careless fashion.

People who have never seen these shows to begin with are going to think this is what was originally aired on television. It is not. Not by a long shot.

Televisa needs to get their act together and release these shows in their COMPLETE, UNEDITED ORIGINAL VERSIONS or just quit scamming loyal fans with this inferior product.",1212796800,51,1624,4.618055555555555

My mother recently bought the dvd for my grandmother, and the whole family was excited to sit down and watch it, especially me because of the English subtitles. I quickly became incredibly confused because the editing was so oddly choppy. I understand that the cinemetography would be on the more amateur side, since this is an older novela and a soap opera after all, but this seemed like something more.
I looked up video clips of the show on youtube, and to my dismay, the clips of the same scenes on my dvd had several minutes more to them than on my dvd. Who ever edited this disc hacked away at all the important parts that link this into a coherent story. Please, someone come out with the real show!!! This is ridiculous!

Itati Cantoral does give a great performance and her crying is just HISTERICAL!!  My recommendation is that TRUE novela fans WILL purchase this novela!!,1206316800,,479,4.471264367816092

They just cut important scenes from de story. If you didn't see the soap opera on television, it will be difficult for you to understand, because everything happens so fast.

And that's not the worst thing. They tried to replace the original score. I can't explain why!. It's so difficult to believe that Televisa can't pay for the rights of the music. You can't understand many of the dialogues because of that. It's like a noise.

If you like this soap opera, just don't buy this item. I'm a fan of Thala, and now I know why she never says anything about this DVD's. They are not a good product. I give two stars to it because of the song, the video quality, and the DVD cover.",1205452800,5,828,4.301282051282051

3002355,3,B000XFVINU,"About halfway through (maybe a bit after when Maria is married), this soap is pretty good.  However, the first part when Thalia is supposed to be a 15 yr old girl, is kind of painful.  Her acting really sucks and is very awkward.  However, once she begins the search for her son, the soap becomes addictive.  Overall, I give it 3 stars because it keeps my attention, but I wouldn't go through and watch it again.  I'd have rented it if that were possible.  It's not the most sophisticated program and the characters do lack depth, except for maybe Maria. For example, the relationship between Maria and Luis Fernando is very shallow.  In the beginning, he seems to hate her and then all of a sudden he's in love but you're not sure if he's still faking it or not.  There's really no character development at all.  People are just THRUST into the common soap opera roles.  Like I said, once all the stuff is settled, the soap becomes pretty good about 3 hours or so into the disk.  The beginning really SUCKS.
The kids show Rebelde is actually far better done and the actors are probably better too. But, Thalia's beautiful and has an attractive personality, so I'd recommend watching this at least once.  Try to borrow it from a friend.  Don't buy it.",1203638400,,1251,4.506666666666667

If you click on the comments on the prior review you will see that 2 people have responded to say that the reviewer is not accurately reflecting the story. The story is not exactly as he states and I am not convinced what he was watching. But Thalia and the entire cast are excellent, the story gripping and heart wrenching. The title song is available on an album or as an MP3 download and it is a lot of fun...as is this much awaited novella on dvd format. There is deliberate pure evil, sweetness and goodness, funny business, stupidity, family values, unquestionable sexiness...everything you want in a novella. Forget the other reviewer story. Enjoy it.

The 1995 soap, ""Maria la del Barrio"" (Maria from the Barrio) was very popular although not as sucessful as ""Marimar"" the year before. This was the third and last soap in which Thalia played a poor girl named Maria. After all three MARIA soaps had circeld the world, a census showed that they had been viewed by more than a billion people!
STORY PLOT: Maria Ernandes was a scavenger who lived in a Mexican barrio (neighborhood) on the outskirts of the big city with her Godmother, who suddenly dies, leaving Maria to fend for herself. The local priest had been asked by the godmother to help Maria when she was gone and so he asked one of his benefactors Don Fernando if he might employ her as a servant. Maria, wearing torn and stinky clothes, is brought to the De La Vega mansion, where she quickly meets Don Fernando's drunk son, Luis. She falls head over heels for him, despite his lack of respect and order. As a reult, Maria becomes the primary target of Fernando's neice, Soraya Montenegro, who suppoesdly ""loves"" Luis. Although Luis first marries the ambitious, possessive and bitter Soraya, who is unfaifthfull to him, he eventually divorces her soon after and then marries Maria. Soraya is later thrown out of the mansion due to her constant threats against Maria and her own family. As the wife of one of the most richest and respectable families, Maria is well educated. Months later she is with child. When Luis sees his brother and Maria embracing, fueld and blinded by jealousy he abandons her and goes to Europe, where she quickly followed him. She tried convincing him that he had the wrong idea about her and that the child she was going to have was Luis, not his brother. But Luis furiously throws Maria out, refusing to believe her. She is then forced to return to Mexico. When Luis sends a letter to Maria demanding a divorce, the desperate, lonely and heartbroken Maria wonders into the streets by herself. She however, passes out and is rushed to a local hospital where she gives birth to her son, whom she named after his father but as a nickname called him ""Nandito."" At this time still desperate and hearbroken, Maria suffers from a temporary bout of instanity and without knowing it, gives her baby son away to a poor peasent women in a park. When she realized her mistake, the once-happy, sweet and innocent Maria becomes a suffering woman, who would stop at nothing to find her son. Luis returns her home and, feeling horribly guilty for his misunderstanding and for losing thier son, he adopts a baby girl...whom Maria at first sobbingly rejects, then takes the baby as her own...but never loses faith that one day she may recover her lost son. Meanwhile Luis' ex-wife and Maria's rival, Soraya suffers a horrible accident and dies...years pass by, and still Maria goes out onto the streets daily, looking for her son, while this has placed tension between her and her husband, who believes that his son is dead or will never be found. With many more twists to come, ""MARIA LA DEL BARRIO"" has a rather enchanting storyline, but about halway through changes dramatically. I personally like the first half better, partly because the second half of the soap has many inconsistancies...a lot of scenes don't make to much sense. But the twists near the end of the story include the unexpected return of the villian Soraya, who spent months secretly recovering in a hospital, family reunions, family loses; Soraya later remarries, murders her second husband, sets Maria up and as a reuslt Maria is sent to a prision which soon after burns down and no trace of her can be found...finally there's the rather unexpected ending...or is it?

Our sweet orphan is with her godmother at church when the old woman dies. As she dies, she makes the priest promise that he will find a place for Maria. A wealthy man, Don Fernando de la Vega (Ricardo Blume) takes her home over the protests of his family.

Before long, our sweet-natured 15-year-old Maria (Thala) has won them over and Luis Fernando (Fernando Colunga) the eldest, has fallen in love with her.

Enter an evil, scheming young woman named Soraya (Itat Cantoral) who has her own plans for Luis, so she seduces him while he is drunk and pretends to be pregnant, so he marries her. Once that problem is settled (she supposedly dies), our two lovers get married and Maria becomes pregnant. When Luis  discovers her talking with his brother, he jealously assumes the worst, so she runs away.

After many trials and tribulations, she has the baby, a little boy, but has lost her mind, so she gives him away to a fruit seller in the barrio, after requesting he be named Luis Fernando (""Nandito"").

Back with Luis (who realizes he had overreacted), she goes on a quest to find that missing baby. He tries to comfort her with an adopted baby girl, ""Tita,"" later played by Ludwika Paleta.

Es la Version 2010 de Maria la del Barrio (Edicion Mexico).
Yo ya tengo la Version Internacional, (Region 1 Estados Unidos) con Subtitulos en Ingles, pero Me Gusto Mucho la Nueva Presentacion y decidi Comprarlo nuevamente.
Sinceramente Desconosco si el Resumen de la Telenovela es otro o es exactamente el mismo que el anterior, como tampoco se si en esta Edicion fue arreglado el Defecto que tenia sobre la musicalizacion de fondo. Ojala asi sea. La verdad es una Exelente Novela, y Me Encanto. Espero que le hayan mejorado eso a esta Edicion y que contenga la Msica Incidental Original.
Lo que si se es que las Fotos son Muy Bonitas, sobre todo las que trae internamente el Dvd, los Discos son Exelentes, de mucho mejor calidad que la version anterior (ya que venian de doble cara), en esta Edicion son 4 Dvds en lugar de 3 y trae impresos a Thalia y a Fernando Colunga en los Discos. Al ser Edicion Mexico/Region 4 No Trae Subtitulos en Ingles, pero de todas formas, aunque no contenga Subtitulos y la Musicalizacion Original, bien vale la pena Coleccionarlo, por la Calidad y el Producto en si mismo.
Cuando lo tenga y vea, les cuento que tal esta y si es igual al otro o no...
8/6/2011: Es Exactamente Igual a la otra Version, solo cambia la Presentacion y el Diseo del Dvd, pero el Resumen es El Mismo.

Nonetheless I managed to make the DVDs work and watch them, until I reached the 3rd DVD whose first side is basically ruined entirely and my computer refused to read it. Hence I couldn't watch the rest of the show. I was not planning on writing this review had the DVDs actually managed to work in the end, but now that there is no way for me to actually watch the rest of the show I think it is quite appropriate that I write this review.

Por otra parte faltan algunas Escenas que estan Muy Buenas de Fernando Colunga en la Mansion de la Vega, en la piscina y demas, que tendrian que estar al comienzo, en el Dvd 1.
Tambien note que falta la parte donde Soraya intenta huir del pais, para no ir a la carcel y es capturada por la Policia.
Otra cosa a destacar es que en muchas Escenas no se entiende el dialogo ya que la musica incidental que pusieron sobre la original hace que no se escuchen bien las voces de los personajes. Y lo que realmente me molesto mucho fue que sacaron muchas partes del Final, cuando Soraya se pelea con Gonzalo por Maria y discuten y se golepan, esa es una de las Mejores Escenas casi sobre el Final, y de cuando Soraya secuestra a Maria le quitan la parte en donde Soraya le confiesa a Maria sus crimenes y maldades. La parte final de la Fiesta de Aniversario esta editada, solo dejan cuando Maria y Luis Fernando salen al balcon y ella le da la noticia de que esta esperando un hijo.

Wanting to relive those moments of my childhood by buying the DVD and watching it caused me only disappointment. Upon watching the first episode, I noticed that some serious editing (cropping) was done to the DVD version. Clearly for timing purposes. That was hard enough to overlook as it is, but then I noticed that the original Score to Maria La Del Barrio was not used. In fact, the DVD version is dubbed with some different musical score over the original score and it all sounds ridiculous. In some scenes you have the original musical score playing, with the DVD score playing even louder on top of that to cover the original score for what I imagine is copyright reasons, and then you have the actors voices that you can hardly make out due to the two musical scores playing on top of each other. The entire DVD set comes off as extremely cheap from the marvel that it once was. It was a serious disappointment for those of us that have seen the GREAT ORIGINAL version of this excellent story. If you can overlook the time editing and horrible dubbing that was done to this DVD set, then perhaps you can enjoy it as much as the rest of us have enjoyed the original.

For those of you who fell in love with this series when it first hit the air waves in 1996 you will be in for quite a shock. This is a butchered version of the original story.

It really makes no sense in releasing these famous Televisa telenovelas if they are not going to be faithful to their original presentation.

The butchering done to these episodes in inexcusable! The storyline makes absolutely no sense now as it jumps to plot point to plot point. It's laughable. Actually it's infuriating.

If you're looking forward to finally having Maria and Zoraya's infamous cat fight inside the opera house parking garage you can forget about it --- it's been cut and is only referred to in a brief flashback! Actually Maria's first sit down dinner with the family is also gone along with a lot of other scenes. UNFORGIVABLE!

Granted we're not talking about ""Gone With the Wind"" here, but still MariMar, Maria La Del Barrio, Maria Mercedes and Rosalinda are four of Thalia's biggest and best in the telenovela genre and have garnered fans on an international level.

It's an injustice that just to make a quick buck these shows are being rushed out on DVD in such a careless fashion.

People who have never seen these shows to begin with are going to think this is what was originally aired on television. It is not. Not by a long shot.

Televisa needs to get their act together and release these shows in their COMPLETE, UNEDITED ORIGINAL VERSIONS or just quit scamming loyal fans with this inferior product.",1212796800,51,1624,4.618055555555555

I understand that the cinemetography would be on the more amateur side, since this is an older novela and a soap opera after all, but this seemed like something more.
I looked up video clips of the show on youtube, and to my dismay, the clips of the same scenes on my dvd had several minutes more to them than on my dvd. Who ever edited this disc hacked away at all the important parts that link this into a coherent story. Please, someone come out with the real show!!! This is ridiculous!
So, yes to Maria la del Barrio, NO NO NO TO THIS EDITION! AGHHHH!",1211155200,19,862,4.39375
3236849,4,B000XFVINU,Get ready for another adventure!!! Maria la del Barrio is out on DVD and that is FANTASTIC!!  I am a HUGE Fernando Colunga fan and this is one of his first novelas!!  Though he doesn't look as HOT as in ALBORADA or the new novela PASION he is still EYE CANDY!!! Thalia is once again the weeping victim but she is still good!!  Itati Cantoral does give a great performance and her crying is just HISTERICAL!!  My recommendation is that TRUE novela fans WILL purchase this novela!!,1206316800,,479,4.471264367816092
3236850,2,B000XFVINU,"This DVD pack has a good video quality, and it has the main theme (""Mara la del Barrio"", by Thala), but I don't know who made this horrible edition. They just cut important scenes from de story. If you didn't see the soap opera on television, it will be difficult for you to understand, because everything happens so fast.

And that's not the worst thing. They tried to replace the original score. I can't explain why!. It's so difficult to believe that Televisa can't pay for the rights of the music. You can't understand many of the dialogues because of that. It's like a noise.

If you like this soap opera, just don't buy this item. I'm a fan of Thala, and now I know why she never says anything about this DVD's. They are not a good product. I give two stars to it because of the song, the video quality, and the DVD cover.",1205452800,5,828,4.301282051282051
3236851,4,B000XFVINU,"This was a great show and I can now understand what is going on because of the subtitles. However...there are scenes (or episodes) missing from the original series. The catfight in the opera parking garage is only seen briefly in a flashback. And where is the scene of Maria's first dinner with the family?
It's a riveting show!",1205107200,,328,4.672413793103448
3236852,3,B000XFVINU,"About halfway through (maybe a bit after when Maria is married), this soap is pretty good.  However, the first part when Thalia is supposed to be a 15 yr old girl, is kind of painful.  Her acting really sucks and is very awkward.  However, once she begins the search for her son, the soap becomes addictive.  Overall, I give it 3 stars because it keeps my attention, but I wouldn't go through and watch it again.  I'd have rented it if that were possible.  It's not the most sophisticated program and the characters do lack depth, except for maybe Maria. For example, the relationship between Maria and Luis Fernando is very shallow.  In the beginning, he seems to hate her and then all of a sudden he's in love but you're not sure if he's still faking it or not.  There's really no character development at all.  People are just THRUST into the common soap opera roles.  Like I said, once all the stuff is settled, the soap becomes pretty good about 3 hours or so into the disk.  The beginning really SUCKS.
The kids show Rebelde is actually far better done and the actors are probably better too. But, Thalia's beautiful and has an attractive personality, so I'd recommend watching this at least once.  Try to borrow it from a friend.  Don't buy it.",1203638400,,1251,4.506666666666667
3236853,3,B000XFVINU,"When it aired, this was a great telenovela, everyone watched it. The writer has the Mexican-telenovela formula down to a T: poor girl falls in love with rich guy, rich guy's family hates her, poor girl marries or starts a relationship with rich guy but never forgets her roots (enter a ecelctic variety of comedic characters) and of course the evil people that wants to keep them apart. I have jsut described about 90% of all telenovelas. But, honestly, this was really good. Thal&iacute;a and Fernando Colunga were excellent.",1203033600,,526,4.921348314606742
8228178,4,B000XFVINU,"Un clsico de todos los tiempos que me conmovi intensamente de principio a fin y como el primer da, hoy, 22 aos despus de su transmisin original, insisto en que es la mejor de las Maras y sin duda alguna, una de las mejores telenovelas, que te intriga y entretiene con facilidad.

Una Thala fuerte y entregada, con una gran versatilidad actoril, comprometida con su papel y con la difcil mezcla de sentimientos y emociones que implicaba su personaje. Una Thala, quien con tan slo 24 aos, (en aquel entonces), interpret a Mara, una joven que al inicio debe luchar contra las precariedades de la pobreza y que conforme la historia va avanzando, evoluciona en una una seora de casi 40 aos, quien debe luchar contra el odio de la desquiciada Soraya, los reclamos y reproches de su conciencia por haber regalado a su hijo, aunado a la locura y desesperacin por encontrarlo. Una madre abnegada que debe luchar contra prejuicios, desprecios, retos familiares, acusaciones, infamias y dems. Una mujer que lucha con uas y dientes por lo suyo y quien se enfrenta como una leona a cualquier prueba u obstculo que se le cruz por el camino. Adversidades que la hicieron fuerte y le permitieron cerrar con broche de oro, la inolvidable y majestuosa tercera Mara: Mara la del Barrio.

El tratamiento de sus personajes es sumamente cuidadoso, haciendo que cada uno aporte y equilibre la historia. Esta novela inmortaliz a la inolvidable Soraya, una mujer despiadada, sin escrpulos y con la maldad a flor de piel, odiada y querida por todos. Inclusive algunas crticas aseguran que hasta desplaz al personaje de la propia Thala, razn por la cual, la produccin la trae de vuelta en plena mitad de la historia para que esta siguiera haciendo de las suyas y as logr dejar esa huella trascendental e imborrable en la historia de las villanas de telenovela.

Un guion impresionante muy bien trabajado con un gran tratamiento en sus puntos de giro. Lo aplaudo, porque a pesar de estar cortada, (para poder ser condensada en tres discos dobles), mantiene lgica y coherencia todo el tiempo. Aplaudo tambin a las grandes mentes de escritores y guionistas creativos que le dieron vida a tan magistral trama. Un guion sin inconsistencias que brill en su mejor esplendor en la pantalla.

El nico punto que no fue de mi agrado es que en esta adaptacin a dvd, por no tener los derechos de la msica incidental, se puso otra por encima de la original, lo que causaba que la msica dominara ante los dilogos y en muchas ocasiones no era claro o no se entenda lo que decan los personajes. Televisa debe cuidar ese detalle tan importante en futuras adaptaciones a dvd. Recordemos que la msica mueve e impacta nuestras emociones y que esta juega un papel determinante en la tramsmisin de los sentimientos desde la pantalla, hacia lo ms interno y profundo del pblico televidente. (Es por eso que le doy 4 estrellas, en lugar de 5).

Ovacin de pie para esta historia que se ha quedado grabado en nuestra memoria y corazn como un clsico de telenovela de todos los tiempos que sigue trascendiendo y conquistando a travs del tiempo y de generacin en generacin.

100 puntos...y a mucha honra...!",1491436800,,3149,4.737226277372263
