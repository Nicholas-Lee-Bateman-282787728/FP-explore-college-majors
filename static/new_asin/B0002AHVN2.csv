4522900,2,B0002AHVN2,"When I decided to purchase this DVD, I was looking for something educational that would give very clear advice and suggestions for better sex.  I was drawn to the fact that this is a video for couples, and that the participants were all real life partners. The fact that it is narrated by a psychologist made it sound very legitimate and not cheesy (or so I had hoped).

Well.

Expect a video with 8 sex scenes with rather unattractive people (is that the ""real"" part they were talking about?), in between which a psychologist/cheerleader encourages you to try things like...sex in the kitchen! a quickie! role playing!

And then with those brilliant, innovative, how-did-I-never-think-of-that suggestions, we get to watch the couples humping.  In short, its just low budget porn.  Interspersed are little clips of couples on what looks like the Santa Monica Beach Boardwalk giving their own tips and opinions on subjects like whether or not role play is a good idea. ""I mean, it is good for some people, I guess, but we don't need it.""  Or as one girl said ""You should have a partner with similar interests. That way you can do things that both of you like."" Thankyouforsharing.

If you are looking for real tips and advice, this is just going to be one, big, vague let-down. But if you are afraid to watch creepy porn, then I guess this gives you a chance to watch some basic examples of people having sex. Nothing more.",1261094400,26,1422,4.682730923694779
4522901,5,B0002AHVN2,"I like this video.  The couples are attractive and there is little interruptions from the video creator.  There is a long intro and then segments of the couples um, being romantic.  It did the trick for us and greatly improved our sex life.",1224115200,7,240,4.534883720930233
4522902,3,B0002AHVN2,"I heard about this series of sexual videos on XM radio via the Oprah and Friends network.  The hosts for the show were psychologists with a specialty in sexual problems. As I have gotten older, my interest in sex has waned and my husband's has increased...or so it seems.  I wanted to do something to spark my interest so I can better fulfill my husband's expectations.  Now, I am wondering if the hosts on the program have a vested interest in these videos.  Or maybe it is just me. I was not really impressed with the content.  Supposedly, these videos would treat the subject matter more delicately and the scenes depicted would be between loving, married couples.  The ""performances"" were wooden and very staged.  I saw very little passion displayed.  But, I doubt I would be any better with video cameras stuck in my face while trying to be intimate with my husband. These videos are advertised and sold primarily as sexual-help instructional videos. They did not help me...sorry.",1199836800,20,985,4.78698224852071
4522903,4,B0002AHVN2,"much better than I thought it would be.  my wife tends to like the more subtle approach to sex (like many women) and I thought this DVD would be a nice change from the hardcore stuff I like.  I was surprised to see I too liked it.  we have already bought another DVD from the same company, but have not viewed it yet.  the items are really useful and reinforce things as ""normal"" that my wife had thought were too taboo.  the only thing I wished it had more of: more graphic sex (but that might be getting away from the whole concept of the DVD in the first place).",1199145600,24,565,4.1
4522904,5,B0002AHVN2,"We enjoyed this DVD because the couples seem genuine and romantic but there's no holding back on the sex.  The scenes are very explicit, but it is handled in a loving, affectionate way, not the typical porn approach.  It's both instructive and sexy, and the couples are believable and attractive.  The host, Dr. Patti Britton, is informative and likeable.  Well worth multiple viewings!",1176422400,59,386,5.079365079365079
