8086356,5,B000BGPL16,I haven't seen it because my player won't play DVDR's. That is why I wanted to write this review to warn that this is set actually contains a DVDR and CDR and not a DVD and CD as advertised. This may or may not matter to you.,1493856000,,225,3.8085106382978724
8086357,5,B000BGPL16,Practice is key and a great vocal coach! Maria Muldaur has shared a precious gem for us to gleen from...thank you so much and God Bless you!,1471392000,,140,4.222222222222222
8086358,5,B000BGPL16,Maria really takes time to have us practice techniques to improve our singing style.  I love there is a cd to use in addition to the dvd.  Easy to understand - well done.,1419552000,,170,4.121212121212121
8086359,4,B000BGPL16,"Honestly, I had no idea who this lady was until I researched her online after viewing the video. Initially, I was skeptical because all she mainly does is talk rather than give you straight pointers, but as time progressed I understood what her method was and respected her for it. The video was engaging and Muldaur was very instrumental in helping the student to unleash and allow their inner artistry to shine, and care for their voice. Too often amateur vocalists can get hung up on technique because that is what voice instructors teach them. The thing is to keep it fun and not sound like an alley cat (just joking) or worse, the same way that the artist sings on the record.",1389052800,,681,4.544715447154472
8086360,4,B000BGPL16,"As an amateur singer with some natural talent but an undisiplined voice I was looking for a way to expand my range and become more reliable in the higher register without going to a private tutor.  Maria Muldaur's DVD has done that and much more.  I am very pleased with the improvements in the quality of my voice, with tones being fuller, rounder, and clearer.  I have expanded my range from a low alto to second soprano within a few weeks without strain and I'm continuing to improve with her accompaning practice cd.  The principles in her dvd will work regardless of what genre you are interested in.  Her understated sense of humor keeps you engaged.  There was a little bit of inconsistency toward the end of the excersize cd,(possibly to keep within time constraints) but with the constant practice I am able to fill this in on my piano if I desire.  Thanks Maria Muldaur for a great teaching DVD!",1372291200,2,905,4.583850931677019
