7756093,4,B01G5VEM42,had to give it four stars cause the American voice acting is somewhat bad,1471564800,,73,4.285714285714286
7756094,5,B01G5VEM42,"Gundam Build Fighters is a whole new idea for the world of Gundam. Taking place in our world instead of an alternate future timeline, Gunpla is sweeping the world and hobby shops now utilize special machines that allow players to upload their Gunpla and fight them in a virtual reality world. This allows for Mobile Suit combat without the need of a war to go along with it. The show follows Sei Iori and his quest to find a pilot for his custom Gunpla and compete in the Gundam Battle World Tournament!

This 25 episode series is contained on 3 Blu-ray Discs and looks amazing. Now, it does have an English dub that was actually recorded for the Phillipines broadcast but it's best to ignore it. It's not ""fandub"" bad but it's definitely not typical Gundam dub quality. Otherwise, this is a fun show and has a lot of cameos from just about every Gundam series and many manga MS as well! This is also only the first of three seasons and RightStuf has already announced that season 2 will be out in Spetember!",1470700800,3,1008,4.478260869565218

7756096,5,B01G5VEM42,Really great series. This slightly reminds me of Robotics Notes (which I am a huge fan of). Glad this anime had a full 25 episode season. The dub isn't the greatest (no voices i really recognized from other animes which is very rare for me) but it's not the worst I've ever heard either. Sei is really the only voice I dislike which is unfortunate since he is the main character but it isn't unbearable. Picture quality is excellent on the blu ray. Extremely vibrant colors and very detailed backgrounds. Story itself is pretty straight forward but there are a few mysteries which keep it interesting. Tons of great gunpla battles. The story progresses well and you get a decent amount of background on most characters. Cant wait for the sequel series to come out next. Overall 4.5/5.,1470182400,,784,4.688405797101449
7756097,5,B01G5VEM42,Couldn't put more than 5 stars! This only the 5 star rating. 1 it looks fantastic on blu ray. 2 it is English dubbed! 3 it's a great series for anyone to watch.,1470096000,2,160,3.878787878787879
7756098,4,B01G5VEM42,"Ok, first let me say, i recevied my copy the other day from another source which i won't name, im only reviewing the show itself. i don't know if this is something that rightstuff directly dubbed as thier logo shows up as a logo in the show which ive never seen before, so i was shocked.
I loved this show since i saw the fansub, and i was SUPER excited to find out it was dubbed. I received my copy the other day and started watching it today. Already past the first 2 episodes, that being said, here are my pro's and cons just from the first 2 episodes.

Pros:
The quality of the video for the bluray is awsome. Also, they didn't cram all the episodes onto 2 disc, its spread over 3 disc. The original ost is there, sometimes companies change it.

Heres the cons which is why i gave it 4 stars.
It is dubbed in english which i love. The main problem i have is that the characters voice's sound like a really BAD fandub. It sounds hollowish at times and like they are speaking threw a microphone into the mic. Some of the voices don't quite match the jap character voices, but once again, that could be from the hollow/mic'ish sound effect. If feels like they dubbed it and rushed it to market to make a couple bucks without evening out the voice/ost balance. Sometimes the voices overpower the bgm. If you saw the redub of Cardcaptor sakura, you'll have an idea of what im talking about.
Also, the trailer on the disc for the show is only the jap trailer, an english one would have been nice but not a necessity.
The other little thing i noticed is they used a different voice over for the ""set your gp base"" part of the show. I have no idea why, the original one was in all english and matched it perfectly, the redub sounds a little too robotic.

Hopefully these are issues they will fix in the 2nd season before it gets released. Esp the dubbing equalizer and hollowness. All and all its one of thee best gundam shows out there ive ever seen. I hope there is a 3rd season.",1467590400,,1977,4.252659574468085
8762332,5,B01G5VEM42,"This is not your typical Gundam series but rather a series for fans of Gundam and Gunpla. So many little Easter eggs. It is just a fun series that made me smile non stop. Also,Ramba Ral randomly showing up places and imparting wisdom was hillarious.",1531094400,,249,4.555555555555555
8762333,2,B01G5VEM42,Great series would recommended to anyone who builds their own Gundams. But look out for the Amazon Warehouse places stickers that are really hard to get off.,1513814400,,157,4.851851851851852

8762336,2,B01G5VEM42,Package came right when it said but the case was broken in several places.. dvds are fine but still not happy with damaged case. Especially since it was supposed to be added to a collection,1483574400,,189,4.428571428571429
8762337,5,B01G5VEM42,"Watched the dub, Iori and Fellini's was not great, but the others are not bad. I know this is the Filipino dub. Iori VA just didn't seem like it match him and Fellini's dub the fake Italian accent wasn't helping at all. But nice collection to have if a fan of the series",1477612800,,270,4.113207547169812
8762338,4,B01G5VEM42,"Gundam Build Fighters is the equivalent to combining Gundam with Yu-Gi-Oh!. The show is set on a version of Earth where Gundam is just a popular tv show similar to our own universe and Gundam Modeling is a huge thing. Where the Yu-Gi-Oh comparison comes in is the Gundam Models can be battled on a special holographic table that brings each Gundam Model (or Gunpla as the term used in the show) to life. We meet our main character Sei, a Gundam obsessed middle schooler who can build the best of Gunpla, but doesn't have the skill to control it on the Battle Platform. Then in walks Reji, a mysterious teen that while has no knowledge of Gundam, has the best control over the Gunpla Battle System that Sei idolizes. They then team up to enter in the Gunpla Tournaments to fight the most skilled of fighters from around the world.

 Where the show shines is the depth of Gundam history brought to the mix of models the Fighters use. Everything from the classic Mobile Suit Gundam to Gundam 00 has a place in the series. The best part of the show is seeing the variants the builders made to the existing Mobile Suits and Armors. The main character uses a variant of the Strike Gundam from the SEED series. Another fighter uses an asymetrical Wing Gundam with the colors based upon the Italian flag.  And one is a Teddy Bear themed Acguy suit from the original Mobile Suit Gundam. And the battles are fun and exciting a good portion of the time.

The characters controlling the Gunpla though are actually pretty sterotypical. Sei is the kid who dreams of winning, Reji the one who helps Sei achieve his goal, China the cute but shy girlfriend and more. Some characters are sterotyped to the Gundam series itself.  One character, Yuuki, fulfills the obligatory Gundam staple of being the Char clone, while others are ripped straight from the series like Mr. Ral, an in universe version of Ramba Ral from Mobile Suit Gundam. But again if your a fan of Gundam this can be fun to recognize each reference to the series. In particular note, pay close attention to the Gundam Festival near the end of the series.

Now I originally watched the series subtitled and loved it. I highly recommend watching it this way because the dub on this set is horrible. Sei sounds a little too young, while Reji someone who should be 14 or so sounds like a 30 year old man or so. And then they ham up the sterotypes of other cultures a tad much. Fellini, the Italian fighter gets a tad overplayed.

Overall if your a Gundam fan I would highly recommend the series as long as your looking for fun battles and not so much life or death stakes as the usual series would. It may even be a good introduction to younger fans.",1475107200,2,2695,4.487755102040817
8762339,5,B01G5VEM42,Overall an excellent collection of all the episodes of Gundam Build Fighters. The images are crisp and a lot of the smaller details (such as the cameos in Gunpla Eve) are much easier to spot. Just do yourself a favor  watch with subtitles the English dub just doesn't have the same heart and some of the voices are just ugh.,1473552000,,324,4.4
8762340,5,B01G5VEM42,A lot of fun,1472688000,,12,2.25
8762341,4,B01G5VEM42,"I loved the English subbed version before this came out and maybe that spoiled the Dub for me. But still I think they could have done a better job with it as I stopped watching the dub before the end of the 3rd episode because, by that point I was already skeptical of it, when I heard Ricardo Fellini's ""strong"" Italian accent. This turned one of the shows best characters into some kind of joke and that was it. Now whenever I watch this it while be in Japanese with the English subs. Other than that its still great its just the English dubbing of it could have used a little more to it I feel.",1472688000,,597,4.155172413793103
