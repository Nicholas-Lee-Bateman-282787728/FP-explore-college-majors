8017248,2,B0001WTVXE,"Many of the scenes shown here are out of date! They don't exist any more if you visit Beijing today.  For example, it showed the main transportation mean was bicycle. However, today it is car as you can see on TV.  It also showed many buildings were being destroyed. Today, they have been replaced by new buildings that you won't recognize.

Mostly, the picture quality is good. However, many times, it has short video clips that are grainy, blurry, and washed out.  They look like newsreels filmed in the 70s. I don't why the producer put them there.  It's very disappointing.

This DVD from Globe Trekker/Pilot Guides also has the same problems as another one from the same company, ""Destination China"". These problems are listed below.
The hostess, Megan McCormick, did not speak Mandarin. Consequently, in many scenes she did not understand what the Chinese were saying and vice versa. That's very frustrating because I wanted to know more about the local people and specialty. The producer should have hired an interpreter.

Another bad thing is the information is skin-deep. It`s because each place she visited was covered for 2 minutes or less.

It does not have subtitle either. That makes it very difficult for non-Chinese people like me to learn the names of the cities, markets and shop. I need them in order to visit them later.

In short, this type of DVDs inspires my curiosity but does not satisfy it. It`s worth watching once but not purchasing. Luckily, I borrowed it from the local library.",1329264000,,1508,4.836575875486381

It's a must see before traveling to Beijing.",1179446400,,189,3.8461538461538463
8017250,5,B0001WTVXE,"Having been to Beijing myself, I thought this was a wonderful show covering much of the vast city....many places that I myself visited.  Megan is funny and quirky and the locals really seem to like her.  I've seen a great many shows with her as the host and this has got to be one of her best!  Well done.",1146700800,4,305,4.135593220338983
8017251,3,B0001WTVXE,"The interesting part is Beijing; the frustrating part, Megan. We get way too much of her effort at a star turn. Still, you can come away with some sense of Beijing, if you're able to muster some patience with her.",1135728000,5,213,4.35
8017252,1,B0001WTVXE,"Ms Megan is childish, rude, condescending and immature.  Despite of her efforts to totally ruin this effort, the information and visuals aren't a total loss.  It's a real embarrassment for both cultures.",1127606400,11,203,5.3125
