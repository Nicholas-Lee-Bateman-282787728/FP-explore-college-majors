8190209,2,B000ML8WP2,"If ""Imitation is the deepest form of flattery"" this film should be praised to the heavens. The viewer can almost see the meetings that took place prior to its creation...""What would 'he' have done?...How would 'he' have filmed this?...."" The ""he"", of course, is the master Krzysztof Kieslowski. In the end imitation remains imitation. The acting is O.K., but one feels the actors are indeed ""acting"", which is very troubling. The ""nurse"" (?) who offers the very expensive magic bullet for Stuhr's mother was particularly bad.  Not a film I could recommend.",1227571200,,556,5.043478260869565
