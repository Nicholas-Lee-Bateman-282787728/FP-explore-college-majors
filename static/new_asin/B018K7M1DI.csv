8742585,4,B018K7M1DI,"NON-SPOILER FIRST: NOBODY DIES! (Not even Maggie Smith, ...although even by my calculations her character would have to be at least 110-ish by this time! So if you were one of those who beat their breasts in dire lamentation over the demise (and writing out) of Matthew, rest assured you can put away the handkerchiefs this time and venture into this last episode safe in the knowledge that everybody survives..
There IS a dire prognosis for one character, but of course a second opinion even grants him a reprieve so he too can enjoy matrimonial bliss like just about everybody else in the cast....with but ONE notable exception.

Now if like me you have become accustomed to the usual snail's pace with which the narrative of Downton Abbey has progressed previously, your head will absolutely spin in this the FINAL episode.
Storylines are tied off with all the rapidity of bullets bursting from a Gatling Gun, in a what can only be described as something of a new-found unseemly rush!
Sadly for any expected originality in script writing, these denouements invariable consist of either one of two ways.
Matrimony, (or the strong suggestion that matrimony will soon occur) ...or a baby.
Sometimes a combination of the two.
So many couples were either tying the knot, or made out to be about to do so that I thought Downton Abbey must have opened a jewellery concession in the foyer specialising in wedding or engagement rings.

That's the ending for just about everybody that is, ...with the single exception of poor old Thomas.
(Can't have those gays ending up ""happily ever after"" like us good straight folks now, can we!)

He's fobbed off with a new job prospect and a sort of half-hearted ""apology"" from the perennial grumpy and by now shaky Carson, ...who has been particularly nasty to Thomas of late.
Would it have hurt anyone for Thomas to at least have received a sideways look from say a gardener or a footman that perhaps lingered just long enough to suggest some happiness for him too might perhaps be in the future?

The marriage/baby bit is really over-used for everybody else.
ALL the people who didn't like each other, or for some reason were unable or reluctant to wed, get hitched up here so rapidly you'd be forgiven for thinking you were in one of those Las Vegas all-night wedding chapels!
Prior objections from other parties are dismissed very easily or just evaporate conveniently!
Even the downstairs staff are all in the marrying-mood.

The costumes are still magnificent, ...but it was a bit odd to see Lady Edith get married in WHITE DRESS and FULL VEIL despite just about everybody now knowing she's had a child?
I thought they were quite strict about that sort of convention back then? People will talk!

Key laugh moment?
Watching poker faced Lady Mary Rigor-Mortis look down at the carpet in her bedroom, then up at maid Anna and utter the immortal line, completely devoid of any emotion at all ....Oh, your waters have broken....  Priceless!
The baby is even immediately delivered in Lady Marys own bed! The times they are a-changin!

The rest is paint by numbers,....Bates still haunts the shadows in the corridors, but is never seen doing anything at all. You doubt he was even on the set most of the time.  Daisy, Mrs Patmore etc. are all involved in those aforementioned hints of imminent matrimony....the latters venture of a B&B not even mentioned at all....nor Daisys use of her recently acquired education.
Just marry em all off!

Although we see a Christmas tree in the foyer of Downton, ...that particular celebration is skipped in favour of New Year, when all the newly-weds, the newly-weds to be, the new babies and the impending babies, ....and the short-changed still partner-less Thomas all gather for the Hallmark Greeting Card Finale....which is of course delivered right on queue...The End.

Frankly I did enjoy something actually happening for once, despite the apparent sudden adoption of a break-neck pace, however I am also more than a little glad this long journey has finally come to an end.
No doubt Downton Abbey will be remembered more for the incredibly lush production values, those costumes, cars, settings and landscapes rather than the storyline.",1454544000,5,4212,4.88515406162465
