8579914,4,B00CBKKVPQ,"We saw Dwight Slade on a cruise comedy show and enjoyed his show.  We thought he was joking when he said he had DVD's for sale, but we looked it up here when we got home and were happy to find it wasn't a joke! : )  This is pretty much the same routine (Right) that we saw on the ship, but it's nice to have it on DVD for future laughs.  The Raunch DVD is also funny, but is definitely NOT meant to be family-friendly, and might've been from his adult-only show.  Nice to have the option not to keep that one in the DVD case, they were separate DVD's and I want the family-friendly DVD to be available to my daughter.",1426118400,,617,3.991869918699187
