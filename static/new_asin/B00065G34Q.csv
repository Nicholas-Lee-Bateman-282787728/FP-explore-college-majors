8469437,1,B00065G34Q,"If I could give this zero stars, I would.  I rarely post reviews of products, but this one is so bad, I had to.  I have been playing golf for 17 years.  I currently play about 2 rounds per week, and practice at least one other day.  In other words - I take golf pretty seriously.  I recognized that my putting was suffering and sought out this DVD.  I was really amazed and just how bad this DVD was.  Basically all Dave Stockton says is that you need to forward press with your hands and you need to find your ""signature stroke"".  That's it.  I just saved you from buying this DVD. I passed it around to a couple of my other golfing buddies and they were also amazed.  I emailed Dave Stockton through his website and expressed my disappointment.  They offered to refund my money.  I like Dave Stockton - he is indeed a good instructor, but this video was nothing other than something to put his name on and make some money.  Absolutely the worst instructional material (book or video) I have EVER seen.",1349568000,5,1003,4.327956989247312
