8139591,4,B000HEWENK,"Have you ever wished that comic-book characters could be a part of reality? If you consider yourself a somewhat adventurous movie-goer and have little trouble with subtitles, ""Who Wants to Kill Jessie?"" could be a film feast for your eyes. This combination sci-fi fantasy film is light in scientific technicalities and hip-deep in kooky action. A scientist's new invention runs amok, leading to multiple duels and disasters. It's a lesson in why wives shouldn't mess with their husbands' fantasies...a lesson in why scientists shouldn't mess with nature...and a lesson in how a professor's imagination could be enriched by reading comic books. Some of the action sequences are poorly choreographed, but it's a small price to pay for a unique little film that entertains as well as unleashes the ""what ifs?"" as all good sci-fi should. (3.5 stars)",1427932800,,845,5.175182481751825
8139592,5,B000HEWENK,"I first learned of this movie when I read about it in John Brosnan's 1978 book ""Future Tense; the Cinema of Science Fiction,"" and chalked it up as being another intriguing foreign film that I'd likely never see. I then forgot all about it for 35 years until I reread Brosnan's book last fall, rekindling my interest. Now in the age of home video and the internet, I was happy to find that ""Who Wants to Kill Jessie?"" is available on DVD and I could finally check it out.
It was well worth the wait! What an off-beat, totally delightful film. I could accurately describe it as feeling like a cross between ""The Cabinet of Dr, Caligari"", ""Modesty Blaise"" and ""The Dreams of a Rarebit Fiend""...as realized by Mack Sennett and Salvador Dali, and this still wouldn't prepare you for what this delightful flight of fantasy has to offer. If you like fantasy, sci-fi, comics, madcap antics and beautiful women (star Olga Schoberova is one of the most beautiful women to ever stand in front of a camera), then you should give this a try. I guarantee ""Who Wants to Kill Jessie?"" is like nothing else that you've ever scene..",1425945600,,1114,4.575
8139593,5,B000HEWENK,"Don't expect a load of special features here. Just a cleverly subversive film rife with the type of wild tropes populating mid-twentieth century popular culture. Mad scientists, cowboys, superheroes and damsels in dire peril are ably sent up in ""Who Wants to Kill Jessie?"", a fast-moving cartoon come to life that will dare you to miss its underlying message while delivering the laughs. Olga Schoberov is the beautiful heroine of the piece and supremely watchable throughout.",1379548800,,476,5.276315789473684
8139594,5,B000HEWENK,"If ever there were a film formed for a category called fun, ""Who Wants To Kill Jessie?"" would be found there.
Having never seen a proper Czech New Wave picture, I wasn't altogether certain what I would find.  What I found was hilarity, satire, science fiction, and comic book frolic and frivolity!
Mixing science fiction with comic books, a Lil Abner's Daisy Mae prototype, a villainous Superman, an awkward looking desperado, jazz music and all the stuff that dreams are made of, you are left with a cinematic confection with an unusual but refreshing taste.
If you are like me, and I know I sure am, you will find your self fond of this fine foreign film, particularly on Thursdays.",1374710400,,684,4.7
8139595,5,B000HEWENK,"Thanks to Facets video for making so many great Eastern European movies available. Though not souped up like Criterion, who cares. These films wouldn't be seen in the U.S. without Facets and nearly all of them are well respected, though not well known. Jessie is as offbeat as it gets, done by people who for a short time could get away with just about anything (no over controling government or studio). The results are inspired. And if you see  just one Olga Schoberova movie in your life, it probably should be this one.",1183161600,5,523,4.623655913978495
