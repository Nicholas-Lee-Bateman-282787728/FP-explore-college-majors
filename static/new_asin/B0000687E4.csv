7963704,5,B0000687E4,"Perfect example of that parallel universe known as the Golden Age of Mexican Cinema. Great fun with attractive performers, rhuma dancing, mambo music and twisty mega-melodramatic plot of unwed Mom in tropical port town. Fans of Hollywoods ""women's pictures"" with eat this with a spoon ! Decent print with good blacks and white. Superior in every way to the similar Kit Parker release of ""La Bien Pagada"" (which has a soft, washed out picture, and is a bit of a stiff compared to this one). Al rato !",1034640000,7,499,4.681818181818182
