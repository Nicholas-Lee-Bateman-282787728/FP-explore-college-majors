3147732,3,B0015XHQVW,Bill (Aaron Eckhart) hates his life and is stuck in a self loathing state he can't get out of until he meets a young kid who reintroduces him to life and reinvigorates him. It is a story we have already seen and heard a million times but the cast really makes this one worth watching. His wife (Elizabeth Banks) is a daddy's girl who is sleeping with the local newsman (Timothy Olyphant). Bill knows this but is helpless to do anything since his wife is responsible for everything in his life including his job and all his assets. He dreams of opening his own donut franchise but can't find any backing either from his father in law or his unsupportive wife. While at a local school where his father in law has just made a sizeable donation he meets a young kid that he eventually mentors. It is the kid who ends up teaching him a few things along the way. One of the first things he teaches Bill is that he needs to find a new chick to make the old one jealous. Bill doesn't know anyone so the kid provides the babe a lingerie saleswoman (Jessica Alba) that the kid has a crush on. She doesn't think Bill can be helped but plays along since she is being paid. After a few stints in jail for beating the newsman  Bill is kicked out of his house and forced to live with his brother whose shadow Bill has been living under for years. Everyone loves his brother but few know that he is gay. It is his partner along with the kid that try and get Bill to start caring about himself again by getting him to work out and change his look and wardrobe. They all conspire to help him open his donut franchise and get his wife back. Alba poses as his wife in order to appear more legit to the heads of the donut franchise (SNL's Kristin Wiig and Jason Sudeikis) and as that dream starts to become a reality other things fall into place for Bill. His wife seems willing to give him a second chance but grows jealous when she sees him with the sexy younger girl. Sure it is predictable and unoriginal but it's funny and sweet. The cast is exceptional with Eckhart nailing the role of the self loathing and sarcastic Bill and Banks is fantastic as the ditzy blonde wife who is sleeping with the newsman  because she is embarrassed by Bill and his simple life. Alba is a no brainer as the sexy new girl and is pretty good in her role. It was a film that was in and out of theaters quickly but is pretty entertaining on DVD for fans of any of the three leads.,1231718400,,2443,4.217948717948718

3147737,2,B0015XHQVW,"In `Meet Bill' Aaron Eckhart once again expands his career repertoire with a role we're accustomed to seeing Steve Carell play.  As partial as I am to both actors, it's refreshing to see him play the fumbling underdog, closer to Carell's performance in `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dan-in-Real-Life/dp/B00118T632/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dan in Real Life</a>'.  Too bad this sitcom worthy movie has little else to commend it. There are original, quirky elements, but the screwball execution is spotty for laughs and disjointed in parts.

Bill is in a middle-aged rut.  Dependent on his wife Jess (Elizabeth Banks), he works as head of human relations at his father-in-law's bank.  Jess looks healthy.  She wears workout apparel and continually tries to prod Bill to adhere to his doctor's diet, one that eschews his coveted donut fix.  At work he is like a dog on a leash.  Not thrilled to begin with working under his father-in-law, Bill hates it when he's proposed to join their mentor program.  He meets ""the kid"" (Logan Lerman) he's supposed to mentor in the bathroom, where Bill helps him hide the marijuana he flushes down the toilet before his school liaison catches him.  Next, not only does he have to mentor ""the kid,"" he has to go duck hunting with his in-laws and their sponsored teens.  Being an animal lover, he becomes an awful shot, but provides some of the best laughs of the movie.

Getting chubby, the hubby suspects Jess is having an affair.  Planting a camera beneath a translucent hat, he catches her in adultery with a local news reporter, Chip Johnson (Timothy Olyphant).  Things go from bad to worse as Bill goes after Chip and the media gets a hold of the infidelity caught on tape.  With nowhere to live, Bill turns to his gay brother, Sargeant (Craig Bierko*), a sporting goods store owner, and his partner Paul (Reed Diamond) to stay.  A fitness buff, Paul tries to turn Bill's life around.

Bill wants to stay in his marriage while getting out of the bank.  Jess hates the surveillance and doesn't say it, but Bill's slob appearance is indicative of his care for her as well.  Forming a friendship ""the kid"" warms up to Bill before he can reciprocate.  His friend and love interest, Lucy (Jessica Alba) seems much more mature than he, but she is a great resource for Bill.  Both of them take an interest in getting Bill and Jess back together.

Although I don't condone illegal drug use, I have to admit it's a clever twist to have the mentor corrupted by his young apprentice.  Eckhart plays a stoner scene like a pro as he and ""the kid"" go rock climbing in his brother's sports' store, easily one of the funniest scenes in the movie.

For all the oddball factors, 'Meet Bill' won't ruin your evening, but it won't provide the most compelling comedy, either.

(If 'Meet Bill' and 'The Forty Year Old Virgin' are any indication, most women don't favor men's body hair.  So much for the old days when a hairy chest seemed to be coveted.)

3147738,4,B0015XHQVW,"Aaron Eckhart has been one of my favorite actors for years, he continually flies under the mainstream radar but makes every movie he is in, believable.

The first time directors (Bernie/Melissa) tackled a familiar topic in the mid-life crisis film, but since they had AE to carry it, everything came across beautifully. AE plays our married man Bill, as he unhappily fills an undeserved in-law position at a bank. His wife is played by Liz Banks, who I love from Scrubs, that helps lead an amazing supporting cast, including Timothy Olyphant (Deadwood), Jessica Alba, and Logan Lerman (3:10 to Yuma).

The story centers on Bill going through the motions of discovering marital infidelity, becoming a mentor for a smarter than his age school kid, while coming to terms with finding himself through some unorthodox avenues. Jessica Alba finally found a role that she was obviously relaxed with. Her entire presence was believable and she didn't have to wear a swimsuit, a tight blue suit or act scared - to do it. She does not play the love-interest as advertised, she just fills a role of helping out a new friend. I hope she does more films like this. Tim Olyphant has proven himself repeatedly, and I think even these slightly corny roles don't diminish his ability to be the hated character, yet still fun to watch.

This film will not appeal to the teens or older crowds, but probably along the same customer lines as Thank You for Smoking, another great Eckhart film. Good for a low-key movie night for that guy that might be in that similar ""mid-life"" stage. The laugh out loud moments and open ending make for a believable self-discovery film.

On this DVD release - the deleted scenes were all they included. No other ANYTHING to speak of, except for lots of additional First Look Studio previews, was disappointed on that.",1215734400,6,1830,4.8

3147752,3,B0015XHQVW,"Solid performances by Aaron Eckhart and Elizabeth Banks.  The story is quirky and the ending unpredictable, which is rare in Hollywood, but the main characters aren't all that likeable, so it's hard to really engage with the movie. Aaron Eckhart plays Bill as a schlub having a mid-life crisis, but we don't ever really understand how he got there...or why Elizabeth Banks married him in the first place.  Other characters are stock, predictable and instantly forgettable, as are the performances.

The writing is spotty, sometimes approaching reality and other times not quite hitting the mark.  For example, Bill's character gets high and drinks with the underage (HS Senior) student he is mentoring.  Even a loser like Bill would have second thoughts about that, but it doesn't seem to even register with Bill.  On the other hand, the scenes in which Bill melt-downs seem fairly true-to-life.

All in all, it's not a BAD movie.  I've spent almost two hours watching worse things.  If you like the premise, see ""Extract"" with Jason Bateman.  It's funnier and the writing is better.",1373155200,,1083,5.033707865168539

3147776,3,B0015XHQVW,"We've seen movies like this before. The Schlub somehow finds his/her way out of the doldrums to at least the promise of a better life. There is little, if anything, new in this version.

Here's the scoop. Aaron Eckhart is married to Elizabeth Banks. He works for her dad at the family bank. He has a vague title with no real responsibility. Right at the time he begins to mentor a cocky high-schooler, his wife begins an affair with a local news personality. He's now at a crossroads. Which way will he go?

I like these actors. Aaron, Elizabeth, Timothy Olyphant, Jessica ALba (she's so-so) so I wanted to like this movie, but it made it nearly impossible for me to do so. If Eckhart is such a doormat, how is it he's married to such a hottie like Banks? If he wasn't always so, how did he get like that? Those questions are only lightly touched on. Most of the situations are forced, and when you got there, they weren't played well. The pot smoking scene, the fireworks buying scene, the girls in the tent scene simply didn't ring true. Eckhart plays a genuinely decent guy and here he is contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Sorry. Didn't buy it. There were so few scenes that were believable it surprised me to see Eckhart's name as one of the producers. He's been around the block a few times and should have seen the lameness of the whole thing. The entire situation is set up in the first five or ten minutes, so the viewer knows what has to happen. It all hinges on HOW it happens, and this story took nearly every wrong turn it could take.

This seems to have been a favorite with many viewers but I'm not on board.",1342569600,,1632,4.3618421052631575
3147777,1,B0015XHQVW,IMDB says: 140 Uses of F***. Really? We didn't even watch the film. Hollywood keeps putting out trashy films and these get exported worldwide. It is no wonder so many people are disgusted with our country.,1335830400,,205,4.722222222222222

3147800,2,B0015XHQVW,"This movie is clearly missing a beat.  It tries to move slow and real and then degenerates into high school level humor too often. (Funny how all the high school kids in the movie celebrate the weak points...)  It's not a particularly good movie.  It tries hard to have that Euro simple minimalist feel to it but American directors that try to do this are basically always missing a beat.  It's a high school play at best.  The fireworks gimmick is pretty inane.  Yes, it moves along like an extended Saturday Night Live skit.  The attempts at profound observations are well, silly and predictable.  Okay, let's call it like it is:  Another American waste of a movie.  It says much about the movie that the best performance is by Jessica Alba.  Don't pay to watch this movie.

3147804,3,B0015XHQVW,"I don't normally write movie reviews but the other reviews seem to be so off the mark that I feel I need to.

The basic story is that Bill is a guy living off his father-in-law's largess and is going nowhere.  Aaron Eckhart plays him as a real slob and is generally an unappealing character throughout the film.

The two most interesting actors in the film and who make this film worth watching are Logan Lerman (as The Kid), a 14 year old student who is mentoring with Bill but who reverses the mentorship and basically shows Bill how have to fun again.  Lerman plays the part exceedingly well, is tremendously believable and is consistently funny and a joy to watch.  (For some reason, Lerman gets almost no billing in spite of the fact that he has the second largest part in the movie after Bill.)  The other interesting actor is Jessica Alba who is simply beautiful and whose scenes with Lerman are a delight.

Logan Lerman is clearly an actor to watch and I strongly suspect he's the next Shia LeBeouf.  I just hope he doesn't get dragged into those action thrillers that require very little acting as have many of our good actors (like Shia).",1273795200,,1148,4.51207729468599

The major character, Bill, is a loser, and there is no reason to think that he would have ever been married into a successful family with a pretty wife. However Bill does have the insight that he is a loser and makes some effort to reform himself, but at the end of the movie when he decides to quit his marriage, quit his job, quit/ abandon his plans to run a donut shop to give him some income and self-respect, he seems headed to a even worse future since he wouldn't even be up to fast food employee standards.

A confession: I looked at this movie exclusively because of Jessica Alba's presence in it as eye candy.  Jessica was fresh and alluring as always, and had the good sense not to let her character be exploited such as to lose her dignity.

Otherwise, this is a throughly forgetable film.",1262476800,3,1047,4.321428571428571

Bill is in the midst of a full-blown midlife crisis.  Not only is he stuck in a job he hates (a made-up position at his father-in-law's bank), but his wife is cheating on him with a local news reporter.  Meanwhile, his potbelly seems to be expanding at an increasingly alarming rate, a condition brought on by the massive quantities of donuts and candy bars he consumes daily out of nervousness and force of habit.  Bill can't seem to step out of the shadows of either his wife's dad or the brother whom everyone seems to think is brighter, more financially successful and more all-around ""together"" than Bill is.  In fact, the one hope Bill has of turning his life around may well rest with an Alex Keating-type prep school student he`s agreed to mentor as part of a program for entrepreneurial teens.

Written and directed by Bernie Goldman and Melisa Walick, ""Meet Bill"" ranges from the hilarious to the mildly amusing - with just enough dull patches thrown in to keep us from raving too much over its virtues or letting it too much into our hearts.  The screenplay is frequently sharp in its comic portrayal of middle-aged angst, but it also feels vaguely rudderless, undernourished and underdeveloped for much of the time.

The real joy of the film lies in Aaron Eckhart's star turn as a man whose career and personal relationships clearly aren't what he'd hoped they'd be at this particular point in his life.  He's nicely supported by Elizabeth Banks as his philandering wife; Logan Lerman as his preppie protg; Jessica Alba as a lingerie salesgirl; Reed Diamond as his overly competitive gay brother-in-law; and SNL stars Kristen Wiig and Jason Sudeikis as donut-shop franchise owners who hope to go into business with Bill.

And speaking of the entrepreneurial spirit, a veritable goldmine awaits anyone savvy enough to market that amazing belly-busting weight-loss program Bill uses to great effect towards the end of the film.",1257638400,,1945,4.8844984802431615

I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the movie through, and have now seen it several times because I liked it so much.

Aaron Eckhart plays, basically, a very accurate depiction of a disgruntled male: his marriage is going down the tubes, he hates his job, has no idea how to have fun, and has no idea where he wants to be in life, yet knows he wants something more, something better. Throughout the movie, we learn about the tough situations in his life and how he deals with them (i.e. cheating wife, in-laws that only care about themselves), and feel badly for him, because his life just sucks.

Then, our main character undergoes a sort of personality transformation: he stands up for himself, finally, and acts out against the man that his wife is cheating with, gets himself involved in a program to assist high school students with banking and during this, meets an outgoing student that helps him come out of his shell and learn how to have fun and not take any trash from anybody. Along the way, Eckhart continuously does a great job of acting the role of a nice guy that realizes it is time he put himself first, for the first time in his life, and go out to get what makes him happy. Plenty of drama and chaos ensues, all of which is very realistic and does not ever feel overblown or too coincidental to actually happen to a real person.

The supporting cast includes Elizabeth Banks and Jessica Alba, both of whom perform well for the roles they were given. I have to say that this movie has quickly made its way into my Top 10, and this movie is definitely worth the money.",1238889600,2,1734,4.460567823343848

Bill doesn't know anyone so the kid provides the babe a lingerie saleswoman (Jessica Alba) that the kid has a crush on. She doesn't think Bill can be helped but plays along since she is being paid. After a few stints in jail for beating the newsman  Bill is kicked out of his house and forced to live with his brother whose shadow Bill has been living under for years. Everyone loves his brother but few know that he is gay. It is his partner along with the kid that try and get Bill to start caring about himself again by getting him to work out and change his look and wardrobe. They all conspire to help him open his donut franchise and get his wife back. Alba poses as his wife in order to appear more legit to the heads of the donut franchise (SNL's Kristin Wiig and Jason Sudeikis) and as that dream starts to become a reality other things fall into place for Bill. His wife seems willing to give him a second chance but grows jealous when she sees him with the sexy younger girl. Sure it is predictable and unoriginal but it's funny and sweet. The cast is exceptional with Eckhart nailing the role of the self loathing and sarcastic Bill and Banks is fantastic as the ditzy blonde wife who is sleeping with the newsman  because she is embarrassed by Bill and his simple life. Alba is a no brainer as the sexy new girl and is pretty good in her role.

3382234,2,B0015XHQVW,"In `Meet Bill' Aaron Eckhart once again expands his career repertoire with a role we're accustomed to seeing Steve Carell play.  As partial as I am to both actors, it's refreshing to see him play the fumbling underdog, closer to Carell's performance in `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dan-in-Real-Life/dp/B00118T632/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dan in Real Life</a>'.  Too bad this sitcom worthy movie has little else to commend it. There are original, quirky elements, but the screwball execution is spotty for laughs and disjointed in parts.

Bill is in a middle-aged rut.  Dependent on his wife Jess (Elizabeth Banks), he works as head of human relations at his father-in-law's bank.  Jess looks healthy.  She wears workout apparel and continually tries to prod Bill to adhere to his doctor's diet, one that eschews his coveted donut fix.  At work he is like a dog on a leash.  Not thrilled to begin with working under his father-in-law, Bill hates it when he's proposed to join their mentor program.  He meets ""the kid"" (Logan Lerman) he's supposed to mentor in the bathroom, where Bill helps him hide the marijuana he flushes down the toilet before his school liaison catches him.  Next, not only does he have to mentor ""the kid,"" he has to go duck hunting with his in-laws and their sponsored teens.  Being an animal lover, he becomes an awful shot, but provides some of the best laughs of the movie.

Getting chubby, the hubby suspects Jess is having an affair.  Planting a camera beneath a translucent hat, he catches her in adultery with a local news reporter, Chip Johnson (Timothy Olyphant).  Things go from bad to worse as Bill goes after Chip and the media gets a hold of the infidelity caught on tape.  With nowhere to live, Bill turns to his gay brother, Sargeant (Craig Bierko*), a sporting goods store owner, and his partner Paul (Reed Diamond) to stay.  A fitness buff, Paul tries to turn Bill's life around.

Bill wants to stay in his marriage while getting out of the bank.  Jess hates the surveillance and doesn't say it, but Bill's slob appearance is indicative of his care for her as well.  Forming a friendship ""the kid"" warms up to Bill before he can reciprocate.  His friend and love interest, Lucy (Jessica Alba) seems much more mature than he, but she is a great resource for Bill.  Both of them take an interest in getting Bill and Jess back together.

Although I don't condone illegal drug use, I have to admit it's a clever twist to have the mentor corrupted by his young apprentice.  Eckhart plays a stoner scene like a pro as he and ""the kid"" go rock climbing in his brother's sports' store, easily one of the funniest scenes in the movie.

For all the oddball factors, 'Meet Bill' won't ruin your evening, but it won't provide the most compelling comedy, either.

(If 'Meet Bill' and 'The Forty Year Old Virgin' are any indication, most women don't favor men's body hair.  So much for the old days when a hairy chest seemed to be coveted.)

3382235,4,B0015XHQVW,"Aaron Eckhart has been one of my favorite actors for years, he continually flies under the mainstream radar but makes every movie he is in, believable.

The first time directors (Bernie/Melissa) tackled a familiar topic in the mid-life crisis film, but since they had AE to carry it, everything came across beautifully. AE plays our married man Bill, as he unhappily fills an undeserved in-law position at a bank. His wife is played by Liz Banks, who I love from Scrubs, that helps lead an amazing supporting cast, including Timothy Olyphant (Deadwood), Jessica Alba, and Logan Lerman (3:10 to Yuma).

The story centers on Bill going through the motions of discovering marital infidelity, becoming a mentor for a smarter than his age school kid, while coming to terms with finding himself through some unorthodox avenues. Jessica Alba finally found a role that she was obviously relaxed with. Her entire presence was believable and she didn't have to wear a swimsuit, a tight blue suit or act scared - to do it. She does not play the love-interest as advertised, she just fills a role of helping out a new friend. I hope she does more films like this. Tim Olyphant has proven himself repeatedly, and I think even these slightly corny roles don't diminish his ability to be the hated character, yet still fun to watch.

This film will not appeal to the teens or older crowds, but probably along the same customer lines as Thank You for Smoking, another great Eckhart film. Good for a low-key movie night for that guy that might be in that similar ""mid-life"" stage. The laugh out loud moments and open ending make for a believable self-discovery film.

3382249,3,B0015XHQVW,"Solid performances by Aaron Eckhart and Elizabeth Banks.  The story is quirky and the ending unpredictable, which is rare in Hollywood, but the main characters aren't all that likeable, so it's hard to really engage with the movie. Aaron Eckhart plays Bill as a schlub having a mid-life crisis, but we don't ever really understand how he got there...or why Elizabeth Banks married him in the first place.  Other characters are stock, predictable and instantly forgettable, as are the performances.

The writing is spotty, sometimes approaching reality and other times not quite hitting the mark.  For example, Bill's character gets high and drinks with the underage (HS Senior) student he is mentoring.  Even a loser like Bill would have second thoughts about that, but it doesn't seem to even register with Bill.  On the other hand, the scenes in which Bill melt-downs seem fairly true-to-life.

3382273,3,B0015XHQVW,"We've seen movies like this before. The Schlub somehow finds his/her way out of the doldrums to at least the promise of a better life. There is little, if anything, new in this version.

Here's the scoop. Aaron Eckhart is married to Elizabeth Banks. He works for her dad at the family bank. He has a vague title with no real responsibility. Right at the time he begins to mentor a cocky high-schooler, his wife begins an affair with a local news personality. He's now at a crossroads. Which way will he go?

I like these actors. Aaron, Elizabeth, Timothy Olyphant, Jessica ALba (she's so-so) so I wanted to like this movie, but it made it nearly impossible for me to do so. If Eckhart is such a doormat, how is it he's married to such a hottie like Banks? If he wasn't always so, how did he get like that? Those questions are only lightly touched on. Most of the situations are forced, and when you got there, they weren't played well. The pot smoking scene, the fireworks buying scene, the girls in the tent scene simply didn't ring true. Eckhart plays a genuinely decent guy and here he is contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Sorry. Didn't buy it. There were so few scenes that were believable it surprised me to see Eckhart's name as one of the producers. He's been around the block a few times and should have seen the lameness of the whole thing. The entire situation is set up in the first five or ten minutes, so the viewer knows what has to happen. It all hinges on HOW it happens, and this story took nearly every wrong turn it could take.

It tries hard to have that Euro simple minimalist feel to it but American directors that try to do this are basically always missing a beat.  It's a high school play at best.  The fireworks gimmick is pretty inane.  Yes, it moves along like an extended Saturday Night Live skit.  The attempts at profound observations are well, silly and predictable.  Okay, let's call it like it is:  Another American waste of a movie.  It says much about the movie that the best performance is by Jessica Alba.  Don't pay to watch this movie.

The basic story is that Bill is a guy living off his father-in-law's largess and is going nowhere.  Aaron Eckhart plays him as a real slob and is generally an unappealing character throughout the film.

The two most interesting actors in the film and who make this film worth watching are Logan Lerman (as The Kid), a 14 year old student who is mentoring with Bill but who reverses the mentorship and basically shows Bill how have to fun again.  Lerman plays the part exceedingly well, is tremendously believable and is consistently funny and a joy to watch.  (For some reason, Lerman gets almost no billing in spite of the fact that he has the second largest part in the movie after Bill.)  The other interesting actor is Jessica Alba who is simply beautiful and whose scenes with Lerman are a delight.

Logan Lerman is clearly an actor to watch and I strongly suspect he's the next Shia LeBeouf.  I just hope he doesn't get dragged into those action thrillers that require very little acting as have many of our good actors (like Shia).",1273795200,,1148,4.51207729468599

The major character, Bill, is a loser, and there is no reason to think that he would have ever been married into a successful family with a pretty wife. However Bill does have the insight that he is a loser and makes some effort to reform himself, but at the end of the movie when he decides to quit his marriage, quit his job, quit/ abandon his plans to run a donut shop to give him some income and self-respect, he seems headed to a even worse future since he wouldn't even be up to fast food employee standards.

A confession: I looked at this movie exclusively because of Jessica Alba's presence in it as eye candy.  Jessica was fresh and alluring as always, and had the good sense not to let her character be exploited such as to lose her dignity.

Otherwise, this is a throughly forgetable film.",1262476800,3,1047,4.321428571428571

Bill is in the midst of a full-blown midlife crisis.  Not only is he stuck in a job he hates (a made-up position at his father-in-law's bank), but his wife is cheating on him with a local news reporter.  Meanwhile, his potbelly seems to be expanding at an increasingly alarming rate, a condition brought on by the massive quantities of donuts and candy bars he consumes daily out of nervousness and force of habit.  Bill can't seem to step out of the shadows of either his wife's dad or the brother whom everyone seems to think is brighter, more financially successful and more all-around ""together"" than Bill is.  In fact, the one hope Bill has of turning his life around may well rest with an Alex Keating-type prep school student he`s agreed to mentor as part of a program for entrepreneurial teens.

Written and directed by Bernie Goldman and Melisa Walick, ""Meet Bill"" ranges from the hilarious to the mildly amusing - with just enough dull patches thrown in to keep us from raving too much over its virtues or letting it too much into our hearts.  The screenplay is frequently sharp in its comic portrayal of middle-aged angst, but it also feels vaguely rudderless, undernourished and underdeveloped for much of the time.

The real joy of the film lies in Aaron Eckhart's star turn as a man whose career and personal relationships clearly aren't what he'd hoped they'd be at this particular point in his life.  He's nicely supported by Elizabeth Banks as his philandering wife; Logan Lerman as his preppie protg; Jessica Alba as a lingerie salesgirl; Reed Diamond as his overly competitive gay brother-in-law; and SNL stars Kristen Wiig and Jason Sudeikis as donut-shop franchise owners who hope to go into business with Bill.

And speaking of the entrepreneurial spirit, a veritable goldmine awaits anyone savvy enough to market that amazing belly-busting weight-loss program Bill uses to great effect towards the end of the film.",1257638400,,1945,4.8844984802431615

I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the movie through, and have now seen it several times because I liked it so much.

Aaron Eckhart plays, basically, a very accurate depiction of a disgruntled male: his marriage is going down the tubes, he hates his job, has no idea how to have fun, and has no idea where he wants to be in life, yet knows he wants something more, something better. Throughout the movie, we learn about the tough situations in his life and how he deals with them (i.e. cheating wife, in-laws that only care about themselves), and feel badly for him, because his life just sucks.

Then, our main character undergoes a sort of personality transformation: he stands up for himself, finally, and acts out against the man that his wife is cheating with, gets himself involved in a program to assist high school students with banking and during this, meets an outgoing student that helps him come out of his shell and learn how to have fun and not take any trash from anybody. Along the way, Eckhart continuously does a great job of acting the role of a nice guy that realizes it is time he put himself first, for the first time in his life, and go out to get what makes him happy. Plenty of drama and chaos ensues, all of which is very realistic and does not ever feel overblown or too coincidental to actually happen to a real person.

The supporting cast includes Elizabeth Banks and Jessica Alba, both of whom perform well for the roles they were given. I have to say that this movie has quickly made its way into my Top 10, and this movie is definitely worth the money.",1238889600,2,1734,4.460567823343848

I actually agree with the other reviews saying that it didn't meld well--the way things played out was inconsistent to who Bill seemed to be. But I wasn't looking for melding, just for something to keep me interested and laughing and this did that. There was also a touch of sincerity to the whole of it that appealed to me.

But. Oh the but. I was truly bothered by the story line of the role reversal between Bill and the kid.(Logan Lerman, who was exceptional in his role and really stole the show). I love kids, love encouraging them. love seeing them expand their minds and enjoy the zany aspect they can bring to life. But Lerman's character was so smooth, polished, jaded, slick. And Bill was mentoring him to a life of chronic disappointment when he grows up and his smart-alecky ways start to smack him in the face. Spoiled rich kid does not even BEGIN to describe him. He was living in a plastic world and that was adulated throughout the movie, which I think is just wrong. Of course, the movie wouldn't work without it, so in that sense I'd give it a 0 star.

Lerman not only never has to face the consequences of his actions (opening scene Bill covers for him selling drugs in high school--he lies for a kid he doesn't even know.) but he is the cocky kingpin throughout the movie. I felt my stomach turn a couple of times when Lerman is sagely giving advice to BIll about how he should run his life (which is pretty much the basis for the movie). If you look at who Lerman's character is--a young, self-entered, quite narcissistic ne'erdowell--for him to give advice is about as valuable as a McDonald's soda cup discarded on the side of the road. To me, there is just something terribly wrong in the staging of that. Not that Lerman gave the advice, that fits for a typically know-it-all teenager. There is no fault to the character he is, just that this one-dimensional, inexperienced character who gets by on money, looks and grins was given such high esteem for being wise in the movie. And given this while at the same time Lerman is constantly having to be covered for his indiscretions by the man he is giving advice to.

There is a disconnect in that and it could be an undercurrent reason why many found this movie flat. A cocky kid who ends up mentoring the mentor doesn't sit well in the psyche. It comes across as false. It actually could have worked well if Bill was Lerman's own age.

Then there is the total disregard for any standards--Bill lies for Lerman repeatedly, joins in his sexual soiree (again, it's the age factor that leads to the discomfort), and joins him in getting high: A sentimental, golden scene where Bill has completely aided the delinquency of a minor and drove him across town while completely stoned. You can get arrested in both Washington and Colorado for both of those--pot friendly as they now are.

What partially redeems the plot (the film is redeemed by good acting) is that Lerman's character, narcissistic as it is, really does show generosity (with more than money, which has no value to him) and caring for Bill. And Lerman is such a superb actor that there is still a wisp of feeling that he looks up to Bill and seeks him to ""please love me like the dad I apparently don't have."" But then again. I was never completely won over that Lerman's actions weren't simply b/c he is like a mob-leader in self training and he just wanted to control Bill for his own personal pleasure (like buying the extra fire works). By the end there did seem to be genuine affection, but I""m not sure any of Lerman's actions were truly altruistic. Again, typical for a teen, so the character is true to form, but that still leaves the ""let me be the leader, follow me"" factor out of whack.",1392768000,,3852,4.497142857142857
