6389422,5,B00JRHW4GK,"I've been enjoying Silent Movies for most of my life, and I'm no spring chicken. So when this series of films was announced, I said, ""Musty Suffer""...""Harry Watson"" ??? Who, or what, the heck is that ?

Well, I've been arrogant. Just when you begin to think you know it all, humility comes knocking. I opened that door and am pleased to report that ""The Mishaps of Musty Suffer"" DVD is a revelation in so many ways, I don't know where to begin. But here goes...

These comedic films are not the missing link in film history. They're more like an incredible trip down the rabbit hole, each of which are a wonderful combination of high and low humor, surrealism mixed with a light does of realism, and, if you look deep enough, a reflection of the eternal struggle to find our place in a chaotic world (although Musty often manages to find order in the chaos, and vice versa).

The lead performer, Harry Watson, Jr., is really a forgotten talent. As the DVD liner notes indicate, he was a vaudeville headliner before appearing in these films between 1916 and 1917, and his long list of accomplishments includes success with both the Ringling Brothers' Circus as well as the Ziegfeld Follies.

The films themselves are in wonderful shape, thanks to the preservation work of the Library of Congress, and the heroic efforts of those brave producers who have resurrected these forgotten artifacts to DVD. Rarely have I seen such pristine material. The musical scores are spot on, and complement the movies enormously.

So, if you're interested in film history, watch this DVD. If you enjoy a good laugh, watch this DVD. If you're trying to make sense of the world without indulging in illegal drugs, watch this DVD. No matter what your rationale, please do yourself a favor and pick up this little gem. Like Musty, you'll have no regrets.",1397779200,30,1832,4.7125
6389423,5,B00JRHW4GK,"Silent comedy buffs owe a tip of the hat (and a bathtub full of beer) to film historians Ben Model and Steve Massa, co-producers of this fascinating DVD. Thanks to them, the rest of us can now enjoy the bizarre adventures of Musty Suffer, better known as Harry Watson, Jr., a long forgotten clown of stage and screen with an unforgettable face. For a couple of years during the First World War, while comedians such as Charlie Chaplin and Roscoe Arbuckle advanced from crude slapstick to more nuanced varieties of humor, Watson and his colleagues happily embraced the rough stuff, but did so with a weird, off-the-wall approach, resulting in a series of freaky short comedies that suggest the disturbing dreams you might have after eating too much spicy food.

In brief, the character Musty Suffer is a ragged hobo who undergoes a series of ""whirls,"" that is, misadventures in which he encounters crazy people and takes a lot of punishment. Watson's strenuous mugging is so broad and over-the-top, viewers may correctly guess that he was a former circus clown. (This and other pertinent details about the series can be found in Steve Massa's DVD companion booklet.) Your mileage may vary, but personally I enjoy the star's antics. These wacky comedies demand larger-than-life histrionics, not subtlety, and Watson and his supporting players supply the goods. Highlights of the set include Musty's perilous trip to the dentist (Local Showers), his gig at an automat from which no man returns (Outs and Ins), and his encounter with two sinister doctors who mess with his mind (Just Imagination). In While You Wait, our hero takes on three different jobs as servant in a wealthy household--butler, maid, and gardener--which is similar to the situation in Laurel & Hardy's Another Fine Mess, made some fourteen years later.

While watching these shorts I was reminded at times of the surreal trick films of Georges Mlis. Other moments suggest the cartoons of the Fleischer studio or Tex Avery, and then there are moments when we're smack dab in Ham & Bud territory, i.e. the world of low-life knockabout comedy. Some of the gags must have been familiar to viewers even when the shorts were new, but it's striking how the filmmakers usually managed to put an original spin on what they were doing. They look like they were having a great time, and that still comes across almost a century after the films were made. Ben Model and Steve Massa are to be commended for bringing these quirky comedies out of the vaults and into our living-rooms. Somewhere, Harry Watson, Jr., must be smiling. Or mugging furiously.",1397779200,10,2605,4.918181818181818

6389426,5,B00JRHW4GK,"Steve Massa and Ben Model have done us a tremendous service in making these important pieces of American film history available for the general public. Any fan of silent comedy, or any serious American film historian needs to treat themselves to a copy of this DVD and the companion book by Steve Massa. Truly a ""must have"" for any collection or reference shelf.",1397692800,2,362,4.761904761904762

6389428,5,B00JRHW4GK,"While Chaplin was creating his masterful short films for Mutual, a circus clown and early member of the Ziegfeld Follies named Harry Watson Jr. was making a series of semi-surreal and slightly off-kilter slapstick comedies for George Kleine. In this set, Ben Model has almost single-handedly rescued Watson's character, ""Musty Suffer"" from cinematic obscurity by presenting 10 of these vintage comedies, preserved by the Library of Congress and unseen by the general public for decades.

Now, I've been a silent film fan - and particularly a silent comedy fan for most of my life. For all of that time, I'd never even heard the name ""Musty Suffer,"" much less ""Harry Watson Jr."" and if I had, there would have been no way to watch his films. Thankfully, all of that's changed now, and these films can be evaluated on their own terms. Most surprising, to me, is that Watson draws from his own background as a clown rather than being just another shadow of Chaplin, so these films are much more like living cartoons, with many of the absurdities that came with that media. Although they're nearly 100 years old and mastered from 16mm safety copies, the prints are in remarkably good shape, and quite clear. Ben Model's scores are fantastic, and immeasurably add to the experience of watching these vintage silents. Steve Massa's 47 page booklet, available separately, fits perfectly inside the DVD, which is beautifully designed. Obviously, great care has been given to presenting these films in the best possible way, and it's much appreciated. Hopefully, at some point, Undercrank Productions will see fit to issue the rest of Watson's surviving films.",1397692800,3,1651,5.025547445255475
6389429,5,B00JRHW4GK,"I have been a fan of silent films and silent comedy since way back in 1962 when I was 10 years old and the great silent comedians were just being rediscovered. I've seen a lot of films and read a lot of books but I've never heard of ""Musty Suffer"" much less seen anything featuring him. I also never heard of Harry Watson Jr although I knew that producer George Kleine was one of the founders of Kalem, a once prominent silent film company. How then could it be possible that these films, once so popular, wound up languishing in the vaults of the Library of Congress for so many years? A partial answer to that question is that these shorts weren't produced by a major company so there were no studio vaults to store and preserve them. Another partial answer is that they were produced on the East Coast while Mack Sennett and company along with the rest of the burgeoning movie business became centered on the West Coast. Watson's death at the dawn of sound (1930) probably didn't help matters either.

Back to Musty Suffer. Thanks to the worldwide success of Charlie Chaplin, tramps who had been usually portrayed in movies like D.W. Griffith's THE LONESDALE OPERATOR (1909) or Lois Weber's SUSPENSE (1913) as villainous, became sympathetic and/or comic characters who were very popular. There were the Chaplin imitators like Billy West or similar characters like Lonesome Luke, the character portrayed by Harold Lloyd before he discovered his straw hat and glasses. Harry Watson Jr, born in 1876, was an experienced vaudevillian who was well known then as a performer and so he jumped on the tramp bandwagon as a way of entering movies. Watching him is like watching a silent Walter Matthau as they not only look alike but seem to have similar behavior patterns. Could Matthau have known this guy? The films were shot in and around The Bronx making them a valuable actuality of the New York of that era. They also featured returning performers such as leading lady Della Connor and fellow vaudvillian H.H. McCullum.

Composer/performer Ben Model ran across these unknown shorts at the Library of Congress and immediately realizing their originality and potential, began a kickstarter campaign that would eventually result in this DVD-R release. There was always an element of anarchy in silent comedy but nothing quite like this which was designed to be shown on a weekly basis. Model has assembled 10 of the best shorts he could find to give us a taste of this truly unusual character. Almost all of the shorts are gems with JUST IMAGINATION, BLOW YOUR HORN, and LOCAL SHOWERS at the top of my list with the others not far behind. Bizarre and surreal, their visual cleverness make them as fresh today (actually fresher) than they were almost 100 years ago. So sample some somewhere and then come back and purchase this disc so that more releases are likely to see the light of day. I thought I had seen it all when it came to silent comedy but I was wrong. These shorts are an absolute MUST and you definitely won't SUFFER.

POST SCRIPT (5/28/14): It would appear that the information on imdb is wrong (wouldn't be the first time). I'll leave the review as it is since even misinformation is valuable if it's corrected and the corrections are posted below.",1400803200,2,3261,4.737676056338028
6389430,5,B00JRHW4GK,"When two of the best silent film historians like Ben Model and Steve Massa get together on a project, you are assured that the results are going to be sensational.  This series of fresh, original, and thoroughly delightful comedy shorts starring Harry Watson Jr. as gloriously grotesque Musty Suffer has been virtually unseen for the past 90 years, leading a lonely life on the shelf of The Library of Congress.  Thanks to Ben and Steve, these films have been finally released in a magnificent presentation on this DVD, complete with terrific new scores and a companion book (available separately for a very small price).  If you haven't ordered this DVD and the book yet, please do so and I guarantee you'll be amazed and delighted at this wonderful discovery!",1400284800,4,761,4.883720930232558

Quality is practically pristine. If you are a silent film enthusiast, this is a MUST. You will not see Watson on youtube like Chaplin or Keaton. This is an investment & entitles both Massa & Model to continue their work thru Library of Congress. Please support this cause......no regrets!!",1398729600,2,460,4.910256410256411
6389432,5,B00JRHW4GK,"I almost titled this review ""A Treasure Trove for the Silents Fan"" but that's not quite fair - you don't have to be a fan of silent films to find yourself in tears with any of these shorts.

Harry Watson Jr. is the absolute star in each of these nine and a half howlers.  His rubber face is perfect for the lead role, reacting to the outrageous situations our hero finds himself in through a twitch of his mile-long mouth or a roll of one of his seemingly independent eyes.  He is every bit the master of slapstick, and certainly would deserve a place on the top shelf with Chaplain, Lloyd, and Keaton.

If you are interested in finding out more about Watson and his outstanding entourage of comedians and actors who accompany him on his films, you absolutely can't go wrong with Steve Massa's companion guide, sold separately.  Once you've read that, you may also enjoy the number of articles available through Google Books - search on ""Harry Watson Jr."" and you'll have an appreciation for how well-loved this comedian was back in the day.  Amazing that he's not better known today.",1398470400,13,1084,4.590673575129534

6389435,5,B00JRHW4GK,"This collection of 1916 creativity and spills reveals what made people laugh during early silents. Musty is an Everyman character who shellacks the film frames with the broad humor found in Vaudeville, appealing to audiences who also know how Dame Fortune eludes us by a hairpin's turn of ludicrous circumstance. His flexibility in adapting to whatever wilderness of society is in motion elevates the improbable into the possible, with cheerful optimism and a seemingly bumbling physicality that is well-timed and truly graceful.  This is an enjoyable, significant collection showcasing Mr. Watson, who is more than deserving of the recognition.",1398211200,5,645,5.515151515151516
6389436,5,B00JRHW4GK,"Comedy buffs have heard about this series for decades but had not seen them until now. This DVD is a great new addition to the silent comedy pantheon and the humor is about as wild and crazy as it gets - more along the lines of a 1946 Tex Avery MGM cartoon or a 1970 episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus than anything from 1916, including Henry ""Suicide"" Lehrman's delirious attempts to out-do Mack Sennett.",1398038400,5,410,4.48

8653585,5,B00JRHW4GK,Harry Watson - I never had heard of him. A great surprise! And I'm sure there are many others waiting to be found.,1458259200,,114,4.0
8653586,3,B00JRHW4GK,"For a brief spell in 1915 - 1916 (put it in perspective: that was the year ""Birth of a Nation"" was the top film), Harry Watson jr. - as silent film clown Musty Suffer - was a minor celebrity because of a series of one reel comedy shorts he starred in. Although popular at the time, the films (and Watson) were quickly forgotten. Almost one hundred years later, the films were made available on DVD with the help of the Library Congress (which preserved them) and funding from crowd sourcing on the internet. Any silent comedy films that are one hundred years old are valuable simply because of their antiquity. Hats off to all those involved in this project for making this available to the public. The films are in surprisingly good shape (with a few rare patches of fading here and there). Some sections are brilliantly clear.
But putting aside the historical value of these films, the question needs to be asked: How entertaining are these?
Watson was a clown. As in circus clown. Much of this is physical humor, wildly exaggerated facial expressions, cartoonish escapades, etc. There's nothing subtle about Musty Suffer. At his best, Musty can be graceful and light on his feet (he does one or two little dances that are a joy to watch), impish, energetic, and charming. At his worst, he's just another vulgar and histrionic mugger doing crude slapstick. There's talent here, no doubt. At times, there's a hint or two that Musty seems almost about to break out of the Tom and Jerry hi-jinks into something more interesting and sublime, but he never crosses that bridge; he only places his tippy-toe on it. We're stuck with fat jokes (yep, there's a guy so fat that the elevator can't lift him to the second floor and they need to use a horse to do the trick, and the last short has Musty married to a very fat harridan) and even a (yawn) pie in the face. There are a few good very early special effects (quick cutting, film playing backwards) to add to the interest of these films, but, overall, this is mostly for silent film fans who are mad about the genre. There are redeeming features in these films but I didn't find these funny or indispensable. The better shorts come first; there's a gradual decline in quality as the dvd proceeds, and the last two shorts are abysmal. I also think this was overpriced (the films are in the public domain, after all). The booklet that gives the history of these films has to be bought separately, jacking the price up to 25$ - something this package is definitely not worth.  Summary: The value of these films lie more in their age than in the antics of  the moderately talented Harry Watson Jr.",1428624000,3,2641,4.593220338983051

8653588,4,B00JRHW4GK,"An unusual collection of silent shorts featuring forgotten comedian Harry Watson Jr as Musty Suffer. In each short, Musty takes on a new job such as bellhop with predictable, sometimes chaotic results. Not the greatest, but a good curio. Interesting.",1416700800,,250,5.275
8653589,5,B00JRHW4GK,"Wow, what a great find!  Excellent restorations of films I am astonished even still exist, and some of these are very funny!  Not only that, but they are full of exceptional imagination--reminds me a little of Charlie Bowers, but with better pacing.

The ensemble is also amazing; they are a wonderful group of bizarros and they work tightly together with some fantastic pantomime.  Watson even dances in a couple of these films.  I wish they had continued to make movies; I would like to see a whole lot more of these wonderful actors.

So, we have short, inventive comedies with wildly creative characters and situations, in quite viewable prints, AND...  drum roll please...  Exceptional musical accompaniments!

Now if anyone out there has by some chance of fate ever read my other reviews of silent films, you probably know that the sound accompaniments are critical to me, and insufficient sound makes me crazy.  I can't stand it if the music does not seem to relate to the image, or if it is out of sync (the sound-picture sync problem in the recent release of newly-restored Chaplin's Mutual Films makes me want to firebomb my screen).

I must say these are the best musical accompaniments I have ever heard from Mr. Model.  He even goes right ahead without apology and places musical accents where there are visual highlights (read: when someone gets hit over the head), and IT IS GREAT!  And NO it is not distracting--his music supports the movies beautifully, and makes the comedy come to life.  There were a few times when I laughed out loud, and later realized that it was his musical accent that pushed me over the top from a smile to a laugh.

There are other comedians out there who need to be brought out of the attic, and I recently read that Mr. Model is next working on a Marcel Perez DVD.  Judging by the few clips I've found of this early comedian, the upcoming DVD will also be enlightening.  Get this ""Musty Suffer"" DVD now, and be sure to watch for ""The Marcel Perez Collection"", probably out early 2015.",1415491200,3,2029,4.670422535211268

8653591,4,B00JRHW4GK,"Some hilarious stuff here, and some of the humor is whacked - not what you might expect from 1916-17. Watson's face was certainly made from elastic vinyl; nothing else could stretch and reconfigure itself into so many different contortions. He was a master of facial expression, in the comic vein - not so much an acrobatic comic like Keaton or Chaplin. There are some great gags in these shorts, and some very creative camera and film manipulation for special effects. The price is obviously good, so what are you waiting for? Buy it!

It's difficult to believe that it's nearly been a century since these works have been seen by the general public.  Just as hysterical as the reputed lot of comedians from the silent era.

There are some very clever gags and camera tricks in these films (and these films were done in 1916).  Harry Watson, Jr. was a great comedy talent and now finally people can see for themselves.

There were so many laugh out loud things here, I couldn't count them all!
There is one bit in one of these that very much reminded me of the great Ernie Kovacs.  Remember how he used to draw stuff like table lamps and pull the string and a light would go on?
Well good ole Musty does it in one of these.  I don't think it's possible that Ernie could have seen these so I am assuming that great minds do think alike.
Everything written here about these films is all true!
My favorite was the Fairy Tramp.  We should all have one of those.  I tried to call for mine, but he didn't appear.  Darn!!  Maxfield Moree (who plays the Fairy Tramp and is in a lot of these films) has to be seen to be believed.  Saying that he is a human ostrich almost describes him.
