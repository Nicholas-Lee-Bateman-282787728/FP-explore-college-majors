8048279,3,B0007LC564,"Not for anyone with Injuries past or present.
I was hoping to gain an incite to new exercises that incorporate breathing but do not involve Crunches or anything that will disturb a broken back.
Not this one. This is an Excellent video for anyone who is not injured and wants to learn the Proper way to do crunches and breathing exercises for abdominal build up.
Not for Singers with Broken Backs.
The content is basic and solid. I grew up in Martial Arts from old school 1960s and this was how we were taught to do crunches back then. Scott Sonnon is an excellent instructor.",1403740800,3,575,4.485714285714286
8048280,5,B0007LC564,"This DVD got me moving again. Thank you, Scott.
As mentioned previously, this is a series of progressive positions that allow you to move on at your own pace. Once each is mastered you have another to challenge you.
11 years ago I sat down at a desk and I am now a woman of 50, 30-40 lbs overweight. After trying numerous workout routines I found I just didn't stay with them because I was too darned uncomfortable. This isn't a routine, it's a live-it.
The first day of trying to lift my head off the ground using just my abs, I barely got my shoulders up. Throughout that day, I incorporated into my routine, sets of 3, of Scott's basic breathing techniques. By the next day I was able to come to a full sitting position, without strain.
I see this as a very effective tool to getting me back in shape.
Thanks again!",1338336000,5,818,4.283870967741936
8048281,5,B0007LC564,Fantastic guide to mastering breath and movement. It should be used in conjuction with Forward Pressure.,1231891200,3,104,5.5625
8048282,3,B0007LC564,"I agree on the fact that this video is short on content for the price tag.  If you've been doing yoga for any length of time, much of this will be intuitive, and most likely you've been doing this stuff for quite some time.

If you haven't done a lot of yoga, and you've spent a bunch of time torquing yourself through crunches, you will benefit from the perspective offered in this product, but again it's not my favorite of Scott's videos and seems to be a bit short on content.",1212451200,9,480,4.263736263736264
8048283,3,B0007LC564,"This is basically a DVD of breathing during Ab exercises. You start with some basic posture breathing exercises sitting in a chair. then it moves to the floor and the movements bcome increasingly difficult. You are to only take it to the level you are comfortable. This is not a ""work along DVD"" but an ""observe, then do"" style. It is helpful but I really expected more content for my money.",1179532800,13,391,4.52112676056338
8048284,1,B0007LC564,"I'm sorry but the title of this review pretty much sums up the whole video. Yes it may have some flash with the interesting background music and multiple angles during Sonnon's typical hype, but the actual mat work is pumped up pilates with a new name. Real Sad!",1088726400,3,262,4.479166666666667
8048285,5,B0007LC564,"Yes, whether appropriate or not, this is a ""sophistocate"" form of Pilates or ""core conditioning"".
The goal of this program is ""Perpetual Exercise"", that is taking this routine and using the principals in your normal daily life.
It teaches you to use your movement to breathe you, oppose to making breathing a conscious activity. By doing this, you give your body more energy by using your breathing more efficiently as you integrate it with your movement and alignment.
This is a breathing re-education!
But also, this program will lubricate and expand the range of motion in your spine. Moreover, this program will strengthen your ""core"" muscles, beyond the best Pilates program(I should know...I teach Pilates and was trained in Stott Core Conditioning).
Mr. Sonnon, initially gives you the theory behind this program and presents his audience with ""THE Perpetual"" movement behind this breathing re-education concept. Then he shows five skills(Butterfly, Pike, Straddle, Hurdler, Shinbox twist) to enhance your perpetual exercise. It goes from complex to more complex. The movements are simple in understanding, yet challenging in practice.
If you are familiar with basic Pilates movements, you'll find all the skills to be similar to the ""Roll up"" and ""Rollover"". Yet, they are more challenging or sophistocated. The goal is not core conditioning, it's a by-product of this breathing re-education program. Again, it's about allowing your movement to breathe you! ""It's not the finger pointing, but the moon"".
Scott's done it again!",1059091200,13,1534,5.369294605809128
