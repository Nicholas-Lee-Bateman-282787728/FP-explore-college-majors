6424140,5,B00KF6G2TM,"This is a Twlight Time release, that means it's a limited edition and faster then you can blink it will go up in price. Is it worth it, well as a fan of the Thunderbirds I can only say YES! Why, because the picture if far better then the DVD's out there, I know, I compared them. Then there is the fact they include opening credits which are not seen on the dvds nor have they been seen since these were released in the theaters and finally this set contains an audio track not found on the dvds (all the other extras are from the dvd's). You might, for awhile, find a much lower price at ""Screen Archives Entertainment"" but don't wait too long as these very soon show up on ebay selling in the 100-200 dollar range!!!",1400803200,7,718,4.2101449275362315

8658164,4,B00KF6G2TM,"Need to be restored to top quality. These movies are a legacy of Anderson's body of work showing of Supermarionation at it's height,  and should not be neglected of a proper digital upgrade for the fans to admire and cherish.",1518998400,,225,4.625
8658165,5,B00KF6G2TM,"I've been waiting for a long time for these two movies to come to Blu-ray, and I am NOT disappointed! While ""Thunderbirds Are Go"" is generally considered the better of the two movies, ""Thunderbird 6"" is also quite good and along with the previously released ""Thunderbirds"" TV series Blu-ray completes the original 1960's show. Each of the films is are on separate Blu-ray discs, and have extra features including making of featurettes, commentaries, and trailers. The video quality is very good, despite the movies being originally shot on half-frame 35mm film. Great fun for all! (Even those of us who are middle-aged.)",1505433600,,620,5.088235294117647

8658170,5,B00KF6G2TM,"This is the fifth item I have ever got for viewing the two Thunderbirds feature films.  #1: Two volumes of VHS video cassettes imported from the US.  #2: A box of two laserdiscs manufactured and released in Japan in 1991, regrettably, NOT in widescreen size.  #3: Two separate laserdiscs manufactured and released in Japan in 1998, for the first time in techniscope size, and furthermore, about one-minute missing scene of Parker witnessing one of the henchmen editing the tapes recording Penelope's voices was discovered and included!  #4: Two separate DVDs manufactured and released in Japan, containing a variety of bonus features such as an audio commentary and interviews.  Unfortunately in #2 through #4, the THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO item had on screen no name of the staff who created this masterpiece in 1966.  And now #5: This blu-ray disc has enabled us to see the credit titles in the opening sequence in which the Martian Exploration Vehicle being connected to the main body of Zero X with Barry Gray's main theme score!  Here we have come a long way to a perfect version of this motion picture.",1409961600,5,1102,4.89247311827957
