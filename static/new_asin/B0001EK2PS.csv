8011180,5,B0001EK2PS,I ordered this for my sister because she had one and it was temporarily misplaced.  It is one of her favorite workouts.,1357948800,,119,4.409090909090909

I have absolute beginners and this one for feeling stronger.  I love them both.",1320364800,,144,4.958333333333333
8011182,5,B0001EK2PS,"I have fibromyalgia and some days the pain and stiffness are overwhelming; there are days I cannot stand up straight and walk without assistance.  I do the beginners routine on this almost every day; sometimes I switch and do a different option or combine more than one routine from this dvd.

Marlon Braccia is exceptional at instructing you on how to get into the proper position.  She stresses proper form and alignment over ""how deeply into"" the pose you can get.  She shows alternative levels of capability for most poses.  She is encouraging without being cheerleader-ish.

With her excellent guidence, I have been able to acheive incredibly complex and challenging poses like bakasana (crane/crow pose) which is a compact handstand!  I've been doing yoga for 15 years and could never do it until she explained and demonstrated the easiest way to get into the position.  She even explains that just trying to do the pose without being able to fully lift both feet has its benefits.

After completing the routines on this dvd, I feel stronger and can move with more ease and agility than ever before. This is my go-to dvd 9 out 10 days!",1306540800,7,1141,4.780612244897959
8011183,4,B0001EK2PS,"This is not beginner yoga by any means, but if you are in shape and have some experience with yoga, you can learn a lot more. When I look at the screen it looks easy and flowing, but it's really challenging stuff--in a good way.  This gal knows what she is doing and explains it in a one on one way.  It's kind of like Yogi Marlon is right there in my living room.  The DVd's not flashy, but it feels like I AM getting stronger every day.",1135209600,12,438,3.9545454545454546
8011184,4,B0001EK2PS,"This video has a very homemade, low budget feel to it.  However, the content is very good.  All of the workouts on this video are a good for beginners as well as those more advanced.  Some of the more advanced moves can be hard on an inexperienced body.  I had to take it easy at first to avoid injury.  These workouts are some of my favorite (and I own a whole bunch), and I recommend them to anyone insterested in practicing yoga.",1132358400,8,432,4.219512195121951
8011185,3,B0001EK2PS,"Check out her other DVD: Yoga for Absolute Beginners.

Her DVD contains immense information about yoga, spirituality, getting in touch with your body & spirit & proper breathing in other menu options & in the beginning of the 4 25-min workouts.

She has a great voice, very patient, she tells you in the begining of each pose the proper form, what to watch out for to avoid injury, some modifcations & when to breathe, but during the poses thre's a lot of silence & during some moving postures, you don't know if she moved or not. I wish she would also tell you benefits during, but does not.

The way she teaches is like a classroom, each pose is like a new lesson, no fluidity. The music is very soft, barely hear it though it's beautiful. What bothered me pesonally is that they are the same songs from a favotire mind/body workout ""Tantric Toning"" & while it's great music to keep your mind from racing & other things, most has a fast pace that doesn't fit the pace at which she teaches.

This is great for people who like precise instruction & silence during each pose.
