1084542,5,6305857563,"If you thought Titanic had too much romance and wanted lots of gunfights, then Britanic is what you are looking for.  Mixing a blend of Titanic with Western like gunfights and Indiana Jonesesqe escapes, Britanic comes off as one of the best TV Movies I've seen in years.  The plot centers around a maid who works for a familly sailing on the HMS Britanic.  After a flashback sequence involving the Titanic, we learn that she survived the Titanic.  How this relates to the film dosent really matter, but is obviously nessicary.  Later some deep, dark, secrets are revealed, but saying them would ruin the suprise (Although we know what one charachter is 3 minutes after we meet him).  The highlights for me were definitly the gunfights and the exciting ""Escape the sinking ship"" sequence.  Definitly worth a look.
The Good:
Lots of action, likable charachters, Good CGI
The bad:
Obvious copy of Titanic
And the Ugly:
Nothing really",1016064000,6,930,4.848101265822785
1084543,4,6305857563,"""Britannic"" is well worth watching.  The pace keeps moving swiftly, and the action is compelling.  The acting is impressive, especially that of Edward Atterton.  Atterton plays a German spy on the ship.  His mission is to either take control of the vessel or sink it.  With a skillful performance, he causes the viewer to really believe that he will accomplish his mission at all costs.  But in the end, he is only doing his duty.  As for the movie's other qualities, the computer graphics appear cartoonish at first, but they end up adding creative and helpful scenes to the storyline.  For example, the aerial shot of the German submarine's torpedoes heading towards the Britannic is quite stunning.  All in all, an entertaining story speculating on the demise of the Britannic.  Enjoy.",1010707200,,788,4.9465648854961835
1084544,1,6305857563,"If I was a family member of one of the people who died in the sinking of BRITANNIC, I would be devasted by the treatment of this subject.  Rather than build a film based on facts and reasonable conjecture, the producers have created a contrived, might have been plot that doesn't do much to clear up any questions about the loss of the ship.  Not that it is their intention, but still it could have been done so much better.

It is true that there was a survivor from BRITANNIC that also survived the sinking of TITANIC; I believe it was a woman who was employed as a stewardess in both ships, certainly not the charecter portrayed in this film.

The computer graphics make this film seem more of a computer generated animation film.  However, the scenes in the engine room are great for those of us with an interest in ship's engines.  For me, this was the high point of the film.

The acting was mechanical by all concerned.  I got the feeling that several people needed a paycheck to cover outstanding bills and this seemed a painless way to accomplish this task.

By the way, Britain was in a state of war, it is highly unlikely that there would have been an illuminated light house beacon in operation to light up ships leaving a harbor outside of which were potential submarines waiting to attack.  Sloppy research here!

I've seen worse maritime movies, but Britannic is totally without interest.  It could have been done so much better with a better script and actors who were really involved in their roles. If there is a choice between A Night to Remember and Britannic, go for the former!",976406400,7,1599,4.533101045296167

1084546,5,6305857563,"Inspired by the 1998 ""Titanic"", this is the story of the  mysterious sinking of Titanic's Sister Ship Britannic.  Starring Amanda  Ryan, and featuring John Rhys-Davies (Salah in the Indiana Jones films),  the cast is surprisingly good in the way only mid-level British actors can  be, turning in workmanlike performances that nearly make you forget this is  not a big-budget blockbuster.

1084547,4,6305857563,"This February 2000 TV movie claims to be based on ""true events"", but the only truth to this film is that the ship sank.  The filmmakers decided to instead tell the dramatic tale of a group of German spies who  attempt a fictionalized take-over of the ship that, in a roundabout way,  leads to a bomb exploding which causes Britannic to sink.  Despite the lack  of historical detail found in Cameron's TITANIC, Britannic is a good  adventure movie which boasts better-than-average computer graphics for a TV  movie.  I encourage viewers to remember the ficitonal aspects of this film  and give in to the whimsy of the post-TITANIC sea disaster flicks.",962841600,,650,4.836363636363636

1084549,4,6305857563,"Thanks to expert storytelling, this clever sequel to The Titanic keeps the action ahead of the audience at all times. Featuring a powerful star turn by Jacqueline Bisset, who keeps burnishing her awesome talent with each  role, this dramatic thriller is a spell binder.  I was skeptical at first  that anyone could sink another ship and keep it interesting. I was won over  by the amazing plot and the tension that was built with flashbacks and the  mysterious activities of Ms. Bisset and her shipmates. Would have been five  stars if Director and effects were stronger, but still more fun and faster  moving than it's billion dollar sister ship! More thrills and surprises  than Titanic, with more action and much less mush. One great surprise twist  after another kept me on the edge of my seat!",962150400,,798,4.8088235294117645
1084550,2,6305857563,"As an historian of Titanic and her sisters, I was disappointed that the film did not take a scientific approach, answering some old questions and raising new ones. I always like to learn something I don't already know,  and this film had nothing new to offer unless you consider the  fictionalized story, which gives the film a nice tv-movie feel. This one  would never have made it at the box office. If you know nothing about the  Britannic, or just like an interesting tale of adventure/disaster at sea,  then this is worth a look. If, however, you prefer solid documentraies with  top-notch research and original thinking, this film will be a  disappointment.",961891200,,663,4.866071428571429

Lots of things were bad, but the dialogue was the killer.  It was silly, it was like it was written by somebody who never heard people talk.  It was so bad I sold it to my local used bookstore, but I still had a pang of guilt because I knew somebody else was going to buy it and watch it.  The special effects were so bad at the end that I thought they must have run out of money.  Or they lost interest.

1084641,1,6305857563,"An obvious attempt to cash in on the hysteria surrounding her more famous sister ship, Titanic, Britannic is one of the poorest films to be produced in years.

Launched in 1914, the Britannic was requisitioned by the Admiralty and summarily converted into a hospital ship for use during World War I. With modifications arising from the Titanic disaster, she was repainted white with a distinctive green stripe down her sides punctuated by red crosses. But on November 21, 1916, while heading for Gallipoli, she either struck a mine or was torpedoed off the coast of Greece.

The writers clearly thought it unnecessary to research the actual sinking of the doomed ship, and based their screenplay solely on assumption and what little common knowledge there is. With a lot of elements from James Cameron's Titanic (1997) and The Hindenburg (1975) thrown in, the end result is a preposterous storyline with laughable scenes that could never have taken place given the actual facts and morals of the times.

The soggy story follows Vera Campbell, a British agent posing as a nanny, who is placed aboard the vessel to uncover a nefarious German plot. But her mission is complicated when she falls in love with the ship's chaplain, Reynolds. The homely Amanda Ryan plays the female lead, while Edward Atterton plays her love interest -- the two share some of the most clumsy and revolting kisses in cinema history. But even the talents of John Rhys-Davies as the Captain and Jacqueline Bisset as Lady Lewis cannot keep the dismal production afloat.

Despite numerous shoot-outs and chases, there is not a single drop of suspense. With cardboard sets and the most embarrassing computer animation ever created, this is one voyage you should strive to miss. Rating: 1 out of 10.",1338940800,,1769,4.966216216216216

1084643,4,6305857563,I enjoyed this film although it is not in the same category as the story we enjoyed in the tragic events shown in the film Titanic. It is debateable just how accurate the facts are in this movie.

1084716,5,6305857563,"The reason I watched this movie when it first aired on TV was because I was getting over a phase where I was interested in everything related to the Titanic tragedy.  This movie of the equally tragic demise of Titanic's sister ship ranks in my to TV movies of the last few years.  The cast were all perfect in their parts.  Amanda Ryan is quite believable as Vera Campbell, John Rhys-Davies (one of my favorite actors ever!!) adds a special brand of comedy as the Brittanic's captain and the two kids are adorable!!  There are a few moments that are some what unacceptable for younger children, including a couple of bullets and some blood-shed.  However, the drama and angst is well balanced out by some comedy and adventure moments.  The suspense is gripping, and all the good points overshadow the less-than-perfect special effects.  If you liked ""Titanic"", this is a must-see movie!!",1100476800,3,887,4.796052631578948
1084717,5,6305857563,"I've read all the reviews and just had to add another one.  I'm thrilled that somebody finally made a movie about this forgotten shipwreck.  The Britannic was the third of three Olympic Class ships, (Olympic, Titanic and Britannic).  Everybody knows the Titanic's story as it's been told and retold and often added to over the years, but what about her sisters?  The Olympic had a long career and was retired and scrapped, though the Britannic met a similar fate as Titanic, as described in this TV adaption.

True, the British were at war and the Britannic was serving as a hospital ship, but what caused her rapid sinking is unknown.  A Titanic survivor (Violet Jessop) was onboard during the sinking as a nurse on Britannic.  And, the casualties of the Britannic were accurately depicted here as seen from the lifeboats, as another lifeboat filled with passengers was chopped to bits by the propellers, a sad fact. So some facts were twisted and turned around, it's a movie, not a National Geographic Documentry.

This is an excellent movie for anybody with a passion for excitement, drama, mystery and shipwrecks.  I thought the story was plausable and it kept me interested.  The torpedo scene was merely added, my guess as a hint of things to come, and the sinking itself was excellent.  The water did look fake but to see this beautiful ship go to her grave was awsome, never before seen in anything more than paintings.

Nobody complained about Cameron's made up love story in 1997's Titanic, or the way he dropped the ball with Molly Brown in the lifeboat, they were movies!  A love story was needed, as in the 1953 Titanic with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck, and it was very suitable in my opinion to incorporate spying and sabotage into this movie . . . it doesn't mean we have to accept it as fact, it's entertainment, pure and simple.

So I give this one of a kind movie five stars.  For it's casting, it's graphics, it's story and most of all, for finally giving this forgotten maiden of the sea her moment on the silver screen.",1099612800,3,2046,4.66016713091922
1084718,4,6305857563,"Riding on the wave of Titanic-fever that followed the release of the hugely popular James Cameron movie TITANIC this production focuses on the lesser-known but equally ill fated sister ship of the famous liner - the Britannic.

 Ostensibly posing as a hospital ship in World War I transporting medical supplies across the Mediterranean, the Britannic is actually carrying a large cache of weapons, a clear violation of the rules of war that threatens both the safety of genuine hospital ships but also gives justification for this ships destruction by German agents.

 Suspecting this to be the case Germany has planted a top German agent on board as a chaplain, who with the aid of Irish insurgents already on board as members of the crew. Not to be outdone however, British Intelligence somehow (it is never fully explained how) have caught wind of the German plot ands planted a female agent on board (despite having just graduated from spy school - she was apparently the only British agent available for the operation). No matter that the British agent is impossibly beautiful (as played by the stunning Amanda Ryan) and therefore unlikely to blend into the background (surely an essential characteristic for an agent) but her character is not only a survivor of the original Titanic sinking, but also the one passenger who falls in love with the German agent - oh the irony.

 Nevertheless one charge that can never be leveled at ""Britannic"" is (despite its laughable claim to tell the 'untold story' of the liner), it is certainly never boring or lacking in thrills. Its special effects may look more fitting for a high production value video game, and some of the veteran actors on the cast list guilty of incredible overacting, but this is all part of the charm of this movie. Taken for what it is, you cannot help but enjoy the movie and with a cast that includes Jacqueline Bisset and the ever amazing John Rhys-Davies, it's all good hokum fun.

 Leave the history books on the bookshelf and sit back for the escapist drama which is 2000's BRITANNIC",1091059200,15,2060,4.832386363636363

I turned on the television to see it one night without expecting very much, mainly because nobody has any idea what really sank the ship in the first place. However I was bowled over by the great story, character development and interesting take on what may have happened to her. As far as I'm concerned this movie is as good as it could have been considering the historical evidence, and the possiblity of a German spy on board was indeed an interesting touch. Although for the record, the famed torpedo incident didn't take place, and neither did the gunfight on board. My only real complaint is the casting of John Ryes-Davis as Captain Bartlett.
