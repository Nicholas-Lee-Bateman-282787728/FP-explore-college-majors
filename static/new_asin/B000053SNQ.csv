7930662,4,B000053SNQ,"QUEEN OF THE JUNGLE is actually an episode of TV's SHEENA: QUEEN OF THE JUNGLE, called THE LASH (1956). Sheena (Irish McCalla- SHE DEMONS, HANDS OF A STRANGER) finds herself up against the eeevil, whip-cracking Bull Kendall (Buddy Baer), who seems to enjoy killing just about anyone in his way, as he searches for a hidden treasure. Kendall is a true sadist, hurting and murdering w/ obvious glee! Animal cruelty soon follows! Baer was an imposing, mountainous figure, perfectly suited for such heavy roles. Ms. McCalla is beautiful, smart, and resourceful, in her awesome part. Makes me want to watch the entire series!...",1496620800,,623,5.058252427184466
7930663,2,B000053SNQ,"As others have stated... this is not the 1935 film but the 1955-6 TV serial.  They don't even appear to be consecutive episodes, as the first was clearly ""The Lash"" from mid-1955 and the last ""The Rival Queen"" (the final episode of the show) from 1956.  In these episodes the gigantic Buddy Baer (younger brother of heavy-weight boxing champ Max Baer and a massive 6'7"" - sort of a smaller version of Andre the Giant) plays antagonist Bull Kendall.  He's hard to miss and makes it easy to identify the episodes.

Poor production qualities with mediocre acting and scripts, but slightly redeemed by the extremely beautiful Irish McCalla in the lead role.  In her own words: ""I couldn't act, but I could swing through the trees"".  Not to mention looking good in a leopard print mini (she was a pin-up and Vargas girl).  I give these 2 stars instead of 1 because they are watchable... barely.",1486252800,,889,4.660256410256411
