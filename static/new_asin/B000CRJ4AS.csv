The product is amazing! I have a very picky 2 1/2 year old and stumbled on the suggestion of this video in an old message board so I had to search it out! We love to watch 'kids' every day and it has inspired my son to try new things! He is still working on it but watching other kids do things really encourages him to try. He even licked a pickle on day after watching a baby eat one in this!! The premise of this is absolutely amazing and I wish they were still making these as this would be a series my little one would love....and we would love to see more foods in videos like this one! Tiny Guides...come back!",1394409600,,710,4.144927536231884
8101369,4,B000CRJ4AS,"We got this video as a gift and my 10 month old LOVES it - he laughs at all the big kids and is just mesmerized.  It's so much better than the Baby Einstein stuff - he just isn't that into them.  I don't know if it's helped him learn to eat better (he's already a pretty good eater), but I have a friend with an almost 2 year old who said that after he watched the video a few times, he started taking a bite out of an apple, which he'd never done before.  So...who knows?

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish it were just a little bit longer!",1140134400,3,572,3.7815126050420167
8101370,5,B000CRJ4AS,"I didn't know a DVD could be so helpful.  When my son started eating table food, he had no interest in feeding himself and and I was talking to a friend who recommended showing him this video.  He watched the first couple of times and nothing much changed (except for the fact that he loved the music and would smile and clap), then all of a sudden something clicked and he pointed at the TV and picked up a piece of banana and ate it (i was letting him eat while he watched it).  I know this sounds silly, but it was amazing for me!",1139270400,4,533,4.057142857142857
8101371,5,B000CRJ4AS,"My daughter loves noodles but getting her to eat broccoli was a real chore. When she watches TV she wants to be like the characters- here they show children eating healthy foods and now, she wants to be like the video kids.  The days of fighting at the dinner table are over.",1139184000,2,275,4.288461538461538
8101372,5,B000CRJ4AS,"I have a three year old daughter who has always been a bit of a picky eater.  I was looking at picky eating books, and I came across this DVD.  She loves it!  The music is great, and she has tried several new foods since watching it.  She especially likes the last scene with a whole section on fresh fruits and vegetables.  I recommend this to anyone who has a toddler who might need to expand their eating horizons.",1138838400,5,417,4.227848101265823
