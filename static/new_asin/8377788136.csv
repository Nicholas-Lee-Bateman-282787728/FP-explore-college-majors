7901024,4,8377788136,"This dvd has a runtime of 103 minutes but with a few short trailers added on it amounts to 107 minutes which is what the description claims. I hate when they do that. The original movie (according to IMDB) was 112 minutes so they have cut 9 minutes from the original release. That said, the quality of this dvd is fairly good and the sound is dolby 5.1 polish language with no subs.",1428796800,,382,4.2465753424657535
