2313842,3,B0009RQRSS,"Pretty good movie... it does a nice job of developing tension and suspense.

The only reason we probably did not like it more was some bad acting from all but the 2 lead characters and more importantly about 35 minutes into the film we had already figured out who the killer was and the whole ""punch line"" of the movie..... so rather than being held in suspense, we were impatient for the movie to ""get to the end already"" since we already knew who & why the killer was who they were !""",1127606400,,486,4.225806451612903
2313843,3,B0009RQRSS,"I am a huge Argento fan and I cant figure out why.

The man has some pretty good ideas in his films but usually poor acting,dubbing & budget sink them right from the start.

I think his work is fit to be remade by someone who understands & sees Argentos brilliance as clearly as a fan.

I think Argento should be allowed complete creative controll & final cut of any remake someone may do.

The Card Player is supposed to be a sequal to The Stendhal Syndrome however I don't see how.

Other than the charactor of Anna played by two different actors no reference is made to the previous film.

The Card Player is about a killer who plays high stakes poker with the police online.

Unlike previous Argento films most of the violence is done off camera aiming more for suspense.

Good news is Argento is less than a decade behind current film makers within this genre.

Also the dubbing is minimal and not too noticeable & the acting is pretty solid.

Bad news is that its all been done b4 and to greater effect.

In the end Card Player may only be suitable for a fan of Argentos work but don't be deceived by the countless negative reviews floating around the net.

This movie is hardly the train wreck some want you to beleive.

I was mildly surprised by the turn this legendary director has taken with this new entry.",1127520000,,1317,4.37037037037037
2313844,4,B0009RQRSS,"THE CARD PLAYER isn't Argento's greatest film or ever close to it, but it is miles ahead of the worst (PHANTOM) and in fact would be perfectly entertaining if we weren't expecting something a little, I don't know, more.  More gruesome?  More disjointed?  More garish and flooded with saturated color?

The odd thing is that the film keeps getting better and better as it goes along, the set-pieces building up, the suspense growing, the attachment between the two leads growing stronger and more tender, until you actually believe they're in love.  Stefania Rocca is quite an actress, and as for Liam Cunningham, he's no Liam Neeson but he works well with Rocca, they're quite natural together.  They play two cops from different nations drawn together to solve a case in common, the Video Poker murders, played on a computer from a remote location in Rome, one blocked from police surveillance by firewalls.

The plot calls for the police to secure the services of the nation's best poker player.  But when he sits down to play, you hardly know why.  Video poker must be the world's easiest game.  My cat could have played the poker game with as iuch skill as young Remo exhibits.  Five cards are dealt you, you get to decide which to hold and which to substitute.  Big deal!  You then either win or lose.  It was an odd turn of the plot, but made sense visually I guess, it just seems peculiar that Stefania Rocca couldn't have played poker against ""The Joker"" from the very first victim, instead of dragging in Ramo against his will.  Though the affection between Ramo and Anna was the best part of the film, and the scene where she catches him smoking a joint in the toilet was very sweet (and unlike anything else I can remember in Argento, same with the aftermath of the game in which Lucia's fate is decided).  The young actor who plays Ramo is adorable, thin enough to slip under a doorway, but wily and a ""playa.""  He seems like a little boy until the scene in the cafe where he lets his gonads get him into trouble deep.  I don't know, I've watched Argento's films for a long time and after awhile you notice, the young actors he casts are all like Cadinot gods!  What is the story with that I wonder!?!?!",1127088000,,2215,4.547979797979798
2313845,3,B0009RQRSS,"The premise of this movie is actually pretty interesting and original. As some of the other viewers have noted and as the DVD box states, the plot revolves around a serial killer who taunts police with online video poker - if the cops lose a hand, then (oh man, I can't avoid this one) then the victim loses a hand LOL (sorry) anyway... as I said, it starts out interesting enough, but quickly loses its way. Still I would actually recommend this one for a one-time rental. I think that if Hollywood gets a hold of this one, they should be able to improve on it and make for a much better and more thrilling movie.",1126051200,,614,4.301724137931035
2313846,4,B0009RQRSS,"Dario Argento creates nail-biting suspense in his latest effort, 'The Card Player', about a killer who taunts cops by challenging them to an online poker game. The stakes? For each hand they lost an ""appendage"" is amputated and if they lose three out of five the kidnapped young woman is slaughtered on webcam! Yikes! Nice lead performances by Stefania Ross and Liam Cunningham as Italian and Irish cops who join forces (and more!) to find the killer before he strikes again. Riveting...gruesome and horrifying with Argento's signature way of combining the grisly with the glorious and making art...for example, notice the cadaver at the morgue...she is horrifying while simultaeously looking like some incredible marble statue. Fans of the director will enjoy 'The Card Player' which combines many of his signature flourishes -- gorgeous cinematography, haunting surreal sequences, intense suspense (That slow turn of cards on on on-line poker alone got me going!) and a fantastic score by Caludio Simonetti (of Goblin). Why don't more Hollywood horror directors study this guy?!",1125878400,,1080,5.358823529411764
2313847,5,B0009RQRSS,"When Dario began to form the idea for this film going back a few years I don't think he realized how up to this movie would be for Poker is know the big rage and Dario has taken the rewards of winning to the edge and beyond, His seriel killer is up to date. The music fits right in, the cast gets high marks. Dario does not get to fancy with crazy off beat angles and strange lighting and sets which is his trademark. Do we have a knew Dario? The Card Player is Dario at his best maybe a little more. Buy it or rent it you will not be be in diapair. Welcome back Dario",1125619200,3,568,3.8632478632478633
2313848,5,B0009RQRSS,"How can anyone say that their an Argento fan and no like this movie. I was actually surprised at how good this is. Dario strays from the norm with this one but unlike others have said it is still recognizable as an Argento film especially in the scene when the killer shows up at the main character's house...in the dark. That whole scene was very Argento. Also the music is an electronic score because of the internet theme and Dario wanted to have a connection between those. It's actually pretty good but not his best. Don't listen to these other reviews, just get it, you shouldn't be dissapointed. That one guy doesn't know what he's talking about with the whole not revealing the killer thing, he must have watched a different movie than I did!!

All in all a good movie from Argento but not his best. I think some people will like the change in style on this movie because it shows that Argento can do a movie way from his usual style and pull it off.

***** to off set the 2 star reviews

Next for Dario: 3rd chapter in the three mother's trilogy!",1125100800,8,1055,4.372448979591836
2313849,2,B0009RQRSS,"The movie started off ok and has a good premise to work with, but my wife's comments sum this movie up perfectly.  ""I feel like I walked out of the room and came back to a completely crappy movie.""  I agree with some of the other comments made as well.  Some of the oddball characters tend to distract from the movie even when it is still worth watching.  The ending and everything leading up to the ending was horrible.  There just came a turning point while watching this movie that there was no way it could save itself.

I also agree with the sound factor.  The entire cast seems to mumble through lines and the sound needs to be turned up during conversations, and then immediately turned back down when the music kicks in, etc.

I love horror/thriller movies.  I even love cheesy B movies.  This movie fails to fall in to either category for me.",1125014400,5,851,4.397435897435898
2313850,2,B0009RQRSS,"Definately not one of Argento's best films unfortunately.  I was very excited to get this movie today on its first day of release because I am a big Argento fan but I think he strays away from everything that made him so good in the first place.  It was all to predictable.  He has some really absurd characters like the coroner and the computer genius trying to catch the killer.  The characters speak really bad english and the sound is terrible.  You have to concetrate to listen because of this or you might miss something.  And the Goblin sountrack is nothing like the one in Dawn of the Dead or Demons. All in all I think it is a bad effort.  I feel he needs to get back to his roots like in his other classic movies Demons, Suspiria and Tenebre.",1124755200,5,752,4.290780141843972
2313851,2,B0009RQRSS,"It's sad when influential talents go off the boil, but everything Argento has done since Tenbrae seems to have shown all the signs of a filmmaker who has lost interest but still has bills to pay. On the good side this is nowhere near as bad as Phantom of the Opera or Phenomena. Nor is it as mediocre as The Stendahl Syndrome or Trauma - it just aspires to be that mediocre.

Sleepless might have been a minor comeback - silly but with good set-pieces - but any ground gained is immediately lost with this tepid misfire. Low on gore, low on style, low on character, it's really just an outline for a movie that he hasn't bothered to fill in. Psycho killer kidnaps women and forces female cop with issues to play internet poker for their lives. Fill in the blanks film-making ensues, very dull for the first 80 minutes, almost interesting in the last twenty. But you don't need to see this film. It won't offend, it'll just bore.",1123372800,5,928,4.426900584795321
2313852,4,B0009RQRSS,"This 2008 box set contains 5 DVDs featuring five films directed by Dario Argento. Argento is best known for his giallo (Italian crime mystery) work. The five films: Do You Like Hitchcock?, The Card Player (2004), Trauma, Tenebre and Phenomena. This isn't a collection of Argento's best work. The astounding Suspiria might be considered his greatest work (or at least most accessible) but it isn't included here (nor is it available on Blu-Ray in the US). Each disc in the Dario Argento box set is the full Anchor Bay edition complete with extras. There is a decent amount of bonus supplements but no new content is included. Due to the difficulty of finding Argento's work on DVD or Blu-ray I rate this product 4 stars and the five films get 3 stars.

Tenebre Special Features:
Audio Commentary, ""Voices of the Unsane"", ""The Roving Comera Eye of Dario Argento"", Alternate End Credit Music, Dario Argento Bio, ""Creating the Sounds of Terror""

Phenomena Special Features:
* High Definition Blu-ray and Standard Definition DVD presentation of the Italian cut of the film
* Original Italian and English Stereo Audio, * Brand new subtitle translation of the Italian and optional English subtitles of the English audio
* Dario's Monkey Business: The Making of Phenomena - A 50 minute long documentary featuring interviews with key talent behind the film including director Dario Argento, star Daria Nicolodi, underwater photographer Gianlorenzo Battaglia and more!
* Music for Maggots - An Interview with composer Claudio Simonetti
* Creepers for Creatures - Sergio Stivaletti lives Q&A sessions from Dublin and Edinburgh

Buy this set at the right price. It bounces around but it's probably worth $40. The best in the Dario Argento Box Set would be Tenebre. The worst movie here is Card Player. Phenomena and Trauma are also worth watching. The list price for Tenebre BD is $62.98. Phenomena BD is selling for $69.90. Trauma, Do You Like Hitchcock and Card Player are not available on Blu-Ray at all (they are throw-ins representing Argento's minor work). This set isn't such a bad deal despite it's imperfections. A re-release of this box set on BD with more films and 4 hours of bonus content would be amazing. If you are in love with Argento then check out his exclusive Blu-Ray releases from Blue Underground. There is also a Japanese 3-BD Limited Edition Dario Argento Three Mothers Trilogy box set containing Dario Argento's Inferno, Suspiria, and Mother Of Tears which would be considered better than the films included in this collection. This box set has managed to hold its value well.

A note on Dario Argento Blu-ray discs (not included in this set):
- The Best of Argento (Suspiria, Deep Red, Tenebre). One is included in this DVD box.
- The Major Works of Argento - Phenomena is included in this DVD box.
- The Minor Works of Argento - Three more films are included in this DVD box. Not available on Blu-ray.
- Argento has 8 films and counting on Blu-Ray.
- They are usually but not always region free so they don't always work on all Blu-ray players in the US.
- They are fairly expensive because they have to be imported.
- The quality of the remastering varies but is usually quite good.",1377216000,,3199,4.853479853479853
2313853,3,B0009RQRSS,"I'd recommend this collection to an Argento completist, as an intro to Argento for yourself, or as a gift for someone you know to like off-the-beaten-path horror.  I'm not sure what to say if you find yourself outside of this Venn diagram.

For me to purchase a physical DVD, I prefer it to be a special release or box set.  From this perspective, the collection does not disappoint.  The unique tin case is cool to have on your shelf, and, again, is a pretty good intro to non-early Argento.

Tenebrae and Phenomena are, in my opinion, must-have classics.  The other three films seem to be throw-ins:  check out all the reviews that bemoan The Card Player.

Overall, I'm not sure this collection is worth the full price.  In my case, I found a copy at a 50% discount at a shop that was closing, and am happy with what I got for what I paid.  On the other hand, I do think that buying the collection at full price would be cheaper than buying each individual DVD, so... there's that.",1356480000,,983,4.411111111111111
2313854,3,B0009RQRSS,"The Card Player (2004) is a crime thriller, without the supernatural element often found in Dario Argento's films.  With Argento you expect the unconventional, and the story is built upon a gimmick, where a serial killer operating in Rome, taunts the police, challenging them to play video poker, with the lives of his victims at stake.

The kidnapper contacts the police on the internet, transmitting a video feed showing a woman bound and gagged with tape, to the computer of detective Anna Mari (Stefania Rocca).  The ""Card Player"" invites the police to play video poker for her life.  If they can win three hands, the English tourist will live.  Chicken-hearted police Commissioner Marini (Adalberto Maria Merli) declines to participate, so the killer slashes the hostage's throat, and her body is later found in a river.

Because the victim was English, John Brennan (Liam Cunningham), a policeman from the British embassy, joins the investigative team, and partners up with Detective Mari.  Brennan's forensic expertise provides clues that help him to eventually locate the killer's hideout.  In the meantime, the Card Player continues to abduct young women, and challenge the police.

In response, the police enlist the help of a young poker expert named Remo (Silvio Muccino), to play against the killer.  Initially, Remo is afraid to play, but is later ecstatic, when he manages to defeat the killer, and save the life of Lucia Marini (Fiore Argento, Dario's daughter), the daughter of the Commissioner.  Remo's joy is short lived, as the killer sets his sights on him.

When Brennan goes missing while conducting an investigation, the stage is set for the killer to challenge Anna to one last match.  This final challenge, with the contestants chained to a set of railroad tracks, is more ludicrous than terrifying, as you know exactly how things will end.  It's another example of Argento being overdramatic, rather than sensible.

With the video poker element, The Card Player is on shaky ground from the start, and despite some decent acting performances, it just sinks into a pit of ridiculous goop.  When so few hands are involved, chance plays more of a factor than skill, and it doesn't take a poker expert to win three games.  Poker players are generally quite cool and analytical, but Remo behaves like a scared child, with Anna ridiculously fawning all over him.

The Card Player, has some scary moments, as Argento still has a flair for violence.  The amount of gore is minimal, but the film features some impressive looking fake corpses, which in some instances appear too discolored.  Argento typically looks to wow his audience, but his screenplay isn't very sound, and comes off as being goofy, gimmicky, and overdramatic.  Most of the characters are not well written, particularly Remo and the police commissioner.  After so many years of doing his films in English, Argento's dialog is still weak, and often childish and inappropriate.  Bad dialog has typically been an issue with Italian horror films, often lessening the credibility of the film.  While entertaining at times, The Card Player is also a frustrating watch, and not one of the director's best.

The DVD has some decent extras, including an interview with Dario Argento, and a commentary by author Alan Jones (apparently since Argento's English is not very good).  Jones provides some interesting insights.  The Card Player was apparently originally conceived as a sequel to The Stendhal Syndrome, with Asia Argento set to reprise her role as Anna Manni.  After Asia dropped out, Stefania Rocca was brought on board, along with Asia's half sister Fiore Argento.",1332892800,,3652,5.092436974789916
2313855,4,B0009RQRSS,"Dario Argento's homage to director Alfred Hitchcock, the ""master of suspense"" may be somewhat predictable, but is still a pretty intriguing mystery thriller.  The story focuses on the activities of a film student who suspects that he may have discovered a nefarious plot to commit double murder.  Although a movie for Italian television, with a bit of gore and some nudity, the film has a little more edge than you might expect.  The story stretches reality, but doesn't bend it completely out of shape, and almost manages to avoid an overdramatic finish.  Still, it's pretty restrained for Argento, who has been prone to excess.

Giulio (Elio Germano) seems to be fairly well adjusted.  A film student, he spends his time watching movies, studying, and being with his girlfriend Arianna (Cristina Brondo).  Living alone in a nice apartment, he occasionally picks up a pair of binoculars to look down into the apartment across the street, where young beauty Sasha Zerboni (Elisabetta Rocchetti) lives with her controlling mother.  While in a neighborhood video store run by a fellow named Andrea (Ivan Morales), Giulio observes Sasha and a young woman named Federica (Chiara Conti) have a chance meeting, as both are interested in renting Hitchcock's film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strangers-on-a-Train/dp/0790731029/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strangers on a Train</a>.  Giulio later sees the two women having an animated discussion, and after Sasha's mother is clubbed to death in her home, he begins to suspect that Hitchcock's film may have inspired a murder.

The plot of Strangers On A Train involves two strangers who each want someone killed, and arrange to swap off, and kill the other person's victim, while the suspect establishes an airtight alibi.  Giulio pays a visit to the scene of the crime, and appropriates a letter with evidence that Sasha has come into a small fortune.  Convinced that Federica murdered Sasha's mother, Giulio begins to investigate to prove his theory.  He discovers that Federica is being blackmailed by her boss, but in the process severely injures his leg, and has to wear a cast.  Giulio expects that Sasha will return the favor, and kill Federica's boss, but there are a few more twists yet to come.

As the kind of jumpy Giulio, Elio Germano might not be your first choice for a leading man, but he does a good job here, and has gone on to become a quite successful actor.  The acting performances are generally good, and the typical Italian style of dubbed audio isn't too distracting.

With Giulio hobbling around in a cast, scanning the building across the way through binoculars as Arianna investigates, the film also salutes Hitchcock's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rear-Window/dp/B002RSQGQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rear Window</a>.  The final action scene, with people hanging over the edge of a building, is also somewhat reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vertigo/dp/B00004RCOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vertigo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-By-Northwest/dp/B0045HCJ9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North By Northwest</a>.  Those familiar with the Hitchcock may appreciate the film's flair, and mixture of the expected and the unexpected.  Although there is a wet and wild scene in a bathtub, Argento is less concerned about providing outrageous shocks, and focuses more on telling an interesting story, and the results are both satisfying and entertaining.  Following up the less than stellar&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Card-Player/dp/B0009RQRSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Card Player</a>&nbsp;(2004), Do You Like Hitchcock is a solid if unspectacular return to form for Dario Argento",1331769600,,3908,6.1602209944751385
2313856,4,B0009RQRSS,"Lacking the baroque horror and much of the graphic brutality of Argento's other work, ""Do You Like Hitchcock?"" is, nevertheless, a fitting tribute to the Master of Suspense, even while channeling Brian de Palma via that director's frequent musical collaborator, Pino Donaggio.  Beginning as a direct hommage to ""Rear Window"", ""Do You Like Hitchcock?"" finds nerdy film student, Giulio (Elio Germano) spying on his gorgeous neighbor across the way, a tantalizing young woman constantly berated by her mother.  Is the mother simply a nagging scold, or is there some degree of validity to her behavior?  Later events cause Giulio to ponder this question more deeply, especially after another beautiful young woman befriends his neighbor.  Is it a coincidence that the women have recently rented ""Strangers On a Train"" from the friendly--too friendly?--clerk at the local video store?  When a murder eventually does occur, Giulio, under the skeptical eyes of his down-to-earth girlfriend and flighty mother, decides to play amateur sleuth and get to the bottom of the mystery.  But are events as clear-cut as them seem?  Not in an Argento film, they aren't, and before it's all said and done, Giulio has placed himself in mortal danger, keeping one step ahead of the police investigation while the killer closes in.  Of course, it's all pretty farfetched, but it's also beautifully filmed and extremely suspenseful.

As he lusts after these mysterious femme fatales, gawky Giulio, who has such a lovely, lively, generous-hearted girlfriend, seems undeserving of her company; his constant spying, ostensibly to ferret out a murderer, seems to have an underlying motive that, initially, adds a certain element of creepiness to Giulio's character.  Hitchcock didn't present Jimmy Stewart in quite the same light in ""Rear Window"" because there, Stewart's character was only too happy to shove uber-glam Grace Kelly into the background, not so he could spy on and lust after Miss Torso, but because his libido was the polar opposite of Giulio's in ""Do You Like Hitchcock?"".  Stewart's Jeff was content to spy on his neighbors and imagine what they might, or might not, be up to; sex was the last thing on his mind.  For the youthful, energetic Giulio, of course, sex is at the forefront of his thoughts, so even while he's bedding his girlfriend and chasing these long-limbed model-types around Turin trying to solve one murder and possibly prevent another (possibly his own), we're not completely sure what he really wants from these other women.  Does he want to save them?  Sleep with them?  Prove their guilt or innocence?  Maybe a little of all three.  ""Do You Like Hitchcock?"" may be minor Argento, but it's still better than many ""major"" films ground out by the Hollywood film studios each year (and also better than some of Argento's recent work).  The cast is quite good, and Pino Donaggio's score adds an elegant sense of menace to the goings-on.  For me, it's as much an hommage to Brian de Palma as to Hitchcock.",1327536000,2,3014,5.052525252525252
2313857,4,B0009RQRSS,"This is not a horror movie.  There are no supernatural elements in this movie; however, there is a serial killer.  The killer plays online poker with the police for a chance at saving a victim's life.  If the killer wins then the victim dies.  If the police wins than the victim is set free.  The movie was enjoyable for the most part...although it is rather difficult to believe the police would pull a teenager off the streets to help them play poker??  Also, the killer's motive is awkward, unsupported and feels sort of like the makers of the film just said something like..""oh ok we will use this reason since we can't think of anything else..."".",1324252800,,651,4.568965517241379
2313858,2,B0009RQRSS,"I picked this up at Border's during their final days.  At $10 for 5 films I figured it was a good deal and the comparison to Hitchcock intrigued me.  I admit, although I had heard the name Dario Argento, I was unfamiliar with any thing he's directed.  First problem, these movies are dubbed rather than subtitled.  Any subtlety that may have existed with the original actors is lost with the high school play grade voiceovers.  To be honest, I don't know how much better they might have been given the awful material.  The movies are pedestrian slasher films, perhaps ahead of their time but still repulsive and pointless torture porn.  Comparing Argento to Hitchcock is preposterous.  If the two directors would ever have met Hitchcock could have rightfully said, ""I crap bigger than you"" (thanks Curly  I guess I'll use them as drink coasters.

After completing the set I've decided two of the movies are actually worth watching, ""Do You Like Hitchcock"" and ""Trauma"".  Still not great but at least interesting.",1316217600,,1012,4.859649122807017
2313859,4,B0009RQRSS,"This set is pretty nice and worth getting if you've seen some of other Argento films.  I'd recommend getting Deep Red and Suspiria before venturing over into this set.  I know my review is pretty late, so I assume most Argento fans already have some of these films.  The DVDs for Hitchcock, Trauma and The Card Player seem to be identical to the earlier AB disks.  For those who have the earlier editions of Phenomena and Tenebre, the transfers are better (but not great) and finally anamorphic (although I assume these two disks are the same as the newer Phenomena / Tenebre disks released the same time as this set). The set itself is is a pretty nice metal box which is about the size of a regular DVD case.  I've had this set since its release and the box has held up very well and feels very sturdy.

As for the films, I prefer many of Argento's earlier films than the ones in this set.  Phenomena is probably the best and has a good early Jennifer Connelly performance but it, along with Opera (not in this set), is kind of hurt (in my opinion) by the chose of Argento to move away from the great scores of his earlier films and throw 80s hair metal into the action scenes, to me this sort of feels a little out of place and dates the film.  Don't get me wrong those, both of those films are very good and among Argento's better films. Tenebre is a pretty solid Giallo and is another one of his must see films.

Trauma is good, its also worth watching for an early Asia Argento performance.  I liked the other films in the set Hitchcock and the Card Player but these are later Argento films and sadly for the most part his newer stuff doesn't have the same feel as his older classic films.  They are okay but far from being great.  I don't think those two are at all essential purchases (or watches) but this set is worth getting just for Phenomena and Tenebre (and to a far lesser extent Trauma).",1304726400,,1903,4.314606741573034
2313860,4,B0009RQRSS,"When you watch The Card Player, you have to decide if you are going to see an old-school Argento giallo film, or a newer Argento slash-and-gore fest. I think it's best to plan on seeing a giallo, because as a giallo, The Card Player works.

Argento's giallo movies never had the gore and visceral terror that his slasher flicks have. They are psychological, supernatural thrillers with a mystery at their center, and violence and gore kept to a minimum and used to further the plot, rarely becoming spectacular.

All of the classic Argento giallo marks are there. The story is psychological cat-and-mouse of tracking down a serial killer who decides the fate of victims by whether the police win a game of poker with him. The police are helped by a psychic card player who has a strange ability to win. The Card Player also has the taut dialogue and psychological development of the central characters, the foreshadowing of future evil through stark symbols, and the use of camera angles and shot choice to heighten suspense.

Perhaps returning to his roots was a mistake; Argento hasn't made a giallo since The Stendhal Syndrome, as far as I can remember. But I don't think it was a mistake; I think it's a chance to reintroduce us to a set of classic horror movies--Deep Red, Four Flies on Velvet, and the Bird with the Crystal Plumage.

So, my recommendation is give it a try as a psychological horror-thriller; you may be pleasantly (or horribly?) surprised.",1287532800,,1462,4.766798418972332

2313862,3,B0009RQRSS,"Argento has long been known as the Italian Hitchcock.  Here he pays homage to the legendary director with this made for television thriller.  Although slow paced, it's still a fairly interesting detective story and disturbing example of voyeurism.  It's a low budget affair that lacks much of Dario's trademark inventive camerawork, suspense, or bloody mayhem.  But for Argento fans, you could do alot worse.

This film most notably gives praise to Hitch's Rear Window.  It also pays respect to some German Expressionist horror films, and possibly even Peeping Tom.

Here we have Giulio, a film student with a lifelong penchant for spying on the ladies.  He kind of evolved from a curious little kid to quite the little perv.  His voyeurism eventually gets him in trouble, as there is a murder conspiracy that occured across the street.  Giulio just can't resist the urge of investigating this puzzling case.

Okay, so it's not the most original idea.  But Do You like Hitchcock? showcases some barenaked beautiful women (my favorite kind) along with one bloody murder sequence.  Watching the protagonist spy on his neighbors falls a bit short of the creepy, uncomfortableness it might have been aiming for (at least it didn't bother me, go figure).  Still this is way above average for a television movie, and a solid change of pace for the Argento fan.",1274400000,3,1354,4.986607142857143
2313863,2,B0009RQRSS,"Well I finally tried to watch this 2004 giallo from Argento despite the negative reactions I had read.  This is quite a different hand from the Italian director.  Although not completely horrible, it is quite a step back from Deep Red or Bird with the Crystal Plummage.  Lacking in his trademark camera angles, creepy music, or vicious scenes with high impact brutality, this is actually difficult to recognize as being Dario's work.

The idea of a murder mystery centered around a card game is interesting and could have some potential if developed properly.  Poker is a psychological game of wits that relies on the ability to read other people.  Victim's lives would be the ultimate stakes, and the police ante up and try to outplay this psychopath.

Problem is, the game is video poker?!?  It's outcome is much more oriented around luck.  That eliminates most of the mental aspects. So much for outsmarting the bad guys.
We get to see the games unfold, and the helpless victim is shown via the webcam.  I expected to see some gruesome torture and mutilation scenes, but surprisingly those are all absent.  Bummer.
Even the music here is below Dario par.  It's more of a cruddy techno sound with a synthesizer, to go with the computer vibe.  Different, but hardly creepy or conducive in bringing chills.
The acting was okay, but the cast didn't seem comfortable with the English language.  This movie has some pretty good production values, but no vivid color schemes like we've come to expect.  Everything is sorta bland.

I was also really disappointed by the ending, which dragged down this mediocre film another notch.  Overall, this was a quite a letdown from the Argento's norm.  Passable.",1273708800,,1698,4.8776223776223775

Admittedly, some of this is intentional: it's clear that the old master is attempting to make a `realist' thriller: gone are the crumbling piles of old Rome; the cobwebs and the faded gothic glamour - in are the pastel shades and humdrum reality of everyday modern Italy. This isn't so much of a problem, really, what is is Argento's attempt at a contemporary thriller: trying to wrap his story in what he thinks is the techno babble of today is akin to seeing your Grand Dad break dancing at a family wedding disco. Frankly, it's a little embarrassing. I don't think that Argento needs to shackle himself to the past, but, where before he emerged some of his stories in futuristic (and deliriously unlikely) sci-fi improbabilities, here he's playing with clichs: the internet is so Sandra Bullock; and that thing with the seeds found on the corpses would be great, if it hadn't been pummeled to death already in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (1991).",1266192000,,984,4.760233918128655
2313867,3,B0009RQRSS,"Dario Argento made some of the best giallo murder mysteries of all time.
This isn't one of them; as it is more of a straight forward murder thriller.
It's a giallo in that there is a killer on the loose and he wears black gloves but unlike the classic type of giallo that Dario pioneered,  and over 400 were made from 1969-79, this doesn't have the killings done from the killers point of view. ( a standard of the genre) And the violence is not as in your face as compared to many giallos either.  I did enjoy this movie and I think the criticism in the form of one star reviews is too harsh.  This is not a great movie but it is a good average thriller about a serial killer. It doesn't have much difference from any other directors efforts though; and that is why some of  Dario's fans may not like this one.  But on the whole this movie; while pedestrian, as far as Argento movies goes, still tells a solid story and it has decent acting too.  And I think that Argento made some great movies throughout the 1980's, Sleepless in the 1900's was a great giallo too , although not as great as his earlier output, it was still a cool giallo.  I bet if any other director had made this movie there would less one star reviews because they'd only be expecting a average murder movie. That's what you get here and Anchor Bay does give us a good film print here.  There are some interesting extras and even a interview with the films composer who came up with some of the best horror movie music ever made in films like 'deep red"" and 'dawn of the dead"" with his band Goblin and even on his own after. This music is too electronic for my taste. Electronic music is a musical dead end both spiritually and asthetically compared to music made by a human being playing a instrument. Still it matches the film and is ok for the context. The card player forces the police to play card games or he will hack up his victims. This one doesn't show that where  older films might have making this movie ok for older teens and less squimish adults. If you want a decent murder mystery giallo that's average and has none of the flourishes,timing and great camerawork of the earlier Argentos then this one will be worth your time.  It's NOT a terrible movie it's just a average thriller and I have seen many more worse than a this one.  ALthough Anchor Bay needs to go back into the 1970's vaults and grab some of those classic giallos that have never been released anywhere.",1264896000,,2457,4.331154684095861
2313868,2,B0009RQRSS,"Do You Like Hitchcock? (Dario Argento, 2005)

I like Hitchcock, at least when he was at his thunderous, tyrannical best. I also like Argento, when he is at his giallic, operatic best. Neither of those things is true in this Argento-directed made-for-TV flick, a paint-by-numbers chiller if ever there was one. It says all too much about this movie that despite it paying homage to (or ripping off, your choice) both Hitch and Argento's earlier, better films, most of this reminded me of Sergio Martino on an off day (like when he did Torso). That cannot be good. And, of course, it isn't.

Elio Germano (Nine) plays Giulio, a film student writing a dissertation on Hitchcock. His way-too-hot-for-him girlfriend Federica (Chiara Conti, whom it's far too easy to imagine mouthing Alan Rickman's ""I played Richard III!"" from Galaxy Quest, though in Conti's case it was A Midsummer Night's Dream) is kind of annoyed by his obsession, but puts up with it. Giulio is sometimes distracted by his also-way-too-hot-for-him neighbor across the street, Sasha (Elisabetta Rocchetti, who turned up in Argento's earlier The Card Player), who seems to mind his seeing her naked with binoculars a great deal less than she should. Sasha and her pal Arianna (L'auberge Espagnole's Cristina Brondo, and do I have to tell you she's hot?) drop into the video store where Giuliano spends a lot of his time to pick up Strangers on a Train at one point. Not long after, Sasha's mother turns up dead. Giuliano gets it into his head that events in life are mimicking events on film--Sasha has hired Arianna to kill her mother, and that someone close to Arianna will soon die at Sasha's hands.

And thus, an Argento-style giallo is born, with many, many visual cues to both Hitchcock films (Rear Window, Dial M for Murder, Vertigo, etc.) and Argento films (one scene in particular is an almost perfect recreation of a scene from Profondo Rosso--for those who have seen this and wonder what I'm on about, it's Giuliano scaling the wall, looking exactly like a geekier David Hemmings). Unfortunately, however, this is not the Argento who made Profondo Rosso thirty-five years ago. Back then, he understood the use of humor as a release of tension (David Hemmings' continuing encounters with Daria Nicolodi's car) rather than a substitute for it (the ludicrous Vespa chase scene not long after that wall-scaling bit). More to the point, the timing of the humor is off. And there's an air of adolescent fantasy about the whole thing; Argento the geeky film student being flirted with and/or pursued by (and/or sleeping with) all these incredibly attractive women? Not that it wasn't already, but that scenario was catapulted into the realm of the ludicrous in 1982 (with the advent of 'Allo 'Allo!). As it's close to twenty years later, and Argento is a year older than Gorden Kaye, it's downright creepy if you think about it. (Though, being the same age Gorden Kaye was at the beginning of the series myself, I'll swallow the creepiness and take all the film of Chiara Conti I can get my hands on. That woman is dynamite.) **",1264550400,,3096,4.859848484848484
2313869,1,B0009RQRSS,"The answer to the film's questioning title is, of course, an unhesitant Yes. Alfred Hitchcock's films stand to this day as a testament to his talents, and remain some of the top examples of the perfection of the filmmaking craft. He didn't earn the moniker ""The Master of Suspense"" for nothing, don't you know? What you should ask yourself before treading into this film isn't whether or not you are a fan of Hitchcock's work. The question you should be answering is ""Do you like Argento?""

DYLH starts in 1990 when a young boy bicycling through the woods happens upon and spies on two heavyset women dressed like French peasants as they cackle hysterically while sacrificing a live chicken. The boy is then spotted and chased away by the women before the film switches to modern day. This inexplicable opening is unforgettable not only because it is never fully explained, but because it is the last remotely interesting thing that takes place in the film. By the time the now grownup geeky film student Giulio kinda-sorta solves the murder of the woman across the street, you will be fondly recalling the chicken-killing scene with a deep and unsettling longing for that kind of creative storytelling.

The post-chicken remainder of the film revolves around annoying peeping-tom Giulio and his attempts to solve his neighbor's murder. Most of this involves painfully extended scenes of Giulio spying on women, sporadically interrupted by inane snippets of dialogue and the occasional discovery of extremely lame clues, with the emphasis firmly on ""lame."" Argento's screenplays usually eschew logic and common sense, and DYLH finds him at the top of his illogical game, with the reason behind the real killer's eventual unmasking acting as the cherry on top of this WTF sundae. Honorable mention goes to the unintentionally comical chase scene in which an eighty-seven pound bookworm with a broken leg and stalled scooter is relentlessly pursued through a torrential downpour by a bald linebacker who needs to stop and catch his breath every ten or twelve steps.

Like most of the films from the second half of his career, the world within DYLH is populated solely by the Beautiful and the Ugly. There are no average people walking the almost barren streets of Argento's Italy, only potential underwear models and comically hideous freaks. That the film's chicken-chested voyeuristic hero falls into the latter category is possibly the only real mystery of the film. This bizarre `Beauties vs. Beasts' world view is quickly becoming as much a trademark as his fondness for extreme close-ups and showing the unknown killer's hands and feet whenever possible.

I'm tempted to declare the tragic display of Argento's supposed homage to Hitchcock as the real victim of the film. Argento goes out of his way to squeeze as many Hitchcock classics into the plot as possible; Strangers on a Train and Dial M for Murder are both mentioned by name, while Rear Window, Psycho and Vertigo make painful cameos. He then proceeds to toss around these hastily assembled masterpieces with all the grace and subtlety of a crack head trying to nonchalantly hide his stash while a State Trooper patiently taps on the windshield. For what was supposedly meant to be an homage, Argento only succeeds in doing to Hitchcock's memory what he previously had done to his daughter, Asia Argento, in The Stendhal Syndrome. And that's being nice about it.

But alas, the true tragedy occurs at the end, when Argento tries to inject a deeper meaning by showing Giulio and his binoculars being discovered and casually dismissed by his new semi-nude neighbor, and quickly intercutting a series of flashbacks to all of his previous peeping activities within the film. It's a sloppy last-minute attempt to make the film a message about voyeurism, when the whole sordid affair amounts to nothing more than a filmmaker tragic stab at mimicking greatness.

A final warning; the film's official summary promises a surprising twist at the end of the film. It's a lie, unless the complete lack on anything even remotely resembling a twist was the intended twist. But I have a feeling that would be giving Argento far more credit than he deserves. DYLH is as boring, predictable, and ludicrous as they come.",1263859200,,4266,5.001408450704226

[Il Cartaio]

(Italy - 2003)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital

Detectives in Rome search for a serial killer who forces officers to play online poker games to determine the fate of his/her victims.

A step backwards for Dario Argento following the artistic and commercial success of SLEEPLESS (2000), THE CARD PLAYER represents a deliberate return to the harsh modernism of THE STENDHAL SYNDROME (1995), reconfigured to encompass the ultra-contemporary phenomenon of the Internet. Stefania Rocca and Liam Cunningham are the detectives charged with finding the killer, who mocks them with his/her technological savvy until they hire a street punk (Silvio Muccino) whose own technical skills afford them some degree of leeway, however briefly. There's very little on screen violence, though Argento indulges some unpleasant forensic detail as Cunningham examines various corpses (stunningly realized by effects artist Sergio Stivaletti) for clues to the killer's identity, and the set-pieces are largely routine, except for a startling sequence (recalling a similar scene in OPERA) in which Rocca is stalked through her darkened apartment by the lurking maniac, and Cunningham's stroll through a beautiful garden which may - or may not - belong to the killer, photographed with dream-like precision by cinematographer Benot Debie.

Most of the actors speak English throughout, but some of the performances are compromised by post-synch dubbing: Rocca comes off as a little stiff, and crucial supporting players like Claudio Santamaria (as the fellow detective who harbors romantic feelings for Rocca) and Antonio Cantafora (the police chief whose daughter - played by Fiore Argento - becomes a potential victim) are poorly served by the English dubbing. Only Cunningham emerges with any degree of authority, largely because he uses his own voice throughout. Sadly, despite an eventful screenplay - co-written by Argento and exploitation veteran Franco Ferrini - the movie doesn't really amount to very much, with indifferent plot developments and half-hearted set-pieces. In fact, the entire production is undermined by its central conceit, which involves static confrontations between killer and police via the Internet, and the climactic showdown between Rocca and the killer is further compromised by having Rocca's fate decided on the outcome of yet ANOTHER online poker game!

Perversely, the film is much more satisfying than ""Stendhal"" (the Argento movie it most resembles), but the director has fallen victim to his own success: The technical innovations he pioneered throughout the 1970's and 80's have now been incorporated into mainstream features, pitting him in direct competition with filmmakers whose own work is inspired by Argento's cinematic legacy. SLEEPLESS proved he could rise above such challenges, but THE CARD PLAYER is a step in the wrong direction.",1256688000,,2915,5.583710407239819

I enjoyed DO YOU LIKE HITCHCOCK a lot at first but it got to be a little slow toward the end. All of the characters are great and even the cast was really good. I don't know who any of them are since I'm not overly familiar with Italian actors, but they all do a good job and the women in the film are easy on the eyes. The lead character Giullio doesn't really come off as the perverted type of peepong tom, but more like someone who's just either bored or curious, similar to Shia LeBouf's character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DISTURBIA/dp/B000RO6K9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DISTURBIA</a>. Eventually his curiosity and conspiracy theories began to rub off and I found myself to be really hooked on the story, giving my undivided attention to the film. So as far as being entertaining and keeping my attention, this film did a good job. As far as the directing and filmmaking, if you're a hardcore Dario Argento fan you will notice that nothing in this film has any of his trademarks and it doesn't have the feel of an old school Argento flick, other than the familiar score by Argento's longtime collaborator Claudio Simonetti.

Also something to point out is the fact that a lot of scenes take place in a video store since the lead character Giullio befriends, apparently, the store's only employee. It's a pretty cool setting for a movie to take place in because you can look in the background and try to spot what movies are in the store. Obviously visible are a poster for Argento's other film THE CARD PLAYER and even a DVD copy of his daughter Asia's borderline Porno film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SCARLET-DIVA/dp/B000077VQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SCARLET DIVA</a>.

Overall it isn't the greatest film I've ever seen but it is definitely worth checking out. If you're not familiar with Dario Argento's work, don't let this film be an example of how he is as a director! You need to watch the classics like SUSPIRIA, PHENOMENA, DEEP RED, TENEBRE, etc. Also don't let the whole made-for-TV thing discourage you... this is Italian TV we're talking about. The film has its share of nudity, however the lack of gore was a minor disappointment. It's a fun movie that's worth seeing.

The next game they get someone at the police force whom they believe to be the perfect candidate to play and unfortunately he tries and doesn't even come close thus another victim sadly dies! In the midst of it all the beautiful/sexy main character gets partnered with and predictably falls in love with the sharp straight-laced Irish detective.

The banter between the killer and the main character is painstakingly corny!! And how moronic is it that not only does the killer not even notice when the main character has found the key and freed herself but brags about having a spare all along, tries to use it at the last minute and still gets hit by the train?! How Corny and Stupid is this?!!! Needless to say this ending is better suited to be used as a blooper reel 'cause Me and my girlfriend ""COULDN""T STOP LAUGHING IN HYSTERICS AT THE STUPID MURDERER!

VERY CALLOUS!!

2313877,4,B0009RQRSS,"Folks may gripe about Argento's output over the last decade or so, but he certainly hasn't lost the knack for a good concept.  I don't expect another Deep Red or Tenebre, and why should I?  With a ton of great movies under your belt over more than 30 years, not everything is gonna be primo.
Do You Like Hitchcock? is a little murder mystery Argento made for Italian television.  No, it's not the most original of concepts because the whole theme is based on another director's ideas.  But at the same time, that's also what makes it original.  It's both an homage as well as an Argento film.
The film follows a kind of dorky film student(is there any other kind?) who becomes suspicious of a sexy neighbor.  At a local video store he witnesses a meeting between his neighbor and another attractive woman who both come to rent the Hitchcock film, Strangers On A Train.  He suspects that these two woman have come to a similar arrangement as the two male characters in the Hitchcock film(and if you haven't seen Strangers On A Train, shame on you!).  And in the Argento(and Hitchcock) tradition, our protagonist plays detective and snoops and spies, getting in over his head when he finds out that there is indeed a murder plot going on.  No one believes him of course and he finds himself a target.
This is a relatively common type of scenario with Argento, but this time the Hitchcock influence is cited.  It's the actual catalyst for the mystery.  Argento also mixes in a bit of Rear Window and even a tad of Vertigo.  For a made for T.V. movie, it's very above average.  Not as violent as the average Argento film, but it is a bit bloody for the first murder.

The features are acceptable, but the films speak for themselves: Argento is one of the essential progenitors of modern horror, speaking with a unique style and voice.  His work is pulp, yes, but it's elegant pulp, placing him in league with Carpenter, Romero, and Craven.  They're genre films, but they're good ones.

Special note: Phenomena is far and away the best of these five.  It is notable as an Argento classic, as an early Jennifer Connelly film, as a non-Halloween Donald Pleasence picture, and as one of the most delightfully (and most twisted) unpredictable thrillers I've ever seen.  It's a slasher flick, a supernatural fantasy, and the ending hangs it squarely in a third horror sub-genre that I wouldn't dare reveal here.  If you don't buy the set, buy the Phenomena special editon. If you're interested enough to read this far, trust me: it's worth it.",1214697600,23,1210,4.897058823529412

I've always been fascinated with Jennifer Connelly's performance in Phenomena and Argento's artistic risks are great and profound. The Card Player is not typical Argento shock and gore, but a thriller with gore and plot. I've seen Trauma many times and it has always been ignored and slandered. However, can't ignore Asia Argento's presence. Finally, Do You Like Hitchcock ? is the biggest suprise of all,  I really digged it, This film is a total homage to Hitchcock films and if you have seen Hitchcock, this movie will bring a big smile to your heart.",1214265600,13,672,4.694915254237288

If you love Italian cinema Argento films are a must!! Tenebre and Phenomena are the headliners here. Tenebre was unavailable on dvd for quite a few years and demanded top dollar on eBay ( I paid $35.00). Tenebre and Phenomena are my favorite films in this collection and Tenebre is my favorite Argento film next to Suspiria. Trauma is decent and boasts some great performances. The Card Player is tense and well-made. Do You Like Hitchcock? is very good considering it was made for Italian TV. All have been remastered and cool extras. Oh and I have to mention Argento has a penchant for having some of the best soundtrack music too!! Pick this set up you will not be disappointed. Then pick up all of his other films too!!!
Can't wait for his newer one to hit dvd, Mother Of Tears! I get to see it in the theatres late June  : )",1212796800,13,974,4.3224043715847
2313884,5,B0009RQRSS,"I've always loved a good mystery.  Last year I became a diehard fan of Italian gialli.  They usually involve an unknown assailant, dressed in black, who is killing his/her victims in uniquely gruesome manners while accompanied by a great soundtrack.  Dario Argento revolutionized the giallo with his highly successful directorial debut, ""The Bird with the Crystal Plumage.""  What followed was the Italian giallo craze where every popular film director such as Lucio Fulci, Umberto Lenzi, and Emilio P. Miraglia imitated Argento's work.  Many of them went so far as to give their gialli animal titles such as ""A Lizard in a Woman's Skin"" and ""The Bloodstained Butterfly.""

  In the mid to late seventies, Argento directed supernatural horror such as his masterpiece, ""Suspiria.""  eventually, Argento returned to his giallo roots.  (Praise the Lord!)  What follows is a compilation of his more recent gialli.  I will review them in the order of which they were released.

Tenebre (1982) *****

  This is the first time I've seen ""Tenebre"" and my main reason for buying the collection.  And I wasn't disappointed.  ""Tenebre"" is pure, 100% Italian giallo.  It is the best giallo in this collection.  ""Tenebre"" reminded me a lot of Argento`s earlier gialli, ""The Bird with the Crystal Plumage"" and ""Deep Red,"" in that someone witnesses a murder and they are mistaken as to what they actually saw.  There is also a tremendous amount of stabbing and hacking done with knife and ax, respectively.  Furthermore, someone's traumatic past comes back to haunt them and motivate them to murder again and again.  There are plenty of suspects and red herrings.  Never a dull moment.

  In ""Tenebre,"" the body count is gloriously high and mostly beautiful women are the victims.  Some of the scenes appeared to be taken directly from Mario Bava's slasher fest, ""Bay of Blood.""  Indeed, Lamberto Bava, son of Mario Bava, was an assistant director on ""Tenebre.""

  ""Tenebre"" boasts a great musical soundtrack provided by Claudio Simonetti, Fabio Pignatelli, and Massimo Morante and a great cast that includes one of my favorite actors, John Saxon; he has been in numerous box office horror hits including the original ""Black Christmas,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street, Parts I and III"" and ""Cannibal Apocalypse.""

  ""Tenebre's"" plot is a reflection of Dario Argento's career; his life was once threatened by a fan when he was in Las Angeles.  In ""Tenebre,"" a best-selling author of mystery Peter Neal (played by Anthony Franciosa of ""Death Wish 2"") is harangued by reporters accusing his work of being sexist and exploitative of women.  Argento was criticized in the same manner.  Also, the author is sent threatening letters each time a serial killer murders a woman.  Daria Nicolodi who has been in numerous Argento films plays Anne, Neal's secretary.  John Saxon is Bullmer, Neal's agent.

  If you are a fan of Dario Argento, you must add ""Tenebre"" to your collection.  It is one of the best gialli ever made.

""Phenomena""  (1984) *****

  This was the first Dario Argento movie I ever saw.  I enjoyed it tremendously though I saw the heavily edited American version, ""Creepers.""  Indeed, this movie was very creepy.  Insects give me the creeps.  I never could get this movie, or the name of the director, out of my mind.

  I rented it on a weekend in the mid eighties, along with the high body count shocker, ""Sleepaway Camp,"" and took it over to my cousin's house to watch.  It's a wonder I didn't have nightmares watching these two creep fests back to back.

  ""Phenomena"" stars a very young, very beautiful, and very talented Jennifer Connelly; since then she has starred in a host of hits that includes ""Waking the Dead, ""House of Sand and Fog,"" ""Inventing the Abbots,"" and the horror hit, ""Dark Water.""  Donald Pleasance of ""Halloween"" fame and Daria Nicolodi (""Deep Red"" and ""Inferno"") also star.  Nicolodi was Dario Argento's long time girlfriend and mother of their daughter, Asia.  If you haven't noticed, Argento likes to keep his relatives employed in his movies.  His other daughter, Fiore, also has a minor, but very important, role in ""Phenomena"" as Vera Brandt; she is the Danish tourist who is the first in the movie to be depicted as a victim of the serial killer.

  ""Phenomena"" is a favorite of mine.  It combines elements of ""Carrie,"" ""Deep Red,"" and ""Suspiria.""  Jennifer Connelly is Jennifer Corvino who has a supernatural gift.  She is able to communicate with insects and they sometimes come to her aid, especially when she is being tormented by her classmates.  When she sleepwalks, Jennifer also shares a psychic bond with someone (or something) who is murdering her classmates.  And someone wearing black gloves is committing more murders in order to protect this creature.  This film has a lot of action and suspense.  And the body count is high!  Also, the soundtrack is awesome.  It has numerous songs from several heavy metal bands.  The fact that it was shot on location in the beautiful Swiss Alps doesn't hurt either.  It is a must see for all fans of Italian gialli and supernatural horror.

Trauma (1993) ***

  ""Trauma"" bares many similarities to Argento's masterpiece ""Deep Red,"" one of the most superior Italian gialli ever made.  The most gruesome scene in ""Deep Red"" is the slow decapitation death of the serial killer when a chain is slowly pulled through their neck.  This scene is repeated many times in ""Trauma"" when the black-gloved killer, known in the newspapers as ""The Headhunter,"" leisurely decapitates their victims with mechanically operated piano wire.  The viewer learns that the killer suffered an act of ""trauma"" that propelled them to seek vengeance in this gruesome manner.

  Asia Argento is a bulimic who must hunt for the person responsible for beheading her two parents.  Laurie Piper (who played Carrie White's mother in ""Carrie"") is excellent as Asia's bizarre mom who is performing a s&eacute;ance on the night she loses her head.  Christopher Rydell is the young man who risks everything in order to help Asia track down the serial killer before they can kill their last victims.  Fiore Argento has an un-credited cameo appearance as a receptionist at a psychiatric hospital.

  ""Trauma"" takes a serious departure from reality when a decapitated head utters the name of a doctor before ""dying"" and another head screams as it falls down an elevator shaft.  This last scene was almost comical in its implausibility.  However, this modern giallo does offer some mystery and suspense even if the murders are repetitious.  A nice rock n' roll score would've helped.  Perhaps a score from ""Talking Heads?""

Card Player (2004) ****

  With ""The Card Player,"" the Italian giallo enters the computer age.  Argento said poker is an excellent metaphor for life; he spent a great deal of time researching card games and computer technology.  He gives us a black-gloved maniac who likes to mutilate and kill his victims while the police watch helplessly via the internet web cam.

  Excellent performances are given by Stefannia Rocca and Liam Cunningham.  The beautiful Rocca is the no nonsense, professional Italian police investigator who falls in love with Cunningham even though she claims that she "". . . Never mixes business with pleasure.""  Cunningham is a rogue Bristish police investigator who has an Irish brogue and drinks too much.  If you're a fan of werewolf movies, you've seen him in the excellent ""Dog Soldiers.""  Fiore Argento also costars as the police commissioner's daughter who is kidnapped by the Card Player.

  ""The Card Player"" is very suspenseful, especially in the scenes where the serial killer is playing live on-line poker with the police.  I feel just as helpless and stressed as the lead characters.  Sometimes, I wanted to scream to release the tension.  Claudio Simonetti of Goblin has scored many of Argento's gialli.  In ""The Card Player"" he provides a pounding techno score that is superior to that of Argento's masterpiece ""Deep Red.""  It made me want to hit the dance floor and get down like I haven't done in years.

  Unfortunately, because I have seen so many Italian gialli, I was able to correctly identify the killer very soon and ascertain their motive.  However, this did not prevent me from enjoying the movie.

Do You Like Hitchcock? (2005) ***

  Argento grew up reading Edgar Allen Poe stories and watching Alfred Hitchcock movies.  He is often referred to as the ""Italian Hitchcock.""  It only seems appropriate that he would make a movie in homage to his idol.  Half the fun of watching ""Do You Like Hitchcock?"" is finding the scenes that are reminiscent to such movies as ""Strangers on a Train,"" ""Dial M for Murder,"" and ""Psycho.""  In the film, the walls of a video store are plastered with Hitchcock movie posters.

  Perhaps Argento, as a young man, saw himself as Giulio, a nerdy film student with an overactive imagination.  Giulio also has a penchant for spying on his neighbors; he is often caught in the act and chased away while being verbally threatened with death.  One evening, a neighbor lady is murdered and he suspects that her daughter conspired with another girl to have her killed.

  ""Do You Like Hitchcock?"" is a direct to video release.  It was originally filmed to air on Italian television as a seven-part series made in homage to Alfred Hitchcock.  Lacking big name stars, it has a subdued, made for television feel.  The body count is low and the gore and sex are kept to a minimum.  The only graphic murder scene is when the neighbor has her head bludgeoned with a candlestick holder.  This movie lacks real suspense.  The ""twist ending"" was disappointing.

  Of the five movies in the collection, ""Do You Like Hitchcock?"" is the weakest.  It should have been titled ""Do You Like Peeping Toms?""  Too much emphasis was placed on the lead character's habitual voyeurism.  Despite all that happens to him, he never learns his lesson.

  Overall, the Dario Box Set is a wonderful collection of Argento's latest works from Anchor Bay.  Having preordered it from FYE during a special sale, I paid less for it than some single out of print DVDs.  It was worth the money for ""Tenebre"" and ""Phenomena,"" which I didn't own and had never seen in their original uncut releases.  The other three features were considered bonus discs.  Unfortunately, the five discs do not have individual slim jewel cases like the Mario Bava collections.  Instead, they are placed practically one on top of the other inside a metal box as though they were discs in a box collection belonging to a television series for a single season.  There are no inserts.  However, each disc is loaded with numerous extras.  I wouldn't throw away or sell any individual releases that you may have in your collection.  If you are like me and lack ""Tenebre"" or ""Phenomena,"" or you are a new fan of Dario Argento, I strongly recommend this collection.",1211932800,61,10923,4.9256607929515415
2313885,4,B0009RQRSS,"A psychopath is kidnapping young women, tying them up and forcing the police to participate in games of video poker, with the stakes being the lives of the women.

Yes, I'll admit, ""The Card Player"" is nowhere near as good as the films Dario Argento made while at his peak (the movies made in the period between ""Deep Red"" and ""Opera"", including ""Suspiria"", ""Phenomenon"" and ""Tenebrae"" - let's just forget about ""Inferno""), but few movies are, and compared with other horror movies or even with more recent Dario Argento efforts, ""The Card Player"" isn't all that bad.

Although made in Italy and set in Rome, ""The Card Player"" is made in the style of a modern American crime thriller, rather than that of an Italian ""giallo"". That means that even though a lot of people get tortured and murdered in this film, there isn't the over-the-top blood letting that were the trademark of some of Argento's earlier works. The incredible camera shots that, made ""Suspiria"" a masterpiece, are also noticeably absent. However, the plot is coherent and it kept me interested until the end.

I suspect that this film may have originally been written as a sequel to ""The Stendhal Syndrome"", as the main characters (the female police officers) in both seem to have very similar characters and almost identical names (Anna Mari/Anna Manni). Whatever the case, if you liked ""The Stendhal Syndrome"" you will probably like this movie, and, infact, ""The Card Player"" is the better of the two.",1206662400,,1471,4.876
2313886,4,B0009RQRSS,"NB: For no apparent reason Amazon have chosen to bundle together reviews for completely different Dario Argento films plus a boxed set collection. These reviews refer to The Car Player - 2/5 - and Do You Like Hitchcock? - 4/5

Without revealing the killer's identity, Dario Argento's latest misfire actually climaxes with the villain chaining the heroine to a railway track where he forces her to play internet poker. Yep, as thrillers go this is a premise that needs to be seriously rethought.

The Card Player is another two steps back for Dario Argento after showing signs of improvement in the flawed, very silly but nonetheless very stylish 'Sleepless.' On one level it should be interesting that he has abandoned the gore and the stylistics for a much more subdued style, but in this case for subdued read disinterested hackwork. If you didn't know this was an Argento film, you could easily mistake it for any one of the hundreds of schlock killer thrillers you'll find on some basic cable channels at two in the morning. The plot is serviceable only as a framework for setpiece filmmaking - Stefania Rocca has to stop a serial killer from torturing and murdering women by playing for their lives in a series of internet poker games - but the trouble is that the guignol is nowhere near grand here, let alone grand enough, and Argento films it all with an astonishing lack of panache. The potentially spectacular death of one major character is handled with pedantic disinterest while the other killings are almost thrown away. Plot developments are all exactly as expected and all too easily predicted.

This wouldn't matter so much if the script were better constructed or the characters more interesting, but it's ticking boxes all the way. Heroine with a problem - cop whose father committed suicide over his poker debts: check. Hero with a problem - drunken Oirish cop exiled to the British embassy in Rome for killing a minor in a siege: check. Bit player who is so obviously suspicious it can't be him: check. Likeable character whose death is supposed to be a big surprise but isn't: check. Etc, etc, etc. It's a tame, unimaginatively directed, not terribly well acted movie that plods along for two thirds of its running time before briefly threatening to pick up a head of steam but not quite managing it. Looking at it, you can't help feeling that the only reason Dario made it was because he was running behind on the alimony checks. It's watchable, but nothing more.

Surprisingly, Argento's Italian TV movie Do You Like Hitchcock? is a welcome return to form despite one of the worst DVD covers of all time and a pretty blah pretitle sequence that has no relevance to the film beyond padding out the running time and establishing the hero's voyeurism. Splicing Rear Window and Strangers On a Train, originality isn't on the menu (unless you count the killer wearing white gloves instead of the usual black ones that feature in Argento's previous films: who says he's afraid to try something new?) but along with a strong narrative, a good visual sense and an effective score from Pino Donaggio, you can really feel the playful enthusiasm with this one (somewhat borne out by some backstage footage of Argento getting caught up in the shoot).

The plot makes a virtue of its familiarity: after seeing one of his neighbors and a stranger bond in a DVD store - which only stocks old movies, mostly Hitchcock, German Expressionism and the odd Argento (Dario and Asia) - over a copy of Strangers On a Train, our typically Hitchcockian mother-dominated voyeur's curiosity turns to suspicion that they may have been using it as a blueprint when the mother of one gets murdered. Mind you, I'd regard Elio Germano's lead with some suspicion himself if only because no self-respecting film student would watch silent German Expressionist classics in widescreen. From there on you can tick off the references - yes, our hero does end up with a broken leg while his girlfriend searches the killer's apartment, and yes, there is a Hitchcock blonde - but it's executed with some panache and a sense of fun that never descends into outright comedy.

Unfortunately although, as usual for Argento, the film was shot in English and while at least a couple of the cast are more than passable in the language, for some reason the whole thing has been redubbed in London by what sounds like rejects from a Clearasil commercial: a couple in particular are so strikingly inept that they'll almost have you cursing the invention of talking pictures. They obviously couldn't get the rights to use the soundtrack of Strangers On a Train either, leading to one hysterically awful bit of dubbing when our hero watches the film with his girlfriend. Despite these and some casting quibbles, the film is strong enough to overcome. It's no all-time great but it is a surprisingly satisfying giallo - you won't be surprised, but you probably will be entertained. Suddenly the prospects for Argento's concluding part to his Three Mothers trilogy, The Mother of Tears, don't seem quite so bad...",1203206400,,5081,4.847926267281106
2313887,4,B0009RQRSS,"There is no denying that Dario Argento was at his peak in the late 70's to early 80's. The films he made between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deep-Red/dp/B000KRNG4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deep Red</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Opera/dp/B000S0GYRK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Opera</a>&nbsp;are not just the best films of his career, but are some of the best horror films ever made. Unfortunately, after that he started putting his daughter, Asia Argento (who couldn't act her way out of a paper bad), in the lead, and his films started to deteriorate in quality. In recent years, however, his films have started to return to form (possibly because Asia Argento is now starring in American films and not Argento's own films), and although not up to the same standard as ""Suspiria"", ""Do You Like Hitchcock?"" is actually a pretty good film.

""Do You Like Hitchcock?"", as the title suggests, is Argento's homage to Alfred Hitchcock. The plot is one part ""Strangers on a Train"", one part ""Rear Window"", with a dash of ""Vertigo"" thrown in for good measure, and it's fun to watch all of the film references that are littered throughout the movie.

The film was made in Italian and dubbed into English, although there is no option to watch it in Italian with English subtitles (much to my annoyance). Also as this film was made for television, there is far less violence than in some of the earlier Argento films. Still, for Dario Argento fan, this film is a must and you shouldn't be too disappointed.",1199577600,,1601,5.584362139917696
2313888,4,B0009RQRSS,"Coming off The Card Player, which many see as Dario Argento's worst movie I went into Do You Like Hitchcock with very low expectations. For the longest time I actually avoided the movie. Argento is without a doubt one of my very favorite filmmakers and quite possibly my favorite horror filmmaker.

While many might disagree with me I feel Trauma was his last great movie and The Stendhal Syndrome is last really good movie. Since his career has been average or downright terrible. I couldn't see this being any worse than The Card Player, but I didn't think I could watch one of my Idols continue his fall from grace.

But I have to say I actually really liked this movie a lot. When it comes to the legacy of Dario Argento Do You Like Hitchcock will probably not even get a mention, but this was a really surprisingly good movie.

After watching Do You Like Hitchcock the first thing that I thought was Dario Argento still sort of has it. This may not be Argento at his very best and while it doesn't compare to his classic films I do believe this movie can stand proud in his body of work.

I guess it was only fitting Dario Argento would do a movie like this since he is called the Italian Hitchcock. You get a little bit of Strangers on a Train, Rear Window and Dial M for Murder mixed with Argento's style.

The screenplay by Dario Argento & Franco Ferrini was rather solid for the most part. Most fans will say the screenplays to Argento's movies aren't the strong point, which is sort of true. I found a lot of his early work well-written, but in general while his scripts weren't bad they could be seen as his only weakness. Do You Like Hitchcock isn't the best screenplay ever written, but I think it was a solid one.

There were some touches of comedy and I found it rather amusing at times. Since the plot is inspired by the films of Alfred Hitchcock the mentions of his movies as a fan were also a lot of fun. Overall the script is interesting enough to keep things moving along.

The biggest complaint is the lack of violence, but I didn't mind it at all. This was far less violent than Argento's work prior, but what it lacks in violence it makes up for in suspense. Though the first murder, which comes about 20-minutes in is kinda bloody.

I also think it just might be one of the best kill scenes in a movie by Argento. The whole set up was classic Argento, which is another reason why I think Argento still has it. While he may not be the filmmaker he once was he still can deliver the goods.

This may not be a return to grace for Dario Argento, but it's still in my opinion a solid flick with some nice twist and turns. Don't go in expecting another Deep Red or Tenebre. Take the movie for what it is and I think you might find yourself enjoying it.

The visual side Do You Like Hitchcock looks good; Argento could possibly be the best visual filmmaker out there and of course he delivers here, but it's toned down a bit and he doesn't use the wild angles or colors he did with Suspiria, but Do You Like Hitchcock still looks good

In closing, Dario Argento may not be the filmmaker he once was, but I do think he has a lot left to offer us. This may not be one of Dario Argento's all time greats, but for the most part it's a well made flick with some pretty good suspense and tension. Like I said don't go in expecting another Deep Red or Tenebre. Just take the movie for what it is and you mind find yourself enjoying it.",1192406400,,3445,4.2684049079754605
2313889,4,B0009RQRSS,"This might really be more of a 3 star film really but given how bad Argento's previous film, the Card Player, was, I was so greatly relieved that this turned out to be pretty darn enjoyable that I'm upping it a star.  There's a danger here in building up expectations unfairly: this is a fun diverting movie but it's not one for the ages so just don't anticipate too much and you should have a good time.

The odd thing about this film is that it should almost be called Do You Like De Palma?  Because it most closely resembles the sort of postmodern puzzles that De Palma was once concocting when he was building films out of intriguing derivations from Hitchcockian scenarios and stylistic conventions, taking Hitchcock's themes and modernizing them, pushing them further than the originals in graphicness and in contemporary techniques and attitudes.  In fact, the film this reminded me of most was Body Double more than any actual original Hitchcock film, through its deliberate referencing and quoting and its continual meta-commentary on films and filmmaking.  Like Argento, De Palma himself has gotten less and less reliable as time has gone on and has made a lot of so-so work as the 80s turned into the 90s and into the 21st century.  As De Palma has moved away from Hitchcock, his films have lost their focus and personality so that only the Hitchcockian Femme Fatale really stands out as a true ""De Palma"" film since 1992's Raising Cain.  Similarly, this is probably Argento's most satisfying film in its totality through a comparable fifteen year period, though admittedly it is not particularly brutal by his standards and lacks the accomplished visual stylization of his glory days that made him the Bertolucci of the horror film in the 70s (this was apparently shot for Italian TV so a more appropriate basis of comparison might fairly be Dario's early Door into Darkness episodes).  Both directors might profit from returning back to basics in figuring out where to go from here.  And this modest thriller is a pretty good sign from Argento that he could still pull himself out of his rut.  It's not a major work by any stretch of the imagination but it's a solid diverting picture with some well done scenes and good drawn-out suspense.

So, the bottom line is probably Do you like old Argento or old De Palma?  If so, give this film a shot; it's not bad, not bad at all.",1170028800,,2388,4.7139423076923075
2313890,1,B0009RQRSS,"I'm very surprised to see some of the positive reviews this has gotten and I feel it's a duty to offer an honestly negative counterpoint for anyone considering spending money on this who might have high expectations based on Dario Argento's reputation (though I expect some uncritical fans will consider this sort of thing sacrilege and hit the not helpful button immediately).  Argento's best work from the 70s in both the giallo and the supernatural horror genres is truly some of my favorite filmmaking of all time, which makes the undeniable decline in quality of his work since Opera all the more painful.  I actually, despite their failings, do like certain things about Stendahl Syndrome and Sleepless (and the subsequent Do You Like Hitchcock?); the Card Player, however, just falls short in too many different ways to ignore and make any excuses for.

There are very few striking visual flourishes here, almost none of the amazing camerawork and staging that mark Argento's classics; the look of the film is strangely generic and undistinctive, without the strong personality and drive Argento used to convey through his material.  The violence here lacks the truly inspired perverse qualities that characterize many of the classic murders and extreme outbursts driving earlier films.  The acting by the female lead is compromised by her obviously limited abilities with English, which extends to other members of the cast; the dialogue is not particularly well written but far worse when rendered badly by non-native speakers (though the guy who I think is actually English doesn't actually fare much better).  There are numerous scenes throughout that are even poorly staged and ineptly exected and only two that strike me as genuinely suspenseful in any way; where other Argento films have a hypnotic dreamlike rhythm, this film just feels clumsy and meandering.  The ending is weak and the cumulative impact of the film on the viewer is about none at all.  As a police procedural by anybody, this does not compare favorably with other much better films in a fairly crowded field; if anything, it feels like a made for TV production or an extended R-rated episode of a routine cop show.

Like many people, I keep hoping for a return to form from Dario (Terza Madre anyone?).  With almost every project, rumors fly that this one is the one.  Well, the Card Player definitely was not it.  If you are a fan of Argento's past work, better to skip this completely.",1170028800,15,2471,4.970873786407767

The film is not only homage to the master of suspense films, but it also is a surprisingly good thriller cleverly developed from the concepts in several of Hitchcock classics such as ""Rear Window"" and ""Strangers on a Train.""

Giulio is a film student living in Turin, who occasionally watches Sasha, beautiful woman living in the room across the street. One night Sacha's mother is brutally murdered. Apparently it was done by a robber, but Giulio alone knows some secrets anyone else does not know. One of them is that before the murder she was having a conversation with another lady at a local rental video store, and both of the women seem interested in Alfred Hitchcock films.

You don't need any more summery of the plot, nor Giulio. Being a film student Giulio knows the story of most of the Hitchcock movies, and can predict what may happen next. He rather stubbornly insists on his theory that his girlfriend does not take seriously, and gets involved in the case more than he should.

First let me tell you something about the director's trademarks. Dario Argento's lavish visual style is certainly here, but you don't find much gore or violence. You will still see the close-ups of seemingly unimportant things (like a key in the keyhole) and will find the film's opening chapter unnecessary, but Argento fans would find the master's distinct touch in them. You also hear the curiously enticing music of Pino Donaggio, but Argento's technique is more restrained than usual. The script is more tightly written, but except for several thrilling moments (like Giulio riding a motorcycle running in the rain), the film fails to build up the tension we expect from this kind of suspense.

Still the film is largely well-acted (even though English-dubbed) and entertaining, will certainly keep us guessing until the end. Worth watching if you like either Argento or, of course, Hitchcock.",1167955200,3,1992,4.972972972972973
2313892,3,B0009RQRSS,"The subtitled version may lessen the schlockiness of this piece, but I haven't seen it, and by all accounts I've heard that it's much better than the atrocious English dub which is offered on this disc.

Anyway, the film is a fun, silly throwaway tv movie with a fair amount of nudity and violence.  The lead, Elio Germano, is decent as is the suspense.",1158624000,,353,4.5
2313893,4,B0009RQRSS,"Many of Argento's films over the last 20 years have left me feeling various degrees of disappointment and dissatisfaction.  While elements of many have been good, the movies as a whole do not stand up to his better work.  For the record, the most satisfying Argento film for me, start to finish, is Tenebrae.  His most recent American released DVD, The Card Player, really left me feeling sad.  It contained none of his trademarks - brilliant cinematography, interesting set pieces, and that surreal quality to the action that lets you know you're inside an Argento giallo.  I just rented his latest American release (nods to Anchor Bay) last night, and for the first time in a long time, I watched from start to finish and felt a deep sense of satisfaction afterwards.  No disappointment, no lingering feelings of lost opportunities.

During many scenes of ""Do You Like Hitchcock?"", the action and situations more closely resemble DePalma's Hitchcockian homages than the work of Hitchcock himself.  And that's a good thing, because I've always thought no one does fake Hitchcock better than Brian DePalma.  As the previous reveiwer noted, Argento pays tribute to several Hitchcock classics throughout - framing it all inside a Rear Window set piece.  At one point, our hero even breaks his foot and is confined to a cast, bickering with a girlfriend who at first thinks he's crazy and then realizes he's not.  Of course neither actor is of the caliber of Stewart and Kelly, but they give solid performances.

This Argento movie is less bloody than any of his movies since Bird With the Crystal Plumage and relies more on good old-fashioned genuine suspense without the bizarre murder scenes.  I found that change refreshing.  I did not realize the movie was made for Italian TV, as noted by the previous reviewer.  Perhaps this forced Argento to go back to basics, so to speak, and build a coherent plot that utlizes atmosphere moreso than the killer's bloody knife.  All in all, high applause for ""Do You Like Hitchcock?""  Recommended for fans of Argento, Hitchcock and DePalma.",1155945600,2,2080,4.931034482758621
2313894,1,B0009RQRSS,"Barely gave it two stars but this film is dull. Although it took a different approach, this film had nothing there for me. Wow, a killer taking hostages for a poker game. I'm really dumbfounded other than that. NEEDLESS TO SAY IT WAS BAD BUT NOT HORRIBLE. AND WHAT THE HELL IS WITH ALL THE DUBBED ACCENTS?

IF THE VIEWER WANTS TO SEE BLOOD AND CREATIVITY, DON'T PUT THIS IN YOUR DVD PLAYER!!",1149638400,5,391,4.3561643835616435
2313895,4,B0009RQRSS,"I guess I'm one of the odd few who found this movie enjoyable.  Yes, it's definitely a thriller not a horror movie as so many others have pointed out, but don't let that disappoint you.  Dario Argento comes up with his usual cast of odd characters, who all have their dark sides to them that aren't immediately shown.

The poker games between the killer and the police do tend to be drawn out, showing every hand and every card turn, but that's just an attempt to add to the suspense.  The victim can be seen and heard, right down to their agonized screams as the killer makes good on his promise to cut a piece of them off for every hand the police lose and then killing the victim if the police lose the game.

The gore factor is minimal, which is surprising for an Argento film, but there are some true moments of suspense, such as the break in on Anna's, the main character, apartment, that keep the movie going.

I would definitely recommend this movie to Argento fans as well as those who like a good thriller.",1145750400,3,1016,4.349206349206349
2313896,3,B0009RQRSS,"This movie is a cut above the average thriller (pun intended). But it is not memorable and doesn't give anyone a real reason to watch it over and above filling a few idle hours.

I'm not sure who the audience for this film would be. I haven't seen other Argento films, but I gather he has a reputation as a director of Grimm's Fairy Tales-like gore fests, and this film is not in that genre. It is closer to being a modern police procedural. So I don't think died-in-the-wool Argento fans would like it.

It makes a bid to attract poker players. Throughout the story, it tries to insist on the theme that - poker is like life. But that certainly inflates the significance of poker, at least poker as played on a poker slot machine or a video screen. There isn't much you can do by way of reading your opponents' ""tells"" - there isn't much psychology of any kind that you can exercise with a programmed video game. So the police department's urgent recourse to the services of a young man who has made a reputation winning at video poker - doesn't seem necessary. His protestations that it ""really is all luck"" should be taken seriously. There is no mystical skill he can bring to bear. Any police detective remotely familiar with what hand beats what hand could logically have done as well pitted against the poker-playing fiend.

To understand the final sequence, you do need to know a slightly more obscure point about poker hand hierarchy. But this isn't the same as convincing us that skill at video poker is the ultimate skill that will allow good to defeat evil.

Finally, people who enjoy watching movies set in unusual locales might be drawn to this film. And some of the action does take place in parts of Rome that are off-the-tourist-track. But there aren't enough of these views into Rome's byways to warrant watching the whole film.

SPOILER SPOILER SPOLIER

Also, the film feels rather loosely cobbled together. The DVD commentary does in fact reveal that Argento had three separate endings and three separate villains in mind. And the issue of which to choose was resolved at the last moment based on what would be visually most arresting and most filmable given Rome's traffic conditions - rather than on anything integral to the storyline.

END OF SPOILER - END OF SPOILER

The two lead actors do have interesting, intelligent faces, and they win our sympathies.

What's more, there are some truly taut scenes here, as when the heroine bends down to peer intently into a reflecting globe on her coffee-table - to catch glints of what is going on behind her. There's also a memorably eerie scene that unfolds as the camera follows one of the detectives down a garden lane, with unnaturally innocent-looking seed pods drifting languidly all around him.

For the most part though, there is no compelling reason to watch this film. I wouldn't fold if I found myself holding it on an otherwise empty night. But I certainly wouldn't raise. I guess the coasting term of ""checking"" it out is about right for how to play this film.",1138406400,3,3039,4.663551401869159
2313897,4,B0009RQRSS,"The Bad

There are a couple of minor plot contrivances.

The camera lingers a bit to long and close on some of the dead victims giving us to much time to analyze the latex bodies.

There is some occasional clunky dialogue.

But the main distraction in this film is that almost all the peripheral actors seem to be novices, inept or were given no direction and it shows. I suspect that some may have been the financial backers of the film and were thrown a part in the movie.  The police chief is particularly bad as well as a blond woman who seems to be literally reading her lines off a piece of paper in front of her. The voice looping for these actors was sub par as well.

- Spoiler -
Killer's motives are ultimatly unconvicning and contirved - making him/her just a prop.

The Good

An engrossing and for the most part a good coherent plot. Very good performances by Stefania Rocca and Liam Conningham who were either not not dubbed or were looped extremely well using their own voices.  Most of the actors appear to have been speaking English whether dubbed or not. The two main characters are likable and interesting.

Top grade photography.

Deliberate and well paced suspense and tension along with a couple unexpected twists. The tension and suspense was legitimate and Hitchcock-like with the use of plot, acting, camera movement, editing and music  - thankfully not due to the use of gore and special effects.

There is an interesting use of a good electric music score that ressembales a computer game soundtrack.

In some ways the film reminds me of the style of the new Korean suspense films with a dash of European and CSI.

Unlike others - I did not pick up on the killer until he/she was revealed near the end. I was surprised and I felt the alibi was clever to lead us away.

-Spoiler -
 There is an updated for the generation X crowd, Perils of Pauline ending.  This involves the heroin being tied to train tracks along with computer - and it is terrific!

The anchor bay DVD is from a excelent wide screen film stock, and has super dolby sound and lots of extras.

Bottom line - The Card Player was very nice surprise - Its true that it is somewhat flawed but otherwise is a very watchable, engrossing, tense, suspenseful who-dun-it

The film, the director, photographers, composer and the two main actors do not deserve some of the horrendously bad reviews that I have seen on Amazon.  This film is definently worth checking out.",1134000000,,2451,4.560640732265446
2313898,4,B0009RQRSS,"`The Card Player' directed and co-authored by leading Italian filmmaker, Dario Argento is quite different from what I expected, based on Argento'' reputation based on his best known film, the horror classic, `Suspiria' of about 20 years ago. This movie is much less Wes Craven and much more Alfred Hitchcock, although I think Argento does not quite measure up to the Great Hitchcock in his use of subtlity and surprise, although there are a few good surprises in this film.

While this movie was made by a thoroughly Italian cast and crew, except for Irish actor, Liam Cunningham, almost all the original dialogue as we hear it in the film was spoken in English as it was filmed. Mistaking this for a horror film was easy based on the cover art and some of the blurbs on the package. And, these hints are not entirely misleading, as there is a fair amount of intentional horror based on a fairly extended threat of death to a victim seemingly unable to free herself from the situation, unlike Hitchcock's secret threat, suddenly sprung on the unsuspecting victim as in `Psycho'.

The mechanics and most business of the story are ultramodern. The victims are kidnapped, bound, and gagged (albeit a bit amateurishly), and the perp sends an e-mail to a female police detective that in order to free the vic, the police will need to have someone play computer poker with the perp, freeing the vic by winning two out of three hands. The first victim is a British tourist, bringing the Irish detective attached to the UK consulate in Rome into the case. And, this detective happens to be a forensics expert, so a lot of his early investigations are straight out of the `CSI' casebook. Although, none are so modern that you couldn't see almost the identical business in a movie made 50 years ago, just as you see them in the murder / suicide investigation scene in Fellini's `La Dolce Vita'.

Not only is the plot much more a thriller than a horrorshow, but the quality of the acting, directing, and camera work is high as well. Unfortunately, I feel the writing, in the implausibility of many plot turns, is just a bit too weak. While Argento may be one of the best known Italian filmmakers working today, his scripts fall far short of the great plot and dialogue of Fellini and Bertolucci.

One of the very first weaknesses is in the way the police failed to play the contact with the perp. Given the chance to bring in an expert poker player to play the hands, that task falls whilly nilly to the female detective who is not only a poor poker player, but has a monkey on her back about gambling and poker, as her father committed suicide after a failure at cards. For the second kidnapping, the police happen upon a detective who knows something about poker, but who fails nontheless. Only with the third victim do the police enlist the assistance of an expert computer poker player, who succeeds in effecting the release of the victim.

Explaining more implausabilities starts to give away some of the better parts of the plot, so I will stop there and note that this DVD has my very favorite feature, an audio commentary running the entire length of the film. The commentary is by the cinematic author, Alan Jones rather than by the director or his co-author or producer, but it's pretty good. Since, as the commentator notes, Argento does not film in any of the well-known tourist locations (except for a brief glimpse of the Pantheon and a scene in the Tiber), but in the `real' bourgoise' Rome. So, commentator Jones gives us an orientation for where we are in Rome and on the events which help us understand the plot. He also points out the virtually total absence of blood in the film, which was a concious decision by the director, since so many of his other films are so singularly bloody.

This is a good film, especially for fans of suspense. The few horrorific scenes are relatively tame compared to things like `Saw', but effectively done in the context of the story. It is not quite Hitchcock and it is certainly not Fellini, but quite enough to give you a few chills.",1133568000,5,4078,4.625690607734807
2313899,2,B0009RQRSS,"This is not a horror movie, more like a police drama with some graphic images.  The police receive an email invitation to play online poker from some loony who calls himself The Card Player.  The wager in this game is a girl he's kidnapped.  Cops win and she goes free, they loose and she dies.  Naturally to create some excitement the killer starts going for the police.  Yawn.

Good for a few chuckles (especially the music in the  grand finale), but for the most part boring.  My favorite scene is when some cops are looking at a map of the United States but Atlanta is located in Arkansas and Dallas is way over by El Paso!",1132963200,3,627,4.344827586206897
2313900,2,B0009RQRSS,"Argento always has SOMETHING up his sleve, but this toned-down, pretty much bloodless film is more like a TV movie. And the poor acting, awkward and silly dialogue and bad pacing/editing really got on my nerves after a while.

Any film that features the Internet or e-mail has a real challenge because watching people type or watch a computer is boring visually. And Dario doesn't try to make it interesting...so we watch EVERY SINGLE HAND of poker play. And we watch EVERY SINGLE CARD TURN OVER. And throughout it all, some chick is screaming and whimpering on the screen. This was the weakest part of the film.

The BEST SCENE (___SPOILER ALERT!! ___) was the female cop when she was home alone and someone breaks in. That was actually a bit frightening and suspensful.

But overall, this was the type of film that any hack TV writer could dream up and certainly didn't feature any of the Argento camera work, use of color, or sense of character we're learned to appreciate.

Of course, Argento fans MUST see it / own it, but it's just not that great.",1132185600,5,1053,4.614973262032086
2313901,4,B0009RQRSS,"In deciding to go for a very different and toned down style, Dario Argento certainly took a gamble(get it?).  You're gonna see some harsh reviews here, but Argento's harshest critics are always his biggest fans.  Most folks figure something really got lost in the shuffle when Argento did this one.  No, it certainly isn't Argento's best work, but a subpar Argento movie is miles ahead of any suspense film Hollywood tries to make.  The plot is Argento to the hilt, dealing with a psycho who's not playing with a full deck.  It's pretty much a giallo updated to the 21st century.  Only this time, the black gloved killer plays online poker with the police, and if the killer wins the game, his female victim cashes in her chips via webcam.  Yes, it does sound better than it plays out, but a director can't be expected to crank out a masterpiece each time.  Argento's been in the game a long time and made valuable contributions to the genre, I figure he can make whatever he damn well pleases.  He says himself in the dvd interview that he was trying for a more modern type of film using pretty much only natural light, which is quite different for him.  Gore is also toned down quite a bit.  The most gruesome images pretty much all have to do with the victims' bodies and the forensic work done on them.  And yes, Argento didn't do such a hot job with keeping you in the dark about the killer's identity.  It's pretty easy to figure out which is unusual for his films.  Regardless of it's shortcomings, I did like this film quite a bit.  It does manage some suspense and the concept is very creative.  Is Argento trying to go mainstream with this one?  I actually saw this at Lackluster video!!  No, I don't think he's looking for mainstream success, I think he just wanted to try something he hasn't tried before is all.  I think Argento is still the man and he's still got an ace up his sleeve that he has yet to play on us.",1129939200,,1929,4.413597733711049
