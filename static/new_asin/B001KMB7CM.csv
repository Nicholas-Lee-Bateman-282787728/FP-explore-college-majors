3666545,5,B001KMB7CM,Best film in a long time. Story that every American should see to realize what damage media does to lives of so many people. Eye opening movie.,1239580800,2,143,4.333333333333333
3666546,5,B001KMB7CM,"Mustafa is like so many other Americans-struggling and trying to do the right thing. Of course, his life (and the lives of his families) is complicated by the troubles of the day. Americaneast tells a heartfelt story of coping with the adversity of sharing an ethnic background with the enemy of the day.

We need more movies like this. Too few people in this country give any thought that American immigrants are people just like them with their own hopes, dreams, and problems. Americaneast addresses those thoughts and is entertaining at the same time. I highly recommend this movie.",1235260800,8,586,4.91919191919192
3666547,5,B001KMB7CM,"I can't emphasize enough the importance of this film's message which is really about tolerance, understanding and respect. The actors have done a great job in portraying very complex Arab characters who are caught up in the frenzy of post-911 America. They face many obstacles when encountering prevailing stereotypes about who Arabs are and how they are perceived in general. While at the same time, they are also questioning their own personal prejudices as they try to assimilate in American society. The mix of actors is perfect; they all work very well together to drive home the message that we are all human beings deserving of respect and understanding if only people would listen and not be quick to rush to judgement. I very highly recommend this film.",1233360000,10,762,4.9609375
3666548,5,B001KMB7CM,"I saw this film in the theatre once and another time at a film festival.  It is amazing.  It dealt with important issues but still was entertaining with great performances from Tony Shalhoub, Anthony Azizi and the rest of the cast.  It also has the guy from the movie ""The Visitor"" (I think his name is Haaz Sleiman) who was very funny.  I think its not in the theatre anymore so I would highly recommend buying this.",1232496000,9,417,4.376623376623376

It proves once again that we are all human regardless of race, religion, or color. We all bleed red.",1510876800,,178,4.235294117647059
8315348,5,B001KMB7CM,"This is a must-see film to tell us, or remind us, of the difficulty and complexities of being an Arab in America. The movie isn't a masterpiece of film-making, but it is well-done for the budget and limited locations. The movie squeezes in several stories of Arab-Americans and their friends, co-workers and acquaintances. It is unrealistic to think that so much drama could happen in such a short time. However, if you can overlook that minor point, you will see a wide variety of attitudes and situations well-acted by a great cast. Beyond that, it's overall a positive message about about good people trying to make a better country.",1463702400,,636,4.844036697247707

8315351,4,B001KMB7CM,"I give anyone five minutes of ""speech"" before I decide if I like and agree with individuals. If individuals, Muslim or otherwise resemble this actor, then he's peaceful and I'm ""okay"" with her/him living in the ""Freest"" nation on our good Earth. But it only takes 5 minutes. This was a very informative film, I liked it. But Muslims are in ""America's"" test lab, proving grounds! We live in a very dangerous world, it's time Islam takes its turn to strut their peacifull intentions. GOOD LUCK, you'll need it. Thanks Mr. Sayed !",1430352000,,527,4.67741935483871

8315353,5,B001KMB7CM,"To walk in another man or woman's shoes, that is what this movie brings to viewers.  If you wanna get an unfiltered perspective of what post 9/11 Arabs living in America face day to day, American East walks the walk.  With a good mix of history, humor and in your face ""media and the middle east politics,' this movie takes you there.  It gives you the good, the bad and the ugly of what it means to be an Arabic immigrant trying to make good in these United States of America.

The movie shows the anger, fear and ignorance of Americans immediately following 9/11.  But I thought more importantly it shows one Muslim man's patience and forgiveness toward friends, family, fellow Muslims and America's prejudice.  A movie that shows us there is hope for peace amongst good men of all beliefs.  Superb Acting!",1391731200,,808,4.608391608391608
8315354,5,B001KMB7CM,"This movie portrayed what actually goes on in this country when it comes to people that society is afraid of, from Arabs to blacks to immigrant.",1365984000,,144,4.576923076923077
8315355,1,B001KMB7CM,"Amazon describes this movie with the words: ""A wild weekend is in store for three high school seniors who visit a local college campus as prospective freshmen.""

This movie isn't about that at all! So, to say the least, we were disappointed.",1357948800,2,241,4.738095238095238
8315356,4,B001KMB7CM,"A minor misunderstanding at the LAX airport gets Mustafa, owner of Habibi's Kebab and Falafel restaurant in East Los Angeles, under questioning of the FBI for suspicious behavior.  It's post-911 and Americans are on high alert, and Arabs are easy targets, even those just at the airport to pick up visiting relatives from Egypt.

What follows are the oftentimes stereotypical exchanges between clientele at Habibi's:  a radical Jordanian Murab, business partner Sam (a Jew), an Iraqi Christian and several orthodox Muslims who then argue with each other about the fate of Arabs in the United States.  Murab, who acts like a rapping radical Musawi, plays the militant racist who blames all the troubles on the Jews.  Mustafa plays the itinerant optimist despite all the woes that fall in his path, and there are many in this movie.  Mohammed is his confused son who doesn't understand why he is a Muslim.  Salwah is Mohammed's sister who tries hard to be a secular American.  And then there's Omar, the aspiring actor who's trying hard to break the Arab stereotype in Hollywood.

The first 30 minutes are very disturbing as we watch how the characters in the Arab community tear each other down.  The Jews in this movie are no different:  Sam's family wants him to cut off all ties with his Iraqi business partner.

Most of the conflict in this movie takes place between Arabs, both secular and devout; between Arabs and Jews; and lastly between Arabs and the ignorant Americans who treat all Arabs as potential terrorists.  The tense plot of this film predicts  a violent outcome no matter who moves first, and it's this predictability that makes this movie a bit of a cheesy reenactment of all that which was bad in post 911 America. Yet it's the Jewish and Arab family that in the end make ends meet and shake hands over a business deal.

Yet despite all the tension and the predictability, there are some tender moments in this film, and the hopeless optimisim of the main character results in a pseudo happy end.

This is an interesting movie to show for a multi-cultural movie.  It covers bigotry, hatred, racism and shows how easily misunderstandings can get out of hand because conflicting cultures don't understand nor have the patience for each other's differences.",1261008000,5,2274,4.864935064935065
