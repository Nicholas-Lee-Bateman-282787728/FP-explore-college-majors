322967,4,6301278461,"One Minute to Zero has been one of my favorites always. This story covers the earliest days of the Korean War until the breakout from Pusan and the landings at Inchon (only referred too). For me what makes this story so good is the reality given to each of the main characters. Real people in real situations. The producers courage to show an attack against civilian refugees being used to infiltrate our lines by the North Koreans to kill our soldiers was so totally out of line with the  usual white wash given to any subject which would make our troops look bad. Howard Hughes stood his ground to the DOD and left it in to show the horror of war but also how because of war, good men must make terrible decisions that kill the innocent along with the enemy in order to save their mens lives. As Robert Mitchum's character pointed out ""Decisions that should be left alone to God"". A pulsating and action packed but thoughtful picture.",1324771200,10,936,4.5058823529411764
322968,4,6301278461,"I alwayes liked Robert Mitchum, what ever he was in.  I had never heard of this picture but was very pleased when I saw it. it is a good picture dealing with the Korean War and not to many films did that.  Excellent intermingling of combat footage with Hollywood and the only false section of the picture in my opinion is the obligatory romance between Ann Blyth and Mitchum....They didn't need it. The story stands well without it and it distracts from the rest of the picture, in my opinion",1320364800,,492,4.455555555555556
322969,5,6301278461,"I had remembered seeing this Korean War film on TV many years ago and wondered why it was never on since so many war films are played repeatedly.  It contains a massacre scene in which a US commander orders fire on mixed combatants who are using refugees as human shields. Obviously it was a look at things to come, a future many were afraid to reveal.",1302912000,2,352,4.333333333333333
322970,5,6301278461,"This seems to be an honest effort to depict what happened in the early stages of the Korean War.  It depicts the warfare taking place from the first days until the Inchon Landing had successfully taken place (October 1950).

The film was made in the throes of the war and could only look forward with faith and optimism to a positive outcome.  Portrayed are the attempts to train the South Korean troops in modern warfare, the arrival of the Royal Australian Airforce to assist the efforts of the Americans and South Koreans, the arrival of British Army troops, the use, by the North Koreans of Russian tanks, and aircraft, and the talk of the North Koreans being directed from Moscow.

Diverse military actions are shown from the method of disabling a tank at the outset, to dealing with guerrilla warfare, combined land and air actions, disrupting of enemy supply lines etc, along with a frank look at the suffering and hell of war itself.

This film does use actual footage from the War and it is skilfully and seamlessly woven into the fabric of the film.  It is a memorial of the times, a veritable time capsule from 1950.  It also indicates strongly that a substantial portion of the Hollywood crowd were certainly not Communist sympathisers.",1220313600,28,1248,4.75
322971,5,6301278461,"As a retired Army officer, I can honestly say that this is one of the best renditions of war, while also covering our continued lack of preparation for sudden conflict. I can also relate to the waiting wives, their losses and love for the spouse who must leave to fight. The Korean War was sudden. Robert Mitchum and William Talman (DA off old Perry Mason) with Ann Blyth provide powerful performances. Very factual of how the few military personnel in Korea at the time, fought for ""time"" till more help could come. A lot of actual war footage included. The scene of being forced to take action on the refugees is just part of the harsh but required reality of this excellent film. This is based on a true story, KOREA!!!",1091318400,74,722,4.519083969465649

322978,5,6301278461,"This movie is a favorite of mine. I always stayed up to watch it on TV if it was being telecast. I certainly was happy to see it out on DVD. My copy is excellent in all aspects. While I did not purchase through Amazon (my pre-computer days), I have read the many reviews on the site, and can't add much to the descriptions of the plot, acting, etc. But I do have a few comments. First, the story is based on TRUE inccidents from the Korean WAR. There was an inccident where U.N. forces were forced to fire on a refugee column being used to shelter North Korean infiltrators. The backgroung story of too few guys buying time for UN forces to build up and move into the theater of war was right on the money, a war no peace loving people wanted to fight, but had to do so...enough politics...almost! One blatant propaganda statement is made by an American general (Roy Roberts) at the climax of the film...he speaks of ""the brilliant tactical planning by General MacArthur and his invasion at Inchon as relieving the Pusan perimeter and turning back the hordes of Communist troops""...more or less true, but really some stilted language directed to the audience more than the few survivors of Bob Mitchum's infantry company. (And ""General Roberts"" mispronunces ""Pusan""...as  ""PEUUWSON""...oh well, scriptwriters and diaglog writers don't always match up!
 It is a Howard Hughes film, but one he didn't dicker with too much in editing, so it was a timely release. One item as I have repeatedly watched the flm...the actors seem to be made up for color filming...darker than normal make-up, etc., yet the film was released in B&W. Cinematography and effects are up to par for 1953. The music is great..the theme song (seems every Hollywood epic of the 50s into the 60s HAD to have a musical theme song for commercial release..""When I Fall I Love"" was a hit song of the era, and also parallelsthe plot line between Robert Mitchum and Ann Blyth very well, too.(Though it seems that Bob Mitchum also felt he needed to sing in a few of his movies..I'm gald he didn't do it in all of them!) Lots of recognizable character actors in the cast, though not all got credit listings.
Charles McGraw, as Mitchum's right hand man, his platoon sargeant, is tough guy perfect, but also contributes to the comic relief in between some really intense scenes of combat and it's aftermath. Heroism of the men in battle in Korea is served both quietly in the background, as well as in a few scenes of heroic sacrifice..Air Force pilots attempting to bomb an enemy truck convoy willingly attempting an attack down a narrow canyon unable to pull out in time (A-26 night intrusion missions just as they were!); A pilot in an unarmed AT-6 trying to (and successfully) drawing enemy anti-aircraft fire to protect cargo dropping planes trying to re-supply cut-off UN forces - the loss of one of the stars of the film characters! An infantry major diving on a grenade to save his men - another main character loss; a GI trying to take out a North Korean tank with a grenade when no other weapons were available being incinerated by a flamethrower. All scenes of sacrifice and loss. This movie also shows the woman's side of the war, from UN nurses to the wives of the fliers taking off from Japan for combat over Korea seeing their men off and waiting at the base for their return..or not. It's a very good movie.....you might be moved.....perhaps surprised.
You won't be disappointed.",1430697600,,3452,4.666666666666667
322979,2,6301278461,"What I thought was a great discovery, turned out to be an average Korean War pot-boiler, intended to show the use of close-air-support for the infantry.  Not even a young Robert Mitchum could save it, as it couldn't decide if it was on foot, or horseback.",1428796800,,255,4.543478260869565
322980,2,6301278461,"Robert Mitchum is very good in most of his

conflict, but pass this one by.",1426636800,,204,4.0
322981,4,6301278461,"Film takes place from June 25 to Sept 13 1950.  An Army and an Air force officer are working together as the north invades the south to maintain airfield positions in the Pusan perimeter.  The Army colonel also has to deal with communist infiltration of refugees, and stopping a truck supply convoy by going behind enemy lines.  Film ends as they are relieved.

The film is similar to those made during WW2, but is more informed by communist tactics during Korea.  There is footage of P-51s, P-80s, A-26s and C-47s, mostly in actual footage rather than models, the emphasis being on ground support.

The title is apparently a variation or confusion of a line given when the general asks when the colonel's unit was essentially wiped out, with him answering ""Oh one two zero."", meaning 01:20 military time.  The general regrets that the men did not hear of the Inchon invasion as a result.",1420070400,,888,4.7272727272727275

Its an excellent story,not just a load of Bang-Bang,and the romantic interest is provided by the lovely Ann Blyth who,when I first saw the film,was considered to be very much a ""class act"" indeed,but now,sadly is almost forgotten.

323003,4,6301278461,"This is one of the few Howard Hughes movies produced in the former Joseph P. Kennedy RKO plant created at the same time as the story events occur in the early 50s.  Although the film is in B&W, color would not enhance this blend of documentary footage of the conflict with back-lot action. The film is complex with one side revealing a war film coupled with a short, integrated, love, story with a larger message of Joint Combat Arms newly developed by the United States Military after 1947.  The events occur prior to the Inchon Operation and the movie attempts to portray the team work between the newly created USAF and army comrades
.
Robert Mitchum switches rank with Richard Egan from The Hunters (my favorite Korean Conflict film) and plays a convincing operational commander.

The movie starts out just before the Attack of the Communist North Korea on the Republic of Korea (south korea). Mitchum's Character is helping to train the understrength and under equipped ROK Army. also a war movie is not a war movie from this era without the proverbial love interest. Anyways , This is a pretty decent war movie and it also shows what the communist guerillas did during the war - albeit a little to overt but an example of dirty tactics.",1350432000,9,582,4.4392523364485985

The three main characters are a US Infantry Officer, a US Sergeant and an American Woman who works for the U.N.. The movie tries to show how the United States and the rest of the U.N. Forces were unprepared for the surprise North Korean attack and how they coped. There is even a scene were P-51D Mustangs from the Australian Airforce's 77 Squadron, provide air support to Robert Mitchum and his troops early in the war.

The movie portrays well some of the angst that men and command decision might require as the United Nations Coalition was caught ill prepared by the invasion and suffered accordingly. Some of the supporting actors are given good character development and the the use of documentary footage enhances the film, which was made in 1952. The love interest storyline tends to hinder the build up to the underlying drama of the combat and hence reduces the movie to a ""B"" grade drama, which is a pity, as the period and the documentary footage deserve better.",1330560000,,822,4.878571428571429

You also have to pump up the volume of your device on this transfer. The audio throughout the film is all over the place, worse with music, sometimes with explosions (its war), and a bit ugly with dialogue and music under.

No one at Warners took the time to Q.C. this. I assume it was farmed out. Of course, ""they"" may say it is/was the best print available. Perhaps I just got a terrible copy since these are ""allegedly"" made to order.

But when the Colonel is wounded in battle and sent to Japan to recuperate, he and she renew their relationship but this time romantically rather than hostile. Surprisingly, Mitchum and Blyth have a very nice on screen chemistry together. While the film itself is decent enough, it's really not more than a WWII propaganda war film but this time with the ""Commies"" substituting for the Nazis. The aerial sequences are quite good (which is no surprise since aerial enthusiast Howard Hughes was a co-producer) but where the film is really strong is in its almost throwaway portrait of the waiting wives and the emotional stress they go through. The film utilizes documentary footage interspersed with filmed footage without much effect. Directed by Tay Garnett (THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE). The score is by Victor Young and his love theme for the film became a hit song once words were added, When We Fall In Love became a pop standard.
