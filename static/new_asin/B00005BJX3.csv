7937703,5,B00005BJX3,"I was missing this disc in my collection for some odd reason. I looked everywhere I've watched anime in my home and at friends but when that was a bust I came to Amazon. Great price, shipped fast, and the series is as great as I remember. I love the half serious half mecha spoof tone Nadescio captures, I've seen many try and fail at it.",1388966400,,338,4.136363636363637

Unlike the other discs, this one sacrifices the extras for an extra episode. To some this, this is an upset, but to most, it's a bonus. This DVD starts out with a killer episode involving mecha model fun between Hiukaru and Uri-pea while at the same time displaying Akito's determination for the one who killed Gai. We even get to see Uri-pea's Aesteva-X (or X-Aesty or something like that). It does look pretty cool even it does get blown out of combat pretty quick.
Taking a time out from the humor, Ruri searches for the whereabouts of where she was born and who she was. It was a pretty cool episode, but sadly, the humor still carries the torch on this disc. Featuring various humoristic surprises such as a Beauty Contest for the next captain Nadesico. What was probably the best episode is the last one which has the crew deal with ghosts, Jovians invading the Nadesico and memory Mahjong tiles. Don't worry, you'll understand it when you see it.
Overall, the dub does a pretty good job with such famous lines as:
Megumi: You know, I use to be a voice actress.
Soldier: Weren't you in Tentacle Love Godess?
Megumi: *nods*
Sometimes the dub changes lines to make them more understandable for an American audiance. For instance, when Ryoko blows up a Jovian she says in Japanese ""Got ya"" with Izumi replying ""Gotcha? Got cha-cha?"" referring to the classic Japanese anime ""Gatchaman"". While in the dub, Ryoko says ""Got him"" with Izumi replying ""Got him? Isn't that where Batman lives?"". Still, the dub makes me laugh everytime. The only part on this disc where the dub doesn't seem to work is in the Beauty Contest episode where in the dub all the girls sing in Japanese with no subtitles. I'm glad I have optional translation subtitles on the DVD instead of the VHS version.
Pure and simple, this is an anime fan's anime. And if your an anime fan, there is no reason not to watch this. With nurses, ghosts, princesses, mecha maniacs and Gekigenger 3 (which is an obvious incantation of Go Nagai's Getter Robo), how can you complain?",1006992000,,2237,4.63727959697733
7937705,5,B00005BJX3,"If you have followed anime for any length of time, you truly owe it to yourself to pick up this series. The animation is crisp, the voices are great (though I am almost sure some voices were from Evangelion), and the colors look just like on the back of the case - vibrant and rich.
I have serious anime, but after seeing Tenchi on Cartoon Network I like humor too. I have been following this series since I got the first disc, and it's a perfect mix of humor, action, and plot twists. It's got action, human characters that you can care about, and humor. LOTS of humor. I  laugh hysterically at every reference that pokes fun at anime stereotypes. The main character is a geeky teen who has tons of girls after him and he wants nothing to do with them - kinda like Tenchi. And just watch the Gekkiganger anime inside the show! It's an extremely campy and sarcastic take on classic anime. (it reminds me of Voltron for some reason)  And the irony is the spoof series plays an integral part of the show, but you'll have to watch more to understand.....",992476800,,1051,4.384615384615385
7937706,5,B00005BJX3,"Follows the exploits of the  Nadesico's Aestivalis pilots as they struggle  to  stop a deadly new Jovian weapon.
I know most of you are gonna say  that Evangelion is better, but it's not. This is an complete series without  all the overblow pathos of Eva. The characters are fresh, fun, and  original.",965952000,,301,4.6923076923076925
