8436833,5,B004NTDF2O,"Funny Funny Movie. This is suppose to be a horror comedy movie I think. The main character is a woman who thinks she is a child and is played by a man. Got that ?. It is low budget, so don't expect The Evil Dead (which is my favorite horror comedy). Anyhow, if you like movies that are so stupid that they are hilarious then buy this one.",1444435200,,338,3.985294117647059
8436834,3,B004NTDF2O,"This is a film which centers on the lives of a family of Hillbilly cannibals from northern New Jersey. They broke their creed ""strangers are tops, but neighbors bring cops"" early in the film with the tug-o-war killing of Andy Shiffner (Sasha Friedenberg). The main character (DVD cover girl) is Beefteena Bullion played by Alan Rowe Kelly and my bad for thinking she was a he and played by someone emulating ""Divine.""  She also wrote and directed this feature and is the face or tomorrow.

Her brothers are Hubcap (Mike Lane doomed zombie in ""Zombies Anonymous"" ) and Butternut (Joshua Nelson Josh in ""Zombies Anonymous"" ). Susan Adriensen (mutant secretary in ""Experiment #7) is  Sno Cakes, the sister. The patriarch of this family is Papa Elvis Bullion played by Terry West an extra in Misty Mundae films.

The film is overtly campy by design. This is perhaps for those who would have loved ""House of a 1,000 Corpses"" if the dialogue wasn't so far above their head.

5 on the camp scale. 1 for serious viewers.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. no sex or nudity. clothed genital mutilation.",1398988800,,1084,4.801075268817204

8436836,5,B004NTDF2O,"Do not miss this entry into the ""inbred hillbilly cannibal family"" subgenre of Horror films.  Alan Rowe Kelly is a masterful storyteller and filmmaker and this film is no exception.  This is amongst my favorite horror comedy films and Alan's portrayal of the character Beefteena along with Susan Adriensen's portrayal of Beefteena's cousin Sno Cakes are so over the top they are perfect.  This film is truly a gem.",1305590400,5,414,4.971014492753623
