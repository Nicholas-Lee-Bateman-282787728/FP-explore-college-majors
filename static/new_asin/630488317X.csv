Rarer still are those that focus on ground-dwellers, as opposed to the more conspicuous, bushy-tailed, tree-dwelling varieties of our rodent friends. So it was with great astonishment that I discovered this wonderful (but brief) 1991 Discovery Channel feature that is self-recommending to squirrel lovers everywhere.

There are 40 different species of ground squirrels, who are often mistaken for chipmunks albeit without striped faces (but you knew that, didn't you?). For connoisseurs, this video includes the Columbian, the Richardson's, the Franklin's, and the Golden-Mantled. Filmed in the American Northwest plains, the outstanding cinematography highlights diets, habitats, family communication, territorialism, and hibernation patterns of these fascinating creatures. A special emphasis is given to being good neighbors: these other-centered squirrels are shown whistling and chirping to warn their friends and relatives of predators, even to the point of placing themselves in danger. Written by four screenwriters and narrated by Su Ours, a love for the subject is clearly communicated by everyone involved. A pleasant, inspiring soundtrack is the perfect finishing touch to a project that is infinitely more rewarding than anything being screened today by the Motion Picture Academy or your average trailer-park film school.

One scene from this video must be addressed for potential viewers. Aspiring toward gritty realism, the filmmakers have decided to include, in what is otherwise an emphatically pro-squirrel effort, footage of one of our dear friends being captured by a hawk. We are thankfully not shown the outcome of this horrifying encounter, so we might possibly conclude that the squirrel escaped unharmed and the hawk, upon realizing his vast inferiority to his magnificent prey, has shamefully humbled himself to an all-veggies-and-pellets diet. My only other issue regards the film's length: why only a paltry 25 minutes rather than the 3-4 hour length the subject so truly deserved? Let those cameras roll! Surely there was much more to this project than merely filling programming vacancies?

If ever there was a Must-Own for squirrel lovers, this is it! As the early-70s pop band Climax exclaimed in their only hit single, ""Precious and Few are the Rodents we too can share!"" P.S.: Why no DVD with special features?",1278633600,2,2471,5.549071618037135
