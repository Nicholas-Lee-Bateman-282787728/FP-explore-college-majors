5921066,5,B00EJ9726I,"""Cinerama Holiday"" was the 2nd of the original, 3-panel Cinerama travelogues. Released in 1955, the motion picture crisscrosses two hybridized travelogues of the ""Cinerama camera accompanied"" vacations of two adventurous, real-life, married couples. The couple from America go to Europe and the couple from Switzerland tour the USA.  My granddaughters love the rollercoaster in ""This is Cinerama""  and set their chairs side-by-side close to the big screen TV to watch it.  But for them the bobsled ride is the best.  They ""rode"" the bobsled segment 14 times in a row.  They would have gone more but the needed to go to dance lessons.  Result: two more kids who are hooked on Cinerama and travelogues in general.  Dave Strohmaier (who has re-mastered these films)has done a fabulous job in keeping Cinerama alive and well.  Thanks Dave for a job well done!",1382918400,24,855,5.057142857142857

5921068,5,B00EJ9726I,This is certainly dated and probably means more to people like me that saw it in Cinerama. It has been awhile and I really enjoyed seeing Las Vegas when women were dressed up and the men were in suits. Not the same Vegas as today.,1426118400,,230,4.133333333333334
5921069,5,B00EJ9726I,First Cinerama film I saw in a theater.  Very good video and sound for your home theater.  I still have the full size brochure given out at the theater.  This comes with a small version of the same brochure and excellent documentary bonus material on the disc.  While the film has no plot it is entertaining and the Cinerama process fascinating.,1421539200,,345,4.60655737704918

5921071,5,B00EJ9726I,"Everything about this purchase was first rate.  I saw this movie in 3-strip Cinerama in Hartford CT as a child. For the film historian and collector this is a must see. Amazon shipped this to me using a dependable company, UPS.  Not that 3rd rate delivery company called Lasership they sometimes use.",1410652800,4,300,4.75

5921073,4,B00EJ9726I,"Never say never would be the accurate way to describe this release. Cinerama Holiday was the second Cinerama production, and the first I ever saw in a theater, so it is fitting that it be released to DVD. The ads for Cinerama in the 1950's, when both Cinerama and the teevee were in their infancies, said Cinerama could never be shown on the teevee. Now it is presented in full stereophonic sound and very painstakingly restored as well. We see it on the DVD almost as it was presented back in the 1950's. Of course, it is awfully hard to present a curved screen onto a flat one, so they have done the next best thing, they have put the camera in the back of the theater auditorium and projected it that way. It almost works. I should think it would truly work on the new curved screen teevees which are coming out now. It will be awhile before I will be able to see it that way, though. I don't have $3,000 to shell out for one just now. There are segments in this movie which are better than others. I enjoyed the trip across America and the Swiss Alps, but I believe the Paris segment was just a tad long. I especailly enjoyed the New Orleans segment, but it didn't show Mardi Gras, which would have been tremendous in Cinerama.  I also especially enjoyed the New England fair. Still, Cinerama Holiday is a good history lesson showing the United States as it once was, and Paris, too. In fact, its fun to see all the old films again, even though the projection is not quite there.",1406505600,5,1483,4.33453237410072
5921074,2,B00EJ9726I,"Restoring flawless film. the sound is a little loose knowing the quality of Cinerama.
The documentary itself is not deserving of the Cinerama technology since except for the last scenes of flight with the U.S. Navy, the rest of the film is very slow and low action not allowed to enjoy this technology.

The blu ray suffers in the second part of the film some cuts sound. Personally I was disappointed. Not remember the film since I've been a fan since childhood programs and in this case I expected more spectacular scenes and a best sound.",1404777600,,541,4.635416666666667
5921075,5,B00EJ9726I,"The Cinerama process can be called an American Film format. The Smilebox Simulated Widescreen Video transfer gives you the illusion of being there. (Dim room, 5 feet away, Volume-Theatre Level)Cute story of two couples doing foreign exchange travelog.
The 50's purity is cute, and nice change from language of the 21rst century. For a film buff, this and This IS Cinerama, and How The West Was Won are musts.",1402876800,4,408,4.927536231884058
5921076,5,B00EJ9726I,"I now have all these Cinerama Smilebox Blurays. I saw them all when they came out and was a fanatic.  Also our family knew Gayne and Ottelie  Rescher.  They gave us tickets for Windjammer.

They've done a remarkable job restoring  these, although I increase the color saturation when I watch them.  Waiting patiently for my favorite of the Cinerama travelogues, Seven Wonders of the World!!!!",1398470400,,392,4.953846153846154
5921077,5,B00EJ9726I,Can't wait to watch it with my 100 year old mother.  We saw the original in the theater years ago.  It will be fun to see it again.,1397174400,,131,3.642857142857143
5921078,5,B00EJ9726I,"I bought this for my dad as a Christmas present and we all watched as this wonderful time capsule of travel, both domestic and foreign, unfolded.  While it is somewhat uneven with too much time devoted to some subjects and not enough for others (NY especially!) it was a fascinating look at the world as it existed then.  The conceit of the two traveling couples is ridiculous and they add nothing to what is essentially a medley of travelogue footage.  But it survives on the merit of the travel footage alone.  The extras are interesting in a ""watch it once"" kind of way...fun to see the two women as they are now.",1390435200,6,616,4.473214285714286
5921079,5,B00EJ9726I,"This is the second of the Cinerama travelogues. As with Windjammer, which was also done by Louis DeRochement, there was a more coherent plot, than in the  other films.
photography was good and the supplements were actually interesting. This is the one film I never got to see during roadshow so it was a treat to finally it. Goood  musical score. I enjoyed this and Windjammer more than any of the other presentations.
one caution however, it needs to be projected on a BIG screen to get the effect. Even  a 100"" diagonal may be too small.",1390176000,4,539,4.536082474226804
5921080,5,B00EJ9726I,enjoyed it very much  very historical  will show it to all my friends  very realistic in smilevision  would like to get the DVD when it becomes available of  The making of Cinerama,1389916800,2,180,4.5
5921081,5,B00EJ9726I,"Flicker Alley did a fantastic job with Cinarama Holiday. We watched this blu-ray during the Christmas Season with a room full of guests through an HD protector on a 110"" screen. Everybody sat real close. Next best thing to reliving the Cinarama experience at  home. Guests raved about the experience, and the quality of the intensive restoration of this magnificent travelogue. It's like you're really there....but, there back in 1955! A highlight to the season and an experience my guests will remember forever. What an amazing flashback experience through the advancement of technology.

Excellent addition and a ""MUST HAVE"" for any blu-ray aficionado's collection.

BEWARE: Make sure you get the FLICKER ALLEY blu-ray release, and not the hack job atrocity distributed by Alpha Video. Flicker Alley spend years and years, and big bucks (with loving care) to restore this historical gem of a film.",1389139200,3,899,5.229166666666667
5921082,5,B00EJ9726I,"This blu-ray release is a huge achievement. It has been restored to an unbelievably good state. Both sound and picture are top notch, much better than the first two Cinerama reissues from Flicker Alley. Although not as historically significant as ""This is Cinerama"" due to its being the second travelog Cinerama movie produced, the segments in Holiday are for me not as trying and much more interesting. The supplemental features are outstanding as well especially for the kind participation of the four main stars. This is an absolute must purchase.",1388361600,2,550,5.122222222222222
5921083,5,B00EJ9726I,Very beautiful and flawless Blu-Ray print in the amazing SmileBox format. Some very exciting scenes and magnificent scenery. An absolute must for anyone with a large flat screen TV. This is the original roadshow uncut print.,1386201600,5,224,5.25
5921084,3,B00EJ9726I,"havent seen it.  Did see the first one ""This is Cinerama"" when it came out, many many years ago. Reading the review of this one was interesting as I am not familiar with it.  Reviewer did make one horrid goof. He said the Swiss couple boarded Amtraks, California Zephyr.  Amtrak did not exist then. A small point I admit. lol",1385337600,,325,4.383333333333334
5921085,5,B00EJ9726I,"Great picture quality.  Last year my son gave  me ""This Is Cinerama"" and this year, again for my birthday, he gave me another Cinerama restoration, "" Cinerama Holiday"".
  What a fantastic improvement in picture quality.  It gets even better about 1 hour into the film too.  I did not get to see Cinerama Holiday at the Tennessee Theater in downtown Nashville back in the 50s, so this was a treat.  Also, I enjoyed this film a bit more than than the first.  It was much more interesting to me.  So my hat is off to everyone at Flicker Alley for the fantastic restoration.  I love Smilebox too.  Just like when I sat 5th row center in the theater, I can see a bit of the stage just below the curved screen.",1383782400,16,704,4.297709923664122
5921086,5,B00EJ9726I,"I was to young to see CINERAMA HOLIDAY on its original release and wished one day I could.  My wish was granted with this fantastic release from Flicker Alley.  The transfer is incredible!  It is wonderful to see the world as it was back in 1955.  This is a great piece of history and should be in everyone's collection.

8605962,5,B00EJ9726I,These Cinerama films are much better than I expected.  They're a great time capsule of life in the fifties.  The restoration job is nothing short of phenomenal; the films had deteriorated quite a bit by now.  The only thing missing is captions.  I particularly like the extras that feature interviews with people who were in the film or worked behind the camera.,1486684800,2,362,4.790322580645161
