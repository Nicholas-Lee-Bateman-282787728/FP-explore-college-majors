2529697,5,B000EQH2MO,"This is a stunningly beautiful Christmas concert in a western Norway cathedral. The St. Olaf Choir is outstanding, with a long history of very high quality performance. And the Cathedral Girls Choir is every bit as good, given their age. This is a wonderful addition to any collection.",1264032000,4,285,4.958333333333333
2529698,5,B000EQH2MO,"The St. Olaf Choir, Band, and Orchestra (for those non-Nordic, non-Minnesotans happening to read this, St. Olaf College is in Northfield, Minnesota, and was founded by Norwegian Lutheran immigrants to the area) returned to their ancestral roots in 2005 and joined with the Nidarosdomens Jentekor (Whoa! My spell checker really doesn't like that one!) for a Christmas concert beautifully captured by US Public Television. If you missed the telecasts of this gorgeous and blessed event, do not despair, here is a DVD for your viewing and auditory pleasure. (If not currently available here, check with St. Olaf itself or PBS.) Included is the finale and piece de resistance, my all-time favorite hymn, Sibelius' *Beautiful Savior* that would awe even the most pagan.

Nonetheless, I do NOT like lutefisk (for those non-Nordics not living in close proximity to Scandinavian folk, this is a ""delicacy"" of fish soaked in lye, hopefully all washed off, then boiled to the appearance and consistency of congealed Vaseline, but smelling up the whole house a whole lot lingering worse.)

Get the CD & DVD. Skip the lutefisk, but lefse (potato tortilla) would be fitting and proper while enjoying this event. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer.",1166486400,11,1230,5.238578680203045

8113315,5,B000EQH2MO,"This heartwarming concert, performed at Trondheim's stunning Viking-era Nidaros Cathedral, is an inspired performance of both traditional and modern Christmas music.  St. Olaf's choir is well known as top-notch, and surely lives up to that rating in this video.  Nidarosdomens Jentekor (the Girls Choir at the Cathedral) may have even outdone St. Olaf's here, delivering an astonishingly flawless concert.  I am certain I will never hear sweeter, more angelic voices in my lifetime.  Randi Stene, the wonderful mezzo-soprano and a native of Trondheim, was a perfect choice as soloist, and the instrumentalists on hand blended beautifully.  Of note, as harps seem to come out only at Christmas time, was Brigitte Volan, whose playing was simply lovely.  Lots of languages here, as various songs are sung in Norwegian, Swedish, English, Latin, Zulu, and German.  Throughout the concert, the music is gorgeous and rich, the setting is unbelievably beautiful, every single performer an artist of the first class, and the sacredness of the Holy Day is never forgotten for a moment.",1324771200,3,1076,5.331360946745562
