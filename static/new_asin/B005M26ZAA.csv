4833821,5,B005M26ZAA,"The Seeds We Sow concert on Sunday night (Oct. 23, 2011) was the best concert we have ever seen.
I've seen Springsteen, Seeger, Cat Stevens, Moody Blues (about ten times), Robin Trower, J Geils,
Loggins and Messina, Led Zepplin (twice) Jimmy Hendrix, Jethro Tull (about 5 times) Jackson Browne, The Who (about 6 times), Crosby, Stills and Nash, you get my drift.  And...Lindsey Buckingham @ the Little Creek Casino in Shelton, WA last Sunday (Oct. 23, 2011) was the best show I've ever seen.  His energy was amazing and he sang and played his heart out to a very small crowd. I will see him again anytime!!",1319587200,6,606,4.654205607476635
4833822,5,B005M26ZAA,"Just watched this on Palladia.  We saw Lindsey in Pittsburgh a few weeks ago on the same tour with the same set list.  The concert was fantastic!  I am still on a Lindsey Buckingham high.  He is terribly under-rated in my opinion.  He is the talent in Fleetwood Mac.  The songs from his new album are amazing.  Buy this concert DVD, you will not be disappointed.",1318896000,14,362,4.393939393939394
4833823,5,B005M26ZAA,"I was at this concert. It was a one night only, special gig, filmed at the Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills, April 22, 2011.
I expected an amazing show, but even so, had no idea it would be THAT GOOD!!! Lindsey  just gets better and better, and this performance far exceeded my already high expectations. It  was simply jaw-dropping good!!

Lindsey did NOT disappoint! His voice was in top form - so strong and emotional. His playing...phenomenal as always! A once in a lifetime show I will never forget. Lindsey puts on a concert like no other, and it's a shame more people don't know it. This concert will blow you away! If you like his new album, you will love those songs played live. Lindsey is a whole other beast in his live shows.

Besides the stunning versions of his new songs, he of course plays some of his hits from Fleetwood Mac, as well as gems from all of his previous albums. He's a master of both electric and acoustic, with a mesmerizing style all his own -  and he showcase it all in this beautiful concert. He begins the concert all alone, with just his guitar for the first six songs. Then he brings on his tight band of three  Brett Tuggle - keyboards, guitars, backing vocals; Neal Heywood - guitars, backing vocals; Walfreo Reyes - drums/percussion ). They're a really great band, and it's hard to believe so much sound and energy comes from just the 4 musicians! The guys are pros, and they definitely know how to play!!

If you love great guitar, great songwriting, or just love a fantastic show put on by a tremendously  talented man...you'll want to get this DVD!! Lindsey holds nothing back. A true  artist who gives you his heart and soul every time he performs.

Here's the set list:

""Shut Us Down""
""Go Insane""
""Trouble""
""Never Going Back Again""
""Big Love""
""Under the Skin""
""All My Sorrows""
""In Our Own Time""
""Illumination""
""Second Hand News""
""Tusk""
""Stars Are Crazy""
""End of Time""
""That's the Way Love Goes""
""I'm So Afraid""
""Go Your Own Way""
""Turn It On""
""Treason""
""Seeds We Sow""

This concert is available on DVD, or Blu-ray, and also a DVD/CD combo. All of the songs are also on the CD, except for ""Go Insane"", ""Turn It On"", and ""Treason"".

*** Additionally, as it's been brought up in comments to another review, I just want to stress that this concert  was professionally filmed, and is a legit release. The Lindsey Buckingham/ Little Big Town DVD is a boot - and a crappy one at that. Too bad, 'cause it was a great show, and I don't know why CMT or the artists don't make an official release. However, this isn't a boot. Lindsey is releasing this. Obviously, I can't guarantee the quality because it hasn't been released yet, BUT, there is no reason to expect it to be any less than his other two legit release - Soundstage and Bass Hall. Actually it should be better, especially if you get the Blu-ray",1317427200,35,2840,4.4893203883495145
4833824,5,B005M26ZAA,"ok I don't really understand why Lindsey in general gets such little recognition but even more so on his solo stuff. This new album is nothing short of amazing in my opinion and I have been lucky enough to see his shows starting with Under the Skin, Gift of Screws then I saw him with Mac and most recently Seeds we Sow, this man plays his heart out and is by far one of the best live performers especially for a guy whos 62. On that note if haven't been lucky enough to see him live in concert you should definitely pick this up and even if you have you still should  I am!",1316649600,18,574,4.035087719298246

4833829,2,B005M26ZAA,I'm very disappointed with this one. i don't like the Small Machine. Lindsay is so self centered he talks about himself & his family in between each song. What a swelled head. I'm also not thrilled with the sound either.,1399766400,3,220,4.525
4833830,5,B005M26ZAA,I give this product five stars because it was a gift for a friend.  He really liked it.  I recommend this to everybody.,1397174400,,119,4.130434782608695
4833831,5,B005M26ZAA,"Great performance by a largely unsung talent.
Also a great value as the set contains the dvd and cd.
Helluva guitar player.",1397174400,,123,4.636363636363637
4833832,5,B005M26ZAA,Would be easier to make up your mind if you could play some samples from the cd. I think they would either sell alot more or maybe less. Dont get me wrong buckingham is one of the finest artist I've ever heard. Heard a solo song and video on VEVO today it was live from the small machine in L.A. and he was awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1394496000,,332,4.203125
4833833,5,B005M26ZAA,i have not listen to this yet it it nexted but i love everything to do with fleetwood mac thanks,1389052800,,96,3.85
4833834,5,B005M26ZAA,"i'm amazed that Lindsey is so underated
a real artist ...one of the best I've heard this year
you will love it",1375747200,,110,4.045454545454546
4833835,5,B005M26ZAA,"The live versions of these tunes, many with Lindsey and his guitar solo, are better than any of the studio versions.  These songs will keep running through your head day after day and you will want to watch this over and over again.  Nice bonus with the audio CD to upload to our music server or take in the car.",1367107200,,312,4.183333333333334
4833836,5,B005M26ZAA,"The sound quality is outstanding. Lindsey is a genious. This is a very melodical and ""tight"" performance. It's a must have.",1365379200,,123,4.904761904761905
4833837,5,B005M26ZAA,This is one of the finest live performances that I have ever seen and heard. VERY COOL! Don't pass this one up!,1357344000,,111,4.090909090909091
4833838,5,B005M26ZAA,"Wow! Lindsey delivers a nuanced, intense, and impressive set of classic Fleetwood Mac and solo tunes in this iteration of the 'small machine.' When it comes to underrated guitar players, Lindsey defines the list. He is an introverted guy, but this makes his talent all the more delectable when you get a taste of it.

I recently had the pleasure of seeing Lindsey solo in a club of about 1000 people. That tour did not feature any back-up, while this blu-ray features Lindsey solo on the first few and last songs, but with his band on the majority of the set. The band doesn't really add anything, so I wish this show was entirely solo (although Tusk is great). The truly electric moments are when you realize the true lead guitar genius behind the Mac's catalog when Lindsey is alone on stage displaying his classic finger-picking style. ""Never Going Back Again"" is rendered in a searing, half-whispered slow-burn that leaves you hanging on the next note.

Picture and audio quality are both top-notch, so if you are a fan of Lindsey's, don't hesitate to pick this up.",1356739200,,1069,4.711229946524064
4833839,4,B005M26ZAA,"For me, watching Lindsey Buckingham in concert is a sometimes hit or miss proposition (usually hit). This one definitely is a hit. I think the smaller venue was a great choice in showcasing his unique guitar style and his connection with the audience. I missed him in concert this time around, but this DVD does a good job of making up for that.",1356307200,,345,4.492063492063492
4833840,4,B005M26ZAA,"Lindsey's performance is fantastic and moving as always. However, I was hoping this release was going to be of his solo tour without the band. Secondly, I feel like I've seen this before. Yes there are some new songs from his latest CD, but I don't need to have yet another DVD of him performing 'Go Your Own Way' and the other admittedly classic but overplayed Fleetwood Mac songs. Those tunes should be left to the 'Big Machine'.",1351209600,,431,4.538461538461538
4833841,5,B005M26ZAA,"I recently had the truly amazing experience of witnessing this phenomenal musician from the front row.  I bought the DVD shortly thereafter and was very pleased with how it captured the experience, as well as with the sound and image quality.  I'll now be able to enjoy it again and again.",1347321600,,289,4.647058823529412
4833842,5,B005M26ZAA,"I was at LB's show about six months later at the Regency in San Francisco, and it was a spectacular experience.  It was a thrill to get this DVD, as it was a virtual duplicate of what I saw.  I suppose it surprises no one that this man likes things how he likes them, so when he puts together a show, it's the same to every detail, from where he stands for each bar of each song, to how he reacts to the audience cheering, to the outfit he's decided is his tour garb.

I've never seen his solo shows before, and it was a nice mix of his solo work, but thankfully not at the exclusion of making his big Fleetwood Mac hits the centerpiece of the show.  I do enjoy the ""Seeds We Sow"" album, in particular ""That's the Way that Love Goes"" is my favorite.  The band infuses it with energy, the kind that is missing from his studio albums because of how meticulously and re-tracked those things are put together.

It's one of the highlights of my show going that while I was up front, LB got right in my face to play the wicked ""I'm So Afraid"" solo.  It's the closest I'll get to a private concert from the man.",1336003200,,1104,4.1069767441860465
4833843,5,B005M26ZAA,"I saw the show twice on this passed tour: out in Southhampton NY, and again a few nights later in NYC. He was on fire! His guitar playing, which I've admired for years, was sensational. I was so happy to find out the show was professionally taped. The disc itself holds up well as a document of this tour. For Buckingham fans, and fingerpick guitarist fans in general, this is a must have!",1327795200,,389,4.342465753424658
4833844,4,B005M26ZAA,"An iconic musician in his 45th year of entertaining, Lindsey doesn't disappoint with his signature melodies.  Amazing plucking & heartfelt lyrics made the show worthwhile.  I danced around our house after landing the 4th row seats.  Only a cameo by Stevie could have made it utter perfection!  Certainly Lindsey's contribution to American rock will live on beyond him.",1326844800,3,368,5.293103448275862
4833845,4,B005M26ZAA,"My only complaint is the Blu-ray version does not come with the audio CD like the DVD copy does AND it costs more. So unfortunately if you want the audio by itself for your music library you'll have to sacrifice Blu-ray video quality for DVD, which is probably just fine. I'm just bummed about paying more for less.",1326758400,3,315,4.448275862068965
4833846,2,B005M26ZAA,"I love Lindsey and I have all his collections since 1985. Honestly he is purely Fleetwood Mac !
His two individual albums employing those musicians who are just affecting his image and reputation
and those hits in these two albums they played are mediocre due to their musical ability and talent.
Most of the songs are either sounding with no punch on bass or drums and percussion were too weak.
Lindsey should have arranged a better competent team to play with him. He must shine on again !",1326499200,3,491,4.590909090909091
4833847,3,B005M26ZAA,"Three stars. Mr. Buckingham's voice is not as good as his guitar virtuosity in this concert as a whole. One in particular: End Of Time,  is the best song on the DVD. Here he puts it all together with his voice, the band, and his lyrics.",1324512000,,236,4.130434782608695
4833848,5,B005M26ZAA,"I saw Lindsey Buckingham live during his ""Seeds We Sow"" tour and this DVD is the exact show he put on during that tour. He is a massively talented guitar player, a master at crafting pop music, and an impeccable showman. Very few performers play with such precision, passion, and professionalism. He is a true master and this is a show that is not to be missed!",1324425600,,361,4.402985074626866
4833849,5,B005M26ZAA,"As Buckingham explains between a couple songs, the Large Machine is Fleetwood Mac and all the commerce and wealth that came with it.  The Small Machine is just him.  And he does several songs solo, but he also has 3 additional musicians join him for the meat of the program, so I'm not sure if that becomes the Medium Machine or whether they are just oil for the machine.  In any case the machine is in fine working order.  Having been in the audience a few years ago when Buckingham performed a concert at Bass Hall in Fort Worth, I can attest to his connection with the audience. That show became his last DVD concert.  I noticed some similarities here.  He opens and closes solo.  He doesn't shy away from the greats (""Go Insane"", ""Trouble"", ""Tusk"", ""I'm So Afraid"") which makes the audience increase the pitch to a feverish state.  The best one of all is his Chet Atkins Gibson (isn't HD great) guitar shredding on ""Big Love"" which brings the house down.  This time around Buckingham plays numerous tracks from his newest studio album ""Seeds We Sow"" which is a mixture of up tempo and slower songs with his back up musicians also vocalizing.  At times I thought I was listening to ""America.""

Lindsey Buckingham writes some great songs and has an excellent, identifiable voice.  His greatest gift however, may be his guitar playing.  Changing guitars with every song, he rarely (saw maybe once) uses a pick and he doesn't have those long pointy fingernails.  He uses his finger tips for the most part and he's masterful.  The DTS-HD Master audio is spectacular as you might expect as are the visuals.  Thankfully the director moves the cameras slowly and purposefully with most of the focus on the musicians and their instruments.  An excellent show from one of our best contemporary musicians.",1323216000,4,1798,4.711538461538462
4833850,5,B005M26ZAA,"he has a decent enough voice, but his blue grass style finger picking guitar mechanics are superlative.  He knows how to write and make music, and his best pairings aside, he is still a star in his own right.",1323216000,,208,4.333333333333333
4833851,5,B005M26ZAA,"I will throw my two cents into the pot here and add another 5 star review.  This really is a great show and the new stuff on this CD is really enjoyable.  I purchased the DVD/CD combo and it's great to have the CD for the car and to easily transfer to an iPod or PC.  My only small complaint with this DVD is the the set list has an awful lot of tracks included in his two other DVD's.  This review is supposed to be about this disc, so I do give it five stars, but would have taken off a star for variey if reviewing all of the DVD's together.  His last DVD for example (Live from Bass Hall) from only a couple years back includes several of these same songs.  Of 19 songs on this DVD, almost half  - ""Shut Us Down"", Go Insane, Big Love, Trouble, Never Going Back Again, Second Hand News, Go Your Own Way, Under The Skin and I'm So Afraid are all repeated.  A couple of great songs from his 1993 CD are included however and sound great (""Turn It On"" and ""All My Sorrows""), it would have been a real treat to have a few more of those.",1320624000,,1034,3.9613526570048307
4833852,5,B005M26ZAA,"Like a few other individuals who have posted here, I was able to see Lindsey Buckingham live in concert this year.  The experience was unbelievable - Lindsey is extremely underrated as a guitarist, and as I found out from the show, really should be considered the heart and soul of Fleetwood Mac - without him, I seriously doubt they would have had the same level of success.

This Blu-ray is a must own for anyone who is a Lindsey Buckingham fan (or a fan of Fleetwood Mac).  The sound quality is just remarkable, and the fact that the set list is identical to what I saw in concert really allowed me to experience that night all over again.  There is ample punch with the bass guitars / drums, but also extremely crisp highs showcasing Lindsey's picking skills.  You will see several close-ups of the guitar throughout the performance, and his skill is no more evident than on the track 'Never Going Back Again.'  The highlight of the performance does come from some of the older songs such as 'Go Your Own Way', but I definitely have new favorites in some of the new songs 'In Our Own Time' and 'End of Time.'

As a music fan, I also purchased his new CD 'Seeds We Sow', and while it is still very enjoyable, I must say that I prefer the new songs from this Blu-ray.  Lindsey tends to use some sort of audio filter / manipulation on his audio CDs that allow his voice to come off differently than it does in concert and I have yet to figure out why.  The audio from the concert tops the album CD without question.  If you end up purchasing this, you will not be disappointed, it's one of the best concert experiences I own.",1320278400,9,1626,4.372093023255814
4833853,5,B005M26ZAA,"With Fleetwood Mac as my number one musical group and ""Go Your Own Way"" as one of my two all time favorite songs, I've greatly anticipated the arrival today of this Blu-ray when it was announced back in September.  Having attended many of their live concert performances and owning a multitude of the group or individual member's performances on LP's, CD's, Laserdisc, DVD and now Blu-ray through the decades, I am quite familiar with Lindsey's musical contributions.

Recorded at the Saban Theater in Beverly Hills, CA, this is a wonderfully intimate theater of 1900 seats offers the perfect venue for what is a solo performance by Lindsey for 1/3 of the set (6 songs out of the 19 total) running  1 hour 47 minutes.  Sonically, it is Lindsey and his variety of guitars at their peak both in performance and recording.  5.1 DTS HD Master lossless audio without compression is on full display during his solo performances with a sample of the available dynamic range on ""Never Going Back Again.""  Lindsey's vocals and his guitar plucks & twangs are solidly spread across the front soundstage with the surrounds limited to immersing the listener among the concert attendees who's every comment can be heard loud and very clear.  As the 3 members of his band contributes their talents starting with the 6th track of ""Under the Skin"", the surround channels fill with the added vocals and instrumentals expanding the already spectacular sound stage to totally encompass the listener.

Visually, the dynamic range here is every bit as broad as the sound going from the Blackest Black backgrounds during each of Lindsey's solo performances to the absolute peak Whites when the high intensity stage lights are aimed directly into the camera's lens.  The latter causes some slight banding that is understandable due to the lighting conditions involved but certainly doesn't take away from the overall quality of the high definition recording.  Again due to the artistic choices made for the stage lighting, wide shots from the balcony are more limited in detail than what many might be accustomed to on other recordings.  Go in tight and the available video resolution is all on display best evidenced on the song ""I'm So Afraid"" where you cannot only see the beads of sweat back lit, dripping off Lindsey's forehead but individual specks of dust floating in the air on stage as well.  Close ups on his fingers at work (Lindsey's guitar skills fully on display in tight close ups also on ""I'm So Afraid"") on the strings clearly reveal the many years of wear and tear on the necks of his guitars with swirl marks and microscopic scratches catching the spot lights clearly visible on a number of his many different guitar bodies.

As familiar as I am with Lindsey's performances of many of his past songs, the new interpretations here are very nicely done and different enough to sound fresh again.  Add in some of the new songs from his latest ""Seeds We Sow"" CD that I found remarkably commercial (End of Time, In Our Own Time) along with views from the best seats in the house that allowed me to watch Lindsey's skill with a guitar up close and personal, this Blu-ray concert is a must own for any of his (or Fleetwood Mac) fans.  For others who are simply looking for that great sounding demo disc to show off their home theater system, this audio mix by Lindsey Buckingham & Neal Heywood will impress with its clarity, dynamic range and ability to reveal what a single gifted singer backed only by his guitar is able to produce.",1320105600,14,3522,4.788778877887789
4833854,5,B005M26ZAA,"Lindsey Buckingham is one of my favorite musicians, and on this ""Songs From The Small Machine- Live In LA"" his artistry is as great as ever.  No need to go into details, a great performance!  I've got tickets for his show November 12th, can't wait.

8478963,5,B005M26ZAA,"There's a previous acoustic show out there (Live from the Bass Hall) that is a nice representation of a Buckingham solo guitar show. Such a show is a great one to go to.

This disc is the best of both acoustic and electric Lindsey. It's pretty obvious he expected this to be for posterity. It's beautifully recorded, filmed and sounds great.

For the first 6 songs, you get the acoustic show, with Buckingham at his solo best. Then he brings out the band and does some blistering versions of old favorites, along with great performances of solo works and stuff from the new album (Seeds We Sow).

Extras, he does a fascinating extended interview with a deep dive into Fleetwood Mac history and his own creativity.

If you like Fleetwood Mac, you'll love this show.

As concert videos go, God bless whoever filmed this. It's visually fascinating too. Whenever you want to see what he's doing with his guitar, you get to see.",1450742400,,923,4.638036809815951
