5077512,4,B007CF6S1Q,Another season of Royal Pains and after a couple of not so great seasons this one is back to form. Fun to watch and good writing again.,1433635200,,135,4.037037037037037

5077514,4,B007CF6S1Q,"While as a USA Network fan, Ive gotten quite used to their split seasons (and actually, I quite like their counter programming schedule), for some reason they decided to split the release of season 3 of Royal Pains on DVD.  While the first half of the season was released at the beginning of the year, we can now finish off the season with the season three volume two set.

The set contains the final six episodes of season 3 and picks up pretty much right where we left the HankMed gang.  One of Dr. Hank Lawsons (Mark Feuerstein) patients has collapsed because he was mistreated.  Unfortunately, the person responsible for his bad treatment is Hanks assistant Divya Katdare (Reshma Shetty).  Meanwhile, HankMed CFO Evan Lawson (Paulo Costanzo) is still trying to get the blessing to marry his fiance Paige Collins (recurring guest star Brooke DOrsay), and Jill Casey (Jill Flint) has decided it is time to get serious about wrapping up life in the Hamptons to move to the clinic is South America that needs her help.

Of course, with all this going on there are still the cases of the week involving a band with mysterious leg weakness, a party planner with panic attacks, and an actor with stomach pains.  In a first for the series, they bring back Tom Cavanaghs (sp?) pro-golfer Jack O'Malley for a multiple episode arc as his health, which he thought was under control, begins to go downhill.  Will Hank be able to get through to him in time to treat his new disease?

Despite the fact that the show is dealing with medical mysteries, it has always had a light tone.  Part of that is because of the setting.  Its hard to feel like it is too serious in a resort community when you're looking at life among the rich.  Part of that is because the show spends plenty of time looking at the lives of our main characters.  That aspect of the show can take on a soap opera quality, but its often light hearted.

That changes some in these episodes.  Theyre still fun, and there are still some great laughs, but the consequences of the earlier half of the season are definitely here and they definitely take a gray hue.  The last couple of episodes are definitely darker than normal, but it doesnt feel like such a departure considering what has come before.

When they first introduced Evans love interest, Paige, in season two, I figured she was a two or three episode guest star at best.  Ive been dreading the thought of them writing her out of the show because I really love her and I love how her character has matured Evan, arguably nothing but a goofball in season one.  The two of them are so sweet together, and they get the best scenes in these episodes as well.

As always, the acting from the main cast and the guest stars is perfect at keeping that blend of light heartedness while still taking the medical mystery seriously.  And when the story calls for them to be more serious, everyone takes it up a notch.

I still don't understand the reasoning behind creating a split season DVD release of this season of the show.  Its not like the cheaper price is going to attract new viewers to pick up the set casually.  I certainly wouldnt jump in and buy season 3 of a show Id never seen before no matter what the price. Thats especially true for something like this that requires a certain knowledge of the characters because of the ongoing stories before jumping in here.  And the odds of finding it on sale cheap enough to make me want to get it are slim.  Still, the set includes all six episodes on two discs in their native widescreen and full surround.  The only extra here is a gag reel.

I hope this is the last time that the USA Network tries the split season approach for their shows.  Still, the characters and stories are so fun that I cant help recommending Royal Pains season three volume two.",1428883200,,3816,4.497822931785196

5077536,4,B007CF6S1Q,Was tempted to continue rating this a five star but lately they're showing signs of writing themselves into a corner. Part of the tension in the longer plot was the impending doom of a major character. This season? The write it off in two scenes? Foolish.

5077547,5,B007CF6S1Q,"I'm a real fan of the Royal Pains TV series/  It is one of the favorites I enjoy watching so I had to have the DVD set.  However, I am unhappy that Lifetime has chosen to do TV series in two parts now vs one.  I've noticed that many of the lifetime DVD sets are starting to require that you buy two volumes to get the complete season vs one.  I guess it puts more many in their pockets and because they are doing this I'm less likely to buy the TV series as quickly as I was simply because of the increase in costs to obtain the two volumes and the space it takes up in my DVD collection.",1354406400,,588,3.875
5077548,2,B007CF6S1Q,"First let me say I really enjoy the show, and have up to this point, purchased all the seasons on disk. However, Season Three's split into Volume 1 and Volume 2 quite frankly blows. The least they could have done was lower the price, or add more extras, but nope, it was a ""here it is - take it or leave it"" deal, that I now wish I had left. I had waited until Volume 1 (finally) dropped in price before I bought it and I'm left wishing I had possessed the patience to have done the same for Volume 2. But nooooo. I just had to find out how the Season ended, and went ahead and bought Volume 2. Now I feel penalized for being a fan, and it'll be a cold day in you know where before I make the same mistake again.

The show remains engaging, the transfer quality is great, but in terms of content received vs. price paid this disk is TERRIBLE!!!

Shame on the Studio, Producers, Stars and everyone else associated with the decision to release Season 3 in two parts...  Shame on me for buying it anyway.",1347235200,3,1001,4.149484536082475
5077549,5,B007CF6S1Q,"Dr Hank Lawson together with his brother Evan again after a temporary but complicated split, has turned Hank-Med into a thriving medical practice even adding additional doctors and an office assistant(Page) Evan's fiancee. Amid a rather quirky social life Hank Lawson has managed to build quite a reputation with Hamptons residents and an on again off again relationship with his landlord the very eccentric Boris. Hank is some what a combination of Marcus Welby and MacGyver finding ways to help patients in trouble with so little as string and a stapler. This series is worth every minute of your time. Very enjoyable,funny heartwarming, and even sad at times. Great entertainment. Check out amazon.com for your copy today.",1345852800,,725,5.205128205128205
5077550,2,B007CF6S1Q,"I'm a collector of TV shows on DVD and I have a budget that I hold to when purchasing a season; I will not pay more than $1.00 per episode. I have spent years waiting to catch an acceptable price for some shows - the original Avengers for example, and have managed to stay within this set budget, but these split seasons are beginning to cause problems, especially when the split is uneven. Volume one of Royal Pains season three is ten episodes and volume two is only six. Now I might catch volume one on a special at $9.99, maybe around the holidays, but do you really think the price for volume two will ever drop to $6 or less?

The show has started to lose its appeal for me anyway; the medical parts of the episodes have begun to be a bit repetitious and in some cases just plain silly. The addition of the ""iconic"" Henry Winkler of Happy Days' fame has actually made me cringe. I have a hard time seeing Mr. Winkler as anyone other than ""The Fonz"" and while the younger generation may escape this mental time travel affliction, for me it's overpowering and makes every episode in which he appears just seem silly. I suspect Henry Winkler just may get his third shot at jumping the shark, how apropos that Boris had a shark hidden in a tank in season one; is it possible Henry Winkler was already tapped for the role of Hank and Evan's father? And speaking of silly, I'm actually afraid to see where the plot is headed since Hank accepted Boris' proposal. If the show survives this season, and I have my doubts, I believe it has one or two more seasons at the most.

Boycotting the purchase of split seasons just to protest the splitting of seasons is not my style; I will however, stick to my budget and if I never get the third season of Royal Pains it's not much of a loss. I usually catch the episodes when they're on or watch on demand within a day or two; there's not much competition in the time slot with the current schedule but if something new and interesting comes along I may be switching my viewing plan.",1344729600,13,2024,4.323684210526316
