8510417,5,B000KP7KXA,"This is an inspiring and moving film that looks at a selection of projects undertaken by Rural Studio. A variety of projects are covered that are at different stages within the design and build process. The film gives everyone involved the opportunity to speak including the clients, the students and the university lecturers that run the programme.

I would strongly recommend that anyone involved in design and architecture watches this film. However, I think that anyone who watches it would learn a lot from these people, whatever profession or background they're from.",1179014400,3,573,5.228260869565218
8510418,5,B000KP7KXA,"After viewing Chuck Schultz's wonderful documentary, ""The Rural Studio,"" I exclaimed two words: ROAD TRIP!!!!! I was immediately inspired to gather together some friends, pile into the car and visit what is called the Black Belt of Alabama (a central portion that runs from the Georgia state line to the Mississippi line where the Rural Studio is located) and see for myself the incredibly clever buildings and public spaces featured in this film of the same name.
The Rural Studio is a program that brings together architectural students from Auburn University with the residents of the Black Belt ( a rural and mostly poor area) to create, design and build structures and spaces for the community as well as for the needy. It provides students the opportunity to work face to face with clients as well as experience how their projects impact the local community. It began in the early 1990's and has produced dozens of projects ranging from private homes to places of worship. But to really experience how special this project you MUST see for yourself.
Chuck Schultz, director and producer, tells the story of the sometimes-controversial Rural Studio with sumptuous cinematography and seamless editing, using interviews with instructors, students and clients.  A community farmer's market, a chapel, a children's center and private homes are just a few of the projects that have been lovingly hand build by the students that are featured in ""The Rural Studio.""
Although no contractors are used in these constructions, many interesting and unorthodox materials, including rammed earth, automobile windshields and used tires are utilized. Because these projects are all provided gratis for those in need, the only thing the Rural Studio does not supply is the land. The rest of the building materials are provided through donations; the labor is done completely by the students, and most projects must be completed within the time constraints of one semester.
The finished projects are a study in innovation, community service and good old-fashioned philanthropy.",1170288000,6,2064,5.254545454545455

As we follow the families whose lives have been changed we are reminded of the disparities that still exist in America (even though the film focuses on the years from 1999-2001 we are still dealing with the same issues - think Hurricane Katrina and New Orleans) BUT it also gives us hope that if, like the students in the film, we reach out to help others in whatever way we can, we CAN make a difference - the spirit of volunteerism lives and this film captures the joy of that experience!",1166572800,3,739,4.4411764705882355
