2054150,5,B00020X9B0,"this movie was very good but like most people said there is no card that is autographed. there are 3 episodes and here is my summary for this video:
  After departing from the world martial arts tournament, Goku and Uub are nearly finished with their training session at the lookout. Also, Dende considers it a miracle that the lookout is still in one piece. But all is not well. Emperor Pilaf has managed to summon Shenron! With the planet's future hanging by a single wish from Pilaf's mouth, Goku braces for the worst. What does Pilaf desire? And more importantly, what does he get?! See where the final chapter of Goku's incredible journey begins!",1089504000,,651,4.701754385964913
2054151,3,B00020X9B0,"Well it's about time, these episodes are the correct begining for DBGT, I don't know why they released it as Lost Episodes, [My guess is that there is only the DBZ movies left, so they are trying to milk as much as they can for this series] because on the first DBGT disc there is a little quick summary episode of what happened before that discs 1st episode. It's very confusing, I was really exicited that DBGT was released on DVD and was disappointed that it didn't begin as it should have, cause there was a bunch of episodes missing. I first watch DBGT way back in 98, where the episodes were bootleg and subtitled on vhs. I was not real happy on the new installment of Dragon Ball, but once I started collecting the dvds, I really got into it. I will be adding this disc to my collection.",1088553600,7,794,4.3
8019943,4,B00020X9B0,"The lost episodes (5 sets) cover the original GT episodes 1-16 which were not originally released. Instead there was a first episode of GT that hashed all them into one to get the viewer up to speed about what had happened - such as why Goku was back to being a little boy. I already had the GT set and didn't realize these existed until recently and realized that without them my collection was incomplete. All the sets are pretty inexpensive so that was a plus, but each set is only about an hour. In some ways the early GT episodes remind me of the original Dragonball series - naturally since Goku is a child again, but also because of its light heartedness and even some storylines are suspiciously familiar - the encounter with the giant cat fish Sunama is very similar to the original Dragonball encounter with Oolong. If one enjoyed the original Dragonball series, GT is enjoyable, but if the main attraction to Dragonball is the fighting and power displays in Z then one could be easily disappointed, especially with the earlier episodes. Overall I liked GT - sure it wasn't as good as Dragonball or Z, but it does get better through the series.  I found SS4 interesting and stylish and liked the baby arc and the ending encounters with the dragons that emerged from the black star dragonballs. My only qualm now is attempting to reconcile certain details between GT and Dragonball Super. I suppose GT could be considered non-canonical in many ways. If you are a die hard Dragonball fan get the complete series and then these, but don't expect it to live up to Z or Super. I don't really like the dumb English rap intro to the series.",1525392000,,1643,4.569491525423729

8019950,5,B00020X9B0,OK this DVD is amazing. The problem is it only has 3 eps. I love Dragon Ball GT's English music unlike in dragon ball or Z.,1357776000,,123,3.769230769230769
8019951,5,B00020X9B0,"This movie was a lot better than I initially expected. I was stuck watching it with my 8 year old (for whom it was a gift) one day when I was running on the treadmill. I was surprised to find some interesting concepts about the nature of time, multiple dimentions, and heaven and hell mixed with issues around teamwork, friendship, and the notion that good and bad can exist in the same person at once. My son loved it and watches it regularly.",1231718400,,444,4.36144578313253
