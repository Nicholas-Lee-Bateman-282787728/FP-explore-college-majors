7983652,5,B00008G884,"For bachata lovers out there this is the concert of concerts. Not too often do we get to see bachata artists like Frank Reyes and Monchy and Alexandra on stage at the same time. Three for the price of one! The line up of songs alone set the tone for a tremendous evening. The next best thing to seeing them perform live is seeing the show on DVD. Each sang some of their fan favorites which easily could have been any song in their repertoire. Frank Reyes with his colossal hits Vine a decirte adios and Tu eres ajena and M & A with Hoja en blanco and Dos locos. No complaints with this one. Great acoustics, sound and the clarity is impeccable. This is a great concert for bachata aficionados. Do enjoy!",1093478400,3,704,4.3007518796992485
