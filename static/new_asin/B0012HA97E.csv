8245965,5,B0012HA97E,"I have viewed this DVD and find the method demonstrated is very interesting.  As a martial artist I can tell you that this method ,to me, makes a lot of common sense.  I have yet to get to a range and actual try it out.  I will update as I have a chance to practice.",1463270400,,266,3.8
8245966,4,B0012HA97E,"The video is reasonably well produced. There is quite a bit of wind noise and some fairly loud shooting going on in the background at the firearms range where this video was shot. The instructor, Mr. Jack Bar - Gioria does a very good job of explanation, Although Mr. Bar- Gioria has an Israeli accent, he is perfectly understandable and has an excellent command of English.  The length of the production is about right. the material is well covered. I have been a firearms instructor for thirty years and see nothing wrong with this technique, if it is well practiced. The important point to remember about the Israeli Instinctive Shooting Method is that it is combat proven, not once or twice but hundreds of times. There is no other method that can make that claim.
It is against the law in Israel to have a round in the chamber of a firearm and this applies to everybody, civilian, police and military. Don't tell the Israelis that this is a disadvantage. They see it as common sense.  In the U.S., i have witnessed dozens of negligent discharges with pistols. All but a few happened when the magazine had been removed, but the operator forgot about the round in the chamber. For many, if not most people who own a pistol for self-defense, the Israeli method  would be a good technique to adopt.
It is of interest that this exact method is the very same one used by elite Israeli Special Forces. Many people think that Special Forces would have some different method of using a pistol. No, it is exactly the same method that is taught to civilians,  Although the S.F. execution is much faster and more aggressive due to intense practice.
I paid about forty bucks for this DVD from AGI. I am  satisfied with the purchase.  In my opinion, the product is worth the money.",1339459200,,1772,4.591772151898734
8245967,5,B0012HA97E,This method is totally different from what is taught in most CCW courses in the United States. It allows you to carry without a round in the chamber and then (reasonably quickly) put a round on target. The length of the DVD seems about right for the length of material being taught.,1314576000,,282,4.4423076923076925
8245968,1,B0012HA97E,"The Israeli Combat Method, particularly the so called Israeli Draw, is  very fast, and effective.  It does not have the disadvantages assumed by the previous reviewer.

The simple truth is that most AD's and ND's occur as a result of having ""one in the pipe"".  This is not an issue with the Israeli method.  If you use this method you will never have one in the chamber until or unless you draw the weapon with the clear intention of shooting.

Until then it remains safe with an empty chamber.

The previous reviewer is confusing administrative unloading of a Glock which has already been fired.  Since all weapons fired - regardless of method - must later be handled and unloaded, this is not a fair criticism.

Bottom line:  the Israeli draw is as fast as any method, yet considerably safer insofar as AD's.  Under stress it is actually more reliable, especially for less experienced shooter, old, young or female.

My only criticism is that this method on DVD can be found for considerably less money.  AGI has one for about $40, IsraeliCombatShooting dot com has a very competent 2 disc set for about $80.  Based on price alone I have to give this just 1 star.",1251676800,,1165,4.619512195121951
8245969,2,B0012HA97E,"Although I found it interesting to see the ""Israeli Method"" of carrying a concealed weapon, it is not something that I will be practicing.

Accidental/negligent discharges can happen when people manipulate/handle firearms.  The beauty of a simple firearm, i.e. Glock or revolver, is that you only have a few steps; draw, aim, pull trigger, holster.  This ""method"" adds several steps; draw, rack slide, aim, pull trigger, remove magazine, rack slide to clear chamber, pull trigger again on empty chamber, holster.  More steps = more opportunity for things to go wrong.

I can see some merit in certain circumstances, i.e. soldier carrying a single action pistol in a shoulder or chest holster while working in a confined space like a tank.

For normal concealed carry, why not just purchase a good holster?",1207008000,,805,5.106870229007634
