8291846,5,B001D68NCC,"Being a collector of Train Videos, I knew that this was probably more of a travel-advertisement video than a real enthusiast-type film for railfans.

But actually, I was pleasantly surprised with this DVD.

The Great South Pacific Express is a relatively new train. Patterned after the Orient Express type trains of the early 20th century, the GSPE is actually newly-built rolling stock, a blend of handcrafted workmanship with modern conveniences such as air-conditioning, electric kitchens, etc.

Most of this video is shot on board. There's a few runby and pacing scenes but it's relatively minor. However, the interior of this train is so beautiful that you just want to see more of it. You get to see the state rooms, the smaller suites as well as the restaurant cars. The woodwork is really amazing.

There's a couple of interviews with management staff which gives more of an insight as to how the train was developed.

Toward the end, there's a segment on the skyrail aerial tram which is a main attraction at the northern end of the line.

Interestingly, while the passenger cars are of the utmost quality, the diesels pulling it look like a couple of beat-up freight locomotives - not really a match for this ultra-elegant passenger train.

All in all, even if you are a train fan, you will like this video.

Five Stars.",1243641600,6,1330,4.828193832599119
