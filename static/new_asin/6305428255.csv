1021360,1,6305428255,"It's your typical cliche-ridden teen movie with all the usual stereotypes but without the actual acting chops. The screenplay was written in 2 hours, it seems. Prinze was passable as was Union and Paquin. Beyond those 3, the acting was terrible and the female lead was lifeless. If you like Hallmark movies, this should be fine. Search out better teen movies like Clueless, Fast Times and 10 Things I Hate About You.",1511481600,2,416,4.791666666666667
1021361,3,6305428255,"Be aware that this review is for the Amazon version of the movie, not the original.  Originally, this movie is one of the more fun teenage RomComs out there.  From the connection Rachel Leigh Cook and Freddie Prinze Jr. obviously have, to Kieran Culkin and Anna Paquin as the younger siblings of these two, to Paul Walker and Jodi Lyn O'Keefe as the male and female villains, the movie is well acted, well written, and well directed.

Enter Amazon.  Amazon has taken terms like ""bumping uglies"" and turned it into ""jumping monkeys.""  It makes absolutely no sense in the movie.  If that were the only line they changed from something that made total sense to something which makes absolutely none, fine, but they don't stop there.  Twenty minutes in and the dubbing gets the sound and video so out of sync, it's incredibly difficult to watch (and I tried it on several different devices--it's not me, it's them), but when combined with their senseless censoring (I mean, ""bumping uglies""???  THAT needed to be changed?  It's a PG-13 film, not a G-rated film.  I think ""bumping uglies"" was probably okay for that audience), it becomes unbearable, mainly because I know the original version can be found occasionally on Netflix, and certainly on DVD.

Do not buy this version of the film, and really, I wouldn't even recommend it be rented here.  Do yourselves a favor and watch the original film.  Amazon, if you're listening, give some kind of warning that you've altered the film significantly from the original.

Yes, I gave it 3 stars still, because the original, IMO, is a 5 star film and there's enough left of it to make it a 3 star film, but nothing more.",1510876800,3,1661,4.70242214532872

1021503,5,6305428255,"A great movie along the lines of Never Been Kissed, Grease, and others like them, but actually better. A shy, introverted geek is targeted by a jock when a bet is made that he can make her prom queen just by being her boyfriend. I'm sure I'm not alone in saying that Laney was perfect before the makeover. And I was really glad that she, regardless of the change of looks, stayed the same in personality. That's one of the things I hated about Grease, that the main female had to come to terms with the fact that she had to change who she was fundamentally, to be able to be with a guy, who couldn't change because of peer pressure. There's also some social commentary weaved into the movie about people being tools of institutional art, being cast into a light that's not your own, among other things. Rachel Leigh Cook shines, as she usually does. Definitely recommended.",1507766400,,873,4.49685534591195

1021586,5,6305428255,"This movie is a lot of fun, somewhat predictable but what teen movies aren't? Laney Boggs dresses badly, doesn't use make-up, doesn't fit in with any of the cool people, and is very unsociable and unapproachable. So due to a bet with a friend, Zack Siler must not only get her to go to the prom with him, he has to help her win prom queen without her knowing it. All because his hot girlfriend dumped him and his (Mr good looking/Mr popular) status on campus is taking a real hit and he's out to salvage his image. At first, Laney will not give Zack the time of day, and figures he must be up to something because they have nothing in common, she actually asks him at one point, is this some kind of geek outreach program. Zack is completely determined to win the bet and presses on with his quest.

1021589,4,6305428255,"I actually saw the teen spoof movie Not Another Teen Movie before I ever saw this, and it just makes NATM so much better. This movie is classic late 90s, and a pretty good rom-com to veg out to on a weekend. Basically, the popular guy makes a bet with his friend that he can make any girl prom queen after being dumped by his prom queen contender girlfriend, and he ends up liking said girl. Freddie Prinze Jr. was great in this, but Matthew Lilliard takes the cake for me. I have to say don't really understand the casting for the ""hot queen bee"", she was not very attractive and quite out of shape..",1497744000,,601,4.234782608695652

1021665,4,6305428255,"Shes All That was part of a series of teen comedies that came out in that 1999-2001. The plot is not overly complex: popular athlete makes bet that he can make anyone prom queen and ends up falling for said girl. This creates some conflict, ending with a happily ever after or whatever passes for such in a teenager comedy. Its all wrapped up in this moral candy that says Dont Judge a Book by its cover. I don't really think there was anything in this movie that I had not seen before. But then again, I haven't been a teenager since 2006, so maybe Im just jaded and out of touch with that period in my own life.",1492214400,,613,4.159663865546219

1022423,3,6305428255,"This is a feel-good tale of the unpopular, 'underdog' girl rising to the top of the usual hateful school peer group - with the help of their top boy, who turns out to be a genuine good guy. I liked the 2 main characters very much (they're very engaging, actually) & the movie will draw you in, even though you already know how it will end (see: predictable); it still is fun. Some of the twists & turns are improbable and/or laid on a little thick, but again, it's one of those themes you recognize from the start, & either sign on or not: good guys vs. bad, popular kids vs. unpopular. Not too taxing, fun to watch, you will enjoy the cast.",1485129600,,641,4.219512195121951

1022662,3,6305428255,I saw this movie a long time ago. It was entertaining. The only thing that isn't realistic is that they keep picking attractive women for parts that are meant for less popular women. Its no secret we men are shallow when it come to looks and age. cute girls like this girl always has a guy interested in her. They could have rewritten the script a bit that made her less trusting of men and her school mates thought she was stuck up or something and he got into a bet that he could hook up with her. That's more realistic than making a bet that he can make any girl into a model by simply taking off her glasses and changing her hairstyle. Anyway the movie is still good to entertain. Not realistic in any way but neither is explosions in space or people who can fly because the sun is yellow. You will be entertained.,1485043200,,818,4.2165605095541405

1022670,5,6305428255,Loved the movie then and watched it after so many years....still love it. It is a reality check for each of us....no matter the popular athlete to the dorky artsy girl.....we all have feelings and sometimes it takes something different to actually make us move rather than casually standing still.....and in the process of an unfeeling and egotistical bet.....many people were affected and perhaps saw themselves for whom they really are and the reflection was not so pretty!,1484697600,,475,5.102564102564102

There were plenty of characters in the film (from actual nose pickers to flat-out ugly) who would have been the obvious and more likely choice for the ""Bet you can't take that girl to the prom"" wager.

1024305,4,6305428255,"I know I saw She's All That back when the movie first hit the theaters.  I don't know why I was so interested in seeing it back then, but I do remember enjoying it.  When I happened to catch it on TV recently, I found I enjoyed it just as much.

The story is really Pygmalion set in a modern day (for 1999) high school.  Zack (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) is the senior class president and the most popular guy in school.  Everyone thrills with just a moment of his time, even if he doesnt quite remember their names.  He returns from Spring Break to find that his long time girlfriend Taylor (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) has hooked up with Brock Hudson (Matthew Lillard), star of The Real World, and dumped Zack as a result.

As his friends try to cheer him up, he swears he could turn any girl into the prom queen in the six weeks between now and the prom.  A bet is made with Dean (Paul Walker), and his project turns out to be Laney (Rachael Leigh Cook).  Shes an artist and a loner and is the one person on campus who doesnt swoon over Zack.  Will he be able to earn her friendship and win the bet?  Or is he doomed to lose?

As I mentioned, this movie borrows the plot heavily from Pygmalion, better known to audiences today as My Fair Lady.  However, I actually like the characters in this movie, so I find it easier to root for them.  (Sorry, but Ive never cared for Henry Higgins, which is why I prefer the original ending to Pygmalion over the happy ending of My Fair Lady.)

Of course, this is played out over a high school romantic comedy type story, and it is actually pretty funny.  Yes, there are some laughs at how dated the film already is (everyone has pagers instead of cell phones), but there are some genuinely funny moments as well.  I would say I was smiling more than I was laughing for most of the film, but I was having fun.  The best laugh?  Its got to be the final scene.  And thats all Im saying.

Now that isn't to say the plot was original or surprising.  You pretty much know where things are going from the beginning.  But as I always say, if you are engaged with the characters and having fun getting there, that's all that really matters.

The actors are what make this movie so much fun.  Its easy to root for the main characters because Freddie and Rachael make them so likable.  The supporting cast is great, especially Matthew Lillard who has made crazy a staple of his acting career.  As a fan of psych, I got a kick out of watching Dule Hill as one of Freddies friends.

No, it isn't anything original or ground breaking, but She's All That is fun.  And if you want to escape for 90 minutes, you won't go wrong with this movie.",1434153600,,2650,4.233532934131737

1026247,2,6305428255,"This had the hallmarks of another Pygmalion story. Had it been, it would have been worth it, even if that motif can seem hackneyed. Yes, it has the redeeming story of an outstanding young girl being recognized for her outstanding character, and a young man shifting from being a predatory jerk to understanding the humanness of a young woman. But the way the story gets there is pretty repulsive. You can communicate that others are jerks without explicitly showing their jerkiness, especially when it involves sexual behavior.

I was writing a lot of Illyria stories from Angel (they'll also go with my wicked cool Halloween costume that I just planned, I always plan this holiday early...and I got a little behind) I had watched this with my friends at the beginning of the month, (I hadn't seen it in forever and I forgot how fun it was. 1st off I want to g e t to the spoof from Not Another Teen movie, because for the most part that was the best part(and if you've wondering; no I do not mean the American Pie connection with it; I didn't really care for that) No the 1st thing I mean is her movie names are funny, Janie Briggs is the spoof name, and Laney Boggs is the one in the Real movie...okay that's weird.....so I just switched the names around. I also think it's funny when they describe her, oh not Laney Boggs (remember I switch the names around!) She's got glasses and a ponytail, and she's got paint on her over_all's come on! Me and my friends all thought that was really funny! Okay enough with the spoof, here's the Real movie...1st and even if this sounds cliche' I was the Weird Chick in my school. I love (and still do) monsters, and bad (and good scary movies (Vampire ones like Lost Boys)  and Bad Boys like my husband and Corey Feldman when other girls were into...well whatever popular girls were into during Our Grunge Era, Personally I didn't really care, cause I don't like those kind of people..I like what I like and I like hanging out with the outcast crowd cause were all about being ourselves. That's one of the main reasons I like this movie so much. Because it also shows that you can be true to yourself. The funny thing is I actually do like the main popular chick (but she reminds me of Cordelia on Buffy) The only time I don't is when she's mean to Janie (again name switch) Cause Oh! You're having a bad night so you're gonna take it out on her when she's having fun? (That's why I like Cordelia who is a nice person turns out, but not Popular people) and my guy likes to cheer me up if I'm having a bad day by reminding me of something fun we did...like a fun memory or a song that cheers you up and says Remember We or you were having fun, try it...it works) and I like the dance scene, even though it's heavily choreographed (surprisingly I like dances, but not all in a Carrie way like you'd think, cause lately in some other stories I wrote some Casablanca like Dance scenes with the song Dream a little dream in it (I love that song it reminds me of Happy Summers I had.) I didn't care much for that guy who gets The Foghorn alarm, which was pretty great by the way...but I did think it was also pretty funny how close that scene was to the one with the Green Goblins son from Spider Man with Toby McGuire in the 1st movie. I loved the ending and how it mirrored the ending of Twilight and Hey it took place at Sunnydale High and Buffy was there...that was pretty cool!",1380067200,,2991,4.2381786339754814

Like,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clueless/dp/B002A9X9DE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clueless</a>&nbsp;transplants Jane Austen's Emma to Beverly Hills.

She's All That is a modern take on George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, as well as a teen twist on Pretty Woman. These movies support that notion that no one really has an original story anymore. But at least you can dust off that old chestnut and present it in ways that are witty and interesting. Sometimes, it really just boils down to presentation.

Spring break done, and Zach Siler (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and his fellow students are looking forward to the remaining six weeks of schooling at Harrison High. Zach is rich and good-looking, is the class president, captain of the soccer team, most popular guy in school. He loses a bit of shine when his smoking hot girlfriend, the stunning but oh-so-hateful Taylor Vaughan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe), breaks up with him on account of her having hooked up with a reality television star while spring breaking in Daytona Beach.

Zach's feelings are stung, and this makes him vulnerable to his buddy's taunting. In one of those wagers in which you just know someone's gonna get hurt, Zach posits that he can take any girl in school and, in six weeks' time, make her prom queen. But he balks at the girl his pal finally picks out: Laney Boggs.

Laney (Rachel Leigh Cook) is mousy and sullen and unapproachable. She's a brooding artist whose art suffers because of her inability to open up. Sinking her even more in school clique status is that her dad (Kevin Pollak) is the neighborhood pool man. When Zach approaches her at the falafel fast food joint where she works (site of one of the film's funniest scenes), Laney assumes that he requires tutoring lessons, never mind that Zach has the school's fourth highest G.P.A. But our boy's nothing but persistent and she finally caves and agrees to hang out. They rendezvous at a performance art theater where we see Lanie on stage capering around with weird make-up caked on her face. And when she challenges Zach to go improv on stage and he does this telling bit with a hacky sack, that moment is when I got clued in that there's more to the guy than his big-jock-on-campus creds and living under the shadow of a demanding father.

The best thing about this movie is that it's not willing to settle for rolling out a by-the-numbers narrative. It's smart and has heart and is exuberant and is so much fun. The prom queen election and even Laney and Zach's relationship serve as a platform to observe the differences in class and social life style. It doesn't hurt that the exploration leads to many very funny moments and plenty of snappy zingers. Prinze Jr. and Cook have incredible chemistry, but I also appreciate the presence of Kevin Pollak who is warm and steady as Laney's father and hilarious in an unobstrusive way. One of the film's showcase scenes involves him at home absent-mindedly hurling wrong answers at Jeopardy even as the JV soccer team does housekeeping around him. He finally looks up and says: ""Who are you people?"" She's All That was an unexpected surprise when it came out in 1999. It features a grip of supporting actors that are very recognizable today (Paul Walker, Anna Paquin, Usher, Matthew Lillard, etc.). It also vindicates my aversion of the pizzas in my old high school cafeteria.",1378166400,5,3744,5.173267326732673

I fell in love with the average, normal looking Laney (who really looks like a high-schooler instead of a model they use nowadays), and the ever-so handsome Zack (who is surprisingly not a football player)! I loved how she was transformed, and how they both were transformed for one another. This was a dynamic, intense teen romantic comedy.

1026774,3,6305428255,"""She's All That"" (1999) is a school dramedy/romance flick -- more drama than comedy -- about a pretty, but outcast, mousy girl (Rachael Leigh Cook) who suddenly has a couple of popular guys interested in taking her to the prom (Freddie Prinze Jr. and Paul Walker). Their motivations are questionable and it stirs up the hot vixen of the school (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe). Matthew Lillard, Anna Paquin and Lil Kim are also featured.

The cast is great and this is a worthy story about a social outcast coming out of hiding, so to speak. But the potential depth of the plot needed fleshed-out more and the film's just too sentimental for my tastes -- numerous moments where characters share deep feelings, etc. Don't get me wrong, I can get into some share-your-feelings type scenes, but I didn't care enough about the characters here to make it meaningful or engrossing.

Still, the message is good and the main cast members are superb. Plus there's no raunch, which is refreshing. Those who enjoy sentimentality will appreciate it more than I did.

The film runs 95 minutes and was shot in the greater Los Angeles area (Redondo Beach, Malibu, Torrance and Cerritos).

1027117,1,6305428255,"So, I wanted to watch this movie because it seemed like a more modern version of My Fair Lady.  Well, I love the story of Pygmalion.... While My Fair Lady spends about 20 minutes focusing on HOW Eliza works hard to change her speech to become a lady and a good many hours focusing on really annoying musical numbers, this movie spends about 20 minutes focusing on the actual plot of the story between the main two characters and about 3 of those minutes focusing on how she goes from being a nerdy reject to being ""All That.""  So, what is the rest of the movie about?  Pay attention here parents!  The rest of the movie is full of adolescents making ASSES of themselves!  There's a lot of teen drinking/substance abuse, vulgar and crude behavior, discussion of sex like it's something you do to rack up your points on your score card and scenes of implied sex with a minor (or at least she is still in high school) and an adult.  There are a lot of things in this movie that are just plain disgusting to the point that they are absurdly stupid and distracting from the actual plot (Example:  two teenagers who eat--upon request of the 'Hero' of the story--food covered in pubic hair... and they just obey him without objection--was the dude that wrote that into the script drunk at the time?).

Okay, so if you remove the 1 hour and 16 minutes of Crap from the movie it would actually leave you with a few scenes of decent acting where the main characters are portrayed as good kindhearted characters who have sincere feelings for one another in respectable ways....  Unfortunately, the story didn't focus at all on that and as a result the fact that this movie has any good in it at all just make it SUCK all the more!

Summary:  It's like a fresh cow pie with a tiny piece of decent chocolate cake burred inside.

1027208,4,6305428255,"Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachel Leigh Cook make for a very entertaining couple in this film.  It's one of those kinds of films where someone is put to the challenge of turning the ugly duckling into a stunning beauty.  A popular guy of the school takes on a bet that it can be done, and so Rachel Leigh Cook is the subject of transition.  For being a guy in my forties, I can still feel a little of a flashback of my high school days since this film continued to be charming in it's portrayal of modern day high school kids, which some movies (like ""American Pie"" ishh!) chose to entertain the warped teen (problems at home type) psyche that does not interest us all.

And, why any guy could be attracted to, or how any of the other girls of the school could be aspired to, want to be just like that girl Taylor, a self-absorbed, foul mouthed, everyday mattress-back skank. That I will never know.  I guess it's good casting to have that less than appealing blonde witch play the foe competing for the prom queen crown.

I am pleased too, that they have just released Drew Barrymore's ""Never Been Kissed"" on to Blu-Ray as well.  These two make for a great double feature on Blu-Ray for me and my wife this weekend.  For a triple feature, I could just add ""Mean Girls"".  And if you like the ""turn to ugly duckling into a beauty queen"" type of movie, check out ""Americanizing Shelley."" A nerdy Indian girl from India comes to America and with the help of two guys, she's transformed into a goddess of ultimate beauty. A totally innocent fun film for the whole family.

Anyway, I hope more of our favorite ""high school days"" type films finally get released onto Blu-Ray someday soon.  I'd still like to get on Blu-Ray: ""Pretty in Pink"", ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"", ""The Revenge of The Nerds"", ""Weird Science"", ""Mischief"" and perhaps the ""Porky's"" trilogy.

I grew up in a rural amish community and was never allowed any of the royalities of the average american boy.  I actually just left my family's farm recently due to my yearning to experience more of the outside world.  While father Samuel and I were plowing the west field in the hopes to be done before the days end, we heard a loud crashing noise.  We followed the sound until we came across an automobile that had crashed into a tree.  Since we did not find anyone around, we took what we could from the vehicle.  while father was occupied, i noticed a strange device that was called a blue ray player.  after a hearty supper, i snuck out to the barn in the hopes to satisfy my curiosity.  after pressing buttons and flipping switches, a light appeared.  i then realized that this must be a motion picture.  what happened in the next 95 minutes changed me forever.  i was so taken in by these people.  mr. prinze jr. has to be the biggest hollywood star in the world!  immediately after writing this review, i am going to find out how many academy awards this man has because i'm sure its at least 8.  and rachel leigh cook is an angel from heaven!  she makes my girlfriend Mary Hershberger look like the inside of a pig's rear end.  please don't tell her i said that.  both of these thespians must be making so many movies because of their unique talents!  best motion picture ever!  if all movies are half as good as this, then i am in for a real treat!  thank you hollywood for giving me this treasure.",1325548800,9,1592,4.3141891891891895

1027213,3,6305428255,"1.  Freddie Prinze Jr.'s character, Zach Siler, was likable, but was he believable? He was a jock, but he was a nice guy. Yeah, right. His big dilemma was whether he should go to Dartmouth or Harvard. And we care and feel sympathy because???  Also, he was the BMOC, but why? Because he was class president and the captain of the soccer team? Who cares about soccer? This is America, and football rules. And not the football that sissy Europeans mean when they say football.

2.  Rachael Leigh Cook was so short; she really looked like she belonged in kindergarten. Rachael Leigh Cook? Try Rachael ""Short Order"" Cook. Her character's name, Laney Boggs, was a nod to Wynona Ryder as Lelaina ""Laney"" Pierce in Reality Bites and Kim Boggs in Edward Scissorhands. I knew Wynona Ryder when she shoplifted in a store I worked at, and Rachael Leigh Cook is no Wynona Ryder. Also, she didn't make a convincing artist, or even a convincing art student. The script didn't take her art seriously, and why should we? Her performance art was a string of hackneyed clich&eacute;s. I mean, come on. Midgets writhing under a sheet? Been there, done that.

-----------------------
Zach Siler: What was that?
Laney Boggs: I was busy.
Zach Siler: Yeah, busy wiggin'.
Laney Boggs: I did not wig.
Zach Siler: Oh, there was major wiggage.
=======================================

3.  Matthew Lillard was Reality TV 'star' Brock Hudson. What kind of name is Brock Hudson? If the whole Reality TV shtick wasn't so done, over, and overdone, it MIGHT have been an effective parody. I like that Rick James song, ""Give It To Me, Baby"" and it didn't deserve the treatment it got from Brock Hudson's choreography.

4.  Paul Walker was Zach's rival, Dean Sampson. He was much better as Lance Harbor in Varsity Blues, made the same year as SAT (She's All That). Varsity Blues was funnier, and also more dramatic. Varsity Blues was what SAT wishes it could have been.

------------
Dean Sampson: His dad owns Harrison Ford.
Laney Boggs: The actor?
Dean Sampson: No, the car dealership.
======================

5.  Jodi Lyn O'Keefe as Prom Queen Taylor Vaughan was just so lame. I REALLY didn't care. She was supposed to be such a major diva, but she was a major drag. It would have been slightly better if Laney Boggs had stood up to her when she poured her drink down Laney's insubstantial d&eacute;colletage. A perfectly good cat fight opportunity tossed away. At least Zach should have done SOMETHING. While playing Nash Bridges' daughter, Jodi Lyn O'Keefe was rumored to be involved with Don's Johnson.

6.  Anna Paquin was Mackenzie Siler, Zach's sister. What a waste of an Oscar winner. What few good lines there were, were mostly Pacquin's, but that's not saying much.

----------------
Mackenzie Siler: When was the last time you tweezed?
Laney Boggs: What?
Mackenzie Siler: I mean your eyebrows.
Laney Boggs: Never, why?
Mackenzie Siler: Ever watch Sesame Street?
Laney Boggs: Yeah.
Mackenzie Siler: You know Bert?
============================

7.  Kieran Culkin as Simon Boggs was another waste of resources. At least Zach stood up to Simon's bullies--which kind of made me question his priorities when he did absolutely nothing when Laney was being bullied by Taylor. Kieran Culkin excelled as Buster in The Cider House Rules. I wonder if Kieran was any good in Igby Goes Down?

8.  Gabrielle Union was Katie, and she was also Chastity in 10 Things I Hate About You. In both movies, she played a friend or sidekick, and would have been much more interesting to focus on than the ostensible main characters. Is it because she's black? With Dul&eacute; Hill as Preston, I wonder the same thing. He played a complex character on The West Wing very well, but isn't given much to do in SAT.

9.  Elden Henson as Jesse Jackson was the chubby friend of Laney, always supportive, always there for her. In a very minor subplot, he may have hooked up with Zach's sister Mackenzie at the prom. This character should have been gay. That would have been more realistic, by far. Compare him to the character who was Lindsay Lohan's friend in Mean Girls, and it is no contest. What's up with that name, Jesse Jackson? Is that supposed to be funny? Less funny, even, than Brock Hudson.

10.  Usher Raymond was the Campus D.J. and Kimberly 'Lil' Kim' Jones was Alex, and they represent yet more missed opportunities for SAT. I didn't even recognize 'Lil' Kim' but then again I am unfamiliar with her oeuvre, but I've heard of her because of her Martha Stewart situation. And I don't mean that she fashioned pine cones and discarded bottle caps into decorative placemats, I mean that she did time in the slammer. In 2005, Lil' Kim served a yearlong prison sentence for lying to a jury about her friends' involvement in a shooting four years earlier. Let me just say one last thing, that along with the jabs at Reality TV, the rap and hip hop elements that they injected into SAT have a very short shelf life, and only make SAT seem all the more outdated in retrospect.

For all the musical talent onscreen, the only soundtrack numbers that clicked for me were ""Kiss Me"" by Sixpence None the Richer, and the dance at the prom sequence set to ""The Rockafeller Skank"" by Fatboy Slim. The latter was only thrown in at the last minute to pad the running time, which came up short.

What's with the deal between Zack and his dad? Did they really need to have issues considering the fact that none of them make any sense in relation to the main story? Lanie's stereotypical personality of a geeky loner is just thrown in there only to fit into the stereotype, her personal issues are completely unexplored. It's all about the bet and turning a beautiful ""ugly-duckling"" into a prom queen. Which is another issues, because Lanie is not unattractive at all.

Another problem is that high school is completely misrepresented. Nobody dresses the way Taylor and her friends do, nobody would go crazy over Zach as the majority of the female population does. Plus, the actors are a decade too old to play high school kids.

1027342,3,6305428255,"This is the classic turn-a-nerd-into-a-star movie, where a bet between popular people ends up leading to an unpopular person being used.  However, in typical fashion, the unpopular person ends up being the bigger person, and eventually teaching one of the cruel, selfish popular people something about life.

The biggest problem with this movie is that Rachael Leigh Cook is the nerd and Freddie Prinze Jr. is the agent for change.  I can buy Prinze as the big man on campus, but Cook as the unpopular, awkward, artsy student?  Maybe the latter two are believeable, but there is no world in which Cook is the unpopular girl in school while looking like she does.  In the High School social structure, Cook's beauty puts her in the upper-echelon of students

As far as the movie, Cook plays Lanie, a beautiful but somewhat reclusive girl into performance art and worldly problems.  Somehow, she goes nearly unnoticed by the in-crowd.

The bet is made between Dean (Paul Walker) and class President Zack Tyler (FP Jr.) that, after a breakup with his girlfriend, Zack can turn anyone into prom queen.  Lanie is selected because she's SOOO undesirable.  And, despite the fact that all it took to ""make her cute"" was a hair cut, a new dress, some makeup, and the removal of her horn-rimmed glasses, her transformation is completely baffling to every one of the popular kids.  Then the big confrontation happens between the ex-girlfriend and Lanie in the battle for Prom Queen.

The only real point to this movie was as a spring-board for several young stars.  Aside from those already mentioned, Gabrielle Union, Anna Paquin, Usher, Matthew Lillard and a host of others also make contributions as supporting actors.",1208649600,,1710,4.937062937062937

1027344,3,6305428255,"I'd like to think that I am smarter than to watch teen movies, as I haven't been one in a long time.  And yet, even the stiffest, most serious of intellectuals such as myself want a little trash now and then so we don't have to think too hard.  This was not bad, not bad at all.

This modern day update of Pygmailion / My Fair Lady takes us to a California high school.  It's almost the end of the year, and the senior class is getting ready for their end of the year, pre graduation antics.  Among them is Laney, the Eliza Doolittle, off in her artistic corner sulking away while the popular kids are off doing things that popular kids do.  Freddie Prince Jr, in one of his many leading man roles in teen movies, is the most popular guy in school who has been thrown a sudden curveball.  His girlfriend, Taylor, suddenly drops him after going down to Florida for spring break and falling into a hopeless (and I do mean hopeless) affair with Matt Lillard, ""star"" of the latest season of The Real World on MTV.  His friends comfort, but say that he can find another date for the prom just as quickly.  They bet him that they can not only find him another woman, but based on his good looks, charm and popularity he can take a lost cause and make her just as A List as he is.  They single out Laney, and the chase is on.

A few things put me off about this movie.  Firstly, this wasn't a new story (it's Pygmalion / My Fair Lady, like I said).  Secondly, it is possible that people really are mindless sheep enough to go along with something once a person in power says to do it, as eventually Laney will not be tarred and feathered once Zach starts bringing her to parties out of her area.  Third, if Zach really was such a nice guy (which he seems to be), I have a hard time believing that someone like him would be with a shrew like Taylor to begin with.  Looking back, I realize that a lot of the popular kids got their ways with people by making them look bad before others (like when Taylor pours her drink down Laney's dress), and Zach seems too good to do something like that to someone.  And fourth, Laney was hot underneith all those ugly clothes and hostile attitude, you could tell through those overalls and thick glasses.  Naturally if and when she got dolled up, she would be all she could be rather than look like an ogre in a dress.

It's ultimate message, that true change is not cosmetic but comes from within, does not come off as forced or cynical.  The cast is quite appealing.

1027348,2,6305428255,"I first saw this movie in high school-I believe i was a senior-And I remember thinking, ""High school is NOT like this at all!"" Throughout the whole movie. Now, I do understand that this is a fictional movie and therefore it is set in a fictional world, where anything is possible (except Laney Boggs becoming Prom Queen of course), but I felt like this movie was so far out into la la land with it's premise and execution that it was hard to really relate or like any of the characters in the movie. First of all, why do movies always have to over-exagerate the bitchiness of a Prom Queen??? In my school, the Homecoming Court and Prom Court were chock full of nice, friendly kids, and the ones who took home the crowns were voted on because of there personalities, not because they were HOT like Taylor Vaugh or whatever her name was. I hate that stereotype because it doesn't relate to any school-at least any school in the midwest! Also, What was so terribly heinous about Rachel Lee Cook that they would pick her over ANY other girl in the school-So what if she wore ugly clothes and had big glasses-the girl has a killer face and a tiny little body...her only flaw was her love for being a loner. Freddy Prinze Jr. was at his peak in this movie though-he seems to have gone WAYYYYYYY downhill since this movie was released. The best part about this movie is the cheesy makeover sequence when Laney walks down the stairs to Sixpence None The Richer's song KISS ME. The BIGGEST let down of this movie to me though was that Taylor won Prom Queen over Laney. Seriously, that still pisses me off to this day. The ending was just a complete and utter bomb...I wanted that skank Taylor to lose and cry or get totally laughed at or at least have had SOME minor bad thing happen to her. She was just a horrible, snotty witch and nothing bad seemed to happen to her. Oh well, this movie is pretty lame...I will always remember it though because I saw it in the theater with three of my close friends our senior year. Cheesy movie...Laney Boggs was robbed!!!",1149897600,2,2052,4.431216931216931
1027349,5,6305428255,"I love this movie. While the teen movie stereotypes are always apparent in every film, ""She's All That"" doesn't go overboard and, surprisingly, presents a relatively realistic view of the high school social strata.

After Zach, the class president and soccer star, is very publically dumped by his ""magically delicious"" (and equally popular) girlfriend, Taylor, he's hard put to maintain his legacy.

Uber-jock, though a little slow, Zach's friend, Dean, bets him that he can't replace Taylor and make any girl prom queen.

Enter Laney Boggs, an art student who cares little about the social scene. Dean picks Laney as Zach's prom queen ""project"" and Zach has a hard time convincing Laney to even go out with him.

Meanwhile, Taylor, the ex, is dating a Real World reject who she met over spring break, but she's still catty over her ""discards"" and is horrible to Laney, embarassing her at a party.

The more time Zach spends with Laney, the more he starts to like her and Laney begins to open up and finds a real outlet in her art.

Dean, sensing he might be about to lose the bet, asks Laney to prom before Zach gets around to it and, a recently single Taylor, attaches herself to Zach's arm, assuming he'll take her back.

Ultimately, feelings are hurt, battle lines are drawn...and a really cool dance scence takes place at the prom.

I love the fresh comedy in the movie that is amusing for teens without being impractical or raunchy. The characters are well-developed and actually evolve in a realistic fashion (even if you are left wondering how nice-guy Zach ever dated self-absorbed Taylor Vaughn).

All-in-all, there's really nothing comparable to the teen movies like ""Sixteen Candles"" or ""Pretty In Pink"" because those are genres unto themselves, but ""She's All That"" is definitely a nice representation of a good, modern teen movie.",1135641600,9,1845,4.887820512820513

Her wit and charm really shine in her role of Laney. Now, on to the story. Like I said before, it's predictable. First off, we see Zack (school stud and senior class president) get brutally dumped by his girlfriend, Taylor. Everyone knows, or has known a Taylor. Like Zack says, strip away all that attitude and makeup and all you have is a C- average in a wonder bra. And, according to Zack with the right look and guy by her side anyone girl can reign the title of prom queen. However, Zack's not so helpful best friend, Dean, disagrees. So, the bet was made and the race was on. So, who was going to be Zack's ""extreme makeover?"" None other than art student and not so graceful, Laney Boggs. After trials and tribulations Laney finally gets nominated and runs against Taylor for the queen's crown. Everything's perfect. Zack has turned Laney into the perfect girlfrind, and the lovable girl to win the votes. But, will this happily-ever-after be crumbled to shreads when Dean spills the beans on the bet just to throw Zack a curve ball? Does Laney defeat Taylor? You have to watch.

A great story about the fact that if your a ugly girl and a hot guy like freedy prince asks you to a dance he prolly is doing it for a bet to win money or an Augie Ojeda jersey or he is suffering from amniesia and thinks your Hilary Duff.

Great cmaeo by the guy who wwas in Scooby, summer catch and Scream you may remember in Scream he says ""Stand back, this one a really sceamer.""

I obtanined 9wink-wink)a used copy of this movie back in 2000 but i gave it to my friend cuz i thought he would watch it w/ his sister who I was crushing over at the time. Ends up i never got it and i only was with the sister for 3 1/2 months, so iwaish i nbever gave him this movie.

Buy it if you love Freedie (LIKE ME!!) or think that Racheal LEeigh Cook is HOT! (which she is but not anymore just like my friends sister)

Great lesson learned about prom and there is atleast 7 references to Sega which ad the gresatet game ever TEAM USA basketball straing Christian Laettner

1027452,4,6305428255,"Zack Siler (Freddie Prinze Jr) is doing fine - he's just started his last 8 weeks of high school, he's class president, he's dating the most desirable girl in high school, and they are a shoo-in for prom king and queen. Everything's good until his girlfriend arrives at school. Taylor Vaughn (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) got a tattoo on spring break, and she is now dating Brock Hudson (Matthew Lillard), whose only claim to fame is that he's an idiot on MTV's Real World reality TV. Zack is hurt, especially when his friend Dean (Paul Walker) razzes him about it. Zack responds by claiming he can make any girl in school into the prom queen. That's the kind of statement that leads to a bet. Dean says he'll choose a girl for Zack's challenge, and he chooses Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook).

Laney is about as big an outsider as Taylor's ego. She's an artist - she has been advised that many artists are more appreciated after they are dead, so she should kill herself (we all need ""friends"" like that, right?). She looks after her father and her brother. She's clumsy. She wears unattractive glasses. She wears no makeup. She wears overalls. She even wears a daggy hat while she works in a fast-food joint. They've pulled out all the stops to try to make the beautiful Rachael Leigh Cook look plain (they failed, but they tried hard!).

This is the predictable My Fair Lady type of story, or so it seems at first, especially when Zack's sister Mackenzie (Anna Paquin) gets involved to do a make-over on Laney. But there are some nice little twists, and they add up to a film that's different enough to be a pleasant time. Two of the interviewees mention that this film was deliberately modelled on early John Hughes films; I'm not sure I'd agree with that, but it does capture the idea of the romantic comedy / teen comedy genre to which this film belongs.

There are some interesting lesser characters in this film. We get to see Gabrielle Union and Clea DuVall as minor characters, and Sarah Michelle Gellar in a non-speaking role (she's included in a list headed ""They're all that"" in the end-credits). Tim Matheson, in a single real scene as Zack's father, was haggard-looking, but convincing.

1027454,5,6305428255,"I absolutly adore Rachel Leigh Cook who plays Laney in this movie, I have seen many of her movies, Josie and the pussycats, Tom and Huck, The Babysitters Club, of course She's all that, and more she's just an amazing beautiful and talented actress. She brings such honestly and virtue to all her characters and while being beautiful she's not the kind of beautiful where she looks unapprochable, she looks like she would be a normal down-to-earth person that could of easily went to your school. I think she's absolutly adorable. I love her little girl face.
Like I said she plays Laney, a high school senior who is the ""geek"" of her high school she's known as the ugly duckling. It's obvious that the people who did this movie realized it's impossible to make it a total transformation like in The Princess Diaries cause Rachel can't go from downright ugly and sad to stunningly beautiful like others can because she's naturaly beautiful and her beauty doesn't come from makeup a fancy hairdo or a skimpy outfit. But they made an effort to give her plain nothing special long hair, big glasses and a clumsy nature to make her an ugly duckling. But Cook took what she had to work with and slamdunked it.
Freddie Prinze Jr. plays oppisite of Rachel as Zach the most popular guy in school who seemed like he had everything going for him. Cute, popular, smart, dating the hottest girl in school who is up for prom queen, a jock, your typical popular guy. But when his girlfriend Taylor  (played by the beautiful and talented Jodi Lyn O'Keefe who often gets the sexy and popular but downright bit**y roles thrown at her. But she's still one of my favorites) comes back from spring break, she also comes back with a new tattoo and a new famous boy toy (played by the always goofy Matthew Lillard) so she drops Zach like a hot burrito which is a major burn to his ego and reputation.
Zach's best friend (played by sexy Paul Walker from the fast and the furious movies) offers him a bet. He gets to pick a girl for Zach to date and transform into prom queen material in only a few weeks and whoever loses has to go to graduation naked. Zach agrees, and guess who he picks. You guessed it, Laney. At first Laney is totally turned off by Zach's sudden interest but slowly starts to hang out with him and as she does Zach's little sister gets rid of the glasses cuts her hair and gives her makeup and a little red dress and suddenly Laney is known as Taylor's competition for prom queen and Zach becomes smitten for real.
Laney has to deal with Taylor who when her new boy toy kicks her to the curb suddenly wants to pick Zach back up but of course he's not interested anymore cause he likes Laney and this makes Taylor jealous at Laney. She also has to deal with Zach's friend who arranged the bet and picked Laney thinking he was sure to win the bet but now feels threatened and so decides to try to get Laney for himself and make Zach look like a jerk to her.
The attraction between Laney and Zach is undeniable and when he starts hanging around her she inspires him to be a nice guy and to look at where his future is headed.
The whole cast is great and it's a lot better protrayal for teens and more believeable then other teen movies are. It's a funny, touching story that I think everyone will love especially teenagers.",1082332800,2,3317,4.419934640522876

1027457,4,6305428255,"The cover says it all.  This is a romantic comedy, a relationship movie about two people.  If that's what you are in the market for viewing, you will not be disappointed by the stereotyped portrayal of other characters or annoyed by the cheesy rendering of high school life.  These are only plot devices.  But because of them I witheld one (only one) star.
Several reviewers note Rachael Leigh Cook's striking talent and charm; I concur.  There are few other movies that are written to showcase her as well as this one, but I am hoping some will be made.  A few rebuttals are in order to some other comments.  There is no skin in the movie, and only one curse word (appropriately uttered).  And it will not undermine your preferred sexual orientation.
The plot is a combination of Cinderella and the equally common idea that a social manipulator falls for his own tricks (Cupid pricking himself with his own arrow in Cupid & Psyche).  For all the comic intent, the resolution is surprisingly down to earth and satisfying.  The very last scene likely would be forbidden in the real world, but it's funny and confirms the characters.  Only one aspect of character motivation bothered me.  If Zach is so insightful about people and relationships, what was he doing hanging around Taylor in the first place?  And where does he get his insight?  Not from his father.  I guess it would make the movie too long and too serious to explain this, so just suspend disbelief.  Laney's character, by comparison, is fully motivated and explained.
There is a music video among the extras which is a gem!  ""Kiss Me"" performed by Sixpence (from their self-titled CD).  They are sitting on a bench jammin' and the way the lead singer flirts with the camera, interposed with scenes from the movie and fantasy takeoffs from the movie, interacting with words from the song, unifies the movie with unrevealed childhood.  It is a welcome relief from pointless trendy scene-frenzy which is so common.  Unfortunately, the rest of Sixpence's music is not so upbeat.  They should work for movies more often, maybe appear in one.",1072656000,,2101,4.780555555555556

His girlfriend dumps him in the beginning, so you feel, toooootally sad for him.  Like, who is Freddie going to take to the prom?  Anyway his girlfriend dumps him for Matthew Lillard playing, Brock Hudson (which is like a totally real sounding name) and he is, like, such a jerk that you hate from the begining.  Then like, one of Freddie's friends is all like ""Dude, I bet, like you couldn't make any girl you take to the prom into the prom queen!""  and Freddie's like ""Bro, I totally could, do you want make a bet about it?""  and his friend's all ""Dude, totally!""  Then he picks Rachael Leigh Cook, who is totally a nerd, and like uncool and stuff, and Freddie's like ""Nah dude! She's like a dweeb!  I can still do it though.""  This part is really believable because kids in highshcool make bets like this, like all the time.  Then Freddie talks to Rachel and makes her take off her dork clothes, glasses and let her hair down.  Then she transforms, into like pretty and stuff. And she's really hot and, ""All That"", because she wasn't pretty at all before.  Freddie goes to his friend and he's like, ""I am, like, totally going to win this bet bro!"" and his friend's all, ""Dude!""  Anyway, then something TOTALLY originally and unexpected happens!  Freddie, like falls in love with Rachel, even though she's like a dork and stuff, he find out she's like totally nice and funny and stuff.  Then another plot twist happens, when Freddie and Rachel are about to go to the prom and she finds out about what Freddie did!  She's like ""I can't believe you made a bet about me!  That's like, bad!""  and then Freddie's like ""But I like, totally like, love you now."" then Rachel's says, like ""I am not going to this prom with you, because I am like really sad about all of this.""  Now Freddie's like sad too and he's like ""Oh no, what did I do?""  He goes over to Rachel's house, and like, talks to her about how he feels, and then she's all ""Even though you made that bet, like, I know you love me know, and I like tooooootally love you too.""  So that's, like, what happens in the movie and I think that everyone should totally see it because it's cool and believable, and like the acting's real good.  This kind of stuff, like, totally happens in high school.  I think Freddie should, totally, win an Oscar, because he is like sooooo hot in this movie.

It worked with Miss Congeniality. Anyway, enough of me moaning about pretty girls. This is one of those films that I love. Still a teenage film, but not a slasher movie. The two main characters don't totally click - I didn't find it anyway - and Freddie Prinz Jnr just gets on my nerves. He plays the same guy in every single film; Down To You, I Still Know, and probably some other films that I've seen but can't remember. Rachael Leigh Cook plays the part of Laney brilliantly. Even underneath the glasses, you can see she can look beautiful, even though wearing a tarty little red dress, and making her enemy into a clown doesn't really make her better. The reason she doesn't wear makeup etc, is cos her MOM died - just to be american! The best thing about this film is the dance sequence at the prom (if you look closely, the actual main characters can't keep in time with the extras!), and the fact that Freddie Prinz Jnr stops being a high school jerk and becomes almost human towards the end.",1047945600,4,1160,4.301369863013699

A friend of mine, however, suggested it.  One must bear in mind that I am normally not that vulnerable to the power of suggestion, but this was a very hot girl and hot girls generally don't talk to me.  So I call the video store:  ""Hi, do you have 'She's All That?'"" I asked.  ""Uh, yes,"" they replied while dialing 911 on the other line.

1027627,3,6305428255,"To me, this is an exceptionally lightweight and predictable romantic comedy. Still, it has some things going for it. The production values are good, and the photography is, at times, imaginative. It has some of the better new stars, particularly Freddie Prinz, Jr. and Matthew Lillard. While the script shows no new insights into teen life, it also does not belittle its characters, as has been the case in many recent movies. It even has a parent who is a good role model. These elements add up to making it a very likable picture.
The plot is elementary. Zach [Prinz] is the affable President of his Senior class. When he is dumped by his self-centered beauty queen of a girlfriend, he is left without a date for the prom. His pride wounded, he boasts to a couple of friends that he could make any girl a prom queen. They make a bet with him. The girl they choose for him is Laney [Rachael Lee Cook], who, of course, wears glasses, trips a lot and prefers a bohemian lifestyle. This plot is so old, I can't think of when it was invented. Maybe Charlotte Bronte thought it up back in 1850!
Freddie Prinz, Jr. has become a pro at playing the likable high school hero who doubts the validity of his place in the world. It will be interesting to watch his transition into more adult roles in the next few years. My prediction is that he will follow Keanu Reeves into the action/adventure area. Matthew Lillard is one of our funniest young actors. Here is plays Brock, the somewhat older guy who stole Zach's girlfriend. Brock has had his fifteen minutes of fame by appearing on MTV's Real Life. He's so obnoxious that he got kicked off the show. [If you've ever seen Real Like, you know that's an almost impossible feat.] As Laney, Rachael Lee Cook is only so-so. This is not entirely her fault. Eye glasses and kooky clothes are not enough to mask the fact she's a very pretty girl. This makes her transformation from ugly duckling to swan a bit silly.
She's All That does a fairly good job of pointing out that social events like Senior prom are not the life-altering moments that are cracked up to be. It does so gently, however, as if the makers were too timid to make much of a statement. I think today's teenagers are exceptionally bright, or at least a lot smarter than movie makers give them credit for.
I do think that the days of meaningful movies about young love are gone for good. This is due to society's change in attitude regarding the age at which one is considered to be all grown up. That threshold used to be about seventeen or eighteen years old. Today, this seems to have been pushed to the far side of thirty. As a result, love among people still in high school is almost always looked upon something which is fleeting and unimportant, although kids would surely not agree with me. If I am right, then movies about teenage life seem doomed to be confined to a very limiting space. They will only be able to regurgitate the same stories and characters over and over again, at the rate of about fifty pictures a year. So let's be frank. Romeo and Juliet are dead. Long live the varsity hunk and the prom queen!",1016755200,,3129,4.462478184991274
1027628,1,6305428255,"It's such a shame that the same old ideas can be churned out on the back of attractive stars and that people actually buy it.  This well-groomed adaptation of the 'Pygmalion' story has high school jock Zach being dumped by his popular girlfriend.  Without a date for the prom he accepts a bet from a friend to transform geeky art student Laney into the future prom queen.
Of course we wall know the drill - initial loathing turns to love and as soon as Laney takes off her glasses we all realise how incredibly beautiful she is.  As Zach, Freddie Prinze Jr. shows off his vacuous acting ability and grins a lot.  Rachael Leigh Cook fares better as wide-eyed Laney but it's amazing that the brilliant Anna Paquin and Matthew Lillard were sidelined to make way for such leads.
This may be gorgeous to look at but it's neither interesting nor fun seen as the audience already knows what's going to happen, hence why there's no tension when Laney discovers that she was just a bet.  There are also far too many plot holes, which even a casual viewer will easily spot.  For instance, why does Laney state that she cannot wear contacts but for her magical transformation halfway through the movie has got rid of the irksome things.  The only point of recommendation is a very good dance scene indeed towards the end, but that's hardly enough of a reason to watch a movie is it.  At least Anna Paquin and Matthew Lillard are there, plus a brief cameo from 'Buffy' star Sarah Michelle Gellar.  Eagle-eyed viewers may notice that the movie uses the same high school as in the hit TV show.
The bottom line is that this is boring, and that there are not only a hundred other teen movies like it but a hundred other teen movies that are better than it.  If you're looking for a better teen romance then try 'Save The Last Dance' or 'Cruel Intentions', because this movie is just plain terrible.",1016755200,3,1882,4.508823529411765

And Paul Walker plays the macho but scheming school villain
There are also great Cameo performances by the always talented Anna Paquin (Zach's sister) , Kieran Culkin who is a barrel of laughs as Laney's younger brother and Matthew Lillard as a camp lord of the dance who dates Taylor

Just the idea of a (cool, popular) guy making an (uncool, unpopular, nerdy) girl into his (cool) dream date sickens me. All through the movie I silently beg Rachel Leigh Cook's character to show some spine, to act independently, to act like herself. Instead, she is voluntarily molded into a clone. Was this girl so horribly deformed in character before? No. She was simply herself--apparently something these people couldn't live with.

1027716,4,6305428255,"Let's get one thing straight before I make my critique: for those who are expecting an earnest depiction of high school students and high school life, look elsewhere.  ""She's All That"" is as over-the-top as it can get and the movie ironically contains random jokes and parodies about supposedly realistic programs as well, namely the MTV-spawned reality show ""The Real World"" and its progeny series ""Road Rules"".  This movie is all in good fun but it does manage to hint at a good deal of real life trifles that particular people suffer in that highly-influential and barely survivable place that we geeks and outsiders call ""high school"".  Well, maybe not ""high school"" (probably closer to HELL), but anyone who was picked on or unjustifiably ostracized gets the picture.
The endearing Rachael Leigh Cook and Freddie Prinze, Jr. star in this sugary ditty about a dude named Zack Silar (Prinze) who is ditched by his long-time armpiece Taylor Vaughn (O'Keefe) only six weeks before the prom.  He suffers public humiliation in front of his jock companions and, moreover, the entire school.  His less-than-sympathetic pal Dean (Walker) proposes a bet which the illustrious school president can't pass up: Dean will hand-pick the geekiest girl in the school and within the time allotted, Zack must transform her into a mega-babe and make her more than eligible for the elite status of prom queen.  The deal is on and within only two minutes of searching, the ""scary and inaccessible"" Laney Boggs (Cook) makes her appearance by falling flat on her face in the courtyard - Dean has found his guinea pig.  From here, Prinze and Cook do the traditional and recycled theme of geek-to-goddess. Suspension of disbelief is a pre-requisite for this transformation - the pretty and petite Cook is hardly an ugly duckling by any standard, her luminous brown eyes and almost pixie-ish beauty a complete distraction, even when she is supposed to look mousy (tortoiseshell glasses, stringy hair, sloppy clothes, etc.).  Prinze comes off humble and sweet even when he is trying to be suave and arrogant, but this doesn't ruin anything.  We rather want to see him that way because we want to believe that he really does care about Laney and that his reputation is the last thing on his mind.  Prinze does this remarkably well.  Matthew Lillard of ""Scream"" fame is a riot as a fictitious Real World cast member Brock Landers, a character that is obviously modeled from the obnoxious and insensitive Puck from Real World San Francisco.  Of course, he's a lot more likeable because his character is a complete farce and Lillard almost steals the show.  Almost unbearable is Paul Walker as Dean Sampson, the narcissistic jock who places the bet with Zack and manipulates it in his favor.  Walker's delivery is so forced and obtuse that one would believe that is truly HIS nature and not just his character.  Jodi Lyn O'Keefe is a comedic queen as the vacuous Taylor Vaughn, and Kieran Culkin and Eldin Ratliff are again part of the same cast list (The Mighty) but this time as Laney's younger brother Simon and her best friend Jesse, respectively.  If you watch closely during a particular lunchroom scene, you will see Prinze's fianc and ""Buffy"" TV star Sarah Michelle Gellar make a brief cameo.
""She's All That"" borrows a lot of old themes but still remains fresh because of its enthusiastic cast and an above average script.  If teen fluff is your fave, direct yourselves towards cookie-cutter flicks like ""Down To You"", ""Ten Things I Hate About You"",  ""Can't Hardly Wait"" and the all-time classic ""Clueless"".  If you want some BIG laughs, rent ""American Pie"" and watch for its sequel, due out August 10th.  Lastly, if you really want to see Prinze show off his acting gams, rent ""The House of Yes"".",996624000,2,3779,4.884194053208137

1027718,3,6305428255,"Well, here I am, writing a review on a teen movie. Usually, I do not take teen romantic comedies too seriously; the characters are not mature enough to make me actually believe that their romance will end up with a wedding. The mature viewer watches this kind of flicks with one idea in mind: ""Yeah, right... these two guys are just going through a chemical and purely emotional reaction, have no clue whatsoever of the kinds of commitments that a true relationship requires, and finally... their relationship will not survive the four years of college...""
So, why am I writing a review on this one? Basically, one reason: I liked the character of Laney Boggs; she was really sweet and feminine, a characteristic that is kind of latent in today's women.
There is one scene that I would watch over and over in this movie: the scene when she walks down the stairs after her amazing makeover. No only is she gorgeus (that goes without saying), but the whole scene is the epitome of femininity. Look at the grace with which she walks down the steps, look at the expression on her face when she turns towards Zach. Her eyes seem to ask: ""Am I beautiful enough? Will he like me?"" Look at the pure, sweet, and humble expression in those eyes... Man, where are women like this today? Where do they hide?
And what about the background song that accompanies that scene? ""Kiss Me"" by Sixpence None The Richer is perfect for that moment (and for the movie in general) because its carefree melody reminds you of those lighthearted times of high school.
As for the rest of the movie, it is the typical teen flick, enjoyable and a bit unrealistic... but who looks for realism in a movie anyway?",990921600,,1679,4.5813953488372094
1027719,5,6305428255,"This movie has many features of high art. Indeed it is a specimen of such. Robert Iscove, director, knows how to make a great synthesis of feelings and conceptions.  The most difficult problem for an artist in wide sense of a term is to represent not only characters and events, but also ideas, make them visible.  Iscove certainly knows the way. In ""She is all that"" at first we see a story of a boy (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and a girl (Rachael Leigh Cook), watch the development of their characters towards each other.  The story is both realistic and  funny, social and ironical. Then we notice the conceptual background. Iscove plays with the oppositions ""real - illusory"", ""art - life"".  His opinion seems to be that from the one point of view art is the imperfect imitation of life and as such has some illusory, unreal aspects. But from the other point of view life itself can be understood as a form of art. The life of such a kind is represented by the art of performance. Life as performance is a creative life, when we like the fact that we have not answers to all our questions. If we think that everything is clear to us then we live an ideal life, not for real, without feelings (as they, as Robert Iscove seems to  believe, are more real than all-explaining conceptions of our reason and understanding) and love.  All these well-known and, by the way, quite plausible ideas are brilliantly implemented in the body of the movie. We see a lot of examples of ""mimetic"" art - such as excerpts from an idiotic film ""Real world"" (of course it is not real film) and so on. We are presented with many photos and drawings and we see how they interact with real people and sometimes literally pass over to them and vice versa. We also see finest connections between scenes, when, for example, a photo of a trees at the end of a scene changes with the real trees of the same species at the beginning of the next scene. This movie is overwhelmed with the interesting details and at the same time has strong and perfect composition.  As for latter, so not to say too much I just want to mention, that the ""ideal  boy"" Zach Siler (Freddie Prinze Jr.)  turns into real man when he incidentally happens to be in need to make performance in theatre. This is a culmination of the movie.  And this theme pass over to the final scene of the movie. It should be noted that final scenes in Robert Iscove's films - I mean also his outstanding  movie ""Boys and Girls"" (2000) - are simply amazing. He manages to focus in them all the conceptual and plot threads of his films. For instance, in ""Boys and Girls"" ""boy"" (again Fr. Prinze Jr. ) and ""girl"" (Claire Forlani) in a final scene simply fly away from abstractions, which held them as ""seat-belts"" during all the story.  Here, in ""She is all that"" the final scene is an ironical act of performance and real expression of love, as well as the summary of the main characters. I should only add that ""She is all that"" gives us not only much mental food for thinking over - which, as Immanuel Kant had proved already 200 years ago, is the the criterion of masterpiece - but also provides a great performance (indeed it would be strange if it does not). Rachael Leigh Cook and Freddie Prinze Jr. do their best, they act very realistic, creative and fresh, as well as others.

Zack Siler is the most popular guy in the entire senior class. After his hot-shot girlfriend, Taylor, dumps him for a TV star, he makes a bet with his best friend, Dean. Dean bets him that he cannot find a Taylor-replacement by the time their Senior Prom rolls around and be able to turn her into the Prom Queen! Zack, not wanting to be a coward, accepts the challenge and Dean ends up setting Zack up with the biggest geek in school: Laney Boggs! But when Taylor finds out about Zack going out with Laney and gets jealous, she wants to win Zack back (Taylor claims she has to be Prom Queen). And Zack doesn't realize that he's starting to fall in love with Laney! This movie stars a group of today's hottest young actors. Among the supporting cast are Paul Walker, Usher Raymond, Kieren Culkin, Anna Paquin, Matthew Lillard, and many others. Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachel Leigh Cook star as Zack and Laney. And since the high school is - or was, I should say - the same high school on the older episodes of ""Buffy, The Vampire Slayer"", Sarah Michelle Gellar makes a surprising appearance as one of the students in the ""Cafeteria Scene""...(but you have to watch very closely for her, she's only on screen for a few minutes!).

1027853,4,6305428255,"""She's All That"" is an engaging teenage version of ""My Fair Lady"", that succeeds because of strong acting and chemistry between the two leads, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachel Lee Cook.  At least one  reviewer from Michigan seemed to have some sort of feminist agenda  in her negative remarks about this picture.  My advice is that you watch  without your agenda filter on.  If you do that, you'll find this to be one  of the better teenage romantic comedies to come around in a while.  In my  opinion, it's better than ""Ten Things I Hate About You"", a  teenage Taming of the Shrew which I also liked.
Having said that  ""She's All That"" is a good motion picture and worthy of your  time, I must warn you that you'd be better off seeing it on VHS than DVD.  Occasionally movies suffer in sound quality when undergoing the transition  to DVD.  Unfortunately, this is one of the worst examples I've ever heard.

Still, the occasional bit sparkles.  What I enjoyed were the breaks from teen-movie conventions; the hilarious  ""Real World"" riffs, a truly bizarre performance art piece, some  poignant backstory on Cook's character.  And, of course, you couldn't ask  for more photogenic and amiable heroes than Rachael Leigh Cook and Freddie  Prinze Jr.

In the first half of the film--if you can make it that far without tuning out or walking out--the audience gets the feeling that this Kevin Williamson, souped-up, dumbed-down ""Pygmalion"" rip-off was created solely for the purpose of putting Freddie Prinze Jr. (of ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"") in a movie and making a few bucks off his newfound Tiger-Beat fame. The characters are pale stereotypes of the latter half of Generation X, more thoroughly augmented by their thin, and often inane dialogue:
""I feel just like Julia Roberts in 'Pretty Woman.' Except for that whole hooker thing.""
Such an unoriginal take on an old idea is this film, that it often needs to refer to previously successful attempts at this concept (the aforementioned ""Pretty Woman"", etc.) in a possible attempt at its own success.

Most movies have annoying parts that you just don't want to watch after you have seen it a few times, not this movie, every second is great!  Not only that but it has  to make you happy, sure it is a little cheesy, but it ends great. Not to  mention the fact that most of us were NOT the prom queen type, so this  movie is especially great!",945216000,16,394,3.8875

1028319,4,6305428255,"I could write about the fine job Rachael Leigh Cook does in this film, and she does. But I'd rather talk about the camerawork. The opening sequence of this film is the best steady cam work I've seen. The camera flows through  the corridors of the high school as all the major characters strut into  frame to the beat of the soundtrack. It's a real tour de force and I just  felt somebody ought to point it out.
The choreography in the dance  sequence at the Prom is commendable too. Good going.
The DVD is quite  nice, if minimalistic. I enjoyed the music video. Well worth a buy for fans  of the genre.",943315200,3,603,4.292035398230088

1028448,3,6305428255,"I only saw this because Rachel Leigh Cook is a hotty, but I ended up liking it more than I expected.  Freddy Prinz Jr. played a good part, and he was surpringly likable, maybe even too likeable.  If we were supposed to  belive he was the jerk who eventually fell for the dork, it didn't work.  He seemed to like her throughout, and never showed that he had no interest  in her.  But it's kind of nice to see a movie where we like the good-guys  and hate the bad-guys the way we're supposed to.  Matthew Liliard is  hilarious, as always.  I wished he had a bigger part.  But, most of the  movie was predictalbe, cliche, been there, done that...etc.  I wish I could  give it Two and a Half stars, but since I couldn't I decided to be nice and  go for three.  It's not a complete waste of time, if you're not expecting  much that is.",938908800,,830,4.151898734177215

1028453,4,6305428255,"A great teen comedy for whatever needed. We loved Rachel Leigh Cook.  The acctual story begins with a lovely artist name Laney (Cook) starting up school after Spring Break wit ha piece of art work. Then the camera flashes  to Zach (Prinze) who gets dumped by his bossy girlfriend Taylor. After  telling his friend he doesn't need her, they make a bet. Six weeks to turn  any girl of his friend's choice to prom queen. The subject: Laney Bogs.  After trying to get her up to being friends, Zach realizes there's  something more. Great for any occasion, you'll laugh and be  ""awed"" as the story explains how really Laney turns to be the  true one and only because ""She's All That""",937094400,,678,4.545454545454546

I recomend this movie to everyone,  you just will enjoy it every minute.",934588800,,411,4.1

1028628,4,6305428255,"Ok, a lot of these reviews are saying that this film is pretty good but predictable and unoriginal and not worth the time. I still fall into the ""teenage girl"" category, so I'm probably biased. There are lots  of movies out there that are original and innovative, but there are lots  and lots and LOTS of movies that are, at the core, just the same old story  we've heard a thousand times. What makes them original is the way they are  portrayed. There's not a lot original about the story being told in  ""She's All That"", but no one's trying to pretend that there is.  Laney says it herself: ""I feel just like Julia Roberts in 'Pretty  Woman'.""  What I fouund so enjoyable about the movie was the whole  tounge in cheek, almost satirical attitude. That's what made the movie fun  and different. There were different film styles used, and because no one in  their right mind watching the movie would take the story realistically, it  freed the directory up to have fun with it. Case in point: the dance scene  at the prom. That's the director telling you: I know this is not realistic.  I mean, no one brings the soccer team to your house to clean it for you, or  has their sister give you a makeover until you're fit to be seen with them.  Kids don't break into choreographed dance numbers on the spur of the  moment. It's not supposed to be real, it's supposed to entertain, which I  think it does very well, not by being an original story but by being  enjoyable and fun, and original in other ways besides the story. It's  definitely at least a step above the average ""teenage girl""  flick.",933379200,3,1594,4.446366782006921
1028629,3,6305428255,"That's the question to ask oneself. If you want a serious, realistic, artistic attempt at this age-old story... try elsewhere. If, however, you're just looking for a few laughs - you have some time to kill - this is  it.
The plot is predictable. The conflict is trite and contrived. BUT,  let's not get so picky; it is only a movie after all. It has great style  and flair, a believable resolution, ... and, most of all, two romantic  leads (Freddie Prinze, Jr; and Rachel Leigh Cook) who are absolutely,  blazing, heart-melting H-O-T!!! If that's enough for you, buy it.",933033600,,571,4.67
1028755,5,6305428255,"Contrary to some people's reviews, this movie is great!  True that it's not original, but honestly, is there an original movie out there?  I don't think so.  I agree with the review who said it was a cross between several  80s movies--definitely an 80s movie for the 90s!  Pretty in Pink is one of  my favorite movies for the same reason as She's All That is--I love  ""Cinderella""-type stories.  Prinz and Cook portrayed your typical  jock-gets-geek, and it was wonderful!",932774400,,472,4.8
1028756,2,6305428255,"Freddy Prinze Jr. and Matthew Lillard appear together in Wing Commander. That movie sucked, this one is only slightly better. Yes, we've seen this plot many times before. Preppie makes bet with another preppie that they  can make a nerd cool, nerd gets cool, nerd discovers bet, nerd dumps  preppie (who now really likes them), preppie espouses true love and  retreives nerd. An extreme sense of Deja Vu here. Anyway, Lillard does what  he does best, be obnoxious. He controls the camera whenever he appears.  There was a scene so strange...it just totally went outside the movie, and  I really got the idea that it was inserted later. It had absolutely nothing  to do with the film, and an extremely different tone. The most energetic part of the movie is the  great 90's style swing dancing at the ball, very entertaining.  Unfortunately this lasts about 1 1/2 minutes. The movie touches on loss,  and how it makes you hide from society; and living in a parents shadow.  Both going to the central issue of facing life after high school. This  breakfast club heart-to-heart is actually only discussed in passing though.  In short, this movie wants to be a Peggie Sue got Married, and a Can't  Hardly Wait all in one. It fails on both counts. I recammend fast  forwarding to the Matthew Lillard scenes and the dance sequence at the end.",932601600,,1336,4.7229437229437226

The movie has aged poorly. Firstly, due to recent fashion trends, Laney Boggs would be considered better-looking today with the hipster glasses. So that's a non-issue. Secondly, I dare you to find a single high school that remotely resembles the high school depicted here.

I watch it over and over when I need background noise to distract a part of my brain while the other works on the project at hand. It's about a predictable, fairytale movie. It is too bad that life can't happen this way for the most part. People can't let go of the peer pressure and look underneath or inside to discover a person's true worth.
I LOVE the payback scene. AWE-SOME!!! Should have been more, but the true to fact that teens are actually like this has to be tucked away or it takes away from the outcome.
