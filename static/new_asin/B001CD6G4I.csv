8286836,4,B001CD6G4I,"The ""Tagged Classic"" series are old WWE PPV events that they package together & release as a set together for those who didn't catch them back when they originally were released. And to answer the big question surrounding every release of a PPV since July of last year is that Chris Benoit has not been edited out of the events. These are just re-releases of the original PPV DVD events.

SummerSlam 2003:
The Elimination Chamber returns for the second time in WWE history as Triple H once again defends the World Championship against Goldberg, Shawn Michaels, Chris Jericho, Kevin Nash, and Randy Orton in a match that was designed to re-establish Goldberg was the monster he was in WCW destroying everything & everyone in his path. The WWE Championship rematch from WrestleMania took place with Kurt Angle once again defending the WWE Championship against Brock Lesnar except it was a completely different Brock Lesnar who was aligned with Mr. McMahon & had a more aggressive mean streak that we hadn't seen from him in close to a year but still having the greatest in-ring competitiveness that you would expect from these two together. A newly unmasked & completely out of control Kane faced off against his former partner Rob Van Dam in a match that saw Kane be the monster that we hadn't seen from him since he entered into WWE as he was just unstoppable. Other matches saw Shane McMahon vs. Eric Bischoff that saw Bischoff add stipulations as the match went on along with revealing a new ally, United States Champion Eddie Guerrero vs. Chris Benoit vs. Tajiri vs. Rhyno, Undertaker vs. A-Train, and World Tag Team Champions La Resistance vs. Dudley Boyz.

RAW's Unforgiven 2003:
It was ""do or die"" for Goldberg as he got his one on one match against World Champion Triple H in a stipulation where he had to win the championship or his career was over in what was definitely an aggressive battle between both men. Shane McMahon was out for revenge against Kane in a Last Man Standing match that saw both men taking some hard hits that not only damaged themselves but the equipment they used as well with Shane taking one of the biggest ""leaps of faith"" we've ever seen from him. Randy Orton began his quest to become a ""Legend Killer"" against Shawn Michaels in what was definitely the best performance from Orton since his debut a year earlier. Other matches include a Jim Ross & Jerry Lawler vs. Al Snow & Johnathan Coachman for the rights to be the commentators on RAW, Intercontinental Champion Christian vs. Chris Jericho vs. Rob Van Dam, Lita's return to the ring teaming with Trish Stratus vs. Molly Holly & Gail Kim, Test vs. Scott Steiner in a match where Steiner would either regain Stacy Keibler's services or become Test's slave if he lost, and a handicap tables match with World Tag Team Champions La Resistance & their sympathizer Rob Conway vs. Dudley Boyz.

Both were solid events filled with action & entertainment so this is a set I recommend.",1381708800,,2965,4.731141199226306

Tagged Classics- Summerslam 2003/Unforgiven 2003
Tagged Classics are nothing more than the original releases being re-released. No new extras are, nor should they be expected. Summerslam 2003 is a mixed event featuring one of the worst Elimination Chamber matches in history. Unforgiven 2003 is another mixed event featuring the most undeserving dethroning Triple H as World Heavyweight Champion. In my single reviews I gave both of these cards three stars. Together they are still nothing more than a three star package.

Summerslam 2003 is a huge let down. It was not a horrible event, but it could have been much more. The PPV began with a fun USA VS France tag team match. Undertaker actually carried A-Train to an okay match. Shane McMahon and Eric Bishoff were featured in what seemed more like a segment than a match. Shane did give Bishoff a good beating though. There was a Fatal-Four Way for the United States Championship that was probably the second best match on the card.

The best match came in Kurt Angle VS Brock Lesnar. Lesnar just took a turn and joined Vince McMahon and was back to his brutal ways. The match stole the show. Angle had just won the WWE Title again, and Lesnar was going to dish out some punishment to earn it back.

The final two matches on the card were letdowns. Rob Van Dam took on a newly unmasked Kane. The match was more of a squash than a brutal showdown. Van Dam got in little offence, and then took a tombstone on the steel steps. The final match was the second Elimination Chamber match. Many consider it the worst Chamber match of all time. Nothing exciting happened in the match until Goldberg entered the ring. Goldberg would go on to eliminate three people within a matter of seconds before being screwed out of the title.

Summerslam 2003 is a mixed event. Some parts will make you jump with joy; other parts will have you breaking this disk in half. This could have been much better.

Unforgiven was similar to Summerslam in that some of it was good and other parts were not good at all. The night began with a decent handicap Tables match. Considering the Dudleys were involved, you thought it would be better. Test and Steiner continued their feud in an average match. There is a fun women's tag team match, featuring the return of Lita from a broken back. The Intercontinental Championship triple threat good, but the crowd is dead and kills any mood the match set. Jim Ross and The King would face off against Al Snow and The Coach in a horrible match over the rights of Raw commentary.

The best matches were Randy Orton VS Shawn Michaels and Kane VS Shane McMahon in a Last Man Standing match. These matches are probably the only true reason for checking this on out. The Last Man Standing match is a brutal contest with a sick ending. Orton/HBK was a wonderful wrestling classic.

The Main Event was Goldberg dethroning Triple H and capturing the World Heavyweight Championship. The match was your typical Goldberg encounter, meaning it was not long or scientific. Still, the match was not horrible. Goldberg was the wrong man to take down Triple H though considering he would leave a few months later.

Unforgiven 2003 will become a forgotten event for most. If you have some extra cash lying around, you might want this one for the two great matches. If you are looking for a solid event, this is not it.",1220400000,2,4050,4.988148148148148
8286838,4,B001CD6G4I,"WWE's latest ""Tagged Classics"" will include two PPVs that most fans will like.  My take on these particular events might differ from the norm.  You see, I don't like SUMMERSLAM 2003 nearly as much as most Amazon reviewers, whereas I might be more favorable with UNFORGIVEN than most.

The bottom line is that I think this is a good set to buy, if you don't already own either DVD.  But if you're as picky as I am with WWE DVD purchases, maybe you want some more info from a skeptic:

SUMMERSLAM 2003
---I want to be clear about this: this is not a bad PPV.  In my opinion, it's just very average.  The main event is the 2nd Elimination Chamber Match, which I was enjoying for most of it.  But once Goldberg (the final entrant) got involved, the rest of the match was a 5-minute screwjob.  I consider the finish to be one of the worst sucker-punches in PPV history.  There are two other anything-goes-type matches, as well.  The Kane/RVD No Holds Barred Match - while an important footnote for Kane's character history - is just repetitive and unexciting.  Most seem to enjoy the wild & crazy match between Eric Bischoff and Shane McMahon.  To be fair, there's a lot going on as Steve Austin and Jonathan Coachman get involved.  But I still wasn't impressed.  There's a solid U.S. Title fourway match that might do the trick for you.  But the only genuine highlight for me was the excellent WWE Championship Match, pitting Brock Lesnar against Kurt Angle (the man who he lost it to a month prior).  Lesnar and Angle delivered an outstanding contest that surpasses their WRESTLEMANIA showdown, and is comparable to their Iron Man Match.  All in all, I think SUMMERSLAM 2003 is overrated.  But if you check it out, it'll be worth a peek.

UNFORGIVEN 2003
---Considering the abysmal year RAW had in 2003, I wasn't looking forward to this card at all.  But to my delight, it turned out to be entertaining from start to finish.  The opening Tables Match between The Dudleyz and La Resistance is fast-paced (and silly) crowd-pleaser.  Fans who enjoy pure physical wrestling can look forward to Shawn Michaels and Randy Orton putting on the best match on the card.  While HBK & Orton had better encounters in the future, this remains an excellent trip down memory lane.  My biggest surprise was how much I liked the Last Man Standing Match featuring Kane and Shane McMahon.  I'm not the biggest ""Shane-O-Mac"" fan, but this is one of his best displays of exciting action.  There are quite a few ""OUCH"" moments when he and Kane go at it, especially because Shane is kind of an ""everyman"" athlete.  The smooth pace, back-and-forth action, and good camerawork make it a well-constructed piece.  There's also a solid Divas Tag Team Match, which highlights Lita's in-ring return after a year of injury.  It's a nice break from the catfight garbage that WWE allowed the women's division to sink to.  The main event - Goldberg challenging Triple H for the World Heavyweight Title - is a mixed bag.  I kinda got into it, but if you're not a Goldberg fan, you won't be after this DVD.  But even more disappointing was the silent crowd reaction to the remarkable IC Title Match involving Christian, Chris Jericho, and Rob van Dam.  It was such a good display from all three guys, but you wouldn't know judging by the crowd's deafening silence.  Even with these minor gripes, not one match on the UNFORGIVEN 2003 PPV bored me.

OVERALL
---Even though I'm lukewarm to SUMMERSLAM, the Angle/Lesnar is a must-see classic.  And UNFORGIVEN was a lot more fun than it looked on paper.  These ""Tagged Classics"" combos will never offer anything more than the original DVD releases for a good price.  If you don't own any of these PPVs, then this is a good one to buy.",1219276800,,3739,4.641768292682927
