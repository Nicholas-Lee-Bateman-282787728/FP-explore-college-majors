2562051,5,B000FEBWUI,There are no interruptions of the Caillou cartoons -- those annoying puppets that my daughter hated. There are topics in this that include three  vignettes each.,1191456000,2,161,5.1923076923076925
2562052,4,B000FEBWUI,"Why do I need to see that every time I hit ""restart movie"" even though I just sat through it? Makes me NOT want to buy PBS films.

Great kids collection. No puppets!

Also the people in the video never say ""yes"" they say ""ya"". I'm American it's a bit annoying to me to hear my two-year-old yelling YA!",1178582400,,301,4.084745762711864
2562053,5,B000FEBWUI,Got this for my 4 yr. old grandson and he was very happy to get it@ he's a real caillou fan.,1169337600,,92,3.4285714285714284
2562054,5,B000FEBWUI,"Great DVD and it gets 5 stars for not having the puppets in this release (Rexy, Teddy, & Gilbert). My two year old daughter yells Caillou everytime the puppets appear.  I then have to find the remote and press the skip key until Caillou comes back on.

The only negative is that this DVD features a one-minute promo for other PBSKids releases. This in itself is not bad, but this promo plays each time the disc is inserted and it won't let you skip it or fast forward it.",1164758400,14,471,4.280898876404494
2562055,3,B000FEBWUI,"While I cannot fault the story content of this DVD, there are a couple of issues to be aware of. The first is that this DVD features a one-minute promo for other PBSKids releases. This in itself is not bad, but this promo plays each time the disc is inserted and it won't let you skip it or fast forward it.

The other thing to note here is that there is no new special features content. The creators of the ""Caillou"" DVDs seem content to rest entirely on their laurels, and so the ""bonus"" content is the same old character biographies, parents message, simple game, and coloring pages.

The story content is four stories, all from the 2006 season of Caillou. The puppets are indeed gone and there are now three stories in each episode. The four episodes are ""Caillou the Magnificent,"" ""Caillou the Musician,"" ""Caillou the Sports Star"" and ""Caillou the Explorer."" The first one is filled with imagination and magic. The second is naturally very musical, featuring instruments and a marching band. The third one includes a day at the park, fun games with Caillou's Grandma and Caillou trying to ride his bike without his training wheels. In the final one, Caillou meets a new girl at his playschool named Lee Wuhn. He also explores a bayou and imagines living where it's very cold.

One other thing that should be noted --- while the DVD allows individual episode selection, it then tries to rope you into continuous play by going on to the next episode instead of going to the menu.",1160438400,24,1482,4.6273764258555135
2562056,5,B000FEBWUI,"This DVD contains four of the newer Caillou episodes, and each of these episodes has 3 stories in it.

It contains:

--Caillou the Magnificent (learns about Show and tell, Caillou the Magician, King of the Castle)

--Caillou the Musician (Billy's new drums, leads a marching band, sings with Clementine in talent show)

--Caillou the Sports Star (play silly games and win ribbons in Grandma's contests, learns he is getting stronger, ok to still need training wheels)

--Caillou the Explorer (Daddy treats for ice cream, stores about the Antarctic, Calliou imagines playing with the penguins, scuba diving, for treasure and searching out alligators.)

Because this is a newer DVD, the puppet versions of Rexy, Gilbert and Teddy mentioned in the Amazon summary above are NOT in this DVD.  Instead, there are some of the new ""extras"" like Caillou performing songs (the ""I want to be big right now"" song is kind of hilarious).  So far, I haven't seen any scenes with the real kids, i.e. the ""Caillettes"" that usually do song and dance numbers in the older DVDS.  I haven't yet watched the extra features, but the main DVD is 100% Caillou cartoon fun.  Because this is newer, the episodes feature Rosie doing more talking and interacting with Caillou.  And for those concerned about Caillou's behavior, he was not ""whiny"" or ""bratty"" in these episodes but seemed realistically positive.  Some of these episodes show Caillou at his preschool setting, which is nice for kids of a similar age to see.

If your child is fond of Caillou, which mine is, I would definitely recommend this DVD.",1157241600,63,1582,4.9245283018867925
2562057,5,B000FEBWUI,"Our daughter loves Caillou, and we always bring the DVD for a long drive. The DVD does not have the weird PBS stuffed animal friends, and that is good as she really does not like them... If your child likes Caillou you cannot go wrong with this DVD.",1275350400,,249,4.208333333333333
2562058,4,B000FEBWUI,"Bought this for very active two year old boy, and Caillou brings him to a stand still every time!  Product exactly as described!",1267920000,,128,4.565217391304348
2562059,5,B000FEBWUI,My 2 year old son loves Caillou.  This video is an hour worth of nothing but Caillou.  No crazy puppets interferring with the movie.  My son watches this movie several times a week.  Just wish I could fast forward through the 2 minutes of intro trailers.,1266883200,,254,4.456521739130435
2562060,2,B000FEBWUI,"The version I got had a long intro that could not be skipped. DVDs like this intended for kids should just start playing the actual content as soon as the disk is put in the drive. No warnings, no menus, and especially no 2 minute long previews for other stuff that you cannot skip past. Content is fine, same as on PBS.",1265846400,,320,4.17741935483871
2562061,5,B000FEBWUI,"My son really enjoys Caillou and watches this one time & time again.
No puppets.",1246752000,,80,4.4

Thanks,

2562063,4,B000FEBWUI,"Overall, this DVD is great. No puppets, as mentioned in other reviews, but does include 3 stories for each episode plus songs. We don't mind the puppets so much; however, the songs that are included on this DVD are a great substitute. No whining and more interaction with Rosie since they're somewhat newer episodes.

I would have given the DVD 5 stars, except for the really annoying commercial for other PBS Kids DVDs at the start of the DVD that plays EVERY time you put this one in. I wouldn't mind it so much if there was a way to bypass it; however, you can't skip to the main menu in any way, shape or form...you can't even fast forward through the stupid commercial.",1240358400,,674,4.435483870967742
2562064,4,B000FEBWUI,I bought this for my 2 year old granddaugther who can't stop watching it. She asks to watch it everyday.,1221436800,,104,4.25
2562065,5,B000FEBWUI,"My son loves watching Caillou and he loves this DVD.  I have heard that some of the DVD's of Caillou come with some puppets and live action parts - This has none of that unless it is on the extra's - which we haven't watched. This plays 12 great episodes and no puppets.
We are really happy with out purchase.",1201737600,,309,4.15
2562066,1,B000FEBWUI,I don't think Caillou is a good role model for kids he is very disobiedent and bratty. Kids already have don't need extra help with that.,1200441600,,137,4.3076923076923075
8121412,3,B000FEBWUI,"This is a big hit in our house, one of the DVDs our kids ask for and enjoy.  It's cute, has lessons built in and does a good job of reflecting both a toddlers family life and imagination.

My comparatively low score comes from two things. First there really isn't anything here for parents, kids will love it, adults will be bored.

Second and more irritating it opens with several commercials including one for Chucky E Cheese, they can't be skipped or fast forwarded or otherwise circumvented. It's a shame that PBS, which has long been a bastion of commercial free kids entertainment now rams commercials down kids throats and does not give parents any say.",1486166400,,660,4.672413793103448
8121413,5,B000FEBWUI,"Great video...but be careful when ordering the dvd . I ordered the Caillous Can Do Collection and in that collection is this DVD...Caillous World of Wonder and Caillou, the Everyday Hero.  I now have two of the same DVDs that were in the collection.  Be careful when ordering a larger collection as it may have the same individual dvds within the product.  The good thing is that there are no puppets..but there are Chuckie Cheese advertisements in the dvd...those should be eliminated and the dvds should be just the stories and opt out of the advertisements...but all in all a very good dvd.",1460592000,,593,4.737864077669903
