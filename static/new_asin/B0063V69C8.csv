The hero just so and so. But the exotic locales and culture are captured beautifully ,Hema's way of story-telling keeps you interested  and the treatment of the movie is quite youthful. Their is Dharmendra in Salman's hairstyle which seems hilariously odd at first.

Deepti Naval and Farooq Shaikh are here together as a cuple again and they and Rishi Kapoor and Vinod Khanna provide good support to the movie along with Dharmendra. Its about a adopted girl searching for her real Parents. Johnny Lever too is good his movie appearances have dwindled in years. Madhoo too is here in the Rajasthan episode which is filmed beautifully the Camel race is quite exciting and Esha performs well their. Rameshwari too is good. Salman has an item number in the end. Its a nice fresh interesting movie.",1327968000,,966,4.744047619047619
