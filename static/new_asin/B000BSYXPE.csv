8092258,5,B000BSYXPE,"Throughout the centuries, the arts, and more specifically in this case, classical music, has provided composers with a means to channel powerful emotion and expression.  At the same time, its evolution has also provided a vast landscape for which composers are able to continually explore new realms.  Annea Lockwood's ""Ear-Walking Woman"" is a definitive example of both, creating a world for which performer and listener alike are able to venture collectively into parts-unknown.

Composed in 1996, EWW is a work that is ""a set of suggestions to initiative sounds"" and is a history lesson of prepared-piano technique an execution, providing the performer great flexibility in exploring an ""Otherwordly"" tonal landscape by utilizing among other things: detuned strings, super ball mallets, coins and screws (ala John Cage), and cedar balls, among other things.  Since all pianos are different, the experience is new every time.  The performer is, to quote Ms. Lockwood, ""Walking with [their] ears and discovering sonic details. ... The performer completes the sound flow.""

Lois Svard, a great performer and champion of the Avant Garde, provides tremendous insight into Annea Lockwood and EWW, making the abstract very approachable for all audiences; with a DVD that contains: two solid performances (one with video, one audio only) of EWW, demonstrations of the piano preparations, and conversations with Ms. Lockwood.  The two separate performances are very insightful.  While the video performance sheds great light into the technical execution of EWW, the audio performance takes away any ""distractions"" from the music itself, providing a vastly different experience for the listener.  In addition, Svard's conversations with Annea Lockwood shed light into Ms. Lockwood's inspirations for EWW, including discussions about piano preparations, her earlier works including ""The Glass World"", The Piano Transplants of the 1960s, Burning Piano (1968), as well performance of EWW.

Overall this is a fascinating and valuable DVD that provides the viewer with great performances and insight into a truly original work. No one should miss out on the opportunity o experience ""Ear-Walking Woman.""",1140912000,,2191,5.572289156626506
