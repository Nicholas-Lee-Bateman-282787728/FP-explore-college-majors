7883958,5,6305148449,"One can argue over which is the best Jarrett-Peacock--DeJohnette recording, but no one can argue that Tokyo 1996 isn't one of the very best. ""Never Let Me Go"" and ""John's Abbey"" transport the listener (and viewer in the case of the video format) from ballad to bebop heaven respectively.  And the 10 other tracks are of like quality.  This concert as a whole was a masterpiece of both trio interaction and individual creation.",1306108800,,426,4.821917808219178
7883959,5,6305148449,"I saw this listed on AMG and wanted it but couldn't find it here under Keith Jarrett. Eventually I discovered it under Jarrett/Peacock/De Johnette. Hooray! If you know and love the Tokyo '96 CD then you know what to expect as this is that very concert from March 30 plus about 20 mins that didn't fit on the CD.
The full track listing is: It Could Happen Yo You; Never Let Me Go; Billie's Bounce; Summer Night; I'll Remember April; Mona Lisa; Autumn Leaves; Last Night When We Were Young / Caribbean Sky; John's Abbey; My Funny Valentine / Song (all on the CD) plus All The Things You Are; Tonk.
Typically excellent Japanese production to match the trio's typically excellent performance. It's a winner.",977443200,3,703,4.632
