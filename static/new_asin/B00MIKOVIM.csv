6583300,5,B00MIKOVIM,"I followed the news of this film from the time I first heard about it until it came out. And it wildly exceeded my expectations. Franco Nero, John Saxon and Henry Silva are but a few of the folks they tracked down who relate anecdotes and entertaining stories about the undervalued Eurocrime genre. Car chases, beautiful women, cool guys, violence and more violence, the genre had it all and so does this documentary. Clearly it's a labor of love and it's also the best genre film documentary I've seen, and I've seen a few. I've bought three copies, one for myself and two as gifts. If you love genre films, buy it. It's 2 slam bang hours of nonstop entertainment.",1418169600,,665,4.55
6583301,4,B00MIKOVIM,"""Eurocrime!"" is an excellent if low budget documentary about a film genre that is begging to be rediscovered.  This has all the hallmarks of a labor of love.  The information in the documentary is five star; the production value is between two and three stars.  However, the film makers do interview many of the key players (my favorite is Franco Nero, a work horse of the Italian film industry during this period and a fine actor).  But the cost of getting the rights to excerpt so many films means that film clips themselves are infrequent and often low quality or straight from trailers.

But this documentary is more than just a review of a genre; it branches into social and economic factors that served as inspiration and backdrop.  The Mafia (many different varieties) and the Red Brigade are discussed as much as any individual actor or director.  And all the important moments are covered, although many are just touched upon because of the vastness of the overall subject.  In fact, the entire movie viewing habits of Italy becomes one of the focuses, along with the impact of television viewing.  I commend the authors for their reach.

As far as entertainment, there is plenty of that as well.  Sections about insane stunts and dangerous practices are jaw dropping (such as the clip of a rifle blowing out glass in a car perhaps two feet from the main Hollywood actor).  And the remembrances of actors such as Henry Silva and John Saxon are priceless and worth the price of admission alone. As I said in the beginning, this documentary does a better than average - excellent, in fact -  job of covering the subject in the widest possible sense.  It is only inconsistencies of the production - cropped screens, occasional bad audio during an interview - that make me lower this from a five star review.  By the way, make sure to watch the Tomas Milan interview in the special features - one of a kind!

I wish someone would do similar documentaries about Giallo films and Italian horror...",1416096000,9,2000,4.720461095100864
6583302,4,B00MIKOVIM,"Eurocrime is a subgenre of Italian film that usually only serious film fanatics ever dig into. Usually its horror fiends that start to dig into some of the other films horror guys did (notably Umberto Lenzi and Lucio Fulci) and suddenly theyve stumbled onto something almost no one has heard of outside of Italy the Poliziotteschi film. I remember reading the word in an issue of a fanzine (Film Fanaddict) about 10 years ago. They said the next issue would have an definitive writeup on the subgenre, but it never happened. At that time it was damn near impossible to get any of them on dvd unless they starred an American actor. Information is scant, and although you can get more of them on DVD, the lions share still remain obscure. Eurocrime sets out to change that.

Eurocrime is as the title suggests a documentary about the largely Italian film movement of the 70s that was explosion of fist fights, machine guns and car crashes. The film interviews directors, writers, actors, and producers of the films to shed light on the films and culture in which they were made from. The film is cut up into various chapters that cover the acting, the stunts, the directors, the politics, and the rampant crime in Italy at the time as well as many other subjects. The films director, writer, and editor Mike Malloy (who is featured on many Rarovideo Blu/dvd releases as an expert on Italian cinema), gives a very comprehensive picture of the time and place in which the films are made. It helped me to better understand the films and appreciate them even more. Ive dug into eurocrimes in earnest a few times and found some real gems (and some stinkers) but now after watching this I have a renewed interest and will big digging deeper.

The interviews in the film are very candid and fun (especially Antonio Sabato who comes off as a real jerk while sporting a pink super tight shirt and vest combo). I loved hearing about all the crazy stories and cultural differences between the Italian crews and American actors. The film offers a rare peek into a world that was largely ignored by America. Even at 2+ hours, I still wanted more! The dvd features about 30 minutes of extras so it even delivers the more I was wanting. The only thing I really wish the dvd had was a list of films to check out, maybe an essential 25 films worth tracking down. As I said, and the film reinforces, the genre is a minefield of duds. Maybe Mike Malloy can start writing a book about the genre? We can only hope.",1414972800,4,2491,4.558035714285714
6583303,5,B00MIKOVIM,"I had the pleasure of seeing this great and amazingly well done documentary in a special showing at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.  I don't say this lightly, but this is probably the best documentary I have ever seen on a particular genre and ""Eurocrime"" was  and is one hell of a genre.  A lot of love, as well as time and extensive research, went into the making of this movie and you can tell by what you see and hear on the screen.  And to top it off you get to hear from the horse's mouth, so to speak, anecdote after anecdote about the trials and tribulations and fun....oh what fun these actors must have had.....while making these classic films.  Well worth the price of admission and more.  A must have for fans of all genres and especially fans of  all those ""Italian Cop and Gangster Films That Ruled the 70's."" Hats off to writer/director Mike Malloy for archiving this period of movie making history.  What a monumental achievement! PS:  After seeing this doc you want to go out and find copies of every film mentioned so you can see, first hand, how terrific and exciting most of them are.  (Would love for someone to make a comprehensive doc like this one on spaghetti westerns.)",1412208000,15,1197,4.5
6583304,5,B00MIKOVIM,"Although I am in the film I can honestly say it is a modern classic. It is produced and directed so well it stands alone as a work of art. Seeing is believing. It has everything, in depth interviews with the stars of the era, revelatory aspects of a film world little known outside Italy but now made famous by a documentary that is as rip-roaring and wild as many of the films themselves. You will be taken on a roller coaster ride that doesn't let up. After you see this documentary I bet you will suddenly become a member of the Eurocrime cult as am I and so many others.",1410825600,9,574,4.18018018018018
6583305,5,B00MIKOVIM,"This was the time when real thugs had acting parts in movies, and when stars performed their own stunts.

A truly thrilling and well researched documentary that takes you on a wild ride through the history of this thrilling genre. Mike Malloy and his interviewees hit all of the angles of how these film genre was born, how the films were made and is full of extremely colorful anecdotes that will delight fans of the genre and make new devotees out of the non-initiated.

It is also so filled with nuance and details that like great movies, each time you view it again you pick up something new.

It is longer than your average documentary, but not because it lingers or stalls, it is 2 hrs well spent more than once.

I highly recommend it.",1409788800,7,742,4.474074074074074

8672635,3,B00MIKOVIM,"The DVD is new but one of the scene on chapter 3 of the video, it kept freeze up at the same scene and then skipped and continued playing. It could NOT be my dvd player because all my other DVDs don't have similar freeze up problems, ONLY on my certain DVDs like this Euro Crime DVD.
I'm not sure what is wrong with this new dvd. It looked brand new and it is brand new but it has this freeze up on one of the chapters.
And it seems to play without freeze up problem on a computer player.",1471305600,,488,3.89
8672636,5,B00MIKOVIM,"The other reviewers are spot on: this Doc is pure brilliance. Not often anymore that I leave any film related documentary, or book, actually learning something new! This is well paced and fascinating. I couldn't possibly recommend it more!",1462320000,,239,5.153846153846154

8672638,5,B00MIKOVIM,"Volatile, comprehensive, and as full of surprises as the best best films of the genre, themselves. Director Mike Malloy has not just compiled clips and talking heads here, instead he provides a narrative so comprehensive about the evolution of the genre, it succeeds where too many documentaries fail: Eurocrime inspires more interest in discovering the movies themselves. This accompanied by many controversial, often grotesque shock values onscreen. Fantastic montages and superb music from Calibro 35 and Aaron Stielstra only add to the colorful Chad Kaplan animated sequences. Lots of information and vivid interviews with the biggest cast members of poliziotteschi are held together by a riveting voice-over narration. A rock-solid documentary soon to be discovered and released properly for the many fans of the genre--and, hopefully, it will educate the ignorant masses who don't know the poliziotteschi genre ever existed. Bravo, Mike Malloy! NEVER to be missed.",1449964800,,970,5.605442176870748
8672639,5,B00MIKOVIM,"Mike Malloy does a super job in showcasing one of the most unique genres in film, the Euro Crime.  Euro Crime is kind of a spin-off from the famed Spaghetti Western genre especially in that many of the performers are seen frequently in both film styles.
This is a must see for the fan of the wild and crazy 70s European film industry and love to reminisce on their old movie favorites.
The interviews are the real cream of this dessert and just as enjoyable.",1437523200,,458,4.3882352941176475
