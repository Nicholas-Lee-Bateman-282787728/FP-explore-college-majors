5766099,5,B00D04B5NE,"Since I don't' have you.

Dear Janet,

I remember exactly where I was when I heard the tragic news that you had left us.  For decades now, that moment of  sad news has been with me so vividly that it exists as snippet of time frozen in my memory.  As the broadcast came to me that day in AM, I can recall exactly the position of my hands on the steering wheel; I can recall the exact tactile sensation of the thin plastic rim in my grip. I can even visualize that now vintage dashboard and the AM radio tuner position with its red needle on black background and ""FoMoCo"" superimposed on the dial. I stared at it while the DJ told us of the tragedy that had befallen us then young listeners.  And that sadness has remained within me for all these years in wonder as to how this could have happened.  What were the compelling factors that brought about this sad turn of events.  We were out there for you Janet.  You couldn't know but we were there, a legion of young hearts and hopeless romantics,  touched by your voice, thrilled by your soaring soprano.  You reached something within us with your performance that we didn't even understand but, we loved you for it.  Perhaps it was partly your inner pain subliminal in your music that resonated within us.

On CD or on the radio, I still love to listen to your clear passionate voice ; it cuts through the atmosphere like a knife through fog.  Sometimes I think that having heard ""Since I don't have you"" thousands of times, that I could sit back, close my eyes and recreate the sound of your voice in my mind with perfect fidelity.  Whenever I hear this track, I feel as though I have an absolute perfect recording to overlay on your vocals within my memory.  As I listen to you, I can anticipate and match every nuance of your beautiful voice in my recollection.  Alas, that is no substitute for having you with us, dear Janet.

I deeply regret that I never was able to see you perform in person.  PA is very distant to  me  and as a youth, I didn't have the financial resources...and then suddenly, sadly it was too late.  To this day, when I hear the Skyliners, I can't escape a special kind of sadness. You made a decision to leave  us, Janet.  Your pain must have been incredible to induce you to leave your family.  We know you felt you couldn't bear to stay.  We don't blame you.  If only we could have met you, told you how much we appreciated you, would it have been enough?  Would you have stayed with us?  We can never know.

Just know, Janet,  that you are missed with great sadness, since we don't have you.

Love,

Bill

""Since I don't have you"" is a movie shot to resemble a home movie.  You won't see big screen production values here.  Gavin Rapp brings us this work as a product of his love for his mom, Janet, not to be recognized at the Sundance Movie Festival. Gavin tells the story of his dysfunctional family and although we can't help rooting for them, we know it will end badly.  A picky person would say this film needs editing or perhaps slightly more narration to give the viewer a better sense of the timeline.  A little more character development would also be appreciated.  But the purpose here, if I may opine, is not biography but probably catharsis for Gavin and some degree of cloture for the rest of us.  Fans knew there had to be more to Janet Rapp's story than a brief obituary and this film answers some questions.  Sadly, some aspects of Janet's life will seem too familiar as other performers have been down similar paths.  Do we now know everything?  We can't know Janet's thoughts.  And some questions are raised in the telling for instance, Gavin's younger brother is referred to as ""oriental"" by his dad's new wife.  Obviously, but we were never told how this happened, adoption? previous marriage?

Ron Marnich as Jimmy Beaumont does a credible job of capturing Jimmy's mannerisms on stage although he and the other Skyliners have very little to do with the plot. And of course, the Skyliners' music stills sounds as good as ever.  Interestingly, the credits show the Sklyliners all share in the writing credits for their major hits.  That's nice.

If you are a fan of the Skyliners and Janet Vogel Rapp then this movie will be worth your time especially if you always wanted a bit of cloture.

Five stars if  you are an oldies fan.",1421625600,11,4330,4.431472081218274
5766100,1,B00D04B5NE,"I was very disappointed with this movie, I only watched the first few minutes and that was enough.
I was looking for the movie about the Skyliners and the life of Janet Vogel",1421107200,,174,4.303030303030303
5766101,4,B00D04B5NE,We had been trying to find this movie since we heard that it was being made. Loved the story and the history of group. Janet had one of the greatest female voices in that era. It was very sad to lose her. She was such a great talent.,1420761600,5,233,3.875
5766102,5,B00D04B5NE,you previously sent a slasher movie by the same name??? which really screwed me up for this was time sensitive????,1420588800,,114,4.75
5766103,5,B00D04B5NE,"If you grew up in the 1950's & 1960's, you listened and danced to the music of the Skyliner's.  This movie takes you into the life of the only Female singer in the group who eventually committed suicide in 1980.  GREAT ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK from the SKYLINERS.",1418688000,8,258,4.586956521739131
5766104,5,B00D04B5NE,A true story of how the music business impacts the artist and their families. Gavin Rapp tells the story with emotion holding nothing back giving the audience what he went through in his life. I appreciate the independent feel and approach given. Looking forward to seeing more work from Gavin and his team.,1418601600,6,307,4.811320754716981
5766105,1,B00D04B5NE,"Although an interesting story, two issues stand out enough to rate this as only one star: 1. This movie is so amateurish and poorly made that it will never, ever be released on a national level.  2. To find out that the ending totally disregards the facts that you begin to review the movie in hindsight and wonder how many other scenes were shot with utter disregard for the truth.",1418169600,2,382,4.457142857142857

8588063,5,B00D04B5NE,"A unique film depicting a true story.  There are a few spots where the humble budget shows but it is far better than most well-financed films.  Skyliner lead singer Jimmy Beaumont himself called this effort ""dark"" and ""true"".  It gives the viewer an insight into the world of musicians and singers who have had some success but waves of problems not always of their own making.",1519171200,,377,4.681818181818182
8588064,4,B00D04B5NE,"A relatively low budget, independent film made by Janet Vogel's son. It was written, produced and directed by him. It may not be as smoothly made as Hollywood; but it gets its message across very poignantly.
Some of the acting is so-so. But the lead of Janet Vogel, played by Kristin Spatafore is nicely acted. Sure, Kristin lip synchs Janet's voice. But she also moves her neck and throat muscles doing so, which makes her even more believable. The actors playing Gavin through his years are fine as well.
This was a beautiful and very talented woman, singing soprano, for the Skyliners. She almost screamed out her troubled life and no one seems to have heard, except her son as a young boy and Joe Rock who stood by her, but was basically powerless against the Pittsburgh cop she was married to.

I really think there have been too many harsh, negative reviews regarding this movie. Please don't look for any type of Skyliners concert; this is not what its about, though there are a few songs.

This was really a therapeutic labor of love. A biography of his mom's tumultuous life as told by her son. Actually, Gavin decided to make it at the insistence of his wife after the tragic events of long ago keep reappearing. Hopefully, for Gavin, it helped him move on. If taken for the partial biography it is, you'll like it. A large negative comes at the end regarding Kerry Rapp, Janet's controlling sleazy husband. Its not factual at all.",1518912000,,1441,4.625

8588069,2,B00D04B5NE,Wish there would have been more about the group itself.  The acting is weak but the subject was interesting.,1468800000,,108,4.684210526315789

8588071,5,B00D04B5NE,"I received the DVD last night, I""ve always been a Skyliners fan, since I was a kid, I remember back to 1959, when i was in junior high school, and I heard "" Since i Don't Have You"" on the radio for the first time..I was truly moved by that beautiful song........but on to my review the Docu  Drama
If your a Skyliners  fan, this motion picture, truly is a must see!!.and should be in your collection........its starts out early in 1958 with the group forming, and shows some of the early appearances of the small clubs the group played in Pittsburg PA........And then the doc drama focuses on Janet Vogel..which incidentally  is what its focused about, as its her sons telling of what her life was like.as he produced  the movie.....you get to meet her  over bearing domineering husband, who pushed pills and all sorts of other items, and was a policeman to boot!!.......you get to see Janet""s struggles with the drugs and trying to balance a career and raise the children she loved more then life!!........the rest??.you""ll have to purchase the DVD......and hear the beautiful songs of the Skyliners.........and see the rest of the story, its truly worth watching........!!!",1458345600,4,1175,4.825870646766169
8588072,5,B00D04B5NE,"Janet Vogel-Rapp's voice was that of an Angel, too bad her life wasn't a happy one. There have been a few people that have said this was a ""horrible"" movie. I loved it because it was Janet's story through the eyes of her son Gavin. The music is beautiful as was Janet. R.I.P Janet, you are not forgotten",1456876800,4,303,4.241379310344827
