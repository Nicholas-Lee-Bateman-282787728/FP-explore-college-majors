1262462,5,B00003CX9I,"THE CONVERSATION [1974 / 2011] [Collectors Edition] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] Francis Ford Coppolas Masterpiece of Modern-Day Paranoia!

Harry Caul [Gene Hackman] is an expert surveillance man in San Francisco. His routine wiretapping job turns into a nightmare when he hears something disturbing in his recording of a couple; he may have captured something a lot more important than adulterous goings-on. His investigation of the tape and how it might be used sends Harry Caul spiralling into a web of secrecy, murder and paranoia.

THE CONVERSATION is a harrowing psychological thriller that co-stars Cindy Williams, Frederic Forrest and Harrison Ford. It symbolises the uneasy line between technology and privacy  a topic more relevant than ever today.

THE CONVERSATION is regarded as one of Francis Ford Coppolas greatest films. Two-time Academy Award winner Gene Hackman plays a paranoid and personally-secretive surveillance expert who has a crisis of conscience when he suspects that a couple he is spying on will be murdered. This tense thriller makes some remarkably advanced arguments about technology's role in society that still resonate today. In addition to Apocalypse Now, THE CONVERSATION was Francis Ford Coppolas only other film to win the prestigious Palme dOr at Cannes.

FILM FACT No. 2: The character of Harry Caul was inspired by surveillance technology expert Martin Kaiser, who also served as a technical consultant on the film. According to Martin Kaiser, the final  scene of the film, in which Harry Caul is convinced he is being eavesdropped in his apartment, cannot find the listening device, and  consoles himself by playing his saxophone, was inspired by the passive covert listening devices created by Lon Theremin, such as the Great Seal bug. ""He couldn't find out where [the bug] was because it was the instrument itself.""

Andrews Blu-ray Review: In between making his hit films The Godfather Part 1 and Part 2, and Francis Ford Coppola chose to develop an original screenplay he had written several years earlier. This was like his 1969 film The Rain People which was another of his smaller, and much more personal works and very much an example of the kind of film he wanted to continue to do throughout his long directing career. THE CONVERSATION must have seemed like a small, indie-scaled project for Francis Ford Coppola. The small scale is merely in terms of production, however, as the films themes are just as epic and it is a film of the 1970s, not only in its European art-film-influenced minimalism and existentialism, but also in terms of its subject matter. The assassinations of John F. Kennedy, along with Vietnam and the American Dream-souring revelations of Watergate, led to a string of enigmatic conspiracy thriller films such as The Parallax View and All the President's Men, and like those films, THE CONVERSATION is rooted in the new American anxiety of the time, the idea that behind every ideal was a rotten, festering truth.

THE CONVERSATION [1974] was inspired in large part by a discussion Francis Ford Coppola had with fellow director Irvin Kershner about the topic of surveillance and because of a film he had been affected and impressed by. That film was Michelangelo Antonionis 1966 conspiracy thriller Blow Up, in which a young, hip British photographer David Hemmings unknowingly takes a photo of a murder and when he discovers what hes done, becomes obsessed with solving the mystery behind the image. In Francis Ford Coppolas own take on that story, he uses the profession of surveillance as his mode of entry into the world of Harry Caul [Gene Hackman] an expert in the field who has taken a new job spying on and recording a young couple played by Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest for a wealthy businessman he doesnt know much about.

In the film THE CONVERSATION, Harry Caul [Gene Hackman] just wants to do his job. That job is surveillance, and he is perhaps the best in the business. Harry Caul lives, eats, and breathes his work, accepting nothing less than perfection in the pursuit of a clean recording. The content and questionable morality of these recordings is of no consequence to him. He simply considers it beyond his purview. Harry Caul is a loner and a man obsessed with his own privacy. He has no personal relationships and considers everyone a potential threat. He is the man on the other side of the wall, sitting alone, listening to others but never considering making any human contact.

This is the dramatic irony of writer/director Francis Ford Coppola's masterful film, easily one of the finest of the 1970s. Harry Caul, the man who stays safely on the fringe, who never becomes involved, a man who is so safe that he wears a clear plastic raincoat over his trench coat, rain or shine, becomes obsessed with the idea of saving the lives of this young couple, neither of whom he has ever met.

Although the film has a superb cast which includes the late John Cazale, Robert Duval and a very young Harrison Ford, but this is definitely Gene Hackmans film. Gene Hackman made a huge impact as the tough cop Popeye Doyle in William Friedkins superb The French Connection, but the introverted loner Harry Caul was a major departure from the fiery parts for which the actor was known. Gene Hackman is simply superb, creating a complex and fascinating character.

The story of THE CONVERSATION is fairly straight forward. Harry Caul makes a recording of a couple who are involved in an affair and  his job is to deliver this to a high-powered man whom Harry Caul  soon believes will murder one or both of the couple involved. But the joy in watching the film comes from the sheer expertise of the film making. Building slowly and carefully, the director Francis Ford Coppola makes a thriller out of nothing and delivers one of the greatest final scenes in film history. Tormented by his own paranoia, Harry Caul tears apart his apartment looking for a recording device which, as the audience realises, which we can never be actually sure if it is for real. With the floorboards up and the wires hanging off the wall Francis Ford Coppola ends the film with a surveillance shot of its own; Harry Caul sat playing the saxophone and feeling totally rejected and defeated, which is not really his style, he really wants to be the one who wins every time. THE CONVERSATION however, feels we are definitely watching an acting masterclass and is also a true film masterpiece that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the final shot.

Skin tones look totally natural, which helps to give the film a really good supportive image perspective, which helps to make the film THE CONVERSATION look a very thought provoking film with its overall filmic look, especially in the outdoor shots. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.

There were some keen separations in the Surround sound audio mix department, and I did note some depth and crispness with David Shire's composed music film score that haunts the film's many introspective moments throughout the film. This is complimented by Duke Ellington, Harry M. Woods and many more. The Ragtime piano-based theme is worked to perfection and this audio transfer means a lot to the viewing experience and one you will definitely enjoy immensely.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary with Director Francis Ford Coppola: Here the director introduces himself and also informs us that the original screenplay for the film THE CONVERSATION was started way back in the mid-1960s, and sometimes as it is written at the time, feels it is not very good and puts it away in a draw and forgets about it, but over time after producing other projects and films, suddenly finds the hidden screenplay and decided to give the project another go, but sadly had to put it all on hold again, because the director started to do the film The Godfather. But after finishing that film, Francis was eager to start the film THE CONVERSATION, and after securing the finances from Paramount Pictures, got the go ahead to start filming. The idea for THE CONVERSATION came about from seeing the film Blow Up by the Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni, which had the intriguing storyline, that Francis felt could be adapted towards his film, easily now with the Shotgun Directional microphone, where they can now pick up individual private conversations. Francis was also interested in the character of Gene Hackman and how he was very obsessive and private he was and when we see the bottle of wine on the floor when Harry Caul opens his door to his apartment, starts to get paranoid and especially how did people know it was his birthday. Francis also wanted the camera to be looked upon as an eavesdropper and also a very intrusive instrument at the same time. When we see Gene Hackman start to work on the tape recorded conversations, this was that beginning of the pivotal start of the story and how heavily Harry Caul gests obsessed with this project of the couple recorded in Union Square. Francis informs us how the name Harry Caul came about, which originally he wanted to call him Harry Call, and through the extensive tape recordings describing the plot of the film, the young lady assistant that Francis hired to type the screenplay, thought Francis called him Harry Caul and that is why Francis decided to keep the miss-typed name. Francis comments extensively on the character of Harry Caul and his secret liaison with the young mysterious lady played by Teri Garr, who keeps asking Harry questions about his private life, which of course Harry hates people wanting to know everything about his secret private life and Harry also has a strange attitude of relating to other people in his own personal way. Francis gives great praise about Supervising Editor Walter Murch, who he felt produced some stunning editing of the film, but also produced some stunning complicated Soundscapes designs. When Gene Hackman goes into the church confessional booth, the priest listening to him was in fact Gene Hackmans brother Richard Hackman. When we see gene Hackman at the Surveillance and Hacking Convention, this was a real one happening at the same time as filming, especially it was at the same time as the Watergate scandal that happened in 1972. Francis informs us that when we see the people enter where Harry Caul has his surveillance workshop for the party and we see the young lady assistant making out the Harry Caul and how he feels vulnerable and uncomfortable, but slowly drops his shield, but starts to put up his guard again as he hates being too open to people. Francis found Gene Hackman a very interesting actor, especially for this film, as over time he was starting to turn into the character of Harry Caul, especially when wearing a suit and wearing those specific glasses, and does not realise he is turning into a modern day electronic nerdy wizard style of personality. As the film progressed, gene Hackman became uncomfortable and very grumpy at times, but despite this, Gene Hackman really liked his character. When we see the dream sequence with Harry Caul chasing after the young lady in the fog, well we are informed that this was to be the ending of the film, but the neighbours started to complain about the machine making the fog, then suddenly had the press and the police turn up and it was a total nightmare and Francis had to abandon the rest of the shoot and because not enough film had been shot and that is why it was decided to use what was shot as the dream sequence. When we first see the actor Robert Duvall, we are informed that he was a last minute replacement from the original actor who had to pull out, and we are also informed that Robert Duvall goes bac a long way, especially with Gene Hackman, as they both shared an apartment together in New York when they started out in their acting profession. When we see Gene Hackman trying to go up the spiral staircase and preventing to go any further, well again the guy in the blue jacket is again Gene Hackmans brother Richard Hackman. As we come to the end of the film, Francis informs us that the most asked question about this film is who bugged Harry Caul and was it his rival Bernie Moran [Allen Garfield], and of course the burning question, where was the bug hidden, and suddenly Harry Caul realises there is someone out there more sophisticated than Harry Caul, but the other theory is that it could have been the clasp on the saxophone strap around Harry Cauls neck, which again Francis was never able to prove or confirm, as he was never informed and never found out where the bugging device was hidden, and at the point the film is coming to the end and this particular audio commentary by Francis Ford Coppola and was quite an interesting one at that, and helped to explain a lot about the whole storyline of the film and the reason for making the film and well worth listening to.

Audio Commentary with Supervising Editor Walter Murch: Here we are personally introduced Walter Murch and informs us that he was the Editor and Sound Mixer for the film THE CONVERSATION, and remembers when they did the shooting scene in Union Square at the start of the film, Walter was in the Editing Rooms in Folsom Street in San Francisco, and was asked over the telephone how long he wanted the shots to be, which totally confused him, as he felt the director should know this information, not Walter, but after scrambling around for the script, and was able to inform them of the specific information they required. With the scene in Union Square, they used six cameras at the same time, and of course most of it was filmed with long lenses, so that the public was not aware filming was going on with the actors walked around while mingling with the public, to make it look much more natural. But when Walter finally got the film processed and viewed, was totally overwhelmed by how much had been shot, and of course wondered how he was going to get the job done, and sort it all out in some coherent order, that the director will be pleased with the result, but over time Walter was able to find the good moments in the film, and produce something totally special and different, and Francis Ford Coppola was very pleased with what he viewed and informed Walter that he had done a really professional job. When we see Harry Caul enter his apartment, Walter mentions that it was intentionally filmed with a static camera and then of course eventually the camera slowly pans 180 degrees to view Harry on the couch, and we also find out that Harry Cauls apartment block was eventually going to be demolished when filming had finished. The warehouse where harry Caul works were totally empty when filming began and Francis Ford Coppolas American Zoetrope company was based there for quite a few years. Walter informs us that the equipment Harry Caul uses, was deliberately made to look very basic, and the real Harry Caul aka Hal Lipset (1919  1997) was used as a technical advisor and informed the director that the real people in surveillance did this sort of thing for real and was called into to investigate the 18 minute gap in the infamous Richard Nixon tape recordings, and was top of his profession and also the real surveillance people built all their equipment themselves. Walter feels the balance of the film from the outset, was an uneasy combination of the director Alfred Hitchcock and Hermann Karl Hesse who was a German-born poet, novelist, and painter and his best-known works included the novel Steppenwolf, whose elements were inspired for the character of Harry Caul. Walter explains much more about how the name Harry Caul came about, but also expands on the word Caul, as it is very appropriate, as the word means the amniotic membrane enclosing the foetus, and also mentions that Julius Caesar was via caesarean operation and was enveloped by the caul when brought out of the womb, and in ancient Greece to be born with the caul enveloped you, would indicate greatness in a person. Walter also explains when the party at Harry Cauls workshop, you see the plastic transparent sheet, well this is Harry Cauls shield, especially from his rival Bernie Moran [Allen Garfield], and also points out why Harry Caul wear the transparent rain coat, again this is his own personal caul to shield him from the outside world intruding on his own private world. As we get the final part of the film in Harry Cauls apartment looking for the bugging device, which of course Walter asks you to speculate where it was hidden, which as you know Francis Ford Coppola had a theory where it was hidden, which I believe was where the bug was hidden and I just cannot understand why Harry Caul did not also figure out where it was hidden? As the credits appear on the screen, Walter comments that the way the camera was slowly panning around the destroyed apartment, it was acting like surveillance CCT camera works. As we near the end of the film, Walter Murch had stopped talking and I felt what a shame he did not sign off properly and thanking us for joining us on his journey with his personal audio commentary, but despite this, it was really fascinating hearing how this Sound Editor worked on the film and it was really a joy listening to him throughout the audio commentary, as he has a really great commentators voice to listen to, and was a joy hearing how the job was very difficult, but eventually was able to produce something really professional that made watching the film really extra special in producing one of the best Soundscape for the film and if you want to hear something truly special, then hearing Walter Murch was a total joy and should not be missed.

Special Feature: Cindy Williams Screen Test [1972] [480i] [1.33:1] [5:01] This shows the actress reading for the part that actually went to Teri Garr. Cindy Williams eventually played Ann, and is actually shown testing for the role of Amy.

Special Feature: Harrison Ford Screen Test [1972] [480i] [1.33:1] [6:43] Here we get to view the Harrison Ford audition for the part that Frederic Forrest ended up playing instead and makes for an interesting what if clip. Harrison Ford reads for the role of Mark, which of course eventually went to Frederic Forest, but actually ended up getting the role of the Director's assistant. Here we find Harrison Ford testing for the part of Martin Stett on location in Union Square and is with actress Cindy Williams.

Special Feature: No Cigar [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:28] Here we get a very up close and personal interview with director Francis Ford Coppola, talks his directorial debut with his 16mm black-and-white film NO CIGAR [1956] which he filmed himself with a Bolex camera, which the director feels was an early influence on the character of Harry Caul for the film THE CONSERVATION. This short film is about a lonely middle-aged man, who is played by Francis Ford Coppolas Uncle Clarence and we get a few slips from the 1956 black-and-white film.

Special Feature: Interview with Composer David Shire [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [10:59] Francis Ford Coppola interviews the composer David Shire for the film music score. In this brief, but interesting segment, David Shire plays a selection of the score on an upright piano and sheds some insight into his methodology putting the music together for the film. David Shire also reveals that he was able to record the music and have Francis Ford Coppola play it on set to set the mood and define the characters. David Shire also analyses the way the music becomes part of Walter Murch's sound design for the film. David Shire also informs us that he learnt his skills by scoring film music for Western films for Universal Pictures and said at first it was very hard work, but learnt very fast to compose new film music scores. Francis Ford Coppola only wanted a piano score for the film THE CONVERSTAION, as it resonated to the character of Gene Hackman played of a very lonely and private person. At the end of the nice little interview of a nice insight into composer David Shire and as a nice bonus at the end of the interview, we see Francis join David for a jolly duet together at the piano in doing a little sing song.

Special Feature: Harry Cauls San Francisco: Then and Now [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [3:42] Here we get a brief montage tour of the locations in San Francisco, comparing them as they were in 1973 with how they look like in 2011. This is basically a montage that shows a comparison of the locations in the film between 1973 and the present day. The locations we get to view are Union Square; Exterior of Harry Cauls Apartment in 700 Laguna Street; Interior of Harry Cauls Apartment; Harry Cauls Workshop, 1616 16th Street, Polk Street and Sutter Street, One Embarcadero Center; Exterior of Mr. Cs Office; Interior view of Mr. Cs Office in One Embarcadero Center; One Maritime Plaza; Lombard Street and Pierce Street; Alta Plaza Park and Jack Tar Hotel, 1101 Van Ness Avenue (schedule for demolition in late 2011). The final and amusing shot is of that toilet in the Jack Tar hotel, looking just as it did in the film.

Special Feature: Interview with Gene Hackman [1973] [480i] [1.33:1] [4:03] Here we get to view an on-set interview with actor Gene Hackman that was recorded on the 12th February, 1973. With this archival footage from the set of the film, actor Gene Hackman briefly explains his approach to portraying the character of Harry Caul. Gene Hackman also talks about the last scene in the film, where he totally wrecks his apartment in seeking out the listening device, which he found a great deal of fun. Gene Hackman also informs us that he had to learn to play the saxophone, also how to look like he is picking locks and especially working with some very sophisticated listening devices. Despite this being a very short interview, it was still quite interesting.

Special Feature: Archival Audio of Director Francis Ford Coppola Dictating the Original Script [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [49:14] Here we get to view six separate features, which includes: Introduction; Opening Sequence; The Life of Harry Caul; The Convention; Introduction to Frank Lovista; Jack Tar Hotel and Police Station Ending. As usual you can either watch each item separately or Play All. With this audio feature Francis Ford Coppola dictates the screenplay via his personal tape recording of scenes from the film THE CONVERSTAION, while viewing the white typed wording of the pages against a black background and we also get view some clips from the film and still images, especially of scenes that were deleted from the final cut of the film. Personally, about half way through this special feature I got totally bored, and will only be of interested to really dedicated film enthusiasts of this film who want to know every minute detail of the films scenario, and I personally could not see the point of this particular feature.

Special Feature: Close-Up on THE CONVERSATION [1974] [480i] [1.33:1] [8:39] This is an in-depth archival making of feature documentary with director Francis Ford Coppola and actor Gene Hackman. The narrator at the start informs us of what the film is all about, and especially about the professional eve dropper surveillance specialist, played by Gene Hackman. We also get to hear personal views from director Francis Ford Coppola and actor Gene Hackman about the scenario of the film. We see some rare behind-the-scene filming being shot on the set as director Francis Ford Coppola shoots the party sequence at Harry Cauls workshop, the surveillance trade show and the climactic moment when Harry Caul tears his apartment up hunting for the bugging device. You also see director Francis Ford Coppola guiding the actors on how he wanted them to perform in a certain scene, and he also comments on what he eventually wants the film to look for people when they see the film at the cinema.

Theatrical Trailer [1974] [1080p] [1.85:1] [2:49] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film THE CONVERSATION, and it is a totally brilliant presentation that really gives you a flavour of what the film is basically about.

BONUS: Printed Collectible 12-page Booklet entitled THE CONVERSATION ON THE CONVERSATION and includes First Reviews of the film after its release in 1974. It also includes articles entitled ABOUT THE CONVERSATION [1974]. A HAUNTING CONVERSATION [1974]. THE CONVERSATION [1989]. It also includes lot of rare black-and-white and colour photos. You also have a beautiful printed Blu-ray slip cover which is exclusive to STUDICANAL.

Finally, THE CONVERSATION [1974] is another Francis Ford Coppola classic film THE CONVERSATION is without a doubt one of the great films of the 1970s. Strangely enough, it does not feel dated at all. There are plenty of men like Harry Caul who get paid to deliver important secrets, or manufacture them, and the best probably work for different governments around the world. The film looks really excellent on this Blu-ray disc and having read the reviews of the U.S.A and UK Blu-ray releases, I can definitely guarantee and feel the United Kingdom release is far more superior, as you get the exclusive bonus of the Printed Collectible 12-page Booklet entitled THE CONVERSATION ON THE CONVERSATION and includes First Reviews of the film after its release in 1974 and other interesting articles. Highly Recommended!

1262463,5,B00003CX9I,"Really enjoyed this moody, introspective film. For a movie based on sound, it is a relatively quiet film which enhances its subject matter. I love that this movie is so lean-unlike many current films it lets the viewer fill in the blanks. The viewer is given an active role in the interpretation of this film. What really happened? Which parts were real, which parts were imagined? How did Caul's past inform his present? It is a rich character portrait especially considering how meager the offerings. A great meditative film embodying great cinema from the '70s.",1513468800,,564,4.947368421052632

1262467,4,B00003CX9I,"Movie 1 of 1974 and 12 overall in my journey through films of my lifetime.
I actually don't have a lot to say. The film was very good at almost every level including the music. I would say that perhaps some of the dialogue was clever while contrived at the same time. I like the effect of having the main character cherish his privacy while monitoring the private lives of others. This gives the audience a sense of experience of having privacy invaded while also giving the character a past, like he had witnessed so much personal intrusion he began to covet his own. As a moral point I think the concept of privacy is a powerful one although Coppola didn't play with that very much in ""The Conversation."" I have only seen a few of his films but they are all incredible so far and this one fits in with the others I have experienced. I am also a big Hackman fan and he was great as usual.
Pros
-well directed, some very interesting camera shots
-great and appropriate music that sets the mood well but also reflects what you see
-great acting
-great story
-great ending
Cons
-some dialogue was a little contrived
-the pacing was somewhat slow at times keeping this from the masterpiece I otherwise thought it was.",1500768000,3,1214,4.472972972972973
1262468,5,B00003CX9I,"If you are a fan of American films but wondered why European films seem so different. Compare this movie to other movies released in the US in 1974. This is not a European film but this has a genuine feel of a European film.

European movies in the 60's and 70's tended to have very strong, character driven storylines. There's movies with plots centered around events and stories centered around characters. This is about Harry Caul. Caul is a surveillance expert who knows how important it is to keep a private life as private as possible because he knows what can happen when it is not a secret. The first act unpacks all the aspects of Caul's character as he and his associates Stan and Paul wrap up an assignment. The job seems typical to Caul until he begins to wonder about his employer and what he plans to do to the couple who were bugged. The story continues to center around Caul until his world quite literally falls apart around him.

The story never veers away from Hackman's portrayal of Harry Caul. This is not unlike Messer im Kopf,  Belle De Jour, Alphaville, The Tenant, or almost all of Fassbinder's films in that the main character's journey IS the story. This certainly might not sit well with American audiences because American films don't often do this.

I don't know if the way it was shot influences this as well. There's alot of wide angles, alot of grays and, at times, extreme claustrophobia. Again, the setting reflects Caul and his state of mind. The more we learn about Caul's past, the more we can understand his paranoia and obsessions.

This, to me, is the kind of movie a director wants to make when he has the leverage to make it. This isn't light entertainment.

1262504,5,B00003CX9I,"Although made in 1974, The Conversation is an enjoyable suspenseful thriller today. Gene Hackman plays a meek, fearful, neurotic man perfectly. He is a surveillance expert who was hired by a rich man, a director of a business, to listen to and film the conversations and acts of a woman and man, and bring the recordings and pictures to him. The man who hires him refuses to tell him why he wants the material. He is paid $15,000, a huge amount in 1974. He has no idea who the man and woman are.
Although he is the best in the surveillance field, is very fearful of being surveilled himself. He tells no one about himself. He has three locks on his door. He is very religious, a Catholic, and becomes angry if someone says ""Jesus"" as an exclamation. In the past, he did a similar surveillance of people and it resulted in three people being murdered. He is afraid, deadly afraid, of it happening again.
As he listens to the tape that he was able to overhear, he becomes convinced that there is a plan to kill the man and woman he is watching. He is determined to save them.
There is a twist in the plot and a thought-provoking surprise ending.",1492646400,2,1143,4.39622641509434

1262506,4,B00003CX9I,"Released in 1974 and written/directed by Francis Ford Coppola, The Conversation is a potential crime drama starring Gene Hackman as a freelance surveillance technician in San Francisco whose team records a conversation by a man and woman (Cindy Williams & Frederic Forrest) as they walk through crowded Union Square. Using three different recordings of the event he expertly pieces together the conversation and tries to figure out its meaning. He fears that someone might be murdered over it, which haunts him from a past gig. Robert Duvall plays the client, a mogul of some sort, while Harrison Ford plays his dour assistant. Teri Garr has a small role.

While the movie was released after Watergate, the story was written in the mid-60s and the movie was completed several months before the scandal broke out. It was sorta prescient in that it used the very same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the Nixon Administration used to spy on their opponents.

This is a slow drama focused on the psychology of the privacy-obsessed protagonist and the meaning of a phrase on the recording, depending on which word is stressed. Its surprisingly engaging for being so uneventful (until the final act, that is). The way the revelations are depicted at the end show that this movie influenced others 25 years later, like 1999s The Sixth Sense. But that film is more cogent with its revelations whereas The Conversation keeps everything somewhat ambiguous. Unfortunately, I didn't find Hackmans character interesting, like his characters in other films, e.g. 1972s The Poseidon Adventure and 1969s Downhill Racer. Nor did I find his acting convincing when he would stutter. And, as expert of a surveillance technician he is, hes blatantly bumbling in numerous others. I guess hes a metaphor for America, which was a technically rich superpower, but utterly stoo-pid in many ways (e.g. the Vietnam fiasco).

The film runs 113 minutes and was shot in San Francisco.

1262559,1,B00003CX9I,"The Conversation is a 1974 mystery thriller film written, produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola and starring Gene Hackman with various supporting actors, including a young Harrison Ford. The plot revolves around a surveillance expert and the moral dilemma he faces when his recordings reveal a potential murder.

The movie was somewhat interesting to me at first. Dated, yes. But you know this going in and can certainly appreciate the amount of effort required during the time frame depicted to capture the surveillance being displayed. In the end, however, the thing drug on and on to the point I was certain I would suffocate from boredom. I kept thinking, ""something MUST happen soon"" and so I kept watching, even just at out of respect for some of the cast. But, alas, things really did not happen. There are, in fact, a couple of scenes so long and pointless I wondered if it might be more interesting to watch my nails grow.  I won't reveal the ending since others have watched the show and seem to love it and, perhaps you will too and will not want a spoiler. However, I found the ending as depressing as the entire plot and was left yearning for a simpler time when I had never been inflicted with such grotesque idiocy.

Otherwise, he's a completely uninteresting neurotic who plods along, with the movie following his every move.  I've been more interested when reviewing my car's dash cam video.

It was a fascinatingly original drama about an expert in bugging devices who investigates a murder plot and ends as a victim of his own obsession with overhearing others; he becomes convinced that surveillance is being turned on him, and paranoia takes over.  The crux of Francis Ford Coppola's story was a tapped conversation the expert fatally misinterprets, and the movie was unique in making the eavesdropping microphone more important that the voyeuristic camera.  It as a hit with the critics but less so with the public, perhaps because Gene Hackman's superbly acted central role ended in downbeat despair.  The whole thing, indeed, was sombre and disturbing in its implications that anyone able to apply modern technology has anyone else's privacy at his mercy.  Coppola's writing, direction and (with Fred Ross) production were consistently provocative and absorbing, with good performances by Allen Garfield, John Cazale, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest, Cindy Williams, Harrison Ford and Elizabeth MacRea.

1262774,5,B00003CX9I,"189th Five Star 368th overall to review this film. When I first saw the Conversation back in 1999 on VHS I did not like it. I saw it because Siskel & Ebert had recommended the film when doing a review of Enemy of the State. But upon seeing The Conversation again 17 years later, I have a new respect for the film and find it to be a true gem. It led the way for all other techno thrillers and I truly believe that were it not for this film (And Others That Came Afterwards) we would all be in the dark about private and public spying.

Harry Caul is a lonely man, a man that buries himself in his work. Having few friends, Caul mostly does his job and comes home to play a saxophone or date an over inquisitive girlfriend who dumps him for not opening up to her. These are all realistic depictions of men and their relationships with women and their jobs.

The DVD goes into more detail and has an interview commentary by Mr. Coppola. There can be no doubt that this film is a giant. I loved the supporting cast. A young Harrison Ford in a nice supporting role as well as Frederic Forrest and an unbilled Robert Duvall (A Total surprise To Me When I First Saw The Film) round out a superbly cast film that takes us into the heart of the greatest of American cities. What makes this film scary is that even with 1974 technology our private lives could be invaded with impunity. By the time Enemy of the State came out in 1998 (Almost 25 Years Later), the rape of our privacy had already been completed 15 to 20 years previously. And today 18 years later there is no hope of us ever getting that sense of freedom back that we once had. Snowden told it like it was and he was right about how the government invades us. The proof is in The Conversation and Enemy of the State.

I won't go into too much detail of the plot. Suffice it to say that this is a fine film. I give it Five Stars and I'm proud to be the 189th person to give this film a Five Star Rating and I'm the 368th overall to review it. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.

But Coppola, not the most subtle of directors, wants to create a Sisyphian situation in which Harry (a devout Catholic) is eternally punished for the harm he has done to other people by wiretapping, which is a kind of voyeurism. Harry is now the victim, some unseen power knows every move he makes. This can reinterpreted as a kind of Hell of his own making. There is no escape. His destruction of the apartment in search of the unseen microphone (culminating in the Virgin he hesitates to pull apart) can be seen as the furniture of his Hell.

One thinks of Sartre, whose Huis-Clos simply presents three characters in a room they can never escape. No exit.

No, I mean, that's really it. Everything else surrounding the film reveals a moral and emotional breakdown on behalf of the Gene Hackman character (don't forget it's clever here, he's named Harry Caul after all), but his paranoia and self-doubt soon becomes a nuisance for all lovers of 1970's fiction films. Overly praised and under-plotted film is supposedly one of the major cinematic golden eggs that Coppola laid in his early career, but it is a nausea-inducing and spoiled-tasting affair. Sadly, there is so little cinematic scope to any of this; it's dangerously low-budget, claustrophobic, and too pretentious for its own good. Undoubtedly a thought experiment by Coppola that simply does not work, I can understand why certain reviewers are finding the movie intensely difficult to muster (or, let's be honest, even sit through). I do love the 70's movies, but this one is really a defunct project from the beginning and I can find no redeeming value to any of it. It's too bad that so many critics and viewers have been fooled by this one. As interesting as the film's comments about privacy may have been at the time of its initial release, it soon becomes clear that Coppola's film really has no ideas to discuss at all, and its anti-entertainment agenda is too heavy for its own good. I have seen lawn-mowing competitions that are more entertaining than this picture. As an added insult, the DVD features an absolutely worthless making of clunker entitled ""Close Up on The Conversation"", a historian's guffaw moment as it reveals nothing except for the fact that Coppola liked to sit around shaking his feet on a stool while smiling like a lunatic at the camera. The DVD also includes a moderately informative commentary by the director, but if you feel compelled to listen to all of this then you had better check your pulse in the process. Leonard Maltin's movie and video guide raved and raved about this one in its four-star review. Hopefully, no one else will be taken in by this lethargic, under-written pap. Hackman gives one of the most intense non-performances that you will (hopefully not) ever see in the movies (he plays this way too straight for my taste). You're better off finding a copy of Antonioni's ""Blow-Up"", an equally bad (but less litigious) film. This is not homage Mr. Coppola, it's merely crap. I hope I can muster the fortitude to check out Coppola's silly vampire ""drecksterpiece"" entitled ""Twixt,"" but I am not intellectually prepared to take that step now that I've sat through ""The Conversation."" It's a shame that Coppola did not film the project as a comedy instead, which I suspect may have been the film's original ambition (now this is one Mystery Science Theater episode that I'd actually watch).

One can't help but feel Ford Coppola must have had a few weeks to spare in between The Godfather projects and so cranked this one out about a wire-tapping yarn since Watergate was in the news back in the day.  The only reason I bumped it up from one star to two is because Gene Hackman's performance as the loner ""Harry Caul"" who's got his share of quirks and idiosyncrasies is credible  but even Hackman's acting talent can't rise above a weak storyline that comes with its share of static noise -- oddly reminiscent of the  sound effects of The Six Million Dollar Man  -- that alludes to covering up some juicy part of a couple's conversation.  And what is revealed to be the so-called intriguing part of the conversation that triggers the beginning of Harry's struggle with his conscience?

1263143,5,B00003CX9I,"Albert Einstein once said,""It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity."". I think that fully explains Francis Ford Coppola's movie,The Conversation. It was a post-Watergate film that gives insight into how the role of technology have affected human existence.

The movie has a plot that revolves around Sound surveillance expert Harry Caul,who is hired to track a young couple by taping their conversation as they walk through San Francisco's crowded Union Square. Knowing full well how technology can invade privacy, Harry obsessively keeps to himself, separating business from his personal life, even refusing to discuss what he does or where he lives with his girlfriend, Amy. Harry's work starts to trouble him, however, as he comes to believe that the conversation he pieced together reveals a plot by the mysterious client that hired him to murder the couple. After he allows himself to be seduced by a call girl, who then steals the tapes, Harry is all the more convinced that a killing will occur, and he can no longer separate his job from his conscience.

The movie's atmosphere of paranoia and suspicion, combined with its obsessive loner antihero, made it prototypical of the darker films in the future. It also provided a great insight on the role of technology and its disastrous effects when used for the wrong purpose and placed into the wrong hands. Finally,aside from the examination of conscience and guilt of a person who has devout religious convictions.

Director Francis Ford Coppola, cinematographer Bill Butler, and Oscar- nominated sound editor Walter Murch did a wonderful job of conveying the narrative through Harry's aural and visual experience. Also worthy of praise is the performance of Gene Hackman and John Cazale.

Overall,The Conversation is one great film the fits not only the post- Watergate era but also about the role of technology in both an individual and the society in general.",1416960000,2,1959,5.170347003154574

Are you still with me? Great. And by that, I mean this is a great film. This is one of those films that you stumble upon maybe once a year. The kind of film that a director makes as a love affair.

1263181,5,B00003CX9I,"Francis Ford Coppola's 1974 psychological thriller The Conversation is without question a masterpiece. The Italian-American director will always be remembered for the Godfather films and Apocalypse Now, but trust me - this quiet little film about a surveillance operative hired by an establishment figure to record a lunchtime conversation taking place between two people walking around a crowded Union Square in San Francisco with fatal results, is as near perfection as a thriller can get. Looking back from a distance of some 40 years at the plethora of '70s thrillers concerning paranoid conspiracy theories, corruption in high places and the tarnished morality of public life in the States (all rooted in a public backlash against the Vietnam War and the dubious incumbent Nixon administration), The Conversation is for me the richest and the most accomplished of them all.

In the commentary on this fine Studio Canal DVD Coppola disclaims any link between the film and the Watergate investigations that coincided with its release. Apparently the film was in preparation from the mid '60s and is more a response to Michelangelo Antonioni's Blow Up (1966) than anything else. Look closely however and one can't ignore the parallels between Nixon's plumbers and Coppola's buggers even down to the equipment they use. Most obvious of all is the sequence where the bugger is in a hotel room listening to the violence happening next door juxtaposed with a TV news broadcast talking about Nixon. The film also makes oblique reference to the 1969 Chappaquiddick car crash incident that is the source of so much conspiracy theorizing centered on Teddy Kennedy's consequent withdrawal from political life to Nixon's immediate advantage. Publically Coppola may want to hide behind art but the topicality of The Conversation (as with the director's other 1974 release The Godfather Part II) is one of the key factors which make it such a rich and fascinating experience. Indeed living in a world where our cell phones are constantly tapped by the media and our private internet accounts are being hacked into by anyone, the film is as relevant today as it was back then.

Three films dominated the Academy Awards in 1974 and it's amazing that they all took corruption in high places as their central theme. In addition to Coppola's work the third was Roman Polanski's seminal neo-noir masterpiece Chinatown. I watched (and reviewed) it immediately before I saw The Conversation and similarities between the two are deeply revealing about Hollywood's reflection of the state of the nation at that time. Both are Paramount films (as was The Godfather Part II of course) made during Robert Evans' directorship of the studio. Both feature detectives of a sort - Jack Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private eye in one while Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) is the surveillance operative in the other. Both are hired to track down and watch people involved in suspected love affairs. Both detectives achieve their assignments but misread the evidence they find. Both find themselves uncovering corruption in high places and both are destroyed in the process. Chinatown is a fine period piece set in the '30s while The Conversation is a present day drama, but both are baleful visions of the same morally bankrupt sick world which Americans in the early '70s were only just beginning to realize greeted them every morning they woke up. The dawning realization was that a thick wall of corruption and organized crime lies embedded so deeply within the power structure informing everyday life that any attempt to understand and remedy it is doomed to failure. Soon the Watergate hearings would harden realization into fact - America had lost its innocence forever and Paramount were perhaps the first to document it on the big screen.

Of course Chinatown and The Conversation are otherwise very different films. Polanski's piece is a genre riff on the established Raymond Chandler / Philip Marlowe tradition of gumshoe pulp fiction and despite the hiring of a Polish director, the frame of reference is entirely American. The interesting thing about The Conversation is that its subject may be American, but it takes its cue mainly from European art house cinema with its slow pace, its non-entity of an anti-hero as its main character, its systematic depiction of alienation in the big city and the descent of a man into stasis and inner paralysis. Martin Scorsese would later do a similar thing with Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver (1976), but Coppola here takes his visual cues from the aforementioned Antonioni classic Blow Up and I'd say the claustrophobic dense 'trapping' mise-en-scne of Fritz Lang as evidenced in films like M (1931) and Scarlet Street (1945).

Coppola's main theme in The Conversation is man's inability to keep his life private. The invasion of privacy is portrayed in the film as a permanent evil from which nobody can escape. No matter what we do or where we go someone somewhere will always be watching and recording our every move. This theme permeates virtually every single shot of the film. The first sequence says it all. An eye in the sky looks down on Union Square. Haskell Wexler's camera (Wexler was replaced by Bill Butler in the course of the shoot and several shots were re-done, but Wexler's opening sequence was kept because of its complexity) slowly zooms in and we gradually pick out figures milling around in a crowd. There's no music at this point - just the sound of street performers and muffled conversations of passers-by. Gradually the camera comes to rest on one couple in particular (Frederic Forrest and Cindy Williams) who seem to be dogged by other figures who keep re-appearing. The second shot shows a figure atop a building pointing what looks like a gun into the square. Are we about to witness an assassination? Eventually we focus on the figure of Harry Caul wearing his dirty plastic mac which he will wear throughout the film as a kind of uniform. Because he's played by the familiar face of Gene Hackman who audiences would all have known as 'Popeye', our attention naturally goes to him. He eventually gets in a van parked on the periphery of the square. Only at this point when Harry starts talking to his associate Stan (John Cazale) do we know what's going on. Harry and his team are in the process of recording a couple's conversation. And yet we know from the very first zoom in on the square that there is someone else watching Harry watching the couple. In this first sequence Coppola says completely what his film is going to be about - people watching people watching people into infinity.

Harry is the best there is in the surveillance business - 'the king of the buggers' as he is later called by one character. But his prowess comes at a price. He is only good at what he does because he is a fanatically private person. He lives behind a triple-locked door in a bare apartment with no possessions to treasure except his saxophone. He keeps a girl in a separate apartment, but won't tell her a thing about his private life. He has no interests, no personality, in effect no life. His life is his work and that is it. And yet as good as he is at his job he is a man under siege, a paranoid scared of everyone and everything. He returns from work, opens his top security door and deactivates his burglar alarm to find someone has entered to deliver a bottle of wine for his birthday. King of the buggers he may be, but anyone (even his landlady) can invade his private sanctum at will. As Harry makes his way around the city Coppola frames him very carefully in a series of squares and rectangles which for me refers back to Fritz Lang and the way he sets up the characters of Hans Beckert (in M) and Criss Cross (in Scarlet Street). Harry is forever depicted trapped in window frames, doorways, staircases, elevators, threatening corridors, railway lines and most significantly the side of the hotel when he steps out on to a balcony to be suffocated by the grid of the side of the skyscraper. The mise-en-scne of the film deliberately traps Harry in the cold hard gleaming surfaces of a modern city to exteriorize his feelings of inner entrapment. Note especially the warehouse where Harry works. We hear the tape of the conversation again and again as Harry sits in a cage in the middle of a huge empty space. This pinpoints exactly Harry's mental paranoia while also referencing very obviously another cage - the one Criss Cross works in at his bank in Scarlet Street. The visual texture of this film is suffocating, claustrophobic and deeply revealing of Harry's inner moral malaise.

Harry's deep feelings of disquiet are explained by the fact that he is a devout Catholic who once did a job which he later found out resulted in murder. He thinks history may be repeating itself with his current assignment and his nagging feelings of Catholic guilt coming from an inner struggle with his own soul is the meat on which Coppola's narrative feeds for the rest of the film. Thinking he has understood the conversation he has recorded he hesitates to deliver the tapes to The Director (an uncredited Robert Duvall) and duels with his secretary Martin Stett (a very young Harrison Ford) to no great success. The tapes are stolen and despite receiving payment in full Harry's inner crisis leads his employers to put him under surveillance. After an extraordinary Hitchcockian denouement in a hotel, Harry goes to pieces in his apartment. Someone has planted a bug, but he just can't find it. He demolishes the place - the destruction being a most emphatic exteriorization of Harry's complete mental breakdown. We know he passes breaking point when he breaks up a statue of the Virgin Mary believing the bug to be in it. Not even religion can save this sad sorry sack of a man - a victim of the very technology which he is supposed to be master of.

Bleak and devastating, Coppola never loses grip on his taught, tense and absorbing material - especially those mesmerising sequences where Harry pieces his recording together to corellate with the famous sequence in Blow Up where the photographer (David Hemmings) puts a story together by laying giant photos side by side to realize 'reality' is totally subjective and what we see (and hear) is simply our individual perception of what is there, not necessarily the reality of what is there. Both the bugger and the photographer are doppelgangers for the director putting his film together to make sense of a reality which always remains tantalizingly beyond comprehension. Doppelgangers and playing with subjective/objective views of perception again reference the world of Fritz Lang as well as Antonioni.

Hackman puts in a sensational performance of deep interior terror that matches Coppola's vision. The actor is on record as saying this is the performance which he is most proud of. Amen to that. Watching him gradually disintegrate framed within Coppola's sophisticated mise-en-scne and played out to an extraordinarily effective piano score by David Shire is one of the greatest things cinema has to offer us. Slow, icy cold, psychologically right on the money and a perfect meshing of brilliant visuals, rigorous script and superb directorial vision from Coppola - the film comes highly recommended especially in this Studio Canal release which boasts fine visuals (aspect ratio 16:9 - 1.85:1) and excellent sound. This special edition boasts 5 hours of extra material as well as 2 commentaries. As well as Coppola's there is one by sound engineer Walter Murch who had a greater input on this film than usual due to the director being busy on The Godfather Part II. The Conversation should be in every collection and buying this issue is a no-brainer.",1411516800,5,11764,4.905072827724761

1263183,5,B00003CX9I,"Amidst these tumultuous times for surveillance, technology, and the recent NSA revelations, The Conversation has never been more impactful. Gene Hackman plays a top-notch private investigator for private clients -- both corporate and governmental. The character seems to be in it for the money -- doesn't matter who it is, as long as they're paying!

This film builds a tension that's reminiscent of Hitchcock, but with a special, Coppola flavor. Amazingly, this entire film was made in between The Godfather and The Godfather II.

It helps to understand that the context for this film was about two years after the Watergate Scandal. Nixons cronies had attempted to bug DNCs headquarters, and in the aftermath of two investigative reporters, the work fell apart. But the stain of surveillance and spying was left.

The Conversation, unlike any film I've ever seen, seems to understand and manipulate the power of surveillance on the human psyche. From the deep loneliness of those conducting investigations, jealous lovers spying, and limitless drive for privacy, this movie taps all the major parts of an overgrown surveillance industry. Coppola plays with the viewers mind, as the surveilled are continually flipped, again and again. I loved every minute -- highly recommend it!",1407628800,3,1281,5.300492610837439

This is one of Francis Ford Coppolas 70s masterpieces that established him as one of our most important directors.  It is a thriller for people with an attention span, something all too rare in todays smash-cut style of cinema.  Coppola establishes a quiet atmosphere of dread and slowly mounting tension as well as the compelling character study of a man who makes his living by invading the privacy of others but is so terrified of being seen that he has nearly isolated himself from the rest of the human race.  He allows a woman he loves (Terri Garr) to slip away because he cannot bring himself to share even the most superficial details of his life with her.  This film has turned out to be remarkably prescient regarding the intrusion of surveillance technology on our private lives, and it is interesting to see the state of the art in the 70s.  Hackman is always remarkable, but he turns in one of his best performances here.  The brilliant final sequence provides a perfect metaphor for insanity.",1394323200,3,1183,4.855721393034826

1263213,5,B00003CX9I,"Few films are as unnerving as Francis Ford Coppolas The Conversation.  Watching it, that slow burn, pretty much unfolds like a wave of tension and completely overtakes the viewer.  Watching Brian De Palmas Blow Out its easy to see why he was so inspired by Coppolas 1974 film, and those influences helped create yet another outstanding film.

But who are we kidding; for this is where its at.

The Conversation tells the story of Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who has his entire life uprooted thanks to a conversation he wasn't supposed to pay attention to.  Harry is the best at what he does, and because of that he is sought after and often obtained by people in need of a real professional.  His latest job proves to be more than he can emotional handle, for it derails his private life and causes him to crawl deeper and deeper into a world of secret panic.  Alarmed by what he hears, Harry becomes concerned for the wellbeing of the couple on the tape, fearing that their lives are in danger.

What makes The Conversation so tense is the brilliant performance from Gene Hackman.  Hackman, who happens to be one of the greatest actors of any generation, delivers his finest performance put to film here, completely crawling inside this mans life and dissecting it from the inside out, imploding almost, as he unravels in rapid succession.  Harrys life is so compartmentalized, everything in place and in order and completely owned by Caul and yet this situation, this knowledge, takes over and undoes all that he has worked so hard to control.  Watching it destroy him is remarkable.  Hackman works hand in hand with Coppola, who proved in 1974 that he was a master director.  This film is vastly different than his Oscar winning The Godfather Part II and yet it is nearly equally as strong and it shows such richness and depth of talent.  His ability to create such nuanced tension is enviable.

With a supporting cast that only elevates the tale, and a lingering impact that only grows stronger as the memory remains, The Conversation is an unforgettable movie experience.",1389225600,3,2082,4.7604456824512535

It is a lean, tense character study, or maybe a psychological thriller.  It has no gunplay or exciting action sequences.  Now that you know what it is not, you'll be able to enjoy it.

1263217,3,B00003CX9I,"""Being one of the few people who has seen three Francis Ford Coppola films (i.e. Bram Stoker's Dracula and Jack) but never seen The Godfather trilogy, The Conversation is by far his strongest and one of the most thematically challenging, compelling, cold/distant, and mentally intense films made in recent memory.

There are obvious and discreet cues as to why I would make this claim. Harry Caul, played by Gene Hackman in a challenging, unsettling, and mysterious role, is our eavesdropper in the film and he is depicted very much as a quiet, forlorn, and eerily distraught man full of coldness and fear. Nonetheless, he is a complex figure only rendered even more complex when he starts hearing a person's conversation on tapes multiple times believing that there might be a murder. To some who will watch this, a lot of things go on but it all seems minimal and rather simplistic on face value. Not entirely as the film, like it or not, is a case study in psychological warfare and paranoia than a conventional, spelled-out thriller or political drama like some of the trailers or connections to other films this film may associate with.

It was not a very enjoyable film because much of the narrative relies on his mood and temperament amid the chaos he is trying to analyse in his head and ears through intense, almost voyeuristic surveillance. There is no sense of cliche in this film at all reminding you that the film you wanted to like is not what you expected. The film is better off seen as a film studies case in character analysis, sound design, and cinematography (which, beyond all judgment, is stellar for its time). More importantly, the film serves as a shocking historical document which preceded break-in national news about the Watergate scandal and Richard M. Nixon's pack of cronies.

To much respect, the Watergate felt like there was more action involved than there was actual psychoanalysis but inevitably much of the minds behind the cover-ups would ultimately rest their fate and find glory (especially in the surveillance convention scenes) and horror (especially toward the tricky end which will not be disclosed) in this film. Premonitions about controversial events do not come often and this is a very strong but slightly oblique example (much like The China Syndrome or Three Mile Island and the 1970s drama, The Man, or Obama's election win in 2008).

The film is a cinematic, novel-like puzzle and a historical premonition and, even amid much of its difficult dramatic and unconventional presence, still garners some credit for that too.""",1380153600,,2575,4.953703703703703

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally getting 'round to this one -- having seen both ""Godfathers"" umpteen times enough during college -- I was somewhat startled, then impressed, by both the confidence with which Coppola opens the film with a long, steady, crane tracking shot, topped off with the hubris-accusation-risking credit: ""WRITTEN BY: Francis Ford Coppola.""  I mean, yeah, right, take notice, I guess?

Sure enough ... the screenplay, quite apart from the ""mise en scene,"" seemed so carefully thought-out, researched, and compiled from various sorts of case studies and character types the separate credit seemed not only warranted, but necessary: this thing didn't come out of nowhere!

Meanwhile, the joys in this film include: Harrison Ford as a semi-cynical, semi-youthfully-overconfident CIA agent like you've never seen him before; astuteness to the paranoia of the era the way few aside from Pynchon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gravity-s-Rainbow/dp/1930679726/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gravity's Rainbow</a>) and Philip K.

(You can easily see how this ""nation of Falstaffs"" -- each with their own ""vocation"" which was ""no sin to labor in"" -- made an almost-untraceable mess of things!)

Don't delay, if you've waited to get around to this one.  (What are you doing this week-end, anyway?)  It's good to be properly humbled by multi-layered ""genius"" on display; taking this film simply at ""face value"" isn't possible.  It's reportage, it's visionary, it's just this side of science fiction (and'd make a GREAT double-feature with then-Coppola-buddy George Lucas's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THX-1138-Two-Disc-Director-s-Cut-Special-Edition/dp/B0002CHIKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THX 1138 (Two-Disc Director's Cut  Special Edition)</a>), and it's the Hollywood we'd all like to believe in: Hackman and Cavale and Ford and ...

1263628,5,B00003CX9I,"I disagree with my fellow film buffs who would rank this as a film that echoes the warnings of George Orwell's novel ""1984."" Of course, this is a movie about listening, and yes, the government is portrayed as an omnipresent ghoul with easy access to your most intimate thoughts. Dare to conjure a thought that threatens the government and you just might disappear. Yes. The film suggests all of this. But that, in my humble opinion, is not what the film is about. Instead, I suggest that the Orwellian aspects are merely the skeleton on which is hung a more personal tale about the difference between hearing and listening, and a man who's deaf to the difference.

Can there be any doubt this is the case when one of the first images we see is that of a mime -- the antithesis of Harry Caul, who is the film's protagonist. The mere notion of Harry deciphering the movements of a mime is laughable because to do so would require an understanding of subtext and insight into the human condition. Harry has neither. Harry can observe, but he doesn't see. Upon seeing a mime rub his eyes and shrug his shoulders we can reasonably assume that Harry would report that the mime rubbed his eyes and shrugged his shoulders. That this is a mime's way of saying he's sad would be completely lost on Harry.

As Harry Caul tells us very early in the film: ""I don't care what they're talking about. All I want is a nice, fat recording.""

As we come to find, however, Harry can't sustain this kind of life.

He says he doesn't care what's said, and yet he walks the walk of an expert listener. A champion bugger. The top of the heap when it comes to surveillance. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Harry may be the best at hearing. He can ""hear"" any conversation, wherever and whenever it takes place. But listen? No. Harry's a terrible listener.

And that's the central conflict of ""The Conversation."" Harry the Hearer vs Harry the Listener.

For example: From the moment we meet Harry's unhappy mistress, he's seemingly oblivious to the cause of her unhappiness no matter how plainly she explains it to him. He expects her to be at his beck and caul ... pun intended. He expects her to be satisfied with a life built around the insufficient moments she spends in his company. She's not.

Another example: Harry Caul pretends he doesn't care about friendships. That his concern is all business. He severs ties to a long-time associate, then gets upset when he learns that associate is working for the competition. But he's not hurt in an emotional way. Not betrayed as a friend. Supposedly all he cares about is that none of his secrets are stolen.

Perhaps the most telling event about Harry occurs early in the film, when he learns his landlady has been snooping in his mail, and that she's been in his apartment without his permission. Harry acts as though this is an abomination. He says the most important thing in the world is that he have the only key to his apartment. But, really, why? There's nothing in the apartment that Harry shows the least bit attachment to, so he can't be worried about being burgled. No one comes to visit him there. He doesn't even bring his mistress there. Instead, he pays the rent on her apartment so that he can see her at her place. Harry acts as if this lonely life of his is so very valuable, and yet we are shown nothing of value in his possession -- no items, no relationships, not so much as a pet.

Harry's so worried about being bugged that he never seems to realize that he never says anything anyone would want to hear. He's the loneliest, most boring man on the planet.

Indeed, the one time he's aware he's been bugged as a prank, he's simply embarrassed that it caught him in a rare expression of emotion.

""The Conversation"" is brilliant storytelling, the subtle story of a man who's life of detachment and denial is about to come crashing down. It's about human interaction, and the danger that results when a life lacks those kind of critical connections. It's about how much people need each other to get through life. It's about the difference between hearing and listening.

How many different ways can you say ""He'd kill us if he had the chance?"" This is the lovely little riddle of this movie and it's played to perfection. He'd kill US if he had the chance. HE'D kill us if he had the chance. Where's the emphasis? What's the subtext? Is the mime happy? Is the mime sad? Harry just might be driven mad as he struggles to figure it out.",1372204800,,4469,4.517326732673268

1263635,4,B00003CX9I,"Gene Hackman has long been an actor I admire. In this 1974 film written and directed by Francis Fird Coppola, he rises to the level of greatness.

Harry, played by Gene Hackman works in the surveillance industry, and is said to be the best at his kind of job. However, on one job a woman and little girl were killed after one of his jobs, and he tried to distance himself by saying he was in no way responsible. Harry is a clever man, very quiet and a loner. in fact his girlfriend, Teri Garr, before a nose job, did not know where he lived or what he did for work.  He has a new job and is afraid that several people will be killed. This is all he can think of, it follows him, and in the end, we wonder if it will destroy him.

Lots of actors you will recognize, a very young Harrison Ford, Cindy Williams and several others. This is A film with a lot of tension, black and white. It tells the tale of how relying upon technology may be a fool's errand. Nightmares and a guilty conscience follow Harry. Will he survive?

But, beneath the surface I sensed that he was 5 cans short of a six pack and was running on borrowed time before having a complete breakdown.  He was extremely religious so he had moral qualms about his voyeuristic profession and suffered from guilt that seemed to have accumulated over the years.  Was the film a paranoia film of the 70's?

First, what it's not:
This is not an action film. It's also not the typical Gene Hackman role. Nor is it an ""Enemy of the State"" prequel, although there are some extremely loose common threads and similarities regarding Hackman's characters. Their respective professions, and personal and professional histories (as portrayed), while similar, are not the same.

Well deserving of its Academy nominations (competing with Godfather II, another Copolla film), The Conversation is a psychological thriller that witnesses eminent surveillance expert Caul's (Hackman's) mental disintegration and ultimate breakdown - triggered by the surveillance he's conducted and a conversation he records (and ultimately deciphers). It forces him to come to grips with a significant event in his past that he's been running from, and wrestle with the moral and ethical issues of invasive surveillance - and how much personal responsibility those conducting it have for their actions and their consequences.

I love Apocalypse Now and the Godfather films. But there is one by Coppola that is always unrecognized. Some may not have even heard of The Conversation, which was released in the same year as The Godfather II. I can see why some may not enjoy it, but personally, when I saw it the first time, I was hooked. I think this movie has become one of my all-time favorites. This movie is really good. It makes me wonder why I never saw it until now. The pacing is slow, but tension builds up when the plot progresses. There's a whole lot of suspense and drama, especially in the second half. This is how you make a suspenseful film, let me tell ya. The cast (Hackman, Cazale, etc.) is unforgettable (though Teri Garr's character can be seen as useless to some). The piano music from David Shire is very catchy, one of the most riveting I've heard.

If you're looking for frantic action and wild drama, The Conversation is not for you. This is a thought-provoking film that moves in a slow and delicate pace. I know this is going to be one of my favorites.

1263835,3,B00003CX9I,"This film was written, directed and produced by Francis Ford Coppola. Some of the films of his that I have seen (e.g. Patton, for which Coppola wrote the screenplay; The Godfather, directed by Coppola) have been quite intense and slightly off-beat, and this film follows that trend. The story is about a surveillance specialist, Harry Caul (Gene Hackman), who is employed by government agencies to eavesdrop on other peoples' lives. In this instance, all of his attention is focussed on a young couple, apparently meeting in secret in a crowded square. They are being watched by three of Harry's employees. The film is about Harry piecing together their conversation and its consequences. The Agency Director for whom Harry is working is played (briefly!) by Robert Duvall. There is a bigger role for the Director's assistant Martin Stett (played by Harrison Ford) who runs interference for Duvall. One of the characters who stands out is a rather obnoxious competitor of Harry's, Bernie Moran (Allen Garfield) who tries to wheedle out secrets from Harry. The moral of the story is that Harry really doesn't care what people do with the information he supplies, but in the end he develops something of a conscience. I found this a rather difficult film to follow despite the fact that there isn't really a great deal of action because much of what does happen is shown in five-second clips.",1346976000,,1390,4.969957081545064

1263838,5,B00003CX9I,"Who is reading this review right now? The Conversation is a 1970s gem directed by Francis Ford Coppola.  It is a great, intriguing, and thoughtful film.  It came out in 1974 and was naturally overshadowed by The Godfather II.
It was actually ahead of its time and remains a pertinent character study.  The film has the classic look and feel of prime time Coppola. The attention to detail and general pace is genius.  In the Conversation instead of Pacino or De Niro you get 100% Hackman. If you ever doubted him you should check this film out.  In The Conversation Gene Hackman plays Harry Caul. Caul is an ace private detective in the city of San Francisco. There is nothing glamorous or fantastic about his job. He is simply one of the best in the business. Harry Caul is a man of precision, intuitiveness, solitude, and paranoia. He is also a bit of a rock star but he would never admit to that. He is hired to tape a conversation between two random people in San Francisco's Union Square. This unique conversation  haunts and draws him in with obsession. He has done this a thousand times but this time something is just not right. You never really know what the conversation is about or what it fully entails. The outcome will ultimately surprise and intrigue. This film explores the concept of technology and its ever growing invasiveness in people's lives. This was an issue at the dawn of technology and it remains an important issue today. This is definitely a great movie that runs on the direction of Francis Ford Coppola and the acting merit of Gene Hackman.  The cool supporting cast includes John Cazale, Allen Garfield, Cindy Williams, Frederic Forrest, Harrison Ford and Robert Duvall.

1263889,5,B00003CX9I,"In 1972 director Francis Ford Coppola made one of the greatest movies ever done THE GODFATHER. Using the clout he developed from that film he made another classic that didn't get near the intention. That movie has just arrived in blu-ray format. Its name is THE CONVERSATION.

Gene Hackman stars as Harry Caul, a surveillance expert with a reputation for being able to record anyone, anywhere. The film opens with Harry and his crew recording a conversation between a young couple in an open air park. Using various pieces of equipment from parabolic microphones to microphones hidden in bags they put together each to come up with a conclusive piece of work.

But the movie isn't all about this conversation. It's more about Harry himself. As portrayed by Hackman, Harry Caul is a loner, a man without much in his life with the exception of his work. He does have a girlfriend (Teri Garr) that he provides for and sees on occasion. But there is this underlying nagging fear we witness in Caul that has him keeping people at arms length including the people who work for him. Harry Caul is a classic paranoid individual but one who knows how easy it is to gain access to the details in a person's private life. Knowing this means Harry realizes how vulnerable we all truly are and how susceptible each person is to being watched.

As the pieces come together on the project Harry is working on he begins to wonder about what he's recording. Filters are used to fine tune each piece, to bring together a comprehensive conversation where no words are distorted or left out. In the past Harry has made a practice of not becoming involved, in not listening to the things he was recording. But as he puts this one together, he begins to worry that perhaps this couple is about to be killed by his employer.

When he goes to give the tape to his employer he is first pushed aside by his aide played by a young Harrison Ford. Eventually he meets with the man portrayed by Robert Duval. Paid for his services Harry leaves but still feels concern about what will happen.

Going to a trade show of security and surveillance experts, one of Harry's employees is there working on the side with another expert. Bernie Moran (Allan Garfield) is perhaps second only to Caul. But rather than downplay his expertise, he's capitalized on it becoming a major player and manufacturer of electronic surveillance equipment.

Eventually Harry is talked into allowing Moran and friends up to the loft he uses where they work. Moran continues to push Harry trying to find out how he did a particular job back east that resulted in the deaths of several people. But the reclusive Harry holds back, acting rather shy with the group. When it's revealed that Moran placed a microphone on Harry in an ink pen, Harry explodes and orders everyone out.

Still concerned with the conversation he recorded Harry checks into the hotel where the couple said they would meet. Taking the room next door, he overhears an argument and then witnesses through a frosted pane of glass someone being murdered. Plagued with these images it tears at him.

When he tries to confront the man who hired him, Harry is turned away. To give away what happens during the final portion of the film would be akin to telling you who the mother was in PSYCHO.

The film is a dive into the mind of a man who peers into the private lives of other and who attempts to not have a private life of his own for fear someone will do the same to him. This lone individual with a conscious is doing unconscionable things, but continues to do so to make a living. It is brilliantly made and perhaps one of Coppola's best films but overlooked by many.

Hackman gives an outstanding performance. His role could have been played over the top with rages and flamboyance but instead Harry Caul has more depth in the slow moving actions and scenes that have him doing nothing more than listening than many actors offer when chewing scenery all around them. His role here should have landed him an Oscar.

While the movie was overlooked in many ways for years fans have had the chance to find it as it has been released in formats from VHS to DVD. Now that it's available on blu-ray it is one that should be added to the collection of any die hard movie fan. And if you're a fan of Coppola or Hackman you should be out there picking up a copy as soon as you finish reading this piece.",1332806400,3,4408,4.553030303030303

This movie is amazing in its ability to be both boring and annoying. I actually took the dvd out after watching and threw it directly into the trash. That coming from someone who keeps every dvd/vhs ever purchased in the last two decades. Gene Hackmans talent is wasted in this movie. You'll get frustrated hearing the same tape recording of a conversation being played and replayed over and over - with NO explanantion to the viewer as to what is significant about the conversation. Even when you are allowed to find out some things in the end - you realize that the whole movie was pointless.

If you choose to suffer thru watching it....afterwards, ask yourself...Why in the world would two people, trying to hide their conversation, not just run into the nearest restaurant, lock themselves in the bathroom, have their quick conversation and then run back out. Walking in circles, whispering, speaking in ""code"", standing near a band playing, mixing in with the crowd....all pointless and utterly ridiculous.",1331424000,,1095,4.972677595628415
1263892,5,B00003CX9I,"One of a quartet of outstanding films that Francis Ford Coppola made during his peak as a director, ""The Conversation"" presents a much smaller story than the sprawling canvas of ""The Godfather"" or ""The Godfather Part II"".

Gene Hackman plays surveillance expert Harry Caul a devout Catholic who is so paranoid he refuses to have his own telephone. Caul finds himself in the middle of a conspiracy after spying on a young couple (Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest). When he turns over the tapes (to a young Harrison Ford)he wonders what he's wandered into as it appears he may have put the couple in danger and someone may be following Harry himself.

A low key paranoid thriller like ""The Parallax View"", ""The Conversation"" features a marvelous, subtle performance by Gene Hackman (this is one of Hackman's favorite films and favorite performances)and strong work from the supporting cast (including Terri Garr and the late John Cazale).

The transfer is quite nice with a surprising sharp transfer for a vintage film. Colors are subdued but that's the way the film has always looked. Keep in mind that the film is grainy and has always looked that way (it's not atypical for a film from the era).

The audio sounds quite nice giving prominence to David Shire's moody score where appropriate. Dialogue is crystal clear throughout. we get both the mono and a nice 5.1 remix.

The special features are quite nice for this set and surprisingly robust given that this isn't one of Coppola's best known films.

We get everything ported over from the 2000 DVD including Coppola's commentary track as well as sound editor Walter Murch's commentary track. We also get the original vintage featurette on the film. The original theatrical trailer is also included as well.

New to the Blu-ray are screen tests for both Cindy Williams and Harrison Ford. We also get a two minute excerpt from Coppola's film ""No Cigar"" which may have provided the inspiration for the this film.

""Harry Caul's San Francisco Then and Now"" compares the locations from 1973 to 2011. ""David Shire Interviewed by Francis Ford Coppola"" features composer (and Coppola's brother-in-law)discussing his score for the film. We also get a vintage interview with Hackman. We also get 50 minutes of audio dictation on the script for the film set to stills and film clips, etc.

A combination of suspense thriller and character study ""The Conversation"" remains one of Coppola's best films. The film ""Enemy of State"" acts almost as an unoffical sequel to this film (it actually includes clips from ""The Conversation"")in many respects (although a far less interesting film IMHO)so you may want to watch that as well.

Extremely annoying and loud at the end. The story itself is dull and the directing is also kind of obvious with sudden cuts to things meant to shock. It's dated in that respect.

1263895,4,B00003CX9I,"This is a very fine, original work by a wonderful director.
It's a story about the issue of privacy invasion which was ironically filmed just as the Watergate break-in was front page news.  More than that, it's the story of one man, Harry Caul, a master ""bugger,"" a terribly damaged soul, who is practially isolated  from real life and who now lives mostly for his work. He tries, in his stiff and stilted way, to have a personal life;he has a girlfriend of sorts, a sweet but pathetic young woman whom he supports in a shabby room.  He tries to join in the post-convention party, has a few drinks, dances with a callgirl but even that sad attempt at human contact ends up in disaster.

The story is brilliantly told, giving us, the audience, just enough information to keep our attention riveted to the screen.  We discover, bit by bit, just as Harry does, what is really going on with the young couple who is walking around Union Square.  Harry's credo is that he never gets personally involved in his survelliance work; he just does what he's ordered to do and collects the money.  His assistant, Stan, is a much more human guy and gets interested in the content of the conversation.  ""It's just normal"", he says.  But Harry isn't normal and we see how this particular job breaks open his defenses to the point where he takes direct action out of personal motives.

There's so much that's good in this film but there are enough other reviews here that go into detail so I won't. Gene Hackman is wonderful in what must have been a terribly difficult role. The whole cast is very good. I particularly liked the very small but crucial parts played by Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest.  We see the film of them over and over so we get a very good opportunity to look at their facial expressions.  Forrest especially plays his part superbly.  Harrison Ford has another small but very interesting role and he makes the most of it.  Teri Garr is always good, as is John Cazale.

I was reminded of a very similar film, made decades later, in Germany, ""The Story of Others"" which won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film.  In this film, the main character is another single, isolated, middle-aged man, whose profession is to spy on possible traitors to the East German government, during the Cold War.  This man is even more far-gone than the Hackman character; his apartment is infinitely more sterile, and his social life is absolutely nothing.  But, like his American counterpart, one of his assignments has him snooping into the lives of a pair of lovers.  The love expressed in this couple, both of whom are artists and live a colorful, vibrant life, totally unlike that of the spy, makes something click inside his mind which leads to a similar, even more crucial, moral dilemma.

I actually liked ""The Lives of Others"" much better than ""The Conversation"" becuase it went much farther and had more heart. I hope that Coppola saw it and I have to wonder what he thought.  I think it's because The Conversation"" doesn't live up to ""The Lives of Others"" that I reluctantly give it only four stars.  I liked it very much but I can't say that I loved it.  For me, the ending didn' work well.  Coppola said that it wasn't the ending he originally wrote but that difficulties in filming made his first ending impossible.  I think the difference in the endings of the two films accounts for why I liked this one but loved the other.",1328400000,,3421,4.577996715927751

1263986,5,B00003CX9I,"I wasn't alive in 1974, but I can't imagine how strange and alluring ""The Conversation"" must've felt to those who witnessed it when it was first released.  Was the surveillance technology advanced for its time?  Was the culture paranoid of being watched?  Did audiences fully understand the film's undertones at the time?  Did people expect our culture would become even more monitored in the future?

I don't really know the answers to those questions, and in a way, I prefer not to when I think about ""The Conversation"".  To Harry Caul, those questions are irrelevant when the story begins.  He truly dedicates his surveillance to making a clear and well-produced record, and tries not to listen to the content.  He sees his work as a way to record ""sound"", without any attention to its meaning.  Only when Caul begins to ponder the consequences of his actions does his life begin to unravel.

Fans of ""The Conversation"" love to wonder how technology has impacted our culture.  Other fans are simply engrossed in the characters and plot developments.  What's great about this movie is that you ignore one of those angles and still be mesmerized.  If your attention is solely on Harry Caul and how his latest job has affected his life, then ""The Conversation"" is a terrific thriller.  And if your attention wanders towards how our lives have been changed forever by technology, specifically surveillance, then ""The Conversation"" will give you plenty to think about.  You can be as isolated as Caul is when the story begins, and you can be as involved as Caul is when the story ends.

The premise sounds simple when you talk about plot.  In short, Harry Caul (played with great restraint and insecurity by Gene Hackman) is an expert on spying on people for different clients.  His latest job requires some tweaking because his targets' conversation is cluttered with all sorts of sounds from the San Francisco streets.  As he tunes his recording, he begins to suspect something terrible is about to happen.

Like all great stories, ""The Conversation"" is effective because of the telling.  Seeing a technician tune an audio recording sounds boring, but it works because since Harry Caul seems to lack interest in a social life, we want to see what he IS passionate about: His work.  Or how about those annoying scenes in movies when a bunch of characters are being unpleasant drunks?  In ""The Conversation"", there's a lengthy sequence where Harry has allowed some fellow surveillance experts into his workplace.  Rather than be a bunch of idiots behave foolishly, there's a hotshot East Coast expert named Bernie (Allen Garfield) whose made a name for himself, but is borderline-obsessed with how Harry pulled off a couple of tricky jobs.  His cockiness is equalled only by his jealousy, which results in some very cruel tricks as the evening goes on.

The supporting cast is top-notch, because we remember the faces we need to, and forget the faces that Coppola wants us to forget.  The targets of Harry's latest job are shown just enough so that we remember their faces and voices, but don't know too much about their personalities...just like Harry does.  On the other hand, Harrison Ford delivers an unforgettably creepy turn as the assistant to Harry's client.  There's a scene where Harry is obviously being followed, and when Harry finally confronts the assistant, Ford slyly replies:

""I haven't been 'FOLLOWING' you.  I've been 'LOOKING' for you.""  It's clear that it's the former.

It's not often that the sound effects of a movie make headlines, however Walter Murch's work on the sound is more crucial to the piece than most movies (Ben Burtt's work on ""WALL-E"" comes to mind).  I have yet to watch the DVD extras with Walter Murch, but the way the conversation between Harry's targets (hence the title) fades in and out is superb.  During the opening credits, the camera slowly zooms in on a town square, filled with distant music and chatter.  But then a soft electronic distortion fades in and out.  As the camera approaches closer to the ground, the garbled noise is even more noticable.  When we get closer to the conversation and the targets, their sentences are periodically interrupted with low clarity.  Sometimes what we miss is inconcequential chit-chat; other times, we miss crucial pieces to the puzzle that will change Harry's life forever.

If there's any weakness in this movie, it's one early scene where Harry visits a woman in the middle of the night.  It's a sad scene where Harry confuses his ladyfriend's questions for an interrogation.  She simply wants to know more about his life, and he's still shaken that someone managed to leave a present in his apartment when he thought he had the only key.  The reason this scene doesn't quite work for me is because it never made sense to me how someone as lonely as Harry Caul managed to meet this woman in the first place, let alone how they managed to have a physical relationship.  If this scene had been removed, the later courtship between Harry and one of the alluring partygoers still would've worked.  However, that's a minor quibble that quickly resolves itself early in the movie, letting the story quickly regain its momentum.

And once ""The Conversation"" picks up momentum, it maintains its grip through the end of the picture, from the details of Harry's investigation to the troubling aftermath of a shocking, violent turn-of-events.  To be sure, ""The Conversation"" has one of the most unforgettable endings (and camera shots) in motion picture history.

""The Conversation"" is my favorite film from the 1970s.  There is so much more I want to share with you, the sign of any great film, I think.  ""The Conversation"" is not only filled with complexities and subtleties, you can enjoy the film as simply or as deeply as you want to.  Francis Ford Coppola and Gene Hackman have stated in separate interviews that ""The Conversation"" is probably the favorite of their respective film careers.  I couldn't agree more.",1283212800,24,6003,4.898909811694748

1264029,5,B00003CX9I,"THE CONVERSATION may be a 36 year old film, but it remains one of the finest suspense thrillers of this genre.  Francis Ford Coppola  wrote and directed this gem between making Godfather and Godfather II and his degree of subtlety and mastery of understatement and jolting events shows.  This film is restored now on a new release and the result is a crisp, flawlessly produced souvenir of just what Coppola does best  - along with his current TETRO.

Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) is a very private person with memories of an incident in his past that permanently scar his ability to trust anyone or anything. He is a private surveillance expert, living in San Francisco, and with his partner Stan (John Cazale) is in the process of taping both audio and visual evidence of an affair of a young couple for a fee of $15,000. for tapes and photos. In studying his tapes he discovers a planned murder and his tension mounts as he realizes he could be considered a participant in a killing not unlike what happened in his past.  He becomes paranoid when he attempts to turn over the achieved evidence to the man who hired him and in turn finds he is to give the tapes and photos to an 'assistant', one Martin Stett (Harrison Ford in a very early bit part).  Fear consumes him: he distances himself from his girlfriend (Teri Garr) and loses his partner Stan when his obsession with personal privacy drives Stan away.  Gaul, well respected in his field, meets his New York counterpart and becomes part of a surveillance scheme himself!  How Gaul copes with his situation is the resolution of the film.

The pace of the film is slow, not unlike the patience required by those who invade the privacy of others.  Coppola allows us to understand the psyches of  each of his characters, no matter how small their roles.  Hackman and Cazale are superb as they keep the flow of the film tense like a drawn out tightrope.  It is a film to see repeatedly and one that has many of the qualities Coppola polishes in TETRO.

1264032,5,B00003CX9I,"Regardless of my title--a quote from the film meant to be ironic in this context--The Conversation was a brilliant, intelligent film. On paper it doesn't sound like the sort of drama that lends itself to cinematic treatment: A man eavesdrops and records conversations for a living. He is tops in his field and takes great pride in his professionalism. Sometimes his work results in great harm to people, even death, so he tries to detach himself from what he is doing. He is conflicted. Knowing also about how easy it is to tap phones, bug rooms, and eavesdrop on people, he is understandably a little paranoid. He guards his personal privacy zealously. Is it still paranoia, though, when they actually are listening--are out to get you? With a protagonist who keeps so much hidden, it hardly seems like a formula for a compelling film, but in the hands of Director Francis Ford Coppola, with Gene Hackman giving one of his greatest performances, a compelling film is exactly what you get.

---------------
Martin Stett: We know that you know, Mr. Caul. For your own sake, don't get involved any further.
===================

Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) is a professional Surveillance Expert. In an early scene Caul is talking to his landlady on the phone, disturbed that she has entered his apartment and left him a birthday gift. He wants to have the only copies of his keys. He seems to be over reacting, but subsequent events will make you wonder if he wasn't correct in his suspicions. While Hackman's character may be over reacting, Hackman is certainly not over acting. He holds back and trades in subtle nuance. Slowly, piece-by-piece, the puzzle is put together. There is a murder plot, but that is merely subtext. The real drama is what is happening to Harry Caul, and his futile attempts to stay detached from the consequences of his job.

For this role, Hackman learned to play tenor saxophone, and it was an excellent choice for his character. He acts on the saxophone, playing it exactly like his character would. He plays along with old jazz recordings, fitting in with the song being played, but in an abstract, almost obtuse manner. His audiophile equipment and intense listening to the tapes he plays along with, and the way he concentrates on his own tone, speak volumes about his character and his chosen profession.

Along with the vintage jazz recordings on the soundtrack there is also some great music composed for the film by David Shire. In fact, Shire scored the music before the film was shot, and Copolla played it on the set to set the mood. Shire wrote a great piano theme of jazz-influenced 20th Century Classical Music. It is haunting and captures the existential angst quite well. Bravo, David Shire.

---------------------
Martin Stett: [Final Line] We'll be listening to you.
==========================

Allen Garfield's William P. 'Bernie' Moran is Harry Caul's rival, but while Caul is introverted, Bernie is anything but. He is a crass, brash practitioner of surveillance with little or no regard for the consequences. The scenes at the Surveillance Convention and the party later at Caul's studio are brilliant. Garfield stands out in a field of fine performances by Teri Garr, Cindy Williams (Shirley on Laverne & Shirley), Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, and the rest (as they say on Gilligan's Isle).

Robert Shields plays a mime in Union Square. In real life he actually did get his start working the crowd at Union Square. This is a crucial scene, as the crucial conversation is recorded here, with the subjects thinking that all the commotion and extraneous noise would make recording them impossible. A mime, impersonating people without making a sound, is somehow bitterly ironic. Here and throughout, Coppola uses the San Francisco location well, as only a true San Franciscan could. Not the picture postcard scenes a tourist would send, but places like Embarcadero Center, with its poured concrete effect, or the Jack Tarr Hotel. Some very ugly architecture that nevertheless made me feel homesick for The City by The Bay. Have you seen my heart anywhere? I think I left it there.

The bottom line is that The Conversation, directed by Francis Ford Copolla, is not only entertaining, but also intelligent and thought provoking. It says so much about our modern condition, and its message has only grown more relevant as time goes on. The Conversation was like a brilliant, scintillating conversation with a beautiful woman in Cafe Trieste over espresso after the San Francisco Opera.

I watched the entire movie only to see if it got any better.  It didn't.  The person I watched it with fell asleep.  I was bored almost the entire movie.  If you base the movie solely on the way Gene Hackman played his character it was great.  Gene Hackman did a great job portraying a very paranoid man.

On the other hand, I didn't much like Cindy Williams or Frederic Forrest in it, but I suppose their characters are unlikable. Plus, what you hear them saying is the real focus anyway.

When I first heard of ""The Conversation,"" I thought, 'How do you make a movie with such a boring title?' I was kind of intrigued by that. It doesn't exactly have the punch of ""Enemy of the State,"" does it?

I also saw the rating by TCM was four stars. I wondered, 'If it's so good, how come I've never heard of it before?' I saw the high rating here on Amazon.com, too, so I decided to give it a look. The professional and amateur critics both can't be wrong, can they?

The beginning I liked. It is set up well, and you see flashes of brilliance by Francis Ford Coppola. There's crisp dialogue, artsy cinematography, and a simple, strong idea. A surveillance expert picks up on his listening device the plot for a murder. He even gets the date and place.

It goes downhill after that, unfortunately. The middle slows down to a snail's pace starting after everybody returns from the snooping technology show. And the end is a disaster.

A comparison between ""The Conversation"" and ""Enemy of The State"" exposes the failure of this highly overrated seventies crime flick and will help those who saw Gene Hackman's nineties movie figure out if they want to see his earlier work.

EOTS has a lot of dialogue. TC has very little dialogue.

EOTS is packed with action. TC has very little action.

EOTS moves very quickly. TC moves ridiculously slowly.

EOTS strongly develops characters. TC doesn't. Even the main character in TC isn't developed!

EOTS has an antagonistic working relationship between two main characters--Gene Hackman and Will Smith--like many modern movies. TC has no such thing.

EOTS has cool spy tech. TC doesn't.

EOTS never lets you get bored. TC does--often.

EOTS has an exciting finish that is satisfying. TC doesn't.",1250899200,4,2008,4.765895953757226
1264094,5,B00003CX9I,"The Conversation (Francis Ford Coppola, 1974)

Where Francis Ford Coppola's career as a director began to go hideously wrong is subject to a great deal of debate. Some folks say he held out until The Godfather Part III. Some blame the S. E. Hinton adaptations of the early eighties. Most settle on One from the Heart, while a few intrepid souls go as far back as Apocalypse Now and attempt to make a case that it's really not as great a movie as the rest of us know it is. In fact, one of the very few movies that has never been mentioned as the beginning of the end is The Conversation, the movie Coppola made in between the first two parts of the Godfather saga. It was mostly eclipsed by those movies in the seventies, but a small cadre of critics and Godfather fanatics kept talking about it until the rest of the world rediscovered it twenty or so years ago. It has since become a recognized classic, perched soundly in IMDB's Top 250 and TSPDT's Top 1000.

The Conversation is the story of a particularly stressful period in the life of Harry Caul (Gene Hackman), a surveillance expert whose world is coming down around his ears. His longtime partner (John Cazale) has defected to his biggest competitor, his personal life is a shambles, and he thinks he heard something while on another job about setting someone up for murder. No one else is taking it seriously, so it's up to Harry to try and stop the murder himself. Harry, however, for all his skills in surveillance, is one of filmdom's most endearingly bad detectives.

You think Hackman and Cazale are enough of a draw here (and they should be; Cazale's every film is an amazing piece of work)? Try adding in Teri Garr, Harrison Ford, Allen Garfield, Cindy Williams, Elizabeth McRae, and the greatest star who never was, Frederic Forrest? Even better is the script. While Coppola is well-known as a director and producer these days, back in the sixties and seventies he wrote some of the world's great screenplays (including this and the Godfather adaptations, he was responsible for the 1974 Great Gatsby adaptation as well as two other perennially-in-top-movies-lists flicks, Is Paris Burning? and Patton). Why Coppola stopped writing screenplays I don't know, and this one is evidence that he probably should have kept going. Subtle, layered, with touches of humor and suspense weaved in, The Conversation is one of the great mystery films of the seventies, and is well worth your time. **** ",1248739200,4,2459,4.738317757009346

Yes to Gene Hackman as the ""best bugger"" on the West Coast.  Yes, to watching a man's past turn on his present.  Yes, to Coppola's searing flashes of fantasy in Harry Caul's mind.  Yes, to the pleasure of seeing Robert Duvall and, especially, Harrison Ford before fame.  Yes, to a movie that foregoes the easy photographic pleasures of San Francisco and gets instead its grit and its banality.

1264097,4,B00003CX9I,"This is one of those films that gets better with each viewing.

Like others, at first I asked, ""What's the big deal?"" Well,I gave it another chance, this time with the English subtitles on. I discovered what all those whispers and taped conversations said and it made for a fascinating character study and eventually suspenseful film.

It's the study of a paranoid loner who is suffering a guilty conscience over the work he has done over the years, and what tragic consequences could happen with the latest project he's involved with. Without giving anything away, the loner's fears are realized in a shocking ending, but not in the way he imagined.

Gene Hackman, as always, does a super job of acting. He dominates the film as the main character, ""Harry Call."" The topic matter - high-tech surveillance - was intriguing, too. After watching this film, I wondered what kind of surveillance tools are available now, 35 years after this film was made.",1242864000,2,951,4.8580246913580245

It's primarily interesting as a film to look back at the very dated early '70s styles.",1224028800,4,356,4.758064516129032
1264100,5,B00003CX9I,"There are some works of art that are obviously derivative of others, and obviously inferior, because they simply ape the earlier work, tweak a few minor things, and try to pass off their theft as `homage'. The Conversation (1974), written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is not one of those minor works. It has a manifest endebtedness to Michelangelo Antonioni's brilliant 1966 film, Blowup, yet it does not merely ape that film's existential dilemma of an accidental photograph possibly cluing its lead character into murder. Instead, The Conversation  probes far more deeply into its lead character Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) and his life, to see what might cause a man to misinterpret reality to suit his own psychic needs.
  Another major difference is that the tale in Blowup is one that is wholly accidental, whereas the story The Conversation is built upon is an outgrowth of the deliberate and paid for actions of Caul, the leading West Coast surveillance expert, who has been hired by the mysterious Director (Robert Duvall) of a giant corporation to spy on his wife Ann (Cindy Williams) and her lover Mark (Frederick Forrest). The film opens, around Christmastime, with Caul and his entourage tailing and listening in to the conversation of the two lovers as they stroll in Union Square, an open air park in downtown San Francisco. The fragmented bits of conversation he pieces together only later, and comes to feel that the couple is being set up for murder by his employer. The opening zoom down from a sniper's eye level, focuses on a mime (Robert Shields) who is annoying people in the square. Eventually he sidles up to and mimics Caul, who walks away. The opening scene was filmed by Haskell Wexler, and the rest of the film by Bill Butler, who took over after Wexler and Coppola had a falling out.
  It is a shame that in the nearly thirty years since the 1970s, Coppola has never made a film that comes close to the power of his films from that era. Despite its debt to Blowup, The Conversation is a far more realistic and multi-layered film. That does not mean it's better nor worse than Blowup, just not a ripoff. It is far more internalized, even if a little less subjective, than the earlier film. This seeming disconnect between the objective and that witnessed by the audience only deepens the desire to rewatch the film. Especially great is the fact that the film's lead is the sort of character other films ignore, to focus on one of the players in the love triangle, or perhaps Martin Stett. Caul is a functionary, an apparatchik- yet he's real, and his struggle is every bit as interesting as the `sexier characters'. Yet Coppola heeds Juvenal's query from his sixth Satire: `Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?' (`Who watches the watchmen?') There are many watchers in this film, yet the final watcher is the audience, and what they watch is greatness, simple in its complexity.
  The Conversation is a great, simple, and small film, never too long at an hour and fifty-three minutes, and it may be Coppola's best. It was very timely, considering the milieu of Watergate, but the idea came to him in 1967. It started filming in late 1972, and wrapped shortly before Watergate came to light, yet it has been lost between the three other titanic films he made in the 1970s: The Godfather, The Godfather, Part II, and Apocalypse Now. Whereas those three films were operatic, this film is a chamber piece, and apropos of that, the piano only soundtrack by Coppola's brother in law David Shire, so reminiscent of Erik Satie piano pieces, is perfect, for, as Coppola says in his commentary, the piano is a lonely instrument; lonely as Harry Caul, or an unanswered question.",1221782400,5,3697,4.794348508634223

This one has easily been in my top ten since I saw it for the first time thirty some years ago; it will always remain there. Coppola's brilliance is astonishing. This is a perfect movie, certainly one of the greatest movies ever made. Why? It deals with a deeply flawed but brilliant man who makes the mistake of beginning to care about people, which, in a sense, could become his redemption. But we don't really know. The movie is wonderfully enigmatic, understated, documentary-like at times. You have to listen carefully and to think; Coppola resists hitting you over the head to make a point. Gene Hackman in his greatest role, by far. The late John Cazale in a typically riveting performance (how's that for a filmography for John C: The Deerhunter, The Godfather Saga, Dog Day Afternoon, The Conversation: not too shabby, eh?)! The great Alan Garfield (now Gurwitz) as the ""best bugger on the east coast"". Robert Duvall as the auto exec, with his creepy aide, Harrison Ford.

1264188,4,B00003CX9I,"After the success of the first Godfather picture, Francis Ford Coppola could do anything he wanted. He chose a very loose adaptation from the leading character and basic scenario of Michelangelo Antonioni's Blow-up, to create this both exciting and provocative thriller about a surveillance specialist who finds himself involved in a murder plot.

In Blow-up, a fashion photographer takes a picture in the park and comes to believe that he may have evidence of a murder. The difficulty is that the visual evidence is not conclusive -- it demands interpretation and no amount of manipulation can overcome the ambiguity of the image. Here, Harry Caul uses elaborate techniques to record and collect fragments from what seems to be an innocuous conversation, but that he begins to suspect will be used in a murder plot.

Just as Blow-up became not only a film about a photographer and a murderer but also a meditation on vision and on the cinema -- so The Conversation is a rich and sophisticated film about the nature of sound and the interpretation of sound and in particular about the way in which sound is captured for film. Apart from having an excellent jazz soundtrack, the film is very subtle in its sound editing.

It opens on a crowded park, and we immediately become aware that the sound of the crowds and the music and the individual people and the cars is recorded sound. We hear the subtle distortions that come from blowing up sound recorded from a distance, and that in a finished soundtrack would be removed. It turns out we are both watching the crowd and watching and listening in as a couple in the crowd is being recorded through a number of highly specialized surveillance techniques. Later in the film, we are reminded at several points and in several ways that the sound in a film is an artificial construction and that it is independent of the visuals. Some scenes that initially seem like they are part of the normal exegesis of the film, turn out to be reconstructions based on how certain characters heard and interpreted recorded sound; in other scenes the aural artifacts we have become familiar with show up to indicate that we can never be sure whether the sound is just part of the film or whether it is being recorded by a third party.

This is an excellent film on a number of levels, as a political thriller, as a portrait of a paranoid individual, but also as a meditation on the nature of sound in film. Definitely one to watch ... and listen to.",1204675200,,2481,4.68348623853211
1264189,5,B00003CX9I,"Outstanding psychhological and spiritual film that, because of the content, is basically timeless. Hackman (Caul) is an expert on private surveillance work. A  sordid past has cost him 3 innocent lives in the !960's while doing govermental work. His contention circa 1975 is that he is a private contractor who delivers his ""bugging"" work for a fee. Paranoid that he's being watched, and totally convinced that he's stumbled across another potential murder, he hasn't the courage to contact the police, for fear (real or imagined) of his own safety and reputation. Instead he freezes,and contents himself with eavesdropping on the homicide. Only afterwards does he involve himself in the surprising conclusion, thereby aiding his subsequent psychiatric breakdown.

1264195,5,B00003CX9I,"In-between The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather Part II (1974), Francis Ford Coppola made this techno nerd favorite, a film he had wanted to make for years, but couldn't get the backing until The Godfather gave him the clout.  Coppola has said this is the movie of his that he likes best, and Gene Hackman who stars as Harry Caul, the paranoid, nerdish surveillance snoop who suddenly develops a conscience, said it was his favorite role.  In the case of Hackman, one can see why.  He dominates the screen with a subtle touch and some serious acting skills.  In the case of Coppola, well, I'm sure in his heart of hearts he knows he made at least three better films.  And of course, ""favorite"" doesn't mean ""best.""

Because of some glaring plot holes and assorted implausibilities plus a slow pace, this film is not liked by some viewers.  But it has a kind of haunting power, partly based on the studied camera work, and partly based on a chilling (and clever) story that explodes in Harry Caul's face and surprises the viewer.  Also there is a nice underlying tension that Coppola develops and maintains that makes us want to know what is going on and to find out how it ends.

Cindy Williams of TV's ""Laverne and Shirley"" fame plays Ann, the wife of a Fortune 500 type exec who is being recorded as she has a conversation with a friend as they walk around Central Park.  Harry Caul is doing the snooping.  It isn't clear why the conversation is important, and even though we hear bits of it again and again, it seems innocent, although one notes, Cindy Williams isn't smiling.  As the plot nears denouement, however, we and Harry Caul and the husband, who has hired Caul, realize something is being hidden behind the denotative meaning of the words that are spoken.  Part of the intrigue is to catch the real meaning of what is said.

The plot holes?  Well, it is unlikely that super secret Harry Caul would invite rival snoopers to his studio for a party.  He is so paranoid about people knowing his business that he loses his girlfriend Amy (Teri Garr) because he won't give her his phone number or tell her where he lives.  And the way he tears up his apartment at the end looking for the hidden bug is silly (but psychologically correct of course since he has gone full blown obsessive).  Rationally speaking, he would be better off just moving.  I understand that in the original script penned by Coppola, Harry owned the apartment building and that would explain why he chose to tear up his apartment looking for the recording device rather than move somewhere else.  And think of the professional challenge!

Frankly I didn't mind any of the inconsistencies that viewers have pointed out.  Yes, he would suspect that the pen put in his pocket by rival snooper Bernie Moran (Allen Garfield) might be a microphone, and, no, the hidden bug was NOT in his saxophone, but may have been in his eyeglasses (and anyway it doesn't matter).  What I didn't like were the dream sequences that you couldn't separate from reality.  I also didn't like the pristine clean toilet in room 773 that overflowed with bright red blood when he flushes it.  Not likely, when you think about it.

But none of this matters.  This is an intriguing film with a significant theme, namely that the invasion of privacy has consequences, which is as relevant today as it was then.  Look for a young Harrison Ford as Martin Stett, the exec's assistant, and for Elizabeth MacRae as a caloric-challenged seductress.  But by all means see this for Francis Ford Coppola, one of the greats.  The Conversation is rated #169 at the Internet Movie Database.  It's a must see for Coppola fans.",1189123200,6,3663,4.641304347826087
1264253,5,B00003CX9I,"Despite being released early in 1974 and failing at the box-office, ""The Conversation"" defied the odds by earning an Oscar nomination as Best Picture the same year that Coppola's more ballyhooed ""The Godfather Part II"" won the top prize and five other Oscars. Gene Hackman stars as Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who becomes emotionally involved in his latest assignment. Is the young couple (played by Frederic Forrest and future ""Laverne and Shirley"" star Cindy Williams) being targeted for murder by the executive (an unbilled Robert Duvall) and his assistant (a young and appropriately smug Harrison Ford)?

 Having once worked a job that resulted in the death of an entire family, the haunted Caul oversteps his boundaries and begins to snoop into the case with shocking results. Hackman delivers one of his greatest, most understated performances as Caul, a man who lives a circumscribed life ruled by suspicion. He rides the bus, no doubt for fear that someone might have toyed with the brakes or planted a bomb under the hood.

 ""The Conversation"" is a paranoid masterpiece that brilliantly captures the anxious mood of 1970's America.

1264256,4,B00003CX9I,"THE CONVERSATION (1974) does age well as a character study. Its technology seems dated, of course. Surveillance today I have no doubt would put that old reel to reel tape technology to shame, in the era of microchips and miniaturization. Coppola likes this little film, and he had trouble initially getting it produced. Only his success with THE GODFATHER allowed him the clout to twist a few arms. As a writer, influenced by Tennessee Williams, he wanted to take his small projects and make intimate films, not blockbusters. Isn't it odd that GODFATHER and APOCALYPSE NOW to this point stand as his cornerstone works, allowing him to do several other less successful smaller projects.

Coppola chose his brother-in-law, David Shire to compose the music for THE CONVERSATION, and his haunting single piano seemed to hit just the right emotional timbre; and then to make Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) a saxophone player, who sits solo at night and wails away, was a wonderful secondary touch. Caul was such a cold fish, such a secretive human being; it was fun to hear complete statements coming from him in the language of jazz. It is an interesting name, Caul, meaning veil or membrane over the face of a fetus; heavy symbolism. Coppola stated that he was heavily influenced by Antonioni's BLOW UP (1966), and he liked the idea that the director's camera was watching the surveillance expert as he ""listened"" to other characters; working in a mystery that was also homage to Hitchcock. He, like Antonioni, shot abstractly at his characters, through and around plastic a lot; smoked barriers, rippled windows, pebbled glass, and the incessant appearance of Caul's god awful clear plastic raincoat.

Robert Duvall did an uncredited cameo, and Frederic Forrest, John Cazale, and Teri Garr all did fine work as members of his repertory. Allen Garfield did a bang up job as the competing surveillance expert, Bernie Moran. Garr's sweet, yet sad, cloistered mistress cloys to our minds, in her white socks and short blond locks. A nice surprise was how good Harrison Ford really was in what could have been a non-descript walk on. Coppola was impressed with his inventiveness. Hackman found in Caul a character he could barely live with, and he had difficulty shedding it off camera. Still it stands as some of his best work

Haskell Wexler shot the big opening sequence in the park, with the whole surveillance team. Then he and Coppola had an ""artistic difference of opinion"", and he was replaced by Bill Butler who did a seamless job of the rest of the film. Coppola said he closed down the film four days early because he was so stressed out. The dream sequence with Caul and Cindy Williams in the park, midst all that fog, was supposed to be part of the actual ending of the film, but the fog machine got out of hand, and people complained, sending in the SF police to harass the team. Coppola was faced with providing us with a different ending, and he found a perfect one. Caul, at last succumbed to his personal paranoia, tearing up his apartment looking for the bug Moran used on him, and then sitting exhausted in the wreckage, blowing out his pain in jazz riffs on his sax. Coppola suggested later that the bug might have been in the saxophone strap itself.",1179792000,6,3259,4.795373665480427

1264259,5,B00003CX9I,"""The Conversation"" is a little seen masterpiece from Francis Ford Coppola, made in between ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather Pt. II."" It's a mystery-drama, that plays like a horror movie similar to the Nicolas Roeg film ""Don't Look Now"" in the sense that works with dread, rather than fright. Two-time Academy Award winner Gene Hackman plays Harry Caul, a wiretapper whom we first meet as he's recording a conversation between a young couple in a park. Caul sees his job as a job, he doesn't get involved with the people he records nor does he pay much attention to the details of the conversation. He's supposed to record it and deliver it. His suspicions begin to grow about the tape when he tries to personally deliver it the mysterious person who asked for it and is instead badgered by the man's assistant (Harrison Ford) for it. At the same time we begin to realize how bad Caul is at his job. His partner Stanley (John Cazale) has quit and has already began working for another wiretapper. The superintendent at his apartment building has managed to get inside his multi-locked apartment to drop off a birthday present. A ladyfriend of his tells Harry about a time she watched his spying on someone for an hour...It's no wonder that when a rival wiretapper comes to his office with him he manages to record an intimant conversation between Harry and a woman. While the mystery revolving around ""the conversation"" continues, Harry begins deciphering some of the sentences and his suspicions are confirmed when he hears the sentence: ""He'd kill us if he got the chance?"" This question fuels the rest of the movie, until the very creepy and superb climax. Some of the most haunting parts of the film come at the end and this is due to the visuals of the film. One much-talked about scene comes when Harry flushes a toilet in a motel room and it begins overflowing with blood. This scene (and the few that follow it) are some of the most effectively creepy scenes I've seen in a long time. Gene Hackman is superb as Harry Caul, a multi-layered character that on the page must have seemed very one-dimensional. Harry is a man with no personal life, almost no friends, and he's a man that lives shrouded in mystery. Coppola had already proved by the time this movie came out that he was a cinematic genius, but he's mostly known for movies like ""The Godfather"" and ""Apocalypse Now."" Those films are 3 hour long epic films, but I think to really see how much range Coppola has as a director it's nice to take a look at ""The Conversation."" Few people have seen this movie, it's a much smaller scale film that most of his movies but it's truly a masterwork. Great acting, great direction, great art direction, and great cinematography.

1264260,5,B00003CX9I,"Having just watched THE CONVERSATION for the first time, I must say that I am utterly stunned.  It is one of the best films I have ever seen.  And to think, I just added it to my queue on the off-chance that Francis Ford Coppola's other films in the 1970s would reveal some of the same mastery as the GODFATHER franchise.  Francis Ford Coppola is, indeed, at the top of his game in THE CONVERSATION and the director's own fascination with his own screenplay is evident.  While many have flagged this movie as a 1970s exploration of lies & secrecy stemming from the Watergate incident, ultimately this film proves to be a character study on one of the saddest and complex characters ever to have graced the screen.

The film opens up with a masterful long shot of a park in San Francisco, slowly zooming more and more on a character in the park, whom we later find out is Harry Caul (masterfully played by Gene Hackman in one of the best performances of his career).  Caul looks about him nervously as if paranoid that someone is watching him.  Of course, here we are, silently hovering above him, eavesdropping on Harry Caul's life.  It is the first of many such ""voyeuristic"" shots.  The plot soon becomes apparent.  Caul seems absorbed in following a couple as they walk around in circles in the park, sharing a conversation.  Gradually, it is revealed that there are several characters listening in with powerful directional microphones, all orchestrated by the able hands of Caul.  Harry Caul is one of the best surveillance men in the country and we learn that he gets paid top dollar to do what he does best--tail people, violate their privacy, and emerge with an audio tape of their intimate conversations.  Using the various recorded bits of audio, Harry is able to weave together a single master recording of the couple's conversation.  It is part art and part science.  Everything is going smoothly until Harry begins to listen to the content of his most recent assignment.  While piecing together the final tape, Harry discovers that his tape may lead to the couple's harm.  Despite his professional oaths to complete the job and tune out the content of the audio, Harry plays the tape over and over, further convincing himself that he may be responsible for something terrible.  The truth is that this has happened to Harry before and he has never gotten over it.  Try as he might to cling to the scientific and technical aspects of his craft, he is tortured by his knowledge.

As Harry begins to become more and more involved with his most recent assignment, he becomes involved in a horrible and sinister plot that exposes him to just the sort of surveillance he fears.  What follows is Harry's descent into madness.  Given the nature of Harry's profession, he is a paranoid person, incredibly secretive and constantly convinced that he is being watched.  The sad irony of this fact is that Harry's life is so guarded and closed-off that there is nothing for other's to spy on.  In fact, we (the audience) are the ones who are violating Harry's private life.  There is no pleasure in this voyeurism.  Watching Harry's sad life unravel is a painful experience.  And yet we cannot take our eyes away from the screen.  THE CONVERSATION grabs your attention from the top of the film and doesn't let you go for an instant.  Coppola's shots seem to purposefully mimic the movements of surveillance cameras.  The shots are left open, characters walk in and out of frame, culminating in the film's final shot--a perfectly timed pan (back and forth) across Harry's apartment that feels exactly like watching a surveillance monitor.

The twist at the end of THE CONVERSATION is shocking and mesmerizing--sparking as many questions as it answers.  If you haven't already seen this film, you must drop what you are doing and see it right away.  Gene Hackman turns in one of the best performances of his career, if not the best.  Normally, Hackman plays supermen who are supremely confident of themselves.  It is amazing to see his transformation here, a broken shell of a person, sneaking around in a plastic see-through rain parka.  Coppola's direction is amazing and his camera work is perfectly calibrated to match the mood of the film.  The effect of the ""voyeuristic"" shots is that we feel like intruders into Harry's world, eavesdropping on his private affairs.  And yet, as close as we are brought to Harry, the cold feel of the camera also serves to distance us at the same time.  I now have to see more of Coppola's work, but I can say that this is (by far) the best film that I have seen Coppola direct.  Buy it today; rent it; watch it.",1174089600,3,4649,4.705445544554456

I won't go into detail about the film as others have already done so, but one thing I don't think the Gene Hackman character would have done is to invite everyone back to his place after the convention.  I mean, the guy is so obsessive-compulsive and particular about his stuff that he wouldn't let a bunch of drinkers into his workshop.  Not a big deal, but something that bothers me a bit . . .",1172534400,,524,4.612903225806452
1264331,2,B00003CX9I,"At the end of this film Gene Hackman's character, strung out thanks to his surveillance heavy lifestyle, finally snaps and pulls apart his house in search of a mythical bug. This scene concludes an examination of the psychological toll that surveillance takes not only on the listen-ee but also the listener. Hackman plays Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who is at the top of his field. He gets assigned a mysterious conversation that he has to piece together throughout the film. More interesting to me was to see all the little ways that his job affected his life. He staunchly defends privacy, even though it is his job to invade it. He refuses to open up to people because he is paranoid that anything he says will be used against him. I know that today it is very fashionable to criticize Bush and his wire tapping program but this film only piles on. The chilling affect we watch take place in the world of Harry Caul is a microcosm for what is happening in our world today. Simply because you are aware of Bush's spying ways causes you to engage in self-censorship every time you send an email or talk on a cell phone. Harry deals with the reality of his situation by descending into madness, and while that may not be healthy I'm not going to be the one to say that he is handling it the wrong way.

While there are lessons here that deal with living in Bush's America, this still isn't a very good film. This is a much smaller scale than Coppola usually deals with and it doesn't seem to be a very good fit for him. The script was original and unpredictable. However, it was also slow and filled with nonsense. I watched the film twice and still don't have a firm grasp on what happened at the end. Also, the scene in which we visit Harry's twisted dream was a total miss for me. The purpose was to show just had mad he had gone. To me it looked like Coppola losing control of his script and inserting a scene which only served to take the viewers out of the film. Hackman gives a good performance which was the norm for him pre-""Unforgiven.""  A dashing Harrison Ford is trotted out to remind us of just how old he has gotten. Still, this film falls flat.

Most of the film involves Harry trying to figure out the entire conversation. The tools he is using look downright quaint compared to what we know Big Brother is using today. I liked the way this film reminded me of ""Rear Window."" As in that film we watch as a lonely man has his imagination run away from him. It is a theme that affects us in our daily lives. Every story we hear has holes and lies in it. We have to fill those holes and sort out the BS to come to a perceived reality. But what if we're wrong? Nobody likes being called paranoid and nobody likes to be asleep at the wheel. If for no other reasons watch this film to explore these ideas. Then think about whether your communication behavior is paranoid or ignorant, and whether your Ok with your cell phone coming with a built in bug. **1/2",1158883200,4,2975,4.347122302158273
1264332,5,B00003CX9I,"This is meticulous filmmaking, and it succeeds.

The film begins with a faraway scene, leading into a public square and leading in turn into a broken conversation, and an everyday, but somehow interesting, one at that (because of how it's filmed and edited).

This leads into a fascinating story about this conversation and possibly the greatest character studies ever developed in film, in my opinion, that of a careful wiretapper named Harry Caul, played by Gene Hackman.  He is quite neurotic, and maybe even paranoid, but definitely eccentric.

As Coppola puts it, he could've taken the side of principle, or he could've taken the side of the eavesdropper in this film, and he decided to take the perspective of the voyeur, with fascinating results.  Beyond the greater scope of the ethics of privacy, and the question of when to step in to possibly stop something horrible, the viewer will delight in how originally this story is told, in cryptic fragments.

This film has one of those plots that is impossible to describe with justice without seeing and too good to even reveal with spoiler warnings.

The actors, crew, and the director all seem to be in accord.  The result is seamless.  I consider this an essential, must-see film, and it is better than The Godfather or Apocalypse Now.",1157241600,2,1294,4.89908256880734

I admit I found it slow during the first half but worth watching for the second half. The last 20 minutes or so is especially good. It also has a very young Harrison Ford. Three years before Star Wars. One reason I watched this movie is because it was an Academy Award Nominee for Best Picture.",1154995200,,555,4.450980392156863
1264334,5,B00003CX9I,"For all the praise Coppola garnered with ""The Godfather"", his work on ""The Conversation"", though not as romantic as his mobster classic, is even more deserved of his directorial genius. Coppola presents maximum mood and feel with minimal, even seemingly irrelevant dialogue at first listen, unless of course you know Coppola and realize every ounce of dialogue has significant meaning in the end. One will see this in the work of his daughter, Sofia, in the future (""Lost In Translation""). The timing of this movie's content and it's relevancy to Watergate is no coincidence, but its impact is temendous. Not only does the content of every second of this movie make one realize the extent of the possiblities and ramifications of Watergate (when this movie was released), but of everyday life, and how easily one's personal privacy can be invaded. One can't walk away from this movie without a touch of paranoia, and a test of one's morality. Trademark Coppola, particularly in his prime in the 70s where he made his viewers question the ramifications of their everyday actions, behaviors, conversations and involvements. Gene Hackman is outstanding as the lead character, Harry Caul, the renowned genius of surveillance, His portrayal of a paranoid man who realizes the ramifications of his work is brilliant, and portrayed only with combination of his and Coppola's skills, along with masterful editing and memorable scenes. Coppola makes use of great character actors, and often and/or previously used Coppola favorites- Harrison Ford, John Cazale, Cindy Williams, Robert DuVall, Terri Garrr and Frederick Forest are among an incredibly effective cast, and script. By the time this movie reaches is climax, your suspicions of the possibilities of every day life built up little by little in this movie are only reaffirmed, to a creepy extent. A masterpiece  of a film with all the trademarks of a Coppola gem, overshadowed only by his classic standard that all his future films would be measured by (""Godfather""). One of my all time favorite films, but toughest watches. One needn't be involved in any seedy behavior to walk away from this film with a touch of paranoia. Don't think that wasn't by design.

Cast:  Gene Hackman, John Cazale, Allen Garfield, Frederic Forrest, Cindy Williams, Elizabeth MacRae, Michael Higgins, Teri Garr, Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall.

Running Time:  113 minutes

Rated R for language and a scene of violence.

He's supposed to be the leading authority in freelance surveillance, but from the start there are hints that while he's good, he's also careless. While his apartment is locked, his landlord leaves him a Happy Birthday present. His mistress, Amy (Teri Garr in a small role) tells him she saw him standing in the staircase for an entire hour. He invites a rival co-worker to his office (which seems to be a warehouse) with several other people and carelessly allows the man to record his own conversation by means of what looks to be an innocuous pen, which wouldn't be out of place in any James Bond movie. And his liaison with a call girl he meets at that party results in her stealing the tapes of a conversation he has recorded and that has lately been the focus of his obsession.  This is Harry Caul (played brilliantly by Gene Hackman), a loner who is a little too glum to be good company and takes his work seriously, perhaps too seriously, which eventually proves to be his downfall. The fact that his own co-worker Stan (John Cazale) leaves him to go work for a rival agency, only serves to prove Harry is really someone who is so much a loner he drives anyone away from him. He can't seem to have any form of relationship -- it's only time when Amy will also leave him as she seems somewhat frustrated by this wall of privacy he's built around himself. His entire life revolves around secrecy, and he only is able to live vicariously throughout others, even if he himself feels guilty about it and would deny it because to top it all, he has a strong religious streak, and discloses under confession that he was witness of a surveillance gone wrong and which resulted in the deaths of three people. Now this assignment from The Director (in a cameo by Robert Duvall) has him worried: he's listened to a conversation between a man and a woman and is afraid the woman's husband may try to kill them both.

As Harry slowly drags himself into the precarious business of strangers, the film's intentions become increasingly suspenseful and perplexing. Director Francis Ford Coppola (""The Godfather"" films) maintains his deliberately methodical pace throughout the entire film; it is only through our imagination that we are capable of creating and perpetuating such a consistently fascinating atmosphere surrounded by a cloud of tension and mystique. The Assistant Director (a young Harrison Ford) never physically carries himself as an intimidating antagonist; it is through the complexity of the film's plot and through the continual uncertain environment that we are able to associate this element with his character. Every person that carries himself in a convincingly dubious manner immediately becomes a potential suspect. Harry becomes compulsively obsessed with the fate of his client's targets, completely submerging himself into the substance of the recordings, looking for any potential details that might assist him in solving the mystery. Harry's investigation quickly becomes our task as well, as we begin to subconsciously observe and scrutinize each character involved. The beauty of Coppola's film is the fact that it makes its point by using the audience as proof of the inherent devious nature of privacy. The movie transports us into Harry's world, as we become infatuated with the secretive plot unfolding before us, and we desperately search for clues into the lives of the film's characters. Of course, after intense investigation, Harry ultimately comes to realize that he has violated all of the principles that he had once stood proudly for. Whether or not Harry ended up better off by becoming involved in the dealings of others is a completely subjective matter, but it is a crucial question that the viewer must ask him/herself.  This film, certainly one of Coppola's greatest of his illustrious career, is one of mystery and paranoia. The great performances of Hackman and Ford make this stand out, and the mystery that surrounds the plot creates suspense that keeps the audience focused and interested throughout. In general, this is one of the best mystery and suspense thrillers of the decade.",1149724800,6,4398,5.004103967168263

1264338,5,B00003CX9I,"Francis Ford Coppola's masterful insight into the clandestine world of surveillance ""The Conversation"" was appropriately released at the time of the Watergate scandal.  The venerable Gene Hackman taciturnly plays Harry Caul an intensely private world renowned surveillance expert who lives in a world sheltered from personal interactions.

Hackman is hired to record a conversation between a young couple walking through a park by a man known as the Director, played in a cameo by Robert Duvall.  He ingeniously orchestrates a scheme using a four man team to record the dialogue between Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest playing the couple.  While analyzing the tapes he realizes that the couple may be getting set up for execution.  In his past a previous surveillance job of Hackman's resulted in the murder of three people.

Hackman suddenly comes to grips with his conscience and has misgivings about relinquishing the tapes to the Director's assistant Martin Stett played by a very youthful Harrison Ford.  Hackman is set up and the tapes are stolen from him.  Determined to short circuit the possible execution he sets himself up in a hotel room adjoining a room mentioned in the recorded conversation.  Using a listening device he hears a violent crime being committed but not the one he expected.

Back in the safety of his supposedly bug proof apartment, Hackman gets a phone call from Ford threatening him to forget what happened.  Hackman is also made aware that his fortress of solitude apartment has been wiretapped, his worst possible hellish nightmare.

1264389,5,B00003CX9I,"For my money, this is the best movie Francis Ford Coppola ever made.

Say what you will about the imitated-to-the-point-of-parody ""Godfather"" movies, or the often brilliant piece of film madness that is ""Apocalypse Now."" I'd still rather talk about ""The Conversation.""

Ostensibly a thriller about a professional wiretapper and his surveilance of a single conversation in what appears to be an adulterous relationship, ""The Conversation"" is also a a thought-provoking masterwork about secrets, lies, spies and power in Watergate-era America, and an excellent character study about the interplay between conscience and professionalism in one profoundly real, profoundly fascinating man.

The man in question, Harry Caul, is obsessed with secrets--keeping his own, and finding out other people's. Gene Hackman's riveting portrayal of Caul--a dramatic change of pace from iron-willed characters like ""The French Connection""'s Popeye Doyle--shows us a man riven by conflicting emotions. Pride, obsessiveness, professionalism, lust, and good old Catholic guilt are all at war in Harry's tortured soul, pulling him in a multitude of different directions as the movie unfolds.

At the film's outset, we see him overseeing the surveilance of the conversation in question, a perplexing, half-heard dialogue between a young couple out for a lunchtime stroll in a public park in San Francisco. Snippets of this conversation loop through Harry's mind and through the movie, playing and re-playing, but he--and we--only gradually uncover its true meaning.

Gradually, Harry begins to suspect that, if he does his job right, the couple in question may be killed. In a mesmerizing drunken dream sequence, he walks after the woman on a foggy night, trying to clear his own conscience about what he has done and what he might do. To the women in his life, Harry is maddeningly tight-lipped--not mentioning his birthday until the day of, lying about his age for no apparent reason, saying nothing about his professional or personal life--but to this dream-apparition, he is willing to say everything, from his oldest memories to his darkest fears.

Haunted by those fears, and by the consequences of his past behavior in a similar situation (just like Jack Nicholson's Jake Geddes in 1974's also-excellent ""Chinatown""), Harry tries to make things turn out better this time. But events soon rocket out of control on their way to an unforgettable, poetic, haunting ending.

If you don't own this movie, buy it--putting it in your Netflix queue or hopping over to Blockbuster and watching it only once will leave you cheated, though you won't know it at the time. For even if (like me) you can figure out the exact mechanics of the plot on the first run-through, added viewings reveal deeper themes and fuller layers of meaning behind seemingly insignificant snippets of dialogue. Like the conversation that loops and skips throughout the film, ""The Conversation"" can't be fully comprehended in just one take.",1136160000,54,2988,5.3312101910828025

  One of Gene Hackman's biography pages mentioned this movie as being a favorite character role of his, as it proved so much a contrast to the domineering figures skillfully portrayed in films such as ""The French Connection"" and ""The Poseidon Adventure."" When one thinks of capturing the the audience by force of will, these strong typecasts most often come to mind. By contrast, the Harry Caul character he plays here, a troubled, complex introvert, draws your attention in as a viewer out of curiousity - due to his reluctantance to reveal anything of significance about his own character to anyone in his empty life. His misery of internal conflict over his latest assignment, revealing fragments of a disconnected existence, provides a sympathetic and somber draw about the film I found  intriguing. This melancholy mood was further accented when combined with the beautiful, recurring, haunting piano score and somber saxophone wails by Hackman's character. With an ending sequence that fit so poignantly against a backdrop of intrigue, surveillance, unwinnable power struggles, it stands one of my top psychological thrillers as well as a favorite  Hackman role.",1128384000,5,1367,5.223744292237443

I could see no reason for this particular flashback.  However, Caul also wore eyeglasses, taking them off and putting them on occasionally. So, do you think.....?  I wish Francis Ford Coppola would tell us if this was coincidental, or was it a clue to the location of the bugging device?

1264394,4,B00003CX9I,"This review is for the 2000 Paramount Widescreen DVD release.

The basic story line involves a free-lance surveillance expert name Harry Caul (played by Gene Hackman) who with the help of a high-tech field team records a conversation between a man and a woman in an open plaza in San Francisco.  The recording is made for a director of a private company (played by Robert Duvall).  While piecing segments of the conversation together from at least three surveillance tapes, Harry is greatly disturbed because he believes from the dialogue that foul play is inevitable.

I won't go into the rest of the plot or the ending because I'd hate to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie.  In my opinion the film ended a little flat and arguably flawed and therefore I think there were better ways to end it.  Gene Hackman does deliver another great performance.  This movie in some ways reminds me of a later Hackman film entitled ""Enemy of the State"" which in my opinion is a much better film than this movie.  This movie also showcases a very young Harrison Ford.  The pace is slow and deliberate, but is well acted and the technology holds up well, even for being 30 years old.  Another strength of the movie is that it seems like a coldwar spy film, yet it deals with ominous people within the confines of the American borders that you or I could deal with on a daily basis.  Overall, it's a very good movie, but not a great one for me.

The DVD transfer is sharp and flawless with vivid color.  You won't be disappointed with the look of the movie.

1264397,5,B00003CX9I,"Harry Caul is an expert in the field of electronic surveillance. He has been hired by the director of a large corporation to record a conversation between his wife and another man. It is no easy feat. The conversation will occur in a noisy public place. The targets know they may be watched. They speak low, allusively and are forever in motion. Caul, his assistant Stan and two students borrowed from the AV department of a nearby university tape the conversation with but three pickups: a mic planted in the shopping bag of a man following the couple and two parabolic microphones mounted with cross-hairs from atop surrounding buildings. Later, and further to his expertise, Harry will sit at a bench in his workshop with four tape players and will slowly begin to cut and mix the recordings into an intelligible, uninterrupted run of speech--a conversation, the conversation.

The story owes a little something to Antonioni's Blow Up (in which a photographer tries to decipher a tale seemingly told in a series of grainy, blown-up photographs) and the character of Harry Caul may be a descendent of Kafka's harassed tribe of persecuted everymen. Harry knows both too much and too little; he is an expert and an innocent. He can tape anyone anywhere and lift the fuzz of ambient noise and extraneous voicings from the most impossibly difficult mixes; but Harry lives at a remove, at a distance from the world on which he spies. His experience of the world outside his lab is always mediated through some mechanical filter: a microphone, a camera lens, undiscriminating magnetic tape. They stand between Harry and love, friendship, compassion--between Harry and involvement in what he considers a dangerous blur of unprofessional inquiry.

But the conversation he has deciphered has ended on an unexpected and jarring note. It pricks his conscience and Harry suddenly sees his targets as people and finds himself obliged to decipher meanings, feelings and emotive codes with which he is studiously unfamiliar. Harry isn't sure what he knows about the couple and their impending dilemma, but he knows too much about the inner-workings and the underpinnings of a world where knowledge is invasion. Harry finally decides to intervene, to act to help the couple. And this harrowing, climactic scene shows Harry once again employing an unrivaled expertise in the pursuit of information that he is ill-equipped to interpret. The result is the ultimate discovery that he was never at any real remove from the world--it was always watching him and with a skill far surpassing his own. It is a revelation with which Harry cannot live peaceably and dooms him to his obsessive and ultimately paralyzing paranoia in what is, perhaps, the most haunting conclusion in cinematic history.

I hope you will take my word for it when I tell you that this is Francis Ford Coppola's finest work--spare, focused, minimalist direction, perfectly complementing a singularly deep, rich charge of narrative. And Gene Hackman has never been better.",1112745600,,3023,5.066265060240964
1264398,5,B00003CX9I,"Pure, unpretentious genius unfolds before the viewer in this complex film, simply told, complete with what has to be one of the subtlest ""gotchas"" in cinema. From a cinematic perspective, The Conversation breaks the rules, which Coppola expertly reinvents, from the first slow, achingly long voyeuristic zoom into Union Square to the cold empty layers of Harry Caul's (his name a rather silly pun) apartment that echo his isolated, threatened existence. Coppola's camera distances the viewer from Caul, but just like Caul's transparent raincoat, we see beyond the lens into the quiet, tortured confines of Caul's mind.

As a story, The Conversation relies again upon subtlety and a patient viewer to watch Caul ironically become a casualty of his own profession. As Caul is the architect of his own success, he too becomes the architect of his own demise. The joke is on Harry, as the viewer, too, peers into the life of a man obsessed with privacy, a man who ultimately faces an unthinkable future...life under an ever watchful eye.",1101686400,,1033,5.04093567251462

FFC was off working on Godfather II, so perhaps the Editor has a little more freedom and time to work his magic. Funny-most of the workers of the young studio were non-union so he could not even be credited as a picture or sound Editor. Famous Director of Photography Haskell Wexler was ""let go"" by Francis very early on and replaced. This action gave the film a superior look, for the theme of the film. You have to love the retro vibe of all that electronic tape gear in the digital age we now live. The visual look is crisp and stunning. If you view this DVD-watch BOTH commentaries. The haunting piano melody over the DVD Menu and that appears throughout the story-is worth appreciation alone. I actually sat down and counted out both sets of machine gun triplets in what is a rather dreamy piece of solo piano. As many have said already-this belongs in your DVD library.

1264452,5,B00003CX9I,"Reading over the reviews here of this remarkable movie, I'd say most of its virtues have been well covered, and what's behind most of the bad reviews uncovered: people who don't get this movie are ones who need the usual thriller or Godfather stuff, which this film doesn't provide. It's small-scale, enormously subtle in story and acting, and its originality is as subtle as the rest of it. Among the trio of friends who came up together--Spielberg and Lucas the others--I think Coppola was the only real grownup, and the most ambitious to say something truly serious, though he also had the grand visual flair of the other two. The Conversation is at the heart of his work. If I had to compare it to anything, it'd be the Melville story ""Benito Cereno,"" in which we think we know what's going on but we don't, not at all. Other reviewers mention the ""philosophical"" aspect. For me, here's what that's about: With the most sophisticated technology available, professional bugger Harry Caul finds out what two people said. But what he doesn't understand is the _meaning_ of what they said, and the meaning is what makes the difference. The way Coppla reveals that, with a little trick of sound, is for all its quietness one of the most brilliant and hair-raising moments I know in film. It's a parable of technology, of the meaning of truth, of the nature of preconceptions (who we expect to be the bad guys aren't) and lots else--the philosophically inclined can take their pick. In my own list of greatest movies of all time, this is somewhere in the first five. If you don't need exploding fireballs in your thrillers and know great acting and directing when you see it, this movie is as good as it gets.",1080432000,4,1707,4.674418604651163
1264453,5,B00003CX9I,"This movie is a sheer and distinct case study.
The case is, the lonesome by choice and by profession, anti-hero Harry Caul, a private surveillance expert and his own paranoid very blocked world.
The title refers to the task he has been assigned to, to record a conversation between two people in a crowded square during a lunch time break. He succeeded in his mission at first, but when he tried to live inside his task, he failed in his life.
I recommend you; do not criticize this deliberately slow going movie while it is running.
This movie moves like flowing molasses. It reveals its own layers and secrets with each going moment, get assured that you will be completely satisfied when it ends.
Consider how close the director succeeded in creating  the sense of the overwhelming paranoia, at first you get skeptic, asking if Caul is overacting in his cautious way of life, then you get yourself skeptic too, imagining the number of conspirators surrounding him and may have roles in the crime.
The movie depends on the understanding of the screenplay by its creators.
The theme concentrates on longing to, retrieving, and then consequently the losing of believes; in love, personal capabilities and maybe in religious believes.
Look for the motive that began all this conflicts. It is the search for love.
The love he observed between the two young people of his surveillance task.
The love that moved him backward towards his past, in feeling the guilt towards the victims of his previous tasks,
And forward towards his search for love and meaning.
This motive that reminded him of the necessity being human, of asking questions about nature if his job. Is it just to be a delivery man or to be like an artist who reacts with the elements of his art work, the motive to be an insider instead of being an outsider.
And then comes the revelation and its consequences, when he realizes how far he was wrong, fragile and unsafe.
So he chooses to surrender and escape to his last (maybe) safe refuge, his own saxophone.
Just like its music score, this movie goes like a classical music piece.
With perfect tempo and without one unnecessarily line.
Notice these two considerable key scenes.
1-While the conversation between Hackman and Ford in the convention, there is that man, who carries a Saxophone which might or not be tapped, might or not be replaced by the one in the Caul's apartment. And the latter is might or not be the only thing that could be tapped and left without checking in Caul's apartment.
2- Caul's dream vision of the hotel room no. 773 is as the same as in the real hotel. We cannot assume that the director was very conservative about the money spent on locations. But of course it was meant to be like that, in order to implement the dreamy reality of the final act of this movie.",1071360000,,2807,4.659274193548387

Made during the paranoia surrounding Watergate, ""The Conversation"" manages to resonate more today. I'm not talking Patriot Act or the War on Terrorism. I'm talking about the Internet. Harry Caul hides behind technology, uses it to connect with people, yet cannot connect with real-live human beings. His one ""friend"" -- the colleague played by the late John Cazale -- he even fails to relate to, unless it's strictly about the work.
In the end, Harry's isolation becomes complete when the technology he uses becomes his jailer. The final panning shot of this film is worth the entire DVD alone, but the commentary tracks provide priceless insight into the mind of Coppola at the time when he was still an outsider himself.",1068508800,,942,5.083870967741936
1264455,4,B00003CX9I,"You have seen ""Who-Dun-Its."" This is more like a riveting ""Who-Will-Do-It.""

What a passionate movie about a surveillance man, who by profession records conversations for clients, for purposes unknown to him (how a client uses the recording is not his business.) During one of such recordings, he believes he has captured the plotting of a murder. A gratingly intriguing quandary ensues, one that'll have you glued to the screen until the very end!
For one thing, the movie does NOT feel like 1974 with its immaculate DVD transfer. If it weren't for the music, which is markedly 70s, or the nature of telephones (the type you turn with your fingers, instead of buttons) you really couldn't tell it was the seventies.
Secondly, Coppola did a fabulous job of making the technology credible to viewers. Pay attention to minor details, the film makes no presumptions about audience's intelligence. For instance, you'll also be taken around an actual symposium of surveillance tech, and presented a detailed scene where surv pros talk about possible ways of making recordings for a specific case.
Apart from the mystery that forms an absolutely electric undercurrent for the theme, it's also a great lesson on how sophisticated technology means very little without the human brain to make the correct lecture of ""objective"" results.

1264457,5,B00003CX9I,"Most of us know at least one person who can compartmentalize her or his life, separating business from pleasure, career from family, etc. Such people have exceptional focus and determination. Brilliantly portrayed by Gene Hackman, Harry Caul is such a person. (Even his girlfriend Amy, played by Teri Garr, does not know where he lives.) Harry is an expert technician who is retained to conduct electronic surveillance of those identified by his clients. In effect, he is a high-tech private investigator. What he records becomes evidence of illegal, unethical, or immoral behavior. Harry has no personal interest in the private lives he invades surreptitiously. But then he accepts an assignment and begins to suspect that the subjects of his surveillance will be murdered. The ""compartments"" in his life which Harry has so carefully separated begin to merge (albeit gradually) and he begins to have second thoughts about how he earns a living. Of course, he is better qualified than any other character in the film to understand (if not yet fully appreciate) the implications of an invasion of privacy. Under Francis Ford Coppola's brilliant direction, Harry begins to feel paranoid.

I view The Conversation as a dark film because its raises so many questions which seem even more relevant today than they were in 1974. How secure can any life be? Who is accumulating personal as well as professional data about whom? Why? Satellites can take photographs of a license plate. All of the data on computer hard drives can be recovered. DNA tests can determine whether or not a monarch was poisoned hundreds of years ago. In so many ways, ""there is nowhere to run and nowhere to hide"" from modern technologies. What intrigues me most about Harry Caul is his growing sense of dislocation and vulnerability as the conflict between his personal conscience and professional objectivity intensifies. The assignment for The Director (Robert Duvall) to conduct surveillance on Ann (Cindy Williams) and Mark (Frederic Forest) serves as a trigger which activates self-doubts and insecurities which Harry has presumably suppressed and denied for many years.

For me, the final scene is most memorable because it's so ambiguous. To what extent has Harry invaded his own privacy? What has he learned? How will he now proceed with his personal life and career? For whatever reasons, only in recent years has this film received the praise it deserved but was denied when it first appeared almost 20 years ago. It seems to get even better each time it is seen again, especially in the DVD format which offers clearer image and sound as well as several excellent supplementary items such as commentaries by Coppola and his supervising editor Walter Murch as well as a ""Close-Up on the Conversation"" featurette.",1063065600,175,2793,5.096069868995633

1264522,5,B00003CX9I,"This is not a movie that you might expect from Francis Ford Coppola.  That is, not unless you've seen something by him besides the Godfathers and Apocalypse Now.  It is a very Hitchcockian tale of a paranoid man's descent into madness.
Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) is the world's greatest serveilance expert.  It is through one of his ""jobs"" for someone that he makes his descent.  I don't really want to say more than that about the plot, because it is way better if you see it without knowing anything about it (and if you intend to do that, stop reading reviews after mine, because the ones below mine reveal spoilers).
That said, this movie has a great cast.  Gene Hackman is brilliant.  He is not his usual, overly energetic, constantly yelling self in this movie.  He plays the role subtlely, which is perfect to show Harry's shy, inward personality.  Harry is, because of his paranioa, very much the loner, and Hackman's usual acting just wouldn't fit in here.  He positively nails this role.
Let's not forget the supporting actors.  John Cazale (an underrated actor and one of my person favorites)plays Harry's employee in the serveilance firm, Robert Duvall plays the guy who hires Harry for the job that eventually sends him into madness, Harrison Ford (I love the way he acts in FFC's movies (see Apocalypse Now), he is completely different from all his other roles.  He is cold and ruthless in this-none of that sarcastic wit and quick grin here) plays Duvall's employee, and Cindy Williams plays one of the people who Harry is hired to watch.  They are all excellent.  I thought that it would be hard believing Cindy Williams in a role such as this because of her days on Laverne and Shirley, but she pulls it off wonderfully.
Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant writer.  Almost every movie that he has written has been a masterpiece.  This oft-overlooked gem is no exception.  His script (like Hackman's acting) has a subtlety that perfectly fits with the main character's personality.  He really is showing his talent with this movie.  Why Francis felt that he should stop making good movies in the 90's (e.g. Jack, The Rainmaker (a good movie, but nothing of this caliber), Peggy Sue Got Married, etc) is beyond me.  Maybe he (God forbid) lost his touch or something.  I sure hope not.  Francis, make something good again!  Your ""good"" is the equivalent of everyone else's ""once in a lifetime masterpiece"".  Maybe it's because everytime he tries to make something good, he gets screwed (e.g. Apocalypse Now (money trouble) and the Godfather (studio trouble)).  Oh well, who knows.
I got a little off track there, but my mind often wonders...  Anyway, this movie is definately one of those that you can't miss.  If you like Taxi Driver, this is a less violent version.  That's the closest comparision I can think of to give you an idea of what this movie's about.  Even though saying this won't convince you (yeah, I read your ""rules"" Mike Stone, and if you're allowed to break them, I'm allowed to break them), I must say it anyway:  Highly recommended.

1264524,4,B00003CX9I,"For a movie with a reputation as an unseen masterpiece, ""The Conversation"" is somewhat flawed; there are facets of it that appear quite amateurish.  On the other hand, there's even more that's spellbinding and mind bending and awe inspiring.
Let's start with the cons.  Francis Ford Coppola, as screenwriter, fills his story with a lot of obvious psychology.  He makes a point of having Harry Caul pick up a piece of trash, on an otherwise spic and span path, before a late night rendezvous in a lady friend's apartment (he's meticulous, but he's also dirty!).  We see Harry open an intricate system of three locks before he enters his apartment (he's paranoid!).  And when we see the inside of said apartment, it's barely furnished, except for the essential amenities (he's empty on the inside, too!).  The visual imagery that Coppola utilizes feels equally contrived.  Harry has an ever-present overcoat; only it's so thin and diaphanous that its main function -- to hide Harry from the outside world -- is not served.  This dovetails nicely with his surname, which also tries to serve the same function, unsuccessfully.
Okay, the above seems like nitpicking to me.  They're things that jumped out at me while watching the movie, things that a subtler screenwriter (nobody ever accused Coppola of being subtle) would have hidden better.  Not that they distract from the brilliance that is the rest of the movie.

Tops on the list of brilliant things here is, of course, Gene Hackman as Harry Caul.  One of our best actors, Hackman is usually asked to chew scenery, provide charisma, and pump up a film's energy.  Here, he does none of that.  I've mentioned before how some of my favourite film performances involve an actor known for his energy having it forcibly bottled up (see Billy Bob Thornton in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"").  Hackman shows how this is done best.
He is terrific when showing us Harry's social ineptitude.  When in the company of other surveillance technicians, Harry is quiet.  He knows that everything he says will have gravity, seeing as he's the top man in the business.  He doesn't need to say much, while still standing out.  But when he's with civilians, his shyness, awkwardness, and clumsiness burst to the forefront.  Hackman slithers back and forth between these two of Harry's personas with such skill and precision, you're liable to forget you're watching a movie.  The performance feels like you're spying on an unsuspecting subject.
Coppola, as screenwriter (again), does some things right.  He's created a Hitchcockian thriller, only more psychological than Hitchcock ever got.  Sure, there's the aspect of the movie that involves human deviousness, and the audience is engaged in trying to solve a dangerous mystery.  But that's just a starting point.  Listen: the people Harry works for, and the people he's spying on, are all MacGuffins.  They appear, at first glance, to be integral to what the movie is about.  Actually, the movie is about the inner torment of a paranoid and lonely man.  The rest is just window dressing.  Skilled window dressing, but inconsequential nonetheless.
Coppola, as director, is a magician here.  He's at his best when showing us how Harry puts a surveillance tape together.  He's been contracted to tape the conversation of the film's title, which will take place in a crowded quad.  In order to get it, Harry uses four different microphones at four different stations.  Coppola shows us the quad scene many times from many different angles, as we follow along with Harry to try and find the best angle to listen from.  It's one man's Rashomon.  The film is fascinating to watch in these scenes, as we are privy to the machinations of the buggers at work.
Complementary in these scenes is the brilliant work of the film's sound team.  They have created a sounds cape that is developed perfectly, where layer upon layer of noise is filtered away until the information is slowly revealed.  Don't you dare watch this movie with anything less than a quality sound system, or half the accomplishment will lost.
""The Conversation"" moves slowly but assuredly.  It is more an impressive achievement than an entertaining one.  Still, for the paranoid cineaste, you can't do much better.",1009929600,5,4250,4.957567185289958

By the end of the film it is not so much that little has been learned about Harry, but that one fears there is hardly anything to learn.  Hackman has been praised and he does evince a sense of guardedness and paranoia which is compelling, but his is also a performance that suggests a rather frightening emptiness (contrary to Coppola's intention, as mentioned in his commentary, of having Harry Caul possess a 'lively and passionate core').  Coppola also refers to Hermann Hesse's novel 'Steppenwolf', and in this reference I think he again betrays the problem with the film, in that Harry Haller could well be taken as the skeleton of a man in search of a character, or better still, keen to divest himself of a character, not a conventional character open to conventional study. Still, the film's atmosphere and the resonances it has with its times are powerful, the sound and design, inventive.  Coppola seems to revel in hanging many of his casual insights over the basic scaffolding of the film - his commentary, too, operates primarily on this level: his enthusiams focus on incidentals (interesting incidentals, but incidentals nevertheless), such as Harrison Ford's alleged brilliance in adding 'depth' to his character (with cookies); at times, Coppola seems to be hiding too - for instance he waxes over the 'loneliness' of the solo piano score, and how he had never heard of a film score using a solo instrument, yet earlier on he mentions Michelangelo Antonioni who is reknowned for using just such scores.  So, it's almost as if the context of America, specifically America in the early 70's, provides much of the richness of this film, because Harry Caul certainly does not - he remains unknown to himself, to us, and, judging from the commentary, unknown largely to Coppola.",996019200,6,2131,4.905555555555556
1264562,5,B00003CX9I,"Gene Hackman proves he can act in this movie.  Matched along with Gene, John cazale is a great supporting actor.  All great movies need a great music score and the music perfectly matches the plot of this movie.  Using San Franscisco as the movies setting, fuels the movie's mystery.  I think this is Coppola's best movie.  Get this movie while you can.  It is special.",995760000,,369,4.6
1264563,5,B00003CX9I,"""The Conversation"" is an great movie to study from an editing point of view. After Coppola shot the film, he handed everything over to editor and sound designer Walter Murch. Coppola had to work on ""The Godfather Part II"" and had given Murch pretty much carte blanche to do what he needed to do. This film is as much as Murch's work (if not more) as it is Coppola's.
While the role of the director is pretty well known and understood (mostly exagerated) by the general public, the editor is less often recognized. Indeed, ask anyone off the street to name ten direcotrs, they can likely come up with a list of names. Ask them to name three editors, they will draw a blank. This DVD is unusual, in that it includes a full length commentary by Murch (testament to his role in the creation of this film) as well as a track by Coppola. Buy this DVD. Compare the commentary tracks. You may find, as I did, the editor's track to be more revealing about the craft of filmmaking.
As far as how I feel about the acting, I won't add to the praise already written in the previous reviews, except to say that you must look at the actors in the context of the time when the film was made. Gene Hackman was a big star. A leading man. For him to portray a somewhat unattractive man was quite a risk. Harrison Ford, on the other hand, was a nobody. Althogh his was a minor role, not much bigger than that of an extra, Ford brings tremendous power and presence to the character.
If you become as fascinated by editing as I have become, I recommend the book ""In the Blink of an Eye"" by Murch. A slim volume but speaks to the role of the editor and the nature of modern film.",994204800,2,1656,4.26031746031746
1264593,2,B00003CX9I,"I think Gene Hackman is a wonderful actor and does not disappoint in this movie.  But the movie itself is not at all like a Hitchcock film; I don't understand the comparison.  It is slow-moving and lacks suspense.  I know what Coppola was trying to do, show that the listener was now the one being listened to, but it didn't play well. His character is difficult to like.  Harrison Ford shows up in a small role, but even that does not save this movie.  You'd be better off skipping this one; another example of critics offering too much praise for a film.",993168000,5,556,4.411764705882353
1264594,4,B00003CX9I,"When I watch the Conversation, I am reminded of that other '70s classic, Mean Streets.  Both have some of our best talent in their younger years, both have that same cinema verite spirit of just letting the scene go on, even if some find it boring or uncomfortable, and both of them seem to have been made on a shoestring budget.  Where Scorcese scores just a little bit higher, for me, is that I feel he incorporates the music into Mean Streets more, and has a few more threads and subplots to keep our attention.  I think part of the reason some may find this movie boring is that essentially the Hackman character is the film - we don't really care about the other people in the surveillance business (they seem like pompous jerks), nor do the young couple in the park really seem that interesting.  (The exception is the John Cazale character, who is more sympathetic and human).  Hackman is superb, however, and we find in his character a man who has learned the hard way to mind his own business and shut himself off from the rest of the world - but of course, his humanity gets the better of him. One aspect of the movie that I find interesting is that it would appear he was right in his paranoia - if it is true that he is not necessarily happy at the beginning of the movie, he is a miserable shambles of a man at the end.  This is a good movie, with a great performance by Hackman, and some pretty good bonus features.  I would recommend it to fans of Hackman or '70s cinema.",989884800,,1486,4.304659498207886

He gets close to people for a living (by bugging their conversations), yet he is unable to allow anyone in his personal life get close to him.  I think Hackman's performance was deserving of an Oscar nomination, but the competition was fierce in '74.  This is an ecellent film with a terrific ending.

1264596,5,B00003CX9I,"There is something about Hackman, slouched in his rumpled clear plastic raincoat; something in the sense of isolation, of despair and hopelessness so deep that he has ceased noticing.  He's like a homeless man - the kind you pretend not to notice when you walk past.  That he happens to have a place to live and plenty of money is beside the point.  Hackman's character is broken, lonely, used up, empty.  He so desperately needs validation...and he will never get it.
Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation is not so much a thriller as a deconstruction of the thriller genre.  As embodied by Gene Hackman, surveillance expert Harry Caul is an archetype: he is Late 20th-Century American Man.  He is the result of the dislocation between the decent impulses of a traditional upbringing and the demands of the cold, bloodless technological age in which he must operate.
Harry is hired by ""the director"" (Robert Duvall), a man who sits at the top of a large, faceless corporation (we don't know what they do, but it's irrelevant, anyway).  His job is to record a seemingly innocuous conversation between a man and woman as they walk through Union Square in San Francisco.  Against his better judgment, Harry becomes personally interested in the contents of the conversation. He becomes convinced that the recording, if he turns it in and collects his hefty fee, will lead to murder.  What should he do?
The plot sets up a dilemma that could describe quite a bit of American history for the past 40 years - Harry can prosper through the questionable use of technology (and quite possibly at the expense of some lives), or he can Do The Right Thing at potentially great expense to himself.
As a Roman Catholic, he needs to rid himself of guilt and seek redemption.  But as an ordinary man, shell-shocked by accelerating technological and moral change, he possesses an equally strong desire to withdraw.
The irony only comes clear in the celebrated twist ending, which exists not simply to provide a clever plot device, but to underline a powerful moral argument.  It would be easy to say that argument is about privacy, or technology, or the abuse of power.  Easy but only partly true.
What The Conversation really argues is the folly of trying to intervene in a situation one does not fully comprehend.  In this respect, it echoes America's involvement in Vietnam.
In the years since, much of America has become even more detached, cynical, and withdrawn; more Harry Caul-like than ever.  The moral dilemmas we face now are even more daunting (what to do about teen violence, for example).  And the stakes of intervening without fully understanding are even greater.
In this way, The Conversation is even more relevant now than when it was released.",987033600,6,2747,4.864806866952789
1264597,4,B00003CX9I,"The Conversation is an excellent movie. It combines a lot of suspense with a good story line that just doesn't stop.  Gene Hackman plays a surveillance expert, best in his field, in the throws of insanity. When a routine recording of two people in a park seem just a little too strange, Hackman who normally takes a disinterested stand in his work begins to read into it. He starts listening to the recordings and avoids the client. Already paranoid and living a reclusive life, his sanity begins to crumble as the tapes contents, the people, and the conversation play on his psyche. He begins to doubt everyone he meets and the entire movie takes a ""Rear Window"" type of feel.  I definately recomend this to anyone who likes nail chewing, high suspense without the corny dialog movies.  A lot of the movie will have you on the edge of your seat and there won't be a sound! Definately a great movie, even for the 70's!",983664000,,918,4.551515151515152

1264599,5,B00003CX9I,"The plot and charcters have been well described elsewhere, so I won't recount them here. Perhaps because I first watched (and rewatched, and re-rewatched) this film when I was 12 (I would see whatever movie the neighborhood theater was playing), the plot has an air of inevitability for me now. My current perspective is that far from possessing a ""twist"", the surprise in store for Harry Caul is one demanded by his personality, by his life. He realizes that he has become precisely what he proudly aspired to become: simply a tool, a lifeless extension of his fancy directional mikes, synchronized reel-to-reels, and homemade frequency filters--he is a vending machine that accepts envelopes of cash, and ejects high-quality tapes of anyone's most private conversations. As we see his character built piece by hollow, empty piece, the thin feeble ghost of what is left of his humanity emerges defiant, but ultimately impotent--he has been too ""good"" at what he does. His supercooled technician's distance cannot stably coexist with the white-hot emotional nature of his product, and his walls (literally, in the end) are torn down. As he unfolds his puzzle, he finds his paranoia has been grossly misplaced, and what he sees as emotional detachment is simply a profound naivete causing him to both lose and fatally misinterpret his own excellent recordings.
But despite all this plot/character talk, I think this film has even more to offer at other levels. This is a movie that, as the title implies, repeatedly insists we ""watch"" with our ears. The sound is ostensibly hardcore realism (apart from a beautiful but minimalist piano score, and the occasional tension-emphasizing dark roars of white noise), but since the main character is basically a sound technician, the ""realism"" transforms into a montage of repetitive loops and rewinds, reverbed replays and frequency modulations insanely (and, it seems, annoyingly for some viewers) cavorting against a backdrop of everyday urban noises. And, of course, being a Coppola movie, the movie contains sublime photography and imagery: the scene where Caul is in a phonebooth, arranging delivery of the tapes, has him gradually consumed by sharp-edged overlapping planes of reflected city light that reminded me of the fractured bits of conversation he welded together from urban lunchtime hubbub [it is also interesting that, in that shot, the closer we get to him, the less discernable he becomes]; the dim, vast, mostly empty loft where he does his work produces one striking tableau after another (and is clearly symbolic); and the odd translucent raincoat that he wears in all weather underscores his ghostly nature.
Simply put, I love this movie.",982540800,2,2703,5.201834862385321

1264630,5,B00003CX9I,"""The Conversation"" is one of those great little masterpieces of the 1970s that just so happens to be directed by Francis Ford Coppola. ""The Conversation"" tells the tale of Harry Caul, (geniously played by Gene Hackman) a surveillance expert who makes the mistake of getting personally involved in a disturbing assignment. Gene Hackman's performance is so subtle, underplayed, and finely-tuned that it alone makes the film worthwhile. The script is fabulous, with a twist that makes ""The Sixth Sense"" look like kid's stuff.
The DVD of ""The Conversation"" is great. To start off, it has good, animated menus. The theatrical trailer is nice, just for nostalgic purposes. There is also a featurette, ""Close-Up on The Conversation"". It makes for a nice, brief look at the making of the film, and it's fun to see Coppola so young. What really makes this DVD great though, are the two commentary tracks. The first is by the director himself, Francis Ford Coppola. Coppola's commentary is one of the most comprehensive I've ever heard. If you don't appreciate this movie now, you will after you've heard his commentary. The second commentary is by editor Walter Murch, which is also very good, especially if you are specifically interested in the editing process.

1264631,5,B00003CX9I,"Written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, THE CONVERSATION is presented with a featurette, a trailer and two separate commentaries of Francis Coppola and editor Walter Murch. Sound and images are excellent for a 1974 movie.
Gene Hackman is a private spy hired for his ability to record conversations that should have been kept secret. We can imagine that jealous husbands or big corporations are his main clients. The first 15 minutes of THE CONVERSATION are magistral, describing how Gene Hackman, with the help of his assistants, try to record a conversation between Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest who are strolling in a public park.
Gene Hackman is described as a solitary man becoming more and more paranoiac as he tries to recreate the conversation he has recorded through three different microphones. He soon loses his girlfriend and his longtime assistant played by Teri Garr and John Cazale, two Coppola favorite actors, and must confront Robert Duvall and Harrison Ford whom he suspects to plot the murder of Duvall's lovely wife, Cindy Williams.
THE CONVERSATION is a great thriller with suspense and twists as the director adopts the subjective point of view of Gene Hackman, it's also a drama involving a man tortured by his conscience and slowly closing his mind to the world. Gene Hackman recreating the reality by mixing recorded tapes is without a doubt a metaphor of the film director at work but Gene Hackman trying to recreate famous saxophone jazz solos alone in front of his record player is nothing less than one of the most tragic figures a director has ever created on screen.

Hackman's affect is mostly flat and unintersting, and his ""dream sequence"" is laughable.  Much of the film has a cinema verite feel to it, but sometimes we get too much unfiltered reality --  the overly long party sequence at Harry's work lab, for instance.  What's more, I found the ending sequence at the hotel to be murky and unsatisfying.  The film's opening is very well done and makes me wish that the rest of the film had lived up to it.
Are there deep philosophical themes in this film?  Some posters seem to think so, but those posts are much to do about nothing.  This is not a shallow film, but it is not deep either.

The film is an allegory for the Watergate situation that was overtaking the country, with all the taping and eavesdropping of conversations.  Gene Hackman plays Harry Caul who is the best in the business.  One the reasons is his ability to stay detached from the situation.  He had even taped conversations regarding murders, but it never bothered him.  He then for some reason becomes involved in a situation involving a young couple.  We see the normally cool and collected Harry becomes unraveled.  In the end the hunter becomes the hunted and Harry becomes so paranoid that he literally rips up his apartment (even smashing a statue of the Virgin Mother) looking for bugs.

1264637,5,B00003CX9I,"I got sucked into this movie late one night while I was channel surfing.  I saw about 5 seconds of the incredible opening shot of a public sqaure in San Francisco during lunch hour, and I was completely hooked. I stayed up until about 3 a.m. to watch the whole thing, and I have seen it several times since then. I was anxiously awaiting the day it was released on DVD because this has become one of my all time favorite movies.
It's an exmple of how a movie can give you tension, a great story and depth of character with a relatively simple plot, small wonderful cast and no special effects.  This is brilliant storytelling and every detail is as good as it gets, right down to the haunting score.
Without a doubt, this is Gene Hackman's best work of his career; he manages to embody conflicting emotions and subtle nuances of his character, Harry Caul, a top notch (and famous) surveillance specialist.  Harry has the seemingly impossible job of recording a conversation between two people walking through a public square suring a busy lunchour, without the use of ""bugs"" on the subjects, but he pulls it off.  And it seems like a simple task, just record the conversation, turn in the tapes and get paid.  But something about the couple he's recording and the meaning behind their words haunts Harry, and he's faced with the grim reminder of a past job that went terribly wrong.  He's completely paranoid about every facet of his life, but he's especially fearful of repeating the same mistakes.
The film has a wonderfully voyeuristic feel without the use of or need for a handheld camera or shakey photography. And despite the look of the film capturing the era of the early/mid 70s, nothing about this seems in the least bit dated, and I think that is the true mark of a classic.  The dialogue is still natural and interesting and utterly human.  And though the technology of the film may be outdated, the underlying themes and paranoia are not.
I love Coppola's films, but I doubt if he will ever make another masterpiece like this.  He also had a terrific eye for young talent, casting people like Harrison Ford and Terri Garr in small but pivotal supporting roles where you could really see that they had so much talent to develop.
It's not a chick flick or a guy flick, it's a simply brilliant, timeless, subtly thrilling and thought-provoking film.
The DVD doesn't offer much in the way of extras; pretty much just a brief behind the scenes documentary that was done in the 70s, so it has a kind of cool nostalia about it.  But you don't buy a movie like this on DVD for the extras. You buy it because you love it and you want the best picture and sound you can get.
I also have to add that I couldn't help but notice that there is something about Gene Hackman, especially the age he's at in this film, that reminds me of Russell Crowe.  Something about the quiet intensity and that sense of tumultuous emotions roiling just beneath the surface but never really getting a chance to blow.  Few actors can become or create such a quirky, odd and interesting character while maintaining true humanity and a sense of vulnerability and strength simultaneously.  I think Crowe came close to that in The Insider, another brilliant movie and another brilliant and subtle performance.  In a lot of ways I see major similarities between the character of Jeffrey Wigand in The Insider and Harry Caul in The Conversation.  Maybe someday Russell will be fortunate enough to do a film like The Conversation.  I don't think anyone else could have played Harry Caul except for Gene Hackman, no matter when the film was made.
It's just one of those rare moments where an actor and the character are made for one another.",977270400,3,3714,4.6045454545454545
1264638,5,B00003CX9I,"Some films exist solely as mindless entertainment; juggling noise, color, and state of the art effects in order to provide a few hours of harmless distraction. Others, plot-heavy and overly reliant on incident and contrivance, keep the audience guessing with last-minute revelations and wild reversals of fortune. However, as a lasting form of cinema, the ""film of ideas"" -- vague, ambiguous, subtle in form and execution -- leaves an impression that is not easily dismissed. ""The Conversation,"" a cinematic highlight of the greatest of all film decades (the 1970s), boldly explores ideas not as engines to drive the plot forward, but rather as valuable pursuits in their own right; challenges to the viewer to consider unfamiliar philosophical questions and possibilities.
Coppola's genius in this film is to provide a skeleton plot (surveillance expert hears something disturbing on a tape, pursues the ""truth"" behind the mystery) while emphasizing character insight and social examination. The idea, strongly felt, is paranoia -- the crippling, consuming inability to connect with other human beings or an external reality out of fear and, at bottom, a misanthropic distrust of mankind. Harry Caul (an understated, stunning Gene Hackman), the central focus of Coppola's disturbing vision, strains for a near-impossible level of detachment from his work, much to the chagrin (and frustration) of his co-workers. Several attempt conversation, but Caul is the epitome of professionalism (""All I care about is getting a big, fat recording"").
He claims that he is above listening to the subjects of his surveillance, but a new assignment brings about unfamiliar guilt (largely because he is reminded of a previous case where his work indirectly caused the deaths of several people). He continually reminds himself (and others) that he is not responsible for the harm that might come to others (after all, he does his work, exchanges it for cash, and moves on to the next assignment), but deep in his mind (and conscience), he knows all-too-well how invasions of privacy stimulate rage, revenge, and often end in violence.
Given that this film was released in 1974 (just as Watergate was winding down toward Nixon's resignation), it no doubt stimulated comparisons to that real-life event. However, rather than remaining a dated curiosity, the film serves as a frightening metaphor for our own age; a time of media saturation, corporate hegemony, and the sanctification of hedonism. Given such an environment, privacy vanishes not only as a reality, but also as an ideal. We are, as stated in ""Rear Window,"" a race of peeping toms, fascinated by personal revelation and heretofore behind-the-scenes activity. From sexual interaction to bathroom behavior, few things are kept secret, largely out of our desire to ""expose"" and destroy (which acts as a leveling effect). Coppola's ability to foresee the ubiquity of surveillance cameras (at work, in stores, schools, and parking lots), wire-taps (Linda Tripp, anyone?) and private investigators speaks to his understanding of human nature. We are a nation of confession and unwarranted revelation; reveling in our release of dirty secrets and self-serving detail.
Still, ""The Conversation"" resonates today because it reveals an essential truth about American life -- we simply do not trust each other. Either out of cynicism or solipsistic arrogance (we do not believe we can or should ever know the reality of another), Americans increasingly seek refuge from input and interaction. This is an interesting turn of events given our obsession with revelation, but it does in fact exist, contradictions and all. Harry Caul, so full of paranoia that he is content to pursue sexual relationships of absolute anonymity (even his ""girlfriend"" is a stranger), is our Everyman. Hypocritical in that he insists on personal privacy while investigating others; self-righteous in that he insists on moral absolution and detachment despite criminal behavior; and sufficiently dehumanized to live in a barren wasteland of humorless avoidance (he has the pleasure of a saxophone, yet his apartment is nothing more than a holding cell). He has taken disconnection to its frightening, logical conclusion: besieged by loneliness, any human contact we desire must be surreptitiously acquired -- without risk, without confrontation, and ultimately without meaning.",975628800,10,4388,5.416666666666667

Harry Caul(Gene  Hackman), as an introverted surveillance guru - who 'happens' upon a bit of  a conversation, and is so obsessed with the consequences of his actions, is  driven to near madness with trying to undo or stop what he may - or may  have not done.

1264682,5,B00003CX9I,"Francis Ford Coppola made four masterpieces in a row in the 70's beginning with ""The Godfather"". The film was followed by ""The Conversation"", one of the best films of the decade. It was nominated  for the Best Picture Oscar and lost to ""The Godfather Part II"".
The film stars Gene Hackman as Harry Caul, a surveillance expert from  San Francisco. One day, he records a conversation between two lovers which  ends with the crucial words: ""He would kill us if he could"".  Since Harry Caul doesn't know the whole background of these words, he  fataly misinterpretes them. The film shows in a subtle and fascinating way  that everything small is linked with a larger whole and things depend on  each other more than we think. Another hint for that is also given during  the conversation of the couple when the man says that when the newspapers  went on strike, many homeless people died because it was too cold and they  didn't have newspapers to cover themselves at night. ""The  Conversation"" also works as a brillaint character study of a man whose  live turned into a great sadness because of his profession. When he returns  home on his birthday, Harry finds a present on the table by the owner of  his appartment, but the only thing that bothers him is how she managed to  get in there. He doesn't want anybody to know much about him, not even his  girlfriend.
Everything in this picture is just perfect. Coppola's  direction and his original screenplay are both fantastic, as is Gene  Hackman in the lead. Another standout is the sound by Walter Murch. Hackman  somewhat reprised this role 24 years later in Tony Scott's ""Enemy of  the state"".",956707200,24,1645,4.705263157894737
1264683,5,B00003CX9I,"Michaelangelo Antonioni's ""Blow up"" is about a photographer not being able to understand wheather a murder had occured or not. Coppola's film is about the same, only here he is a surveilance guy, but in both films (as in De-Palma's ""Blow Out"", a stated take off on  ""Blow Up"") the philosophical question rises: ""Can we count  on our senses to help us grasp what's real and what's not?"". And out  of all three mentioned pictures, Coppola's does it best.",956534400,,452,4.69620253164557
1264684,5,B00003CX9I,"I can't believe there's a review here saying this movie has noending!  It ends perfectly...!  SEE THIS FILM, all you who bang-onabout THE GODFATHER! I can't use too many exclamation marks here, it's simply one of the best American movies of the last 30 years! Visually, aurally, dramatically searing film-making. Hackman caps all he has done before or since(Bat-21!  Surely not..),and that's saying plenty! Yes, it's about surveillance blah blah blah; yes, it anticipated Watergate, but actually it's a masterfully gripping and gutting story about a cripplingly private man being prized out of his shell. I find it pretty emotionally devastating each time I watch it, but also incredibly entertaining just as a labarynthine thriller that I guarantee will take you by surprise! It also has none of the pompousity and sentimentality which , for me, taint so many of Coppola's 'Great' works. Here's your essay title: Harry in THE CONVERSATION and Rick in CASABLANCA share the same dilemma. Discuss. (They both start with a 'C' as well, you know.....)",956448000,3,1047,5.147058823529412
1264685,5,B00003CX9I,"This is a great movie for those who like movies such as Three Days of the Condor, Sneekers or Enemy of the State.  Gene Hackman delivers the goods while losing himself in the process.  There is a study here of modern day  security and feeling that ""Big Brother"" may be watching.  Watch  this film if you have ever had that feeling that what you do or say is for  someone elses eyes.  A really sobering and and sometimes scary reality.",953164800,2,434,4.35
1264686,5,B00003CX9I,"Francis Ford Coppola's other 1974 classic (The Godfather Part II was the other classic). Great story of a moral man deteriorating at an immoral job. Gene Hackman gives a powerfully quiet performance that ranks among his  best. The movie starts a little slow but then we begin to see how the  character evolves and it becomes a fascinating journey. The last scene of  Hackman tearing his appartment apart is among the most powerful scenes ever  filmed. A great picture. Extras: spot the two 'American Graffiti' stars,  and the two 'Godfather' stars. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 9!",952992000,7,591,4.754901960784314
1264687,5,B00003CX9I,"John Cazale (dead of brain cancer)was probably a better actor than Gene Hackman. Gene Hackman is himself a great actor. Not a tough guy like in the movie ""The French Connection"", Gene Hackman proves he can act in  this movie.  This movie needs no special effects because that is the theme  of the movie--the spook-world of surveillance!",952560000,,336,4.859649122807017
1264688,4,B00003CX9I,"Francis Ford Coppola's first picture after The Godfather Part II,  `The Conversation' is a character study in the true sense of the word. A smallish picture set in Coppola's stomping grounds of San Francisco, this  film features  a superior group of character actors, notably Gene Hackman,  John Cazale, Robert Duvall, Alan Garfield (who's always great), Frederick  Forrest, and a bit part by Harrison Ford.
This film came about at a time  when the general public was somewhat under informed as to the widening use  of surveillance techniques in non-government applications, and presents a  dark portrait of a man with limited purview who knowingly stretches himself  far beyond his own capability. This film asks a lot of questions, leaving  many of the answers to your own interpretation or ponderance.
I am not  onto this film with the fervor or superlatives of many, but I do like it,  and recommend it.",950227200,2,907,5.0134228187919465

7917164,4,B00003CX9I,"Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation is a masterclass in brilliant directing. The cinematography is gorgeous and crafty. The acting is so real and subtle. The use of sound is actually genius. The music sets the tone. It's just very slow paced that holds back the excellent story and writing.

Around every corner is a beautiful shot. The scenes are set up so well with unique set pieces and wholly originally locales from empty hotel rooms to a surveillance device convention to a business executive's office. It's all fascinating to look at with every moment.

Gene Hackman delivers the most reserved and calm performance of his career as private investigator Harry Caul. You are constantly wondering what he is thinking. He is relatable in how human the character comes across as with every choice. He is cautious to the point of being paranoid, but he is also amiable around others if quiet. He loves jazz and listening to those around him. Hackman puts on a true display of complex acting with very little dialogue or movement. He's the perfect private investigator in The Conversation.

A young Harrison Ford delivers a highly believable and threatening performance like no other in his career. Another stand out is Hackman's assistant listener Stan played by the funny and quirky John Cazale. Allen Garfield's amazingly underhanded as the Hackman's rival investigator Bernie. Overall, the entire ensemble delivers excellent acting for their respective roles.

The Conversation can boast the most creative use of sound and voice recordings in any movie ever. The use of audio recordings and playback are played with by Coppola going in and out of conversations. Coppola utilizes the technology at his disposal for unique moments of listening in and spying on people. The subtle changes in volume and clarity are intentional and superbly executed. I am fascinated at how Coppola managed to pull of such a clever use of audio to enhance the movie watching experience. Audiences will be confused then enlightened in minutes as you solve the mystery along side Hackman's character.

The music is beautiful piano from composer David Shire. There are long passages of delight piano melodies to liven up the mood, then long stretches of disquieting silence. The suspense is palpable as loud rushes of piano rhythms will soar into hearing with haunting sounds that generate a worrisome atmosphere to The Conversation. The score is excellent and quite memorable too. It really contributes to the suspenseful vibe that The Conversation contains.

The writing and story is a tale of privacy, investigation, wiretapping, ethics, morality, and faith. Coppola's writing is realistic and quite deep. His topics still feel relevant and profound. He makes Hackman's Harry Caul character a man that must listen in and follow people, taping their lives, and risking their lives just for money. This wears heavy on Hackman's mind as he believes himself a man of faith. It is an intriguing take on ethical questions brought up during the course of an investigator's career. You will wonder whether bugging people is worth it too after watching The Conversation.",1525996800,,3148,5.1506849315068495

Most interesting thing about re-watching ""The Conversation"" forty years later is extent to which ""bizarre"" behavior in contemporary society is so pervasive, laws have been changed, giving protection for odd behavior, like in schools or places of employment. Now, the protagonist in the movie is near you every day and it's ""OK"". You must tolerate him or her (unfortunately), because ""weirdos"" are now a ""protected class"".

Yes, it is possible to keep watching The Conversation and dig deeper and find ways to pick it slowly apart until there is nothing left. And as someone who loves The Conversation and who has seen it many, many times over the last 15 years, I find myself slowly seeing those glitches, whether I like it or not. This is one movie that I truly wish I could go back in time and watch it again for the first, second, or maybe third time, just to take it in all over again.
