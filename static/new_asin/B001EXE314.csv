3557857,5,B001EXE314,"This begins with Ray Charles' rendition of America The Beautiful with beautiful scenes of America (purple mountains majesty, fruited plains, and all).  The soundtrack is a mix of music ranging from ragtime, jazz, banjo, etc. - with songs including: Star Spangled Banner, Amazing Grace, Wall Street Rag, etc.  America The Beautiful will leave you feeling patriotic and is a perfect addition to 4th of July festivities.",1229040000,5,417,5.303030303030303

8299801,5,B001EXE314,We play this around the 4th of July as a nice background when we have family/friends over.  This was a great buy at a great price.,1484092800,,130,4.0
8299802,1,B001EXE314,"The video and songs both extremely dis.  I thought that this BD, would start with either the statue of Liberty in New York or San Francisco, then going through our beautiful country east  to west like what I have seen years ago.  The songs should be pleasant to the ears and only in the background.  The scenes on this BD  does not portray beautiful sights in America.  Many singers are terrible.  The old black singer's voice in the first song sounds like duck quack.  If the producer want to emphasize our racial diversity, there are plenty of black singers with mellow  voice.",1464566400,,579,4.598039215686274
8299803,3,B001EXE314,It is what I thought it would be. If you like a lot of music. And a good documentary about this subject. Then this Blu-Ray is for you. It is nothing special. But it fitted what I thought it would be.,1416441600,,199,3.8780487804878048

I have a 55"" Sony TV, a Panasonic BD-player, and I found NO fault with the AUDIO, or the VIDEO.
The music is varied, and the background video is pleasant to watch.
I won't mention what I paid, but the shipping was twice as much!

I'm happy!",1412294400,3,1305,4.296747967479675

8299807,1,B001EXE314,"What an annoying video presentation! The first 3-4 minutes of the film have these breathtaking views of America, and is overlayed - through the ENTIRE song, with some SD video of a concert. Luckily, after this song, the rest of the show seems to be overlay-free.

Don't breath a sigh of relief just yet. Half of the video seems like it is SD upconversions. Several of the shots seem like the cameraman didn't know how to operate a camera - many shots are not white-balanced, leading to some weird coloring in some areas, and on some shots, the camera operator seemed to not know how to properly use an Iris, leading to shots that are either over-exposed or under-exposed. There are quite a few flower shots, but it seems that the camera operators were shooting from a distance, with no tripod, which leads to some vomit-inducing motion-sickness shots.

On the plus side, the music sounds amazing. I paid $5.80 for this disc new, and that is about what its worth. Turn off the video and just listen to the audio.",1313107200,14,1011,4.611111111111111
8299808,5,B001EXE314,"I'm a HUGE fan of blu-ray and this is a great DVD I've added to my collection.  The sound and quality was amazing, and it was very patriotic.  I loved it, and if you like Ray Charles this DVD is something great to have.",1234483200,6,219,3.9545454545454546
8299809,1,B001EXE314,"I received America the Beautiful Blu-ray from Amazon last week and am very disappointed in the video quality.  (Note that I have a high quality front projection and high end audio setup and can reliably judge playback quality.) Several of the clips have what seems to be misconvergence, mainly blue outlines on straight lines - reminds me of misconverged CRT TVs. Some of the video is no better than standard definition. The audio quality is much better, but the poor video quality spoils the overall presentation.  The subject matter is OK, but I find the video overlay of Ray Charles on top of scenery to be downright distracting. It should have been either/or with cross fades.

Bottom line - should have saved my money.",1231027200,17,723,4.814516129032258
