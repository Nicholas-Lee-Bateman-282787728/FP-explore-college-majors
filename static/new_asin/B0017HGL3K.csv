I don't know, but someone posted on Wiki5that she didn't believe in the Holocaust. That's crazy.  Just wanted to discredit her with lies. Grow up please.",1507766400,,266,4.782608695652174

8265944,5,B0017HGL3K,"Excellent information. Chemo kills all the good and bad cells. Chemo kills a persons immune system. We need our immune system to be build up, not tore down, so our body can HEAL. SO many great alternative healing methods and success stories out there - research! This book is a good start to help sort through alternative medicine. Finally, a doctor, saying it like it IS!! :)",1416096000,4,376,4.626865671641791
8265945,1,B0017HGL3K,"This woman's advice has killed many breast cancer patients who choose her alternative therapies as their sole treatment for their disease. She was a doctor (not an oncologist) who embellished her own personal testimonial with breast cancer so she could more effectively peddle her products. I am a doctor as well, and I had stage 2 breast cancer in 4 lymph nodes, BRAC 1. I am here today because I chose surgery, radiation, CMF chemotherapy and tamoxifen treatment. Don't allow yourself to be duped by this woman's promises. IT IS CRAP. She has never proven she ever had metastatic disease, and she refuses to provide documentation to back up her claims. Now I have a  friend who has eschewed conventional breast cancer therapies for this quack's hyped up nonsense, and her cancer is spreading.

 Don't buy this book, and if you do, don't choose it as the sole treatment for your cancer.",1390867200,3,887,4.822368421052632
