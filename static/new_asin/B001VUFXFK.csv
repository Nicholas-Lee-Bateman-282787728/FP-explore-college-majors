8346763,4,B001VUFXFK,"I got this DVD at the library of a community college. It follows the life of several characters and there are reenactments of their discussions with doctors about their experiences. However, they interview real doctors in this film such as Dr. Rollin Gallagher from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. The viewer is informed about causes of depression as well as treatments of depression. There is an overall focus of the medical/biological roots of depression but the film does not leave out emotional problems or spirituality in the matter. People from many different backgrounds are interviewed.",1498521600,,613,5.329896907216495
