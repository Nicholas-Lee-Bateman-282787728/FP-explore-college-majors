8608472,4,B00EQB4LIG,"These DVD's helped me to understand the moves that Tim Larkin talks about in his book ""Survive the Unthinkable.""  The only reason I didn't give five stars was because I would have understood better if he had gone into more detail about each move, explaining what it is specifically that makes the move effective.  I'm not saying he didn't go into more detail, but more than once they moved on to the next move and I wasn't certain about how to be SURE it was going to work.  Now all I need is a practice buddy!  Thank you, Tim Larkin.",1413763200,7,534,4.31

8608475,1,B00EQB4LIG,"Not there.  Too much hubris shown by the instructors (?), specially at the beginning of the DVDs. I still believe that a COLT .45 caliber weapon, with a ""clean"" drop knife, is a much better form of self-defense.",1407974400,4,211,4.552631578947368
