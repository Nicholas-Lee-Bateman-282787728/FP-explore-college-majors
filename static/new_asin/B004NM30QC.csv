Chillogy Parts 1-3
Shocker on Shock Street
Click
The House of No Return
The Haunted House Game

The three-part Chillogy are my favorite episodes from the Goosebumps series, which are not based on any of the books or stories by R.L. Stine, but was based on an original concept.

It stars a young Caterina Scorsone as Jessica, a girl who loves to save her money, and to invest in a ""Sure Thing"", even if it means ripping off Matthew and Todd at their garage sale, or not loaning her brother money to buy their parents an anniversary present.

While searching the attic, she stumbles upon a realistic miniature town. Suddenly, Jessica is zapped into the town, where a strange character named Karl makes her an offer to make a lot of money. Let's just say things go wrong and she ends up dumping the town near the garbage cans.

Matthew and his younger brother come by and pick up the town. They take it home and set it up in their bedroom. After losing his baseball game, Matthew gets zapped into a town where he plays a deadly game of baseball. He barely escapes!

Then, Karl lures young Todd into the town. Matthew and Jessica must return to the miniature town to save Todd.

Erin Wright and her friend Marty are major fans of the Shocker on Shock Street horror movies. Erin's dad makes monsters for the Shocker Movie Studio. They are excited about trying out the new Shocker Studio's Tour Ride, but the monsters come to life.

In Click, Seth is lazy and spends countless hours watching TV. He receives a new futuristic-looking remote in the mail, but the remote doesn't just control the TV, it also controls people. Now he can pause anyone he wants to.

In The House of No Return, Chris is new to town and is desperately wanting to make new friends, even if it means going into a haunted house.

Then in The Haunted House Game, a few kids discover a strange board game in a creepy old house. Once they start playing, they unleash several ghosts.

Both of these episodes are about 22 minutes in length. Kids will enjoy watching them around Halloween!",1346457600,,2103,4.507894736842105
