5040899,5,B006ZL1PA2,They say this move comes out today. How come it's pre order? Did the date realse change? I heard this movie was really funny,1335830400,,124,4.208333333333333
5040900,5,B006ZL1PA2,This movie is wildly original and entertaining.  it is a great spin on the traditional Romantic Comedy Genre. I have been a fan since the Exit Strategy web series and the film picks up right where the series left off. Exit Strategy is non stop Awkward comedy that makes you laugh out loud and cringe at the same time. you really can feel the pain of the main character.  Jameel Saleem is an up and coming actor with a bright future in the business. I look forward to more work from him very soon.,1330300800,7,496,4.26595744680851
5040901,5,B006ZL1PA2,This is a wonderful movie. I laughed and then laughed some more. Having gone through similar circumstances in my life made it all the better. One thing you get by the end is that all love makes you both crazy and stupid. You won't be disappointed seeing this one.,1329955200,2,263,4.387755102040816
5040902,4,B006ZL1PA2,"I followed the web series so I wanted to see the movie & I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed! (I wish the episodes were still online.. they were classics!)  Long story short, I thought the movie was FUNNY! There were times when I thought HHHHWHAT did he/she just say? lol.. I could quote my favorite lines from the movie but I don't want to mess it up for you so I won't. The character Kim was crazy.. crazy to the point where I hope that people aren't like that in real life -- but I'm sure they are.  I would have needed an Exit Strategy too if I dated a guy like Kim.  Kimelia Weathers (Kim) practically convinced me that she is crazy in real life though but I know she's not.  Kevin Hart made a cameo and it was hilarious. His stint in the movie is that classic Kevin Hart humor we all love or if you haven't seen his work before, you'll now love.  And while I know some people would think a cameo isn't enough - it was.  He did his part and I didn't feel like he should have been in the entire film because it wasn't lacking in the laughter department.  Q-Deezy (a radio personality) who played Carvelle is pretty funny as well.  He had some zingers in there.  Jameel Saleem's delivery of James was that sarcastic with a mix of dry humor that I love and to know he and Kimelia Weathers were able to make a movie based off of the webisodes and stay true to the characters is pretty cool.  I like that this movie stays true to what it's about and you could see the characters as your real friends - except for one of the guys in the movie - an annoying high school kid - I wouldn't be his friend.  This is one of those movies that friends will introduce their friends to and they'll thank them later AND it's an independent film done well so it should make you feel good inside when you buy the DVD, cause it's worth it.",1329955200,4,1826,4.129943502824859
5040903,5,B006ZL1PA2,"A few years ago, I met a young man named Jameel Saleem through Facebook and a mutual friend, Chyna Lane, who worked with my daughter, Amina Robinson on Precious. He reminded me so much of my youngest son with his deep set in eyes and heavy eyebrows, and his first name was actually spelled identically as my oldest son's middle name.

He was gracious enough to accept my friend request and then I began to see all of the great things this fine young man was doing; not the least of which was an enormously funny web series of vignettes, delightfully rendered takes on an un-romantic relationship with his girlfriend, called, ""Exit Strategy.""

I couldn't get enough of them and would watch them over and over, laughing hysterically each time. Now this is important: If you can watch something over and over and laugh hysterically as though it is the first time you are seeing it, IT'S GOOD, IT HAS STAYING POWER, IT IS A CLASSIC IN THE MAKING.

Over time, I had the same pleasure to meet Kimelia Weathers through Facebook; a dynamo, adorable and funny. Both of these young people are bright, shining new stars on the horizon, enormously talented. I asked Jameel and Kimelia when and if Exit Strategy would ever become a movie, because I knew it would be good as a full length feature. They said they were working on it.

...and voila!

Exit Strategy the movie premiered in theatres in the Philadelphia area on February 10th, 2012, and I was honored enough to meet them when I got to the theater. Not only was the movie very well written, but it was even funnier, and the characters played by Jameel and Kimelia were extremely convincing as ""the psycho girlfriend,"" and the ""battered non-boyfriend."" The premise was hilarious: who wouldn't want to move in with a girl you only knew for three months, but not want to be in a relationship with, because you're getting evicted from your apartment -- right away.

Although he tried unsuccessfully to move in with his friends and coworkers, he wound up with Kim in her pink place. And the fun begins there, and doesn't stop. The closeups on the characters' faces allows you to feel each and every moment of their experiences and that is superb acting in my view.

This movie is a must see, a must buy, and will be a definite ""enjoy."" I know I did. In a word, LOVED.",1329868800,10,2308,4.5603864734299515
5040944,1,B006ZL1PA2,"Terrible plot, was funny at times so it had its moments but overall it was like a bad lifetime movie.",1437523200,,101,4.1
5040945,4,B006ZL1PA2,"Very interesting, funny and well acted by all. Probably more than a few people have been in this situation FOR REAL. It held my attention through the entire movie, it's not really outstanding but a really good movie just the same, I liked it.",1435622400,,242,4.5227272727272725

5040952,2,B006ZL1PA2,"The movie was boring and the storyline moved slowly.  Kevin Hart was listed on the cover of the DVD as if he had a major role, but made a disappointing cameo appearance.  I would not reccomend this movie.  I gave it away after watching it.",1376956800,,239,4.266666666666667
5040953,4,B006ZL1PA2,"This movie, although, low budget, was very funny. The main character's attempt to live with a woman that he was no longer interested in dating was not new, but funny. The concept has been used before, but here we see a series of mis-steps and bad timing in trying to break the news to  her. Kevin Hart's role was unnecessary. It was forced and the excessive profanity was not needed. This movie didn't need him as a headliner, he had all of 20 lines and 15 of the 20 were profane.",1359504000,,480,4.274725274725275
5040974,1,B006ZL1PA2,"It is sad, sad, indeed, the not-so-hidden message within this ""black"" movie.

Within the first 5 minutes of the movie, there's a blond white female ""best friend"" of two black males -- who of course, she is all sweetness and light, the proverbial ""light"" meaning must be white. This has become a commonly sickening theme wherever black males are featured, be it movies, TV shows, reality shows, or TV commericals: the white female best buddy aka ""the perfect potential partner.""

Which leads to the next scene of the brown-skinned ""Sapphire"" black female who his other friends dislike, and who apparently even her black male partner dislikes. (So why is he with her???)

It's the typical black-demeaning contrast between the sweet and lovable white female VS the mean and ill-tempered brown skinned black female.

Her black male partner, of course, is her obviously reluctant lover(?), because, after all what self-respecting black male wants to be with a black female when he can and should be with a white one?

Needless to say, those first five minutes killed my desire to see the rest, so I promptly hit the EJECT DVD button, and will return it to the video rental store and beg for my $2 back and tell them they should be paying ME to watch this trash.

What is sad is so many black females do not see OR seem to care about these demeaning images. The point is not that there aren't some disagreeable black females, the point is we seldom see any images of brown and dark skinned black females in movies and TV shows who ARE lovable.

Sisters, you really need to get on your game, put on your thinking caps, and stop supporting these images. Brothers also need to stop buying into these images. If you don't recognize the Hollywood game, it's DIVIDE AND CONQUER.

Check out the books, ""Black Love is a Revolutionary Act""  and ""The Interracial Con Game."" You will see movies like this in a different light -- and will no longer allow them to see the light of day or night inside your TV set!",1358985600,,1994,4.626062322946176
5040975,3,B006ZL1PA2,This was a very boring movie. I just could not get into it at all. It was too slow flowing.,1357603200,,91,3.6
5040976,1,B006ZL1PA2,"This was the worst movie I have ever spent money on.  I delete immediately after watching it.  It was just dumb dumb dumb!!!!!!!!!!! I wish I could have gotten my money back right away. I didn't want to give it a 1 star, but the rating wouldn't let move unless I rated it. I wish I give this movie a minus --------",1346544000,,314,4.048387096774194
5040977,2,B006ZL1PA2,OK......these  actors are C grade actors... like the ones you see in soap operas and old navy commercials. Well they certainly looked the part. Some comical WTF moments. Like the 60 second cameo KEVIN HART part where he advised the guy to take a $#it in the bacon to end the relationship.  But unfortunately since the acting is subpar..it leaves you wondering...what if meagan good played the skinny chicks role?(for some silly reason I would like to see more of that cute skinny chick in the future...hope she takes acting lessons!) What if Kevin was in the movie for 20 minutes?  Then it wouldve been a great movie. These guys should stick to secondary roles such as (screaming lady #1) or (guy behind counter in Mcdonalds commercial.) Or remain a key grip. Or Maybe be the assistant to the assistant director!  Leave the big  on screen stuff to the REAL PROFESIONALS. It deserves one star...I wanna give it THREE but in all fairness I'll give it two.,1346025600,,953,4.682634730538922
5040978,1,B006ZL1PA2,"This movie was truly awful. Don't waste your MONEY! I would of rated it a 0 but 0 wasn't an option. Kevin Hart makes a cameo appearance, which is approximately 1 minute. The story line and the acting were very poor.",1342828800,,215,4.2682926829268295
5040979,1,B006ZL1PA2,"I could not believe how I wasted my money on this movie.
This should have stayed in the underground.
Horrible. No storyline. Movie didn't make sense and it keep running on and on and on.
I feel asleep so many times it made no sense at all.",1342742400,,239,4.1063829787234045
5040980,1,B006ZL1PA2,"I rented this movie when I saw that Kevin Hart was in it...I thought it was going to be super funny.  The movie wasn't funny, and Kevin Hart is in this movie for approximately 60 seconds...only a small portion of a small scene.  THe only funny thing about this movie is the crazy girlfriend will all the pink in the apartment and the meltdown she has while (spoiler alert) her boyfriend tries (unsuccessfully) to break up with her.  This is not a good movie.",1341532800,,458,4.428571428571429
5040981,3,B006ZL1PA2,"James (Jameel Saleem) spends all his money attempting to impress his new girlfriend of 3 months. By all, I mean rent money. He gets evicted and moves in with her and they haven't consummated the relationship as yet. After moving in, James realizes that Kim (Kimelia Weathers) is not what he wants in life. She loves the color pink, enjoys eating healthy, and has born again virginity. What he wants to do is to live in her home and sleep on her couch while not being her boyfriend, i.e. friends without benefits.

James consults with various friends who make fun of his inane situation. The whole problem with the film is that his situation crosses the threshold and is idiotic. For this type of situation you need an equivalent over the top layer of cheese. Rather than do this, the film layers it with stale humor. The movie had a few good scenes, unfortunately it had too many scenes that didn't work.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs or nudity. Adult language, adult talk, couple having loud sex behind closed door.",1339891200,3,1014,4.659217877094972
5040982,1,B006ZL1PA2,"Horrible script and acting - don't waste your money or time.  Kevin Hart was in the movie for about 1 minute and delivered the only good scene.  The two supporting actors were good, but the movie was awful.",1339545600,4,206,4.394736842105263
5040983,1,B006ZL1PA2,"We tried to like this one and kept watching it, but it never really came to life. We didn't think it was funny and it seemed to just drone on. Could not watch to the end. Don't waste the rental fee.",1339372800,,198,3.8536585365853657
