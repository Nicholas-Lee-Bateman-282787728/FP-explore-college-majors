7295287,3,B00ZV3XWY2,"I wish I would've known when I pre-ordered that this was about as useful as me recording the episodes off the TV. There are no special features at all - no deleted scenes, no commentary, not even an insert inside the case. I want to own the set so I would have bought it anyway, but I wish that had been clearer at the pre-order stage.",1441324800,9,335,4.090909090909091
7295288,5,B00ZV3XWY2,"I love this show. The writers for this show are geniuses. Very happy with this set. I saw others complaining about the paid streaming videos containing ads, so I chose the DVD set, which happily has no ads.",1441238400,,206,4.447368421052632

7295305,3,B00ZV3XWY2,"had to make sure this wasn't on burned dvd-r discs (what it looks like) from other reviewers. good show, but season 1-3 dvd sets were made with some thought put into them (i own those too). season 4 has absolutely nothing in it but a simple plain black case background, no menus, nothing. and the 3 discs are all cheaply fast printed. you can flip them over and see for yourself. hope the shows all work, and don't skip haha!",1458345600,2,425,4.325
7295306,5,B00ZV3XWY2,"This is a must have for any true fan of New Girl, or even if you don't follow the show, & just want to feel warm and fuzzy with a few good laughs.
Such a great cast playing fantastic characters you'd wanna hangout with. If you're single OR in a relationship, order a pizza to be delivered & kickback and watch some New Girl Season 4 :).",1457481600,,336,4.029850746268656

7295308,1,B00ZV3XWY2,"I was very excited to watch Season 4 of New Girl and got through the first disc with no problem! However, when I put in the second and third disc they both did not work. They both keep ""loading"" and then fail like there is nothing on the discs, they won't even attempt to start playing. Really disappointed in the product, I know I bought it ""used"" but it stated ""very good"" condition and it clearly is not.",1454198400,2,407,4.230769230769231

7295312,1,B00ZV3XWY2,Great show as ever but it's terrible that it's on dvd-r s. No subtitle let alone extras. I would not have bought this had i known this was the case. This way of selling $30 dvd sets is shameful.,1452384000,,194,4.0
7295313,4,B00ZV3XWY2,"Not bad at all, but since there are no subtitles, it is a bit hard to watch at night, since you notice that they do mumble a bit at times. Otherwise it is a really good series.",1451174400,,176,3.7837837837837838
7295314,1,B00ZV3XWY2,"If I could give it less stars I would. Disks didn't read in any type of player. If these other comments are true about them being ""burned"" then I won't be buying the season at all.",1450396800,,180,4.027777777777778
7295315,5,B00ZV3XWY2,Four seasons in this remains one of my favorite shows. Season finale was one of my favorite episodes of all time. For some reason the disk one didn't work in the first set I received. I was quickly sent a new set to replace it.,1448755200,,227,4.066666666666666
7295316,5,B00ZV3XWY2,"Another great season! It's sad that nobody bought seasons 1-3 so now it's come to this where it's burned upon order, but non the less, still happy that they put this out for purchase.",1448668800,,183,4.411764705882353

7295326,3,B00ZV3XWY2,"The show is AMAZING.... the best season so far. So So funny. I was so excited to get it, and when I opened it up a huge scratch was on the first disc. :( I tried it and it skipped of course so I had to return. The return process was easy and I got a replacement in about a week. My replacement works, but no DVD extras are a disappointment.",1444953600,,340,3.8028169014084505
7295327,4,B00ZV3XWY2,Love the show with its amazing writing and cast. I feel fox dropped the ball yet again on one of its top shows. Having a DVD set that is just burnt copies and on top of that no special features to speak of not even sup titles I feel lets the fans down.,1444089600,,252,3.7735849056603774

7295332,5,B00ZV3XWY2,New Girl is my favorite tv show and I was very pleased Amazon was the only place i can purchase it as it was a manufactured on demand product. The video and audio transfer is top notch. Extremely happy!,1442448000,,202,4.205128205128205
7295333,5,B00ZV3XWY2,Perfect on time/.,1441929600,,17,5.0
7295334,3,B00ZV3XWY2,"This is absolutely my favorite show ever. A bunch of people my age fumbling through life together? Perfection. The low rating comes from the quality of this set, which is nowhere near the quality of the first three seasons. No special features? Fine, I have google. But not even subtitles??? I watch this show while nursing my infant so I like the subtitle option. New Girl is an amazing show and I LOVE the ending of this season, so I don't regret buying it, but the dvd is so basic that it's a crime to charge $30 for it.",1441929600,11,523,4.292929292929293
7295335,3,B00ZV3XWY2,"Good video quality. But main menu and DVDs lacking anything that resembles the previous seasons. I hate when I have to buy it like this but there's no other choice. For people confused what your getting it lets you know.

This product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media. Amazon.com's standard return policy will apply.",1441670400,,338,5.035714285714286
7295336,3,B00ZV3XWY2,No sub-titles? WTF,1441670400,,18,5.333333333333333
7295337,4,B00ZV3XWY2,"Just to give everyone a heads up, as of writing this review this is only being made on demand. That means you'll get a copy of season 4 burned onto 3 discs when ordered. It sucks that not enough people bought the other 3 seasons that they have to do this, but at least they are putting it out in some format. I've bought other shows before just to have them stop producing DVDs in the middle of seasons and I've ended up never having a way to finish them because they weren't available on streaming either. This is available on streaming at the time of me writing this, but if you're like me and like to continue to collect seasons if you've already started buying them then this isn't a bad deal at all. If the copy you order is like mine it'll be issued in a black case instead of a clear one like the previous seasons and the DVDs will have a basic design with just the information on them. There will be cover art on the outside and the episodes will be listed on the back along with some pictures instead of inside like previous releases. The quality of the actual show is great though. I don't notice a difference between these episodes and the ones on the first 3 season's discs. Overall, definitely worth buying if you don't mind MOD products.",1441584000,16,1251,4.305084745762712
7295338,1,B00ZV3XWY2,Do not purchase this is a bootleg copy of the show.,1441411200,3,51,3.727272727272727

8720941,1,B00ZV3XWY2,"When I place the DVD into the DVD player, the tv screen reads Check Regional code. Why won't the DVDs play?",1527638400,,107,4.142857142857143
8720942,1,B00ZV3XWY2,"Not what I order. Amazon like all companies think the small print is cute. This item is still available other places. I thought i was ordering a manufacture item, instead it is a dvd r on demand. this info needs to be in bold easy to find read at the top of the page.",1524873600,,267,3.962962962962963

8720946,3,B00ZV3XWY2,This DVD is a copy. I was under the impression that it was the original and had I known that wasn't the case I would not have paid the amount of money I paid.  Don't get me wrong the shows are very clear but I just would have liked to know that I was not buying an original DVD.,1496016000,,278,3.711864406779661

8720948,5,B00ZV3XWY2,"Very pleased with this DVD.
Wished it had bonus features and maybe a blu-ray option, but for the price I paid along with my PRIME membership I am not complaining. Very happy and as always I love this show.",1491004800,,205,4.282051282051282
