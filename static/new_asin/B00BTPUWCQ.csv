8573738,3,B00BTPUWCQ,"It has some good tips, but some disappointments as well.  For instance, it shows table work and how to do it, but then when it gets to the field portion of retrieving (off leash) he is telling the dog ""BACK!""  but doesn't show how he got the dog to learn the command in the first place.  I can't ""back"" my dog until she learns the command and he doesn't tell us how to teach it!  Still, there is a lot of good info, so it's worth the money.",1429488000,,440,3.965909090909091

8573740,5,B00BTPUWCQ,"This video was very useful and very well made. The intro to the e-collar, and the steadiness segments were the best. I am new to training a bird dog, and these videos have been extremely helpful. I have read several books on the subject, but the video really cemented the ideas for me. Bob uses dogs in this series that have had minimal to no training to give the viewer an idea of what they will be up against when they start, and then he brings in a trained dog to demonstrate what the final goal should look like. Bob West is the man!",1402012800,,537,4.173076923076923
