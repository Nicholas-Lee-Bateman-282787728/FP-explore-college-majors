1921188,4,B0000D8L1K,"Kate Hudson and Luke Wilson are fabulous in this movie. It's an original story line in which Alex owes some guys money and has 30 days to pay, however, he can only get this money when he turns in his next book. In this case, he hires a stenographer to dictate his book to.
Although this is a pretty typical ""romantic-comedy"" movie, and the outcome is predictable, I loved it. I thought it was pretty funny and the acting was great.",1056067200,,431,4.333333333333333

But none of it came together to make it special. The weak plodding story and the weak characters made this movie a bore. The trailer shows the best parts.
I asked my 16 year old daughter if she would recommend it to her friends, and her response was, ""Only if they didn't have anything else to do...""",1056067200,,461,4.310344827586207

1921191,4,B0000D8L1K,"TRUE LOVE ISN'T ALWAYS BASED ON FICTION. Author Alex (Luke Wilson) has writer's block and is completely broke. On top of that, he owes loan sharks some money, a lot of money. To turn his life around, he has to finish a novel in 30 days (or else...), so he hires a stenographer named Emma (Kate Hudson). Alex has a fine storyline, but this doesn't stop opinionated Emma from challenging his ideas. His fictional story of love seems to mirror things from reality. While the story tries to work itself out, Alex and Emma spend days (and nights) working to finish the book. Soon, we find that the characters in his novel aren't the only ones falling in love...Kate Hudson is fantastic in the film. She gracefully takes on five separate roles throughout the film (Ylva, Elsa, Eldora, Anna, and Emma), which really impressive. Luke Wilson is also likeable and amusing. The creative script continues to grasp while Rob Reiner's direction makes this film a ""When Harry Met Sally..."" for the 21st century. ""Alex & Emma"" has romance and comedy, making it enjoyable with its fun comparisons and interesting artistic views. Reiner brings us a great romantic comedy that holds the audience and proves to be not only likeable, but also respectable. Kate Hudson's portrayal of numerous characters proves she is worthy of any film that comes her way. I suggest you see ""Alex & Emma."" It might surprise you.",1055462400,2,1390,4.795833333333333

1921225,4,B0000D8L1K,"I really enjoy both of the lead players in this film - Kate Hudson and Luke Wilson.  Kat Hudson, a stenographer reluctantly, and I mean, RELUCTANTLY, takes on the job of taking dictation from Luke Wilson so that he has a chance of finishing his latest book in time to get paid and then, in turn, pay off loan sharks who have set their own deadline.  This is the setting for this romantic comedy, or is it romantic tragegy...you decide.

Wilson dictates the story which really is quite funny in places.  Hudson dutifully takes the dictation, and then, eventually starts to comment on the story as it goes along.  Of course the two become interested with each other, and just when things are looking like they might sizzle...well, you have to watch the movie.

I very much enjoy the switching between the real life events in the movie and the depiction of events that happen as they are being dictated.  It's a crack-up when we are viewing the book's story and a re-write happens...cut/splice/redo/etc.  That's pretty creative.

As far as watchability goes...I don't think this is a film that you'd want to have your kids watch, even though it is pretty funny.  It goes over the top in a place or two...

Anyway, I liked it...but not for all viewers...

1921227,1,B0000D8L1K,"There used to be a time when director Rob Reiner had the golden touch when it came to romantic comedies (""RomComs"").  ""When Harry Met Sally..."" is, by all definitions, a classic.  ""The American President"" while somewhat formulaic adds a political edge thanks to writer Aaron Sorokin that makes it rise above the others.  ""Alex & Emma"", however, doesn't even get to first base and is a lifeless imitator following in the shadows of these two other films.

Alex, played by Luke Owen, is an author suffering from writer's block.  If he doesn't break through it and finish his novel in a month and get some badly needed money some unsavory Cuban mobsters intend to feed him to the fishes.  Enter Emma, played by Kate Hudson, as the stenographer he hires to help him get through the book.  She is the ""shoot-from-the-lip"" kind of gal who doesn't have a problem questioning some of Alex's story logic as he blindly feels his way through his novel.  As the novel progresses, there is a sort of ""movie within a movie"" as Alex, Emma, and (unbeknownst to Emma at the time) his ex-girlfriend, Polina (portrayed by Sophie Marceau) play out his story that's set in the early years of the 20th century.

""Alex & Emma"" proceeds predictably: boy and girl clash, boy and girl sleep together, boy and ex-girl get together for brief moment, girl tells boy to get lost, yadda yadda yadda.  You don't need to even watch the movie to know what's going to happen next.  It's as if the writer simply took a ""How to Write a RomCom for Dummies"" book and followed a tired format used by just about everybody else.  Rob Reiner's direction is bland and uninspiring.  The worst part, however, is Luke Owen.  In my opinion he is the worst actor of the current generation, an opinion that I verified when I stumbled upon another outing of his on cable, ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend.""  There is no variety or emotion in any of his work.  He could very well be doing one of his cell phone commercials and you would never know the difference.

If you like predictable romcoms that follow the basic framework, then go get this one.  If you want something more, then go rent either ""When Harry Met Sally..."" and ""The American President"".  Otherwise, this film just isn't worth the time or the effort.",1286928000,,2258,4.628140703517588

1921229,4,B0000D8L1K,"This was a cute movie!  I loved the storyline and how the romance was taking place in his story and real life at the same time.  Very cute story idea, a great addition to my chick flick collection!",1258156800,,197,4.157894736842105

The device to tell the story is interesting (writer and typist share the creative process during 30 days).  In more capable hands, we could be talking about a classic.

1921242,3,B0000D8L1K,"If you're looking to view a great rom com in the vein of ""Kate and Leopold"" ""The Holiday"" or ""You've Got Mail"" by all means, avoid this film. If you're looking for a semi-fun way to spend an hour and a half, look no further. ""Alex and Emma"" is basically a formulatic screenplay with very little improvisation or creativity put directly to screen by very good leads.

1921244,3,B0000D8L1K,"Alex & Emma was a bit of a disappointment considering the presence of Luke Wilson, Kate Holmes and Sophie Marceau among others, though by no means is it a terrible movie.
An up-and-coming author finds himself indebted to Cuban mobsters for 100,000 dollars.  He must come up with the money within a month or else he'll be killed.  His only solution is the completion of his book, which will bring in enough money to settle the debt.  The problem however, is that he's got writer's block and he hasn't even started yet.  He is therefore forced to hire a stenographer to assist him in the writing.  Little does he know that his life is about to change in a big way...
In short, the acting is pretty good (though nothing great), the setting is average, while the dialogues and the plot are below average.
It seems as though the actors/directors/producers got together on a whim and decided, on the spot, to make a quick and easy film for some extra cash/spending money.
Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off, primarily due to the writers.
In a nutshell, it's an ok movie and that's about it; no masterpiece here... 2.5 Stars",1183766400,,1162,4.5673076923076925
1921245,3,B0000D8L1K,"While it is not mentioned much, this film is an obvious remake/rethink of the Holden/Hepburn comedy ""Paris When It Sizzles.""  This is a case of the remake being better than the original.  Audrey Hepburn was always charming, but ""Paris"" is some of her worst, most posy, artificial acting work.

  The strength of the re-write is the re-writes of ""the book"" (film within the film) that give Hudson the chance to do big slapstick characters.  Far from deserving praise as a great actress that she got for this role, these characters were as deep as the wigs, costumes, and huge charicatures, but FUN.  100 actresses could have done it just as well, but she got the part, and she's as good as an SNL skit.

  Wilson is her straight man, and is always convincing in being the messy guy who falls for the girl even though he doesn't know it.  Like ""Paris"" this film relys mainly on the leading lady's charms.  Hudson is adequate.  It would have been wonderful to see someone like the hilarious Jennifer Coolidge, or the brilliant chameleon Catherine O'Hara in this role, THAT would be five stars.  This ain't.",1163376000,,1103,4.677083333333333
1921246,4,B0000D8L1K,"Between the money-thirsty but dazzling Polina (Sophie Marceau) and the pleasant, down-to-earth Anna (Kate Hudson), what should a penniless Adam (Luke Wilson) do? This was the plot about which Alex (Luke Wilson) the author wrote a book in 30 days. His stenographer Emma (Kate Hudson), who liked a book only if the ending pleased her, often protested and steered Alex's story in the right direction.

As the plot of the book materialised, Emma's affection for Alex grew just as Adam's relationship with Anna blossomed in the book. But then Emma gradually suspected that Alex drew on his own experiences in writing and dreaded the threat of Polina, Alex's dream lover, in real life. Moreover, would the book's fruitless ending of the love triangle bear any reflection on Alex's attitude of shunning intimate relationships?

A simple plot this was. All three characters got to play dual characters - in the book and in real life. But Rob Reiner, the director(When Harry met Sally) juggled tactfully between the book's characters and Alex-Emma dialogue, making the development crisp and sharp. He also played a substantial part in the movie. Kate Hudson played superbly as a die-hard romantic - lovable, opined, decisive and non-compromising. The surprise was the dazzling beauty of Sophie Marceau, both in the book's character and as Alex's ex-lover who showed up in the end for a possible reunion. But what held this movie together was the carefully crafted words of the book, sweetened by Luke Wilson's clear and enlightening voice. Surely, the ending was predictable; yet witnessing the birth of a book, from beginning to end, with a rewritten ending somehow injected dynamicism and creative process in the movie. Not a romantic comedy of actions, big emotional ups and downs. Rather it is for those who appreciate romance in subtlety. Quite refreshing.",1153785600,2,1852,5.129139072847682

Me, i don't normally hire before i buy because i choose most of my films with the actors i like in them but when i saw it, i realized it'ss not all that good for some people. Firsty, a man hires a woman to do a book with him for 30 days or if he dosen't get it finished by then he will be in serious trouble. Anyway she and him think in the end of doing a story basedin the days ages ago, a romantic story. Finally when they have done the book, they fall in love with each other. Great romantic film.",1106265600,,677,3.8776978417266186
1921248,3,B0000D8L1K,"If I had to choose just one word to describe this movie, it would be bittersweet. Alex Sheldon, played by Luke Wilson, is a somewhat struggling author. He is young, single, and attractive - but being hounded by the Cuban mob to pay back a loan he foolishly took from them. How anyone can lose $50,000 betting on the dog races is beyond me, but then to find out he also lost an additional $75,000 of his own cash is totally astounding! So the loan sharks want their money, plus interest, totaling $100,000. The only way Alex can procure the cash is to finish his novel.

Suffering from a writer's block on the first sentence, he lies to the loan sharks with baseball bats who have come to give him a friendly reminder. When the lie is discovered, they torch his laptop. Really intelligent criminals we have here... destroy the means of making the money! In desperation Alex requests a stenographer from a company under false pretences, and Emma Dinsmore, portrayed by Kate Hudson, is brought into the picture. Finding the circumstances of her employment to be a complete lie, she is about to leave, but Alex convinces her to stay.

As Alex dictates the novel, Emma adds her two cents constantly, actually helping him with her quirky thoughts and ideas. As the fictional Adam Shipley (Luke Wilson) falls in love with his employer, the beautiful Polina Delacroix (Sophie Marceau), he strings along the ""au pair"" (Kate Hudson) who is a difficult character for Alex to settle on.  At first she is Swedish, then German, and finally, American. The novel takes form and begins to heat up, and so does a growing relationship between writer and stenographer. Spending so much time so tightly connected to one another, it would be difficult not to begin to feel something.

Sadly, the novel and real life begin to echo one another and love may be lost in reality as well as in fiction. The pressure is on, only 30 days to write the novel, from beginning to end. Struggling with personal issues and trying to win over Emma, Alex dances to a fairly predictable plot, however, there are a number of twists that will keep you guessing and wondering.

This script is a brilliant piece of work in my mind. There is so much to be found, both in the blatant and the subtle, one almost has to see it again to catch everything. I found myself laughing a number of times, and almost groaning in sympathy in a few places. As you jump back and forth between the novel's plot and the reality of Alex and Emma, you find yourself caught up in the twists and turns and amazement at how reality mimics fiction, or vice-versa, so closely.

Rob Reiner did a great job of directing, and was perfect in his role as Alex's publisher. The writers all have wonderful senses of humour as this script has proven. This is definitely a romantic comedy that will leave you feeling good!

1921249,3,B0000D8L1K,"You could say ""jejune"".  You could say ""banal"".  I suppose you could even say ""insipid"".  But despite that, I remain charmed by this film. It's a silly, little, romantic comedy that's been done many times before, yet it works again. I've watched it more than once which for me is a true test.  I like to fall asleep with it playing, not because it's inherently dull; rather, because the feelings it provokes are soft, and warm, and pleasant.  I can drift off knowing that all ends well; and really, sometimes that's all I need.",1101600000,3,527,4.5638297872340425
1921263,2,B0000D8L1K,"albeit with an attitude. She's stuck in a way too predictible  formula comedy. All that is left is the particulars. A novelist, Alex is under fire, literally  to produce a novel quickly to get the money to pay off loan sharks who want to kill him. He hires steno, Emma & she  moves almost literally into his life as he begins to crank out a novel; with her critical comments along the way. It is soon obvious that the novel is paralleling their going relationship. Yes, of course, they are falling in love.

The movie flashes between the present day & the 1920's Gatsby-like setting of the novel. The problem is they are all too aware that this is happening. That they know that this is causes the movie to lose much of the charm it could have had if the two stories proceeded with  Emma & Alex blithely ignorant of what was happening. Art imitates life. Or is it life imitates art? I could squeeze 21/2 stars.",1101427200,,910,4.392857142857143
1921264,3,B0000D8L1K,"I am a sucker for romantic comedies despite the predictable endings. I rented this DVD during a rather tedious reading rut and enjoyed it very much. It isn't the best film I've seen by a long shot, but I loved the story of a blocked writer (Luke Wilson) dictating his novel to a sarcastic stenographer (Kate Hudson) after two Cuban loan sharks threaten to kill him if he doesn't pay back $100,000. I didn't like the whole loan shark thing, but the rest of the story is cute. Alex tells the story of a lovesick writer doing whatever is possible to woo a beautiful French woman. Is it all taken from his imagination or from real life? I liked Hudson's portrayal of Emma. Her character's dry humor made me laugh at times. Wilson also does a nice job playing the neurotic Alex. Even though most writers wouldn't let anyone interfere with their writing in real life, it is interesting to see what difference it would make if a regular reader would give an honest take on your work in progress. But, as said earlier, I cannot imagine a writer allowing that to happen, for writers are very sensitive about their work. I also liked that the movie is set in Boston. Anyway, Alex and Emma isn't a major film extravaganza, but it is a wonderful, cute film nevertheless. The DVD itself isn't so special either. It has no extra features to make it memorable. If you're in the bargain for a light romantic comedy, or if you're a romantic comedy enthusiast, I suggest you give Alex and Emma a whirl.",1101081600,2,1484,4.5
1921265,3,B0000D8L1K,"Well for a start ""Alex & Emma"" is a very different movie compared to most of what we are seeing today. It follows a problem Alex Sheldon, an author who has debt, has. He must come up with $100000 by 30 days. Now he meets Emma and makes her a stenographer (after lots of sarcastic comments and so-called seduction). As he dictates and she types they form a story toghether and make objections and alterations from each others advice. This movie has 2 plots one which follows Alex and Emma writing the story and the other follows the story they are coming up with. This movie is original (like nothing you have seen)but may not shine for people as it is very hard to adapt to 2 stories and the story someties includes things that don't need to be included.

1921266,2,B0000D8L1K,"Okay, am I the only one out there who thinks that ""Alex & Emma"" is just a thinly-veiled attempt of a remake of ""Paris When It Sizzles"" starring Audrey Hepburn and Bill Holden????  If so, then everyone out there needs to see ""Paris . . ."" immediately.  Where ""Alex & Emma"" falls short, ""Paris"" truly does Sizzle.  But, hey, when it comes down to it, I seriously doubt if Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson will ever command the screen as Audrey and Bill did.  Yes, ""Alex & Emma"" is kind of cute, kind of corny, but so trite!  If you can't improve on the original, then please, don't even try.

I was pleasantly surprised by its humor and wit, and Wilson and Hudson have a great chemistry together.  Some of the exchanges between their characters reminded me of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan movies (of which I am a big fan).  I am surprised at how many negative reviews it has received here.  While I acknowledge that it is not the greatest film of all-time, it was a very entertaining movie, one I would recommend to any fan of romantic comedies.",1095120000,,531,4.443298969072165
1921268,5,B0000D8L1K,"I liked this movie. I liked the low-key tempo, I liked the easy familiarity of both the actors and their characters, and I liked how their relationship in real life was reflected by the characters in the book. I especially liked that both actors, and their characters were so likable that it was like sitting down for an hour-and-a-half with some old friends and just relaxing.

  This was never meant to be An Officer and a Gentleman or Casablanca. This wasn't a story about histrionics and/or sparks flying. This was meant to be, and is, a story about two people with flaws, who find them to be complimentary. You can see it in the way they immediately fall into an old relationship pattern of taking shots at one another, criticising each other, but not taking it too seriously, rather passing it off as just them being them. You also see it in the way they continue to write or talk to each other as they use the toilet, eat, etc.

  The changing relationship can be most clearly seen (from Alex's viewpoint) in the changing of the characters Kate Hudson plays in the book - from the (pain in the a**) au pair Ylva, to the interested confidant Elsa (both deliberately overacted by Kate to indicate Alex's current vision of her), to the absolutely adorable Anna, the love interest. And, of course Emma is very defensive of these characters throughout, thereby revealing her feelings about Adam/Alex. This is validated in the final scene as Alex/Emma interchange with Adam/Anna, personally and in time.

  Not every movie has to leave you breathless, crying, hyped - whatever. Some, like this one, are just meant to be enjoyed, and leave you relaxed and feeling good. There's no harm in that - I've spent far more time and money for far less return.

  The ultimate message here is that you don't necessarily have to stop chasing your dream, just be sure it's the RIGHT dream.",1090713600,8,1878,4.674772036474164

1921270,2,B0000D8L1K,"""Alex & Emma"" is actually a remake of the 1997 UK-Hungarian film 'The Gambler' starring Michael Gambon and Johdi May.  And the original is about the Russian writer Dostoevskey, and what happened to him while writing the novella of that title.  You should keep this in mind, because ""A & E"" suffers from the wrong-headed judgment of modernizing the setting of the original which was deep in the 19th century.
The story of this romantic comedy is, simply put, ""When Alex meets Emma (or vice virsa)"" directed by Rob Reiner, who knows a few things about this genre.  Alex  (Luke Wilson) is a writer stumbled on the writer's block, and in debt.  He must make money in 30 days, and to do so, he hires a stenographer Emma (Kate Hudson), and attempts to finish writing a novel.
The novel develops, thanks to the unexpected inspiration from Emma.  It is about Adam, a tutor living in the 1920s, who falls in love with a French lady Polina (Sophie Marceau).  From then on, we see two stories one after the other, both influencing each other.
NOW, the good thing about ""A & E"" is that Kate Hudson (who plays five roles in this film) is delightful to see.  Luke Wilson is also good and likable, and they make a couple of man and woman who must fall in love with each other.  And we know it, and welcome it.
BUT the problem is, as I said before, the setting.  In the original ""Gambler"", Dostoevskey had to submit his rights for publishing his novels to the greedy publisher, not his life as depicted here.  No one believes in the central story of ""Alex & Emma"" when it talks about the 30 days limit and being killed.  Think about it.  Some mobsters are after you, and they want the money back.  However, they burn (yes, literally burn) your lap-top PC, which only prevents your scheme of returning money.
That's a too obvious and tactless device on the filmmaker's side to have Alex hire Emma.  And in the original, the stenographer has no other place to go except the writer (it was the 19th century, and women's jobs were quite limited).  In ""Alex and Emma,"" though Emma needs money (she comes by bus, see?), and she knows Alex is broke because of gambling, she still decides to work for him as long as 30 days without being even paid in advance!  And to make matters worse, what Alex writes is not funny at all, but still we are to believe this ""story within story"" is to be a hit to pay back all the debt.  Sorry, but I can't believe it.
""Alex & Emma"" is engaging only when it forgets its plot, which is a poor excuse for bringing the leads together.  And Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson do their jobs quite nicely.  Pity that the characters are empty, and the story unbelievable.  ""When Harry met Sally ..."" are about real people.  The same cannot be said about ""Alex & Emma.""",1088899200,,2764,4.42094861660079
1921271,1,B0000D8L1K,"I wanted to like this movie; honestly I did.  I ignored the horrible film critic reviews and the lack of hype, sure that somewhere in the premise of this movie there would be a glimmer of interest, spark, or maybe even just a little bit of good acting. So... I took a risk and rented this movie.
Bad idea.  Bad, bad idea.  I don't know which I want back more: my $4 rental fee or my two hours.
The only, and I mean only, decent thing about this film is that you get to look at Luke Wilson for an extended period of time.  Enjoy it, because if you make it to the end of the film, even his cuteness may not keep you from hating him for subjecting you to his aversive non-acting for so long.
Kate Hudson is also cute, in the puppy and kitty sense of the word, but she's also utterly forgettable.  One word describes it best: bleh.
Don't get me started about the circa-1920 plot-within-a-plot, which is the only thing that could possibly be worse than the present-day part of the movie.
Of course, this is a romantic comedy, so somebody has to fall in love, but by the time you reach that obvious conclusion, you simply don't care.  Don't worry, the characters don't act like they care either.

What was Rob Reiner thinking? The director of such splendid fare as A Few Good Men, The American President, When Harry Met Sally, The Princess Bride, and This is Spinal Tap appears to have lost his touch--he hasn't made a good film since 1995.
But I blame Jeremy Leven, best known for the dud The Legend of Bagger Vance, for writing this movie in the first place. Who could have possibly thought that a movie about writing a book under threat of death due to gambling debts--and falling in love with your mouthy stenographer--would make for an entertaining movie? (OK, so maybe the premise doesn't sound that bad. The execution is.)
Lines are delivered without any conviction. The mildly humorous convention of changing the appearance of the book's characters to reflect how Wilson is rewriting it works once, maybe twice, but begins to grate by the third try. The denouement is silly--in a very unfunny way--and the ending is both hokey and overblown through one of the most cringe-inducing closing scenes in recent memory.

1921283,5,B0000D8L1K,"I guess humor is subjective because I thought this movie had it in spades.  I found myself laughing often.  I also enjoyed not only the fact that the main character Alex was a writer, but the insight into the creative process and what might be considered metaphors for aspects of the writing life.  An example?  How about Alex's being dangled off a balcony by loan sharks as a metaphor for how it feels to have a deadline looming and have a block in your way?  How about the frustration of being a writer who spends months, maybe years crafting a book from start to finish, carefully arranging the plot sequence, only to have a reader flip to the last page of the book first?  Listen to the commentary if you want more ideas on how the movie is a metaphor for the creative process.  As for Alex's cliches in his writing?  He's blocked, he's on a thiry day timeline, he's got to write something, and cliches are often the first things that come to mind.  It's one of the reason's it often takes a lot of editing to turn a rough draft into a publishable book.  Someone asked if Alex could use a pencil instead of hiring a stenographer.  He could, but he might miss the thirty day deadline because he might have trouble keeping up with his thoughts or making it neat, that is if his handwriting is anything like mine.  Then he'd have to get it typed , and so why not have it typed from the start and dictate it so you don't have to worry about losing track of your thoughts?  In any case, I thought this was a great movie.  Kate Hudson and Luke Wilson had definite chemistry, and that I'd say is probably the most important element of any romantic film.  I was really rooting to get them together, basically from the start.  So do yourself a favor, give Alex and Emma a try.",1085961600,,1771,4.321212121212121
1921284,1,B0000D8L1K,"There are few filmmakers who run as hot-and-cold as Rob Reiner.  When he's cooking on all burners - as with ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""The American President"" - he's been able to create some of the most compleat and satisfying romantic comedies of recent years.  Yet, when the muses have eluded him - as with ""North,"" ""The Sum of Us"" and the appalling ""Alex and Emma"" - Reiner has produced some truly classic stinkers, films so misguided and infamously bad as to make us wonder whether this could indeed be the same man responsible for all these different films.
""Alex and Emma"" steals its premise pretty much intact from ""Paris When it Sizzles,"" that notorious 1964 misfire that probably established a career low for both Audrey Hepburn and William Holden, two of the most likable and attractive performers of their time.  In ""Alex and Emma,"" Luke Wilson portrays a successful fiction writer in hock to some Cuban gamblers who are threatening to kill him if he doesn't pay them from the proceeds from his new - as yet unwritten - novel.  After the thugs burn his computer, Alex hires a stenographer, played by Kate Hudson, to help him complete the new tome in time.  The two, of course, despise each other at first, but as Alex dictates his novel to her, with Emma providing pointed criticism and helping him shape the final product, true love begins to bloom.
As with the recent ""Big Fish,"" the story here runs along parallel tracks, as Wilson and Hudson act out scenes from the work Alex is writing - a cheap dime-store novel set in the scenic 1920's.  The book is so preposterously corny, melodramatic and clichd that we can scarce believe anyone would write such a work, let alone publish it, though we are led to believe that all sorts of people who would know better in real life stand in great awe of both the book and Alex's talents as a writer.  The scenes set in the fictional world he's created, though very pretty to look at, are excruciatingly arch, coy and cloying, poorly acted and even more poorly written.  Wilson and Hudson do little but play dress-up in these scenes, set completely adrift by a humorless script and directionless direction.  The scenes set in ""real"" time are scarcely more palatable, although the actors are at least able to relax a bit and let more of their likeability shine through.

So...in comes cute and perky Emma (Kate Hudson) as a stenographer to take notes for Luke since he apparently doesn't know how to write with a pencil.  The story ends up reflecting Alex's real life, as he falls for Emma but still has feelings for a more glamorous woman.

MY FEEDBACK:
I thought this was an underrated movie.
The humor in the Italian Job (an action flick?!?) was actually better and had more of it, but the parts that were meant to be humorous were funny. Some of the humor people won't catch unless they are listening and looking closely...nice subtle details inlaid within the movie.
This was more of a drama than a comedy which I can see some people not liking it as much since expectations won't be met.
The feelings that develop between the two characters seemed a lot more belieable than any other romantic comedy I can think of over the last year or two.
For those that are writers, they will get an extra enjoyment out of the movie that many viewers might miss or not appreciate.
OVERALL:
It was a very well written flick with sproadic bits of humor and a lot more commentary on people who are challenged in relationships. Even if you aren't a writer this is worth watching at least once.",1079049600,11,1409,4.340909090909091

Not necessarily a statement to knock your socks off, but it pretty much gives you the gist of what the movie is about.
Alex is your typical single guy. His career is at a standstill because of a bad case of writer's block but if he doesn't get his creative juices flowing he can't pay the gambling debts he owes to the two bruisers that rough him up. Enter Emma, a stenographer looking for work, who finds Alex in his apartment, which he advertised as a law office so that he could seem respectable.  She's miffed by his misrepresentation but after a few witty exchanges, she takes the job. Throw in more of their interchanges whilst writing the book that mirrors Alex's real life, show what that mirror looks like in terms of early 20th century (or late 19th?) scenery, costuming, characters, etc. and, bang, you have the makings of a romantic comedy.
I did like ""Alex and Emma"" and felt that Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson did have an on-screen chemistry. However, the movie fell pretty flat for me after awhile.  I chuckled at some of the dialogue and liked when Alex asks the question ""Have you ever done your own laundry?"" and it means more than what you think it does. However, I basically felt like I could have spent an hour and a half doing something else instead.  For me ""Alex and Emma"" is not on my re-watch list.",1078790400,,1388,4.431372549019608

While this movie is enjoyable for fans of the romantic comedy genre, it's lukewarm story won't attract anyone who's not expecting the familiar romantic comedy formula (Boy Gets Girl, Boy Loses Girl...)
The movie is about a guy named Alex (Wilson) who is a writer struggling to write his second book in thirty days so he can pay off the Cuban mafia for his gambling debt. When they trash his computer, he hires a stenographer named Emma (Hudson) to help him out. The movie has it's moments (I especially enjoyed the one where she drops part of the novel in a puddle and re-writes it herself), but it just doens't have the appeal, wit, or sincerity of other romantic comedies-- like Sleepless in Seattle, or even One Fine Day for that matter.
Hudson is the main draw in this movie, and she certainly delivers. She's cute, funny in a not trying to be funny sort of way, and just a great actress, and I'm sorry that this movie wasn't better suited for her talents. Luke Wilson is particulary adorable, though, and I actually felt like I hadn't seen this side of Wilson before in a movie, which I really enjoyed.
I didn't like the fact that this movie went between two stories that were practically the same. Alex's book is acted out throughout the movie, and of course his book is a mirror image of what is going on in his real life, except that it's set on a fake island many many years ago. It was unnecessary to have two like stories-- Rob Reiner should've picked one and went with it.

As a writer, I expected to at least latch onto the portrayal of the creative process in this story. I am also quite an admirer of both Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson. Neither have really had a bad performance in a film I've seen thus far.
By minute 6 (I know because I looked at my DVD counter) I was waiting for the next 90 to pass. It was clear this would be Rob Reiner of the worst ilk: a Nora Ephron-esque slide into hokey, predictable, romantic comedy fare without the charms of Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, or Billy Crystal.
I have to believe Reiner is handing us this piece as the long lost best-seller he never quite accomplished. That is the only explanation for the useless exposition, and grating jumps into the most uninteresting make-believe on film of the last 5 years.
Nothing is funny. Nothing is touching. He manages to take rather gifted comedians Wilson and Hudson, and grind them to a sallow halt. Not even Hudson's best quirks work in this drivel.

I liked this movie, not only because of the acting, but because of the story. In this movie, you don't just get one story, but you get two. Each story has the characters facing problems, but the two stories are also very much the same. I was one of the only people that I know that liked this movie. Every critic trashed it, and it bombed at the box office, which is a surprise because Kate Hudson's movie a few months before, ""How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days,"" was a box office hit. But I liked it, and I'll tell you why.
Let's start with the stories of ""Alex and Emma."" The first story is about Alex Sheldon who is a broke author with a large problem. He owes $100,000 to a couple of Cubans in the mafia because of a gambling debt. The way to get the money is to deliever the copy of his next book to his publisher Wirschafter. His other problem is that he has a strong sickness of writer's block. After the Cubans set his laptop computer on fire, Alex hired Emma, a stenographer, to type up the book as he recites it to her. She decides to help, even after finding out that if he does not have the book finished in thirty days, the Cubans will kill him. As Alex writes the book, Emma has to throw in her comments along the way, and something happens to them that they would least expect... they fall in love. I'm not ruining anything by telling you that, it's common knowledge.
Alex's book is pretty similiar to real life, a factor that writer's like to include in their books. It is about a man named Adam who has come to tutor the children of Polina, a lovely French women who Adam falls madly in love with. The only problem there is that she is poor, and is waiting for her old grandmother to die and leave her the money. Otherwise she will have to marry her suitor John Shaw. Adam tries to find ways to get together with Polina and also becomes attracted to the worker for Polina who changes from Ylva to Elsa to Eldora and finally to Anna. Those four characters are all played by Kate Hudson. The story within a story is clever, and I liked how you could tell what is similar to real life and what isn't, untill you find out EXACTLY what is similar to real life and what isn't. I liked this movie because it had alot of dialouge, and alot of witty lines that are thrown out there. It was a good movie that I recommend to all.

1921320,2,B0000D8L1K,"I really expected a better movie than this, considering the star power involved.  But this one had so many problems.
1)Mob extortion kick-start plot just seemed lazy and sloppy and out-of-place.  It's hard to laugh when the guy seems to be one step away from getting cacked.
2)No chemistry at all between Kate Hudson and Luke Wilson, actors that I otherwise enjoy very much.
3)Sub-par plotline.  One of its ""strengths"" is having Kate Hudson dress up and affect different accents (not well, which I guess is the point) about every five minutes.
4)Seems outdated.  Who really gets someone to type up their manuscripts anymore?  When the mob smashed up Alex's laptop, why didn't he go to a free one at the library?  A cheap one at an Internet cafe?
5)If this an example of Alex's bestselling plot/writing skill, I can't quite understand why the publishing house is not more eager to dump him than harass him into pounding out a new book.
6)Ms. Hudson's hard-to-get little miss gets old fast, as does Mr. Wilson's bumbling author.
Just. . .not good.  Kate Hudson and Luke Wilson both have real comic talent, so they need to find a project worthy of it.",1074729600,2,1148,4.71

1921323,4,B0000D8L1K,"I am a huge Kate Hudson fan so I was so happy to see her in a romantic comedy with Luke Wilson! It's a very interesting and funny movie.
The one drawback was that while it is interesting to have two stories going on with the characters- one being real life, the other being a story Luke's character, Alex made up with actual realities-was that sometimes it could get a little confusing because I think the real life story should have had a little more time to develop.
Kate always delivers fantastic movies so I wasn't surprised at how well and convincing her acting was in this movie.
Luke also did a great job of portraying the character of Alex. Very convincing!
The actors are great, the story is cute, and it's just one of those movies you can sit back and watch and have a good time!
The extras on this DVD were not that great considering there were not very many, but the commentary would be better if Kate Hudson had been in it.

1921326,3,B0000D8L1K,"As a chick flick, it gets 4 stars; as `great theater,' it'd get one star. I'll give it an overall 3.
Author Alex has gambled away most of the advance on his next romance novel and must produce a finished book in 30 days or the Cuban Mafia will drop him off his 4th floor balcony. But he's got writer's block. He hires reluctant court stenographer Emma (Kate Hudson, Goldie Hawn clone and daughter) to type while he creates and dictates. The book, set in maybe the 30s, becomes a metaphor for real life, with, of course, romance between author and steno at the heart of it.
There's no lesson here, no message, nothing deep at all. It's not great theater or great drama. It's just a cute little toss-off movie that my 89yo mother and 50yo sister would both love, a movie you could take your great auntie to.",1073088000,,805,4.373333333333333

1921334,2,B0000D8L1K,"I absolutely love Kate Hudson and always enjoy seeing Luke Wilson, so I really couldn't imagine that this wouldn't be at least a decent film, but somehow or other the filmmakers managed to create a bit of a lemon.  The film even had the extraordinarily beautiful Sophie Marceau.  Nonetheless, I was bored to tears by the halfway point, and I found that in the end I didn't even much care whether the protagonists got together or not.
There are a huge number of really big problems with this film.  For one, take the premise.  A writer needs to produce a manuscript of his next novel in order to receive a $125,000 advance.  I have worked in publishing, and have a friend who writes far more successful than the fictional novelist in this film, and the idea of a writer with only one novel behind him receiving a $125,000 advance is simply preposterous.  So, the movie lost me from the get-go.
Much of the film is told via a gimmick, a gimmick that unfortunately doesn't work.  Luke Wilson plays a novelist who hires stenographer Kate Hudson to help him produce a novel in less than a month so that some criminals to whom he owes a great deal of money won't do exceedingly nasty things to him.  As he dictates, the film narrative becomes that of the book, and in these scenes the hero's (played by Luke Wilson) love interest is played by Sophie Marceau and a secondary female character is played by Kate Hudson.  Of course, during the course of the movie/novel, Hudson gradually supplants Marceau in Wilson's affections.  Predictably, towards the end of the film, the novelist's old flame shows up, who is also played by Marceau.  He is forced to choose between his old girlfriend and his new love interest.  This shifting back and forth is not handled well, and part of the problem is that the story within the story is abominably uninteresting.  The scenes between the novelist and the stenographer are far better, but there is no tension in their relationship except what is lent to it from the novel's story.  Ironically, the stronger part is logically propped up by the weaker part.
Another problem with the movie is that Hudson simply isn't used very well.  Her part is horribly written, with her at several points in the novelistic half of the film playing various kinds of foreign servants, whether Russian or Spanish.  Kate Hudson's greatest strength is her face, which is a magnificent vehicle for expressing emotion and joy.  But disguised as a German servant, she adopts a wig and heavy make up and is barely recognizable as Kate Hudson.
There are a few nice moments in the film, but as a whole, the talents of the three primary performers were simply not used effectively.  I have enjoyed several films by director Rob Reiner in the past, including THIS IS SPINAL TAP, THE SURE THING, THE PRINCESS BRIDE, WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, MISERY, A FEW GOOD MEN, THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT, and THE GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI, but unfortunately I seem as a whole to like his films a bit less with each new project.  Hopefully in his next project he can get back to the comedy that he was so good at earlier in his career.",1063411200,,3112,4.625454545454545
1921335,5,B0000D8L1K,"Movies don't usually have much of an impact on me -- well, the Zapruder Film did, to some degree -- but most often I just go to the theater, eat the popcorn I smuggled in (to avoid horrendous prices) and allow my mind to relax for awhile in the dark.
I fully thought ""Alex and Emma"" would simply be another of those relaxation films for me -- until it reached the ending.  I was absolutely flabbergasted by the quirky, out-of-the-blue turn of events the screenwriters engineered at the conclusing of this delightful comedy.  The plot's wrap-up came so completely out of left field that I gasped audibly in the theater, disturbing everyone around me; it was just so unexpected (unlike the Zapruder Film -- but then again, someone had tipped me off about that one) that I felt as though I'd stumbled into another dimension, the disorientation was just that bad.  Hat's off to the writers for devising such a startlingly unexpected outcome.  When you see this one, you're not going to BELIEVE how it comes out between Alex and Emma.  You're just not going to believe they could ever end such a story in this fashion, especially a love story.
Now, where did Alex find that publisher?  Alex needed his book money in order to pay off a gambling debt, and his writing process went down to the very last day -- but his publisher was somehow able to digest the entire novel, proclaim it a winner, and write the necessary checks within the specified timeframe, THAT VERY DAY.  Was that like realistic or what?",1057017600,,1499,4.612781954887218
1921336,2,B0000D8L1K,"""Alex and Emma"" proves once again that without a good script, a movie has no chance of succeeding. Kate Hudson and Luke Wilson have been effective in the past but here they have a timid,pale wanna be romantic comedy script that even the best and more expereienced screen comedian actors would be hard pressed to turn into something palatable.
Kate Hudson has a couple of good scenes and Wilson continues his performance streak of loop-da-loop, likable characters. But this does not add up to a movie, sorry to say. And Rob Reiner: what were you thinking?",1056585600,,554,4.78125
1921337,4,B0000D8L1K,"After reading the mixed reviews, we were very pleasantly surprised by this movie. Luke Wilson is cast as Alex, a novelist  who is unable to fulfill his contract with his publisher (Rob Reiner) due to writer's block. His task suddenly assumes a great deal of urgency when two enforcers pay him a visit and give him a deadline of thirty days to pay off a gambling debt of $100,000 or be killed. Since they torched his computer during their appearance, he decides to dictate the story to Emma, a stenographer played by Kate Hudson. This also allows him to concentrate on the creative task confronting him, although a fair amount of the comedy involves her commentary on his efforts.
The novel is a 1924 tale involving Adam Shipley (also played by Luke Wilson), an Andover student who takes a summer job tutoring the children of Polina Delacroix (Sophie Marceau). The situation quickly becomes the classic story of a love triangle , with Polina faced with the dilemma of having chosen to marry for money but meanwhile increasing attracted to Adam. As Adam schemes how to become wealthy, his infatuation for Polina keeps him from recognizing his attraction for the various incarnations of her servant (the character keeps morphing as the story is rewritten), so Kate Hudson becomes the Swede Ylva, then the German Elsa, followed by the Spaniard Eldora before ending up as the American Anna. This is all done in a very clever and lighthearted manner.
Meanwhile, the novel's scenes are interspersed with the development of the relationship betwen Alex and Emma during their increasing frantic attempt to meet the Alex's deadline. And not at all surprisingly, their real lives intersect with the plotline of the novel. Emma increasingly wonders if there is a real life Polina? Why is Alex as afraid of commitment as his characters? The cast gives the movie just the right feel, and Rob Reiner does a great job as both producer and director as well as in his small but crucial supporting role. There is enough time for the story to develop, but the various elements of the story aren't stretched out unnecessarily.
This is a very clever, quite funny film. The humor is often low key (as in the instance of the law firm and its partners), rather than the slapstick hilarity that occasions raucous laughter. Thus, when not actually laughing we were almost constantly smiling. The key point is that the story and the techniques that are used to tell it work well in my estimation, rather than seeming to be forced into service to tell the story. I truly enjoyed the multiple roles played by Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson and their various romantic entanglements. It was especially fun to see Ms. Hudson alternate between Emma and her serial incarnations as Ylva, Elsa, Eldora, and Anna. And much to my surprise, the ending was a perfect conclusion to both the novel and the film.",1056585600,16,2865,4.811359026369169
1921338,1,B0000D8L1K,"""Alex & Emma"", the latest failure in the oeuvere of director Rob Reiner's career, is so lacking in any light, charming characters, situations, dialogue, or romance that the movie feels tedious and 2 hours long, even though it is only 96 minutes. I disliked this film so much that I feel compelled to warn people to not see it and waste an hour and a half of their lives they will never get back. The best romantic comedies (Notting Hill, WHMS, SIS, Moonstruck, Amelie, etc.) all have characters we love and care about, clever & honest dialogue and also are truthful about relationships and are really funny. Jeremy Leven's script has got to be one of the most shallow, by-the-numbers romantic comedies ever written. Just sloppy, unfunny writing. Reiner's direction wants to be about the pains of writing and the muse-creator love, but it all is shallow, Hollywood studio back-lot garbage. Kate Hudson, who is truly a good actress, either needs a new agent or be more picky when it comes to picking projects (""How to Lose a Guy..."", another bad movie, at least had SOME laughs). Reiner hasn't made a good picture since ""The American President"" in 1995. Can you imagine this is thet same guy who made ""Stand by Me"", ""The Princess Bride"", ""A Few Good Men"", etc. Reiner actually was a good director once. In fact, this movie is so derivitive & unoriginal that one scene even steals an idea directly from ""Whem Harry Met Sally""! In conclusion, AVOID THIS FILM LIKE THE PLAGUE. There actually is a funny, charming, realistic romantic comedy out there right now you may have heard of called ""Bend it like Beckham"" that actually is funny & well-made. Along with ""From Justin to Kelly"", this is (so far) the worst film of 2003.",1056326400,2,1718,4.710963455149502

The most important thing, however is that it delivers those much needed laughs which is the most important factor in a comedy.  So, for those that are just looking for a evenly paced film, Alex & Emma isn't a bad choice, although if Bend It Like Beckham is playing in your area, see that first.",1056153600,,663,4.2047244094488185
