8591072,2,B000QJHCNI,"Night of the Zombies (Joel M. Reed, 1981)

Like many porn stars, Jamie Gillis has occasionally tried his hand at breaking out into the mainstream film world. With few exceptions (Traci Lords is an obvious case), these attempts are doomed to failure, and so it has always been with Gillis, who goes right back to porn after an attempt or two. His first attempt came in, remarkably, his hundred-fiftieth film, ten years into his career. Gillis' pal, exploitation director Joel M. Reed, had had a modicum of success five years before with grindhouse cult favorite Bloodsucking Freaks, and he wanted to do another horror flick. Gillis signed on, and the rest is history--along with Reed's directorial career, as he never worked behind the camera in Hollywood again. (He has since become a respected fly fishing writer, of all things.) The Nazi zombie subgenre was in the midst of its brief heyday, and so what Reed, who also wrote the script, churned out was a Nazi zombie movie, but I guarantee you it's unlike any Nazi zombie movie you've ever seen, even if you've seen them all.

Gillis plays Nick Monroe, a sort of combination spy, soldier, and detective who's pretty obviously modeled on Elliott Gould's laconic take on Philip Marlowe in The Long Goodbye. Monroe is hired by Dr. Clarence Proud (Inferno's Ryan Hilliard) and Proud's lovely niece Susan (Here Come the Tigers' Samantha Grey, who would never appear onscreen again) to accompany them to Germany, where the doctor hopes to find lost canisters of a toxic gas developed during World War II that may be degrading and putting the entire country in danger. But things are just getting started--it seems a GI who has been listed as missing in action since the war has written a letter home. So not only do Monroe and Proud have to find a gas that could wipe Germany out, but they also have to find a soldier who's been missing thirty years. And yes, to add to things, a joint German-American graves registration team has gone missing in the same area where the gas canisters are supposed to be. The same area has, ever since the war, been plagued by rumors of zombies...

The first problem is that if you're expecting deathless, or even decent, cinema from the guy who directed Bloodsucking Freaks, you're looking at the wrong movie, kids. And while Elliot Gould could pull off a laconic Marlowe (though let's face it, of the Marlowe depictions on film, Gould's is right up there with James Caan's; how can you expect to stand up to Bogey, Dick Powell, and yes, Powers Boothe?) with some semblance of aplomb, Gillis' Nick Monroe looks more like he's sleepwalking when he doesn't look like a porn star trying to play someone who's not a porn star. (And, of course, there's the scene where he's basically playing a porn star.) As a detective, he's a hopeless case, but I assume that was by design; much of the film's humor comes from the fact that every time Monroe gets somewhere, everything goes to pot. The rest of it comes from the script, which in a few places actually does sparkle. Reed shows a humor in this script entirely absent from Bloodsucking Freaks, and really, when it comes right down to it, had the script been given another going-over by someone with a bit more talent and given to a director with a lot more talent, this might have been (for the genre, anyway) a really fun movie. The plot's interesting and the zombies are actually original (and in an entirely different way than Bianchi would take later that year in Nights of Terror). But in Reed's hands, it was destined to be a flop. And it is. The direction is awful, the acting is worse, half the time it looks as if candles were being used in place of spotlights. All in all, a lot of wasted potential. * ",1233964800,3,3737,4.649016641452345
