Some stories were a little too simplistic.",1466899200,,103,6.428571428571429
8582672,5,B00CJN84M2,"I'm a huge fan and I loved seeing the pilot episode. I actually cosplayed Nylon this year and I psyched myself up by watching these dvds.
The case is literally packed with content",1458432000,,179,4.454545454545454
8582673,5,B00CJN84M2,"""PRINCESS KNIGHT"" was an exceptional cartoon series from Japan's Mushi Productions,that was well made,and well written! i watched the series
regularly in 1969-1973 on KGMB-TV's popular ""CHECKERS & POGO"" program,that ran locally on Oahu,Hawaii,and just enjoyed this show! second only to ""SPEED RACER"",which i also watched,,this series,about a girl,pretending to be Prince,was just original and creative! Japanese ""Anime"" became pretty
popular over the decades to follow-but this show,was my personal favorite Anime',and i never grew tired watching it! and after many decades,to see this
animated jewel again,is a pleasant journey back in time,when shows like this,was that great! i don't speak for all viewers and consumers,,but for those who are familiar with this cartoon series,they'll relate and understand,as to how good the show was! i'd recommend this series,to those,who like watching a good fairytale/fantasy,which had a great storytale ending,despite some of the depicted violence,that was common in 60s anime',when other shows like ""KIMBA,THE WHITE LION"", and ""GIGANTOR"",along with ""ASTROBOY"" had also dominated the anime' scene,in its early years! ""PRINCESS KNIGHT""
is a serious must,for die-hard cartoon fans,who know and remember this jewel,which was the finest show of it's kind,ever made!",1433030400,,1303,5.863157894736842
8582674,2,B00CJN84M2,"I bought the two dvds, and unfortunately there is no subtitles in english, as the description of the product says.
The image is very good, as the sound, but I give only two stars because there is no subtitles.if you need it, like me,
beware.",1410912000,,241,4.377777777777778
8582675,4,B00CJN84M2,Better than I expected. The image quality and sound are pretty decent considering the age and source of the material .,1385942400,,118,4.666666666666667
8582676,5,B00CJN84M2,"Back as a teenager I saw the Princess Knight series on public television. In fact, it was my introduction to anime, although I didn't know the term at the time. It began a lifelong enjoyment of the genre. Princess Knight was animated a long time ago, so be warned, no fancy full-motion animation with top-quality artwork. It's really basic stuff, and they took short cuts with movement. Don't get this expecting amazing visuals. With that said, I will also state that the plots are solid. If this series were redone with today's standards, it would really be something. That's one remake I'd actually want to happen. This series is a well-done shoujo anime series with lots of girl empowerment, lots of villainous schemes, some romance, and even a slight linear storyline overall despite being episodic as well. If you can look beyond the limited animation, I think you'll enjoy a well-made product. And RightStuf even took the time to have the masters restored to gorgeous color and definition--kudos to you for as fine a product as you could do. I've watched part 1 twice now and am looking forward to watching part 2. I wish they had made even more episodes. I gave this 5 stars because I'm judging it as a product of its time--and not in comparison with works put out today.",1378166400,,1278,4.709821428571429
8582677,2,B00CJN84M2,"Just wanted to let everyone know that I purchased part 1 directly from the company (Right Stuf) and had to return it as it had no subtitles/closed captioning. I spoke to a customer service rep there who told me that part 2 also will NOT have subtitles even though Amazon's listing for it says that it does...so buyer beware...if you NEED subtitles/closed captioning please verify before you buy. Hope this helps. If you are lucky enough not to need subtitles this is a really enjoyable series. I was really looking forward to this release but, oh well. By the way, I give the series 5 stars but only 2 stars for lack of updating for the disabled.",1377993600,,646,4.52991452991453
