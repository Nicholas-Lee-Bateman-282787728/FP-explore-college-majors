8157831,5,B000KKRFH6,"""The City As Prey"" Stadt als Beute is a poetic film based on staged rehearsals of the play by Ren Pollesch. Three film directors have created three separate stories which show how the work of the actors reflects their reallife situations. The DVD has English subtitles so you can easily follow the story. I think this film provides a rare glimpse of the city of Berlin and contemporary German society and culture. There is an extended scene at the Sony Center which gives you a good idea of what it looks like. Many of the characters in the film are exotic and strange. Unfortunately my DVD player refused to play the last few minutes of the movie. I hate it when that happens! Scheie!",1290729600,,685,4.532258064516129
