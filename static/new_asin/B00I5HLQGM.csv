8639397,5,B00I5HLQGM,"Mikalojus Konstantinas iurlionis (1875-1911) is held in the same reverence by the Lithuanians and Chopin is among the Poles and Sibelius among the Finns. Unlike those composers, his music (and art) are still little known in the West. This film, beautifully filmed and acted, covers the relationship of iurlionis and his wife Sofija Kymantaite (who championed his work long after his untimely passing and made the first catalogue of his musical works), set against Lithuania's efforts to wrest independence from Czarist Russia. iurlionis is played by his great-grandson, the concert pianist Rokas Zubovas, who also produced the film and plays the soundtrack. Filmed entirely on location, this film is clearly a labor of love and a real gem. Don't wait for this one to pop up on Netflix... buy it.",1403481600,4,795,5.123076923076923
