6434128,5,B00KMRPHMM,"Was traveling on Air Emirates and saw bits and pieces of the movie while trying to stay awake en route from Dubai. After seeing key scenes I thought ""I have got to get this movie"". Well, I have it and the movie is great. The acting is very good and the story about cultural/ethnic bigotries
and differences is an intriguing one. The overall message that getting to know someone else, in spite of preconceived notions, can be a powerful
anecdote is uplifting and shows what we are capable of achieving.",1426723200,2,501,4.5777777777777775

6434131,5,B00KMRPHMM,"Truly enjoyed this movie, after having read the book. I was curious to see how they would link it to ""three idiots"" (five point someone), as the two stories are heavily linked in the books. Don't really know if the portrait of Indian cultural differences (between states) is accurate, but it was funny. Made me remember when my mother brags about me (which I hate) with friends and other relatives, and how she almost believed that I should have married a princess",1414108800,6,464,4.670731707317073

6434134,5,B00KMRPHMM,"Love the movie. Both actors did a good job.  I saw at the teathre, and like it so much that decided to buy the DVD . I am a fan of Bollywood movies. Nice story. All the actors were Great. I really recommend it. It is funny, has romance, and lesson for those who still believe on not mix between castes, and different culture background .",1411344000,6,337,4.106060606060606
6434135,4,B00KMRPHMM,"Even though this movie is the typical Bollywood love story, it was still enjoyable to watch and that's partly why I like these movies because I know they're going to be what I expect and love. I think Arjun Kapoor is a great new actor, putting his heart into his work and not just hanging on to the coattails of his family. Alia Bhatt does a nice job also and both of them have terrific chemistry together. This movie thoroughly entertained me, and I recommend it to anyone who likes fun, happy Hindi films.",1410566400,2,507,4.404255319148936

8660138,4,B00KMRPHMM,"Arjun and Alia make a good pair in the movie. It is insightful into the differences of Indian cultures, and follows the book pretty well. The music is good and will not leave you in want of a better beat. Overall I think the film showcases the part after falling in love: work. Usually films are about falling in love and end with reciprocated feelings, and that is only the beginning of 2 states. You get to see the couple grow in devotion to each other by working through problems with each others family. This is the ultimate test to their love. It depicts the sacrifice and compromise of real love.",1440115200,,602,4.4324324324324325
