287896,3,6300268144,"It's really too bad that more people haven't seen or heard of this Neil Simon comedy, because their missing out on one of Simon's best films. This  film in ways is like a sequel to Simon's ""The Out-Of-Towners"".  What would of happened to the two lead characters in that film. Played  wonderfully by Denise and Lemmon had they stood in New York? I think this  is the answer. After Lemmon's ""big lawsuite"" lol, he probably  would have went crazy from the big apple. Wonderful comedy teaming by Jack  Lemmon and Anne Bancroft, I really can't think of anyone else in these  roles! Simon, as always delivers a heartfelt, and extremely funny script  that will please many. Several funny gags make this a must for Simon gags,  and fans of good comedy. A little extra note: Try and spot Syslvester  Stallone and F.Murray Abraham in two brief roles. Top notch Simon!",969321600,6,857,4.653333333333333

288088,5,6300268144,"WARNING:: THIS REVEW IS ABOUT SEVERAL NEIL SIMON MOVIES I LOVE

....If you live in NYC you will adore this movie(second ave) but WHY is it so much money for the DVD???...I love Neil SImon's view of NYC and it's REAL!..but the pairing of Jack and Anne was priceless..maybe I'll spend the 20 bucks??..he loses his job and gets his job in the other Neil Simon movie""The Out of Towners"" with the UTRA hysterical Sandy Dennis!...funny I just thought of that but he decides not to stay in NYC in that movie. This movie has Anne going back to work in her old job..and what the heck does Jack do all day long?..he makes trouble, trouble for the neighbors upstairs, trouble for the noise on their terrace, he is going CRAZY staying home all day long....he's screaming at the traffic from 16 floors up!..it is a total riot...then along comes ""Plaza Suite"" really filmed at the old Plaza Hotel and three stories all involving the stay at the Plaza..THANK GOD WE have that movie on film because it was ripped apart for CONDOS!..and don't forget ""Barefoot in the Park""..I LOVE NEIL SIMON....so back to second ave....the most hilarious line is when they get robbed and Anne is talking to the police ,slowing loosing it like Jack does...policeman asks,""So lady can you explain what happend?..Anne,"" what do you mean what happened? Once we HAD IT AND NOW THEY HAVE IT..they robbed us!"" I am off on the words Mr. Simon but you get the gist!...and then you can't speak about Neil without mentioning Mildred Natwick in ""Barefoot in the Park""...who BTW was nominated for an Oscar and rightly so!.She gives a performance that really overshadows the cast...and the cast is STELLAR..JANE FONDA,ChaRLES BOYER & ROBERT REDFORD...ALL ABOUT LIVING IN NYC AND TAKE NOTE OF ALL THESE MOVIES BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE OUR WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK LIKE YOU SEE IT IN THE FILM...and side note: this park is really a ""potter's field"" and so many bodies were buried there at the beginning of NYC history..there's no signs anywhere..but the Wash Sq Park underwent massive renovation..not the same park....Neil SImon always has NYC as a major backdrop/character in his movies and it's a touch of his that I love..either it be the script, the scenes taken in Was. Sq Park...almost like a tour of NYC without leaving your home!..don't overlook that part of the stories..

Cheers..

I couldn't find it anywhere else except here on amazon so I picked it up right away. How he gets layed off his job to how he handles it. To me I just think it was funny.

288091,5,6300268144,"First of all I am 49 years of age, and not a fan of older movies. I was surprised when it came on TV and I couldn't change the channel. This is a hilarious story of a man (Jack Lemmon) who loses his long held job and then goes batty sitting in his apartment all day with nothing to do. The TV, radio, and neighbors are his only source of stimulation. Everything he sees on TV and hears on the radio become conspiracies against the middle aged white man. Jack obsesses on the neighbors in his building to the point of madness. His wife has to go back to work because he can't find a job. Instead of this being a good thing, it infuriates him that she found work so easily. When home from work, she is made to listen to long stories about how rude and inconsiderate the neighbors are, and all the conspiracies that are out there to get them that she isn't aware of because 'they' don't want them to. She tries to get him to get out of the apartment and focus on something else, but he refuses and therefore becomes increasingly paranoid. She alerts the family that Jack is losing it. The family cracked me up. She also arranges for Jack to see a shrink who unfortunately doesn't listen or offer advice--only hands out pills. The meds space him out and make him even more funny to watch and listen to. You gotta see it, you'll love it. Buy the DVD. The Prisoner of Second Avenue is my favorite comedy of all.",1308096000,2,1405,4.246268656716418
288092,3,6300268144,"No none plays a down and out, nervous, stresssed out character than Jack Lemmon; he was the greatest at that genre. You know the character is headed for a breakdown, but just like the role he played in ""The Out of Towners"", you can't help but give a laugh out loud for the horrible mess he's in or has created for himself. I guess he played the roles that we can all identify with at one time or another and laugh at it all-hey, it beats crying !",1307923200,,446,4.079545454545454
288093,2,6300268144,"While Jack Lemmon's typical neurosis-addled schtick is almost always entertaining, his performance in 'Prisoner' is downright aggravating, mind-bogglingly depressing and decidedly unfunny.

Stress is one thing, wracked frustration for humorous effect another. But his character, Melvin Edison, is in serious need of mental intervention. Not the movie kind, I mean court-ordered supervised therapy. This isn't acid reflux and heart attack anymore - his ranting and raving borders on psychotic homicide or suicide, maybe both.

I was cringing throughout the entire production. This movie honestly hurts to watch. And it's listed as a 'comedy'? For whom? Leather-hooded masochists?

This isn't to say the performances aren't worthy of merit. Anne Bancroft is particularly good as ever-supportive wife, Edna, who sadly ends up sharing her husband's fate. But performances aren't a movie. Somewhere in all that explosive energy there has to be a story; some point, some resolution. I don't get where watching two people being ground into hopeless oblivion qualifies as funny.

Seriously, if we follow the movie's logic, the next scene following the end of the film: The neighbors complaining about ""the awful smell"" coming from apartment unit 14-B.

Not worth the time spent. I'm indebted to the technician/inventor that created the fast-forward button.

A superior version of Jack in a nearly identical, but infinitely funnier and sympathetic performance, check out '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Out-of-Towners/dp/B0000AUHQ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Out-of-Towners</a>' filmed five years earlier. I would hazard a guess that its success was the likely inspiration for this later Neil Simon effort.

Notable for having early screen appearances of F. Murray Abraham and Sylvester Stallone.",1306972800,3,1834,6.030769230769231
288094,2,6300268144,"It's a moving stage play but a disappointing movie. Jack Lemmon gives a one-note performance, playing the same aggrevated character he did in ""The Out-of-Towners."" Anne Bancroft, however, is flawless as his wife. The script is dark comedy, but Lemmon left out most of the comedy and left us with just his angst. Sloppy, hurried direction would be my guess.",1273449600,2,356,4.95
288095,5,6300268144,"We truly enjoyed the movie, ""The Prisoner of Second Avenue"" especially since today's job market is much the same.  Jack Lemmon & Anne Bancroft work wonders.  After all it is a Neil Simon play and with talent like that it's no wonder folks keep inviting themselves over for a movie night.  I wish more of these movies would be made.

288121,3,6300268144,"Neil Simon's work to me runs hot and cold.  This seventies recession era farce was just plain annoying.  Like in the worst Simon efforts the characters either scream at each other or tell jokes.  Sorry, Neil, you're skating on a thin line on someone's nervous breakdown and you didn't pull it off here.  This flick feels claustrophobic, barely transcending it's stage roots.  The redeeming factors here are the performances of Jack Lemmon and Anne Bancroft who manage to imbue humanity into Simon's cartoon characters.  Another plus are the radio announcements interspersed throughout the movie.",1181260800,3,595,5.276595744680851
288122,5,6300268144,I have watched this movie at least 25 times and it is still laugh out loud enjoyable as well emotionally touching.

288123,4,6300268144,"For some reason, probably because I watched this again shortly after Anne Bancroft passed away, and of course watching the always terrific Jack Lemmon at the top of his game (at my current age!)  playing yet another of those wonderful angst driven characters using words created by Neil Simon, for that reason perhaps I was struck by our mortality. This film was made just a few short years ago, and yet all the actors are gone,and they left looking 'old'. My God, where does the time go?

This is not the funniest film you'll see, some of it is sad and human,  but it has moments of comic brilliance. Its eminently watchable thanks to the two main actors and their great talent; its sad, its wistful, its a slice of New York that we  will never see again, and I plan on watching it again soon.

I'm glad its in my collection although it left me with a bit of a lump in my throat. They were just so good, these comic talents, and it was just a few moments ago, wasn't it?",1152316800,14,971,4.284153005464481
288124,5,6300268144,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. It shows the funny side of people only concerned about themselves. You have Jack Lemmon as a recently unemployed adman, and Anne Bancroft as his sympathetic yet let's be practical wife. I feel that this is both thier finest hours in this movie as the chemistry shows that they really enjoyed working with each other. I find Lemmon's character is one who just can't believe that his career is over, and he's nowhere near the age of retirement, and plus he's from the old school where the woman stayed at home while the man goes out, and gets the meat. When Bancroft's character goes to work it causes a breakdown in Lemmon's character as his perfect world continues to crumble making him hostile towards everyone; his family, friends, his wife, the upstairs neighbor(which the arguments between them are simpily hilarious), and Lemmon's own character's desire to get even, and win one for his own glory; so he ends up mugging a man in Central Park (played by Sylvester Stallone)because he thought it was the other way around. Bancroft's character is also becoming unglued by the constant work, and then she's laid off. There's also Lemmon's character's brother who's in love with hearing himself talk about how analytical his thinking is, and don't forget that upstairs neighbor who just wants peace and quiet in his perfect world because he has his own worries to deal with. Filmed in New York City I guess Neil Simon would know what NYC is like from a personal experience which is why this is so funny, and let's not forget the narrator who takes us through the news stories throughout. Should be allowed to come back on the t.v. again, and give America something funny to watch.",1092700800,25,1724,4.730897009966777
288125,5,6300268144,"This is the third in a trio of classic comedies written by Neil Simon and starring(onscreen) Jack Lemmon.  This movie delivers laugh after laugh without slapsick, and without the cheesiness of some of Simon's later works. (The Goodbye Girl)  This movie earns five stars from me not only because it's a great comedy, but this movie gives the viewer a heartfelt lesson in humanity as well.  See it at all costs.  Worth owning, too,  I've all but worn my copy out.",1084492800,8,461,4.6419753086419755
288126,5,6300268144,"This movie is among the greatest twenty american comedies in any age.
Lemmon is superb and the lovely Anne Bancroft(Miracle worker) makes a great couple.
It's incredible how this work has been so underestimated.
A must for everyone.
A lot of laughable gags.",1084406400,6,257,5.0
288127,5,6300268144,"To my way of thinking, this is the highest form of comedy: it is the kind of comedy that makes us laugh and cry at the same time; it is the kind of comedy that captures something about who we are, and presents it in such a forgiving and loving light that we simultaneously laugh and ache. For me, the quintessential example of this is the boxing scene in City Lights, which is as tragic as it is hilarious. ""Prisoner of Second Avenue"" is, in a sense, an entire play about this boxing scene: it is about the struggle to survive in a cold and almost brutal world. The only difference is that, in the boxing scene, the hero chooses to take a beating in order to save someone else, while here the two heroes struggle to survive as a team. In the final scene, we know that this team has won, not because a new job has been located, but because this team will prevail. What a wonderful homage to the strength of the human spirit! Couple this with the exceptional (as always) performances of two great actors: Anne Bancroft and Jack Lemon, and you have what I think is a true gem.
By the way...it's time to bring this in DVD!",1031011200,11,1118,4.253521126760563
