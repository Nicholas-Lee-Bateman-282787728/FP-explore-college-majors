8168550,5,B000MGBP4C,"This movie includes MX race highlights from the late 60's, when the sport first became popular in America, through the mid 90's including the Supercross events when they came into being. The race clips are interlaced with interviews and commentary by the professional racers some years later discussing everything from race strategies and their bikes, to their personal and family challenges. I think it's almost as cool as watching ""On Any Sunday"". If you enjoyed the golden age of dirt bikes (the 70's - 90's) it would be hard not to like this movie. And what about that film clip of the 1997 Los Angeles Supercross with Jeremy McGrath (sporting his usual #1 plate) bouncing over a jump... Freeze it right there for a minute. Yeah, right there. Who's that flag guy just to the right of his foot peg watching the previous turn? Yup, that's me. I had a great view of the race that evening, and they gave me a pair of bright red mechanics gloves and a really cool yellow T shirt. Very cool!",1363910400,,989,4.593220338983051
8168551,4,B000MGBP4C,I bought this for my hubby for Father's day & he really enjoyed it. If you want clips & info on some of the great legends of motocross I recommend this dvd. This dvd is not for someone looking to see current motocross riders. This dvd essentially ends with Mcgrath & Emig. My hubby has been following motocross for 25 years & he saw races & clips that he had never seen before. A great dvd to add to a motocross collection.,1247529600,4,423,4.170731707317073
8168552,5,B000MGBP4C,"I have been following motocross since the late 60s and this documentary DVD is right up there with ""On Any Sunday"" and the ""Motocross Files"" series. Was very enjoyable. A must have for any true MX fan.",1200009600,6,201,4.45945945945946
