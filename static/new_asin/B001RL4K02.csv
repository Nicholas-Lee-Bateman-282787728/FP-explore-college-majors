8338208,1,B001RL4K02,"My 4 year old was scared by the ghost theme in one segment, and in watching it with the kids, there was shocking language content. Words you do not want kids repeating! Like 'Jerk' etc.
Thought this would be mild and sweet like Stuart 1 and 2 movies( which both had real people in them vs. strictly animated). We do not watch the Stuart little 3 movie ( all animated like this video) because of racial stereotyping of the skunk charachter and rude choice of words like 'talk to the butt.'
Would return this video if I could!!",1355097600,2,525,4.36734693877551
