8406150,5,B003UTS85C,"The story of the Haruhi Suzumiya series, which includes this collection (I am so joyful to own after years of waiting) and ""The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya"" film, follows an adolescent male (Kyon) who brings himself to question if he wants to live out a simple life or a life with a tint of dreams that come true. Personally, the theme of this anime series is like the opposite of the theme from Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"". Embrace dreams enough if you have not.

English dubbed audio is included alongside the original audio and subtitles.",1469491200,,550,4.851063829787234
8406151,5,B003UTS85C,"Outstanding series.

If you are having difficulty finding the series on DVD or have been looking for the Blu-ray this is the set to get.
As stated in description even though it is a Japanese release it has the English language dub and subtitles. And being a Japanese release it is the same region code as the USA.
It's the complete series minus the movie (the disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya) which is not part of the series nor the set. I don't believe the special features have been translated, but have not really checked either. Not a deal killer for us either way.

I know it can be bit of a debate about English dubs on anime however this series is very well done. It is hard to recommend a series to people, tastes can vary greatly, however this is a series I'd recommend, we like it so much we've bought the book series on Kindle. However if  are here reading the descriptions you probably already fan and have been hunting for this set.",1467504000,,946,4.425287356321839
8406152,5,B003UTS85C,Full show with high quality presentation and a 3rd bonus disk filled with extras. Amazing and worth it.,1456876800,,103,4.777777777777778
8406153,5,B003UTS85C,"Menus are in Japanese, and the spoken language in Japanese by default. To change it to english, set the option in the bottom left to ""on"". Quality is great and packaging looks amazing, a great piece to any collection.",1421280000,2,217,4.589743589743589
8406154,5,B003UTS85C,"I cried tears of joy upon reciving my Haruhi complete collectors edtion in Blu-Ray. I have a motto, it's (It has to be Blu-Ray or no way) and this is the only Haruhi  collection in Blu-Ray, may I ask why. It has the whole series plus some extra blow your face off goodies so just buy it.",1377561600,4,287,4.035087719298246
8406155,5,B003UTS85C,"The menus are indeed in Japanese, but I don't think it takes away from the experience at all. I am very happy with this box and I think it's the ultimate Haruhi-box set for any hardcore fan!",1371772800,2,190,4.162162162162162
