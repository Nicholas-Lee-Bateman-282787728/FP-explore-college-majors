2315692,4,B0009S4IGA,"Highly recommended DVD. I'd of recommended it as a Christian DVD, except for a stupid needless sex scene in an auto near the beginning of the movie.

Lackawanna blues takes you through caring, love, tolerance, hate, bewilderment, and finally to redemption, caring again, and understanding. Excellent film! I cried during 50 percent of it!

The old black lady 'Nanny' did an extraordinary job in this HBO Special; she deserves an Emmy! Bravo Zulu! And praise be to the Lord Jesus! I can't believe how old Louis Gosset, Jr got so suddenly...",1125100800,3,539,4.912087912087912

Lackawanna Blues tells a story that I observed in my formative years. Growing up in the 1950's was an amazing time.  Everything was still pure and clean, even the hearts, manners and minds of the people.  The backdrop was perfect, the actors and actresses did an amazing job of portraying those folks that didn't believe in handouts, made their own way in life and depended upon each other; no other choice.  The Poignant stories interwoven into the very fabric of the story make it a story were each and every person was dignified and made whole by none other than a woman with a pure heart, pure spirit.  When our two and four year old kids watched to the end without fussing, I knew then that THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE REQUIRED FOR ALL...! ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!

However, Mos Def carries of his performance of an old school Rock n' Roll artist with such  believability that you really feel like you're watching Jackie Wilson or some other top recording star of that era. Each actor brings his/her character to life in a way that makes you feel as though you are actually there as this story unfolds. Perhaps one of the tenants in Nanny Crosby's boarding house.

Fascinating comments from actors and actresses.  Not only a great and entertainng story, based on true life, but some of the best acting I've ever seen.  S.

It contains outstanding acting abilities by the stars, a story that is honest and something that you can relate to.  When I first watched it on cable, I came in during the movie rather than the beginning but it held my interest enough where I knew that I was going to watch over and over.  S. Epatha Merkerson goes beyond acting, I saw her as the main character in dialogue as well as her movements.  Although I have been a fan of her acting abilities in watching her on Law & Order, this movie showed how diverse her skills are.  The cast in general was outstanding.  I could not wait to purchase this movie.  If you have not seen Lackawanna Blues, you owe it to yourself to watch it.

The movie tells the story of a young boy (played by Marcus Carl Franklin) growing up in a rooming house run by Nanny Crosby (played by S. Epatha Merkerson). The acting in the film is wonderful! Marcus Carl Franklin does an excellent job of playing young Ruben Santiago Jr., and S. Epatha Merkerson truly embodies Nanny Crosby, the rooming house owner with a heart of gold, who takes in various people from the margins of society to live in her house, giving them a second chance at life and creating a community.

The residents were just as ""colorful"" as the ones pertrayed in the film.  How many of us growing up in the 50's remember the boarding houses (in our neighborhoods) preventing human beings from living on the streets?  It provided a family for those who had no families.  We won't mention the delicious down-to-earth, home cooked meals made from an important ingredient; L-O-V-E!!!!! If I sniff the air I can almost smell the hot sliced corn bread (baked in a cast ironed skillet) dripping with butter and the peach cobbler fresh from the oven.

I stumbled upon this film quite by accident.  One night there wasn't anything to watch on regular tv and so my next choice was turn to cable and that is when I saw the commercial for the movie - Lackawanna Blues.  The what????? (smile) Then I saw one of our  most incrediable actress  to walk God's green earth -Epatha Merkerson and knew this was something I simply HAD to watch!!!! Through the years  I have been searching  for this film and now in finding it I can add this to my collection.

This film has also paved the way for the world to recognize this is yet another African-American classic.  I agree 300% when it comes to the  brilliant acting and if this film had been relased in the theaters instead of an HBO movie another one of the Oscars would have found a new residence. The rating should be ten stars and not five!

I am very proud of this movie and plan to give this DVD away as gifts.  Without a doubt THIS film will have a special place in my video library.",1295308800,,1707,4.374603174603174

Before the scourges of drugs and ""institutionalized"" racism, there was prejudice with with ways of dealing with it. How? By being an advocate and activist within your own confines. It seems as if S. Epatha Merkerson was born for this role. Besides being the longest working Black Actress/Actor in a television drama (Law & Order), she clearly portrays a modern day '50s & '60s savior of a chosen few of the disadvantaged and downtrodden.

2316653,5,B0009S4IGA,"Being a baby boomer growing up in the early 60s as a person of color, ""Lackawanna Blues"" is note perfect in capturing the sentiment of a time long gone. The most prophetic statement/assessment about those times comes near the end when Reuben Santiago, as a young man off to college, muses about the lost of a significant part of culture for people of color. It was the last time where one could experience the joys and tribulations of a cultured neighborhood. ""For every door that integration opened, another door was closed on the symbiosis of a segregated neighborhood"".
S. Epatha Merkerson more than earns her well deserved ""Best Actress Emmy"", in yet another sterling HBO made for television cinema. She radiates the warmth and grace that the character is based on. Quite simply, I see so much of my childhood in ""Lackawanna Blues"" though on the surface, one would wonder, how?. The ""how"" is again the touching snapshot of a peoples taking care of each other, supporting each other, learning and growing from each other. With ""Momma's role""  being center stage, the viewer can not only see the importance of community that gathers, but, you can almost smell the delicious delicacies being cooked in the boarding house.
The young actor that played Reuben as a child is simply magical. (He gives another knockout performance in ""I'm Not There"" as one of the Dylan characters. Again, I see myself in his role especially in how the love he has for ""Nanna or Momma"", and how she eventually takes care of him, more as a maternal figure than his own, troubled biological mother. Terrence Howard is convincing as the 17 year old junior of Momma's heart. Macy Gray in a small, but, effective role is funny and endearing. These are just a few standout performances in a movie that is filled with them.
There was a house in our neighborhood that was just as transient with a wonderful array of personalities.
George C. Wolfe had recently demonstrated his indisputable talent as a stage director in the Public Theater production of ""Radiant Baby"", a musical about Keith Haring. He is equally adept in directing this wonderful, little gem of a movie.
HBO remains a cut above the competition with their well-made, exclusive movies.",1281744000,,2221,4.844736842105263

The way we so richley dressed, entensly loved, and deeply cared for our culture and race.  And how our parants, love ones, and the elderly were so important and respected.  It also remined me that intergration was one of our biggest downfalls in black history and how we as a people left our unfortunate brothers behind after some of us were able to ""move on up"".

Anyone lucky enough to have had an older matriarch in a family knows what I'm talking about. One can almost feel her warmth and smell her simmering neck bones on the stove.  She brought tears to my eyes--she reminded me so much of what a lot of black American families need--a stabling force to be reckoned with.  Just her uttering the title of my review, ""Babeyy, we gone dance!"" makes me remember the love I had for a great aunt who once had to come to my rescue after witnessing the terror in my eyes upon being approached by a belligerent alcoholic.

2316719,5,B0009S4IGA,"Lackawanna Blues is a fine movie that offers a colorful slice of Black Americana in the late `50s and `60s.  Like most autobiographical films it portrays history less like the way it was than the way the author would like us to think it was.

I was born in Lackawanna only a few blocks from 32 Wasson Street where most of the movie takes place.  My dad worked for the steel plant, as did almost everyone in our family.  My large family of uncles, aunts and cousins lived in neighborhoods not far from Rachel Crosby's boarding house.  By the time the movie's author was a young boy we had become suburbanites living in the mostly white south-town suburbs.

My young parents took my brothers and me to lower Ridge Road almost weekly to buy pastries from a local shop and before recycling became popular would donate old newspapers to help an already dying and decaying community. In Lackawanna in the 1950's the Black and White communities lived and worked side-by-side and were friends with each other.  The mix was about 70% Black and 30% Eastern European blue collar immigrants.  I never really met people who saw a difference in people's skin color until I went away to college.

Lackawanna Blues completely ignores that 32 Wasson was walking distance from the Bethlehem Steel Plants, which spewed acrid yellow filth into the air night and day.  The movie's pristine neighborhood simply wasn't possible.  One of the cars, a yellow and white Buick hardtop, was identical to my dad's car and represented the ideals of white, suburban America.  While he drove that car on our weekly doughnut runs, a Buick is not likely a car like that would have been seen near 32 Wasson.  In that era most people in Lackawanna took the NFT bus to go to work or shopping.  The Black person who had money and wanted to show off would rarely choose anything less than a Cadillac.

Another reality of life in Lackawanna is snow, lots of it.  It is hard to imagine a movie that spans 20 years or more without once showing the extreme hardship Buffalo weather added to an already challenging life.

Period clothes in movies of this type give the viewer one of the clearest pictures of what life was like.  Although Lackawanna was poor and very run down, Black men and women, like their White counterparts, dressed the best they could whenever they were in public.  In Lackawanna, men wore loose-fitting suits and women tended to be a bit more flamboyant.  The movie overdresses the characters to the point of removing a lot of character from them.  The average person simply did not wear such flashy clothing at home, and the nightclub scenes would have us believe that Black Lackawannans were all wealthy socialites.  The average local bar was a far cry from the Hollywood night club-type imagery the movie showed us.

I visited lower Ridge Road in 2006 and agree that the photos used at the end of the movie were accurate, today it looks like Afghanistan after a bombing.  As sad as they are, it is hard to imagine through pictures alone the brutal reality of a community that has long since died.

While some of the characterizations of the movie missed on accuracy, that by no means takes away from what this movie is ... a wonderfully acted and richly textured peek at life as movies rarely show us.  Highly recommended as a must-see.",1206316800,,3317,4.6563573883161515

2316785,2,B0009S4IGA,"I have a problem with ""Lackawanna Blues"".  As a work of fiction, I'm sure it would stand-up against many current films, but as a biography, it left much to be desired.  I feel capable of saying this because as someone from the local area, I readily see the flaws in the film.  No matter how well one finds the acting, the depiction of the town is flawed.  No one who lived in the Western New York area during the fifties would not have been affected by Lackawanna and the mighty Bethlehem Steel Company.  The light from the mill illuminated the skies of the town and all the towns within a fifty mile radius.  How could one make a film situated in that town and never mention the mill?  I dare say that people who came to the boarding house were looking for work and I think that it would be inconceivable that not one tried to get on at the mill.  It was the center of the town with over 20,000 workers.

My second criticism is that the film appears at if it's set in the 1930s not the 1950s or 1960s.  During those years the major club scene in Buffalo had mainstream entertainment.  Miles, Dizzy, Cannonball, Jamal, Silver, the Messengers, the MJQ and so many more played the jazz clubs. The blues clubs presented the likes of Muddy Waters, Big Mabel, Della Reese, and Etta James.  The concert stage presented Sarah Vaughn, Nancy Wilson, and Carmen McCray or featured Sammy Davis Junior.  People from Lackawanna, Niagara Falls and Toronto came to Buffalo for their entertainment.  I don't know of one club in Lackawanna that existed outside the realm of a neighborhood bar.

This film must be about the have-nots that lived on the fringes of a prospering black community.  There is a sadness about films such as this.  Because to look back to my youth and see the distortions of what I lived pains me.  The brave men were men like my father who worked that mill and died some forty years later from time-bomb lung cancer, not the ones who wasted and distorted their lives drinking and acting silly.  If Lackawanna represented anything, it should be a tribute to all the men of various hues and complections who gave of their lives.

Finally, I find it odd that the child-the film's author--that was born in the house was not taken to the hospital.  I have a sister who was born in1937 in Our Lady of Victory hospital, the major hospital in Lackawanna.  One of the positive attributes of the state of New York is that it instituted various health laws during the early and mid 20th century long before the other forty-eight states.  I find it hard to believe that this newborn baby was not taken to the hospital.  So I gather from that scene that poverty was not just a financial drawback but there was cultural poverty.  Yet I sense that throughout the film, the ""whoa is me"" syndrome came to dominate the author's mind.  Let me say that I cannot recommend this films as a true depiction of a time and a place that I know so well.  I can only say that if you do view it simply regard it as a mere caricature of the times that only exist in the mind of the author/playwright who penned this piece.",1152576000,15,3099,4.4389380530973455

It is nice to see a woman ( Nanny )full of strength ,and courage but at the same time full of grace in the face of adversity and times of trouble . I have taken it upon myself to sit down and view this movie with my white friends because I believe it offers an incredible insight into our culture ,and shows them better than I can tell them how these women ( Nanny,Grandma,Big Mamma ) whom ever they may be to myself or you have remained powerful in our lives even though they may no longer be with us .

2316818,2,B0009S4IGA,"I was being kind by giving this poorly-written film 2 stars: I thought the writing lacked focus, freshness and originality. Characters, such as Lou Gossett's, were introduced and then abandoned for the most part. And there was no true sense of cohesion between any of them. Also, quite a few cliches abound, and they were all hard to get around; they'd all been seen before in other, better, films within this genre. The dialogue was, at times, painful and predictable. Some of the acting, such as the main character kid's and the over-the-top Macy Gray's, left much to be desired. The fine actress portraying Nanny did a noble job at making the best of the inferior material that laid out before her--as did the ever-excellent Jeffrey Wright who, in my humble opinion, was the best thing in the film--despite a rather abbreviated appearance. Terrence Howard, Saul Williams and Delroy Lindo were all solid as well. Overall, I believe all the (rather unwarranted) positive reviews this film received speaks to a larger, more pressing issue: the profound desire of African Americans, like myself, to see their images on screen as multi-dimensional, complex, positive, non-buffoonish clowns or criminal, in uplifting and inspiring stories that truly capture the nuances that define our unique experiences in this world.",1143590400,4,1316,5.154205607476635
2316819,5,B0009S4IGA,"Ever since I first encountered the Divine Ms Merkerson as a sex therapist in Spike Lee's ""She's Gotta Have It"" I have been sold on the range of this exceedingly gifted yet terribly underrated actress.  She received an Emmy for her portrayal here and to say it is well-deserved is a masterpiece of understatement.

Here she simply shines as THE guiding force and hand in her community.  This was especially poignant for me for I grew up in this very same time period.  The production detail was phenomenal and evoked wooooooooooooooonderful memories of life and times during the 50s & 60s and of women like Ms Merkerson portrayed.  She was thoroughly and ably accompanied by a hot, hot cast with performances one would enjoy over and over again. I first saw Macy Gray's name in the credits and went ho-hum.  Her performance was so good, I didn't even recognize her until about a 3rd of the way through. I am especially proud of the obvious care and attention to detail to produce a feel and look of another beautiful era in African-American culture that is very tastefully done.

Another very interesting aspect is that the project was less concerned with the racial fabric of the times but inifinitely more attuned to the richness of the characters and the emotional diversity they provide to exemplify that in the final analysis it is about the choices we make and to what extent we accept responsibility for those choices.

This is a worthy, elegant presentation of African-American life and is most assuredly destined to become a classic.  You owe it to yourself to have this as part of your collection.

2316825,5,B0009S4IGA,"""Lackawanna Blues"" is about a kind-hearted African-American woman named ""Nanny Crosby"" and the people living in the boarding house she owns. Apparently, the movie is based on fact. It takes place in the 1950s and 60s when there was a vibrant African American community and culture in Lackawanna, New York. (For those who aren't famiiar with the city, Lackawanna is near Buffalo and if probably best described as the buckle in the rust belt.)

The boarding house is peopled by a mad collection of blues singers, maniacs, straight-razor toting women, drunks, and misfits.  Nanny manages them all with some exciting moments while raising a boy abandoned by his mother and father.  There's no plot to speak of; the movie is a biography of Nanny and her times, mostly from the viewpoint of a young boy. It's a busy movie with lots of action happening in the corners of the screen and a whole slew of sub-plots and character studies.  The music is good boozy blues; the actors are excellent.

A couple of things were interesting to me.  First, there was a substantial multi-racial component to the movie and many of the characters seemed bi-racial. Was that in fact the case in Lackwanna?  Secondly, is the suggestion that African American culture and neighborhoods deterioriated as integration took hold and the isolation of the African-American community decreased.

The story is based on the author's life as the child 'Junior' (Marcus Carl Franklin) raised in the inimitable home of soulfully empathetic Rachel ""Nanny"" Crosby (S. Epatha Merkerson),
a lady who devoted her life to aiding the disenfranchised by transporting them from the South, from mental hospitals, and from the streets to Lackawanna, New York.  The boy recalls all the lessons he learned about life from the inhabitants of the house - odd characters with painful pasts - and from the disintegration of his racially mixed biological family rescued by Nanny.  The myriad characters of the home are too numerous to outline but they are portrayed by some of the finest actors in the business: Terrence Howard, Rosie Perez, Mos Def, the beautiful Carmen Ejogo, Louis Gossett Jr., Jeffrey Wright, Ernie Hudson, Charlayne Woodward, Jimmy Smits, Patricia Wettig, Macy Gray, Liev Schreiber, Kathleen Chalfant, Lou Myers, Hill Harper - the list goes on and on.

In the course of the film we are introduced to the cruelties of racism, the history of desegregation, the dynamics of drug abuse and violence, the infectious joy of African American music contributions to our musical culture, and the courage of one fine woman who battled all the hardships the world can dish out to maintain the dignity of those with whom she came into contact.  S. Epatha Merkerson is wholly submerged in this role, a role she makes shine like a beacon of reason in a world of chaos.  She offers one of the most stunning performances of the past years, and had this film been released in the theaters instead of as an HBO movie, she without a doubt would add the Oscar to place along side her Golden Globe award.

The entire cast is exceptional and Wolfe handles the acting and the story like a master: like riffs in a jazz piece, he pastes tiny moments of conversation with each character and Junior along with flashes of scenes from the story with the matrix of dance fests at the local clubs brimming over the top with incredible blues, jazz, dancing, and joy.  The production crew has mounted this little miracle of a picture with extreme care and never for a moment does attention lag from the momentum of the story. Highly Recommended, almost Compulsory Viewing!  Grady Harp, February 06",1140220800,22,2631,4.815964523281597

The story was worthy of being told because I don't recall hearing about Lackawanna, NY prior to seeing this movie. It was refreshing to see an African American women be the heart and soul of the community and make a difference in peoples lives. The music was awesome too! I brought the movie and watched it twice within a couple of days, this is one you could watch over and over and enjoy it each and every time.",1138665600,4,557,4.58
2316860,5,B0009S4IGA,"This was an excellent film. S. Epatha is just an amazing, amazing actress. This was such an enjoyable and moving film, I loved the colorful and lively characters.  The acting in this film was very impressive. I think each actor dug deep to bring to life the character and that's always appreciated!  Macy Gray and her boyfriend were the funniest of all... The funniest part is when they got into a fight, cut each other, and still woke up together the next morning.  A definite FEEL GOOD movie :o) Full of layers... comedy, drama, laughter, love, alternatives, tradition, and plenty of flavor.",1137110400,2,593,4.794117647058823
2316861,5,B0009S4IGA,"This is one of those movies that grabs you from the beginning and twist and slams you emotionally throughout the feature. The cast is extraordinary without the faintest hint of anyone being uncormfortable in their role. You get the sense that you're really there taking all this in. A great deal of care was given in the sets, costumes and music of the period. The relationship between the characters we meet is both simple and complicated as the movie goes on, but the steady performance of Ms. Merkerson is so powerful that the movie ends before we've had our fill of the wonderful misfits. To single out anyone other than ""Nanny"" is an injustice because we have very good performances by great veteran actors including Jeffery Wright, Jimmy Smits, Terrence Howard and Delroy Lindo. But it is Marcus Franklin, Macy Gray and Ms. Merkerson that makes this a wonderful experience. The movie moves rapidly and is short by todays standards, but it is without question one of the best movies you're going to see this year. If you like good period pieces that will challenge you emotionally, tug at your heart, lift you joyfully and have you tapping your feet at the same time, then this is the movie for you. I've shown it to several friends and they all want my copy, that says it all, the movie is that good. Check it out for yourself.",1130284800,26,1333,4.628691983122363

2316864,5,B0009S4IGA,"I can't beleive I ignored this movie for so long!  My father told me to watch it. So I bought it (you have to trust your dad, right).

I popped it in a week later and was going to watch it while I cooked dinner.  I was stuck from the openning scene and dinner didn't turn out too well.  I grew up in a small town filled with memorable characters with stories to tell and this movie was so relatable.

That said, S. Epatha Merkerson was amazing. She allowed her character, Rachel ""Nanny"" Crosby, to show strength, love, understanding, and true loyality to the those around her...no matter their story.  If you were raised around a woman like this you will understand better than I am describing.

My hat goes off to the creators, cast, HBO, and anyone that played a part in bringing this project to light.",1127606400,5,804,4.391891891891892
2316865,4,B0009S4IGA,"This was so good.  I loved it.  It's about Nanny and her story (told by a young man who was raised by her).  Macy Gray and Jimmy Smits were two of the more known people to star in this, but Nanny took the cake.  She was amazing and what an actress.  I wished this movie was a little longer, because it was so enjoyable and over before I knew it.  You'll enjoy the music too - it's really beautiful.",1126915200,8,398,3.9746835443037973
