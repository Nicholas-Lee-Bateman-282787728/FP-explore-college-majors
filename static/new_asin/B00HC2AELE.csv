6153811,5,B00HC2AELE,"As stated above, you quicly forget that it is a 40yo man playing the role, and just get right into the character.
She is so obnoxious and self-serving that it is hard not to like her.
Having teenage kids mimic her is even more funny, as imitating is the ultimate form of flattery!",1393545600,,280,4.30188679245283
6153812,4,B00HC2AELE,"This is one of the strangest shows I've seen in, well, ever, but also one of the best. After a few minutes, you'll forget that Ja'mie is played by a middle aged man, and you instead will sit in slack jawed wonder at how real this satire seems. Chris Lilly is extremely talented; just watch his body language when he interacts with his fellow students. Were it not for a mildly disappointing final episode, I'd give this 5 stars.",1392163200,8,428,4.430379746835443
6153813,5,B00HC2AELE,Hard to not look away.  Chris Lilly disturbingly and accurately captures the persona of a vial teenage-girl suffering from narcissistic personality disorder as she makes her way through her last couple weeks of high school.  Ja'mie is the girl we all love to hate and yet her mannerisms and made-up slang quickly become infectious.  When you start rating your friends and family on a 'quishe' scale - you know you've OD'd on Ja'mie: Private School Girl.,1391040000,12,453,4.934210526315789
6153814,5,B00HC2AELE,"Hilarious! I first saw Chris Lilly's skit show when I lived in Aus and I remember Ja'mie being the stand out character from that. Her 40hr Famine Skit had me actually laughing out loud, so when I saw that HBO had picked up a series/season of just Ja'mie I knew I had to binge! And binge I have. I'm sad it was only 6 episodes, as it was so hilarious to watch. I really hope there's more! I can't believe how well Chris Lilly has picked up acting like a teenage girl SO well. It takes me back- so much eye rolling and a glad reminder to be out of high school. Truly loved it!",1483401600,,574,4.0
6153815,5,B00HC2AELE,"I absolutely love this show. Its so funny, so fresh. Theres nothing on tv like it. Awesome pairing with Summer Heights High.",1482796800,,124,4.681818181818182
6153816,5,B00HC2AELE,This show is so offensive and funny. Hated to see the season end.,1481587200,,65,4.076923076923077

6153823,5,B00HC2AELE,"Like other reviewers I at first didn't know why the teen girl was being played by a man. But after a few minutes I was so enjoying Chris's characterization of a spoiled, self important, funny young lady! Really a gem of a series: try an episode on HBO to see what you think. I purchased the dvd's for the extra special features. Also a peek into Australian private school system which was fascinating!",1463097600,,401,4.506849315068493
6153824,5,B00HC2AELE,"I freaking love Ja'mie! This series is awesome and if you haven't seen it, you should totally buy it. Unless you're povo, in that case make good financial decisions and spend money on more important things.

There were no problems with the disc, it was totally quiche.",1460937600,,268,4.702127659574468

6153843,2,B00HC2AELE,"This is NO Summer Heights High. It's not as funny. There's so much talking going on with these school girls you hardly know what dialogue to focus on. It's just NOT FUNNY! Kudos to the transformation (again) of Chris Lilly. He does a repeat role well, but it just falls flat to me. This cost me $22 and there were only 6, 25 minute episodes. Save your money and wait til this one is on Netflix or Amazon Prime Video.",1428019200,,416,4.2125

Every time I watch I am astounded at how accurately Chris Lilley portrays a teenage girl--the way he speaks and words things, the cattiness, the gestures, and just the overall demeanor.

6153853,5,B00HC2AELE,"If you understand anything about how important it is in Sydney as to which high school you graduated, you will love this spoof on a private girls school. While all the talk is about sexuality and being popular and quiche, the funniest part about the show is that the lead is played by the writer, Chris Lillie. If you were not offended by a few sexual innuendos and rough talk, you'll love this spoof.",1418860800,,401,4.4324324324324325
6153854,3,B00HC2AELE,Funny...but not one of the best. Storyline and acting could be stonger..but basic idea is good...camp is funny...but main character is not camp enough in my opinion...,1417824000,,167,5.222222222222222

6153858,5,B00HC2AELE,"This show is so quiche, like seriously, I can't even  no. It's so funny it'll make you want to pop your tits out whilst Skyping with an African, singing your school song. You'll totes love it, if you don't - you're a fat, lesbian boarder who should just go ahead and kill themselves now.",1411948800,2,287,4.314814814814815

8631516,5,B00HC2AELE,"This show is amazing! It is so much fun to watch, all Chris Lilly's stuff is hilarious. I came across this show on accident and binged watched everything in like 3 days, Summer Heights High, Angry boys, like all of it. Apparently he's really popular in Australia (where Chris Lilly is from) but no ones knows about this or him in the states! Like whhaattt?? He is so funny he should be popular everywhere! The only sucky thing is that this show is really hard to find on any media platform to watch for free so I finally just bought it, I've been wanting to watch it so bad but it's definitely worth it. Just buy it, it's so funny and you can keep watching it, it never gets old.",1487635200,,679,4.230769230769231
