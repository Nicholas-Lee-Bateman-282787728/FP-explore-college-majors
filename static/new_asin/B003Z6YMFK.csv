4232889,5,B003Z6YMFK,"Bananas! The presentation is a true story about the tragic banana harvest worker's continued suffering.  It is the story of humble people taken advantage of for sake of profit in the harvesting of bananas for the Dole International Company.  The harm that was knowingly done to individuals made sterile from plantation work and the family suffering caused, is very well documented in the film.  The sad conclusion of this timely film is that the workers and their families to this day, have not been compensated even though the judgement in the US court was against the company.",1361232000,,578,4.938144329896907
4232890,4,B003Z6YMFK,"I loved this legal documentary and gave two copies away to friends in law. I gotta admit it sat on my shelf a bit before I watched it. The title ""Bananas"" isn't intriguing. But the movie itself is well done. Packaging and distribution is by Oscilloscope which is my favorite. Each of their releases feels like you are watching one of the best films in a film fest. Very good all around.",1360972800,,386,4.375
4232891,5,B003Z6YMFK,"This is one movie will make you mad! Where is corporate responsibility? How long should it last? How do they continue to dodge accountability? I have no respect for Dow Chemicals nor Dole after watching this movie! I realize there are always two sides to a story, but nothing Dole could say now except accepting responsibility and making life easier for its workers could make me support Dole now or in the future!",1353628800,3,414,4.684931506849315
4232892,5,B003Z6YMFK,"This is an amazing story, exceptionally well made documentary on how Dole, the big banana company has systematically used banned pesticides and knowingly hurt the farmers in Latin America. Pesticides that were banned in 1970s, despite being recalled by Dow Chemical Company were used extensively by Dole. Dole knew about the problems all along and when Dow Chemical Company recalled the products in late 1970s, Dole did not stop using these products, but in fact BOUGHT THE ENTIRE INVENTORY !!!! They even indemnified Dow from any liabilities - which shows they knew about this problem but still continued to use it across the board. Result: The farmers suffered with sterility and cannot bear children !

The documentary shows the tactics played by Dole to stall legal actions taken by poor farmers - final blow was when they sued the director of this movie to stop this from being released. Shameful !

Watch how a big ""banana"" ugly corporation does everything it can, use every cent of its might to fight this message but does not use one iota of humanity to stop spraying pesticides which hurt the farmers.

My family and I have stopped eating any Dole products and will never do so for the rest of our lives!!!",1317254400,15,1215,4.803827751196172
4232896,4,B003Z6YMFK,"The documentary is well made, excitingly paced drama  about Juan Dominguez, an LA Attorney's successful attempts to get compensation for South American banana workers exposed to pesticides, a noble endeavor, but it becomes clear that the film is a one-sided white wash of the case, leaving out that he was almost disbarred for fraud and the case overturned - Even if Dominguez was a good guy, that the film was so biased, leaves too many questions.  That said, it is a watchable and interesting peak at inside of a class action suit.",1399766400,,533,4.782608695652174
4232897,5,B003Z6YMFK,"The only thing more interesting than Dole's efforts to get out of admitting wrong doing and paying damages to their workers is the fight they waged, not just against the lawyer, but the Swedish film maker, the festival in which it was to be shown, journalists who wanted to report on the case. They attacked the producer of the film and it got so bad that the Swedish government had to get involved over the censorship of the documentary ""Bananas"" and the harassment of the film maker and anyone connected to it. To find out how Dole tried to censor this film watch ""Big Boys Gone Bananas"".

I can't even swallow a banana after knowledge of Dole's actions.",1396915200,6,656,4.559322033898305
4232898,5,B003Z6YMFK,This is a movie that everyone should watch. It gives insight into the economic and political power of the multinationals.,1395446400,2,121,5.1
4232899,5,B003Z6YMFK,"Dole is exposed in just another incident of its continued disregard for worker health and well being. Dole CEO admits to using insecticides banned in the US, for 3 years more, in direct contact with its banana workers.",1388275200,4,218,4.7631578947368425
4232900,1,B003Z6YMFK,"I am going to continue to Support Dole and Buy More of their Bananas after buying this, This Movie is just Propaganda and slander and more of the usual Washed up 60's ideas of Anti-Corporatism. Only a Few Minutes into this movie and you see A Poster in the Filmmaker's home that says Socialist Author advertising something of sorts I was Surprised There was No Che Slogans on the wall. I guess it would have been too obvious that this so-called ""call for Justice"" for the People in Nicaragua is just another one of the many MichaelMooreHack-esque Films that have come out in recent years all screaming about Evil Money and Evil Corporations while pocketing money off these projects. I Would love to see How A Communist or Socialist Run Enterprise did or has done with Cooperatives or their wacky ideas. I am sure the workers would end up in the gulag,Could these workers Might have been Mistreated? Could they have felt side-effects from working in the field? Every job has it's dangers sadly the way this is Presented and taken advantage by Leftists of the world who live in their comfy comodes while screaming injustice wearing expensive clothing and claiming to be for the Little Man. The Problem isn't Dole,It's Nicaragua which is Sandinista/Communist and which sadly a majority of these Same People re-elected! Where are the Cries for Black Political Prisoners In Cuba locked up for being Black and Cuban and Renouncing Castro? Dr. Biscet God Rest his Soul? and Farinas? None,Because these Banana Republics Leftists love won't dare be criticized, These workers at least have work even if they live in a Third World country and their Political Rights are Attacked By Nicaragua's True Elite of Sandinistas and Communists that's the True Injustice not some Corporation that has provided them Jobs. Nicaragua is all about Bribes and Corruption start ""Reforming"" that and cover the true injustice not this farce. This Ideological One-sided Biased was a waste of my time on netflix. I hope they sue the Filmmakers even more and anyone else having to do with it.",1387152000,3,2060,4.888571428571429
4232901,5,B003Z6YMFK,"This movie should be seen by every human on the planet! It is not only informative ,it is necessary to know & truly understand that the US government cares about no one other than themselves & have been using others as well as US citizens for guinea pigs for a very long time!!",1386633600,4,277,4.245283018867925
4232902,5,B003Z6YMFK,This documentary video gives an interesting expose of what the multi-national corporations do to poor working people through-out the world!,1378857600,2,139,6.0
4232903,4,B003Z6YMFK,Companies and Governments have exploited people since man decided to organize. This is another great example. I liked this topic because to is still very relative with the globalization of the world's economic state. It is what you would expect from a corporation. Are you listening Amazon? How are you exploiting workers?,1372723200,,322,5.211538461538462

8409980,5,B003Z6YMFK,"Awesome job!

I bought this exceptionall DVD from Japan.  I really respect the two lawyers' efforts and dignity. At the last scene, their friend bought some DOLE's pineapple juice - maybe just kidding - I hope the lawyers never minded about it. I respect the honest and sincere juries too. I really feel for the victims too. Global economy is for global companies' stockholders, not for the citizens working for the global companies.

I wanted to buy ""big boys gone bananas""  too, however, I could not. That was because it was not Region Free but Region 1.

I hope they will publish ""big boys gone to bananas""  as Region Free someday.",1458777600,,634,4.666666666666667

8409982,4,B003Z6YMFK,"This documentary film is important in a context of historic legal limitations protecting American companies from being sued by countries where they exploit workers and the environment.  Only since the governments of these countries have changed from being Banana Republics (where the elite was bribed to look the other way and protect US companies), has it been advantageous companies to be sued in US courts; suing in the country where abuses take place is now more punitive.  For the discussion and history alone, this documentary is fascinating. If you watch it, you should also watch Big Boys Go Bananas, a sequel documentary about how Dole Foods sued the Swedish filmmaker to keep him from distributing the film of the trial where Dole lost in American courts.",1437436800,,765,5.063492063492063
