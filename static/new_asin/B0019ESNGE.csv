3435124,4,B0019ESNGE,If you want to go back in time to the good old days .Well this are good dvd 's to do it with. You can watch with your kids and not have to worry about bad thing being said or done. And they are well done. They are good stories in have a ok plot to them.,1318204800,,253,3.456140350877193
3435125,5,B0019ESNGE,shows today are not made so cool as in these days. Imaginiative and fun and hilarious fun for the whole family. A set that you can trust and enjoy and laugh!!,1317427200,,158,4.129032258064516
3435126,5,B0019ESNGE,"It's my opinion that Son of Flubber is as excellent as The Absent-Minded Professor.  You can't expect a sequel to be completely different from the original, since the winning character and plot components have to be there in order for it to succeed like the original.  But there's plenty of room for originality, even so.  I really love the ways the zany Absent-Minded Professor story is made even MORE outlandish in Son of Flubber!  The casting is super, too, and the professor character, Ned Brainard, is my favorite role Fred MacMurray played.  I only wish it had been colorized like Absent-Minded Professor and Shaggy Dog!",1307232000,,626,4.923809523809524
3435127,4,B0019ESNGE,"This is probably my favorite Disney live-action comedy. It was done during a period when Disney used Fred Mac Murray for just about every adult male lead role they could find, and here, he was used beautifully! The writing, early sixties special effects, B&W cinematography and casting was absolutely perfect for this family confection. First of all, there's Mac Murray himself....that goofy speech pattern of his that says perpetually befuddled, but the basic cleverness that gets him out of his inevitable fixes...the affability that only he could muster, made him the perfect Ned Brainard. The smarmy, effete-looking Eliot Reid made a PERFECT romantic rival...the kind of guy the audience LOVED to hate! The not-too-severe looking Nancy Olsen as the object of Ned's affections, the woman he's jilted THREE TIMES at the altar...!? Perfect! Then there's that flying Model T!!

But the highlight of this film, beside the scenes of Ned flying his flubber-driven-flivver, is the basketball game that Ned helps his college team win by slapping flubber on the players' sneakers. This has to be one of the most golden slapstick comedy sequences of all time, as good as ANYTHING by Mack Sennett or Buster Keaton, and right up there with Chaplin's playing with the inflatable globe in ""The Great Dictator""! I have always loved this movie, and the sequel, ""Son of Flubber"", while nowhere near as good as the original, has ONE funny sequence where Flubber goes commercial and is advertised as a floor covering, and a couple drops their baby on it, having it bounce back in their arms unharmed and amused instead of injured. Unfortunately, that's probably the only scene you'll remember from it, but it DOES complete the duo. Get ""Absent Minded"" alone or both, depending on how big a Disney fan you are. I can't recommend the original enough!",1262822400,29,1832,5.026315789473684
3435128,5,B0019ESNGE,I love the Absent Minded Professor and thought my twin six year old grandkids would too. My only aprehension was how they would like a movie in black and white. They loved it and didn't even notice it wasn't in color!,1251590400,2,217,4.317073170731708

3435448,5,B0019ESNGE,"They are corny and classy all at once, but even my husband who isn't into too many silly movies laughed pretty heartily at these. Take note, when I say corny, its not poor acting, the acting I give a 5 star too, its just a corny story intended to be a laugh and is really quite fun.

It is the story of Ned Brainerd who is a small town college science professor, who can't remember some pretty big other stuff when he's caught up solving the worlds problems.  Fred MacMurry plays the part of the absent minded prof. and is quite believable.  In the movie through an explosion in his garage (lab) he discovers an amazing substance and this leads to the rest of the movie adventures: high bouncy college basketball players, some pretty wild dancing, an interaction with the armed forces, and a flying trip to Washington DC.  There is a great villain, ""Howard Hawks"" who also plays in The Love Bug (Herbie) and we have the big brother from Old Yeller and the wonderful maid ""Nancy"" from Pollyanna opposite Fred MacMurry.  It is wonderfully innocent fun for the whole family.  I recommend.",1414972800,3,1085,4.56701030927835

3435470,4,B0019ESNGE,"""The Absent-minded Professor"" is an hilarious b&W comedy classic.  However, ""Son of Flubber"" is a, you know, sequel.  Sequels rarely live up to their originals.  However, SOF is still better than almost anything produced on video today.
