8301816,2,B001FBPSYQ,"Luckily, I only borrowed this video. You can do 10, 20, 30 or 40 minutes, but they do not explain the moves at all or give you time to learn them before jumping right into it. When you work out for even the 10 minutes, they play the same moves on a loop...boring! Also, It's hard to exercise with you're feeling really annoyed by the instructor who cannot lead. Find another video!",1315872000,,381,4.305555555555555
8301817,3,B001FBPSYQ,"If you are a man like me who wants a fair quality or reasonably decent workout led by a man, this video does the job.  The 2 cardio portions are led by a man while the yoga, a woman.  When I have this DVD on, I am NOT embarrassed if my neighbors hear the voice of a man leading the workout that I am doing inside my apartment.  As a man in an Asian society, this is important for my social well being.  I do workout to Bob Harper, Leslie Sansone, Chris Freytag, and Michael Carson's videos, too.  For the female-led DVD's, I lower the volume.

If you are a man and know of any good videos led by male trainers, share them with me.",1299888000,,630,4.0
8301818,1,B001FBPSYQ,"If you're reading this, you may be thinking about purchasing this DVD.  Luckily, I didn't have to purchase DVD (borrowed from the library), but it's such an awful video that I was compelled to write a review about this to warn others not to waste their hard-earned money on it.

Note: the library only had the cardio portion of the DVD so I am not reviewing the yoga portion.

It has 10, 20, 30, 40 minute cardio workouts. It's pure cardio -- some plyometric and taebo type moves.

I chose the 40 minute workout.  It started off alright for the first 5 minutes.  Really, how hard is it to cue stepping to the side.  He added a few more moves to finish off the set of the warm-up, but suddenly got cut off, then the last 3 minutes of the warm-up repeated. I thought it was my DVD player malfunctioning at first but this kept happening every 5-10 minutes within the video.

The instructor cannot cue counts properly, doesn't know how to cue the upcoming moves and whoever scripted this workout doesn't know how to build up a proper flow!  Then the video itself had these odd camera angles. Most of the time the camera is facing the instructor, then it will suddenly change and be diagonal to him. It's just so awkward!

I managed to last 30 out of the 40 minutes because I couldn't deal with it anymore.  For a beginner or average exerciser, I think they would find the workout extremely confusing.",1297814400,,1396,4.435294117647059
