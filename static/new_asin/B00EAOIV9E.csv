5899746,2,B00EAOIV9E,In my opinion this film did not match the level of creativity and excellence of some of Tyler Perry's other work. This movie was very predictable with a story line that was similar to countless other films about romantic betrayal and consequences.  I found myself able to voice some of the dialog before it appeared.,1391817600,,316,4.745454545454545
5899747,5,B00EAOIV9E,I saw this at the movies when it  first came out this is a eye opener movie! Packaging was great it came before the date they says it would come!

Watch it lll,1389398400,,340,4.0
5899748,1,B00EAOIV9E,"Video was packaged, but did not go past the opening credits!  I tried cleaning it, etc however nothing worked.  Limited time contraints and a father with emergency cardiac surgery was the only thing that kept me from returning the movie for another copy.  Gret movie, but it does me no good if I can't watch it.",1383955200,2,311,4.517857142857143

8603315,5,B00EAOIV9E,"This film will have you on your toes the whole time. I was hesitant to watch it at first because of the crazy scary commercials that were made. I was afraid that cheating would be more than tempting with this film. BUT it was a great story, I mean it made cheating thrilling and attractive, but once you were hooked, the consequences rapidly came to your surprise. It truly helps to appreciate your spouse and not let temptation get the best of you, no matter how appealing it may be.",1402531200,,484,4.388888888888889
