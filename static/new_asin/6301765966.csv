7815834,5,6301765966,"I just love Leo Buscaglia and am so saddened that he is now gone from us.  I wish all his lectures were taped so that many of us could pass them on to the next generations.  He had so much common sense about loving, forgiving and accepting others and the need we all have for touch, as in hugs, and words of encouragement.  This came to me in great condition and I have already watched it and it was in great shape",1236124800,5,414,4.024390243902439

 so well in this video...he is very animated and very funny,he helps you to learn life lesson's without beating you over
 the head with them.this is not a ""watch once"" and put it on
 the shelf tape...it is always enjoyable and refreshing.",1016064000,8,305,4.611111111111111
