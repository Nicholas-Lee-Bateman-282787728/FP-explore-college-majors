8680830,3,B00NWRKFJ4,"I loved this show growing up and had all of the books that came out related to this series as well. Its a fun, quirky mystery series. I was very excited to finally find this show on DVD after all these years. However, this release of the show, while very convincing seems more like a bootleg copy. The quality of the video is not very good and the sounds is all over the place at times.",1528761600,,386,4.092105263157895
8680831,4,B00NWRKFJ4,"After all these years, I have caught up on everything that I had missed.

It's a common thread throughout the series: title character noses in on cases, investigates for herself (but not without help from friends), gets into a dangerous scrape and then out, and at last, the climactic touch. Rather on the repetitive side really. But trouble/life-endangerment can happen in the field. And there are some things that adults note that kids note faster. Still, kids (teens) are still kids--if the times in which the detectives are on the same track as Shelby are any indication.

The episodes in the Massachusetts half of the show are not shown in order. I have learned that as I went along. [Why that is, I don't know.] And I looked at each episode one-by-one, instead of selecting ""Play All""--to be on the safe side.

All in all, 'The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo' shows the very intellect and determination that today's Nickelodeon takes away from kids and adults. No buffoonery or kooky names attached.

No, I have not been able to solve the case before Shelby. But I wish she wouldn't rub it in so much. Yet, at her age, we're all that sure of ourselves.
Here's looking at you, Golden Era Nick. You too, Ms. Woo.",1522195200,,1213,4.627906976744186

8680838,2,B00NWRKFJ4,"Let me start off by saying that the rating is for not for the show; it's for the quality of this particular release.  I loved this show as a kid, so I was glad to see that the complete series was finally available on DVD.  However, I was very disappointed with the video quality.  The discs are DVD-R's, and the video quality is unwatchable on all five of the DVD players I have tried.  The video is jerky and plays like a stop-motion film anytime there is a fast camera pan (which is often) or something moves quickly.  The quality is at least watchable on my MacBook's DVD drive, but the video still pixilates somewhat (instead getting jerky) when something moves fast.  Additionally, some of the season 4 episodes have low volume, audio blips, and occasional tracking lines, as if they were copied from old VHS tapes.  Finally, as a previous reviewer stated, the episodes are in random order, which, in conjunction with the quality issues, really makes this set seem thrown together.  This definitely seems more like a bootleg than a DVD-quality release.",1423440000,7,1057,4.706521739130435
8680839,5,B00NWRKFJ4,Only one problem. Disk 5 starts out with the Paul Revere Mystery which is obviously the 1st episode of Shelby Woo in the Boston area. The problem is that Disk 4 has Boston area episodes that clearly take place after those in Disk 5. The disks are mislabeled. I have not watched alll of them but everything else is great.,1417305600,5,320,4.35
