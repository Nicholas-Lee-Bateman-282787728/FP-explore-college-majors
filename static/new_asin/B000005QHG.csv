1186107,5,B000005QHG,"I always warned students at the beginning of each year that I had screened ""The Paper Chase"" once again and was interested in using the Socratic method to spin the little tumblers of their minds.  Certainly this was the film that made me want to curb my innate desire to stand up in the classroom and pontificate on every subject under the sun.
Ostensibly the film is about the pressures of first year students at Harvard Law School, but since most of us do not want to become lawyers, know any lawyers, have any dealings with lawyers or even watch television programs with lawyers, ""The Paper Chase"" ultimately succeeds as a film about wanting to learn and learning to think.  At the heart of the film is James Hart (Timothy Bottoms), come from Minnesota to learn at the feet of the great Professor Charles Kingsfield.  Despite some painful moments of confrontation in the classroom with his would be mentor-my favorite: ""Mr. Hart, here is a dime.  Take it, call your mother, and tell her there is serious doubt about you ever becoming a lawyer""-Hart finds he can play the game and play it well.  Having given his mind over to Kingsfield, the question then becomes whether his heart and soul will follow as well.  The other members of his study group (which includes Edward Herrmann and James Naughton), make different choices and take different paths in order to survive the year.  By the end of the film Hart is more alone than he was at the beginning.
As Kingsfield, John Houseman is the powerful center of the film.  A producer and drama teacher for almost half a century, Houseman won the 1973 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and began a new career as an actor in films and a pitchman in television commercials (however, this was not Houseman's first film, since I know he played an admiral in the political thriller ""Seven Days in May"").  Indeed, Houseman went on to play the Kingsfield character in the ambitious television versions of the movie.  However, it is important to note that those who knew Houseman as a producer or teacher were always quick to point out that he really was acting in ""The Paper Chase.""  There might be Harvard professors fighting over the honor of being the real Kingfield, but Houseman was indeed just doing a role.
As the autocratic master of his domain, Kingsfield is very much the antithesis of the traditional dedicated teacher usually presented in films about school, a point driven home in the film's final meeting between Hart and Kingsfield.  If there is a happy ending in this film, it is achieved by Hart's character on a personal, almost private level.
The original novel by John Jay Osborn, Jr. was brought to the film my director James Bridges, who also did the screenplay.  Although the sub-plot where Hart discovers the young woman of his affections (Lindsay Wagner) is in fact (gasp!) Kingsfield's daughter is decidedly contrived, overall the film is an intelligent and thoughtful piece.  If you are a teacher, or are thinking about becoming a teacher, ""The Paper Chase"" is just as much recommended viewing as the more conventional fare as such classics as  ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips,"" ""To Sir, With Love,"" ""Up the Down Staircase,""  or more contemporary efforts such as ""Songs of the Heart.""",969494400,107,3246,4.779964221824687
1186108,5,B000005QHG,"This movie is a must own, and a must watch for both prospective, current, and past law school attendees.  Other than the truly corny love story, it is pretty pathetic, the law school related scenes are eerily realistic.  Kingsfield is the exemplar of the tough, old-school, Socratic method law  professor, and every law student should be familiar with his style.  The  only question I have about this movie is, when is it coming out on DVD?",960076800,10,440,4.7368421052631575
1186109,5,B000005QHG,"Wonderful!  As I have recently completed my first year of law school, I could not more strongly endorse the film as required ""sustenance"" for the aspiring law student.  Expect this type of environment and you will  have established an initial foundation for success (although the academic  atmosphere of law school is not nearly as vicious thirty years later.)  Required viewing for all prospective attorneys.",958348800,6,409,5.328125
1186110,5,B000005QHG,"There was no ""mysterious"" relationship between  Kingsfield and his daughter. Susan was played by Lindsay Wagner not Diane Wagner. Also Hart was a first year law student he had not graduated yet, the grades were  for the completed year, he threw them away to symbolize that he wouldn't  sacrifice the rest of his life for the goal of financial happiness, however  it's evident that he did pass.",952905600,4,393,4.82089552238806
1186111,5,B000005QHG,"Warning! If you don't want to know how the film ends, don't read this review.  I showed the film to my undergraduate Law & Politics students.  The mostly first and second year students had this to say when I asked  them why Hart threw his grades into the sea:
 ""Just graduating from  Harvard was all he needed.""
 ""He did not want to become a  lawyer.""
  ""He already knew he had conquered that old duff of  a teacher.""
 ""He had realized the school and its pressures  were B.S.""
 ""His girlfriend was right.""
 ""Other  things were more important to him like his girlfriend.""",945388800,4,570,4.5049504950495045
1186142,3,B000005QHG,"As an incumbent 1L myself, this film was recommended by my father, a practicing attorney for 30 years.  My biggest problem with it is the incredibly unlikable main character (with an irrational name), Hart.  He's capricious, difficult to sympathize with, and doesn't really seem to have many characteristics (whether good or bad).  The most well-written character, the most fully fleshed-out, is the professor Kingsfield, but the implication of his professorial style is worrisome for someone in my position: the implication being that your law school professors won't recognize you as a person outside the walls of their classroom.  And maybe that held true in 1973 Harvard, and maybe it still does.  The interplay of Hart dating Kingsfield's daughter and the consequences of that relationship never really play out, and we're left constantly wondering if there's a future there.  I'm happy to have watched it, as I think it offers a serviceable view into the life of a 1L, even if its only a view into the life of one particular 1L trapped very steadily in time.  That said, I wouldn't watch it again.  My recommendation for better 1L preparation is to read One L by Scott Turow instead.",1500422400,,1189,4.96969696969697

1186145,4,B000005QHG,"As someone mentioned in a review a couple years ago, there aren't many people to like in this film.  They mostly come across with a lot of weakness or self-assuredness bordering on arrogance. I hadn't seen it in more than 25 years until I got and watched this video.  In watching it again, I do agree with those who say the movie is very slow, possibly boring to some.  I guess you have to like the struggle Hart goes through and then accept that he conquers it at the end when he doesn't end up caring about his grade.  Overall, I like the movie, but would not watch it frequently.

One odd thing: on the back of the CD insert which describes the film a bit, it says ""Knightsfield,"" rather than ""Kingsfield.""",1495584000,,709,4.340909090909091

1186148,4,B000005QHG,I saw the movie in a dubbed version on German TV years ago and liked the dialogues between Prof. Kingsfield and his students.

1186182,4,B000005QHG,"This is a film about the rat race of Harvard Law School among a group of white male students in the 1970s, and how it consumes them, and one tries to break free, and stand up to an unnecessarily cruel professor. It kind of reminded of a couple years I spent at Vassar, and the needless competition and pressure that doesn't really translate into much of anything in life, but seemed an absurd hazing ritual, even then. I think men who are locked into corporate lives might find this more meaningful, while I just found it repellant, but it is brilliantly acted and holds up well.",1479513600,,579,4.471698113207547
1186183,4,B000005QHG,"Watching it 26 years after graduating from law school, it is still a good movie and fair representation of law school with stacks of books, paper note books, pens and highlighters, well before the digital age. Main flaw is having the protagonist sleeping with Professor Kingsfield's daughter. Seemed to be a good plot before she was brought in and takes away from the main plot of the study group that implodes on the eve of finals week. Otherwise no politics in movie, and could well have been made in the 30s or 80s with the silly subplot that takes over. Indeed, could very well have been a John Hughes movie with better soundtrack, or Cary Grant/Myrna Lloyd movie.",1478131200,,668,4.669491525423729

1186185,5,B000005QHG,"So what could be better than watching John Houseman in an Oscar-winning performance as Harvard Law Professor Kingsfield. Of course, the Professor is a fictional character, but is supposedly a mixture of a number of actual Harvard Law faculty members.
The movie is wonderful, the characters all are interesting and the interactions among the various characters is riveting.

1186189,3,B000005QHG,"Haven't seen this since it was in the theaters in the 70's.  Sadly ""The Paper Chase"" doesn't hold up over the years.  The dated hairstyles and dreadful 70's clothes look silly and as a child of the 70's it's awful to look at now.  Timothy Bottoms is OK as a young midwesterner tackling law school at prestigious Harvard Law School.  He has an unconvincing relationship with Lindsay Wagner (before she became bionic) who just happens to be his most demanding professor's daughter.  The film focuses on the Socratic Professor Kingsfield played by John Houseman (familiar to those of a certain age for his Smith/Barney TV ads) in an Oscar winning role and his shaping the minds of his callow students from ""skulls full of mush"" to the mind of a lawyer.  Worth a look if you're feeling nostalgic for the 70's.",1472256000,,805,4.673758865248227

On the other hand, he realized that he'd achieved the satisfaction and the feeling of overcoming by himself, so that piece of paper doesn't get to judge him.

Hart, a young man, played by Timothy Bottoms, is a very intelligent young man from Minnesota. He is now at Harvard Law, among the best and the brightest. He joins a study group where they outline each class and share the information. Hart chooses Contract Law, not because he loves it, but because of the professor, played by John Houseman. It is such a difficult class that most everyone cringes when they enter, but they leave revering the professor. John Houseman won an Oscar for this role, as well he should. His character, for me is an unforgettable moment. One you want to share, but don't particularly want to go through. The study found that seems useless, and in the end, Hart and Ford, another study participant, rent a hotel room for the weekend and study. One of the shining moments is when Hart discovers he is dating this professor's daughter, played by Lindsay Wagner.  Their relationship matures as does Hart. Such a fine film. Everyone should view it again.

1186469,4,B000005QHG,"This early 1970s gem is worth viewing for John Houseman's performance as the haughty law professor, Charles Kingsfield, who evokes the best and worst from his students. Timothy Bottoms does a fine job as Kingsfield's suffering freshman, James Hart, as the film follows his progress through the first year of Harvard Law School. Many of the other performances are less compelling; in particular, Lindsay Wagner as the professor's daughter (and Hart's love interest) is somewhat wooden, and Hart's classmates are formulaic. Quibbles aside, though, The Paper Chase is as enjoyable as many of today's effects-laden productions.

1186578,5,B000005QHG,"John Houseman's Oscar winning performance as Harvard Law Professor Charles W. Kingsfield is the main draw of this film, but it's also a great time capsule of college life in the early seventies. Kingsfield is the kind of superstar professor most well known universities have one or two of, and he's brilliant, aloof, intimidating and authoritative all presented in a personality full of the hauteur of one looking down from Olympus. Timothy Bottoms is a likeable student entering his first year of Law at Harvard, takes his work seriously, and believes Dr. Kingsfield has taken a personal interest in him. Along the way he meets a young woman and begins to have a relationship with her, not knowing that she is Kingsfield's daughter, though this fact does not take he film in the direction one might suspect. His other relationships consist entirely with the fellow students in his study group.

In a way that would prevent the film from being made today, the plot moves slowly and not all that much really happens. It's mostly about the student, James Hart (Timothy Bottoms) inner life, his expectations and ability to cope with the pressures of Harvard Law. In one of those fortuitous Hollywood flukes, Houseman, who had primarily been a producer, was cast only after many actors turned down the role, and ended up with a whole second career as an actor even though he was in his seventies. Though it's mainly his show, Timothy Bottoms holds his end up well and creates a winning and sympathetic character as ""Mr. Hart"". Lindsay Wagner plays Susan, the love interest, a part either undrewritten or written in such a way as to be at odds with herself, does as well as she can with a small part.

The film is shot in a naturalistic way that makes much of it seem like a documentary, especially scenes of the classroom and dorm life. For those who went to college during the time shown, all will be familiar. For younger viewers there will be many surprises: the long hair on the male students, the fact they take notes on paper in notebooks, and most of all the dorm, where there is one pay phone for all the students on the floor, who line up to use it.",1439078400,3,2154,4.636125654450262

Not sure about Liddy and McCord. My Oakland A's won the World Series! Go A's! Nixon fired Archibald Cox...what a goofball Nixon was! I can imagine Professor Kingsfield having Nixon in his class at Harvard. ""Mr. Nixon,  here is a dime. Take it, call your mother, and tell her there is serious doubt about you ever becoming a lawyer."" OK Nixon actually went to Duke. It's actually hard to imagine Nixon having fun in college. George W? Clinton? Those guys had fun. Anyway that's it about 1973. So much big news..What? The Paper Chase? Yeah it's good, happy? Just rent the movie or stream.",1437436800,,1301,4.310204081632653

Thanks to Amazon Prime Instant video I was able to finally sit down and check this off the list of movies to watch, and I'm glad I did. John Houseman delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as the tyrannical Professor Kingsfield (which is good as he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor that year). Timothy Bottoms portrays a young law student that will make you almost like lawyers. Seeing a young Lindsay Wagner was a treat. I had only previously known her from her time as The Bionic Woman and it was very refreshing to see her in a dramatic role. The principle characters in this film nail their parts and pull you into the story. My only regret is having waited so long to watch this movie.",1437004800,2,831,4.402597402597403

In fact, it was on my top ten list of best movies for its Catcher in the Rye wit and sarcasm. Seeing the characters come to life as I imagined them was fun, particularly Kingsfield. As I watched the movie again and now understand the associated heartache with the failures and the joys that life brings, I thought the other actors (Houseman was still awesome) and the director trivialized the emotions that come from these personal events. In particular, when Hart realizes that if he wants to stay at the top, he has to consistently work hard and make personal sacrifices. Buttons dialogue was awkward and the direction made it appear funny. Same observation, when the Brooks have to confront the sinking feeling from his suicidal gesture that as smart as he is, he does not have a mind for the law. Stick with the book and leave it your imagination. Gave it two stars because of Houseman, still a brilliant performance. I felt like he was going to call on me in the living room.",1436400000,,1066,4.523316062176166

John Houseman (who I had the pleasure to photograph a few times) and Timothy Bottoms are both terrific. And Lindsay Wagner, later to become a TV star, is great at Bottoms' girlfriend. The film gets a little bogged down in that relationship, at times, and the script is predictable here and there, but overall it's still a very entertaining movie and Houseman makes it worth watching several times. He was such an actor's actor.

But on a deeper level, it's the story of a generational struggle, the Baby Boomers against the children of the Great Depression. Great acting by John Houseman as a law professor who is trying to shape the undisciplined but bright students into disciplined lawyers and also by Timothy Bottoms as a bright but (somewhat) free spirited student. Early glimpse of the acting potential of Edward Hermann as one of the students in Bottoms' study group. The sole rough spot was Lindsey Wagner as Houseman's daughter and Bottoms' lover. I've never found her a convincing actress and this is no different. Basically she is screen candy. Other than that, however, the film is a gem.",1435968000,,822,4.715277777777778

Of course, the very best bits are the ""lectures"" given by Prof. Kingsfield (aka - John Houseman), and the '60s behavior of Lindsay Wagner (before she took up acting as a profession). There should have been a lot, lot more of Kingsfield and a lot less of the angst, but, compared to most modern movies, the angst is at least manageable - if you close your eyes or take these moments to go to the bathroom! No story (but when is there one these days?), just open a drink, sit back and wallow in nostalgia. Spoiler alert - the makers did not know how to end this movie sensibly, so bail on the last 5-10 minutes - you won'd miss anything and won't have to curse.",1435276800,,792,4.286666666666667

Timothy Bottoms plays a sweet Midwestern kid without the pedigree of the other law students in his study group. His candor, lack of pretension and kindness is often a stark contrast to his peers. John Houseman rightfully won his Oscar. Viewers will chuckle over the clothes and hairstyles of the 70s, not to mention the striking lack of technology.

1187073,5,B000005QHG,"When idealistic one-l (the catch term for first year law students) Hart first enters Prof Kingsfield's contract law class at Harvard Law School, he is unprepared that he was expected to have read the first assignment prior to the first lecture. Hart becomes Kingsfield's momentary target and loses his breakfast for his troubles. This is the inauspicious beginning to the twists and turns of the first year of law school as depicted in the very fine film The Paper Chase. The thrust of the story is not only about the law school itself and its trials and tribulations as portrayed in the courtroom-like lecture hall of Kingsfield's contracts law class but also the distractions that can interfere with the studying process.

Although the story centers around James Hart, played with exceptional realism by Timmothy Bottoms (the actor was only 21 or 22 when he played the role which would have been quite young for a law student), the star of the show is really Prof Kingsfield, played with emotional detachment and cruel insensitivity by John Houseman in an academy award-winning performance. Kingsfield is the pure unemotional intellectual who, fairly or unfairly, challenges his students--even to the point of cutting them down as a way to weed out those who probably won't be able to make the grade. Rumor has it that Prof Kingsfield was based on a real-life Harvard Law Professor who was known for his cut-throat antics towards his students in class while also being one of the most expensive attorneys in the country.

Several other stories interweave with Hart's experience at law school. There is the study group, made up of a mixed bag of lawyer-minded students who also have ambitions and egos the size of Mount Everest. There is Ford, the bow-tie-wearing student who is probably the most intelligent of the one-l students. There is Willis Bell, the intelligent but arrogant fellow student who thinks he is smarter than everyone else including Kingsfield. Seems like every college class has a Bell of some kind. Edward Hermann has a small role as another student who seems closer to the correct age for law school, and the most level-headed of the bunch. And then there is Kevin Brooks, intelligently and realistically played by James Naughton, the memory-gifted student who probably aced all his exams as an undergraduate but doesn't have the kind of mind to analyze tough law cases. Naughton's portrayal is exceptional and often overshadowed by Houseman's. Hart also becomes involved with a woman (lindsay Wagner) but doesn't really know who she is until about half-way through the story. She also becomes a distraction to his studies.

But of course, the best scenes are Kingsfield's contracts law class. Houseman seems like he was born to play the tough law professor who would give a KGB interrogator a run for his money. He is tough, uncompromising, unforgiving, and not terribly complimentary, even towards his best students. But as the film progresses, you get the sense that he is strangely fair. Law is not the profession for the weak-minded or the thin-skinned. In the first scene he challenges Hart to ""fill this room with your intelligence."" Better to find out in your first year if you really have the kind of mind, and skin, to be in the world of lawyers. And you have to negotiate Kingsfield if you want to continue the obstacle course.

A relatively realistic portrayal of the toughness of Harvard Law School seen through the eyes of the students and all the ins-and-outs that go with it. And John Houseman as Kingsfield is worth the price of admission alone. A movie not to be missed particularly if you are thinking of entering the world of law. And be prepared if you do. There will most likely be a Kingsfield that will judge whether or not you have a case to pass.",1432684800,,3795,4.879069767441861

Even in today's more wired and diverse world, I think many law students would associate with many of the travails expereinced by the law students. Even though they are unlikely to end up with Lindsay Wagner or encounter instructors quite like Kingsley.  It is still an appropriate film and one can be thankful for some of the changes that have arrived such as more diversity on campus and some more openness on the part of teachers and instructors.",1431043200,,549,4.65979381443299

1187104,2,B000005QHG,"The Paper Chase is considered to be a classic, but not because it's a good movie, but rather because of the performance of one man, John Houseman. His Academy Award winning portrayal lead to the films reputation and even spawned a successful television series, however similar to Dead Poet's Society, this film is revered for just one performance. The Paper Chase takes place during freshman year at Harvard Law School, where the students meet Professor Kingsfield (John Houseman), a throwback to when school was hard and degrees had to be earned. Kingsfield relishes in his reputation as the toughest Professor on campus, and his students have no idea what they're in for. Timothy Bottoms stars and really is one of the big problems with this film. He's the student who had to work harder than the rest just to get there, and wants nothing more than to become Kingsfield's favorite, but he's an !@#$%^&. How are viewers expected to get behind and root for someone who is so selfish and vile? As for his counterpart, John Houseman, he really was terrific and earned every bit of credit he has received for his performance. Without Houseman's portrayal of Professor Kingsfield, this film would have been quickly forgotten about, forty years ago, but it was the kind of performance that makes a career and carries a film, something that will never be forgotten. From the stand point of a moviegoer, the film is slow and boring, with a leading character I couldn't stand, but as a fan of film, I can't help but be impressed by John Houseman and recommend that his amazing performance be seen by the fans of today.",1426291200,,1610,4.774193548387097

1187164,4,B000005QHG,"This movie is difficult to rate because in parts it earns a 5 and others a 2.  The classroom scenes are pretty true to life in first-year law school. John Housmann certainly earned his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in this film.  I believe the work of most first-year law professors in teaching by the Socratic Method,  do the same job as a Marine DI in boot camp:  Tears them down and rebuilds them.  I thought the love plot was silly.  It was definitely a 70s movie.  I never took part in a study group in law school, so I can't evaluate that part, but it showed the stress on the students very well, which is definitely a part of finals prep, as well as daily classroom experience, right down to the nervous glances by students sitting near the ""victim"" who's been selected to recite and ""discuss"" an assigned case.

Based on a novel of the same name which was written by John Jay Osborn, Jr., himself a Harvard Law School graduate (he actually wrote it while in his third year there.)  While it dramatizes some aspects, it does capture the fears and anxieties surrounding such a course of study quite well...and I am speaking from experience here.  Timothy Bottoms plays our hero, James T. Hart, a first year student who idolizes the highly-regarded contracts professor Charles W. Kingsfield, played by John Houseman.  While this film may seem a bit slow and boring at times (sorry...no explosions), it does capture the nature of law school.  It's not all that exciting, especially in the first year, but what draws in students is a passion for the law and an interest in its complexities.  So, I'll somewhat hesitantly recommend this film as it's certainly not for everyone.  But if you liked the novel, go ahead and compare.

In my humble opinion It ranks up there with ""Love Story"", ""Prince of Tides"", and ""Miracle on 34th Street"".  Why do I say this?  Well, the acting is great, the story line is believable and accurate (I went to law school-briefly), and the directing is great.  There are no guns, overt sexual displays, or excessively profane and violent acts.  The movie does not minimize women, make racial innuendos , or promote male or racial supremacy.  In my opinion, this a movie about people working hard to achieve a coveted legal education at one of our nation's most prestigious institutions.

A late night for this old geezer, but a most enjoyable one. Can't believe it's been almost forty years since THE PAPER CHASE came out. But it's still a damn good film, if slightly dated. Timothy Bottoms as first-year law student Hart was most believable. John Houseman earned that Oscar for his portrayal of Kingsfield. And then there is young and dewy-eyed Lindsay Wagner before she was a six-million dollar woman. And remember when there was only one telephone per floor in college dorms? The writing is good, the acting is good, there is humor, pathos and tragedy. So did I like it for its excellence or for its nostalgia quotient? Probably both. And Timothy Bottoms, where are you?

The struggles of first year law school students and the papers that they ""chase"" from their classes, cases, brief reviews, writing in the law review...just making the grade, are all chronicled here. Competition is fierce and somewhat cut-throat in this highly competitive culture. Snobs, kiss-ups, obsessed over grades, we follow Mr. Hart through his first year at a prestigious law school with his fellow students...and his affair with his professor's daughter!

The absolute BEST parts of this movie are the scenes with John Houseman in the classroom (plus you get a tiny bit of legal education and a glimpse at Harvard law school - uh, beyond what Reese showed us in Legally Blonde...).  My least favorite parts are the portrayal of the relationship between Hart (main character) and the ""girl"" interest - just didn't feel the chemistry there, only the ""acting.""  Lindsey Wagner (the girl) wasn't exactly at her prime yet as an actress (though, in truth, not sure she actually had a ""prime""...sorry, Linds).  The studios also created a TV version of this, which actually wasn't too bad for a ""soapy"" show, but never had the impact of this movie.

1187242,4,B000005QHG,"I first saw the movie The Paper Chase when it first came in 1973 or 1974 at the theater on campus at the University of Arizona.  Being a college student at the time, viewing the movie with several hundred other college students, was a unique experience in and of itself - making the movie much more relevant my ""life situation"" at that time.  John Houseman was the perfect choice to play Professor Charles Kingsfield, Jr.  In fact, Houseman received an Academy Award for Best Supporting actor.  Timothy Bottoms plays a convincing Hart, an aspiring law student, and a young Lindsay Wagner perfect portrays Kingsfield's fiercely independent daughter.

The movie drags at times but when it gets to the final scene and Hart makes a paper airplane of his grades and ""flies"" it into the Atlantic, the theater at the University of Arizona erupted in cheering applause.  I think most college and grad school students would have a similar reaction today.

This movie isn't for everyone but if you have ever been a college student with a difficult professor, then this movie is a ""must see.""  It has been nearly 40 years since it made its debut but I believe it still resonates with college students today.  Yes, the movie is dated.  Hart uses a typewriter to write all of his papers -- we didn't have PC's or Mac's back then.  But the premise remains.  It brought back a lot of memories for me and I'm sure, if you too were a college student around that time, it will have the same impact on you.

1187308,4,B000005QHG,"""Paper Chase"" was a movie I came across in the library.  Made in seventies, this film features a group of the first year law students at Harvard Law School.  One of them is midwestern boy from Minnesota.  He is hard working and earnest.  Does not come from money (like most of the students) but has desire to make something out of his life.

Group of six tudents decides to create a study group.  Each stident will take different course and write an outline.  That would help them prepare for the final exam and get on top of the class.  Their most demanding professor is most imperial person that every student is afraid of.  So our young midwesterner decides to make an outline for the most difficult course of the semester (contract law) and at the same time realizes that the girl he is in love with is his most demanding professor's own daughter; she is divorcing her husband of two years and her own father, one of the most expensive lawyers inthe country whose friends are the Supreme Court Judges handles her divorce.

It is powerful story about a group of smart and talented students whose initial friendship turns into fierce competition.  As demands of the law school increase, the stress and tension skyrocket.  Before long, group of of six students becomes a group of three.  Their closeness is limited on exam preparation and personal friendships are out of question.  It puts things into perspective: law school vs. love; desire to succeed and support of the person who matter most; accepance of the status quo, or fight for the future that is uncertain and unkind most of the time.

I think he was even better in the television version of Paper Chase.  Almost every graduate student in every college in the land has had a Professor that reminds them of Professor Kingsfield.  No true-false or multiple choice for professors like Kingsfield.  These professors will rip a student to shreds no matter what position the student takes on a question.  When the professor gets the student to agree with his position, he will take the student's original position.

A professor at the University of Illinois was my ""Kingfield.""  He had individual one hour interviews with each student in the class at the end of the semester.

As expected, it was a pleasant, thought-provoking cerebral love story/boy meets himself stroll. Things aren't always what they seem. Can't judge a book by its cover. Sometimes it's not what a teacher says to you but what he does to you. Education isn't limited to the classroom. Pick any sub theme--it has plenty to ponder.

The characterizations were pretty well-done, believable, and refreshingly deep. I've seen, or been, those people, reacting similarly in similar situations.

I had seen John Houseman in a number of TV guest roles and he was always typecast in ""arisocratic bad guy"" roles, the looming intimidating Brit or brahmin. The northeastern equivalent of the way Logan Ramsey always played Southern big shots who called you ""boy"" in that menacing tone. Timothy Bottoms had always struck me as the ""spare Ryan O'Neal"" and Lindsay Wagner wasn't yet the Bionic Woman. So I wasn't expecting much. Especially since neither I nor my ex were lawyer buffs.

Bottoms stars as James Hart, a Harvard Law student who is getting into the phase where law school starts to really get tough. Where certain professors take on the aspects of deities. Wagner plays Hart's girlfriend, as well as (unbeknownst to Hart until he's getting serious about her) the daughter of his most feared professor Charles Kingsfield, played by this film's real star John Houseman. He's one of those classroom tyrants who verbally and coldly dissects students the way a Biology prof would do a frog. For example (no way am I going to drop a full-fledged ""spoiler"" in here), watch for the scene where Kingsfield nails Hart's classmate (and Kingsfield wannabe"" of his study group), the oafish know-it-all Bell, who disagrees with the fairness of an inheritance law called ""The Dead Man Statute"". I guarantee you will fall out laughing the way the rest of the class did at Kingsfield's punch line. Houseman steals the whole show in the film in general, so much that a two-season TV series was spun off from this film, with Houseman billed as the lead.

1187355,2,B000005QHG,"The Paper Chase, 1973 film

The film begins with a view of as the students enter. This is Harvard Law School, one of the oldest and most prestigious in the country. Never assume anything in my class. This class is on contract law and damages for broken contracts (business life in any country). Youve got to work like hell for good grades. First-year students form study groups to collaborate by sharing a work load. The Socratic Method is used: questioning and answering (tests the student). There are no final and absolute answers. The students divide their work load. [Note their smoking.] The movie focuses on a few students. The class is divided into three groups of students. We learn about contracts, selling and buying (life in society). Is Hart slacking off? He falls asleep during daylight hours. Later he learns about Susan, her mothers sickness, and her estranged husband. [Note the student seating chart with pictures. Was this called a face-book?

Professor Charles W. Kingsfield Jr. asks questions that require analyzing the facts. These answers won't be found in a book. Hart visits Susan in her fathers rooms. Kingsfield returns unexpectedly (or was this a trick of Susans?). Hart is out in the cold. Are people irrational? Can Hart walk on water? [Until the ice breaks.] The statute of frauds is the law in every state. One student has a problem; can he be saved? Hart learns about the stored opinions of Kingsfield. Can they access his notebooks? Hart and Susan meet in a stadium. [To provide realism to this movie.] The courts follow the laws written by the legislature. The Dead Mans Statute can be gotten around. [What is this?] Hart is offered an assignment for research over the weekend. [Biting off more than he can chew?] He learns a lesson. The study group loses a student. There is a personal conflict over the outlines. One student spends long hours studying late into the night. More questions and answers in class. Court decisions are based on precedent in the Common Law system.

Kevin is not well. Hart takes away his .22 rifle. Hart does not answer Kingsfield in class, then answers back (for drama). The final exam arrives. Students seek Harts advice (a sign of recognized expertise). They want a quiet place to study without interruption. A maid hears them talking about criminal law? Will there be a problem? Can Room Service be suspended? [Note the technique used to avoid reaching the manager.] And so they take the test. How did Hart do? He doesnt open his envelope, just throws it away! [Is this believable?]

Many of the actors would become more famous on television shows. This movie was later turned into a television series. How much of an audience is there for a drama about graduate students? There have been TV shows about law firms (The Practice) but they were not as popular as crime shows, like Law and Order. In the late 1950s there was a popular series about a lawyer (Perry Mason), then Matlock. Could a series about defense lawyers be popular today? Laws tell about the Ruling Class. Can you work at home? Can you grow food or raise animals? That depends on the Zoning Laws. Supermarkets don't want people to grow their own food.",1314921600,2,3184,4.783636363636363

1187357,4,B000005QHG,"This film was a sleeper hit in the early 70's, and in some ways it still is as a DVD. While there are some obvious brief moments where the film is dated, the big themes of human interaction and the struggle to achieve success against long odds are universal and timeless. Too many ""critics"" try to pick apart this film for silly reasons (such as that it only shows the students in one professor's class, contract law), but they are completely missing the point. ""The Paper Chase"" is not a primer on going to law school, it is an entertaining couple of hours about human nature, and most people in most walks of life can see some direct correlation to a similar period of their own lives. You don't have to go to law school or be a lawyer to enjoy this film, but I'm told that many law schools to this day recommend that their incoming first-year law students see ""The Paper Chase"", mostly to set the stage for what they will deal with in their quest to achieve their goals. Of course, not every law school is Harvard Law, but it is the Harvard legend that makes this film so fascinating. The two most redeeming features of this really entertaining movie are John Houseman and Timothy Bottoms, both of whom are superbly cast and play off of one another brilliantly. This was Houseman's ""breakthrough"" role at age 71, and he went on to great fame and fortune as a result of this one film. A beautiful young Lindsay Wagner also adds a nice touch as Timothy Bottoms' on-again/off-again love interest with a twist.

""Look, he's got you scared to death.  Oh, you're going to pass because you're the kind the law school wants.  You'll get your little diploma, your piece of paper that's no different from this and you can stick it in your silver box with all the other paper in your life: your birth certificate, your driver's license, your marriage license, your stock certificates, and your Will.""

The above comes from this extremely entertaining movie that tells the story of Hart (Timothy Bottoms), a first-year law student at Harvard Law School (in Cambridge, Massachusetts), and his experiences with Professor Kingsfield (John Houseman), the brilliant, demanding contract law instructor whom he both idolizes and finds very intimidating.  Hart's and Kingsfield's academic relationship grows even more complex when Hart discovers the woman he's dating is the professor's married daughter (Lindsay Wagner).

In the above quotation, the professor's daughter (named Susan) is talking to Hart.  The ""he"" in ""he's got you scared to death"" is Professor Kingsfield.  She holds up a package of toilet paper when she says ""that's no different from this.""

This movie is based on the novel ""The Paper Chase"" (1970) by John Jay Osborn, Jr. who is now a novelist, lawyer, and law professor.  (In fact, Osborn is now at The University of San Francisco School of Law where he teaches, among other subjects, contract law.)  This movie follows the novel very closely.

Hart, at the beginning of the year, is invited into a study group with five other first year law students.  Even though the story specifically follows Hart, it generally follows the other group members as well.  By the time final exams come along, only three of six of these law students remain in the study group.

The study group members are:

(1) Hart
(2) Ford (""King Bow-Tie S**t"")
(3) Kevin (who's proud to have a ""photographic memory"")
(4) Anderson (""the robot pimp"")
(5) Bell (""as in Liberty Bell"")
(6) O'Connor (""just a little pimp"")

The acting could scarcely be better.  Yes, Bottoms and Wagner do a good job.  Houseman (aged 71) does a superlative job.  (In fact, he won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  That's pretty good considering that this was his first major movie role.)  I also have to give kudos to the others who portrayed law students in the study group such as Edward Herrmann (as Anderson) and James Naughton (as Kevin).

I also enjoyed the classical music excerpts by Bach and Telemann.  These were added at the right moment to enhance certain scenes.

This movie conveys many messages to the viewer (some of which may get some viewers angry).  One is the impersonal nature of law school.  Thus, everybody is referred to by their last name.  Even Susan talks to Hart using his last name.  Since the character Kevin is referred to mainly by his first name, you know something is going to happen to him (and it does).

A challenge to the viewer (or at least to this viewer) is to try and figure out the full names of Kingsfield and the study group members (if possible).  By carefully listening and observing I learned Kingsfield's and Hart's first name and middle initial.  I also learned Anderson's first name and Kevin's last name.  As well, I did discover Bell's first initial.

I forgot to mention that one of the things each study group member had to do, before final exams, was to prepare a course outline.  The challenge is to figure out what course each group member was outlining.  I managed to deduce what all six study group members were outlining.  (Actually, I'm absolutely sure what four group members were outlining and fairly sure what the remaining two group members were outlining.)

This movie spawned a television series that lasted for four seasons.

One thing I've read is that this movie is only for law students and lawyers.  NO.  This movie is for anybody that wants to experience what it's like to learn a large amount of information in a relatively short amount of time.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2003) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has two extras: an audio commentary and theatrical trailer.  (Note that on the back of the DVD case, Kingsfield is referred to as ""Knightsfield."")

In conclusion, this is one of those few movies that is honest and intelligent.  I leave you with the words Kingsfield says when students first enter his class:

""You teach yourselves the law but I train your mind.  You come in here with a skull full of mush and you leave thinking like a lawyer.""

1187393,4,B000005QHG,"The Bottom Line:

A film about post-grad life that hasn't dated much at all in the last 30 years and provides an interestingly mature look at the life of Law School students with few scenes that ring false (though the lead's romance with his professor's daughter isn't as good as the classroom sequences), The Paper Chase is a good little film which affirms my belief that films set in school are almost neverboring.

The movie does have good qualities about it by showing you how a law school environment works and the kind of stress that a beginning law school student is going to be under...but, the movie is just boring.  Blehhhhhhhhh....I couldn't wait until it finally reached it's climax and conclusion.

It's worth checking out if you're going to be going to go to law school.  I saw it AFTER my first year...so I guess the movie didn't have as great an impact on me as it would have had if I would have watched it BEFORE starting law school.",1243728000,,899,4.102857142857143

1187398,5,B000005QHG,"I am an older student who just finished my first year of law school. The film is right on when it depicts the battle for your soul--will you be master of your fate and choose to do the work, or will you be driven by fear and insecurity and be enslaved to it? I experienced a little of both, and I do not want to spoil the film by revealing more to any who are trying to decide whether to buy or rent it. I heartily recommend it to anyone struggling with a self-imposed challenge.

I would have wished that the film show more of the process of learning to ""think like a lawyer"" and what that actually means - turning the facts of the case over and over, looking for points to the advantage of either side, and weighing the relative strength of those arguments. However, I do commend the film for showing a little bit of the feeling I quite unexpectedly experienced of being part of a line going back to the Magna Carta, examining the value of a human being and her freedom and the needs of society and searching for the ever-evolving meaning of justice.

As for the relationship between Kingsfield and Hart--my main professor was nothing like Kingsfield, but I did experience something eerily similar, right down to the last scene.

One last aside-A previous reviewer noted the absence of the Carbolic Smoke Ball case from his edition of West--it is certainly in mine and is a very important case with regard to defining the law of a public offer.",1238198400,5,1446,4.449056603773585
1187399,5,B000005QHG,"This is one of my favorite movies and showcases a fabulous performance by John Houseman, who was asked at the last minute to act the part.  Other stars,including James Mason, John Gielgud, and Edward G. Robinson had been asked to take the lead but refused, so finally director James Bridges asked his mentor Houseman to take the role.  And Houseman won an Oscar for it as Best Supporting Actor!  He fills the role with dignity and intellect and thoroughly intimidates Timothy Bottoms starring as an eager law student from Minnesota.  The film is also the debut of Lindsay Wagner, see mostly doing mattress commercials these days, but she really is a good actress.  The film is set at Harvard Law School but since the school hated the publicity from ""Love Story"", also set on the famous Cambridge campus, most of ""Paper Chase"" was filmed in Toronto.  The movie has many touching and amusing moments and carries you along briskly to the end where the filmmakers finally hit a false note.  I understand what the characters were doing but it struck me as out of character and I never found the ending very satisfying.  That said, the film still has so much to offer including a fun score by John Williams from early in his brilliant career.

A first year law student, Timothy Bottoms, is not satisfied with getting what his professor has to teach him about contract law; he is driven to get the professor to recognize him as an individual. His professor is like the old school football coach; He doesn't care if you like him, but you will be a great football player when he is done with you. Houseman, plays the professor to perfection even with a slight hint, but nothing revealed, of a human being. The high levels of anxiety and competition, that are awash in ego, is depicted through Bottoms' fellow students. Modest story, but a great cast of characters.",1229385600,2,706,4.8429752066115705

The only downside to this DVD is the limited features, which are the trailer and commentary.

1187425,3,B000005QHG,"Some intelligent youngsters study law. Not just anywhere, no, but in Harvard!! This movie tells a coming of age story that made me feel rather uncomfortable. The reason: bright kids are depicted as snooty and the same time impressionable. Their being undergraduates is a stage they are going through, but the thought about where they were headed made my hairs stand on end. They do not seem to have a shred of idealism left at the start (could be a reason to study law, theoretically) and it does not look like they will get it back the rest of their lives. They try to impress a pompous lecturer whose sole purpose seems to consist in intimidating undergraduates. The main character beds the lecturer's daughter who, besides, seems to do nothing but wait for her divorce to get through - her dad's handling it, ""of course"". The movie is beautiful, but the world in it rather ugly. Strangely, the only likeable person in it is the wife of the most interesting and best constructed character of the movie, the undergraduate with a photographic memory who is intelligent enough to know that he will not make the grade in Harvard. Non lawyers will not like lawyers more after having seen this movie.",1214956800,2,1196,4.7

It touches on everything: the pressure to succeed; what students you can trust and what others to run like hell from; and, of course, the professor everyone fears. My Kingsfield (or Perini from the book One L) was in Constitutional Law.

The one scene I found plainly unbelievable was the finale where Hart folds his grades into a paper airplane without looking at them. That just doesn't happen. If nothing else, the typical law student HAS to know how he did after going through what he went through during the year.

The suspense in The Paper Chase is whether or not he and the members of his group of study will manage to pass under the overpowering rule of professor Charles Kingsfield, which is a truly unforgettable character and made the actor John Houseman win an Oscar for Best Supporting Role. Believe me, you have to see him to believe him, there are no accurate descriptions adequate enough to tell you how good he is. I also very much like the fact that being this a film about the study of law, it doesn't deal with criminal law, which any one might have think was the more interesting subject of that career. Instead, it deals with Contract Law, which I, before seeing this picture, would have thought was a very boring subject. This shows that you can make something good out of any subject.

The movie is not a masterpiece but is interesting from a graduate student's perspective.  The ability to see the pressures involved and to see how relationships are played out is an interesting side story.  The best scenes are in the classroom and in the study groups.

Set in one of the most demanding environments--Harvard Law School--the film portrays learning at its most intense, where the depth and breadth of the curriculum represents a marathon, testing the brain and body's endurance.

1187447,4,B000005QHG,"There are plenty of movies with a little romance, a little drama, and a little comedy.  This movie is special because it portrays law school is such an entertaining, and somewhat accurate manner.  It also explores the themes that we all constantly wrestle with, our natural intelligence, hard work, or ultimate capabililties, and what we are willing to sacrifice to get ahead.

The feckless and overly orthodox law professors that pollute the halls and classrooms of our nation's institutes of higher legal learning won't teach you as much about law school as this film will.  The professor who appears in this film acutally explains his teaching methodology, the antiquated Socratic Method, which inspires students to learn and read through fear, which amounts to pointless question and answer sessions, which baffles students who once believed themselves to be intelligent before they were humiliated in front of their class!

Professor Kingsfield's lectures and question and answer sessions in this film are frightening and are timeless displays of eloquence, much like Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in Full Metal Jacket.  This movie, like no other, explores the fear and stress that law school students feel as they try to chase the paper, as they try to chase the grade.

Our protaganist goes through the same struggles as real law students, as he must decide between personal and school.  Will he chase the girl that he is falling in love with?  Or will he spend the weekend studying?  Will he become the silent law school student that hopes that he does not get called on, or will he burn the midnight oil and become part of the upper echelon of law school students that savor the spotlight and volunteer to be participants in the feared Socratic nightmare?  Will he fall prey to the paper chase and sell his sould to get the grade?  You'll see law students crack, you'll see friendships fail, you'll see betrayal and competition, and you'll see disappointment in the face of the student that just can't hack it.

You'll get a sense of the conflict that is played out in the minds of those students who have the natural ability, but are conflicted whether or not they want to put in the work and take the pain that is necessary to succeed in law school and be at the top of their class.

The movie is entertaining, humorous, and the best part of all are the interactions between students and the sharp, aggressive law professor.",1181088000,5,2430,4.852300242130751

People can pass all the time in class, say i don't know, and NOTHING happens to them, indeed nobody even cares or looks up from playing games on their laptops.

Let me not waste any words.  John Houseman, an exceptionally talented founding member of Orson Welles' troupe, and respected director/actor since that era, is both delightful and outstanding as the humorless, unbending, venerable and universally familiar Harvard Law icon, Professor Kingsfield. The movie is a professional job and has other aspects to recommend it, but Houseman and his character as written in a clearly insightful script, is the perennial draw to this tribute to positive, life-altering student/teacher tension.

The rest of the story reflects the American college-centered moral popularism of the late 1960s -- but is still relevant, as it is pitted against the really much more weighty and unshakable philosophy enshrined in the principles and the person of Professor Kingsfield.

This is worth seeing.",1166572800,3,951,5.448979591836735

Your friends joke about how your Contracts professor (or any professor) is imitating Kingsfield.  You wonder why anyone would be so asinine to hide a book in a law library.  You scoff and worry about the advice not to date anyone in your section, your law school, or your immediate vicinity period.  If anyone told me that this movie would answer some of those questions and worries so poignantly, and do it in a way that would prove entertaining -- even to those wise/foolish enough to avoid pursuing a J.D. -- I would not have believed it.  This movie has everything and then some for a curious 1L or for anyone wanting a more sobering film about law school that's not Legally Blonde I/II.

This small film won actor/producer John Houseman his  best supporting Oscar for his playing the character of Professor Kingsfield. I start off with that fact because you can see this fact while the film unfolds before you. This movie  is John Houseman tout de force all the way. Kingsfield plays a teacher's  teacher..he runs the students thru their paces.

 Timothy Bottoms plays Hart, a young law student who is dazed by all the excitement of his first year. He meets Susan ( who isa played by a very young, prew-Bionic Woman Lindsay Wagner) who Hart finds out is Kingsfield's daughter.

It is an amazing character study of the first year of law school and those who teach them. Note this film also has the talents of James Naughton and Edward Herrmann in their early tv/film careers.

It represents the ideal college experience, before racial quotas and forced equality spread mediocrity to academia. Tim Bottoms plays the Horatio Alger figure, rising on his own efforts. John Houseman, depicts the hard-nosed Establishment professor to perfection. The lovely, appealing Lindsey Wagner as Prof. Kingsfield's daughter, plays a sort of siren of a girlfriend, always beckoning Bottoms closer to self-destruction or freedom. The study group was comprised of various grades of intelligence and cunning with a common goal, with edges of ""Animal House"" lurking. This adaption of John Jay Osborn's novel will stand for that period when achievement was earned according to one's merit or effort, not artificial, arbitrary quotas.

I was in law school (not Harvard!) when it was released and I also had a Professor Kingsfield-type for contracts.  The types of students, the competition, the panic about grades and exams, it's all here.  I've asked some newer lawyers, and the majority said that it still reflects their law school experience. There may be some schools out there that are different, but I still think that anyone thinking of a legal career should watch this movie.  One of the messages for Lawyer Wannabees is that even brilliant people may not have minds suitable to succeed in the law (Timothy Bottoms comments that a friend was really smart and wanted to go to Harvard Law but didn't do as well on the LSATs...lawyers all know someone similar, and can tell you about people who got into law school and then either fail on the curve or drop out -- there's a lot more to getting a J.D. than just being smart enough to get into a law school).  Surprisingly, the age of the movie doesn't get in the way of the messages described so well in the other reviews.  If I didn't know it was released in 1973, it would still appear pretty current (except for typewriters instead of computers and no cell phones!).  No funky 60 cars, the clothes are pretty much back in style, and there are even similar hairstyles in my kids' high school and colleges today.

I loved Kingsfield's Arrogance, earned Arrogance.  It amazes me that some people can achieve so much greatness (yes, I know this is just a movie), but as the first reviewer said, these old men still walk the halls of Harvard (and every other prestigious University in this country).

Hart's innocence and his experience learning (I really enjoyed the TV series, and this to the downfall of TV, that such a great series did not last, or at least barely made it into syndication on Public TV for a short time)

The young married student, sorry I have forgotten his name, the one with the ""Photographic Memory""...  I loved it when he went over to the 3-L student's house, and the student gave him a hypothetical to work up and he'd figure out where his shortcomings in the Law were, and he'd help him merely from the answers he gives to the hypothetical.

1187494,5,B000005QHG,"I saw this movie as an undergraduate and found it even more resonant when I got into graduate school. Although I did not study law, this movie will feel all too real for someone in an intensive post-undergraduate program. The life of the post-Bachelor's individual is truly terrifying. It's not for the weak of heart. The Paper Chase captures the world of academic stress wonderfully. All the issues are represented here: Do I have time to date? If I do, will a lover understand the need to pull an all-nighter on the weekend to finish a paper? Do my professors really expect me to finish this reading? For the serious student, life is far more like the Paper Chase than Back to School or Animal House. It's lonely, hard work, and your girlfriend will hate you sometimes for ignoring her so you can hit the books. And your professors will sometimes leave you twisting in the wind if you can't carry your own weight. Some grad school advisors are indeed like Kingsfield, thus the Houseman character is not a myth. John Houseman gets most of the good lines in this movie, but not all. Take the student lines like ""Nothing makes you hornier than studying"" or the exchange between Hart (I found it funny that even Hart's girlfrend calls him by his last name) and the failing Kevin that goes (I'm paraphrasing here), Hart: ""They're just grades, Kevin."" Kevin: ""You know better than that. It's a grade, it's a number, but it determines futures."" Paper Chase is at times painful to watch, as Hart endures flak on all sides--from his girlfriend to Kingsfield to his ""supportive"" study group. Hart does well because he's the classic good college student: an ambitious overachiever. He isn't the smartest necessarily, but he cares the most. But in the end, Kingsfield shows that no one ever will get inside his head. The struggle between professor and student is the heart of education. No college film treats colleges as honestly or intelligently as the Paper Chase. Watch it on the same bill with one of the slob college movies. Animal House is for the heathen in us. Paper Chase is for the Puritan.",1126828800,9,2091,4.700272479564033
1187495,5,B000005QHG,"This a good film.  I'm in law school and ironically enough, nearly everyone in law school has had a Professor Kingfield.  I sure did, and she was my Contracts professor (they always seem to be the Contracts profs).  I guess Contracts is the whipping post for 1L indoctrination.  Anyway, the 70's look and feel to the film has a fun, nostalgic feel.  The law school observations are dead-on.  For example, the paranoia that one is smart but clearly not smart enough, a Contracts professor that speaks an entirely different language, paranoia over grades, the pathetic desire to impress one's instructors, etc.  It's all here.  It is also true to life.  Some of the plotting is jacked up for dramatic purposes (e.g., the guy that wants to commit suicide because he is failing), but it captures the spirit of law school.  It's entertaining too.  Enjoy.  It's worth a look.",1126224000,4,869,4.797297297297297
1187496,3,B000005QHG,"Like many other reviewers I measured this movie against my own law school experience.  In the early 70's law school was very politicized, a reality conveniently ignored in this movie.  Thus, while Hart, played by Timothy Bottoms, has the signature long hair of 70's social concern his character is left to joust with the vagaries of all-too-selfish love and desire, rather than meaning.

Like a child seeking his stern father's approaval, the main character cultishly devotes himself to professor Kingsfield (John Houseman), the aloof, high-priest of Harvard Law School and Hart is content to vie to join the privileged hierarchy of the Church of the Bar.

What we receive is a conformist messages from the film: It is enough to look the part of integrity and principle but in the end the only solution is to capitulate in the face of tradition and academia.  I would have preferred a dialogue between these two forces, outsider and insider.  That there is no struggle other than to master the arcane language of English common law says it all.  Driven to despair and exhaustion one dreams only of success.  The only option that seems available is to save oneself from drowning in a sea of overwhelm as happens to the unfortunate character of Kevin who, in the book, turns his despair and his shotgun on himself.

I would have been equally disappointed had Bottoms' character been the onesided presence in the film.  While Houseman reaches greatness, the script is hobbled and reminds us too much that we are unwilling to strive for real dialogue which is the true depth of the Socratic method.

The canned relationship between Hart and Susan is another aspect of chosing safety and cliche over maturity and worked for intimacy.

What a shame that the excellence of Houseman's acting didn't spill over into the whole endeavor of the film.  What a tribute to individual tallent and devotion.  Ironically, Houseman (according to the producer's commentary) was only ever considered for the film by chance.  The 21 year old co-producer met him and, even though Houseman had never acted before, the young man saw in him the image of Kingsfield.  Maybe that freshness of perception, along side the tragedy that can be the system, is the greatest legacy of the film.",1121212800,6,2259,4.905263157894737

If you are thinking about going to Law School, see this film if you have time between reading canned briefs. The ""Little Questions that tumble in your brain are really there.

1187498,4,B000005QHG,"Having attended Law School myself, I can vouch for the fact that it is typically a very special experience in one's life, perhaps not quite like any other.  The first year of law school in particular is often a jarring and transformative experience.  This is the theme of this film, which is a quite good, if perhaps slightly overdone, story about a small group of law students' first year in law school.  Law school is shown to be a ruthless process of competition and weeding out, where the professors take students who have ""a skull full of mush ...."" and teach them how to ""think like a lawyer...!""

John Houseman turns in a classic performance as Professor Kingsfield, the brilliant, stern, and unforgiving Contracts professor, whom law student Timothy Bottoms comes to idolize.  Bottoms' attempt to succeed in Kingsfield's brutal Contracts classroom, where students are put on the spot and roasted on a daily basis, is the basic theme of this film.

Although (typical of so many Hollywood films) this film overdramatizes the law school experience, it nevertheless does capture the essence of what is usually a unique experience for those who undergo it.  I doubt that there is an American law school student for the last 30 years who has failed to see this film--it is a legend among law students.  And the wider American audience seems to have appreciated it as well.

An excellent film that most viewers will appreciate.",1114214400,9,1428,4.867768595041323

Timothy Bottoms is a Harvard Law School freshman in love with both his no-nonsense, unaccessible law professor (John Houseman) and the professor's daughter (Linda Wagner). Bottoms keeps skirting back and forth between making the grade in school and being more intersted in learning for its own sake. When at the end of the movie he folds his term grades up into a paper airplane without looking at them we're supposed to believe he's made the ""wise"" choice - but it's all pretty phony.

Lots of things in the picture don't wear very well anymore, and much of it seems vapid. Houseman as Professor Kingsfield is the only character worth watching. And, of course, like most school flicks it looks as if Bottoms is enrolled in only this one course (STAND AND DELIVER had the same problem). The movie tries to make certain points, like it's just a class, don't let the pressure kill you, but it doesn't make them very well or convincingly.

Listen to Robert C. Thompson's commentary.  It's the best commentary I've heard yet for a movie on DVD.  He tells you all you need to know-from the movie studio balking at making ""a movie about a bunch of lawyers"" to Lindsay Wagner's affectless performance.  The key to liking this movie depends completely on 2 things:  1)Can you transport yourself to the early 70s enviroment of Harvard Law School without letting the 'time travel' affect your opinion of the movie, and, 2)Can you get into the characters and their relationships with one another enough to appreciate great performances all around (minus Wagner's)?  I love 70s movies myself.  They're 'brown' and don't rely on constant cutaways to interest the viewer.  Whether you were there or not, 70s movies made an indelible mark on cinema.  Whether you like 'The Paper Chase' or not doesn't matter.  It still stands as one of those movies.  People will still be discussing it in 20 years, and beyond.",1111881600,4,1145,5.037234042553192
1187520,3,B000005QHG,"For those to whom college is more about the love of learning than the freedom to party (this reviewer tended to fall somewhere in between) this is a pretty good film about the rigors of law school, but perhaps still not a great one.  Some of the fault may lie with lead actor Timothy Bottoms, who doesn't entirely succeed in drawing us in.  A better actor (or in any case a better script) would have made us really care about his fate, but Bottoms remains a bit of a cipher, as do most of the characters in this story.  Houseman, of course, plays this perfectly, but we aren't supposed to understand him -he's from another generation and almost another world.

This story was the blueprint for many ""training"" movies made since - a small cadre of competitive young bucks are thrust together to master some skill that will push them to the limits of their abilities.  They're different types from different backgrounds, a girlfriend, a wife, and maybe a death or two among them.  But we aren't training fighter pilots here, it's Harvard Law School, where the most exciting thing that happens is getting called on in class, so viewers should be prepared for the fact that there's really no action.  Which is not to say that this isn't an interesting film (certainly the best film ever made on the subject of Studying Contract Law) but this is not ""Top Gun"", or ""Officer and a Gentleman"" or even ""Meatballs"" and it would be a mistake to let the film's accolades convince one otherwise.

The real power of this story is with the students who fall by the wayside, unable to compete in an environment where competition is everything.  Their story has a ""Death of a Salesman"" punch that really has to carry the film, since very little actually happens to Bottoms' character.  His relationship with the professor's daughter is very shakily presented - one suspects that scenes between them were cut, because they often shift gears inexplicably.

Ultimately there's a problem of artistic distance.  Director James Bridges assumes we will relate to the bearded, hippie-ish, privileged intellectual Bottoms, whose grades will determine whether he becomes one of the men who run the world, or whether he will be forced to settle for merely being inordinately wealthy.  Those who relate best (real-life lawyers and law-students should be shoe-ins) can be excused for loving this film, but many others will surely see these characters as detestably greedy, self-centered, and elitist.  High-school teachers and college professors can expect to see some recognizable characters and pick up a few tips on the Socratic teaching method, which might make the experience worth their while.  But women should be unsurprised to find that they are only bit players in this story, and as for minorities, there's none of the diversity we've come to expect in modern films - people of color are completely absent.

1187521,5,B000005QHG,"Professor Kingsfield's use of the socratic method is actually a combination of the traditional socratic approach with the case study method. This approach is still common in many law schools. One of my dear history profs. in college taught socratically, but the approach made demands on the students. Socratic Method is still great for some other disciplines like religious studies, philosophy, and literature. However, the method presupposes an active student, not merely a student has is committed to doing only the minimum required for an A or B.

  In the movie, the great John Houseman plays Dr. Kingsfield, the world's leading scholar of contract law. His use of the Socratic method is sadistic and terrifying, but Kingsfield is nothing compared to a real-life showboat judge or irascible judge. Students must survive Kingsfield if they are to make it in the real world of the courtroom. The plotline of the movie follows the first year of student James Hart, who idolizes Kingsfield. Hart's dedication to law is tested when he gets a girlfriend, and then discovers her secret, all while trying to keep up in a frighteningly competitive environment.",1100217600,5,1155,5.132978723404255

1187524,3,B000005QHG,"If you want to be inspired to go to Harvard Law School or Harvard Business School (they both use the same intimidating case study technique), this is the film to watch. It is the fear of having your name called out by the professor -- from the hundred students in the lecture theatre -- with his request that you lay out the case, that drives you to prepare well into the early hours the night before.
Harvard is ultra-competitive -- it marks on a bell curve, with the bottom x% of students being automatically chucked out. (That x% may be 10%. The film doesn't spell it out, perhaps because 1973 cinema-goers weren't ready for lectures on the normal distribution.)
The law school culture clashed conspicuously with the student background of the 60s/70s -- i.e. drugs, rock and roll, protests about Vietnam etc -- although little is made of this in the film. Instead we follow a year in the life of Hart, the Nice-but-Bright law student who idolises Professor Kingsfield -- determined to know everything about him, to the extent of bedding his daughter (played by Lindsay Wagner in her pre-Bionic Woman form).
In this film, the lecture theatre experience (studying Contract Law with the Prof) turns out to be a breeze, compared to participating in the Study Group, which contains some really unlikeable individuals. By the end, three of the six students have dropped out of the Study Group -- one even tries to shoot himself.
In the end, this film probably would be better if it didn't try also to be a romance. (I guess it was competing with 'Love Story' at the time.) Its highlights come in the lecture theatre and the study group. This is the potential for a very dark story, and I feel the director missed that opportunity.
On the other hand, no accommodation is made for the audience unfamiliar with contract law -- in other words, there is plenty of technical language -- but this adds to the authority of the drama.
I guess we're unlikely ever to see again the TV series of the same name that this movie spawned. So enjoy this while it's still available. For a similar experience on the page, get hold of a copy of Peter Cohen's 'The Gospel according to the Harvard Business School'.",1081814400,8,2190,4.646907216494846

1187526,4,B000005QHG,"Yeah, great film, holds up well over the years.  But no Harvard law student would have thrown his unopened grades into the ocean.  Particularly one that was as dedicated and competitive as Hart.  It would be like a lawyer trying a case and leaving the courtroom before hearing the verdict.  One can understand and, in a mercenary way, perhaps admire Hart if he pretended not to care about the grades for the sake of impressing his erratic, anti-establishment/anti-hippy girlfriend.  She doesn't make much sense, but she is cute and alluring.  But to actually throw the grades into the sea?  No.
Apart from that, the scenes of the workings of law school are pretty terrific.  The characters of the study group are, for good and bad, very similar to people you actually find at law school.  Particularly Bell.  (By the way, did anyone notice that Hart's 3rd year advisor was Thirtysomething's Miles Drentell?  He is exactly the type that would say, ""Grades matter."")  Yet, like lawyers themselves, they're not on the whole really awful people.  Ford, the quintessential Harvard prepster, bails out James Naughton's character in class and even goes so far as to say that the subject is very difficult to understand.  Hart himself is obviously very decent.  And Kingsfield is meant to be feared, but moreover respected and admired.
So the romance is a bit unrealistic, but nothing approaching Ally McBeal silliness.  That aside, it's a solid film worth seeing more than once.",1067990400,8,1471,4.967213114754099

1187528,5,B000005QHG,"John Houseman was part of the entertainment world for decades, working with such heavyweights as Orsen Welles, but perhaps popularly he will be best remembered for his portrayal of Professor Kingsfield, a conservative, dour Contract Law professor at Harvard Law School, who, for all his professionalism and singleness of purpose, lets a bit of humanity creep out from beneath the surface. Houseman won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for this role.
Timothy Bottoms played Hart, the idealistic young 1-L (first year law student) who comes to Harvard from the midwest primarily because of his fascination with Kingsfield. He forms friendships and relationship with a circle of friends, each of whom is eccentric, driven, and slightly certifiable (which fits most of the law students I've known). His problems increase as he meets and begins a relationship with Kingsfield's daughter (played by Lindsay Wagner).
This movie provided the inspiration for a television series, which followed some of the same characters from the film, in necessarily a different time-frame and different situations. Houseman reprised his role in this, and became a 'star' by this vehicle.
My favourite scene in the film has to be (being the bibiophile that I am) the time Hart breaks into the closed stacks in the library (which contain the personal papers of the professors) to look for Kingsfield's early work, including his original notes from when he was a student in Contracts. Hart's reflection on Kingsfield's philosophical musings ('Can one make a binding contract with God?' Kingsfield had written) almost convinced me to go to law school in America (and indeed, I took the LSAT and did well).
Houseman found the role of Kingsfield a double-edged sword, that, while fueling his stardom and exposure, also obscured the real person behind the role. He became typecast. Even when he went on speaking tours (coming once to my university to speak before a standing-room-only crowd at the auditorium) his Kingsfield routine was what the audience wanted; they tended to drift away as he spoke about his own life, and that was sad.
Make a contract with yourself to see this excellent film, and, should the series be repeated on cable, check that out too. You'll be glad you did, or your money back (contract void wherever prohibited).",1058313600,9,2323,5.1319261213720315

If you realize it's heavily fiction, you can take if for what it is: a unique movie about high stress and how people react to it.  John Houseman is unforgettable as the notorious Prof. Kingsfield.
On the subject of how this movie represents _actual_ law school:
I am currently a law student at a top-20 law school (2003), I have plenty of friends who attend the other top-20 schools in the nation (including Harvard, portrayed here).  Even when this film debuted in 1973 it was considered a high dramatization to strike fear in the non-law student.  If you're considering law school, watch it realizing that.  The Paper Chase shows the darkest view of law school as much as Legally Blonde makes it out to be silly and fun.  Law School is neither: it's that boring movie no one would ever pay to see.
With that side note, the movie is a fun diversion.  Definitely worth the time to see what all the fuss is about.",1052784000,7,1054,4.664864864864865

1187544,5,B000005QHG,"The closest I ever got to Harvard Law School was a graduate class in education law at UC Berkeley. The class was taught by a silver-haired Jesuit, who stood ramrod straight behind his podium at the front of the class and proceded in a manner not unlike John Houseman's Professor Kingsfield. It was only a pale shadow of what is depicted in ""The Paper Chase"", but it was very enlightening. The way this movie vividly brings back my student days, both the fun and the hard work, is one of the reasons I like it so much. It also shows what people can accomplish.
The plot involves a love affair between Hart, a student who idolizes Kingsfield, and Kingsfield's daughter. It has its funny moments, but is somewhat predictable. What elevates this movie  is the psychological study of how the different students respond to their situation, some finding it within themselves to persevere while others fall by the wayside. The film also benefits from strong acting, particularly by John Houseman, who is the quintessential Professor Kingsfield. He is outstanding.
This is an excellent flick. It delivers a dramatic portrayal of an intense academic experience, while delivering some very funny moments along the way. Sort of like real life, sometimes. The TV series spawned by this movie was also quite good, and it's too bad it didn't last longer on its major network.

1187545,5,B000005QHG,"I found myself compelled to write this review for a number of reasons:  (1) I graduated from law school (although not Harvard), (2) My mother and James Bridges were childhood friends, (3) I've been an admirer of John Houseman's work for as long as I can remember, and finally (4) I've watched this movie several times and like it.
Timothy Bottoms stars as James Hart, a midwestern boy literally dumped into his first year of Harvard Law School.  John Houseman is Professor William Kingsfield, a curmudgeonly contract law professor about whom Hart has ambivalent feelings of dread and admiration. Lindsay Wagner is Kingsfield's daughter, with whom Hart is having a relationship.
This picture brought the so-called Socratic method of instruction into the light of day and doubtlessly inspired many professors of subjects other than the law.  It no doubt also inspired many impressionable young men to consider a career in the law (as it did me).  But the reason to really enjoy this movie is neither of those...it's Houseman's electrifying performance that netted him an Academy Award for best supporting actor.  This film also stands as a testament to the short but spectacular directorial career of the late James Bridges, who went on to direct ""The China Syndrome"" and ""Urban Cowboy"" among several other films.
It should also be remembered that this picture inspired a short-lived CBS television series of the same name in which Houseman reprised the Kingsfield role.  The show spawned the careers of, among others, Jon Lovitz of Saturday Night Live fame and Jane Kaczmarek (of the TV series ""Malcolm in the Middle"") and after its rather short-sighted cancellation by CBS was picked by Showtime, who ordered new episides, giving the series another five years of life until discontinued in 1984.
Did this picture have an impact?  Absolutely.  Was it good?  You bet!  And to James Bridges, wherever you are ""thanks for the career advice...and hello from my mom!""",987465600,28,1961,5.062111801242236

I have found that students want to form study groups and create outlines for each individual courses and share them with the members of the group.  The same type of stress and desire was felt among these same students.

I watched the first 3 seasons of The Paper Chase one after another and was disappointed that Season 4 had not yet been released, and then stumbled onto the Movie which led to a series. Whereas the series had 59+ hours to develop characters and story lines, the movie just had a little less than 2 hours to do the same.

For me I couldn't get enough of Professor Kingsfield so I jumped at the opportunity to buy the movie and watch it. Not having read the book I can't say how much the Movie or the Series deviated from the book, but I am glad that there was a movie since there may not have been a series without it. Timothy Bottoms is the original James T. Hart but for me the real James T. Hart is James Stephens as we had a chance to see him in 59 episodes.",1518652800,,886,3.9441340782122905

7903454,5,B000005QHG,I love this movie. It is great! Houseman gives a great performance. I watched this when it first came out. I watched the series faithfully. If you buy this make sure it is unabridged. The 'shrouding' scene is extremely important to the film and to the character of Hart. I bought this on vhs which is thankfully was unabridged.,1513296000,,327,4.559322033898305

7903458,3,B000005QHG,"That this inspired the series is its best recommendation.
John Housman is an exceptional performer and carries this character into the series.
The students in this movie are not quite up to the fullness of character that series students portrai.
But they do have their moments.",1503014400,,277,5.043478260869565
