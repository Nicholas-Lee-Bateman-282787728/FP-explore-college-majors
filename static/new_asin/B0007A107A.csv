As a minor drawback I'd have wished it show some striking techniques too..",1226880000,,245,4.590909090909091
8046420,1,B0007A107A,"The instructor has great experience and well skilled, unfortunately, the making of this DVD is very weak. In summary:
1- Camera position is always at the wrong place
2- Lighting is very weak, so dark
3- Not enough explained the techniques
4- The style is more of a class training, which makes it less interesting for someone who want details of skills

In conclusion:
I would not recommend this particular DVD for existing jujitsu guys, its nice for someone who just would like to have an idea about the game or more interested in self-defense",1182816000,,543,4.71578947368421
8046421,5,B0007A107A,"This is good real good. Both Masters are very skilled and definetly know street fighting and what to do when your life is on the line. The combination of having Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Sambo is a real powerful mix and the groundfighting techniques gave me what I was looking for, how to fight on the ground and survive. I spent a lot of time in Tae Kwon Do and Boxing and always felt concerned as to what to do if I didn't take the guy out and the fight went to the pavement. Not anymore this 2 DVD set has all the answers. Anyone looking for ground fighting techniques will find all they need on these 2 DVDs.",1109980800,14,610,4.1344537815126055
