8684994,5,B00OU5E0TS,"This Danish series is one of the best we've seen from any country. Every single episode is top notch, compelling stories, brilliant writing, extraordinarily competent acting and directing. Not a single blinker in the bunch. The pacing is just right. There are no dead spots but yet the main characters still have time to be totally real complicated human beings without that level of character developement taking away from the narrative. We see many such series and this one stands out as being among the best.",1516492800,,511,4.953488372093023
8684995,2,B00OU5E0TS,"This is billed as a Danish film in the tradition of The Killing and Borgen, two magnificent series.  Forget it and save your money: This is a ""B"" at best.  There is simply nothing inspired about it.  We get a lot of rolling in the hay and feminism, but little else.  Nancy Drew Reporter on TCM is just as deep and more entertaining.",1492387200,4,332,4.222222222222222

8684997,3,B00OU5E0TS,There are many elements of the series I enjoyed but that's offset by the overdramatization by Dicte the main character  and her obsessive self centeredness. She seems to be a very conflcted person who  plays the victim to the detriment of family and friends.  Dicte in stressful situations typically overreacts and lashes out at those who love her. In summary it seems no incident or tragedy causes her to behave like a mature adult. As a result I tired of the series and did not finish.,1480032000,2,487,4.6395348837209305
8684998,5,B00OU5E0TS,"dicte  is an eye opening female lead character in a well acted gripping (several-season long)  series that does not devolve into mere soap opera but comes to a satisfying end point.  English subtitles do not detract and the Danish sensibility is enlightening, not just predictable sleeping pill plotting.",1479600000,,304,5.291666666666667
8684999,5,B00OU5E0TS,"Dicte is a wounded soul struggling to be a different kind of mother than hers. She is a victim of an overly religious upbringing. Because she had a child out of wedlock, her Jehovahs Witnesses parents took her baby and shunned her. This however is not the main focus of the series, but the thing that both haunts and drives her.

Having divorced, Dicte Svendsendeftly played by Iben Hjejlehas returned to her hometown of Aarhus where she works as a crime reporter for the newspaper Dagbladet. She lives with her teenage daughter (Emilie Kruse). Her close friends are played by Lene Maria Christensen and Laerke Winther Andersen. One is pregnant with a cheating husband, the other works at a hospital. I particularly liked Anderson's performance. She has a compelling presence. Its difficult to look away when shes in a scene. TV Dicte 2

In the first season Dicte discovers the body of a woman who died after a C-section. She meets Inspector Wagner (Lars Brygmann, Robert Festival Best Actor nominee) and becomes involved in the investigation. Wagner isn't immediately enamored by Dicte saying at one point, partially serious, that she should be monitored by the police. Her need to find the truth and report it often intrudes into his inquiry. Brygmann is a delight to watch, his character can be both sensitive and annoyed simultaneously. His is a subtle performance with powerful emotions he tries to hide. He longs for more time with his son who left for the States with his Hollywood mother. Brygmann lives alone in a sterile house he almost never inhabits.

At the newsroom, Dicte is in almost constant conflict with her editor who in reality actually gets her. In season two, characters leave and are replaced, leaving one wondering if Dicte has a future in this job, but I won't tell tales out of the office.

Dar Salim plays Bo Skytte, the photojournalist at the paper. He and Dicte have one of the most stable relationships in her life, but not without its challenges.

Dictes life promises to become even more complicated as her daughter is set to graduate soon, her ex-husband shows up and begins an affair with Dictes best friend. Her father contacts her out of the blue. During it all, she continues to search for the truthalmost at any costas her friendship with Wagner becomes more defined.

Ultimately it is Iben Hjejles performance as Dicte that encourages binge-watching of this fine series. Her character stubbornly feels she is right all the time at the price of damaged relationships and her own feelings of well being. It is observing her emotional thrashing about as she grows and softens that makes us love Dicte.

Dicte is based on the series by author Elsebeth Egholm. Each 45-minute episode is told in two parts. Viewed on Netflix.

8685000,5,B00OU5E0TS,"I'm new to Netflix and found this under foreign films.  An outstanding series, great development of characters, with the nuances that only foreign directors seem to achieve.  I hope that it continues beyond the second season.  As much as I loved Borgen, this is sublime.",1456444800,,270,4.955555555555556
8685001,1,B00OU5E0TS,"This DVD is in German ONLY!!  I'm not sure what the other reviewers watched,  I was able to find Dicte season two  with english subtitles but not season one. I really liked season two!",1449705600,,184,4.352941176470588
8685002,5,B00OU5E0TS,"I found this Danish crime drama on a list of ""if you liked this, you might also like...."" I had enjoyed The Bridge, The Killing, and Wallander, so I gave Dicte a try and was hooked right away. Dicte is not police officer but a newspaper reporter, and she has a semi-official position as a consultant to the police. ( think Robbie Coltrane in ""Cracker"" but without the psychology background ) The viewer gets about equal parts drama of Dicte's personal life and suspenseful crime-solving action. Dicte gave birth as a teen and was forced to give up the child by her Jehovah's Witness parents. For this reason she is estranged from her family, but as the story begins, she has just moved back to her hometown after a divorce, and her personal and professional lives eventually collide. The crime-solving is sufficiently difficult and convoluted, not the sort of thing in which the viewer can wrap up the investigation long before the characters. Iben Hjejle in the title role is excellent, as is the supporting cast, and the subplots involving her ex-husband and her two best friends are engaging. Hef relationship with Wagner, the police investigator who is her contact and de facto partner, is complex and ever-changing, and is one of the most interesting parts of the show.",1444694400,4,1274,4.821917808219178
