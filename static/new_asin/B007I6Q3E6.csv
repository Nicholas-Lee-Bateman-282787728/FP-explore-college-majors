8517341,5,B007I6Q3E6,"This little gem of a film, told from the point of view of a child growing up in an Orthodox family, is about a father who is frequently hurtful and disappointing. It's hard to watch it without tears coming to your eyes at times. It's an honest, interesting, and very believable film about parenting (not the good kind) and being a child in a challenging environment. People who have grown up in difficult families might find comfort in this film.",1402012800,3,446,4.5875
8517342,5,B007I6Q3E6,"After 30 years, still one of the most universally beautiful and poignant films ever made!
Do not miss this film!!",1388966400,2,113,4.7
8517343,5,B007I6Q3E6,"This is a good movie.  Set in the 1920s slums of Montreal, Canada. The era furniture, settings and motifs are impeccable.

The story says a lot about the collision of modern thought and traditional thinking, and how they affect the everyday life and times of a 5-year-old boy and his warm relationship with a religious grandfather, a man of great humor and sentiment. It is filled with innuendoes about evasive modern ""truths"" as opposed to the fantastic religious concepts of the past. Its message is as fitting today in the secular modern world as it was in this poor Jewish ghetto of the 1920s.

It is free to watch on YouTube, although the lighting and contrast is very bad. Netflix advertises it as a free download, but I am surprised it is not on DVD, except for these conspicuously high-priced discs available on Amazon.

It is probably not a good film for immature adults or children, but there is  enough comic relief to keep the spirits up, in spite of its serious dramatic messages.",1365292800,10,993,4.683908045977011
8517344,1,B007I6Q3E6,"The seller claimed that this was a licensed DVD and not a pirated copy. Wrong. This was clearly taped off of television. The first hint was the menu. It was from a template from a consumer software program. Second, it was censored, naughty words edited out. Third and most obvious, the word BRAVO appeared on the screen. Somebody videotaped it off of a broadcast from the Bravo Television Network. The seller claims it to be in the DVD-R format. There are two types of formats: NTSC and PAL. The United States of America uses NTSC. DVD-R means rewritable. Somebody went to Staples and bought a pack of blank DVDs.
Fourth: No FBI warning.
I respect copyright laws.",1363824000,15,663,4.6752136752136755
8517345,5,B007I6Q3E6,Way over priced. It is a shame this movie is better well known. I first saw it back in 1975 and I was so moved by the acting and story. I have waited for it to be available on DVD but it was way out of line with amount of money they were asking for it. I finally gave in and now I own it. It is a treasure.,1361404800,6,306,3.449275362318841
