You will find no better explanation of  the importance of planning the race, and racing the plan than in this film!!!  Deviation that seems to deliver a positive outcome in the here and now can prove to be categorically disastrous in the end.

Dr. Nehls himself gives you the first person narration of the video as he battles the topography, the weather, fatigue and the silent voices that persistently attempt to talk him off of his bike during his 2010 RAAM solo race.  He and his crew struggle through all the difficult moments and in turn, enjoy the simple splendor of the awesome scenery and a good day on the bike.

This is a very good film that is deserving of a place in your RAAM/Cycling video library.",1302825600,2,781,4.49645390070922
7802317,5,3981404815,"I am interested in doing the RAAM myself.  I have watch some of the YouTube and Bicycle Dream video of the RAAM. But as a Long Distance Kayak paddler I knew there was part of the story I am missing.  Dr. Nehls showed the true picture of the RAAM, the prep, the meetings, the support team, the cars, and the companionship. Plus I enjoyed Dr. Nehls essay of the RAAM during the Video. This is a video everyone needs if they are interest in ultracycling, RUSA, and/or the RAAM.  Keep the peddles moving.",1300838400,,500,4.354838709677419
7802318,5,3981404815,"Dr. Michael Nehl provides an inside view of the drama, science, psychology, humor and teamwork required to successfully complete one of the most challenging races on earth. There is something for everyone in this video. Racers, support crew, family, spectators, all will gain insight and knowledge to better understand the who, what, where, when and why of not only the Race Across America, but of the challenges in life as well.",1300579200,,429,5.056338028169014
