8355071,5,B0027U57H2,I was really shocked at the quality of the film for its age. You get to see German troops in action on the eastern front. I found it interesting to watch at the beginning the Germans conducting operations that I have familiarity with. The Germans were brave troops. For example one German soldier running right up to a Soviet T-34 tank and destroying it with their version of a grenade. I recommend this to any World War Two buff.,1450310400,10,430,4.455696202531645

8355073,5,B0027U57H2,"If you are really into WWII and you want a unique insight to Germany's view of the war, then this DVD is for you.  Using films produced as training tools and shown to new recruits, not to the general German public, these films give you a soldier's eye view of the war.",1296345600,16,268,4.153846153846154
