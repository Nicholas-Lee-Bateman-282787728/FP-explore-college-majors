8555270,5,B00AOC4ZBE,"Highly recommend this video, which actually SHOWED me rather than just telling me, what to do to express myself and engage with the audience better.  My whole troupe watched this together, and my teacher was very impressed with the amount of demonstration, and the concepts,in the DVD.  Lauren makes it all fun, easy to understand and clear, and basically just opens you up to a new level.  I feel as if I got a year's worth of performance experience in one viewing of the video.  The exercises are great tools.  I especially like the exercise where she just has the students smile at each other for a minute or so.....it feels fake and makes the cheeks tired.  So just putting on a happy face isn't the best way to present yourself to the audience; it goes deeper than that, and it's more fun for your audience and you if you engage at that deeper level.  In short, I highly recommend this video!",1406592000,4,897,4.5
8555271,4,B00AOC4ZBE,"You may not practice with this video often but it can completely change your dance.  This video centers around you and your audience, how to draw them in.  There were areas that I wish had been covered more in depth and maybe she will do that in the future (hope).",1371513600,,264,4.26
8555272,3,B00AOC4ZBE,"I really enjoyed the first part of this video. The concepts were very nice and fun. I would have rated it higher if the last concept had been genuine emotion. When I am watching people dance, I do not like it when they are trying to get a reaction out of me instead of being genuinely lost in the music and what they are doing. I love it when they stand on their own and are laughing and having a great time, but not dependent on my participation to make them feel happy. There is a way to do that with genuine communication with the soul and the music. The dancer will also be set up for disappointment when they don't get people to react to what they are doing. A genuine, honest dance with a genuine honest dancer that doesn't need me is amazing to watch. I really liked the first part of the video and I also liked the teacher's style of teaching, her ideas, the unique way her concepts were presented, her exercises, and her clarity. She did a wonderful job. I just don't like the dishonesty and trying to get something out of the audience at the end. Dancing comes from the soul and the heart of the music. Communion with the music and heart...communion with the one movement being done and not rushing through or thinking ahead is a good way to learn this.",1370649600,,1263,4.2887029288702925
8555273,3,B00AOC4ZBE,"Lauren Zehara did an amazing  with this one. I won't go into too much detail as previous reviewers already did a concise job of it.

Combination with frame movement
Adding a pause and working the combo
Compare version-where she divides her students into groups and then lets you see the difference in the emotion within the combo
A side by side screen shot of the performances for the first group then the second.
Part is all about the mental aspect of performing,How not to look like you are counting on stage.
The four levels of engagement:
Engagement in action
Improvised performances
Bonus activity.

I love her shimmies might I add. Off topic I know.
I want to give lauren and A just for effort. It is extremely hard to even begin to teach someone how to take an emotion and put it into a dance. But there are some drawbacks.

Overall this is a good dvd I gave it three stars and here is why.
A. The replay value for me is very low and
B.It is mainly for a beginner getting into the arena of performing. For something a little more universal try Michelle joyce perfomance series.",1365724800,9,1470,4.664092664092664
8555274,4,B00AOC4ZBE,"I wish I'd had this video about 5 years ago, when I was really starting to get serious about performing!

WHAT I LIKED:
I think the most valuable concept in this video is the information about the 4 Levels of Engagement. This section should be required viewing for any bellydancer! It's a bummer, as an audience member, to see a technically strong dancer who is stuck at Level 2 engagement. That little extra difference that bumps it up to Level 4 really makes the difference between a beautiful dance, and a beautiful dance that makes the audience feel something.

I think there was a nice variety of exercises and suggestions presented. The ""before and after"" split screen view was really neat to watch, and an effective way to demonstrate the difference these techniques make.

Lauren Zehara's teaching style is easy to follow, and her personality is very likable. If she came to my city, or if I were visiting hers, I'd go out of my way to take a class with her because I can tell it'd be a lot of fun. In the video, her attire is flattering and allows the viewer see her movements clearly.

I actually wasn't bothered at all by the DIY production values of this video. I think it was very well done. The space is very nice and well-lit, and I didn't have any trouble understanding the audio.

WHAT I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN:
I think it was great that the students in the class were of varying levels of experience. For the beginning to intermediate dancer, I think this will make it very accessible and relate-able. For my own learning, I would have liked to have seen a few advanced/professional dancers working through these concepts. Perhaps the inclusion of more advanced dancers would have adversely affected the class dynamic, so maybe this would make good bonus material at the end of the DVD, or as a bonus download on the instructor's website.

At about 20 minutes in length, I also think the ""Learn a Simple Combination"" section was drawn out longer than necessary. I fast-forwarded through a few of the repetitions. I think the ""Putting it all Together"" section where the students danced through a song and were given different cues went on a little long, too. During this segment, I felt like it would have been more helpful to have seen more students improvising to a shorter selection.

I was tired of the music by the end of the video. I think there are only 2 songs used, and the music is kind of generic and electronic. This may have been out of necessity, but I think it would have been valuable to see these concepts applied to different kinds of music that had more rich and varied qualities.

I was also very disappointed that there was not a performance by Lauren Zehara at the end. This is pretty standard practice for a bellydance instructional, so it was a surprising omission. Especially because she has such a friendly and sparkling personality as she teaches, it would have been very valuable to see how she brought her own personality to the stage, and how the instructor herself applied her own concepts in a performance setting.

SUMMARY:
I think that this DVD will provide useful ideas to any bellydance performer, from beginner through professional. If I'd paid this same price for an in-person workshop, I'd have definitely felt like I got my money's worth. This topic is so crucial, I would love to see Lauren Zehara put out a follow-up to this, with different students/exercises/concepts to deepen the practice.",1363132800,,3458,4.683690280065898
8555275,4,B00AOC4ZBE,"If you're thinking about yourself, you're dancing from the wrong place. Thats what Lauren Zehara tells her dance students  and shes so right. Whether your stage is a real one with an audience of several hundred watching you or whether its a square of space in a living room with your friends around, you need to own it and be in complete command. Easier said than done? Thats why Lauren makes you try out her advice as you watch her teach her students the basics of stage presence.
This DVD is essentially no-frills and home-made. The camera work isn't the best and the sound fluctuates, being too loud or suddenly dipped. And for its production quality, it should be less expensive. This is specially so when it doesnt have too much replay value. You can watch it a few times, but you won't needit after that.
That said, the advice on this DVD is sound and presented in a most practical manner. Ive seen DVDs where there are huge spells of lecturing not adequately backed up with practice, although there may be a little demo of each point. In that sense, Stage Presence is remarkable in that every single little tip is danced out and tried out. The students in Laurens class are ordinary women  real life women. Theyre not selected for their prettiness, figures or dance ability. Theyre just learners.  Thats rather reassuring and you immediately know that this video isn't about eye candy.
Heres how this DVD works: Lauren is in a class with a bunch of students. All sizes and shapes and levels and ages. She gets you to join in as she teaches them to move from a level of zero connection with the audience to one where you elicit a desired reaction from those who are watching you. And as I said, each thing is not just told, but done. So first, you tackle posture. This isn't the usual lesson in dance posture with all the points you must check, but focuses on the upper upper body, the part that makes you tall and proud. She calls this the frame, and actually its probably the part you could see if someone were to paint you and not do a full body picture. While I won't go into every section here and give away all the advice on paper, where it doesnt work as well, Ill say that Lauren uses a whole lot of exercises where you practice the wrong way and then the right way.  Using a simple combo she teaches, you learn to go from a flat emotionless face to one that has life and different expressions. You learn how being sure of what you're doing takes you outside of yourself and oriented towards others. You begin to have more fun with your dancing, as is quite evident with the performances of the students. There are two sections  one that focuses on the physical and the combination that is then used to practice different states of mind. The second is the focus on audience engagement.
A section I particularly liked was how Lauren had her students sit opposite each other and go through exercises of just smiling at each other and see just how uncomfortable and meaningless that can be and then move on to doing something to get the other person to feel something. A gesture from the dancer can make the other person clap, smile, laugh or be totally surprised  and thats what she must do when on stage.
Another part that was amusing and interesting was when she had a few of the dancers improvise but kept showing them cue cards to get them to portray a certain emotion such as sultry or happy or funny. That really works and is a good way for anyone to practice interpreting music that isn't itself strong with any particular emotion.
Lauren is entirely casual and relaxed and quite informal through this video. Natural, I would say. She laughs a lot and is not video-shy. That helps.
I would say this DVD is aimed at the early learner. By the time youve got ahead, the amount of dancing you know gives you the confidence to relate to an audience. Of course, even advanced learners can do with advice on some aspect or the other and thats where I think Michelle Joyces Secrets of the Stage series is more appropriate which Laurens Stage Presence suits the starter.  Basically, you end up with some tips to get over our stiffness and our intense focus on yourself and the way you're dancing and what you have to do next.

8555276,5,B00AOC4ZBE,"Pro's: Great content, Lauren and students very likeable, noticable results
Con's: In-house production, sound somewhat muffled in spots

The setting is a cozy classroom space, very casual.  First Lauren's students help her define the characteristics outside of technique that lend to great beginner shows and to truly stellar pro performances. I loved the fly-by text highlights used in this section.

The DVD content covers two primary aspects of stage presence: Physical, and Mental. There are excellent examples of posture and great visualizations as the group delves into the physical attributes that contribute to great presence. Laruen gives a combination sequence to music to practice a few times (and the viewer is encouraged to jump in), then builds on the exercise to add emotion and a dramatic pause.

There is great advice on making a connection with the audience and learning how to really engage your viewers.  You can then watch the transformation in her students as they are asked to dance while projecting an emotion or intent based on cue cards. The effect is both immediate and obvious, both in the group setting and individual solos shown.

The DVD includes bonus activities and wraps up with cute outtakes from the shoot. There were a few volume inconsistencies, however filming this video in an informal classroom environment was ideal in showing the impact her teachings had on her students. I'm already planning on recommending this DVD to some of my beginning and intermediate students that are just starting to ease their way onto the stage.",1358467200,5,1566,5.145669291338582
