1738885,3,B00006AUGR,"Having been the guest star in ""Charlie Chan at the Opera,"" Boris Karloff takes his own turn at being a brilliant Chinese detective in ""Mr. Wong, Detective,"" in an obvious effort by Monogram, a poverty row studio, to capitalize on the popular Charlie Chan series.  When Simon Dayton (John Hamilton), a chemical manufacturer in San Francisco receives anonymous death threats after his company begins making poision gas, he seeks the help of James Lee Wong. Of course, the next day the man is killed by his own gas, quickly followed by two of his business partners. Soon Mr. Wong and Police Captain Street (Grant Withers) are on the trail of a group of foreign spies who want to steal the formula for the poison gas.
This is an okay mystery of this type and I really thought they came up with a rather ingenious way of delivering the poison gas (remember the fear that people had of such a weapon after World War I). The plot is better than the acting, but that is standard for a film put out by Monogram (they did sixteen John Wayne B Westerns earlier in the decade).  This 1938 film was directed by William Nigh and is based on the stories of Hugh Wiley, and gave Karloff something to do besides monster movies. You do not really buy that he is Chinese, but he does bring a certain dignity to the role, which is nice to see given the time when this film was made.
Ironically, while the Mr. Wong films were made to capitalize on the success of Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto, ""Mr. Wong, Detective"" was remade in 1948 as a Charlie Chan film, ""Docks of New Orleans"" (when Monogram finally bought the rights to the series they apparently had no money left to buy a new script).  There were six Mr. Wong films, all made relatively quickly and cheaply.  As you would expect, if you have seen one you have essentially seen them all.  They are minor diversions at best.",1087862400,4,1855,4.460176991150442
1738886,2,B00006AUGR,"When Monogram recruited Boris Karloff for its ""Mr. Wong"" series in 1938, the studio apparently believed that the horror icon's presence would be strong enough to carry its low-budget product. They were sadly mistaken and the series folded in 1940 after six films, with Karloff appearing in only five of them. (Interestingly, Keye Luke played a younger version of the Chinese detective in the final installment.) Time has not been kind to the ""Mr. Wong"" series. These mysteries are deadly dull and have virtually nothing to offer except the sincerity of Karloff's performances. On the plus side, these are the best prints you are likely to find. Still, Karloff's association with Monogram was less distinguished than Bela Lugosi's run during the early 1940s. Even Bela's ""Mysterious Mr. Wong"" (no relation) is more entertaining than the dreary exploits of James Lee Wong.",1081382400,12,870,5.177304964539007
1738887,4,B00006AUGR,"In MR. WONG, DETECTIVE James Lee Wong is hired by the owner of a chemical manufacturing firm who is accused of stealing a secret formula. The owner and two of his associates are promptly murdered leaving Mr. Wong with three homicides to solve.
William Nigh is the director of this movie which is the first of six entries in the series. Boris Karloff has the starring role of Mr. Wong. The rather small supporting cast includes Grant Withers, Maxine Jennings, Evelyn Brent, Frank Bruno, Lucien Prival and Lee Tong Foo.",1052179200,,517,4.7555555555555555

1738930,4,B00006AUGR,"To first address the elephant in the room: yes, it's inherently racist to have Boris Karloff play a Chinese character. I do think the blow is somewhat softened by the way he plays him, though; not as a caricature, but as an intelligent and dignified man who treats other characters with respect and expects the same. Very unlike his portrayal of Fu Manchu, for example.

As to the film itself, it's actually pretty brilliant. Nobody else in it can act, unfortunately, but the story is actually very strong, right up to the final reveal. I'm just getting started on this series, and so far it's very impressive.",1478304000,2,610,4.700934579439252

1739190,3,B00006AUGR,"Boris Karloff plays James Lee Wong, a Chinese private detective. Little is done to convince you he is Chinese apart from the name. He doesn't look the part and Karloff doesn't hide his English accent. The plot of the film begins with a businessman coming to Wong for help. He feels he is in danger but can't explain why or from whom. Wong doesn't get a chance to start investigating before the man drops dead in his office the next day. His business partners are obvious suspects as they have all just signed a document giving ownership to the other two if one dies. There is another suspect, Carl Roemer, who has developed a formula that he believes the dead man stole from him. Just before the man died, Roemer had threatened him with a gun.

The police investigate working with Wong which is good because the police in this movie were as dumb as bricks. The other business partners die one by one which leaves Roemer as the only viable suspect but it takes Wong to figure out the clever way he killed them when they always died alone, locked in a room.

This movie is another one of those enjoyable to watch but nothing spectacular movies. The plot is just interesting enough to make you want to see how it all turns out.",1363132800,4,1224,4.435555555555555

1739194,4,B00006AUGR,"Not to be out detected by Charlie Chan or Mr. Moto, the Oxford-educated oriental sleuth Mr. James Lee Wong (Boris Karloff) has his own series of movies. This is the first and considered the best.

A businessman suspects that he is about to be murdered. He enlists the help of James Lee Wong ""detective"". Naturally this is a 10 O'clock appointment for the next day. You guessed it; it was the ""Wong"" move, as he was too late.

You will be familiar with all the elements of this mystery. However these elements were very well put together in this film. Yep, everyone is acting very suspicious, and as usual, it is the last person you would suspect.

Looks like a choice of price versus quality. This copy is not been restored. There other versions that have been restored. However, you get ten minutes into the film and get so intrigued in the mystery that you forget all about quality.

7966479,3,B00006AUGR,"Mr. Wong, Detective, 1938 film

The film begins with a view of a city. The wake from the boat shows the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge. Cargo is being loaded on a ship. An investigator located a shipment of important chemicals. Can it be stopped? Mr. Simon Dayton asks Mr. James Wong for help. He and his business are threatened. ""Have a good dinner."" A man bursts into the office, he has a gun and a complaint against Dayton. He calls the police. But he won't talk to them when they arrive. Wong arrives and comments on the evidence. Can a small piece of glass be a clue? Its composition and size are determined in a laboratory. ""He's just as sane as you are."" Wong figures out how it could have happened. When was it planted? Will the parrot squawk a clue?

A letter for Mr. Wilk warns him of danger, he calls the police. But he won't talk to the police either. Wong tells Carl Roemer to talk. [Note the police interrogation methods.] Captain Street promises protection to Carl Roemer. ""Tell them what they want to know."" Mr. Wong continues to investigate. The material witnesses are freed. Mr. Russell wants to help. Roemer names the killer, the police arrive to find another body. Wong returns home and hears his parrot squawk. Wong has good manners, and good acting to fool his guests. Wong figures out how Meisel was killed, but not who did it. A trick reveals the murderer. ""Very clever."" And Wong will relax at home with a cup of tea.

This is an average story with some foreign intrigue. There seems to be a gap in the plot. Poison gas was a feared weapon of mass destruction because of its use in The Great War.",1488412800,,1623,4.439597315436242

The solution to this one is kind of obvious about halfway through so I was shouting at the screen for the last half, though that didn't help Wong and Street solve it faster.  This was the first film in the series and some characters are added later and become more refined.

I watched this streaming with the Amazon video player off the website using an iPad2. There were some very minor video aberrations when people were moving quickly. I did watch it with closed caption subtitling, since I have minor hearing impairment.  On the iPad2, the subtitles were about 30 seconds out of sync with the show.  I was able to turn it up louder and figure things out, but for someone that truly relied on them this would be a major issue. I've had similar problems with other CC subs on Amazon streaming with the iPad2.",1480636800,,854,4.483870967741935
