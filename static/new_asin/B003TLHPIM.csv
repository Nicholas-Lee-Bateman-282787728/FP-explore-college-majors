4190535,5,B003TLHPIM,"Well-acted, well-written with plenty of heart and action, The High Chaparral broke new ground for unprecidented number of Hispanic stars, regulars, guest-stars and support players and for casting Native Americans in Native American roles.  These German-released DVDs are beautifully remastered with the language option of hearing the original actors in original English. If you're in the US, all you need is a region-free  or all-region DVD player (available from Amazon.com)to watch this classic, timeless western series.",1330732800,8,522,5.855263157894737

4190537,1,B003TLHPIM,"It comes in German, packaging is in German, I don't speak German. It may have an English version but it does not play on DVD's sold in the US. They got me because I did not read the fine print. I gave it one star because the rating system will not go any lower. This will be the last $70 I spend with these crooks.",1316736000,3,314,3.8461538461538463

4190539,5,B003TLHPIM,"Okay folks here's my review short and simple:

UPDATE April 3, 2013: THE COMPLETE SERIES  is now available in a Box Set at Amazon.de (Germany)
Search: High Chaparral - Die komplette Serie [26 DVDs]

1) Picture quality is great; remastered from the originals.

2) DVD 1 has about 1 minute of German (and un-remastered film) at the start of episode 1 regardless of whether you've set it to play in English or not that must remain.

2b) By the way that German at the beginning simply relates that Cochise doesn't want any whites on his hunting grounds and that the death of Mangas Coloradas has ticked him off...and so it begins..Buck and Big John also thank a family for their hospitality.

3) I've ordered Season Two because frankly I'm now hooked.

4) Do have a DVD player and TV that can play Region 2 DVDs! (My Windows Media Player here in Germany does play them, you may want to look into that)

5) Only four stars because DVDs 5 and 6 had tech problems which require me to return the set for a new one. However these problems disappeared when viewing the two episodes which were effected on my computer instead of on my DVD player(s).

6) No way a true High Chaparral fan will be disappointed.

7) Packaging leaves much to be desired, very strange system which ""holds"" the DVDs in place, but then again SO WHAT?

8) There is about a minute or so of film adverts at the beginning of each DVD in German.

9) Episode titles are written in both German and English seen when navigating the DVD.

10) DVD navigating instructions are in German, translated as follows from page 1:

""ALLE ABSPIELEN"" = Play All

""EPISODENAUSWAHL"" = Episode Selection

""EPISODENBERSICHT: = Episode Overview

""SPRACHEN/TON"" = Language/Tone

""EPISODE FORTFAHREN"" = Start Episode

From page 1 select ""SPRACHEN/TON"" = Language/Tone

Then select ""ENGLISCH MONO DOLBY DIGITAL"" i.e. ""English""

Next, right below that, choose ""EPISODE FORTFAHREN"" = Start Episode

You are now off to the High Chaparral!

11) You can order High Chaparral ""Staffel 1"" - ""Staffel 4"" = Season 1 -- Season 4 direct from Amazon Germany alot cheaper, [...], than what is now being asked in the USA. THEY ARE IN STOCK:

[...]

12) More good reviews in English at Amazon United Kingdom (link at bottom of page)

Adios amigos!!

Changed my mind, got to give 'er 5 stars..hehe!",1296864000,34,2318,4.687344913151365
4190540,5,B003TLHPIM,"It is now more than 40 years since The High Chaparral TV series appears on television in the 1960's. In my honest opinion this 98-episode series is the best ever produced for television. There are many sincere fans in U.S. as well as all over the world would like to watch this series again if the producer would make it available just like The Fugitive series. Right now, The High Chaparral is available in the German version and is very expensive. Besides, unless one is equipped with a multi-region DVD player, there is no chance to view this first season version. The question is since it is available in the German version, why is one version for U.S. and Canada viewers still not available? The producer is losing money if it continues to ignore the North American fans and then  force them to buy  ""moon shining"" or illegal versions whereby these home-made producers are  reaping the rewards which would otherwise  would have  gone to the producer, the actors and legitimate seller, such as amazon.com. I hope that the producer will listen to the urgings of The High Chaparral fans and soon come out with an North American version. Thanks",1288656000,105,1145,4.733668341708543
4190541,5,B003TLHPIM,"An excellent western series with a great premise and strong characters.  The show comes from David Dotort,  the same man that created Bonanza but any similarity to that juggernaut ends there.  Ranch owner Big John Cannon (Leif Erickson) marries neighboring ranch owner Don Sebastians (Frank Silva) young daughter Victoria (Linda Crystal) in what is initially an effort to broaden his own stature as a landowner.  With Victoria comes her brother Manolito (Henry Darrow) who lives at the ranch with Johns brother Buck (Cameron Mitchell) and Johns son Blue Boy (Mark Slade).  As time goes on,  Big John and Victoria form a bond that goes beyond their marriage of convenience.  Victorias relationship with Johns grown son also blossoms into one of care and respect.  The show is at its most entertaining though, when Johns brother Buck is teamed up with Victorias brother Manolito on some escapade that requires them to work together.  Their mutual respect and the banter between them is just plain fun to watch.  The show remained consistently good for the four years it was on network television.",1407283200,,1094,5.06145251396648
4190542,1,B003TLHPIM,Have been unable to play it on by dvd player. It dosent play as the player is not equiprd to. Wrong Region.......,1404604800,2,113,4.181818181818182

4190544,3,B003TLHPIM,"I bought the complete series from Amazon.de and while it arrived on time, four of the episodes skip leaving them unwatchable.  And that was just on the first four disks.  The region free DVD player does not do that for any other U.S. disks that I've tried.  I'm just sick about it.  This is one of my all time favorite Westerns and I was looking forward to seeing each episode in its entirety.  Hopefully the remaining disks are better.

My rating is 5 stars for the series and only 3 stars for the quality of the DVDs.",1387152000,5,519,4.298969072164948
4190545,5,B003TLHPIM,Great Western with location filming in Old Tucson movie set. Would buy DVD in a flash if it was available in Region 1. Don't want to buy bootlegs because some of the footage edited out for more commercials. Wish some one would release it over in USA.,1375920000,,250,4.340425531914893

4190548,5,B003TLHPIM,"I once played a part in 10 Little Indians as one of Cochise's Braves, although I'm quite dark skinned ""1/4 Blackfoot Indian"" my hair is Dark Brown and wavy, anyway they use wigs & Walnut Stain in an oil base. I also played in The Legacy as one of the men in the Saloon, and as a ""Mule Skinner"" in Destination Tucson, also in the Lion of Sonora when Don Sebastian Montoya died, I was one of the Mexican Banditos that was wiped out at the very end of the program. Since I can still ride & rope I played in probably a 8-10 episodes of The High Chaparral, since I live near the North end of the Tucson Mountain Range I can see where secenes were shot nearby to where I live. I was all ready to become a ""regular"" on the series when my Military Service ""The U.S.Air Force"" excercised their authority over me for a Permanent Change of Station to Europe for 3 years. I loved working on the set but, the makeup was quite harsh on the skin ""especially the face"". I must say one other thing that may be bad news for all in the US/Canada, the Producer made an oath that he ""would NEVER"" make the series available to viewers here, after learning about that I've just been recording them from the TV then using a Video Camera/Camcorder copying them to my computer then burning that to disc, it's not that fancy but the picture & sound quality is very good. This may be an avenue for those who want The High Chaparral and I did.",1361145600,13,1414,4.202205882352941
