7868552,5,6304341911,I rented this movie over ten years ago. Love the acting of Jamieson Boulanger and Ricky Mabe. I believe Burt Reynolds was also in this movie. The two boys intend to reincarnate Frankenstein. It is a good kid flick. I think I would buy it if it were ever for sale at amazon.com.,1348099200,,277,4.245283018867925
