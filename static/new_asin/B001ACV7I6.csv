8599762,4,B001ACV7I6,"This film is more of a documentary than a typical mountain bike video that shows jumps, tricks, and downhill riding. The film follows the downhill season and shows the races. It also gives backstories on most of the riders. Overall a good film if you want to watch some downhill races and find out more about the riders.",1347321600,,320,4.5344827586206895
8599763,5,B001ACV7I6,"Definitely not bike porn, this is the 2007 world cup mountain bike downhill season in review plus rider segments filmed in their offseason.  Not as polished as Tipping Point or 3 Minute Gaps, still well worth it if this is your cup of tea.  Go Sam Hill!",1345075200,,253,4.361702127659575
