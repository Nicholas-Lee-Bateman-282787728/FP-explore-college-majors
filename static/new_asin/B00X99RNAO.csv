And Gene's movies are full of drama, action and even romance, not only with his horse Champion, but with various female leads as well. A really enjoyable extra is The Melody Ranch Theater where you get to see Gene and Pat Buttram reminisce, So this set, in fact, any or all of the other movie or TV collections, would be a good deal to have, once you start with one, you'll want to get them all, they will put you in a good mood everytime
