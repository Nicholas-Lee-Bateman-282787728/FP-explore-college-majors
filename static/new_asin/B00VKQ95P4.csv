The halftime analysis and postgame ceremony are great, but I really would have liked some behind the scenes footage and One Shining Moment. However, what is there is great. The picture quality is very close to live quality, so I get to relive the awesomeness of Duke's 5th national title. Definitely worth the buy.",1433116800,,380,4.861538461538461

7093160,5,B00VKQ95P4,"For the last 4 years I have been trying to get the NCAA championship game released on Blu-Ray, finally in 2015 the game was released both on a Blu-Ray disc and in the same case a DVD disc. The Blu-Ray disc played normally, the picture quality was high definition Blu-Ray quality.
I had previously phoned Team Marketing in April and they assured me that the DVD release had both a HD Blu-Ray disc and a DVD disc.
Thanks to Team Marketing and the NCAA for finally releasing the game on Blu-Ray.
If only the NBA would realize that they can grow a new sales line by releasing some playoff series on high definition Blu-Ray.
I believe the 2014 finals and the 2015 finals would sell enough to be profitable.
I purchased the Blu-Ray/DVD from Amazon.ca.
