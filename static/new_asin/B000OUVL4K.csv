8186774,5,B000OUVL4K,It is a wonderful movie my children and I watched together when they were young. We all enjoyed it immensely! I was so glad to find it on DVD.,1437955200,,142,3.9310344827586206
8186775,5,B000OUVL4K,"This film is delightful, it's original 1970's adventure, with sketched animation, very familiar (and famous) British character actors doing the voices, very Cosgrove comedy touches, atmospheric music, a bit of peril and at moments quite scary. Stretch yourself and your children away from the polished Disney world and enjoy a piece of 70's magic. For those with a bit of originality and wit.",1366502400,3,392,5.238095238095238
8186776,1,B000OUVL4K,"The Talking Parcel was an okay movie I guess; and that's putting it lightly.  The Talking Parcel has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Where do I begin? The story is flat with a weak narrative.  The animation is very primitive looking and dull (this movie is from 1978 but Snow White (1937) looks much better!)  The parrot and the frog look okay but the girl is very ugly.  The music is very dated and kinda creepy.  The sound quality is horrible! It is very murky and echoey like it was recorded in some kind of tunnel.  The atmosphere of the movie seems very drug-induced and it gave me a headache when I watched it.  Worst of all, the quality of the remaster is horrible. Was it even remastered at all? It felt like I was watching it on some ancient late-70s video tape instead of a DVD.  The screen even goes grey at some points of the film and at the end it just cuts out abruptly.  If there was anything good about this film, I'd have to say it would be the Toad.  He was the only thing that salvaged this abomination.

Again, BAD movie.  Don't waste your time.  Stick to Disney movies, you can't go wrong with Disney",1257379200,,1140,4.217592592592593
