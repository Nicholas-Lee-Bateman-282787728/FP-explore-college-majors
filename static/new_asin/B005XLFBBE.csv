4903287,5,B005XLFBBE,GREAT STUFF,1420156800,,11,5.0
4903288,1,B005XLFBBE,"The build up for this makes it sound sensational.  Actually, there are only a few ""rare short subjects"" and a few commercials.  I was really disappointed.  At least I didn't blow a lot of money on it.",1390003200,4,200,4.351351351351352
4903289,5,B005XLFBBE,this really takes you back to some great old shows the Christmas shows where always special and this holds true to these shows.,1388275200,,127,4.565217391304348
4903290,1,B005XLFBBE,As much as I like to watch DVDs like this...this wasn't a favorite. Bad quaility and so choppy. The best part was the commercials not the program. Needed to be under $5.00.,1382572800,8,172,4.40625
4903291,5,B005XLFBBE,"Patty Duke is in two commercials for Remco toys in this DVD. They are priceless for an early look at her career. They are in black and white but very enjoyable. I laughed when the boy says the boys will love the toy, and Patty says the girls will too, and winks.",1376956800,3,262,4.0576923076923075
4903292,5,B005XLFBBE,Love this old stuff.  So fun to learn about the religious and secular perspectives back in the day -- and the advertising was a bonus.  Lots of fun for old and young I think!,1357516800,5,174,4.088235294117647
8488689,5,B005XLFBBE,Vintage TV shows and commercials from the early days of TV. Bette Davis plays a school teacher trapped in the snow with youngsters. Low quality visually and No special features.,1504742400,,177,4.933333333333334
8488690,1,B005XLFBBE,"Although the disc label said it was the ""Vintage Holiday Extravaganza"", what was actually on the disc was some unknown film noir which wouldn't even play! Unfortunately, by the time I first tried to play it, it was past the return window. :-( In the future, I'll be sure to pop it into the player as soon as it arrives.

Don't Waste Your Time!  There are better Christmas Collections available! This ain't the one to buy! Ought to be removed by Amazon to the trash heap and save all the loyal customer's the anguish of hoping against hope that perhaps this will be a ""valuable buy"" at Christmas for those looking for a bit of ""old time Christmas Cheer!""
