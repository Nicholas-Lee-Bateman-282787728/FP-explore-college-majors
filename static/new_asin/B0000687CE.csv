1724758,5,B0000687CE,Normally listen to jazz. Especially enjoyed the way the group Front 2-4-2 was able to bring a real feel to the video. Would love to see more of this type of music video - combining real world events with music that enhcances the experience.,1029283200,,240,4.4772727272727275
1724759,5,B0000687CE,"Awesome! Being a Photographer, Video Editor and Special Effects artist myself, I can appreciate the effort that went into creating this collage of site and sound. Even more important is how the emotion of the event went from inside their hearts to the screen. Ive attended the 24 Hours of Le Mans only twice to this date and I can tell you that this DVD captures the essence of the event in a way that no other presentation has. It is not a documentary of a specific race, although it was shot during the 76th running of the race. It is a documentary of the power that is the 24 Hours of Le Manssomething that no facts or figures can portray albeit in print, on the web or in video.
For those of you whove been to the 24 Hours of Le Mans, to witness the spectacle, youll watch this DVD with the same excitement that surmises the entire race weekend. For those of you whove never been to the eventthis is where it starts!

Rob Chong et al have sown their passion into this DVD.  Rob and his group dragged their cameras to the very wet 2001 Le Mans and came back with a visual feast.  And the images are simply heightened by the eletronica score.  It all comes together in a synthetic fusion that pumps to the heart beat that is Le Mans.

1724764,5,B0000687CE,"For anyone who has ever been to the Le Mans 24 hour race, this is a must.  If you've never been, then its even more of a must, if that makes any sense.  The photography and video work are absolutely stunning.  This DVD features footage from the 2001 Le Mans race, where as those who were there will know, it rained for pretty much the whole weekend.  This makes for excellent shots of the cars spewing rooster tails of spray and sliding all over the place.  Backed by an excellent soundtrack that really enhances the mood of the pictures on screen.  The ""nearly"" tag?  The only better thing you will find on the market is the Steve McQueen film - but you've already got that anyway?
This DVD blew me away the first time I saw it and it still doesn't disappoint after many further watches.  Stick it on loop for a party, or play around with the different view settings and be amazed at the photography and the driving.
It rocks.",1025481600,,927,4.348837209302325
7964157,4,B0000687CE,"My main reason for getting this was the music, which was composed by Daniel Bresanutti and Patrick Codenys of Front 242, but I must say that the total audiovisual experience presented in Speed Tribe does not disappoint.  Although it's a look at the Le Mans auto race, it's not really a documentary, so much as an impressionistic series of linked racing images.  There are actually 2 versions on the DVD, each under 30 minutes in length.  In both there's almost no dialogue, and the video is heavily processed.  It runs the gamut from standard racing footage to shots of the crowds to views taken from the perspective of the drivers.  The overall effect is pretty captivating, and it draws you in.  As to the music, Daniel B and Patrick C don't disappoint.  It's pretty damn cool, especially if you're a big Front 242 fan.

I must say however, Speed Tribe pales in comparison to the later DVD put out by Daniel B and Patrick C for their music project Male of Female, entitled Primitive Reflections From Twisted Sound.  The visuals for that one were done by the same  team that did Speed Tribe, but they're even more out there and unusual.  There are 26 videos included.  Sixteen are easy to find, and the remaining 10 are hidden throughout an interactive portion of the DVD.  If you're a 242 fan and liked Speed Tribe, you'll LOVE Primitive Reflections.  The DVD is accompanied by a CD with an additional 40 minutes of music, so there's a lot of material in the package.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure if Amazon carries it.  Another recommended AV project in the same vein is James Ray's 4080peru, but the audio there is much more quiet ambient.",1146873600,,1642,4.629757785467128
7964158,5,B0000687CE,While it is not the sounds of Sebring that I was looking for this is an excellent piece of artistry for the racing fan.  Especially a retired punk who grew up on NASCAR CART F1 Nigel Mansel Front 242 The Cure and Bad Brains while watching Le Mans.,1078185600,,247,4.145833333333333
7964159,3,B0000687CE,"I bought this as one of the starters into Front 242's music - along with Geography and to be honest this release gives me mixed feelings. While the music is superb - that in itself does give me visions of being a racing driver driving for his team at Le Mans.....the DVD is rather flimsy in comparison. Meandering and not half as interesting. And the interviews are boring. Listening to only the driver's voice without any pictures of the guy talking is really terrible and uninspiring. Perhaps they ran out of money on the budget they had in mind
As I said the music is faultless - it's a great industrial/techno hybrid.....it's just the shame the DVD couldn't be that bit better",1056067200,,680,4.581967213114754
7964160,5,B0000687CE,"Like a sonic boom that races across your mind's uncharted territory, delivering dose after dose of pleasure stimuli and pushing your neurons to capacity. This mind boggling work takes you to the extremes of tonal ecstasy.
This work is so far beyond the electronic frontier, I shudder. It seems to activate previously unexplored senses, expanding your nervous system into multiple directions...what a ride!
Dare I say it - it somewhat requires a refined pallet. It's delightfully less accessible than anything I've listened to in at least 1000 years. The rewards are just as endless. Synaesthetic connoisseurs welcome here. Others need not apply or at least be willing to enter at your own risk.
More like CNS architects than traditional musicians, the artists are shamans from the future, always heralding the next wave of music and delivering on contact with precision and great vision.
It's almost spooky that so many moods can be felt. Outstanding work...and that just describes the music!",1044316800,,992,5.20625
7964161,5,B0000687CE,"I bought this DVD after reading a review in a magazine, and I have to say I'm really pleased. Although I watch the occasional motorsports race, I wouldn't call myself a racing fan. But seeing how Speed Tribe combines racing and electronic music, maybe I'll start watching more! Kudos to the producers for focusing on the 5.1 surround sound, and for making it widescreen. It really shows off my 34"" widescreen TV, and the bass sure impress my neighbors! This isn't the sort of DVD I watch once then file away, I've been able to watch it many times, each time finding something new, since it's really almost like a long music video with tons of special effects.",1043280000,,659,4.593220338983051
7964162,1,B0000687CE,"The sound and picture quality is really the only good thing this DVD has going for it, which is excellent by the way. But the footage and music was a bit boring actually. For home entertainment don't bother, this DVD is best left for a store to run on constant loop to display sound and picture quality of home theater systems.
I was hoping this DVD would have some really exciting race footage combined with heart-pumping rythms and beats. But it doesn't. The music is rater subdued and the race footage, although skillfully shot, doesn't really excite me, and I'm a *big* motorsports fan.",1042243200,2,590,4.6826923076923075
7964163,2,B0000687CE,"Being a VJ and listening to many different styles of electronic music I was really expecting alot more from 242...
The visual part was Ok! It is just footages of the race with some filters a little computer rendering so forth not much animation or anything like that.  The footage is good some parts are quite nice but over all it could get boring.
The music I was expenting more fast paced music but alot it could be like dark atmosphereric some of its more upbeat but really disappoiting I would have say.  and there are two versions
the second version is some guy just talking car and race stuff
but I bought this DVD expenting visuals not technical data about the cars if I wanted that i would go buy a dvd for that.  I don't see the point of this.
I guess I was expeting too much and the reviews I read were all great and from the packaging and the previews it look very interesting.  But overall for the price I payed its ok not bad.",1040601600,,939,4.229050279329609
7964164,5,B0000687CE,"What can I say? Just slapped it straight into the DVD, turned on the big screen, cranked up the stereo and WOW!!!
Awesome, awesome, awesome!!!
Any self-respecting person who claims to enjoy the Le Mans experience must, must, must get a copy. If they don't own a DVD player, they should just go and get one, no questions asked! I have never had such a spine-tingling sensation for so long - the atmosphere is just mega!!!
Can't believe I took so long to decide to order a copy!",1034726400,2,476,4.420454545454546
7964165,5,B0000687CE,This is one of the most incredible audio/video dvds out there.  Completely unique.  Incredible racing footage shot in a completely fresh new way.  The music is equally great.  It keeps up the pace and more.  The quality is superb as well.  A great demo disc to show off your system.  It is amazing what a good job both the film and music editors did with this disc.  Truly unbelievable and incredible.  Bottom Line:  This is a must own dvd!  The best dvd I have purchased in the past two years.  Nothing compares.,1033603200,2,513,4.456521739130435
7964166,5,B0000687CE,"Speedtribe is an audio-visual album created by digital filmmakers Sharon Matarazzo and Rod Chong in collaboration with legendary electronica producers of Front 242 Daniel Bressanuti and Patric Codenys. Put  simply it is a record of last years Lemans race set to music.
First impressions- very slick and professional looking, great colours with spectacular audio. Then, when you watch for a second and third time with a critical eye as I did before writing this, you realize just how much thought and sheer artistic talent has gone into each and every frame. I can honestly say that you could freeze the thing at any point and have yourself a superb image to grace any gallery wall. Plenty of clever special effects, and Rod has woven some footage from the PC game Sports Car GT into his film, chasing down the straight through the spray at night. This would look great on a cinema screen.
The rain last year was a nightmare for the teams but a filmmaker's gift. Great shots of high-speed clouds rolling in behind the Dunlop Bridge and sheets of rain sweeping the track. I began to wonder how Rod got some of those angles without being run over!
If Britney and S Club are your musical bag you might not like the soundtrack. I love it but then I have twiddled a synth knob or two myself in the past. The music really compliments the visuals in a big way and of course there is another tune I guarantee you will enjoy, Lemans cars howling down the Mulsanne. The sound sweeps across the speakers in a great surround-sound way so turn it up and to hell with the neighbours!
All in all, this is a brilliant piece of work. Not sure if the makers will like me saying this but it has a definite feel of the Steve McQueen movie brought bang up to date. Good stuff!",1029283200,7,1754,4.498432601880878
