7837205,5,6303101186,"THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE! I LOVED IT! It was VERY Frightening to get a small TASTE of just HOW Shockingly Horrible the Nazis were. I think everyone should see this very well performed movie. It is about a woman whose son goes to Germany and dies over there and she goes to investigate exactly what happened and what she learns is that he was used to create a PURE BLOOD GERMAN following in the GROTESQUE EFFORT by the NAZIS to do this. It is a very frightening and shocking experience to see this movie and realize just how Shockingly HORRIBLE the Nazis really were. I think paying even a lot of money to see this film is worth it. I think if this film  is not made into DVD it should be re-made, IT is THAT good and something everyone should see,",1411689600,2,744,4.2027972027972025
7837206,5,6303101186,Good Lee Remick film that is not in print. It is only available on VHS. The plotline is about racism towards people ethnically different from the white aryan race. It challenges people to examine their own beliefs. Lee Remick in the film is traumatised to realize she herself has racist ways and is moved to change the way she views other people.,1311552000,,346,4.596774193548387

7837208,4,6303101186,"OF PURE BLOOD is a compelling drama detailing the horrific ramifications of the Nazis' Lebensborn programme.

Lee Remick plays Alicia Browning, a successful New York casting director, who learns that her son (living in Germany) has been mysteriously killed.  She gets another shock when she discovers that he fathered a daughter.

Alicia travels to Germany, and uncovers the horrible truth: her granddaughter is embroiled in a revival of the 'Lebensborn' programme, used by the Nazis' during WW2 as a way of breeding perfect Aryan children (the master race).  When Alicia discovers that she, too, was a product of the Lebensborn programme, she decides to smuggle her granddaugher out of Germany.

Fine, well-written thriller/drama co-starring Patrick McGoohan, Gottfried John, Richard Munch, Katharina Bohm, Edith Schneider and Carolyn Nelson.",1107648000,15,843,5.606299212598425
7837209,1,6303101186,"There are many great BBC Videos, one is ""Of Pure Blood"" from the book of the same name but I doubt this is the video. It aired on the Discovery Channel and another same is ""Selling of Murder"" You  cannot get these videos from anywhere in NTSC. They put on a show and  before you can set up your VCR it is too late and even if you do it is so  full of commercials it is not worth it.",943833600,,382,3.75
