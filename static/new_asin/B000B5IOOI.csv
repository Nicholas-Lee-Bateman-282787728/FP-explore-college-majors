Flight 005 Conspiracy - The movie runs for 50 minutes. The summary is about the two Lovely Angels (Don't call them the Dirty Pair unless you want a broken nose), Kei and Yuri being handed two cases at once. They have to investigate a space liner explosion where three hundred people died (no one came foreward to claim insurance money), and find a missing scientist and his family.
Project Eden runs for 90 minutes. This time Kei and Yuri travel to a planet rich with Vizorium, a mineral essential to space travel. However, the mines have been under attack which leads Kei and Yuri to a mad scientist who wants to take the aliens to their  final evolutionary form.
Affair On Nolandia runs for 50 minutes, the animation here is different than the other two, giving Kei and Yuri a more adult look. This time Kei and Yuri have to find a missing girl. However, there is more than meets the eye when they find her and the plot thickens.

Frankly, if you like anime from the eighties, this should be an excellent buy for you. Kei and Yuri are comical and often violent. But the series isn't about just them, though he may not take the screen, Muhgi, their comrade who looks like a huge bear dog, is someone you should fall in love with. Oh and, despite the tag, the Dirty Pair is in no means a hentai (Pornographic) anime series. So those buying it for that purpose will be dissappointed.",1237420800,2,1565,4.468531468531468
