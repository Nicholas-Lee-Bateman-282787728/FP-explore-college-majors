Two, eccentric, sweet elderly sisters are hiding a secret in their cellar. They both live together in an English country home in Lancashire, near an army training camp. And soldiers are being brutally murdered left and right. But, what are the sisters hiding in their cellar? And what or whom is it that they are both desperately trying to protect?

The sisters discuss their father who served in the first world war, and when he eventually came home from the war, he was never the same again. Instead of the handsome, young man who loved them and their mother, he became violent and mentally disturbed. Once Stephen, their younger brother was born, things got even worse in the household. As the years passed the household became a living hell for the sisters and their brother.

You really must watch this movie to see who the sisters are hiding in their cellar and how they are tied into all the murders taking place on the moors. It is an exceptional British horror classic from the 70's, and keeps you guessing all the way. I won't give the ending away because you really do need to view this for yourself, but I think you'll be surprised as to who or what was in the cellar and how this terrific film ends.

A really good watch! I recommend it highly. Fantastic British movie making at its best. You won't be disappointed, that I can assure you!",1390780800,3,1548,4.638686131386861
7811650,4,6301275373,"Not as frightening as I remember from when I saw it last (35 years ago) but it was great to finally see it again. If you are a fan of British Horror you might dig this one.
I have read many reviews in which people have complained about the quality of the transfer. To be honest the quality was not all that bad, it is better than I would have thought possible due to the age of the film and the process in which it had been filmed.",1381449600,3,431,3.909090909090909
7811651,3,6301275373,"The Bottom Line:

Probably far better than it has any right to be, The Beast in the Cellar managed to keep me reasonably interested in its resolution despite manifestly poor production values (note of warning: the DVD transfer is of terrible quality) and thus can be sort-of recommended as being much less awful than it appeared it would be.",1233100800,8,341,4.779661016949152
7811652,2,6301275373,"It's the 88 minute version. Yeah, it's a ""slow"" film but I always wonder what was ""cut"" -- and I still don't know!",1149984000,14,114,4.0

7811654,2,6301275373,"Beryl Reid is Ellie and Flora Robson is Joyce in this very British, and very dull, horror effort.
The film seems like a stage play, as soldiers from a local base are murdered by what seems to be an animal. Ellie and Joyce are spinster sisters living in an isolated house, regularly visited by another young corporal. Ellie and Joyce realize their brother Steven might be responsible for the murders since the victims are all uniformed servicemen, Steven wanted to be in the military, and, oh, he has been walled up in the basement for thirty years.
The attacks on the soldiers are all closeups and blurry shots. The majority of the film has Ellie and Joyce arguing about mundane matters, dancing around the fact that they are sure they know who the killer is. Later in the film, Beryl Reid is given a very nice long scene as she talks to the police about her upbringing, and the circumstances of Steven's imprisonment. Flora Robson is equally good as the level headed sister with a warped maternal instinct.
Because the films feels like a play, there are some very long dull stretches here. The attacks on the soldiers may have been an effort to open the proceedings up a bit, but as horror, this does not work. Also, the running time reads 89 minutes, and IMDB has a version listed with thirteen additional minutes. This is obvious in a couple of very strange edits and shortened scenes. There is also little suspense to the killer's identity, since all the reviews and video box notes I read told of the brother. The cast does not figure it out until well into the film.
Reid and Robson, two grand dames of British film and television, are excellent in their roles. It is too bad director Kelly could not come up with better material to match his actresses' performances. I cannot recommend this film.
This is rated (R) for physical violence, mild gun violence, gore, and some sexual content.",1023235200,3,1894,4.6398809523809526
