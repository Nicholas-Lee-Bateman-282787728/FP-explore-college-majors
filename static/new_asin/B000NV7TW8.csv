8181479,5,B000NV7TW8,"I have purchased several Mini-series and movie greats. ""Rich Man Poor Man"" was one of the first BIG TV epics. Even ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""Dr Zhavago"" failed to hold up to repeat viewing. They just did not seem to have the same sparkle. THIS VIDEO HAS BEEN OUTSTANDING EVERY TIME I VIEWED IT. It has good cop, bad cop. Racial prejudice and racial support. It contains mystery, suspense, love and hate. It was one of the first to explore serial killing in a ""soft"" manner without showing the killing and sexual deviation. I rate this video as one of the great TIME TESTED movies.

8181480,1,B000NV7TW8,"The first 3 discs have defective audio and are in German even though the menu says English. The menu allows you to choose English, but when it comes on it is in German. So what you have is a defective menu. The International version is in English, but is abridged so you are paying too much money for one disc that is not even the complete series. You have been warned.",1211241600,11,369,4.211267605633803
