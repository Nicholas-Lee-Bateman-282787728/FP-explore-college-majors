4146358,1,B003L77GMO,"3000 human beings gave a review on this and more than 90% loved it...the whole film uses the most crass language, talk is centered around stupid, insipid, nonsense, and the lives of all people involved is narrow, shallow, uninspiring, and embarrassing. Witless people taking up space in a world that is run by people with feathers for brains and wasting oxygen.on ungodly people all on their way to hell.  And this is entertainment for the masses.  No wonder the NWO wants to replace humans with machines and robots and kill off 85% of the world's population and use the rest for their servants.  The only reason I'm even watching parts of these bottom-feeder movies is because Amazon won't replace all the trash movies and put in good one's.",1503705600,,742,4.78125

By season 3 you wonder why he has any friends, yet they keep inviting him. And the broad stereotypes of any character who isn't Jewish are offensive, especially blacks, latinos and asians.

4148307,1,B003L77GMO,"First, my bona fides.  I watched and enjoyed the first three seasons of this series.  I lost contact with it for a while and borrowed season 8 from a friend to see if it was still good.  It isn't.  In the first ten minutes of episode one Larry suggests that his lawyer could get a (censored sex act) under his desk simply because it is spacious.  Then, upon meeting Cheryl's lawyer, Larry feels compelled to mention that he is bald, and when Cheryl asks why he has to say that, he justifies it by saying ""It's just like how black guys can call each other n***er"".  Except of course it isn't-this is a false equivalency, because when black guys encounter each other they don't say ""Hey you're a n***er like me!""  And then, in  a restaurant Larry shares his buffet with Jeff.  When the waiter calls him on it, he says ""What's the difference""?, as if we don't all know buffet etiquette, viz., you don't share.  In their strain for story lines they have made Larry into an imbecilic cretin.  Obviously the well was dry but they put out a series anyway.",1480118400,,1048,4.40625

4148379,4,B003L77GMO,"Customary irony, with Larry's character's ego and mouth unable to contend with other people's circumstances, thereby placing him in hot water from start to finish.  Gary Cole belting Larry was unexpected and rather funny.  The group gathered around a fallen Larry was a bit surreal, and the lady who tended to his injury offered the obligatory karma bite-back.  If you are a Curb fan, you'll enjoy this one.  Ann Ryerson's role is a bit too brief.  But everyone (except in perhaps the forced scenes with the Girl Scouts) is in top comic form.",1479600000,,542,4.78494623655914

If you like his ""sthick"" and his sense of humor you will really enjoy this show. I think that sometimes he goes a little far over the edge in introducing subjects which I feel a little squemish about , but so be it.  This show is very entertaining and the story line has a cast of familiar characters and the interplay between them is humorous and the endings are unexpected. I think this series is very entertaining and will put you in a good mood. This show is a real upper. Larry David is a genius in writing sit coms and in writing dialogue as well as being a wonderful actor.

Normally the cynical attitude of a lead character (Larry David) would wear thin after a few episodes, but he somehow manages to keep it interesting. Probably because I (and some others I know) identify with his triggers and breaking points. Only he gets to vent every time he's confronted. At times it may border on offensive to some, but then again so did All in The Family- and we all managed to somehow survive that.",1467331200,2,558,4.3238095238095235

4151447,5,B003L77GMO,"When Jerry Seinfeld concluded his little ""show about nothing"" in 1998, I found myself comedically bereft and completely disinterested in absolutely any comedy show that followed. Nothing I watched lasted more that a single episode; not The Office, not Parks and Rec, not Scrubs, not 30 Rock or any of the other fine shows that came after. None of them, and I do mean NONE of them were Seinfeld. Seemed like I would be reduced to watching Seinfeld re-runs for my ""fix"" for the rest of my life! Thank goodness he was playing somewhere at sometime 24/7/365! Since I didn't have HBO, it was several seasons before I stumbled upon Curb Your Enthusiasm on Netflix (THANK HEAVENS!!!), but once I did, it seemed as if there was another ""show about nothing"" that I could watch and enjoy! WHAT A RELIEF!!!! After watching CYE front to back from beginning to end, it seemeed as if I was more receptive to comedies again! Hallelujah!!! Thanks to Larry David and CYE, I am now once more able to watch and enjoy sitcoms like The Big Bang Theory, Modern Family, and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. All I can postulate in regard to this situation is that I was so addicted to Seinfeld I just couldn't quit him ""cold turkey""  and move on with my life. Somehow finding CYE & Larry David when I did acted as my ""methadone"" and allowed me to ween myself off the ""hardstuff"" and enjoy regular comedy again!",1465257600,2,1380,4.587044534412955

Mr. David has a grasp of humanity that few in the comedic world display today. The episodes make twist and turns that in the end come full circle and it is hard to keep the laughter down. The show finds no topic out of bounds and this i am sure is a turn off for many people but if you enjoy the absurdity of life in general and of California and New York in particular, well then clearly L.D. and his wonderful cast and guest stars is a show you will want to watch.",1464480000,,766,3.9805194805194803

4151560,4,B003L77GMO,"""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", to me, is a bit derivative of ""Seinfeld"".  I have witnessed themes from the aforementioned comedy utilized in Larry David's newer series.  For example, we see mockery of softball games, disabled people, food, and other ""George Costanzian"" neuroses. Nevertheless, the ""real"" George, Larry, never fails to amuse or entertain.  It may be the fastest 28 minutes in TV.",1463788800,,388,5.327868852459017

Some of the episodes are a little weird (too many hospital scenes, Larry!) and some of the jokes go on too long, but overall this is a fantastic example of what a great comedian can do when he is left to his own devices.

This final season got a bit weird--he got divorced, for one--but there are moments of hilarity that only he could write and produce. He's also become a really fine actor. I miss this series, but it's nice to have all eight seasons for FREE on Amazon Prime!!!",1445558400,,635,4.38135593220339

4153091,5,B003L77GMO,"You expect Larry David to lift the veil of social convention. He continues to do so while being self effacing. An outstanding example is when he sees a Japanese tourist give a deep bow to apologize to another tourist.  He inquires about the depth of the bow, mentioning that he got an apology from another Japanese gentleman the other day but didn't receive a 90-degree bow; He only got maybe 15 degrees.  Upon learning that such a shallow bow was being dismissive of him -- well, you Seinfeld fans know what Larry David (aka George Costanza) would do.

4153104,5,B003L77GMO,"As a huge Seinfeld fan and later on a huge Curb fan, I think Larry David is a comical writing/story-telling genius. It also helps that he is such a funny and I dare say an iconic actor/comedian. I admit I was skeptical about ordering this dvd because I honestly didn't think the previous season (with the Seinfeld reunion) was that funny. I guess most all shows are bound to hit a lull and it seemed that is what happened with Curb. However, I just marathon-watched the first dvd of season 8 (there are 2 dvds- eps 1-7 on the first dvd and 8-10 I believe on the second) and each episode has been hilarious, causing me to laugh out loud at Larry's misfortunes. His manager Jeff is also incredibly funny as a supporting character, as is his friend Richard Lewis. These episodes remind me of the brilliance of the first few seasons when the show was absolutely the funniest show on television. I also kind of like his sidekick Leon but I could do without Leon's continuous use of profanity- every other syllable out of his mouth is the f-word. One problem that I have noticed with this dvd though is the audio track is off in several spots within some of the episodes. It's a little distracting but not too big a deal. The price of this dvd is pretty good- marked down from like $30 to $16. This season does not disappoint- the show is brilliant and Larry David is so funny. This is truly the show about nothing but it makes nothing so hilarious and real that you can't get enough of it- at least I can't...",1377907200,4,1504,4.375

Maybe it's because these playful and intelligent comedies smack more of New York City and Los Angeles humor than they do America's heartland. Larry is always getting caught putting his foot in his mouth and that self deprecation makes the show.",1372032000,,415,4.942857142857143

4153116,5,B003L77GMO,"Season 8 is a vast improvement over the tepid Seinfeld reunion theme of the previous series.  In fact, this one is much more ""pure Larry David""-- without the unnecessary embellishments and artifices that only detract from the basic humor that attracts intelligent viewers.  I do believe, however, that the recurring character, ""Tessler"", has outlived his usefulness.  In addition, there is a very real problem incorporating guest stars that don't really fit in with overall style of the show. In particular, the appearances of Ricky Gervais and Rosie O'Donnell come across as kind of awkward, forced and unnatural. Michael J. Fox, however, is much more natural and believable. The overall news is that the luster of the program has been restored and hopefully it will continue to shine in Season 9.",1370390400,,798,5.123076923076923

4153150,5,B003L77GMO,"""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is part of a genre I like to call ""painful comedy."" It's incredibly funny; it's laugh out loud, laugh-until-you-almost-pass-out funny. But it is also very, very painful to watch. It takes the social awkwardness and comedy of errors that was Larry David's previous series, ""Seinfeld,"" and cranks them up to the max.

You can't help but sympathize with Larry and often some of the more innocent bystanders that exist in his world. The situations he's constantly finding himself in are hysterical, but you have to cringe in-between laughing. I often watch this with family and we find that we have to ""take breaks"" very often. While we have been known to watch ""Seinfeld"" on a regular basis for months on end, we're more likely to only watch ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" once every few months as it is, frankly, emotionally exhausting, if you watch with any amount of emotional investment.

Season Eight continues the same level of high-quality writing and improv seen in all the earlier seasons. In this particular story arc, Larry travels to New York, which is an interesting creative choice, as it puts Larry back on his home turf (both the fictionalized Larry of the show and the real Larry). Michael J. Fox has a guest appearance, and it's wonderful guest spot indeed (and yes, Parkinson's Disease forms the basis of a joke and yes, it is funny). Thankfully, too, Larry's long-time roommate Leon, played to perfection by J.B. Smoove, is along for the trip to New York City. Leon is my favorite character on the show, and I hope he remains as a major part of the cast for the rest of the series' run (and heck, why doesn't Smoove have his own show yet?).

The DVD set comes in the same form it has before for pretty much every other season. Special features includes ""Leon's Guide to NYC,"" which is maybe not as funny as J.B. Smoove's usual work (perhaps because he doesn't have any other actors or situations to play off of) but still good for a chuckle, and a really fascinating discussion of the show with the main cast (Jeff's comments comparing the appeal of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" to Pixar films was especially enlightening and memorable).

The improv-style performances of the show continue to prove that with the right actors and outline writers, a script isn't even necessary. If you're a fan of ""Seinfeld"" or previous seasons of the show, then I think you're going to love this DVD set.

It's pretty good. Pretty, pretty, pretty good.",1357516800,,2462,4.769953051643192

4153182,4,B003L77GMO,"I did not set my expectations as high for Season 8 because I was not satisfied with Season 7. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Although this is not the greatest season, it is not the worst either. It is an average season. When Curb has been as good as it has been at times, this season may not seem like enough for some people. Yet overall it is above average Curb and shows Larry David could keep this going if he wanted to.

Season 8 is a mixture of old and new Curb in that there are some familiar routines repeated in different settings and production techniques have been tightened up, this time successfully in most cases. Larry David's maxim, ""If it is scripted it isn't funny"" proved itself out in Season 7's completely fake Seinfeld reunion rehearsals with the crew laughing as the cast read the script. I also thought this proved to be true when Larry did the Mel Brooks Broadway play with all of the shots of people laughing in an earlier season. It is not merely shots of people faking a laugh it is the serious attempt at making something appear funny that isn't. Both cases didn't warrant laughs and went against the grain of LD's adage.

In the beginning Curb was filmed with most actors on camera having just a hint of the topic and left to react naturally to what unfolded. Scenes often involved everyone delivering their lines in one continuous shot. In later seasons LD has relied more on written dialog and editing with each actor delivering separately filmed lines. Until this season the editing had been awkward. It seemed to start as a band-aid revealing the flubs and discomfort that prompted the need to abandon the spontaneity of the earlier approach. In Season 8 this has been successfully tightened up. Perhaps they changed the objective. Use separate takes to build a good scene rather than to repair bad takes. Many scenes work and best of all they are funny most of the time as well.

Jeff Garlin has always been one of the regulars who appears comfortable and manages to be funny under Curb's spontaneous style. Fortunately he is back and included in every episode. J.D. Smoove (Leon Black) has been a great addition as a regular and he follows Larry through the last episode this season. There is very little of Cheryl Hines and Richard Lewis (he has never been more enjoyable than in Curb, IMO). Oddly, Curb veteran Susie Essman is one of the most awkward with the Curb style this season. Missing is Ted Danson another who has been very good. Jeff, Cheryl and Larry have not aged a day since the series began.

With a few minor caveats Season 8 is a good season, not the greatest and not the worst.",1349568000,3,2636,4.5665961945031714

Unfortunately is the worst (I am sorry to say that, but it is the truth). But Larry even on his worst moments is better than everybody else. So I think it is still worth watching.

Dialogues were contrived. I didn't sense spontaneity. Larry was too on the edge, forceful, losing the surprise element. I hope that Curb is not getting old. He tried a change and I commend him for that. The problem is that the end result is not as funny. Maybe the problem was on the execution. I am not sure.

The best episode is the ""Palestinian Restaurant"". That's the episode that the season will remembered for. But even on this one I felt that it was a missed opportunity.

The episode with Ricky Gervais had its moments, the one with Michael J. Fox was mostly flat.

The DVD extra has a 90 minutes quite funny conversation with the cast and Brian Williams. Larry said that he lost his Blackberry and all his notes that was saved in the device. I wonder if it was the notes for this season.",1341187200,13,1144,4.306976744186047

Wow it was shocking how lackluster this entire season was! I'd say all 70 of the episodes from seasons 1-7 plus the pilot/special were at least very good, and most I'd categorize as great. But this season I'd be hard pressed to call any of the 10 episodes anything better than mediocre and even that's pushing it. The stories seemed very forced. There was almost always a very natural/organic way of tying everything together at the end of episodes in the past but not this season. Even the improv scenes between Larry & Jeff Garlin/Richard Lewis that always seemed so genuine come off as scripted (and not all that funny). It doesn't help that previous regulars like Cheryl Hines, Wanda Sykes, Ted Danson & Bob Einstein are either barely around this year or not in it at all. Also there's no arc in this season as opposed to most of the previous years. I noticed in the credits of at least a few episodes that 3 old Seinfeld writers (Berg, Schaffer whom I like ..and Mandel not so much) had story credits along with Larry David. In the past I think the whole story was all Larry so that may have something to do with the change in this season. Maybe there were new directors. Maybe they replaced Alison Jones, who was very good, as casting director because the character actors this year were generally subpar. Maybe it's a combination of many things, but no one who is a true fan of this show can deny this was easily their worst season to date. Ricky Gervais & Michael J. Fox make fun guest appearances, but aside from that I can't think of a reason to waste your time with Season 8. Hopefully there is a season 9 and hopefully it returns the show to the greatness of the past otherwise this shows ends with the same dud that Larry's other show originally went out on.",1339459200,12,1808,4.4787878787878785

The show blurs the line between reality and fiction and the scripts consist only of scene outlines, giving it a fresh and spontaneous narrative and improvisational quality.  Jeff Garlin plays Larry's friend and manager, but it's Susie Essman as Jeff's wife who steals every scene she's in with her hilarious, X-rated tirades against Larry or anyone else who crosses her.

4153213,5,B003L77GMO,"This show is pure class. While season 5 had some disappointing moments here and there, I would rank every other season as pure, perfect comedic gold.  The show, for the most part, keeps getting better and better... it started airing about 13 years ago (there are huge gaps between the seasons, hence why it's only on season 8) and they've just continued to progress, impress, and evolve the show; how it delivers humor, how the stories link up, and what it all means. This is brilliant humor, but it's also daring humor.

Some people miss Cheryl, some people don't like the new NY locales, some people aren't fans of the writing. But I honestly think this is the single all-around FUNNIEST season (and may end up being one of the best seasons overall when reflected upon later; it'll be hard to top season 3, though).  I am glad I didn't pay attention to the negative reviews. The show HAS changed but it's totally for the better.

4153217,5,B003L77GMO,"I was a huge Seinfeld fan.  I never expected to like CURB as much.  I've watched every season and, if anything, it is better than Seinfeld. This is because with Larry there are no holds barred.  He is the whole comic all on his own who shines even brighter with a supporting cast but really needs no comic foil. I enjoyed Cheryl Hines when she was on playing his wife but Larry is more believable as a single guy.

This season has so many funny moments that it would be an impossible task to recount them all. There is one where Larry's big thing becomes that he has to have a Jewish divorce lawyer. And he talks an LA team owner into doing the same.  So they both drop a top notch divorce lawyer and get a Jewish incompetent to represent them for predictable results. People really do silly things like this when choosing lawyers so it couldn't be any more spot on.

Larry also has a superb feud with Michael J. Fox that is just brilliant.  Larry is rarely bested but here he is up against a disabled philanthropist who is slyly thinking up things by the moment to drive Larry crazy.  And does he ever!

Larry's black roommate is, as always, hilarious.  The two of them together is always top flight.  There is one episode where they are mistakenly taken for a gay couple which is hilarious.  But they always end up together, whether in LA, NYC or even Paris! It's almost too bad they aren't gay as they are perfect for one another.

Suzie is her foul mouthed best every time she appears onscreen.  jeff is his usual obnoxious self. Richard Lewis and Larry make their usual odd couple pairing as well.  They have been friends in real life since summer camp as kids but it is always a relationship in turmoil.  They wouldn't have it any other way either. This time Larry manages to convince Richard's new girlfriend to get a breast reduction operation when the main reason Richard likes her is because she has huge breasts!

When asked where the title of the show came from, Larry's response was: ""It reflects my perception that many people seem to live their lives projecting false enthusiasm, which I believes is used to imply that ""they are better than you.""

Do I miss Cheryl?  Yes, I do.  I would have chosen to keep her in the cast, but her departure opened up a lot more opportunities to put Larry in hilarious and awkward situations with women.  And Larry is the same as he is with women as he is with everyone else - he acts just like Larry.  Leon is a great part of the cast - he's very ""Krameresque"" with his constant following of Larry wherever he goes and mooches off of him, but he says the most funny, silly, random things.

I have all seven seasons so far, and can't wait to add this to my collection!  The replay value is great.  I go through them about once a year and I still laugh as hard as ever.  It's possible to watch these shows out of order and laugh, but there are enough life changes throughout the series (unlike Seinfeld) that make it more logical to watch it in order.

There better be another season!",1319932800,28,1462,4.327205882352941

4153221,5,B003L77GMO,This season was just as hilarious as the one's with Cheryl. I especially loved the Palestinian kebab vs the Jewish deli episode. No comedy today can hold a candle to Curb.,1317081600,30,171,4.548387096774194

8399586,5,B003L77GMO,"I have to start by saying that ""Martin"" is my favorite sitcom of all-time. Martin was hilarious, and as a black man, I could relate to most of the content on the show. And again, Martin was funny as hell to boot! Now fast forward some decades, yes decades later. You see, I got on the ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" train late. But once I got on, I did not want to get off. I tell you, I have watched every single episode of every single season multiple times. And some episodes more than others. This is a well-written comedy that never lets up. In only got better with each season. Easiest show to binge watch if need be. Do yourself a favor and watch this show if you haven't.",1517097600,,671,4.209302325581396

8399588,1,B003L77GMO,"This is the worst show ever. The foul language is appalling. The Girl Scout getting her period is appalling, I mean that is not even a realistic thing.  The Jews will hate this, as will the Palestinians. JB Smoove swears all the time and I'm sure it's because his character is black. Richard Lewis looks like he is ready for a casket...today. The show is not funny, not fun. I'm no prude but I can't stand the language in this show, you'd think that none of these actors go to church, ever. You also wonder why they wrote this show?  I don't understand it. It just seems like they will do whatever they can to swear on TV.  I stopped watching HBO because of that. Now, I'm still voting for Roy Moore, but what's your point?",1512518400,,723,4.301470588235294
