8286370,1,B001CB14ZG,"This video is presented as a means of arranging a ""Do-it-yourself"" Safari. It is not. There are no lists of contacts for accommodation options, travel options, or even safari options. There are no prices at all, let alone price comparisons. It is a somewhat amateurish holiday video put together by Roger Wolfe Media Services. It lasts only twenty minutes, and costs five times the price per minute that you would pay for a blockbuster movie.
Unless you are willing to pay a lot of money for a short home movie type holiday flick, it is just not worth the price.",1221436800,,562,4.63
8286371,2,B001CB14ZG,"Well, you can't do much of a do-it-yourself video in 18 minutes so I should have known.  This DVD has a little interesting information, but is fairly unambitious.  Not many details about the various camps and no advice about specific travel routes throught the park.",1217116800,2,266,4.888888888888889
