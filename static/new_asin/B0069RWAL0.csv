4980884,5,B0069RWAL0,"There are a lot of Christian movies that have Christian beliefs as the main theme, and then develop plots around those themes. What is nice about this movie is that it focuses on a main theme and adds a few (thankfully subtle) Christian elements to support that theme, but elements that can actually be considered universal. In other words, you don't have to be Christian to appreciate the movie, and the movie certainly doesn't attempt to get you to become a Christian. It is really just a good, solid, movie that holds one's interest from start to finish. It has some really powerful scenes, and it has an important, universal message that will speak to people of all faiths. It is a movie that everyone in the family can - and should - watch, particularly people who question the value and purpose of their lives. In sum, this movie can really make a difference in people's lives - regardless of their faith (or lack of it).",1331424000,13,927,4.590361445783133
4980885,5,B0069RWAL0,"Christian Comedy -- that's a mostly untapped movie genre with unlimited potential.  And yet the newly released Me Again has to be placed at or near the top of this list of humor-filled faith-based films.  I found myself laughing again and again throughout this film that was at times downright goofy and yet at other times more meaningful than I expected.  We all need to spend more time thinking through what life is really like for the people around us who are broken and hurting in so many ways, instead of dismissing, judging, or ignoring them.  It's time to reach out and make a difference in people's lives, helping them fall more in love with our Savior!  Lots of chuckles, smiles, and a great message -- what more could you ask for in a movie that the whole family will enjoy?",1328918400,35,784,4.531914893617022

4980897,5,B0069RWAL0,Wonderful movie. I think that it is pretty good to do a movie of someone having to live the life of someone else. It makes us think harder about what is actually going on in other people lives before we jump the gun with assumptions.,1436918400,,233,4.2

4980906,3,B0069RWAL0,"Warning - Christian family movie. This movie became pretty apparent, pretty fast, especially after having watched ""What If?"", but it was still a decent movie about second chances.",1419724800,,179,5.428571428571429
4980907,5,B0069RWAL0,Hilarious. We loved this movie. We have already shared it with friends. We will watch it again and again.,1413936000,,105,4.578947368421052
4980908,5,B0069RWAL0,"With a touch of the supernatural, this movie kept us on the edge of our seats and sometimes seemed unbelievable, although it really wasn't.  Not your usual kind of movie, but extremely enjoyable.  We'd recommend it in a heartbeat.",1412812800,2,230,4.871794871794871
4980909,5,B0069RWAL0,This movie simulates the TV Show Quantum Leap but with christian overtones and very done.,1409270400,,89,5.0
4980910,5,B0069RWAL0,It was very entertaining and true.  Many times we are not greatful for what we have in life until something bad happens so that we can appreciate what we had before.,1408924800,,165,4.32258064516129
4980911,5,B0069RWAL0,This is a great DVD.  My family loves it.  We watch it often.,1405296000,2,61,3.6153846153846154
4980912,4,B0069RWAL0,"Yes it's me again and again, just like groundhog day. It is spiritually entertaining and sometimes funny. The price was right so I can't complain.",1399248000,,146,4.88
4980913,4,B0069RWAL0,"You've heard the saying, ""an oldie but a goodie?"" Me Again is one of Pure Flix Entertainment's older titles, but if you haven't seen it and are looking for a comedy with a Christian message, I recommend this one. While the theme is a little similar to Pure Flix's ""What If,"" and there are a few sections that I found to be a little corny, I still found myself laughing at this poor man's escapades. It's a classic case of ""beware what you wish"" as Rich is tossed from body to body so he can learn to appreciate the life God gave him.

I give this one 3.5 out of 5 stars.",1391385600,,570,4.089285714285714
4980914,5,B0069RWAL0,"Many people are familiar with the movie ""It's a Wonderful Life"" of a man who wishes he had never been born and finds out how that affects people he cares about. This movie is also about a man who doesn't like his life (or himself) and finds out, instead, what life is like for others by becoming them. ""Me Again"" is a very funny, clever twist on ""It's a Wonderful Life"", but while that movie is a drama, this one is definitely a comedy. I giggled and belly laughed throughout it (the parts where he lives life as his daughter's boyfriend are especially hilarious), but there are very profound and serious messages in it as well.

 The main character is a pastor who is ineffective (and possibly harmful) as a counselor to the marriage of a young couple with a baby, a wimpy father (his children throw food at him and he barely notices, and he breaks promises to them making them mistrustful of him), an emotionally checked out husband, and an overall wishy-washy person. Living life as others gives him drastically new perspectives about how he sees others and himself as well as how God sees people.

 Although this movie is very funny, and I laughed during most of it, I was in tears (the kind most of us experience when we hear Truth spoken) by the end of it. What he tells the young couple with the baby is something every new parent should hear, and what he tells his congregation is what everyone should hear. This movie is on my wish list to buy to watch again and to share with others.",1391299200,,1493,4.418181818181818
4980915,2,B0069RWAL0,"I saw David White in Brother White which I did like, so I brought this one as well. Needless to say, I thought that he sold out to this one. Boring!! I keep falling asleep on this one. I don't like to see him in a skirt. I don't think that God told him to do that, and it was just displeasing to me in every form or fashion. Try again, and stay consistent when you finally get it. In my opinion, you are not there yet. Make sure that you are hearing from God, and not conforming to the ways of the world.",1389398400,4,504,3.855769230769231
4980916,4,B0069RWAL0,"Pretty good movie. Family-oriented movie, although some things may have to be explained to the smaller children. The story line was interesting. Enjoyed it with family!",1384560000,,168,5.5
4980917,4,B0069RWAL0,Very good movie for the whole family. I wish it had Spanish language! Fun and deep at the same time. Very good acting.,1384128000,,118,4.173913043478261
4980918,5,B0069RWAL0,I saw parts of this on tv and orderd it. David R White is a good Christian actor so you know anything he is in is family friendly. This one had some fun moments in it. Especially the fish.,1383177600,,188,3.8461538461538463
4980919,5,B0069RWAL0,"Movie great, sound very low.  The poor guy needs to get his life in order, but was a very cute movie",1376870400,,100,3.761904761904762
4980920,5,B0069RWAL0,"totally enjoyed this movie, totally glad I bought it for us and
to bring to movie nights at church or someone's home! =)

highly recommended to watch....",1370995200,,153,4.666666666666667
4980921,2,B0069RWAL0,"And I like this guy too.  For David A.R. White, this is right up his alley.  I think he could do this kind of comedy blindfolded.  However, the script was kinda pitiful, and even the content was way out and the Mr. Limpet fish thing was just terrible.  Everything about this film was just low budget and corny.  Now, it wasn't awful, and had some cute parts but the editing was choppy, and for the most part, it was really slow moving.  I bought it on BluRay and would loan it to others, but would rather give the film ""What If"" as a gift to someone though.  Would I watch it again?  Only if I had to.  It's not bad enough to shove through the shredder, I mean my teen children didn't baulk after it was over and even my oldest son (17 yrs old) said he kinda liked it.  Hope this helps....",1367798400,2,789,4.098039215686274
4980922,4,B0069RWAL0,Typical body switch movie. My mom seemed to enjoy this one. Ive seen it a couple of times but not really something I would watch over and over. If you like this type of movie it is clean and has a good message.,1366502400,,210,3.9069767441860463
4980923,4,B0069RWAL0,"Fun.  Serious.  Insightful.  I like movies with David A.R. White.  Have Ali Landry here too.

A good flick all round.",1365638400,,117,4.65
4980924,5,B0069RWAL0,This movie is a must see must have. It is great for the whole family to enjoy. I loved it so much I had to buy it.,1362614400,,114,3.259259259259259
4980925,2,B0069RWAL0,"Didn't like that he was dressed like a woman when he ""became"" different people.  I get the plot, nice idea to put yourself into others shoes.  Just not expecting the male wearing female stuff in a family movie. Threw it out for that reason. Didn't want to have to be explaining that to the kids I take care of and my grandkids, and want better example for my friends.  Other than that it would have been a good movie.",1360972800,4,417,4.253164556962025
4980926,4,B0069RWAL0,"I almost always enjoy David A.R. White and this movie was no exception. The plot was a little bizarre at times - shades of Freaky Friday meets It's a Wonderful Life.  The hero who starts out the movie as a zero, learns some valuable lessons as do the viewers, if they don't already know them. The number one cause of unhappiness is our lack of gratitude to God for the life we have, focusing on the things we don't have instead of the blessings we do possess. Having lost my wife and children to a divorce, I can relate to the pain the hero was going through as he faced the possibility of that disaster striking his life. Divorce is a very painful and destructive decision. People planning to get married should see movies like this before they say I do. And they should get regular booster shots to remind them.",1359072000,,813,4.3841059602649
4980927,3,B0069RWAL0,"Not David White's best, but it was an OK movie. Now that I have seen it, I will say that I would probably order it again - so it wasn't all that bad. If you are looking for a clean, entertaining Christian based movie, this one fits in very well.",1356393600,,245,3.92
4980928,3,B0069RWAL0,"kind of silly, but the story line was kind of scattered. The guy kept transforming into different people, but you never really understood why he became certain people/the lesson behind it. The movie was silly, but had a good message.",1355875200,,233,4.85
4980929,4,B0069RWAL0,"This movie was quite funny but yet a deeper meaining underneath. We all want things to be different ""or If Only"" but at what cost?  Highly recommend it.",1348358400,,152,4.428571428571429
4980930,5,B0069RWAL0,"This is a story of a man who appears in other peoples bodies. Seeing David White dressed as a woman may not be the greatest thing to watch in the world, but I really enjoyed the movie and was glad to have watched it.",1345507200,,216,3.9318181818181817
4980931,5,B0069RWAL0,I got this because there is not many Christian Blu-Ray movie out in the market and the price was also good. The movie was good and the picture was even better. I'm currently building my family based collection and would like to move into the Blu-Ray arena. It's a good choice and the price was right.,1344038400,,300,4.375
4980932,5,B0069RWAL0,product came quick in great shape and a great price who could ask for more? Would use this company again and again for my future DVD orders.,1336953600,,140,4.222222222222222
4980933,1,B0069RWAL0,"Full marks to Pureflix for putting out Christian movies with values (even on Blu Ray!), and to David A R White & his team for trying.  However, despite the encouraging reviews which I read elsewhere, this film really was a let-down and is in some ways a re-hash of the much better film ""What If"" (also released by Pureflix).  I found it very childish, the acting was sub-standard, and the storyline weak. Sorry guys!",1334534400,10,416,4.608108108108108
4980934,1,B0069RWAL0,"I love humor, but this film seldom has it. First of all, while it's okay to do science fiction in a Christian fiction plot, the premise of the main charter's discontentment was so unrealistic that no one can really relate to it. Also, most of us are not interested in seeing guys cross dress even if he is made to look a mess. True, he appears cross dressed only because he is so disgruntled with his life, that besides becoming other people, he happens to end up for a while in woman's body. But if they had simply shown the woman who he temporary was and not him crossed dressed as one, it would have worked well. They would have done much better by copying how the Hollywood film comedy, ""Goodbye Charley"" did it. A playboy was killed and ends up, much to his disliking, being re-incarnated as a beautiful woman played by Debbie Reynolds. But what makes it work is that when Charley now in a woman's body is around his male friend who knows what happened, he as a woman (Debbie Reynolds) acts very much like a man. ""Me Again"" ends well, but I had to do a lot of holding the fast foreword button to get to that part. I can see that some folks liked the movie, but I personally do not recommend it.",1332460800,17,1199,4.2631578947368425
4980935,1,B0069RWAL0,"I rent or buy a lot of ""family-friendly"" movies.  Some time ago, I bought this movie,(cheap), at a pawn shop.  I tried hard to watch it but became bored and irritated by the plot after about half an hour.  Maybe this film gets seriously resurrected later on but I couldn't take more than a half an hour.  The ""minister"" in this film was a slob and a pathetic excuse for a man of God.  Again, maybe he gets revolutionized later on but the acting and the plot during the first half hour were, for me, about as bad as it gets.",1331683200,12,523,4.138613861386139
