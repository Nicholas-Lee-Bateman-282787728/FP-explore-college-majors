3140954,5,B00158K164,"This video gives the audience a front seat in the recording studio and gives us a rare opportunity to see John Mclaughlin's mastery of non western music and his gentle all pervasive leadership of a team of exceptional world musicians. John McLaughlin conceived and wrote the base scores for the five day recording session with particular combinations of instrumentalists in mind. He then proceeded to bring them together to collaborate and improvise on his themes with wonderful results.
A truly uplifting revelation of the creative power of collaboration in music and musicianship.",1213920000,7,582,5.336956521739131

3140956,5,B00158K164,"McLaughlin keeps breaking new ground. The combination of John's compositions and wisdom with the young Indian virtuosos is a fusion of East/West & young/old & structured/jamming & fun/fun.

Watching the creative process is amazing. The power of individuals combines to allow the ensemble to achieve the `floating point' where the created and creator merge.",1209081600,5,356,5.592592592592593

8257772,4,B00158K164,I loved his DVD but I am a huge fan of young bassist Hadrien Feraud who plays on every track on the CD but is completely unmentioned on the DVD.  Not sure if it was a contractual thing but I'd love to see him playing as well as the other fine musicians here.,1278460800,,258,3.8679245283018866

8257776,4,B00158K164,"I have been a big fan of John for almost 40 years. I have most of his albums and try to see him when ever he is on tour. In my opinion, this DVD is much better than going to a concert because you get a more intimate look into the process and the people. Typically at concerts, the sound mixing is poor, you have bad seats, the volume is too loud, plus, there is way too much jamming, which is not what draws me to his music. In this video, you are right there in the studio as they figure things out. It was interesting to see that John sometimes lays down the basic melody on keyboard and uses that to convey to the musicians. Only the keyboard work seems to be written on paper. Although I have followed John's music for many years, I didn't have any sense of his personality. He comes across as very warm and a genuinely nice guy. At one point Louiz Banks (on keyboard) takes improvisation a touch too far and John pulls the plug on that take. Everyone gets a good laugh. The musicians that John brought in are all excellent. I find myself following Louiz's background chords moreso than the guitar work. Sometimes the fingerwork of the guys on strings is so fast that you think that your DVD player momentarily went into fast forward. It's also nice to follow along with music that you may be familiar with, the Floating Point album, which is very nice (too bad they didn't get the grammy).",1239235200,4,1394,4.304182509505703

8257779,5,B00158K164,"After some views if this amazing DVD, and after more than 30 years listening to McLaughlin's music, I have to admit that he is now better than ever.
The comunication with the musician is perfect, as well as the direction of the film.
If you are a fan, you will be satified, if you are a beginer, is a good way to begin.",1217635200,,319,4.079365079365079
8257780,5,B00158K164,"A great documentary with fantastic insight to the recording world of john Mclaughlin. Not only just interviews, there is great deal of  playing as well. You can get pretty close to Johns fretboard to see whats going on . I really don't think that there has been a DVD like this made. If you like music and want to see how it goes down in the studio , get it . Dont forget his instructional DVD on Konokol",1216771200,3,404,4.17948717948718
