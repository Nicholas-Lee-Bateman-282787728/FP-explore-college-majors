She officially objects to the implication that she is a zombie, but as you will soon see in Freaks Of Nature, zombies have all the brains. Josh Fadem was incredibly talented and a pure joy to watch. Nicholas Braun and Mackenzie Davis were convincing and professional. But other than Josh, the greatest fun was offered by Joan Cusack and Bob Odenkirk, who deftly served up a tasty triple-entendre. Josh, Joan, and Bob were hilarious and sublime, setting up the payoff with exquisite skill while straight man Nicholas pitched a perfect game. Highly recommended, especially if you watch it with a smart spouse.",1504828800,,737,4.765625

7486255,2,B01722L9QW,"Here we go again. Hollywood (and the USA) once was a place of dreams, justice, truth and bravery,now it's a political issue, a vehicle for disgusting, aggressive, ignorant, intolerant propaganda to push the nationalistic (yes, like in N...) wish to be great again - or better to show itself better than any other nation. This should and could have been a fun and educative teen movie about tolerance, but instead, even in an Alien movie, Hollywood cannot not slander Europe/Germany by letting the Alien (which is trying to show them their intolerant, hateful ways - ironic) talk with a German accent, by letting the characters insanely chant ""USA, USA..."" and cheering about sustaining their intolerance, fighting off the person trying to show them their ignorance and intolerance and being as propagandistic as can be. If there is any Nazis/Nazi-like behavior, it can be found in Hollywood/USA. In violently trying to make America great again, Hollywood is successively destroying everything that once made America great, that people all over the world admired, who now cannot find any reason anymore to further defend such aggressive, arrogant behavior - other nations overcome their flaws, the USA broadens them and celebrates this approach. A shame.",1498608000,,1253,5.2388059701492535
7486256,4,B01722L9QW,"Bizarre, to say the least.  The plot involves a small town that has been divided into three territories.  A section for vampires, a section for zombies, and a section for normal people.  But the kids from all three sectors have to attend the same school.  And this is a school where the bullies are real monsters.  The film starts with an overused device, the false start.  Then it abruptly stops during an exciting point of action to fall back to what happened yesterday.  The problem is, yesterday is not particularly interesting or entertaining.  Yesterday is a drag and a drudge to get through.  The people in this town and this school are overwhelmingly nasty and vicious.  This is an odd way to start a comedy, with people displaying unsettling fits of rage.  The story also relies heavily on the usual awkward social problems apparent in all movies about high school, compounding these typical problems with the students being zombies or vampires.  The movie doesnt become exciting until the aliens show up to complicate things further.  Then chaos ensues and things become frantic and funny.  But.  You shouldnt have to wait and hope that a movie will eventually get better.  A good movie should be good right from the start.

I like it for the last half which was truly funny.",1498521600,2,1285,4.7681818181818185

I have had this movie in my collection ready to watch for a long time and for the life of me, why didn't I watch it much sooner! Great idea for a movie, great direction in this movie, sensational actors in this movie. Love it so much. I hate that once I watched it that was all. I wanted much more movie. Each and every actor was sensational but I have to admit my 2 favorites were the human, Nicholas Braun and the zombie kid, loved the vampire girl too.

 I do like Zombie movies.  I understand that the whole premise of faulty but I like them any way.  I especially like well made Zombie movies that have good acting, good special effects, a decent script, good Zombie make up and above all ---good sound.  In cheap Zombie flicks one, some or all of these things are lacking.  Not here though folks, this is a genuine Hollywood movie that cost somebody Thirty Three Million Dollars.  Everything is first rate.
 It is still a Zombie flick however.  How they thought they could spend this much money is beyond me.
 The set up I liked as well.  In Dillford Ohio various social/racial factions live more or less harmoniously.  The Vampires are very powerful beings.  They can over come humans on a man to man basis with ease.  They drink blood, which makes humans nervous.  And many of them act like jerks, which does not help relations.  The humans have the numbers but know that they are out classed.  At the bottom of the social ladder are the Zombies.  They are brain dead shamblers, despised by all but seem care free and content.
They wear electric collars to keep them from gnawing on the neighbors.  The factions try to accommodate one another as much as they can and just get along.
 Until the alien invasion throws everything into chaos and the factions turn on each other.
 The three young professional actors represent the three factions.  The teens band together to save the town from the space aliens.  Nicholan Braun (late of 'How to be Single') plays the human.  Mackenzie Davis plays the vampire.  Davis has some 20 acting credits.  Young comic/actor Josh Fadem plays Ned, the Zombie teen.  He has an amazing 110 credits on his sheet.  These youngsters have some solid pros backing them up.
 Denis Leary plays the town rich guy/bully.  The plumb roles in terms of lines in bits go to the human mom and dad played by Joan Cusack and Bob Odenkirk (currently in the star role on TVs 'Better Call Saul').  Lovely young professional actress Vanessa Hudgens plays what the other high school girls refer to as the Vamp/Slut.  She has many credits including one in '13'.
 This three brain Zombie/Vampire/space alien film lasts for one hour and 32 minutes.  It carries an R rating.  The film cost $33 million to make but brought in a teeny tiny $71,000 at the box office.  Sometimes a film has more money in the budget than is good for it but this is a horrible blunder.  The poor producers will have to move to Compton.
 Fun Fact-Brian Peck and Beverly Randolph have non speaking roles as a pair of Zombie parents.  They both appeared in the 1985 film 'Return of the Living Dead'.",1469836800,,2648,4.61505376344086

High production values, casting helped tons, good editing, not-horrible CGI, script was way smarter than it was funny, crisp writing, acting patched up any weak parts in the script, over-the-top humor was seldom all that funny, gory parts were too funny to be gory, plot was for a TV sitcom 22 minutes, but it stretched out nicely.  Fast pace kept sucking me back into the film only to kick me out of the movie with outrageous silliness for which I inexplicably kept forgiving the director.  Again and again, slap-stick and pie-in-the-face jokes, but it never really got ""that old,"" and then the ending didn't fail to deliver.  But I can't tell my future self to ever watch this film again.  But if I do come across it, years hence, if I don't remember it, but here's this review, I'd say, ""Yeah, future me, now you can watch it again.""  Otherwise it's a one-shot deelybobber.

Also the story was going too quick and didn't really felt gelled and natural...i liked the british actor, because i rralize hes actually kinda sexy(he from the OC or gossip girl tv show), the girl who played the vampire totally looks like zoey deschanels sister or something but i didn't really like her in this movie. The main actor, he plays alot of these roles type but hes a likeable actor and i see he glowed up since his skyhigh days(disney superheroe movie)..the indian was alright but did a good job playing the zombie i guess. This movie had potential and had chances to be funny and with all the characters(actors) it had and what it was able to work with..but it just fell flat and amateurish.

7486304,2,B01722L9QW,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

While so many are concerned with the zombie apocalypse after the huge number of zombie movies in the past few years we now have a horror/comedy that poses the possibility of a bigger threat involving an apocalypse involving all kinds of creatures. Is it possible to mingle these concepts together and get a movie thats not only relevant but fun to watch as well?

Welcome to Dillford, a town known only for its riblets. Yes the one thing this town is known for are those rib type concoctions that grace sandwiches with no quite clear definition of what they are made of. Myself I would have thought the town was known more for the fact that the inhabitants of the town are a combination of humans, vampires and zombies. Who knows though, perhaps the entire world is this way now though thats never addressed.

Apparently a way has been found to get each of these groups to co-exist. The zombies have what appears to be shock collars and the vampires don't bite anyone who doesnt want bitten or at least coerced into requesting that bite. In the midst of these groups is young Dag (Nicholas Braun), a teen in love with the popular girl Lorelei (Vanessa Hudgens) who of course never notices him. While Dag is the center piece of the movie two other characters revolve around him until all three are joined together.

Petra (Mackenzie Davis) is a young girl attracted to one of the vampires. Instead of the usual come on baby you know you want it referring to sex, Petra ends up being bitten and turned into a vampire, something shes not quite thrilled about.

Then there is Ned (Josh Fadem), a loner and target of bullies, vampire and human alike, and the ex-best friend of Dag. Alone and with no one to turn to, Ned eventually opts to become a zombie and allows himself to be bitten. But it is Ned and Dag who discover that while zombies crave brains those that do without eventually have the ability to use their own rather than be senseless stumbling creatures.

The three friends are tossed together one night after all of their changes have occurred as an alien invasion takes place. It seems the aliens are attacking Dillford for some unknown reason, taking out everyone be they humans, zombies or vampires. When the three friends are brought together only they can solve the problem of the alien attack.

Sounds like an interesting movie, right? Well the concept certainly does and when reading the box you might think so. But the reality is that it only comes off so-so. It becomes difficult at first to walk into the film as if you're already well aware of the world in which it takes place, sort of like watching the third episode of a series. Then there is the pacing which only slows down on rare occasions but for the most part rushes so fast that as you're contemplating what just happened something else happens and then another before the first is processed.

I have to assume everything was played tongue in cheek because everything here is painted with such broad strokes that it comes off cartoony at best. The bad guy (Dennis Leary) might as well be Bluto with what little depth is given to the character. But that holds true for most of the characters here. All seem cardboard cutouts rather than real people. There are no characters to root for or sympathize with which makes the events taking place around them less horrific or important. Had the movie been made in all CGI it would not seem much different than the end product we have here.

That may seem harsh but its true. And yet if thats the sort of thing you enjoy then you may end up loving this movie. It has its moments but they are few and far between. Perhaps there are enough to make this movie one that would play well on a late Saturday night but for regular viewing it is lacking. Teens may love it, beer fueled party goers might love it but for the rest it doesnt deliver on the promises of the concept.",1456876800,,3947,4.524544179523142

In Freaks of Nature, we welcome you to Dillford, where three days ago, everything was peaceful and business as usual: the vampires were at the top of the social order, the zombies were at the bottom, and the humans were getting along in the middle. But this delicate balance was ripped apart when the alien apocalypse arrived in Dillford and put an end to all the harmony. Now it's humans vs. vampires vs. zombies in all-out, blood-sucking, brain-eating, vamp-staking mortal combat - and all of them are on the run from the aliens. It is up to three teenagers - one human, one vampire, and one zombie - to team up, figure out how to get rid of the interplanetary visitors, and try to restore order to this ""normal"" little town.

This movie is quite simply a little gem that popped out of nowhere, a terrific blend of zombie and vampire horror comedy with an alien twist thrown in the mix, seeing these come together in one movie works really well with a smart story and great laugh out loud comedy that's well written, the characters in the movie are all great lead actor Nicholas Braun is really good and vampire girl Mackenzie Davis is great too, the effects in this movie are really well done, a great budget spent well by the looks of it, the movie is bloody and comically gory in places, this is certainly higher up than your usual straight out to home video efforts, make sure you check this one out, top entertainment.

7486313,4,B01722L9QW,"Humans have learned to coexist with vampires and zombies in Freaks Of Nature, but we don't realize how fragile this arrangement is until aliens invade (yes, as if it weren't ludicrous enough prior to aliens arriving). The first quarter-hour seems like amateur hour, but Freaks gains momentum after Ned's brother gets clocked in the face with a fastball, followed by an introduction to Dag's hippie parents (Bob Odenkirk and Joan Cusack). Freaks dramatically picks up the pace at a half-hour in when tensions boil over between the three ""ethnic"" groups (vamps, zombies, and humans), all too familiar as an analogy to ethnic conflicts / race relations IRL.

Plenty of good actors for such an oddball flick. Vanessa Hudgens was obviously intended to be the bombshell, but she was just a decoy for the real knockout, Mackenzie Davis. Josh Fadem was so convincing as a zombie that you have to wonder if he got staggeringly drunk to pull off the requisite sloppy movements (flopping helplessly, etc.) of conventional zombification. The formidable Werner Herzog did the voice of the Perfect Being, the venerable Momo Yashima played the ""Overtly Racist Vamp #1,"" and funnyman Patton Oswalt had a cameo as a conspiracy theorist / bomb shelter survivalist.

Read the flyers on the bulletin boards and the graffiti in the segregated zombie part of town. Not only for subtle humor, but for subtle social commentary (as many aspects of the movie seem to be intentionally metaphorical, e.g., Zombie Priest). Freaks Of Nature may not have you laughing out loud often, but you may end up with a brain-eating grin on your face for a good portion of this absurdist tale.",1456012800,,1652,4.981884057971015

7486319,4,B01722L9QW,"I was bored one night so decided to rent a movie from the big red machine. So I got online and looked at the selections and decided on the movie Freaks Of Nature. What originally attracted me to this film was the cover art. It's got an 80's retro camp look to it and I'm a sucker for 80's nostalgia. Well, after reading a few horrible reviews I decided to pick up this movie anyways and I'm glad I did. So what's Freaks of Nature all about? Well in a nutshell it's about a world where humans, vampires, and zombies coexist peacefully in everyday life. Then out of nowhere aliens show up and turn the town upside down. The film is set in Dillford where the riblet is king. The movie revolves around teenagers Dag Parker (human), Petra (recently turned vampire), and Ned (recently turned zombie).

Freaks of Nature doesn't take itself too seriously and can be fast paced and completely ridiculous at times. Although I didn't find this movie to be a laugh out loud comedy, I found it to be a very entertaining experience. The actors did a nice job and the story is pretty original (well as original as a vampire/zombie/alien movie can get). Overall, I enjoyed this movie and it will probably find it's way into my dvd collection sooner or later. I give it a solid 3.5 to 4 stars.",1455408000,13,1276,4.4297872340425535

The movie is a comedy that takes place in a world where zombies, vampires, & humans pretty much coexist smoothly but when aliens show up all heck breaks loose.  As result of the chaos a teenage zombie, vampire, & human team up to save the world.  The movie is rated R for violence & language.  Personally l didn't think either was done to excess.  I laughed quite a bit while I watched this so the humor worked for me.",1455321600,,548,4.43

7486323,5,B01722L9QW,"I hadn't really heard anything about this movie other than some mixed reviews, but upon viewing the retro cover art and noticing the stellar cast, I decided to give it a shot; I was not disappointed.

This movie definitely gives off a campy, 80s-throwback-high-school-film sort of vibe, and it's fully of subtly funny moments. The humor is definitely to an acquired taste, and it's not for everyone - you'll either get the jokes, or you won't. Was there anything laugh-out-loud, wet your pants funny? No, but the quirkiness is fun, charming, and just works for the film. There's lots of extended dialogue, so if you're not into that, this may not be for you.

Humans, vampires, and zombies coexisting with one another struggle to set aside their prejudices and differences when aliens invade their small town...sounds super unrealistic, right? What surprised me was how believable they made the town (home of the riblett) and its characters. You could really tell that all the actors had fun on set, even the ones who didn't get a great deal of screen time. Denis Leary, Michael Keegan (Key), Ed Westwick, Joan Cusack, and Vanessa Hudgens, to name a few, all have supporting roles, and each other their characters adds something unique to the storyline.

The three main characters - a human, a newly-turned vampire, and a newly-turned zombie, are at the heart of this film, and they end up having to work together to figure out how to save their town. If you're on the fence, give the film a try! It is definitely a film that does not take itself seriously, and neither should you. It is meant to be what it is - campy, fun, entertaining.",1455235200,3,1638,4.7403508771929825

7486326,4,B01722L9QW,"I enjoyed ""Freaks of Nature"" very much.  Why?  Because it NEVER took itself seriously.  The story is the people of Dillford, Anywhere, USA, all seem to be able to get along.  That in itself may not seem like much, but when you take into consideration Dillford is divided into three categories of people, i.e. humans, vampires, and zombies, they definitely deserve a pat on the back!  Everything is fine...until some aliens decide to stop over for a visit.  Then, all Hell breaks loose.

Nicholas Braun plays Dag, a hopeless, cannot-get-l*aid high school guy, whose focus for the loss of his virginity is completely lost on Lorelei (played by super sexy Hudgens.  Mackenzie Davis plays Petra, a girl who falls for a super sexy vampire AND the oldest pickup lines in recorded history.  She gives herself shamelessly to him...and now he won't return her phone calls!  Then, there is poor old Ned, played extremely well by Josh Fadem, who decides that since he has received his first failing grade in his entire life, has no reason to live, so he has a zombie bite him.  Little do these three know it will be up to them to save their beloved town.

I will be the first to say the script is all over the place, but so what.  I knew I wasn't going to be watching Fellini.  Still, this movie delivers some of the best one-liners I have ever heard, including ""You just ate my piano teacher.""  Keegan-Michael Key plays vamp teacher, Mr. Keller.  He does a great job at channeling his teacher from Mad TV into this role.  The supporting cast is on target and because it seemed like they were all having fun, so did I.

Rated ""R"" for violence, language, and brief nudity, I found ""Freaks of Nature"" a nice change of pace.  Recommended.",1455062400,7,1724,4.57516339869281
7486327,3,B01722L9QW,"Freaks of Nature takes place in the town of Dillford, where three days ago everything was peaceful, with business as usual. The vampires were at the top of the social order, zombies at the bottom, and humans were getting along in the middle. This balance was upset when the alien apocalypse arrived in Dillford and put an end to all the harmony. Now its humans vs. vampires vs. zombies in mortal combat, with all of them on the run from the aliens. It falls to three teenagers  one human (Nicholas Braun), one vampire (Mackenzie Davis), one zombie (Josh Fadem)  to join forces, determine how to get rid of the interplanetary visitors, and restore order to Dillford.

The three young leads are burdened with a script that tries far too hard to be funny, with jokes that fall flat and and attempts at clever exposition that come off as contrived, and the films episodic nature makes for a disjointed mess with little cohesion. Many scenes have the look and sound of improvisation. If the scenes were indeed improvised, they do little to pep up the chuckles.

The movie isn't salvaged by a parade of guest stars that includes Denis Leary, Bob Odenkirk, Joan Cusack, Pat Healy, Mae Whitman, Vanessa Hudgens, and Patton Oswalt.

The blend of so many disparate forces may have looked cool on paper, but doesnt translate to the screen. This may be a movie for serious aficionados of horror/comedy. Others will find it pretty lame.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include a gag reel, deleted scenes, and an alternate opening.",1454803200,,1524,4.775665399239544

7486329,4,B01722L9QW,"Theres a fascinating aspect to this movie, for me anyway. Its a horror/comedy, and I never laughed at it once, but I was still highly entertained. Go figure. Its a fun movie, just not funny. Odd, but respectable still. The acting is very good, the direction has a pretty awesome pace and the story is actually pretty great. About half the movie is fun and then the second half is just chaotic human/vampire/zombie/alien fights with its fair share of bloodshed. The practical FX and make-up are really good and even the CGI isn't half bad. I really liked this flick, while nothing tremendous for the genre, its a really good time killer and I was definitely entertained.

7486330,4,B01722L9QW,"In the small town of Dillford, known for ""the riblet"" (McRib)  there are three major cliques in the town/high school. These are zombies, vampires, and humans. One vampire resembles Edward named Milan Panache (Ed Westwick)  from ""Twilight"" and likes human Petra (Mackenzie Davis) because she is ""pale and veiny"" There exists quirky situations where the one liners are frequent and humorous. When the aliens attack, a human, vampire, and zombie team together to save the town.

This is a campy film. The film is funny, but not hilarious. It is cult in nature, but falls short from being a cult classic. If you liked ""The Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse""  this one I would place a peg below.  Not for everyone.
