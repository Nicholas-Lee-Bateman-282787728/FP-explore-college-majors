8370599,5,B002HXVT8A,"Decent story about street racers with some dynamic relationships between the characters. A lot of tuner cars in here so don't expect high end luxury vehicles. However, the budget is used well and the races are well done. Good looking girls, fast cars, likable people, and the story is pretty good too. I would put this movie between Fast and Furious 1 and Red Line.",1404691200,,365,4.630769230769231
8370600,3,B002HXVT8A,"Katie Reed (Erin Cahill) can't make money with an auto repair shop because she spends all her money on hot cars she uses to race illegally in the streets and make wagers. Her boyfriend is a cop (Andrew W. Walker) who races one of the cars...and is looking for a gang of robbers. Eric (Joseph Beattie) is a pizza delivery boy who wants to race cars and Nicole (Alexia Barlier) is a rich woman who likes thrills and pays to build a car. To the dismay of her boyfriend, Katie doesn't use money to pay the interest on her shop loan, a shop she is going to lose unless she can raise $50,000 in a few days. I think you got the picture.

The plot is formulaic making it nearly impossible to create a decent character. Erin Cahill does a good job struggling through the script, the rest was cardboard. Dialog needed some help.

8370601,3,B002HXVT8A,"...Andrew Walker tells the hot blonde he's teaching how to drift for the first time. I watch Andrew Walker's movies because he seems to have such great potential (possibly this young actor's greatest achievement to date is his role in Steel Toes). His accent always gives away the secret that he is Canadian, the maple leaf part of his tattoo always inked out depending on the relevance of the film he's doing. This movie has lots of gorgeous people in it, good music, some drama, some humor, cool stunts that include cars flying through the air and inexplicably crashing through brick and cement walls, a decent well-choreographed fight scene, topless girls, and lots of over-the-top racing action. It is a light movie, not too serious (although some bad guys do get shot and one loses his hand in a race) with a goofy easy happy ending. The film editing perhaps would appeal more to teenage boys by the transition of each scene being brought on by a flaming wheel with NASCAR-esque sound effects, but it was a fun movie to watch if you're in the mood for a light European action flick with an easy storyline. If it were a book I'd say ""It's an easy read."" Andrew Walker does have great potential and is so nice to look at, and I would love to see him in something with more weight to it. We'll have to wait and see.",1284163200,4,1317,4.491666666666666
