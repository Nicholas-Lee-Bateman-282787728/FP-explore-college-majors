I am a researcher of the supernatural and can tell you I highly doubt this is real it feels like one of those scooby doo moments where some of the locals are trying to make stories to scare people about the town. It's very cheesy and honestly I don't see it being taken serious if it was a gate to hell. I have heard many urban legends where there was a supposed gate to hell and one of them is the devils bath tub in Hocking Hills, Ohio and I live about roughly a half hour away from it and legend has it it's bottomless and very dangerous and park rangers don't want anyone even remotely to get inside of it.

I don't think the part about it being dangerous is an exaggeration because it really is with how scary fast the current is well any way honest criticism the movie I would not say I hate it I just think they had no effort into it. I guess they wanted it to be as believable as possible I see videos on this place where people are stupid enough to harass the town residents like a witch hunt. I feel very sorry for the people of Stull, Kansas and hope the people leave them in peace for anyone listening to my comments please grow a brain and leave them alone.",1514419200,,1376,4.003636363636364
