I have friends in the oil and gas business over to watch it and have loaned it out a bunch of times too.  You ever hear the term ""doodle-bugger""?  If your answer is yes, then you've got to see this movie.  By far the greatest movie ever, very educational for all, sceens from the early oil days are awesome!

The actors, all, the photography, music, scenery, story,  make for a lasting experience.  Human nature is revealed by the writer and portrayed by Duvall, et al, showing the  good and bad and sweet and mean and course and tender, often combined in a single person.
And then, whose name appears on screen?  Clint Eastwood! What a talent he has proven to be, both in his acting ability  and here for his good judgment in bringing this production together.
Thanks, Clint, and Robert, and all for this fine work of art.

738391,5,6303948871,"What an amaizing film. Robert Duvall is superb! Heartwarming story takes place around the period of thr Great Depresion. The oil boomtowns throughout Texas are one of the few hopes. Henrietta, Texas becomes just one of those towns, because of an old  drifter, (Mr. Cox) an ""oil wildcat"", who can smell that oil, deep in the ground. Aiden Quin and Francis Fisher play the parts of a struggling farmer and his wife. (Mr. & Mrs. Don Day) When this old drifter is injured during a twister, he and his cat are rescued by the Don Day. Robert Duvall is at his best. He comes off like a con man but he quickly draws you in! You want to believe him, so much as you find yourself rooting for the underdog!! Brian Dennehy plays the pompous, successful oilman who unwhittingly finances Mr. Cox's dream of striking it rich.  The story has so many fun twists to it. Heartwarming, beautifully filmed, good family entertainment. Some of the best talent in the industry! Produced by Clint Eastwood's company.  Directed by James Keach.",1386806400,,1017,4.670391061452514

738481,5,6303948871,"The Stars Fell on Henrietta is set during the Depression in West Texas. Robert Duvall plays Mr. Cox, a wildcatter, an independent oil driller who has had one continuous streak of bad luck. Something always breaks down at the last minute; some catastrophe happens to keep his dream from coming true. When he is almost as down as he can get, he runs across a farm where he can literally smell oil in the ground. It's owned by a couple barely hanging on to it. They can't spend the money to drill, even if they believed Mr. Cox. Mr. Cox, however, is not to be deterred. He does everything he can to come up with the money to drill, no matter how demeaning. When that doesn't work, he takes extreme measures, because he's just so sure oil is there.

Mr. Cox is a character impossible not to love. No matter how many times he gets knocked down by life, he gets up and tries again. ""I'm a doable man,"" he grins. He's known the rich men; he's known the poor men, and he treats them all with dignity. But the most important thing to him is following that rainbow, hitting another Spindletop. I was especially touched by the scene in the restaurant, when having spent his last dime trying to talk a millionaire oilman into investing, Mr. Cox is cruelly laughed at. Later, when Mr. Cox resorts to extreme measures to get the money, I had to laugh, even though it's, well, kind of wrong; it's still funny and rather satisfying.

The Stars Fell on Henrietta is a delightful movie to experience on so many levels. The tale of a man's pursuit of a vision, a family on the brink of disaster saved by an unlikely character, the fight of the little man to succeed against great odds, they all add up to please us. In addition, this movie offers a beguiling look at the old-time wildcatter who has almost died out or been killed off by government regulations. When Mr. Cox is holding two dipsticks as divining rods, who can help but love him? When he gets blown down by a gas explosion, I started crying because I thought he was dead. It's a heartwarming, uplifting film to watch with anyone of any age.

The only real criticism I have of this film is the music. It seemed bland and not quite in tune with the movie. But Mr. Duvall makes up for it, however, letting us love and admire Mr. Cox, inducing us to cheer him on and wish there were more like him still around. Robert Duvall's entrancing portrayal of Mr. Cox as a goodhearted and charming finagler will have you loving him and this movie, too.",1329955200,8,2484,4.395652173913043

In short I was not at all disappointed, and my patience was rewarded. This is a gentle movie, not without its doses of tension, that draws the viewer in mainly on the strengths of Robert Duvall's portrayal of the irrepressible protagonist. The movie is also good tonic for our times; my favorite scene is where Mr. Cox's (Duvall's character) real ""batting percentage"" is finally revealed to the poor Don Day (played by Aidan Quinn.)",1319587200,2,573,4.74

738510,5,6303948871,"I can finally get rid of the vcr!  This is an absolutely heart-warming,life educating movie for all Robert Duvall fans!  I paid over $50 a few years ago to purchase a ""used"" vhs copy when I accidentally ran across it and remembered seeing it years prior. Thank you ""WB""!  Set in the 1930's, this is a simple film about hard-luck and poverty in a time when the rich got wealthier and the poor lost more and more materialistically.  A time when it was ""every man for himself"".....for most.  Robert Duvall keeps you on the edge of your seat thru out the entire movie.  He is ""an oil-man"" with only the tattered, worn suit on his back, not greedy, lives ""simply"" out of a suitcase and vagabonds with his faithful cat, ""Mathilda"" in search of oil. He will do what ever necessary to get by including doing the jobs only African-Americans were limited to with no shame or judgement on himself or others.  This movie starts ""simple"" and ends just as ""simple"" but hands the viewer a very strong moral and continous hope and strength to never give-up on your dreams no matter your failures and outcomes thruout your lifetime. ""Hitch your wagon to a star"".....

738511,4,6303948871,"Well, I've seen this fairly-unknown film three times now and perhaps that's enough, but I'm sorry that in 2009 it is still not out on DVD. It deserves being seen on disc and discovered. Why this is so ""unkonwn,"" I don't know.

Robert Duvall, who almost never gives a bad performance, is excellent in here, too, as the ever-optimistic ""Mr. Cox."" He's a self-described oil man but in truth has never done anything noteworthy in the business. However, after finding himself in a small Texas town called ""Henrietta,"" (which really exists) he thinks this one residence has a lot of oil on its property. The tough part is trying to convince the literally-poor landowner (Aiden Quinn) that he should invest $5,000 on a well.

All kinds of obstacles ensue - an non-supporting wife (Frances Fisher), an antagonistic and hot-tempered villain who runs things in the area (Brian Dennehy) and just plain bad luck.

Duvall and his pet cat who sticks by him like glue throughout much of the film, keeps this story together.

738515,5,6303948871,"I tracked down an old VHS tape through aLibris after reading these reviews (when is the DVD coming out?), and the effort was worth it.  This is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time, and I have watched it several times already.  This film shows a vintage piece of Americana, and says something about the indomitable human spirit, especially the American frontier spirit, where capitalism meets Wild West mentality.

As others have said, Robert Duvall is terrific in the character role of Mr. Cox, submerging himself in the role.  But for me, the most moving role and acting were those of Aidan Quinn, as the beaten-down scorned dirt farmer, Don Day, who still has the soul of a dreamer. Day and Cox are kindred spirits, but Quinn's character never loses his integrity and gentleness - Quinn is so good at portraying strength and tenderness in the same character. He looks like someone straight out of one of those old WPA Depression photos.  The story of what happens to Cox and the Day family on their failing farm is emotionally satisfying.

The settings are wonderfully specific to the time and place.  My husband, a 5th-generation farmer, related strongly to the story, and loved seeing the old tractors, pickups, and automobiles.

You and your whole family will love this movie, and it would be a great film for history classes studying the Depression.  Highly recommended.",1209254400,2,1395,4.803347280334728

This wonderful flick has all of the above, including a well trained cat as Duvall's heart light, addresses the human refusal to give up ...... and is for the whole family (surprise these days ). This thing is intellectual, it is ordinary entertainment for those preferring that realm, and it is indeed pure Americano thru & thru.
