8339417,1,B001S3STGU,"I ordered a DVD.
I wanted to see the musicians playing. I wanted to see the singers of the Sonora Matancera live.
Instead they are showing some young people dancing their hits in Havana, Cuba.
No Sonora Matancera singers.
No Sonora Matancera musicians playing.
No single live show of them.

Actually it's just a CD. No DVD.",1445299200,,323,4.666666666666667
