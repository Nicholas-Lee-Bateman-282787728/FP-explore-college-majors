I am more at the beginner level right now but am looking forward to trying the more advanced workouts when I'm ready.  I like that the workouts are short. They are perfect for someone like me who doesn't have a lot of time.  The program comes with a pamphlet that has a lot of great tips for healthy eating.  Overall, a very worthwhile purchase!",1392076800,,461,4.506024096385542
