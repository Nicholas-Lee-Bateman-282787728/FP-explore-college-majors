8430148,5,B004I654V2,"Never saw this series when I lived in England but this is a great show.  Not as good as ""The Sweeney"" but right up there.  Taggart is not a lovable character but a good gritty show, good stories, great acting.  No explosions, car chases, gun play which is what I refer to as ""filler"" when you can't think of something to write.  The English know how to put together great dramas and mysteries which the Americans can only hope to achieve.",1462752000,,438,4.37037037037037
8430149,2,B004I654V2,"Why would this be advertised as the complete collection when you can get a PARTIAL collection (1983-2002) at Amazon.co.uk of 42 discs weighing in at over 76 hours?  On top of that, the collection is about a third of the price of this set.  Yes, it's PAL - do yourself a favor, with some of the over $200 you save in purchasing the UK set, spend $50 for a nice multisystem DVD player and start browsing across the pond for some outrageously excellent deals.

Two stars because I love the series, but do not love customers being taken advantage of or not being told the truth up front.  That's just me.",1426982400,2,600,4.378378378378378
8430150,5,B004I654V2,"The legendary Taggart series lives up to its reputation.  Excellent in all respects: acting, direction, location, plot.
  Truly fine entertainment that blends modern police procedural with classic mystery - you'll keep guessing who the killer is right up to the end - and just a dash of horror - mild by 2013 standards, but startling when it first appeared in the 1980's.
  Just as New York City was the fifth main character of ""Sex and the City,"" so Glasgow and its magnificent architecture are key to the success of Taggart.
  Americans should be warned however that part of Taggart's ""keeping it real"" is real Scottish accents, which is undoubtedly why unlike ""Morse"" and ""A Touch of Frost"" ""Taggart"" wasn't shown in the US during its original run..  After an episode or two, the ear is adjusted to recognize ""dune"" as not a sand formation, but the opposite of  ""up.""
  The mood is set by Maggie Bell's magnificent blues theme song ""No Mean City.""
  The price is well worth it for those with a taste for mystery or simply good drama.",1376524800,7,1036,4.688888888888889
8430151,5,B004I654V2,"In case this notice finds any readers in America, I am reviewing only the two DVD's constituting `volume one' of the Taggart series issued by Clear Vision in the UK. They contain one feature-length film apiece, Killer and Dead Ringer respectively. They are absolutely superb, and a sad memorial to Mark McManus, who left us all too early before his 60th birthday. The series named after the lead part that he took in it continued (and may not even have stopped yet) under the same name, and that has to be quite a tribute. Younger fans of the later episodes may have wondered occasionally at the title Taggart, nobody's on-screen name any more, but although there are still first-class stories occasionally I think they will appreciate the difference if they see these two films and why the series still goes under the name that it does.

 Jim Taggart is a tough 70's Glasgow cop carrying more chips than he has shoulders to carry them on. Like any good TV series, the plots and situations in Taggart work to a recognisable but not too repetitious or predictable formula. This keeps the viewer comfortable and ready for more of something-the-same each week, without letting it out whodunit until just before the end. In fact the plots are highly ingenious at times, and you should find that in both the shows I am talking about, particularly Dead Ringer. That keeps up the level of surprise: what contributes the cosy, familiar, evening-in-front-of-the-telly feel to it all is that the number of characters and situations is always approximately the same, and the solution to the crime is always explained at the same stage (shortly before the end). Agatha Christie would have recognised the technique.

The production does not cut corners. The camera work is excellent, the sets are expensive-looking, not least when they are located in Glasgow slums, and the costumes are not reach-me-downs either. In particular Taggart himself is very well turned-out indeed, for all his proletarian attitudes. The acting has been rehearsed thoroughly, and some trouble has been taken over the dialogue, although the hard-bitten Jim is no wisecracker like Philip Marlowe. Characterisation is important in a popular series like this, so Jim, his boss, his sidekick and his daughter and disabled wife are carefully depicted without letting it get corny or turning into any caricature. The same can be said for minor regulars, and even for the one-time participants. It is a great relief above all to report that the Scottish accents are genuine and not the wince-making travesties that one sometimes hears. However these shows are the products of their era, and you would never guess that there was a considerable Asian ethnic population, particularly middle-class Pakistanis, in Glasgow. How much calculation there was of the effect of this aspect of the casting on audience figures I have no idea.

This show had class. It had quality. I remember that a police series called Z Cars back in the early 60's had been hailed as a great advance in popular entertainment, at least to British ideas. I used to love it myself, but these days it seems appallingly amateurish and all-expenses-spared. 15 or 20 years later Taggart marked another such advance, only it still looks good to this day.  One thing it does, and obviously sets out to do, is project the unique atmosphere of Glasgow. These days, since the docks and heavy industry closed, you can see what a fine city Glasgow is, but back in 1970 squalor largely reigned, but the magnetism was all the greater for some reason. You maybe need to come from the city to feel it, but the sense is strong still and was stronger then.  I kept watching Taggart largely for this very reason long after it was Taggart without the Prince of Maryhill. He died in 1994, and I see that his death was from pneumonia, or as they would have said in Maryhill `peumony'. Jim worried about his city and its loss of a sense of community, in which the police were trusted. How all that has developed I don't know, nor indeed whether the idea had any real validity in the first place. However the early editions of Taggart are a great depiction of a place and a time; and more than that they are great entertainment and ought to go on being that for a long while yet.",1358121600,19,4280,4.7926829268292686
8430152,5,B004I654V2,"Absolutely fantastic series, with Mark MCManus being why.  It is so sad that he died bac in l994.  The series continued but it wasn't quite the same without him",1310688000,9,160,4.482758620689655
