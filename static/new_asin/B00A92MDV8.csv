8548618,2,B00A92MDV8,"First let me say I like Anthony Quayle: That being said, I got ""Storm of the  Nile"" and watched that first. To my surprise, ""East of Sudan"" was 60% footage from SotN, add in another 20% African stock footage and in some scenes the actors were just 'Blue screened' in front of old stock footage, it left little original footage.
Being an old 'Nile'/foreign legion fan this movie got only two stars from me. The second star was only because there is about 20-30 minutes Quayle and a cute (but short) story.
This was obviously a low budget movie and sadly it shows.
That being said, what original footage there was, was fairly well acted. Trust me when I say there are  better movies out there in this genre.",1369180800,8,705,4.457364341085271
