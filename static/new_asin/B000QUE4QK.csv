I started drinking and eating raw milk & products in the early '70's.  they were Alta-Dena diary products at that time.  this video is pretty well done,interviews of knowledgeable professional farmers on their farm and others.  i must say, however, that the video itself could have been better done.  the video almost seemed amateur done, but i'm thankful for the info presented. I'm still impressed by the apparent accuracy of the information given by the dairyman and the dairy processes @ Organic Pastures Diary.  I will again try to find these or other raw milk products here in Colorado.",1354665600,,672,4.850877192982456

8197634,5,B000QUE4QK,"It is all about greed! They brainwash us to drink this stuff and we do it then we get sick slowly but surely. We end up going to thier hospitals not knowing what is causing our illness because milk works slowly on getting us sick. Now they know this will happen and they have the time to wait for you to get sick. People that have money in the food and medical stock market are making tons of money off of our ignorance and the ""they would not do this to me aditudes."" If we don't take off our blinders we haven't a chance in staying well.",1292889600,5,539,4.046728971962617
8197635,5,B000QUE4QK,"I grew up in Europe and as a child I was spending summers at my great-grandmother's home in the village. There I drank a lot of raw milk - as raw and as fresh as it gets, straight from the cow, still warm and foamy. This milk was full of an incredible aroma and heavenly taste. The cows in my great-grandmother's village were roaming free all day long, eating fresh green grass and returning home to be milked before they would go to rest for the night in the barn... Then, they would be milked early in the morning and go out into the sun and on the green juicy pastures again. They were happy, clean and healthy. This is how it has been done by our mothers, grandmothers, great-grandmothers and so on, from the beginning of time. Until now - until the rise of big agribusiness. Along with the big agribusiness came an extensive and expensive campaign to ""educate"" the consumers that what humans have done forever and ever is not ""safe"". The cows were hoarded from the green sunny open fields and into the dark confined cramp feedlots or small fields without a single blade of grass. Today they stand in their own manure and breathe methane and ammonia all day long. They are forced to eat corn and soy (mostly Monsanto's GMO), which their digestive system was not designed to digest. They get sick from these conditions. They get treated with antibiotic, steroids and hormones. They get more sick. Their milk is sick and ridden with pathogenic bacteria and not safe to drink! That is why their milk has to be pasteurized (which is simply cooking), killing most of the pathogenic bacteria along with everything good in it. That is your pasteurized milk! It is from the depressed, sick animals, and the milk itself is dead. All the benefits of milk is lost and the taste is no longer there.

I don't know about your state, but it is (still) legal to sell and buy raw milk in California, and I buy it happily. I give raw milk and raw milk products to my baby and make all kinds of delicious milk products, like home-made raw farmer's cheese, kefir (super food), raw butter, curdled milk and other cheeses, just like my mother, my grandmother, my great-grandmother and all who came before me did. My whole family is healthy and happy because we consume real milk, from happy, clean and healthy cows, who graze on the fresh green grass, in the sun and fresh air, and produce delicious milk.

Watch this DVD to learn in depth about the benefits of switching to raw milk. Your life will never be the same. If you have children, you MUST know this information, for their health, wellbeing and optimum development. This is something our ancestors knew, and now something the big agribusiness does not want you to know (since it is not good for their profit). Educate yourself back to what is good for you and stop supporting dishonest agribusiness with your dollars.

Good luck!

8197636,5,B000QUE4QK,"I love this video.  with more and more of the population getting sensitivities to milk it is easy to see why now.  When you see the way the big daries work and how the cows are treated and what is done to the milk vs the way an organic farm works, you won't want to have ""government approved"" milk again.  This is such a great DVD and I strongly encourage everyone to watch this one.",1266710400,5,383,4.08
8197637,5,B000QUE4QK,"Extremely informative and interesting information.
Easy to watch and listen to. It breaks the myths about milk allergies, explains pasturization and homogenization and could heal/solve many health  conditions!  Buy one for you  and one  to loan out!  (No. I'm not a friend of the company, just a happy customer of Organic Pastures raw milk products!",1223769600,10,349,5.2727272727272725
8197638,5,B000QUE4QK,"The truth is made known!  It tells you how milk is suppose to be an all the great benefits raw milk has.  Also, it is all about going back to how a cow should be eating the way nature intended them to eat.",1201132800,12,205,3.744186046511628
