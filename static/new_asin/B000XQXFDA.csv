8229238,5,B000XQXFDA,"I finally got to view this double disc release as part of the second Mario Bava box as I was putting it off because I had the Image Entertainment release of 'FIVE DOLLS FOR AN AUGUST MOON' aka 'CINQUE BAMBOLE PER LA LUNA D'AGOSTO-1970 and now Anchor Bay has blown that one away with a pristine 1.85 transfer.  'FIVE DOLLS' is in my top three of Bava's works.  It is a masterpiece blending humor, terror and suspense in a concerto of isolated psychological repressions.  Many tend to compare it to Agatha Christie's 'TEN LITTLE INDIANS' but it stops after our main characters gather at a remote island beach house invited by a mega bucked industrialist to bargain and seduce a prominent professor who has a formula which each of them can profit by and before you know it, each gets picked off one by one till the bodies are over flowing in the villas meat locker and the tension builds to a brilliant surprise ending. It has the beautiful Edwige Fenech and Ira Von Furstenberg gracing the proceedings and a brooding William Berger as the professor.  With gorgeous cinematography by Antonio Rinaldi and a catchy, sixties pop score by Piero Umiliano, it is a fantastic introduction to non-horror Bava.  Also on the disc is his rarity ,'FOUR TIMES THAT NIGHT' aka UNA NOTTE FATTA DI BUGIE'-1968, a fascinating retread of Director Akira Kurosawa's 'RASHOMAN' where you get four different variations of the rape of Daniela Giordano which occurs at the apartment of Brett Halsey.  Each elaborates and changes more and more of the events which occurred and ends with the narrator of the proceedings allowing the viewers to decide for themselves.  The photography, once again, is by Alberto Rinaldi and the film plays up and makes fun of the spicy sex comedies which profilgated throughout the late sixties.  Director Dario Argento would pursue the same territory with his film 'LE CINQUE GIORNATE' in the early seventies.  Highly recommended for Bava fans, this disc shows the master using diverse styles and techniques to tell his stories and 'FIVE DOLLS' alone is worth the price of this release.",1306195200,2,2090,4.848314606741573
8229239,3,B000XQXFDA,"If Matt Helm or Derek Flint made a giallo, it might turn out something like Five Dolls for an August Moon, one of Mario Bava's least-regarded films by his aficionados but for me far more enjoyable than some of his classics. A Ten Little Indians number planting three rich industrialists, an inventor who won't sell his new formula and assorted wild women (lesbians, nutters and schemers among them) on an island where someone's killing their way through the cast list and everyone's a suspect, Bava seems to be playing this one with his tongue firmly in his cheek. ""Looks like we're all going to end up subzero,"" quips one character after another victim ends up hanging in the meat locker, pretty much setting the tone: it's silly, but it knows it's silly and just runs with it. The swinging island pad probably makes more of an impression than any of the cast and none of it makes much sense, but even though there's not much in the way of grand guignol or surprises it's an engagingly undemanding hour-and-a-half. And remember - animals NEVER talk when you shoot them with sodium pentathol...

No extras at all on Anchor Bay's DVD.",1287532800,,1133,4.693467336683417
8229240,4,B000XQXFDA,"First off, these are Bava films, so you either love his 60`s work or hate it, period. The same things that we fans of his 60`s output love are usually the very same things that turn others off. So I'm not going to spend a lot of time reviewing the actual movies themselves, but rather what's on display in them - the luscious Euro babes with big, teased hair and false eyelashes, the accompanying mini-skirts, go-go boots and chain belts, the futuristic furniture, accessories and decor(the same stuff that's popular today), the elaborate architecture and European landscapes, the cool cars, the extravagant, permissive lifestyles and hedonistic parties and, of course, Edwige Fenech and Daniela Giordano.
I realize that these things have nothing to do with whether these are good movies or not, but I also know I'm not alone in my rabid fascination for all things from this particular time period, and that WILL have an impact on whether you enjoy these films. So if the plot steers off course here and there while enjoying the visual feast on display as described above, who cares?
""FIVE DOLLS"" is a murder mystery with an almost Psychedelic feel with eye-popping colors and kitschy characters, and an over-the-top performance by a young, doe-eyed Edwige Fenech. It was never theatrically released in America, so that's another perk ,IMHO.
""FOUR TIMES"" is an ultra-mod, erotic retelling of Akira Kurosawa`s ""Rashomon"", believe it or not, starring former Miss Italy, Daniela Giordano and American leading man Brett Halsey, and whose plot may or may not include rape, lesbianism, nymphomania, inflatable furniture and tons of black humor poked at the Catholic church.
Put these elements in your pipe and smoke them and decide for yourself if it's your cup of tea or not. Personally, I found them groovyliscious. Amen.",1250985600,4,1817,5.039867109634551
