6035759,5,B00FXCIWZA,"I was very impressed with this DVD. The 2 30 minute workouts give you a full body workout. I especially liked the 10 minute step workout and the bonus band workout. For the price, it was a great investment. I even ordered one for my sister.",1395964800,4,240,4.239130434782608
6035760,4,B00FXCIWZA,The workouts are a little low budget filmed but the moves are interesting and fun. There actually 2 different bonus workouts! You definitely need a Bosu ball for one and resistance bands for the other bonus workout though.,1392163200,14,222,4.868421052631579
6035761,4,B00FXCIWZA,"This DVD is the 2 Tamilee ""Tight on Time"" DVDs together on one DVD. The tracking is a little different from the originals - the material is formatted into 2 30-minute workouts with warm-up and cool-down, plus 2 bonus workouts.

The packaging is a little confusing. Tamilee Webb is a popular workout star. I don't know why she is confined to a postage-stamp-sized picture on the case. But this is Tamilee's video and the price is great.",1390521600,20,435,4.64935064935065
6035762,5,B00FXCIWZA,"I really liked this set of 10 minutes workouts plus it has extras so you get like 8 ten minutes workouts plus warm up and cool down. The workouts are challenging but is more like the kind of workout that will make you feel good, I would say  begginers to intermediate.  I have a lot of workouts dvds from insanity, dream body workouts to beginners workouts and I like to have variety because some times I do not feel like torturing my self and that is when I get out this kind of workouts where I still get my exercise and I feel good without feeling overly exhausted.",1389830400,33,568,4.25

6035787,1,B00FXCIWZA,The DVD arrived cracked in half.  I got it so cheap that it wouldn't have been worthwhile to go thru the return process.  Definitely disappointed.,1417478400,,146,4.8
6035788,1,B00FXCIWZA,"Misleading title - I interpreted 10 Minute on the Go as a routine that can be done while travelling - I would need to pack weights, steps, balance ball, and etc.

Should be marketed as 10 minute variety",1409875200,6,202,4.315789473684211
6035789,1,B00FXCIWZA,Same reaction as the above.,1404864000,2,27,4.6
6035790,3,B00FXCIWZA,"I tried the Cardio, Core & Buns series. Personally, I didn't like it. I am not super coordinated when it comes to doing multiple moves at one time and found this series awfully hard to keep up with. I actually turned the DVD off 17 minutes in - and moved to a different DVD I liked better. I doubt I will do this DVD again. I understand she is trying to save as much time as possible - so multiple movements work for burning the most calories in a small amount of time. I just didn't find it enjoyable & felt like an idiot trying to keep in step.",1402963200,3,546,4.018348623853211
6035791,5,B00FXCIWZA,"The creator of buns of steel, ads of steel, etc. is THE REAL DEAL.
This is an amazin set at an amazing price!!
BETTER THAN MY GYM WORKOUTS....Believe the hype,
and buy this now!",1400457600,3,177,4.235294117647059
6035792,4,B00FXCIWZA,"""Spot on"" to target trouble areas. Love the way I can mix and match the workouts.  Abs, arms and cardio one day....and thighs, buns and cardio the next.",1398902400,,152,4.428571428571429
6035793,5,B00FXCIWZA,"This is one great workout!!  DVD features Tamilee Webb, she does all the exercises alone.  Why the picture of the other girl on the cover?  I have no idea.  If you love Tamilee like I do, you should add this to your DVD collection.  Beginners beware - because it has 10 minute sessions, she does not spend a lot of time teaching proper form and breathing like on most of her other  DVDs.",1397779200,7,387,4.232876712328767
6035794,5,B00FXCIWZA,"TamiLee is one of my long time favorite trainers. The 6 ten minute workouts provide a varied quick set of workouts when I'm on vacation. I , also use these workouts when pressed for time during the week.",1397433600,,203,4.368421052631579
6035795,5,B00FXCIWZA,This video has a lot to choose from with both weight lifting and cardio in ten minute clips. You can easily combine two for a concise 20 minute workout plus add a three minute warm up. Tami Lee Webb is great because she is strong and fit but she's not a young and perfect looking fitness instructor so you feel like you can relate to her and be inspired. I would also recommend checking out her stretch video.,1396656000,8,409,4.256410256410256
8619158,5,B00FXCIWZA,"One of the best ever - Tamilee Webb rocks! She has won tons of awards as best trainer so this is a bonus. Because of the cover, I didn't know she did the workouts - what a treat. Anyway 6 - 10 minute work outs, just like the title says. Just start the dvd and the 10 minutes will go by instantly and you'll be in better shape. I played 3 in a row they were so good. There is a warm-up and cool down too (about a minute ish each) and a couple bonus work-outs. Highly recommend!",1484265600,,476,3.86734693877551

8619161,5,B00FXCIWZA,"This DVD is actually all Tamilee Webb workouts--don't know why the cover picture does not have her.

The 10 minute sessions are so quick that I end up doing the entire video sometimes.  That's the Tamilee effect--she makes exercise fun.",1453334400,,236,4.875
8619162,5,B00FXCIWZA,"Good challenging workouts, presented in a polite and natural manner",1442707200,,67,5.8
8619163,4,B00FXCIWZA,Thanks for great service. These are powerful 10 minute workouts that really helps with keeping the body from being stiff when done on a regular basis. One 10 min. workout gives the result od a 30 minute workout for me. This is my experience with this DVD. I recommend it for a quick workout that gives results.,1437696000,,310,4.456140350877193
