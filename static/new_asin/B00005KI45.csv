8278810,5,B00005KI45,"As an 8-year experienced ballroom dancer, I've seen many instructional videos and met many instructors. This one is among the best, not just because I like it. It offers:  * More steps than the average instructional videos. * Well broken down and well explained. * After the instructional part you can see the instructors and also other dancers jamming for several minutes (not just a few seconds like in other videos). * The explanations are treated with sense of humour. * They use really good music in it (good versions of classic and new artists). And, if you (like me) are not native English-speaking, you get an extra-advantage!: their English is easier to follow than most native (English or American) instructors.",997920000,3,721,4.958677685950414
8278811,5,B00005KI45,Excellent video for smooth style Lindy!  35+ moves all well broken down and demonstrated with panache.  Especially helpful for fast dancing.  Has plenty of syncopations and styling for both leads and follows.  All moves socially leadable; very little choreography.  This is THE BEST advanced Lindy video.,997833600,5,304,5.521739130434782
8278812,5,B00005KI45,"I've had the priveledge of having this tape and I fully recommend it! This on The ""Advanced Hollywood Style"" is made for those who already know the basics and are already fairly good and want to learn new fancy moves. Marcus and Brbl also have other swing videos for all types from Beginner to Advanced and they are all exceptional. Get their videos...it's well worth the money!",997833600,,378,4.656716417910448
8278813,5,B00005KI45,"When you have practice in Hollywood Style this video give you new variations in your dance and should be in your collection. The Instructors Marcus & Brbl were thorough and easy to follow. The dance steps are broken down for both, the guy and girl. We know Marcus & Brbl for a long time and we promise they have a lot of experience in teaching and competing.",997833600,,358,4.358208955223881
