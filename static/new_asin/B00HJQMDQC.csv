6166955,5,B00HJQMDQC,"This is a great DVD for any SpongeBob fan as it contains over three hours of SpongeBob and friends.  The episodes all revolve around the Krusty Krab (which yes they all usually do) but its funny to see SpongeBob try out other jobs.  Yes these are all episodes from television that I have seen but its still fun to re-watch them and its great having them all on one DVD.  Perfect to take SpongeBob wherever you want and at less than $10, its a great deal!",1400025600,2,454,4.255813953488372
6166956,3,B00HJQMDQC,"There are several people who regard this as, while not one of the worst episodes, a pretty bad one. There may be some who would enjoy this for the handful of episodes, but to me, it's always better in the long run to buy the season/complete series DVDs instead.

Also, to be totally honest, Nickelodeon has a very good thing going with the Shout Factory Nicktoon sets, give those a try! The more support those complete series DVDs get, the more shows that will get more love. Seriously, go look them up. I highly recommend the Rocko's Modern Life Complete Series one.",1399593600,4,567,4.5588235294117645
