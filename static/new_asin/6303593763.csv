7851862,3,6303593763,"(...) Bernie Hamilton played a defiant black man in Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's little seen film, LA JOVEN (released in the U.S. as THE YOUNG ONE with English dialog). The story involves Travers (Hamilton), a jazz musician that narrowly escapes a lynch mob. He finds refuge on an isolated island, where he encounters an unabashed racist named Miller (Zachary Scott).
This picture distinguishes itself from typical ""race problem"" movies in that Travers is not the familiar ""ebony saint"" character played by the likes of Sidney Poitier. Here Travers does not take any mess from Miller -- and lives to tell about it.
Miller on the other hand is one of the most vile and despicable characters ever to grace the silver screen. Not only is Miller a bigot, but a pedophile too. When Miller is not spewing racial slurs at Travers, he's trying to bed Evalyn (Key Meersman), the recently orphaned girl next door.
LA JOVEN may not be one of Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's finest films, but it is certainly one of his most disturbing and provocative. Bu&ntilde;uel aficionados and those interested in the portrayal of African American men in early 1960s films, will find much fuel for discussion long after LA JOVEN has been shown.",1006128000,,1202,4.926108374384237
