7681175,3,B01CE00Q5C,"I saw X-Men3 last night. I enjoyed the acting and directing. But the movie it self turn into a trainwreak to soon. I hoped ""Superman Return"" is the best superhero film of the summer.",1148601600,2,182,4.382352941176471
7681176,3,B01CE00Q5C,"Brett Ratner (Rush Hour 1-3) keeps true to the look of the other films and he can handle action and big special effects. Still, he's a lot more careless than Bryan Singer. He goes for a no one is safe approach and kills off some main characters. He also wanted to introduce new mutants, which is why he killed off some people and why Night Crawler is no where to be seen. Kelsey Grammer is at least a good addition to the cast as Beast and same with Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde. Vinnie Jones isn't a bad Juddernaught as well. He's the best new villain, but all the other villains that Ratner introduced though are undeveloped and just wear leather and look like porn stars lol. So half of them I didn't even know if they were from the comics or not since we don't even get their names.

  While there's no going back with how bad it is with what they did with Cyclops. James Marsden was punished for choosing to be in Superman Returns but they all punished fans as well. While Famke Janssen who was excellent in X-2 is just wasted here with a blank stare and barely any lines as Dark Phoenix. Halle Berry who always demanded that Storm had more to do since...she's an Oscar winner got her wish though. Cyclops gets pushed back as leader just so we get more of her. Meanwhile someone needs to crush her ego by reminding her that she was in CatWoman. She was never even right for the part of Storm. It's Jenssen who actually deserved more to do as Jean Grey.

  As a last film the movie doesn't work as well since it hints to things to come in the credits. Which is why it bugs me when some fans say, hey there's still origin movies coming out. I just want to know what happens next. We already have a good idea to what happened with Wolverine before the X-men movies. Same with Magneto who also has an origin movie coming out. I'm not sure how they could clean up the mess that Ratner made with this film with a part 4 but I'd still like to Singer come back and try. He at least loves and respects the characters enough not to kill them off.",1148601600,,2038,4.212820512820513
7681177,3,B01CE00Q5C,"I really expected this movie to blow me away. Unfortunately, It didn't. Yes, there are great special affects and storm(my favorite) finally gets a chance to fly, but she doesn't do much of anything else. I really expected storm to shine in this movie, but once again she left something to be desired. I guess I am expecting the characters to be more like the animated version of the x-men that aired on fox in the 90's. Another major flaw is having two main characters killed off. I mean come on folks, cyclops and the professor are key characters. And once again it's wolverine that saves the day. I don't have a beef against wolverine but having him take out a powerful mutant like the phoenix is just stretching it a little. I can see maybe the professor or magneto or maybe even storm, but wolverine. He gets way to much credit as far as I'm concerned. Magneto really shows his stuff in this one and so does Pyro,everyone else just sort of tags along for the ride. That is except for wolverine who always has to be the hero. Sorry, folks but if there's going to be an x-men 4 they had better bring it. I hope they include the most powerful and evil super villian ever (Apocalypse)!!",1147305600,,1186,4.420091324200913

7681198,5,B01CE00Q5C,"in  this movie, its about the name of the movie ""THE LAST STAND""
 the regular people has decided they have made a cure  for the mutants
like anything else, some  likes it and some do not
so there is a protest and some of the xmen has decided either we stick together
and fight this and if you  have been watching this serious, one of the FEMALE XMEN
was killed early on  and in this serious, she comes alive some how
but you will see what happens now that she is back, sort of is it her or  part of her or what?
now, to the biggest  thing here, the XMEN lose there friend and leader , the professor
so who takes over to run the school for the mutants, it may surprise you!
but what happens to eric is a big thing as well, but the end of the show will answer a lot
of questions  and you will see new things, but as always,  it ends with a really big question
that may or may not change the future of the XMEN- there is a few new faces  in the mutants in this one to

7681203,3,B01CE00Q5C,"Not as awful as people make it out to be, but it is a major letdown from the first two X-Men films. The major problem it that the film focuses on the invention of a mutant cure instead of on the Dark Phoenix/Jean Grey. The Phoenix was teased at the end of X2 but she's just a subplot in this film. The cure story line has potential as mutants have to choose to either ""cure"" themselves to fit into society or reject it and be proud their mutant uniqueness. But it belongs in a different movie. We don't know what is going on in Jean's head--how does she feel about killing her boyfriend Scott/Cyclops and her mentor Prof. X? We don't know anything of her inner struggle with the immense power of the Phoenix force. Also sad is how poorly developed Angel/Warren Worthington is. His appearance is little more than a cameo and his strained relationship with his father is never fleshed out. The rivalry between Iceman and Pyro, which has been building throughout the whole trilogy, goes out in a fizzle. Their final battle is too brief and Pyro's fate is left up in the air. People like to put all the blame on Brett Ratner, but the blame also lies with Bryan Singer for abandoning the trilogy he started and for taking James Marsden and his creative team with him to film Superman Returns. Also, Fox is to blame for rushing ahead with the movie without Singer. And Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn are to blame for writing such a mediocre screenplay. So the blame goes around. At least Days of Future Past erased this movie from continuity.",1498089600,,1532,4.475

7681223,2,B01CE00Q5C,"Plot holes abound in this mostly failed romp. I mean, it's one thing to have a movie about good and evil, but this one wasn't even that. So, why was the ending so stupid? Let me expound.

First, you have the vaccine that turns mutants back into humans. Keep that in the back of your mind while I proceed. Second, you have the kid from which the 'cure' was derived. A kid that for any mutant near enough, their powers stop working. Is the light beginning to dawn yet?

So, at the end Jean Grey once again goes into uncontrollable mode, for a rather asinine reason I might add. Yet, Wolverine says stupidly enough, ""I'm the only one who can do this"". Not exactly, they could have marched the kid right up next to Jean and she would have had to stop doing her uncontrollable thing. So, this is why Wolverine's argument is stupid. His was not the only way to stop Jean. The kid could have stopped Jean from doing that exact thing she was doing. Secondarily, coming back to the cure, Wolverine could have plopped one of those babies right into Jean with or without the kid present. So, instead of killing her, she'd be a powerless human again. Is that so bad really? He wanted her alive, not dead. She really didn't like her own destructive powers anyway. So, the whole idea of killing her was really contrary to what he really wanted and it would have given Jean a way out without dying. I know, I know, it kind of ruins that whole ending setup. But, in reality, the whole ending was ruined by not really following through with the plot they had been so carefully crafting through the whole movie.

Based on this, it's really only worth 2 stars.",1488153600,,1641,4.391447368421052

7681230,4,B01CE00Q5C,"Good-very movie not great! It had 2 problems: 1. It had too many characters for 1 film, so even some of the main characters(class 4 mutants most of them) had no real role. 2. The Juggernaut should have been a main movie villain; we're talking about a character that Superman or Martian Manhunter probably could not beat one-on-one! Juggy innately is magical and has a healing factor that rivals Hulk if not better in lieu of being immovable by most in the comic realm.  I even heard that he has a super forcefield, too! If MM tried to phase through him, then something bad might happen to him or he may have no effect. And SM is about as defeatable by magic as he is with kryponite! Then, Wonder Woman, Flash, Batman, GL, and the other JLA originals would be as ineffective as a human punching a piece of iron! That's a major villain for a team of humans--for whom, cracking his armor might not be possible!  Maybe if Magneto showed up to save his old friend, then freed him of his helmet so that Xavier could do his thing. That movie, probably could of have been done prior to this one.

What they got right: Storm's fighting ability was racheted up a bit and was something else. Her battles with Callisto were something else. The battle at the house and the battle at the end is wonderful. Even Beast's role was right on, because he is peaceful and brainy first fight second kind of hero. Phoenix powers were close to right on, she had a great movie adaption, and is really indifferent like she was in the movie(unless she wants to act or is messed with: from what I can remember); Magneto and Callisto even make mention of her range of ability in the X men world. Shadowcat's role and power was a great one in what little action role she had. The pale kid's powers were also a great factor in the movie. Again, good-very good not great!",1481500800,,1839,4.402941176470589

7681258,2,B01CE00Q5C,"Dark Phoenix is perhaps one of the most bizarre stories in comics and that IS saying something.  The Dark Phoenix is this pile of rubbish is just lazy and uninspired.

The movie has two stories: the cure for mutations and their version of the Dark Phoenix.  I haven't read the comic version of Dark Phoenix but I've seen the 90s X-Men cartoon version of it.  Neither story is very good.  The highlight is when Magneto moves the Golden Gate Bridge... that was kinda awesome.

Mystique gets the shaft as she is cured and she's all ""hell hath no fury"" on Magneto.......yeah, screw you Magneto you racist prick......he acts more like a Nazi which SHOULD be an insult to his character since he's Jewish and he lived through the holocaust.

Why did they have to kill off two of the most integral team members and their death was at the hands of a third member of the x-men turned pheonix?  I mean couldn't she have destroyed something else hugely important like the school for mutants/slash x-men headquarters with the most important team members barely escaping with their lives?  And instead of having the murderous pheonix killed by yet another team member why not go a diff direction? I would have enjoyed it more if the pheonix had been shot with the mutant-cure while distracted by wolverine in the end scene, returning her to her jean grey form.  Much like magneto she could have discovered that she still retained much of her mutant powers farther down the road.

This film itself is really good, with the cast once again performing fantastically strong, through and through. With introductions to characters such as Vinnie Jones as The Juggernaut and Kelsey Grammar as Hank Mcoy really being the icing on the cake, bringing both humour and fanboy joy to the film. Hugh Jackman continues his dominating performance as Wolverine and continues to develop the character who is now more at peace after the events of X-Men 2.
The plot itself holds up, as the mutants face their biggest threat to date, a medical breakthrough humanity calls a cure is posed to wipe them out and finally pushing Magneto into all out war with humanity.

When a cure is developed to rid mutants of their unusual abilities, the mutant community is torn in two, with some more than happy to get rid of what they view as a curse, while others are vehemently against it. Outraged at this development, Magneto makes war on the humans for trying to rid the world of mutantkind and the X-Men stand in the gap to stop him.

This movie has a lot going on and seems to serve as an ending to the previous two movies, bringing to fruition a major confrontation between the X-Men and the Brotherhood. These two teams, while having skirmished in the other movies, never had an all-out battle and this flick shows that. It also brings to pass a version of the Dark Phoenix storyline with Jean Grey returning from the dead as the Phoenix and working for the bad guys.

From an action standpoint, this movie has tons of it and its really cool. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) kicks butt as usual, while having the Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) running around and smashing into things makes you cheer. Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) ups the metal-controlling ante in thisI mean, lifting a bridge? Flipping semis? Awesome! and even having Beast (Kelsey Grammer) beasting it up adds a level of excitement that makes this comic-book-come-to-life a thrill. And when Jean Grey lets loose and destroys her childhood home while a bunch of X-Men and Brotherhood folks are fighting inside it? That was some jaw-dropping stuff!

From a story standpoint, it kind of falters. In a general sensethe overall story, I meanits fine as is. That is, the what its about. The delivery, however, seems to suffer from the same thing Spider-Man 3 did: too much going on and not enough time to tell it in. Had this third X-Men movie either been part one of two or even the first in a trilogy where the mutant cure is introduced, a war brews, theres a big battle, some people die, etc. then that wouldve been fine. But it didn't happen that way. I don't know if thats because of a change in hands of directors or what.

The other thing that I didn't likebut couldve worked had the story justified it/been expanded into another movie or twowas everyone dying. We lost some major people in this movie and for seemingly no good reason. I have no trouble with killing off major characters. It can definitely add to the story . . . when done right. In this flick, there didn't seem any justification for it.

Whats amazing is thanks to the upcoming X-Men: Days of Future Past in 2014, depending on how that plays out, theres a chance of undoing some of the stuff that fell short in this outing and bringing back some people from the dead. After all, isn't that what time travels for?

In the meantime, yeah, if you want a fun superhero movie, Id still recommend X-Men: The Last Stand.",1436313600,,2780,4.548

7681425,3,B01CE00Q5C,"So, with the first two movies behind me, it's time to finish the trilogy with X-Men: The Last Stand.  Since I hadn't really followed the movies, I didn't know what to expect going in.  All conceptions out of my mind, I found the action great but on the whole emotionally empty.

In the time since we last checked in on our heroes, a new President has been elected, one who is sympathetic enough with the mutants to create a new cabinet position designed to deal with the mutant problem.  It's even headed by a mutant, Beast (Kelsey Grammer).

Back at the mansion, Cyclopes (James Marsden) is still mourning the loss of his girlfriend.  He heads to the place where she died only to make a startling discovery.

And speaking of startling discovers, someone has found a cure for the mutant gene.  Mutants can now voluntarily get a shot that will make them normal once and for all.  Magento (Ian McKellen) uses this to form a brotherhood of mutants to stand up and fight for their freedom once and for all.  Will Professor X (Patrick Stewart), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and Storm (HalleBerry) be able to stop him yet again?

Plot wise, there is a lot going on.  In fact, I think that's the biggest problem with the film.  Either of the two plots would have been enough on their own, but instead they fight for dominance and neither is very well developed.  This is especially true of the story that is supposed to be the emotional heart of the movie.  It just isn't.

Of course, part of that is because even though this is the third movie in the series, the number of characters has kept most of them from being super well developed.  If you just don't care about the characters, you don't feel the emotions they do.  This movie is darker than the previous two, but those events are just there as a result.  And keep in mind that I've watched all these movies in the last few weeks, so the previous two are fresh in my mind.

Adding to the problem is the introduction of lots of new characters.  As someone new to the franchise, I don't know who many of them are.  I have a feeling it was a nod to fans who wanted to see them, but most weren't around enough for me to care about one way or the other.

And there's one sub-plot that shouldn't have even been introduced since they don't take the time to truly explore it.  Instead, you get a ""huh?"" moment at the end of the film.

I thought the acting in the film was fine.  The script really didn't call for much from the actors.  They did their best to breath life into their characters, but there just wasn't much for them to work with.

So what are we left with?  Action and effects.  Don't worry, both are supported by the story and not the other way around.  And there are some amazing effects here.  I was actually amazed at what they were able to make me believe.  Likewise, the action is great and makes it easy to forget the weaknesses of the film.

I know I spent a lot of time tearing the film down, and that's because it is easy to pick at the weaknesses.  It's not a bad film, but it is the weakest of the trilogy.

If you've enjoyed the first two, you owe it to yourself to watch X-Men: The Last Stand.  If you haven't enjoyed the others, there's nothing here that will change your mind about the franchise.",1433289600,,3266,4.338842975206612

7681471,5,B01CE00Q5C,"I hear everything everything everyone says about this film and it's true. Brett Ratner was a poor choice as a replacement for Brian Singer for director. He's like Singer's opposite. Where Singer was always subtle and clever with the first two films, Brett Ratner is always loud and in your face. Not to mention he brings very little of the heart, emotion or character development of the first two films. This film is dumb, where the first two films were very smart.
But honestly, I would be lying if I said I don't enjoy this film. Ratner is great with action scenes, which is fortunate for him because that's like half the film. The scene when Logan and Storm fight Magneto's new henchmen at Jean's house was a memorable fight scene, one that was well directed, and I have to be honest, the entire final battle/""The last stand"" was very enjoyable.
Every other scene between characters feels very empty, and literally every new character feels underdeveloped.(The returning character's also feel less developed then usual. Is that even a thing?)
One last thing that really bother's me about the film: ""Levels"". What the hell are ""levels""?! In this film, all mutants are classified by what level they are at. I don't know what that means, in this context at least. This is a concept never mentioned in the first two films and never explained in this film. Maybe people who read the comics know what their talking about, I don't. Charles and Erik casually refer to Jean as level 5. Super speed girl refers to Erik and Pyro as level 3. It just pisses me off!
Hugh Jackman really shines as Wolverine. He always kills it as Logan! Always! But I guess you sort of appreciate it more here because his acting is usually the best part of this movie.
You have to give credit where credit is due, because one thing that Brett Ratner nails is the Phoenix Rage scenes, first when she loses it at her house and again following the final battle. Both of those scenes are outstanding and incredibly epic!
Anyway, all criticism aside, this is a good movie, just not a good X-Men movie.",1423699200,,2068,4.622282608695652

7681505,3,B01CE00Q5C,"I just finished watching this again as it was screened on free-to-air television in Australia . I couldn't remember why I didn't like it the first time I saw it at the movies and now I know why. Overall as an action film it was fantastic , I can't fault it there, but killing off major characters and stripping others of their powers was a very very disappointing move.
If you are a fan of the original cartoon series you'll know what I'm talking about. The story lines and back stories of these characters are complex , tortured and involved . Rogue for example . Rogue becomes a major player as the series progresses and is right up there with Storm as far as being powerful goes. She has a major confrontation with a character known as Miss Marvel who has superman strength and can fly. As a result she drains all her energy and powers leaving her in hospital in a coma . Rogue is now super strong and can fly but is racked with guilt and visits Miss Marvel on a regular basis .
Some of the reviewers here have suggested that it was a bold move to do something different and risque with what at the time may have been the conclusion of the trilogy. Some have suggested that the ""cure"" is not permanent as Magneto moved  the chess piece slightly at the end. I hope this is the case . Killing off Scott and Jean who were major players as well, was not a good idea. Jean has a massive story line in the television series and was the most powerful . Why would you kill her off ?
There's some hope for Scott I guess as there was no body found but we may never know.
The two movies that have been released in the meantime taking place in the past were disappointing in my opinion. Use the story lines from the cartoon series there's a wealth of information there. Marvel have done it successfully with the comic book stories.

This film sticks out like a stinking weed in a beautiful garden.  What makes matters worse is that they took the fantastic Phoenix story arc and warped it to pieces.

I was so happy that 1st Class restarted the series and now Days of Future Past undid most of the damage this film did to the storyline.  The best thing to do this film is bury it with the likes of Mac & Me and Kangaroo Jack.",1411257600,,564,4.283018867924528
7681550,4,B01CE00Q5C,"The final installment was good, but possible overwhelmed the viewer with too many mutants.  Many were seen so briefly you couldn't get a grasp on who they were and what they did.  Also fans of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) may not have been happy with her return as her alter ego Phoenix as a powerful evil doer working with Magneto (Ian McKellen) as she is a key player.  Toss in the deaths of a couple of mainstays and the ""curing"" of other returning characters and you may have upset a few fans.  The fray between Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto turns into a full scale war as a ""cure"" is developed that Magneto sees as an attempt to destroy the mutants and goes into a full rebellion to destroy the human race.  The Professor also reveals that his choice to succeed him as head of the X-Men is not Cyclops (James Marsden), but Storm (Halle Berry).

7681594,4,B01CE00Q5C,"The X-Men film series is still staying strong...that's not easy to pull off three films in, so it's very commendable.  Here, our heroes are faced with the announcement of a cure for the mutant gene and opinions on this are quite  split.
  Not only is there a cure to think about, but, for the first time, we learn much more about Jean Grey, played by Famke Janssen, who sacrificed herself in X2 to keep her friends and teammates from drowning in a flooding dam.  We learn what many X-Men fans already know about, the alternate personality of hers known as the Phoenix.  This identity allows her to survive the last film's flooding and has now taken her over completely, something that Professor Charles Xavier, played by Patrick Stewart, has spent years working to prevent as the Phoenix is dangerous at best for Jean and those around her.
  Meanwhile, someone who is clearly not thrilled about the mutant cure is Magneto, played by Sir Ian McKellen.  He asembles a team, which, for the first time to my knowledge in this film series, is given the name Brotherhood of Mutants, to forcefully oppose this cure, in the process abandoning a recently-imprisoned Mystique, played by Rebecca Romijn, who jumped in the way of a cure dart meant for her leader, taking the dose herself and becoming human.  With there being differing views on this cure even within the X-Men's own ranks, a battle is brewing, all while Jean Grey continues to lose more and more control to the Phoenix.
  This film definitely had more gimmicky moments than the last two (i.e. Logan's line ""Class is dismissed"" after a rough session in the Danger Room.)  Also, why house the facility with the cure on Alcatraz Island.  I can understand Magneto targeting the Statue of Liberty in the first film, but there's no real point to this setup here.  If you wanted to house the cure facility in a prison, I can name plenty of active and defunct facilities on the mainland that are much more secure.  If you needed a recognizable landmark...again, more secure ones on the mainland are available.
  I also have a problem with Magneto abandoning Mystique when she was cured.  First, she's been loyal to a fault for two films.  Second, she took that cure dart for him like someone would take a bullet.  Third, the woman was pleading not to be left behind.  I know Magneto not the nicest guy in the world, but I never saw him as being that cold.
  But there is an upside to that scene.  The prison that Magneto and his crew infiltrate to break out Mystique and other potential recruits is pretty cool...not as cool as the prison from the first two films, but still pretty cool.  Plus, it shows that our government is doing something about the mutants who are giving good mutants a bad name.  Sure, a few gimmicky aspects (i.e. Multiple Man having robbed multiple banks at once) but I'll let that go.
  What's also great is that the cast, for the most part, are all still the same as the first two films.  Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat is a new addition even though we've seen and heard about this character in the first two films.  But those were all pretty brief cameos which had her showing off her phasing powers more than anything else, so I'll let that inconsistency go.  The real crime here is not giving Ellen Page much more to do in this film.  Come on!  She's a very talent actress!  Give her like twenty more scenes.  Oh well...let's hope that with Ellen Page in the role, Kitty Pryde is here to stay.
  Someone who was also short-changed in terms of his screen time was Kelsey Grammer, who joined the cast as Dr. Hank McCoy/Beast.  I knew little beforehand about this character except for that he was smart, blue, and furry.  Here, he's the U.S. Secretary for Mutant Affairs on the President's Cabinet.  Such an awesome character with such an awesome position being played by such an awesome actor deserves more.  I can only hope that he too will be seen much more in the future.
  This film is about 95% as great as its predecessors.  Any X-Men fan should go see it.  If you've never seen an X-Men film before, watch them all...you'll be right on board then.  Enjoy.",1405036800,,4141,4.586630286493861

7681611,2,B01CE00Q5C,"I started reading X-Men as a boy - right when the legendary Chris Claremont took over writing them and created characters like Storm, Nightcrawler and of course, Wolverine.

What made X-Men incredible was three things:
1) Social relevance - people hated and feared simply because they were different, they served as a parable for oppressed people - particularly people of color and gays. In the civil rights mythology, Magneto is the Malcolm X to Professor Xavier's MLK;
2) Diversity - in a world of white American superheroes, this was the first international superhero group - gathered from all over the world - African, Japanese, Russian, Irish, German, Canadian, and Native American,
3) Despite being hated and feared, they were unquestionably heroic.

This rich heritage has been the backdrop for over 35 years of stories. Sadly, none of this was evident in this movie. The underlying storyline of striving for justice in a world of injustice was completely lost in the admittedly cool, apocalyptic levels of destruction. Superheros are just that -- super-heroic. Its not so much about their abilities as their character. That's why I've been a comic book fan for so many years. But in this case, ""The Last Stand"" was a superhero film with lots of ""supers"", but very few heroes.

I did give it two stars for the amazing special effects (Magneto's destruction of the Golden Gate bridge was worth one star alone) and because more than anyone else in the film, Hugh Jackman unerringly channels the essence of the Wolverine character and captures the nuances that made this character so popular with so many for so long.

I didn't hate this movie, but I was relieved that the most recent ""Days of Future Past"" undoes much of what happened in this particular film.",1402358400,,1764,4.929292929292929

My major problem with this film is the motivations of the several characters included and how they do not match with what had already been established. Without delving into spoilers it is hard to fully explain what I mean, however, it seems that the actions taken by two main characters in particular almost fly in the face of what had been established in the Original and X-2. Looking past that, and the clear shoehorning in of several characters from the comic books, the movie is entertaining. While no where near the caliber of X-Men, X-2, First Class, or particularly the newly released Days of Future Past, this is a movie worth viewing particularly for fans of the genera.",1401062400,,819,4.694444444444445

It's just one of those things

Yet, it's not an awful film. I found it watchable and enjoyable. I loved the performances by Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart as well as Ellen Paige and Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Romjin Stamos is always pleasing to watch, ahem.  If for no other reason, watch this movie for the vast cast of mutants who make an appearance! Nevermind that the Juggernaut isn't really a mutant, but rather derived his power from a magical helmet.

!!!!!!Warning SPOILERS!!!!!!!!

The movie picks up roughly a year or so after the end of the previous movie. The X-mean have been mourning the loss of Dr. Gray, with Scott,of course, the most crestfallen.

As he ignores his teaching duties, and falls further into sadness, Scott decides to return to Alkali Lake. Leaving Logan to substitute teach in his place, he returns to the scene to find Dr. Gray (Pheonix) alive and extremely powerful. Let's just say things don't go to well for Scott.

Phoenix returns to her parents house where Charles and the newly escaped Magneto join forces in an attempt to take her back. Magneto has his own plan to deal with the new danger and Charles has his own way of fighting. Lets just say. Things don't go to well for Charles. (BAD BAD WRONG!) Big mistake in this movie.

Anyway without giving away too much in terms of spoilers, the movie was great but only a 4 star because bad things happened to Charles. The movie was likely meant to be the last ever X-Men movie. Silly producers. That never happens.",1400025600,,1229,4.568181818181818

It's obvious this was foreshadowing that the machine magneto used unlocked or enhanced Jeans mutation and that's how they were going to write in the phoenix.

This adaptation continues where X-Men 2 left off, but then it totally deviates from the source material and almost destroyed the franchise, not to mention Xavier, Jean Grey, & Scott Summers. This film is the equivalent of what Schumacher's  'Batman & Robin' was to the Batman franchise.  With the upcoming 'X-Men Days of Futures Past' movie, Bryan Singer is basically having to do damage control and write in conditions that allow them to bring Xavier back after Ratner vaporized him.  Even X Men origins Wolverine, which wasn't great was exponentially better than this film.  If you are a fan of the X Men source material, just totally skip this movie.

7681674,3,B01CE00Q5C,"For the casual X-Men moviegoer fan this movie might satisfy: it has a lot of action, some fun special effects, and a tantalizing plot about being able to stop being someone you don't want to be in a moment through use of a miracle drug.  This probably resonates with a lot of people both because we are constantly told to be better than we are and that we can be all that we can be through some formula (drugs; diets; drinking the right beer...).  So this film, to be fair, has a good angle for a comic book action movie.  Oh, and they did a crackshot whizzbang job with the Beast (Kelsey Grammar, who'da thunk it! tremendous job!).  And there are a couple of shock-value moments (deaths of main characters, callous dismissals of others) that are sure to make the cinephiles following all of this to maybe perk up and go ""no way they just did that.""

So I'll admit to there being some entertainment value here.  But for the diehard fanatic, for the follower of the classic X-Men X-ploits the film deals beloved characters short-shrift (Cyclops) and major emotional main storylines as punchlines (I'm looking at you, Phoenix).  It's enough to make a raging Canuck like Wolvie cry.

But it's certainly not as horrible as a lot of diehard fans make it out.  It's also not nearly so great as some of the tailgaters claim.  For me it stepped in it at a couple of points.  X2 has been the best of the bunch and X1 was solid.",1381708800,2,1418,4.436293436293436

The film has its own merits but lack of background on the ""Mutants"" (people with super powers) makes it pretty much like walking into the theater halfway through its running time.  At any rate, there are, for those who are familiar with the characters, various opportunities to watch the burning and freezing powers, the super strength, mind reading, and bridge moving mutants, to  label only a few types. There is even less room than in previous episodes for actors to show much individualized skill but the action scenes are entertaining, particularly in the free-for-all which marks the culmination of the series.

Having grown up with the X-Men comics, I always thought these films gave particularly short shrift to Cyclops in lieu of Wolverine- whom the audiences love and have demanded more of since the first one, as long as Hugh Jackman is portraying him!
Scott Summers got the bad rap of brooding EMO guy from the get-go and never really got to have his character develop in any of these films. He was always overshadowed by Wolverine in X1, X2 and a mere accessory in Wolverine: Origins. Yes, he had a very tough childhood that Wolverine: Origins makes reference to, however, in the comics, he eventually overcomes his insecurities and self-disesteem and becomes a great leader of the original 5 X-Men, him, Marvel Girl, Iceman, Beast and Angel, and a leader of later team manifestations of the X-Men and X-Factor.  In fact, the comics nearly always portrayed Wolverine as a short-tempered, hotheaded, loose cannon, while Cyclops was more cool-headed and even-tempered, if stubborn about certain positions, which was why he was the team leader. Cyclops would sometimes have to duke it out with the much more short-fused Wolverine drawing his claws and coming at Cyclops, who'd optic blast away back at Logan to get his point across until the two grew tired of their feuding to focus on the mutual baddies.
This movie ended in the worst possible way, suggesting the Dark Phoenix killed the man Jean Gray always loved and Jean Gray getting dispatched by the rival and character who stole the show of the whole movie franchise. Professor X being killed off was bad enough, but without conflict and losses that ensue in that conflict, there is of course no story and it could have been sustained had the movie ended differently.
I realize that with the X-Men, it's difficult to give bandwidth to all of the characters equally because there are so many. Some have to be emphasized and others exiled to the periphery. However, writing and killing off Cylcops and Jean Gray completely, in addition to Professor X on the casualty list, earns only two stars despite the lavish and generous employment of special effects on top of the action, action, action, that had little heart and lacklustered the overall saga continuity.",1374192000,,2484,4.856132075471698

This film and every movie since have been incredible mediocre.  While this movie has great effects, great action, and can be entertaining, it is a big step down from the first two films.

One thing that I hated was the killing of certain characters like they were nothing.  Cyclops is shafted even more here than in the first two movies, which is not a good thing.  Within the first half hour he is killed unceremoniously like he never mattered.  Cyclops is supposed to be the leader of the X-Men, so for him to get killed like he did is an insult to his character.  Professor X also gets the ax is this film in an equally idiotic fashion.  What is worse is that there is virtually no impact in both Cyclops and Professor X's deaths.  The rest of the team mourn but then move on like a scene or two later.

If they did this to try to make the film darker then they totally failed.  Another bad aspect of this film is that it has a very uneven tone.  There are times where it is very dark and gritty and at other times where it feels very silly like Juggernaut doing one-liners or the X-Men cracking jokes while in the middle of a huge battle.  The point is that sometimes the film is very dark but at other times it is a fun comic book film, which is very weird.  I do not quite know who this movie is for.

They introduce new mutants, like Angel, just for them to play a very minor role or do basically nothing.  These mutants are in the film just to be in the film and that is all.  The only new mutant that gets any push in the movie is Beast.  Beast is great and is one of the better aspects about the movie.  Other main characters from the other movies are just tossed aside like they do not matter.  Mystic and Rogue, who were both important characters in the previous films, are given nothing to do and are barely in the movie.

I also did not like how they handled Jean Grey in this film.  In this movie they try to adapt the Phoenix saga from the comics.  However, the Phoenix is portrayed very different here than the source material.  In the comics the Phoenix is a symbiotic fire entity that possessed Jean and gave her the power to burn everything to ashes.  In the film the Phoenix is Jean's dual personality that was created from Professor X sealing up part of Jean's abilities when she was younger.  I do not care for this at all.  If they were trying to go for a more realistic approach then they failed.  If anything it made it sillier.

The good aspects of this film are definitely the action scenes.  This film I will say has the best action scenes of all the X-Men films.  The final battle was especially enjoyable.  The effects are also phenomenal.  The effects for Beast are especially good.  This Beast looks ten times better than the Beast in X-Men First Class, which is sad because this film was made in 2006 compared to 2011.  They also got a better actor to play the role.  Ian McKellen does great once again as Magneto.  Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is still a badass.

Overall, X-Men the Last Stand is an entertaining film as far as action goes.  However, the problems are major ones and besides the action the film is not very fun to sit through.  It was depressing really.  I do not recommend this to fans of the comics or fans of the first two films.  If you just want great action then give it a look.  The rest, however, I do not recommend it.",1373241600,,3670,4.284256559766764
7681715,4,B01CE00Q5C,"X-Men The Last Stand is a great third movie of the series and truly mind blowing special effects that made my mouth drop down.  Me personally savored the movie and the plotline and both the bad guys and good guys mutant wise, some people bad mouth this movie because of the plotline but I saw potential in it.  No matter what it lived up to all the hype from people telling me about the movie, and for 5 dollars well worth every dollar I spent on it.  If you need a great action movie made good in honor of the comic book series then pick up this movie and savor the mind blowing special effects and amazing fight scenes by the mutants fighting for what they feel right path, and how far you will go to save the person you love with all your heart (spoiler)talking of course about Wolverine and Jean Gray.  As for the special effects I found what they did with the San Fransico Bridge amazing work by the people who made it all possible.

*************SPOILERS*******************************************

So, there aren't any characters. Cyclops, one of the most beloved X-Men, IS KILLED OFF CAMERA..and then buried..AT THE END OF THE FILM? There's the heavy-handed
""oh. there's a body waiting for Professor X to pop into later"" thing. And Magneto might have his powers still? THE WHAT THE HECK WAS THE POINT??? The best cast character was THE BEAST so, of
course, he's barely iN the movie. Rogue has constantly been downplayed in the series and this is no different. She kicks BUTT in the comics. In the films she just a milksop...and she's from my home state. meh. The fact that Famke Janssen pretty much stood around in the background until needed. The angel flew across the country to do what again?!! How'd he get there at the EXACT second to save..whoever that was. The took out the coolest character in the series..MYSTIQUE?? lame. LAME. LAME. LAME. The filmwas obviously slapped together with footage from the other two movies. There are so many plot holes in the script that it reads like a haiku. Storm is written and played weakly as ever. and..I'm tired of X-Men being just Wolverine's side-kicks...he's not that cool. Nightcrawler was far more interesting as a character. Kitty Pryde was wasted. This movie was terrible... and I am a huge comics nerd and I get why people would defend it. But, this is a perfect example of what big studios do to great stories JUST to make a profit.

I think it is unfortunate that they didn't make a fourth one right away, especially considering the closing cliff-hangers. However, having said that each actor was at their finest, it was Ian McKellan who stole the show for me. No one else could have given us a Magneto like he did, proving what a talented actor he is. He is intimidating, yet we sympathize with him, and though he might seem at times like a villain, I cannot help but root for him. Patrick Stewart as his counterpart plays his role with almost equal talent, and Hugh Jackman does a great job as Wolverine. Great movie!",1360800000,,737,4.633587786259542

Pros:
Good movie, solid plot, nod to some characters and plotlines that comic fans would know, Hugh Jackman, entertaining twist with Mystique, has Beast in it, Leech was well thought out, reference to Juggernaut meme, etc

Cons:
Some of the nods are horrid (Like Callisto. Seriously?! She deserves better.)
Jean Grey annoys me greatly as does Scott and this didn't do a lot to make them very sympathetic.
Nightcrawler is gone entirely and no one even bothers to comment on it the entire movie!
They have had a different actress for Kitty in EVERY movie! Ahhhh!
Pyro is lame to begin with so why did they make him so central? Go with Avalanche or even better go with Domino or someone actually worth the time and effort.
They turned the Morlocks into goths with tattoos which is seriously watering them down.
And so on.

It isn't a bad movie and 90% of the reason I own it is because I love Beast but I was very angry at the way they jacked with the plot. Making Kurt super timid in X2 was bad enough!",1360368000,,1061,4.348484848484849

7681772,3,B01CE00Q5C,"The first two installments of the X Men films were great. The big absence however,of Brian Singer is painfully obvious while watching this.
Where Singer tended to hold back,Bret Ratner lets loose and you can really feel the inconsistency while watching. Two major plots are slopped together here and neither one is given due respect. Though the film does have a few highlights worth mentioning.
Kelsey Grammar as Beast exceeded all my expectations,yet the end result for the iconic Juggernaut (played by Vinnie Jones) was a huge let down.
The movie does pull some huge emotional weight in a few scenes that leave you in disbelief. The film also has alot of action which I felt was somewhat missing from the first two. It's just a shame it was added at the expense of the story.

So what is the story?
The government has created a cure for genetic mutation (That was fast) while at the same time the supposedly dead Jean Grey returns from her watery end to wreak havoc on all her old friends. On top of this the long awaited war promised by Magneto since the first film is finally coming to pass.

7681788,2,B01CE00Q5C,"We've seen this time & time again people, classic movies that had 2 good releases only to end with a sorry excuse of a thrid part. Movies that come to mind would be the Godfather Trilogy, Home Alone Trilogy, Jurrasic Park trilogy, Ninja Turtles, & even some with 4 parts such as House Party & Superman. Why is this an ongoing trend you ask? I really don't know honestly. Well the same format applies here to the X-men triology. The first 2 films were pretty good with the second one being the best out the three in my book. While the first 2 had its flaws this third 1 is a total train wreck & isn't even worthy of being its own seperate film let alone part of a trilogy! The story revolves around the government coming up with a ""cure"" for mutants to permantely disable their powers or alien like physique so that the humans will be in favor. A good idea for a story but it didn't actually help to break off into a another story with Jean coming back from her alledged death from the second film & merging with pheonix. The latter story is just stupid for many reasons. For one, when will these movie directors/producers stop using insanely powerful heroes or villians in these movies? Pheonix in the comics is actually 20 times more powerful than depicted in this film so much more powerful that it was able to hold its own with a mid fed galactus. Also pheonix is a being from space who chose jean as a host it had nothing to do with her mind. & why would they kill off cyclops & professor x 2 prominent character in the x-men series? thats just plain retarded. I don't recall either of them getting killed off by jean in the comics rather transported to an alternate dimension or something but not killed off. Of course Magneto & his now much larger band of evil mutants are still at war with Prof x & the x-men as well as the human race. While attempting to Free Juggernaut & Multiple man from police custody (yeah picture juggernaut being held captive by police)one of the officers manages to shoot & inject Mystique with the ""cure"" which results in here losing her mutand powers & blue streak appearance. Magneto then disowns her & seeks out Jean whos power is off the charts thanks to phoenix. When Magneto & his crew finally reach Jean they are also come face to face with the x-men in which a fight breaks out between Juggs & logan & Storm & one of magneto's newer mutant henchwomen. Speaking of Juggernaut, why are they disregarding the relationship of Prof X & Juggernaut? They're supposed to be step brothers with Juggernaut aka Cain Marko having a burning hatred for his brother yet they never even interact or acknowledge each other. Thats something simple they still managed to get wrong arghhhhhhh!

Prof X & Magneto both try to win over Jean with her new found powers & she ends up killing the professor & going with Magneto. Now that Magneto has Jean on his side hes going to official strike at the human race only to have Jean get power hungry or something & turn on him & the other evil mutants making her the greater threat. Once again the x-men & magneto & his crew hunt down jean whos causing havoc in the city &. A Big showdown breaks out & Jean even ends up killing some of the mutants. Eventually Jean unleashes some surrounding energy that vaporizes anybody within reach so wolverine decides to take her down given his healing factor (yeah that'll happen).

This Movie was just a big mess, 2 stories with rather confusing plotholes, alot of useless characters (why is rouge on here again? she completely sucks easily the worst adapotion I've seen of her character even worse then x-men evolution's version), & they disregard simple aspects that make up x-men storyline. They even leave out some of the characters from part 2 such as the ever loveable nightcrawler. wheres gambit? even sabertooth was absent here. One good thing I can say about this movie is Fraiser as the beast, he did an excellent job & the makeup looked well to.

This movie would have went better if it had a story involving the Sentinels I mean they are a pretty important part of x-men but obvioulsy the film makers didn't think so. The plot should have involved the X-men & Magneto & his brotherhood still at war with the humans finally getting fed up & has a scientist create the sentinels & mastermold but of course this will never happen.

The director was trying to please too many fans, and when he tried
to give the fans what they wanted, they were disappointed with
it. The same thing with Spider-Man 3... I just watched this
movie to be entertained, I really enjoyed it!

What I liked about it was:
1. Every actor in the movie was great with their character!
2. The action sequences were hard core!
3. The visual effects just keep getting better and better
with each movie!
4. Each character served a great purpose in the end!
5. I'm glad to see that both Magneto and Mystique got what
they deserved... they lost their powers!
6. The movie focused well on it's two plots: the Dark Phinoex
and the mutant cure!
7. The battle of ice and fire between Pyro and Ice Man was priceless!
8. Most of the new characters (Calisto, Juggernaut, and Beast) got some good
screening time!
9. It's about time we have an X-Men movie that was full of action and explosions!
10. I love how Wolverine stepped up to the plate and was a leader!

What I didn't like was:
1. Colossus and Angel were not given enough to do!
2. The movie could have had a better wrap-up for an ending!

Bottom line: People were expecting too much out of this movie and that is why some said it
sucked! But I personally enjoyed it! With a few minor flaws though...

""The Last Stand"" does wrap up the story line, but as a fan of the comics and growing up watching the TV-series in the 90's could never give this X-Men blasphemy better than a 3-star rating. The film did succeed in giving plenty of twists and questions, especially to start the film, yet most did not match the X-men comic franchise. The story does give a decent bit of back history to Jean Grey. The action does not stop and culminates in a mutant vs. mutant great battle. There are tons of characters; almost all of the mutants from the 2nd X-Men movie return and 5 significant new ones arise (Beast, Multiple Man, Juggernaut (not that he is actually a mutant), a specific sapping mutant, and a certain elegant flying one). Too many characters are either physically or 'mutantly' eliminated for my taste.",1341792000,,884,4.60126582278481
7681791,2,B01CE00Q5C,"I enjoyed X-men and X-men 2, but felt that Last Stand could have been much better.  Magneto is a great villain, but why does he have to have so much screen time in practically every film?  There are so many more villains from the comics they haven't even touched yet.  I've been dying to see Mr. Sinister or Apocalypse on the big screen for over 10 years.  It's always Magneto Magneto Magneto.

  And don't even get me started on what the writers did with Phoenix.  Just some psycho who goes around killing for no reason at all.

  And what was with that Sentinel in the opening scene?  I'd have loved to have seen more of them.  Less regular joes with cure guns and more giant mutant hunting robots, please.  Now that would have been a heck of a final battle.

  So if they ever make an x4 I'm guessing the villain will probably be Magneto... again.  He's one of my favorite villains so I can't believe I'm getting bored with him in this film series.  I think the actor did a magnificent job, but it's time to branch out a bit more when it comes to X-men villains.  Onslaught anyone?  Days of Future Past kind of movie, maybe?

7681792,1,B01CE00Q5C,"Normally I like to give only good ratings (to good movies). This movie however, is so dreadful that I feel compelled to warn others of it. Void of the director Bryan Singer, (director of the first two X-Men) This movie ranks at the bottom of the barrel of the Marvel Super Hero movies. First of all, you don't just start killing off X-Men, especially Professor X ( or is he really dead?) And if he is not dead, why kill him off in the first place? They did a horrible job portraying Jean Grey as Dark Phoenix. Nothing at all like the comic book. It did not come close to doing her character justice. Even though I enjoy the villain Magneto, why is it that he has to appear as the main villain in every single X-Men movie? There are plenty of other great villains to go around. One of the very best X-Men stories and X-Men villains was The Juggernaut. If new director Brett Ratner had done this right, The Juggernaut as the main villain could have been the best X-Men movie ever. Instead, Ratner decides to portray The Juggernaut as a 3rd class villain, basically a campy goof as if he were appearing as a henchman in The original Batman TV series from the mid 1960's. What a shame and what a waste. Because of this, it is highly unlikely that The Juggernaut will ever be taken seriously going forward. The only good thing about this movie is the evolution of Storms hair. But even her stunning looks are not enough to breath life into this extremely dissappointing third installment. In the meantime, we can only pray for the return of Bryan Singer.",1336262400,2,1549,4.43859649122807
7681793,5,B01CE00Q5C,"I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.

The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant ""X"" gene. Two mutant leaders, who are also old friends, take highly contrasting positions. Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a ""Brotherhood of Mutants"" with a clear attitude of superiority. And, as they say, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

You could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.

Although everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality - ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000AYELVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men (Widescreen Edition)</a>"" (2000), ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X2-X-Men-United-Two-Disc-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0000BWVCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X2: X-Men United (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>"" (2003) and ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (2006).

""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is generally well-regarded but has a very vocal segment of fans who revile it. This makes little sense since, despite having a new director, the film has the same tone and principle actors as the previous two and brings to culmination the ideas presented therein. Aside from the final fight between Magneto's Brotherhood and Xavier's X-Men we get the resurrection of Jean Grey and her struggle with the dark side of her psyche.

Some complain of the deaths of two prominent characters, but how often are characters resurrected in comics? Isn't one significant character resurrected in this very film? Others complain about the supposed short runtime and lack of depth but X3 has the exact same runtime as the first film (104 minutes) and there's plenty of depth to mine, take Rogue's dilemma over taking a cure for human intimacy, Phoenix's incredible inner conflict symbolizing the universal clash of flesh and spirit/id and super-ego, Cyclop's grief and astonishing discovery, Pyro's moral degeneration, Mystique's plight after getting kicked out of the Brotherhood and Wolverine's struggle to do the right thing despite his deep love, to name just six.

""The Last Stand"" was the most successful of the original trilogy and has also out-performed the two prequels, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-Origins-Wolverine-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B001GCUO1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men Origins: Wolverine (Single-Disc Edition)</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-First-Class/dp/B004LWZW42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men: First Class</a>.""

The plot is stupid, the mutations go from just believable to down right ridiculous, and all the actors look really bored and tired of playing their roles. The dialog is terrible, and the whole movie is plagued by a non-stop onslaught on painful one-liners. The death of Professor X was completely pointless, and while the whole Jean Grey/Phoenix thing, while an interesting motive, is handled completely wrong. Probably the most cool character, Mystique, gets her mutation ripped, and it's really pointless and cheap. Also I really hate the character Hank McCoy (aka Beast). Another complaint is all the pointless and stupid shots of the winged mutant ""soaring triumphantly"" through the skies (if you've seen the film you know what I'm talking about).

7681797,1,B01CE00Q5C,"I begin this review by proclaiming myself a fan, not of the X-men, but of good X-Men stories. So, I don't like nor care for most of the X-Men franchise. I think maybe I've wasted too much time trying to read something good from a team that Marvel knows is going to sell anyway, and most of the time they didn't even bother to give it good writers.
But, some times, occasionally, we find a great story within the pages of the X-Men comics. The characters and the background story allow for lots of possibilities should a bold writer decide to accept the task. The same can be said for the X-Men films. X-1 was a passable, if a little bizarre, opening movie. I didn't like it too much, though at least it didn't embarrass me (unlike Batman and Robin, for example, which was VERY embarrassing). X-Men 2 was, in my opinion, simply great. It had everything it needed to become the perfect superhero movie. Gosh, the opening sequence alone was full of awesomeness! (if such a word exists). The story had a few plot twists, very very well executed, and the characters were very well developed.
Then, for some unknown reason, Marvel decided to kill the franchise. What did they do? Behold! Spoilers follow: they turned everybody into a violent version of themselves. They forgot to build the movie around an interesting story. The only plot twists they could think of, were to kill as many important characters as possible. Heck, some friend of mine even shed a tear after X-Men 2 took its toll, and here nobody really cared who lived or who died. They completely forgot about characterization, and many mutants appearing and taking part in the final battle weren't even given names. I can imagine how the conversations about the script of this movie might have gone: what are we going to do now? We are already out of beer and we haven't come up with a single idea yet. Oh, wait, I know! Let's just kill a lot of characters, people are going to be freaked out! - And so we were.

7681801,3,B01CE00Q5C,"It's really sad when nearly every one of the deleted scenes on a DVD would have been an improvement on the film they were cut from. That's the way it is with X-Men: The Last Stand, the disappointingly anti-climactic final chapter in the X-Men trilogy.

The film itself waffles between cheesy and dark, largely because the thematically-heavy script by Zak Penn clashes with the fluffy sensibilities of hack director Brett Ratner (who was called in at the last minute to replace the original slated director Matthew Vaughn). Desperate to turn the film into a colorful action spectacle, Ratner denies most of the subplots any time to develop properly-- the film, despite being loaded with characters and concepts, clocks in at a lean 104 minutes (30 whole minutes shorter than X2). Most of the new characters, such as Angel and Juggernaut, add nothing whatsoever to the film, and characters from previous films are crudely dispatched without any dramatic impact (one central character is killed off-screen, and is forgotten five minutes later).

The DVD adds insult to injury. Both editions of the film (widescreen and special) are exactly the same disc: a bare-bones release with commentaries, trailers, and deleted scenes. The deleted scenes are painful to sit through-- not because they're bad (for the most part), but because they include scenes CRUCIAL to the story's development, and alternate scenes that would have greatly improved the movie.

For example, Wolverine is grossly mischaracterized in the theatrical cut of the film: during the scene where the X-Men prepare to fly off an fight Magneto, Logan gives a rousing speech to the X-Kids (Iceman, Kitty, and the virtually mute Colossus) about standing together and fighting for the values that (SPOILERS) Professor X and Cyclops gave their lives for (END SPOILERS). He essentially becomes the true-blue hero leader, and convinces a bunch of teenagers to go fight and possibly die for a higher set of ideals. THAT IS NOT, IN ANY WAY, HOW LOGAN WOULD BEHAVE. Logan is a loner, not a leader, and he's certainly not an idealist; he's only on the team so he can try to save Jean from herself, not to fight for the Professor's great cause. And there's no way in HELL that he would talk a group of rookie teenage superheroes into dying on the battlefield for that cause. That's where the alternate version of the scene comes in: in it, Logan says the teens AREN'T coming, and Iceman and Kitty try to convince him to let them fight. Logan, clearly aware that they're marching off to their deaths, scoffs at their childish notions of heroism, and only relents when he realizes that they need to work together to have any hope of winning at all. It's a MUCH stronger scene, backed by a much more mature understanding of the ethics of fighting over beliefs and featuring a portrayal of Logan that's totally in character. Yet it was cut and replaced with jingoistic tripe, either because the director wanted to turn Wolverine into Captain America, or because the original scene was deemed to challenging for the atrophied brains of the summer movie-going crowd.

It's not the only example of such changes. All three alternate endings (they're actually separate scenes that combine to form one, complete ending) are more effective than the theatrical version, leaving the characters in far more interesting places. 30-second chunks of narrative-- some that would explain HUGE plot holes on inconsistencies-- litter the deleted scene menu, and one gets the feeling that if you could just cut them back into the film, the quality would improve drastically. Unfortunately, it's not true. Thanks to Ratner's lackluster direction and lack of taste, what could have been the grand finale of a fantastic trilogy instead sputters to a meager and unimpressive halt. There are flashes of excellence here and there-- Kelsey Grammer's Beast is practically ripped from the comic pages, and the confrontation with Jean in act two is actually pretty awesome-- but unless you have some pretty low standards or a high threshold for pain, I wouldn't recommend this movie.",1307404800,3,4100,5.016152716593245

7681804,3,B01CE00Q5C,"X-Men: The Last Stand is the exactly the kind of finale to the trilogy that you would expect if you've seen the others. stripped down plots cobbled together from the long history of x-men comics with small appearances by notable characters. but there are some nice bits too.

plot-wise, if you are a fan of the comics and are hoping the film will be true to them than you're probably going to be disappointed. it's not that the story is bad necessarily... just not good. one gets the feeling they didn't know exactly where they wanted to go with it or what they wanted to say and everything they did say was already done to satisfaction in the previous movies. however, to be fair, coming up with a finale to an x-men series, that works, is extraordinarily difficult. considering the massive amounts of story arcs, characters, and the fact that the actual story isn't going to end anytime soon... this isn't the worst job they could have done. overall, while it doesn't work remarkably well, it's a decent film.

on the other hand, where this film really distinguishes itself (and indeed the whole trilogy for the most part) is it's casting choices. half the appeal of a comic book adaptation is seeing your favorite characters portrayed in a live-action presentation and, in this, the film succeeds remarkably. Kelsey Grammer is wonderful and very fitting as The Beast, Vinnie Jones does a smashing job as the Juggernaut, and whoever came up with casting Ellen Page as Kitty Pride should be given a medal. her performance is probably one of the only really outstanding things about this film. of course the other actors from the previous films do great jobs too and seem to really want to bring their characters to life (especially Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart). unfortunately, the script and story just doesn't give them much to work with.

basically, as long as you aren't looking for anything amazingly faithful to the original idea and come expecting a hollywood interpretation, it's a fine film. not mind-blowing or astonishing but not a disaster either.",1302566400,2,2064,4.841359773371105

7681821,2,B01CE00Q5C,"This film was doomed as soon as James Mardesen signed on to be Louis Lane's husband in ""Superman Returns,"" which forced writers to kill him of.

Folks also really need to stop blaming Bret Ratner for Cyclops' death. Are you stupid? do you even know what a director does? He has no choice when it comes to story! The film makers had no choice but to kill cyclops off because the actor that plays him was off with the original director making ""Superman Returns."" So if you want to blame someone for why cyclops dies in x3, blame Bryan Singer! He's the one who chose to not finish what he started! Blame actor James Mardesen, who signed on for the most worthless role in his life, playing Louis Lane's husband in a movie that was a complete downer! Bryan Singer really screwed up going for that superman movie instead on finishing his X-Men trilogy. If you listen to the audio commentary, the producers say, we had to limit cyclops' role because James was off making superman returns and was barely around to film. There you go! Stop blaming Bret Ratner for God's sake because all it shows is your ignorance!!

I know what you are thinking. They should have hired another actor but it's not that easy. There are contractual obligations and if they wanted to use another actor they would have to pay James Mardesen thousands of dollars, which a movie studio never wants to do because they constantly want to save money and not go over budget. For example, when they killed Michael Bein off in ""Alien 3"" they had to pay him thousands of dollars! He made more money off dying off screen in ""Alien 3"" than his whole performance in ""Aliens""! X3 has that ""Alien 3"" curse on it, where it's a good movie but there was so much standing in its way that it's not what fans expected.

The only redeeming qualities of this film are Kelsey Grammar as beast and Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde. What a waste. I wish i could magically transport their performances into x1 or x2 but not even they could make this film very watchable. Halle Berry and Hugh were great too but that ordeal with Cyclops is like a thorn to my side and i can't get over it.

what i hate more than what happened to Cyclops that didn't involve hollywood politics is what they did to rogue. Having her character take the cure goes against everything the x men stand for and with that i can tell you these screenplay writers don't have a clue and are blasphemous when it comes to x men. the x men are all about accepting yourself as you are and learning to control your powers!!! even in the audio commentery the writers say that the ending where she doesn't take the cure is for Rogue fans, so wouldn't they have put that in the film!!? their reasoning was because ""it sucks that she can't get with nobody."" what a bunch of morons. this was like watching someone piss on a church and it hurt me, more than the death of cyclops.

Also the ending is ridiculous so magento who is the equivelant of osama bin laden is just sitting in the park playing chess and no one takes notice even though he was terrorizing the whole country and hundreds of soldiers died on alcatraz!? So, the cure still exists and everyone is happy? so jean come back only to...die again? this film was pointless. blame the screenwriters and the producers but not bret ratner.",1282262400,,3293,4.445364238410596

""the cure"" is supposed to involve Apocalypse.

my ONLY solution is that everyone that died got absorbed into Jean's mind and once she died they all come back to this reality?
or it is all just a dream that happens for that instant at the end of X2 when the professor says it is all going to be OK.... this all could just be his vision?

ACTUALLY- if they would do a ""Days of Future Past"" film that prevents this cure from going into production (preventing the Legacy Virus) & Cable also brings the sentinal program for the danger room from the future so they can prepare incase it still happens. so that explains that....
and this film would be set just after Jean is in the water & they pull her out & put her in suspended state of hibernation ... this saves her to come back later as dark phoenix in a better way...
just an idea, but it is going to take some creativity to rescue this...

(I read my first Marvel comic in 1963, when I was in the 3rd grade.) This is the darkest of the three films and is operatic and tragic in its style. The battle sequences are many, and the fight choreography is graceful and spectacular--a tribute to the art of Jack Kirby, who is the Michaelangelo of graphic artists. Fans will especially love Kelsey Grammer in the role of The Beast. Professional reviewers thought he was a rediculous choice, but old-time fans will see him as perfect. Other standout perfomances are the great Ian McKellan as Magneto (his voice and delivery are hypnotic) and the marvelous Australian Vinnie Jones as the ruthless and powerful Juggernaut. The relationship between Wolverine and Jean Grey is the element that moves the story, and is what brings us to the great climax of the film.

Even Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) seems to have settled in as part of the team, although in Danger Room simulations he still has a tendency to bend the rules.  But Scott Summers (James Marsden) is so consumed by grief over the death of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) that he's abdicated his position as leader, forcing Storm (Halle Berry) to step into the slot--a job she doesn't want.  And Magneto (Ian McKellen) remains at large and a matter of deep concern to the government.  Then Jean is unexpectedly resurrected from the depths of Alkali Lake.  But Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) fears what the strain of saving herself may have done to her Class 5 mutant powers.  Meanwhile, Warren Worthington II (Michael Murphy), head of a great pharmaceutical company, has announced the creation of a vaccine that can suppress--permanently--all mutant ability.  Despite assurances that taking it will be entirely voluntary, Magneto, that survivor of the Holocaust, fears what its existence may mean and begins assembling a mutant army called ""The Brotherhood.""  In the end, it's five Xavier students against a mass of raging outlaw mutants with a weapon that may mean the end of the world.

But let's not focus on the negative.

Here's why it's a better film:

- It has a better plot

- It actually puts the mutants through some pain for a change (after two films of seeing them dance rings around humanity, they, like the characters from the truly awful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Matrix-Trilogy-The-Matrix-The-Matrix-Reloaded-The-Matrix-Revolutions-HD-DVD/dp/B000E1MTZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Matrix Trilogy (The Matrix/ The Matrix Reloaded/ The Matrix Revolutions) [HD DVD</a>], never really seemed to be in any great peril. Not so with this film. A weapon that can definitively rob them of their mutant natures levels the playing field).

- It injects some moral ambiguity into the plot; you can tell that Ian McKellen (himself a legendary gay activist in the UK) relishes the chance to explore the concept of a cure for a condition (read 'orientation') that can mold one's identity whilst simultaneously making them a societal outcast in some quarters. Kudos to McKellen's performance - I actually found myself rooting for Magneto's brotherwood to prevail.

Brett Ratner clearly feels less affection for the characters than Bryan Singer and in this case, that's no bad thing. I don't mind a director loving his characters as long he's not prepared to let that get in the way of the plot - something that Singer always did. I'll be honest, I wrote off the X-Men films after seeing the first two, but this one actually caused me to go out and hire&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-Origins-Wolverine/dp/B001GCUO1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men Origins: Wolverine</a>&nbsp;the night after I saw this on television.

Magneto decides to declair war against humans while some mutants do like the idea of a cure especially troubled Rogue (Anna Paquin) who wants to be cured of her dangerous powers. It's up to the X-Men like Storm (Halle Berry), Wolverine (Huge Jackman), and new member Beast (Kelsey Grammer) to stop this war before humanity is doomed including mutant-kind.

A very weak finale to the major Marvel based movie trilogy! it's quite complex but does have an interesting concept about curing people who are different then any normal human being, replacing Bryan Singer with Brett Ratner is kind of a dumb move. The film unlike the first two are rushed but does introduce some more mutants like Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), Angel (Ben Foster) and Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) but the problem is that the story is prepostorous and the humor goes way too far unlike in the first two. The film does kill off some members of the X-Men but i ain't gonna tell you who for the film isn't as bad as fans proclaimed, it deserves another look since it's a very exciting finale of the series.

Underdeveloped characters like Collossus, Roque, Angel, Kitty Pryde and Iceman step in to fight the final battle. But they are so underdeveloped that we just don't care what happens.

I understand some of the concerns for this movie, and I agree with some of them. There was a change of directors between the first two films and this one, and it shows. This movie also made the mistake that the first two didn't - it introduced way too many mutants with not enough time to properly flesh them out. So why did I like this movie...
Well... here is where I'm probably going to get heat.
This is purely MY opinion, but I never liked Cyclops... at all. I cringe when people say, ""they should do an X-Men Origins on Cyclops!"" Ehhhh... So without spoiling anything, when Cyclops's screen time was 'cut short' I was very happy. Also, when Professor Xavier's screen time was 'cut short, I didn't object to that either. BUT DON'T GET ME WRONG! I love Xavier and he's one of my favorite guys, and it was a huge risk to do this in the story, but I believe that what happened in his scenario added a stronger sense of sadness and desperateness to win the battle and make 'The Last Stand'.
The story was clever and it took a lot of risks. But my favorite thing about this movie was the action. We finally get to see Iceman cover his whole body in ice, Storm is a lot more powerful, and Magneto was the @*%$. Even with the action better, there were still some things I wished I could've seen. It would've been cool for Pyro to make images with his fire attacks, and Rouge could've been more active.

7681853,4,B01CE00Q5C,"In the last decade one genre has returned from almost certain death to become one of Hollywood's most lucrative sources of income. That genre is that of the superhero, or comic book genre as it is most commonly referred to as. Several franchises have been successfully established within this revived genre, some standouts would be the `Spider-Man' movies, `Batman' reboot and the `Blade' trilogy. In the midst of all of those, one franchise has stood out from all the others by taking the focus of the comic book film away from being only on a few key characters and onto an entire team of heroes. This set of movies is none other than the `X-Men' franchise.

After two highly successful trips to the box office with ""X-Men"" and ""X2: X-Men United"", both with Bryan Singer at the helm, the third film ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" would feature a new director. For the third entry in the series, director Brett Ratner (""Red Dragon"") took over for Bryan Singer, who left the series to direct ""Superman Returns"". The decision to have Brett Ratner at the helm of such a high profile movie that was to serve as the supposed final chapter in the popular superhero trilogy, caused many a fan to become uneasy. This was caused in part by the fact that Ratner had at one point been picked by Warner Brothers to direct the newest `Superman' movie; however, before much progress could be made he dropped out of the film. So, with a new director onboard that had little to no obvious experience in dealing with elaborate visual effects (not to mention the fact that he couldn't handle one hero let alone a team), and the success of a franchise on the line, one question remained. ""Could this latest chapter in the `X-Men' series hope to succeed when it seemed that so many factors were working against it?""

""X-Men: The Last Stand"" begins with the creation of a new `cure' for the mutant gene, allowing those born with powers to choose whether they wanted to remain mutants or take the cure and become normal human beings. This `cure' quickly becomes the focus for the mutant race, and serves as the potential catalyst to spark an all-out war that has been brewing between Magneto's (Sir Ian McKellan) `Brotherhood of Mutants' and Professor Charles Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) X-Men. With mutantkind divided as to which side to choose, the battle lines are quickly being drawn, and the final battle is about to begin!

Screenwriter Zak Penn (""xXx: State of the Union""), taking over for departing writers Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris (who also jumped ship to work on ""Superman Returns""), chose wisely (in my opinion) to not focus on a story dealing solely with the `cure' for mutants. Granted the cure story arc was interesting and provided some very captivating moments between key characters as some felt the cure was a blessing, while others felt it was just another way for humans to oppress the mutants even further. With that being said, I don't feel that this storyline would have been able to sustain the film throughout its entire duration. With that in mind I feel confident in stating that the film greatly benefited from the intermixing of the incredibly popular Phoenix story arc from the comic books. The Phoenix plotline, just as it did in the comics, provided some very intense moments within the story, along with numerous opportunities for the characters to explore how they feel about Jean's miraculous resurrection and her newly unleashed awesome power. This proved especially true for Hugh Jackman's character Wolverine, as he now finds the woman he loves may be a threat to everything else he holds dear.

Many detractors of this film felt that the movie lacked in substance, and that the film would have been better served had it focused solely on Jean Grey becoming the Phoenix. I agree that the film probably would have been even better had it dealt even more, if not solely on Jean's manifestation into the Phoenix. However I must disagree with the first sentiment about the lack of substance. This film was the final act (or at least it appears to be) in a trilogy, meaning that in some way it ties into events that occurred in the previous two films. Therefore, this film is intended more as a means of tying up any and all remaining loose ends left over from its predecessors, while at the same time expanding somewhat on what had been laid out prior to this entry. In the case of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"", the film's story was focused on exploring what happened to Jean in the closing moments of ""X2"", unleashing the war that had been brewing between the two opposing sides of the mutant race, and introducing us to the concept of a cure for mutants. If you ask me, those three aspects of the story provided plenty of substance for this film to draw from, and it did so in a satisfying way that didn't come off as overly bloated and complicated like some third film's in a trilogy have of late (for example, ""The Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"").

The cast, as they have been in the previous installments, was still as great as ever; except for a couple of exceptions. Actresses Halle Berry and Anna Paquin appeared to struggle with their characters for some reason in this film. Both of their performances varied between good to being just flat and disinterested in nature. I will say that aside from her performance in ""X2"", Halle has been inconsistent with her interpretation of the X-Man known as Storm; however, by this point one would have hoped that she would have figured the character out by now. As for Anna Paquin, I don't really know what the problem was; perhaps it was her character's arc in this film and her insecurity about being a mutant becoming more apparent given the newly discovered cure. Whatever the case may be, she clearly struggled to find a groove in her surprisingly small amount of screen time, given that the character was much more involved in the previous two films, and in the end she delivered what could possibly be classified as the most uninspired performance in the film. Like I said, aside from these two, the remainder of the returning cast members continued to deliver solid performances, even when relegated to little more than a cameo appearance (I'm referring to James Marsden's character Cyclops).

Joining the returning members, the film featured several newcomers to the series, such as Kelsey Grammer (Beast), Vinnie Jones (Juggernaut) and Ben Foster (Angel), all of whom fit right in, as if they'd been members of the cast since the very first movie. Now, I for one never would have picked Kelsey Grammer (TV's ""Fraiser"") to embody the X-Man known as the Beast. Sure he could handle the intellectual dialogue and would sound genuine in doing so, but I wouldn't have thought of him as being all that physical of an actor. However, there he was in some of the fight sequences right in there with the other X-Men, and holding his own without any trouble at all. It's just one more example of how some of the casting choices in Hollywood never cease to amaze me in how spot on they are, despite all appearances to the contrary. Next we have soccer player turned actor Vinnie Jones (""Gone in 60 Seconds"") offering up his portrayal of the powerhouse mutant known as Juggernaut. Juggernaut pretty much did in this film exactly what the character is known for in the comics, essentially decimate anything and everything in his path. The only major difference between the two mediums is that there was no mention ever made to the character being the half-brother to Charles Xavier. Aside from that Vinnie's performance was as good as expected for an actor playing a character that isn't known for being all that much of a thinker or having any real depth to him.

Last but not least, we have actor Ben Foster as the mutant known as Warren Worthington III, a.k.a. Angel. The only thing you can say about Ben, other than the fact that he pretty much knocks every performance out of the park, is that he is a true chameleon when it comes to his appearance and presentation from role to role. In one movie he'll have long black hair and an extremely bad attitude (""Hostage""), then he'll have scraggly red hair, a plethora of piercings, and a heart of gold (""The Punisher""), or he will be a clean cut, blonde heir to a massive fortune as he is in this film. It's amazing to me to see just how diverse Ben has proven to be in various movies, and each performance is always unique from the one before it. This is one actor who I believe will go down as one of the best and most talented of his generation.

The action scenes in this film are the most intense out of all the `X-Men' movies. Everything is so exciting and fast-paced that you feel like you have to see the movie more than once to fully take it all in. Going hand-in-hand with the action, the special effects work is also the best out of the franchise. Not that the visuals in the first two movies were anything to look down upon. In this film there is one sequence alone, involving the Golden Gate Bridge, that is worth the price of purchasing this movie.

""X-Men: The Last Stand"" isn't a perfect movie by any means; however, it completely ties up all loose ends while still delivering to us a pulse-pounding battle that had been teased at for the last two films. Despite all the bad press this film has received among some fans, critics and so on, I personally found this installment to be just as entertaining as the first film, and a fitting end to the series.

After re-watching X2:X-Men United, I felt compelled to re-watch ""The Last Stand,"" since I only saw it once, in its theatrical run. I did not like the movie too much the first time through, and you can only see a movie for the first time once, so it left a sour feeling in my mind. Well, I bought the movie on Blu-Ray, and I gotta say... the feeling is still there, it's just a little better. The movie picks up right after X2 ended, with Cyclops still grieving over the death of Jean-Grey, Logan is still the smart-aleck ""substitute"" teacher, and Professor X is having these mental issues that lead back to a little girl from 20 years ago. To say that Bryan Singer is missed is an under statement, for a lot of the issues and themes from the old films don't resonate as much. The acting is still good, but what really hit some of those sour notes were the liberties they took with the characters. As a fan of the old animated series and some of the later comic books, it was rather dissapointing to see some of the characters go, and some to not come back at all.(Nightcrawler, anyone?) Another one of my issues was how the closure was handled. To, me it was flat and lifeless. For example, when Pyro and Iceman had their duel, Iceman headbutts Pyro and that is it. You don't see anymore of his character. Closure like this makes me feel unhappy, at least compared to the prior films. Also, what was up with the mutant that was the cure? Other than that plot device, he had no other role in the film. He could've been substituted by a cow, and it wouldn't have made a difference. The action was great, and the special effects snazzy, but overall, it was an average flick. Oh, well. Here's hoping ""Origins"" hits the right spots.
The Blu-Ray:
No complains here. The video is definitely top notch. It's very minimally grainy, though its natural, retaining the film look and feel. Colors are spot-on, contrast is never blown out (though a little too bright during the white room scenes with the ""cure"" mutant) and blacks are deep. Great video!
The audio is also a heart-stopper. The DTS HD Mix on this disc is a heavy-hitter, with some deep, low bass and great directionality, never having any issues with dialogue. This is a truly worthy mix. Great demo material indeed!
So, I give it a four star rating instead of a three because of the great production values of the Disc. Otherwise, the film stays at a three out of five.",1241136000,3,2431,4.452914798206278

I actually own them on standard DVD, so I recently saw XMen-The Last Stand on blu-ray on an 1080p TV and I can tell you that blu-ray in 1080p will enhance tiny flaws and make them obvious.  I notice this with other movies of this type (F4RSS - Fantasic Four Rise...) and the digital effects are so noticeable that they look fake.  In the XMen, when Magneto moves the golden gate bridge it didn't look convincing.  The actors look like actors on a stage and the bridge look fake, the cars sliding on the bridge looks as if they were being pulled by wires and I think I know why.  Because the scene looks so clean that it didn't look like it was actually taking place outside, but rather inside of a computer.  Now don't get me wrong, I love blu-ray and it works great for some films, but in this movie, things look so disconnected.  Now on the otherhand when I reduced the resolution to 1080i, it looked remarkably more real.  But at 1080p on a 50"" plasma, 47"" LCD and a 65"" plasma, it looks like XMEN the Play instead of Xmen the movie.  Xmen series is a good series and I would still recommend you buy it on blu-ray if you enjoy the series, its just that I wanted to talk about the higher resolution issue that, for me at least, seem to crop up with movies that has a lot of CGI shots.",1237248000,3,1435,4.111111111111111
7681868,3,B01CE00Q5C,"I love the X-Men. I was a fan of the comics back when I was a kid, so I have an enourmous emphaty for the characters. Altough I've long been over my early younger days infatuation with superheroes the x-men and Batman universe still ""call out"" to me, so every time there is a movie or even television series based on both these universes i allways take a peek. Usually I end up dissapointed (aside from BATMAN TAS, Wolverine and The x-men The second Noland BAtman movie and the first two X-Men and Hellboys, there really aren't many sucessfull adaptations of superhero universes onto moving picture), so I have learned to lower my expectations considerably.
X3 is not that bad. It's fun enough to watch and the action is allright. It has it's gripping moments and the actors where well casted. I adctually enjoyed it. But for a comics purist this movie will be maddening and insulting... Hell, I'm not one but I feel there were alot of choices that were pretty exagerated and that kinda got in my nerves. For example,  I remenber the phoenix saga and this has little to do with it. Also the death of all those X-Men was idiotic and unnecessary. Juggernaut has nothing to do with the comics nor he has any relation with Xavier, etc, etc. It's a shame because the first two movies were pretty faithfull to the source carachterswise. For a comics purist this will be a maddenning film...
But If your not a purist and you set your standarts a little low it's fun enough. It's not that terrible. Besides, as enjoyable as the first two X-men movies were, they weren't THAT amazing to begin with...",1236729600,,1591,4.562937062937063

But this was disappointing. It was the perfect example of Hollywood taking a perfectly good series and crapping on it because they want to rush through a summer blockbuster. They changed the director. They changed the head writer. You got to ask yourself why the hell would they do that? I mean the writer was the writer for American Pie for god sakes. The answer was that the director was doing Superman Returns and wanted to finish it before moving on to the next project. The studio told him to stick it, they didn't want to wait, so they pushed a new director through. The movie was a Hollywood wet dream of Fan Boy pandering, explosions, little acting and story, and even a tribute to the famous Juggernaut Youtube video. For those of you who said it wasn't the first two movies but it was still fun, just imagine what it could have been.

7681873,3,B01CE00Q5C,"The first two X-Men movies were short but really great. The Last Stand unfortunately doesn't live up to the other two, but it's worth watching for those who want to see how it ends. (SPOILER WARNING) It's a pretty good movie but the whole story is based off of shaky foundations and very far-fetched ideas. Jean comes back from the dead because apparently her powers formed a cocoon of some sort. She kills  Cyclops and Xavier (sad moment) and is then convinced my Magneto to help him take over the world. She was DEAD! And now we're supposed to believe her powers are the most dangerous of any ever discovered? Uh... ok.

To keep it simple, The Last Stand mainly suffers from an 'out there' storyline. Otherwise the movie is good with spectacular special effects, an excellent music score, and some more great acting. If you liked the first two films you should watch this, if not then don't bother, because you'll only like it less.",1229299200,2,934,4.620481927710843
7681884,4,B01CE00Q5C,"The third act of this tragedy or drama is this time bringing the fight within the mutant community. The President of the USA, with his Secretary to Mutant Affairs who is not even informed, let alone associated, to the President's decisions on such a matter, has paid for the invention or devising of a special genetic vaccine to ""cure"" the mutants of their mutant-ness. This gives the opportunity to the bad mutants to gather some groups and even crowds and to start some terrorist action against this cure in the name that mutant-ness is not a disease. The final battle in order to destroy the research center that devised the ""cure"" and the scientist who is behind the discovery is spectacular with a bridge rotated in order to tie up San Francisco to Alcatraz by way of the Golden Gate Bridge. This time the battle will bring the bad mutants down once and for all. The leader of them, a certain Magneto, will be injected four doses of the ""cure"", the winged son of the President of the USA will save the scientist, and Wolverine, the man with metal bones and claws on his hands will get rid of the too famous Jean who had gone wild and evil after her resurrection from the water catastrophe in the previous film. Then peace and safety are finally assured and men and mutants can live happily together thereafter and have many children. Such films are definitely naive as for the meaning but they are saved by the special effects and are entertaining after all. We could of course compare this trilogy with the Aliens first three films, or with the Terminator trilogy, or the two Star Wars trilogies. We would always find somewhere the belief that the future is not so grim as it may look and that good will always get over evil. Then the differences are in the surviving or winning models. From the Genesis or Ragnarok model of Terminator, to the bi-partisan peace of this X-Men trilogy, to the never ending resurrection of the Aliens in the Aliens series, to the democratic victory of the two Star Wars trilogies, we can write volumes on the persistence and return of such ideological, supposedly religious or philosophical models, but the best novel ever written on that subject remains Stephen King's The Stand.

7681889,4,B01CE00Q5C,"First of all, I think this is a movie you have to watch two or three times to actually appreciate, since a lot of your experience the first time you watch it is ""BANG! BOOM! CRASH!"" In other words, this is an ACTION movie first and foremost, which means there isn't a lot of character development to speak of. Well, except for two specific characters. But I'll get to that in a minute.

Now for what I LIKED about X3:
-As screwed up as this version of Phoenix is, the Phoenix is my favorite X-Men villain, and I like the way it's been turned into an alternate personality of Jean's - it works, for the film. My personal favorite parts  were seeing her pupils dilate so much that her eyes were completely black (just an AWESOME touch, as far as I'm concerned) and the way you could kind of see a firey outline around her hair when she was backlit - it's probably an accident, but I like the subtle touch that only a diehard geek would get.
-I really enjoy Shadowcat's character. In my first viewing I had no idea who she was, but then I found out more about her and now she's one of my favorite characters. Ellen Page played this version of her with a great mix of snarkiness and sensitivity.
-Angel and Beast. Just seeing them onscreen, even with virtually no backstory, is cool.
-Iceman iced up, an iconic moment. Let's hope in any future X-Men movies he'll do it again.
-The Pyro vs. Iceman fight is a great bit, particularly since Iceman wins. (I've never been a big fan of Pyro, especially movie-Pyro, although I'll concede Aaron Stanford did a great job with the character.)
-The big battle at the end is really great, visually.
-FASTBALL SPECIAL. Even though it didn't look quite right since Hugh Jackman is too tall. But still, `nuff said.
-The Danger Room is just cool-looking. And I loved the wink-wink-nudge-nudge reference to the Days of Future Past storyline.
-About the only part that I liked of the Scott-Jean scene was when Jean held back Scott's optic blasts with her telekinesis. Another iconic moment from the comics, though naturally twisted to suit movie purposes.

And what I DIDN'T like:
-Storm's hair. I really don't get what they thought they were doing there. I mean, Storm doesn't have SHORT hair. She had a mohawk back in the 80's, but it's not the same thing.
-I don't appreciate Kitty being shoved aside to be used mostly as the third part of a stupid love triangle that was basically pointless.
-Colossus kind of didn't do anything except punch people and lug a big-screen TV around. He had more lines in X2, for crying out loud!
-The Logan/Jean ""romance"" is played up WAY too much. I speak as a fan who hates that particular pairing, since I'm more of a traditionalist (IE Scott/Jean), but honestly. Watching them suck face in the medical ward is just awkward.
-Mystique, who's never been my favorite but is a fascinating character, got depowered. Honestly, what was wrong with the screenwriters? They've just lost the appeal of half their male audience!
...being serious now, I think they'll have a hard time doing X4 and beyond without Mystique in Magneto's group. And I was nursing a secret hope they'd do a reveal to Nightcrawler about who his mother REALLY is...
-Lack of character development. Essentially, all we know about Beast is that he's blue and a government official. Not a good start, if you ask me. Angel is a little better, with the opening scene showing him as a young child trying to remove his wings before his disapproving father discovers them, but still lacking in dimension. And there's NO hint of Shadowcat's genius-level intelligence, other than a short conversation she has with Professor Xavier in the classroom early on, and you wouldn't pick that up unless you were looking for it.

And what I absolutely HATED:
-Jean's killing Scott. Why is this necessary? IT ISN'T. Now, I speak as a biased fan of Cyclops, even movie-Cyclops, who is less than stellar as far as his role goes. But this 15-minute role just makes me very angry. I understand James Marsden had little time to devote to this movie on account of filming Superman Returns simultaneously, but honestly, killing off the supposed leader of the X-Men in the first half-hour is just not something you do. I wish, at least, they'd had some sort of memorial for him, even a small MENTION of him during the Professor's funeral. But no. He just disappears from everyone's minds. This is an example of bad storytelling, children. I mean, what did the Phoenix do, EAT him??
-Jean's killing the Professor. Now, I know he's not *really* dead, but I thought it was almost as stupid as killing off Scott. Honestly, in this movie THREE of the original X-Men characters, from the original team, are killed off. THREE. This, in my opinion, is inexcusable. And I don't just say that because the funeral makes me bawl like a baby every time I watch this movie either.
-Rogue's dismissal from the script. No, seriously, they gave her about 15 lines, I think. Being the character who interested me in these stories in the first place, I'm extremely irritated that she got so little screentime. And THEN she got depowered. This angers me so much that I refuse to watch the original ending, where she returns depowered, and instead opt for the deleted scene where she still has her power. I understand where the writers and director were coming from with their decision to have her take the Cure - after all, she's essentially isolated from all physical contact - but I think it was one of the stupidest moves they could have made. How will they justify her staying at the Institute in future movies if she's powerless? Or will they just have the Cure stop working, like it appeared to with Magneto in the end, which will render her choice meaningless? Or will they just kick her out and have her leave, making it less likely that some fans will go see the movies because she's not in them? (I admit, I'll be one of those fans.) There is a very simple, temporary solution to Rogue's powers: LEECH. One of the producers talks about a scene that possibly would've been included in the movie had they chosen to have Rogue keep her powers, in which we see Rogue return and kiss Bobby, and then reveal Leech sitting outside the door with a Gameboy. I think this would've been a much better way of solving Rogue's problem while still keeping her powers for combat situations. But, no, apparently a depowered Rogue is a good Rogue.
-The explanation for the lack of character development: this became ""The Wolverine and Jean Show"" (as opposed to ""The Wolverine and Rogue Show"" that was the first two movies). Roughly 85% of the screentime was devoted to Wolverine, and Jean, or Wolverine AND Jean, which annoyed me. The title is X-MEN, not LOGAN AND JEAN. Meaning the movies are supposed to be about a GROUP. But, no, they decided to focus on those two instead and move everybody else to the backburner.

Overall, I watch this movie for the excellent special effects and action sequences, but I can't recommend it to a diehard fan of the comics on basis of the deaths of three pivotal characters (as well as two others being depowered) and lack of character development. But it's a great wiz-bang action flick, if you like that sort of thing. I really think they  should've just filmed Chris Claremont's novelization of X3 instead, because it would've been about 10 times better.

One more thing: Stick around for the end of the credits. You might see something important.",1217462400,8,7464,4.654283548142533
7681890,5,B01CE00Q5C,"X-men 3 was plagued with obstacles during its making: several director switches, ridiculous time restraints, etc. But it truly shows how amazing X-men is that, despite all of the troubles to get it made, it is a FANTASTIC movie. It is very emotional and exciting. It is actually geared toward the GENERAL movie population, and much less toward comic followers. Comic followers will love it too if they just keep an open mind. The only problems with the movie are that #1 it is too short, and doesn't give the audience much time to rest after significant events, and #2 there a few missed opportunities for developing characters. However- #1 results in the movie being better for repeated viewings. The movie is better the second time, because u are able to soak in everything AS it happens instead of lingering on surprises. And #2 is only a problem for the fans, as everyone else will know only what they see, which is gREAT.

They got one of the biggest hack directors in Hollywood, Brett Ratner to finish off what could have been a stellar trilogy.  Instead, we got a crappy ""reinterpretation"" of one of the best X-Men stories of all time, the dark Phoenix saga.  Ratner strips this storyline of all emotion, even stripping Jean Grey/Phoenix of her fire powers (uh, isn't that the point of the entire character?)  The last shot of X2 was of the Phoenix's fire emblem in the lake, which is completely abandoned in this travesty.  The other two sticking points of this hack script are the off-screen death of Scott Summers/Cyclops WTF? and the death of Professor Xavier, the mainstay of this entire franchise.  I sincerely hope the Wolverine and Magneto movies return some semblance of dignity to this franchise, which was Marvel's strongest, after what this asinine director did to this film.",1215129600,9,997,4.8698224852071
7681895,5,B01CE00Q5C,"This movie had a lot of everything, and I loved it. I hope it's not really their Last Stand.

Briefly, we dealt with Death and Resurrection, concerning Jean Grey (Phoenix), Cyclops & Professor X.

We see some early insights into the power of Jean Grey. We see more insights into the romantic tensions between Jean Grey and Wolverine.

A good element of the story is the invention of a ""cure"" for the mutants. They will allegedly be allowed to choose whether or not they want the cure. But you just have to know the government is likely to take that choice away.

Magneto gathers his Evil Mutants to fight the ""normal"" people who have created the cure. This involves moving the Golden Gate bridge to allow them to move to Alcatraz Island.

Some of my favorite X-men return in this movie, and many new ones are introduced. One of my favorites is Kelsey Grammar (Frazer) as the Beast. It is such a great match.

The biggest problem with this movie is the abundance of characters, in the X-men and the Evil Mutants. So many characters get only a few moments to shine.

Again, I think this is a result of a valiant effort to cover the wide range of characters and changes over the past 40+ years of the X-men's history.

Yes, they have amazing powers, but the movies worked best when they treated the use of those powers as just routine. Ice Man blowing on Wolverine's soda to chill it. Magneto simulating the kinetic ball toy on his desktop. These things were done with hardly any fanfare. But it's a far cry from this movie where, every single time Storm decides to use her power, they do a zoom-in to her eyes to remind you they turn white when she exerts herself.

We know they're mutants. We know they're super-human. We need to also feel they're human. If the audience can't connect with the heroes, there's no point.

I thought the original X-Men movie was a decent, big budget ""B-Movie"". The second film was a typical sequel, and ended up being a step down from the original. This third installment is both poorly written and poorly directed. It's a simple ""by the numbers"" sequel that leaves a LOT to be desired. If all you're looking for is CGI effects, then maybe you'll enjoy this mess.

Don't expect to actually care about ANY of the characters in this film, because the script writers obviously didn't. It seems they were too busy thinking up mindless battle scenes. Also, whatever you do, don't actually THINK about the ""powers"" that some of the characters possess, or you'd soon realize that if they actually USED them, most of the action scenes wouldn't even last a few minutes.

I actually collected X-Men comics back in the late 70's and early 80's, and I can tell you that there was more character depth in the pages of each one those thin comics than in this entire film!

7681915,2,B01CE00Q5C,"In defense of Director Brett Ratner, he did the best he could under the time constraints for this film and the fact that Singer abandoned his ""child"" to direct Superman Returns. Writers Kinberg and Penn are seasoned pros, but both came into the film after Singer left and took the original screenwriters, Harris and Dougherty with him to Superman. Basically, they started with nothing and were able to create something just above nothing. Its the same old tired out storyline of good mutants versus evil mutants with a little bit of modern day political agenda thrown in for good measure.

It is not just the poor screenplay that ruins the film. Unfortunately, The Last Stand lacks the acting necessary to carry what is supposed to be one of the most tear-jerking, intense narratives in the X-Men comics, The Dark Phoenix Saga. Typical of comic book films lately, do not expect to find the original story arc in this movie. The dialogue between our heroes is tedious, a slap in the face to readers who know that Marvel Comics have always been cerebral in nature. The special effects are not up to par and even the actor chosen for the minor role of President was horrible. (Cotter Smith where were you?) This film was a huge disappointment and an embarrassment to the X-Men franchise.

There were major faux pas and incongruities in this film. Beware! If you have not seen the film, there are spoilers ahead. Stop reading now and know that if you are a fan of the X-Men series you will be very dissatisfied. Stick with the first two and pretend this film was never put to celluloid.

In an opening scene, we see Professor X walk to the Grey's door. Prof. X was paralyzed before he started the School for the Gifted and so would have been in his wheelchair at this point. Instead of using clever dialogue to establish that we are in the past, the writers and director chose to cop out and remove a prop that should have been present if they had back checked their facts.

The Phoenix kills Scott in the first twenty minutes of the movie. While the Phoenix side of Jean might not get along with Scott, she never would have outright killed him. Not only is this anti-climatic, but clearly, the only reason for his death was that the actor (Marsden) had other obligations i.e.: Superman Returns.

Where was the Phoenix? Jean looks more like a goth girl gone wrong rather than the fiery entity of the Phoenix. We never get to see her rise from the ashes in a blazing inferno. Singer had clearly laid the groundwork in the second movie; her eyes had fire in the them and at the end of the film, we saw the Phoenix fly across the lake. That idea was obviously trashed when the new director took over.

The scenes involving Wolverine and Storm debating/arguing are forced and tiresome. It seems as though the director gave up on accents in this film as Ororo went from having a strained Kenyan accent in the first movie to none at all by the third. Of course, it may be that Ms. Berry had difficulty acting her part or was asked to stop attempting the accent.

The entire middle of the film was unnecessary. There were too many scenes of Magneto rousing the troops, too many cut scenes to the forest (yes we get it, he is in the woods!) too much of the President babbling ""God Help Us"" or gathering the troops. Where were the scenes of Jean/Phoenix struggling with the fact that she had just killed her lover/husband and her mentor/father figure?

Why bother introducing characters like Callisto, Psylocke, Spike (who are not mentioned by name) and Archlight if only to kill them off unceremoniously at the end of the film?
Why kill off Jean - again.

One creative point of the movie was Jean's split personality disorder creating the Phoenix rather than an alien entity. It would have been more poignant, however, if Jean had lived, having to face that she had killed the people she loved most in life. There is no real justice or even remotely successful conclusion to this film.",1198022400,6,3973,4.584507042253521

While a technically very stunning film, it suffers from a bit of plot weakness. Juggling tying up themes from the previous two X-Men movies with showing more of the comics' mutants ""neglected"" previously, it tries to do too much -- but it does the individual parts very well. The scenes are well-crafted and the special effects are marvelous, but the story as a whole seemed rather half-hearted.
Other reviewers have mentioned the sub-par acting of some of the lead actors, but I found many of the supporting actors put in very good performances.  It's hard to find any fault with the special effects, unless it's (almost) overkill: they threaten to overshadow what good plotline there is. Not that there is no good use of plotlines here: the final confrontation of Wolverine and Magneto was a brilliant take on the theme of their previous movie encounters; there are just too few of such gems.
Of the three X-Men movies, this is the primary ""action"" one and is least able to stand on its own; the first was necessarily more ""plot"" oriented, while the second was probably the most ""balanced"" (and my personal favorite of the three, by a hair over the first). Do watch (or skip through) to the end of the credits to see the teaser that adds additional opportunity for a sequel, but X-Men - The Last Stand, while not bad, does not really leave me craving the next installment.",1189987200,,1642,4.681660899653979

7681925,3,B01CE00Q5C,"Its been four/five years since X2 - X-MEN UNITED was released in theaters and was hailed by audiences everywhere (negative or positive). To be frank a lot happened in the span of four years ---Bryan Singer ditching the ""X"" production for ""Superman"" among other things--- and X-MEN: The last stand really shows what four years without the headmaster and an excellent writing team can do to an over-popular movie franchise that seemed to work even when a lot CBM's didn't. For some reason the characters, the storyline and the movie itself seemed to suffer from its own ego and poor writing. For starters, Brent Ratner did not do a horrible job as far as directing movies go. However, if you gonna blame someone (beyond Ratner) then blame the producers, the scenario, and screenplay writers. Storyline based on Joss Whedon's ""Mutant Cure"" storyline in ""ASTONISHING X-MEN"" and the ever-famous DARK PHOENIX saga reveals that LAST STAND had potential enough to become third greatest movie of the X-MEN series but falls flat because of lack of depth in the characters and the introduction of way too many NEW characters to merit something wonderful. THE LAST STAND was like watching a big-budget show and tell at school: The mutants would show up on screen, flaunt their gifts in their fifteen minutes of fame, then become a distant memory or in this case an extra actor.

I was expecting the flashback concerning Magneto and Professor X going to the Grey household to recruit Jean Grey to be interesting or at least impressive. It was none of the above. While the ""DE-Aging"" CGI they used on Stewart and McKellen was impressive the scene felt like it was directed and acted out in a campy kind of way. There was not a serious atmosphere about it in short. The storyline from there feels like it wants to become something. Especially when they use about half the movie's hour talking and planning things. Another thing that irked me was that the movie had the humans announcing they, or rather Angel's father, had created a permanent cure for the mutant 'disease' -- with the use of a mutant child named Leech (Camron Bright)-- instead of the diplomatically immune alien Ord [""The terrible""?] who originally brought the means of the cure to the female Dr. Kavita Rao. In truth, it suffers from the same problem BLADE: TRINITY suffered from. The introduction of new characters, the misuse of the focal character, and weak storyline. Only that movie managed to merit something as memorable opposed to LAST STAND. The storyline in XM:TLS was not fleshed out as well as the previous movies storylines were. The fact that there were far too many subplots attached to many of the new (good and bad) or old characters that were never dwelled on was a bloody shame. And the ending, to me, was just too ""Happily Ever After,"" and unsurprisingly unfinal.

Tweaking of the previous characters such as Storm, Rogue, Bobby, Wolverine, Jean, Magneto, and Pryo was a positive and negative. The simple fact that Halle Berry was given something more to do in this film besides look pretty and let the FX do the all the work was major hit with me. If anything she was the true spectacle of the entire film; She acted like the leader she was potrayed as in the comics and her action sequences were the best! Even Halle's acting felt like it got better for some particular reason. I was disappointed with her fight scenes with Callisto. All Callisto seemed to do her was run circles around her then knee Storm in the stomach in both their fights. Plus the camera was in too close on the actresses in some scenes. The disappearance of Rogue's character was an all round disappointment to me: She was literally shoved aside to give the 3d actress for Kitty Pryde for screen time; Even the chemistry between Anna Paquin and Hugh Jackman was missing in their short moment on-screen together. This was the movie I was really hoping -- like they did with Storm -- would do something with the timid Southern Belle who was the focal point of the first movie. Alas it was not to be. Pryo's character wasn't shown nor did it change much from the second movie. As far as being Magneto's right hand man and rival to Ice-man he did nothing except show off his funky near bleach-blond hair style and fire mechanisms on his wrists.

Jean Grey was never my favorite character to begin with, though it may be simply because people place her character on such a high mantle of glory, but Famke Jansen's performance was good as the Dark Phoenix. I was both happy and unmoved by the change of personality for this so-focused on female lead. Her darker persona fit her characterism a lot better her good-guy persona did. However, the disappointments I had with her character is that she barely showed remorse for ""killing"" Cyclops, and Xavier. Her DARK PHOENIX persona lacked whatever sinister-like qualities that made her so cool in the comics. Wolverine and Magneto were probably the biggest disappointments for me in LAST STAND: Wolverine's character went from ""loner/father figure (X-Men)"" - ""demi-gallant (X2)"" - to ""Puppy-dog looking to move in on Cyclops' vacant spot"" in the LAST STAND. While they stayed true to his obsession for Jean Grey, Wolverine seemed so far removed from his original character from the previous films that I almost thought I was looking at another person altogether.

Sure he still retained the same quirks that made him Wolverine, but he just lacked that certain something that made him so cool to me in the movies. Magneto's character went from cunningly smart to stupidly reckless and absentminded in the span of four years. His character seemed to rush into things and ditch members of his brotherhood quicker than a man could yodel in the mountains. Even his decisions on how to deal with the humans and their cure seemed absurd and unlogical. Ian McKellen's acting seemed way off in the movie; He was very un-Magneto. Lastly, Iceman was more or less a simple unexplored plot-device for the untouched Rogue/Bobby/Shadowcat triangle. He was also among the non-liked characters on my list and his characterization in the movie just gave me more of a reason to dislike him. To be frank I favored the first Actress they used for Shadowcat, Sumela Kay, as opposed to the second actress, Katie Stuart, and Ellen Page. Page just did not have the acting abilities to make Kitty something of a memorable character like Anna Paquin did for Rogue. If anything she made her unbearingly annoying with her less than average performance. Other characters like Beast (Grammar) and Colossus are instant likeables. My only problem with both characters was that Beast was made a diplomat and not a scientist and Colossus was not focused on much as a main character.

The axing of most veteran characters for the barely touched upon new characters was also a problem. While he was never my favorite character to begin with, shunting Cyclops was probably the second biggest mistake the film made just so it could focus on the ""Wolverine x Jean"" attraction. I read GIFTED and watched the PHOENIX/DARK PHOENIX arc in the animated series and it didn't dawn on me until the end of the movie what they really could've done with his character. Among other things, it was that dynamic in Cyclops' and Jean's relationship that made the PHOENIX/DARK PHOENIX saga compelling. And he is the leader after all, but the films demoted him to less than a background character. Alas, I really blame SUPERMAN RETURNS for the lack of Cyclops in the movie. Seriously, what is James Marsden gonna do?: Get shunted again by his lady-friend (Lois) for Superman? The de-mutanizing of Mystique was horrible: The coolest female character in the franchise and they axed her with a fate she considers whose than death. It was like they really wanted to focus more on Callisto as Magneto's right hand woman and rid us of Rebecca Stamos' character. Which also begs to the questions: How did the Government catch Mystique in the first place if she was masqurading as Senator Kelly? There wasn't even a mention of her capture on the news in the movie. The death of Professor Xavier, while emotionally moving, was kind of a disaster waiting to happen. It was as though the screenplay writers could not think of what to do with his character and simply decided to kill him off for some short lived arbitrary drama. Which sucked, Patrick Stewart was the probably the best actor in the entire movie.

Now as for the subject of acting?: Most of the originally actors seem to put the same heart they used in the previous two films, even the ones that were wrongfully axed. But as this very short movie progresses you begin to notice the newcomers and other previous actors are lacking in serious atmosphere and talent. But most notably Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen were the weakest of the originals. They hardly seemed to take their roles seriously and thus were far too campy. Famke Jennsen was all right playing her darker persona Phoenix, but when it came to her ""emotional"" scenes with Jackman they lacked a serious something that would've made these scenes spark. Grammar as beast is another actor that did surprisingly well in his role as the DIPLOMAT Hank McCoy/Best. Even the sillest lines he made his own and convincing enough to sound like something The Beast would say. The CGI in the film was a hit and miss in most terms of the phrase. Most of the time the CGI looked amazing and somewhat of an improvement over the previous films. Storm's FX was the best out of the entire film. The way they had her performing her attacks or just the simple flying scenes were cool, well thought out. Other times it just looked visibly horrible and unfinished in a lot of the scenes. Most notably when Jean was lifting her house from the ground, Multiple-man (as I dubbed him), when Bobby freezes over (his mouth is not timed well with his words), Juggernaut and Shadowcat were playing tag with each other near the end of the movie, and then Jean's powers shredding everything she focuses on. Another disappointment is that they didn't show the SENTINEL beyond blinding headlights and its head falling to the ground in defeat! A major rip off for fans of this massive robot. The action sequences in the film were something to behold though they were noticeable problems with the wire tricks -- Colossus tossing Wolverine and Beast jumping around pummeling everyone.

All in all they got the adrenaline pumping afterward. The score composed by John Powell was all right; It suited the action-esque atmosphere in the movie but you'll be hard pressed to even bother paying attention to it. Most of the time you'll hear the theme of the movie, maybe an action BGM here and there but the audio of the film itself will drown out the score so it'll be nonexistent to the ears. All in all ""X-MEN THE LAST STAND"" is a half&half kind of movie; A major disappointment from such a highly praised movie series. -------- [3 out of 5]",1184198400,,10949,4.762506582411795

I don't understand how she couldn't have a bigger part, since Cyclops and Professor X die and Jean is a zombie most of the time. That only leaves Wolverine and Storm as the remaining members of the team!
My question has to do with the script. Which came first, the poor script or folks jumping ship, or did a bad script get even worse when key players bolted?
Marsden and Singer ran off to do Superman. Superman was good, but it wasn't great. Since the story is about Dark Phoenix, it would seem that Marsden would have had a bigger role as Cyclops in X-Men than as Lois Lane's fiance. And Singer had done the two previous very successful X-Men movies. Why would he think doing Superman would be better than XMIII? It sounds like both men knew a bad thing when they saw it and ran away as fast as they could.
And what about Patrick Stewart? Did the original story called for Xavier's death, or did Mr. Stewart want to be written out of the story? His death seemed to serve no purpose in the storyline - other than it was easier to show her evil side by killing him off as opposed to having DP destroy star systems as she did in the comic.
Of course the other possibility is that they were setting up the Wolverine movie by doing away with the X-Men......",1182038400,3,1409,4.280898876404494

7681932,3,B01CE00Q5C,"This is supposedly the last in the X-Men series before they go on to more focused films like Magneto and Wolverine. The Last Stand is appreciably different than the two previous installments due primarily to it featuring a different director, and secondarily because they continue to introduce more characters from the series. This does make it markedly more difficult to maintain focus. The original X-Men comic books took years to move through the same story arc. This was evident while viewing this film. The story seemed fractured because there were so many sub-plots. It was almost like there was a bunch of different movies cut and put together. The forays into the characters we forgot we were supposed to care about are forgettable, and could easily have been cut. However, it was an entertaining film throughout with great acting and spectacular effects. The battle scenes were bigger than the last two films because the mutants moved from the underground to do battle out in the open. I really don't know what else to say. Now that I'm actually writing this down, the movie wasn't all that great. It was a lot of fun to watch, but it could have been much better. The effects tried to compensate for the weaknesses elsewhere, but even the giant finale battle was sort of aloof. We were sort of detached from what was actually going on, and I felt it was more of an atmosphere of battle than actual action. I think as a package of three films - the X-Men trilogy - everything would be really cool.

the portrayal of the phoenix, the super-powerful jean grey, was poorly done and could have been so much more. she just sat in the background until the end. the whole premise of the movie was poor too. all they had to do was make apocalypse the main nemesis. he's an alien who was entombed in ancient egypt by the revolting people, kind of like star gate. his mutant powers are far beyond any one mutant. they are like rogue, where he absorbs them from other mutants, but can use the newly acquired powers forever, not just temporarily. that's how i understand apocalypse anyway. the ""cure"" for mutantism was a weak plot. there was no main, solid theme. pieces were just thrown in at random, there was no continuity or flow.

i loved the magneto freeing the imprisoned mutants scene a lot- throwing all those cars around. i liked seeing the wide variety of mutants like shockwave, etc., but still no gambit. it was cool to see storm do a tornado too.

the effects were great, but the plot was weak. it's a shame to end on a bad note. maybe if they get synger back, they can make a cool fourth one; just wait a while until the bad taste leaves everyone's mouth though. they left it open for a fourthquel, with professorX (i don't want to ruin it, but watch the last scene at the end of the credits) and magneto too. there's so many superhero movies now. venom was cool, can't wait for the silver surfer. maybe even ironman? i wonder if they'll play the black sabbath song of the same name during that movie. superheros are cool, everyone loves them. they show how we can become something beyond ourselves and help others. some people do this already in their own way, like a parent or a friend, others just want to be rescued. i used to have super powers when i would drink a lot. one moment i would be in one bar, and then, all of a sudden, i would be teleported to another bar along with some of my friends too. everyone has a little super in them. will you use it for good or for evil?",1181088000,3,2284,4.331775700934579

If he hadn't set Phoenix loose in the first place, none of this would have happened.  Berry's Storm as usual was boring, Rogue, I always thought was a boring mutant.  Honestly, I thought the boy was going to be the answer to curing Phoenix, since no one's powers work around him, but it doesn't seem that answer occured to anyone.  So we bring Gray back just to kill her again.  I love the explanation to how she returned: ""I don't know"".  Alrighty then.  Why not just have her say ""because the screenwriters said so""?

7681957,2,B01CE00Q5C,"X-Men: The Last Stand is the second sequel to X-Men, and unlike the first sequel it falls far short of the original.  I could spend a lot of time getting into why Brett Ratner is as much to blame for the this as Joel Shumacher was for the near fall of the cinematic Batman.  We may very well be one sequel away from a screenplay riddled with puns and fight scenes choreographed like a Broadway show or Disney on ice.  Don't hold me to it...all I'm saying is that this disappointing garbage is a few more steps in that direction.

X3 (because us American's love for our blockbuster movies to have the shortest colloquialisms possible) mimics the Dark Phoenix saga by legendary comic writer Chris Claremont, and it mixes that arc with a newer story I'm not so familiar with. I'm assuming this is where the idea of the mutant cure comes from.  In short, there is a cure available and it might mean the end of mutants, so we might be tempted to ask ourselves some important questions and a better filmmaker like Bryan Singer may have made these questions far more clear and allowed the answers to cut more deeply.  We've developed differently our whole lives, so how much would we really enjoy being like everyone else on Earth?  What does Mystique, a shape-shifter who prefers to walk around blue and scaley as opposed to adjusting her appearance like we know she can, really think of this opportunity?  What about everyone else and how can a director address this with such a large cast?  Ratner is not up to the task of making these observations interesting...he does however know how to direct straight action and make a highly commercial film.  He did his job.

Singer on the other hand brought a tremendous amount of emotion and soul to his films, and he did this without being remotely heavy-handed.  As a bonus he could also deliver straight action, but in his films we actually cared about the characters.  In the second X-Men film we got to see Pyro blast some cops in front of Bobby Drake's house and then we got to see Bobby fly away with the other mutants, but instead of seeing some more explosions and loud jet engines, we see Bobby briefly glance at his family who just betrayed him...and we connect.  Here in X3, I honestly just wanted to see the fire guy fight the ice dude.  I wasn't buying into the characters anymore and the all-too-often clunky dialogue didn't help either.  All the characters that were carried over from the other films are almost just empty shells of themselves from the previous movies, so I felt as if I had to think back to when I gave a damn.

But it's not all bad.  Jean Grey's return from death in X2 as the ultra-powerful mutant Phoenix is fun to watch and the film doesn't pull punches to work toward a definitive end to the series (another reason an additional sequel could be dangerous). I'm not a real fan of the comic, but I'm familiar with it enough to know that hardcore fans have countless concerns for how there favorite characters are portrayed.  It's not a horrible movie in comparison to some movies of it's ilk.  The real disdain for me lies in how X3 betrays the depth of the first two films.",1179878400,7,3150,4.512323943661972

7681960,2,B01CE00Q5C,"this movie is a great example of one of my biggest gripes about sequels.  a sequel will never be as good as the original if the original director doesn't do it himself.  that was the problem with this movie, the original director went off and did superman returns, (which sucked by the way) and another lame director took over this movie.  i believe this movie could have been truly spectacular if more attention was paid to story and character development.

a few of the most important characters were killed off, like Stewart's character Xavier.  and it seems like they simply cheated us by bringing back Jean Grey with only a sentence or two explanation that feigns credibility to the original story. like ""jean grey was always the most powerful mutant ever, we just didn't mention it to you throughtout the first two movies."" a very cheap way to bring her back.  also cyclops was killed of right away, for seemingly no reason other than to get rid of him.  mystique was also given this kind of lousy treatment.  this new director totally screwed up this sequel.

overall the director relyed too much on the special effects (which were pretty good all things considering) and not enough on the characters and an involving storyline.  the thing that made the first two xmen movies so great was because they had a great story and strongly driven characters, and then the special effects were like the icing on the cake.  just like you can't have a good cake with just the icing, you can't expect a movie to be great if the story and characters have no substance.

the second xmen movie should have been the last in my opinion.  the special effects aren't bad, nothing spectacular.  but the story doesn't even compare to the first two's depth and believablilty.  but if you want to finish off you xmen collection, go ahead and buy it.",1179100800,,1834,4.6521739130434785

7681967,5,B01CE00Q5C,"Having avoided it in theatres because of Brett Ratner's involvement (you have to admit, after the lifeless Rush Hour 2 and Red Dragon, what were the odds on Ratner being able to do anything right?), usually the guarantee of lazy paint-by-numbers filmmaking at best, to my very great surprise the much-troubled X-Men: The Last Stand turned out to actually be good - very good - with Ratner for once putting a little effort into proceedings in a film that's far more successful than Bryan Singer's take on Supes and has all the excitement and emotional power that film lacked.

It helps that Singer established the emotional background strongly enough in the first two films for Ratner to be able to just get on with telling a story (I do wonder how well it would work for a newcomer to the franchise with no prior investment in the characters), and there's still a part of me that figures that Singer and Matthew Vaughn spent so long in pre-production before leaving the film that the action sequences were probably fairly comprehensively storyboarded before Ratner came aboard because there's none of his customary just-point-the-camera-in-the-general-direction laziness, but I still have to give Mr I-don't-like-action-it-bores-the-audience credit where credit is due for not screwing it up - the big set-pieces are genuinely impressive, and this is a cracking yarn that rarely lets up. He even gets something like a performance out of Halle Berry, which is more than Singer ever managed. Shame about the terrible CGI make-up effects that make the `younger' Patrick Stewart look like a Final Fantasy character in the prologue though.

Although some found the film a little too short, after looking at the deleted scenes on the DVD, I'm not really sure if it is that possible to extend the movie without going the Spiderman 2.1 route and filming new scenes - most of them are alternate bet-hedging versions of scenes in the film (like the Rogue cured/not cured variations).

But not a disaster by any reckoning. The story is good, the effects better than ever, the characters dynamic. So what's the problem? They simply try to squeeze too much in. There are loads of new characters, all demanding their air time, with the result that there simply isn't enough time for everyone to get a decent crack at things. It would've been far better so cut some of the minor characters to give the leads more time. Plus, some of the editing decisions are VERY questionable. For example, the battle at Jean Grey's house involving Wolverine and Storm... well, in the movie, it looks like they lose it to me. Not what you expect from your heroes. BUT... stick on the extra features and see the extended scene, however, and you get a very different picture. And a far, far superior scene. The finale has some similarly baffling editing.

So, when the action scenes are questionable, and the main characters don't get enough screen time, is it any wonder the movie didn't come up to expectations?

All this said, it's still a great movie. Not a triumph, but a worthy addition to the franchise.",1177718400,,1264,4.714932126696833
7681972,2,B01CE00Q5C,"While the first two installments where lyric in scope, this third one is a true let down.

A hurried, fumbled project, filled to the rim with special effects and action, but as brainless and empty as a tin can.

Patrick Stewart makes his ""disappearance"" bit in here, and perhaps this is the only good thing about it, because it would have been embarrassing for him to have stayed longer.

The other characters are just automatons playing by numbers. Gone are the well developed characterizations of the other two movies.

Is it just because the director wasn't Bryan Singer? Somehow I doubt it. It must have been the script in itself that was probably the cause of such a confused and weak ending.

Pity, because after the second movie, we all waited for a majestic ending, a sort of Clash of the Titans, but something solid, serious and dramatic as well. This instead is just a general and mega-galactic shootout with almost no plot nor true sense of who or what we lost in the process.

In the end, one is almost glad it's all over, but not in the sense the filmmakers probably intended.

No, we are just glad, that this film is over and can get the other two out of their sleeves and make them play for us one more time, the way they were, and in the meanwhile, imagine how the true ending could have been like, if only a talented writer had been hired to do so.

Sorry, but my two stars go for thanking the fact that they probably won't make a sequel out of this one. At least I hope so.

What a pity and what a shame. It had started so well, only to land in the trash-bin.

Not even the honest attempts made by Ian McKellen to bring back the deviousness of Magneto served the purpose, and when such an actor, of his caliber, cannot save a movie of this kind, than there is something very, very wrong with it.

Sorry guys, to disappoint you with my comments, but this is what I truly feel.

The transfer on DVD is well made, both in picture and sound quality and even sports a DTS option, which due to the abismal quality of the movie itself, is no big gift either.

Better stick to ""X-Men"" and ""X2 - X-Men United"", it is money better spent.",1177027200,2,2145,4.3192019950124685
7681983,1,B01CE00Q5C,"I loved the 1st two X-Men movies, and was very excited about the 3rd one. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. Several of my favorite characters were missing or underused (Mystique, NightCrawler, Rogue). Why bring back Jean Grey? Her resurrection added nothing to the storyline IMO. New characters didn't add much either (Angel & Beast). The story could have been interesting with better writing and character development, but I found it mostly boring, needlessly convoluted, and full of loose ends.",1175472000,4,515,5.2926829268292686
7681984,2,B01CE00Q5C,"Why do certain directors think that spending your entire budget on special effects will make an instant hit movie? Or giving in to your star so she gets a bigger role, and still gives an uninspired performance? Rumour has it, Halle Berry was refusing to come back and play Storm, because she didn't have a lot of screen time in the first two movies. So we get more of her, and a lot less of Mystique, who could have had a big storyline, but that was dropped.

Also Cyclops (James Marsden) made the mistake of signing on to be in Superman Returns as well, and his role is greatly reduced, to a couple of scenes, and a gravestone. He gets killed by the love of his life (boy, that must have sucked), and guess what? His death happens off screen.

And what was the sense in bringing back Famke Jansen? She doesn't do much apart from stand around and look menacing, but I suppose being brought back from the dead will do that to anyone. How exactly did she manage to come back? The character is really underdeveloped. She stands around in the background for most of the movie, until she decides to ""annihilate"" something or someone, just for the special effect.

The special effects were alright, trying to make up for what was a serious lack of plot. The special effects used in the beginning of the film, where we see what happens 20 years earlier (which bore no relation to the rest of the film at all), was wasted. They attempted to make Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellen 20 years younger. They amazingly failed on Patrick - he looked no different whatsoever. And Ian was given brown hair. And their faces were obviously edited and smoothed out compared to the other actors in the scene. How much money is thrown at these kinda ageing things per second?

Then there was the obvious referencing other movies. (Or stealing scenes if you prefer.) When the film properly starts, it's nearly a direct steal from the Terminator films. The scene between IceMan and FireGuy towards the end? Did anyone else notice it was the same as the two wands clashing between Harry & Voldemort? Then at the end, it looked very similar to the final scene in Carrie, with Famke as Carrie. The bullet stopping scenes is referencing Matrix Reloaded? Or one of those films.

And the point in Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut is? The guy cannot act. When will people start realising this! The 'fat' suit he was wearing was meant to make him look like a big muscle man, but he ended up looking like a sumo wrestler gone wrong.

Anna Paquin's role as Rogue is greatly reduced, to practically being non-existent. Wasn't she the main part of the first film? Was it worth her time turning up for filming? Did she use her mutant powers once during the film? No.

I was really disappointed in this film, and had to keep pausing it as I couldn't remember what happened in the first two movies. But I remember really liking the first one. But this seemed like CGI/action scene one after the other. And Xavier is killed. I kept expecting him to make another appearance, to come back. Well, if they brought back Famke Jansen ...!!!

Hopefully, this is the last, disappointing finale to the X-Men trilogy. Although, judging by the ending, they're hoping for another. Zzz. Lets hope not! If you're going to name the movie ""The Last Stand"" don't imply that something else is going to happen at the end!

This film should never have been made. If it wasn't for Wolverine, I probably would have given this film less stars. If Mystique had stayed and been given a bigger role, the film would have got more stars. I understand this review had been one big rant. But watch the movie and you'll understand why it should have never been made.

7681987,3,B01CE00Q5C,"I expected the worse case scenario when I heard Brett Ratner was taking the reins of the ""X-Men"" franchise, after Bryan Singer bolted to helm ""Superman Returns"". The end product, for me, isn't bad at all and enjoyable to watch. It's competently directed (Ratner has stated that he wanted to maintain Singer's overall vision and he has done that in terms of look and feel of the film), well-acted, and the action sequences and CGI are very well-done. The score by John Powell is superb, heroic and gives emotional weight to the film (I highly recommend the soundtrack).

But there are some bad sections that takes away from the movie's quality. The script seems rushed (not surprising considering that Fox greenlighted it quickly in order to make the May 26 date) and never scratches the surface of the complex moral and ethical issues presented in the storyline. The script also just tosses away some of the minor characters (such as Mystique and Cyclops) in favor of new ones (as well as giving into Halle Berry's demands for more screentime) without giving them a proper send-off. And lastly, part of the fault lies with the film's length -- sans ending credits -- the film runs just over an hour and a half long. There just isn't enough time to give the main characters depth and the storylines breathing room. Despite those flaws, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is entertaining and worth revisiting, provided your expectations are sufficiently lowered to that of the first film.

The movie is available in three flavors -- single-disc full-screen or anamorphic widescreen editions, a deluxe edition which packages the single-disc widescreen edition with a 100 page comic book and a Blu-ray edition.

The single-disc edition DVD is excellent in terms of transfer quality. The 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer in on par with the previous two films -- spotless, beautiful black levels, rich colors, and wonderfully-film like from start to finish. But the audio is just stupendous and outperforms the first two in demonstration quality. For its DVD release, the audio was mastered by Mi Casa Multimedia (the guys who also mastered the ""Lord of the Rings"" DVDs) in Dolby Digital 5.1 EX and DTS 6.1 ES. Either track will give your surround system a thorough workout, particularly the Danger Room Sequence and the finale at Alcatraz Prison. The track is also subtle and completely immerses the viewer even in the dialogue-driven sequences. Additionally, there are also French and Spanish  stereo dubs (none of the audio tracks cannot be switched on the fly) and optional subtitles in English or Spanish.

The actual extras are a mixed bag. We do get two commentaries like we did for ""X2"", but unfortunately both the director/writer and producer commentaries aren't substantial. We get a few production details but no real dirt on what happened behind the scenes nor any interesting production anecdotes, just congratulatory for the most part. There are also 21 deleted/extended scenes and 3 alternate endings (in anamorphic widescreen with Dolby Digital 5.1 audio) with optional commentary. Those are fun to see, but easy to see why most of them were cut/changed in the first place. We also get the teaser and theatrical trailers for ""X3"" as well as some trailers for other Marvel films, and that's it. Those looking for quality extras along the lines of ""X2"" should wait for the inevitable 2-disc double-dip set.

In a nice touch on the DVD engineers' part, you can skip the trailers and anti-piracy trailer with the menu button and go straight to the menu selection (you can either ""Join the Brotherhood"" or ""Take A Stand""). The menus are animated with 5.1 surround sound, and the movie itself is divided into 24 chapters. The disc is packaged in a regular Amaray keep case with a chapter insert (provided you buy a new copy and not a used one) and a mail-in DVD rebate for this movie and other Fox titles.

If you liked this movie and want to buy it, the current edition out now has a stellar transfer and an okay array of extras. For the die-hard fans, better save the money and wait for the inevitable 2-disc edition (which will probably be released to coincide with the theatrical release of ""Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer"").",1174089600,3,4235,4.898186889818689

In short, this movie had the feel of guys in suits tampering with what they ought not, again.  And it stretched believability beyond a point that James Bond movies wouldn't even cross.  And Bond movies had some very far fetched things.  How hard is it to follow a proven storyline?  Specifically, the one in the comic books.

What are my gripes?  Superheroes and supervillains should never lose their powers.  Key heroes should never die.  In short, Professor X or Cyclops should have never died (even though the movie suggests Professor X didn't really die).  Magneto should never have lost his power.  The Phoenix was relegated to a minor character until the director decided they needed to spend up all of the special effects budget.

I loved the first two X-men movies and this one was even better. I do agree with most of the reviews that they've not developed storylines that they've alluded to in the beginning, in particular Rogue, Iceman and Kitty, I'm kind of glad they didn't bother to go there, and make it some love triangle pack of stupidity. But I do agree Cyclops was just killed off and that was the end of it. I do however, disagree, Storm's grief when Professor X died was deep.

Bottom line is buy the normal widescreen bit, because the only thing you're paying an additional 9.00 for is the never before released comic book. I haven't read it yet due to pure disappointment that they didn't even have interviews with the cast, or an interactive segment with the villains and heroes, describing the new ones, or even giving a update on the old ones that we knew.

Come on, in the year 2007 we're seriously receiving a collector's edition with only ONE DVD!?!?! With no extra features to speak of???",1172966400,2,1790,4.694267515923567
7682006,2,B01CE00Q5C,"I really like to read the X-men comic books and I loved the X-men cartoon that was on when I was growing up. The first two movies were pretty good even though they didn't follow any of the storylines I know of. For instance Iceman was one of the original X-men and was therefore probably an old man by the time Rogue showed up. The love interest I remember was Gambit, who never even showed up in the movies. That's my first complaint. Gambit is my favorite. (I love to hear that accent.)I'd love to see him in an X-men movie. My second complaint is that most of the good characters end up dead in this movie. I'd list them, but some may not have seen it. Nightcrawler is completely missing from this movie. He's not even mentioned. My biggest complaint if that some of the characters that are introduced are nothing like they should be. Angel was very cocky and sure of himself in the original comic books, but in this movie he's very quiet. I can't remember a single line he had. I think he may have said a few lines when he's father is about the administer the ""cure."" He is also shown very little and for only brief amounts of time. The biggest character disappointment was with Beast. Beast is supposed to be very smart and very witty. I was excited when I heard Kelsey Grammer was playing him because he can be both. But his character wasn't. He wasn't stupid, but he's sopposed to be overly smart with an excellent vocabulary using words most people don't know, but they can get the meaning by what he says. He wasn't very witty. I can't remember any line I laughed about.

Jackman is great as Wolverine (again) but most of the other characters are very under-used which is sad since this is probably the last time we will see them for a long time. I also feel that the bastardization of one of the greatest ever comic storylines was a terrible disservice to the X-Man franchise.

7682027,3,B01CE00Q5C,"First of all, it was too short.  At 104 minutes, there is hardly enough time (as the movie shows) to develop the dozens of characters that are a) introduce and b) have disappeared.  Major characters are simply written off or ignored.  While Wolverine is my favorite and certainly takes the lead role along with Jean Gray, Storm, whom I would describe as one of the least popular characters, even though played by a very attractive actress, is pushed to the forefront (rumor has it because because Halle Barry threw a fit about her small roles).  Characters are introduced and lead you to believe that they will serve a purpose, then you don't see them again for an hour, at which time they make a 10-second appearance.  Also, the pseudo-goth mutants that Magneto takes on as his proverbial ""posse"", are laughable.  The 'no one understands me so I'll wear all black and cover myself in piercings' has worn very thin.  All these things aside, i did have a problem with the final fight scene with Magneto and Pyro - like they couldn't find anything better to do than toss burning car after burning car for 5 consecutive minutes?  Magneto was infinitely more diabolical in the first two and has taken a serious step back.  I did, however, enjoy the Wolverine/Phoneix part.  This movie would have been GREAT - had it been the first movie in the X-Men series, but, as the third in a series of who-knows-how-many films, I really expected a little better.

THe ending, I admit, is somewhat feel-good, but the death of some of the principal characters - one at her own request - make this something special, in the realm of truly excellent hard science fiction.  As such, while bringing out notions about American society with a theme of race and inclusiveness underneath, there is trajedy in these deaths.  Once again, the acting is simply spectacular, and the characters continue to evolve.  That makes this series outstanding, with a beginning and a potential end.

Recommended with enthusiasm, even for fans of the comic.  I recognize many of the episodes of this from comics that are 25 years old, but changed into its own art.  You can view all three as a whole, and they completely entertained me on several successive nights.

Of the 3 movies, I would say that this one ranks well above the 2nd yet trailing the 3rd. For those true XMen fans, you will find some discrepencies between the comic book character of the Phoenix and the Phoenix portrayed in the movie.

Nonetheless, the movie holds its entertainement value and is certainly 5 stars. Even good people die (Don't worry...I won't say who;-) )!!! And what can you say about the Juggernaut...true to his form.

In the first two ""X-Men"" films, perceptive viewers could easily detect the ""pro-gay rights"" subtext that ran through the storyline about a race of superpower ""mutants"" let loose on the world and the debate over their place in society.  The latest installment, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" takes the issue a step further by proposing a complex moral dilemma: should the ""mutants"" be encouraged to partake of a supposed ""cure"" for their condition or should they be proud of who they are and not change merely to placate a society made uncomfortable by their presence?

Unfortunately, even though ""The Last Stand"" raises this intriguing ethical issue, it really doesn't do anything all that interesting with it.  The main problem is that the screenplay simply fails to come up with a character commensurate with the movie's theme.  In fact, there are so many mutants running around that none of them is ever able to grab the center of the movie's attention or the focus of the audience.  Storm, Wolverine, Phoenix, Iceman, Rogue etc. all have their individual moments but they are soon crushed under the weight of overblown actions scenes and over-the-top special effects.  Only Ian Holm's evil Magneto has a chance to break through all the pyrotechnics and create some impact as a character.

I loved the original ""X-Men"" when it came out in 2003 precisely because it felt so bold and daring in its willingness to explore social issues along with all the CGI effects, stunt work and explosions that are par for the action film genre.  But the two follow-up editions have not lived up to those expectations.  I'm sorry to say that, despite all the technical fireworks of the grand finale, the ""X-Men"" series ends not with a bang but with a whimper.",1169337600,3,1747,4.871621621621622

I liked the first two X-Men installments for what they were, fairly clean-cut comic book escapism with well-done computer graphic effects.

This movie did not disappoint me when it came to fulfilling those same expectations.  I liked the simple plot, the integrity of the characters (whether good or evil) and the effects.  I stayed engaged the whole time.

In fact, the fetching Mrs. Brew and the kids had an errand to run, and told me to watch it by myself, they weren't interested.  They returned when the movie was half-way through, and got sucked in and couldn't tear themselves away.  Hahaha, joke's on them.

Anyway, what I liked most in this potato chip was the bond that Magneto and Prof X had, even though they were bitter rivals and at times seeming enemies.  When Prof X met his fate, Magneto was distraught.  Afterward, he laments his passing with words of praise.

Famke Janssen as Jean Grey was beautiful and indifferent in her fury and reminded me of Cate Blanchett in LOTR (during Galadriel's ""test of the ring"" scene).

7682062,3,B01CE00Q5C,"You know, I'm just so tired of the movies that take a comic book franchise, create characters with the names and traits from the book, then completely rewrite everything else about it.  I refrained from saying anything about the first 2 movies, but now it's just borderline ludicrous.

I saw one reviewer refer to Rogue as one of the weakest characters ever, yet in the comics she is one of the most powerful.  My wife kept asking me to help provide some backstory for certain characters and I had to say, ""Honey, I don't know.  Other than the names and the powers, nothing else is the same.""  I saw characters killed that, to my knowledge, have never been killed off in the comic.  It's been a few years since I read the books, but aren't Professor X and Juggernaut closely related?  I was thinking they were brothers, yet there's no recognition when they come face to face.  Some of the earliest X-Men in the books who were the mentors are the young students in the movies.  And don't even get me started on the origin of the Dark Phoenix.  In the comics, the Phoenix was an alien being but here it's the result of a split personality created by the manipulations of Professor X.  In fact, the way things develop in the movie, Professor X is almost as evil in his actions as Magneto.

I continue to be disappointed in the screen development of Marvel comics.  While the DC characters tend to be mostly true to the comics (Superman, Batman), Marvel seems to take great delight in discarding years of comic history and rewriting everything.  The most successful movies are those where they left most of it intact, such as Spiderman.  The dregs are those where they tampered too much, like Daredevil.

X-Men is visually stunning.  Special effects are well done.  If you don't know the comics, the storyline is acceptable.  In fact, I think I would've enjoyed this movie much more if it had the same type of story and characters, but had not called them the X-Men.

7682078,2,B01CE00Q5C,"As is often the case with movies and their sequels, we see a dwindling in story content, authenticity and strength.  All too often the problem arises from the egos of those involved in the acting.  Such is sadly the case with X-MEN: THE LAST STAND.  Someone got sidetracked and decided that minor characters should all of a sudden be major players, ""mutating"" the story in ways that, in the end, destroy the dramatic value that might have been possible had things been left alone.

Enter Halle Berry.  Apparently she must have felt that her role as Storm was far too minor.  No doubt her insane argument was, ""Hey, I've got an Oscar, I'm the greatest, I'll call the shots now and don't you forget it!"" But don't take my word for it. Read the original comic books. Look at the original character and story balance there. Storm was never more than a bit player and, all things considered, the stories were better off as a result.  So what the heck happened here?  Every time the scene changes, there's Halle Berry on screen. She dices, she slices, she makes frozen yogurt. And to make matters considerably worse her lines are contrived, stilted and pathetically acted.  And don't get me started on her ridiculous hairdo. The movie should have been more appropriately titled X-MEN: DEATH BY STORM.

And given Berry's paltry overtones, everything else unravels leaving a tangled mess that is not only irreparable but hilariously comical as well. The other actors did their very best in their various roles but, given Berry's ""overpresence,"" never had a chance and neither did this movie.

Jean Grey became the Pheonix due to alien intervention and challenges.  SHE WAS NOT MENTALLY UNBALANCED DUE TO HER POWERS.  Also, killing off Xavier after only 3 movies only proves that the director had nothing in mind but making a name for himself because he sure didn't produce a product that X-Men fans can embrace.

I also thought that the mutant powers went way over the top compared to what they had been previously.  Overall, an average sci-fi / superhero movie.

I certainly hope they don't end the series with three films - I am not a big X-Men fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed all three - great special effects, interesting plotlines, and memorable characters.

Brett Ratner did an excellent job, and I doubt very seriously the director who left for Superman could have done any better. It was packed with action and a little bit of romantic overtones. Breath taking effects dominate the film.

I think X-men is the BEST movie franchise because in addition to having literally hundreds of built in scripts (comic books) to choose from, unlike most comic book franchises it has many, many characters which can be rotated in and out (i.e. Nightcrawler, Beast, Gambit, Jubilee etc etc) just as was done in the comics as new students joined the schools over the years. As such I think it would be very foolish to stop here. There should be at very least TEN (10) X-men movies. Heck, there are going to be 6 or 7 Spider-man movies, so we hear, and that is only 1 character (as great as he is).

FOR HARD CORE FANS ONLY****

The ONLY criticism I have (being a Juggernaut fan I have to go here), first of all the Juggernaut would crush Wolverine in literally 2 seconds (to answer the question posed in the extra feature) by simply overpowering him and snapping his neck. This is the only way to kill Woverine given in the comics. (Spiderman almost did it after kicking Wolverine's butt but wimped out). Wolverine's claws cannot penetrate the Juggernaut AT ALL. Storm's lightening bolts cannot harm him either so I'm glad they left that stupid scene where he get knocked out by storm & wolverine out. Oh, and he KO'd Colossus in 2 seconds flat in ""What if Charles Xavier became the Juggernaut"" - a great comic. He even goes toe to toe with the Hulk. In one X-men cartoon, Rogue tries to absorb his power (and does, which causes her to flip out) without success because his power is limitless. She absorbs some power but it doesn't weaken him. He doesn't need food, water, or air. Magneto, who in the comics can use the iron in your blood to kill you, was literally slapped after he tried (unsuccessfully of course) to do that to the Juggernaut. In many a comic, it takes the whole X-men team to take him on, and the plan is always to remove his helmet since they cannot defeat him otherwise (removing the helmet, which shields him from all mental attackes, makes him vulnerable mentally to Charles Xavier's mental powers). Secondly, the Juggernaut is NOT a mutant. He obtained his power via the Crimson jem of Cyttorak and his power is mystical. As such, he would not have been affected by that little dweeb's (leach's) powers. So I didn't like the ending.

Chalk it up to poetic license and noone but us hard core Juggernaut fans will care. Vinny Jones also did a GREAT GREAT job as the Juggernaut.

The next movie (after the Wolverine spin off and the Magneto spin off) they should have the Sentinels, where the Juggernaut has to team up with the X-men. Just a thought.",1167955200,,2857,4.56140350877193

Focusing more on storm was not a bad idea, but I've never been a huge fan of Berry's acting. The casting decision for Beast and the makeup were very well done. The movie just tries to do to much in a short amount of time. Characters die, and I find myself scratching my head ""I should probably be feeling something right now. Am I sad? Angry at their death?

In the same way that Fantastic four was ""adapted"" to a movie so has the last Xmen movie.

Jean's abrupt fate disappointed us, and as we reflected back on the rest of the movie, we realised that it was full of pointless sub-plots and a lack of depth to all the characters. Nothing made us feel for the fate of the mutants before the possibility of a ""cure"" as the previous movies would have done.

What was the point of introducing Angel? Why wasn't Mystique as astonishingly evil as she was before? Why was Jean so devoid of facial expression? Why not expand on Rogue as a character instead of relegade her to the lines of ""well she was in the first two, so I guess she has to be in this one as well, but we sure aren't going to give her any real screen time""?

But the real disappointment was Jean's fate. What a boring way to end all that spectacle. Everything seemed to be pointing to a showdown between her and the ""white boy"" from Alcatraz. Would his power be enough to neutralize hers? Well ... I guess we'll never know. And we never find out what happened to him after his rescue.

I hope there is not another X-Men movie because we will almost certainly not watch it.",1167609600,,1212,4.353982300884955
7682189,4,B01CE00Q5C,"""X-Men: The Last Stand"" introduces some provocative ideas and leaves us almost convinced that this will be the last X-Men movie for a long time. Mutants and humans are living in relative harmony, with Dr. Hank McCoy (Kelsey Grammar), aka Beast, serving as Secretary of Mutant Affairs to a sympathetic U.S. President. The peace is shattered when a pharmaceutical company announces that it can produce a ""cure"" for the mutant-X gene, allowing Mutants to become normal homo sapiens if they so choose. The Mutant community is divided over whether this is a good thing, and assurances are given that the ""cure"" is entirely voluntary. Meanwhile, Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) is discovered alive but no longer able to suppress the violence of her powers. Magneto (Ian McKellan) uses the ""cure"" controversy to incite Mutants against humans and plans to destroy the source of the drug.

""X-Men: The Last Stand"" incorporates some elements from the X-Men comic that we haven't' seen before in the movies, such as the Danger Room and the Dark Phoenix storyline. New characters are Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Angel (Ben Foster), and Beast. Beast comes off pretty well. He, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and Magneto are the most developed characters, leaving the others to come and go in the periphery. There is too little of Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), as always. The debate over whether or not Mutants should take the ""cure"" is interesting. But the film's view of using the ""cure"" as a weapon is morally confused. Perhaps that is deliberate, but it's unsatisfying. I rate ""X3"" the same as the previous films in terms of story, characters, and action. But this film's themes are a little more contentious.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006 single disc): There are 24 deleted scenes available with optional commentary by director Brett Ratner and writers Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn. There are 2 trailers for X3, Trailer A (1  min) and Trailer B (2  min), along with trailers for other films. There are 2 audio commentaries. The first audio commentary by director Brett Ratner and writers Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn is conversational and often joking. It takes us through the story with some technical details and comments on structure. The 2nd audio commentary by producers Avi Arad, Lauren Shuler Donner, and Ralph Winter is more informative, addressing visual effects, locations, tone, story, actors, elements from the comic books, and other technical issues. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.",1167609600,,2545,5.066825775656325
7682190,3,B01CE00Q5C,"'X-men,' I thought reading reviews, would be like a high-tech sci-fi ""Calvin Ball"".  That is I thought the evolution of the movie's rules and causality would change by whim.  Instead, we get a ""rock/ paper/ scissors"" approach.  Each superhero has their own connecting powers, like one has fire and another has ice.  In this installment, the mutants find there is a cure for their powers, which some make into a crusade, others a curse.  There is a societal divide; one that breaks out with signs and protestors, but, unfortunately, like real life, it is too often resolved with violence.  (Will this be the fate of stem cell research, and was this something they had in mind for the movie's theme?)  Anyway, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Phoenix (Famke Jensen) have a consequential love affair that has global--or at least environmental--consequences.  The visual effects throughout are stunning and Storm (played skillfully by Halle Berry) and others give us capable performances for the plot's urgency.  Stately figures like Magneto (Ian McKlellen) and Sir Henry (Kelsey Grammer) give some weightiness to the story's edge.  Interesting and eye-popping, 'X-Men- The Last Stand' is impressive--even for a ""newbie"" like me.  Storm leaves us with words to live by at slain Professor X's funeral, ""We live in an age of darkness--a world full of hate, fear, and intolerance. In every age there are those who try to fight it."" In 'X-Men- The Last Stand' they do it in style.",1167523200,2,1468,5.024793388429752
7682191,2,B01CE00Q5C,"I have not viewed the DVD of this, so I can't comment on the quality of the bonus features or anything like that.  I saw it in Grauman's Chinese Theater opening night with a packed house and the excitement was all around me.  The last two X-men movies were decent adaptations under the helm of Bryan Singer, X2 being the superior movie, and although Brett Ratner had taken over the directing reins, I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and I went in without any pre-conceived notions.  I came out angry that they ruined what could have been the best X-men movie thus far.

So going into it, I thought X3 had a lot of potential.  From the trailers it seemed to have some really great action in it as well as visual effects.  I thought the opening scene was really fantastic.  When I saw the giant sentinel head fall down through the fog I got really psyched because I figured it was foreshadowing the fact that we'd be seeing more sentinels later on.  And then you never do!

I liked the fact that it turns out to be a danger room sequence because that's something else I always wanted to see in the movies as well, so it was off to a good start.  And then it immediately started going downhill when Jean returns as Phoenix and they kill off Cyclops.  I will admit Cyclops isn't my favorite X-man, but I definitely feel he got the shaft in these movies.  He was hardly in X2 and then to just kill him off like that?  He definitely should have been around for the final battle at least.  Supposedly the reason behind this being that when I heard the screenwriter Simon Kinberg speaking at Comic Con this past year in San Diego, he explained the reason he killed Cyclops off so early was to show the audience right off the bat that anything can and will happen in this movie.  I believe the more accurate explanation is that James Marsden was busy shooting Superman Returns with Bryan Singer and so it was probably in his contract that he required a minor role in The Last Stand.

I liked Beast a lot in it.  He was a great addition and I wish he had been in every single movie.  That's probably the one thing most people will agree they did right.  Kelsey Grammer was a great casting choice. He really nailed the character showing us Beast's intelligence as well as his ferocity in battle.  It was cool to see Angel make an appearance but he wasn't in it very much and they didn't develop the Cure storyline very well.

It was obvious they were going to eventually have a Pyro/Iceman showdown and it was cool to finally see him turn into ice, but they should have done it sooner.  I wanted to see him surf on ice like he does in the comics.  And I can't believe they didn't have a Juggernaut/Colossus match!  How could they possibly have these two in the same movie and not think to do that is beyond me.

All right, so here's my biggest complaint and the biggest change I would have made.  I hated the fact that they kept taking away mutant powers from characters like Mystique and Magneto.  I won't even get started on Prof. X getting killed because it does happen eventually.  The worst thing though is having Rogue go through with the cure.  I was completely convinced that at some point she would show up again and touch Phoenix, and not only would that bring Jean back to normal, but then Rogue would gain her flying and strength abilities through that and be able to fly around and destroy stuff in the final battle.  I realize it's not exactly the way it was done in Marvel continuity but it would have been much better than the alternative.  The fact that Rogue lost her power and they killed off Phoenix was the worst decision ever!  It made Rogue's character pointless throughout the entire series in my opinion.  Why would they put her in the first movie without all her powers unless they were planning on giving them to her at some point?  She should have either had them from the start or not been in the series at all if this is how they're going to treat her character.

The Last Stand never really felt like an X-men movie all the way through.  That's why I say it's a decent action movie for those who knew nothing about the X-men prior to the movies, but for fans of the comics and the series, it's truly a disappointment.  They got a few details right here and there, but for the most part it seemed like they just picked up where the last one left off and then made it up from there and had no idea what to do.  What they should have done would be to have ended it with the X-men and the brotherhood of mutants fighting each other, but then had sentinels show up, so they would have had to team up temporarily in order to survive.  If they insisted on including the cure story line, there should have been a subplot about the sentinels rounding up mutants and forcing them to take the cure if they're unwilling to.  I really wanted to see a sentinel battle if you couldn't tell.

And the fact that they teased us with Gambit's name, Remy LeBeau, on a monitor in X2 but didn't bring him in for the third (and possibly final) movie is inexcusable.  I believe part of the reason they were killing off characters and taking away their powers was to put an end to the series, thus ""The Last Stand"", but I definitely think if they wanted to bring it back in a few years, they could introduce Bishop.  If anyone remembers Bishop, (the time traveling mutant from the comics who's always trying to alter the past to fix the future), and if they were to make another X-men movie, Bishop should come back and stop this movie from happening.  Or at least stop Prof. X and everyone else from dying.  Also the scene at the end of the credits really didn't make much sense at all and it felt like the final insult to X-men fans everywhere.  Overall, I couldn't understand why the producers couldn't have attempted to keep it more true to its comic roots, but for now, we can let the X-men movie franchise rest in peace.",1167350400,2,5938,4.347549909255898

Boy was I wrong.  There idea for a ""good"" movie was to take the best storyline in X-men lore and change it drastically, and not for the better.  Who thought this was a good idea.

7682193,3,B01CE00Q5C,"I have seen all the movies that have been put out by Marvel over the last 6 years or so and was never a big fan of the X-Men films though the first 2 were passable.  This movie has way too many characters in it!  Some of the characters are pathetic looking such as the Juggernaut and The Beast (who looks and sounds like they dyed a gorilla costume from the Planet of the Apes movies).  They waited to the last installment to introduce The Beast and the Angel who were original X-Men in the comics (X-Men was never a popular title until they changed the line-up adding Wolverine and Storm along with others).

There is just too much going on for the viewer to grasp the entire plot unless you were intricately familiar with the comic stories.  The scene where Magneto rips and moves a large section of the Golden Gate Bridge was ridiculous.  The movie seemed to also rip off the humans being disolved into a sand-like substance by The Phoenix from the War of the Worlds movie (sans the clothes that remain after they disolve).

The last scene of the movie sets it up for a sequel though I don't know if my head can stand another two hours of overdone special effects with too many characters (as much as the Fantastic Four was panned it was a lot easier to watch with only four heroes and one villian to focus on)!",1167177600,,1314,4.338775510204082
7682194,3,B01CE00Q5C,"This film could have been another ""Empire Strikes Back."" With a bleakly tragic plot line and a devastating list of casualties, it could have described the heart-wrenching tragedy that inevitably unravels at the core of the greatest sagas.

They had all the right pieces. A daunting, uncontrollable new power in the form of the Phoenix, with the obvious implication that the Professor's fearful meddling in young Jean's mind is at least partly responsible for her untamed alter-ego. Doubting himself--not as a telepath, but as a teacher--Xavier had locked off the parts of her power that he believed could not be educated. Thus hidden from her conscious mind, this power had the freedom to become the Phoenix, a selfish and destructive creature possessing nearly unimaginable power.

Meanwhile, a major pharmaceutical company develops a ""cure"" for the mutant condition, sharply dividing the mutant community and providing the banner around which Magneto can build his own army of angry mutants. The government, of course, has weaponized the ""cure"" using plastic darts that take only seconds to incapacitate their target.

Again, all of the right pieces for a genuine tragedy for our X-Men. Betrayal, fallen friends, hopeless odds. I loved this story. I could have enjoyed this pain... but they just would not let me.

On a dramatic level, the film falls flat. Director Brett Ratner comes across as amateurish and unoriginal, while choppy editing and rush-job writing whisk us through a dazzling array of scenes with virtually no dramatic impact. Meanwhile, writers and director simply refused to tug at the nagging loose threads of their own story. The most glaring example? Xavier, who may not have deserved to die, certainly made his own death-bed. Despite a weakly-drawn confrontation with Wolverine, however, not to mention punchy but thin accusations from Magneto, Xavier never admits his mistakes, never confronts his contradictions. Thus, he dies still pleading his pathetic paternalism to a Jean Grey already destroyed by his own manipulations. He dies with impotent stubbornness, with no dignity because he cannot escape his conceit. His death, while tragic, leaves a bitter taste in my mouth because he never managed to repent.

If his death is sour, Xavier's memorial and the succeeding scenes are far worse. The memorial is brief and unremarkable; afterward, Hank discusses closing the school, an option that Storm all too quickly rejects. We are supposed to feel uplifted, hopeful that life goes on for the X-Men. Instead, I feel cheated, robbed of yet another chance to properly mourn the loss of an icon: we never get to absorb his death, to revel in the tragedy. Suddenly, things are simply back to normal.

The narrative flow is practically non-existent: the story, while interesting, fails to build tension toward a dramatic climax. It is hardly helped by a flat and uninspired musical score.

There was no need for the X-Men to ""win"" this battle. There was every reason, in fact, for them to lose. We might have left this story with Magneto and Phoenix ascendant, at the verge of true world conquest. Indeed, this would have provided the escalation necessary to make the Sentinels a reality, to launch this movie franchise wholesale into the bleak and unapologetic world of the X-Men comics.

Instead, we get Hank McCoy, ambassador to the UN. We get a world in which, for no convincing reason, human and mutant suddenly get along. Yes, the X-Men saved the world (again) from Magneto, and they defeated the seemingly unstoppable Phoenix... but are we really supposed to believe that human paranoia gives in that easily?

The actors, for the most part, did a superb job with a lousy script. Ellen Page was especially notable for a very honest, very relatable Kitty Pryde--I wish we had seen more of her.

7682195,3,B01CE00Q5C,"I really enjoyed watching this movie but, there were parts and actors in it that you just couldn't stomach.  I've never liked rogue and her character as an actor, she just come's off way too subdued and normal,  (imagine that!) compared to the wild, fun and carefree 'southern girl' of the X-men cartoons callin peolpe 'suga' that we all got used to growing up.

Storm took way too much of a role in this movie, the screen time wolverine got wasn't bad at all.  If anything wolverine has become a better actor over the movies.  Storm seemed way out of character in this movie compared to the prior 2, she acted alright, but she felt of character, and almost nauseatingly so.  Magneto, Xavier, and Jean did a pretty bang up job with their characters, although jean had some weak acting moments.

The problem with this movie is that it tries to pack way too much plot into too short a timeframe, its like the plot and scripts they had were sheared into oblivion.  The movie runs 1 hour 40 minutes, it's simply not enough to develop the story much at all, especially in relation to jeans alter ego, we never learn or get a glimpse into her past with Dr. Xavier.  This movie should have been more fleshed out with many aspects of it left for another movie, but I guess the suits wanted to finish it at three.  It's a shame really because X-Men was turning into a great over-all movie series.

I really hope they continue it if they start doing a better job on it, if it's anything like X-Men 3... it may be entertaining but after you've watched it you'll have all these questions and you'll feel unsatisfied.",1166572800,,1604,4.458904109589041

I understood the plot and what the film was trying to tell us through symbolism the way an X-Men story should. Some characters do ""die"" in this movie, but in the world of the X-Men, they are always brought back. Characters have died in the comics and came back, and the small clip at the end of the credits of this movie proves that dead doesn't always mean dead.

I thought they made good use of the special effects of the film. One of the most beautiful parts of the movie was watching Angel fly over the bridge. The special effects really came in use at the exciting battle scene towards the end of the movie. You hear about the war coming in the previous two movies and now it is finally hear and it makes for a good watch that isn't boring.

The acting is also as great as in the other films as well. There are some powerful scenes such as when Logan and Storm are crying over one of their friends who had died. Overall, if you are a fan of the series, then you owe it to yourself to get the DVD. No; it isn't the best in the series, but if you love the X-Men movies and are like me, then you will probably like this as well.",1166054400,,1250,4.09795918367347
7682198,3,B01CE00Q5C,"Plagued with production problems since the director from the previous two X-Men chapters, Bryan Singer, said goodbye, X-Men: The Last Stand proves to be no less problematic upon its theatrical release. Hired gun Brett Ratner tries to appease fans of Singer's work while adding a plethora of geekout moments for fan-boys to eat up. The plan backfires, however, as for every one of these moments that The Last Stand gets right, it gets at least two or three things wrong in character development, plot, and overall appeal. To start with, some major cast members are killed off, and surprisingly early on, too. This would be enough to anger fans of the comics and films alike but to make things worse, just about everyone in this movie acts out of character--Wolverine becoming the team leader and Professor Xavier turning into a control freak are but a couple examples. It also doesn't help that all the main story arches that have been developed so painstakingly by Singer are mostly ignored or completely dissolved here in favor of a few flashier and far shallower characters. Though the opening scene with Angel as a child is particularly moving, his character doesn't do anything of importance for the rest of the movie. The same could be said of countless others whose sole purpose is to look cool and provide a quick fight scene or one-liner. There are so many things wrong with X-Men: The Last Stand that to put them into a list would take days to complete. The only thing that can be said for it is that Brett Ratner is able to rely on the screenwriters to add in enough action-packed effects shots to keep people off the trail of just how much is lacking here. A summer popcorn flick at best, X-Men: The Last Stand strips the series of everything that made it enduring and original and replaces it with enough tongue-in-cheek humor and whizbang effects to keep casual audiences coming back for more.",1165276800,3,1906,4.743975903614458
7682199,5,B01CE00Q5C,"A lot of people did not seem to like this picture as much as the other two.  Allow me to be a dissenter.  This actually was my favorite of the three.

For those who have not read my other reviews on the X-Men movies, the theme of the series is fighting prejudice.  The bad guy mutants are ready to wage war with the humans who persecute them.  The good guy mutants try to live peaceably with humans and even protect them from the bad guys.  This one reverses the plot from the original movie:  instead of mutants trying to change humans into mutants, there is a new drug humans devised to change mutants into humans.

This movie has a parallel theme, which is the matter of choice.  As a minister, I'm familiar with the debate over predestination and free will.  In the story, there are humans who think mutants need to be cured, mutants who oppose this cure, and mutants who believe they don't need to be cured but will allow each individual to make up their mind of whether they want to change.

One reason I like this movie is it introduces two of my favorite X-Men comic characters that were so far absent:  The Beast, one of the original X-Men (played superbly by Kelsey Grammer), and the Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), who is a mutant in the movie though not in the comics.  Another original X-Man that makes his movie debut is the Angel.

I found the ending of the first movie to be effectively symbolic, and there is an allusion to it in the ending of this movie.  I enjoyed several of the little tangent stories.  I didn't mind the fact that Storm got more attention than usual (and the Wolverine always dominated the stories), but many of the other characters have adequate development.  The movie does seem to close up the trilogy, but I would be happy for a spin-off or a new trilogy or something like that.",1164499200,,1815,4.435045317220544
7682200,1,B01CE00Q5C,"I enjoyed the first X-Men movie not only because it was so thrilling to see a live-action adaptation of a cherished comic book series, but also because it had a plot that made sense and it didn't go (too), over-the-top.  The sequel, X-Men 2, was still very enjoyable because the plot was consistent to the end and the action sequences were not as overdone as MI:2.  X-Men 3 was THOROUGHLY dissapointing for me because it tried so hard to pack in everything it could, to the detriment of the plot.  I found myself wondering why this series of mismatched scenes were jumbled together when there should have been a very solid plotline to follow.  Were we to focus on Jean Gray?  Archangel?  Magneto?  What was the movie about other than an excuse to go WAY over-the-top on every sequence and barely work on character development.  What a pity the last movie was so thrown together.",1164499200,3,878,4.619354838709677
7682201,2,B01CE00Q5C,"A huge fan of both the comics and the cartoon series, I loved the first X-Men, particularly the way Singer created an ensemble team, combined the mutants' talents, and made them explode on screen (sans funny spandex costumes). The second was also enjoyable, although the original remains my favorite. The third was an absolute mess. A feast for the eyes, certainly, in terms of special effects and action, but it had little appreciation for the characters.

Unlike the first two films, there is a lack of focus on our mutants. They are merely warriors within an army, without character or cause. There are too many of them - the audience gets lost in a visual series of ""powers,"" and it seems Ratner was merely using the premise of the X-Men and mutants purely to display some sort of special effects mastery. You really only see glimpses when you hope to see the whole picture.

I enjoyed the explanation of the Phoenix, as both the comics and cartoon were often unclear about the hows and whys. And Famke Jenssen does a masterful job with all her silent gazes and glares. But Xaviar is cast off too quickly and without purpose. What little script that exists is canned and even corny. And the film disregards too many of our feature mutants. Rogue - one of my favorites from the comics - is incredibly powerful, but she is nonexistent in the film. She serves almost no purpose, which is a complete waste. Mystique is also wasted. She was so awesome in X2, I would have hoped to see a repeat performance.

In a nutshell: sorry premise, misuse of mutants, too many mutants to identify with any of the characters, and hardly more than a special effects fun fair.

I would LOVE to see another X-Men ensemble, but only if it returns to its roots as envisioned by Bryan Singer.",1164412800,,1773,4.60126582278481

Minor spoilers ---

Good points: It is an action movie with three terrific set pieces : Magneto's rescue of Mystique, the fight at Jean Grey's house and the end fight at Alcatraz.  As before, I liked the scenes between Magnito and Charles Xavier.  Their relationship is facinating and I wish it was visible more in all three of the movies.  Also, the introduction of Beast by Kelsey Grammer was interesting.  I did not expect him to be good in an action movie but he was.

Bad points : I know there are many mutants with different powers but it felt at times there were just too many to keep track of in a 104 minute movie.  Without the Dark Pheonix background in the comics, the Jean Grey story was hard to follow or fully understand.  I was not sure what she was beyond all powerful.  As a character, she was not well developed here.

In summary, I believe this was the weakest of the three X-Men movie but still had some interesting characters and action scenes that would allow me to recommend this movie to others.",1164326400,2,1246,4.488888888888889

""Ratner, emphasis on the RAT, what were you thinking?""  Eliminating two primary characters and never ever really exploring the powers of the Dark Phoenix is just idiotic!  There were a couple of deleted scenes that I would have included in the original release which would have given more substance to her ""uncanniness.""  But she came in with sort of a wimper and went out the same way. That's not to say what we ended up with,wasn't entertaining, but a lot more exploration could have brought the film to a more cataclysmic crescendo!

As far as the Stan Lee Colletor's edition DVD as well as other Region 1 editions - what a croc!  Although the comic book included is nice, what's the point of using two separate menus, a brotherhood access and an X-men access, only to show the same movie and same features on each?  Where is any behind the scenes features that other regions got?  I thought at least the Brotherhood version would have edited in some of the better or longer deleted scenes or maybe repositioned some of the various scenes, but there was absolutely no difference -- nothing!!!!  What idiot decided this was a good idea?  It was an absolute useless endeavor.  Given that I went out of my way to purchase the Region 1 version, I should have spent my money purchasing an Aussie version instead which includes more behind the scenes features and for basically the same price (or less0.

7682217,3,B01CE00Q5C,"I enjoyed the X-men comic books since I was a kid.  Apparently, they became something else after I stopped reading comics in my mid-teens.  The first couple of these movies were pretty fun and this one provides the big battle Magneto has been aiming at for quite awhile.

What I don't like about this movie is the sheer number of mutants.  I mean, there are so many of them by what definition could they be mutations?  And since all their powers seem more or less unique, what in the world could be happening genetically (which is more about conserving useful traits)?

Anyway, the mutants go to war because the government has come up with a ""cure"" that suppresses the mutant's mutantness.  And while some mutants want to take this cure, others feel that it is wrong to cure any of them because it is tantamount to admitting that being a mutant means something is wrong with you.  We see this in real life with a movement working against the notion that it would be a blessing to provide them with hearing.  There are other aspects that the X-Men movies allude to none to subtly that I will not comment on except to note that we all know it is there.

The big scenes are all quite spectacular and there are lots and lots and lots of mutants with some cool and some silly powers.  This whole cure thing has some odd effects and it isn't only the tangential characters that get whacked in this one.

So, enjoy!  But don't expect to get too much in the way of character development.  And you might want to throw a rubber brick at the screen for some of the plot twists chosen.",1163635200,2,1573,4.397923875432526

The intense battle between the different philosophies of Xavier and Magneto is at its peak in the last Xmen movie The Last Stand, a tale of survival.  This movie emcompasses all genres such as politics, action, romance, comedy, drama, horror, etc...this movie has something for everyone!

From the politics of the Cure, to the forced suppression of the Dark Pheonix of Jean Grey, the internal conflict between right and wrong surfaces throughout this thought-provoking movie.  Not only is the storyline beautifully philosophical, the actors and actresses express their emotions with perfect intensity.

7682219,3,B01CE00Q5C,"The X-Men series has never been my favorite. It strains itself to be profound, but rarely ever is. They have WAY too many characters and not nearly enough screen time. They are too proud of their special effects. In general, the whole series has been mishandled. That said, for a summertime popcorn blockbuster how can I really complain about ""X-Men: The Last Stand""? What other Hollywood film of this stripe has the nerve to point out the ugly, discriminatory practices of our government? This film follows almost the same formula as the previous two films even though the switched directors from Bryan Singer (Superman beckoned) to Brett Ratner. The X-Men battle with themselves over being mutant, and then with other mutants whose politics they disagree with. There are basically two types of scenes here, those that involve pontifications and those that involve special effects bonanzas. These scenes get woven together pretty poorly, but nobody seems to care because they're just there to catch a glimpse of their favorite X-Man perform their greatest hits.

The government, always looking to help out their citizens, has created a cure for mutants. Better yet, they are going to force them to take it. Hey if George Bush can win an election by campaigning against homosexuals why wouldn't those same tactics work for this president? My main problem with this film is its message, assuming that I am reading it correctly. Noam Chomsky has always said that there is no use is speaking truth to power because power already knows the truth, they just don't care. So at the end we have the ""bad"" X-Men fighting the government trying to stop them from forcing the mutants to take the antidote. Meanwhile, the ""good"" X-Men are fighting the ""bad"" X-Men over. . .a personal matter I guess. The poster for the film says ""Take a Stand"" and that is what Magneto and his crew were doing. Wolverine and Co., on the other hand, seemed to be fighting for complacency. Oh well. This is one blockbuster that at least dumbs the ideas down so far that even the dumbest guy in the audience is forced to think a little.

We can all probably agree that money is a replacement for art, and that is quite obvious in many of these scenes (the Golden Gate Bridge incident, for instance). And that's fine, I like special effects too, but it underscores a bigger problem in the movie biz. People only like special effects, so a non-stop explosion-o-rama like ""The Marine"" gets to play in theaters across the country, but a thoughtful, non-explosive film like ""Half Nelson"" is stuck in box office hell (the art house). Halle Berry shows up here to pick up the easiest pay check of her career, as does Anna Paquin (looking suddenly old, no thanks to the strands of gray in her hair). In our society the only thing that is truly accepted is to be white, rich and hetero (if you don't believe me, look at out Senate). I just don't understand why this film had the villains be the only ones who stood up to this abomination.

7682220,3,B01CE00Q5C,"You would be hard pressed to find a bigger X-men fan. I think the X-men is the richest of all the comic book superhero collections, when it comes to stories, characters and possibilities. Spiderman's the coolest, but X-men has numerous characters that deal with real issues that coincide with issues of the world... like mutantism/racism, fear of the unknown and stereotyping.

So, now we have X-men: THE LAST STAND. What? Last stand?

The first two X-men movies were outstanding, yet only scratching the surface of the stories that are to be told in the comic book series and its possibilities. The third and supposedly, FINAL film, couldn't possibly do the series justice if it ended the series now. I mean, what about APOCALYPSE, JUGGERNAUT, BLACK TOM, ERIC THE RED, the FOUR HORSEMEN, GAUNTLET, the HELLFIRE CLUB, STRYFE and the Mutant Liberation Front and of course the Sentinels.

So, what did the creators of X-MEN: THE LAST STAND do? I'm still not sure. They took, what was the PHOENIX SAGA, or when Jean Grey returns from the dead as an even more powerful Mutant than she was, struggling to control her powers. They took the Phoenix Saga, rewrote it, and hit the fast forward button.

Ultimately, we do get to see the Sentinels... for about 15 seconds. Their eyes shining through fog and one of their heads dropping to the ground... only to turn out being a simulator. Then we do get to meet JUGGERNAUT... again, seemingly just thrown in and not given any meaningful air time. We get to meet a bunch of random Mutants, seemingly created by the writers. None of which are of any note. Oh, and of course we get to see ANGEL in some brief scenes... dives out a window and flies away and then appears in the final scene briefly. Colossus, vaguely used. Again, all these cool characters... just basically given a reference and not explored.

Oh, I almost forgot about the introduction of BEAST, played by Kelsey Grammar. He does a great job, but again, just a, ""Here's Beast, shows over folks.""

So, why are they in such a hurry to END THE MOST SUCCESSFUL comic book TRILOGY of all time? They are so intent on ONLY HAVING 3 FILMS that they sped through years of X-MEN history and needless to say put together a hyperactive, crammed too tight, scatter-brained, sloppy and disappointing film.

What WAS a story that EXCEEDED all boundaries and had no limits, earth, space & beyond, became a story that could be capped off with a not-so-huge battle on a small island... and done.

This is the final installment of the popular ""X-Men"" trilogy, the film is kind of weak compared to the awesome first two installments. But there is plenty of good action sequences, some humor, more wolverine action, emotion, and new mutants like Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) as the director of ""Rush Hour"" Brett Ratner takes over Bryan Singer's spot for director to take this final installment to a new direction. It's a weak but very good end to a great Marvel comic movie series until a few character spin-offs come along like ""Wolverine"" and ""Magneto"".

All of the sequences and plot elements that these two characters provided in this, the third installation of the X-Men series, were thought out and bolstered the true spirit of their X-Men influence. However, the rest of the film, was rushed and obviously a hand-off.

For those of you that haven't watched, read no further:

Cyclops is killed off in basically the first 10 minutes of the film...

Storm mysteriously looses her accent-- Halle Berry was a horrible choice to begin with. Plus, she get's to be in charge, and finally takes charge?... after Xavier's unfortunate death-- the best element and scene in this film. Honestly, I was very moved.

Rogue is completely useless... used less... in this film. Seems Miss Paquin only showed up for the paycheck... you weren't missing out on much kid.

Mystique... well, she was killed... no more eye candy. I didn't weep.

Vinnie Jones; love you man, but you are too intelligent for Juggernaut.

And, what dissapointed me the most... how on earth could they take Magneto's power's away. The cure vacine plot was so ridiculously concoted to the point where we, the audience, were expected to believe that Magneto deserved to lose his genetic abilities... how democratic of you.

Basically, Singer moved on, and left a great comic-to-film series hanging in the breeze-- one of the few gems in the genre, because you all know that most of these flicks leave much to be desired... Fantastic 4, Daredevil, come on.

7682226,2,B01CE00Q5C,"I watched the Blu-ray version of this movie and it looked great visually, but the movie lacked substance.

First off, Brett Ratner's vision of Xmen 3 was so terrible that it equates to Joel Schumacher's vision of Batman & Robin. Yes, Xmen 3 is the Batman & Robin of the Xmen Universe.

Xmen 3 was not very good. Yes there is a lot of action, but it's pointless and without a cohesive story. The movie had 13 different plots going on at the same time and none of the plots actually came together, and if two or three did, they were done terribly. The dialogue was bad.

If you know anything about Xmen, you cannot bring the entire series to a close in 1 and half hours. The first two movies in the series spent so much time developing the characters and story. Xmen 2 was done really well, combining story and action successfully. Brett Ratner's Xmen 3 was all action and no substance.

The characters who were strongly developed in the previous two movies didn't exist for long in the third movie (Cyclops and Rogue). The third part should have been split into TWO different 2 hour long movies if they wanted to end the series.

And now for my personal view: Stupid, terrible new characters were introduced. The casting wasn't that great for the new characters. It is possible to make a great Marvel/super hero movie while staying true to the ORIGINAL material that made it so famous in the firstplace. See Ironman. See Dark Knight.  Keep it serious as the source material is of a serious nature.

Xmen 3 as a movie is a far cry from the original source material, didn't mind the leather suits at all, but the stories seemed like a young high school student wrote it.  Next time make a more serious Xmen movie along the lines of the first two Xmen movies.",1162771200,,1755,4.4625

Beast was only in this one, so technically he was only in one X-Men of the whole series even if he is a major character in the X-Men series.

That having been said, I find the third installment to be the most entertaining of the lot - and that's some praise from one that thought the second film was excellent.

This time out, there are so many characters (mutant and human) that it was obvious that some of the returning characters, like Anna Paquin (Rogue) and James Marsden (Cyclops) would have less screen time.  It is also obvious that Jackman, Berry, and McKellan are the stars, with Stewart doing nothing more than a ""death scene"" cameo.  As others have stated, Kelsey Grammer steals the show as ""Beast,"" with Vinnie Jones running a close second as ""Juggernaut"".

It's also good to see stage, screen, and television Michael Murphy in the role of Warren Worthington II, creator of the ""cure"" for the mutant gene.

The dialogue is equal to the second and superior to the first.  Special effects are outstanding, especially of Magneto shifting The Golden Gate Bridge and Dark Phoenix's (Famke Janssen) assault on Alcatraz in San Francisco Bay.

The action is crisp and each actor does get his/her ""moment,"" no matter how brief.

There are a few complaints: the absence of Jim Cummings' marvelous ""Nightcrawler"" and the beautiful Rebecca Romijn's early departure from the story line.  Both actors deserved better than this, after their impressive turns in the first two films.

Also, the inevitable battle between ""Ice Man"" (Shawn Ashmore) and ""Pyro"" (Aaron Stafford) was a bit of a letdown, lasting less than a minute, in my estimate.

7682230,3,B01CE00Q5C,"I have been a big fan of the X-Men juggernaut from comic books to tv series. The first two X-Men films directed by Bryan Singer were surprisingly entertaining and captured the essence of the X-Men. Brett Ratner did not with the third X-Men film X3: The Last Stand. The general premise of the film revolves around a 'cure' for mutants created by Warren Worthington III's father. I couldn't help but draw comparison between this storyline with the ex-gay movement Exodus which claims to cure homosexuality. I think it would be difficult not to see this comparison between the Exodus movement and this cure to treat mutants and get rid of what humans perceived as to be a sickness. This 'cure' quickly stirs up strong emotions with Magneto and the Brotherhood as well as Charles Xavier and his X-Men, especially Storm, and eventually the two sides has one last final showdown.

I admit I was pretty much entertained by the film but it was all flash and not a lot of substance. While I appreciated the fact that the screenwriters incorporated glimpses of the dark phoenix storyline where Jean Grey comes back to life but as a darker, more powerful character but for the most part the writing was mediocre at best. The writers totally veered away from the heart and soul of the comic book series. I didn't like seeing a few of the major characters be written off so quickly. The dialogue was extremely cheesy, more so than the previous X-Men films.

What I did like was seeing a bit more of Colossus, one of my favorite X-Men characters (although not enough), more screen time for Halle Berry as Storm, the opening sequence where the young students are in danger room being trained in combat, and the special effects.

In this day and age of DVDs you expect more than a few deleted scenes and commentary from the producers and/or directors.

Here's some samples: When Magneto and the doc are confronting Phoenix and it all hits the fan, the sliding doors are open. Next cut they are closed, and for the remainder of the scene. Yet when Wolfy is crawling along the ceiling towards the doors, they are open, close, open, closed.  Really sloppy editing there!

When Magneto moves the bridge, it's the middle of the day. When the bridge hits land, minutes later, it's night.  All the vehicles were abandoned (except one) and tossed around like crazy, especially when Magneto clears the path through the cars.  Yet whenever we see the same section of bridge in distance shots..... 1) all the cars are in nice, neat rows. 2) All the car's headlights lights are on.  Neither is possible in the context of the movie, even ignoring the fact that day became night in under 5 minutes.

Logan gets two gut injuries from the horn tossin' dude.  He heals. So does his t-shirt - because in the next scene, the holes are missing.

When Logan is getting abused by Magneto at Alcatraz, he switches position between cuts. While lying down. While pinned.

The section of bridge broken away would not span the gap from the mainland to the island.

When I purchased X-Men - The Last Stand (Stan Lee Collector's Edition) I was under the impression that there were alternate endings in this special presentation DVD .  I concluded that this meant, more than one version of the movie was on this special edition dvd --that cost approximately $10.00 more than the regular dvd standard version.  In essence, isn't that what Alternate ending suppose to mean?

Well, in the Marvel World it seems ""Alternate ending"" means ""deleted scenes"". Scenes that never made it to the big screen.  There is only ONE movie on this dvd and a few deleted scenes with a crappy comic book that is suppose to justify the reason to charge you $10.00  more.

Good things about the movie included some terrific interaction between Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan and a superb performance by Famke Jannsen, who had been underutilized in the previous films. Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry turn in their usual good performances. There are some flaws--the introduction without explanation of the character who can go through walls, and for all the hoopla about Angel, he actually played a very small part in the movie. I also understand that those who have followed the series in the comic books have a lot of complaints about discrepancy between the movie and the comics.

But, after viewing the film, I was pleasently surprised. ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is, without a doubt, the best ""X-Men"" film so far. It has a great combination of action, visual effects, acting and storytelling that bring the series to a fantastic, probable conclusion, although it does hint at the possibility of future films in the franchise!

I liked the addition of all the new characters, but I believe it may have prevented some of the story development.  After watching ""Last Stand"" I would really like to see a 4th X-Men movie, but believe there will only be spin-off movies (Wolverine, Magneto).

7682255,3,B01CE00Q5C,"When the development plagued Superman Returns finally got off the ground thanks to X-Men and Usual Suspects director Bryan Singer, the reins had to be passed to Brett Ratner, director of Rush Hour films and Red Dragon. Many people gave a sigh of disappointment since Ratner is less a director than more a ""session player"" that musicians use in the studio. What made the previous films work was that not only were they great comic book movies, they were just simply great movies with action scenes as well as some deeper issues and meanings. X-Men 3 became what the series shouldn't have been: a blockbuster and nothing more.

The main inspiration for the film is the ""Dark Phoenix"" saga, arguably one of the most-well known and best sagas in Marvel's history. Jean Grey has been brought back to life after her death in X2 only she seems...changed. She seems a bit more uninhibited and carries a bit of a mean streak. Meanwhile, scientists at Worthington Labs have developed a cure of the mutant gene and are planning to allow willing mutants to take it and be ""normal"". Of course this infuriates Magneto and he establishes the Brotherhood, a group of mutants who are going to stop the cure no matter how.

One complaint that's always been in the X-Men films is the sheer number of characters. Unlike the comics where you can actually do an arc on one character alone, here they jampack it with a whole bunch of characters that it's kind of overwhelming. In addition to X2's cast (besides sorely-missed Nightcrawler), we have Juggernaut, Callisto, Quill, Angel, Beast, Multiple Man and Kitty Pryde. Hell, I think they even added in Psylocke and some others not even mentioned. It ends up making an already big cast bloated. Not to mention certain characters react differently than before and an off-screen death is just inexcusable.

The anticipated notions of an X-Men movie tend to be scenes exclusively related to a character. Whether it's fight scenes like Wolverine vs Lady Deathstrike or the Nightcrawler attack on the White House, it's also geeky to see a scene of fights and mayhem. This film certainly has it from a small-but-cool cameo of a Sentinel to a big fight involving a house and the epic finale, it's certainly great to see things in a bigger proportion. Only problem is the scenes don't have an emotional resonance, it's just ""time to see some computer-y stuff"".

If you manage to be a fan of this, is this worth buying? Depends if you want special features. All we have are alternate endings, deleted scenes and pat-on-the-back commentaries. If you're looking for some in-depth stuff, you'd best look to the eventual double-dip.",1161302400,2,2647,4.836644591611479

7682272,3,B01CE00Q5C,"I am reviewing this movie not from a purely film critic's point of view, nor am I a rabid X-Men comic book fan. No, I am more of a longtime fan of the 1990s Fox Channel cartoon series. With that bias-ness in mind, I have to say, even in animated form, this movie still wouldn't work.

Having followed the cartoon series for more than four years, it more or less covered the popular themes of the comics such as the creation of Sentinels, each X-Men's roots of origins, the Savage Lands, the Phoneix/Dark Phoneix saga. Whatever Bryan Singer had built up as a momentum for the 1st two movies, Brett Ratner prematurely ""[...]"" it all in this movie. I know that Ratner was brought in as a last minute replacement, and the core of the problems lies with the script and the Fox executives behind it.

Seeing that all franchises should end as a trilogy (Star Wars, Indiana Jones), in all their infinite wisdom, the Fox executives decided to throw every possible thing they got in this final movie in the franchise, thus ""The Last Stand"". Too much cooks doth spoil the broth, as the saying goes. Let's take a closer look at the casting:
1. Halle Berry looks better here, I admit. But does she have to be the central character now? Let's face it, she can't act here.

2. Kelsey Grammer as The Beast. Wonderful casting choice. Unfortunately, he participated in just one battle. We need more ""beast"" moves and fight scenes here!

3. Alan Cumming not returning as the cheeky German Nightcrawler? Uh-oh...not a good sign.

Even though I am not the final authority on the X-Men comic universe, but I can safely vouch for the fact that the Dark Phoneix subplot was treated with an utter sense of contempt and disrespect. The Dark Phoneix saga should provide the backdrop for an entire X-Men movie! The pacing is so uneven, as if Ratner couldn't wait to get to the action sequences. Talk about ADD! He's worst than a high school kid on speed. He should be injected with Ritalin.

With a reported budget of US$210 million dollars, I don't see where the money had gone to. The subtitle of the movie states it is ""The Last Stand"". The last battle at the end was alleged to be an all-out war as advertised and stated by the characters in the movie. To me, it's just a mere skirmish. An all out X-Men war would involve Magneto, X-Men combined with Cable, Bishop, etc. against Apocalypse in a futuristic setting. Now, that's really ""The Last Stand""!

I'm sorry, Fox executives. If you are going to piss that sort of money on a hack like Ratner, while curbing Singer's creativity and balking at his lower than original budget, you have lost a creative pool of talent and a franchise at the same time.

Oh yes, I forgot to mention that this movie should be known as The Wolverine and Storm Show.

P.S. Angel was never in an X-Men uniform in the movie at all. Never. I nearly died laughing when I saw the cover of the DVD.",1161129600,6,2897,4.492395437262357

THE ALTERNATE ENDINGS ARE NOT ENDINGS. They are post credit endings, that would replace or go along with the original. They last just as long. When I heard that this had THREE alternate endings, I couldn't wait to buy it. Man was I dissapointed.

7682274,3,B01CE00Q5C,"How much does a director really influence a film? Bryan Singer bailed on the X-Men franchise (to make the underwhelming Superman Returns), and fans collectively howled at the hiring of Brett Ratner to helm this pivotal installment. But it's really NOT THAT BAD of a film. I will state three small problems with the film; SPOILERS GALORE, people!

1 From the beginning, it's a tease. We have the X-gang in the danger room. Cool. We even have Colossus launch Wolverine for a ""fastball special"". Right out of the comic, cool. At what is he being launched? A light that's attacking them. He then scissors off and throws down a Sentinel's head, all off camera. So once again, we don't get to see the Sentinels in an X-Men film. Probably too costly to bring to the screen, or it was either them or the Golden Gate Bridge scene.

2 Some characters have virtually nothing to do, like Rogue. Some characters are introduced to merely move the story along, like Angel. And one major character is killed offscreen, inexplicably. That major character deserved WAYYY better than that.

3 Some of the acting is plain hammy, even for these movies. Even the usually reliable Hugh Jackman has some shaky moments. I realize, it's comic book derived material, not Shakespeare. But maybe the bad acting signals Ratner's directing influence, maybe not.

Things I did like about this film: the characters they added just plain rock! Kelsey Grammar as Beast, Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut, and a cute new actress playing Kitty / Shadowcat. It's good casting all around. And the script is really over the top, overstuffed with action and plot. There's something going on at almost all times, unlike the ponderous quality of Singer's X-Men, and the special effects are eye popping. And there are many great memorable moments (Iceman Vs. Pyro, Kitty Vs. Juggernaut, Mystique: cured and naked). What I don't understand is why they were bent on making this the last one--maybe they thought it was too expensive or logisically difficult to get this massive cast together. Hopefully they make more X-films, as this one was a box office smash. Keep them coming, keep up the quality, and the fans will be there.",1160956800,,2175,4.8544474393531

If I was rating just the movie, it would get a solid four stars.  But rating the DVD requires taking into account all the special features they did NOT include, but are holding out for a later edition.  Does Fox not understand that it is insulting to the consumer to hear on the DVD Director's Commentary track about all the goodies that are going to be included on the DVD but are not?  And there is really nothing about the Stan Lee edition that makes it worth the extra cost.

Back to the movie -- one can take exception with a lot of the choices made but, overall, it's a good time.  Some things -- like the virtual absence of Cyclops, Rogue and Nightcrawler -- were apparently due to the fact that the actors were involved in other projects and only available for a short time.  Unlike other reviewers, I didn't miss Nightcrawler at all, since he got very tedious very quickly in X-2.  Other choices were the obvious result of the fact that Brett Ratner has the artistic sensibilities of a 13-year-old.  Some of the dialog is just atrocious.  (Wolverine's pep talk to the X-Men as they head into battle is enough to make once feel embarrassed for Hugh Jackman.  Despite his incredible talent, even he can't bring it off without sounding ridiculous.)  Halle Berry is (as others have said here) as wooden as she was in the first two movies.  Famke Janssen has two really terrific scenes, but spends most of the movie walking around as if she's catatonic.  Once Ratner and company set up the story of her immense powers, they were clearly stuck with the dilemma that, if she used her powers, it would obviate the need for the battle scenes with all the other mutants, which takes up a good third of the movie.  But they didn't bother coming up with any compelling reason why she is just standing on the sidelines for most of the film like a goth Barbie doll.  They could have expressed her inaction as the result of Jean Grey fighting to keep Phoenix in check, with Phoenix finally bursting free when under direct attack, but that would have taken the focus off Ratner's beloved CG effects.

Despite these flaws, the movie is not as good as X-Men or even X-2, but it is entertaining and somewhat emotionally satisfying, although not nearly as much as Ratner believes it to be (as he expresses on his commentary).  For all the special features that this disc SHOULD have come with, I guess fans will just have to wait for, and pay out for, the next release.  What a rip-off.",1160870400,2,2730,4.454728370221328

Total Score-31 out fo 50, Grade B-

Where the first two went for plot, acting, character development and mind messing, the third installment is pretty much just special effects and lots and lots of action. Now, I'm not saying thats a bad thing, but I must say I was a little spoiled by the first two, specifically the last half hour of X-men 2, that was incredible film-making. We get alot of new characters, but not alot of background info on them, no real inter-action by any of them, and thats a shame, some of them could have been real cool to expand on. One reviewer said there was to much Halle Berry, um, no such thing my friend, she is still drop-dead gorgeous and one of the better actors in this trilogy. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is still cool as ever, and Magneto and Xavier are still a blast to watch.

Now, the best part....As you may recall we lost Jean Grey at the end of 2, but good news, she's back, BIG TIME!!!! Problem is, she is sooooo powerfull she can't separate good from evil, and the battle scenes she has at the end are simply fantastic, if they decide to do a fourth, it would be wise to find a way to bring her back, definitely the coolest of all the X-men. Also, as mentioned earlier, there are tons of special effects, and most of them work, expertly shot with exceptional lighting really brings you head-on into the action, and Ratner uses it too perfection. Here's hoping for a fourth, but how about a little more character development. please?",1160784000,3,2157,4.844686648501362

In the compilation, only one is new, the remainder being old stories.  The CE package also includes the standard widescreen package, clamshell case and all.  It is EXACTLY the same.

7682297,3,B01CE00Q5C,"First off, I just want to say that I love this movie series and, to a lesser extent, this particular movie.  I've said from the moment I walked out of the theater after seeing it that the filmmakers could have EASILY added another hour or so to the length of the movie to make it fantastic.  And what's with the title?  Last Stand!  Come on, there are so many things they haven't covered yet:  Apocalypse, Sentinels, the Morlocks, and, as many others have been saying, Gambit and lots more of Angel.

Having said that, compared to a movie of this size and importance (and budget), this is a pretty bare-bones dvd, especially for a ""Collectors Edition.""  In fact, the only real difference between this and the regular widescreen version is that it comes with a little comic book (in fact it's a re-print of an old one-time X-Men comic that marks the additions of Wolverine, Storm, Colossus, Nightcrawler, and Thunderbird to the X-Men, but I hardly think that justifies spending an extra 4 bucks).

The one thing I noticed right off the bat that shocked me was that there is not a single behind the scenes featurette!  With all of the special effects and cool fight scenes in this movie, there should be at least a few really good featurettes.  Secondly, what the dvd does have, deleted scenes, alternate endings, and some other [...], are nothing really special.  Most of the deleted scenes are just slight variations of some scenes already in the movie (the extended version of the fight scene at Jean's house was pretty cool though) and the ""alternate endings"" are really disappointing.  Two are just short, alternate scenes that don't really conclude anything and the last one doesn't really make any sense (Spoiler:  Why in the world would Wolverine want to go back to Canada?).

How can they possibly call this a ""Collector's Edition"" if it's only one disc and has absolutely no featurettes!  They should have slowed down and taken their time with this one.  Come on, even Napoleon Dynamite had a 2 disc dvd set!",1160697600,4,2016,4.717142857142857
7682298,5,B01CE00Q5C,"I can't disagree more with the bad reviews people have written here about X-Men ""The Last Stand"", which is IMO the most exciting,and entertaining movie I have ever seen in years!.The cast, the special effects, the story, the action scenes,and everyhting else seems to work to make this the best of the X-Men Trilogy( I also liked the first two).I guess some reviewers are simply blind or have to hate X-Men to say the movie was boring, disappointing, or bad. I have seen lots of movies this year, but nothing compares and comes close to ""The Last Stand"".Although box office numbers are really good for this movie,X-Men ""The Last Stand"" should have attracted more people than the movies about pirates and cars. It is not fair. I am not a film critic or an expert ,and I am not an X-Men fan, either.

7682301,1,B01CE00Q5C,"I gave this movie one star because I thought the special effects were good.  I also think that Kelsey Grammer did a wonderful job in his portrayal of Hank McCoy/Beast/.  If it were not for these two factors I think giving this film one star would be difficult.  This is a movie that had potential, but ended up being a second or third rate action film.  If you love special effect and violence then this movie is for you, otherwise look elsewhere.

Now some people may think I am harsh, so here are some of my reasons for hating this movie.  First they kill off many main characters for no real reason.  Cyclopes is killed of early for no reason, other than to show that Jean Grey is now and evil psycho.  This was a major character in the first two movies, and after his death it is like he never even existed.

Then they kill off Professor X.  I am still trying to figure that one out.  One reviewer has said that it was to give Halle Berry a bigger role or she would not have done the movie.  Now I don't know if this is true but it is the only thing that makes sense.  My response is that if she wasn't happy let her go.  It is not a case where she did the role so well that you couldn't get someone to replace her.  I do not know why you would kill off the character of a really good actor like Patrick Stewart in favor of an overrated actress that thinks she is better than she is.  Her character had no real depth.  The pink and purplr hair didn't do the character any favors either

Another character they killed off was Mystique.  Now I thought that character was really interesting, and she was someone in the first two films I wanted to know more about.  Then they just get rid of her quick in this one.

As I mentioned earler, they turn Jean in to a murdering psycho.  When we saw her die in X2, I was hoping they would find a way to bring her back.  Now after seeing this film I wish they would have let her stay dead.  Her only purpose in the film was to murder people, and not say much.  By the time she dies at the end I don't really care.  This was a waste of a good character.

I also think they could have done more with the relationship between angel and his father.  I would have like to seen how saving his father helped change their relationship.

Lastly, this movie was way too predictable. I knew that when Professor X talked about Storm taking over someday that he was going to be killed.  I knew that Magneto would want to rule the world as he has in other films.  I knew that Iceman and Pyro were going to go one on one at the end after their exchange in the crowd of demonstrators.  I knew that when Storm asked Wolverine if he could do what needed to be done, that he would be the one to kill Jean in the end.

I could keep going, but I think I have got my point across.  This was just simply an awful movie.  I recommend that people rent it before they buy it, or you may discover that you wasted good money.",1160611200,4,2939,4.078671328671328
7682302,1,B01CE00Q5C,"I'm only writing this as a public service to anyone who may be checking in here before hitting the ""buy now"" button. I'm a comic book fan, a movie fan, and an X-Men fan; I loved the prior two installments on just about every level and I count comic book feature ""Batman Begins"" among the all-time great movies, period.

That said, this is a film that exists for only the lowest common denominator of movie-goer. Any essay on the correspondence between lowering IQs and rising low-brow entertainment should rightfully include this series of films. Where the first two were intelligent metaphors for the world in which we live, the third is a meaningless action sequence that serves as a backdrop to poor performances, weak dialogue and overwrought cliche. (Let me clear, it even fails as an action sequence - the opening night crowd I saw the film with were derisively hissing the bridge sequence by the films... er, ""climax."")

Where the first two greeted the audience with a knowing wink, the third merely throws garbage at the audience without regard to character development or plot. It's a confusing bore, and even if one attempts to care about the outcome, the silliness drives one to distraction.

If you've seen what Brett Ratner did to the ""Silence of the Lambs"" property, you can guess what he did to this one. Don't put yourself through it.",1160524800,6,1350,4.785407725321888
7682303,3,B01CE00Q5C,"X-men 3:  The Last Stand was really a movie with some interesting parts.  I loved the special effects and the variety of mutants on-screen.  What I didn't like was how quickly Cyclops (Scott Summers) and Professor Xavier died in this movie.  It didn't have any suspense or theatrical moments.  Cyclops didn't even fight.  Also mystique barely had any on-screen time as well.  All the main mutants from the previous movies have now taken a backseat and the roles have reversed where the side mutants in the other movies are now the main mutants in this movie.  Does that make sense?

Juggernaut was pretty cool, but he had an accent.  I didn't know juggernaut had an accent like he was from another country.  It would have been nice to see rogue fight, but she was being a pansy and wanted to rid herself of her abilities instead of using it to help her friends.

Bobby a.k.a. Iceman vs. Pyro was good although Iceman didn't go all ice until the last end of the fight where he was only like that for 2 seconds.  I would have liked to see him stay in that mode during the fight and maybe have pyro manipulate the fire better to have it take form or something.

Lastly, the ending didn't make sense.  If the movie is called ""the LAST stand"" why did they make the ending seem like it's open to another movie?  If they are gonna call it the last stand, it should stay as THE LAST STAND.

All in all...this movie was good, but not great.",1160524800,,1431,4.380228136882129
7682304,3,B01CE00Q5C,"Well I have been told this follows the comic book storyline. To bad. It is worth seeing but it lacks any of the fun that I saw in the first two movies. There is no lighthearted times in this movie. Usually in a trilogy the second movie is dark and the third movie starts that way but has a happy ending. There is no happy ending here, just a feeling of emptiness and loss. Is the action, effects, and story good? Yes they are in fact. So as I said before if you have caught the previous ones you will want to see it. However; this is not a standalone movie and won't make much sense without seeing the previous movies. Fans of the first two movies may be disappointed in the deaths of three key characters. If they had not killed off these characters and had a happier ending I think I know I would have enjoyed it more. And by the way the alternate endings are a joke. They are minor scene changes that were deleted, not a change to the ending itself. I was extremely disappointed that the alternate endings as they call them didn't have different outcomes. Preferably one that didn't kill off the characters. My guess is they had so many people disppointed in the movie they felt the only way to sell the DVD was to make people think they had alternate endings. I repeat there are no alternate endings on this DVD. It is just a ploy. So if you saw this at the theater and were disappointed, do not buy the DVD.

7682305,1,B01CE00Q5C,"I am quite pissed at Fox for this edition. I mean, up until now, there was a clear difference between standard editions and collector's editions, or so I thought... I used to believe that a collector's edition included all the extra bonus features one has the right to expect when he or she pays extra for it, especially for a movie like X-Men, no questions asked. I was obviously wrong, and I was charged with $20+ to learn that lesson.
It appears now that it has changed, with Fox at least, whose marketing guys use shameless tricks to get the cash. DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION! IT HAS ZERO BONUS FEATURE AND THE DVD IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE REGULAR CHEAPER ONE! It only contains a ""exclusive"" comic book that is rather crappy, and has no interest whatsoever. Either you do not care for bonuses, and in that case, get the widescreen edition, or you are an afficionado, and if so, do not make the same mistake I made: check out in details the description of the dvd before you buy anything. Again, this is NOT a collector's edition, and you can see miles away that the actual special edition or whatever they're gonna name it is coming up in no time.

7682307,2,B01CE00Q5C,"My husband and I love the first two installments of X-Men. We were in a Stuff Mart over the weekend, and I suggested buying X-Men 3. My husband asked ""Are you *sure*?"" I replied ""Well, we loved the first two installments. With Jean Grey returing as The Phoenix, it should be great!""

We watched it last night and were stunned. We were both silent--in shock--at the end of the movie.

SPOILER ALERT: Phoenix--resurrected Jean Grey--ends up killing Cyclops during a romantic tryst. You see, we weren't told something important in the first two installments: Xavier had to ""split"" Jean into two personalities to protect her from her own gifts. The purely instinctual, uncontrolled, subconscious part of her was ""The Phoenix"". The conscious, controlled, intellectual part was the Jean we knew from the first two movies.

If that isn't bad, she ends up disintegrating Xavier. Yes, the beloved Doctor and leader of the School for Gifted Youngsters goes out with a whimper.

Magneto takes this uncontrollable creature under his wings (?!). She mostly stands by looking blank (I think she was supposed to look menacing) until the final confrontation. After some of the mutants are neutralized with ""the cure"" (a serum derived from a mutant that reverses mutations) or destroyed--THEN Phoenix suddenly goes into action, disintegrating people and objects.

Wolverine says he's the only one that can stop her, because of his regenerative skills. Jean comes to her senses for a few seconds, and begs Wolverine to save her. Of course, he has to kill her to do so.

Storm--a lackluster Hallie Barry--ends up taking over the school and delivering a ho-hum eulogy.

There's so much wrong with this movie that I don't know where to start. I'll just mention a few:

1. Brett Ratner stinks as a director

2. Special effects, no matter how cool, are never a substitute for a strong plot and strong dialogue (unless you're just a mindless consumer of action flicks)

3. Magneto, played by Ian McKellan, wears his helmet almost the entire second half of the movie. If you recall, he wore this helmet to stop the thoughts of Xavier from infiltrating and influencing his mind. Why, then, did Magneto continue to wear his helmet after Xavier was annihilated?

4. If Xavier was going to die, he deserved a better send off than having his protege having a cosmic tantrum and destroying him

5. Why is Logan/Wolverine smiling up at the sky, school campus awash in sunshine and colorful flowers, when he's lost his father figure and had to kill the woman he loves--in effect losing her TWICE?

6. Bobby (Ice Boy) begins to get cozy with the Girl Who Can Walk Through Walls. There is little interaction between he and Rogue (poor Anna Paquin hardly gets any air time!)--and Rogue knows Bobby is cozy with the other chick. Yet, she takes the cure to rid her of her mutant powers so she can touch/kiss Bobby? Maybe--but GEEZ. Weren't enough mutants already killed or neutralized?!

So we have Mystique neutralized (she's a mere human), as is Magneto and Rogue. Xavier is dead, as is Jean Grey and Cyclops. Storm is in charge of the school, Wolverine is hunky dory with the way everything has turned out, and the mutants and humans are now united--living happily ever after.

For crying out loud!!

The only good thing about this movie was the special effects and some cool mutants like ""Tin Man"" (can't remember his real name), the blue fur guy, Juggernaut (very cool!), Angel Boy (also cool) and a kid who sprouts spikes.

However, that's not enough to save this movie. We were so disgusted that I'm going to list this movie on Amazon for sale right after I write this review. (We didn't even want to explore the extras or alternative endings!)

What a waste of EXCELLENT acting talent. (That is, Ian McKellan, Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, and Anna Paquin.)

Whoever agreed to hand this debacle over to Brett Ratner should be excommunicated from Hollywood--as should Ratner himself and whoever wrote this lacklaster script.

1. What could have been one of the best of the bunch had they considered sticking even close to the origonal story gets almost entirely re-written and turned into one long movie promo clip.

2. Halle Berry beefed about not getting enough lines\screen time so they completely changed her character around. Wolverine is popular, so he also gets loads of screen time. Except for Ian, the rest of the cast pretty much could have been CGI.

3. SPOILER- The kill off Cyclops and Prof. X (sort of) and leave Phoenix alive. What could have kept life in the X-Men movie series has been pretty much deep-sixed. You know Berry will not be back for another one; so why pander to her demands on this one and mess with the story?

7682311,2,B01CE00Q5C,"Yea Yea i know, probably not what you wanted to hear and it doesn't agree with a number of others that say that Last Stand was a monument of cinematic greatness. Truth of the matter is, it wasn't... Plain and simple. This movie was just another example of a man (Stan Lee) who takes a great idea (the comic book movie franchise) and simply bastardizes the concept toward an end of making the all mighty dollar, at the expense of the fans, that have helped make him the billionaire that he is today; knowing that due to his having legions of fans looking forward to the sequel, he realizes that he can put out any old piece of lukewarm unimaginative garbage, and people will scarf it down like Starr Jones at a Fried Chicken buffet (sadly this concept was mastered by George Lucas but i won't get sidetracked on my feelings on him and Star Wars).

You might ask where does the shortcoming of this movie reveal itself? Well, being an action movie loving buff, had someone told me character development was important to the flow of a movie, id have told them ""Oh shove it bookworm, all i need is some explosions, violence and action, and ill be happy"". Well, let me tell ya, Last Stand has made me a believer. When you can take some of my favorite characters (i.e. Wolverine and Professor X)and make them boring, clearly someone has done something horribly wrong. Word is, Halle Berry complained over all the time Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) got in the past movies, and declared to get more time in this sequel (or she'd walk), which she got. Yet, once again we watch as Berry gives lukewarm acting, as Storm is continually slapped around like Mike Tyson versus a thirteen year old girl.

Much like the other X-Men movies i could go into how Stan skews off the true storyline of the comic (but needless to say we all know he's done that in every installment of every comic movie he's made) so i won't bore you with things you already know (this pattern is once again repeated in Last Stand).

Yes the special effects are great, the story good (there is a new Vaccine that when injected can allegedly cancel the mutant gene and turn mutants into regular powerless humans). Yet, the movie plays out like a tragic soap opera leaving you at the end feeling betrayed and disappointed. I won't tell you the X-Men that get killed off so as to leave some surprise to you the viewer. However, one of those killed you probably won't care about, the other, hell was already dead, and the other, for all intensive purposes is and always will be the heart of the X-Men, thus making killing him completly incompetent.

And yea I know as i write this you're thinking I'm a jerk, and will likely watch it if for nothing else..... closure. So enjoy, if you can... I personally will be looking forward to the New X-related movies that are in production (movies about Wolverines and Magneto's Beginnings)... and will pray that Stan Lee will not do to them what he has done to my once beloved X-Men.",1160265600,6,2973,4.520446096654275
7682312,4,B01CE00Q5C,"In the last 5 years one genre has returned from almost certain death to become one of Hollywood's most lucrative source for movie material, that genre is that of the superhero, or comic book genre as it is commonly referred to.  Several franchises have been successfully established within this revived genre, some standouts would be the 'Spiderman' movies, ""Fantastic Four"", ""Batman Begins"", and the 'Blade' trilogy.  One franchise has stood out from all the others by taking the focus of the comic book film away from being only on a few key characters, instead focused on an entire team of heroes.  This set of movies is of course the 'X-Men' franchise.  After 2 highly successful trips to the box office with ""X-Men"" and ""X2: X-Men United"" (both with Bryan Singer at the helm), Fox Studios decided to return to the world of mutants to wrap up their superhero trilogy.  With this decision made the execs at Fox immediately began working on deals with the cast and with director Bryan Singer; the entire cast returned for this supposed 'final' installment into the 'X-Men' franchise, but sadly director Bryan Singer was enticed to jump ship and head to Warner Brothers to direct another little-known superhero movie called ""Superman Returns"".  With the cast signed and the director M.I.A., Fox scrambled to find a replacement, leaving many to be skeptical about the quality of the film's script, because Bryan Singer had directed the first two movies and suddenly jumped ship, is it possible that the reason for this change of heart was because of a poorly written script?  The answer would, in the end, turn out to be no.  The reason Singer left the series he had started was simply that he had always wanted to direct a 'Superman' movie, and he had an opportunity that he couldn't pass up.  So to replace Singer, Fox chose veteran director Brett Ratner (""Rush Hour 1 & 2"" and ""Red Dragon"").  The decision to have Ratner at the helm of such a high profile movie that was to serve as the final chapter in an incredible trilogy, caused many to be uneasy, especially since Ratner had at one point been picked by Warner Brothers to direct the newest 'Superman' movie, but in the end the movie was released and Ratner quickly showed all the nay-sayers that he was the right replacement for the job.

""X-Men: The Last Stand"" begins with the creation of a new 'cure' for mutancy, allowing those beings with powers to choose whether they wanted to keep their powers and remain mutants or take the cure and become normal human beings.  This 'cure' quickly becomes a focus for the mutant race, and becomes central to the war that is brewing between Magneto's (Sir Ian McKellan) 'Brotherhood of Mutants' and Professor Charles Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) X-Men.  With mutants being divided as to how to choose regarding the topic of the cure, the battle lines are quickly being drawn, and the war is about to begin!

Brett Ratner chose wisely (in my opinion) to not focus on a story dealing solely with the 'cure' for mutants, but mixing it with the ramifications of the resolution to ""X2: X-Men United"" when Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) became the 'Phoenix'.  This provided some very intense moments for the cast especially for Hugh Jackman's character Wolverine, as he is being forced to choose whether to fight against the woman he loves, possessed as she is by the Phoenix, or allow her to destroy the only people he's ever been able to call friends and family, the X-Men.  The cast, as they have been in the previous installments, was amazing, even the newcomers Kelsey Grammer (Beast), Vinnie Jones (Juggernaut) and Ben Foster (Angel) fit right in, as if they'd been members of the cast since the first movie.  The action, I would have to say, is the most intense out of all the 'X-Men' movies, it is so intense and fast-paced that you actually have to see everything more than once to fully take it all in.  The special effects work is by far the best out of the franchise as well, not that the first 2 movies were anything to sneeze at, but the moving of the Golden Gate Bridge alone is worth the price of admission.  Many critics, and even some fans, felt that the movie lacked in story, and that the film should have focused solely on Jean Grey becoming the Dark Phoenix, as I said before I disagree with this sentiment on the grounds that there have been two previous films to establish all the backstory needed, making more room for bigger and more explosive action than you had seen prior.  Generally speaking a trilogy's third part serves as a tying up of all the loose ends that had been left over from previous installments and to really up the stakes for the main characters, and in this ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" succeeds in a most impressive way!  Could there have been more story, sure there's always room for more, but it doesn't hurt the movie by not having the extra exposition, in fact it made the movie feel tighter because it was simply building off of the previous two and not really looking to expand the story all that much, but really just trying to wrap things up, which is the point of a final part in a trilogy.  But no matter what I say or any other critics say about this movie, in the end it's all about what you think of the movie, agree or disagree, it's your opinion that matters on whether you like the movie or not, we're just here to help by providing our feedback.  So, sit back, relax, and enjoy this 'final' installment in the 'X-Men' movie franchise.

""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sensuality.",1160179200,2,5561,4.651020408163265
7682313,5,B01CE00Q5C,"I've seen all three X-Men movies and read the Dark Phoenix saga when it appeared in comics back in the 1980's. So, when the movies started picking up that storyline, I naturally expected them to stick with something along the lines of that basic plot. The Last Stand doesn't. It actually comes up with a scenario that is grimmer, grittier, and ultmately more tragic than what is presented in the comics (since Jean Grey's death was never actually finaly, that storyline's impact was diminished gradually anyway).

This actually is the best of the three X Men movies, and a fitting conclusion to the saga. X-men purists will dislike the way some of their favorite characters are treated (and I would have liked to have seen more of Rogue, Cyclops, Colossus and Jubilee myself), but the storyline moves quickly is so compelling that it's like a freight train. I've rarely seen a movie these days where you are so fixated on what happens next that you can't take your eyes off of it.  There are a lot of special effects in the movie, but I disagree with the notion that it is all about special effects.  It's about people, where they try and where they fail, and I'm impressed that the movie took a more realistic look at them than tried to tack on a cheap happy ending to it.

About the extras, there aren't many, and that would be my one major gripe. The deleted scenes don't particularly add of detract from the movie, whether they would have been included or not.  I imagine the behind the scenes documentaries are waiting for the special edition.

Great movie, and one of the most brilliantly tragic comic book adaptions you will ever see.",1160179200,4,1641,4.621993127147766
7682314,1,B01CE00Q5C,"One word to sum up this movie is hollow. The personal investments and inner pain of all the characters is severed in a under impressive action packed disaster. Everyone's motivation and inner issues can be explain in less than one thought bubble. The audence no longer has to think, see the emotional journey continue from the previous films...(Or any emotional journey at all) or really care about any of the X-Men. Many of them stand around and do nothing to move the plot forward and just mash things when THe time calls.(This goes for many of the important characters of 1 and 2.)

THe original message of the fight for understanding and equality takes a back seat to wild and untamed action with two very thin plot lines. Its all just a uninteresting down hill plumet into a huge final battle in which no charatcer really develops any further.

 Magneto falls into the void of the ""Typical"" Bad Guy. He is no longer a scarred man fighting savagly because of his fear of what tomorrow may bring. You can't identify with him. He is a Megalomaniac without a soul. No longer the cool shade of grey character.

The scenes only purposes are to bridge the gap between fight scenes and noone ever has anything insightful or dramatic to say save Magneto's speech in the Church which sounds hacked to pieces anyway.

Any Characters whos powers are not by nature destructive is written out of the story or killed off. Save Kitty Pride who serves only to break up Bobby and Rogue and has no REAl storyline at all. cyclops is written out VERY quickly to let Logan be Jeans #1 guy.

save yourselves the money for when a Special Edition of X-2 decides to come out

7682316,1,B01CE00Q5C,"If I could pick one word to decribe X3, it would be ""unmotivated"". There are events and actions in the movie that totally betray not only the first two films, but in and of themselves do nothing to advance the plot of the movie. Others are completely inexplicable. I'm going to phrase these events in a series of ""WHY"" questions.

1. Why was Alkali Lake covered in a fog so dense when Wolverine and Storm arrived that they couldn't even see each other? Did this advance the plot somehow or make the floating rocks seems that much more dramatic because they were hidden or was it an attempt to have Halle Berry get more ""I am powerful; look at me act"" time?

2. Why did Jamie Maddrox join Magneto? Poor guy was locked up in a solid metal box and missed Magneto whole speech about Mutant Freedom but his first words after ebing freed were not ""Who are you and how did you get me out of this prison?"" but rather ""I'm in! Sign me up!"" How did he know what he was signing up for or if signing up was even an option?

3. Why didn't someone tell Juggernaut he was wearing a melted tin can on his head?

4. Why couldn't Magneto keep his character straight? This guy changed his tune and his rationales every few seconds. Is he saddened by Charles' death or is he happy that the competition is gone? He's against the cure but has no problem declaring that ""Any mutant who stands in our way, we will use the cure against them!"" He abandons Mystique in a government prison vehicle after she's changed to a human and doesn't even suspect that she (as his right-hand mutant) would be pissed enough to give him up to the said government. Set aside for a moment that Mystique rescued him in X2, shouldn't he, as a Holocaust survivor, have had pity towards her instead of blaming the victim?

5. Why was that crappy Phoenix origin allowed to go forward? And why after Bryan Singer (who needs to marry me) took such loving care to give use the Phoenix as the closing image of X2 was there not even a HINT of fire around Jean in this movie?

6. Why did twenty minutes elapse in the movie before anyone even started asking questions or speculating about what happened to Scott? Moreover, why did Professor X (who died AFTER Scott did (ostensibly - we never saw Scott's body)) have a funeral AND a gravestone AND an eternal flame burning while Scott had NOTHING to mark his death, not even a gravestone? (It begs the question here to ask ""Why did Scott die?"")

7. Why the coarse language, up to and including the legendary and completely inappropriate, ""I'm the Juggernaut, BITCH!!!""

8. Why did Professor X say to Logan, ""I warned you.""? When did this warning happen? In what way was Jean's waking up and dry humping Wolverine not only HIS FAULT but also something Prof X warned him about?

9. Why did Magneto use his powers to turn a simple doorknob?

10. When Magneto tells Juggernaut, ""No one gets in (to the Grey residence),"" why does Juggernaut throw Wolverine in through the window during their fight?

11. Why did Kitty say she missed home and the ""first snow (of Chicago)""? She lives in Westchester, NY!!! It snows there ALL the time!!! It's not like they moved the mansion to Boca Raton.

12. Why did Jean look lobotomized the whole time? Yes, the Dark Phoenix effect to her face was the highlight of the movie, but it only happened twice. Where is her ""rage"", her ""passion"" that Magneto spoke of? And really why was she with Magneto? If someone had give her a line like, ""You're beneath me, but this drama may be of some amusement. So, play on, little ants but God help you if you bore me."" (yeah, ok, that;'s bad...), but SOMEthing to explain why she just stood there.

13. What was it about the Angel that resolved Storm to keep the school open after she three seconds before basically was locking the doors? Aren't ALL the students in need of a safe place? (yeah, I know , that's a ""what"" question)

14. When Magneto announces that ""enough mutant blood has been spilt already"" as a threat to the human.. uhm, the last incident of violence against mutants was Pyro blowing up a clinic for mutant wanting the cure. It was a very President Bush thing to do.

15. WHY OH WHY did Magneto have to move the entire Golden Gate Brige to get to Alcatraz? Was it so he could say the line, ""Charles always did want me to build bridges?"" Why not just make a metal disk for everyone to fly over on? He did it in X2. I kow it's the ""money shot"" so to speak - the opening declaration of war on th\e humans, but it lacked the finesse I've come to expect form Magneto.

16. Why did the sun take about 3 seconds to set?

17. Why did Rogue disappear for the second half of the movie?

18. How did Warren manage to fly from NY to SF only about 20 minutes behind the X-Jet? And why did Warren who from all descriptions hated his wings, suddenly decide to keep them? (right - a ""how"" question :))

19. Why did Leech just suddenly disappear from the movie? What happened to him?

20. And finally (another ""how"" question) HOW OH HOW did mutants and humans suddenly become friends again after all those horrible deaths on Alcartraz?? The end was right up there with Starship Troopers - thousands of people dead, their best friends eaten or used as bug incubators, an entire way of life almost destroyed and the closing line ON THE BATTLEFIELD is ""Good things happen when the three of us are together!"" WTF?

If someone can help me with answers here, I'd love to hear them. I'm sad. I mean actually, physically let down and saddened by the movie. AND before I hear the words ""fanboy"" and ""thirty years of history"" and ""canon"", let me say I know that to do the ""fundie literalist"" version of the Phoenix story would have been impossible BUT Bryan Singer departed from the ""mainstream"" X-Men story so it IS possible to do a good movie without slavishly following the text. My point is that this doesn't even follow the continuity of the previous two movies nor does it follow its own continuity.

About the DVD itself, the 10 delected scenes are all under 20 seconds each (most under 10) and the three alternate ending have nothing to do with Phoenix, but are rather ""alernate closings"" - the final image of the movie as the music swells and the lights come up.  All very disappointing.

I saw the prior xmen films and i was most satisfied with this offering.  Not a dull moment in this film.  I wish i could have seen more of Rogue but of course she got the ""cure""

Spoiler*

I loved how at the end of the credits we see Xavier's concience (phsycic) going off to his ""in-coma, dead brain"" twin brother.  I am just upset that the people who wrote the script insisted on making it his twin brother when in fact true fans of the series know that it was really his twin SISTER NOT brother.",1160092800,2,610,4.2155172413793105
7682318,4,B01CE00Q5C,"""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (X3) is the third installment of the X-Men films which satisfied and disappointed many fans of the series as well.  Personally, I really enjoyed seeing the film in theaters and was satisfied with the movie overall.  However, I do have to say that although I enjoyed the movie, it certainly did not meet its potential for numerous reasons.

Here are some of the positives about the movie.  First, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, and Patrick Stewart once again did a great job with their roles.  Ditto for Halle Berry and Kelsey Grammar as Storm and Beast.  Next, the action scenes provided non-stop excitement and drama.  In addition, the plot provided much intrigue with mutants being able to decide whether to take the cure or remain a mutant.  This particular storyline was great in the animated series with Dr. Adler (Apocalypse) and did justice for the movie as well.

Where the movie falls a little short is the character development.  For example, Ratner never really develops the mini love triangle between Kitty, Rogue, and Bobby.  But Ratner's biggest blunder is not putting the necessary focus on the Phoenix storyline.  This was an immensely popular storyline in the comic books as well as the animated series and certainly deserved more attention and screentime.  Also, the movie portrayed Wolverine as the only member of the X-Men who cared about Jean's turn to the dark Phoenix, which is simply not the case in the comics.  The X-Men teamed up in the comics with the goal of bringing Jean back to her normal self.  This should have and could have been done in this movie, especially since Ratner made the movie only 140 minutes.  Had he used half an hour more, he could have made this aspect more complete.

Some claim that there were too many deaths in the movie (i.e. Cyclops & Xavier) which is true to some degree.  Cyclops should have played a bigger role and not been killed off.  But I think Ratner added a lot of drama by killing Xavier (supposedly).  I certainly was stunned in the theater.

Overall, X3 was very good, but simply was not as good as it could have been.  The best movie of the series was X2, and any shortcomings of this film should be blamed on Brian Singer for foolishly leaving this series to do Superman.  X3 made more money and was much more important than Superman, which had been a dead franchise for years.  Don't get me wrong, I love Superman, but when you start something, finish it!

Bottom Line: Good movie, buy the DVD.  I would recommend getting the Stan Lee Collector's Edition ONLY if you want to get the bonus comic book.  Otherwise, the regular DVD has everything the Collector's Edition has.  Warning: A recent report said that about 60% of X-Men: The Last Stand DVD's had errors on them.  They all operate fine, but some people got 21 deleted scenes while others, like myself, only got 10.  I don't value the deleted scenes very much, but if you do, please note this fact.",1160092800,2,2949,4.669902912621359
7682319,4,B01CE00Q5C,"A worthy sequel in my opinion and no where near as bad as the critics would have you believe! Far superior than ""The Fantastic 4"" for example. Perhaps it isn't as good as X - Men 2 but I rate it higher than the first movie and it follows on from X-Men 2 very well.",1160092800,5,264,3.8181818181818183
7682320,3,B01CE00Q5C,"Again, this is a movie that is getting a thumping.  Most of it is pretty deserved.  The character development is hurried, the plot is thin, and there just seems to be a feeling of.....rushed work throughout.  How much of this should be planted on the director, Brett Ratner, is questionable.  He seems to have a respect for the work done previously by Bryan Singer, and when he's allowed to play with his favorite tools - action sequences - he shines.  Ratner's weaknesses are also prominently displayed - character development was never his forte, and this is coming from someone who LIKED his turn on ""Red Dragon.""  So who is to blame for the bad stuff?

With the above mentioned sense of rushed work, I guess I have to pin the blame on the man-who-wasn't-there, namely Bryan Singer.  There are rumors, with strong hints of being facts, that he bailed on this project in the middle of pre-production to work on ""Superman Returns.""  If this is indeed true, it shows.  ""X-Men, The Last Stand"" has the feeling of being script-doctored in mid-stream - that is, they had most of one man's vision in the can, but then needed another man to finish it as close to man one's vision as possible.  What we have left is just hints of what made the X-Men movie francise so great - real-world issues of prejudice and isolation - mixed with insanely maxed-out action that is the hallmark of another person, resulting in something that isn't exactly great, but isn't exactly bad either.  It's just.....frustratingly inconsistent.

What works...action, action, action.  If we hadn't the first two ""X-Men"" flicks, this would've been a happily decent popcorn movie.  Kelsey Grammar was way cool as Beast.  I hate to say it, but the deaths were poignant - let's face it, even Singer and his scriptwriters were having a difficult time making Scott Summers interesting - and  added some needed gravitas to the story.

The rest of the film?  A bit undone by the deux-ex-machina endings (yes, it's true; you need to sit through the credits for a feel-good surprise that will give any amatuer or professional film person a reason for remembering ""Mise-En-Scene"") and there really are WAY too many characters to keep count of.  Finally, there's the highly (even by comic book standards) implausible six-on-one-hundred-thousand ""Alamo Defense"" at the film's climax that will just plain leave you scratching your head.

But, and this is important, it's still an enjoyable little action film because it's a comic-book action film.  It doesn't have to be completely plausible.  It's nice to see our heroes prevail over (ridiculously high) adversity.  And not every part of a francise will be an out-of-the-ballpark winner.  Anyone remember Joel Schumacher's ""Batman And Robin""?  Does ""X-Men, The Last Stand"" look THAT atrocious by comparison?  No it doesn't.",1160092800,3,2830,4.953290870488322

Xaviers real fate is shown at the end of the credits.

Magneto obviously does not lose his powers if you watched this movie.

Now lets get into it.

The Good:

They handled the Phoenix saga as best they could. There was no way for them to tell the comic version so I can deal with the Hollwood-ization of it.

Iceman, Collussus, Kitty Pryde (for the limited time they have), Magneto

The alternate ending for Rogue

THE BAD:

Wolverine, Storm - For some reason their acting really suffers in this one. Wolverine is seen on his knees crying twice, once for Xavier and then again for Jean. Jean I could believe maybe but not the Xavier scene. It just didn't seem like it was Wolverine the character.

This seemed like the Wolverine and Storm power hour, there was a real lack of a team in this one.

Storms character is so far from what she should be.

Scott (Cyclops) the leader of the team is killed off. WHY?

Angel is a small sub plot

Mystique is wasted - by losing her powers

The Phoenix saga should have been the only focus and they should have left the whole mutant cure out.

Why, oh why did they make Juggernaut a mutant? He is not a mutant. And the actor portraying him was just bad.

7682338,5,B01CE00Q5C,"Loved it!!!! Having been an avid comic collector & being familiar with the original Phoenix saga, the director did a fabulous job translating/revising the story to work in a film medium. I admit I'm a bit of a snob when film directors take extreme liberties with original stroylines, origins, etc. (see  The Hulk) but in this case it worked great and made everything seem taht much more believable and grounded in reality.

The scenes with Jean Grey/Phoenix are INTENSE, even better than the comic.

Without giving too much away, when Dark Phoenix manifests and unleashes her power in various scenes, I actually got a lump in my throat. Some main characters die in this one!!...VERY intense, heavy & REAL subject matter. You really get a sense of the scale of pure evil that is Dark Phoenix.

*I wouldn't let any young kids watch this!!! Some ""Excorsist"" tinged moments mixed with the cosmic power gone awry element as with the original comic character. Very effective.

Juggernaut is great. Nice revamp of a great villain.

Kelsey Grammar is awesome as Beast. Perfect casting again.

There a lots of nods to pre-exisiting comic storylines throughout the movie...future X-men, Sentinels, fastball specials, etc. done very nicely.

The acting is fantastic. Hugh Jackman & Patrick Stewart give their best performances yet.

I always felt Halle Berry was the weak link in the previous X-men movies.

Halle Berry seems to (finally!!) get a handle on what Storm's character is about in this movie. A great performance.

Special kudos to Famke Janssen, who gave an extraordinary performance and really captured the pure evil/desperation of the JG/Phoenix character. Bravo!!!

The acting is key in this movie and really conveys a sense of reality, enhancing the already great special effects as well. The finale between Phoenix & Wolverine is especially intense, partially becasue of the effects, but more becasue of the emotion conveyed by the actors.

But, in true comic book fantasy style, the storyline pulls through.  The computer graphics are great in widescreen progressive scan.  And, Is it possible, could they make another?  The question was left open. As far as the Extras and the ""three alternative endings"", Well, they were a bit of a let down.  The actual ending at Alcatraz was never in question, it's just 3 different scenerios in the last sequence after the battle is over and school begins.  In all, they would not alter the story line much....unless they were going to make another film, although the current ending with Magneto leaves everything open. So check it out, good action movie.",1159920000,,1178,4.8059701492537314

I thought Kelsey Grammer was the perfect person to play Hank ""Beast"" McCoy as he is just as intelligent. they ought to have more characters from the cartoon series, such as Sabretooth and Toad, on a possible 4th movie. the movie had a bit of nudity in it, and that was when Mystique was hit with a ""cure"" dart and turned into a normal woman, but there was no frontal nudity involved.",1159920000,4,524,4.46875
7682343,4,B01CE00Q5C,"I have been reading the X-men comics since I was about 10 years old.  They are easily my favorite superheros of all time.  I loved the first two movies which were directed by Singer, but the third installment seemed to fall short of its predicessors.  The plot never seemed to develop.  Cool, a supposed cure for mutants.  But who was the kid that they got it from?  They never divulged that information.  Also, who were these bunch of ragtag mutants that Magneto recruited in New York?  Never heard of them.  Then there's Scott dying maybe fifteen minutes into the film, Jean suddenly becoming her evil counterpart, the Phoenix (who's storyline in itself was totally ignored, the professor dying, and a bunch of other crap.  First off, what happened to Nightcrawler?  He was in X2.  Rogue would never take a cure to get rid of her mutancy.  Plus the Juggernaut would have been alot bigger and he's not even a mutant!  And the Multiple Man was an X-man himself.  Plus they just used Collusus, Kitty, and Angle as filler characters.  So much more could have been done with this film.",1159920000,2,1082,4.645502645502646
7682344,4,B01CE00Q5C,"I bought the Collector's Edition of ""X3"" just because I'm a big fan and I didn't mind shelling out the extra dollars for the snazzy box and the nifty gifts. Well, the DVD comes in a nice box protected by a plastic sleeve with Wolverine's claw embossed on it. The box houses the DVD case with a nice little photo of the major characters in an ensemble shot. The comic is a little book with some reprinted X-stories and the much anticipated new story written by Stan Lee himself. Honestly, I don't plan on keeping the box or plastic sleeve. The comic is nice, though.

Then there's the DVD which was kinda disappointing. After ""X-Men 1.5"" and ""X2: X-Men United"" I was expecting a bus load of behind the scenes documentaries and interviews. Especially with this being the last film in the X-Men trilogy. The deleted scenes and commentary are good along with a hidden ""easter egg"" scene featuring Beast reciting Shakespeare to encourage his teammates before going to war (found in the ""Scene Select"" option). Also, the viewer has the option of choosing the style of the menu to reflect the Brotherhoods' personality or the X-Men's. Also has a sneak peek at The Simpsons Movie which was another welcome surprise. Overall, it's a pretty skimpy DVD that will probably be released in a double disc ""Ultimate Edition"" format in the future to further capitalize on the X-Franchise.....""X-Men: The Second To Last Stand"" anyone?

For those who don't know the plot it's basically three challenges for the X-Men to deal with in their latest adventure: the creation of a ""cure"" drug that can supress the mutant gene permanently, the aggressive response to the drug by Magneto and his new Brotherhood, and Jean Grey comes back from the dead in the guise of her malevolent alter ego Phoenix. The movie is a step above the typical summer blockbuster yet it lacks the sleek, sci-fi flavored, ""less is more"" style used in the first two films. The story also suffers from plot-overload. The Phoenix, Magneto's Brotherhood and The Cure are just too much for one movie and it shows. So, for action and blockbuster fans this is definitely a must have. And X-Fans will get a nice buzz from seeing some of their requests fulfilled such as an airborne Storm, Beast as a major character, and a Danger Room sequence.

Though I highly doubt this will be the last X-Men film it is an ambitious finale to a unique and memorable trilogy.",1159920000,11,2404,4.719047619047619
7682345,3,B01CE00Q5C,"Never a fan of the comic book hero outings, this viewer watched X-MEN - THE LAST STAND with a bit of mental prejudice: action heroes capable of destroying everything in sight at the glance of a weird eye or the motion of a hand have just never seemed entertaining.  But given that stance, watching this very colorful film was an art study in how far computer generated graphics have come in a relatively short time. And that makes the time spent on the non-story worthwhile.

Of course it is always a pleasure to see Sir Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Rebecca Romijn, James Marsden, Patrick Stewart, and the newly buff Ben Foster in action: nice costume effects despite overdone makeup etc.  But the story is so slim that it can be ignored and the viewer can watch the rather extraordinary special effects - until they ultimately wear thin (as when the house lifts off the ground, etc!).  So advice for those fellow viewers who avoid these Marvel Comic movies: drop the prejudice long enough to see what is au courante in special effects.  It is rather entertaining...for a while.

7682346,2,B01CE00Q5C,"X-Men: The Last Stand gets a new director, and it is Brett Ratner, the inconsistent, some times over the top director, whose only really strong film was 2002's Red Dragon (in which he also directed the third part of a trilogy, and also taking it from the previous two's director, Jonathan Demme).  Ratner seems to want to make his own version, so the first thing he does is give many of the previous films' characters the backseat.  And by previous characters, I mean really important ones.  Cyclops, Rogue (who seemed to be the main character of the first), and even Professor Xavier.  Moving these characters out of the way, he seems to focus his attention on Wolverine and Storm.  This puzzled me, because, don't we already know everything about Wolverine?  Why make him the main character, when there are so many more interesting people; Hank McCoy for instance.  And why make Storm the main character?  If Ratner wanted to do this, he should at least give background information about her past.  At the beginning of the trilogy, we know nothing about Storm, and Ratner adds no information by the end.  It's hard to sympathize with a character we know nothing about.  Ratner then creates a host of new mutants, too many to even count.  I found myself asking, Why?  Weren't there enough already?  Towards the end of the film, in the climactic battle, I found myself getting confused as to who all of these people were.  What is the point of clogging up the screen with all of these unneccesary people?  If you're going to do that, don't waste your time explaining what every one of these hundred mutants can do.  We won't remember anyway.  My advice would have been to stick to the basics.  Do what Sam Raimi does with Spiderman.  Only introduce 1-3 characters per film.  If you kill one off, don't replace it with ten more.  The film does not get my reccomendation, but I say respectfully because of the wonderful performance of Ian McKellen (who just signed on to do a film centered around Magneto).  McKellen is the only character who feels like he's flowed perfectly throughout each film; some of the others are jerky and inconsistent, Wolverine for example.  His performance is a tour de force, and every minute he's on screen is a triumph, an electric event, a force not to be reckoned with.  His performance builds and builds, and the ending sequence (I won't really reveal it), in which he doesn't even speak, is brilliant and heartbreaking.  Actors usually win awards for these strong performances, and, while I'm sure the Academy won't consider this film for anything but Special Effects, McKellen should be given something.  This performance, along with the mind-blowing special effects, are the only redeeming qualities to this film.  The film moves way too fast, never gets focused, and it's social commentary isn't unlike anything we've ever seen before.  Yes, some of it is important, but we have already heard all of this stuff before.  Ratner takes a perfectly good franchise and gives it a less-than-satisfying conclusion, with the exception of Magneto.  Watch the film, if only for McKellen's performance, and marvel (pardon the comic book pun, it wasn't intentional) at what a great actor he really is.",1159920000,,3225,4.840950639853748
7682347,3,B01CE00Q5C,"I am an advid fan of both the x-men comic books and the movies. I have been a fan of Marvel Comics for over twenty years. I feel that the characters depths were reached in the first two movies but were not carried on to the third, yet they seemed to add many more to the mix, and the special features were a travisty. These things lead to my actual review being closer to 2.5 stars.

I feel that the addition of new characters enhanced the movie and hindered it at the same time. Beast, played by Kelsey Grammar was very well done, to the point of him saying ""Oh my stars and garters."" The Kitty Pryde character seemed one dimensional with no depth at all. She is shown to be a bit intelligent in the class room discussing Plato's view of ethics, but then used as a third wheel of a love triangle dissolves the hope of any furhter depth. Colossus's use of the ""fastball special"", at the beginning the movie, was awesome to the point of ingenious, but that is where his character loses his appeal. He has next to no lines and begins to blend into the background in many scenes.

The plot is based very losely on the story arc ""The Dark Pheonix Saga"" and when I say losely, I truly mean losely. The comic story involved a much greater deal of internal conflict within Jean, in which Jean solves by comitting suicide. In this movie, her death only comes by the hand, or claws of, yup you guessed it, Wolverine. The depths of emotional conflict in Jean is never brought to the screen, except for her saying thank you to Wolverine at the end of her life. I felt no pythos or pain, that her life needed to be forfeited. I was unimpressed and unmoved by the representation of the pheonix/Jean saga.

Extras/Special features? These were all things picked up off of the floor of the editing room and pasted, any way they could, back into the movie.
3 Alternate endings that have no rationale behind them or connection to the movie. The world of Marvel, this section is a cheap way for Marvel to exploit the viewer into purchasing some of the lesser quality superhero movies. They show the trailers for Daredevil, Electra and FF. Ther is no in depth look into the world of Marvel Comics at all. For those who really want to be cheated out of their hard earned cash, buy the colectors edition of the DVD, it has different packaging and a comic that stars San Lee. Yeah!!!

The whole presentation from the coverr of the actual DVD to the Special Features seem as thrown together as the actual Movie. I as a viewer feel a bit let down by the conclusion of the trilogy. Marvel, does not seem to shy away from the open handed, gimmie your money approach to commerece, just look at the Civil War Strory in stores now, so I would have to say wait a few months and you will probally see a new release of the DVD that does not seem so thrown together.",1159920000,9,2832,4.337735849056604
7682348,1,B01CE00Q5C,"My god this movie stunk, at least compared to the first two movies anyway.  This movie is worse than the worst of the x-men cartoons in plot, characterization and just plain fun.  I'm sure they spent lots of money on this movie, too bad they didn't spend more of it on the script and the director.  And it is obvious that the movie was ""hacked"" together, when the scene on the Golden Gate Bridge starts, it is the middle of the day, the next  minute they are at Alcatraz and suddenly it is midnight.  But the worse thing they did is the destruction of the characters, not just the ones they killed off, but how they changed them.  I wished I'd never watched this movie, it took characters that I liked and made them detestable, weak, stupid, etc., etc.",1159833600,7,752,4.374100719424461
7682349,5,B01CE00Q5C,"X-Men III with Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman and all the others fill out this cast in a non stop action fest.  The special effects we've seen before in other films but it still stands as a solid action film.  It's something I'd watch again. Without Bryan Singer, it's still a good film.

The film starts with the senator Worthington has a cure for mutants.  It all begins from there as there is a dividing line between humans and the serum to suppress the mutant genes, permanently.  Hugh Jackman gets most of the lines in this one.  We get to see the demise of three characters, whom I am not going to say here, but it's going to be hard to bring them back for sequels.  I only wish that there's a way to bring them back in flashback scenes or holographic programs.  The scene in the beginning took place in a Star Trek Next Generation style holo deck.  I don't know if this was done in the comic but it does lift a few Trek concepts.

Kelsey Grammar does a superb job of the Beast.  He has a small amount of time on the screen and chews up the scenery.  Back in the 70's the Beast was the wild card member. He wasn't always that Blue Haired Wolfman.  I wish that the characters that made brief appearances had something more to do.  Colossus should have had more to do than throw Wolverine into battle.  Juggernaut had much more cunning and intelligence in the comics.  He was wearing sculpted muscles in this one.

I was hoping that we'd get some of the comics script into the film.  In the original version, Phoenix was shot by a laser cannon unknown to Scott (Cyclops) Summers. The comics version had them in on alien planet giant arena fighting for their lives.  With CGI, it would have been possible to reproduce the environment in the comic.  I was hoping Chris Claremont would have had a hand in the script.

The comic insert was a good addition.  They should have added the DVD ROM of the first 500 issues as a selling point.  I was disappointed to see original X-Men artists Dave Cockrum, George Perez, and Tom Palmer not have any of their stories in the comic.  I love the Jack Kirby ones but they have been reprinted endlessly in best of collections.

The good thing I do have to say about the film is that it can be seen repeatedly.  There are a lot of comic elements that make this film a keeper.  The conflict between Xavier and Magneto is much deeper.  It's not a conventional battle because they were best friends at one time and had great respect for one another.

From what I've read the next film is going to be a solo Wolverine film.  I'd like to see the origin of Wolverine portrayed in the next one.",1159833600,4,2637,4.3552361396303905

7682352,4,B01CE00Q5C,"After watching the deleted scenes from the movie offered on the new DVD and checking out the three optional endings, I've got to wonder what idiots Rattner has working in the editing department. Some of the scenes cut out for the ones we saw in the movie made a hell of a lot more sense than what they put out on film.

One of the cut scenes is the Phoenix demonstrating her powers in the Brotherhood camp by disentegrating a metal cup levitated in front of her by Magneto, and turning it into a glowing orb that she sends out above the camp as she starts DISENTEGRATING the entire Brotherhood just for her own dark fun and giggles. Why? Because she's the Phoenix and she wanted to, of course! That was a much better depicting scene of the Phoenix than the one with her just levitating darts at Magneto making him almost piss himself. One of the alternate endings is Rogue returning to the mansion after NOT getting the cure after all, saying she just couldn't do it to Bobby, who was cool with that. Another of the scenes they edited for some moronic reason was the fight scene at Jean Grey's house, where the extended cut showed Wolverine shoving his claws into the back of Juggernaut's head and having Storm zap him so it would send the lightning through his claws into Juggy's skull, which was frickin' cool! So many of the scenes should have been left in, because it would have made for a much better movie.

But instead they went with the sappy feel-good addition that showed the director's, writing staff's, and editing crew's complete lack of experience in putting out a GREAT super-hero film, which this movie could have been if they truly knew what they were doing.

The movie misses the edge that the first two had, the true X-Men film flavor that had been built by 1 and 2. The offing of Xavier (at least until the end of the movie and credits), poor Cyclops (who lasted about five minutes before being killed by his wife), and the neutralizing of one of the best villians in super-hero movies ever in the form of Mystique early on was just poor writing and a BAD script. The same could be said of Wolverine's personality having the edge taken off of it by the script, instead showing us the more softer, compassionate, and emotional Wolvie all the sentimental types have been waiting for... WHAT?!?! Wolverine's personality personified the character in the first two flicks, and they just had to try and change it in X-3 for some reason. You see glimpses of it here and there in number 3, but not NEARLY enough as it was present in the first two. But give the Wolvie his due, because he clawed the crap out of alot of members of the Brotherhood camp as he went looking for Jean, which was just totally cool.

The reduction and absense of certain characters sticks out like a KKK member in Harlem as there was no Nightcrawler, a virtual non-existant Rogue, an occasional Bobby, Shadowcat and Colossus sighting here and there, and brief appearances by many of the new characters introduced.

On the flip side of the newbies, Beast I thought was played very well by Kelsey Grammar, and Vinny Jones as the Juggernaut was just frickin' cool. His one liner of ""I'm the Juggernaut, b***h!"" was just awesome, and really just personified his character to a tee. The Phoenix aspect of Jean Grey could have literally ended that film half way through if she got pissed (or bored) enough, because I have been told by comic enthusiasts that the Phoenix being, entity, whatever in the X-Men comics had destroyed entire STAR SYSTEMS in the past, much less the little thing we call Earth, so the rest of the cast kind of lucked out due to non-aggressive script writing and not following the comics completely. I'm still upset about Mystique being neutralized so early in the film, and then being turned on by Magneto, whom she had helped rescue in X-2 and followed for so long. The term'ungrateful and pompous jerk'does not even come close to covering what Magneto did to Mystique after she was turned human by the cure and he gave her the cold shoulder send off. ""I'm sorry my dear, but you're not one of us anymore."" He deserved the four cure darts in his chest that he got in the end of the final fight scene via Beast for that one.

All in all, its an entertaining movie and worth a watch. I bought it because I was a fan of Jackman's Logan/ Wolverine character, Janssen's Jean Grey/ Phoenix, Rebecca Romjin's Mystique character, and Ian McKellen's Magneto. If you're a purist of the X-Men, you'll be pulling your hair out by the end due to how badly Ratner and his crew messed things up from a plot perspective, but the movie is actually pretty descent. Its a fun ride and a 'good' super-hero flick.

Not as good as it could have been, by any stretch of the imagination, but a good film none-the-less and worth watching. So watch it and make your own judgments... and check out the deleted scenes and endings to see if I was right about how they should have been left in the actual movie, where some of the stuff they left in should have been left out.",1159833600,,5053,4.521881838074398
7682353,4,B01CE00Q5C,"With Bryan Singer and his writing team moving on to the Superman franchise, Marvel and Fox scrambled to get the third, and for now final, X-Men film out as quick as possible, with director Brett Ratner getting to direct the installment.  Now make no mistake, Ratner is a hack director at best, and his best talents are displayed in the many action scenes throughout the film, many of which are nicely done.  The story picks up a while after X2, with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Halle Berry) training a young group of mutants including Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Rogue (Anna Paquin), Shadowcat (Ellen Paige), and Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) while Cyclops (James Marsden) is still mourning the death of Jean (Famke Janssen).  In the meantime, a cure for mutants is announced, prompting Magneto (Ian McKellen) to organize his Brotherhood as Jean returns from the dead to make short work of Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and anyone else in her way.  For the most part, X-Men: The Last Stand is solid enough to stand out on it's own, but it really misses the touch that Singer and his crew had on the characters.  The dark tone is still here, but the characterization injected in the previous two films gets the second tier treatment here.  Many characters, mainly Cyclops and Rogue, are almost completely ignored to make way for new characters like Beast (Kelsey Grammer, perfectly cast) and Angel (Ben Foster, who plays a much lesser role than you would think), while new villains are introduced including Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones, yes, Vinnie Jones in a fake looking muscle suit and all) and Multiple Man (Eric Dane), while Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) get a backseat.  There's loads of in-references that longtime X-fans will get (the Days of Futures Past nod is a nice touch, and Stan Lee and Chris Claremont make cameos), but to believe that this is the last X-Men film is just silly.  It could have been better (and longer, the film is over way too quick), but it could have been a lot worse too, so maybe we should count our blessings.",1159833600,2,2069,4.824858757062147

On one hand, losing the cosmic plotline does take something away from the film, as does the demise of Cyclops so early on.  On the other hand, it would not have worked on the big screen.  Period.  It would have taken 3 films of its own to resolve.  Instead, inspiration was drawn from the Ultimate X-Men plotline, and it worked well on the screen.  And it made a lot more sense, to be honest.  Especially to the average moviegoer, which this film was geared towards.  Toss in the presence of ""good"" mutants as ""evil"" mutants, and some of the other stuff, and the uber-purists will complain.

Me?  I've been reading the ""X-Men"" and all its spin-offs for over 25 years now, and my biggest complaint was what little time Colossus got.  *grumbles*  Great character sacrificed for Halle Berry, I guess.

Obviously folks were disappointed with some of the happenings in the film.  Nightcrawler gone, either to budget constraints or to Alan Cummings not wanting to play the role.  Mystique de-powered, possibly due to Ms Romaijn's hesitance to resign for more X-films.  Cyclops gone due to James Mardsen wanting to move on (which he was grumbling about shortly after the first film!).  Etc, etc, etc.  I think a lot of people are blaming this on Brett, but I'm not so sure it's appropriate.  And they're ignoring the impact some of it had...  Jean kills the man of her dreams, and has to have the man who loves her kill her.  Magneto's most important advisor (and more...?) now taken away from him at the start of a civil war.  Storm having to come into her own as the head of the Academy.  A lot of impact being glossed over.

As an end to the trilogy, I really did enjoy it, however.  It introduced some fresh mutants for later films, gave many of the actors who are tired of the ""X-Men"" their outs, and a civil war among the mutant population wasn't a bad thing.  Is Brett a good compliment to Bryan?  Oh, certainly not, and I was a bit disappointed in the lack of additional character development, especially concerning the Phoeniz saga, hence the loss of a star. When the new big bad looks bored the entire time she's playing the big bad, well, Houston, we have a problem.

Action-wise, it was everything I could ask for.  The casting of the new mutants was spot on, and I would certainly pay to see Ellen Page, Daniel Cudmore, Shawn Ashmore, and Ben Foster in a spin-off.  Considering the lack of lines, I was impressed with Omahydra, Mei Marcon, and some of the other ""evil"" mutants at least creating a ""presence"", and we may see more of Vinnie Jones and Eric Dane (I hope!).

I'd be more disappointed if there is an X4 instead of spin-offs.  Cleaning up X3 wouldn't work too well, Wolvie and Mags are slated for thier own films, Halle Berry is too demanding to be part of an ensemble cast (sorry, Halle!), and most of the characters have been irrevocably changed to the point that they would need another three films to clean the loose ends up.  At this point, spin-offs are a better idea.

As for the DVD, don't waste the cash on the ""Collector's Edition"" unless you really want the comic book.  All the extras are going to be the same, and I look forward to the deleted scenes and alternate endings, especially after reading Claremont's novelization of the film.

The extablished characters do not grow and the plethora of new characters are unnecessary. The beloved ""fast ball special"" sequence was lamer than I thought possible. Kelsey Grammar was wasted as Beast, and the power of Phoenix was not used or explained to satisfaction. I liked the first movie, loved the second, and was absolutely heart-broken by this third; more like a train wreck than an adventure film.

7682371,1,B01CE00Q5C,"I'm not going to go through the entire detail and synopsis like everyone else.  I will however say what is wrong with the movie.  First of all, it should be called the Wolverine/Storm Show.  The two main characters have an entirely too large a role, leaving hardly any scenes for other character development.

I was incredibly dissapointed in the development of Colossus.  Poor Daniel Cudmore had an astonishing 27seconds of TOTAL screentime.  This is one of the major X-men and they use him as an extra basically.  Scenes with Colosssus could have been amazing, but they used little action for this character, it really was a waste.  Secondly, Angel, yah...had a few speaking parts, about 2 scenes where he flew around in the sky...and thats it!  This could have been a great character to develop as well, but once again...nothing!  Juggernaut, could have been amazing, i'm surpised that actually gave Vinnie Jones scenes where he spoke, but the way they finished him off was just ridiculous.  Shadowcat? C'mon?!  Iceman and Pyro were actually given some screentime and a final battle, which to my opinion was the highlight of the movie.  Other than that and the final battle with the ""hopping mutants"", the movie was a total waste of my $7.50.  I've got to say that Brett Ratner really screwed this movie up.  Any true X-men fan would have and should have been dissapointed in this movie.  Its a total discrace the the X-men franchise and comic.  As much as I do not want to buy the dvd and boycott it, I am...but only because I have the other two.  Please, save yourself the time and just rent it if your bored or sick, other than that it would probably make a nice doorstop.  I would put it up there with the Super Mario Bros. movie.",1159488000,12,1737,4.636065573770492
7682372,4,B01CE00Q5C,"This should have been an all out epic battle and granted, there are some very cool action scenes and performance, even the startling inclusion of Kelsey Grammer.

What failed, for me, was the small role the Dark Phoenix had against the backdrop of ""The Cure"" fiasco and Magneto's war.  The Dark Phoenix' role promised to be grand and spectacular and instead, fell apart at Alcatraz with a simple expression of love and Jean Grey's offing. Xavier's death was more intense, emotional and grand.  Like the characters, I was shocked and saddened by that turn of event; I didn't get that with Jean Grey's fisted puncture.

Though Brett Ratner's getting some big projects and has done some cool action sequences in his other movies, what he lacks, as does Tim Story of Fantastic Four, is the ability to create iconic imagery, something that makes the movie's scenes and visuals stand out.  Peter Jackson managed to make every frame of the Lord of the Rings trilogy seem like a piece of art; Ratner doesn't seem to know how to create interesting imagery that wasn't prevized by an effects company.  It all seems rather standard and goes by the film school playbook.

The duality in my feelings with the movie come from the fates of all the other characters, from the throwaway death of Scott, to the humanizing of Rogue and Mystique.  They are far from the roles in the comic, yet I understand why the filmmakers did it.  I like the movie for the chances they took; I don't like it at the same time.

What I am most bugged about, though, is the finale of the movie with the Dark Phoenix.  Her use of her power didn't seem as epic as it could have been and the pure evil of her character was wasted.

I'm gonna' get this movie though.  It's flawed, but it still makes a great addition to any scifi/fantasy buff's video shelf.",1159315200,3,1817,4.570987654320987
7682373,5,B01CE00Q5C,"I was astonished to see all the negative comments made about this movie.  It would made a terrible introduction to the X-Men trilogy, but as a long-time movie fan I was highly impressed.

Director Brett Ratner has created an immensely exciting and dramatic movie.  He doesn't bother with the character development that Bryan Singer put into the first two.  However if you found that Singer's stylized, hushed, melodramatic approach to character did nothing to improve X-Men and X2, Ratner's slam-bang action will be a breath of fresh air.

Wolverine and Storm both have increased roles in this movie.  Fortunately Halle Berry, while an interesting member of the cast, does not dominate the screentime.  Wolverine gets several good scenes.

The action scenes are absolutely spectacular.  The final battle on Alcatraz Island is just that, a battle with hundreds of participants in a fight to the death.  Wolverine vs. Deathstrike in X2 was probably the best single combat scene, but there's action on every level and enough to satisfy without taking over the emotional tension.

Speaking of emotional tension, this one is screaming with it.  Logan and Rogue in particular are faced with agonizing decisions.  Sadness, revenge and romance are combined in a movie that feels half as long as it is.

Many people are upset over the bitterly ironic fates that several of the characters meet. Admittedly X-Men: The Last Stand isn't as much of a feel-good movie as, say, Fantastic Four.  But it's better.  And when has being exceptional ever been easy?

In conclusion, I found this movie a breathtaking, edge-of-your-seat, climactic finish to three really good movies.  I don't know the comic books, so there may be objections I can't talk about.  But as a movie-watcher I consider this the best of the trilogy, worth watching, buying and watching again.",1159315200,13,1845,5.069767441860465
7682374,4,B01CE00Q5C,"I am a big X-men fan.  This movie does not have great character depth (something fans of the comics were not too happy about.)  Having read several hundred issues of X-men, I consider myself well versed.  I still really enjoyed the movie.  It was a fun movie to watch and that was all I really cared about.

That said, I think it is too bad that Halle Berry was ever cast as Storm.  She has managed to get worse as the series has progressed.  She threw one of her classic little tantrums for X3 and more or less FORCED them to increase her role in the third movie or she would otherwise quit.  Very sadly they did, and the film suffered.  The rest of the cast was very good.  Jackman plays a great ""wolverine"" as always.  Many new characters were introduced and they were all well cast and played.

Basically the lack of character development was a bit of a let down, but in no way ruins the movie.  Sadly it is Berry that kept this from a five star film, her performance was even worse than in the second film, and she was in enough scenes this time around that it became apparent just how bad she was.  Watch the film ""Catwoman"" if you would like to see just how aweful she can be, it is a hilarious film without intending to be.

The ONLY difference between this edition and the regular edition (that is $8 cheaper!) is that there will be a reprinted comic and a special ""collectible"" comic included.  So collectible that it will be included in the hundreds of thousands of these DVDs produced.  No extra features, no additional content beyong what is in the regular DVD.  The studio is obviously saving all that for another special edition to be released in 6 months (like X-Men 1.5).

7682376,4,B01CE00Q5C,"As with (almost) all movies that are not solely movies (such as movies made from books/comics), die-hard fans will rarely enjoy what Hollywood puts into these things. From the perspective of a X-men movie fan who has not read the comics and would occasionally watch the cartoons about a decade ago, I thought it was a great movie.

The movie had more pace than the first two. There were a lot of surprises or things you would not otherwise expect in a movie (which some may not like, but I thought made the plot more interesting). There were some points where I was like ""What? Did that actually just happen? I must have missed something."" Nope, they were very bold with this plot. So if you expect one specific plot in this movie, let go of that and see it or maybe skip this one.

Anyways, it sounds like people are either hot or cold to the movie. I enjoyed it enough that I would say the risk of seeing it (and not liking it) is worth it. If you don't like it, forget about it and just watch the first couple again and again. But if you are like me and aren't tied to any specific plot or storyline, you will want to watch this over and over again. This is my favorite of the three with the second close behind.

!Slight spoiler alert! If you are extremely attached to all the characters and are unwilling to see some go (die), then you may not enjoy this movie. Not all of the main characters make it through.",1159142400,5,1414,4.268656716417911

I hope they do scrap the idea for later x-men films related to these 3 and just start over with an all new cast, directors, screenwriters etc. and call it the UNCANNY X-MEN, that way there are no ties to the 1st set of movies.

That way, under new management, then we could finally get characters with their REAL costumes and not excuses as to why they were never used. I mean come on, Batman & SuperMan have been wearing their costumes since before I was even born, in the movies. SuperMan was even flying (starring Chris Reeve) back in the day. And all we get is a goofy hovering, from certain characters, in the 1st two XMEN films!!

Yes sadly, this film was an extreme disappointment. Personally, I feel they should have got someone with a deep passion for X-MEN, much like Sam Raimi with SpiderMan... TRUE GENIUS!!

Growing up as a child this is not how I envisioned my favorite X-MEN on the big screen!! No not at all!! Its like a slap in the face.

And don't forget, some years back we had the T-1000, liquid metal terminator, and those graphics for him looked better than ICEMAN!!",1158710400,7,1261,4.489082969432315
7682378,5,B01CE00Q5C,"This movie stands apart from the first two - different directors, different visions.  While Singer's approach was darker, Ratner goes for a bit of both worlds.  Special effects are fantastic.  There are scenes where you will laugh at loud, something that was missing from the first two.  This movie was fun and didn't feel 20 minutes too long like the first two.  Now don't get me wrong...I enjoyed the first two.  It's just that this one was more appealing to me.  For those who worship the first 2 films, you will probably not like this as much.

This movie does have its flaws, though.  Nightcrawler is almost fully absent in this movie, which was a shame because I enjoyed him in the 2nd movie.  Also, Archangel was underutilized (I think it's hard to fit everybody since there are so many characters and they don't want the movie to drag).  I also wished that Gambit would make an appearance in the X-men movies (he was always my favorite).  Ever since watching LOST, I thought that Josh Holloway (Sawyer) would make a good Gambit and then read that he was going to be Gambit (but something happened where they didn't write Gambit in, for whatever reason).

Oh, and the scene where Wolverine gets shot by the arrow, he heals himself but his shirt no longer has the hole from the arrow...I guess his shirt is self healing as well!

All in all, this movie was well worth watching (and watching again).  Hopefully there will be more X-men movies in the future.",1158710400,5,1462,4.590733590733591
7682379,4,B01CE00Q5C,"WARNING!  Spoilers ahead!

I may be among the few who liked this one better than the previous two.  It probably was never going to be possible to create an X-Men finale that was going to please everyone.  I'll confess that there were a number of things in the three-film sequence that I didn't care for.  But give the team an ""A"" for effort in at least trying to do something interesting and compelling.  My complaint with the first film was that it was so safe and tame.  It didn't try to take the X-Men saga anywhere new or interesting.  THE LAST STAND did.  For the record, my complaint with the series is that it managed to make Rogue an unessential and uninteresting member of the team.  Of all the incarnations of Rogue, this one was the least powerful and the least complex.  Anna Paquin did a fine job given the script they provided, but she should have been far more empowered than she was.

Most movies based on the comics suffer from a failure of nerve.  The writers want to play it safe, don't want to offend, and refuse to take risks.  THE LAST STAND takes a world of risks and leaves the X-Men universe shaken from top to bottom.  I loved that!  I didn't think all the gambles paid off.  The Phoenix story was not as interesting as it has been in the past.  Part of the problem with the Phoenix is that they tried to incorporate it with too many other arcs, including the ""cure"" of the mutant gene.

Most of all, this film, unlike the previous two, really made me care how the story ended.  In the previous two, one figured everyone would be alive at the end, so in a way precisely what happened wouldn't matter all that much.  But in this one once Mystique had been ""cured"" and Scott and Xavier killed, there was a great sense of danger.  Not every one was going to emerge OK in this one.  Who would have imagined that the film would have ended with Xavier, Scott, and Jean dead, and Mystique, Magneto, and Rogue stripped of their powers?

I loved the fact that they included some of the X-Men neglected in the previous films.  Kelsey Grammer was excellent as Hank McCoy, but I thought Ellen Page was perfect as Kitty Pryde, who has always been one of my favorite X-Men, mainly because her power of being able to pass through solid objects (or having solid objects pass through her) made her fascinating because employing it required so much strategy.  The sequence where she and Juggernaut engage one another was a lot of fun.  Vinnie Jones was almost unrecognizable, by the way, as Juggernaut.  Sidenote:  Many X-Men fans are bothered by the fact that traditionally Juggernaut is not a mutant.  Therefore, in the scene where his powers are stripped temporarily by the mutant who robs other mutants of their ability, he should have been unaffected.  But on narrative grounds I can understand why they altered this in the film.

I can understand why so many fans of the comic disliked the final movie in the trilogy.  It was a sharp departure from most of the various versions of the X-Men saga found in so many of the comics and cartoon shows.  But I was ecstatic to see them try something really different and risky.  They didn't take the safe route.  And I personally found the story far more interesting than the first two films precisely for that reason.  Yeah, I wish Rogue had been conceived differently in the trilogy and I wish the Phoenix story had been handled better, but I realize that because there have been so many permutations of the X-Men, everyone is going to contruct their own private version.  This isn't quite the version I would have come up with had I the ability to cherry pick the elements I like, but this one managed the most important task:  it made the story interesting.",1158451200,62,3717,4.50748502994012

7682383,3,B01CE00Q5C,"Many reviewers have already posted excellent reviews below, so I don't think I need to write down the entire story of the third `X-Men' film. The so-so story about the `cure' is interesting at first, but it is terribly oversimplified. And the return of Jean Grey (or Phoenix) is not a big surprise if you have seen the ending of the second `X-men' film very carefully. I only add to say that the two storylines, both of which I heard can be seen in the original comic in separate episodes, do not merge well.

In other words, so many life-changing things happen to the characters, but the fast-paced film fails to be emotional when it should be most. Cyclops is reduced to Character # 1; Rogue is almost forgotten; and Jean Grey, Magneto, and other characters are all buried in the flood of eye-popping special effects.

Many new characters are introduced, but except for Kelsey Grammer's perfect Dr. Hank McCoy, they are mostly forgettable, or treated as if disposable. They are all only the pixels among the costly CGI, and perhaps director Brett Ratner, who mercilessly Hollywoodnized Jackie Chan and his stunts in 'Rush Hour' series, thought the same way as Magneto, who coldly says they are just 'pawns' of the chess game.

I admit the excellence of the visual effects. It is made as a big-budget summer blockbuster film, and it really is. But what made the first and second `X-Men' films different is missing here. You don't share the sadness of these characters, and you don't understand the complicated feelings that these characters expressed.

Well, he certainly did not manage it.  The action was alright, but not particularly interesting.  The comic moments WERE often fabulous, but the dramatic moments were just painful.  You do not, for one moment, believe anything that is happening on the screen.  I'd compare the dramatic scenes to the Star Wars prequels.

7682403,5,B01CE00Q5C,"This film is a great end to the trilogy if that's what this is. But seeing how it made some much money I kinda doubt it. Anyway.

 Over 95% of die hard comic book fans are going to hate this movie. Why? Because all comic fans are wannabe directors. The problem is that many aren't even satisfied with the comics themselves, as they are also wannabe writers as well. They may like this story arc but not the next. I know every single one of them will walk out of theather and say ""I could have done that better""

 The X-Men are a very complicated superhero team. With miles of backstory,over 40 years of history, and team roster that is constantly changing. Any director would find this  a very challenging project to undertake. The fans all have their own favorite characters of the 198 currently in the comic. Some will be disappointed if their fave isn't included. Others have their favorite stories that they want to see done. Yet, a lot of those stories require a tons of exposition to make sense to common moviegoer.

 Let's take the Dark Phoenix story. In the comic Jean seemly died while saving the X-Men. Only to come back extremely powerful. During a fight with the Hellfire club Jean's dark side was let loose. She went into space and devoured a sun that was supporting life for over 5 billion people. The aliens then come to earth and demand that she die. Now any comic fan can tell you I left out a whole bunch of details. In a movie I would need to introduce the hellfire club,the Shi'ar imperial guard and explain all their powers. Plus the effects for each of those powers. Not to mention the phoenix devouring a sun and show the deaths of the inhabited worlds.

 Its impossible. So this is a different story. To be enjoyed on its own merit. Not compared with a comic that cost about $2.50. One day the technology will allow an X-Men movie to be closer to the comic and not cost close to a quarter of a billion dollars. But that day is a ways off yet. Superhero films are so much better now. The effects have given us some great action when compared to the 50's,60's and 70's.

 So enjoy this movie and stop trying to make a better film in your head. Cause everybody knows that no matter how great the special effect are you can always make something better in your mind.",1156723200,3,2286,4.393364928909953
7682404,1,B01CE00Q5C,"I had this horrible awful dream the other night that someone took the two of the greatest X-Men storylines of all time and reduced it to a terrifyingly bad encapsuliation, written and performed about as ineptly as anyone could ever imagine. Unfortunately this dream turned out to be real. And the more I thought about this film, the more upset I became. This is just an awful AWFUL film that, for some inexplicable reason, people continue to defend by saying ""At least it was entertaining!"". This jerkwad excuse does NOT work. There is very little fun and almost nothing funny about this film. It works hard to hold your interest but fails miserably. I do not actually blame Brett Ratner so much for this failure as much as I do the writers, Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn. They have little-to-no respect for the source materiel and even less for the characters. What's even worse is the performances in this film. Halle Berry couldn't be more wooden if she had roots firmly planted in the ground. Hugh Jackman... when did Wolverine become such a wuss-bag? When have we EVER seen Logan shed a tear in the comic? If you've found it, you're more of a fan than I. Hugh Jackman seems to want to turn Logan into the Melancholy Dane. And it works not one bit. The only outstanding performer in this film really is Sir Ian. McKellen is one of the greatest actors to have ever lived and he continues his great work here. Kelsey Grammer as Henry ""Beast"" McCoy also is quite good, because his performance is one done with great affection for the character. I don't know if the direction that they decided to go with for the creation of The Phoenix is interesting or absurd. It does fit in with more of the ""real world"" stuff that they're looking to do (having Phoenix be a repressed dominant personality rather than a cosmic lifeforce is definitely more realistic, but this is a COMIC BOOK ADAPTATION...). Anna Paquin, who has been my least favorite character of the entire series, not that I disliked Rogue, but Paquin ALWAYS seems to be on the verge of tears. Rogue was someone in the comics, who, at times, revelled in her power, whereas Paquin's Rogue is sooooo incredibly saddened by her abilities (understandably, but COME ON... let her have some FUN once in a great while) that we're meant to empathize with her ultimate decision, which is also something that really bothered me. Most people in this film are just wasted... none more so than James Marsden aka Cyclops. His character is given the WORST of the fates in store for the mutant heroes, and no respect is given to him other that a passing moment at the end. That was the worst part for me because Cyclops was always my favorite X-Man, and his treatment in all of the films (worst of all this film) is upsetting to say the least. For the better part of the first decade that X-MEN was in print, the main focus of the group was Cyclops, even though they did have the foresight to have the team have an actual TEAM dynamic, as opposed to this film where it seems it's Wolverine vs. the world. It ranks amongst BATMAN AND ROBIN, ELEKTRA, and LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN as one of the worst comic book films ever made, and I recommend to read the comics and skip this film entirely.",1155859200,30,3236,4.552315608919383

7682406,1,B01CE00Q5C,"This last instalment of X-Men seems to have been thrown together with no sense of direction or purpose.

After an astonishing sequel which left all audiences in eager anticipation of the final culmination, everything just fell flat.

To give idea of how the plot should have been, there are basic themes running throughout the movies.  The main one is acceptance of differences and overcoming predujices between humans and mutants.

In the first instalment we are introduced to the mutants and their struggle to be recognized and accepted in society.

The plot centers on the differing opinions of Professor Xavier and Magneto who have their own methods on how to deal with the problem and are opposed to each other because of this.

In the second instalment, the two opposing factions of Mutants (Xavier's group and Magneto's) find themselves working together despite their differences to foil the humans plan to wipe off Mutants from the face of the earth. The sacrifice of Jean Grey

in this second installment provides the perfect background for the third twist, where the MUTANTS and the HUMANS must work together to eliminate the worst possible threat to the entire earth in the form of the ressurected Jean Grey aka DARK PHOENIX.  This would have been the perfect culmination of the trilogy as it would challenge the beliefs and values of the mutants, ie after having so long fought for mutant rights, having to overcome fears and predjudices of humans, will the mutants react to Jean Grey turned DARK PHOENIX with the same fear and dread as the humans have regarded them all along?

In the comic storyline, Dark Phoenix is responsible for destroying an entire solar system.  Can one imagine the reaction of the other Mutants if Jean Grey destroyed and entire city, e.g. New York?  And in the wake of such destruction the other Mutants who have hated humans would have to use their powers to rescue and protect them instead. Likewise the humans would also have a shock to their belief system if they were saved and protected by the Mutants they so despised.

The development of the mutant cure could have resolved the delimma of saving Jean Grey rather than being the main issue of contention for the film, and everything would have worked out just perfectly in the end.

Although this is my personal opinion, I am sure there are many persons who would agree with me on how the plot should have gone.

It's a pity one can't redo a movie. Maybe in future there could be several versions of the same movie made to suit different audiences.",1155772800,12,2544,4.7917620137299775
7682407,3,B01CE00Q5C,"...but nonetheless, this movie falls short, waaaay short, of what I was expecting after X2. This contains spoilers.

Pros:

- It's a lot more action and effects than the previous two films. While the first two were more of a story, this was more eye-candy. It's the fireworks display after a day of Independence. I gave this movie an extra star solely because of the Golden Gate bridge sequence.

- We finally get to see the Phoenix and what she can do. A whole slew of new mutants are also introduced: Juggernaut, Multiple Man, Kitty Pryde, and others are here.

- The core story is simple enought to follow. It's impossible to get lost halfway through the movie.

Cons:

- I feel that the characters I've learned to appreciate are wasted. Rogue, Mystique, Professor-X, Cyclops,... They're pretty much gone a mere 15 or so minutes into the movie.

- Although I liked the fairly simple story, it wouldn't have hurt to provide more characterization for the, well, characters. Angel, Colossus, and the others were just too one-dimensional.

- The length. It's supposedly the last of the series and with a run-time of just under an hour and forty-five minutes, it didn't satisfy me. I feel robbed.

- The dialogue is pretty awful in most parts. I mean, I know it's something to expect in these kinds of movies but the folks here didn't even seem like they were trying to stray away from that.

It just feels like storyline/plot of this movie was rushed. I don't know whose fault it is, Ratner & Co. or Fox, but I think this movie would've been A LOT better (maybe even superior) to Singer's vision if it were split into two.

The Last Stand is a condensed, crash-course version of the X-Men universe, and it doesn't work. Somewhere along the line, I hope another X-Men film will be made, albeit not follow this storyline because it's basically ruined. There are good parts in the film, and with the bad parts, you can see what might have been good in them. What we have here is a mediochre offering of something that could've been great.",1155772800,7,2034,4.606648199445983

I do agree with the others who reviewed it and said that they where unhappy that in the Last Stand several main characters die. But it is because of that I like it so much. I was shocked just as everyone was when Cyclops and Proffessor X died. But I had to give an appluase to the Director for taking such a huge risk (especially when there are so many Cyclops fans). I think it brings more emotion and life to the film, due to the fact that these main characters die. I also found the action to be superb, I liked how all the mutants showed off there powers this time around. And I love that in this film it was centered around The Dark Phoenix. I do however agree that her story was very diffrent in the comics and that this film version depicted her very diffrently. But overall I thought that the Dark Phoenix ways played very well and that her scenes whe prehapes the most intense in the film. In conclusion X-men: The Last Stand is a powerful, emotional, and capitivating film that you will entertian you to the very end. PS. whatch after the criedits for the final scene, its a shocker.",1155686400,8,1239,4.227848101265823
7682409,3,B01CE00Q5C,"Like all worthwhile film trilogies, themes and character arcs established in 2000's X-Men come to their fruition in this final? movie installmant of Marvel's famous mutants. But, are we given the grand finale we deserve? No.

While the first movie served simply as exposition to introduce the conflicts and motives of this well-drawn cast, the second movie laid it all out and showed film audiences what comic book readers knew for decades: the X-Men are powerful, amazing, and very tragic characters, which makes them very human.

In The Final Stand, we are given a glimpse at how unethical Xavier can be, how vain Magneto really is, and how stern Storm can come off. But what highlights this film, and makes it even a little enjoyable, is the chemistry between lost soul Jean Grey (played PERFECTLY by Famke Jensen) and unrequited lover Logan (returning fav Hugh Jackman.) Not to mention a fanboy's dream script incorporating elements and images from  X-Tales like Days of Future Past, Planet X, the cartoon episode 'The Cure', and of course, The Dark Phoenix Saga.

As a fan of these stories for 15 years now, I can say that the spirit and message of X-Men was fullfilled with the trilogy, but The Final Stand did not meet up to expectations.  One could blame last minute director Brett Ratner for pushing the film along at a pace that doesn't allow for thought, or the screenwriters for trying to do TOO much in one film.  When Cyclops is reunited with his beloved, believed dead and gone, their reunion is almost watered down. Yes there is shock. Yes there is confusion. Yes there is joy. But that scene alone flows like there was a checklist, like they had to hit these feelings and move on. And the whole movie comes across like that. So, I credit this movie for telling a great story, but it loses point after point for how poorly at times it tells that story. Most likely, 20th Century Fox's demand to have the film out Memorial Day 2006 gave the production team too little time to fine tune what could have been a masterpiece.

Casual moviegoers will love it.  Plenty of action, special effects, romance (however complicated), comedy, and a good theme.

Comic fans either embrace it or loathe it.  But this isn't a comic.  This is a movie, and a decent one to be sure.  It's just not a great one.

7682412,3,B01CE00Q5C,"Superhero movies tend to work best if done as a trilogy. Unfortunately, studios don't view superhero movies that way and see a particular character or characters as being a franchise: if they can get characters on the screen more than in just three movies then the better it is for them. This seems to be the approach that was taken with X-MEN: THE LAST STAND. The series was originally envisioned as being a trilogy with one or two spin-offs. That approach seems to have been thrown out. Granted some of that might have to do with the series and film's original director, Bryan Singer, leaving and taking the majority of the production crew with him to make SUPERMAN RETURNS. After Singer's departure, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND was in production limbo for awhile until Brett Ratner was given the reigns. In a strange bit of irony, Ratner was originally supposed to direct the first two X-Men films and left and was supposed to direct SUPERMAN RETURNS and left there, too. In both instances, Singer took over the helm. Despite the change-up in direction and production, there really isn't an excuse for X-MEN: THE LAST STAND being the somewhat lackluster film that it came to be.

The story itself is full of promise. The federal government develops a vaccine that can cure mutants of their disease. Many mutants are excited by the prospect of living life as a normal human. However, many other mutants aren't very keen on the idea. Neither Professor X (Patrick Stewart) or Magneto (Ian McKellen) support the vaccine. Both mutant leaders believe that mutants should embrace their talents and gifts. However, the two leaders strongly differ on their approach. Professor X preaches tolerance while Magneto sees the creation of the vaccine as a declaration of war upon all mutants. The mutants led by Magneto begin the war against humanity in full force, while the X-Men find themselves in the middle: protecting the humans and preaching Professor X's message of tolerance and unity.

The movie builds up to a huge climatic battle between Magneto's mutants and the X-Men and humans on Alcratraz. Unfortunately, this battle doesn't live up to the expectations it has built. There are some very cool parts of the battle, e.g. the scenes with Beast (Kelsey Grammer). However, the battle is rather anti-climatic. Everything in the film leads up to that battle and then nothing really happens. That is a major let down.

The best part about X-MEN: THE LAST STAND is seeing different mutants on screen. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is back as is Storm (Halle Berry). Professor X and Magneto are here, too. In fact many of the mutants from the first two movies have returned (well Toad and Sabertooth and Nightcrawler are mysteriously absent, though Nightcrawler's absence is explained in the video game based on the movie). However, other than those four most of the mutants play much smaller roles. Rogue is hardly on the screen; Cyclops is destroyed with only about a minute of screen time; Angel's introduction is huge, but he's not really seen. I realize that part of this is because there are so many superheroes and not all of them can be seen in each film. However, part of it is because the studio is setting things up for sequels to come. In some way, they are following the lead of the comic books: some characters are written off to make room for new ones, but if need be you can always bring someone back from the dead. That makes for interesting, though frustrating reading, but doesn't translate well on the big screen.

Overall, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND is a mediocre comic book movie. The movie introduces some great new characters and contains some very interesting battle sequences. However, the film fails to live up to the climatic expectations that it promises.",1155427200,,3762,4.855140186915888
7682413,4,B01CE00Q5C,"Fans gasped when it was announced that X-MEN and X2 director Bryan Singer was leaving X-MEN III to make SUPERMAN RETURNS - and he was taking his crew with him. Singer told 20th Century Fox that, if they would wait until he completed SUPERMAN RETURNS, he would make X-MEN III as well. Fox decided to go ahead without Singer, bringing numerous directors on to the project before settling on Brett Ratner. This worried fans ever more, as they realized that Ratner's previous films included RUSH HOUR, MONEY TALKS, and THE FAMILY MAN. What many fans forgot is that Ratner also directed the superb RED DRAGON. Personally, I was optimistic. Ratner's work on both RUSH HOUR movies and on RED DRAGON had impressed me, and I thought that he could do a nice job on the film.

I was right - sort of. Ratner does a fine job, but he tends to favor shots that are either very close or very far away. Because of this, he creates a sort of claustrophobic feeling which hung with me throughout the film. Also, he can't wring great performances out of the actors like Bryan Singer can. On the plus side, Ratner does create some stunning visuals (with lots of help from the special effects team) - namely a sequence involving the Golden Gate Bridge. Though Ratner is potentially a very good director, he is nowhere near as talented as Bryan Singer.

Three other new additions to the crew are screenwriters Simon Kinberg (MR. & MRS. SMITH) and Zak Penn (BEHIND ENEMY LINES, ELEKTRA) and composer John Powell (THE BOURNE IDENTITY). The script is good, though it feels like the events in the film are rather rushed. Perhaps editors Mark Goldblatt, Mark Helfrich, and Julia Wong - taking over for John Ottman - are to blame for this. I also noticed that some of Wolverine's lines seemed forced; they didn't seem natural like those from the previous films. I must say that the ending, however, is very clever. Very clever indeed.

Then we come to the matter of the soundtrack. John Powell's music fluctuated between being grand and atrocious. It's a sweeping score, but it seems a little too over-the-top. It's not as good as John Ottman's score for X2 or Michael Kamen's score for X-MEN, but it will suffice.

The cast seemed far less stellar this time. At her request, Halle Berry's part was expanded. Though I've always thought that Storm was an interesting character - and Berry did very well as her in the first two films - her performance seems rather weak in this film. Hugh Jackman is still excellent as Wolverine, but even his performance isn't as wonderful as it was in the previous films. Then we have Ian McKellen, who is just outstanding as Magneto. He shines in each and every one of his scenes. Famke Janssen is great, although she doesn't get many lines. Also great is Kelsey Grammer as Hank McCoy (a.k.a. Beast), Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde, and especially Vinnie Jones (LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS, SNATCH.) as Juggernaut. Juggernaut is a hulking character whose special ability is plowing through everything and everyone with no difficulty whatsoever. Jones turns Juggernaut into an extremely amusing character. His scenes are the most fun of any in the film.

As both a comic book fan and an avid moviegoer, I enjoyed this film very much. However, the comic fan within me wishes that we'd learnt the origins of Hank McCoy (which I've also found very interesting) and seen Gambit, one of the major X-Men characters from the comics (LOST's Josh Holloway, a perfect choice, was offered the part but turned it down). Though it does seem rushed and a little short (it clocks in at 106 minutes, compared to X2's 133 minutes), I had a ball throughout the movie. I'd have liked to see Joss Whedon or Matthew Vaughn as director (both of whom were attached to the project at one time), but Brett Ratner did a good job. X-MEN: THE LAST STAND isn't up to par with Bryan Singer's X-MEN and X2, but it's a fine film nonetheless.",1155340800,4,3917,4.662807525325615

While it did stray from historic comic book plots and characters, what director Brett Ratner envisioned is a fine and acceptable, if not a really good, story.

The story, special effects, and the acting were excellent.

 The story, while there are those who'll say otherwise, was really good. The X-men find out from The Secretary of Mutant Affairs, aka Beast, that there is a threat to mutant kind. A child, played by Cameron Bright, has the ""uncanny"" (pardon the pun) ability to ""leech"" any mutants powers. The effect is temporary and only while the mutant is within about 10-15ft from him. However the military uses the kid's blood to make (any guesses?) a weapon, of course. This causes a flurry of reactions from the mutant comunity. Some mutants want ""the cure"" some want it destroyed. I don't want to ruin the story so I'll just say it is a pretty acurate depiction of what would happen. I was kind of dissapointed that not any muntants from other Marvel series were involved. I thought it would be an excellent chance for some cross-over characters to make a few cameo apearances. While the comic book fanatics were freaking out about the differences from the movie to the comics, they were not paying atention to the really great story.

The special effects were up to the same level, if not better, as the first 2 entries in this series. There is a really great scene where Beast, played by Kelsey Grammer (aka Frasier), reaches out to touch the Leech (C. Bright), and his hand becomes a normal looking human hand. There is also a scene that has Cyclops, played by James Marsden, blasting Alkalie Lake, where Jean Grey drowned. Also when the Phoenix is around...get ready for special effects to wow you.

The acting was, as always when you have Patrick Stewart, superb. Everyone from Halle Berry, who plays Storm, to Vinnie Jones, who plays Juggernaut, did a fine job. I only can complain about one actor...Cameron Bright, who plays the Leech (the kid who has the negating power). He says about 3 words through the whole movie. From what I've seen of the kid he has played basically the same character in every movie he's been in. This small negative does not take away from the movie as a whole. He only has about 4 scenes anyway.

All in all this is a fantasic movie. You must make it a point to watch the extra scenes at the end of the credits. A lot of story happens in those few scenes, and you don't want to miss them. The last few moments of these scenes cement the idea of another X-Men sequal. Which is a great idea. There is only like 40 years of stories to cover.

X-Men The Last Stand has some fantasic special effects and some awesome action sequences, but ultimately there is no heart to the film.  And really no story to boot.

Brett Ratner strives to leave behind everything Brian Singer did to make the first two films some of the best comic book films ever.  He must have felt the characters had been developed enough, and so now it is time for ""action"".  This film was greenlighted by studio executives just to make a quick buck off of the success of the first too.  They don't care about the characters.  And neither does the director Brett Ratner.  To prove my point, Ratner films a scene for after the film that says to the audience, ""Wait, the one powerful scene I make for the film, the death of Charles Xavier, is meaningless now, because he'll be back for X-Men 4.  A trilogy is how they should have stopped it.  It should have been left alone. And because this is a substandard sequel, it ranks with the Fantastic Four or the early Batman films.

7682428,2,B01CE00Q5C,"(spoilers....) The X-Men Last Stand, the Phoenix saga on the big screen...  something a fan of the early Chris Claremont / John Byrne comic books have dreamed about but then it came out. I understand that things change for a movie, they have to make the transition to the big screen but this movie took a meat cleaver to the canon of X-men. The first two movies understood how to make a movie and appease fans of the comic.  Singer was obviously a fan of the original material.  Those earlier movies made some characters that were adults, adolescents; they switch things around but it still rung true.  This movie, however, trounced what had made the original great.  Where Cyclops was a main player in the comic he was cast aside, too insignificant to even show his death.  Where the Phoenix was a messed up girl who struggled with her remaining humanity was instead portrayed as a zombie who would just as soon disintegrate you as look at you.  Angel one of the original X-Men a throw away, the addition of Kitty Pryde was never explained, she just appeared, and so much more.

True there were some great special effects, and Magneto had a few moments but the lack of love of the project was obvious.  Notice in the Golden Gate bridge scene that started out in the day then suddenly it was night...  or how quickly everyone got over a character's death.  This was a HACK job and I wish we could have a do over since I had been a fan of the early story and now I am left with my favorite character's in a shambles.  They killed charaters off maybe due to actors contract rather then if they should die.

For those of you who do not read the comics, or care about the inner details of the story I am sure this is a fine movie.  But do yourself a favor and pick up the complete Phoenix Saga at a comic book store and see what you were missing.",1155168000,10,1842,4.332361516034985

Wolverine (as usual), Storm, Magneto, & Jean Gray in her Phoenix incarnation were given the best threads of the story, and came out on top. This movie has AMAZING action sequences, cool special FX, some great prerequisite one-liners, and ultimately resounds as a compelling allegory for numerous relevent social issues (racism, terrorism, homophobia, etc.)

The major flaw with X3 is just the running time. It should have been 2 hours +. But it is, what it is, and considering the number of characters (major & minor) poor Mr. Ratner had to contend with, I think he did quite well at telling a succinct and intriguing story, as well as preserving the integrity of the X-Men universe.

7682430,5,B01CE00Q5C,"Okay, I don't care!  I love X-MEN TLS! Yeah, I know, I know.  There are some issues with development regarding certain characters, but there are also major strides in that area with others.  Wolverine (as usual), Storm, Magneto, & Jean Gray in her Phoenix incarnation were given the best threads of the story, and came out on top.  This movie has AMAZING action sequences, cool special FX, some great prerequisite one-liners, and ultimately resounds as a compelling allegory for numerous relevent social issues (racism, terrorism, homophobia, etc.)

The major flaw with X3 is just the running time.  It should have been 2 hours +.  But it is, what it is, and considering the number of characters (major & minor) poor Mr. Ratner had to contend with, I think he did quite well at telling a succinct and intriguing story, as well as preserving the integrity of the X-Men universe.

7682432,4,B01CE00Q5C,"After the undeniable success of X-Men and X-Men: X-Men United, this third movie about the famous mutants, brought all kind of reactions from the hardcore fans to the not so die-hard fans.

Director Brett Rattner had very big shoes to fill, becaue Bryan Singer had done so much for X-Men. He gave all of us, a credible movie. He showed that comic-based movies can be movies with meaning and depth, and certainly not cartoon like. Rattner did an acceptable job in my opinion.

In this movie we get action as never before in the previous movies, though we lose character content. We have quite a large number of mutants to introduce, along with the already known ones, so it is much more difficult to really build up the character's psychology.

The most important part of the movie falls in the hands of Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Sir Ian McKellen (Magneto) and Famke Janssen (Jean Grey / Dark Phoenix). The rest of the chracaters, Iceman, Mystique, Rogue, Storm, Colossus, etc are quite shadowed.

I cannot say I was completely satisfied with The Last Stand, though I recognize it is a very good movie. But definitely I enjoy more X-Men and X-Men 2. Nonetheless, I can't miss having this DVD in my collection.",1154908800,3,1207,4.733333333333333

20th Century Fox is expected to announce Friday that ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" which grossed $233 million at the box office, will arrive on DVD on October 3 in two extras-laden editions.

The highlight of the third ""X-Men"" movie's DVD debut: three alternative endings, each with optional commentary by director Brett Ratner. The single-disc DVD release also includes 10 deleted scenes; audio commentaries from Ratner, the writers and the producers; a preview of the upcoming  Ben Stiller movie ""A Night at the Museum;"" and two hidden ""Easter eggs,"" one of the Beast reciting Shakespeare and the other of the X-Jet landing in Washington.

Fox also is preparing a collector's edition that includes an exclusive 100-page commemorative book with an all-new story penned by Marvel Comics master Stan Lee. It is his first original Marvel Comics book in five years.",1153958400,10,949,5.223684210526316
7682434,1,B01CE00Q5C,"X3: The Last stand is the Last Straw for Shawn James. The X- trilogy comes to a horrid finish under the lens of the inept Brett Ratner. Brett Ratner is to X-men what Joel Schumacher is to Batman. In ten years people will be denouncing this X-Trilogy the same way they do the first Batman Saga. Unfortunately, there won't be a Chris Nolan and David Goyer or a Sam Raimi around to rectify the mistake this time.

Ratner makes a total 360 from what little story Bryan Singer tried to build in his first two films. The convoluted plot involves a ""Cure"" for mutation, the Pheonix, rising from the ashes, and a war. Each of these stories would make for a great movie in and of themselves, but Ratner throws them in a blender and makes one big mess. There are too many stories, too many characters and no focus. But Storm needs more screen time, the studio needs Halle, and Ratner just uses CGI special effects to patch up the plotholes and totally derive from the course of the comics being adapted. In the first ten minutes Ratner uses the Phoenix to Kill off Cyclops and Professor X, characters crucial to the X-Saga. I guess this is so Storm can be leader and have more screen time. Thank you Miss Halle Berry. Someone in your entourage should advise you this old Broadway adage: THERE ARE NO SMALL PARTS ONLY SMALL ACTORS. It's not how much screen time you have, but what you do with it. Sadly she gives the same flat uninspired performance she does in every movie post Swordfish.

Due to Halle's insecure need for more screen time, Ratner's incompetent directing and Fox's need to beat WB's Superman Returns at the box office, X3 falls completely apart over the course of 90 odd minutes. Ironically, these three political forces behind the camera sabotage the intriguing political stories in the movie. The movie strays way off course from the comic storylines it's adapted from and heads into Batman and Robin territory. In the comics, Jean who loved Cyclops so much she held back the evil Phoenix force and sacrificed her own life, Kills the man she loves with impunity. Wolverine loved Jean so much he couldn't bear to kill her. But in this movie he slaughters her with ease. But this change of story course from the comics is nothing compared to the numerous strays from the original two movies. Rogue who struggles and deals with her inability to touch others by finding another way to connect with them (emotionally), just cops out with a wonder drug. Iceman just decides to date Kitty Pryde because it's convenient to the plot. During the big battle sequence, Magneto abandons a cured Mystique, his loyal lieutenant of two movies. Six X-men take on an army of morlocks so storm can get her big battle sequence. And Magneto, the brilliant military strategist doesn't have enough sense to throw a force field around himself while Six X-men are shooting ""cure"" darts allover the place. Hey, he always keeps a magnetic force field around him in the comics, but in this movie he just decides not to. And when the war is all done, thousands of lives lost, billions in property damage, both sides shake hands and back to business as usual with a Don't ask, Don't tell policy. But these plot points don't matter. It's a necessary compromise so Storm gets more screen time.

When you think about this movie it truly is the ""Wolverine and Storm"" of the X-Franchise a complete and unmitigated disaster. The entire movie feels rushed and sloppy; it seems like Fox just wanted to get a product out before Superman Returned; quality be damned. The acting is flat and one-dimensional because characters aren't' written with any depth. To cover up the bad acting and bad writing, Ratner overloads the movie with special effects. Yes, the special effects are dazzling; seeing the Golden Gate Bridge torn apart is amazing. But there's no story behind them and no build up to that big final sequence to make us care. Thanks to the political forces behind the camera, The X franchise has a forgettable ending and will be a footnote in superhero movie history like the first Batman Franchise.

Skip this movie and look for the two episodes of the old X-Men cartoon: Apocalypse Rising and Come the Apocalypse. They actually tell this same story better in one hour than this confusing movie does in 90 minutes.",1149120000,,4293,4.682119205298013
7682435,4,B01CE00Q5C,"The Last Stand is decisively the weakest film in the X-Men `Trilogy'. Director Bryan Singer was replaced by Brett Ratner, who, like Singer, never made a sci-fi film before; but while Singer took a restrained and dramatic approach to the genre, Ratner behaves more like a child with a new toy and plays the high-budget special effects to excess. Dramatically, The Last Stand is not as convincing as the first two parts; it does continue the action/soap opera combination that characterized the first two films - as well as the X-Men comics - but the romantic side, namely the love interest between Wolverine and Jean Grey, fails to deliver. Hugh Jackman gives a performance that is hardly as strong as in the first two films, and other than Ian McKellen - clearly the best actor in the whole trilogy - who does as breathtaking a job as he always does - there are no characters here that are very interesting by their own right.

That's another major problem the film suffers from - there are way too many new characters, and very few of them are interesting enough, even if most of them are well-cast. That same problem was apparent in the first film, which introduces all the main characters in a very short span of time; what made the second installment the best one was that it focused mainly on a tight group of main characters, leaving more room for drama. Iceman, Juggernaut (a wasted performance by the fantastic Vinnie Jones), Callisto, Kitty Pryde, Colossus, Pyro and the rest are half-baked characters, mainly in it for the action scenes; Angel - who was marketed as one of the lead characters - has a remarkably small side bit. The only new character that really made a mark was Hank McCoy AKA Beast - played, in a bit of casting genius, by Kelsey Grammer.

But all complaints and grievances taken into account, although the film is not very strong dramatically, and has serious pacing problems with scenes that drag out with not enough action to balance them - when the action does come it's spectacular. The final battle of the film is the most impressive action scene in the trilogy, thirty minutes of beautifully shot and choreographed mayhem and destruction. It's a credit to Ratner that he took very bold decisions of letting a large number of main characters die, making a sequel - although possible - very unlikely; and he really let go and went all the way with the carnage, making this final scene a feast to the eyes. This is where the large number of new characters finally makes itself worthwhile, and for any fan of sci-fi and high-effect action this scene is a pleasure.

The Last Stand is not as good a film as the first two X-Men's, but it's a very well made action film. If that's what you're looking for, then you'll love it. If it's drama you're after, you'll be less impressed, but there's still McKellen, always a pleasure to observe, who plays a stronger part here than in X2. A worthy conclusion to the X-Men trilogy.",1148947200,,2951,4.638623326959847

Two brief prologues; the first explaining how Jean Grey came to Charles Xavier's school twenty years ago, the second showing a young boy, seven or eight, trying to hide his wings from his father by cutting, grating and shaving them off begin ""X-Men: The Last Stand"". Then the action picks up at the dam, where ""2"" ended. Scott, a.k.a. Cyclops (James Marsden) is taking the death of Jean (Famke Janssen) very badly and decides to ride off on his motorcycle. Soon, he finds himself at the lake and the dam and is surprised when Jean appears and walks towards him. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) picks this up as well and sends Storm (Halle Berry) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to the location. There, they find an unconscious Jean and only Scott's signature glasses. They return to the school and Xavier puts Jean under, trying to control her bad, reckless second persona, Phoenix. Meanwhile, Beast (Kelsey Grammer), the Secretary of Mutant Affairs, learns Worthington Pharmaceutical has created a cure for the Mutant gene, news which instantly divides both the Mutant and Human communities. Magneto (Sir Ian McKellan) fears it will be used as a weapon against the Mutants and is determined to destroy it, but first, he has to release Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), who has been captured by the government. Along the way, we meet new characters as the story leads to a dramatic confrontation on Alcatraz Island, where Worthington Pharmaceutical is based, and storing the source of their cure.

""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is pretty much the definition of a `summer movie'. A ""sequel"", based on a ""comic book"", filled with lots of ""special effects"" and ""action""; these are the buzz words you are likely to find reprinted in the newspaper ads, touting the merits of the film. ""Last Stand"" has a surprising amount of story as well, but the story doesn't help develop the characters, new or old, or some of the relationships. If you haven't seen the previous two films, you might be lost.

As the story begins working through its machinations, certain characters stand out, others fade into the background for large stretches of time. The new characters are given particularly short shrift. We quickly meet a new man who can turn himself into metal and seems to be very strong, but I didn't ever hear his ""X-Men"" name. At one point, Wolverine says ""Hey, Tin Man?"", but I suspect this was his sarcastic persona at work. The character seems to be around to simply provide strength. Another new student, a girl, who makes Rogue (Anna Paquin) jealous because her boyfriend, Bobby, aka, Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), shows an interest in her, can walk through walls and allow things to pass through her. Again, didn't catch her name. Magneto picks up a more interesting lot, including Juggernaut (a buffed up Vinnie Jones), who can run through anything, picking up incredible speed, and a guy who can replicate himself multiple times. Unfortunately, the film doesn't do a good job of creating all of these characters in a memorable way. I honestly couldn't remember many of their names and had to look them up on imdb.com.

Also, the filmmakers make some strange choices regarding plotting. They introduce a particular story line and then the action cuts abruptly to another character or part of the story. You would naturally assume to return to the first story in the next scene, but more often than not, the filmmakers visit another storyline, then another, sometimes providing lengthy vacations from the first scene, before returning. At this point, you may have even forgotten the first scene. For instance, we visit an ominous government caravan transporting Mystique under heavy security. She has a funny exchange with one of the guards inside the large windowless truck. Then the action cuts to something else, and then something else again. Later, we join Magneto and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) addressing a crowd of Mutants. The villain soon learns one of the Mutants can sense where other Mutants are. ""Can you locate someone for me?"" Oh, right, he has to help Mystique escape. Three scenes later, we see an exterior shot of the mysterious caravan and Magneto standing in the middle of the country road.

As the story begins unfolding, the filmmakers capture our attention with the sheer spectacle of everything; lots of action and special effects. But we don't learn anything about the characters, making it merely an exercise. As Wolverine and Storm run around (oddly, Storm is the only `good' Mutant never referred to by her human name) we see them in action, remarks are made to help establish something about their characters, but we never learn the meanings behind the remarks. As we meet the new characters, we don't learn about them either. Why is Angel (Ben Foster), Worthington's son, trying to cut off his wings in the prologue, but as a young man he seems very reluctant to take the cure his father has developed? In the first two films, director Bryan Singer provided these answers, or at least clues to them. Brett Ratner is more interested in blowing things up and using an incredible arsenal of special effects.

Also, this is the first time I have ever felt that a villain was, well, sort of stupid. There is a rich tradition of super villains concocting outlandish plans for world domination and, yes, they tend to do stupid things. For instance, how often have villains stopped to tell James Bond their entire plan, only to give him the opportunity to free one of his hands? Hey, Blofeld! That's all it takes. One hand. But Magneto's plan in ""Last Stand"" has a fatal flaw. After he learns Worthington Pharmaceuticals has the source for their cure on Alcatraz Island, he decides to retrieve it and destroy it. Okay, check. No problem, so far. He'll just take a ferry or some ship to get there, right? Wrong. He decides to uproot the Golden Gate Bridge and move it to provide a walkway to the Island. An impressive sequence, providing a lot of work for Special Effects wizards, but how does this make sense? Through these actions, Magneto has provided both the X-Men and the military with an easier way to get to the Island and hamper his efforts.

""Last Stand"" is fun, mindless entertainment. But it could've been so much better. It is definitely not at the level of the previous two entries.

Now that Bryan Singer has ""Superman Returns"" out of his system, hopefully he will return to helm ""X-Men 4: The Next to Last Stand"". Oh, trust me. There will be a sequel, despite all the statements from the actors about ""Last Stand"" ending the trilogy.",1148947200,3,6542,4.844364937388193
7682437,5,B01CE00Q5C,"Imagine removing the slow burn between action scenes of the first movie, ramping up the action scenes of the second movie, and throwing the result (together with a dozen more mutants) into one film. That's what you have with XMTLS. Fans who cheered in the theater during the second film when Wolverine killed the guy in the kitchen will get more than their fill of claw-slashing action.

XMTLS is an incredible film and easily the best of the series. While it's true they probably tried to put too much into one short film (this is the shortest of the three for some reason with the largest cast), Ratner and company do an admirable job of pulling it off for the most part. While rumors abound this is the last one due to contract problems with certain ""Stormy"" stars, this film proves if nothing else that the X-Men universe can survive without the whole cast. There are enough heroes waiting in the wings to get treatments that we can afford to lose anyone not willing to return.

The film pulls off some key moments in powerful ways. The problem is that it tries to pull off TOO MANY key moments and therefore loses the impact of most of them. Yes, we finally get to see the Danger Room. Yes, The Angel finally makes an appearance (for about ten minutes of film time). Yes, The Beast is every bit as cool in the movies as he is in the comics (Grammar does an amazing job of perfectly portraying Hank McCoy's intellect while pulling off some amazing fighting moves). And hey, they've thrown in Juggernaut, Colossus, Sprite, Psylocke, Madrox the Multiple Man, Arclight, Marrow, and Spike. And Iceman finally ""ices up""!

What did they do wrong? In adding so many characters, there's not enough screen time for them. Rogue uses her powers ONCE early in the film when she could have been used in a great way during the climactic battle scene at the end. The death of a MAJOR character ten minutes into the film is only alluded to rather than shown (which is a rip since we've stuck with this person through two other films). Speaking of deaths, this film pulls out all the stops. The Xavier Institute's backyard goes from scenic to a graveyard in ONE FILM! Shouldn't we have spaced these out a little?

Still, despite giving too much in too little time (this could have easily gone over the two hour mark without making anyone upset), this is the best film of the series. Hugh Jackman adds a depth to the character of Wolverine with one scene that truly shows how he's grown from the previous two installments. Storm becomes a central player to the team finally. And we see the Colossus/Wolverine ""Fastball Special"" from the comics. Ratner even throws in a little curve of his own after the credits finish rolling to show there could still be life in the franchise if anyone's interested. I'd say we definitely all are! Cut down the cast a little (for heaven's sake, lose Magneto! The ""Mutants are superior to Homo Sapiens"" routine has gotten too old and the guy's more of an irritation than a menace now), add some faces to give us more fun (Gambit could appear to add some spice to the Rogue/Iceman/Sprite love triangle), lengthen the movie (by at least a half hour to give us a breather between explosions), and keep giving Wolverine people to slash and we'll all be happy! A highly recommended movie!",1148860800,4,3302,4.601018675721562
7682438,4,B01CE00Q5C,"Well there was so much doubt about this movie and it is finally out. In my opinion they did a good job. We start the movie with Charles and Eric going to Jeans house to bring her to the school. We then skip to the future and it seems that the X-MEN are training. Awesome indeed. Scott seems to be a depressive state and is also getting messages from Jean. He leaves to go to the lake where she died. We also find out that a cure has been produced. Magneto has found out and is furious. Cyclops gets to the lake and Jean is still contacting him. In a furious rage he blasts into the lake and wakes Jean up. He seems egstatic but well -------. Back at the mansion Hank informs them of the cure and in storms word ""Theres nothing to cure. Nothings wrong with us."" Xavier feels that something is wrong and tells Storm and Wolverine to get to the Lake. They find Jean and get her back to the mansion. Then we learn what the truth is. To protect Jean from getting out of control Xavier needed to put psychic blocks on her. Unfortunately she has broken free of them and he needs to put them back up. Before he can do this she gets away. I think this is where I will stop. The movie gives us a good character developement with all the mutants that were there before. There really is no sense in bringing more mutants into the equation and getting us confused. No matter what people say. I think seeing the mnutants that were in the movie was fine. Everyone get their fill. Of course the movie didn't follow the original story of Phoenix merging with Jean and going into space and everything. I think the reason why Ratner didn't do all of that was because of budget and it would have been way too CG'd and taken the quality away. I am a believer of the comic book I know the stories. This was a good adaptation.",1148601600,,1803,4.198847262247838
7682439,2,B01CE00Q5C,"What a let-down this movie was.

I've always been a huge fan and avid reader of the X-Men.  What made them exceptional was the incredible character development, intricate plotlines that involved moral dilemmas and inter- and intrapersonal struggles.  It was never boring -- the human aspect to things kept it real and gave it depth.

The movie has none of this depth.  It does have some exemplary special effects.  But I have to say -- it's really frustrating when they reduce almost all the newer characters to mere cameos... They just tease you with a little bit of special FX to illustrate their powers, but then fail to do *anything* with the character for the entire movie.  Most of the characters are mere 'bit' parts -- even (strangely enough) Professor Xavier and Magneto.

As for what other people have said regarding the acting: I agree full-heartedly that the acting is flat and uninspired.  Neither Patrick Stewart nor Sir Ian McKellen are given the opportunity to showcase their incredible talent. (Nor is Kelsey Grammer.)  Hale Berry is horrible.  Hugh Jackman makes a convincing Wolverine, but you really wish they'd explore his character more.

So what to say?  I saw the movie because I love the X-Men; but the movie did not fulfill its potential in the least.",1148601600,3,1277,4.856481481481482
