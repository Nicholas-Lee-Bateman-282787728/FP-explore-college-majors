768688,5,6304048947,"The Legend of 1900 was a wonderful, uplifting surprise.  The music, the unique story and cinemetography blew me away. A different story set on a ship, and I was drawn in from early on.
Take a chace on this one. It's not your everyday, here today, gone tomorrow movie!!!!",1080864000,12,270,4.510204081632653
768689,5,6304048947,"Despite the little attention this movie has gotten, and the varied, sporadic comments and reviews, ""Bodies, Rest and Motion"" is the most wonderful thing I have seen in years. The four actors (Fonda, Stoltz, Cates, and Roth) could not do better to bring to us a very subtle, touching, and elegant portrayal of loves come and gone and lives living on threads. There's no action here, and very little actually happens, but the dialogue and the attention to details are so strong, you find you don't need anything more; you can simply revel in each actor's beauty and condition. You have to watch this movie more than once, and you have to cry at times, it's that good. I'm scratching my head why this movie did not make greater acclaim. Either I'm going mental, or the world is just missing out.",1079136000,12,792,4.624113475177305
768690,5,6304048947,"I cannot recommend this movie more!  I am so happy to know that their are such beautiful souls in the world, such as the writer of this tale.
Thank you to the writer and director and the players!!
This has a fabulous cast and incredible score.",1068681600,11,243,4.282608695652174
768691,5,6304048947,"This touching movie, set in a fictitious Arizona town, has been officially labeled a ""comedy"" by the studio.  Indeed, Tim Roth's portrayal of the non-committal boyfriend has its grin-grabbing moments: ""Ya looking or buying?""
However, this story is much more dramatic than anything comedic.  I've seen the movie more than a dozen times and am always drawn to Fonda's loneliness, Roth's apathy, Stoltz's self-assurance, and Cate's empathy.
Coupled with a deeply emotional soundtrack, ""Bodies, Rest and Motion"" is a MUST HAVE.  It's about time (10 years) this movie was sent to DVD!
But, when the studio says that these characters are ""hilariously intertwined,"" don't believe it!",1053734400,24,676,5.3584905660377355
768692,5,6304048947,"I remember seeing this film at the theatre when it came out and have rented it a few times since. The storyline revolves around the four central character played by;(Phoebe Cates, Bridget Fonda, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz) and set in the fictitious town of Enfield, Arizona.
Although the plot is relatively simple, the dialogue and scenes move along smartly, and I am a fan of the four actors. The chemistry between Bridget Fonda and Eric Stoltz is seamless, perhaps because they used to be married to each other in real life.
Tim Roth is great as the disgruntled TV salesman, and Phoebe Cates does a superb job playing the sane one of the group...",1035849600,5,643,4.649122807017544
768693,4,6304048947,"This is a great film, but alas, not everyone will like it.  First off, there's no ""plot"", not in the conventional sense anyway.  This is a film about people and the strange things people do.  The aim of this film is not to tie up loose ends or give you a 'warm happy feeling'.
This is what I call a 'reality' film.  Its like a 48 hour window into someone else's life.  Because of that, the pacing is slow and there is no slapstick comedy.
This is the type of film that doesn't fit into a actual genre.  Its not a romantic comedy or a romantic drama.  Its just a film.
If you like watching film just for the sake of watching film, try this one.
If you watch films purely for entertainment value, you may not have the patience for this one.",989366400,2,738,4.118881118881119
768774,5,6304048947,"Acting aside, because it's very, very good . . . let's talk the creativity of the story and music. This is a totally unique plot of a baby named ""1900"" who grows into a successful man entirely within the confines of an ocean liner. Successful how? He's a gifted pianist, who can compete with the best jazz pianists in the world such as Jelly Roll Morton, with whom 1900 has a piano duel! Quirky. Funny. Poignant. Heartbreaking. Uplifting. But the MUSIC! There is some amazing piano work of this gorgeous score by Ennio Morricone (Cinema Paradisio). The romantic ballad 1900 plays toward the later part of the film tugs at the heart strings. Musical scenes are hugely entertaining. The duel, of course, is great fun, but when 1900 plays the grand piano during an ocean storm as he, on wheels, ""dances"" around the ballroom floor is musically exhilarating and hysterical. Marvelous ""little"" award-winning film. ""Bodies, Rest, & Motion"" . . . Meh!",1383868800,,943,4.827160493827161
768775,4,6304048947,Drama and dark comedy in one with some of the best actors of any generation. Everything was well done and we need more movies like this out there.,1371427200,,146,4.25
768776,5,6304048947,"This review is about ""The Legend of 1900""; I haven't watched the other movie with this set yet.  ""The Legend of 1900"" is a lovely, memorable movie; someone called it a ""fable for adults"" and it does have elements of fable/fantasy about it, but it is very beautifully done. This film made me go looking for more work from Tim Roth as I was not familiar with him and thought he was mesmerizing in this movie. It is puzzling that this film didn't seem to have gotten as much attention as it should have, but I'm telling everyone about it now - long after its original release! The music is also wonderful - soaring and lush, jazzy, ragtime and foxtrot, walz and beautiful orchestration.  Love the CD soundtrack, too!  The song at the end sung by Rogers Waters is just so lovely and moving; Roger Waters of Pink Floyd wrote the lyrics and sings the only vocal piece in the film, at the very end. Wonderful. Great movie and great music and both stay with you long after viewing.",1278892800,,973,4.424581005586592

768779,4,6304048947,"DVD was great.  Only complaint was I had to purchase another DVD of which I had never heard of, in order to get The Legend of 1900. Delivery was quick.  I would have given this 5 stars if I didn't have to purchase an unknown DVD with it.",1258502400,,237,3.9166666666666665
768780,5,6304048947,"My emotions were stretched to their limits.  The mood of the film was magic.  The only other film that leaves me sobbing at the conclusion is ""La Strada.""

The Actors were perfectly suited to their roles.  The story and writing was way above most of the good films out there today.  Every detail was perfectly finished.  The sets were magnificent and it was easy to see that a lot of money was spent to frame the Actors and Story.  I was very impressed.",1256342400,,453,4.385542168674699
768781,5,6304048947,"The legend of 1900 is one of the best movies l have seen. If you love piano and a great performance from Tim Roth then you will love this.

He is haunted and inspired by the story, and whenever I am reminded of it, I am too. I'm buying it today to give him for Christmas. I can't wait to see it again.",1222300800,,324,3.642857142857143
768783,2,6304048947,"I watched this movie with friends and almost immediately had to fast forward thru the opening titles as the female singers were so annoying. Our first surprise was that the film was less 'romantic comedy' as promoted than a meandering drama. The desert locale was tranquil and beautiful; Bridget Fonda and Eric Stoltz were well cast and interesting to watch; Phoebe Cates was appealing as the sane-but-boring ex-girlfriend; but even halfway into the storyline you never really cared about the characters or their situations. As my girlfriend pointed out, Tim Roth captures the homeless look perfectly (even his teeth which appear he has been chewing rocks) and she awarded him the title Most Unattractive Actor in a Film, EVER. Our advice, SKIP IT as there are other worthwhile films that feature the same talented actors.",1218499200,4,822,5.0962962962962965
768805,5,6304048947,"I saw this movie on a flight between Hong Kong and Seattle. However, I fell asleep and missed the ending. I looked for several years before I finally found it. The Legend of 1900 was a wonderful movie and a great story. The ending was different from what I thought happened and my efforts to find it was well worth it! I highly recommended it.",1172966400,2,343,4.292307692307692
768806,5,6304048947,"This is an excellent movie that didn't get much press, but when I found it through this vendor at such a reasonable price, I couldn't resist.  It was shipped promptly and arrived in just a few days in excellent condition.  I'm very pleased with my purchase experience with this vendor.",1170806400,,285,4.68
768807,5,6304048947,"I originally saw only a small portion of this movie on TV, but enough so that I purchased the DVD. Seeing the entire movie brought every thing into focus and using my own ranking scale, I gave it a strong B+.

The story line is unique, the characters and characterization wonderful and I have recommended it to many friends who I think will appreciate it. It is for people who have a sense of adventure and a fair degree of sensitivity, so I have been selective about my recommendations.

As for Bodies, Rest & Motion; I felt uncomfortable in viewing the first 15 minutes of it, so didn't bother watching the remainder.",1167782400,3,619,4.517857142857143
768808,5,6304048947,This was something completely different. What Hollywood doesn't produce anymore. A quirky somewhat melancholy movie that has many fascinating visual and auditory highlights as well as some darker moments that grab you and keep you thinking.,1145404800,,240,5.694444444444445
768809,5,6304048947,Haven't seen the other movie but had to own 1900.  Good story and acting. The music scene during the storm is one of the most memorable of *any* film.,1145318400,2,150,4.172413793103448
768810,4,6304048947,"The Legend of 1900 is an outstanding flick, truly great.  Bodies, Rest & Motion is one of those flicks that you keep watching because you're hoping it has to get better.  It never does.  Don't bother with buying the combo of the two flicks.  Just get Legend.  Only because Legend is such a strong 5 stars by itself keeps me from rating the combo lower.",1131494400,16,352,4.3538461538461535
768811,5,6304048947,"I bought this combo, quite frankly, because I wanted The Legend of 1900.  I still haven't watched the other movie but the deal was so good that I couldn't pass it up.  I got both movies for less than the cost of the movie I wanted.  The Legend of 1900 is a remarkable story of the human psyche told with magnificent music, humor, wonderful acting and beautiful photography.  I don't usually watch a movie more than once and so I own very few of them..but this one needed to be mine and I never tire of watching it.",1122940800,31,514,4.214285714285714
768812,1,6304048947,"I got this film by default as it was coupled with the ""Legend of 1900"" in a 2-DVD pack. I thought goodie ... I really like Tim Roth and in ""1900"" he is sparkiling, brilliant and ultimately very moving.

The opening music of ""Bodies..."" is about the best thing about the movie, and it keeps coming back throughout the film, which is a plus (stops you chucking things at the TV out of frustration anyway).

The rest of the movie is a complete pile of pants. The characters are universally unlikeable. Roth seems to try his best with the rubbish script but fails as he has least likeable character of the bunch. You come away not knowing or caring about any of them. Absolutley nothing happens in the movie (unless you count a totally gratuitous 'get your kit off' sex scene which isn't even well acted).

I have seen some lame films in my time but this really takes the cake. The characters were stoned though most of the film, and I can only assume some of the positive reviewers followed their example whilst watching.

The amazing thing is it comes with a full length commentary and various other odds and ends. I started to watch the featurette, but the first 2 minutes were so self serving and pretentious I couldn't watch it. There is no way anyone could provide an interesting commentary!

If I could give less than one star I would, as it is all I could do was put the DVD in the bin. I retained the DVD case though, it was worth more.

Interestingly the double DVD set is considerably cheaper than ""Legend of 1900"" on its own. I'd guess that's because anyone who is prepared to sit through this rubbish deserves a break on the other title.

My advice - buy ""Legend of 1900"" at full price and save yourself the grief!",1114214400,10,1723,4.416403785488959

7860222,4,6304048947,"Bodies, Rest, and Motion is a nicely imperfect little film. It has these sensual, emotional, mistaken, and serious qualities that are quintessential 90s. Recommended to anyone who is in the mood for an indie drama.",1443398400,,214,5.142857142857143

I also thought ""That's probably more than the picture made in a nationwide opening in the theaters!""  Does that get split fifty-fifty, the government and the studio?",1404259200,,326,4.701754385964913

Have seen The Legend 4 times so far.  Once in the theatres, twice on satellite and  once since getting the CD just yesterday.

Don't know what I love more about the story - Life on a Cruise Line in the years before the Great Depression, the great music along with the great musicians, the apparel of the times or the tragedy of the times and circumstances. You owe it to yourself to take a chance and see if you are tantalized by this movie and will remember specific scenes that touch you long after the last note has died!",1396051200,,651,4.225806451612903
