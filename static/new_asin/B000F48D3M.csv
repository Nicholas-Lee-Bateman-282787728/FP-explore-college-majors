2550888,1,B000F48D3M,"Regardless of the film content (All the Pretty Horses is quite good, but I refuse to watch Geronimo Pan&Scanned, so I've yet to see it)...Sony has done it again.

As usual, they recycle a release that used to contain both Wide and Fullscreen options and put it out--under the SAME UPC--without widescreen, eliminating any interest I have in their product.

But this time, oh boy, this time, the packaging states ""2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen"" under Geronimo. TWICE. On the back of the slipbox the two discs come in, AND on the back of the slimcase Geronimo itself is packaged in. Despite that, it's a re-formatted P&S pile of junk.

So hey, double trouble!
A mix of a bad DVD-authoring choice AND false advertising! Well done Sony Home Entertainment!",1206403200,34,750,4.889763779527559

2550901,4,B000F48D3M,Like both of these movies. Have always been a fan of western movies and these fit the bill.  Too bad they are not on Blu-ray..,1398816000,,126,4.04
2550902,5,B000F48D3M,"I specifically want to address the DVD Geronimo: An American Legend. Not only did the makers of this movie do an outstanding job picking the cast, but the movie depicts the closest to the real truth about the surrender of Geronimo.",1395100800,,231,4.658536585365853
2550903,5,B000F48D3M,I loved Wes Studi as Geronimo.  The other movie was poor I probably will not watch it again at all,1388448000,,98,3.9

2550905,5,B000F48D3M,"""All the Pretty Horses!"" ~~ I purchased this movie (even though I had seen it before) because I wanted my own copy.

2550906,5,B000F48D3M,"matt damon is a great actor and brings realism to any role he plays.
the mexican prisons were bare and gritty,the land is barren beauty.
The movie  depicts the wild rough and tough west.
 There were enough love scenes with  ms. cruz to soften
things for  women viewer .  i gave movie  a  high score because i
enjoyed movie and thought
it was a good western. i am a female who loves and have watched many western movies.",1360195200,,419,4.294871794871795
2550907,4,B000F48D3M,"This movie is delicate yet powerful. I love the three boy characters who take their chances with Mexico.
The compassion shown for this rag a muffin kid who is following Matt and friend across the barren desert into Mexico is so real. At times it gets violent, to which is true of that time and period, and you didn't just ride into a rich man's world and start getting serious with his pretty daughter, or you will find yourself, like Matt did, on the wrong side of a Mexican Prison. Never been to one and don't want to find out for myself, but they are, I hear every bit the hell whole they are reported to be.

The end is justifiable and I like it. Matt has to explain some things to an American Judge who has the same attitude Judge Roy Bean had with justice, but it all comes out fair and safe for two of the three that went.",1346630400,2,829,4.149068322981367
2550908,1,B000F48D3M,"Agree wholeheartedly with reviewer on misrepresentation of aspect ratio by Sony on dvd Geronimo:An American Legend as part of the double feature ALL THE PRETTY HORSES and GERONIMO. I checked out the description in INDB and several internet retailers before I decided to purchase. I was very ticked off at Sony for their deceptive advertising and will contact Sony directly. Amazon cannot be expected to inspect each dvd to see if it is in aspect ratio stated on dvd box and literature,but they have the clout to reprehend Sony in this matter.",1206921600,23,542,4.9021739130434785
