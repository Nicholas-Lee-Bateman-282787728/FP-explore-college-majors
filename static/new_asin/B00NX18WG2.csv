This 1946 film seems to use high-speed (and high-contrast) film, which results in a stark effect. It is also a low-budget film, comparable to some 'film noir' of the 1940s. It is about the search for a Nazi war criminal, hiding in plain sight. Franz speaks American without an accent, and shows up as a new teacher in a rural college. He romances and marries the no longer young daughter of an important man (Chief Justice). But another war criminal, who got religion, searches for Franz. Franz realizes that Meineke is being followed, and kills him to keep his secret. Meineke is also a problem since he has got religion; and religion (or personal ideals) is always a threat to any secular system whether Fascism, Communism, or Plutocracy.

Nazi hunter Edward G. Robinson arrives, posing as an antique dealer. His comments on old silver shows he has studied his cover story. There is also a clue to Franz: an obsession with clocks (symbolizing a devotion to man-made mechanical devices, like social systems). Little by little the facts come out to point to Franz. Franz tries to kill his new wife, since she knows too much about him! This symbolizes his self-destructive philosophy, which leads to his fall from the top. Can anyone hide in a small town?

This film was an unheeded warning. It would be over thirty years later before we learned about ""Operation Paper Clip"" and other schemes to harbor Nazis in America. It wasn't just rocket scientists. The film also records a more innocent time, when college students ran through the woods as a pastime.",1491177600,,1579,4.797794117647059

8680872,4,B00NX18WG2,"I had seen this film years ago and am glad to have it as part of my film library. Though I enjoyed this movie, it isn't one of my favorite works of Loretta Young. I was never a great fan of Mr. Wells. Edward G. Robinson was his usual excellent self. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who likes classic noir movies with intrigue.",1480636800,,343,4.212121212121212
8680873,5,B00NX18WG2,"This inventive and suspenseful thriller is like rediscovering a long lost friend. To see this film restored and digitally remastered is truly an incredible thing to behold! Starring heavy hitters such as Orson Welles and Loretta Young, I can fully understand why this screenplay was an Academy Award nominee! Full of suspense and apprehension, this is a cliffhanger that holds true despite it's age. We have a Nazi fugitive (Welles) who has created a new life and new identity, but there is a man hunting him down intent on unraveling the guise. All of the players in the film are part of this mystery unfolding, the hardest character is the fugitive's wife (Young) who must come to terms with the possibility of who her husband may truly be. One of my favorite classics of all time, The Stranger, gets better with time and age.",1429401600,,828,4.756944444444445
