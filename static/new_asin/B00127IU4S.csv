3078164,5,B00127IU4S,Received promptly - delighted with service and quality of dvds - exactly as described. Highly recommended.,1211673600,,106,5.6875
3078165,5,B00127IU4S,"This series is one of the best ever! The characters are all so deeply developed throughout the years. It takes a simple theme -a family living through the Great Depression era and into WWII, and makes everyday life so interesting. I've watched it over and over , and will continue to. Thank you Earl Hamner, for sharing your story with the world! I'd recommend ""The Waltons"" to anyone!",1211673600,,385,4.676470588235294
3078166,5,B00127IU4S,"An all time fan since childhood. It takes me back home to Rattle Snake Mountain, Raymond, Maine !",1211328000,,97,4.444444444444445
3078167,5,B00127IU4S,"As we all know, the Waltons go through many changes this season.  Many are not happy changes, but they are depicted very well, and in a very moving way.  I laughed and cried with them all over again.  I have to say, I feel this season produced some of the best written episodes of the series.  This was truly one of the finest series ever put on tv, and I feel privileged to have grown up with this family; it reminds me so much of my own family.",1210636800,5,446,4.034090909090909
3078168,3,B00127IU4S,"Actually, when Richard Thomas left the show was when the Walton's began its descent to despair.  I've loved the Waltons for as long as I can remember but am sorely dissapointed in season 7.  I think the episode that did it for me was ""The Changling"".  I mean, c'mon...Poltergiest?  Let's get real here.  Or should I say ""unreal?""  No wonder Michael Learned wanted to leave the show.  The look of utter disbelief on her face as she did this show is so apparant.  Judy Norton-Taylor's peformances a s a woman hooked on speed was so laughable.  No wonder she's not working on TV now.  Erin really grew up to be a pretty young thing but her hair was so frizzy in the episode where she and Mary-Ellen get an apartment. I guess for me, the best was ""The Empty Nest""...however, I was hoping that this would have been done in a different way.  Can you imagine the series beginning with a funeral in process.  Oh, the tears would really flow if it only showed the people in the congregation's expressions during the funeral.  That would have created a huge need for kleenexes.  I won't be purchasing future seasons.  Seven seasons is enough for me.  I have ""The Homecoming"" all the way up to Season 7.  That's plenty for now.",1210291200,12,1216,4.47945205479452
3078169,4,B00127IU4S,I suggest you watch the last episode of season 6 prior to viewing the first episodes of season 7.  It really makes you appreciate the relationship between Will Geer and Ellen Corby.,1209427200,23,181,4.65625
3078170,5,B00127IU4S,This is television as it should be done and since we do not have these kind anymore watch the dvds.,1206403200,12,99,4.0
3078171,4,B00127IU4S,"While this season may not be the best season of ""The Waltons,"" it certainly is a season to be remembered.  Right from the start, the beloved grandfather has died, and everyone is grieved in ""The Empty Nest 1&2.""  Will Geer had apparently died between season six and seven, leaving Grandma (Ellen Corby) quite alone.  Ben, now working the mill with his father, marries Cindy.  More importantly, WWII begins with the bombing of Pearl Harbor--where Curt is stationed, and he dies as a result.  Olivia (Michael Leanerd) finds out she has turberculosis and leaves the Walton family for a while.  Elizabeth has her 13th birthday, Jim-Bob gets a tattoo, and Jim-Bob joins the Army.

Truly one of the most interesting seasons ""The Waltons"" had, however the disappearance of Richard Thomas and Will Geer is keenly felt.  One could say that this was also one of the more weaker seasons of the show, but still one worth watching.  The following is an episode list of Season Seven:

1. The Empty Nest (1)
2. The Empty Nest (2)
3. The Calling
4. The Moonshiner
5. The Obsession
6. The Changeling
7. The Portrait
8. The Captive
9. The Illusion
10. The Beau
11. Day of Infamy
12. The Yearning
13. The Boosters
14. The Conscience
15. The Obstacle
17. The Parting
18. The Burden
19. The Pin-Up
20. The Attack
21. The Legacy
22. The Outsider
23. The Torch
24. The Talespin
25. Founder's Day--with a guest appearance by Earl Hamner, creator of the series.

So, everyone, relax and enjoy the changes this wonderful family endures.  And remember, things in your family change too.",1200787200,113,1559,4.712177121771218

3078198,5,B00127IU4S,"For me, personally, this is where I draw the line for the end of the Waltons series.  The next two years, to me, are too contrived and not believable.  It happens with most long-running series. So I opt to end my purchases here for the series, although I did buy the movies that followed afterward.

The Waltons are like old friends and I was very sorry to hear of Earl Hamner's passing recently.  To those ""Waltons"" - TV and real-life who are still with us - thank you for giving us something worth re-watching at least every year.",1465516800,,532,4.3979591836734695

My children do not know what it was like grow up in the early 1900's. I'm not that old! But do know how hard we had it growing up as a child. Family was always first, church, school, then social life. There was a moral that you learned fromThe Waltons. Some of todays children, 2000's, do not  know about morals. Technology has taken over some of todays children and they're missing what's truly important. Family time. I love all the characters on the Waltons. how they were so considerate of each other. You don't see consideration from many folks these days. I loved John Boy's journal at the end of every show, well, up til he was no longer on the show, of the experiences  of the day. I have many favorite episodes but can not remember the titles.",1397088000,,874,4.388888888888889

I hated to see it end.  I am now watching the 6 movies made later.  wish there was more.  I am from Virginia and my husband grew up in the mountains nearby.  We were born in the 1930's but the life style, the family values, etc. were the same for us as children.",1392076800,,422,3.9523809523809526
3078266,3,B00127IU4S,"In 1978, after the filming for season 6 was completed, Will Geer (who played Zebulon the grandpa) died. This meant Zebulon was also ""killed off"" the show. The season opens up with The Empty Nest which focuses slightly on this topic.

Besides that, season 7 brings a whole array of change on Walton's Mountain. John-Boy is still in NYC so he's not in this season at all. It's 1941, and Japan has dropped a bomb on Pearl Harbor, killing many (an important character is killed here too but I won't spoil it). This triggers America's entrance into World War 2, which will serve as the show's main plot  until the 9th and final season. Grandma is back from the hospital after suffering a lethal stroke, now barely able to talk and getting only temporary screen time. After this season, she seems to disappear, presumably going under more medical care.

Season 7 also introduces some new people, like J.D. Pickett, Erin's new employer as she tries to help in the war effort. I personally hate J.D and think he's annoying. Also introduced in this season is Ben's suddenly pronounced wife, Cindy. At first this new marriage seems doomed to failure but it works.

All these new happenings on Walton's Mountain may seem like a shock. They did when I first saw this season. This season sees the show transitioning from the family atmosphere to a more mature/war one. The show feels empty without Grandpa and barely featuring Grandma. It's still The Waltons though, getting through all of this together.",1390348800,,1491,4.767441860465116

3078295,5,B00127IU4S,"When THE WALTONS first came on DVD, I was quick to purchase the early seasons.  I have fond memories of watching it along with HAWAII Five O on Thursday nights. Even though I enjoyed the series for all 9 seasons plus the TV movies, whenever I had a chance to watch the final seasons in rerun, I didn't.  I guess I wanted to remember THE WALTONS in the depression era. Perhaps I was trying to avoid the John Boy replacement no one liked. I avoided watching any of the WW2 episodes and stopped collecting the DVD's at season 5.  As time passed, I enjoyed watching seasons 1-5 episodes over and over.  The stories are much more entertaining than modern TV, especially ""reality"".  One day I saw that Amazon.com had great prices on the later seasons, so I purchased seasons 6 - 9, a bit leary but the price was right.  Turns out I really enjoyed season 6. It had been many years since CBS had aired these episodes and that was the last time I had viewed them. That brings us to season 7.  Even though I remembered many of the plots, these memories were decades old and watching season 7 episodes were truely a joy.  Earl Hamner's characters came back to life and I could enjoy watching episodes where I didn't remember how they ended.  Fans of Erin will love the THE PIN UP episode. Fans of Jim Bob will enjoy THE TAILSPIN.  Elizabeth shines in THE CHANGELING.  You'll see Mary Ellen fight drug addiction in THE OBSESSION. The 2 part THE EMPTY NEST is a fitting tribute to the great Will Geer.  All that and WW2!  Need I say more?  Buy it!",1345420800,,1534,4.355633802816901

One other thing, it bugs me when the writers forget past story. On
""The Obstacle"", in Johnboy's letter he said Mike Paxton was his college roommate, but John Boy lived at home all through college, except in ""The Fledgling"" in the 4th season, where he was trying to earn money for his printing press. In that episode his roommate was Mike Paxton, but only for a couple of days and to me that doesn't qualify as a college roommate. He also stayed at college every now and then, but they never said who his roommate was, but to
me that also doesn't qualify as a college roommate. Also I don't remember the family ever meeting Mike Paxton, yet not only did John Boy say in his letter that Mike Paxton was close to the Waltons, the family had rememberences that never happened. In the 5th season ""The Hawk"" the ending narration said Reverand Buchanan was going to remain for many years, yet in this season we get a new minister in ""The Yearning"".

3078321,4,B00127IU4S,"This is the seventh of nine seasons of ""The Waltons"", a family-oriented drama set in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. This season originally aired in 1978. This is the first full season without the central character of John-boy Walton. During the first five seasons, John-boy was the focus of the show, as he is the narrator, and his journals and writings are the source of the individual episodes. John-boy leaves his mountain home at the end of season five, and appears for several episodes at the end of season six. With John-boys absence, the show now focuses on the other members of the Walton family (and friends). In my opinion, this season is the first where the writing suffers a bit. To be sure, there are some very good episodes in this season, but there are several episodes which lack the quality and feeling typical of earlier Walton seasons. Even with an ""uneven"" season in terms of quality, these episodes are still worth watching (and owning), as they deal with real family and personal issues in a humane and loving way. The Waltons is a classic TV series that beat the odds, in that it had a loyal audience without resorting to special-effects, gratuitous violence, or overt sexual themes. It is entertainment with a message suitable for the entire family. I watch The Waltons with my children and they love the shows. Walton time is family time.

Three episodes stand out in my mind as exceptional. The first is a touching two-part episode devoted to the death of Grandpa Zeb Walton (Will Geer), who died between seasons six and seven. This is a touching episode that will bring tears to every viewer. Ellen Corby (Grandma Walton) who suffered a real-life stroke, reprises her role as Grandma Esther Walton, and her long life with Zeb is recounted in flashbacks. Each of the grandchildren say goodbye to Grandpa Zeb in their own touching way.

The ""Day of Infamy"" is another major highlight as Pearl Harbor is attacked and Mary-Ellen's husband, Curt, is apparently killed. Judy Norton gives a profound performance in a sorrowful episode.

The third episode that stands out is ""The Parting"". In this episode, Oliva Walton learns she has tuberculosis and has to go away for treatment. Oliva will make only guest appearances from this point on in the series. Saying goodbye to a loving mother is a heart-rending experience.

It is truly a treat to watch the Walton children grow up and deal with the associated problems of maturity and living in the throes of the beginning of America's entry into World War II. Although not the quality of previous seasons, this is still quality tv and is highly recommended.

3078330,5,B00127IU4S,"It's 1941, and World War II is in full force. Everyone in the Walton clan is affected -- John, now in great demand with his lumber for government work; John-boy, off in London as a correspondent; Mary Ellen, whose doctor husband Curt is stationed at Pearl Harbor; Jim-Bob, who dreams of enlisting and becoming a pilot; Jason, who begins to feel he might be a conscientious objector to the war itself. The others find the war invading their everyday life, from shortages to more work to overall worry and fear.

There are also a number of episodes featuring other mountain residents and their lives -- the discrimination still faced by Verdie Foster and her family; growing marital and personal problems between Ike and Corabeth Godsey; and the revelation of a long-buried secret for Miss Emily Baldwin.

Life may be changing drastically for the Waltons, but one thing remains steadfast -- viewers can be assured of quality episodes about the tight-knit family they've enjoyed watching in seasons past.

Still, there are countless life (and mountain) traditions and situations that endure reassuringly, even in the face of war and hardship. Now 13, Elizabeth is struggling with her feelings about growing up -- often resulting in turmoil, as seen in ""The Changeling"" and ""The Yearning."" Mary Ellen, mother of baby John Curtis, struggles to balance her nursing career with raising her son. Grandma, still grieving after Grandpa's death the previous summer, struggles to overcome the effects of her stroke and resume the life she's known for so many years.

3312661,5,B00127IU4S,Received promptly - delighted with service and quality of dvds - exactly as described. Highly recommended.,1211673600,,106,5.6875
3312662,5,B00127IU4S,"This series is one of the best ever! The characters are all so deeply developed throughout the years. It takes a simple theme -a family living through the Great Depression era and into WWII, and makes everyday life so interesting. I've watched it over and over , and will continue to. Thank you Earl Hamner, for sharing your story with the world! I'd recommend ""The Waltons"" to anyone!",1211673600,,385,4.676470588235294

3312664,5,B00127IU4S,"As we all know, the Waltons go through many changes this season.  Many are not happy changes, but they are depicted very well, and in a very moving way.  I laughed and cried with them all over again.  I have to say, I feel this season produced some of the best written episodes of the series.  This was truly one of the finest series ever put on tv, and I feel privileged to have grown up with this family; it reminds me so much of my own family.",1210636800,5,446,4.034090909090909
3312665,3,B00127IU4S,"Actually, when Richard Thomas left the show was when the Walton's began its descent to despair.  I've loved the Waltons for as long as I can remember but am sorely dissapointed in season 7.  I think the episode that did it for me was ""The Changling"".  I mean, c'mon...Poltergiest?  Let's get real here.  Or should I say ""unreal?""  No wonder Michael Learned wanted to leave the show.  The look of utter disbelief on her face as she did this show is so apparant.  Judy Norton-Taylor's peformances a s a woman hooked on speed was so laughable.  No wonder she's not working on TV now.  Erin really grew up to be a pretty young thing but her hair was so frizzy in the episode where she and Mary-Ellen get an apartment. I guess for me, the best was ""The Empty Nest""...however, I was hoping that this would have been done in a different way.  Can you imagine the series beginning with a funeral in process.  Oh, the tears would really flow if it only showed the people in the congregation's expressions during the funeral.  That would have created a huge need for kleenexes.  I won't be purchasing future seasons.  Seven seasons is enough for me.  I have ""The Homecoming"" all the way up to Season 7.  That's plenty for now.",1210291200,12,1216,4.47945205479452
3312666,4,B00127IU4S,I suggest you watch the last episode of season 6 prior to viewing the first episodes of season 7.  It really makes you appreciate the relationship between Will Geer and Ellen Corby.,1209427200,23,181,4.65625
3312667,5,B00127IU4S,This is television as it should be done and since we do not have these kind anymore watch the dvds.,1206403200,12,99,4.0
3312668,4,B00127IU4S,"While this season may not be the best season of ""The Waltons,"" it certainly is a season to be remembered.  Right from the start, the beloved grandfather has died, and everyone is grieved in ""The Empty Nest 1&2.""  Will Geer had apparently died between season six and seven, leaving Grandma (Ellen Corby) quite alone.  Ben, now working the mill with his father, marries Cindy.  More importantly, WWII begins with the bombing of Pearl Harbor--where Curt is stationed, and he dies as a result.  Olivia (Michael Leanerd) finds out she has turberculosis and leaves the Walton family for a while.  Elizabeth has her 13th birthday, Jim-Bob gets a tattoo, and Jim-Bob joins the Army.

Truly one of the most interesting seasons ""The Waltons"" had, however the disappearance of Richard Thomas and Will Geer is keenly felt.  One could say that this was also one of the more weaker seasons of the show, but still one worth watching.  The following is an episode list of Season Seven:

1. The Empty Nest (1)
2. The Empty Nest (2)
3. The Calling
4. The Moonshiner
5. The Obsession
6. The Changeling
7. The Portrait
8. The Captive
9. The Illusion
10. The Beau
11. Day of Infamy
12. The Yearning
13. The Boosters
14. The Conscience
15. The Obstacle
17. The Parting
18. The Burden
19. The Pin-Up
20. The Attack
21. The Legacy
22. The Outsider
23. The Torch
24. The Talespin
25. Founder's Day--with a guest appearance by Earl Hamner, creator of the series.

My children do not know what it was like grow up in the early 1900's. I'm not that old! But do know how hard we had it growing up as a child. Family was always first, church, school, then social life. There was a moral that you learned fromThe Waltons. Some of todays children, 2000's, do not  know about morals. Technology has taken over some of todays children and they're missing what's truly important. Family time. I love all the characters on the Waltons. how they were so considerate of each other. You don't see consideration from many folks these days. I loved John Boy's journal at the end of every show, well, up til he was no longer on the show, of the experiences  of the day.

We were born in the 1930's but the life style, the family values, etc. were the same for us as children.",1392076800,,422,3.9523809523809526
3312763,3,B00127IU4S,"In 1978, after the filming for season 6 was completed, Will Geer (who played Zebulon the grandpa) died. This meant Zebulon was also ""killed off"" the show. The season opens up with The Empty Nest which focuses slightly on this topic.

Besides that, season 7 brings a whole array of change on Walton's Mountain. John-Boy is still in NYC so he's not in this season at all. It's 1941, and Japan has dropped a bomb on Pearl Harbor, killing many (an important character is killed here too but I won't spoil it). This triggers America's entrance into World War 2, which will serve as the show's main plot  until the 9th and final season. Grandma is back from the hospital after suffering a lethal stroke, now barely able to talk and getting only temporary screen time. After this season, she seems to disappear, presumably going under more medical care.

Season 7 also introduces some new people, like J.D. Pickett, Erin's new employer as she tries to help in the war effort. I personally hate J.D and think he's annoying. Also introduced in this season is Ben's suddenly pronounced wife, Cindy. At first this new marriage seems doomed to failure but it works.

All these new happenings on Walton's Mountain may seem like a shock. They did when I first saw this season. This season sees the show transitioning from the family atmosphere to a more mature/war one. The show feels empty without Grandpa and barely featuring Grandma. It's still The Waltons though, getting through all of this together.",1390348800,,1491,4.767441860465116

3312792,5,B00127IU4S,"When THE WALTONS first came on DVD, I was quick to purchase the early seasons.  I have fond memories of watching it along with HAWAII Five O on Thursday nights. Even though I enjoyed the series for all 9 seasons plus the TV movies, whenever I had a chance to watch the final seasons in rerun, I didn't.  I guess I wanted to remember THE WALTONS in the depression era. Perhaps I was trying to avoid the John Boy replacement no one liked. I avoided watching any of the WW2 episodes and stopped collecting the DVD's at season 5.  As time passed, I enjoyed watching seasons 1-5 episodes over and over.  The stories are much more entertaining than modern TV, especially ""reality"".  One day I saw that Amazon.com had great prices on the later seasons, so I purchased seasons 6 - 9, a bit leary but the price was right.  Turns out I really enjoyed season 6. It had been many years since CBS had aired these episodes and that was the last time I had viewed them. That brings us to season 7.  Even though I remembered many of the plots, these memories were decades old and watching season 7 episodes were truely a joy.  Earl Hamner's characters came back to life and I could enjoy watching episodes where I didn't remember how they ended.  Fans of Erin will love the THE PIN UP episode. Fans of Jim Bob will enjoy THE TAILSPIN.  Elizabeth shines in THE CHANGELING.  You'll see Mary Ellen fight drug addiction in THE OBSESSION. The 2 part THE EMPTY NEST is a fitting tribute to the great Will Geer.  All that and WW2!  Need I say more?  Buy it!",1345420800,,1534,4.355633802816901

One other thing, it bugs me when the writers forget past story. On
""The Obstacle"", in Johnboy's letter he said Mike Paxton was his college roommate, but John Boy lived at home all through college, except in ""The Fledgling"" in the 4th season, where he was trying to earn money for his printing press. In that episode his roommate was Mike Paxton, but only for a couple of days and to me that doesn't qualify as a college roommate. He also stayed at college every now and then, but they never said who his roommate was, but to
me that also doesn't qualify as a college roommate. Also I don't remember the family ever meeting Mike Paxton, yet not only did John Boy say in his letter that Mike Paxton was close to the Waltons, the family had rememberences that never happened. In the 5th season ""The Hawk"" the ending narration said Reverand Buchanan was going to remain for many years, yet in this season we get a new minister in ""The Yearning"".

3312818,4,B00127IU4S,"This is the seventh of nine seasons of ""The Waltons"", a family-oriented drama set in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. This season originally aired in 1978. This is the first full season without the central character of John-boy Walton. During the first five seasons, John-boy was the focus of the show, as he is the narrator, and his journals and writings are the source of the individual episodes. John-boy leaves his mountain home at the end of season five, and appears for several episodes at the end of season six. With John-boys absence, the show now focuses on the other members of the Walton family (and friends). In my opinion, this season is the first where the writing suffers a bit. To be sure, there are some very good episodes in this season, but there are several episodes which lack the quality and feeling typical of earlier Walton seasons. Even with an ""uneven"" season in terms of quality, these episodes are still worth watching (and owning), as they deal with real family and personal issues in a humane and loving way. The Waltons is a classic TV series that beat the odds, in that it had a loyal audience without resorting to special-effects, gratuitous violence, or overt sexual themes. It is entertainment with a message suitable for the entire family. I watch The Waltons with my children and they love the shows. Walton time is family time.

Three episodes stand out in my mind as exceptional. The first is a touching two-part episode devoted to the death of Grandpa Zeb Walton (Will Geer), who died between seasons six and seven. This is a touching episode that will bring tears to every viewer. Ellen Corby (Grandma Walton) who suffered a real-life stroke, reprises her role as Grandma Esther Walton, and her long life with Zeb is recounted in flashbacks. Each of the grandchildren say goodbye to Grandpa Zeb in their own touching way.

The ""Day of Infamy"" is another major highlight as Pearl Harbor is attacked and Mary-Ellen's husband, Curt, is apparently killed. Judy Norton gives a profound performance in a sorrowful episode.

The third episode that stands out is ""The Parting"". In this episode, Oliva Walton learns she has tuberculosis and has to go away for treatment. Oliva will make only guest appearances from this point on in the series. Saying goodbye to a loving mother is a heart-rending experience.

It is truly a treat to watch the Walton children grow up and deal with the associated problems of maturity and living in the throes of the beginning of America's entry into World War II. Although not the quality of previous seasons, this is still quality tv and is highly recommended.

3312827,5,B00127IU4S,"It's 1941, and World War II is in full force. Everyone in the Walton clan is affected -- John, now in great demand with his lumber for government work; John-boy, off in London as a correspondent; Mary Ellen, whose doctor husband Curt is stationed at Pearl Harbor; Jim-Bob, who dreams of enlisting and becoming a pilot; Jason, who begins to feel he might be a conscientious objector to the war itself. The others find the war invading their everyday life, from shortages to more work to overall worry and fear.

There are also a number of episodes featuring other mountain residents and their lives -- the discrimination still faced by Verdie Foster and her family; growing marital and personal problems between Ike and Corabeth Godsey; and the revelation of a long-buried secret for Miss Emily Baldwin.

Life may be changing drastically for the Waltons, but one thing remains steadfast -- viewers can be assured of quality episodes about the tight-knit family they've enjoyed watching in seasons past.

Still, there are countless life (and mountain) traditions and situations that endure reassuringly, even in the face of war and hardship. Now 13, Elizabeth is struggling with her feelings about growing up -- often resulting in turmoil, as seen in ""The Changeling"" and ""The Yearning."" Mary Ellen, mother of baby John Curtis, struggles to balance her nursing career with raising her son. Grandma, still grieving after Grandpa's death the previous summer, struggles to overcome the effects of her stroke and resume the life she's known for so many years.

8244392,5,B00127IU4S,"Season Seven of ""The Waltons"" continues the warm family drama that became a television institution.  The sad thing about a series that runs on too long is that new producers and writers are employed that compromise the quality of the series.  With John Boy gone, a lot of the scripts that could have been written for him are given to Jon Walmsley (Jason).  He is more than up to the task of being the voice of reason as Walmsley always brought a great warmth, sincerity and sensitivity...indeed he was the kindest of the Walton siblings.  Michael Learned as Olivia leaves the show mid season and a great void is left.  This void will increase as the final question three seasons unfold.  There are a couple of episodes in this season that are really bad.  The first is written by Juliet Packer, who would go on to become a soap opera writer.  She brings this style of writing to the episode called ""The Obsession"" which has Mary Ellen hooked on amphetamines.  She goes through a withdrawal period in one night which is totally unbelievable.  Withdrawal takes a long time and this sort of plot belongs on ""The Young and the Restless"", not ""The Waltons"".  The next episode is called ""The Changeling"" aka ""The Poltergeist"" which haunts Elizabeth.  This episode is laughable and totally unbelievable and one wonders why Earl Hamner, creator and upon whose life the series is based, would permit this kind of story to be told.
  These two episodes do not detract from giving the season 5 stars.  The standout episode of the season is ""Day of Infamy"" which brings the series full force into WWII.  It's a moving and tear jerking episode.  The return of Grandma (Ellen Cordy) is sad to watch with Grandpa as she is limited to two or 3 scenes.  She doesn't appear in every episode.  Her real life stroke impacted her severely but at least we get to see her.  The rest of the season is fine and compared to today's wasteland is perfection!",1523836800,,1930,4.620588235294117

I just forgot what a grumpy, old bitty grandma Walton was; and the stubborn-like grandpa Walton. However, without them, it wouldn't be The Waltons. And, just FYI, I do know that they were actors playing a part!",1484006400,,302,4.826923076923077
