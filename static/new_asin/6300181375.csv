212765,5,6300181375,"I bought this movie only because Aerosmith was in it, but now it is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It totally turned me on to the Beatles, and it can't be put down. Everytime I watch it, I find something new about  the whole thing. Billy always has something pink on, for example.  Shame on  you if you don't apreciate it enough.  I think this movie rocks, and needs  better recognition.",919814400,,396,4.283783783783784
212766,3,6300181375,"Like many movie-musicals (Grease, Xanadu, etc.), this film is intended to focus on sounds--not plot or character development.  Those looking for the latter should avoice all musicals.  This is light-hearted, plotless but  full of solid musical performances.  Conoissures can go to Cannes.",916790400,,288,5.785714285714286
212767,4,6300181375,"I took my children to see this movie when it was first released. They were Frampton and BeeGees fans and didn't really listen to the Beatles. I, however, owned every Beatles album in existance as I now own the CD's. I  never saw why the reviewers hated this movie and it's accompanying album.  The music was very well done, every song. If you wanted the Beatles then  this was not for you, but if you liked Beatles music then the performances  were fine. I loved George Burns' rendition of ""I'm Fixing A Hole Where  The Rain Comes In"" and many of the other performances were great for  the novel performances of the original Beatles music. If you wanted great  acting and directing, well then this movie is not for you. It's not a very  good movie. If you like to listen to offbeat and different performances of  the Beatles' music, I don't see how you can go wrong.",916012800,,866,4.430379746835443

212851,5,6300181375,"Picture and sound quality is great. This blu ray replaces my old DVD of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. I have a 1080p Sony HDTV and DVDs look pretty good on my blu ray player but blu rays look even better. I wish there were more bonus features like interviews and production notes but I'm guessing that most everyone involved in the making of it back in 1978 would rather it be a memory they'd rather NOT revisit. That's not my opinion just a hunch.  When it premiered back in 1978 it was panned by critics and viewers alike but at least the soundtrack sold well. The Bee Gees and Peter Frampton hit tough times after making this movie but they all survived. I've had a crush on Sandy Farina ever since I saw her as Strawberry Fields and her singing is terrific but I think this movie didn't set her career skyrocketing, unfortunately. Nevertheless, this is a silly but fun escapist fantasy musical that many will enjoy if they like those Beatles tunes.",1506470400,,961,4.491428571428571

212901,5,6300181375,"Quality transfer to DVD, Dolby surround is excellent!!

As a 10 y/old growing up in a house of Elvis & older Bee Gees, THIS movie & double LP was my ""gateway drug"" to discovering not only the Beatles, but also Frampton, Aerosmith, Earth Wind & Fire . . ., and more!!
I subsequently took up guitar lessons, the ""Beatles Complete"" being my first songbook & source of many/most of my guitar lessons.

Many of my musician buddies trash this since it's ""NOT authentic"" or ""not the original"" band, but I say: ""HEY, if it introduces ANY kid TO music, TO  so many QUALITY performers and expands your music library from there, then no harm / no foul.
I'm SURE Ringo & Paul don't mind the royalties. . . .

All the performances are TOP NOTCH, despite the silly antics of the story line itself.
Anyone remember the late-GREAT ""George Burns""???",1498521600,,832,4.526666666666666
212932,5,6300181375,"Been wanting to see this film since it came out in 1978 & I've finally seen it. It only took me 39 years to do so. One reason why I wasn't in a rush to see it is because I've heard many critics put it down. I heard someone on the radio in the 80's say if you missed this movie, you didn't miss anything.  I once heard the Bee Gees & Frampton say they regretted messing with the Beatles. But I don't think it's all that bad at all. It's very 70's such as the part with early Steve Martin in his wild & crazy excuuuuse me era. It may not be as great a musical as Grease, from around the same time, but it's an enjoyable tribute to the Beatles' late 60's music.",1498176000,,658,3.8740740740740742

212935,4,6300181375,"This is a good recording of the original movie. Yes it's cheesy. It was 1978. What do you expect? My brother used to give me a hard time when I would watch, over and over, the VHS I recorded off the TV. Although he had a copy of the movie soundtrack on vinyl, so nyah nayh nyah. This is really just one long, prototypical music video. The pop stars du jour circa 1978 did serious justice to the Beatles music. The Bee Gees are soulful and Steven Tyler is sexy and sinister. The campy songs are campy and the emotional songs do their job. Billy Preston saves the day and boogies it all home. The reason I gave it four stars is the ""bonus material"" is just the old movie trailer and previews of other movies. It would have been nice to have some sort of interviews or ""making of"" added to the disc. Maybe next year, for the 40th anniversary.",1497830400,2,839,4.217391304347826

213198,4,6300181375,"It was cheesy, but I loved it.  My son loved it, as well.  It was a cute musical way before it's time.  I enjoyed seeing the Bee Gees, and it looked like a pretty fun movie to make.  I still think Barry would have been a great actor, and Mo, ever the comedian, was hilarious!  Beatles music was great.  My son gets all excited every time Mr Mustard kidnaps Strawberry or steals the instruments.  I loved watching it with him, and enjoy the music while he watches for the tenth time. Lol!  Not meant to be taken seriously  (why would you take a movie with superhero characters seriously?!).  To the die-hard Beatles fans, don't watch if you can't have an open mind.  I love the Beatles and the Bee Gees, though for me, Beatles hold no comparison, as I wasn't yet born during their heyday.  I was introduced to the Bee Gees as a little girl by my mom, and I remain a fan to this day.  The Beatles, for me, are a bit complicated, but I do love some of their music.

If you want to laugh, and just enjoy a funny, campy, cheesy movie, then put this in your DVD player, sit back with some snacks and enjoy.  Otherwise, move on, bypass this one and don't tell the rest of us how to feel about it, or what to think.  We are all entitled to our opinions.

And I'd better be in just the right mood..or else it slays me. All props to Aerosmith as the ""Future Villain Band""..but that teenager always thought that, if you've got the money to buy rights to Beatles songs..why not have KISS as the FVB?

It's just one frickin' song after another.  And the interpretations of the songs are so cleverly twisted to fit the plot of the movie.

For example, ""Strawberry Fields"" the song is sung by a character named Strawberry Fields to help illustrate her part in the movie.  And Steve Martin's performance of ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" as Dr. Maxwell is quite memorable because he puts so much of himself into it; it was though the Beatles had him in mind when they wrote the song.

Sure, sometimes a song's connection to the plot can be a bit stretched or convoluted, but you don't really care because it's Beatles music.

Remember to watch it until the very end so you can see a chorus of innumerable celebrities singing ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band"".

I'd say that it's reminiscent of ""Xanadu"", just without the hackneyed acting.",1401062400,3,993,4.766081871345029

213374,4,6300181375,"This review is for the single DVD of 1978's ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"", the movie. This ambitious concept which included a very pricey, nearly never discounted 2-LP  record set,  started with, and will never shake the criticism of those who naturally and logically question who'd want to experience other artists performing Beatles songs? Why not the Beatles themselves? I saw the movie in 1978 when first released because I felt it would be a slice of seventies pop culture. And that's what it is. No more, and no less. Reminds me of another Universal opus, released two years after ""Pepper"", ELO and Olivia Newton-John's ""Xanadu"".  Both films are enjoyable if thought of as streams of music videos, sights and sounds.  Did ""Pepper"" hurt the lofty star-perches of Frampton and The Bee Gees? Probably. But this film has many good points. First and foremost, the chance to enjoy the music of Frampton and the Bee Gees together. Robin and Maurice are sadly no longer with us. It's a heck of a nice keepsake to have this ""Pepper"" screen time of Barry, Robin, and Maurice together during their peak popularity and chart splendor. Then there are the hits! Robin's ""Oh! Darling"", Earth, Wind and Fire's ""Got To Get You Into My Life"", and Aerosmith's ""Come Together"". George Burns, Steve Martin, Billy Preston, and other notables take part and sing. Newcomer Sandy Farina is superb as Strawberry Fields, and if her singing is indeed her own voice, she is doubly dazzling.  Finally, last but not least, is the legendary final ""Sgt. Pepper Reprise"" singout, featuring perhaps 100 or more music/recording legends and stars, a virtual ""who's who"" of late 70's pop and rock. How in the world did they assemble all of these folks at one time for the cameras?  Frankie Valli, Carol Channing, Gary Wright, Leif Garrett, Jose Feliciano, Wolfman Jack, Mark Lindsay, Donovan, Peter Noone, Bruce Johnston, John Stewart, Yvonne Elliman, Monte Rock III, and Seals and Crofts, just to name several. Incredible! That all-star chorus alone makes this movie highly recommended!  The sound and picture are excellent. Extras include the trailer and scene selection. Really helpful to have scene selection. Fun to replay the final scene to search for favorite stars in the big group chorus.

It's reputation delegated this to a box in a closet, where I found it the other day. Steeling myself for the worst, I put it on. Yep, it is that bad. I've watched about half of it, not sure if I have the desire to watch the rest.

There is a point during Nowhere Man where Peter Frampton is looking around as if to say ""I was in Humble Pie, but look at me now!"". The scene was shot from too far away to tell if his expression says ""Yeah, this is great"" or ""Just shoot me now"".

The song arrangements are hideous, the performances are worse. Case in point: Here Comes The Sun. And I Want You (She's So Heavy) goes on and on. And on. And on some more.

So far, the only thing I can say in favor of this movie is you get to see what Donald Pleasence looks like with hair.

I suppose I'll have to watch the rest of the movie to see Aerosmith and Alice Cooper, but I get the impression that my opinion of this movie will not be swayed.

Update July 15, 2013. Watched the rest of the movie. It doesn't get any better. Alice Cooper rockin' a 'stach that kinda makes him look like Ron Jeremy. Aerosmith was ok, until they had to act- the fight scene between Steven Tyler and Peter Frampton is one for the ages, ain't it? And the Grand Finale, I wonder how many of those people would've agreed to appear if they know beforehand what they were getting into. Judging by the look on Robert Palmer's face, I think he suspected. Johnny Winter, seriously? At least Rick Derringer was there to share your shame.

213432,1,6300181375,"It took me years to break down and watch this thing, but I just did. It's pretty bad, and it's pretty long. Not a good combination. Basically, even though The Beatles had ceased to exist in 1970, they were still one of the most popular bands of the 1970s. But no amount of influence and effort by Yoko Ono, Wings, Tom Scott or Vini Poncia or any of the cast of thousands of session musicians and hangers-on were ever going to bring the magic of The Beatles back to life. The Seventies simply didn't know how to deal with The Beatles, or the biggest (by the slimmest margin) part of their legacy,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sgt-Pepper-s-Lonely-Hearts-Club-Band/dp/B0025KVLTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>.

There had been two failed attempts at off-broadway Sgt. Pepper specials before Bee Gees guru Robert Stigwood decided it was his turn (Stigwood had made an unsuccessful bid for the band after Brian Epstein died in 1967). The window of guitarist Peter Frampton's fame was closing fast and slammed shut after this project. The Bee Gees wouldn't survive the disco backlash of 1980, and this Sgt. Pepper film brought Stigwood's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saturday-Night-Fever-Grease/dp/B00AMSLDUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saturday Night Fever / Grease</a>&nbsp;winning streak to a crashing end. The Sgt. Pepper film survives only due to the fact that it blends in with so much of the gauche/kitsch novelty of the Seventies pop culture graveyard.

Frampton (as ""Billy Shears"") leads the Bee Gees (as Pepper's Band) on an adventure to fame with a record producer (Donald Pleasence just back from the classic Halloween), while battling the genuinely funny but wasted Frankie Howerd (""Mean Mr. Mustard"") and defending their hometown, run by genial mayor George Burns (""Mr. Kite""). Frampton got the lead, and no one seemed to care that any one of the Bee Gees could sing rings around the diminutive guitarist. It's as if someone decided Ken Russell's 1975 production of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tommy/dp/B000NMTX4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tommy</a>&nbsp;had to be salvaged by bringing out a far more dire production.

Highlights are few: Earth, Wind & Fire and Aerosmith have always gotten positive marks for their performances, and admittedly, having Aerosmith as the evil ""counter"" band to Sgt. Pepper's was somewhat inspired (one wonders how the producers failed to nab KISS for the role). Sandy Farina's vocals are decent as ""Strawberry Fields"" and Dianne Steinberg's (""Lucy"") renditions aren't half-bad. The best part of the whole cringe-inducing affair, though, has to be the brief ""fight"" scene between Peter Frampton and Steven Tyler. One imagines, counter to the film, that Frampton wouldn't come out the better in that one. On the other hand, Steve Martin and Alice Cooper manage to throttle a couple of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Abbey-Road/dp/B0025KVLUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Abbey Road</a>&nbsp;songs along the way. (And according to Wikipedia, Curtis Mayfield was in the chorus at the end, but I didn't notice him, so I missed easily the most talented artist in this entire production.)

This flick is truly one of the Seventies' ""disaster"" movies, made all the worse by the fact that the music was produced by none other than George Martin. Like everyone associated with The Beatles (including, for the most part, Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starkey themselves) after the break-up the fairy dust had worn off and Martin was a mere mortal, working with such dreck as the tepid group America. His association with this project, however, is especially unfortunate, but the Seventies were strange, strange times.

In the end, as it is with Bob Dylan's songs, nobody's cover versions can rival The Beatles' originals (Jimi Hendrix excepted). It's interesting to hear the Bee Gees take on the song ""Sgt. Pepper"" itself, but their other covers on here are limp, and again, Frampton can barely sing to begin with. (For all that, it is a wonder they didn't do ""All You Need Is Love,"" but we should be grateful for small favors.) Check this one out from the library like I did if you must. Otherwise, Curtis Mayfield has a bigger part in the far superior film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superfly/dp/B0000TWMT8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superfly</a>.",1364601600,6,4546,5.81981981981982

Just watched it again last night with my 15 y/o daughter...I don't think she payed attention too much the first time we watched it...but enough that when I was naming off movies to watch, she agreed to this one. It really is something else! The latter half is better, if you can make it that long LOL But it's one of those, so incredible that they thought it'd be good...and can't help but watch things. It has its moments, but it's just a force unto itself as a whole! My daughter feels the same about it! haha It's just so bad, but at times rather compelling...but sometimes like watching a disaster you can't help but watch! I think the Bee Gees are ok in general, but their rendition of Beatles songs are pretty bland. I think their best rendition is 'for the benefit of Mr Kite'..but the rest...well, had to play my daughter excerpts of the originals she hasn't heard to show how bad the Bee Gees or Frampton verions were! And really, almost all the Frampton versions are DIRE! Does make me think how he was so big back then! And I like a few of his songs ok, but geesh, really can't sing going by this! Earth, Wind and Fire...even my daughter could see how amazing they are! They took a song and made it their own for it. Even Aerosmith's rendition of 'come together' towers over the Bee Gees and Frampton. You can kind of get a feel of who made a big effort with the songs and who just did a recording of them. She was suitable creeped out by Alice Coopers rendition! haha And Billy Preston makes his bit work too. Anyway, good entertainment in it's own way. I have a love for it, but I do like odd things, and this is an odd thing! But my 15 y/o daughter can appreciate it...but she's not a typical gal either! But an interesting moment in time with this...the 70's how only the 70's can be..reckon a shame I missed it! haha!! Worth a watch!",1356307200,2,2063,4.333333333333333

213463,4,6300181375,"My review title and star rating may not seem to match, so I'll be upfront about the criteria I'm using.  I own this movie.  I actually bought this movie after I saw it on television.  It's really bad, bad in an enjoyable ""I can't believe I'm seeing this actually happen"" way.

The couple hundred other reviews should give you a fairly good idea of what you're in for.  Lots of the people who love this movie seem to have seen it as children and really enjoy it.  Others, like myself, just enjoy classics of terrible cinema.

It is almost 100% musical.  There is only one speaking part (George Burns).  The musicial adaptations range from the unbearable (anything involving Sandy Farina -- to the reviewers who ask whatever happened to her, I reply ""People must have seen this movie.""), the unevenly comical (Donald Pleasance, anything with Steve Martin or robots), the ""huh, that's kind of okay but overwrought"" (Barry Gibb wrapping his high octane vocals around the innocent ""A Day in the Life"") to the actually good (Robin Gibb's ""Oh Darling,"" which I would actually listen to, you know, as a real song) to the done-so-well-we-don't-even-associate-it-with-this-train-wreck (Aerosmith's ""Come Together"").

Drugs and their peculiar impact on 1970s culture seem to be the only reason this film even exists.  How else would this seem like a good idea?  Why else was there nobody brave/sane enough to stand up during production meetings and say ""Come again?  What is this plot?  And why so much satin?""

The plot is . . . well, just about nothing.  Using the songs to bridge the plot was a fatal flaw, but one of many that the producers failed to avoid.  Trying to imagine a reality in which this would have turned out better isn't all that hard, but would have almost certainly involved a plot that didn't try so hard to incorporate the songs as plot elements.  The best moments in the movie tend to be those when a performer is just allowed to perform without trying to drive the plot forward.  The others range from boring to hilarious to awkwardly embarrassing for all involved.

So why watch it?

Watching it allows the viewer to experience transcendent moments of cheesy amazingness.  But it's not enjoyable enough to watch more than once or so a year.  Unless you have fond memories of this movie from childhood or enjoy deep dives into the nooks and crannies of terrible cinema, tread carefully.  This lacks the self-awareness of some other cult classics.  It's just a bad movie with loud costumes and classic song covers.",1351555200,,2527,4.793981481481482

213477,1,6300181375,"i had an interesting epiphany recently. a couple weeks ago, i reviewed the largely below-par film adapation of Kurt Vonnegut's book BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS...which i enjoyed just enough about to ultimately recommend, however tentatively. well, it's been suggested to me that, in light of the fact that i'm an admirer of Vonnegut and that BREAKFAST is easily my favorite of his books, maybe i went into the matter already determined to forgive whatever misfires i might find myself faced with. i was beginning to think the person in question might've had a point, but then it turned out i wasn't a practicioner of such bias after all. my memory had the raw nerve to dredge back to the surface a film which took someone i was even more obsessed with than Vonnegut, and reduced their work to something that made LAST ACTION HERO look like CASABLANCA.
i've absolutely adored and worshiped The Beatles for as long as i can remember, and with an intensity not unlike the one i've already mentioned toward Sherlock Holmes. (the observant reader will note that my Amazon-requested psuedonym is an amalgam of two of the most familiar (as well as best) Fab Four titles.) so i quite like the idea of a theatrical showcase for such characters as Billy Shears, Mr. Kite, and Dr. Maxwell Edison. but quite frankly, this film couldn't of been a bigger mess if Ed Wood had directed it.
the oddest thing is that, in every area other than the music, the film almost seems to be trying to distance itself from The Beatles. the band hails from a rural farming community in the American midwest, which resembles Liverpool about as much as Mars resembles Paris. to say nothing of the fact that three-fourths of the band being brothers reflects not the ""real deal,"" but the film's ersatz would-be Beatles, the Bee-Gees!! I mean, honestly.
#1 on the list of things i would've done differently is the treatment of the music. they use a very narrow selection of material culled cheifly from the SGT. PEPPER and ABBEY ROAD albums. two of their best albums, i agree - ABBEY ROAD is my very favorite Beatles album - but look what they missed. several entire albums - A HARD DAY'S NIGHT for instance, and THE BEATLES [aka ""The White Album""] - are completely snubbed. ""Hey Jude,"" ""Day Tripper,"" ""Yesterday,"" ""Penny Lane,"" ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"" ""Eleanor Rigby,"" ""I Am The Walrus,"" ""Let It Be,"" ""Yellow Submarine,"" ""Revolution,"" ""Something,"" and ""Back In The U.S.S.R."" are only a few of the indispensible classics they just couldn't accomodate. yet incredibly, the single worst song in the entire Beatles catalog, ""Strawberry Fields Forever,"" somehow made the cut.
but as it turns out that's a texbook blessing-in-disguise, because they made another mistake in making the time-frame contemporary, so what songs they do use are, as a rule, heavily disco'd up. i want to hear the disco version of ""Hey Jude"" only slightly more than i'd like to undergo a root-canal with no nitrus-oxide.
the story (such as it is) concerns some abstract, unspecified crisis for Humanity, initiated when the instruments used by the original Sgt. Pepper and his band to end World War I (don't ask how because they don't even try to explain) are pilfered from his hometown museum. the new Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, led by The Sarge's grandson, have to put a (finally) thriving career in the business on-hold to recover them. the villain(s) are repeatedly identified with the initials F.V.B., which turns out to mean Future Villain Band. there's something truly poignant about the fact that Aerosmith, in the role of the malevolent combo, deliver the film's musical highlight in their rendition of ""Come Together.""
i forced myself to watch the film a couple dozen times or so simply because i liked the sentiment. it was no mean feat, after all, for The Beatles to bring dimension to a sketchy new brand music which was, at the time, little more than this curious, unrefined bastard child of blues and country. they brought style and focus, they made rock & roll rock & roll, to use the cliche'. (they pretty much invented music, if you want my opinion. even if you don't, they still did.) so they certainly deserve the sort of tribute the concept was intended as. many's the afternoon and/or night i spent analyzing the premise molecule by molecule, desperate to find some angle that could've salvaged it. well, as i've already stated, what broke my heart most is the vast number of truly fabulous Beatles songs they missed. but alas, i can't say that including those ditties would've made the story any stronger or the futile attempts at acting any less laughable.
although it has to be said, it's an interesting irony that there've been quite a few similar projects in recent years which did the same for lesser luminaries - MAMA MIA! for Abba, AMERICAN IDIOT for Green Day - which are actually considered pieces of quality theatre as well as hits. why couldn't the single greatest act in music history pull that off? can't you ask me something easier to answer, like why the sky is blue?

[NOTE: it's been about six months since i wrote this review. i recently saw a fabulous film called ACROSS THE UNIVERSE. this masterful cinematic opus aims for and attains the majestic grandeur of which SGT. PEPPER'S so visibly falls flat on it's ass in fruitless pursuit. so my last paragraph was in error: there was an equivalent of MAMA MIA! to be found in the realm of The Beatles after all.
granted there are still a few favorites to lament the lack of (""Yesterday,"" ""Yellow Submarine,"" ""Penny Lane""), but of course if they used every highlight they'd end up with a 10 hour movie. (one could ask, what's their excuse for again using ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" in spite of the fact that it is the single weakest song in the entire Beatles catalogue? but this time that is the one and only blemish.)
maybe that's all i really needed to say in my review in the first place: run like hell from SGT. PEPPER'S and see ACROSS THE UNIVERSE instead. that's the one by which Lennon and McCartney would be flattered.
although that being said, i must say that i still quite like the SGT. PEPPER'S concept of a story about the Beatles' characters, and dare to hope someone can do the premise justice someday.]",1345766400,2,6259,4.768663594470046
213478,1,6300181375,"I saw this in the theater when I was eight years old.  Barely remembered it except I did remember that I was bored out of my mind.  Thought I'd have a better appreciation for the film now that I'm older.  Boy, was I wrong!  Had to watch it three times to get through it because I fell asleep twice.

What was everyone who starred in this movie thinking?  Anyone reading the script had to have known it sounded stupid.  Premise: Town band makes all the problems go away, ends wars, and makes everyone happy as soon as they start playing music.  Stupid, stupid, stupid!!!  Besides, who cares?  Boring enough for an adult, even more so for an eight year old kid!

Seeing this again refreshed my memory why I was so bored seeing it when I was a kid.  All my brothers and sisters went to see this with me thinking since it casted the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton that we were going to get down.  We sort of expected another Saturday Night Fever, not this boring crap of how this band makes everyone happy.

Effectively ended a few careers including Peter Frampton and Sandy Farina, who disappeared off the face of the Earth after this movie.  How did she get casted anyway?  Her singing is amateuristic, and the instrumentals to her singing sounded like something you'd hear in a grocery store or doctor's office.

This was an attempt at camp (i.e. names like Strawberry Fields, Mean Mr Mustard, Billy Shears, Heartland, etc.) that wasn't funny and fell completely flat.",1344902400,4,1464,4.547892720306513

It's so cheesy and campy and so very odd to see the way they dress Peter Framptom at times (ROFL), but I can't help loving it and always will. I showed it to my daughter-in-law for the first time the other day. She loved it too and asked when she got home from work the next day if we could watch it again, so we did. It's a completely bizarre visual experience, but do I dare say that Aerosmith's version of Come Together rivals that of the original (I can see purist Beatles fans getting ready to fling things at me in the streets as I think this lol). Nevertheless it's fun, it's campy, it's cheesy...choose your definition. It always makes me smile and I think Peter Frampton, Aerosmith, etc. did a great job with the covers.

213482,1,6300181375,"Ok, BeeGees' music is a definite guilty pleasure.  I loved them back in the day.  (Full disclosure-- my first single record purchase was the Eagles' ""Hotel California""  first album-- Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"", just to show how out of my usual genres BeeGees are)

I saw this movie when it first came out-- the BeeGees were still owning the music scene with the SNF soundtrack.  Peter Frampton was, imo, an odd choice, but whatever (I've always wondered if Andy wasn't the first choice, but he always had his own issues).  But the movie was BAD.  Awful.  One review I saw back in '78 stated, ""Frampton's best scenes are the ones where he's unconcious.""  Its not wrong.  TCM showed this back in 2000 or so and I recorded it, just to see if it was as bad as I remembered.  Yeah, even worse.

Several fundamental/fatal mistakes were made with this vehicle (let's face it, it was a BeeGees vehicle).  First, if they had attempted to make it more British/Common Market, at least the boys could have had some lines and a story would probably have been easier to hang on the soundtrack.  They couldn't lose the accents for the US setting, and were not actors-- its basically a silent movie with the Beatles' re-done (in a very 70s style) Sgt. Pepper album.

They did line up lots of cameos.  Some are fun, some just painful.  The script, what there is of it, is simply knocked together with the nagging feeling that whoever was doing it might have been smoking something at the time.

For a much better 70s romp, you just can't beat ""The Warriors.""  This one is just (sorry BeeGees, as much as I love your music) AWFUL.  (And definitely not for the under-12s, at least in my house these days.)",1337126400,2,1696,4.516447368421052

213484,4,6300181375,"The Beatles (like George Lucas' Star Wars universe) are held in such reverential esteem, that doing anything with their creative output which doesn't actually involve them seems a little (or a lot) sacriligious.  People generally want to see George, Ringo, Paul and John perform Beatles' songs (like audiences want to see Luke, Han and Leia light-saber their way through the Star Wars galaxies ... not Jar Jar and Jango, etc.).  Plus, the Sgt. Pepper's album is such an iconic 60's album, to hear it updated to the disco 70's is a little surreal.  I had the same problem with the film 'Across the Universe' a few years back -- the interpretations were dirge-like and contained none of the joy of a really joyful Beatles' song.  When this movie came out in 1978, critics were standing in line to throw rotten fruit at it, and audiences ... well, they didn't line up at all.  BUT -- with a few decades behind this all-star movie featuring The Bee Gees and Peter Frampton as the Beatles stand-ins, maybe we can enjoy it on a camp level.  Unlike 'Across the Universe', it is clear that this movie was not made to be taken seriously.  It is a colorful, campy movie with a soundtrack that is nothing but Beatles.  And the Bee Gees sing most of it, and those boys could sing.  There probably is no real point in describing the plot of a movie that exists to supply images to the music of Paul and John, but basically an evil real estate agent is turning a really nice small town into a really awful small town, and it is up to Barry, Maurice, Robin and Peter to colorfully and musically save the day.  And they do.  And the movie is quite a lot of fun.  It's really an artifact from the late 70s, when disco-inspired sounds were giving way to the alternative sounds of the early 80s.  We'll never see its like again.  This is a fun movie that existed to be fun.  No more and certainly no less.",1331251200,,1886,4.426086956521739

Your stomach will definitely churn something harder and less flavorful than butter when you watch a cast of 1000 idiots butcher the Beatles' later song catalog.  If this is supposed to be Sgt. Pepper, why do they borrow songs from Abbey Road, Magical Mystery Tour, and Revolver?  Why would Paul Nicholas be singing ""You Never Give Me Your Money"" when it actually makes you long to hear goofy old ""Heaven on the 7th Floor?""  Why is the otherwise cool old coot George Burns doing the--as of late--Peter O'Toole and embarrassing himself in something that should only be HALF as good as Rock My World (And that movie is bad!)?  Why do the BeeGees and Frampton never utter one spoken line?  My guess is they got lucky as supposedly they actually wanted out of this mess!  Why are the covers on here so lousy, with the exception of Earth Wind and Fire's ""Got to Get You into My Life?""  Hell, I can play that great rendition without subjecting myself to this howler.  Why does a weather vein bring everything that didn't make sense in the first place full circle?  All these questions must be answered by Robert Stigwood who will surely suffer hard time in entertainment hedonism purgatory.  Just as well, because he unleashed some of the worst music on us in 70s pop history, so he should be punished for that too.  All he missed was giving us the Starland Vocal Band's little ""masterpiece,""  ""Afternoon Delight.""

If you have children, don't rent or buy this movie, or you will unleash another Oasis, Patrick Juvet, or Patrick Bateman on society.  For the love of God, don't torture them in this way!

It blipped in and out of the theaters pretty quickly - thank heavens for the dollar theater. It was well worth the sticky floors and cushion-free seats to watch this movie over and over. We must have seen it a dozen or more times while it played there.

People are far too critical of this movie which is meant for nothing more than pure fun. It didn't take itself seriously, so why should we? Peter Frampton is amazingly sexy, the Bee Gees more than hold their own while performing these classic songs, and Sandy Farina is beautiful, ethereal, and the perfectly innocent opposite of the over-sexed Lucy as they vie for Billy's affections.

The plot, though rather loose, follows the traditional good vs. evil. Mean Mr. Mustard is creepy as Strawberry's stalker, Steve Martin as Dr. Maxwell is in top form, Alice Cooper (on a break from his rehab stint to film his scenes) is perfectly careless as a mind control freak, Aerosmith will make your skin crawl - as they were intended to.

The high points of this film are: the music (how can you go wrong with Beatles music, especially when performed by some of the greatest musicians of the time), the love story between Billy and Strawberry (I still bawl like a baby during Framptons version of Golden Slumbers), George Burns, and the end scene which is a time capsule of the stars of the 70's.

I bought the two-disc soundtrack.  I bought the iron-on decal T-shirt with the film's logo.  I bought the bubble-gum cards.  I even bought the paperback novelization of the movie.  All that stuff is now dust in the wind.  I was devestated, to put it mildly, when the reviews came out.  The critics weren't just negative they were downright hostile.  The local critic in the Philadelphia Inquirer, Desmond Ryan, called it the assassination of Sgt. Pepper.  John Lennon was asked his opinion of the film and he stated that he loved it and showed the interviewer a royalty check from the two-million copies sold soundtrack.  It's been thirty odd years since I've seen the film so I really didn't know what to expect.  My reaction is a mixed one.  The films strength lies in the arrangements of the Beatle songs by their producer George Martin.  The mixes, for the most part, retain the power of the Beatle originals and are performed terrifically by the cast members.  The foremost liab0ility is in the script which rock scribe Henry Edwards attempts to cobble a cohesive storyline from a few Beatles albums.  It's possible if Edwards utilized more of the Beatles catalogue they may have had a better screenplay. Then of course the old addage that actors can't necessarily sing and singers can't necessarily act comes into play.  Regardless, I think time has been kind to this chestnut that was inexplicably reviled in it's day.  If this was a cynical exercise I could understand but the makers and performers are sincere here in making this an engaging enterprise.  I was debating whether to give the film three or four stars but I'm partial to the latter because of the goodwill it engenders.",1289520000,4,1844,4.7784810126582276

What a difference a few months can make. Except for Aerosmith, Earth, Wind & Fire, Steve Martin and Billy Preston, no one looked good in this embarrassing rock musical. Beatles producer George Martin somehow got suckered into working on the equally disastrous soundtrack album. The careers of the Brothers Gibb and co-star Peter Frampton (not to mention Robert Stigwood's entertainment empire) never truly recovered from this wrongheaded decision to imitate the inimitable Fab Four.

But the end result?  We get alot of horrible sounding off-key performances of good songs by familiar stars.  No, we can't expect them to sound as wonderful as The Beatles themselves, but we would expect them to sound as good as they do with their own songs.  This was excruciating to watch and listen to.  Even the worst of ""American Idol"" hopefuls sounded better than these better known artists did back then.  I think, Aerosmith, Earth Wind and Fire, and maybe Alice Cooper did the most tolerable songs in this movie even though the visual concept was still campy and weird and uncomfortable to watch.

The worst of the worst of this film was the concept of Mr. Mustard (with his terrible singing) and the stupid concept of the two female robots that ride with him in his command center bus-like vehicle.  And these female robots sang some songs too.  God, it is horrible.  And their computer with it's horrid electro-static noise and cheesy campy screen messages was so poorly conceived.  If this film didn't have the robots, I might give this film an actual tangibly deserved, one star rating (as it stands, I can't post a rating less than one star, and believe me, I would).

I thought ""Across the Universe"" was silly too, but not as bad as ""Sgt. Pepper"".  Who knows, maybe in another 10 years, we'll be bashing ""Across the Universe"" too.",1278892800,7,1518,4.675471698113207

For those of you who may have seen this film during countless re-runs on UHF TV or even had the chance to see it in the theater then this is $8 for a lot of great memories.

Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band is a time capsule of the 70s.  From Earth, Wind and Fire, to one-hit-wonders like Stargard, to hard rock acts like Aerosmith...to Steve Martin doing his Wild and Crazy Guy act...and of course George Burns.  Then there is the grand finale that lets you play ""Name the 70s celebrities"" with Sha-Na-Na, CCR, Heart, Robert Palmer and Wolf Man Jack among about a hundred other 70s celebs.  This movie features 70s sound effects, 70s special effects, 70s fonts and you will even spot a few old 70s video games in the background.

The best thing about this DVD is that is sports a THX Remastered soundtrack.  Someone loved this move enough to let us hear the best version of this movie you ever have.

Yes, it's campy.  Yes, its bad.  Yes, there's more ""reacting"" than real acting in this film.  Fortunately for those of us who can appreciate this from a nostalgic perspective will enjoy it.  Everyone else will probably just find it annoying.

213505,2,6300181375,"I always heard about this musicial film,and could never find a copy around. Now I understand why. It's the musical version of 'Burn,Hollywood,Burn'.Where you have a great director,great idea,great actors and a gawd-awful script. If the film came out between 1967 through 1972,it would have scored a hit with everyone. Riding the vibes of the times. By 1978,the Hippie era was long over. Disco and Country clashed on the radio-waves. The folky 60's sound was now dusty and by-passed. This film really suffers from poor timing. Even Stigwood's 'ABBA-The Movie' and their American tour was two years post-prime,sadly. ABBA would have bloomed over the Beatles,if they were allowed to sprout and germinate sooner,in the Spring of 1977. When 'ABBA-Gold' was released ,everybody wondered where these musical treasures had sunken. Fastforward to 1986. MTV aired the original Monkees shows in a non-stop video marathon. It touched off an explosion of interest in 60's nostalgic music. And the freezed-dried seeds of the 60's were beginning to sprout about once again. This film has all the greatest music groups,singers and actors of all time. From George Burns to Aerosmith,from Steve Martin to the BeeGees,Billy Preston to Peter Frampton. And still this film felt strained. I think it was more Stigwood paying tribute to the musical genius of the Beatles. The four lads from Liverpoole had long moved on,and I can't say whether they appreciated the movie at all. They were probably more amused than entertained. The film has a quirkey charm to it,and has its share of loyal Lonely Heart club devotees. I saw the film once,and once was seeing enough for me. To each,their own.",1264636800,,1668,5.113553113553113

However I find this movie rather disappointing even for Bee Gees fans or Beatles fans. The story of the movie is quite confusing and even the segments of different bands are included in not very well chosen way. There is no explicit or persuasive read thread in the movie. There may be some similarities with Magical Mystery Tour movie. After all - I don't want to be to unjust - the interpretation of Beatles songs of the great majority of the artists is very good.,1252972800,,606,4.5181818181818185
213513,4,6300181375,"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is certainly not the most artsy film I've ever seen; but it's pretty good entertainment if you just relax and don't expect too much as you watch it. It comes from an era of glitzy excess; these `70s campy, over-the-top numbers come directly from those times. The plot moves along rather smoothly; I didn't get bored and the music was performed very well. Indeed, the plot is told mostly through a web of interwoven songs originally performed by The Beatles; and what we don't get from that we learn from George Burns as he narrates. The casting is good; we even get appearances by Steve Martin and Alice Cooper; Earth, Wind & Fire play themselves. The choreography is outstanding. The cinematography works well and although the special effects look dated they still add something to this picture. The quality of the print is fairly good; it could have been a little sharper but this is a minor disappointment.

When the action starts, we get a bit of background narration from George Burns who also plays the current mayor of Heartland; in fact he does the narration in bits and pieces throughout the film. We learn that the town of Heartland, America sent its special band, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, to end the First World War! The band continued to enjoy success through the decades until Sergeant Pepper died at a local function in 1958; then it's up to his grandson Billy Shears to form the band anew with greedy and jealous Dougie Shears (Paul Nicholas) as manager and Billy's three friends Mark, Dave and Bob Henderson (Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb and Maurice Gibb of The Bee Gees) to be the other members of the band.

Great things start to happen when a powerful recording executive at Big Deal Records recruits and signs Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band to a huge contract. All of a sudden they are on the scene in Hollywood although Billy's girlfriend Strawberry Fields (Sandy Farina) misses Billy terribly. Bad things also begin to happen; the band members attract the attention of Mean Mr. Mustard (Frankie Howerd); Marvin Sunk (the 'Sun King') (Alice Cooper) and the organization they work for, the Future Villain Band, or FVB for short (played by Aerosmith).

Then there is the roller coaster ride of events. Mean Mr. Mustard steals the instruments away from Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band; and he proceeds to ruin Heartland as well. The band begins to have real difficulty playing their concert venues; and the once happy recording executive is now so stressed out that he's losing his hair! Strawberry Fields herself even runs away from home to find Billy in Hollywood because she is miserable without him in Heartland.

But the plot can still go anywhere from here. What happens to Strawberry Fields when she gets to Hollywood--and after? The complete answer may surprise you. How will the band members get back their instruments, if they can ever get them back at all? And what about Mr. Mustard and his sidekick ""The Brute"" (Carel Struycken)? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch and find out!

The extras aren't all that much, unfortunately. We get the theatrical trailer and ""recommendations"" for other DVDs that are tacky advertisements.

Overall, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is all in good fun and you'll enjoy it if you can take it in that way. It's not fine art; but it's not all that bad, either. I recommend this for fans of the actors in this movie; and if you like Beatles tunes performed by other artists you may want this for your collection, too. In addition, people who enjoy campy movies will not be disappointed.",1249344000,,3614,4.802250803858521
213514,4,6300181375,"I first saw this movie as a teenager.  Yes, there was no spoken dialogue, which was odd, but overall the movie is a celebration of the Beatles music. Whatever you think about the premise of the movie, the standout is the soundtrack.  Which I wore out on the turntable.  Frampton and the Bee Gees do a fantastic job of interpreting the Beatles music.  The orchestrations are melodic and the harmonic vocals are beautiful.  Kudos to Aerosmith as the Future Villain Band (terrific casting), and even George Burns does a nice job with Fixin a Hole. Dianne Steinberg gave a standout performance even though she said not one word.  Her eyes told you everything. The best part of this movie is the exciting finale where everyone from Minnie Ripperton to Chita Rivera to Carol Channing to Bowser come together to sing the Sgt. Peppers song.  My friends and I were kvelling every time someone new got a close-up!  How ever did Stigwood get all those artists together?  That must have been some video shoot. My girlfriends and I knew we were not going to the movies to see Macbeth. The story was sort of rubbish, but the costumes, colors, sets and direction was first rate.  This movie is also not for kids, as there are several drug references, a particularly goulish death for Strawberry, a subsequent funeral, and then Billy tries to kill himself.  My favorite scene is when the Lonely Hearts Club Band lands at the airport and B.D. and the evil Lucy take them on a limousine ride along to the song I Want You. It's a scream..... that everybody wants somebody that doesn't want them!  This movie is fun to watch, and Frampton is yummy.  This movie does a better job with using tunes that originally had nothing to do with other, and weaving them into some common thread, much better than say ....Mamma Mia did with the Abba songs.

The 1978 musical starred a pair of Billboard chart monsters - Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees - in a thin story line that ties into the classic album of the same name by the Beatles. The last scene - ""Our Guests at Heartland"" - is the most fun, as it is a fitting tribute to the classic album cover and features an incredible cast that includes Tina Turner, George Harrison, Donovan, Linda McCartney and Heart.

But to get to that point means to view director Michael Schultz pouring on the glitz, though nothing can ultimtately save the exploits of Frampton (Billy Shears) and the Gibb brothers from the incredibly weak script that centers on keeping the musical magic going in Heartland, U.S.A.",1229558400,2,950,4.894409937888199
213522,4,6300181375,"The Monster That Is Sgt Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band!

  Well You've all waited for my next review and instead you get this analysis of cheese, I know.  I like Pepper for all its Gibby guffaw, but this review won't be easy.  I'll mention what's good and quirky first then topple on the bad and the nitpicks!  Tooshay!

  Well,  there's The Opening Footage. At least they tried to have a backstory, however hokey it is. Burns narration helps fill in the gaps.  The varying renditions of the title song are a nice touch.  Sgt Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band introduces The Hendersons, and sure I am Gibb-biased, but the Bee Gees sound like The Beatles.  Maurice once again seems to get the short end of the stick, stuck in the back fiddling with the drums, but oh dear Lord get Robin away from that toy guitar!

  With a Little Help from My Friends brings Peter Frampton's introduction while wearing a pink shirt and white overalls with hearts all over them.  My 6 and 7 year old nieces don't even wear that.  I don't care for Frampton at all really, but I shall try to be nice in my review. I like how Strawberry is supposed to sing along, but she doesn't quite know the words does she?

  Fixing a Hole to me means fixing the loophole in George Burns' contract that says he gets to sing. The only good part is...um. My nieces sing along and like the little kiddies playing about with Burnsy.  Yeah, that's it.  This really is a very poor rendition of the song, and Burns isn't Fred Astaire.  Do we really need another poor imaginary sequence that does nothing to advance the story of the Band making it big? Oh let's skip this one. Getting Better always gets stuck in my head.  The BD bad music executive is introduced here with chick star Lucy. And no I'm not mentioning his name because it gets changed in the movie, twice.  This is a good sequence though. The music sounds good and the quote unquote story is progressed through the scene. Wow.

  Here Comes The Sun is the first song presented by Sandy Farina.  It's nice to hear a female voice every once in a great while.  Farina's rendition is okay. The hearts on Billy's truck are a cute tie in, too.  However, Heartland's best mode of transportation is a hot air balloon? Totally implausible, but it's all in good fun.  Especially when Robin's character Dave pukes. Frampton's acting when he pretends to wake up is very weak.  Besides, are we supposed to believe nothing happened between these two lovebirds on the eve one is going away to seek fame and fortune?  It's also a shame this is the only George Harrison ode in the film.

  The She's So Heavysequence is the most Tommy like of the entire film.  The movie should have stayed in this vein. Look how scary and edgy and racy the music biz is! All the singing is well choreographed, and the limo like car is funny. When did they switch to that tiny plane? And how can Lucy be driving the car, be a mannequin, a prostitute, on a motorcycle, at the pool, and the photographer?  Also, notice Maurice this sequence. He is the `what to do in the background when no one is supposed to be watching' master!

  While I praise this aspect, this sequence is also the one that you cringe at when the kids are watching, and you hope they don't ask questions.  The drinking and drug use is a bit much, much less the adult video place the boys drive by. Is this movie supposed to be dark and edgy like Tommy or cutesy cheese for the kiddies?  The bipolar nature of the movie is where it's trouble lies.

  I love it when the trashed gang wakes up to Paul Nicholas' Good Morning shout outs.  Again a tune that is strengthened by the Brothers backing contributions.  Like Getting Better, a scene that is part of the story.  Do you think they had a tough time getting all those extras of screaming girls? The little ""BD TV"" graphic is cool, too.  It leads right into Barry's rendition of Nowhere Man.  While the television special and concert sequences here help the story of the boys popularity move along, this version of Nowhere Man is unnecessarily slowed.  It is kind of an odd moment, but Barry sounds pretty.

  Soul Jam Barry appears in the Polythene Pam segment.  Again how much did they pay the girl who got to scream and run on stage? This whole concert segment is well done.  If you are telling a story about a band's rise to fame, best show them in concert!  I like She Came In Through The Bathroom Window.  Frampton does his best here. It reminds me of his Comes Alive stuff that everyone thinks is so great. Maybe he is his best in concert so this scene fits him.  He looks like he is having fun and I even sing along.  Without dialogue, they use these newspaper like graphics during the concert to relay the story. It's a nice detail, but it could have been done better. At one point the movie is squished into one little newspaper block, and it's kind of annoying.  And Robin still has that guitar. It's frightening.

  And I begrudgingly come to Mean Mr. Mustard.  This is a totally poor rendition and I wish they had used a better song to develop the sequence.  Mustard is told by the Future Villian Band to steal Sgt Pepper's instruments from the Heartland museum.  He takes over the town, turning it into some very trashy looking stuff. It says an arcade, but again there are some dicey movements in the dancing not meant for kids. Why are you putting something dicey in a kiddie storyline? Mr. Kite is tied up at one point, so the film loses narration for the next three songs.  The narration serves a purpose sometimes but it also is a bit of ""How does Mr. Kite know?!"" kind of thing. Like when Captain Kirk could make entries to his Captain's Log while imprisoned back in time on an alien planet. Go fig. At least there is some story developing. The next three sequences are perhaps the best here. She's Leaving Home presents Strawberry upset with what's happening in Heartland so she leaves town to find the Band.  The singing in this one is pretty cool, and the action on screen is exactly what's being said in the lyrics.

  Oh yes! Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds!  The female rendition of this one is great, even if the premise is implausible.  Strawberry gets off the bus in the big city, spots the Big D billboard and imagines the whole song.  It sounds really hokey but it is also to me a very ingenious way to get the song onscreen.  Besides, zooming in and watching the dirty dancing going on in this one is hysterical!  Strawberry goes to the studio, where Robin is singing Oh Darling. Again he is singing, and very well, and yes this is a musical, but there is a reason and a place onscreen where the song is coming from.  The subtleties in this sequence are great. From the almost shot of Lucy's boob, to Robin getting his hair yanked when he forgets to take off his headphones.

  And now the film really goes to $%^&. George Burns' narration inexplicably returns to tell us the boys are stealing Mustard's van and going to save Heartland by rescuing the instruments from The Future Villian Band's vile agents!  However, There is some cool interplay between Barry and Maurice and Mustard's computerettes. You know, watching this without sound would be an interesting experiment.

  Maxwell Silver Hammer  is the first singing villian given to us in Steve Martin attempting to sing.  The choreography is pathetic at points and the fight scenes (if you can call them that) are a joke.  At least Because brings us Alice Cooper's unique version, even if the whole FVB thing is stupid.  The boys crawling into Cooper's lair is really funny though, and again, Maurice steals the show while Billy ends up unconscious two songs in a row.  The way they freeze frame the endings of these songs is really funny, too.

  Strawberry Fields Forever  slows things down very stupidly.  Farina's title song isn't bad, but she's got to sing Billy Shears back to health? Okay.  It's even more hokey fun when we see how Billy is dreaming of Strawberry in all the spots where Lucy was on his kinky ride to fame. However, Billy imagines Strawberry in the `Lucy in The Sky With Diamonds' segment, even though the Lucy segment was a figment of Strawberry's imagination!
  Yes I bet you are totally confused, so am I.  Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite tries to get the film back on track with Paul Nicholas' Dougie planning a benefit to save Heartland.  This is an incredibly stupid looking scene, with circus people and horses on roller skates.  Just close your eyes and listen to Maurice sing his one lead.

  You Never Give Me Your Money is the one bright spot since the film turned into this whole Save Heartland joke. There is actually some sort of character development and sequence in the song.  First they hated each other and now Lucy and Dougie have combined their love of money. This musical symbolism is very well done, almost like a real old time musical.
 Not that this is really a bad bad, but did anyone else notice the raunch factor in this one?  What kind of choreography is this? 'Oh let's run around the wax statue of the dead Sgt Pepper! Yeah! And Lucy, be sure and show you're underwear!'  The singing and the song itself are catchy, but the bumping and grinding and rolling on the money are a bit too much for the kiddies.

  Earth, Wind, and Fire are billed as themselves here, performing Got To Get You Into My Life for Heartland's Benefit.  They put on an expert show, but naturally they have to cut to the boys singing and clapping in the audience.  It might be the quintessential sum up of how much the brothers hated making this movie.  The looks on their faces are so God We don't want to be here!
  And no wonder with such classics as When I'm 64.  Mustard kidnaps Strawberry and they ruin this great song.  Burns' narration is so far gone, you want to pull the film back and rip him away from his little off camera microphone.  I guess it depends on your mood, but most of the time I find the boys jumping in their Heartland Hot Air Balloon and magically changing into their aviator outfits totally stupid. I mean the way they look is just...cheese.

  And alas we  meet the Future Villian Band for Come Together. Aerosmith's rendition is awesome, even if the idea of them turning  Strawberry into `a mindless groupie' is really dumb.  Besides she already is one! Again we get another hokey fight scene, but upon my first viewing, this was the one moment in the film I held my breath over.  It looks really cool when Strawberry plummets to her death!

  Golden Slumbers and Carry That Wait relay the funeral scene well in theory.  The songs fit, but Frampton's honest to goodness fake tears kind of kill it.  I did enjoy seeing the bads line up for the funeral.  Did they even know Strawberry? Again my Gibb-biased self must give props to the brothers' pouting close-ups.  The silent interplay between them in this supposedly serious sequence is great. They pine during  The Long and Winding Road while we are treated to another song lessened by Frampton.  He roams Heartland reminiscing about his life with Strawberry -in flashback scenes that we didn't see the action of in the movie prior to this moment, but hey. What really bugs me is in the flashbacks there is a dog.  What happened to the dog?!

  Barry gets his moment to shine with A Day in The Life.  His voice here is the most Beatle-esque and only he could carry this tune the way it should be.  The way he looks in the scenes and the flashbacks of when things were good with the band set the song off.

  Not that a film like this could possibly have a plausible ending, but Get Back  delivers on the out and out hokey of the film.  The Sgt Pepper weather vane mystically turns into the soul of Sgt Pepper-Billy Preston? He stops Billy Shears from killing himself, turns all the baddies into nuns, polishes up the boys' white suits, and brings Strawberry back to life.  Yes that is what it says. I hope I didn't spoil it too much. 80)

  And thank God the Sgt Pepper Reprise signals the end of the film! Who are all those famous people appearing, anyway? I can name like ten of them on sight! That is sad on their part.  Then again, the ladies will enjoy zooming in on the brothers' white suits. Trust me.
 I should also give some details about the movie itself. About how the Bee Gees didn't want to star with Peter Frampton in this horrible musical of Beatles tunes and that the bad box office sales ruined the RSO organization. However, all of this and that can't quite be explained until you actually see the movie. So go get the dvd! Um, I said now.",1229299200,3,12565,4.464993394980185

The movie's feature is the music, and if watched in a slightly altered state, it's a blast. I personally have avoided this movie for a long time, based on critics' reviews. However, I love the Beatles music too much and I was curious about the Bee Gees Role in this flick. I was impressed. I think they were actually playing and singing in their songs! Maurice was especially awesome as Ringo! He was hitting the beats and didn't look silly. The updated renditions were really good for 1978, I was expecting it to be more disco. A lot of the artists came up with very neat arrangements in updated fashion. I think you need a sense of humor to enjoy this movie. There is a serious side to this movie that craps on the record industry. The segment where they get drugged by the big chiefs at BD Records and sign a Contract under the influence has probably happened more times than we would want to know. If it's true that careers were ruined by this movie, I think this is a shame. It looks like it was all in fun with no big agenda other than a grand tribute to the late 60's Beatles. All the songs have a little story line to them and someone needed to interpret them in a visual way. This is as good as any, because the Beatles never did after MMT.

What I love about it, is the way it captures the pop culture scene of the late 70s. With the idolatry of artists like Elvis, the Beatles, Led Zeppelin... I think the late 70s really taught us to enjoy a whole type of music.  Incorporating the Bee Gees, Frampton, Aerosmith, Earth Wind & Fire into one movie breaks down the barriers of music.

The only speaking part in this film goes to the wonderfully entertaining George Burns. Giving Robin Gibb a speaking part probably would have ruined the movie, but the covers are beautiful. Aerosmith 'Come Together' and EW&F 'Got To Get You Into My Life' remain radio hits, and the reason I wanted to see the movie.

In Summary, the little town of Heartland is guided by its Mayor (George Burns) and Sgt. Pepper's band.  When the original band retires due to the death of its leader, the baton (or, I should say, horn) is passed down to the Sgt.'s young grandson, Billy Shears and his 3 friends - the Henderson brothers.  They are given an opportunity of a lifetime but, when they leave the town, the evil Mr. Mustard takes over for his boss, FVB.

I had told my 15 year old daughter about it and since she's a big fan of the Beatles, she was interested in seeing it as well.

When I received the dvd, I sort of cringed at how cheesy the movie was. Peter Frampton and Barry Gibb looked like the hotties I remembered from when I was 14, but the movie as a whole is pretty campy. Before viewing the movie, I was concerned about my daughter watching it, as I had remembered a scene where the band is all getting drunk and stoned, but compared to what the kids watch nowadays, or see on MySpace, it's pretty tame. Not surprisingly, though, my 15 year old daughter loved it. She plays it all the time and has her friends over to watch. She asked me who sings ""Come Together"" and I told her it was Steven Tyler and the band Aerosmith. She thinks he's hot! I broke the news to her that he's 30 years older now. She still loves the movie.

I had purchased the soundtrack as well. This movie and album were my first exposure to many Beatle songs that I never heard as a kid. It made me want to go out there and hear the original songs.

To cite just one example:  the town of Heartland is in ruins, and ""Strawberry Fields"" (the girlfriend of the Frampton character, Billy Shears) decides to take the bus out to L.A. to track down the band and attempt to set things right.  To dramatize her departure, we hear the song ""She's Leaving Home"", complete with her parents reading the note and crying ""Daddy, our baby's gone!  Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?""  Huh? They would easily have figured out why she took off.  But the song is about a runaway, not about this character or her intentions.  You see why even a child would find this incredibly dumb?

But there is one thing, and only one thing, that makes this movie the least bit bearable, and that's the music of the Beatles.  Much has been made of the fact that the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton are nowhere near as talented as John, Paul, George and Ringo, but when they sing ""A Little Help From My Friends"", or ""Oh! Darling"" or ""A Day in the Life"", their harmonies are undeniably beautiful.  All three Brothers Gibb, plus Frampton, were in fact vocally capable of covering such great songs, and they did their best job at it.

And, for better or worse, this film was my first exposure to many late-sixties Beatles songs, especially every song that first appeared on the ""Abbey Road"" LP.  It was this movie that led me to discover a copy of Abbey Road right there in my big sister's record collection, and I've loved that album ever since.  So I suppose I should thank Robert Stigwood, Frampton and the Bee Gees for that, if nothing else.

Yes, Frankie Howerd's version of ""When I'm 64"" is pretty awful...among some other actors' attempts at singing, or talk-singing in Alice Cooper's silly Vincent Price imitation on ""Because""...but the beauty of DVD technology is you can skip these numbers with the mere press of a button.",1149552000,4,1976,4.592592592592593

I agree with one review that mentioned how it takes you back to a time when things were so much more simple. Don't get this movie if you are one of those that likes to rip every single aspect of a movie apart.

The plot is simple, a small town band hits it big in the music world and then tragedy strikes. Sounds like an episode of ""Behind The Music"" doesn't it? The only person who speaks in the movie is George Burns, and that's only to narrate. The rest is all told thru Beatles songs. What makes this so bad is that the storyline was written to tie together songs that have nothing to do with one another. This whole thing is just bad, not a good bad, just a bad bad, it's horrible, yet I watched the whole thing, can't say I'd do it again though. The best part of the movie is the final song in which the cast is joined by various music celebrities of the day. It's cool to pick them all out and see who's among the crowd (much like the famous Beatles album cover!).

 If you have nothing else to do or are in need of a good sleep, check out this movie. It does sort of remind me of ""Roadie"" and ""KISS Meets The Phantom Of The Park"", but sadly both of those are better movies and that ain't saying much!",1146268800,2,1145,4.107142857142857

Once the movie hit the theater, we were so excited as we watched the movie and singing all those great songs. This movie was OUTSTANDING and still entertaining to this day. I recently let my kids (Boy 10, Girl 7) watch it and they loved it. My son kept saying ""There is great music in this movie"". This is simply a must have for anyone who appreciates good movies and music from the 70's.

I still get excited about the ending. If you never seen it, I would not spoil it for you, but it ends up happy. The fact that no one talks in this movie, everyone sings, is PURE GENIUS.

I have seen this movie about 25 times in my life and I must say it is on my top 10 list along with such classics as ""It's a Wonderful Life"", Grease, FM, Forest Gump, Casablanca ect.",1140480000,2,907,4.089887640449438

But it's such a slice of 70's era culture that its suckiness is counterbalanced by the inherent camp value. When I saw this on cable recently, I remember thinking to myself, ""Good God, what were they thinking?"" But let's face it, people; what were ANY of us thinking? It was the 70's. Big hair was actually cool! And no one had bigger hair than Barry Gibb.

This is one of those camp classics that's so bad it's good. It's the kind of film you watch with friends when you could all use a good laugh. Although I have other movies on my wish list that I'll buy first, I'll probably end up with a copy of this one for three distinct reasons. First, it's worth it just to hear George Burns sing ""Fixing A Hole"". Second, there are villians, and their name is Aerosmith!! (Go figure.) And lastly, it's a textbook example of Deus Ex Machina (god from the machine). For those not familiar with the term, Deus Ex Machina is an ancient theatrical device whereby an actor portraying the role of a god would suddenly appear at the end of a play and magically make everything all better. It was basically an easy out for writers who had written themselves into a corner. And when the Sgt. Pepper weathervane turns into Billy Preston, he magically zaps everthing ""back to where you once belonged"". It's the most literal example of Deus Ex Machina I've ever seen (or want to).

So if you're old enough to remember our culture in all its hairy, glitzy 1970's glam glory, buy yourself a copy and take a totally groovy acid trip down memory lane. It'll make you glad we got over all that stuff!",1140480000,,1746,4.43613707165109
213568,3,6300181375,"Lack of speaking parts notwithstanding, the reason I love this movie is because of the sheer fantasy of it as well as the fact that the Bee Gees were really cute.  I remember seeing this film 3 times back in the theater, why?  Because I was a HUGE Bee Gees fan and just HAD to see them on the big screen.  I would have loved it had they spoken, but alas, it was not to be. Still, seeing them and hearing them sing was something to get the heart beating in time with the music.  I loved the soundtrack as well and thought that, since it was a remake with more cleaner sounding technology, it actually improved the Beatle's version (this by no means says that they took away something from the songs.  If I remember correctly, George Martin wanted to be sure the songs stayed true to the original Beatle's version, so not much was toyed around with.  It was simply a more cleaner recording of the songs.) The bass was cleaner, the drums more fuller (less tinny) and the guitars were also fuller and more rounded in sound.  Also, and I'm surprised no one has spoken of this as far as I've read in these reviews, but Maurice Gibb was hilarious in this film!!!  I only wish the Bee Gees had done some comedy on the side as comedy was truly their second calling. (Does anyone remember their fan club recording of 'The Rescue of Bonny Prince Wally'?  I wish to GOD I had kept that little record, but I lost it somewhere and have no idea where it's at. <sniff, sniff>) The waggling of the eyebrows during ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"" was one of Maurice Gibb's all time wonderful moves, and I'll never forget it. Also, his being drunk during the contract signing.  I was rolling!!  So, for a teen age gal who loved the Bee Gees and had posters of them all over her wall, seeing them in a movie was worth the lack of dialogue.  I just wish they had done more.

213572,4,6300181375,"I have never heard of this film until one friend mentioned it to me by accident, she always said she loved the Sgt Pepper album, so when I gave her a copy of the Beatles album as a present, I was surprised when she told me that she referred to the Sgt Pepper with Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees.

Last week I was in a disco/movie store and found the movie by accident, the cover is odd enough but I decided to buy it. Even though I dare not to say it is a good movie, it has a lot of moments that I personally enjoyed being a Beatles fan since my childhood.

The movie is narrated by Mr. Kite (George Burns) and tells the story of the Sgt Pepper Lonely Hearts Club Band during war times until the death of the sergeant. A new generation comes, the Sgt's grandson Billy Shears (Frampton) and his three childhood friends, the Hendersons (The Bee Gees) decide to continue with the sergeant's legacy and they are discovered by a label who wants to produce their albums and profit with their image. Everything seems to be going well (lots of sequences parodying the business negotiations and parties there) until mean Mr. Mustard decides to steal the magical instruments from the original Sgt Pepper's band (does Yellow Submarine ring a bell?) leaving the town of Heartland helpless. It is our heroes' duty to go and recover the instrument s from Mr. Mustard and his evil robot assistants, who work for a secret organization, know as F.V.B.

The journey is narrated as well with Beatle songs as they encounter the villains: Dr Maxwell (Steve Martin), Father Son (Alice Cooper in a very bizarre character) and finally the F.V.B. headquarters. These situations lead to many funny sequences that use the songs written by Lennon/McCartney in hilarious ways until the final scene where Frampton fights versus Steven Tyler to save Heartland (priceless!) Look for Billy Preston's version of Get Back, dressed as Sgt Pepper and using his magical powers to fix all problems of the people at Heartland.

Not much to expect from a movie like this but classical songs in versions sung by Frampton and the Bee Gees. The final sequence is also surprising as a lot of guests show up at Heartland without any explanation just to sing and wave to the camera (Jack Bruce, Robert Palmer, Donovan, Jose Feliciano, Del Shannon, Tina Turner, Johny Winter and more)

A very campy musical film with lots of guests and alternative versions of the Beatles' classic songs. The digital transfer looks pretty good and the sound quality is also quite remarkable (English 5.1 is available), the movie has only the trailers as extra materials and is subtitled in English, French and Spanish. Definitely a keeper!",1133740800,4,2676,4.7094017094017095
213573,4,6300181375,"I recently saw this movie for the first time in years and I have to say that I still enjoyed watching it as much as I did last time. In a recent music magazine,this movie was rated as the worst rock movie of all time. It's not that bad of a movie,is it? What exactly was to blame for the bad reviews? Perhaps it was the era it came out in. In 1978,the disco music of the Bee Gees was slowly dying,Peter Frampton's best years were now behind,and Beatle fans were still hoping for that reunion. Was this movie a tribute or perhaps an insult to the fab four? Did this movie hurt the careers of Frampton and The Bee Gees? Perhaps it was the cast that ruined it? Could not be! This movie cast includes 3 artists currently in the Rock n Rock hall of fame (Bee Gees,Aerosmith,and Earth,Wind and fire) as well as 3 artists who should be in it in the years to come (Peter Frampton,Alice Cooper,and Billy Preston). Non music cast members included a legend (George Burns),a well-respected actor of the time (Donald Pleasance),and a well-respected actor of today (Steve martin). Would the movie been a success had it came out today instead? What if Justin Timberlake was Billy Shears and Lindsey Lohan was Strawberry Fields? What if Destiny's Child sang ""Lucy in the sky with diamonds"" and Usher sang ""get back""? What if Mike Myers was Dr Maxwell? Hmmmmm. One seems to forget that this might have been the movie that opened up the doors for all those rocks tales currently arousing audiences in broadway theaters. Today,theater audiences are enjoying plays containing the music of such artists as Abba,Billy Joel,The Four seasons,The Beach Boys,and Queen,to name a few.

I appreciate sarcasm and I respect other peoples opinions, I freely admit to liking crappy films other people hate, but no one, under any circumstances for any reason  should ever recommend this film, not to anyone for any reason, this is so bad it's bad.

There is not plot so I can't give it away, what was done here, is that every band from every stripe, Hard Rock (Aerosmith/Alice Cooper) R and B (Earth Wind and Fire) Old People (George Burns) and the biggest selling groups of the day (by the time the film came out Frampton's sales were sucking canal water) The Bee Gees and Peter Frampton were shanghaied into putting together the single greatest musical stink bomb ever.

In one of the many, many mind boggling scenes of indescribable musical mayhem, Frampton is reduced to singing to a dead girl ""Carry that weight"" Frampton is a guitarist, not a singer, sure he sang but that was not his forte.

213585,3,6300181375,"Of course, this won't work as a movie. Since this is a bunch of Beatles songs thrown together, this is supposed to be a musical. But stretched into a movie, it doesn't work on that level either. It would be very hard to make a story out of a group of songs that had nothing to do one with the other when they were first composed.

The origin of the idea was an off-Broadway musical from 1974 called ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band on the Road"". I never watched that musical, but I guess it MAY have been a little more tolerable as such.

The truth (going back to the movie) is that the songs don't contribute at all with the progress of the story. On the contrary, it is bring to a complete stop. In most instances, it has to be taken again by the narrator (George Burns) only to be stopped one more time by the next song. There is no dialogue at all.

Many people have pointed that the plot is practically non existant. I don't necesarily agree: there is a plot, somehow. Not a clever one, not an elaborate one, but one, nontheless. The only one that could have been created from a disjointed group of songs. Although the story is simple, even clumsy, (embarrasingly clumsy in some points) I can't help but imagine that trying to create something under the circumstances was no easy task.

But it wasn't worthy. I mean artistically. It's obvious that the inspiration behind this mess was money: take the songs of the most popular group in the planet (Beatles), put it togheter with the most succesful group of the moment (Bee Gees) and get ready to collect the money, no matter the quality. (The ""acting"" doesn't even count: it's atrocious, to say the least).

BUT...If you forget about this thing being a movie or a musical, you might enjoy it as it is: a collection of videos of Beatles covers. Just pretend that this was a TV special back in 1979. As a TV special, is a notch above average for that time. (I'm not implying that this way ALL the ""videos"" will work: there are some bits that are beyond any kind of rescue. But you might be able to enjoy a little more of the material included if you look at it differently).

Musically, I know that for people that hate covers, specially Beatles covers, there's no value there either. But if we are guided by the charts, if it is of value for some, we have that in the Billboard charts, COME TOGETHER by AEROSMITH was, N 23, OH DARLING by ROBIN GIBB was N 15, and GOT TO GET YOU INTO MY LIFE by EARTH, WIND AND FIRE was N 9, all of them included in this movie.

As for me, there are some high points: The rendition of OH DARLING in a soulful, Al Green style, is very good. GOT TO GET YOU INTO MY LIFE was created to be played the way EW&F does, also in a soul-funky style, that no doubt Paul McCartney had in mind when he created it. A DAY IN THE LIFE by the BEE GEES is beautifuly rendered, although I agree that it turns a semi-progressive original into a kind of a ballad-cover. Nontheless, I think the choral bridge, before the last verse, is better here that in the original. A faithful rendition of BEING FOR THE BENEFIT OF MR. KITE, but with a big orchestra, is also very good. And I can't help but like COME TOGETHER by Aerosmith better than the original.

The sound of the songs in general is very good, due to the participation of George Martin, the original Beatles producer and a master of sound in his own right.

A high point for this collection is the mix in Dolby Digital and DTS. The 5.1 mix puts the main instruments in the 2 front channels, leaving the center free to hear the voices with great clearity. (Some sorround is added for the ambiance, not the songs).

For nostalgic reasons or as a curiosity, I think this movie is worth it. Give it a try: the ""worst"" thing that can happen is that you feel the urge to run and hear the original songs. BUT REMEMBER: pretend that it was a TV special, nothing more.",1126224000,4,3887,4.305061559507524
213586,2,6300181375,"Where to begin?

It's been, ahem, over 25 years since I saw SPLHCB in the theatre.  I've been feeling nostalgic lately and saw it again on video.

The idea to knit a story out of disjointed songs was pretty ambitious and creative.  Had the writer used the entire Beatles catalog, he may have been able to pound out a script that made sense. It still wouldn't have made sense to have the BeeGees star in it.  It's akin to the Eagles making a cover album of Saturday Night Fever.

Anyway, the concept to knit a plot from songs was not altogether a bad one, as is evidenced by ""Mama Mia"" (ABBA) and ""Moving Out"" (Billy Joel), two off-Broadway shows that steal Sgt. Pepper's premise, with much better success. But using a literal interpretation of the Beatles lyrics boxed them in.  The result was a disjointed, bizarre stream of consciousness.  Immensely watchable thanks to the presence of many beautiful people, but bizarre nonetheless.

On a side note, I would have loved to have seen some outtakes.  Despite the trauma to their collective careers and their attempts to distance themselves from Sgt. Pepper, the Gibbs are quite witty a la Monty Python when left to their own devices.  Their outtakes were undoubtably more clever, and better acted, than the movie itself.",1126224000,5,1270,4.7534246575342465

213588,3,6300181375,"... as when I'm watching this movie.  Obviously, the movie is bad.  There's no question there.  But I can't hate something that gives me the entertainment that this movie produces.  Granted, it's not SUPPOSED to make me laugh at the points when it does, but that's not the point.  Buy this movie, and you'll laugh, when not gouging your eyes out.

The plot is pretty much non-existant.  When it does peek through, the songs used to further it barely have anything to do with it.  For example, one of the high points of the movie is at the end, when a golden Billy Preston, playing a weathervane come to life, is singing ""Get Back"" (hit the mute button and you can convince yourself it's actually ""Ease on Down the Road"" that he's singing), talking about Jojo and Loretta.  Who are they?  There IS no Loretta!  He's singing at the character dubbed Strawberry Fields, should we believe that SHE is Loretta?  If they were going to use that song, at least name characters appropriately!  Then again, what else can you expect from a movie that brings people back to life and employs actresses to wear incredibly tight leather and beat the back of Mean Mr. Mustard, suggesting dominatrix far more than computerized robot.

There ARE a few prime moments however, including the above-mentioned Billy Preston highlight.  Robin Gibb warbling through ""Oh Darling""?  Probably the best cover in the movie, though you may have to be able to appreciate Robin's style to realize it.  Barry Gibb attempting to look cool and strut Stayin' Alive style while posing as a pallbearer?  Equally prime.  And who can forget the song and dance number to ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer""?

All and all, I recommend this movie for an all around good time.  Just keep the sharp objects away and be sure you're not still fast forwarding when Alice Cooper falls into the lemon meringue pie.",1120521600,7,1852,4.74294670846395

Great fun scenes include the battle between Billy Shears (Frampton) and the singer of the Future Villain Band (Aerosmith's Steven Tyler), and the scene where the boys from squeaky-clean Heartland arrive in ""Hollywood"" (?) and are immersed in ""real world"" sleaze and decadence, to the backing of a lenghty, jazzed up ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)."" Someone who's not a Beatles fan would likely be bored by the film, but since I love these songs, I was entertained by these renditions, wrongheaded as most of them may be (Earth Wind and Fire and Aerosmith excepted--I believe they're the only two acts that played their own arrangements).",1119916800,3,980,4.703488372093023
213590,1,6300181375,"On Thanksgiving Day when people count their blessings, I think about one thing I will always be greatful for:  it took me 25 years to rent this movie because I'd been hearing how bad it was.  Well, if you have never seen this, Sgt. Pepper is everything you've heard, only worse.  I like Peter Frampton to some respectable degree, but this movie almost made me sell anything I  ever owned by him.  Then I remembered that everyone makes mistakes.  Nobody has made more mistakes in their lives, however, than Robert Stigwood and the B00-Gees.  As if either party hadn't already peddled enough trivially trendy crapola on us, they had to insult us all with this de-Beatle-ization of the Beatles.

Come on guys, this isn't even a campy old musical.  It only wishes it were that good.  Sgt. Pepper?  Hell, they threw in songs from Abbey Road and also named Sandy Farina's horrible character after a song from Tragical History Tour(the worst Beatles album ever.).  Paul Nicholas (remember ""Heaving""-er-I mean ""Heaven on the 7th Floor?"") singing ""You Never Give Me Your Money?"" George burns ""singing"" ""Fixing a Hole?""  This entire movie needed the kind of fixing that only a bonfire could appropriately solve.

People keep saying the B00-Gees and Pay-tah Frampton were bad actors, but I distinctly remember that they never uttered a line.  Somebody wisely decided that their bad Beatle covers and horrible body and facial gestures were enough torture for the viewers.  Hell, you know what's really awful?  I was three sheets to the wind on that dark raspberry ale with the cute black lab puppy with the bird in its mouth, and the movie still sucked.  At least Moulin Rouge, which I also hate, made me laugh.  In fact the only enjoyment I truly got out of the movie was Earth Wind and Fire and the eject button.  If you like the Beatles DO NOT buy this, but rent it if you must.  Just make sure to keep some adult beverage handy because you're going to need it!",1117324800,6,1952,4.682352941176471

The music and performances can still lift my soul as if it were only yesterday.  The audience can easily feel the love and friendship between the characters. If you come away from the movie without having your heart strings tugged on, then I think you should follow the advice of ""...get back to where you once belonged..."" and remember what it was like to be young.

Beatles' purists hate this film.  Why?  One, the Beatles do not perform in any of the songs.  Two, the Beatles do not appear in any of the scenes. And three, this film is not surreal enough for Beatles' films/music videos enthusiasts.  Actually, I remember being shocked after seeing the film in 1978 when my sister told me that all of the songs were remakes of Beatles' music. To my generation, the Beatles were a bit frightful.  Of course we enjoyed their music, but at the time the Beatles were in their hippie phase, and hippies were scary to us.  For example, you might go to the supermarket with your mommy and there would be a group of people who hadn't bathed all week, with bad breath and long hair, flashing you the peace sign.  And then you would see similar people on TV yelling, screaming, and shaking their fists.  It was a scary time to grow up in.  Vietnam. Nixon. The oil crisis.  The nation felt like it was falling apart.  I think that's why there was such a rejection of this failed era, a backlash of normalcy in the 80s, by my generation.  The only reason anything in that era is embraced now is because young people have no idea how terrible that time was.

This film is one of the better things to come out of that time.",1113955200,15,1769,4.2960725075528705

But I like the way it has a complete fantasy feeling and is not realistic at all. We can't make movies like this anymore. Good music too (for Rock n'roll which almost always was loud and obnoxious though). I think the WW1 army band instrumental rendition of ""We're Sgt.

Pepper's band (Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees) to life in a seducing dance and song.  This features sight gag moments of the late Maurice Gibb as he eyes the girls during the song.  Of course, Strawberry is hallucinating the whole time.

All the performances were great and while others over look this film, I don't!  I am happy to have this in my DVD collection with it's 2.35:1 Widescreen and 5.1 Surround sound!  Rock on!!!!",1110326400,4,835,4.756944444444445

The performances of the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton are silly but this isn't Shakespeare , it is a fantasy fable loosely strung together by some brilliant music. If you think of it as one long music video you will not be disappointed and kids always love this movie.

...The strong points...The music!!..The Bee Gees interpretations especially are very strong especially Barry Gibbs vocals on ""A Day In The Life""....this is a wonderful version of this song. While this version is not as haunting as John Lennon's I do feel it gives the compsition the respect it deserves. The openong scens of the fil showing the history of the fictional Sgt Pepper combo was so bright and vivid it reminded me of an old Hollywood musical and George Burns narration is top notch. The first musical number with The bee Gees and PeterFrampton is high energy and they really look like a band. They take it just seriously enough and they all look great. ...Sandy Farina as Strawberry Fields has an excellent voice and girl next door sexiness. Earth Wind and Fire are amazing in their cameo and Aerosmith's Come Together is raunchy and amazing..it shows why this band is still so relevant today. they are America's Rolling Stones.

..The low points...Yes there are quite a few but I will let viewers decide on their own and with DVD technology they can be skipped quite easily....

my advice...see this with a light attitude and just enjoy the music and the simple story....

....It is not as much of a disaster as critics say...

The critics loved Lost In Translation and that is the biggest piece of crap I have ever seen....It is 2 hours of my life I wish I had back..

This movie really falls under the category, To each his own, but I really love watching this movie. So many reviews include synopses so I won't bother, but touch on some of my favorite spots. Quite a few mentioned Aerosmith's Come Together, but I was blown over by Diane Steinberg and Stargard doing Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. It comes when Sandy gets off the bus to look for her boyfriend, and looks up at a billboard of the girl group, Stargard. Suddenly, the figures come to life, first fully clothed, then slowly peeling off some of their clothing. It's a very sexy interpretation, and makes Strawberry wonder what her guy's been up to. I was touched by Sandy Farina's performance in She's Leaving Home. She pantomines the lyrics of the song, helped by Mean Mr. Mustard's robots whose voices add a certain weird charm to the background. I never cared much for The Long and Winding Road until I watched the video of Peter Frampton dealing with the death of Strawberry Fields, and gave me a whole new appreciation for the haunting composition. I got a kick out of watching Burns doing Fixing a Hole with his young audience who joined in the action and tugged at my heart. And I loved watching Henry the Horse dancing the waltz in Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite. It may be that the Beatles had nothing to do with, any more than they had much to do with Yellow Submarine, but the performers sing their songs with much the same spirit and feeling, and I liked the silly videos, such as watching Dougie Shears and Lucy doing You Never Give Me Your Money. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because some of the videos are a bit silly and predictable, but on the whole, I feel the movie is a fun way for me to both watch and listen to the songs from the ground-breaking album, and I have to feel sorry for those who don't like it.",1090713600,10,1987,4.287234042553192
213596,2,6300181375,"The ficticious place called ""Heartland"" finds all kinds of musicians coming together in orange, pink, red and purple satin. ""Sgt. Pepper"" unites all kinds of Beatle tunes into one large ball of cheese. How many careers were ruined by this film? Is it easy to spot that only a handful of people here actually had (any) acting experience out of the hundreds of people in this film? Outside of some brief narration by George Burns, it's ALL song and dance. There's a few good performances here (Aerosmith's ""Come Together"", Robin Gibb's ""Oh Darling"", Earth Wind & Fire's ""Got To Get You Into My Life"", and the Bee Gees' ""Golden Slumber"")... and one hilarious - Steve Martin singing ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" in the green tiled room... but most of this is tedious to get through. THE HEROES: Peter Frampton plays the starring role of Billy Shears (dig those white overalls with ""Billy"" printed on them). Barry, Robin and Maurice (RIP) Gibb play the roles of the Henderson brothers who help Shears find the stolen instruments. George Burns plays the role of narrator and Mister Kite. Donald Pleasance (from ""Halloween"" fame) as BD Hoffler. THE VILLAINS: Alice Cooper as the mean Marvin Sunk (why was his version of ""Sun King"" omitted on the ""Sgt. Pepper"" movie soundtrack?). Aerosmith as the infamous (FVB) Future Villain Band. And a wonderful performance by Steve Martin as the evil Dr. Maxwell Edison. In the stands for the Grand Finale, you'll spot numerous ""guests"" from 1970's world of music... including Tina Turner, Robert Palmer, Hank Williams Jr, Seals & Croft, Sha Na Na, Nils Lofgren, Heart, Leif Garret, Jose Feliciano, Johnny Winter, Wolfman Jack, etc. Outside of the trailer and a language selection, this DVD has no extras. For those of us that grew up in the 1970's, it would have been nice to see some interviews or commentaries with some of the musicians. Thank goodness Billy Preston saved the day at the end of the movie (singing ""Get Back"")... bringing back to life the already deceased Strawberry Fields with a zap of his finger, and then saving Billy Shears from certain suicide and a very sad ending...

213597,1,6300181375,"The Beatles never existed--as far as this film is concerned, anyway. Before watching this movie, you should empty everything you know about the Beatles from your mind. While you're at it, you might as well empty everything else from your mind, because your intelligence may be insulted.
I watched this movie knowing it would be bad, but I was hoping it would be classic bad, cult following bad, Rocky Horror Picture Show bad. I wanted to hear George Burns sing ""Fixin' a Hole"" and Steve Martin deliver a slightly pervy redition of ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer."" I wanted to hear robots perform ""Mean Mr. Mustard"". And I really wanted to see Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees become the Lonely Hearts Club Band.
The movie delivers all of these and more, horrifyingly more. I can't even explain how bad this movie is. Let's just say that it makes Rocky Horror look like Les Miserables. This movie is also pretty racist; I'm white and I was offended by the portrayal of black people in it (Earth, Wind, and Fire, of course, were the exception; the guy who played the weathervane, on the other hand, made me feel like I was at a minstrel show). Sargeant Pepper's not bad in a fun way; it's just bad in a bad way.
I should say that the best performance of the movie is Aerosmith's snaky redition of ""Come Together."" This is coming from someone who is not even an Aerosmith fan. There are a lot of unbelievable moments in the film, but that one was surprising in a good way.",1075852800,15,1462,4.520754716981132

The music is GREAT and the movie is FUN.  For me, it is also nostalgic of the late 70's.  There are really no speaking roles in this movie except for George Burns who narrates.  It is all music.

213599,3,6300181375,"If there was ever a movie that deserved a golden turkey, it was this one. Horribly conceived, garish, acting with the consistency of several small trees and musical numbers so literal that it could have been dreamt up by a high school drama club, ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" is so cheesy that it effectively derailed the RSO Movie organization, who were looking at this as the latest blockbuster following ""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""Grease."" (Not too mention the lucrative best selling soundtracks and cross promotions.)
I am sure that everyone knows the history of this 1978 Technicolor gag fest, so there is no need to bore you with the details. But what needs to be stated is why I bought it almost as soon as It finally made its DVD debut. Beyond mere nostalgia, there is the goofiness of it all. Where else could you see Peter Frampton and Steve Martin square off in a Star Wars battle parody? And the peculiar shtick of allowing only George Burns the only speaking part? (That could be stretched; between Burns, Donald Pleasance and Frankie Howard, they might share a full octave between them, and they ALL sing.)
And speaking of the songs, most are carried off dutifully. Frampton and the Bee Gees were at their peaks; Robin Gibb's ""Oh Darling"" is a standout. The two groups that brought in outside producers, Aerosmith and Earth Wind and Fire, are the ones that fair the best. Aerosmith had Jack Douglas work their version of ""Come Together"" into a perfect rock sleaze concoction and EW&F self produced ""Got To Get You Into My Life"" with their customary flair.
So get this at your own peril. It rates with the same kind of goofy fun that makes me own ""Can't Stop The Music"" and ""Rock and Roll High School.""",1074124800,28,1727,4.665573770491803

213606,4,6300181375,"As expected in reading the reviews, I find that people either loved or hated this movie.  I'd like to look at this movie from two perspectives, first details on the disc itself.
The audio is presented in both DTS & Dolby Digital 5.1 surround.  The video is presented in anamorphic widescreen 2.35:1 on the dual layer disc.  Overall they did a decent job of encoding this title.  The video is clean and crisp and only rarely do artefacts appear.  An example of how `bad' this movie could have been without the job done to clean it up can be seen during the close-up of the spinning weather vane near the end of the movie.  As it `transforms' into Billy Preston, if you slow-mo or pause-step though it, you can see an example of artefacts that were not removed during processing.  (although it is not noticeable by most people since the scene transitions quickly)  Overall, even when zoomed at 2x, the video quality remains good given the age of the content.  Audio is clear and dynamic.  While effort was put into the video quality, no effort was put into the extras.  Just an original trailer (loaded with artefacts) and scene access are provided.
Now on to my opinion of the content.  As you may see by looking at other comments, there is a marked difference of opinion about this title.  I think the first mistake that some people made was in calling it a movie when it really isn't one.  I tend to agree that this is really a time capsule of sorts, giving those who didn't see it when it was released a glimpse into the past.  One of the big problems with the critics of this title was in the music.  Not because the music was bad, but because the music was old Beatles songs.  In many ways some people consider the use of these songs by anyone but the Beatles to be sacrilege.  With an attitude like that I could have told you they were going to hate it before they watched it.  If you are a big Beatles fan and aren't comfortable with people doing remakes of their music, then you may be wise to avoid this title.
On the other hand, I enjoyed it.  It's a fun musical treat that you don't have to think about.  Campy?  Sure.  Steve Martin's bit almost comes off like an old `Saturday Night Live' routine, but you can't help but enjoy it.  The loose storyline doesn't live up to a being considered a plot, but nevertheless one can still feel that this is more than a loose group of songs.  Don't believe the critics that say this title ruined the careers of anyone who worked in it, since that just isn't the case.  A brief look at some of the other acts like Areosmith, Earth, Wind & Fire, Alice Cooper & Steve Martin says that this just isn't the case.  They all did quite well after this title's theatrical release.
Overall this offering tends to fall into the same category as titles like Xanadu, Phantom of Paradise, The Wiz etc.  None of them were box office smashes, but they all have strong and loyal followings.  In the end Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is a title in its own time.  It captures the essence of music in the late 70's and puts it on screen.  This title shouldn't be judged by today's standards since it will never measure up.  Enjoy it for what it was, not for what others felt it should have been.",1067472000,8,3233,4.381512605042017
213607,2,6300181375,"Is that a quote from one of the movie's villains or an inter-office memo from the production team? Though this movie appears to us now as hopelessly dated, ""harmless"" kitsch, it's important to remember that the primary reason for making this film was profit, plain and simple. The producers wanted to cynically cash in on their audience's nostalgia of the Beatles and long-faded hippie ideals.
What results is a bizarre, cartoonish funhouse mirror of those cynical ambitions. Sgt. Pepper and his band can end wars, their instruments can ""make dreams come true"" but they can't help George Burns' Golden Throats-worthy singing or help our heroes' acting ability. They get seduced by dreams of Hollywood fame and really skanky women, while their town is befell by the corrupt Mr. Mustard, who turns ""Heartland"" into a hellish haven with a giant greasy cheesburger and (gasp!) a video game arcade. Then Strawberry Fields comes to the rescue and a benefit (for Mr. Kite!) is held, although that devolves into some more bizarre set pieces, and ends when Miss Fields bites the dust. But wait, then Frampton tries not to come alive, and the original Pep does a reverse Michael Jackson and comes back as a black guy, played by Billy Preston. He sings about ""California grass"" and does some funky dancing, and helps our villains discover Jesus. Then, Pow! a large scale recreation of the Pepper's album cover appears, this time with more C-list celebs. If you thought the original Sgt.

This movie is a loosely strung together series of later Beatles music, and a few inside jokes for the fans, but other than a trip down memory lane, the movie is not worth watching.

--Aerosmith's ""Come Together"" is frankly better than The Beatles' original version; Steven Tyler really nails the sleaziness of the lyrics. Ditto Robin Gibb's ""Oh Darlin'"". Even Barry Gibb's version of ""A Day In The Life"" is right up there with the original.
--Some of the uses of the music are downright clever (""I Want You/She's So Heavy"" for the record company orgy sequence is a really good example of this). The whole introduction sequence is also pretty clever with some fun period arrangements of ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" to sound like tunes of the era.
Cons:
--Pretty much any time Peter Frampton is on the screen. Though the genuine despair he shows in Strawberry's room after the funeral isn't half bad. But his singing...ugh.

Only Robert Stigwood could take the greatest, most important album of the 1960s and turn it into the worst movie of all time.
It was an embarassment to everyone involved. The Bee Gees refused to comment about SGT. PEPPER in interviews during the 1980's and Billy Preston filed a lawsuit to have his name removed from the video box. It wasn't just a bad movie, it killed careers.
When I saw it in the theater with several friends during it's very short-lived general release, I was appalled at the movie's amauterishness. There is no plot, the dialogue would insult the intelligence of a typical 4th grader, and the acting is non-existent. The music is performed in some kind of mind-numbing daze with orchestration straight out of H.R. Puffenstuff.
Towards the end of the film Peter Frampton stands on a roof top contemplating suicide. In the theater two or three people, myself included, began shouting ""Jump! Jump!""

There are a few short seconds while Aerosmith performs ""Come Together"" that are kind of interesting. But all of the rest of the movie should have been torn to shreds, burned, and buried in a pit on the dark side of the moon. It is absolute unadulterated GARBAGE.
I rank it 1 star because that's as low as the rating system goes. In reality it deserves negative 46 stars.",1043971200,14,1455,4.6875

213638,5,6300181375,"I remember, back when the film first premiered, in 1978, seeing this movie for this first time on the big screen! I was in awe of the music, the Bee Gees, Peter Frampton, and the whole film.
I credit this movie for my love and appreciation of The Beatles (being 9- going on 10 at that time, I did not make the connection that these artists were in fact performing the Beatles music.)
I own it on VHS, and it brings back alot of warm memories for me; for example, I remember, as soon as we left the theater, we immediatle went to the music store and bought the 2 record music soundtrack!!
I want this title on DVD; It would be nice to, in addition to the film itself, to have bonus features, such as intervies with the cast; a behind-the-scenes making of the movie; cast and crew bios.
Maybe a feature that shows where certain stars are today (like Paul Nicholas (the nasty Dougie Shears), Sandy Farina (Strawberry Fields) kind of a ""where are they now"").
For those who have not had the pleasure of seeing this film, here's a brief discription:
Sgt. Pepper and his Lonely Hearts Club Band are hailed as being a band that brings joy with their music. Their instruments have the power to bring joy, as make dreams come true.
Sgt. Pepper dies, and leaves the legacy to Billy Shears (Frampton) and his friends Mark, Dave, and Bob Henderson (The Bee Gees) to make a new Lonely Hearts Club Band, and bring joy to the world with their music.
They make it big, almost larger than life. And go to L.A. and become superstars.
Steve Martin, Alice Cooper, Aerosmith, are a few of the celebrity villians who want the musical instruments of the original Lonely Hearts Club Band, so they can take over the world. Their mantra being ""We hate love. We hate Joy. We love money."" And Mean Mr. Mustard(Frankie Howard) loves Strawberry (Sandy Farina), Billy Shears' girlfriend.
Will the instruments be saved? Can the world be saved from the clutches of FVB (Future Villian Band)? Can Billy get to Strawberry in time? You will have to watch to find out ;>",1035676800,13,2032,4.494594594594594
213639,3,6300181375,"This was said to be producer Robert Stigwood's home movie and it sure seems like it. It virtually ruined nearly every musicians career that was in it. It's wildly bright, boisterous, flashy and tacky all at once. Besides the music, (of which, most are pretty good Beatles covers), there is no dialogue, save for the narration by George Burns (who even sings a song - don't ask).
The plot is simply a bunch of the Beatles sixties songs strung together for kind of a story - that's it. Simple and silly with a happy ending. Blah, blah, blah! The majority of the music is sung by the acts with great studio musicians. However, there are some real bad renditions which will either offend or cause one to roll their eyes.

Let me put it this way. The day production began, the Bee Gees reportedly begged to be taken out of the film. Sorry guys. A contract is a contract. They were one of the few survivors.",1032307200,2,901,4.427710843373494

213642,4,6300181375,"To be honest, when this film came out, I turned my nose up at it, thinking it was rediculous for Peter Frampton, and the Bee Gee's to think they could compare to the Beatles. But When I got older, I caught it on T.V. and was very suprised. I think the problem most have with this film, is that it's not really a movie, but more like a video album, or narrated silent movie. I would give it a 5 star rating, but it's only on VHS, in standard format. It needs to be seen in wide screen, cause they had to stretch it to fit the screen, <annoyingly noticable in the begining and end sequences>. I wish it was on widescreen DVD format, cause my VHS version is getting quite worn.
Addendum, now I got my wish it's on DVD
One of the best transfers to 5.1 I have ever heard, they really did it right.  Also was transfred from a 99 percent immaculate print of the movie.  Only in a couple small 2 second sections can you actually see film wear. <noticeable on the George Burns scene right before Mr Kite, and also in the Billy preston seen near the end.  Since I had previously only seen this movie on tv. and standard vhs, I am now discovering things that were chopped out to format it to standard screen.  If you love the movie, you will love the DVD.  Not much for speacial features, only the trailer, but they put the focus on what matters most, the sound and the video.",1024963200,3,1365,4.17490494296578

The plot makes NO sense (a weathervane comes to life in the end and makes everything right. That is how this movie is resolved.)
This is a glaring example of 70's rock excess and commercialization undermining all that is good about rock in the first place.  This movie is perhaps the greatest reason we should all be thankful for, if not be a big fan of, punk.",1023840000,3,573,4.71
213661,4,6300181375,"The first time I had seen this film was the summer of 1978. I was 7 years old, really into the music of The Beatles and had to see this movie. This film was not a tribute to The Beatles, nor did the actual members of the group have anything to do with the movie. It was a fantasy film about the fictitious characters that The Beatles used in their songs off the ""Sgt. Pepper"" and ""Abbey Road"" albums.
The story takes place in the make-believe town of Heartland where we are introduced to the original Sgt. Pepper and his Lonely Hearts Club Band. Twenty years after Sgt. Pepper dies, his grandson Billy Shears (Peter Frampton) decides to form a new Lonely Hearts Club Band with his friends, the Henderson Brothers (The Bee Gees). The film continues with the success of the Lonely Hearts Club Band, the problems the citizens are having in Heartland with Mean Mr. Mustard (Frankie Howard) taking over the town and the Lonely Hearts Club Band helping Strawberry Fields (Sandy Farina) recover Sgt. Pepper's instruments that Mean Mr. Mustard stole. They encounter many obstacles and hardships, but in the end, evil is overcome and everyone is happy.
This film was not well received when it was released in 1978. Actually, everyone, including the critics and the public, hated the movie. The film was produced by Robert Stigwood (of 'Grease' and 'Saturday Night Fever' fame) and executive produced by Dee Anthony. Stigwood wanted to make his name associated with modern day musicals and had sunk 12 million dollars into ""Sgt. Pepper."" He approached the project with a lot of enthusiasm and publicity. When it was released, it was a big let down in the eyes of the critics and adults (who were teenagers when the original ""Sgt. Pepper"" was released) who went to see the movie. According to Paul Nelson of 'Rolling Stone' magazine (October 5, 1978) ""...Stigwood and Anthony not only produced one of the worst movies ever made, but also managed to trash whatever rock and roll reputations such seventies artists as Peter Frampton and The Bee Gees..."" Two reasons for the dislike of the film is the fact that no one spoke during the duration of the film (except for the narration done by the late George Burns who played Mr. Kite) and old Beatle songs were redone by popular seventies artists. The run of the film in some cities was ""...so short...that those who were lucky enough to blink may have missed it,"" according to 'Rolling Stone' magazine (October 5, 1978). I have never read a review on this movie from a critic who actually liked it. Only myself, my friends and my parents seemed to like this movie.
While watching this movie and reading so many bad reviews about it, I still liked it and thought it was done creatively. Musicals usually have dialogue with the songs to help move the plot along. In this musical, the only spoken words are the late George Burns' narration of the storyline. The Beatles' songs and the plot are intertwined and that's what tells and moves the story along. The songs communicate to the audience whether a character was good (""Strawberry Fields Forever"") or bad (""Mean Mr. Mustard""), it emphasizes what is happening in the scene (""She's Leaving Home""), how a person feels for another one (""I Want You, She's So Heavy""). The songs also show feelings of cheerfulness (""Good Morning, Good Morning"") and sadness (""Golden Slumbers"" and ""Carry That Weight""). What a way of putting a movie together by telling a story through musical dialogue! I don't agree with the statement made by 'Rolling Stone' magazine that ""...Sgt. Pepper is better on vinyl than it was on film."" I thought that for remaking some of the Beatles' classic songs, these artists did a good job. Some that I find particularly good are Aerosmith's ""Come Together"" and Earth, Wind and Fire's ""Got To Get You Into My Life."" The finale tops off the film with the entire cast and many other superstars such as Tina Turner, Bonnie Raitt, and Robert Palmer singing the reprise of ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.""",1019952000,124,4006,4.757183908045977

Steve Martin makes a hilarious screen debut playing ""Maxwell"" from the ""Abbey Road"" track ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"".  Earth, Wind and Fire, Aerosmith, The Bee Gees and Peter Frampton are watchable in this assault on the senses that is now a camp classic.

SPLHCB is probably one of the greatest kid's movies (especially girls) ever made. Really bad bad guys, really good (and cute) good guys. The big problem with this movie was that it was never promoted as a kids movie, so never reached its perfect audience. As an added bonus for you grownups out there, the Beatles songs are re-done by the Bee Gees in versions arranged and produced by George Martin....

Even my mother, who bought the album for me way back when, didn't remember it. That is, until my obsession with proving its existence brought me to buying both the VHS and CD. This movie is pure camp. I view it as a spoof on other musicals, melodrama, and the overabundance of ""good versus evil"" provided by the contemporary Star Wars (the battle between Billy Shears and Maxwell Edison is simply lovely). As a bonus, the Bee Gees, Peter Frampton, Sandy Farina, and Frankie Howerd all do renditions of classic Beatles' tunes which are to be judged separately from the originals. No one will ever sing ""Lucy"" like the Beatles - but in the context of the movie, Diane Sternberg does an exceptional job that is independent of the classic. Aerosmith's ""Come Together"" actually can hold its own with the original. Personally, I think the movie is worth watching simply for George Burns' softshoe version of ""Fixin' a Hole"" - well, that and seeing Peter Frampton in that oh-so-sexy silver disco suit.

I bought my first copy on Beta in 1986....and just got another copy on VHS a few years back.  I can't get enough of this movie.  And when life gets a little hectic and tough....just pop Sgt.

You can't really rate the movie for it's ""acting""...for no one really did...they just all sang (with exception for George Burns narrating).  Sad that it flopped.  If people were expecting acting, they were disappointed....but if they were looking for a good soundtrack sung on the big screen and accepted it for what it was...it might have done better.  Or maybe now is a good time for a re-release (with MTV and VH1 such a big part of society today...as opposed to their non-existence in 1978.)  Bet it would do will with the teens...expose them to the late 70's and the 60's as well.

Don't expect any dialogue: it's mostly ""acting"" to existing songlyrics, so to  ""words that are set, line by line"" even when somewhere between 3  lines the situation has ceased to have anything to do with the songlyric.  The only spoken words are the voice over by narrator George Burns, trying  to tie all the songs into somewhat of a story or plot.
If you take the  above into consideration then you'll have a fun time watching this  fairytale of the good, innocent people of Heartland against the evil  characters of showbizzland. Frampton, skinny and scrawny, doesn't stand out  enough as the main character against his backup bandleader: tall and  stunningly handsome Barry Gibb. The BeeGees vocals are much, much better  than the originals by the Beatles, they're just vocally superior. Beatles  producer (sir) George Martin was ecstatic about the BeeGees vocals.
