5016093,5,B006T8KT5S,"The B-52's continue to bring the unique gift of cosmic love energy to their fans. After 66 fabulous concerts over the years, I still can't get enough of the World's Greatest Party Band !!! I was at this show in the first row and experienced the excitement of being ""With the Wild Crowd"" while my all-time favorite band performed one of their best shows ever. If you've never been to a B-52's concert...get to one!!!..this DVD will bring the fun and excitement into your home, great for parties, housecleaning...and of course, just having a really BIG FUN time. Be prepared to dance, sing along, and discover a side of yourself that really needs to just let go! Party Out of Bounds! Michael B - Palm Desert, CA",1331510400,8,709,4.590551181102362
5016094,5,B006T8KT5S,"Part of this concert was on PBS the other night for a pledge drive (along with the B-52s  themselves!) and I can highly recommend it.  Its great to see and hear Pump and Funplex from their last CD (although would have been nice if they included Juliet of the Spirits, another great track).  Recall first seeing the B-52's perform on (of all things!) The Guiding Light soap opera back in the early 1980's, its now hard to believe they have been around for over three decades.  On this DVD they play all their well known hits in a lively and fun filled concert - obvious the audience has a good time as well.  Fans will want to add this to their collection.",1330905600,21,655,4.336065573770492
5016095,5,B006T8KT5S,"This DVD is a lot of fun to listen to. It's not quite as much fun to watch, but the music is fantastic and the sound quality was great for a DVD. I listen to it at work on a Dell computer with Sony MDR-V150 headphones and it sounds great. There is a lot of energy coming from the songs on this DVD and you will find yourself tapping your feet a lot.  If I were at home and wanted to listen to something fun over the home stereo, this would definitely find it's way into the entertainment system.",1330560000,7,495,4.0

But why did it take so long for them to put out their first live DVD? Their Voices have not lost a bit and they can still jam with the best of them",1329696000,39,378,3.566265060240964

5016107,5,B006T8KT5S,"Very few bands still look and sound great well after their heyday, but, I swear, Fred, Cindy, Kate and Keith appear little aged, as if put in suspended animation sometime in the early-90's and brought out just for this show.  This is a thoroughly entertaining concert, fun as only the B-52s can create fun.  It's the same smile and warm feeling you get watching The Talking Heads in Stop Making Sense, a band in love with what they're doing and not afraid to share the sheer joy of it.  Cindy gets to shine on several songs and Fred is at full-Fred (""Pills, pills, pills, pills-stop taking so many pills!"").  Kate is wonderful, especially when interacting with the manic audience, and Keith is solid as always.  A great drummer and guitar player round out the band.  The show is also dedicated to Ricky Wilson, their fallen bandmate.  The bonus material is generous and includes a career-spanning interview with the four B-52s that is very enlightening.",1434931200,,953,4.774390243902439

5016110,5,B006T8KT5S,"Best concert video I have ever seen. It was so good you wonder if the sound was doctored and it probably was pumped up some but it was superb. Its hard to believe they have been doing this for 34 years. My favorite of the group, Kate, hasn't lost a thing and for someone in her 60's she has the energy of someone 40 years younger and still a pretty lady. All their voices sound as good as ever and sound almost studio quality. You get to hear all of the hits for the most part and the enthusiasm of the crowd made it even more fun. The climax of ""Rock Lobster"" was the best song I have seen to end a concert as it really thumped and was awesome. Th whole concert really was. The interview was a nice bonus too. Just a very well done DVD with excellent sound and visuals. If you love the B-52's you absolutely can't go wrong buying this.",1423612800,,836,4.072727272727272

5016121,3,B006T8KT5S,"I've been a B-52 fan for almost thirty years and was really happy to hear they finally released a live DVD.  Unfortunately they are thirty years older too LOL, but unlike some of the other reviews, that not why I chose to go with three stars.  They still sound pretty darn good even if they don't look like kids anymore.  My reason for three stars would have to be with song selection - there are simply a few great songs missing here that should have been played/filmed instead of some of their newer/lesser known songs.  Songs like ""Dance This Mess Around"", ""Hero Worship"", ""Dirty Back Road"", ""Summer of Love"" all scould have made this show a bit better.  ""Song For a Future Generation"" would have also been a nice addition but maybe without Ricky they don't like to play it anymore.  Since there has never been an official B-52 DVD before some archival footage would have been an awesome bonus.  Anyway, the sound is good and picture is nice.  The filming is pretty good - not too choppy like a like of concerts on DVD.  For $10 you can't go too wrong - ""Love Shack"" still rules!",1388793600,,1082,4.451776649746193

5016125,5,B006T8KT5S,"After having just attended a concert in Washington State of my favorite party band, The B-52's, I watched this DVD and felt like I was still at the concert.

5016126,5,B006T8KT5S,"It's so hard to believe they still look and sound so good after all these decades! Kate Pierson, the redhead, was about 63 years old when this was taped. The album contains a good selection of their music although it's missing ""Volcano"". There's also an interview with the band that's about a half hour long detailing their history. The audio volume flares on the interview from time to time, but picture and sound are good all through the concert.",1378944000,,448,4.6835443037974684

5016128,5,B006T8KT5S,"This was a pretty good concert with great video and audio. I hate concerts where they focus more on the crowd than the band. This one did it right, mostly focused on the band. Interesting disc with interviews from the band too.",1376179200,,227,4.428571428571429

5016131,5,B006T8KT5S,"They are all in fine form here! Blu-ray does the stage presence well and my surround sound system made it feel like I was there. The tunes presented, are all, or almost all, of your favorites in brilliant B-52's style. If you want to have a Love Shack explosion of your own, get this dvd at Amazon.",1364601600,,298,4.245614035087719
5016132,4,B006T8KT5S,Good audio and video quality; maybe too good as the closeups really show the age of the performers (and thus remind me of my age too!).  All the party songs are here and their voices are still almost top-notch.  It's a great nostalgic blu-ray though and fun to listen to.,1364428800,,271,4.4
5016133,5,B006T8KT5S,"B52 had a fantastic performance in this show at the Arena GA. With members with almost or more than 60 years old, they seem as young as they were in the late 1970's!!",1363824000,,166,4.0606060606060606

5016136,5,B006T8KT5S,"This is one of those DVD's that I would recommend to fans of the band or those curious about the B52s.  It is a great DVD with an excellent song selection and overall great visuals.  I saw them a coupel of years back in Atlanta and their shows are so much fun - you get an idea of that in this video.  Great songs, great visuals, some cool interviews makes for an excellent DVD.
If you like the band, get this video, its awesome!",1360713600,,429,4.083333333333333
5016137,3,B006T8KT5S,Love the music but watching them now that they are older seemed it bit staid and slow compared with their earlier times,1359158400,,119,4.454545454545454
5016138,5,B006T8KT5S,"Nervous about a great band with a new recording. Never fear, this is the band firing on all cylinders, with very talented musicians behind them. Gives old songs new energy. Enjoy!",1358467200,,179,4.806451612903226
5016139,5,B006T8KT5S,"I first got turned on to the B-52's when they released Cosmic Thing (featurng ""Channel Z""). Then I saw them live twice & [just like the Love Shack video] the ""whole joint was jumping"" both times! I punched up amazon to see if the ""B's"" had a DVD & there I saw this Blu-ray scheduled for release so I pre-ordered it. The performance, the colors, & the show are out of this world! Plus (I believe), what enhanced the experience was the fact that they were playing on their home turf in that concert. Great music & great show!",1358208000,,523,4.292929292929293
5016140,5,B006T8KT5S,"This version of the live band really kicks out the beat, the drummer and the bass player are a definite great additon here. Keith Strickland is one cool customer on guitar, the keyboard player does what is necessary and of course Kate, Cindy and Fred are so focused and committed when belting out some really off the wall lyrics. from the first song, ""Pump"" on this is a great sampling of the B52s. I can think of other songs that I would like on here such as ""Dance This Mess Around"" etc. but overall a very good performance.

Buy this and you will find yourself moving to the beat. Classy group for sure.",1355270400,,606,4.3628318584070795
5016141,4,B006T8KT5S,"While the production tends more toward the ""no frills"" side, the music is performed very well by both core-band and backing musicians. The blu-ray sounds good and sounds good. Very satisfied!",1353110400,,191,5.193548387096774

This is probably the best dvd concert i own I have many with Cheap Tricks Silver being second but it took awhile to have the trick knocked to 2nd but the athens Ga gang did it,1342742400,,455,3.7010309278350517

Cindy Wilson, Kate Pierson, Keith Strickland, and Fred Schneider (ALL ORIGINAL MEMBERS) can still rock it out and keep their title as ""Worlds Greatest Party Band"" This DVD covers their 34 years in the music industry. You'll be treated to songs such as ""Rock Lobster"" and ""52 Girls"" from the first record, and ""Funplex"" and ""Pump"" from the new CD. And of course the song that sent them into superstar status ""Loveshack"" PLEASE!! check this out. You won't be disappoointed.",1339372800,,586,4.699029126213592

I couldn't resist this concert recorded at the Classic Center in Athens, and glad i didn't. Even though the girls look their age for the most part, I thought their vocals were the most pleasant surprise of the show. They hit virtually every note, and only the most ardent of fans could see a loss of range or power. Schneider certainly can't screw his performance up, as he doesn't sing. Instrumentally, they sounded pretty tight to me, although I realize we're not talking Rush here. All in all, the crowd was into it, and the band appeared to be enjoying themselves...what more can I ask for?",1336867200,,735,4.575757575757576
5016152,5,B006T8KT5S,"This Blu-Ray is so much fun to watch.  The band is so tight and the support artists Sterling Campbell on drums, Tracy Wormworth on Bass and Paul Gordon on keyboards and guitar do such a great job.  Kate,Fred,Keith and Cindy's performances are just perfect. The song transitions are seamless and the non stop energy out put is just incredible.  As for the blu ray itself the video quality is excellent and the recording is DTS-High Definition Master so this blu ray is very well done.  So, if you have a nice home theatre you can take this concert to some impressive volume levels and man does it rock!  One things for sure they are having a lot of fun doing this concert and it shows.  Great Concert and blu ray.",1336521600,,712,4.438461538461539
5016153,4,B006T8KT5S,"Kate Pierson carries the show with her showmanship. She does so much.

For nostalgia, I wish there were beehives, wacky outfits or at least a change of clothes.
There should have been video effects/slides/pictures in the backdrop, or least some more choreography amongst Fred Schneider and Cindy Wilson.

Still my first time to see them in a video concert, nice to see them performing their incredible vocal effects and ululations after all these decades.

I adore the song The Deadbeat Club and its lyrics.

The show finally picks up by the end with Planet Claire and Rock Lobster (with Keith Strickland rocking out the rhythmn guitar bit). He's great and too humble about his playing skills.

Oh I enjoyed the band interview too, talking about the band's origins and more.

* The Video Menu : Can't tell what I am selecting because the fonts are almost the same shade of yellow whether choices are selected or not and it's so hard to tell .",1336435200,,942,4.713414634146342
5016154,5,B006T8KT5S,"The Blu-Ray edition of ""The B-52s With The Wild Crowd!"" is a true state of the art documentation of the band at their height of skill and enthusiasm. I love the bonus half hour chat in which Keith, Kate, Fred and Cindy sit together at the Classic Center and reminisce - revealing personal moments complemented by photos from their own collections.

The film is dedicated by the band to their late friend, brother and key original band member Ricky Wilson, and they've made sure that this is the ultimate memorial and celebration of life.

My first experience of hearing The B-52s was early in 1979 when my flatmate would go into town to Rockinghorse Records import music every Saturday and buy five new LPs by artists he'd never heard of. We fell in love with B-52s immediately and we kept it on high rotation at high volume. Neighbours knocked on our door - not asking to us to turn it down, they wanted to know the name of the band!

Their 1980 concert at Brisbane's Festival Hall was the first time the seats had been cleared away, at the request of the band, declaring that space to be ""DANCING ROOM ONLY"". They were astounding live then, and again there for the Cosmic Thing tour (where I loved the bonus of Sara Lee on bass).

I travelled with my brother to Sydney for the Funplex tour at the Enmore Theatre, and the only thing that let that show down at all was the PA. So for me a vital benefit of this Blu-Ray is that I can combine the memory of a great personal visual experience with the Blu-ray's faultless high definition close-ups and audio. I appreciate that they've mixed the surround sound to place the viewer in a sweet spot among the crowd. As the show progresses you just want to keep turning up the volume - as the band keeps liberally turning up the energy.

It's good to see that quite a few of the audience members are of my own (and the band's) vintage - and while a few of them could certainly have been wilder in response to this legendary party act, many have put in a big effort to dress for the occasion and are clearly having the time of their life.

A brilliant high quality performance and production which will make any fan of the B-52s very happy indeed.",1336262400,3,2189,4.405940594059406

5016156,5,B006T8KT5S,"Unbelievable first ever recorded full live stage, all B52 fans should not miss this! I had been witnessing the start of MTV, at a time in 1989-1991 of one of B52 peaks, showed their video clips everday  and nite, endless and very fresh party songs among R.E.M., MJ, Madonna, George Michael until Aerosmith, Gun's Roses, Bon Jovi, U2, RHC, and soon... , from loveshack to roam to cosmic things to deadbeat  club... Now in 2011, still with same spirit, same liveness! Kate and Cindy voices are still the same, low tone to high pitch, strong, vibrated, rigorous and dynamic, with awesome and still playfull voice of Fred and melodious guitar of Keith played well along with the vigorous songs.

5016157,3,B006T8KT5S,"I could have seen them live, once for about a hundred bucks a ticket not too long ago, but now I get to see essentially what they were on that recent tour for about sixteen bucks and I can see it over and over again.  There's a lot of music here, and the sound quality is good, but it sort of makes me sad to see them now compared to what they were even ten or so years ago.  That's life I suppose.  I would have added another star if this DVD concert wasn't peppered with so much carp off their most recent ""Funplex"" release which I really don't like.  The price is right, however, and the classics are here.

Now to drag my own over-50 body over to the treadmill,light up the monitor, and crank this thing up.",1335571200,8,711,4.086330935251799

5016160,5,B006T8KT5S,"This live concert dvd of the B52's performing in their hometown of Athens, Georgia, during February of 2011 is 131 minutes of ""PURE FUN"". This is simply the B52's at their very best. This concert dvd certainly proves the B52's are the undisputed, ""BEST PARTY BAND IN THE WORLD"", period. The B52's are really ""into it"" and so is the huge, packed crowd, making this one fantastic concert dvd. Watching this live concert dvd is ""almost like being there"", but probably ever better, because of the close-ups, different camera angles and etc.

Along with the B52's, you also get additional backing musicians. B52 Band Members Kate, and Cindy are as lovely as ever. I noticed a sign in the crowd that stated ""Ricky is Here"". Ricky Wilson, the original guitarist for the B52's died from AIDS in 1985. He was Cindy's brother. It's was nice to see that he was remembered.

Since the Amazon Product Description does not list the songs, then I will. The songs are as follows:
1. Pump
2. Private Idaho
3. Mesoptamia
4. Ultraviolet
5. Dancing Now
6. Give Me Back My Man
7. Funplex
8. Whammy Kiss
9. Deadbeat Club
10. Roam
11. B52 Girls
12. Party Out of Bounds
13. Love in the Year 3000
14. Cosmic Thing
15. Hot Corner
16. Love Shack (Tin Roof RUSTED!!!!)
17. Wig
18. Stobe Light
19. Planet Claire
20. Rock Lobster

Also, you get a bonus Interview with the B52's. This is a very interesting interview, where Keith, Fred, Cindy & Kate recount a history of the band. Fred and Kate were from New Jersey, while Keith, Cindy and the late/great Ricky were from Athens, Georgia (home of The University of Georgia). Also, they recall Ricky's contribution to the band, especially the song ""Rock Lobster"".

The only shortcoming I could find, is that the 1992 hit ""Good Stuff"" was not included. However, this in only minor, the rest of the songs are more than good enough to make up for this.

The Bottom Line: This is the B52's after 34 years together, performing as only the ""BEST PARTY BAND IN THE WORLD"" can perform. BUY IT, YOU'LL LOVE IT!!!!",1334275200,6,2021,4.571823204419889
5016161,5,B006T8KT5S,"If you're like me and never quite ""got"" Funplex even after several listens, this video will change your mind.  Houston, we DEFINITELY have lift-off!

The material from Funplex really soars here. Songs that I barely noticed on their latest album have now become instant favorites.  Case in point: ""Dancing Now"". I don't even REMEMBER that title!  Now, it is one of my favorite songs!

That this release is long overdue goes without saying. Fortunately, ""With the Wild Crowd"" captures the band in top form at an Athens, GA venue that they are very clearly happy to be performing at.  Every album except for the non-Cindy ""Good Stuff"" is represented here and, as much as I like their studio efforts, the live versions here are, almost without exception, far superior.  The band lays down such a tight infectious groove that you can't help but wake up and really get into it. This band is VERY disciplined but they SOUND like they about to fly out of control at any moment!  The groove holds the wackiness on stage into a very tight orbit with almost centrifigal force.

The vocal blend of Kate and Cindy is as good as anything I've heard since Michelle Phillips and Cass Eliot sang to the Papas way back in the mid-sixties. Keith's guitar-work is rhythmic and exciting; he samples perhaps the 2 greatest guitar riffs from the sixties (Satisfaction and Day Tripper) in two quite unexpected spots!  And Fred!  He has to be seen to be believed...like the ""Ruler"" from ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" barking out non-sequiters in perfect time! The B-52's vocal attack is unique, bizarre and utterly sublime.

The editing is an unexpected gift.  Ordinarily I can't stand music video editing.  It's too frenetic, jumping around constantly from shot to shot, seemingly at random.  Not so here.  It's almost as if the video editor caught the groove switching from Kate to Keith to Cindy to Fred at JUST the right moment!  There is a LOT to watch when the B-52s take the stage and the editors give you everything in just the right doses.

As the only post-sixties band to actually embrace psychedelia, the B-52s are truly a wonder to behold.  There is not enough live material of this band available so this is a welome gift indeed.  Copious thanks to the producers and the band for this absolutely superlative video!",1333152000,4,2299,4.7430730478589425
5016162,5,B006T8KT5S,"B-52s fans, slip on your Vans and prepare to relive the fun you had in the late 70's and throughout the 80's and you watch The B-52s with the Wild Crowd.

Filmed Valentine's Day, 2011, in their hometown of Athens, Georgia, this show commemorated their first live performance exactly 34 years prior.  Fans will not be disappointed as this DVD is chock full of their favorites. You know, songs like Rock Lobster, Funplex, Private Idaho and Love Shack - I mean, what would a B-52s show be without Love Shack?  It just ain't gonna happen!

Recorded in hi-def with DTS Surround, Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, the energy, excitement and fun of the show is delivered and felt.  The production is so ""real"" that you almost find yourself compelled to brush wig hair that crowd members are wearing out of your face and bumping shoulders with them as you bop to the memory-raising tunes.  The call-and-response vocals that you would come to expect are all right there and as fun as ever.  Keith Strickland's guitar work is as great as ever.

Wanna enjoy this concert on your iPod, car or elsewhere?  Then you're in luck!  This DVD was actually preceded by the CD of this very same show.  Doesn't that make you pogo-stick happy?  What you won't get with the CD are the great interviews that are included with the DVD.

The biggest response that this DVD will create is the desire of B-52s fans all over the country to attend and be a part of the very special 35th Anniversary Tour that the band will undertake this summer.  Certain fortunate towns will even get to enjoy shows that will be shared with the band's friends, Squeeze.

The B-52s with the Wild Crowd is available in both DVD and Blu-ray formats.

5016163,5,B006T8KT5S,"The Blu-ray picture is beautiful.  Sound formats include LPCM, DTS and 5.1 Dolby Surround.  Between the ultra-clear video, the terrific photography and the amazing sound, it feels almost as if you're there at the concert--except this time, it's up close and personal.  The image, drenched in the colors of a stunning light show, fills an entire 16:9 TV screen.

The biggest surprise for me was the vocal power of the two ladies, Kate Pierson (the redhead) and Cindy Wilson (the blonde).  Their voices haven't aged even the slightest bit.  I expected some fudging on the super high notes in some of their earlier songs, but they still sounded as good, if not better than, their recordings.

Keith Strickland's guitar work is superb.

Fred Schneider is his usual offbeat, subtly sarcastic self, offering up humorous comments between songs.

The rest of the band, the keyboardist, bass player, and drummer, is extremely energetic.  It is obvious that all those on stage are having a genuine blast and putting their all into delivering an excellent concert that all ages can enjoy.

The Blu-ray also features a sit-down fireside-like chat with all four members of the band.  There is a great deal of discussion about Ricky Wilson, Cindy's brother and former member of the band up until his untimely death.  The four reminisce about their childhoods, how they all met one another, and how they managed to get signed with a major label.  We're treated to vintage photographs and videos during the interview as well.

A+ all the way around!",1332633600,14,1533,4.93359375

5016165,1,B006T8KT5S,"This concert tour is hard to watch let alone own, and it's not because they are getting old, it's because they were never good to begin with.  It's a wonder how some of their songs like Love Shack ever became hits.  Maybe because they were played so much and it's hard to get out of your head, but it's not quality or even fun music.  For fun 80s pop with replay value go with something by Madonna, Michael Jackson, or even Toto.  This one is for fans only.",1331683200,4,457,4.159090909090909
5016166,5,B006T8KT5S,"The B-52's are STILL the World's Greatest Party Band just ask anyone who goes to their shows :)

I have been in love with The B-52's since I first saw them on Saturday Night Live doing Dance This Mess Around and Rock Lobster back when they first began.

I had NEVER seen anything like THAT before and I WAS HOOKED ... I was 17 and can remember the next day emptying my ""party fund"" and going to Turtle's Records to buy the 8 track of The B-52's ... their first full effort .... AND THEN to hear that they were coming to The Agora Ballroom in the near future ... I knew that I was meant to be there!!!!

Well THAT was my very first concert ever ... I had to use a Fake ID to get in and needless to say 35 years later and having close to 75 shows under ny belt .... I STILL LOVE THE B-52's

The DVD show in Athens was absolutely INCREDIBLE with fans coming from ALL OVER the place to share a very special evening with some of the most creative and talented forces in the music industry .... IT WAS AN AMAZING SHOW and the DVD is great .... they still have as much fun performing now as they did then and they continue to send out Cosmic Love and Positive Energy throughout the set list.

I give THe Wild Crowd DVD an A+++++ and would tell EVERYONE in the world who loves to dance and have fun to buy it :)

A day without The B-52's is like a day without sunshine!!

I love them as people and as entertainers and THEY DESERVE TO BE IN THE ROCK & ROLL HALL OF FAME and we should not rest until they are!!

God Bless the day that The B-52's came into my world as life has always been better with them in my life!!!

Didn't have the feeling of some 'veteran bands' I've bought lately that seemed they were playing to a senior center. Glad I bought this.,1527984000,,306,4.581818181818182

8503954,5,B006T8KT5S,"I bought this DVD for my little sister who lives near Athens, GA.  During my visit, we spent an hour at Southern Brewing Co., in Athens, GA.  The previous night, I was on a cross-country airplane flight from Oakland, CA to Atlanta, GA.  I did not sleep for even one second during the entire flight, but I remained awake for long enough to enjoy the brewery visit.  Anyway, as a fond thank-you gift to my lovely sister, I bought her this DVD.

I've seen recordings of performances of B52s from the same year, posted on YouTube.  Also, in late 1980, I went to a disco in Madison, Wisconsin and they played music by B52s (which I had not heard of at the time).  I was surprised, when all of the other patrons of the disco, called The Stone Hearth, began sinking closer and closer to the floor.  I later realized that they were sinking down in response to the lyrics of Rock Lobster, which recite, ""dowwwwn, dowwwwn!""  My favorite compositions by B52s include Lava, Party Out of Bounds, Summer of Love,  Channel Z, Topaz, Deadbeat Club, Revolution Earth, and more.  The catchy style of the music could be characterized as having a naive and non-threatening cocky-in-your-face attitude.

Of course, B52s were among the most prominent of the New Wave groups, which prevailed over the pop scene from the years 1978 to 1985.  Now, just to reiterate what everybody already knows, the most prominent of the New Wave groups included B52s, Talking Heads, Devo, Brian Eno (""Bush of Ghosts""), O.M.D., U2, Madness, Squeeze, Human League, Altered Images, Killing Joke, Black Flag, and Fear.",1509321600,,1574,4.742647058823529
