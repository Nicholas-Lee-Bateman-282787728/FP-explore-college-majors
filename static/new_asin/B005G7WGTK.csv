It perfectly highlights today's fight for equal rights and LGBT equality with an interesting story line. I love it!",1339459200,2,271,5.044444444444444
8471290,5,B005G7WGTK,"I found this to be a really important story addressing Gay Marriage at a time when it is a central potical issue.  After hearing the President come out in support of Gay Marriage this week I would hope more people would watch this film for a peek into the lives of a gay couple trying to make a relationship with a child work in this difficult world.  Great performances enhance a thought provoking plot with an ""I didn't see that coming"" ending.  I hope you enjoy it as well.",1336608000,2,476,4.325842696629214
