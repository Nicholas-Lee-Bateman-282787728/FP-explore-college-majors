5186894,1,B008WAM2QA,All of the matches were a complete waste of time. and the main event hell in a cell was a joke. cant even call it a match.,1352678400,,122,3.5555555555555554
5186895,2,B008WAM2QA,"A couple of notes here that WWE showed their support for the fight against breast cancer here by having the middle rope pink. Also with Jerry Lawler still recovering from his heart attack, J.B.L. & Jim Ross did commentary alongside Michael Cole & those who are college football fans would get a laugh out of the references between Ross & Bradshaw throughout the matches.

Randy Orton vs. Alberto Del Rio - Orton took the fight to Del Rio right off the bat as within the first minute, he was bouncing his head off the announce table & throwing him into the ringpost before Rel Rio was able to use his momentum against him to gain an advantage.  Del Rio heavily focused on Orton's arm & was relentless in pulling on it with various armbars including one where he hung himself off the ropes while also countering Orton's attempt at a powerslam into the cross armbreaker.  It was when Del Rio got over confident & mock Orton that he was able to regain control as they traded momentum throughout the rest of the match countering each others signature holds with a finish that literally came out of nowhere.  This was a great opening match that went back & forth between both men.

Tag Team Champions Team Hell No (Kane & Daniel Bryan) vs. Team Rhodes Scholars (Cody Rhodes & Damien Sandow) - Team Hell No singled out Cody early with Bryan working over Cody's arm including just stomping on it before Rhodes & Sandow attempted to work over Kane by taking his leg out but to no avail as Bryan regained the momentum for his team with heavy kicks & a suicide dive.  Rhodes Scholars used a distraction to turn things in their favor singling out & working over Bryan this time before Kane was eventually able to get the tag but things started to fall apart with too many miscommunications between Team Hell No resulted in Kane losing his cool.  The match was your basic tag team match but nothing special as it just continued the storyline of dysfunctional partners in Team Hell No while with a finish (that really just fell flat on everyone) that left room for a rematch.

Intercontinental Champion Kofi Kingston vs. The Miz - With both men facing off on back to back shows weeks earlier, they knew each other very well which we saw in the opening moments as they avoided the others signatures moves before the match was eventually taken to the outside where Kofi was able to avoid being thrown into the steel steps only for Miz to nail him with a running big boot.  Miz slowed the pace down & grounded Kofi to take him off his game with Kofi being able to recover & going into a series of reversals between the S.O.S. & Skull Crushing Finale before Miz once again regained the momentum & even doing a knee buster & exposing that leg that was effective as he was relentless pulling Kofi off the top rope via his leg along with submissions like the half crab.  This match had good exchanges between the two resulting in a nice match but not better than their previous match on TV weeks earlier.

United States Champion Antonio Cesaro vs. Justin Gabriel - Cesaro attacked right at the bell with some early wrestling before he was able to dominate with various holds like a fall away slam, double stomp, and armbar.  Gabriel fought back with a springboard moonsault & later two separate DDT's out of the corner but Cesaro still brought a fight including a clothesline that turned Gabriel inside out & later catching him in the middle of a springboard on the outside with an uppercut.  An average match but nothing special.

Rey Mysterio & Sin Cara vs. Primetime Players - A rematch from the Tag Team Title Tournament earlier in the month as Rey & Cara started out in control using some double teaming moves but PTP was able to catch Rey in the middle of a 619 attempt working him over before the hot tag was made to Sin Cara who worked them over with kicks & a flying crossbody but got caught himself.  PTP grounded Cara with moves like a body scissors & chinlock combination along with an abdominal stretch with Cara able to finally get some offense in including a standing version of the Slice Bread #2 that landed himself directly on his head.  This was like the previous tag match where it was the basic tag team formula that resulted in an average encounter.

World Champion Sheamus vs. Big Show - Show came out dominate causing Sheamus to attempt to chop him down with a shoulderblock to the knee followed by other shoulderblocks before Show caught him & punished Sheamus just beating him down in the ring with hard chops in the corner to the point where you saw blisters on Sheamus' chest.  Show took the match to the outside where he threw Sheamus so hard over the announce table that Jim Ross almost got taken out in the process before taking the match back in the ring & worked him over very slowly with moves like the bear hug while always catching Sheamus whenever he tried to build some offense like kicking off the Texas Cloverleaf so hard that it sent Sheamus to the outside.  Things started to pick up towards the end with Sheamus finally able to hit some heavy blows against Show that took him down before both men kept hitting signature moves that have normally won them matches in the past only for both men to keep kicking out.  They attempted to tell the story of Sheamus being ""out of his element"" as he's facing someone more powerful than he is but Show's domination during a majority of the match was just too slow of a pace & went on for too long that it took a while to get into the comeback by Sheamus.

Divas Champion Eve vs. Layla vs. Kaitlyn - With both divas having issues with Eve dating back to the previous PPV, she was the odd woman out as both girls targeted her individually & double teamed her before it became every woman for herself when one tried to steal a pin & even both girls trying to pin Eve at the same time before they went at it with a series of back to back near falls.  Eve was able to get things going in her way focusing on Kaitlyn's previously injured ankle including various submissions like a grounded anklelock as Layla was able to get involved in the action resulting in a face to face battle in a position that J.R. didn't know how to call before Kaitlyn was able to showcase her abilities from here with an attempt as a submission of her own along with some strength of her own with a gutbuster off her shoulders & a over the shoulder slam.  All three girls worked hard here & it showed as I was impressed with all the various submissions throughout the match while Kaitlyn showed that she had some strength with the only problem being that they were just in a bad spot on the card.

Hell In A Cell Match: WWE Champion C.M. Punk vs. Ryback - Punk tried avoiding Ryback but was eventually caught as Ryback dominated tossing Punk into the cage multiple times that hurt Punk's arm causing Punk to resort to tactics like using a fire extinguisher from under the ring to temporary blind Ryback before he made Punk pay for that with a punch that went through a steel chair.  Ryback continued to overpower Punk causing Punk to go aerial with a few blows off the top rope & even a suicide dive to the outside that only hurt his arm even more but kept his advantage by using Ryback's momentum against him such as moving out of the way of his charge towards the steps while also bring a kendo stick into the match before the another man involved in this match made the difference with an aftermath that can be defined by the phrase ""you may have won the battle but you lost the war.""  WWE put themselves into a no win situation here (another story for another time) with Cena being injured as they had to keep their current version of Ultimate Warrior/Goldberg strong while still keeping the title on Punk and the added stipulation of Hell In A Cell didn't leave much room for anything other finish as they had to have a winner in this match resulting in a match that was on the level of Undertaker/Big Boss Man where it was easily forgettable once it was over & didn't live up to the standards this type of match.

There wasn't anything that really stood out or have a heavy replay value on this show with one of the problems being that with WWE having up to 7 hours of television a week resulted in some of these matches already happening on free TV (Mysterio & Cara/PTP) with some being even taking place twice within the last month (Cesaro/Gabriel & Kofi/Miz).  Combine that with the issues with the main event title matches I've stated earlier then this is just one PPV that I would rank 2.5 stars but since we can't give half stars then I'll be nice & put it at 3.  In the end, only get this if you don't already have the previous television matches from the past month elsewhere or if you have some spare cash that you won't miss.",1351900800,4,8775,4.432919254658385
5186896,4,B008WAM2QA,"The Alberto Del Rio-Randy Orton match was a back-and-forth smash-mouth bout. The Tag Team title match between Team Hell No(Kane & Daniel Bryan) & Team Rhodes Scholars(Cody Rhodes & Damian Sandow) was a nice entertaining tag bout even with the DQ ending. The Intercontinental title match between Kofi Kingston & The Miz while not a bad match,it wasn't as good as their first bout from The Main Event. The United States title match between Antonio Cesaro & Justin Gabriel was so-so. The tag team bout between The Prime Time Players(Darren Young & Titus O' Neil) against the team of Rey Mysterio Jr. & Sin Cara was a fun entertaining tag match. The Worlds title match between The Big Show & Sheamus was a classic David-and-Goliath battle but this time Goliath(Big Show) won. The Triple Threat match for the Divas title(Eve vs Layla vs Kaitlyn) was solid for a 3 way. The Hell In The Cell Match for the WWE title between CM Punk & Ryback was not great but pretty good with a twist ending to boot. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1351382400,2,1023,4.505376344086022

A stupid Cell match lasting under 10 mins and having Punk using a self-hired referee! A referee using low-blow to Ryback, Punk doing a roll-up, a referee holding both of Ryback's legs, and making a fast count all in that order. I want my damn refund! Fire the referee and strip or fire Punk for this! You think Punk needs to earn respect? How about you now WWE! Shame on you!!!",1345939200,2,665,4.045454545454546

8531465,3,B008WAM2QA,"There was a time in WWE history when HELL IN A CELL meant something amazing. When it became a regular PPV, this was the fourth PPV, it became just another Pay Per View.

The Main Event featured CM Punk defeating Ryback to retain the WWE Championship. Other matches included: Randy Orton defeating Alberto Del Rio, Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow defeating Kane and Daniel Bryan by disqualification in a match for the WWE Tag Team Championship,  Kofi Kingston retaining the WWE Intercontinental Championship by defeating The Miz, Antonio Cesaro retaining the WWE United States Championship by defeating Justin Gabriel, Rey Mysterio and Sin Cara defeating Darren Young and Titus O'Neil in a Tag team match, the Big Show defeating Sheamus to win the World Heavyweight Championship, and Eve Torres defeating Layla and Kaitlyn in a Triple Threat match for the WWE Divas Championship.

You get eight matches with the best match being the Big Show/Sheamus match. The rest is pretty much filler. However, the price IS right and you'll probably want to add it to your collection",1393545600,2,1067,5.016949152542373

HELL IN A CELL 2012

Spoilers

1. ALBERTO DEL RIO VS RANDY ORTON-great opening match between these two with each man looking good. Orton was all over Del Rio but Rio kept going back to Ortons arm and working it over. Momentum would swing back and forth between them until Orton was able to put Del Rio away and win the match.

2.[TAG TITLE]KANE & DANIEL BRYAN VS CODY RHODES & DAMIEN SANDOW-the second match of the night was for the tag titles. This match while good was really about showing Kane and Bryans dysfunction as a tag team. Rhodes and Sandow looked good in this match as they took advantage of Team Hell Nos miscues with each other. In the end we get a DQ with the champs taking the l.

3.[I-C TITLE]THE MIZ VS KOFI KINGSTON-I really liked this match here as both men put on a good show. Kofi kept things light and at a fast pace when the match was at his advantage. But Miz would soon slow things down and take it to Kofi. Great back and forth affair with the champ Kofi pulling off the win.

4.[US TITLE]ANTONIO CESARO VS JUSTIN GABRIEL-this was a better match than it gets credit for but was mostly Cesaro in my opinion. Justin of course comes to fight and shows that he may be a future main event player. Both of these guys have it in them to move up if given the opportunity. Any way this is a good match with moments for each guy but it is Antonio that dominates and wins.

5. SIN CARA & REY MYSTERIO VS THE PRIMETIME PLAYERS-good tag match here with Rey and Sin Cara looking good early and double teaming the players. But that wouldnt last as the players came back and worked over Rey. Of course eventually the tide would turn with Sin Cara and Rey taking the match in what maybe your basic tag match but still a good one.

6.[WORLD TITLE]SHEAMUS VS THE BIG SHOW-I really enjoyed this match right here as Big Show really dominated for the most part. His size and strength was too much for Sheamus most of the time. Big power moves from Show had Sheamus messed up and close to being pinned multiple times. But Sheamus showed his heart in this match and refused to stay down. There were times when it looked like he was going to come back and win this thing. But in the end a well placed KO punch from Show and poorly timed Brogue kick from Sheamus lead to a new champ in the Big Show.

7.[DIVAS TITLE]EVE VS LAYLA VS KAITLYN-this was a pretty good Divas match for the title. The story had been building between these three at the time and it led to Booker T making this three way match. From the jump two of these ladies decided to double team the other. Of course that did not last long as all wanted to win this match and the title. Good match over all with more than we usually get, Eve keeps the belt in the end.

8.[HELL IN A CELL WWE TITLE MATCH]CM PUNK VS RYBACK-why oh why did the champ come out first, I absolutely hate that. It does not matter who the fan favorite is the champ always comes out last in my opinion. Any way I was looking forward to Punk keeping his belt a reign in tact after this match and I was not disappointed. This was all about getting Ryback even more over in the companys eyes and still keeping the belt on Punk. Ryback looked strong in this match taking it to Punk, but CM did whatever it took to keep the momentum on his side. The ending seemed to upset people but it fit in with what a heel is supposed to do, win by any means. Punk keeps the belt thanks to Brad the Ref.

Over all this was a good event but far from the best but I was entertained. The event kept storylines going and kept the belt on Punk. That was good enough for me since that is what I was really most interested in. but there were some good matches including the main event even though others disliked the ending.",1362355200,2,3743,4.186111111111111

8531470,5,B008WAM2QA,This is not an actual review of the Pay-Per-View itself but is more of a  review of the match listing shown on the back of the DVD case. I just wanted to point out  to everyone that has this and is going to buy this WWE Pay-Per-View on DVD in the future that if you look on the back of the case at the match listing that the match listing is not complete and does not list the Tag Team Match featuring Rey Mysterio & Sin Cara vs The Prime Time Players Darren Young & Titus O Neil or the United States Championship Match featuring United States Champion Antonio Cesaro vs R-Truth for some stupid reason.,1357776000,,602,4.181034482758621

8531472,4,B008WAM2QA,"This is the worst WWE Pay Per View of 2012. And the main event between CM Punk and Ryback is the worst PPV main event not just of 2012 but of the last ten years. This PPV is called Hell In A Cell but has only one HIAC match that last only ten minutes or so, and has a terrible ending that made me glad that I didn't order this on PPV for $45. I bought the dvd for just $15 for one reason, the Big Show wins the World heavyweight title. The Big Show is one of my top ten all time favorite wrestlers and his winning the title is the only reason I give this PPV four stars. Unless like me you don't want to miss any of the Big Show's title wins you can skip this one.",1357430400,,664,3.75
