3871762,5,B00284EMI2,If you could own just one baseball video...  This one provides footage of the very best players from every generation.  Nostalgic for old-timers and an introduction of the all-time greats for new fans.,1354579200,5,201,5.0606060606060606
3871763,4,B00284EMI2,My baseball enthusiast son has watched this well over 100 times.  Gives some great commentary and video to players he's only read about in books.,1331769600,5,145,4.8
3871764,5,B00284EMI2,"I purchased this DVD right after Ted Williams, the great Boston player died (I knew he was in the video) and I sat in my living room watching it on the big screen TV with the volume cranked and I felt like I was in the ball park with the legends of baseball. The names of the great stretched back to the first days of the 20th century and as the living legends spoke of those that had come before their eyes would shine with pride for being part of such a great game, a great fraternity. The younger generation still playing spoke with pride about shaking the hands of one of their idols and the crowd was just great. If indeed the team depicted in the video could have been fielded - it would be the most priceless game ever played.",1251331200,14,733,4.169014084507042

8355702,3,B00284EMI2,I thought that they would show more scenes from the all star game in Atlanta that showed more of the players for the all century team. Needless to say it is ok but could have been better.,1415923200,,187,4.081081081081081
8355703,1,B00284EMI2,Horrible this was NOT the original product production. I have the original this was to be a gift and there was no way I could give this,1403395200,2,135,4.037037037037037
8355704,1,B00284EMI2,"The All-Century Team of Major League Baseball is filled with no-brainer selections, but there are others that may not have any business on the list. In fact, at 30 players, this team is a little too bloated anyway, so why have them? Either way, debates among friends of who should be on this team are probably more involved and engaging than this disc will be, so I'd pass on this.",1391904000,,381,4.457142857142857
8355705,5,B00284EMI2,"I used this video to teach my students note taking techniques, and it worked great for that. I even had students who had never shown any interest in baseball before come up to me and talk about how much they enjoyed watching the video. Making guys who haven't played in forty years sound interesting is hard to do, and this video does it and does it well.",1364083200,4,355,4.313432835820896
8355706,4,B00284EMI2,Great D.V.D. for all levels of baseball fans. This spans many years of players from the early days to the current players.,1359417600,,122,4.590909090909091
