8408048,1,B003XF1W4W,"Hey, I haven't bought this thing, I was listening to the radio show coast to coast am and heard this guy on there so I decided to check out the dvd a caller brought up.  I read the negative review and decided to check youtube.... What the guy says is absolutley right, retarted music and still pictures is all you see in the horrible 7 minute clip I watched on youtube.  You can see the pictures he shows on this dvd for free on his website.  The fact that this guy is charging 35.00 is criminal!!  Don't buy this, it's a waste of money, there's nothing in the video where this guy who used to work at national geographic got anyone to independenlty varify his pictures were real or anything, it's just his pictures and then a written comment about how the lights are defiying newtons laws of motion or something, but there's no actual scientist who confirms that!  This guy used to work on air force one and nat geo and he can't take his work to anyone he knows to legitamize his stuff????? Please!  Don't buy this!!!!",1310860800,,1019,4.365079365079365
8408049,5,B003XF1W4W,"Few people know there is a hidden history of UFOs over Washington, D.C. This is the best documentary ever produced on the very-sensitive subject of UFOs routinely penetrating the prohibited airspace over DC. Despite the ongoing U.S. government and main-stream media's cover-up, the truth is finally reaching the public thanks to the work of a professional, DC photographer named Will Allen. His authentic, graphic evidence of UFOs landing at night on the U.S. Capitol, on July 16, 2002, should have already been seen by millions of Americans on the nightly news. However, due to the official censorship of this extraterrestrial event, it has been blocked from airing on television. Currently, this documentary video is the only way the public can see for themselves what has been, and still is, going on with UFOs in Washington, D.C.",1297036800,,833,5.132352941176471
8408050,1,B003XF1W4W,This video is the biggest of all rip offs.  It's about four minutes of very annoying music set to photos showing nothing at all.  The camera zooms continually in and out on the nothing photos till you want to scream.  This piece of trash should be removed by Amazon immediately.,1296000000,,278,4.52
