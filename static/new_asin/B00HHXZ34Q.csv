8632860,5,B00HHXZ34Q,"Two years after buying these videos, we still enjoy watching them. The humor is a little too zany for my wife's taste, but my 2 sons and 1 daughter (ages 13, 9 and 5) and I all think they are hilarious. Extremely creative, great voice actors, non-stop laughs. We wish they had made more videos in the series!",1471046400,,308,4.327586206896552
8632861,4,B00HHXZ34Q,"A slightly odd series, but the kids love the humor and it does try to teach important lessons. I sometimes think it tries a little too hard to be ""cool"" though.",1426377600,,160,4.193548387096774

8632864,5,B00HHXZ34Q,"We love this quirky show.

The only we could have lived without was bringing a 'girlfriend' into it for the fellas.
Kids mimic what they see. Let's give them a reprieve on worrying about that so soon.

Otherwise, we REALLY wish they'd make more. Only three?! :(",1409443200,2,261,4.531914893617022
8632865,5,B00HHXZ34Q,My kids love Junior's Giants!  I love it!  Very smart and entertaining.  They are able to teach a lesson without preaching.  My kids range in age from 14 down to 2 and they will all agree to watch these DVDs.  My one and only complaint is that there are only three.  Please make more!,1406160000,,284,4.166666666666667
