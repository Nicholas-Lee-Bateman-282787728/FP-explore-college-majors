7871596,5,6304453450,"Time and Space Adventures marks the turning point in the Tenchi Universe series. Before these three episodes, the focus has been on Tenchi's life on Earth and how the introduction of six beautiful but crazy women from space has changed his life. After the Time and Space episodes, the gang moves into space after being declared criminals by Planet Jurai. From that point on we see how Tenchi has effected the lives of the women rather than the other way around. Tim and Space adventures is the point where everything in this series shifts. From an entertainment perspective, they are three of the best episodes that any of the Tenchi series have seen. The comedy is laugh out loud funny, the romance is touching, and ending is good enough to leave one speechless.

The three episodes begin when Washu introduces her latest invention, a device that can reshape reality. Naturally things go awry, and the entire gang finds themselves floating through a number of parallel universes. Essentially, each of the six girls (with the exception of Washu, who is in limbo trying to fix the mess) gets to create their own universe. However, some things never change. Ayeka's universe has her betrothed to Tenchi, but Tenchi is having an affair on the side with Ryoko. Kiyone gets a world without Mihoshi...to a point. Sasami gets a world where she becomes a superhero named Pretty Sammy (which served as the impetus for a spinoff series of its own). Ryoko gets to be with Tenchi, but Tenchi is less than happy with his life as a criminal.

As I have said before, these episodes are a blend of the two halves of the Tenchi series. They have all of the hilarity of the first half, with the girls fighting over Tenchi and the like, but also the tenderness of the second half. While all of the adventures ultimately occur in alternate realities, they provide some real insight to the characters and what makes them tick. It also delves some into the love triangle between Tenchi, Ryoko, and Ayeka, providing hints as to how Tenchi really feels about the girls and who he will ultimately pick.

Although Time and Space Adventures occurs in the middle of the series, it also serves as a good jumping on point to those passingly familiar with the series but who have never watched it from the beginning. It shows all the characters in a nutshell, shows us what makes them tick, and sets the stage for the second half of the series. All through this story, it also provides viewers with the humor, drama, and romance that we have come to expect of Tenchi Universe. If there is one group of episodes that demonstrates everything that the Tenchi series are about and does it to perfection, it is Time and Space Adventures.",1136246400,,2701,4.6821052631578945
7871597,5,6304453450,"This video to me is great.  It is where Kiyone and Mihoshi has each other again and start stuff all over from the beggining.  Kiyone hates being with Mihoshi but she has to stick with her.  How did Mihoshi became a Galaxy Police Officer (GPO) or any other police for that matter?  I like this video because they have a friendship (will at least Mihoshi thinks so,)and they get a job ang go sing karaoke.  I like this video because their one of my favorite characters on the cartoon.  The first person I like in the Tenchi Saga series is:  1. Ryoko
  2. Sasamie
  3. Washu
  4. Kiyone
  5. Mihoshi
  6. Ayeka
  7. Tenchis father
  8. Tenchis Grandfather Katsuhito.
  9. Saukuya
  I like all the Villians in the whole Tenchi Saga from Tenchi Muyo!, Tenchi Universe, and to Tenchi In Tokyo.  But at least get this video is really cool!",1015804800,,832,4.38
7871598,5,6304453450,this is a very good part to the tenchi series and if you like tenchi you will like this.,1010188800,,88,3.6842105263157894
7871599,5,6304453450,I think this is the most thriling tape of all.  When the whole gang messes Washus new project they all go into different lifes.  One is where Ryoko and Tenchi goes off robbing banks in America and Ayeka who wants Ryoko apprehended to give Tenchi back to her.  This is the best tape their is so buy it please!,1009843200,,308,4.186440677966102
7871600,4,6304453450,"These episodes fill out the Tenchi on Earth part of the series, and have all the best elements of a hilarious sitcom and touching drama. There are three episodes on this tape: ""No Need for a Genius,"" ""No Need for Memories,"" and ""No Need for an Arch Rival.""
The first episode is, of course, about Washu. It provides some of the reasons that Washu was banished to Earth in the first place (what are dimension oscillating bullets anyway?), and introduces her newest invention: Mecha Washu. Mecha Washu is a robot version of Washu designed to help with her experiments (and to take over the universe, of course), but Mihoshi screws the project up and the robot ends up with her brain. This episode is hilarious and it's worth the price of admission just to see Washu go to war against her own creation.
The second episode is a bit more serious, and shows a bit of Tenchi's past. It snows at Masaki shrine, and while there are a few moments of comedy, the episode focuses mostly on Katsuhito, Noboyuki, and Tenchi remembering the day that Tenchi's mother died. The flashbacks are very touching, and the episode includes a lot of foreshadowing as to Tenchi's fate. I ultimately wish that someone would explain how Tenchi's mother died, but I guess one can't have evrything.
The final episode on the tape is my personal favorite (mainly because I'm a huge Ryoko fan), and introduces Ryoko's arch rival Nagi. Nagi is a bounty hunter come for Ryoko, and she kidnaps Tenchi to lure Ryoko to Venus for a battle. The fight scene is great, and if you like Nagi, don't worry because she makes a few important appearances later in the series.",999734400,2,1627,4.633217993079585
7871601,5,6304453450,"This is my favorite of the Tenchi Universe series.
Washu's ingenious device is hijacked by the dreams of Ryoko, Aeka, Mihoshi, Kione and Sasami.  It creates new realities where their deepest desires (ummm, basicly involving Tenchi) become manifest.
Poor Tenchi.  Now the girls are chasing him across alternate dimensions of spacetime!  (Wonder what Albert Einstein would think of this?)
My favorite is Sasami's dream. She becomes Pretty Sammy.  (This is the 2nd instance of the Pretty Sammy character. She first appeared in the Mihoshi Special and later got her own OVA and TV series.)  Yup, I'm a sucker for Pretty Sammy.  Plus, in this fantasy world, Ryo-Ohki can talk!
Must buy for dedicated Sasami and Ryo-Ohki fans.",992304000,,720,5.111111111111111
7871602,5,6304453450,"Tenchi Universe is cool. This video has great graphics. My favorite character is the one with the blue hair. japanesse cartoons are cool such  as Tenchi Universe, Sailor Moon, and Pokemon.",966384000,,188,5.064516129032258
