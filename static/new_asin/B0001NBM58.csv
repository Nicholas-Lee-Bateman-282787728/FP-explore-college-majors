2018138,5,B0001NBM58,"This is an essential tool for every Apollo researcher. The complete downlink series has the entire TV footage , plus training and a few stills.  You can appreciate every detail of the EVA's  and the Rover routs. The deployment of the ASLEP, The troubles with the drill, and the famous episode of the Feather and the Hammer. The chapter sections are chronologically arranged, and subchapters allow you to review film magazine pictures, assembled moon landscape panoramas, and the separate 16 mm films. You get the pre-flight tests, suit-ups, multi angle launch views of the Saturn V rocket, mid flight downlinks, news conferences, splashdown recovery and even CM lunar survey film footage.

Spacecraft films have made a wonderful job. The set contain every footage of the mission, no the  mix of several Apollo mission footage, generally trying to represent one entire flight. You have to acknowledge that in some part there is not Audio with out documental music, The voice are the original.

You will have over 12 hours of  the Entire Apollo 15 Mission",1102377600,8,1053,5.022988505747127
2018139,5,B0001NBM58,"This is a fantastic and historically wonderful DVD of the famous Apollo 15 moon mission. It is literally ALL here -- everything the hardcore Apollo enthusiast would want. It is a labor of love and well worth owning.
I just wanted to add for the previous reviewer from Mexico: Scott and Irwin did deploy the American flag at the end of EVA 2 (the one that went to the flank of Hadley Delta and on which the famous Genesis Rock was found). On their return to the LM, they deployed the flag. However, Irwins camera had malfunctioned and Scott's camera was black and white only. So Scott decided that rather than have B/W photos of the red, white and blue, they would wait until the next day and have their color camera loaded.
So the famous color photos you have of Scott and then Irwin standing at the deployed flag were actually taken by the astronauts on the next day, at the beginning of EVA3. That is why the positioning of the Rover camera looks different -- because the flag deploy was on day two and the color photos of the astronauts with the flag was on day three.
Enjoy these marvelous DVDs of one of the Great Explorations of all time - Apollo 15",1083542400,6,1155,4.376744186046512
2018140,5,B0001NBM58,"I remember following the space program as a kid. I knew all the astronauts names, etc. I even locked myself in my closet in a kind of simulated spacecraft I'd whipped up with Christmas lights and what-not. I think Mom let me stay in there for about 3 hours, then I had to go to dinner.
  This DVD has got to be a dream come true. Apollo 15, if I remember correctly, was one of the best photographed of all the moon missions, at least up to that time. And I also believe it was all color. This DVD, very simply put, has EVERYTHING. All the footage of everything that was filmed. And there was a LOT. 6 discs. Indulge yourself. I know I will ...",1081900800,5,643,4.095238095238095
8015011,4,B0001NBM58,"There is no narrator to explain anything, very little on-screen information of any sort.  Much of the footage is poorly lit; what is shown is obscure; sometimes there is no image at all, just audio.  Yet here you will see some of the most incredible images in the history of mankind:  men working and playing on an alien world.",1359849600,,327,4.508474576271187
8015012,5,B0001NBM58,"I can't believe some of the things I've read in a couple of these reviews, complaining about the picture and sound quality. I've just finished watching this set, and there are a few things to keep in mind.

First, as already mentioned, the 16mm film camera was out of commission almost the entire time they were out on the moon. Watching the videos, you hear them talking about it, calling up to Houston for advice on how to get it working, getting the advice, trying to get it to work and not succeeding. At one point, they do the ""Grand Prix"" with Jim Irwin thinking he's filming Dave Scott put the lunar rover through its paces. When he finishes filming, he checks the camera and finds it jammed and nothing was filmed. You hear him & Scott discuss it with each other and with Houston and they voice their disappointment a number of times over the next several hours, even on the next EVA. So they came back with very little film. If the camera didn't work, what was the producer of this video set supposed to do, make up cartoons?

Second, they had trouble with the remote control on the rover's TV camera, and it got worse throughout the mission. I don't know how those cameras worked, but there was some gear or something that kept slipping and the camera would drift up, up, up, and end up pointing at nothing but the black sky. Houston would have to call up to the astronauts and ask them to adjust the camera by hand. This happened a number of times, especially on the third EVA. They missed some valuable video when Scott was having difficulty with the drill, because while he & Irwin were fighting the drill, the camera slipped, ended up pointing at the sky, and Scott & Irwin were too busy to adjust it, so the NASA engineers couldn't watch their difficulties and give advice. This slipping camera thing was fixed by Apollo 16. I finished watching that video set too, and they didn't have any camera problems at all, with the rover TV camera or the 16mm film camera.

One thing I would like to point out, there is, on this set, actual TV footage of the rover being driven. When the TV camera was still mounted on the tripod, and after Scott & Irwin deployed the rover, Scott drives it away, and about 4 seconds of it was caught on video before Scott & the rover disappeared from the picture. This was a fascinating little snippet and made you wish they left the camera on the tripod and let Scott drive around a bit before they put it on the rover.

Another thing: in Al Worden's very good autobiography, ""Falling To Earth"", he discusses his deep space EVA, the first spacewalk ever out of earth orbit, and he says that they missed it on film and only got very poor pictures of it on the TV camera. I actually thought the TV pictures were pretty good, and that the EVA was well covered. Some of it was dark, but you could see pretty much everything and could follow what was going on, especially if you watched it with the voice transcript as posted on the Apollo Flight Journal website in hand.

I guess I must really be a space freak because I was completely riveted while watching through the many hours of this video set. Yes, it's raw footage with no commentary to guide you, but I watched it with an iPad hooked into the internet and followed the video while referring to the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal website, and this gives all the explanation & commentary you need to get the technical aspects of the flight. I watched this over a number of days and was sorry when I finished it.

One personal thing, which deals with the video quality. I watched this all live, when it was happening. I was about ten years old at the time. All we had in our house was a small black & white 16 inch television. I watched all the Apollo missions on that TV, and they all looked like Apollo 11 to me. I never saw any of it in color until I got this set. I was amazed how good the video was. When Scott comes down the ladder for his first steps, and you've never seen pictures from the moon before that clear & vivid, it's like seeing it for the first time all over again. I said to myself, ""No wonder a lot of people think it was faked."" You expect pictures from the moon to look fuzzy & washed out, like they looked on Apollo 11. Here the picture is amazing most of the time. People have become so spoiled. This was 1971, folks. A lot of people, like us, didn't even have color TV. Now we have people expecting to see HD video from an event taped 40 years ago. There were equipment malfunctions that robbed us of some great pictures. Well, the camera malfunctioned, the drill malfunctioned. You can hear Scott & Irwin fighting with the drill, like we might fight with balky equipment while working in our gardens. But all this was happening on the MOON.

It's all great stuff. I only wish this was more easily available. I ordered it direct from Spacecraft Films (at a reasonable price), and their customer service (from my experience) is not the best. I ordered the complete set of moonwalk missions several months ago and still have not received Apollo 11 & 14. I do so want to order the non-moonwalk missions, 7, 9, 10 & 13, but won't do it till they fill my still unfulfilled order.",1352332800,,5192,4.374093264248705
8015013,5,B0001NBM58,I have been an avid follower of the U.S. Space program since the mid 60's.  I watched this particular flight in it's entirity on live TV as a kid.  Spacecraft films has done a superb job with all of the Apollo flights.  The DVDs of Apollo 15 are of a quality level that equals the original television broadcasts and excels above TV in many respects.  I recorded the audio of many of the flights myself (recording to tape from TV) and the audio here is far superior to anything I had in my own collection.  KUDO's to Mr. Gray and Spacecraft films for the fine job in bringing us this collection.,1150156800,2,594,4.315315315315315
8015014,5,B0001NBM58,"I've always said that there are people who get what we're doing, and people who don't. I'm writing this explanation for those who might misunderstand some of the reviews, most especially ""data dump"" below.

First of all, there is no video feed one can record ""straight from"" in 1971. The material on these sets is scattered among various centers in various conditions of preservation. The work that goes into bringing it all together, including new transfers of all of the film material (which you should compare to the previous grainy transfers of the filmed material), is expensive, time consuming and difficult. The 6 DVDs are packed with the video and audio material collected, including all of the TV and motion picture film from the mission, as well as all the stills from the surface, plus training, preparation, launch, recovery, a 3D representation of the landing site showing the traverses, and more.

Apollo 15 had a 16mm camera taken on the surface on the LRV. It jammed repeatedly. There is very little 16mm film footage from the surface on Apollo 15. (Nor is there 16mm footage of the trans-Earth EVA, it jammed too). ALL of the 16mm film shot on Apollo 15 is included on the set. Apollo 16 had a 16mm camera which took nearly all of the film you've seen from the LRV and it was the only time footage was taken of the LRV driving on the moon. Apollo 17 did not carry a 16mm camera out on the surface during their EVAs. If one is going to criticize, one should at least make half an effort at some research to back up their claims.

The only motion picture film from the CM in lunar orbit is included. (very little).

Our sets were designed to present this information without a filter, so that it can be used by serious researchers and those with a serious interest in the record of the U.S. space program. For this reason, on purpose, the material is left in the original form. We do perform noise reduction and color correction on the TV and make new digital transfers of the film. But the material on this mission is from 1971. This was a time when just to change a channel you would get up, clunk the thing over a few channels, adjust your rabbit ears and try and get the best possible picture. And the TV was from a quarter of a million miles away, analog, with low signal strength.

In actuality, how lucky we truly are to have any chronicle of these voyages of exploration. In contrast to the complaints about the picture quality of the time, I find the footage extraordinary.",1142294400,27,2497,4.54
8015015,1,B0001NBM58,"I don't understand why this set is so expensive. It's basically a transfer of poor-quality audio combined with some poor-quality video of the feed in 1971. The colors are washed out and the images blurry. Shame on NASA for only bringing one video camera with them to the Moon. You'd think with 6 DVDs worth of information, there'd be an animation with timeline of every event that happened during Apollo 15. This would have put into context the bits and pieces of the mission seen. There are also no explanations of what's happening. I got more information about Apollo from an old edition of National Geographic (March 1964).

The rover had a high-quality 16mm color film camera on it. This footage is not included. Also, didn't the command module take still and motion film while orbiting overhead? Where was it during all of the activity below? Instead of showing a blank screen in the places where there is no video available, how about showing a diagram of where they are in the mission or explainations of the various experiments and their results? I still don't have a clear idea of where exactly on the face of the moon they landed and how far the astronauts ventured in their moon buggy.

Although this is visually and acoustically annoying, there is much information. It's unfortunately that this is the best document of this historic mission.

8015016,1,B0001NBM58,"The set should contain 6 DVD. But should we ask if they are all different before to order it ? They put twice DVD number 4, and no number 3.

The quality of the images is so poor, the comments so boring... I would say that this set is a real desaster.

If you are a fan of Apollo history, avoid this. You could just be upset after ordering this item.",1129334400,,350,3.915492957746479
8015017,5,B0001NBM58,"An incredible six DVD set encompassing the first extended manned flight to the moon in July, 1971. Mark Gray's Spacecraft Films has realized a dream for many Apollo Freaks that have wanted the best quality footage and video availiable of America's early space missions. Previously released bootleg videos of the Apollo moonwalks were copied from grainy film kinescopes, not the master videotapes. For this new set, Spacecraft Films made sure that nearly all of the lunar EVA video had been digitally enhanced and remastered from the master two-inch videotape reels that were stored at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. This results in that ""live as it happened"" look that only original master videotape can give you. Bravo, Spacecraft Films!",1128643200,5,744,5.208333333333333
8015018,5,B0001NBM58,"This review is partly in response to a previous reviewer who criticized the television/video quality of the EVA material. But first, I will reiterate what others have said and highly recommend this set, as it chronicles one the most exciting lunar missions (and one of NASA's most exciting missions overall), a mission that is often forgotten by the general public in the shadow of Apollo 11 and 13. If you're a space buff and want to ""re-live"" these historic lunar missions in as much detail as possible, the Spacecraft Films sets are the only way to go. It's not material the general public will necessarily enjoy, since it is mostly presented raw and unedited. But for the general public, there are many greats DVDs to choose from (Nova's ""To the Moon,"" ""For All Mankind,"" etc.) that cover the Apollo program highlights and history.

Now regarding the video quality...one should note that Spacecraft Films did put a disclaimer on their website that some of the source material in this set was not in the greatest condition. One could be forgiven for not noticing that disclaimer since it does not appear to be repeated here on Amazon. We should remember that archival of videotape was not NASA's top priority in 1971, since nobody ever figured people would be wanting to watch complete lunar EVAs 30+ years later. (Funnily enough, they probably figured we'd have a fully functional moon base or would be stepping foot on Mars by now. But I digress.) In some instances, one color of the videotape would drop out from time to time. In some instances, they were forced to use kinescope footage whenever the videotape was in too poor condition (Note: kinescope is essentially a film taken of a television screen...at one point before video became the norm, it was the only way to archive ""live"" broadcasts...most surviving television footage from the 50s and 60s is kinescope). Whatever the case, they used the best source material possible.

As for the way the footage was shot, keep in mind that this was all done live ""on the fly"" and was never intended to be a slickly produced video of the lunar activities. With the television camera mounted on the rover, it was controlled from the Earth in order to allow mission control (and the general public) to follow the Scott's and Irwin's activities. Hours and hours of EVAs are bound to have their moments of poor lighting (it was the moon, after all), occaisonal poor framing, quick zooms, etc. as they camera operator tried to keep up with the astronauts. These weren't Hollywood directors, but instead were NASA employees and astronauts trying to document their activities as best as they were trained to do. In comparison to Apollo 11, having a color camera that traveled with the astronauts and could be controlled from Earth was a ""giant leap"" forward in how the missions were seen back home.

The reason for shooting television/video instead of film is obvious when you think about it. Film must be returned to Earth and processed before you can view it. And a film camera can't be remotely operated with any ease, since the remote operator cannot see what results he is getting and doesn't have a viewfinder. Apollo 16 astronauts DID carry a 16mm film camera with them on their EVAs, but only shot short segments in order to conserve film. They still used television for the majority of the EVA stops, because it allowed viewers back home the chance to watch the proceedings live.

When one considers the available technology in 1971, it's just plain amazing that images this great could be broadcast live from the moon's surface. Any defects or flaws are understandable and don't really diminish from the great accomplishments of the Apollo 15 mission.",1116547200,16,3710,4.847003154574132
8015019,5,B0001NBM58,"This is a must-have DVD. I was there standing next to the VAB building when the Saturn V with Apollo 15 took off. I remember the sound reaching us just as the first stage cleared the tower. The shock waves caused one's skin to vibrate, and I remember having to yell at a friend standing next to me to be heard over the tremendous noise of the rocket motors almost 3 miles away. We were all caught up in the euphoria and yelling ""go, go, go "" as the giant rocket rose with a majesty into the sky balanced on  a flame longer than a football field. I can't wait to get my copy.",1114214400,8,574,4.035087719298246
8015020,5,B0001NBM58,"As a fairly new fan of the Apollo series, and by no means a scientific expert, I was concerned that a boxset on Apollo 15 might be a bit overwhelming. Thanks to the excellent production and organization of this Spacecraft Films set, my fears were unfounded.

As other viewers have stated, everything regarding the mission is here. But even if you want to skip through a lot of it (like some of the prelaunch meetings), you won't be disappointed. You don't get the feeling that you're witnessing a greatest hits or highlight film of a great moon visit, but almost the whole thing.

I think Spacecraft has done a remarkable job with this series giving us a comprehensive library of an incredible project in American history. The more I watch, the more I can't wait to see another mission out on DVD. Why just read about it and look at stills, when you can actually relive it?

If you're a parent or teacher, it can be an incredible teaching device. But if you just appreciate knowledge, it's an amazing revelation.",1111017600,6,1012,4.611111111111111
