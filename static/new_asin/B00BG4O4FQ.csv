5616212,4,B00BG4O4FQ,"The professional reviews for this were so ecstatic that I may have been
a bit over-hyped, and felt a twinge of disappointment in seeing it,
which is not to say I didn't quite enjoy it

Entertaining and beautifully made, this is another modern black & while
silent film, this one an adult re-telling of the Snow White myth.
There's no denying the technical virtuosity on display, and the ways
that film-maker Berger finds to update the tale to Spain in the 1920s,
center the story around bullfighting, and still stay true to the
original story are clever and sometimes very amusing.

What was missing for me was a deeper layer of emotion.  I appreciated
and respected the film, but it was too much a fairy tale for me to
believe in it, yet too real for me to be carried away into a fantasy.
That said, it's good enough that I will gladly re-visit it.",1368057600,3,849,4.464516129032258
5616213,4,B00BG4O4FQ,"This version of the Snow White story works in more ways than I can easily name. It's true to the original, at least in general outline, with the evil stepmother, sidekick sent to do her in, seven (or so) dwarves, and poisoned apple.

So, although this rendering lives within the classic framework, it redecorates that frame completely. Set in Spain, after the WWI but before the Spanish civil war, this makes the most of Spanish culture, and especially the culture of bullfighting. Instead of Disney's miners, the dwarves entertain in la corrida - and, given her father's training, so does Blancanieves. Although generally a man's sport, there have always been a scattering of women in the sport. This gives the movie a modern feel, though, with Blancanieves a strong and capable character in her own right.

That little anachronism appears as just one of many. The story of Snow White might date back to the middle ages, but this twenty-first century realization of the Grimms' nineteenth century adaptation is set in the early twentieth. Staying true to the 1920s era of its setting, this movie steps into the tradition of silent film, with only music for a sound track and occasional panels of spoken word written out. The actors, especially the evil Encarna and Sofa Oria as the young Carmen, express themselves dramatically, using only gesture and expression. But, within the the 1920s setting, they've inserted some very modern characters, including a dwarf of complex sexual disposition, a Submissive (capital S intended) swain for the evil stepmother, and a very charming character in the ""kissing booth"" scene.

The story ends on an ambiguous note, but one that gives hope that Prince Charming will arrive in her future. Maybe not the one you might have guessed, but roles in real life aren't always filled by the stereotypical character, either. On the whole, an imaginative and satisfying version of the familiar story - but certainly not one for the kiddies.

5616214,4,B00BG4O4FQ,"There is an implicit understanding between author/auteur and his audience. For example, Edgar Allen Poe will give you all sorts of dreadful things, but he does it in an imaginative manner and makes you think. Fairy tales present us with terrible images (kids being baked in ovens, women being swallowed) but promise us happy endings after all is said and done. So when you have a re-telling of the Snow White story, we expect there to be some savage images, but in the end our long suffering princess will eventually triumph, get the prince, and live, as they say, happily ever after.

If you're one of those people who thirst for the happy ending, stop here. This original and imaginative version of the Snow White tale gives us many things, but it doesn't provide that happy ending we've come to expect, and that may turn off many viewers.

OK. If you can put aside the breach of the covenant between author/audience, then this film is certainly worth watching. Its finest charm is that the film is silent, apart from the music and occasional sound effects. Kudos go to Maribel Verdu as the wicked stepmother, Daniel Gimenez Cacho as the bull-fighting father, Angela Molina as the grandmother, and little Sofia Oria as the young Snow White. Their ability to show emotion without words is excellent.

Most of them will not be well known to US audiences. They are primarily Spanish actors. Maribel Verdu played Mercedes in ""Pam's Labrynth"" (2006) and Daniel Cacho was in ""Get the Gringo"" (2012). This is the first film for little Sofia Oria.

Dare I say that the quality of this silent film surpasses the much touted ""The Artist"" (2011) which was a major award winner.

Another outstanding feature of this film is the black and white photography by Kiko de la Rica, for which he won a Goya (the Spanish equivalence of an Oscar). And the music by Alfonso de Vilallonga is equally impressive.

The film won 10 Goya awards and was nominated for another 8. The Hollywood Reporter said ""the broad-strokes storytelling is generally brisk, lucid and imaginative"". The NY Times said the film ""deftly blends cinematic antiquarianism, period atmosphere, and primal emotions""

Fans of silent films will love this one, and fans of the recent trend to re-tell classic fairy tales will also enjoy it, bearing in mind my caution about the breach of contract.",1365206400,6,2343,4.827930174563591

5616221,3,B00BG4O4FQ,"Laden with awards; entered as Best Foreign Language Film for the 2013 Oscars; it seems rather churlish to criticize Pablo Berger's silent retelling of the Snow White myth, bearing strong visual and stylistic parallels to Michel Hazanavicius's THE ARTIST (2011).

And yet the film's overall impact is reduced by an uncertainty of tone. There are sequences of quite graphic violence - notably at the beginning, when bull-fighter Antonio Villalta (Daniel Gimnez Cacho) is gored by the bull; or when the infant Carmencita (Sofa Oria) is force-fed roast chicken by the evil Doa Concha (ngela Molina), the remains of her once-faithful pet Pepe. Such moments exist uneasily with the comedy of the adolescent Carmen (Macarena Garca) as she joins up with the bull-fighting dwarfs, who tour the country with a specialty act. Then there is the problem of the ending which is positively necrophiliac in tone. Perhaps director Berger wants to make a veiled comment on the ways in which innocence is at once cherished yet abused in contemporary societies, but the sudden shifts of tone prove uneasy.

On the other hand, BLANCANIEVES contains some stunning individual sequences, attesting to the director's abilities as a filmmaker; for example, the use of dissolves unifying past with the present, as the dead Antonio continues to affect Carmen's life, even after he has been thrown down the stairs by Doa Concha; or the moment when Doa Concha meets a grisly end at the bull-fighting venue, gored to death by an angry bull. The use of shadows to suggest violence in this latter sequence is memorable.

As a piece of silent movie-making, BLANCANIEVES is hard to fault. Berger understands how one image is worth a hundred words, and keeps the dialogue to a minimum. Rather he relies on the gestural versatility of his cast to communicate emotions - a task they embrace with relish. Add to that the snappy editing, with a plot that positively zips by, and one can see why this remake of Snow White proves so diverting. If it wasn't for those tonal shifts ...",1450137600,,2041,4.944606413994169

5616228,5,B00BG4O4FQ,"It's a silent movie. Oh, there's music, if you want it...but it's silent. You won't miss a thing. It's also black and white, and may I say, very artistically done. Death...is conveyed by the dunking of a white dress into a vat of black, the stopping of a record...emotions are displayed prominently on faces. When this is done as superbly as this, you don't need words, nor do you need nudity or cursing or anything else.

The similarities to the real Snow White? Let's see...she has a wicked, wicked stepmother who has all the control. She ends up left for dead in the forest and is discovered by dwarves. I do believe the one who is supposed to be Dopey falls in love with her. Grumpy tries to kill her...but that's not a similarity.

The differences: The dwarves are the bullfighting dwarves and Snow White is not only the daughter of a famous matador, but becomes a matadora! And...be forewarned..this does not have a happy ending. It's really quite sad. If you need that cheesy HEA, this is not for you, though I will say the wicked witch gets what's coming to her and that alone is worth it.

Loved: The little bits of Flamenco, the acting, the facial expressions, the pet rooster. Oooh. The way Snow White/Carmen fought a bull when she was supposed to be fighting a calf. She did it. She did not back down. I felt so much suspense whilst watching this. I gasped aloud and declared to the pug, ""Oh no! That poor matador.."" Also loved the costumes. I believe this is supposed to take place in the late 1920s. The villain has the same hairstyle as me (maybe it's time for a change? :( ) and Miss Fisher.

I was very into it and I don't normally do silent movies. Strange, as I really did enjoy The Artist. I just don't like the old ones, perhaps because they are so short?

Morals: Be careful who you marry...be very, very careful and oooh, don't sign things if you can't read. Dios!

What I didn't like: I found it hard to fathom that someone so very, very evil could be..of all things...a nurse!

Wondering how in the world bullfighting, Flamenco, and a rooster tie into the tale of Snow White? I'm not going to give you a play by play as that would ruin the surprises...but I will say I'm highly recommending this to fans of old movies, silent movies, foreign films, or anyone who likes to watch unique television. Tired of the same old? Do pick this one up.

A lady matador...that's pretty darn strong. But she's also strong because of all the stuff she faces, with grace and dignity.",1394755200,4,2492,4.461538461538462
5616229,5,B00BG4O4FQ,"It has been said the greatest tragedy of silent film is that its era was too brief. It seems Hollywood belatedly agreed with this assessment when they named The Artist (2011, dir. Michael Hazanavicius) only the second silent film to win a Best Picture Oscar (the first was 1927s Wings, directed by William A. Wellman). The Artist had a somewhat conventionally plotted narrative, clearly patterned after Star is Born (1937, also directed by Wellman), which was perhaps apt, as it borrows silence to portray a silent film. However, its charm and an infectious love of the era won it numerous accolades. Following close on The Artists heels came Blancanieves (2012 dir. Pablo Berger), which did not get nearly the recognition The Artist did, but is the better film. Blancanieves almost feels as indebted to Guy Maddin as it does to the silent era, which may have kept it from attaining the populist status afforded The Artist.

Fifty-year-old NYU film grad Pablo Berger chose a familiar story: the Brothers Grimms Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. This adaptation came on the heels of Hollywoods pedestrian Snow White And The Huntsman (which predictably made a gazillion dollars) but represents a much darker, idiosyncratic telling of the tale. Berger grasps an important aesthetic of silent film: its sense of otherworldliness. Berger clearly relishes a hallucinatory texture akin to such silent artists such as Tod Browning or Erich Von Stroheim. He transplants the story, brimming with humor and tragically latent left-field sexuality, into and around the arena of Spanish bullfights.

The famous toreador Antonio Villalta (Daniel Gimenez Cacho) dispenses of a quintet of bulls, only to be gored by the sixth (the bulls were actually killed, which sparked boycotts by animal rights advocates). Villaltas pregnant wife Carmen de Triana (Inma Cuesta) witnesses his maiming, which renders him a quadriplegic. This sends Carmen into premature labor, which proves fatal after delivering her namesake. Villaltas anesthesiologist, Encarna (Maribel Verd) sees opportunity and maneuvers to marry the tragedy-stricken celebrity, which puts his infant daughter under the care of her grandmother.

As young Carmen grows, she is never allowed to visit her father. After her grandmothers death, Carmen is transferred to her fathers estate and sadistic stepmother Encarna. Chopping off Carmens hair, butchering her pet rooster, and separating a daughter from her imprisoned, suffering invalid father are the tenets of this quintessentially evil fairy tale mommie dearest.

Reconciliation between father and daughter is managed, albeit briefly, but long enough to tap Carmens genetic talents. After her fathers death, Carmen barely escapes being a victim of filicide, and hauntingly evokes Mary Pickford as she merges into the grown daughter (played by Macarena Garcia) of both natural parents. Ecarnas henchman one-ups her Disney counterpart by trying to rape Carmen before plunging the knife, which gets him gored by the feisty daughter of Villalta. Left for dead, Carmen is adopted by seven dwarf matadors.

A career in the ring follows, and, naturally, Carmen and the Los Enanitos Toreros develop a special bond. Blancanieves is equal parts pure joy and delirious darkness (with one of its most perverse scenes being staffers having their photographs taken with a celebrity corpseshades of a finale to come). Such idiosyncrasy probably does not afford a happily-ever-after option. After learning that her believed-to-be-dead stepdaughter is the new matador taking Spain by storm, Encarna murders her henchman for having failed in his job, and proceeds to the arena with poisoned apple in hand. Blancanieves concludes on a perverse shocker, worthy of Luis Buuel.

Like many silent film artists, Berger approaches the seedier elements with good aesthetic taste; the difference being that past artists were required to take such an approach due to period censorship, while Berger chooses to be indirectand, consequently, gives the film a surprisingly modern vibe.

5616230,5,B00BG4O4FQ,"NOT FOR CHILDREN.  This is for adults.  It has violence and sexual scenes.  If you want something cutesy, get the Disney animated feature.

I first watched this movie on a flight to Europe and enjoyed it immensely.  I bought the DVD so my wife and I could watch it on a large screen and loved it even more the second time around.

FOLLOWING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS:

It is the early years of the 20th century and a famous matador is gored by a bull.  The same day, his wife dies giving birth to their daughter.  The daughter is raised until around 9 or 10 by grandmother, who dies on the day of her Christening.  She is forced to live with the gold-digging, ruthless stepmother who keeps her now quadraplegic father in a second floor bedroom.  Years later, the father is killed, and the girl is presumed murdered by the step-mother's lover, the chauffeur.  The girl has amnesia...  I will not spoil the rest

It is a sometimes surreal and realistic portrayal of love and loss.

The movie pays homage to the silent era, with beautiful music and stunning B&W cinematography.  The adaptation is often touching and sad (with pieces of dark humor).  Early 20th century Spain is meticulously recreated.  The story is very well written.  The acting (with many famed European actors/actresses) may seem melodramatic, but that is also a way of paying homage to the silent era.

I would highly recommend.

5616232,4,B00BG4O4FQ,"You may not know this Goya-winning Spanish film, but you do know the story. Blancanieves is the Snow White fairy tale by a Bilbao-born director Pablo Berger who has a very unique cinematic vision. The story, set in Andaluca of the 1920s, is told in a black-and-white silent movie style (though music is accompanied).

Macarena Garca (her first feature film) plays Carmen, a daughter of a renowned bullfighter. After a series of tragic events, she escapes from her abusive stepmother Encarna (Maribel Verd, Pan's Labyrinth), and becomes a bullfighter Blancanieves.

Well, the films story is actually a little more complicated, but basically it is the same as that of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale. The Seven Dwarves and a poisoned apple also appear, but in a slightly different way.

What is the most impressive about Blancanieves is its beautiful cinematography (by Kiko de la Rica) and costumes (by Paco Delgado, Hugh Jackmans Les Misrables).

Perhaps buoyed by the success of Oscar winner ""The Artist"" a few year earlier, a score of production companies and a baker's dozen producers assembled this excellent retake on the Grimm Brothers fairy tale.  But like many fairy tales, this isn't necessarily for the kiddies.  It has hints of necrophilia, child abuse and sadomasochism sprinkled throughout.  Like ""The Artist,"" the film is shot in glorious white and black with a squarish 1.33:1 aspect ratio.  It is also silent with English subtitles over some scenes and intertitles between others.

The setting is Spain in the late 1920's.  Antonio Villalta (Daniel Gimenez Cacho) is Spain's greatest bullfighter.  He has a perfect marriage to the beautiful Carmen (Inma Cuesta) who is pregnant with their first child.  While fighting a ferocious bull, Villalta briefly averts his eyes when a photographer's flash goes off.  This is enough time for the bull to seriously wound the great matador.  As he fights for his life, Carmen goes into labor.  It is a difficult delivery and while the baby girl survives, Carmen does not.

Villalta has become a quadriplegic.  Enormously wealthy, he becomes one of the bullfighter's care nurses, Encarna (Maribel Verdu), primary patient.  She sees an opportunity and seizes upon it becoming the next Mrs. Villalta.  The evil woman shuns the baby, Carmencita who is raised by her grandmother (Angela Molina) until her death.  With no other options, the now young girl goes to live in the huge mansion with her dad who she has never seen and the horrible step-mother.

As Carmen reaches her teens, she is attacked by the chauffer, who is also the occasional sex slave of Encarna.  Rescued by 7 dwarfs who make a living by fighting small bulls, she becomes part of their company.  In an attempt to save one of the dwarfs from a bull, Carmen goes into action remembering a few of the moves her father managed to teach her from his wheelchair.  She is a natural and is hailed by the crowd and goes on to even greater glory, billed as Blancanieves (Snow-white).

Director and writer Pablo Berger has made a beautiful dramatic film, filled with enough angst to keep it appropriately dark.  At the same time, there are enough humorous scenes to keep the film balanced.  Highly recommended.

The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p resolution.  It is shot in 16 mm but the film looks very clear and not at all fuzzy as might be expected.  Unless you have a sharp technical eye for such things I doubt you will have anything to complain about. Although this is a silent film it has a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 score.  It is excellent and is a nice accompaniment to the Spanish film.  Here are the extras:

5616239,5,B00BG4O4FQ,"Last year, when Blancanieves was released (yes, this was released in 2012 over in Spain and was submitted, but rejected, to the Academy for the Foreign Language Film category), there was a lot of murmuring over the internet about the fact that this was a silent film.  Ignorant wannabe cinephiles were balking at it, calling it a gimmick and accusing it of capitalizing on the sudden rush of fame (and Academy embrace) of 2011s The Artist.  This was such a sad happening because we simply don't have enough creativity in film these days, and a rebirth of the silent film genre would hopefully spark some newfound imagination in filmmakers.  While it has become almost cool to poo-poo all over The Artist as being shamelessly gimmicky and Academy pandering, I still love the film.  No, it doesnt make my top ten of 2011, but I still really enjoyed it and while it has some pretty lazy screenwriting, it has loads of charm and flash and made me smile ear to ear with each viewing.

Dismissing Blancanieves simply because you are fearing or expecting The Artist redux is a shame, because this film is FAR different in tone and construction and manages to not just be a very good film, it is a BETTER film for many reasons.

Blancanieves attempts to put yet another twist on the Snow White story.  Yes, 2012 was stupid with Snow White remakes, and while the two US releases (Mirror Mirror and Snow White and the Huntsman) may have soured you to the idea of a modern cinematic take on the fable, I encourage you to forget your quibbles and just give Pablo Bergers inspired take a try.  Yes, it is in black and white.  Yes, it is silent.  Yes, it is foreign.

Who cares!

The film takes place in Seville, Spain in the 1920s, Blancanieves tells the story of a matador who suffers a terrible accident in the arena.  His beautiful wife (who is heavy with child) goes into labor and the two are slowly dying in the hospital simultaneously.  The matador makes it through, but his lovely wife dies.  This bodes well for the conniving nurse, Encarna, who seeks the rich matadors hand in marriage.  The child did survive though, and she lived with relatives until another accident left her homeless and thus at the mercy of her fathers new wife, Encarna.  Little did young Carmen know, but her father was being held prisoner by the ruthless Encarna who was wasting his fortune away for her own selfish gain and keeping poor Carmen with the animals.  When Carmen finds her father, her life starts to shine (ever so slightly) while she bonds with the man she lost forever.  Encarna is loathsome though, and when she finds out about their reunion, she makes drastic steps to keep her dominating power in hand.

What happens next leaves poor Carmen an orphan and an amnesiac and in the company, and care, of bullfighting dwarves.

What Pablo Berger does here is beautifully flesh out the story we all know and love and give it an identity all its own.  Yes, this is inspired by the classic story, but it is 100% Blancanieves, and that is what I love so much about this film.  This film knows what it is and what it wants to say, and it does so with expert precision.  I also find that the criticism about the whole silence is a gimmick aspect to be a misguided argument, since Bergers decision to tell this story as a silent film really wasn't for mere style because the style here is far more reigned in than it was in The Artist.  This isn't a homage film.  At the end of the day it basically boils down to a decision on Bergers part.

Hey, Ill make this film silent; and that was that.

With each passing frame, the film consumes with a darkness that is laced with a special charm that can only be found in films of this nature.  It is inviting and comforting despite the films harsh tones, and maybe even because of them.  There is something almost honest about the way that Berger tells this story.  This is the story that Disney would NEVER tell and yet it is the one that they should have.  The depth of despair in the films finale (utter perfection) is only heightened by Bergers ability to spawn a sliver of hope.  It feels completely balanced and accurate, something that can rarely be said about film these days.",1383868800,19,4205,4.512549537648613

5616244,3,B00BG4O4FQ,"Even though it was released in 2011, there is no way of reviewing Blancanieves today without making comparison to the Best Picture winner from two years ago, The Artist. Both are modern silent films which attempt the appearance of being much older than they are, for no clear reason.

With The Artist, it was a silent film about the difficulties a silent movie star had with the advent of sound, something which we only fully understand with the film's only spoken words at the film's conclusion. Blancanieves, on the other hand, has no clear reason beyond novelty for being made as a silent film. This doesn't make it a bad film, although it is somewhat inexplicably stylistic in these retro film choices.

  In addition to the silent-film style, the narrative is borrowed from the familiar tale of ""Snow White,"" with all magical elements removed. Taking place in 1920s Seville, the movie utilizes bullfighting into the storyline, while keeping all of the classic elements of the narrative. The seven dwarves become seven bullfighting dwarves, and the beautiful Carmen is the latest addition to their show after she is found in the wilderness nearly killed. As we know from the familiar story, Carmen was meant to be killed at the order of her evil step-mother. With no memory of who she is, Carmen begins a new life with the dwarves and as a bullfighter.

8568017,3,B00BG4O4FQ,"In a nod to modern sentiment decrying the bullfights, the bull gets pardoned in the film. Alas, modern sentiments did not go so far as to prevent cruelty against women in the hands of a male director.

I go to Sevilla to watch bullfights a lot. And I'm a woman. And I watched this movie because a woman bullfighter (yes, they exist outside of fairytales) said on t.v. that it was good. You can't get a better endorsement than that.

This movie hits all the right authenticity notes except one - the ending. If you think this is a movie about strong female heroine, and you're rooting for the lovely little girl and the actress who plays the grown up version of her, brace yourself - you are going to be creeped out by this director's vision. It came out before #MeToo. Patty Jenkins, please fix this.

The soundtrack is a redeeming feature.",1520640000,,840,4.477124183006536

8568021,5,B00BG4O4FQ,"The director and his film makers combined silent film making techniques, perfectly, with modern film making techniques.  For their script, they combined the fairy tale of Snow White, the Grimm classic not the Disney version, and the fable-like, if you wish, story of Christ, creating what amounts to a parable. The film is a very Catholic focussed film, the white of Snow White's clothing reflecting the white clothing which dominates our visual depictions of Christ, the dead Snow White carried from the arena by the spectators of her death holding her high above  them, a long shot from high above, the image of her above them in a crucifix-like pose, and more. The ending is uplifting spiritually, the tear down the dead Snow White's cheek showing us that we die, we all die, but innocence eternally prevails and inspires love. We lose our innocence, mainly through betrayal, but that innocence endures and compels us on a journey that can lead to our resurrection. When we respond, we can be saved. For this film, at least, Snow White's journey confirms Christ's  journey.",1492819200,,1076,4.933701657458563

 I never liked the movie <THE ARTIST>. I never liked silent B/W movies made after 21th century. But this one changed my life. Best Spanish film so far was <ATAMN! aka TIE ME UP TIE ME DOWN><THE SECRET IN THEIR EYES>. Its just have been changed. Its now 10 pm Korean time and I don't think I can go to sleep tonight.

 This is Spanish subtitled full length film version. If you cannot follow the movie, just watch the last 5 minutes of the movie. I just couldn't help myself from crying.

Maybe you won't because you didn't saw the whole film.
 But thats ok. You will see the whole film anyway. Its one of the best film made in 21th century anyway.

Its based on the fairy tale SNOW WHITE but nope it is not at all the same.

Its written all over that it is Spanish film.

Its got Pasodoble, Its got Spanish dance, its got bullfight (Even Pedro haven't got enough artisic power to achive this far). Its got everything that we want to see about Spanish film.

And then dazling lightning and great acting, detailed mis-en-scene.

You will die to have a copy of this film right after watching it. In five seconds.

When she died. (Maybe not)

One of the dwarfs- the handsome one- finally kisses her, and she drops just one tears, we know that something magic is going to happen.

The director PAblo Berger is wise enough not to show details to make it Hollywoodish cheezy happy ending. Its just all opened ending. We just have to grab out heart- heavy and full of joy at the same time- and if it was at night that we watched, we won't be able to go to sleep that night.

Forget about all the worries, tomorrows, politics, all that things.
 Love, beauty, truth and power of justice. Thats all are important for now.

This is not just a fairy tale. Its something we should carry on for the rest of our life.
 Its a true work of art, a masterpiece.
 Its just sad that more American and Asian countries didn't noticed this masterful movies so far. Its been 4 years already since this movie have been released.

PS: This movie is 4:3 Not a widescreen.

Where to find: Bluray is 20.99$ dvd is 14.99$ from amazon. Urge you to watch in bluray.
