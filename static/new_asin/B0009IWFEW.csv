She did struggle with some of the moves, but that's good -- it gives her room to grow!  It wasn't so challenging that she got discouraged, nor was it so easy that she lost interest.  Perfect!",1358380800,2,331,4.2063492063492065
2293257,5,B0009IWFEW,"I am a teacher and did this with some of my students.  It was challenging, but it did a good job of clearly showing the poses and not talking too much!",1322179200,2,151,3.870967741935484
2293258,5,B0009IWFEW,This is a good (beginner-intermediate) video for teens or adults.  The instructions and demonstrations are well done.  I am 46 and I enjoy doing the workout when I do not have time to go to a yoga class at the health club. My children try to follow along with the workout.,1299456000,,272,4.313725490196078
2293259,2,B0009IWFEW,"I got this for my 11 yr old as she wants to become more heathy and liked my yoga DVD. This is not for someone new to Yoga, the poses in it are poses that take alot of pratice, and it is not easy to follow for a kid, if kids are not already flexable they could get hurt tring some of this. I plan to let my daughter do Yoga with ravi singh and ana brett so she can benifit from Yoga instead of just tring to do pretzel poses right off.",1212019200,13,434,3.6774193548387095
2293260,5,B0009IWFEW,I was so glad to find a yoga tape geared for her age range. I HIGHLY recommend it!!,1210204800,8,83,3.6666666666666665
2293261,4,B0009IWFEW,My daughters and I tried this video and we really like it.  My 7 year old found it to be a bit challenging and had to stop a few times but she wants to keep trying so she can get through all the moves without stopping so that is awesome!  My 10 year old love love loved it!  She did all the moves but not very deeply and she has room to grow as well.  The style of this video is perfect for this age group up to about 13.  The girls in it aren't perfect with every move but close enough where you know the kids are doing it right.  It is frustrating to kids to not be able to be perfect the first time and this video does not have that feel. I am long time yoga enthusiast and I was so happy my kids got inspired by me and that they found a video catered to them.  It has slow and controlled movements and really gives them time to get into the positions and get a stretch before it moves on to the next.  It was great for a rest day for mom too... we all need to stretch more! I highly reccommend this video.,1202947200,34,1009,3.8173076923076925
8061494,3,B0009IWFEW,"Pros: Confident and capable teens lead session.
Cons: Does not have different levels of skill.
  Does not emphasize listening to body so
  that muscles and back are protected.
  Does not have any centering, meditation,
  mood balancing, or breathing exercises.

My 12 daughter, who has done yoga since she was a toddler said that it was difficult to not push too hard into the poses and that she felt like something was missing without a meditation of some kind following the session.
I ended up donating the video after a month and instead bought the Ahshanti Generation DVD which is wonderful and also sold on Amazon.",1469491200,2,619,4.819047619047619
