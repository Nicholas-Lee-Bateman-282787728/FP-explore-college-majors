2258160,4,B0008ENI20,"Being a Colin Firth fan-atic, I am so glad to see him in something other than a rom-com (although, I'll never stop loving Mr. Darcy)!  Colin is terrific in this film and is supported by excellent camera work and other interesting effects which add to the creepiness of the film.  This is not a horror film (thank God), but rather a psychological thriller shown thru the eyes of the psychotic person suffering, from what amounts to post-traumatic stress syndrome.  If you're looking for Mr. Darcy, you won't find him here - in fact, Colin gets to show us his real ""acting chops"" as he digs into the mind of Ben.",1119571200,2,610,4.527272727272727
2258161,4,B0008ENI20,"TRAUMA is one of those films that invokes mixed responses from audiences depending on their expectations: it seems to polarize people into love/hate categories.  While not a great movie, TRAUMA has the courage to pose a storyline that is more involved with the interior aspects of a mind altered by physical events.  We are asked to observe the world through the eyes of a battered brain which happens to belong to a man with a tattered past. If linear stories are preferred then this is not a film to recommend.  For those viewers willing to crawl inside the malfunctioning mind, this film is mesmerizing and full of rewarding moments.

Ben (Colin Firth) is seen in the opening flashbacks driving a car at night with his wife Elisa (Naomie Harris).  There is a car crash and Ben awakens from a coma in a hospital, convinced that Elisa is dead.  He wanders the hospital, drawn to the morgue where the caretaker (Cornelius Booth) enhances the mystery of the place.  Ben learns from the TV room that a famous singer Lauren Parris (Alison David), for whom Elisa has been a dancer, has been murdered.  His mind disintegrates and everything that follows is a mlange of delusion mixed with bits of reality that exquisitely define how the post traumatic stress syndrome can be driven to psychosis if not recognized and treated.

Ben leaves the hospital (or does he?) and continues his art career in a vast building undergoing reconstruction (a building that has been a hospital....), befriended by his mate Roland (Sean Harris) and by his landlady 'Charlotte' (Mena Suvari).  More flashbacks (mostly childhood memories) occur as Ben talks things out with a 'psychiatrist' (whose face we never see...) and during episodes with channeler Petra (Brenda Fricker) he is informed that Elisa is not dead.  Ben becomes a suspect in the murder of Lauren Parris and his chasing after evidence ultimately leads to a series of disasters, a series of metaphors and delusions, all of which find Ben sitting back in the hospital where he started.

Did any of this story really happen, or was it the fabrication of a mind traumatized to the brink of breaking?  That is left for the viewer to decide.  Though plagued with some static moments and a lot of conversation buried in background music and sounds, Director Marc Evans with writer Richard Smith  take us on a suspenseful journey, made all the more bizarre by some extraordinary camera work and tremendously inventive settings.  Not a movie for everyone, but for those willing to enter the Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome mind, this case study is rewarding.  Grady Harp, June 05",1119398400,23,2610,4.882086167800454
2258162,3,B0008ENI20,"While this film had a choppy approach to the plot that was at times perplexing, I was happy to see Colin Firth get a chance to exhibit his considerable range (and some sexy scruff--sorry can't help it!)in his role as a disturbed and grieving widower (only he could make mental instability look attractive, at least, physically). To me this film was surprisingly scary with a creepy feel throughout. At times it felt a bit like Hitchcock, which it seems was intentional. Colin makes a successful departure from his popular romantic comedy roles in a portrayal that was quite moving as well as disturbing. It is definitely for the more intrepid fans of Colin Firth who want a chance to see this brilliant character actor exhibit his awesome talent, which is readily apparent despite a somewhat confusing plot. This film leaves you with more questions than answers but if you like being left with something to work out for yourself, Trauma gives you plenty of opportunity.",1119225600,3,969,4.878787878787879
2258163,2,B0008ENI20,"To the other reviewer: You can say a lot about this movie - you can say it was creepy, you can say you liked it, you can say it was a good mystery, but you CANNOT say it was suspenseful. This movie is like watching paint dry! A boring, overdone plot. The movie wasn't even a mystery because in the first 30 minutes of the film the killer is revealed and you know exactly who it is. Basically, they show the killer a couple times standing in the distance with a winter coat on. One of the times they show the killer, the camera man gets a little too close (either on purpose, or by sheer stupidity) and you can see the persons mouth, chin, nose, cheeks, and at least 65% of his face. Without me spoiling it for those that haven't seen this movie yet, lets just say you would have to be as thick as cement not to know who the killer is.  So where is the mystery your referring to? What movie did you watch? Jigsaw puzzle? Are you that easily confused?

  My verdict: a slow, boring, failed attempt at a ""who did it?"" plot. Being a horror fan, I must add there is minimal killing in this movie (especially for their being a ""killer running around"" type of movie). It has one good scene in the whole movie, very little gore, and lack of character development of all other actors/actresses other than the main character. I gave it an extra star for the ending sequence",1119139200,2,1363,4.250965250965251
2258164,4,B0008ENI20,"Having been impressed by Colin Firth in movies like The English Patient, B.J. Diaries, and Girl With A Pearl Earring, I was very eager to see this film last year at the Toronto International Film Festival, especially knowing he was going to make an appearance on stage after the showing of the film. Having read nothing about this movie, I was expecting to see a story about a traumatized man dealing with grief and emotional/spiritual recovery. I was expecting to see something like Ralph Fiennes' Spider. I was wrong, it turned out to be more like Christian Bale's The Machinist.

This movie is about a man dealing with the aftermath of a severe car accident which he believed had taken the life of his beloved wife(played by a Black British actress I have not seen before), and his near fatal injury kept him bed ridden in the hospital for many days. During that time, he had nightmares and hallucinations that might have been the post impact of the traumatic event. Then enter Mena Suvari, who eventually gets involved with Firth romantically. She's infatuated with him, but he's too messed up and removed from his reality, that he ended up killing her by putting a poisonous spider into her mouth. That was the most disturbing scene in this film. I really didn't see that one coming, since there had been so much sexual energy between them. The remain of the film is rather like a jigsaw puzzle, which was totally confusing to follow.

This is a very unusual film, and it's not a conventional thriller. It's creepy, suspenseful, and the mysterious leading role portrayed by Colin Firth is quite captivating. Mena Suvari was rather underused in this film. For some reason, I couldn't help wonder why she chose a role that calls for her to have a thing for an older man like she did in American Beauty.",1118707200,5,1805,4.690851735015773

2258166,1,B0008ENI20,"I've always admired Colin Firth, he is sexy, handsome, British.... but this film was a stinker. I thought I was suffering from Trauma just trying to understand the bloody thing!  I can generally follow ""flash-backs"" can't say that I was keeping up in this program. Since the movie was slow, not keeping up with those flashbacks was very telling.  Not such a good movie, in my opinion.",1364342400,,384,4.7164179104477615

2258168,5,B0008ENI20,"I give the film itself 5 stars, but the DVD maybe 2.  Sadly the DVD has no extras.  No director's comments.  No subtitles, except in Spanish. (You can get English closed captions, if you do not use HDMI connections to your DVD player to view the film.  While the film is not in HD this way, I highly recommend doing this).

Now.  To the movie itself.  I found it an absorbing puzzle and it took me at least 2 viewings to figure out, in my mind, what was going on with Ben (Colin Firth), the main character.  There are multiple clues to figuring out exactly what this ""through a glass darkly"" story is really about, but I am one who needed a second viewing to figure things out.  I feel saying more is spoiling it, but I was quite taken in by it and by Firth's shattering performance.  If you want a movie to rely on a central character, he is the man for the job, no question.  He fully plays against type here.  No shades of the romantic hero he often portrays.  If you are a Colin Firth fan, for that reason alone, it is worth a look.

I fully enjoy puzzle movies and this one is right at the top for me.",1353542400,,1106,4.107476635514018
2258169,1,B0008ENI20,"I understand that there are a few movies you have to view more than once to 'get it'.... but... those movies make it enticing. This one didn't. I honestly don't want to go through it again. The only conclusions I can come to is that either the character Colin Firth plays is truly mentally sick and we're just watching his life. Or, the important parts of the film ended up on the cutting room floor. There are themes in the movie, like the dead singer who he was obsessed with, that come to no conclusion or explanation... and how the name 'Charlotte' really does impact him is left pretty much up to anyone's guess. And the ants??? what's with the ants???
When I'm watching a movie I want to watch a story. Stories have beginnings, middles and ends. The ending should draw the activity to a conclusion. This doesn't happen here. If you have nothing else to watch... this might fit the bill.",1328745600,,892,4.478527607361963

Not quite sure if all of the lead character's marbles had rolled to one side before the ""Trauma"" but it seems he was always a few cards short of the proverbial deck. I wanted to root for him but was increasingly suspicious of his sanity and virtue. A bit confusing as to what was real and unreal even at the end. Interesting to see a darker side in Firth's acting abilities. The fact that you're not sure of his character is a testament to his abilities and his facial expression at the end is creepy and suitably demented.",1301270400,2,564,4.380952380952381

(4.6) Trauma (UK-2004) - Colin Firth/Neva Suvari/Naomie Harris",1297900800,3,471,4.8625
2258172,2,B0008ENI20,"Trauma (Marc Evans, 2004)

I saw My Little Eye last year and wasn't quite sure what to make of it. Now I've seen Evans' follow-up, Trauma, another venture into the psychological-thriller realm with a much bigger cast, and my estimation of My Little Eye has gone down a notch with regards to the ability of those involved in its making, but compared to this mess, it's brilliant.

Ben (Colin Firth) awakens from a coma after a car accident in which his wife (Naomie Harris) was killed. He tries to go on with his life, going back to work with his partner Tommy (Sons of Anarchy's Tommy Flanagan) and trying to figure out whether the cute blonde down the hall, Charlotte (American Beauty's Mena Suvari), is really as interested in him as he thinks she is. Problem is he can't quite leave the past entirely behind. You see, Ben's wife was a backup dancer for a very popular singer who's been missing since just before the car accident, and both the paparazzi and the police are very interested in Ben. And they don't believe him when he tells them he doesn't remember much before the accident. But the real bombshell comes when a hint is dropped that perhaps Ben's wife didn't die in the car accident at all, sending him on a fervent, out-of-control search for the truth.

The movie has drawn a lot of comparisons to Mulholland Dr., and not without cause, but I was put more in mind of Pal Sletaune's excellent, and not nearly seen enough, thriller Naboer. Which is far better put together and makes a whole lot more sense, but all three movies have a good deal in common. Mulholland Dr. made my hundred best movies of the decade list, and Naboer ended up being the last film I cut, so you can certainly infer (correctly) that I'm a big fan of movies where you're not exactly sure what's going on. But Evans made a complete muddle of this from the get-go, and he's not a director of the caliber of Lynch (back when his movies still made sense, anyway) or Sletaune. I'm a huge fan of Tommy Flanagan's, and I usually find Firth and Harris enjoyable, but they all feel wooden here. It doesn't help that Evans is obviously linked to the whole mumblecore thing; one of the most common complaints you'll see about the film on its IMDB board is that you can't understand what Colin Firth is saying half the time (and not because of his accent). And that's from people who saw it in a theater; given the usual quality of vocal transfer to DVD, what I saw was damn near unintelligible all the way through. As well, where Lynch's film takes on the confusion by making the whole thing dreamlike, and Sletaune's by making his film from the gritty-realism angle, Evans can't seem to decide on one approach, and flips back and forth between the two. (This approach was actually done to excellent effect in a Jude Law film called The Wisdom of Crocodiles back in the nineties.) Evans also goes for the ambiguous ending, but his desire to actually explain stuff hamstrings the ambiguity, leaving the viewer with more of a ""what's going on?"" sense at the end than a burning desire to discuss it (a la Mulholland Dr.).

It could have been a good movie, maybe even a great one. Instead, it feels like a pothole. * ",1268697600,2,3192,4.515570934256055
2258173,1,B0008ENI20,"Ben (Colin Firth) was in a bad car accident that killed his wife.  As the story opens he's in the hospital, coming out of a coma.  He goes back to his creepy apartment building where he is the only resident.  He cannot come to terms with his wife's death and hallucinates about her constantly.  To make things worse, he finds himself the prime suspect in the brutal murder of a famous rock singer.

Yikes.  This is a bad movie.  It attempts to be an art film delving into the mind of a mentally ill man, but falls completely flat and is just one long, confusing, and very unpleasant movie.  We never know if what we are seeing is real or imagined; it's too hard to follow and totally repellent.  Firth does the best he can with the terrible script but I didn't like or care about his character at all.  If you're afraid of creepy crawly creatures, this is not the movie for you; the same goes if you're looking for Firth to be a debonair heartthrob.

2258175,1,B0008ENI20,"I don't want to spend too much time describing this DVD because it is really a boring and uneventful movie that just doesn't get any better with the passage of time (viewing it more than once).  I really tried to watch this movie but could never finish it both times that I had given it a 2nd chance.  It was so slow and boring and, also irksome was the fact that the traumatized patient of the car accident and the events that followed at times seem absolutely unconnected to the basic plot of the movie.  The delusional scenes are, at least for my taste, far too many and make the film confusing to follow.
The main actor was doing a good job, but couldn't rescue the movie.  I really disliked this movie, most of all because of its immensely slow pace. I hate DVDs like that.  At times the movie really felt like it was not just tiresomely dragging on but as if it had actually come to some sort of stand still juncture that didn't seem to end.

This is an extremely exciting, thrilling, and absorbing movie. Colin Firth and the BBC at there best. If you love watching BBC America Crime Trillers you will love this.
I was worried about the customer reviews for this movie.

And after watching Where the truth Lies I was a bit worried that maybe Colin Firth did some stinker movie scripts. I must say I am a Colin Firth fan in his comedy roles and the advocate and his musicals. I am glad to see that he can pick such fabulous scripts and really make them seem convincing and entertaining.",1185408000,2,707,4.237037037037037

for awhile now.  Colin Firth plays a guy who is deranged and likes bugs a lot.  The bugs run across the screen.  He occasionally shows up at a construction job and manages to keep it the whole time.

Oh yeah, and a pop singer died around the same time his wife died in a ""car crash"" while he was driving.

He talks to himself and believes he's undergoing therapy.  Any idiot can tell right from the outset that there is no therapist.  He meets a ""medium""/empath who unbelievably gets personally involved with him; the big shocker of the movie is when he shoves a spider down her throat.  All I could think of during the scene was why an actress this talented and attractive was in such a dismal movie.

Aimless, meandering scenes of him walking in London and being interrogated by detectives who know how screwed up he is and don't do anything about it until he finally shows them.  The movie is clearly meant to be depressing, and it is, but not for the reasons the director wanted it to be.

The ending makes no sense.  At all.  And if it does in some way, I wouldn't care enough to go back and figure it out.",1172448000,3,1186,4.3031674208144794
2258179,2,B0008ENI20,"Apart from Colin Firth's intense portrayal of the main character, this movie is really lacking any substance. At times it seems like it makes sense and there is a thin plot to grasp at, but then that too slips away.

As with most psychological thrillers, things are not what they seem. There are several twists in the plot, but most of them happen in the last 20 minutes of the movie, and ultimately the viewer is left completely confused, rather than shocked and intrigued.

Colin Firth's character wakes up from a week-long coma after a car accident in which he believes that his girlfriend died. He meets Mena Suvari, who helps him cope with his ""trauma"", and is for some reason attracted to him despite his erratic mannerisms and strange habits.

The filmmaking is also a little strange with quite a few slow-motion-esque shots. I wish I knew a better way to describe them. Strange shots where maybe the filmmaker is only showing every 5th frame, but in slow motion. It's distracting and not very aesthetically pleasing. There is, however, a very creepy dream sequence in the middle of the film that defintiely pays off.

2258181,3,B0008ENI20,"Actor Colin Firth delivers a haunting performance here as a moody loner who may be someone getting over the effects of an accident - or who may be someone more fundamentally, more dangerously troubled. The movie, with its sort of fractured chronology and cutaways, kept me guessing - until the memorable ending.

The atmospherics are good, with the blue/gray tones of these parts of London reflecting the main character's watery, submerged mental state. As an American, it took me a while to get used to the cadences of the English actors, in their brief colloquial exchanges. So I turned on the English subtitles while I was watching the DVD at home. Having to read subtitles may have distracted from the suspense a little.

With or without subtitles though, the film gave me a real understanding of how it might feel to be in that sort of dissociated mental state. It was engrossing. It put me in the main character's shoes as he walked through his days, not knowing himself - whether he's good - or evil.",1155859200,,1007,4.715909090909091
2258182,2,B0008ENI20,"Nothing is wrong with `Trauma' as far as the actors and technical aspects are concerned. Colin Firth shows compelling acting as the suffering protagonist who survived a car accident, and John Mathieson's noir-ish cinematography is simply riveting. Except that, however, `Trauma' is likely to leave most audiences only puzzled and unsatisfied after the end credits roll. As for the film itself, it goes on and on without giving me during its course any sense of mystery, drama, character study, or whatever that is worth spending my time.

Colin Firth plays Ben, who wakes up from a coma that lasted one week after his car crash that killed his wife Elisa (Naomie Harris, '28 Days Later'). In spite of the constant therapy and the presence of a lovely girl named Charlotte (Mena Suvari), Ben's mental condition gets worse and worse, and he begins to suspect that what he sees and remembers does not necessarily reflect the reality that everyone else shares. In addition to the premise that is no longer original, the film introduces a murder case of internationally famous actress (or singer ... sorry I forgot which) that does not convince me at all. And the most surprising thing is, Ben might be the prime suspect of the murder! But how? and why?

The script is laden with so many bits that do not simply gel - beside the things I pointed out above, Ben must meet a seer (played by Brenda Fricker) who says something very predictable, and his estranged sister who is just forgettable. There are also big red ants crawling all over, paintings that imply nothing special, and the CCTV surveillance images that only remind that the film is set in UK. All these gimmicks are used in the short films directed by film school students. The difference is, probably they know what they are doing better.

I simply detest the ending that only wants to be shocking (which it is not), and sincerely wish that Mena Suvari find a new agent who can help her out of the string of bad career choices that are getting more and more serious damages to her career these days.",1154995200,7,2057,4.708333333333333

The plot is a little muddled and one has to see this rather dull film twice to completely follow the thread of it. Staying awake the first time around can be a bit of a challenge, as ""Trauma"" is full of scenes of Ben as he meanders about in a delusional daze. Jobless and looking like a vagrant, he shuffles through his clippings of the pop star, and fiddles around with his ants and spiders. ""Trauma"" is not an easy film to watch, not because it is all that disturbing, but because it is boring. A recent film that can be compared to it is ""The Machinist,"" which is far creepier and disquieting to view.

Colin Firth is excellent as the delusional Ben, as is Mena Suvari  as Charlotte, the gentle, trusting soul that befriends him. Other good actors in the cast include Tommy Flanagan (""Braveheart"") as Ben's buddy Tommy, and Brenda Fricker has a small part as a clairvoyant. Directed by Marc Evans, with some clever cinematography by John Mathiesen, no amount of spooky sounds in the soundtrack or mysterious elements can save this film and make it even mildly interesting.

2258189,2,B0008ENI20,"Trauma is a traumatic mess, where you're unable to hear the speaking parts because it's so low. The DVD itself is bad because unless you can read Spanish subtitles, you're out of luck hearing certain parts. Firth is good, but Suvari is as bland as cardboard.",1123804800,3,258,4.630434782608695
2258190,4,B0008ENI20,"I didn't have great expectations for this movie to be honest, it didn't sound that great, but it turned out to be a fairly well paced thriller. Colin Firth was really good in this, trying to get away from Mr. Darcy territory. Firth will need some help from Anthony Perkins ghost on that one. As far as pschological thrillers go this one is pretty solid. Give it a try, and to all you Mr. Darcy fanatics, c'mon give the guy a break, he can do other stuff. P.S. Colin wears a wet white shirt in this one too. Sorry just kidding.",1123286400,,526,4.217821782178218
2258191,5,B0008ENI20,"This movie is a very sad but compelling story of a man who is grief sticken by the loss of his wife, but at the same time wonders if he is the killer of a famous singer. This is a new roll for Colin Firth not the usual romantic comedy if that's what you like about Colin Firth I wouldn't recommend this film. His character, Ben,is on an emotinal rollercoaster looking for answers about his dead wife who he begins to believe is not dead. I thought it was an awesome movie, great acting all around!",1121644800,2,497,4.1875
2258192,4,B0008ENI20,"I can't even look at the cover of the dvd, ew.  I have watched this movie 2 times and am not so sure I understand it quite yet.  Oh well, I guess I'll have to watch Colin Firth all over again, tough job....NOT!",1121126400,2,210,3.86046511627907
2258193,3,B0008ENI20,"This movie is bizarre to say the very least. I did not find it to be boring but it is a little hard to follow at times. It is  weird and not for anyone who likes their movies to have a definative ending. This movie offers no answers and leaves the viewer to desphifer what they saw and make their own decisions on what actually happened.

The acting is very good and the movie is made even more tolerable with the casting of GORGEOUS, FLAWLESS Colin Firth as the supposed psycho. No one truly ever made mental instability so appealing.

All in all, it is an acquired taste meant for those who favor their movies to go deep into the mind and make you think.",1119830400,6,656,4.232
2258194,3,B0008ENI20,"Trauma is a movie that my friend calls 'trailer movies'. In so much as it was like watching an hour-and-a-half trailer. And the dvd isn't worth your while if your a lover of special features.

The story is pretty nifty in theory, but less so in application. The main character, Ben (Colin Firth) Takes a blow to the head in a crash that kills his wife. He awakes in the hospital to his wife being dead. He begins to grieve, but at the same time he finds himself obsessed with and suspected for the murder of a popstar. How 'Perfect Blue' of them... After a while a mysterious turn of events unfold, as he see's his wife in several places, and thinks she may not have died. With his head injury, is he really seeing things, or blocking out what really happened?

The story is also the movies shortcoming. In his search for truth, Ben wanders around, looking distraught. Very british, eh?

But the story never really speeds up or even ties up loose ends. I suppose the disrector wanted us to draw our own conclusions, and I have mine, but my parents were confused to point of arguing with me about what it meant. So, if YOU'RE slow or don't like slow (and confusing) movies, stray away from Trauma.

Onto the disc:

The picture quality was subpar at best. It was combination of british television (think mr. bean or any brit sitcom) and murky darks. The night scenes in his house are blue like underworld, and the exterior night scenes are red with street lights.

The sound quality is mediocre at best. The music sometimes drowns out the vocals, and other times the music nowhere to be found. The dialog is generaly low and I had to watch it with subtitles. Which is the perfect way to transition into:

Special Features! That's right, features, as in two. Trauma features a spanish language track, and a host of trailers from the movie company (five including it's own...) and that's it. Nothing. In conclusion, this disc lost a star for special features, a half for the quality and one for poor story/directing. So... two and a half stars over all, with a possible half for good acting on Firth and Suvari's part.",1119744000,5,2114,4.532808398950131
8055813,3,B0008ENI20,"Okay, as I've mentioned previously in another review,  for the past several months I've been on a ""Firth-frenzy."" Since October of 2017 I've been scouring the net for any and all things Firth...movie-wise that is.

So from my list of Colin movies to check out, this somewhat obscure  one pops up AND it can be seen online at Amazon!!! I'm excited by this because as those of us on a ""Firth-frenzy"" know, not all his movies  (good and bad) are available online or are even still in print.  Bummer.

Right then, on to this movie. This is a psychological thriller.  I like those.  I like Colin Firth. He's not in his typical handsome, clean-cut role here. He's a mess! Still good to look at, just a bit of a tormented mess. I'm not going to say it's a totally bad movie as Colin is quite believable in his portrayal of an extremely disturbed individual. I think it's the way the story is told. It's not a straight line, but jagged and irregular.

With these types of movies focus is key.  I watched it about 3 times to see if I could get a better understanding, but from every angle I came up short.  I think I  got it, but still there's questions. Bottom line he's a guy with serious issues and very out of touch with reality.

A word of warning to those with a fear of spiders or crawly things...they're all here. I actually think now that the spider obsession his character has is a metaphor of his life/personality. Like a sticky web spun out of control and consuming everything it comes in contact with.

The movie's  pace moves in kind of the same way...slow and creeping until you're as ""bugged out"" as the main character.

Didn't expect that part where he's in his therapy session...wow! I think that's where my understanding kicked in.

Not his best, but not his worse either.",1521763200,,1782,4.46749226006192
