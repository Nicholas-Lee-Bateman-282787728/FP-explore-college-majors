2111424,4,B0002OXVF0,"What a thrill this DVD boxset is!  EIGHTEEN rarely-seen episodes from the Hartnell and Troughton eras of Doctor Who, contained on three DVDs.  These episodes have never been aired on US television.  The sad reality about Doctor Who, is that a fair number of the earliest episodes of the program have not survived, so we are left with certain early stories which only have the occasional episode in existence.

As for the goodies inside:

THE CRUSADE 1 & 3 - A historical story in which the Doctor, Ian, Barbara and Vicki encounter the era of King Richard the Lionhearted, (played by Julian Glover), and his sister Joanna (played by Jean Marsh). A four-part story originally, the second and fourth parts are included on the DVD in audio-only format, so you can experience the complete story as much as is humanly possible. Also, as a bonus, there is a commentary track for the third episode.

THE DALEKS' MASTER PLAN 2, 5 & 10 - These three episodes are all that remain from this epic 12-part adventure, (and in fact the second episode was only just discovered at the beginning of 2004, and has never been seen anywhere since its original transmission in 1965!) This story features the Doctor and his companion Steven, with seldom seen companions Katarina and Sara Kingdom. This story also features the first appearance of Nicholas Courtney, who would gain fame later in the program as the Brigadier. Plus, it has Daleks! Episode 2 also features a commentary track.

THE CELESTIAL TOYMAKER 4 - The final part of a 4-part adventure, featuring the Doctor, Steven and Dodo playing a deadly game against the Celestial Toymaker, (played by Michael Gough, perhaps better known in this day and age as Alfred the Butler in the Batman movies of the 1990's). Great fun this one is.

THE UNDERWATER MENACE 3 - Originally a four-part story, only the third part exists, but it does provide the earliest existing episode to feature Patrick Troughton's unique take on the Doctor, accompanied by his companions Ben, Polly and Jamie. The episode is rather bizarre, featuring an adventure in Atlantis with fish-people and a mad scientist, but it is unlike anything else ever seen in the series.

THE MOONBASE 2 & 4 - Enter the Cybermen for this adventure, in only their second appearance on Doctor Who. This time the action takes place on the moon itself, and as an added bonus, the two missing episodes (1 & 3) are included in audio-only format, so one can follow the entire story. Find out how Polly's tea-making skills save the day!

THE FACELESS ONES 1 & 3 - Two existing episodes from the six-parter in which chameleon-like aliens are hijacking airline passengers for their own nefarious plot. Features location footage at Gatwick Airport in London, and is also the last story to feature Ben and Polly as the Doctor's companions.

EVIL OF THE DALEKS 2 - The final appearance of the Daleks in the 1960's, this existing episode from the 7-parter, offers a unique look at a story many consider to be one of the all-time classics. Also, features the debut of Victoria. Commentary track is available for this episode.

THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMEN 2 - The Doctor, Jamie and Victoria encounter the deadly Yeti in the Himalayans in this surviving episode from the 6-parter. This episode also has an optional commentary track.

THE ENEMY OF THE WORLD 3 - A taste of espionage in this thriller, in which Patrick Troughton doubles as the villanous Salamander. The only surviving episode from the 6-parter.

THE WEB OF FEAR 1 - The Yeti return, this time in the Underground System of a deserted London. This is the existing first part of the 6-part story. There is an optional commentary track for this episode.

THE WHEEL IN SPACE 3 & 6 - The Cybermen return in this adventure set on a space station. Zoe makes her first appearance in the series, and episode 6 features an optional commentary. Originally a six-part story.

THE SPACE PIRATES 2 - This sole survivor of the six-part story puts the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe in the midst of a grand space adventure.

As if these 18 episodes weren't enough, also included are an insane number of clips from other 1960's Doctor Who adventures, plus a meaty documentary about The Missing Years.

Granted, these odds and ends may not be for everyone, but they are a unique collection of episodes that are quite rare, and they have all been cleaned up and have never looked better. A worthwhile investment for any Doctor Who fan.",1090713600,243,4437,4.755208333333333
2111425,4,B0002OXVF0,"This release contains six episodes of early Doctor Who, but unlike practically every other release, these are assorted episodes from a variety of stories.  The sad fact is that not every episode of the series survived to the present day.  Many of the earliest were destroyed, but fortunately, not all of them.  As a result, this collection doesn't really contain a complete story, but what it does offer, is a fascinating look at what exists from these incomplete stories.  The other postitive thing is that these episodes have never been aired on US television!

Great fun this one is.

As if that wasn't enough, the DVD release also features a variety of surviving clips from various other Hartnell stories.

This collection is a real treasure!  To be honest, it may not be the best purchase for someone who is just getting into Doctor Who, as these aren't complete stories, but then again, they do offer an appealling assortment of goodies from three very different early stories.  As sad as it is that there are episodes missing from the early days of Doctor Who, it is gratifying that these gems to exist to give you a taste of the wonders they were creating for this unique series.

One final note - if you think you might be at all interested in this, consider buying the Troughton set too, which contains a further 12 episodes from that era!",1090713600,66,2694,4.728051391862955
2111426,4,B0002OXVF0,"This set will contain parts of Doctor Who stories where half or more of the episodes are missing."". It does contain the newly discovered second episode of ""The Daleks Masterplan. There are also plenty of extra features besides the odd episodes. I would not recommend this set to casual Doctor Who viewers. This is for the Doctor Who fan who eventually wants to collect every existing episode of the show on DVD",1090454400,10,410,4.708333333333333
2111457,5,B0002OXVF0,"This collection of circa 2010-ish surviving 1st & 2nd Doctor (Pat Troughton & Wm. Hartnell) episodes is, as of now, the ""Relics"" album of Classic Doctor Who. Like that band Roger Waters used to be in, it's the ""Syd Barrett"" era for The Doctor, and what you have here is some classic singles (episodes that is) and sample tracks-I mean episodes!-from some early stories that, well, as of the past year or thereabouts you now CAN get the complete story, though probably in restored form. So like ""Relics"", this is a GREAT introduction to ""Syd Barrett,"" um, I mean Troughton (and Hartnell) era Doctor Who.
Stories sampled here are:
#14, The Crusade, both surviving episodes AND sound recordings of the 2 still missing episodes.
#18 (with the bonus material) Galaxy 4, 2 lengthy clips of 2 episodes -- a semi-restored 3 part version is part of the Bonus Material on The Aztecs, so IF you want to get the rest of it, The Aztecs (story 6) is a 2 for 1 bargain there.
#21, The Daleks' Master Plan, the 3 surviving singles of the dozen episodes THERE,
#24, The Celestial Toymaker, 4th & surviving episode of the 4 total,
and short clips from The Savages and The Smugglers in with the bonus material
A longer clip or 2 from #30, The Power Of The Daleks, and a short one from #31, The Highlanders in with the Bonus Material again, and then we get full on into the Patrick Troughton era with:
#32, The Underwater Menace, Episode 3 only BUT: after the discovery of Episode 2, they just did restorations of #1 & 4 and now this story is available to buy IF you want to see more of this story
#33, The Moonbase, similarly to The Crusade the 2 surviving episodes and audio only for the 2 missing are included here, this one was previously restored a while back, so it's an ""album"" you can get if it's to your liking
Clips from #34 The Macra Terror in with the Bonus Material, then some more ""tracks""
#35, The Faceless Ones, the two surviving episodes of this 6-parter,
#36, The Evil of The Daleks, the surviving Episode 2 of this 7-parter and with the Bonus Material some out-takey stuff from what looks to be Episode 7
#38, The Abominable Snowmen. Episode 2 from this 6-parter
#40, The Enemy of the World, Episode 3 and since this release ALL THE REMAINING EPISODES have turned up so THIS ""Lost"" story is now avaialble in full
#41, The Web Of Fear, Episode 1 and ditto regarding Found Episodes here but in the re-released complete story the still-missing Episode 3 was done as a telesnap restoration
Some out-takey stuff and clips from #42, Fury From The Deep
# 43, The Wheel In Space, surviving episodes 3 & 6 from this 6-parter
and lastly,
# 49, the surviving Episode 2 of the 6-part The Space Pirates.

So this is a way to get sort of a look into 1st/2nd Doctor episodes without having to play DVD Russian Roulette to see if either Wm. Hartnell's 1st Doctor or Pat Troughton's 2nd Doctor and their b/w stories are your cup of tea. (Because SOME of the surviving stories really are for the fanatical fans and completists only...)
In short -- like ""Relics"", a good buy for a sampler of ""The REALLY Old Stuff!""",1480896000,5,3095,4.477876106194691

2111463,3,B0002OXVF0,I liked it for filing in some of the blanks from the missing episodes.  I can't help thinking that if they have the original sound tracks why can't they do some good animation to show these in full again?  Not the cheesy stuff you can find on Youtube but some first rate animation.  Having complete episodes would be great but this was helpful in filling in some of the early missing episodes.,1468800000,,393,4.430555555555555
2111464,4,B0002OXVF0,"This set is a rare treat for any Dr Who fan.  However, I would recommend purchasing and listening to ""Dr Who: The Lost TV Episodes"" soundtrack recordings (collections one and two) before viewing this set. The audiobooks may be of great help in understanding the stories and filling in the gaps.  The stories are all available on the CD's, and they have linking narration. This ""Lost in Time"" DVD set is a unique experience. The video portions of the episodes are rarely seen and although they are only in fragments, they should be of great interest to any Dr. Who fan.  I kind of wish the ""audio only"" selections on this DVD would have something to watch (even accompanying telesnaps or artwork) instead of only listening material for your television set.  Otherwise, this is a great way to experience the surviving remnants of a lost era.",1467590400,3,839,4.726027397260274

In any event, the Hartnell DVD includes ""The Lion""(video is available for only two episodes-the other two are available as audio only), three episodes of ""the Dalek's Master Plan""(you get to find out what happened to ""the time meddler"" from the serial of that name in one of the episodes) and one episode of ""the celestial toymaker"".  Additionally, there are partial episodes and outtakes from several other lost serials.  The Patrick Troughton DVDs have episodes from several other serials.  The good news is that four of these serials have subsequently  been released as complete serials, two with animated episodes replacing the ones for which the audio is available and the video is lost, one where photos from the missing episode are projected while the audio is played in the one missing episode(which I personally liked better than the animation) and one where the entire series has been found(In a West African TV station if I am correctly informed).  As for the others, enjoy the partial serials available on this DVD.  Maybe some day they will be reconstructed as well.
Again, Dr. Who fans will love this look into the episodes from the early years of Dr Who that were lost through the blithering incompetence of some BBC execs",1463702400,4,1375,4.7280334728033475

2111492,5,B0002OXVF0,"All Doctor Who fans will get mixed feelings over the Lost In Time compilation. It's great seeing all the remaining episodes but it's sad knowing that this is likely all that remains of these great stories. There have been a few exceptions to sadness of course such as the finding of all the episodes of The Enemy Of The World after this DVD was released.

There are 18 full episodes on this DVD spanning the William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton eras. There are also numerous clips of remaining footage (quality varies on these) of other lost stories as well as some 8mm movies of parts of the stories. A couple stories also have audio only of the missing episodes. There is a rather decent documentary concerning the missing episodes as well.

This is a great addition to any Doctor Who classic DVD collection as it helps fill in some of the gaps.",1455062400,,849,4.578947368421052

2111496,5,B0002OXVF0,"As the years go by the chances of finding any more missing episodes, let alone series, becomes more remote. All the better, then, to cherish the snippets found on this fantastic collection. Troughton and Hartnell are quite the contrast in Doctors and it is a tribute to these fine actors and the writers as well as often superb supporting casts, that the early series of Dr Who remain eminently watchable. A bit slow moving at times, but that can be overlooked when the sheer variety and brilliance of the stories and characterisation is consistently strong.

An enduring element of the early episodes is that the audience is never condescended to and as an adult looking back it is great to see the integrity of the show maintained throughout. These episodes remind us of the depth and breadth of this 'children's show' and what we have lost when the original programs were destroyed. However frustrating it is to see only bits and pieces remaining, this DVD set is wonderful.",1441497600,,977,4.815476190476191
2111507,5,B0002OXVF0,"...to the short-sighted, penny-pinching idiocy which prompted the BBC to wipe video tapes of early Doctor Who episodes.  This is a collection of the fragmentary survivors of this purge.  From 2 Episodes of ""The Crusaders"" with Susan, Barbara, and Ian, to three episodes from ""The Dalek's Master Plan"", with ill-fated companions Katrina and Sara Kingdom, to an early Robert Holmes-penned tale""The Space Pirates"". Overall, the set gives a good overview of the show's early years with William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton interpreting the Doctor in their own ways.  And while ""Enemy of the World"" and ""Web of Fear"" have been restored somewhat and now available on DVD (Episode 3 of ""Web of Fear"" using the imperfect, but tolerable TeleSnaps system), one cannot watch the three ""Dalek's Master Plan"" Episodes and mourn for the missing eight parts.",1441411200,,845,5.198529411764706

2111536,5,B0002OXVF0,"Most sources will correctly tell you that the reason why so many Doctor Who episodes from the 1960s are missing (as is also the reason for much British Television from that era) was due to a few factors. Labor unions in the UK were concerned that with the BBC holding previously aired programs on tape, they were expecting the BBC at some point to stop requiring new material because the old shows would somehow end up being re-aired continually and actors ending up without any work. There was also the fact that after these shows ran for the number of times the BBC had the rights, aside from striking film copies to sell to overseas broadcasters, it was viewed that there was no other commercial value to the episodes (no home video market yet) and the magnetic tapes holding these programs were expensive to obtain and store in the 1960s. So unless a story was sold abroad, the tapes were erased and re-used and the episodes lost. But even then the BBC had no preservation policy for the film copies either, and with TV adding color, it was also viewed that the black and white programs would never be of any further interest. Ie why watch black and white programs when color was possible. So the BBC gave orders to simply throw away the film copies. Even overseas broadcasters were told to throw away or destroy their copies if they weren't sending them on to the next broadcaster who signed up to air the material. Thankfully in some cases, precious episodes have been saved from oblivion by sharp-eyed fans who recognized the name on the film cans or the simple act of being stored and forgotten about.

All television programs should be considered cultural artifacts, and especially so from the early days of TV broadcasting. It's only after we realize what is lost do we find out how precious it is, and especially so with Doctor Who. Thankfully, from the Jon Pertwee era and on all episodes exist.",1410825600,,1907,4.6420118343195265

2111568,5,B0002OXVF0,"As a disclaimer I have only seen the video from part of this product. I bought it as a Christmas present for my daughter-in-law, and we watched the shows on video from the first DVD as a family.

First, I thought the video was of surprising good quality for TV shows of that age where the preservation of the video has not been a priority. Interestingly, there are some shows for which the video does not survive, and they have included the audio only. You are not really seeing complete stories here from episodes that tied together to make an entire story arc, because in most cases not enough episodes have been recovered to provide the complete story arc. But they have provided what they could find.

For that reason this product is more to satisfy the curiosity of what early Dr. Who shows were like, and it does a fine job of that. My daughter-in-law was delighted with the gift just because it affords her that opportunity, as she has been a dedicated Dr Who fan for a long time, but the years represented in this collection are from before when she started following the series.

Personally, I was surprised the extent to which all the actors on these early shows were ""playing it straight"". For no particularly good reason than a preconceived notion, I was expecting a lot of camp in these shows, and they were not campy at all.

Highly recommended for Dr. Who fans who would like to go back in time to see what the very first Dr. Who was like, and what the writing and production quality of early episodes presented.",1388361600,3,1527,4.501805054151625

2111600,4,B0002OXVF0,"William Hartnell is fast becoming one of my favourite incarnations of the famous Time Lord, The Doctor.  Since the 2005 revival of the Doctor Who television franchise, I have been following with bated breath the Saturday evening adventures of the 'Last Son of Galifrey'.  In my opinion, what has given Doctor Who it's longevity, is the idea of 'regeneration', in which The Doctor is able to change the form of his physical body upon death.  This was shown in the revival series with Ninth Doctor Christopher Eccleston regenerating into the Tenth Doctor, played by David Tennant and subsequently Matt Smith has taken the reigns as the Eleventh incarnation.
Upon my initial discovery of this wonderful television phenomenon, I decided to serve my curiosity of what has gone before by researching what is termed as 'Classic Who'.  I now believe I am quite well-versed with the adventures of the First Incarnation of the Doctor (played by William Hartnell) and his subsequent audio adventures, along with his male and female companions.  Unfortunately, there is a chunk of these serial adventures that are missing from the BBC Archives, following the 1970s/80s purging of back-dated media programs.  Over the years, there has been a constant search for these lost stories, and sometimes episodes are found and given back to the BBC.  These finds can range from a whole serial, individual episodes or a few very short clips, and it is a collection of these 'lost and found' episodes that are included on this DVD.
'The Crusade' was broadcast during Doctor Who's second season in March of 1965, and the serial concerned the historical events of the Third Crusade, with the regular Tardis crew in the company of King Richard the Lionheart, and the Saracen outlaws.  This historical serial was previously released on VHS alongside 'The Space Museum.  However, because only two out of four episodes presently survive in the BBC Archives (Episodes 1 & 3), an Audio CD was included with the linking soundtrack to episodes 2 & 4.  A special introduction and linking narration was specially made by William Russell in character as Ian Chesterson, and it is this release that is included on this DVD as the first 'lost' story, along with the linking soundtrack to the missing episodes in audio form.  This also includes an interesting optional audio commentary on Episode 3 with Julian Glover, who played Sir Richard and Gary Russell.
The second incomplete serial included is 'The Daleks' Master Plan' - of which only three out of twelve episodes have been found.  This serial is the most sought after and includes the first on-screen death of a companion, Katerina of Ancient Greece, alongside the appearance of Jean Marsh as would-be companion Sara Kingdom, who was also killed in this story.  It is inevitably fairly difficult to follow the events of this story with only three episodes to work with, so it is probably better to look up the initial preface of the serial first in order to grasp the overall plot.  The episodes themselves look fantastic and the BBC Restoration Team have, once again, done a brilliant job in cleaning up these forgotten gems.  Also included with this serial is another interesting, optional audio commentary on Episode 2, with Peter Purves and Kevin Stoney, who played Steven Taylor and Mavic Chen respectively, alongside set designer Raymond Cusick and moderator Gary Russell.
The third and final serial, 'The Celestial Toymaker', has just one episode out of four included (Episode 4), and this involves The Doctor, Steven and Dodo attempting to 'play' their way out of the realm of the Toymaker.  Again, it is better to know the overall preface of the story beforehand, but it is still an enjoyable lone episode, which leads directly into the the next complete serial, 'The Gunfighters' - recently released on DVD.
With a few extra surviving clips and extant footage of other missing serials of the William Hartnell era, this surmises the overall content of the DVD.  For some, it may be a little confusing and it is worth researching some background knowledge on the missing serials in order to place where you are in the continuum of the series.  Maybe, in the future, animation technology will allow for these lost stories to be 'found' again, but, for now, this is as far as we Whovians will get to experiencing the missing stories in visual format, having had their original television soundtracks released on Audio CD and download (which I definitely recommend exploring in order to bridge the gap between said lost/missing serials!).",1361491200,4,4563,4.989459815546772

This collection is for those over the top fans of classic Who that want anything they can get. To no fault to the person who gave me this wonderful holiday gift, I rather have full episodes either of videos the Doctor or audio versions of Dr Who stories in any of his incarnations. I know one of the recent Patrick Troughton DVD  videos has animation of the  Who episode  with the original soundtrack to complete the episode.

2111604,5,B0002OXVF0,"For fans of classic Dr Who this collection of rare episodes is a must.
I had seen most of them when they were screened in Australia way back in the 60s and 70s, and it brought back some great memories.
Early daleks, early cybermen - great stuff, even the yeti were there.
The special effects, although rather basic, were not too bad for the 1960s and the limited budget the BBC had to work with.
Definitely recommended - go back in time and enjoy the nostalgia of the early days of one of the greatest science fiction TV shows ever.",1349049600,,532,4.33
2111605,5,B0002OXVF0,"First things first for new Dr Who fans who may not know. Many of the initial episodes from the Hartnell/Troughton era were destroyed and never aired in the US. Many of the previous reviews have the details as to why this unfortunate situation occurred so I will not repeat.

Dr Who was a roughly 20-25min weeekly serial that aired on the BBC starting in 1963 (oddly, the first episode aired the day JFK was assasinated). Each full storyline contains anywhere from 4-12 episodes. Some of the episodes from these full storylines are intact while some unfortunately are missing. In other words, you have one or two surviving episodes and the rest of the episodes of the storyline are completely missing.

What this DVD compilation is, is a collection of the surviving episodes. There's an episode 3 for one storyline, and an episode 5 in another storyline. You're not getting complete storylines, just bits and pieces here and there.

Now there is audio for The Crusades and The Moonbase. but it's just audio. I say this because other ""Missing"" episodes I have bought in the past (THe Tenth Planet on VHS, The Ice Warriors, The Invasion) have had the original audio with telesnaps of the missing episode accompanied by either narration or subtitles. The VHS release of The Invasion originally had Nicholas Courtney giving brief summaries of the missing episodes in between the existing episodes. The DVD release of the Invasion provided the original audio occampanied by animation. I don't understand why this couldn't be done here. With the audio only, you get an idea of what might be happening (Ben, Polly, and Jaime jumping on the Moon in Episode 1 of the Moonbase) but you really don't have a clear understanding of what is going on. That's the only real disappointment with this set.

However, it should be noted that many fans have put up there own audio of missing episodes complete with animation, subtitles explaing what's going on in the background, telesnaps, etc on Youtube.

Still, I will enjoy watching this collection greatly and am happy with my purchase.",1328572800,2,2069,4.9

Story 21: The Dalek's Master Plan 11,14, and 19, original story from season 3, ep. 10-21.

Story 38: The Abominable Snowmen, season 5 5-10, and you have episode 6.

Story 41: The Web of Fear gives you the first episode out of a seven part story, originally season 5, ep. 23-28.

Story 43: The Wheel in Space (season 5, episodes 35-40) gives you episodes 3 & 6.

and Story 49: The Space Pirates gives you the second episode of a 6 part story from season 6, originally 29-34.",1313280000,18,1148,4.440191387559809

While the first and third episode are actually there, you still get at least the audio for the second and forth episodes--PLUS Ian Chesterton's recollections to help fill in some gaps if you want to skip the audio. That was kind of a kick to see him ""all grown up.""

It also has Story 21: The Dalek's Master Plan--which I was completely lost on. The original story from season 3 had been created using episodes 10-21. All you get here are 11,14, and 19. You know, coming in on the second episode wasn't so terrible, but then skipping two more and coming back in was horrible, and then going to the third to last--where The Monk somehow gets back in--was just too much. If they had provided audio--which I understand if it wasn't possible--or someone to fill in gaps like they had Ian do, I think it would have been more tolerable. But such as it is, it only frustrated me.

And then finally, they had one solitary episode from Story 24. It looked like it would have been a good one, but showing the last episode of a four episode story was rather pointless. Originally, it was a season 3 story containing episodes 30-33.",1313193600,,1210,4.46606334841629
2111622,5,B0002OXVF0,"Two hundred fifty-three episodes of Doctor Who were taped between 1963 and 1969. Most of these episodes were erased in the 1970s so that the BBC could reuse the valuable tape and because contracts with the artists and agreements with various unions limited the shows to an initial broadcast and one rerun. Before they were wiped, however, virtually all of these episodes were transferred to film for broadcast in overseas markets that still did not use videotape. Some of these film copies have been recovered, from far-flung television stations and enterprising film collectors, but 108 episodes remained missing as of the 2004 release of this set, with a decreasing likelihood any more will ever be found.

""Lost in Time"" is a collection of 18 rare episodes preserving what's left of many of the legendary ""lost"" stories from the William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton years. These include: three episodes from the 12-part ""Daleks' Master Plan,"" which featured the series debut of Nicholas Courtney, who would later play Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart; the only surviving episode of ""The Evil of the Daleks,"" which introduced Deborah Watling as Victoria; two episodes from ""The Wheel in Space,"" which introduced Wendy Padbury as Zoe; and single episodes from such classics as ""The Celestial Toymaker,"" ""The Underwater Menace,"" ""The Abominable Snowmen,"" ""The Enemy of the World"" and ""The Web of Fear."" The set also features extracts from programs that were copied for promotional purposes or clipped out by overseas censors for their violence.

Begin watching this set by inserting Disc 2 of the Patrick Troughton years and selecting the ""Missing Years"" documentary from the Special Features menu. This 1998 documentary, hosted by Frazer Hines and Deborah Watling, explains why so many episodes of Doctor Who (and countless other BBC programs) were junked and how they were later recovered--including two episodes from the basement of a Mormon church! The two parts of the set (one disc for William Hartnell, two for Patrick Troughton) are also sold separately, but you will miss out on this informative documentary if you purchase only the William Hartnell disc.",1310256000,3,2162,5.263768115942029

2111649,5,B0002OXVF0,"It should be known that this set is really only for fans of doctor who.  There are many lost episodes from the early years, during the tenure of the first two doctors.  This set includes all the surviving episodes, along with surviving clips, but there are not any complete stories here.  There are some that have a beginning with no ending, others with a middle and but no beginning or ending, some with a middle and a ending but no beginning.  There is nothing here that is complete.
But if you are a big fan of doctor who (like I am) then you will probably like this set anyhow because it does allow you to see at least a small part of these classic stories.  Besides, if you're very worried about not being able to enjoy the entire story thanks to the missing episodes, there are things you can do.
1. Go to the Loose Cannon website.  They create reconstructions of the lost episodes using the surviving audio (which exists for all the stories) and mixes it with still shots that survive from the episodes.  What you get is basically a slid show with the original audio playing over it.  Recently they have even started to include CGI animation to make the reconstructions more enjoyable.  They distribute the recons for free, but only on VHS due to copyright issues.  You need the Lost in Time set to go along with some of the reconstructions as they don't include the surviving episodes on the tapes.
2. Another solution is to purchase the CDs created by the BBC that use the surviving audio, along with linking narration to let the listener know what is happening during sections that aren't apparent in the audio track.
3. The last option you have is to go to the BBC website and check out the photonovels they have there, which are basically just surviving still shots with a short synopsis of what occurs in each of the episodes.

So there are ways the serious Doctor Who fan can enjoy these classic stories.  Personally, I don't see how any fan can not get the Lost in Time set.",1200441600,8,1989,4.479224376731302

2111651,5,B0002OXVF0,"Sadly, as any ""Doctor Who"" fan knows, the BBC trashed a lot of the 1st and 2nd Doctor episodes back in the 1970's. Their reasons were sound, but still lead to a painful result for those of us who like the show.

There is, sadly, no complete episode in this package. There's a couple complete STORIES, but they either have bridging materiel or they have the soundtrack but not the images (this is possible due to the fact that fans back in the day would record the audio to listen to later. As a result we have the soundtrack for every single episode, which is why ""The Invasion"" was possible).

But with the fragments here, there are some real gems, like ""The Crusade"" and ""The Enemy of the World"" (Salamander rocks!). With luck, the BBC will go through and do animated versions of some of these episodes, like they did with ""The Invasion"".

Many shows along with Doctor Who were discarded so what we have here is a collection of episodes to which the full story doesn't (currently anyway) exist in the BBC's vaults. All of the stories featured here have been novelised in books as well as cd audio releases taken from the original broadcasts and taped by fans with new narraration by former cast members.

2111654,1,B0002OXVF0,"My husband was VERY disapointed with this collection!  Sure there are lost episodes, but they jump around and the whole set of the series isn't there.

I too was very disappointed.",1172188800,3,180,4.774193548387097
2111655,5,B0002OXVF0,"Something about ""Doctor Who"" certainly inspires dedication in the show's fans. There is not really a single complete storyline in this whole DVD set, just scattered, random fragments of storylines. One or two episodes out of four or six, three episodes out of twelve--merely bits and pieces. And yet we find ourselves watching them with all the enthusiasm of a classical scholar who has come across some stray pages from the Library of Alexandria. Sure, it'd be nice to have the whole archive complete, but barring that, these fragmentary glimpses of the show in its formative years are a treasure.

Different folks will come to this with different preferences, of course. I myself was especially enthralled by the bits from ""The Moonbase"" and ""The Wheel in Space""--both for the vintage early appearances of the Cybermen and for the classic ""space age"" manner in which the future was envisioned. The long, fantastically involved bits from ""The Dalek's Masterplan"" were neat for similar reasons, though set in a much more distant future. As someone with an interest in Asian religions, I found the setting of ""The Abominable Snowmen"" in a Buddhist monastery to be particularly noteworthy. And in ""The Faceless Ones"" seeing the Tardis materialize on an airport landing strip (of all places) was priceless. These were some of the highlights for me, but the whole thing was enjoyable overall.

Of course, it must be said that this is enjoyment of a very masochistic sort. There you are, getting into the story, mesmerized by William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton's incredible performances, thrilled by the threats of enemies familiar and unfamiliar, following along as the plot thickens and the suspense quickens...right up until the episode's cliffhanger. And that's it. You'll never see what happens next. I found myself shouting in dismay almost every time, as if I didn't know this was inevitable from the start. But for diehard followers of the renegade Time Lord's saga, it's well worth it.",1170979200,9,1993,5.110429447852761

2111672,5,B0002OXVF0,"This set is a REVELATION!  It's indispensible.  A month ago I had never heard the name Patrick Troughton, and was only mildly familiar with three Doctor Whos from the BBC America broadcasts:  John Pertwee, Tom Baker (whom I liked a great deal), and that more lightweight Fifth one with blonde hair.  The trouble was that the broadcasts here in America were on at such varying hours that I don't think I ever saw a complete Doctor Who story, just scattered episodes.  I happened recently on some old VHS copies of several Tom Baker episodes, and was hooked.  But where were the ""complete 7th season"", ""complete 10th season"" collections in Circuit City (or on amazon.com)?  Instead, BBC had apparently decided to issue the storylines one by one, and about the only box set available when I was looking in earnest was this ""Lost in Time"" set, starring the First and Second Doctors.  I snatched it up (having enjoyed the replacement First Doctor in the VHS of ""The Five Doctors"" - the tired performance of that odd short Second Doctor who looked like Moe of the Three Stooges did not impress me much.)  When I happened on this DVD set, I watched the remaining William Hartnell episodes from otherwise lost storylines, and liked him well enough - a nice, crotchety elegance and intellect, at least when he wasn't blowing his lines and looking vaguely lost while the cameras rolled on around him.  OK, and I am glad to have made his acquaintance.  I bought the DVD set for the Hartnell episodes, but, as there were two other DVDs featuring this odd, unpromising Second Doctor fellow, I decided I'd suffer through those, at least so many as I could stand.  But a very strange thing happened while I did so -- sometime midway during the final episode of ""Moonbase"" from the first season (we have 2 of the 4 original episodes), I realized with a lightning bolt of joy that this guy might just have been as good as Tom Baker.  No - he was even better, unmistakeably better, I saw as I watched the ""Faceless Ones"" episodes and the others.  The point of absolute conviction was watching the few superb moments from the climax of that greatest of lost storylines, ""Fury of the Deep,"" with Patrick Troughton at his very peak, intense, brilliant, exciting beyond measure in the very highest expression of this art form -- the finest, and by a considerable margin, of all the Doctors, and that includes the great Tom Baker.  Patrick Troughton was the perfect Doctor Who.  Most unusually for me, I was heartsick about the terrible loss of the very best work of this fantastically gifted actor, and set about to listen to all the soundtracks I could find (while the Daleks at BBC destroyed the vast majority of Troughton's work as the Doctor, fans recorded the sound, at least, of the lost masterpieces, and BBC has atoned in some small measure for its abject stupidity and unforgiveable negligence by reissuing them.)  I also discovered the remaining off-the-air ""snaps"" taken by a photographer who used to sell the images to actors in the series.  (Why didn't anyone just film the episodes off the air, in kinescopes? But apparently no one did.)  It is possible, I discovered, to recreate some sense of just how great the Second Doctor consistently was, by hunting down the soundtracks (on CD, MP3, and downloads) of the first season, interspersing the remaining episodes lovingly restored on this glorious DVD set, and checking the photo ""snaps"" on the BBC website.  Having now lived through this first, great season in a week or so, I can report that the work, though a degree variable, was of the very highest quality, with Troughton and his supporting cast members, especially the actors portraying Jamie, Polly, and Victoria, reaching a peak never equalled, so far as I have seen, at any other time in the series.  Here is an informal rating (on a scale from 1 - 10) of Troughton's first series storylines (1966-67), not one of them surving in total on film, and many of them lost utterly:

Power of the Daleks - 10 (highlights include Daleks hilariously masquerading as ""servants"" -- ""shall I bring you more liquid?"" --while they wait for their power to be restored by a naive scientist - go grab the soundtrack!)

Highlanders - 9+ (no sci-fi, just an old-fashioned ""historic"" storyline, quite swashbuckling and marvelously spun)

Underwater Menace - 4 (not the best of the series - and those pathetic ""fish people"" in the surviving filmed episode, suspended by huge black wires;  Troughton's great, though)

Moonbase - 8 - good story line, marred a bit by cheesy special effects (paper Cyberman spaceships, e.g.) - perhaps sometimes it's better to listen to the soundtracks than to see the filmed version, but only when Troughton is not onscreen, he's not to be missed

Macra Terror - 9 - quite creepy, and even timely, given US politics as I write this (let him who has ears hear)

Faceless Ones - 10 - off the charts - suspenseful, well written, with Troughton at his hapless and commanding finest (luckily, one of the best episodes, Episode 1, survives on film and is part of this DVD set)

Evil of the Daleks - 8 - overlong, probably stretched out to fill the last few weeks of this season, but with a smashing (literally) climax as rebel Daleks (created by the good Doctor in one of his usual strokes of genius) destroy the Dalek home planet.

And that's just Troughton's first season - as for the second, which I am just peering into now, ""Fury of the Deep"" is a masterpiece, perhaps the very finest sci fi storyline to appear in a television series on either side of the Atlantic, ever. BBC saved about 45 seconds of that one.

Go grab this DVD set right now, and see the way Doctor Who deserves to be portrayed - an absentminded genius, an inept angel, a befuddled Prometheus, who always rises to the occasion with flair and brillance.  You'll love Patrick Troughton - the greatest Doctor Who!  He never disappoints.",1130198400,10,5915,4.717201166180758

They are an excellent addition to any Dr. Who fans collection but I still felt it came up short.

For two of the stories ""The Crusade"" and ""The Moonbase""  The audio of the episodes was inserted so the complete story could be experienced.  I see no reason why this could not have been done for a couple of the others particularly Toymaker & the Wheel in Space.  I would have paid an additional $10 for the DVD without blinking an eye for that.

Dispite that objection the collection is worth your time and your money.  Of course who knows, as time passes maybe more of these episodes will surface from private collections and my objections will be moot.",1106265600,8,820,4.5
2111698,4,B0002OXVF0,"Quite frankly, there should be two ratings for this collection. If you've never seen Doctor Who before, this collection is not for you, so don't bother buying it. On the other hand, if you're a serious fan of the classic BBC science-fiction series, this is a rare gem of a collection, well worth the expense.
It's a bit unusual in that, although more of the Second Doctor's (Patrick Troughton) stories are forever lost, the Troughton collection takes up two DVDs, while the First Doctor (William Hartnell) has only one DVD.
Nevertheless, the BBC is to be commended for the production values they've put into this collection. On some stories (The Moonbase, eg.), they've included the entire story, even though only two of the four episodes still exist. For the other two episodes, the BBC have included the original audio soundtrack, so it is possible to at least listen to the entire story. Audio and video quality is surprisingly good. (It's often interesting to compare the sharpness of 1960s B&W video with the dreadful quality of late 1960s and early 1970s colour video - anyone who can receive a CHUM-CITY station such as VR or PL can check out the washed-out prints of Ironside or Kojak, or hockey fans can compare the quality of the recent Canada Cup rebroadcasts on TSN.)
The DVDs contain existing episodes from a number of stories which are incomplete, and also hold a number of gems such as original BBC trailers for stories, including a trailer for Troughton's first story, ""Power of the Daleks"".
An often-overlooked gem is the ""Who's Who"", biographies of some of the key actors in various stories. Some people who went on to bigger and better things appeared in the series in the Sixties, such as Julian Glover and Jean Marsh. It's also interesting to note how many actors in 1960s British TV played guest roles in Doctor Who, The Avengers, and Z Cars.

Sadly, this also makes you realize what a tragedy it is that the Beeb lost or destroyed so many of the early stories.  (Yes, destroyed.  They're trying to back out of that now, but some of the episodes in this set exist only because someone was fan enough to get ahold of any and all extant film or copies.)

2111703,4,B0002OXVF0,"As most Doctor Who fans know, there are huge gaps in the archives for the black and white era of the show that featured the first two actors to play the role, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton. Due to a total disregard for archiving material and, criminally, as a cost cutting exercise, there was a systematic junking policy for `expired' TV shows across many broadcast networks through to the 1970's. In many ways, Doctor Who fared better than most with many complete stories surviving either in private hands or more often by happy accidents.

Although anything to have survived is miraculous, in many cases, irritatingly, stories were left incomplete on the archive shelves. Pretty much useless to any broadcaster and indeed seemingly for home DVD or video release. But the bright guys at the BBC have spotted a way to gather up all this stray material and package it together on a collection of three discs featuring not only eighteen complete episodes but a whole myriad of other snippets and gems from the vaults.

As a huge Doctor Who fan, I was thrilled to see all these homeless relics gathered together, but from a wider commercial viewpoint, I don't think it's a particularly interesting project. But isn't it wonderful for fans to be indulged in this way? I'd never seen either episodes of The Faceless Ones before, so this was a real treat, as it was to see the newly discovered gem from The Daleks' Master Plan.

The problem for me is that alone, or even where two or more episodes exist, it's exceptionally frustrating to watch what remains of these stories. If you're watching episode one for example, you're completely hooked by the end and then hugely disappointed that there is no more! For stories that just have the odd episode from the middle of the story, it's enough to drive you barmy. My biggest irritation came from watching episode 4 of The Celestial Toymaker. What on earth is going on? It would have been so, so much better had the DVD contained a synopsis of what was missing to help flesh out some of the material and put things into context. Definitely an opportunity missed. In a step towards this, there are soundtracks included for two missing episodes from The Crusade and The Moonbase, which does help complete those stories, but since photos exist of both missing episodes, why weren't they included? When all there is to hear is music or sound effects, it leaves you bewildered as to what might be happening. A photo or a subtitle would have been so much more effective.

Also gathered from the cutting room floor are many, many short clips (in some cases, don't blink or you'll miss them) from other completely deleted episodes. It's sad that in so many cases these split second clips are all that have remained. There's also a lot of home movie footage, which is really interesting. I believe this to be the only color examples of footage from the era and although short, they are wonderful to see.

We can but hope that as time goes on, some of the missing material will turn up. No one would have thought the complete Tomb of the Cybermen would suddenly reappear in 1992. So hope springs eternal.

2111705,5,B0002OXVF0,"The Lost In Time set is something hardcore Doctor Who fans, including me, have been looking forward to for a long time.  For those who aren't familiar with the history of this show, back in the 70's, a bunch of BBC executives decided they wanted to save money in storage space by destroying a bunch of tapes containing episodes of many of their old shows.  This was a time before there was a market for video compilations, and they figured no one would want to see these again.  Also responsible were some of the short-sighted agreements the actors/musician unions had with the BBC which limited how many times one could rerun programs.  But before they destroyed their copies, they transferred many of them onto film for exporting to other TV stations around the world.  By the time they saw the error of their ways, it was too late, and the search was on for the stories they exported which continue to this day.  Although I heard that the number of Dr. Who episodes destroyed pales in comparison to other archived shows, it was still a short-sighted move on their part, regardless of their rationale at the time.

So unless a miracle occurs, these restored episodes from stories where half or less of the episodes survive are all we have left of some of the early 60's stories when William Hartnell and later Patrick Troughton portrayed the Doctor.  The set includes the remaining episodes as well as surviving clips of some of the stories where none of the episodes exist, and a 1998 BBC special on the missing episodes hosted by Frazer Hines and Deborah Watling.

Some of the stories featured:

1) The Crusade (ep's 1 & 3) - Historical story during the Hartnell era which includes Episode 1 that was recovered in 1999.  Some parts of the episode could not be fully restored, but considering the circumstances, we should be lucky to even have it.

2) The Dalek Masterplan (ep's 2, 5, 10) - Epic 12-episode Dalek story.  Included is episode 2 ""Day of Armageddon"", returned to the BBC in January 2004.  First appearance of actor Nicholas Courtney as Bret Vyon.  He would later return as longtime recurring character Colonel (later Brigadier) Lethbridge-Stewart.

3) The Evil of the Daleks (ep. 2) - Only surviving episode of this 7-parter.  Debut of Deborah Watling as travel companion Victoria Waterfield.

4) The Web of Fear (ep. 1) - The second story to feature the Yeti invading the London Underground, and was the debut of Nicholas Courtney as Lethbridge-Stewart, although he's not featured in episode 1.

5) The Wheel In Space (ep. 3 & 6) - Cybermen story and the debut of companion Zoe Herriot (Wendy Padbury).

As enjoyable as this collection is, it nevertheless makes you crave for more for obvious reasons.  It's frustrating to be able to see stories at only the beginning or middle or end.  This is the sad legacy of the BBC's short-sightedness that we can only hope there are some private collectors who are secretly stashing episodes and are just waiting for the right time to come out with them (what those reasons are I have no idea).  If you are a beginner Dr. Who fan, then wait until you see some of the complete stories first before checking this out.",1094169600,54,3172,4.69620253164557
2111706,5,B0002OXVF0,"Cant wait for this set! Who was the idiot at the BBC that destroyed most of the early Doctor Who's?! The BBC should of known that VCR's was coming,and that some day a format called DVD was going to take the VCR's place in the home. I so much would love to have all the old Doctor Who story's on DVD?! I always wanted to see The Fury from the Deep story,I read the Target book and loved it. I have some of the audio Cd's but it's not the same as watching it. This set will be nice. Cant wait to see The Daleks Master Plan part 2. I hope The first Dalek story will be coming out on DVD soon? It's sad they will not be in the new series. Update the Daleks will be in the new series.",1090800000,3,679,3.8226950354609928

8030056,4,B0002OXVF0,"I still find it hard to believe that over 100+ Doctor Who episodes were lost due to ""improper storage"". BBC just did not store them properly or not store them at all. I guess this is a decent effort to rectify that mistake to a certain degree.

The Crusade is a bit hard to watch due to 2 of the episodes are ""audio track"" only and I have not been able to find out what ""narrative link"" is or how to activate it on the DVD. I do not see it any ""narrative link"" under the episodes or under the Special Features. It is listed on the back of the DVD and also on the product page so it must be there. If anyone knows how to activate the narrative links, I would appreciate if they let me know. I took off one star because of that. I thought they would also add subtitles for those ""audio track only"" episodes. There are subtitles for regular episodes but not for audio track only episodes (I guess that's due to including narrative links instead, except that I cannot find the narrative links).

The Dalek Masterplan is also hard to watch because there are missing stories in between the episodes (I am guessing the missing stories are completely lost stories so they don't even exist in any shape or format).

Overall, this is an great product for true Doctor Who fans containing rare episodes and surviving footages. However, keep in mind that due to missing episodes and stories, it feels choppy and there is a lack of completeness to the stories. You will have just to accept these rare episodes for what they are worth.",1514678400,,1520,4.382978723404255
