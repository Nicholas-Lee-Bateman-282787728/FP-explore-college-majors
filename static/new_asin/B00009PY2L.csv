7992404,5,B00009PY2L,"Teresa Stratas gives a raw and eloquent rendering of a wandering woman divided into 2 persons, one silent, the other doing the singing. This is accompanied by a superb male chorus acting different ages and genders. Masterful playing by the Orchestre de Lyon, Kent Nagano, conducting.",1502409600,,283,5.173913043478261
7992405,4,B00009PY2L,"The original production of this ballet/opera reflected not only the minds of its creators, Weill, Brecht, and Balanchine, but of the Germany in which the first two had lived and worked until the advent of Hitler, a desperate, defeated Germany in the Post-War (WW1) period, a Germany in which some sought for a democratic government and society but were being attacked both from the Left and the Right, and in which most  were being battered by wildfire inflation and frightening depression. Within the artistic community, there were the often brutal and alway telling reflections of the war veterans Dix, Gross and Beckmann, among many others, while Jazz and other non-traditional forms dominated the music of the Clubs and other popular venues. That is the setting in which Weill wrote in his pre-American years and the context in which many of us are accustomed to place his work as we listen and watch. That is what makes watching this 1993 version somewhat difficult to take on its own merits. While done in German (with fine subtitles in English), there is not much ""flavor"" of the realities of either..nothing much of any social context which provides a stance with which to view the film. That is the difficulty I had with the production.
On the other hand, despite its limitations, I was quite gratified to be able to see what Peter Sellars and his choreographer have produced. Teresa Stratas who did most of the singing was quite good throughout. The ""chorus"", those who intermittently commented upon the behavior of the Stars, also did a good job in the limited role prescribed for them. Nora Kimball, who plays the ""other side"" of the character played by Stratas, does all that was required of her and looked very good doing it.
In the brief 45 moments which comprises the piece, we see two sisters (really two sides of one character) departing Louisiana to make their fortune so as to allow the family to build a new houses. As they move from city to city (in the United States), each brings out in them (her) one of the seven deadly sins (gluttony, envy,......) which is reflected in their behavior. Finally, they (she) return(s) to the home in Louisiana showing, it seems, little of the wealth or understanding they might have acquired in their travels.
I imagine that anyone (and there are so many) who have become attached to Weill's music, either in its Germanic or American phase, will want to watch this. It lacks the flavor which some revivals of his earlier works have manifested, but, still, is is worth watching (and hearing). Newcomers should enjoy it since they will come to it without the sound of the twenties in their ears.",1448236800,,2651,4.800875273522976
7992406,5,B00009PY2L,"I'm a huge fan of the music of Kurt Weill, but I'd never heard this piece before. It's mind-bending, both musically and theatrically.",1415491200,,133,4.826086956521739
7992407,4,B00009PY2L,"Kent Nagano and the Lyon Opera, are a great match for Weill's music and Brecht's book; they are all underappreciated wizards.  The soloists are rightfully known and show their stuff in this presentation.  The only hitch here is Sellars' mise en scene.  As usual, he takes a grand theme and drags it through the slums; radical chic had its brief day in the '60s and is best forgotten.  A sound recording and the imagination would be just right.",1394064000,,443,4.641025641025641
7992408,5,B00009PY2L,"The full title of this incredible ballet chante by Kurt Weill (libretto by Bertold Brecht) is ""The Seven Deadly Sins of the Petty Bourgeoisie.""  The last collaboration between Weill and Brecht, the ballet has nine scenes, one for each of the deadly sins plus a prologue and an epilogue.  The action revolves around two sisters (or are they two personae of one and the same character?), Anna I and Anna II.  Anna I is the primary singer, Anna II the primary dancer.  The setting is the United States.

The two sisters are sent out by their family to make money and salvage the family's fortune.  Along the way, they fall into ""sin.""  But the depiction of sin has a deliciously satirical and anti-bourgeois spin in which Weill and Brecht in fact unmask typical middle-class virtues as vices.  The transvaluation is really breath-taking.

So is Peter Sellars' creative direction, as well as the performance of the entire company.  Sellars turns the leeching family into southern white trash that aspires to tacky middle class status, and the series of video-montage that punctuate and divide the scenes is brilliant.  Teresa Stratas leads the superbly skilled company of singers, and her facial expressions and body language accentuate the beautiful tones of her voice.  But for my money, Nora Kimball, Anna II, steals the show.  Almost without a speaking voice in the ballet chante, Kimball's sensitive dancing is just as expressive of (variously) excitement, grief, belligerence, weariness, and homesickness as any libretto could be.

A masterful production.  The artists are magnificent.  If your experience when you watch The Seven Deadly Sins is similar to mine, you'll be torn between admiration for the aesthetics of the piece and uneasiness over its unsettling presentation of truths about middle class complacency that most of us would rather not hear.",1203465600,16,1858,5.122923588039867
7992409,3,B00009PY2L,"Teresa Stratas is the very best interpreter of Weill in the modern day (Ute Lemper's hysterically exaggerated emotionalism is just inappropriate for this very spare, almost intellectual music), and she and the other singers and musicians do a fine job.  However, Sellars' frenetic and distracting camera work and direction ruin what should have been a 5-star production.  A shame as it's the only video record of Stratas singing this music.  You might want to rent this first; I wouldn't buy it after having seen it.  Too irritating to watch.",1183939200,12,542,5.056179775280899
7992410,5,B00009PY2L,"If you are interested in contemporary settings for a classical opera, or any ""modern"" opera, I suggest you to buy this together with Mozart-da Ponte trilogy (Le Nozze di Figaro, Don Giovanni, Cosi fan tutte). Showing short film strips in transitions with no audio was extremely clever idea, allowing some time for the viewer to think. Although somewhat old production, audio is fabulous, with incredible singing and orchestral playing.",1125100800,14,435,5.318840579710145
