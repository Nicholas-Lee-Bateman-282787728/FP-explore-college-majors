8055940,2,B0008F5SOU,"I am so disappointed that I want to give this no stars, but I love Richard Scarry and, even though the box is very misleading, it is still a good video.
I got this because it says, ""Three stories: A Trip to the Moon, Sergeant Murphy's Day off, & Mr. Frumble's New Cars"". I specifically wanted ""A trip to the moon"", but also like the other two stories. My child was deeply disappointed that it is three stories from the videos listed, not the actual stories. The story from A trip to the moon, is the story of Floating Bananas. No where on this video case, or on the listing here, does it indicated that there are stories from each video, and say that these are the actual three stories on this compilation. How frustrating!!! Now I have to order another video!
Again, it is typically wonderful Richard Scarry, but the stories are actually, ""The floating banana"",from A Trip to the Moon,  ""The sleeping car adventure"", from Seargeant Murphy's Day Off,  and ""Billy Dog's bad day"", from Mr. Frumble's New Cars.",1220918400,2,1007,4.558011049723757
