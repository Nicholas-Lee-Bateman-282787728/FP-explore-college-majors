3781717,5,B001RXDM18,"I really loved this movie! Haylie Duff surprised me with her acting abilities when it came to horror. Ryan Merriman is one of my favorite actors (from childhood movies) so to see him play his role great made me happy.

I loved the theme of ""Backwoods"" and how it was actually a cult type- of thing.

I'm just sad at how they showed this movie once on t.v. and never again. I've been looking online so i can buy the movie and finally they have it up here on Amazon!",1256428800,,464,4.144444444444445
3781718,2,B001RXDM18,"I remember renting this movie and watching it. Now, not even an month later I couldn't tell ya a thing about it... Thats how much it stood out to me... If I remember correctly the acting was horrid, it had a couple wannabe stars in it and was just like every other movie thats came before it, only lamer. If it wasn't for the cover art I'd have forgotten all about this movie, entirely!",1253318400,,386,4.22972972972973
3781719,5,B001RXDM18,"I like horror films to make me jump or scream.  This one did.  Yes, it's the same basic premise we've seen many times in this type of movie, but the plot isn't really what I watch these movies for.  Also, there's plenty of new twists/elements in this one. This movie really had me cheering for the ""good guys"" - I was glad I'd watched it by myself, as the last 20 minutes or so really had me screaming at the TV, cheering the kids on.  I really enjoyed watching this movie, and am buying a copy to share with my horror loving friends.",1248134400,6,534,4.155339805825243
3781720,4,B001RXDM18,"I quite liked the characters and story .Think Timber Falls meets Dying Breed.

Haylie Duff gives a believable performance as one of the girls that go on a paintball excursion with a group of co workers for a workshop in leadership and team work. After they settle in for the night at there camp they are attacked and  taken to a cult community and put in cages .The men are set to be slaughtered and the women to be bedded by the breeder. A huge ugly looking mutant who serves as  stud service for the savage hillbilly cult that have made a home in a remote part of the ""Backwoods""

Danny Nucci whom I love turns up in this indie slasher and his acting is always up to par playing a cocky jokester.
Deborah Van Valkenburg gives a chilling performance as the mother of the cult .You might remember her from her stint in the 80's sitcom ""Too Close For Comfort""and she was also one of the prostitutes in The Devils Rejects.

I like this movie because it has all the elements I like in a slasher although it could have used more gore but that didn't
diminish my enjoyment of the film. The main thing I loved about it was that the captives don't remain helpless victims and just get tortured ""although that can be fun too""..There is quite the battle for survival and some great avenging moments.

Is it original ? not exactly but the formula is still fun and one I as a slasher fan always enjoy. The one where people wander into the woods,run into some crazy backwoods clan with their own set of rules and morals and they're usually not conducive to the health of the trespasser. It's non stop action from beginning to end.",1246752000,22,1618,4.376666666666667
3781721,3,B001RXDM18,"This wasn't just a few degenerate hicks gone homicidal in the woods. This was an entire compound of hicks gone homicidal in the woods, wanting to procreate. Must have ran out of farm animals. Since most of these movies are the same, what makes them worth watching is the acting. This one was a little different. For one thing it had that Howling 1 movie werewolf chick as the head of the hick family. With all of those relatives though, one of them could have bought her some Rogain though. One thing missing though was a good end-of-the-movie one-on-one fight for survival between the protagonist lead male or female and either the big hulking hick or the head hick ranger. You could have had both-the protagonist female fight against the Rogaine deficiant head antagonist female and the lead protagonist male fight against the two antagonist males.  The acting was good, as was the violence, although I would have pushed the neurotic screaming chick off the top of the cliff. She got on my nerves.

The little differences in this movie, made it pretty good when compared to similar films. I am a huge fan of young unknowns in these types of films. Too many killers in such films  can dilute the concentration of the viewers, just as too many victims can. The ""survival in the woods"" theme is always a plus. Doubt if their will be a sequel , buit this was worth buying.",1246406400,7,1370,4.60655737704918
3781722,2,B001RXDM18,"I hope beyond all hope, every time I watch this kind of movie, that something new will be brought to the table.  Something I haven't seen before, even if it's just a twist ending.  However, when you name your movie after a practical horror genre, it can only mean one of two things.  You're either sending up the ""inbred redneck"" genre, or you're just adding to the endless list.  Backwoods is the latter.  The only shred of plot divergence here is that the group of psycho's are living on a former military reservation, and somehow think the land belongs to them.  So when a group of fatigue-wearing paintball players comes walking into their ""territory"", naturally, they take offense.  This may be new to someone who hasn't seen any of the hillbilly maniac movies, but the plot is almost exactly the same.",1245801600,,807,4.680851063829787
3781723,3,B001RXDM18,"I didn't have high expectations for this movie.  To my way of thinking, the world already has more than enough B-horror movies featuring a group of young people going out into the woods and being attacked by a bunch of dirty, disgusting backwoods cretins.  To make matters worse, the characters in this film are all taking part in a corporate team-building retreat (not a reunion - the information in the editorial review is less than accurate), a practice I consider to be one of the most infernal ideas mankind has ever come up with.  And wouldn't you know it?  These young video game company executives turn out to be among the most annoying people on the planet.  Only two have any redeeming qualities whatsoever, the one dude who isn't really in to all of the kissing up and debauched camaraderie (Ryan Merriman) and the hot girl who's sort of uncomfortable with her jerk boss's constant touchy-feely sessions with her (Haylie Duff).  To my surprise, the film actually grew some legs somewhere in the middle - but not enough to really win me over.  In the end, a complete lack of originality consigns Backwoods to the ranks of the slightly below average.  Think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wrong-Turn/dp/B00005JMDZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wrong Turn</a>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hills-Have-Eyes/dp/B000E8M0P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hills Have Eyes</a>, and you'll pretty much have Backwoods all figured out.

I wasn't sure what to make of the name Tom Alan Smithee being given to a character (and a minor character, at that).  As most B-movie buffs know, ""Alan Smithee"" is the name film directors use when they know they've made a real stinker and don't want their real names associated with the project.  Maybe the character name is just a coincidence, but the fact that Smithee and his girlfriend turn up on Missing posters as having last been seen on February 30 seems to indicate that the script writer may have had a sense of humor about the whole thing.  (Unfortunately, these in-jokes are the only creative aspects of the entire film.)

So our stereotypical characters all go out to the middle of nowhere to play paintball, hone their ""executive tactics,"" and have their teamwork skills reviewed by their obnoxious boss.  Being hot-shot executives and all, they happily set up camp in what they know is a restricted area that used to house some sort of military installation.  The one unhappy camper among them soon notices all of the obvious evidence that they're not alone, but no one wants to listen to his party pooping warnings.  The next thing you know, the gang is besieged by a group of religious fanatics who proceed to beat the crap out of the six guys while preparing the two females for use in increasing the local nutjob population.

Backwoods was apparently produced for Spike TV, so don't expect to see much in the way of blood and gore.  (Needless to say, there's no nudity whatsoever.)  Some old-fashioned traps make the chase scenes through the forest somewhat interesting, but I pretty much relied on Haylie Duff's hotness to get me through the film's 80 minute runtime (although I must admit I got quite a kick out of watch a mortally wounded techie put on an amazing show of shooting bad guys without even aiming.)  If you're a horror fan, Backwoods is certainly a watchable film, but you won't see anything here you haven't seen before.",1245110400,31,3493,5.1705150976909415
3781753,4,B001RXDM18,Backwoods in my book was good now i always wanted to see it but i tryed to buy it at fye i don't think that they would order the right one. Because they have a couple of films called backwoods out anyway i thought it was good even though there wasn't that much blood in it and violence i mean what do expect it was made for tv. Now they actually had good actor's in here and the plot was good to but the way ended was stupid.,1408060800,,425,3.840909090909091
3781754,3,B001RXDM18,"I suspect that many people didn't even make it past the first half hour of Backwoods, but thankfully the film does get somewhat better after that. The story begins very simply, with a group of computer geeks going on a corporate retreat in the woods. In typical horror movie fashion, they get lost on the way and ask for directions at a gas station. The man behind the counter, directs them to a closer and even better spot in the middle of nowhere and the games begin. Ultimately, the group stumbles on a fanatical religious cult, who mistake the group for FBI agents, because of course all FBI agents are out of shape, twenty-something, computer geeks, carrying paintball guns. From there it's a fight for survival and a race to escape the backwoods of Northern California. While the film does get better after the first half hour, it still has its problems. For starters, the story is far too unbelievable, no one would take advice from someone at the gas station who looked like that and even rednecks in the middle of nowhere aren't going to mistake a bunch of geeks playing paintball for FBI agents. As with most horror films, the cast is lead by two extremely good looking people, Ryan Merriman and Haylie Duff, who both give unexpected performances. Merriman is know for his fiery and inspirational roles in sports films and he should most definitely stick to those. He was way out of his league here, giving a really ridiculous and unbelievable portrayal. Merriman's done horror before, and even starred in one of the Final Destination movies, but he's clearly not right for this type of film. Haylie Duff on the other hand was terrific! She has really turned into a pretty good actress and is absolutely beautiful. Backwoods would not be my first choice for a horror film festival, even for it's genre it is unbelievable and assumes it's audience will be too dumb to pick up on it. The performances vary and the sequence is somewhat expected, although I did enjoy the ending. The verdict, Backwoods isn't terrible, but it's far from special, I'd only rent it if I liked one of the cast members or was a big fan of the genre.",1400630400,,2134,4.648148148148148
3781755,3,B001RXDM18,not a bad movie for the money but if you are looking to be really scared nah. but then again I am a hardcore horror fan so certain movies don't scare me.,1398556800,,153,3.8125
3781756,5,B001RXDM18,I enjoyed all of Ryan Merriman's movies. They are good enough to watch more than once. Lots of suspense and drama.,1389830400,,114,4.476190476190476
3781757,4,B001RXDM18,it kept me interested and i watched it 2x since receiving it....i chose liked it only because i like alittle bit more gory style movies and this was not exactly that..story was good...acting was good...makes you think twice about those casual fun weekend trips to the woods and just who might be hanging around waiting for YOU! iam glad i have it in my dvd collection,1377561600,,367,4.575757575757576
3781758,4,B001RXDM18,It's hard to keep a redundant plot interesting but Hillary and her co-stars manage to pull it off. I enjoyed this one,1375574400,,117,4.363636363636363
3781759,2,B001RXDM18,"The venue for inbred right wing religious families has moved from Texas and West Virginia to California. A group of executives go into the woods to play paintball only to be captured by aforesaid group, with women being used for breeding. I had the feeling of deja vu the whole time I was watching. I enjoyed the fast moving intense opening credits. The film was decent up until the meat of the picture, the confrontation, and at that point it was a yawner.

I would consider this to be a generic film with standard eye candy, plot, and acting and on the minus side of the blood and gore. Dead animals don't count.

Parental Guide: 2 f-bombs. No sex or nudity. Women are apparently tied up to be raped, but it is off camera.",1368403200,,724,4.395522388059701
3781760,4,B001RXDM18,"I bought this thinking it would be just another movie about a bunch of ppl in the woods being attacked by a bunch of crazy ppl just because they're crazy. I figured on a rainy day when nothing's on, why not watch another gory movie about what we've all seen a thousand times before just to pass the time. I was actually very surprised at how good this movie actually is.

Finally, we have a decent reason for ppl being out in the woods instead of them just randomly deciding to go there or the usual running out of gas. And finally there's an actual legitimate story behind why the ppl are crazy in the first place. The group is a bunch of young business ppl who go on a paintball retreat for the weekend in what they think is some kind of National Park. The ppl that live in this area are still stuck in some kind of time warp where they believe the government is out to do them harm.

One of the guys walks around with a hat on that says FBI so the ppl that live there think that's who the group is. It's not long before they start their next day to do their paintball thing when they realize strange things happening around them. They soon realize something's not right and decide to leave. That's when everything starts happening.

However, the ""backwoods"" ppl aren't running around randomly trying to kill everybody just because they can. They don't want to harm the women. There's sort of a 'Mother Earth' figure who leads things and believes the women need to be part of their circle to breed. I won't say much more and give it all away but finally a good backwoods story that has meaning for the ppl being there and meaning for why they're being targets.

It's actually a really good movie, good acting, good storyline, and everything comes together when it should.  I'm glad I added it to my collection.",1318636800,,1812,4.380952380952381

Why to they like having captured women impregnated? Too many unknowns for me. Not enough gore for my liking. Just a ok film.,1301011200,,303,4.735849056603773
3781762,3,B001RXDM18,"Taking it's cue from classics like Deliverence, Southern Comfort, and a little (and I mean very little) from The Hills Have Eyes. Backwoods is a survival horror film with a semi predictable plot, minimal gore, and a decent amount of action to give it enough legs making it into a watchable movie. The only hiccup I have is that it lacks suspense and atmospshere to truly make it an effective horror film. But I like it enough to watch it the whole way through, and would give it another view. Definetly not a film for torture and gore hounds, But for a Spike TV produce film made for tv, it's not bad.",1292025600,,601,4.375

But when the woods reveal a hidden band of savage survivalists, the city folks must come to terms with their own brutal killer instincts- or suffer an unthinkable fate.

woods for a paint-ball game,but they are soon in big trouble,with the big ""family"" as I might call them like this.
The only thing,that is in my eyes not that good,is that almost everyone from the group dies,and certainly the most disturbing,the end,you must see it for yourself,but despite of a few minus parts,if you like such movies,highly recommended!",1282003200,,647,5.29126213592233
3781775,2,B001RXDM18,"The DVD arrived in perfect condition, brand new as the seller stated.  The movie itself though is not worth your money. I watched about a half hour of it on the sci-fi channel and decided it looked good so I bought it from Amazon. But watching I whole movie, I realized it is very stupid and pathetic. If you think you're interested in it, I suggest renting it for $1.00 or less from a local movie store. It's definitely not a ""watch again and again"" movie.",1280361600,,457,4.313953488372093
3781776,1,B001RXDM18,"I had this on in the background on SyFy while I was doing other things, paused to watch for a while. I think I've seen this same movie maybe a dozen times now. A couple of weeks ago, it was called ""Timber Falls"" or something like that. The plot is simple: a group of rather uninspiring yuppie types goes camping or on some kind of retreat (details change slightly from movie to movie), run into a group of violent, backward wackos who just happen to wear their religious fundamentalism on their sleeves. The yuppie men are beaten and tortured; the women are dressed in skimpy dresses and sexually assaulted, to be bred to make more wackos--with the ""stud"" usually a long-haired knuckle-dragger who can't even speak past the occasional grunt. Through their innate stupidity one of the wackos screws up and drops his guard; the yuppies pick him off and escape. Alarms sound; a chase ensues. One of the yuppies is able, usually through the most credibility-destroying means the writers can dream up, to pick off the pursuing wackos. In the case of this movie, the most vengeful yuppie has stepped into a trap and gotten himself impaled on a pair of wooden spikes. He is nevertheless able to raise his rifle, aim, & drop several pursuing cultists with one shot each. The whole sequence is laughably idiotic.

What struck me as I was watching was the following: how many times now have we seen rural, religious people depicted as violent, bloodthirsty psychotics who have to all intents & purposes left the civilized world (or were never part of it to begin with)? Can this possibly be a 'good thing'? Most country people, in my experience, are more decent than most city people--or at least will be decent to you if you are decent to them. If you're simply interested in a decent horror film, does the word 'stereotype' ring any bells?

Think this is just entertainment? Don't kid yourself. The Hollywood lefties who dream up this crap have an agenda. I have to wonder if they really think they are doing society any favors. What they are doing is watering the fruits of further social division, setting groups and classes against each other when what we should be doing is coming together.",1277596800,3,2186,4.704960835509138
3781777,5,B001RXDM18,Or else you won't come back out....alive! This was a great movie based on gore alone. I know some people hate the reality show premise but overrall this is a well done movie. The violence is more intense than the first movie and the gore is plentiful. I thought it was a well paced movie as well. If you like straight up slasher flicks with well done effects than this should do the trick.,1275523200,,389,4.27027027027027

3781780,5,B001RXDM18,"Very few films have ever been a hit when they go directly to DVD release, but ""Backwoods"" was a certified smash upon its release in 2008. The film features a bunch of young people going into the outback to do a paintball series, who go against each other in the woods. Eventually one by one these people are killed by crazed in-breeders living in isolation in the wilderness, kinda similar to ""Wrong Turn"" and ""Hills Have Eyes"" but the people in this movie are a big cult. The movie is pure escapist fun and if you love horror films ""Backwoods"" will satisfy your appetite for blood, guts, and gore. The movie is among one of the best I've seen and the acting was incredible, especially from Haylie Duff. 5/5",1274486400,,707,4.488372093023256
3781781,2,B001RXDM18,"Backwoods (2008) is another film where folks from the city, run into trouble while camping out in the wilderness.  As a made for TV feature, things are toned down accordingly.  For a film in this genre, Backwoods is not particularly original or well done, and is rather annoying at times, but it does provide a few thrills and laughs.

As part of a job evaluation, the executive staff of a computer gaming company is divided into two teams, for a paintball battle in the forest.  The two groups drive out into the backwoods of North Carolina, and setup separate camp sites.  The next day, the war game begins, but while out hunting each other, the paintballers are attacked and captured, by members of a religious cult living in the woods, and dragged back to their camp.

Deborah van Valkenburg (Too Close For Comfort) is the matriarch of the forest clan.  She determines if female prisoners are suitable for `breeding', with her ugly hulk of a son, Josiah (Robert `Bonecrusher' Mukes).  The forest people are engaged in the manufacturer of illegal drugs, and fear the attention of law enforcement.  Believing that the outsiders are FBI agents, the male prisoners are beaten, and tortured.

Killing some of their captors, the surviving male prisoners, led by Perry (Danny Nucci) and Adam (Ryan Merriman), manage to get free and do some damage.  Making a break, they are able to free their companions, Lee (Haylie Duff) and Maggie (Mimi Michaels), and flee into the woods, with the clan close behind.  The film's most memorable instance of graphic violence, involving a trap with sharpened wooden spikes, is also one of the most humorous.  It is amazing how well someone can shoot, when impaled on a set of spikes.

The writing is not great, particularly the dialog.  Many of the victims are not too bright, or very likeable.  Story development is not a strong point, and the ending is pretty weak.  There is some decent use of outdoor locations, and a couple of nasty kills, but nothing that really distinguishes the film from others in the genre.  While perhaps pushing the edge for a TV movie, this film isn't in the same extreme category as some feature films.  If your taste in horror runs along the lines of a diluted, dumbed-down version of `Wrong Turn', you might want to give this a try.",1272672000,,2296,4.752525252525253

8339147,3,B001RXDM18,"This is certainly a watchable horror flick, but it's not great by any means. It's rather bland in terms of blood and gore. The kills aren't particularly entertaining or inventive. The movie script is extremely ordinary, chock-full of standard genre cliches. There's no nudity, and though instances of rape are scattered throughout the runtime, they're shot in a very PG sort of way. If it wasn't for the constant utterance of the ""F"" word, this movie could play on any network TV channel. I'd suggest watching any of The Hills Have Eyes movies instead, or the first couple Wrong Turn movies.

8339153,3,B001RXDM18,"Released to TV in 2008, Backwoods stars Haylie Duff and Ryan Merriman as employees of a video game company in Los Angeles partaking in paint ball games on a company retreat. Theyre mistaken for Federal agents by a Waco-like religious cult who apprehend young women to impregnate. Havoc ensues. Craig Zimmerman plays the company leader and Deborah Van Valkenburgh the matriarch of the cult. Mimi Michaels and Willow Geer are on hand as female eye candy. There are many others; too numerous to cite.

The movie plays like a mishmash of Wrong Turn (2003), Hostel (2005) and similar movies, but is limited by its TV budget and constraints. Amazingly, production-wise its on par with Wrong Turn (which wasn't anything great to begin with, but it was at least passably good) and, as a result, has better women, locations and music, but a weaker script and blas filmmaking. To be more specific about the positives: The opening & closing metalized song is excellent; the cast is good, highlighted by Willows curvy beauty and Duffs striking features; and, like I said, the wilderness locations are great. Unfortunately, the movie often plays in a routine and not-thought-out way. For instance, would the cult advertise the entrance to their secret underground compound with cant-miss-them concrete entrances and air vents? Wouldnt they more likely make these features blend-in with the environment? Would a guy impaled by several wooden spikes be able to shoot a rifle at the hip as accurately as shown? Also, the ending leaves one element up in the air and reflects an all-around absence of imagination. Still, if you like the redneck slasher genre there are enough positives here to make it worth checking out. Just bear in mind that when the most imperative question about a movie is Whos the hot redhead at the beginning? its not a good sign.

The movie runs 85 minutes and it looks like it was shot in wilderness areas in greater Los Angeles (but I cant confirm it).
