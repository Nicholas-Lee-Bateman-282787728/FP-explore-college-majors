7202018,3,B00XWC7IPS,"Not bad, decent story.  Would have given it a four but the research on French Foreign Legion is flawed, only foreign nationals are permitted into the legion.  Dolph would have been more real as a Swede with a Swedish accent (really bad french accent he had), and a Swedish backstory.  Also the rank was wrong, if he is going to wear a Foreign Legion uniform, he should have had a legion rank.",1442707200,9,392,4.416666666666667

7202020,2,B00XWC7IPS,"This movie is a collection of cliches from bad war movies but does manage to meander its way to a conclusion to the wayward plot.  Historical inaccuracies abound but that was probably secondary to giving some young guys screen time, providing another paycheck to a couple of old has beens, and earning a tax write-off for the financial backers.",1440547200,,344,4.830508474576271
7202021,2,B00XWC7IPS,"Captain Jack Wosick (Luke Goss) has recently gone from hero to goat with the loss of his troop. He is given a second chance by Colonel Redding (Mickey Rourke). Jack is teamed up with Dolph Lundgren, a member of the French Foreign Legion and speaks English with a French accent....I think that was that was.

They lead a group called ""War Pigs"" who don't like officers or orders. They job is to take out one of Hitler's ""wonder weapons."" However before they do that, they must train on a bunch of stuff they won't use and a lot of stuff they should have learned at basic training. The idea of presenting this material should be to bring it back later on, instead of using it as mindless filler.

The characters were not that developed or colorful to be a dirty half dozen. The highlight of their antics is stealing chicken eggs. Boring dialogue, action, and climax.

7202024,2,B00XWC7IPS,The only actor I recognized was dolph lundgren who played a French Foreign Legion captain. He is teamed up with a disgraced us officer to lead a group of Misfits soldiers called The War Pigs on a recon mission to a Nazi super weapon. Anyone who has any clue about how the military works or even just common sense will probably laugh at some of the things that happen in the movie. I think it's supposed to be another Dirty Dozen type movie but it doesn't live up to that standard. I watched it one Saturday on Netflix when I was bored. I can't really recommend it though,1494028800,,570,4.287037037037037

It would appear that the person creating them was also had a cat running across the keyboard and didn't have a functional backspace to remove what it put in.  I think a room full of chimpanzees would have done a better job at getting the words close.

Chuck Liddell appears for less than 5 mins. Luke Goss' character has survivor's guilt. It's a cheesy ripoff of Dirty Dozen and original Inglorious Bastards. Mickey Rourke appears for less than 10 mins. His character makes 0 sense. If it's 1940s why is he dressed up like that? The movie was horrible. Rent it never pay full price.
I hate it when RedBox makes it seem like it's a good structured indy movie with an all star cast. Then it's just cameos and a cheesy cliche story.",1450051200,2,569,4.428571428571429

 had been anticipating this movie for a time. As someone who follows their Facebook page, I have been recieivng all their updates. Knowing that this is a Low budget War Movie and knowing how short of a shooting schedule this film had, I am Super impressed with the final product!

Luke Goss and Dolph Ludgren do an amazing job portraying WWII soldiers and i think they give a great performance. I thought the War Pigs Cast, did an excellent job as well. This movie very much reminding me of the fun WWII action movies I would watch in the 80s.

7202071,1,B00XWC7IPS,"Probably the worst ""war"" movie I've ever seen. It has zero tension and the no-name actors are uniformly dull. The action is not believable. Imagine a completely watered down ""Dirty Dozen"" with a half dozen lame recruits, under an interesting office (Luke Goss) and a French legionnaire played by Dolph Lundgren, who can't decide when he wants to speak French (or try).

8716878,2,B00XWC7IPS,"I managed to get through about a third of this film before I gave up trying to deduce whether or not it was intentional comedy. I want to say that I don't really fault Dolphin for his French accent (or the silly hat) - He never was a serious actor as much as a super-macho type for the movie guys to put in where his character would fit. He's like a tradesman - Not very creative, but reliable. Now - To establish my bonna fides for critiquing a war film, I can't claim to have been in combat. Never was. However, I can claim that I was smart enough to avoid it, and that makes me smarter than the average grunt. The whole premise of the story (as I discern from the first thirty minutes or so) is that a bunch of reluctant combat guys are being groomed and trained for a tough mission by a French Foreign Legion officer (Dolphin) and a savvy vet US officer. It's all about the ""men"" and their attitude. In Vietnam (my era) the officers would have been really worried for their lives at the hands of their men more than the enemy. I don't know abut WWII, but I suspect there was a different dynamic between officers and EMs. I doubt this comedic script reflects that ethic or the VN era either. This is Hollywood Style, so it really has nothing to do with historical accuracy; it's just about cartoon characters and a new vision of reality - Like the more recent vampire, zombie, and mummy genre films, comedy dramas. Just entertainment. I understand the problem: Since the end of WWII up to now just about everything that could be said has been said; everything that could be written has been written; everything that could be made into a screen play has been made into a screen play. But still, they have to make movies out of something, and WWII is like romance and other perennial themes that are sure bets for a modest return on investment. I have to hand it to the writers/ director: It took a long time and some clever work to introduce ""The Girl"" after a half hour. It is, you know, what Hollywood refers to as ""The Girl."" The other elements of formulaic screen writing in this genre - Developing the individual characters of the men and the dynamics between selected characters is just the amme and just as predictable as the wartime films. Boring. I'm going to stop now with only this much more to say: All of these Sunday Services presentations of the Church of World War Two have one thing in common (at least): They really avoid telling the stories of the real tragedies of war: the deaths of family members and the how that determines the future of a family and its individual members for decades or centuries to come, and the terrible reality of war that no amount of flag waving and justification can supply. That is the missing element in such propaganda - Always. Intentionally. Maybe if you understand that you can also understand why feminism and ridicule of men is the core value of the state and state controlled movie industries. OK - I do have one more thing to say. If you want to know what a really human film director wanted to tell us and managed to do so when the government wasn't watching closely enough, see the Japanese movie ""Twenty Four Eyes."" It's told as though women were/are the only moral force in the universe, but that's understandable, maybe forgivable. In my opinion, that has more to do with market forces than government demands. After all, a film director has a lot of powerful people looking over his shoulder and holding the strings.",1521158400,,3482,4.476415094339623
