7907232,5,B00000F987,"I got this picture once from my library on VHS. It has been a while, but I have always remembered it fondly. Now, I'm looking for it on DVD but with out success, more's the pity. It is a wonderful black and white presentation of a surreal Paris wherein only one man is awake/alive - all the others having been put to sleep. Imagine having a city all to oneself -the advantages and disadvantages that would afford.
If you like surrealism, minimalism, black and white classic film, or simply an unusually creative and clever idea - you will probably cherish this gem as much as I.
Please release this on DVD!!!",1312934400,,608,4.486486486486487
7907233,4,B00000F987,"The date of this film is a strong clue, but I feel compelled to say first and foremost that The Crazy Ray is a silent film.  And I do mean a silent one; there's not even any musical accompaniment with it.  I suppose this early movie could be dubbed science fiction of a sort.  The watchman at the top of the Eiffel Tower wakes up one morning to find everyone and everything in Paris completely frozen.  He walks along deserted streets, occasionally encountering men and women who are alive but quite unconscious.  Just as he is beginning to engage in the type of laughter denoting approaching madness, he runs into a group of people who just flew in to town during the night and are very much up and about.  The little group settle in and begin to take advantage of their peculiar situation, indulging in good food and the like during the day and sleeping high up in the Eiffel Tower at night in order to avoid a repeat performance of whatever seemed to freeze the rest of the population down below.  Midway through the film, the guys suddenly realize that there is only one woman in the group and, for all they know, in the world, so they start fighting among themselves.  Eventually, they find out what happened to the world around them.  A mad scientist fellow named Dr. Crase activated his ""Crase ray"" (or crazy ray) and basically stopped Paris and presumably the whole world in its tracks.  Convincing the professor to reverse the effects of the ray turns out to be only the first step at restoring normalcy to their lives.
This is a strange movie, but the fact that it was filmed in 1923 makes it interesting in and of itself.  A couple of things stand out to me.  One scene finds the camera taking us on a quick jaunt through the winding streets of Paris; this is a fairly impressive point of view camera sequence.  The suggestion of height was also conveyed quite well.  A good bit of the story takes place high up in the Eiffel Tower, and it certainly looked like a long way down, especially when the men started fighting close to the edge of their elevated location.  Those interested in silent pictures should find much of interest in this early offering from director Rene Clair, while the casual viewer, faced with several storylines within the film that don't make perfect sense and a complete lack of musical accompaniment may find themselves pretty bored over the course of this 51-minute cinematic experiment.",1048896000,3,2426,4.596287703016241
7907234,4,B00000F987,"The first film of Ren Clair was this enjoyable science-fiction movie about a not so mad scientific with a mysterious ray that stood still Paris (and all the world?). The images of a deserted Paris with the hero looking for people are the seed for next science fiction movies like ""The World, the Flesh and the Devil"" or ""Five"". Essential for science fiction studious.",972432000,,367,4.75
