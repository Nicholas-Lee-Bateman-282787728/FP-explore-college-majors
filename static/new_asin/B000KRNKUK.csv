2697067,4,B000KRNKUK,Through this video we get a rare view at the life and times of guitar genius Jason Becker. Throughout the good times and bad his charm and irrepresible spirit show through. His courage in the face of adversity are an inspiration. And the shots of him playing a guitar solo while tossing a yo yo have to be seen to be believed.  Sadly as much of this feature is drawn from archival footage the sound quality varies widely.,1175731200,13,421,4.397435897435898
2697068,5,B000KRNKUK,"Jason Becker, the closest thing that rock guitar has had to a ""prodigy"" in its history, was stricken with ALS in his early 20s. That makes this DVD all the more priceless because Jason is unable to play now. Not much of the video here seems to be professionally shot, but the content is amazing! Loads of footage of Jason in his prime, including the maestro giving a guitar clinic, some home studio footage, and some performance footage of Jason in the band Cacophony with his friend and co-guitarist Marty Friedman.

You may help Jason when you buy this, but as you will discover, he will help you in return ten times as much. Besides showing you new avenues on the guitar, you will like him as a person just as much as a musician and guitar player - Jason is one of the special ones. Jason has had a profound influence on my own journey as a guitar player and musician.

There are also some news updates of Jason's present condition.",1168819200,33,935,4.430232558139535

8158855,4,B000KRNKUK,Jason was one of a kind. It is a shame his talent was lost to such a debillatating disease--but he continues to write music even if he can no longer play. It will be a long time before another Jason comes along!,1395273600,,211,4.0476190476190474
8158856,4,B000KRNKUK,"He loved it. I'm supposed to say 17 more words about it, but if you are a fan and a guitarist, you'll probably like it.",1373846400,,119,3.8

My son told me about  Jason and the great way he  plays the guitar .I looked up on line and found ""Jason Becker,Not Dead Yet"" and found this too. We got both for his birthday. I watched them both and he is an amazing young man!!! My son was glad to have both DVD's.",1370736000,3,312,3.859375

8158860,5,B000KRNKUK,"Great DVD! Jason is one of the greats! Even though his lessons are done in a different way (just him playing), it gives you the ability to take his technique and make it your own.",1356652800,,179,4.142857142857143
8158861,5,B000KRNKUK,"In my personal opinion, Jason Becker was the best guitar player of all time. He played with Marty Friedman in the shred metal band cacophony, put out the solo album perpetual burn, and went on to play lead for David Lee Roth on a little aint enough. In his early twenties he contracted ALS and ended up paralysed from the neck down. He is rediculous. I've seen old men who have been playing their whole lives who never even came close to little 16 year old Jason Becker. As for his Hotlicks DVD, its great. I would recomend it to any aspiring blues, jazz, metal, or contemporary guitar player. He wasn't to good at explaining the theory behind his music, but just seeing this guys chops will make you a better guitar player.",1252195200,,724,4.451127819548872
8158862,5,B000KRNKUK,"My husband was ecstatic to get this.  Though he is very saddened by Jason Becker's condition.  My husband plays guitar and can easily imagine the frustration of not being able to play anymore.  There are a variety of clips, even school talent show recordings.  We were very happy with this purchase.",1213401600,2,299,4.803921568627451
8158863,5,B000KRNKUK,"Jason Becker is an impressively gifted Rock Guitar player. He comes from the 80's shredder school that gave us Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Yngwie Malmsteen and others. At the end of that decade he got sick and couldn't play again. Here you have a chance to see some of his best performance, live and in the format of video clinics. If you love Rock Guitar, you will love this DVD.  it is simply AWESOME.",1181347200,14,400,4.405405405405405
