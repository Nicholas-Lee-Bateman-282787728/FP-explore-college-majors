4570680,2,B0054RVSG4,"My daughter loves Angelina Ballerina and owns pretty much all of the DVDs. Whenever we heard there was going to be a full-length movie, we knew we would have to buy it for her. Unfortunately, this ""movie"" equates to about 30 minutes of new content and another 30 minutes of recycled material from the other DVDs. Many of the song and dance sequences are cut and pasted throughout the film and seen as flashbacks. Needless to say my daughter was very disappointed when she found out that she only got to watch the equivalent of one new episode which the standard DVDs have at least four.

In conclusion, if you have kids who are huge Angelina fans, pick this up at your own risk. They'll enjoy the new songs, but expect some disappointment when they start seeing some familiar scenes playing over again. I would recommend waiting for the next DVD that's being released in October.",1314835200,,879,4.634615384615385

The serials on PBS are so short.  This full-length movie provides a better, more detailed understanding of Angelina,  her friends, & teacher.  I enjoyed it & I'm no kid.

I have never attended a ballet event.  Don't think I will.  But she brings the different forms of ballet alive in such an entertaining way.  Maybe I would attend ballet shows if she was the performer.",1363824000,,458,4.6125

4570714,4,B0054RVSG4,"This is called a movie, and really it is more of a put together bits and pieces of the show, but in timing and entertainment it is worthy as a movie to a preschooler and my daughter loves it. We're not much of a live TV family, but we do enjoy our DVDs and Angelina Ballerina is a new favorite. The music in this one is really enjoyable, even for mama. If you are just starting your Angelina Ballerina collection at home, you can hardly go wrong with this one in the Shining Star Trophy.

I love the get-up-and-dance that this movie brings to both of my girls toddler and preschooler and I do believe they'll pick up some valuable notes on musical education in the process of this entertainment as well. Multicultural dance as well.
