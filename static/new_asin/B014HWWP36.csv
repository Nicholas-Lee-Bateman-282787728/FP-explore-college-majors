7407186,4,B014HWWP36,"Atmosphere, texture, and vibe save the day in We Are Your Friends, a rather daft, but often highly entertaining film set in the world of electronic dance music.  Zac Efron stars as Cole, an aspiring DJ dreaming of fame and fortune while living in a San Fernando Valley pool house, earning a modest living dealing drugs and cold-calling people in foreclosure at a shady real-estate firm.  He and his childhood friends (Jonny Weston, Shiloh Fernandez, Alex Shaffer) live fast and play hard to avoid recognizing their complacency and the resulting encroachment of mediocrity.  An encounter with a veteran producer (Wes Bentley) and his girlfriend slash assistant (Emily Ratajkowski), however, may represent a chance to ignite Cole's career in music if he can navigate and overcome a treacherous fusion of ambition, desire, and loyalty.

Most of the drama here is on the contrived and predictable side.  Anyone who has ever watched a film knows Cole will sleep with his jaded mentor's girlfriend, and the secret will be revealed in time for a third-act confrontation.  There is also an eleventh-hour twist of tragedy; it rings false and seems harshly shoehorned in, as if a studio executive became nervous regarding the picture's otherwise largely cavalier attitude toward recreational drug use.  And despite the title, the friends are interchangeable bros and arguably the least interesting part of the film.

Yet despite its flaws, We Are Your Friends is fun!  A quality which should not be undervalued.  First-time feature director Max Joseph recently completed a short documentary on the history of  DFA Records, the label co-founded by LCD Soundsystem mastermind James Murphy, and he infuses this film with a genuine respect for dance music, the technique required to create it, and the euphoria it can inspire.  He crafts the picture as an earnest, sentimental invitation to a mainstream audience to consider beats per minute, sampling, and the experience of standing in front of hundreds or thousands of people armed only with a laptop.  Joseph also proves an aggressive stylist, and the swirling visual experienceone drug-fueled party is depicted with psychedelic animation; hand-held cameras dart and zoom through thronging crowds of people gyrating and becoming one with the Day-Gloand his heavy hand suits and elevates the content.

There are also a trio of charismatic performers at the center of the story.  Efron, who I have long felt possesses a genuine movie-star magnetism beyond his initial claim to fame as a Mouse House heartthrob, is handsome, wide-eyed, and easy enough to invest in.  Bentley plays what could be an entirely antagonistic role in a sympathetic, almost haunted way; by refusing to twirl a proverbial mustache, he brings a degree of humanity to the aforementioned flawed-mentor arc/contrivance  And in one of her first acting roles, Ratajkowski, one of the most famous supermodels in the world at the moment due in part to her involvement in the ""Blurred Lines"" video, is not only incredibly sexy, but an authentic and warm presence.",1440892800,7,3065,5.1971544715447155

7407221,5,B014HWWP36,"This film We Are Your Friends  is actually a pleasing film to watch if you have listened to andor enjoyed club, trance, andor dance music before. The film features Zac Efron as Cole Carter. Cole Carter is both trying to make the best out of his life and break into being a DJ as a career, along with his friends Dustin Mason (Jonny Weston)Squirell (Alex Shaffer), and Ollie (Shiloh Fernandez). Cole Carters gets invaluable career  help in his goals when he meets and forms a friendship with Wes Bentley (James Reed). However, what complicates the situation is the dynamics that develop between Cole Carter and Bentleys girlfriend Sophie (Emily Ratajkowski). I bought this film before the Accountant, so imagine my surprise when I noticed that Jon Bernthal is featured in the film as realtor Paige Morrell. I admit that Bernthals character performance to Cole Carter inspired me eventually study up on whatever low cost andor free resources I can get on learning real estate after a dramatic scene that I had seen in the film.

7407290,3,B014HWWP36,"You have to take it for what it is-- this isn't a film that was meant to win major awards or be regarded as a fine piece of art.  It's not the kind of film you watch and then sit and analyze and discuss for hours.  Efron, Ratajkowski, and Bentley all do a solid job with their roles, the rest of the acting is pretty meh-- not necessarily bad, but don't really add much to the film.  It's not quite an ""underdog"" story, but there's a pretty clear message about the importance of wanting ""more"" from life, particularly wanting to ""move"" people.  (Then again, I'm an amateur musician who buys heavily into the notion of healing and unifying powers of music.)  Anyone in their late teens or early 20s will absolutely identify with the struggle for identity that Cole (and his friends and Sophie, I guess) faces throughout the film.  And any musician is going to get chills at times while watching.  The soundtrack is also pretty solid.  However, I have some problems with the movie, mainly because one of my close friends is in the EDM business, and well, this movie does not accurately portray this world.  Because some idiot 20-something is going to say ""well I'm not tone deaf and I do a ton of molly so I can totally break into the EDM scene"" after watching this....

1. EDM is not all about drugs, by any means.  This movie blatantly romanticizes drug abuse.  (E.g., the Vegas festival scene with Cole and Sophie.)  ~~**Omg taking hard drugs with the guy/girl you're into is sOoOoO romantic right?!?!**~~  Haha but really.  I have problems with this because drug abuse is by no means an integral part of the EDM culture...

2.  They make EDM seem overly simplistic, at least in the beginning of the film.  And Cole's entire ""caveman's sense of rhythm, ninth grade biology"" monologue is also b.s., haha.  It's far from that simple.  I know, everyone who's not into EDM is rolling their eyes right now, but as someone with both classical and popular musical training, I can say that there's a hell of a lot more to EDM than just ""sick drops.""  In fact, I think it's tougher to make a hit EDM track than a pop/rock/alternative/country hit, honestly.  Cole's epiphany towards the end, where he's recording the everyday sounds, is a bit cheesy, but I mean, he's not that far off from the truth at that point.

All in all, worth the $1.50 rental fee from Redbox if you're looking for something to watch.  Just don't hold it to an elevated standard. :)",1468281600,,2447,4.546910755148741

7407336,3,B014HWWP36,"Zac Efron is well suited in his role as an aspiring EDM DJ.  Most of his time is spent hanging out with his 3 buddies, all in their early 20s.  He actually lives with one, Mason (Johnny Weston) and his parents.  He helps out around the house and gets to sleep on the couch.  This by-the-numbers coming-of-age (is 23 too old to be still coming?) drama features the usual check offs.  Cole (Efron) is the passionate one, Mason, the surly rebel, Ollie (Shiloh Fernandez) is the druggie and Squirrel (Shiloh Fernandez), is the shy, thoughtful one.

When Cole meets an older more established DJ in James (Wes Bentley), he finds someone to emulate.  James is also living with his personal assistant Sophie (Emily Ratajkowski) and Cole cant take his eyes off her.  So check off another box.  We know where thats going.  Its just a matter of time before the rest of the rote events take place.  When will the rage of Mason be exposed?  Who will become the tragic figure?  In a side story, the boys go to work for a sleezy mortgage consultant (Jon Bernthal) whose job is to prey upon poor people who are about to lose their home through foreclosure.  That plot point seems to have been established only to show the altruistic side of Cole.

Director Max Joseph gets his first shot at directing a conventional film after several shorts and documentaries and shows some promise.  Im always a sucker for slick sets and Jamess home is pretty slick.  He also has a way with an inventive use of images.  In one scene at Jamess house, Cole is given some PCP which provides some hallucinogenic animated visions as the colors slowly envelops those around him.  There is also a terrific soundtrack with the film.  That, assuming you don't hate electronic dance music.  Even though this film is not on Blu ray domestically, the DVDs Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack, kept my toes tappin.

7407380,4,B014HWWP36,"Nine Things About the Movie ""We Are Your Friends""

1. Every generation has movies about a kid who dreams of being a famous musician. Weve had rock n roll, hip-hop, among others. This latest one is about electronic music.

2. It stars Zac Efron as a young man named Cole who dreams of being an EDM artist and DJ. He has three friends that try to help him get booked. Or at least, try to sell drugs where he does get booked. Cole finds James, who is an older, more established EDM local star. James takes Cole under his wing, teaching him some of the tricks of the trade until a girl gets in the way.

3. The movie does a decent job of teaching the basics of making an electronic music track. And it does a great job of explaining why people get so hyped and mesmerised by EDM. Its part art, part math, and part biology.

4. The movie is also pretty honest about the drugs that come along with the parties. The part where Cole experiences PCP is classic - as well as a great use of trippy animation.

5. Wes Bentley plays James. Ive loved Bentley ever since American Beauty, and while he doesnt always pick the best movies to star in, he does a good job here as the artist who both admires and dismisses Cole.

6. Zac Efron is Cole. Efron proved hes a great actor with 2012s The Paperboy, so he had nothing to prove to me. Hes better than his role in this movie, and he could have handled a more complicated character. This is good, because he's in almost every single scene.

7. The movie was directed by Max Joseph. This is his first feature film. His regular job is co-host and camera guy for MTV's ""Catfish: The Series"".

8. The movie makes the cynical (but not untrue) claim that you only need one good track to be famous. But it also shows the delicate artistry that goes into making that one good track. Its not as brainless as the haters say. And Im not gonna lie - the track Cole makes at the end of the movie was great (surely that doesn't count as a spoiler). I even rewound it and watched that scene over again.

9. This is not a complicated movie; it follows the plotlines of most other Im gonna make music stories. But while its not original, it has a charismatic cast, a decent story, and a great soundtrack. Its an entertaining 90 minutes.",1457136000,,2253,4.257611241217798

All of this changes when he meets a charismatic but damaged older DJ named James (Bentley), who takes him under his wing. Things get complicated, however, when Cole starts falling for James' much younger girlfriend, Sophie (Ratajkowski). Predictable but still this movie has something. it is sexy and it is very stylish. When he meets the girl he (of course) starts to distance himself from his friends who have been there forever. Cole, wants to ""be someone"" and his buddies don't fit. Will he give in to his urges and steal his new mentors gal? As I said this was so predictable that a monkey could have written it but still I was entertained. The angst was flying everywhere. Does someone die? Someone always does in these movies and you should get who that will be immediately. All of the performances were acceptable and worth a look, it is Zac!",1454976000,3,1083,4.705263157894737

If you answered ""Yes"" to those two questions, you're definitely going to like this movie, get it.  I could say more, I could talk about the ridiculously hot Emily Ratajkowski (who isn't just a model, she really can act), the great soundtrack, the solid/fun connection between the ""Entourage crew"" but other reviews already do a great job of that.

7407501,5,B014HWWP36,"I am very fond of Zac Efron. I feel he is one of the great actors of the future. Every role that he has chosen so far in his career has showed us a different side of his talent and this film is not an exception. Zac throws himself into the character, even though growing up in Southern California surely helped him. This is a movie about relationships and growing up emotionally. A reality check movie that tells the story of someone who wants to be more than the average guy hanging out with his friends partying and hiding from life. Wes Bently gives a really solid performance as the older version of Zac's character and the female lead is very good as their romantic interest. Not what I thought it was going to be, but totally not a waste of time. If you love Zac Efron it's a no brain-er.........Rent it!",1447718400,2,810,4.3355263157894735

When he meets James (Bently) a DJ that is willing to mentor him he thinks he finally found what he wants. Cole soon finds out that trying meet the expectations of his friends, hiding his romantic feelings, and working on his music isn't as easy as he was hoping for. I was really not looking forward to this at all. I'm not a big Zac Efron fan, nor am I a fan of this type of house music. That being said, I actually liked this more than I expected to. The movie is a little generic and nothing all that special, but there was just something about it that kept me watching and entertained. Efron actually does a pretty good job of portraying what the character is thinking when he is not speaking and only working his board. This is not an amazing movie and won't win any awards but I actually liked this much more than I was expecting to. If you are into this type of sound you will probably like it much more than I did, if you aren't you still may enjoy this like I did. Overall, a surprise of a movie that I liked more than I expected to. I surprisingly give this a B.",1447718400,3,1192,4.076595744680851
7407503,4,B014HWWP36,"This movie was actually pretty excellent. I was pretty surprised myself. I had to admit that, from the preview, it looked fun and exciting, but like it might not be the best movie out there in terms of acting and artistry. For that reason, people were looking down on this movie and  saying that it looked like it might be stupid. This movie actually proved to be pretty exciting, and not that bad in terms of the artistry side of things either. Altogether, we actually have a pretty solid movie. I just really love the direction this movie went in, and how it was fresh and optimistic. There is nothing in here that is genius, but I love the subject matter and tone.

The only things that notably slowed it down were the less than perfect screenplay and acting. The directing was excellent and as good as I'd really need it to be. It wasn't quite Danny Boyle in ""Trainspotting,"" but it was up there, and it had somewhat of a similar vibe. Both the acting and the screenplay had a bit of a stutter in its step and weren't all out 100% awesome. That is why I subtract 1.5 stars, to give this 3.5 stars. Zac Efron is a solidly good actor, even if he's a little bit bland and ""straight up the middle."" He's certainly very likable, it's just that his acting is kind of ""plain vanilla."" The same could be said of Emily Ratajkowski. She is certainly gorgeous beyond belief, and her acting is better than you'd think, but she is just missing that last step that makes her an excellent actress. The script is also ever so slightly shaky. It needs a little spicing up in the dialogue department, although I think the acting is what brought this movie down a notch. At the end of the day, I actually love the direction that this movie was going in. I loved its positivity, and it was exciting in the way that I wanted it to be. It was good for some of the same reasons that ""Trainspotting"" and ""Go"" were good. I'm sorry that it wasn't a bigger hit, and I definitely recommend that you watch it.",1447286400,6,1984,4.345013477088949

Like American beer, We Are Your Friends is fun, fairly lightweight but has a good heart. The target audience will love it then promptly forget about it 5 seconds later.

Want more in-depth analysis? Consider #WAYF to be a 21C version of Platos Republic, The Lord of The Rings, heck, even The Bible: its a morality tale to help you understand and avoid lifes pitfalls. Its a story for todays teens, tweens and in-betweens: you're probably never going to make it big, but hey, someone does, so why not give it a go? Oh, and drugs are awesome! Oh, and don't do drugs.

Moreover, 'We Are Your Friends' covers the dreamer spirit and the 'step on your face to get ahead' business spirit that LA weirdly cultivates. Everyone is one contact away from 'making it.'
