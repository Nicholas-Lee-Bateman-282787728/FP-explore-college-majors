2204668,2,B000787YRW,"THE FOUR SKULLS OF JONATHAN DRAKE(1959)---Eduard Franz, Valerie French, Henry Daniell, Grant Richards, Paul Cavanaugh, Paul Wexler, Howard Wendell, Lumsden Hare.
Another ""horror film"" that is so bad, it's fun to watch.  Eduard Franz plays Jonathan Drake.  Valerie French is his daughter.  Henry Daniell plays a sinister character known as, ""Dr. Zurich""(supposedly from---you guessed it---Switzerland).  We learn that over a hundred years ago, a ship captain named Drake sailed up the Amazon River into the territory of the Zivarro(Sp.?) Indians, who practiced the art of shrinking heads.  The Indians kidnapped and killed/decapitated one of Drake's crewmen.  In retaliation, Drake killed and decapitated every male(man and boy) of the tribe---the only one who escaped was a Zivarro witch doctor.  He placed a curse on the males of the Drake line unto the fourth generation.  Since that time, Captain Drake and his son had both died suspiciously, been decapitated, and their skulls had subsequently mysteriously been placed in the locked family vault.  This phenomenon seems to occur when the Drake males are around age 60(the significance of which is never explained).  Jonathan fears that his brother(Cavanaugh) is about to become the next victim of the curse, since he is about to turn 60.  Franz goes to his brother's home, which seems to be located in some sort of remote, ""jungle-like"" area, in order to prevent him from falling prey to the curse.  Alas, he arrives too late---""Bubba"" has already been killed by a Zivarro Indian who happens to hang out with Dr. Zurich.  When his coffin is opened at the funeral, his head is missing.  Cut to Dr. Zurich shrinking the head in his ""laboratory"".  Sure enough, despite being securely locked, the skull turns up in the family vault, next to the other two.  We learn that Dr. Zurich is, in actuality, the witch doctor who did not, as it turns out, escape being killed/decapitated by Captain Drake over a hundred years ago.  The surviving Zivarro women sewed the head of the dead sailor onto the body of the witch doctor and brought him back to life through the use of some sort of potion made up of curare and other botanicals.  The only way Zurich can, ""find peace"", is by carrying out the curse.  Since Jonny-Boy is the fourth Drake left alive, Zurich has to kill him, decapitate him, shrink his head, and place the skull in the family vault.  His plans are foiled by a police detective who had been called in when it was discovered that Jonathan's brother did not die a natural death, but was murdered.  Zurich's Indian accomplice is killed, and he is shot, apparently fatally.  However, Jonathan tells the detective that the only way he can truly be killed is to cut off his head, which he proceeds to do.  Thus the curse is broken and Jonathan gets to keep his head!  As I said, this film is so ridiculously dreadful, and so full of gaping ""plot-holes"", that it is actually quite funny.  Recommended for those nights when you really have  nothing better to do and would like a good laugh!!!",1259884800,,3044,4.862135922330097
2204669,5,B000787YRW,"First of all, this is NOT a 2-disc set like it states in the data relating to this film, so don't be expecting that -- both movies are on one disc (one movie on each side) which is fine with me since they are both of very high quality.

If you're a cult film junkie like myself, you'll find that both of these films are a superb treat, ""Voodoo Island"" being slightly the better of the two. I'll address that one first:

This is a very well-shot B&W film with Boris Karloff radiating at its very center, only in this movie he does NOT play a monster. It was this film that showed me what a very fine actor Karloff really was. He plays a fairly genteel, but rugged, TV show personality who's investigating why a guy turned into a zombie on Voodoo Island, in the South Pacific (actually, shot in Hawaii). A developer wants to build a resort hotel there and he employs the hard-hitting Karloff to clear the way.

You'll see some other familiar cult film faces in this fine movie -- Elisha Cook, Jr., who played the strange little guy (homeowner) in the 1958 version of ""House on Haunted Hill"", (another awesome movie!), also does an equally fine job in this film. You'll similarly enjoy the man-eating (well... woman-eating) plants on Voodoo Island -- in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way, they're to die for!

And the grande coup for me was when, to my joy, I discovered that Les Baxter (""The Pit and the Pendulum,"" ""Tales of Terror,"" and ""The Raven"", all AIP films), did the filmscore for this one. It's one of my very favorites, being of the atmospheric late 50s/early 60s-type of ""atmospheric jungle score."" Compare this mood music to to that in the great 1959 Frank Sinatra WW II (color) film, ""Never so Few"", (filmscore by the great Hugo Friedhofer).

I found that the clarity of the shots and locations in this one were just absolutely superb. There are a couple of goofy script spots in the film (e.g., the redundant calling on the radio at one point in the film), but this wasn't enough of a distraction to impact the larger story. There is a definite sense of nostalgia about this film, from the music to the old Douglas aircraft in which the principals fly into the islands -- most Baby Boomers will pick up on it.

The final super bonus is that this one was digitized from a 35 mm print, if you're interested in such minutia, and this IS a nice clear print. Wow! I LOVE watching this flick on my 32"" flatscreen wide screen TV. It's just great!

As for ""The Four Skulls of Johnathan Drake"", I found this to be as much of a mystery (which helps to make it great) as it is a horror film and I liked it a great deal. Again the sets and locations were super (well, at least, fun) and, for me at least, this one doesn't ever drag at all. It also helps that this is another ""voodoo jungle film""...sort of. I REALLY like jungle films, especially black magic ones, and while you don't get a sense of ""jungle"" here, you still get the ominous Hivaro Indian slinking around with his mouth sewn shut.

As far as the cast, with Paul Cavanaugh and Henry Daniell (playing a spectacular chief evil-doer, Dr. Zurich) included here, who could possibly ask for more? They're both incredible in this film. It's a very good 1959 B&W flick that I enjoy viewing over and over.",1197849600,12,3256,4.433110367892977

2204672,3,B000787YRW,"As much as I love Boris Karloff, VOODOO ISLAND is a complete dog-log of a movie! Boris plays a TV host who debunks all things supernatural. He's hired by a zillionaire hotel magnate to go to an island and find out what happened to four men who went there. Only one of them returned, and he's zombified! So, Boris and five others set out for VOODOO ISLAND in the south pacific (!). Sounds like a terrific set-up right? Forget it! Our adventurers spend fully half of the movie's running time just trying to get to the island! Along the way, they meet a young Adam ""Batman"" West as a radio operator. Finally, they arrive on the island, where they spend loads of time talking and wandering around. A few man-eating plants attack, including some aquatic flora that reminded me of the ridiculous monsters in ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES. Nope, Boris can't save this one! One cool scene shows a little girl being eaten by a plant monster. Alas, this is the only such scene. THE FOUR SKULLS OF JONATHAN DRAKE is actually pretty good. The Drake family men have been dying at age 60 ever since an ancestor slaughtered a tribe in south america. Jonathan's brother has just died, winding up as a headless corpse! Now Jonathan knows he is next on the list. Enter Dr. Zurich (Henry ""The Body Snatcher"" Daniell) as the local anthropologist / voodoo witchdoctor, bent on shrinking Jonathon's head down to the size of grapefruit! His head-hunting servant is a highlight, with his mouth sewn shut and shoes made of human skin! FOUR SKULLS is a frightful fiesta for the fear freak! It is worth the price of this double feature...",1130889600,16,1609,4.609756097560975
2204673,3,B000787YRW,"Who will escape from Voodoo Island?  If the maneating plants don't kill them first, the boredom will.  Yes, Voodoo Island is rather dull.  I certainly don't set my standards too high when dealing with old B pictures, but a B film director has accomplished something rather rare when he makes a schlock picture that's not even mildly amusing.  The film has a pretty short running time, and our cast doesn't even get to the island till about 40-45 minutes through the film.  Alot of dilly-dallying up to that point.  Karloff gives a good performance as a skeptic who likes to debunk superstitious theories, but he really can't even save this film.  The natives on this island are about as threatening as the three stooges, and you don't see hardly enough of the maneating plants which are the only interesting thing in the film.  It's very anticlimatic as well.  Don't read any further if you honestly want to keep the ending of Voodoo Island a surprise.  The civilization on this island purposely turned it's back on the rest of the world and wants to keep the island and it's people a secret.  Is there a big showdown between Karloff and the chief?  No.  Karloff says, ""Don't worry, we won't tell anyone"" and the chief says, ""Oh, alright, you can all go"".  That's the end to the terror and menace of Voodoo Island.

The Four Skins Of Jonathan Drake is naturally the better film of the two.  It concerns a curse killing off the men of the Drake family, and the last man, Jonathan's attempts to stop it.  The witchdoctor(a native Indian's body with a white man's head) and his assistant(a guy who looks like he tried to swallow a sneaker and has the laces hanging out of his mouth) try to get their hands on the slippery Jonathan Drake.  Lots of cool shrunken heads in this one.  A decent film, that's where the three stars go.  I don't know if it's just my dvd, but there were a few glitches on the Voodoo Island side of the disc.  Lots of skipping, as though you hit the FF button on your remote at the lowest setting.  Maybe I just got ahold of a bad copy, but there are no scratches on the disc.  Buy with caution.",1128124800,21,2116,4.453125
2204674,4,B000787YRW,"Once upon a time, way back in the years B.C. (before cable), television stations used to run old horror movies on Saturday nights under the name ""Chiller Theater."" Yeah, they were ""B"" movies, but we as children found them scary and fascinating. Now these films find themselves an endangered species. Stations simply don't run them anymore, even in this age of cable where we supposedly get to choose from 100 plus channels. What we're not told is that the broadcast stations dropped late night old movies in favor of the infomercial, which means that the only refuge for old time psychotronic fans is the DVD.

MGM has done all us fans a favor by releasing ""Voodoo Island"" and The Four Skulls of Jonathan Drake"" as a double feature. These two favorite films from the ""Chiller"" days have fallen into oblivion and it is nice to see them resurrected in DVD format. Granted, these are not lost classics in ant sense except the psychotronic, but they are worth the time of any horror film buff.

The first film, ""Voodoo Island,"" has Boris Karloff in fine form as a scientific investigator called in by wealthy industrialist Elisha Cook, Jr. to examine strange happenings on a Pacific Island. So far, so good, but Boris soon discovers a voodoo cult (in the Pacific, no less) with some man-eating plants thrown in for good measure. The plot breaks down shortly after this discovery as the explorers use that old time-tested blueprint to get them all killed - Let's Split Up.

Produced by Howard W. Koch of ""Airplane"" fame, ""Voodoo Island"" looks like it's off the coast of New Jersey rather than in the Pacific. Still, Boris and Elisha maintain their dignity throughout, helped by a fine performance from Beverly Tyler.

""The Four Skulls of Jonathan Drake"" concerns on Jonathan Drake (Eduard Franz), who while attending his brother's funeral in South America, is shocked to find his decreased brother is missing his head, which later turns up in the family vault as a skull. Turns out it's part of a curse placed on the Drake family for their role in a massacre of Amazon natives. All the Drake men die of shock at age 60 and lose their heads.

Henry Daniell steals the picture as Dr. Zurich, who is the bad guy behind the Drake misfortune. Daniell has a grand time chewing up whatever scenery comes his way and is great fun to watch. Also look for noted English character actor Paul Cavanagh (""Sherlock Holmes and the House of Fear,"" ""The Scarlet Claw"") in his last film as Jonathan's brother, Kenneth.

Directed by Edward L. Cahn, whose credits include ""Invisible Invaders,"" ""Invasion of the Saucer Men,"" and the classic, ""Creature With the Atom Brain."")

2204693,4,B000787YRW,"'Voodoo Island' is a knockout, for several reasons.  First, it is shot entirely on location on the island of Kauai in Hawaii so it escapes the claustrophobic look of AIP flicks from the same period.  There is not much nail-biting suspense, but it maintains a certain tension.  Boris Karloff is always fun to watch and this film gives him a surprisingly sympathetic part to play.  Last, but certainly not least, we are finally given a fully realized, out-of-the-closet gay character in a mainstream film who is treated with respect  and equanimity by the rest of the cast.  This is amazing, considering that homosexuality was entirely verboten in 1950s American film, and if it WAS allowed to rear it's threatening head it was usually to stand as some sort of threat.  One can only guess that this flick traveled managed to sail under the radar of censorship watchdogs... or that the character was so intelligent and articulate that the usual bells and whistles did not go off.  '4 Skulls' is so wanked that it clearly stands out amongst the crowd of 1950s horror titles that surrounded it.  A 'must have' for 'Midnight Madness' fans.",1421193600,4,1133,4.829015544041451

2204711,4,B000787YRW,"A friend of mine convinced me to give ""The Four Skulls of Jonathan Drake"" a try and since it was offered free for Prime members as an instant watch, I felt I had nothing to lose. I'm so glad I did watch this film because it has some interesting facets that makes it a compelling watch. The streaming via Amazon was excellent with crystal clear film and audio quality.

The plot's focus is on an old curse placed upon the male members of the Drake family beginning with Captain Wilfred Drake who together with his men, massacred all the members of the Jivaro Indian tribe more than 180 years ago, whilst trying to rescue their Swiss agent, who unfortunately had been decapitated by the Indians by the time Drake and his men got there. The only one to escape death was the witch doctor Zutai ( Paul Wexler) who proceeds to place a horrible curse on the males of the Drake family - at the age of 60, each Drake male will die, the heads being severed, but the skull is returned upon entombment in the family vault.

Jonathan Drake (Eduard Franz) returns to his family home where he discovers his brother has died at the age of 60, and makes the horrifying discovery that his brother's head is missing when he insists the coffin be opened. To make a long story short, we learn that Jonathan Drake has been studying the occult for many years in the hope of discovering what caused the curse and how to put an end to it. His daughter Alison (Valerie French) arrives soon after and the audience learns more about the curse when Jonathan explains it to her.

Now for the highlights of the film. I enjoyed the occult theme with the shrunken heads mythos. I felt the filmmakers did an excellent job in providing a visual experience for the audience in terms of showing us the process of shrinking heads. This scene was done in meticulous fashion and though there's not much blood involved, the step-by-step process was incredibly creepy, and definitely set the atmosphere for what was to follow.

The characterization of some of the main characters was also credibly-done. Zutai (played by Paul Wexler) deserves special mention here. This is the Indian witch doctor who escaped death almost 200 years before and is now an immortal, with his mouth sewn shut. His creepy visage, with his stealth-like movements, manage to convey a sense of otherworldliness and there's a scene in the film where a detective investigating the death of Jonathan's brother shoots at Zutai, causing an animal-like howl to escape from Zutai. The sound was eerie to listen to, and certainly not a sound you'd expect a mortal to emit.

Then there's the true villain of the story, the malevolent Dr. Emil Zurich (Henry Daniell in a chilling performance). It is evident from the very beginning of the film that Zurich is a baddie, as seen by his cold demeanor and aloofness. As the viewer later learns, the doctor has some dark secrets of his own.

Even though the story line doesn't flow well and the characters are not as well-developed (Eduard Franz as Jonathan for example, spends a lot of screen time being incapacitated and Valerie French is nothing more than a prop really), some of its attributes more than make up for the flaws. I'd recommend this B-movie to fans of old school horror movies.",1381449600,,3262,4.6447140381282495

2204716,1,B000787YRW,"Poor acting, scenery, and a plodding plot! Not much to commend this movie apart from seeing early roles for some actors and end of career roles for others. The leading lady is attractive and the script demonstrates sufficient content for a decent horror film, but the movie misses the mark on too many levels to be considered good entertainment.",1359331200,,345,4.864406779661017
2204717,5,B000787YRW,"I have to admit that both films are in top condition: crisp, clean black and white, with excellent sound quality. I'm drawn more to The Four Skulls because it shows more imagination and outright suspense than Voodoo Island. Four Skulls has plot twists that are catchy and will keep you on your mental toes. Voodoo Island was a bit of a disappointment. The plot is mundane and the special monster effects were elemental. For example, an octopus type of carnivous plant's lengthy vines fold at times, revealing that the monster is nothing more than inflated plastic. I guess that is to be expected for the time; nothing too sophisticated. However, Boris pulls the film out of the fire with his excellent acting powers while the remaining characters run the gamut from zombie stares to hysterical female reactions. Yet the two-disc set really is a good buy and fun entertainment...except on a spooky, dark and windy night.",1349913600,3,919,4.897435897435898

2204719,4,B000787YRW,"I like the DVD ""The Four Skulls of Jonathan Drake"". It brings back memories of me and my sister on a rainy Sunday afternoon watching this movie. It has it's hoaky moments, but the quality is very good and the killer with the shrunken heads is classic!",1305763200,,251,4.361702127659575
2204720,4,B000787YRW,"I remember watching this movie at the Lindell Theatre in St. Louis as an impressionable pre-teen. This movie wasn't frightening as much as it was educational! No monsters from outer space. No vampires. Just old fashioned, gruesome murder.
  Since the plot centers on the primitive art of cooking and shrinking the flesh of a human head after decapitation and skull removal, this film should be classed as an eye-opening expose' on the savage, brutal and superstition-riddled practices of the Jivaro Indians of South America.
  Though this film deals deeply with the supernatural aspects of head shrinking, the detail of the actual process shown is very close to the real way it is done. The end product (VERY realistic shrunken heads) are as close to the real thing as you will ever see. And this film is not afraid to give you a very good look at the detail of the prop heads that actually look better than a real tsantsa (Jivaro name for a shrunken head).
  Other than the strange story of multiple murder and a good twist at the end, this is nothing more than a gross-out movie that was, probably, more effective 50 years ago. Even though no graphic (by today's standards at least) blood-letting is shown, just the depiction of how a shrunken head is actually prepared is enough to give you the ""willys"".  Add to the mix a tall, mute, murdering, wig-wearing Jivaro native that has his mouth sewed shut, making him look like an UN-shrunken head, and you have a movie that will hold your interest from the beginning to the end.
  This is NOT a well-known motion picture and you will get a kick out of watching your friends reaction to it. Put the movie on and don't tell them ANYTHING about it. Makes for great conversation afterwards.",1303689600,3,1736,4.684210526315789
2204721,3,B000787YRW,"Once upon a time, actors and directors could make a respectable career out of ""B"" movies--and this double-sided DVD offering VOODOO ISLAND and THE FOUR SKULLS OF JONATHAN DRAKE is proof of it.  Unfortunately, however, the first of these is not so much a ""B"" movie as it is a ""C"" movie, with the chief attraction being the name Boris Karloff.

Released in 1957, VOODOO ISLAND (also known as SILENT DEATH) is the story of a resort developer who wants to place a grand hotel on an unexplored island--but only one of the original crew returns, glassy-eyed, unresponsive, and very much like a zombie.  Greatly annoyed, he sends out a crew that includes famed television host and hoax buster Boris Karloff, his assistant Beverly Tyler, and of all things interior decorated Jean Engstrom to take a look around.  They have trouble on the way to island: the zombie is a lot of trouble; the have trouble with the airplane's radio; the boat taking them on the last leg of the trip conks out and they have to wait for the tide to take them ashore.  Once there they find three varieties of man-eating plants and a native tribe that wants absolutely nothing to do with these nosey outsiders.

The most interesting thing about VOODOO ISLAND is the fact that, here in 1957, it includes an overtly lesbian character: Clare Winter, played by Jean Engstrom, has the hots for Beverly Tyler, and she doesn't mind showing it--but she does mind be dragged in conversation with or casually touched by the various men in the party.  Clare ultimately pays the usual cinematic price for sexual depravity, but it is an amazing thing, to see a character of this sort in a film, especially a second bill horror flick, in this particular period.

Released in 1959, THE FOUR SKULLS OF JONATHAN DRAKE is actually the better movie of the two, and if it had had a gimmick it would have reminded me a bit of a William Castle film.  The plot is rather fun: for several generations the men of the Drake family have all died right around the age of sixty--and their heads have been mysteriously removed with their fleshless skulls mysteriously returned to the family vault.  Could this have something to do with a voodoo-like-shrunken-head curse placed on the family?  Well, probably, but the police aren't entirely convinced until police officer Grant Richards comes across none other than Henry Danielle, who was then near the end of his life and looking fairly worse for wear, but who could still give a beautifully extreme performance whenever he had the opportunity.

The primary problem with THE FOUR SKULLS is that it tends to be a little slow.  We have a lot of shots of cars pulling up to the door, people getting out, ringing the bell, the butler coming to the door--that sort of thing.  But although it isn't really scary these days, time has not robbed it entirely of gruesomeness.  Severed heads abound, a decapitated corpse is discovered in a coffin, and we even get to see the process by which a shunken head is made.  Ewwwww!

The photograph and sound elements are reasonable on both prints--although I have to say that THE FOUR SKULLS is a bit better--so fans of these films should enjoy them, and in either case both are good late-night popcorn-munchers.  Recommended to fans of the genre at this this period.

8045744,2,B000787YRW,"Painfully dumb horror mystery hybrid involves a curse on a family where every male member dies of apparent heart failure at age 60 but is buried without a head--although the skull mysteriously reappears in the locked family vault even though there is supposedly only one key.  Considering that the heads of all the supposed victims of the curse are removed why would doctors or police in any of the cases attribute the deaths to heart attack rather than foul play?

The setup for The Four Skulls Of Jonathan Drake is actually promising and might have easily been a fun Universal or Monogram B-movie in the 1930's or 1940's.  Unfortunately, this was made in 1959 and the execution feels much closer to cheesy 1950's science fiction.  The movie seems to be trying to make everything that is happening feel down to earth and believable which is a problem because it completely undermines the supernatural elements in the script.  It's kind of like watching a Dragnet episode that suddenly has a real vampire in the last 10 minutes--it wouldn't work because the tonal shift would be too abrupt and extreme for most viewers to accept.

The other major problem is the frustrating stupidity of pretty much every single character in the film.  At one point there is an attempt made on the life of the title character.  The butler saw someone flee from the bedroom holding a stiletto.  There is blood on Jonathan Drake's pillow.  But when the detective wants to have the pillow analyzed at the police lab the family doctor says ""Why?"" because he still thinks his patient must have had a heart attack.  The murders involve shrunken heads and tribal rituals but the professor who is an expert in exactly those things and happens to turn up at the house that's the center of the crimes isn't a suspect?  The homicide detective uses a skeleton key to gain access to someone's house and finds absolute proof of murder--an actual severed human head--but doesn't radio that information to headquarters?  And then he drives back to the police station instead of to where the person in immediate danger is actually located?

I suppose if you find spectacularly stupid behavior entertaining then you might be amused by The Four Skulls Of Jonathan Drake but I don't tend to enjoy bad movies unless I'm watching them on Mystery Science Theater 3000.  This one really could have used those wisecracking robots.",1505952000,,2388,4.832923832923833

Voodoo Island stars the great Boris Karloff.  He plays the leader of an investigative expedition trying to find out why some surveyors died and the sole survivor ended up in a catatonic state.  It seems the company Boris works for wants to build a resort on an isolated Pacific island and nothing is getting off the ground.  So, off Boris and his team go to said island and meet up with weird Bermuda Triangle-type weather and communication trouble, strange man-killing plants, and voodoo practicing natives.  Voodoo?  On a Pacific island?  Boris's crew are worth a look.  A bombastic company man, a greedy wannabe company man, a he-man boat captain, a Sapphic female reporter/photographer, and an uptight, upright, almost robotic female secretary.  A conversation between the reporter and the secretary is an eye-opener for present (today) day audiences.  Talk about come-ons.  Meanwhile the reporter turns down he-man flat.  Later on he-man and secretary get together, after the secretary loosens up.  Horror-wise the film is not that scary or spooky, even for 50's audiences.  Still not bad and anything Karloff is in is always worth a look.
The Four Skulls of Jonathan Drake is a pretty good 50's horror film.  Nearly two hundred years before a South American tribe of head-hunters laid a whammy on the male members of the family of a conqueror that decimated the natives.  At the beginning of the film the curse has taken three heads and is working on a fourth.  A weird doctor and a six and a half foot creepy native are the ones doing the dirty work.  The doctor is a revived shaman with the body of a native with the head of a sacrificed white man sewn on.  As I said, WEIRD.  The native must be a revived native also with, get this, a sewn up mouth.  Seems their black magic has a soupcon of voodoo thrown in.  It also seems that two hundred years is a LONG time to work on this curse and have nothing but three to four skulls to show for it.  Still, entertaining and the better of the two films.  The Midnite Movies DVD is excellent quality.  One thing, the sound seems rather low and I had to amp up the volume to be able to hear the dialogue.  Other than that highly recommended.",1486252800,2,2224,4.612244897959184
