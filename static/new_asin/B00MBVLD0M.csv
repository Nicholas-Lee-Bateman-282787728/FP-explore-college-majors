6567856,4,B00MBVLD0M,"Be prepared of silly effects and silly acting and silly story telling and enjoy yourself. This was made in 1965 and it involves 2 spaceships form where? we don't know, travelling thru space in answer to a distress call of some kind. This is an Italian production so the English is Dubbed, fairly well for the time except for the American Actor Barry Sullivan. This really has nothing to do with Vampires at all, so put that out of your mind. There are energy beings (balls of light) with no form so they are stuck on this planet that is going to be destroyed when the sun goes nova. They inhabit the dead bodies of the dead people that have died or killed each other on these 2 ships. Do not expect great or you will be disappointed. This is another movie where you just go blank and go for the ride. The acting isn't good that is for sure but....",1415491200,2,847,4.267080745341615

6567858,5,B00MBVLD0M,"I am relieved! I was afraid that Kino, in an effort to appeal to a contemporary audience, might tamper with Bava's original color pallet (as they did with their blu ray release of ""The Whip And The Body""). Too many blu ray releases of older films are given a darker, dingier look by applying a teal-colored tint (compare the dvd and blu releases of ""All The President's Men""). They often mute the intended vibrant colors because they think the original look of a film is dated and doesn't conform with current tastes. Thankfully they did not do that here. The film looks FANTASTIC! The bright colors pop and they never bleed into one-another. GREAT!",1415145600,24,649,4.701754385964913
6567859,5,B00MBVLD0M,"Just finished watching ""Planet Of The Vampires"" released by American International.
Director Mario Bava is perhaps one of the most overlooked movie directors of the 1960s.  I will freely admit that when ""Planet Of The Vampires"" first popped up on my reccomendation list at Amazon.com, I was more than a bit skeptical - which my dear sister and devoted minions will be shocked to learn, because as Jeff H.; a.k.a. Minion #2 is always fond of saying:  ""Come on Joseph, if it's says 'cult following,' in the liner notes, I know its going to be in your collection sooner or later.""
Lurid title aside, ""Planet Of The Vampires"" is perhpas one of the best low budget science fiction films from the 1960s that I've seen to date.
Based on the short story ""One Night of 21 Hours"" by Renato Pestriniero - which is included in the DVD extras - ""Planet Of The Vampires"" starts out as a simple story of two interstellar ships out on a two year voyage from their home planet in answer  to a distant distress signal scientists picked up.  Their arrival at the planet ends in disaster as one of the ships crash killing all the crew aboard and the crew of the remaining ship survives a rough landing at 40gs only to go momentarily insane and attempt to kill each other..
The crew snaps out of their blood lust  and slowly come to realize that they are not alone on this alien world - despite the sudden absence of the signal that brought them there.
Exploration of the surrounding landscape reveals another crashed  ship of an unknown alien species.  Now here is where ""Planet Of The Vampires"" gets really interesting.  Ridley Scott has denied that he has seen this movie, but there are unmistakable parallels between this movie and the Alien Movies - especailly with the  skeletons of giant aliens at their ship controls.
Bava builds steadily towards a horrifying climax - it's nerve wracking when you watch and listen as the captain records in the ship's log that he is scared but that he is trying to put on a brave front for his crew.
As for the ""vampires"" - that's a little misleading...they are more of the mind parasite variety than the blood sucking ones.
Looking at the movie with a 21st century prospective, I was stunned that Bava envisioned form fitting space suits that allowed his astronaut explorers to function in a variety of environments - much like the exo-suits being created and made today for the next generation of astronauts.
Also interesting in this movie is that the two female crewmembers are pilots and engineers - not typical roles for women in 1960s space movies.
""Planet Of The Vampires"" is a brillantly effective piece of science fiction horror that is engrossing and a bit unnerving to watch as it unfolds.  It pushes all the right buttons with a minimum of gore and special effects..
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!
FIVE STARS!",1414972800,20,2833,4.682092555331992
6567860,5,B00MBVLD0M,"I was first introduced to the Planet of the Vampires several years ago when it came out on a Midnite Movie DVD.  I was expecting a really cheesy film like most of the sci-fi produced during that era.  As I watched it, I was amazed at the similarities between it and one of my favorite sic-fi horror titles.  From the ""U"" shaped spaceship, to the call from an alien planet, to the way the exhaust from the landing spaceship pluming up around the ship.  If you haven't guessed, I'm talking about Ridley Scott's original classic, ""Alien"".  Even the design of the planet's surface is similar.  Now, I'm not saying that Ridley Scott completely copied this film, but it is evident that it served as an inspiration.  After all, while the images may be alike, the stories are quite different.  Actually, Scott claims to have never seen this film.  If you're simply expecting a good cheesy sic-fi horror flick, you may be pleasantly surprised as I was to find that it's actually quite a good film.  Aside from getting a really good film with this package, you also get a big upgrade from the DVD.  The picture is amazingly sharp and clear.  Considering this is not a major title, I was quite surprised to find a good handful of extras on this new HD release.  You get an audio commentary, some trailers, two short features titled Trailers from Hell with Joe Dante and one with Josh Olson.  While these are only about 3 min. each, there is a lot of information packed into them.  There is also a still gallery, alternate music opening highlights, original Italian opening credit, and the entire original shorty story by Renato Pestriniero.  With all of these features, it is now clear why the price is a little higher than I originally expected when I first heard this gem was coming to Blu-ray.  If you've never seen this movie before, and you like a good creepy, atmospheric film, I would suggest you check it out.  If you have the old DVD, then I suggest you use it as a coaster and invest in this upgrade.  If you're a fan of the film, you definitely will not be disappointed.",1414713600,43,2070,4.53099730458221

6567865,4,B00MBVLD0M,"Just a general warning: ""Planet of the Vampires"" has no vampires in it. Not even vampire-like aliens.

But if you can get past the issue of there being no Space Dracula, then ""Planet of the Vampires"" is unlikely to disappoint. This little cult movie is more like a hybrid of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and ""Alien,"" especially the heavy, haunting dread that hangs over it -- and though it has the same ray guns and hokey spaceships as many other sci-fi movies, Mario Bava gives it a gothic quality that few others had.

When they pick up a distress call, the captains of the starships Argos and Galliott decide to land on the planet Aura, so they can assist whoever is stranded there. But during the Argos' descent, the crew is suddenly seized by the desire to strangle each other to death, and only the intervention of Captain Markary (Barry Sullivan) is able to snap them out of it. To make matters even worse, they discover that the crew of the Galliott wasn't so lucky. All of them are dead.

As they repair their damaged ship, the crew begin to suspect that something strange and terrible is happening on Aura. Sleepwalking, vanishing corpses, ghostly visions and a string of murders haunt them, and the discovery of a strange alien spaceship indicates that this has happened many times in the past. Something terrible and cruel is alive on Aura -- and unless they can escape soon, the crew may suffer a fate worse than death.

""Planet of the Vampires"" is a movie that sounds like it should be hilariously cheesy at best, and simply bad at worst. After all, this is a sci-fi movie from the 1960s, which contains bodily possession, zombies, ray guns, rocketships, and a Star-Trek-like planetary set. But Mario Bava was a maestro of the horror genre, and he gave ""Planet of the Vampires"" a hauntingly creepy atmosphere that few other sci-fi movies can match.

Part of this comes from the creepy setting, which is full of fog, gore-splattered corpses and the half-buried skeletons of ancient aliens. Little by little, Bava reveals how very screwed the crew is, and that this nightmarish scenario is not a random accident. But it's also HOW he reveals this -- through glimpses of the dead walking in the distance, through glimpses of something out of the corner of your eye, through a crushing claustrophobia that settles around the shadowy, dark spaceship like the mist. It gives everything a magnificently gothic feel.

And despite the low budget, Bava managed to make Aura a genuinely scary place -- the artfully-placed alien skeleton and the constant rolling fog give the standard alien planet set a creepy look. The one part of the movie that doesn't quite work is the futuristic vinyl jumpsuits, whose collars are so high and stiff that they would keep the wearers from effectively turning their heads.

The various actors all do an excellent job, especially Sullivan as the fatherly captain who fears that his entire crew is going to end up dead, but isn't entirely sure what he can do to protect them. Norma Bengell, Angel Aranda, Evi Marandi, Ivan Rassimov and Massimo Righi are all solid, whether they are playing increasingly desperate crewmen or cold-blooded zombies. Perhaps the only problem with the acting is is that it's a bit too easy to spot when someone is possessed.

""Planet of the Vampires"" has no vampires, but it does have a solid cast and skin-crawlingly creepy story -- especially for those who like their horror and sci-fi to have a slow, suspenseful burn. Just try to ignore the hokey title and covers.",1481068800,,3536,4.775777414075287

For those who haven't seen this, this is a great sci fi flick with tons of atmosphere and a great sense of art design for the costumes and the sets. There's an obvious stylistic influence here to the Alien series. This is a slow burn kind of film, but that just builds tension. If the world was a fairer place, this would be on the great retro sci fi list alongside Forbidden Planet and War of the Worlds. The strangest thing about the whole experience is the title. There isn't a vampire in the whole flick. I guess the Italian title was Terror In Space, which is far more appropriate.

6567895,4,B00MBVLD0M,"This review is mainly for fans of the movie who want to know how the Kino Blu-ray release compares to previous DVD versions.  I've had the MGM Midnite Movies DVD for many years, and have watched it several times.  Although I did not do a back-to-back comparison, I am familiar enough with the DVD to say that the Blu-ray transfer is only a slight improvement.  The increased resolution is notable in the close-ups of the actors, but really kind of lost in the already-murky dark scenes on the planet surface.  Don't get me wrong; the atmosphere of those scenes is generally quite creepy, and I wouldn't want to see TOO much and ruin the mood.  But I did expect them to be a little clearer.

The best thing about this release may be the commentary track by Tim Lucas, well-known to genre fans as the publisher of ""Video Watchdog.""  His knowledge of the film and how it was made is very impressive.  After listening to his stories, one wonders that the film ever got made at all, as the production was plagued with obstacles.

There's also the short story upon which the film was based, but I have to confess I got bored rather quickly with the amateurish writing style.  You also get the film's fun (but not restored at all) theatrical trailer, and a couple of too-brief interviews with Joe Dante and some other guy with whom I was not familiar.  Dante comes across as a real fan of both director Mario Bava and the film itself, so it would have been nice to have maybe a ""making of"" featurette with Dante as the host.

If you don't already have Planet of the Vampires on DVD, the Blu-ray is definitely the way to go.  And if you're a fan, you'll probably want it for the extras.  I will say again that Tim Lucas' commentary is incredibly insightful, and made this worth the purchase for me.  But I still think the picture quality could have been improved more, so it's 4 stars from me.",1419465600,15,1885,4.438953488372093

Anyone who is into the Alien film franchise will want this film. This film was such an influence on the later film that it is in my opinion undeniable.

BLU-RAY: The picture quality if just OK. I didn't find it to be a whole lot better than the standard DVD release by MGM Midnite Movies that came out years before this release. It is still the best picture so this is the way to go if you want the best picture available. I still think there is room for improvement. I've seen better from color science fiction and horror movies released in the same time period. The picture is clean and you don't see any imperfections like dust, lines, etc. The picture is just a little too soft for me. I don't know if it's possible to do better, maybe that is just the way it was shot. I'm not an expert in these things so it's possible this is as good as it can be done.

EXTRA'S: There are quite a few extra's here. They are:
-There is a commentary track by film historian Tim Lucas. Lucas wrote the definitive biography on the director of 'Planet of the Vampires,' Mario Bava called 'Mario Bava - All the Colors of the Dark.'
- There are two 'Trailer from Hell.' One by Joe Dante and the other by Josh Olson.
-The original short story that this movie is based on is presented as an extra for you to click your way through.
- Stills gallery
- There is an alternate Italian soundtrack that is presented as an extra. It highlights about 20 minutes of the score.
- The original opening titles in Italian is presented here and is a little under 3 minutes long.
- The original American trailer
- The inside cover of the Blu-Ray case packaging has images of the movie poster from many other countries.

5 stars for the extra's.

PLOT/SUMMARY: Two space ships receive a distress signal somewhere in deep space. When the ships arrive at the planet giving off the signal, they get pulled to the planet by an unknown source. Only Captain Mark (Barry Sullivan) of the Argos is able to resist being knocked unconscious. Once they land, everybody except Captain Mark becomes extremely violent and start attacking each other. At the moment, the fate of the sister ship is unknown. Somehow, Mark is able to shake everyone from their trance. The ship is damaged and needs repairs. It will be a few days before they can attempt a take off.

Several crew members go out looking for the other ship. When they find it they discover that everyone is dead. They appear to have killed each other. Some of the member were locked inside and they bury three members.

Some of the members of the Argos are discovered dead. Then dead bodies start disappearing. The dead bodies are being used as host bodies for native beings that are sort of energy like beings. Their planet is dying and they want a way off the planet. The remainder of the movie deals with the astronauts trying to get off the planet.

PRODUCTION: 'Planet of the Vampires' was release as a double feature with 'Die Monster Die' in 1965.

This production was a joint production between American International Pictures and Italian International films. A third company from Spain was brought into the production to provide some money.

According to Tim Lucas, Barry Sullivan was the only lead who was older than the director, Mario Bava, when the movie was shot. Bava was not happy about being forced to use Sullivan and Sullivan was not happy being forced to do this film.

Lucas also says that although Bava is known as a horror director his real passion was science fiction and he directed the first Italian science fiction film, 'The Day the Sky Exploded.'(Although Bava directed this film he is not on the credits)

The screenplay was written by Ib Melchior who wrote several other classic science fiction films,The Angry Red Planet,  Reptilicus, Journey to the Seventh Planet, The Time Travelers and Death Race 2000.

Most of the actors were not American and had accents or were not speaking English so most were dubbed. One of the voices is obviously the voice of the cartoon 'Speed Racer.' There were several different languages being spoken.

The space ship itself was not bad but appeared to be much too large for practical space travel. The ships carried only 9 astronauts and the space inside the ships was cavernous and empty. Yes, I know, it's nitpicking.

THOUGHTS/COMMENTS:  This movie has been called the inspiration for Ridley Scott's Alien. I am not convinced that this is true. Although it's possible the screenwriter may have seen this movie and got some idea's.
The space ships in question answer a signal from a planet and when they land they discover an alien spaceship that is not native to the planet. The alien's appear to have landed a long time ago and are giant in stature in comparison to humans. These plot points are very similar to 'Alien.'
I personally feel that 'It, The Terror from Beyond Space' is more likely to be the source of inspiration for 'Alien' but it is entirely possible that both  movies factored in. The basic plot of 'It' is the same as 'Alien.' An alien creature gets on board a space ship and murders crew members.

'Planet of the Vampires' is not a good title. This production had many different titles in different countries and the working title during production was changed many times. Some people think 'Planet of the Zombies' would be a better title. But really, if you wanted to name it that then 'Planet of the Living Dead' would be even better. In today's day and age, zombies have been erroneously named. Most movies today use the living dead, not zombies. They just call them zombies.

I loved the atmospheric sets. They had very little money and did a great job with what little they had.

I'm not sure how Mark was able to resist the aliens when the ships were forced down. I don't believe this was explained. I also didn't like how easily he got everyone out of their trance. This was not explained. Why didn't the alien's just hypnotize everyone again?

The discovery of the alien space ship seemed almost like padding. It was an interesting scene but didn't really have much to do with the story. The only thing they discover is that the alien ship was not native. I thought the escape from the ship was figured out much too easily. Then again, time constraints probably forced this decision.

Captain Mark makes many questionable decisions. He unnecessarily leaves crew members alone many times. Why would it be necessary to take 3 people to go back and forth with him between ships and leave just one person by themselves? Obviously, this did not bode well.

Even if the crew from the other ship killed each other, there still should have been one left alive.

I found the abilities of the aliens to be baffling. You see them flying in space so I'm not sure what they are capable of. I'm not sure how they possessed living beings. If they could do this why didn't they just do this from the start rather than killing people?
What about the derelict alien ship? Why didn't they possess those alien's?

I did not like the ending and it felt forced. There just didn't seem to be any logic to the end sequence.

RECOMMENDATIONS: This movie is highly recommended for fans of 60's science fiction and fans of the director Mario Bava.

I would have given it 5 stars but the picture just wasn't good enough for 5 stars. Everything else was top notch and I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. The extra's are 5 stars. The picture gets 3 stars. I'm given the plot 3 1/2 stars. I love atmospheric films and I'm given this 5 stars for atmosphere.",1514851200,3,7493,4.576549663928304

8671551,4,B00MBVLD0M,"I first saw this movie after having seen ""Alien"" on the Oakland CA broadcast of ""Creature Features"". Certainly commercials disrupted the mood of Mario Bava's atmospheric thriller ""Planet of the Vampires"". It's really all about mood, Bava's creative camera choices and the unusual art direction/design of the costumes for the film.

The crew of the spaceship Argos finds itself on an unexpected rescue mission when their sister ship The Galliott sends a distress call to them after being sent to investigate a distress call from an unknown source on an uncharted planet. When the Argos arrives Captain Markary (Barry Sullivan) discovers that the crew of the Galliott are dead. It appears that they, like the Argos, had crew members attack each other in some sort of mutiny. After burying their dead on the planet, Markary and his crew find the bodies vanish suggesting that they aren't the only ones on the planet.

Bava does a creative job of covering up the low budget of the film and the unusual visual effects, use of forced perspective sets, in camera visual effects to combine miniatures with the soundstage planet's surface all give ""Vampires"" a much bigger feel for this Italian production. Featuring American actor Barry Sullivan and a cast that all spoke Italian (except for Sullivan's co-star Norma Bengell who learned her lines phonetically to better interact with Sullivan who she shares a lot of scenes with), the film holds up due to Bava's inspired choices since not much really happens for much of the film.

The biggest bit of trivia about this film is, at least partially true, regarding its influence on ""Alien"". While Ridley Scott claims to never have seen the film, it's clear that ""Alien"" writer Dan O'Bannon was influenced by Bava's film (who seems like he was influenced by Richard Matheson's story and ""Twilight Zone"" episode ""Third From The Sun"" as well) and ""It! The Terror From Beyond Space"". ""Alien"" combines the plot of both films and, with O'Bannon's unique take on the alien lifeform, provided the genesis for that classic film. On a side note, Bava's film was obviously watched by a writer for ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" because they use much the same plot for an episode of the series.

Regardless, this moody film is still quite a bit of fun even if the pacing is a bit turgid.

The Blu-ray features a very nice transfer where the colors are rich along with very nice detail. Pulled from a newer high def transfer, depth and textures look marvelous here. The original MGM DVD looked Ok but lacked ALL of the above in terms of quality.

We get a mono soundtrack in English as the only audio option which is too bad--I would have loved to hear the Italian version and compare the two. It's clear that the dialog was dubbed later. While there isn't a lot of lip flap, it does occasionally occur. We also get subtitles in English.

The special features are limited but what we do get is pretty terrific. Bava biographer Tim Lucas provides the commentary track and provides an exceptional amount of detail on Bava and the production as well as the U.S. reception when American International Pictures released it for the U.S. market. At one time, when HBO acquired  the home video rights they didn't get the music the music rights for the film and paid for a new music track composed by Kendall Schmidt. The previous DVD had the correct music track. Twenty minutes of that ""new"" music is included here for comparison and it's nice that it hasn't been forgotten when the original music was added back to the mix. We also get Joe Dante in a ""Trailers From Hell"" segment, the original theatrical trailer, another ""Trailers From Hell"" with Josh Olson, the original Italian titles (which are quite a contrast to the American titles), a still gallery AND the short story by Renato Pestriniero that Bava used for his screenplay.

""Planet of The Vampires"" is an eerie, atmospheric mixture of science fiction and horror. Bava does a stellar job (and even uses some ideas for shots in later films as well as compositions) creating an original film. For a film made in 1965 before the jump in quality visual effects that occurred with ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", the visuals are vivid and remarkably original. They may not be up to those standards but they work for the film.",1493683200,,4296,4.7867746288798925
8671552,3,B00MBVLD0M,Great HD transfer of a mediocre movie.  Claiming that Ridley Scott ripped this off for his Alien is a bit of stretch.  It's like saying Michael Jackson ripped off Pachelbel for Beat It.  Puleeeeze!,1493596800,,197,4.735294117647059
8671553,3,B00MBVLD0M,"Bava had all the tools it took to create stunning visuals. In Planet of the Vampires, eerie atmospherics dominate, aided by arresting color schemes, bold sets, and mystifying lighting. All of these features prepare the viewer for something cinematically spectacular with the kind of suspense liable to drive most filmgoers crazy with curiosity and anticipation. However, in Planet of the Vampires, heavy suspense soon palls when the sequence of events remain in a kind of cyclic limbo throughout the course of the film.

The drama unfolds when a sudden, inexplicable dynamic gravitational pull causes a space crew to become heavily rooted to the floor of their spacecraft. This scene turns out to be a chucklesome one since most of the actors do a paltry job of convincing the audience that this activity is actually occurring. What happens next is beyond anyone's understanding when various crewmembers begin attacking each other with zombie-like aggression. This curious activity instills a growing apprehension of what's to come, but the problem is that nothing much comes. The suspense continues to build, yet the drama stays fixed in a deja-vu-like state having only arresting images to carry the audience through.

Barry Sullivan and Norma Bengell give better than average performances, but the rest of the cast are worse than what you might find in the Batman tv series of the 60's. The space lingo is laughable and likewise comparable to what you'd hear in a Batman episode. Even more coincidental is the fact that &Aacute;ngel Aranda's overdubbed voice sounds strikingly similar to Burt Ward's. While Aranda's character (Wes) is in a hypnotic stupor, he's confronted by other crewmembers and questioned in urgent, mock-desperation: ""Wes, why did you disconnect the meteor deflector?!&iquest;!?"" Why Wes...WHY?!!! It's one of the most memorable lines in the film. Expect to be mildly amused and mesmerized by some shots, but not much more.",1491609600,,1947,5.257234726688103
8671554,5,B00MBVLD0M,"This is an incredible film whose influence on Alien is only denied by the film makers themselves. That influence is mostly visual and the movie is very good, which makes watching it far more than an intellectual exercise. There is a human crew stranded on an alien planet. There is a dead crew of aliens who fell victim to forces the human crew will soon encounter. There is a spaceship with an unmistakable horseshoe shape. There is a tough female officer who is every bit an equal to the fellas on the crew. The film is beautifully shot classic scifi of the early sixties. Lots of good ideas, limited but incredibly effective special effects, and a twist ending that was a great deal of fun. The commentary by Tim Lucas is excellent and especially valuable because the special effects really need to be explained to realize how impressive they are. If you like classic scifi, can handle the pacing and occasional hokeyness of a mid sixties action film you are in for a treat.",1491264000,,977,4.620689655172414
