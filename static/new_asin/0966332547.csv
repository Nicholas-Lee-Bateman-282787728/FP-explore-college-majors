Yes I know it's VHS but what can  you do? This story is engaging, exciting and has some great lessons for the kids.",1362787200,,280,4.0
7793879,4,0966332547,"Funny name, great film!  My three year old cousin is absolutely is crazy about this video!  This is a very solid new entry onto the children's video scene.  ""Pahappahooey Island"" is geared towards kids, but is  definitely clever enough for adults.  The production values are very high  (it looks like it was shot on film), and the characters have a lot of,  well....character!  The cast of characters include a high-strung penguin, a  fumbling hard-of-hearing beaver, and a peg-leg sea-going frog.  All the  characters are puppets.  This little movie is very entertaining, and  (unlike ""Barney"") you won't mind watching it with your kids over  and over! -N. Hood Hillsdale, MI",950745600,2,676,5.08256880733945
