4320087,2,B004BR7XGM,"VThe main actor in this movie is Djimon Hounsou, not Kevin Bacon. Djimon Hounsou isn't the most versatile actor, and the producers probably failed to notice that. Kevin Bacon's accent seems like a joke in this movie.

Djimon's character is always out trying to get new guns, and threatens to shoot if he doesn't get his guns and does it in a very unconvincing way everytime. The fighting/shooting choreography was horrible, so even if you're looking for an action movie and don't care about the storyline this would still be disappointing.",1310256000,,539,4.923076923076923
4320088,5,B004BR7XGM,Excellent acting and action packed into a gripping five star story (that sadly touches truth in our real world). This film draws you in and doesn't let you go even after it's over. Truly great movie.,1307577600,,199,4.555555555555555
4320089,4,B004BR7XGM,"This movie potentially has the highest body count of any move I've ever seen (if we're counting the ""dream"" sequence).  It's very well acted, scripted, and filmed for a b movie and it's definitely action packed if you're into seeing a guy go to town with a knife and a handgun in the woods.

I agree with the guy writing previously that these direct to dvd movies are starting to get close (if not surpassing) the quality/entertainment of theater movies.  Absolutely worth a rental if you like action movies.",1307145600,,508,4.685393258426966
4320090,4,B004BR7XGM,"Djimon Hounsou is a killing machine that you can't take your eyes off of.  He really delivers in this film, and keeps the viewer engaged during the fast paced action.

It's always nice to see Kevin Bacon, and his charter adds to this movie in an almost comedic way. Balancing out the action.

All in all, a nice gritty shoot them up film, with a nice twist at the end, that's fun to watch.",1306627200,,389,4.22972972972973
4320091,4,B004BR7XGM,"Can you save someone by using a gun?  When mercenary Curtie Church (Hounsou) is hired to take out the head of a human trafficking ring he finds himself not sure who's side he is on.  When a girl named Meg finds him, he has another reason to stop the ring.  This is a great action movie. Guy hires guy to kill someone, guy gets guns, starts killing...for an hour and a half.  If you like movies with intricate plot lines and in-depth character development, this is not it.  If you like non stop action, guns and fighting, this is the movie for you.  The acting is actually pretty good, led by Djimon Hounsou and Kevin Bacon, but the action is what drives the movie.  Very few action movies have a twist at the end that makes you want to re-watch right away to see if you can catch the moments that lead up to the twist, this is one of them.  I'd be surprised if anyone can predict the twist to this.  Very entertaining action movie that is worth watching.  I give it a B+.

Would I watch again? - Yes I would to see if I can catch the twist moments I missed.

4320092,3,B004BR7XGM,"Millennium gets another lower budget straight-to-DVD/BD title this month, but having such big budget films as The Expendables and the new Conan, they obviously have access to the nice cameras.

The story follows Hounsou's assassin character in Thailand as he decides to kill a bunch of bad guys. Kevin Bacon (who has the single WORST accent I have heard in years) plays the gun-running buddy/sidekick. The story has some razor thin plot lines as to why any of this is actually happening or why they keep killing when the story ran out long before, but Hounsou gives a concerted effort here and proves he is better than the whole of what was trying to get accomplished.

There are no special features and the TrueHD was mixed average to horribly (a lot of bad voice dubbing and remixing). But the picture quality is what sells this. The majority of the film is at night with a great deal of action and killing, so even with plenty of chances to falter it does not. The lines are solid, there is no grain and the lighting actually shines perfectly (for the scenes that were being made anyway). Some nice footage of Bangkok is preserved here and might be worth the watch for the fans of Hounsou and/or Bangkok films.

The cover art is incorrect: (Hounsou and Bacon never look like that in the movie - both with facial hair and clothing) that gun/scope is never in the film, and it says Region 1; three strikes or more on cover art shows to me they could care less about marketing the film. 1.5 stars for the film and 1.5 for the picture clarity. A renter at most as the final twist they throw at you gives the film some credibility over being a skipper.",1305417600,,1650,4.493333333333333
4320093,4,B004BR7XGM,"I picked up an early copy of this from my local DVD vendor.  Kevin Bacon and Djimon Hounsou are obviously the big draw here.
Straight to DVD fair is getting better and better as of late, and this one is no exception.  The DVD is a bare bones affair no bells and whistles, but the direction, cinematography, sound and foley work is all top notch, and the acting is stellar!  The story is of Hounsou who it's alluded to as being a USA government agent who is on a holiday in Bangkok and moonlighting as a hired gun.  He is hired by a desperate father to avenge his daughter, and all hell breaks loose.  Hounsou is a strong lead, and dominates the screen.  Kevin Bacon plays an old acquaintance of Djimon's character and a weapons dealer in Bangkok, a very solid supporting role to say the least.  And Jirantanin Pitakporntrakul, in her debut role is creepy and radiant simultaneously.  Prachya Pinkaew, whom I've been a big fan of since his film ""CHOCOLATE"" has done it again providing his fans with the best in fight choreography and fun fast paced action sequences.
The story though not completely original has enough original aspects to it to keep you wrapped in it's threads for the thrill ride that this movie is.  White Elephant is a white knuckled thrill ride that is action packed and bloody as hell.  It's not for the faint of heart..but hits the spot for all of us action fans...and is an awesome addition to Prachya Pinkaew's filmography and another step toward cinematic immortality for this growing and very active director.",1304380800,27,1535,4.630996309963099
4320094,4,B004BR7XGM,"In the movie a white elephant is given by one rival gang to another as a peace offering. In Siam, kings would offer them as gifts to someone who was obnoxious so they would go broke attempting the up keep. The movie deals with the child prostitution trafficking in Thailand as a background, but does very little to expose the horrors, but rather concentrates on killing.

A man hires Djmon Hounsou to find his abducted daughter working somewhere in a Thai brothel. He also has a bounty for every bad guy that is killed. Djmon contacts Kevin Bacon, now with a British accent, in order to obtain guns. Bacon runs a legit brothel and formally worked with Djmon. Using the weapons, Hounsou is able to start a war between two rival gangs. The head count increases.

During his campaign, a girl joins up with him and helps him with some spiritual guidance, as well as a look out. There are minor twists as people and alliances are not quite what they seem, with one major twist at the end I admit I didn't see coming.

There is a missed opportunity in this film for a little humor. Kevin Bacon collects guns used in movies. What they should have mentioned were guns used specifically in Bacon movies. They did not.

Hounsou play a stone cold killer who wants to make things right while getting paid. His acting ability is better than the Rock, but below that of Van Diesel. A lot of shooting and killing. Nudity, f-bomb, and Bacon with a British accent. 3 1/2 stars.",1303689600,7,1460,4.49811320754717

4320178,3,B004BR7XGM,"Human trafficking and child prostitution are the focal points of this very dark, noisy, brutally frank film, and if those preliminary adjectives don't deter then there are a few reasons to watch this direct to DVD film, mainly the contribution of producer/star Djimon Hounsou.  Thai director Prachya Pinkaew holds this slaughter of the bad guys together fairly well and the minimal script by Kevin Bernhardt attempts to infuse the bitter story with a dollop of mysticism (the title is the clue).  The acting by a very large cast of Thai actors is basically relegated to shooting and getting shot so there isn't a lot of character development possible.

The setting is Bangkok where Curtie Church (Djimon Hounsou) who is a prolific professional assassin who has accumulating a sizable cash reserve from his trade. His impressive store of weapons (a larger cash of bizarre guns has never been so visible!) is provided by his English arms dealer Jimmy (Kevin Bacon). Curtie wishes to retire from his sordid role and is on his last assignment when he is joined by a strange and beautiful young girl name Mae (Jirantanin Pitakporntrakul). During the completion of his final score, Curtie is annoyed by Mae who wonders why the assassin is killing in the first place. Curtie admits it is for the money, but the somewhat ethereal Mae informs him that other evil men need his expertise and brand of justice: Curtie becomes involved in a mission to stop the trafficking of child prostitutes by eliminating those who deal in human flesh.

For the most part the film is about killing and is a constant stream of assassinations by a variety to weapons and chases. Hounsou is solid, manages to capture some tenderness in his relationship with Pitakporntrakul, and the efforts to make the film have mystical effects almost works at times.  Kevin Bacon does his best in a thankless role but is bogged down with a twitchy British accent. This is definitely not a film for the easily disturbed, but for proponents of action and mounting killings the film should satisfy. And it does address the ongoing global problem of sex trafficking. Maybe someone will notice this problem soon. Grady Harp, March 13",1362787200,,2185,4.9105691056910565

4320183,3,B004BR7XGM,"This is set in Bangkok and tells the story of Curtie Church (Djimon Hounsou) who is a hired `hit man'. He has been hired by a distraught father whose daughter has been abducted by some drug gang where by they turn her into an addict as her introduction to being trafficked onto the sex industry. Where she winds up on a mortuary slab.

So as retribution he pays him to kill six for a fixed bounty. Church duly obliges and attracts the attention of one of the girls, who follows him and becomes a sort of partner, Mae. The grieving father then asks for a bit more revenge and Church is starting to feel empathy for the girls so he signs up. This time he needs some new weaponry and where better to go than an International Arms Dealer in the shape of Jimmy `The Brit' (Kevin Bacon) who after an initial reticence agrees to hire some kick butt guns that the army would be proud of. A word on Mr Bacon, I have immense respect for him as an actor, but he really could have done with a language coach on his Mary Poppins attempts at an English accent. It is dubbed at one point and then he starts to sound like a lost Australian, pretty poor and verging on the embarrassing.

Meanwhile Churchy has declared war on the gangs who have formed an uneasy alliance to find out who is killing them all. Church and Mae take up residence at a Buddhist Temple which he uses to launch his attacks from and we get lots of Eastern wisdom from the ephemeral Mae.

This is a very full on action film, the action is pretty much there right from the start and is actually really good though not gratuitous. There are a few twists in the plot but nothing heart stopping and some nudity but mainly incidental which you would expect in a film of this nature. The few plot holes are forgivable until the end and that is where you have to do a rather large leap of faith to believe what has happened, I can not say what, as it is a plot spoiler. So for a ninety minute action fest with some decent plot and questionable accents, this is the one for you. If you can live with that and the plot holes then you should enjoy, but I felt it was just OK, hence the rating but will still give Mr Bacon another chance as he still tends to deliver in most of his films.",1332374400,2,2233,4.188372093023256

4320200,2,B004BR7XGM,"""Elephant White"" has almost everything that you might expect from a low-budget straight-to-DVD action movie: some so-so action scenes including so-so shoot-outs; average and all-too-brief car chase (with quick cuts), murky cinematography, authentic location (shot in Thailand), average-to-poor acting from the main cast, and fast but incoherent storytelling. What you don't have is the usual B list action stars. Instead of them, you get two names, Djimon Hounsou and Kevin Bacon.

""Elephant White"" stars twice Oscar nominee Djimon Hounsou (""In America"" ""Blood Diamond"") as Curtie Church, who works as a mercenary/contract killer in Bangkok. He takes a job from a Thai businessman Rajahdon (Sahajak Boonthanakit), whose daughter is kidnapped and murdered by a local gang. Kevin Bacon plays Jimmy, an arms dealer with a Jason Statham-like accent, who reluctantly collaborates with Church.

The script is so confusing and often frustratingly underwritten that we are not allowed to know our hero's motive for what he does in the first place. It even attempts to weave serious social issues like human trafficking into the thin story by introducing a mysterious girl named Mae (Jirantanin Pitakporntrakul), a drug addict and former prostitute, who witnesses Church killing the targets. Their relationship lacks any emotional punch and the film's weak conclusion (with a twist or two) is just weird.

""Elephant White"" is directed by Prachya Pinkaew, best known for Tony Jaa films ""Ong Bak"" and ""Warrior King"" as well as ""Chocolate"" starring JeeJa Yanin. He has an eye for action and ""Elephant White"" certainly shows that, but he relies too much on actors' and stunt persons' skills in action set-pieces. There is not any logical flow or continuity between the action sequences, which as a result become much less thrilling and suspenseful than they should be.

""Elephant White"" is not a terrible film, but like its hero, it doesn't know what it really wants to do.",1316044800,,1960,5.292604501607717

The plot was dodgy and I actually had to watch it in two segments because I couldn't will myself to sit through the whole thing in one shot. Kevin Bacon's horrible British accent and poor acting really makes me re-evaluate him as an actor. The whole premise of the film was predictable and the violence and action scenes were never fluid or purposeful. The main character of the story, Church, manages to evade bullets and when he does, he heals magically and is ready for combat by the next day. The only reason I would watch the movie is for the cool guns. Otherwise it was a giant waste of time.",1315872000,,638,4.415254237288136
4320202,4,B004BR7XGM,"This is an unusual movie. Not entirely action/thriller, not entirely surreal/eastern philosophy.

Very much enjoyed because of both aspects: The hardcore one-man-special-forces-wrecking-crew, which was really good. And the ... other element. No spoilers, but it caught me off-guard and that unexpected slice of the evanescent really spun a stock plotline and flung it into an interesting tale of pure revenge and eternal devotion.

I've mentioned elsewhere what a fantastic badass Djimon Hounsou is when portraying a gunslinger/sword swinger. The guy is solid steel, an absolutely no doubt rock-steady dude. I'm very grateful to any production company and director that can see his ability to carry the load as sole lead. He doesn't need to sidekick with another more recognizable actor as 'insurance'. Sadly, this ability isn't recognized by many and hence we're often left with half a performance. That's not to say that's all bad, his stints with Leo DiCaprio in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Diamond/dp/B00005JPGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood Diamond</a>' and Russell Crowe in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gladiator/dp/B00003CXE7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gladiator</a>' were very good. But half is always half - and his onscreen presence can deliver so much more.

And Kevin Bacon's turn as an British expatriate arms dealers equals that of his homosexual informant in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JFK/dp/B001DJ7PN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JFK</a>' - a nuanced and amusingly slimy performance that somehow makes likable an unlikable and difficult character. These jobs are usually tasked to a Steve Buscemi-type so I was surprised at how good he was in the role. I hope he takes on more of these as I'm intrigued at the possibilities of the one-time pretty boy finding equal success as a character actor.

There seems to be no end to the amazing beauties that populate the Thai film industry - Jirantanin Pitakporntrakul is pretty much par for the course, if par is stunningly delicious.

That this production was staged outside of the US may be a silver lining to Honsou's career. There was a time when six-pack actors like Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson left Hollywood for the dry deserts of Spain and found career rebirths. I like to think that these asian studios are the modern equivalent for many actors and directors. Having just missed the 'spaghetti western' period - this is my chance to experience this kind of so-called ""backwater"" culturally collaborative filmmaking.

I'm honestly looking forward to more.",1315094400,,3091,6.365155131264917

4320204,3,B004BR7XGM,"Making a movie, even a cheap crappy movie, is a long process. A lot of decisions have to be made. So my question is: How do you make a movie like this, with a couple of big name stars, and make so many stupid decisions?

Here's the scoop. Djimon Hounsou is an ex-operative on hire from a father to wipe out a gang of Bangkokian sex traffickers who did his baby girl bad. He finds himself with a mysterious, young, female sidekick, and before you can say Bangkokian sex traffickers, he finds himself in the middle of a gang war. He approaches another British ex-operative, played by Kevin Bacon, to supply the arms to win said war.

If there was really a need to make the arms dealer British then why not hire a Brit to play the role? It didn't seem germane to the story so why not make Kevin Bacon a Yank and not have him perform the awful Limey accent. Stupid stuff abounds throughout this movie. The fight scenes are choreographed poorly and the story just doesn't progress all that smoothly. And what's with the other-worldly aspect? It would have had more heart had Hounsou's sidekick been real flesh and blood. That was a cheap card to play.

Sorry. This fails on too many levels. I was wondering why I'd never heard of it. Movies with this level of star power have a way of making themselves known. After viewing it the mystery was solved. It should have stayed hidden.",1312588800,,1375,4.426877470355731
