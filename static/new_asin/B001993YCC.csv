3427625,5,B001993YCC,"This is a great movie to watch, especially if you believe in ghosts. It's very credibly handled and its creepy as hell - at least I thought so, and I don't believe in ghosts yet it still creeps me out. Okay so it's based on event's the family claimed to have happened, but the ghost hunters they hired in real life are the Warrens. They are involved in every ghost scam going. Some people believe them, but heck! anyway, you don't have to be a believer to enjoy this movie. It never gets carried away, it's nothing like poltergeist, but because of it's realness, its about the only movie that creeps me out anymore, even as an adult.",1286668800,3,633,4.372881355932203
3427626,5,B001993YCC,"I'm a huge fan of scary movies (horror if you want), all kinds of them, but specially the ones involving supernatural events. However, I'm very picky. I find most of them boring/not original/just generally bad. This is probably the best movie ever made, and definitely the best one I've seen (of this genre).
The only problem with this movie is, IT'S SO BLOODY HARD TO GET!!! Hopefully I could get it soon on DVD.",1281830400,,413,4.594594594594595
3427627,5,B001993YCC,"Yes this was a great made for TV horror movie based on the real life story of the Smurls family. I currently only have this one on VHS but would really like to have this one in a more durable format like uh, I dont't know DVD!!!!!!!!!! Great movie. No BS here. Not for the timid. Enjoy.",1265760000,5,286,4.035087719298246
3427628,5,B001993YCC,One of the greatest ghost stories ever told. I remember when this movie came out on Fox and how it scared the life out of me! It was like all of the testimonies of ghost sightings I've ever heard were merged together in one movie. Plus to find out on the news after the fact that the movie was based on true events! It is definitely a MUST see!,1237939200,4,344,4.0
3427629,5,B001993YCC,"One movie I can think of that chilled me more was The Haunting, which was not based on a real haunting. This was. Not only was the movie based on a real haunting, it involved Lorraine and Ed Warren, true paraniormal specialists. I had not expected to find it on a DVD and was sadly correct in that so at least I have it on a home video tape which will be transferred to a DVD when I can afford a DVD recorder. It parallels another not- based-on-fact movie, Poltergeist, in that the hauntings were subtle to begin with, then progressed to such power the family moved out. Unfortunately, the hauntings followed them to their new house. So many scenes in this really made me glad I was watching it on my screen, especially when Jack was attacked by a demon. When the family left for a camping trip, neighbors were ""entertained"" by the racket made by the spirits which lead credence to the Smurls' continued assertions that it was all real. It has been some time since I last saw it, but I do not recall anything in it that was not top-rate and will wait hopefully for when it is released on DVD.
Update October 29, 2016: I was able to dub the movie onto a DVD and am watching it now but the volume is so low that even at full volume I can barely hear it, a trait shared by seeral other similarly dubbed home movies. I read over my review and was surprised I did not say that the only movie I can say has the same subdued terror aspect is The Haunting, the black and white classic haunted-house movie. Also, a search for the movie on a DVD turned up a Web site from DVD Boulevard that is selling The Haunted for $9.,98.",1236211200,4,1615,4.229773462783172
3427630,5,B001993YCC,"We, along with numerous others, patiently await the owners of the rights to this amazing ghost story to come to their senses and release it on DVD.  ""The Haunted"" is one of the best ghost themed movies we have ever seen and it is made even scarier due to the awareness that it is fact-based on true events that befell the family that endured the haunting.  Further, it shows that a scary movie does not have to rely on fancy special effects to make it work when it has at its core a genuinely frightening storyline.",1227225600,11,515,4.354166666666667
3427631,5,B001993YCC,"I think this has got to be my favorite movie ever.  I've seen a lot of scary movies and I absolutely love this one. This is based on a true story and they did a great job.  It's SO realistic and as you watch it you feel so bad for the family.  I mean, what do you do when you're the only one that can hear and see the paranormal activity and your family thinks you're just ""stressed out.""  And even when they realize she's not just stressed, they can't move and the church won't help them.  This movie scared the life out of me because you know it's true and you wonder what would you do if it happend to you?  I HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone who likes true ghost stories. If you're into today's movies which are extremely gory, then this movie is not for you.  But I think most people would enjoy it. I can't wait until it's released on DVD!",1224460800,16,850,4.0843373493975905
3427632,5,B001993YCC,"WHEN I SAW THIS TV MOVIE ABOUT THE SMURLS WHO LIVE IN W.PITTSON, PA. IT SCARED THE HECK OUT OF ME. THIS STORY IS DOCUMENTED TO BE TRUE, IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS, YOU SURE WILL AFTER SEEING THIS.

8272841,5,B001993YCC,"Sometimes made for TV movies are better than the fancier, big budget ones that come out of Hollywood.  This so much applies to the Haunted.  I think the reason for TV versions being better, at least in the case of ghost films, is due to the heavy emphasis on story build-up.  Sure the atmosphere takes a little bit of a blow, but not by much.  I mean compare the atmosphere here to a film like the Shining.  Sure it's a step down but not a big one.

The Haunted is about a family who moves into a suburban home. They're immediately welcomed by the neighbors, with one even offering brownies.  Oh I'll take one of those!  Oh wait *spits them out*.  They're not homemade!  Just kidding, store brownies are awesome (at least the ones sold in a box- not the oversweet ones already made and sitting on a plate).  Anyway this family is very religious.  They go to church and do everything right.  They think they're living a normal life, however the house they're living in... it has some problems!  At first the problems are simple things like a hammer mysteriously disappearing and the husband believing his dad took it while the family does repairs around the house.  A nagging electrical problem continues to pop up as well.  This results in flickering/weak lighting.

The story goes a few years into the future, in the mid 80's.  The  kids are growing up, and the problems around the house continue.  I think it's fascinating many years went by without any major changes in the demon activity happening.  Something surely stirred up these demon spirits, but what?  The bigger problems begin with the wife (played by Sally Kirkland) and later her husband Jeffrey DeMunn (Get it?  ""De-mon?""  Okay, it's probably unintentional Jeffrey's last name happens to match the subject matter, hehe).  At first her husband thinks she's crazy which is the norm with horror movies isn't it?  The husband never believing the wife because he's working all day and comes home to a peaceful house.  When will men realize they're exhausted when they come home and never take notice of their surroundings!  They just go to bed, wake up, have breakfast, maybe read the paper and rub little Timmy on the head to congratulate him on baseball practice, and out the door they go to continue working.

Anyway this isn't about the life of a typical working man.  This is about Sally's character going through a horrible ordeal and nobody understands it.  Not even she understands it.  The problems get worse.  Her one daughter asks for tape concerning a school project, but Sally can't find it.  The same demon who made the hammer disappear earlier also took the tape and put it in the fridge.  Sally's confused but questions that she might be going crazy.  It certainly looks like that's the case early on.  Did you place the tape in the fridge Sally?  I don't think you did.  While bowling with her friends and family she brings up her emotional state and contemplates she might be crazy but nobody really takes it seriously this early on... because nothing intense happened yet.

It's not until she walks into the room where Jeffrey's mother is staying, and she accuses Sally of cussing up a storm which offended her greatly.  *Now* the story gets intense!  She accuses Sally of lying because the mother clearly heard her voice.  When Sally's in the kitchen later on, she sees a shadow figure form in front of her (with REALLY frightening sound effects that follow!).  It walks through the walls where Jeffrey's mom is staying.  When Sally walks into Jeffrey's mom's room, she brings up the frightening shadow man, and it's confirmed both women are seeing the same thing.

Luckily in this movie's case, it doesn't take long for the husband to believe his wife.  While the two are in bed sleeping, Sally hears voices in her pillow.  She tells Jeffrey to pull his head over and listen.  He hears them too, resulting in him being startled and throwing the pillow across the room.  More things happen such as mist pouring in from the bottom of the bedroom window and their blankets being pulled down.  Later on in the movie, when things really get crazy, Sally is lifted into the air and gets torpedoed into the wall while the husband is paralyzed in bed.  He appears to be sleeping or forced to sleep, and you know I had to question if this particular ordeal could be an episode of sleep paralysis.  You can't rule out sleep paralysis entirely given some of the outrageous stories I've heard over the years.  But then Sally's dragged from bed and tries desperately to grab onto her husband.  Okay now maybe we can rule out sleep paralysis!

Anyway the wife goes around digging up info on the history of the town.  What she finds is startling.  There used to be mine shafts on the ground where their house stands.  Turns out houses caved in and unearthed a hexagram.  She continues reading.  Spirits can be invited in by a ouija board or a terrible crime on the property.  Spirits can appear at will and just mess with one person in a family and nobody else, making the other family members think he or she is going crazy.  This explains what Sally's experiencing really well!

When Sally has enough, she visits a couple of demonologists (a man and woman).  They notice how visibly upset she is, so they come over and have a chat with the family.  They say demons have a way of making people do whatever it is they want, and they're drawn to marriage problems, alcoholics or anything that involves emotional stress.  I really like the explanation here.  It's more detailed than most horror films.

The lady demonologist takes a walk around the house, sees the toddler wheel hanging from the ceiling spinning around on its own, opens the closet and smells something awful.  She also sees a couple female spirits in a mirror.  When she returns she explains to the family that there's four demons in the house.  The first demon is an elderly woman who is confused and harmless, the second is a young girl, the third is a man who suffered terribly but doesn't know how, and the fourth is the worst of all- he's a demon that uses the other 3 spirits to destroy the family.  This demon knows the family's daughters are going through puberty and is fueled by their emotions.  Later on the male demonologist explains there's no cure for demon removal- only defense.  I like that response.

Unfortunately for the family these demonologists aren't able to help.  They try hard through prayer, holy water and reciting words while walking through the house, but this is only a short-term solution.  When Jeffrey says it even feels better in the house, we can pretty much guess that's a sign the demons are only away temporarily and will return soon.  Then again in 1991 maybe viewers were tricked into believing this scene really was the end of the demons torturing this family.  I doubt it though.  This wasn't the first demon/ghost movie to rely on that little trick.  People aren't that naive!  Plus this scene happens when the movie's only halfway over.

Sally and Jeffrey tried really hard to protect their kids and not have to tell them demons are haunting the house, but after the kitchen ceiling lights explode and shatter glass down towards one of the girl who's drawing in a book and while the mother and older daughter are singing ""Amazing Grace"", they pretty much HAVE to tell their kids what's going on.  Later on, one of the most startling moments of the movie is when the family decides to leave home and go on a camping trip.  Meanwhile back home the neighbors look up and see figures frantically moving back and forth in the upstairs window, along with all kinds of noise.  They're so concerned they call the cops, but of course when they come out they don't find any intruders or anything wrong with the house.  We don't see the cops though- this happens off-screen.  Meanwhile during the camping trip, it turns out the demons followed the family.  The can see a strange figure walking towards them in a distant field.

The family brings in an episcopal priest, believing he'll surely help them with their demon problem, but even he can't help.  In fact if he's the same priest as the one later on who spends a couple nights in the house, doesn't report anything strange going on and walks away impatient and somewhat angry one night, well, how rude of him!  He does say a family's love for one another is the only thing that can destroy a demon.  That was nice of him at least.

The family makes a HUGE mistake in going to the press.  By doing so they now have to contend with several news reporters and other town folks all over their front yard.  This results in a lot of attention and people driving by and making fun of the family.  A rock is even thrown through their front window in one scene.  When the news reporters get more anxious, Jeffrey's dad defends the family and the house by bringing out a gun and sitting on the porch chair waiting for anyone to dare walk up the stairs.  I noticed something odd the whole time Jeffrey's mom was involved.  She has a heart condition.  The reason they couldn't leave home is because she's apparently too weak to survive the move even though she's moving just fine in every scene we see.  So she's too weak for the family to move but... she's able to participate in the demon cleansings when the house shakes and objects get knocked off shelves?

The movie has an ending that I expected.  SPOILERS- the demons follow the family to a new home, but a few years after this movie takes place the family decides to bring in a church sanctioned exorcism which takes care of the demons for good.  Decent, but I think we all knew the moment Sally unpacked the boxes, yelled for her family but couldn't find them, she'd then see a frightening shadow figure (actually we just heard the sound it makes).  Sure enough.

Overall great atmosphere and acting.  Perhaps Jeffrey feels out of place as the husband.  I don't know why exactly.  Someone could have been in that role and done a better job.  Then again most husbands automatically dismiss their wife's claims when they bring up the outrageous subject of demon activity in the house, so at least he believed his wife and performed his role  fine in the regard.  Awesome movie, and it's based on a true story which makes it even better!

On a final note, the movie has one slip up.  It's when Jeffrey's thrown from his chair and hallucinates that a bunch of demons are on top of him and trying to do him.  The demons change form, and one of them is clearly a man dressed up as a woman, LOL!  It's hilarious, and it's the most unintentionally hilarious moment of the movie.  Also it's odd the movie doesn't focus on the terrible odors that Sally has apparently been smelling.  The story does mention it once or twice when brought to Sally's attention, but the smell of something awful doesn't come up very often before or during the ghost appearances.  Still a great movie.",1496275200,,10941,4.609642301710731
