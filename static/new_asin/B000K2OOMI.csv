8153988,1,B000K2OOMI,I bought this DVD because my horse is in the first year of basic training. I feel like I have thrown away my money. The video is too much superficial. I do not recommend to anyone.,1355443200,,180,4.027777777777778
8153989,5,B000K2OOMI,"The Zeilinger tapes are very helpful for trainers as they show him solving problems. He is always calm, kind, consistent but correct. He has a myriad of ways to approach issues. For example, the flying lead change tape has a variety of approaches if the horse is not picking up the idea. The rides are not very pretty and I give him credit for his honesty: he is not showing off his finished horses but rather truly showing the work of training the young horses through the levels. They get scared, they rush, they lose their balance - all the things babies do. He also appraises the horses honestly. Just a wonderful series for anyone studying dressage, but especially trainers working with young horses.",1287792000,,705,4.693548387096774
8153990,5,B000K2OOMI,"A true master, to my eyes, of gentle dressage training. I was rather surprised at his devotion of time to the comfort level and willingness of the horse, since many who are as successful as he is in international showing seem to think these things are actually secondary! In addition it is obvious that he focuses on the importance of basics and outlines these very clearly. It is very helpful to watch the riders and horses in training with him in order to *properly* achieve these basic goals as well. For me it is a ""must-have"" as a home reference for dressage riding and would probably be useful for anyone still under First Level (maybe higher if you think you are shaky on the basics or that you have to force your horse into collection.) The format of the DVD is well organized and consists, for the most part, of Zeilinger coaching a rider (the entire DVD is kindly translated into English for those of us who cannot speak German). It also includes him riding horses, riding a horse outside for the first time, a horse's first show, and occasional one-on-one interviews spliced in, relevant to each level of a horse's training. So, for less than the cost of a clinic, you can own this DVD of a trainer who understands that the beauty of dressage begins with a foundation of supple willingness. Another reason this DVD is valuable is to be able to watch and ""feel"" the relaxed, correct positions of the riders. I find I can't really watch the Olympiads for this purpose because I cannot relate to a canter pirouette, never having ridden one. I can relate, however, to a rider on a young horse settling into a trot or occasionally bucking at a canter! Real riders on real horses in basic training = priceless.",1194566400,7,1715,4.571428571428571
