208535,5,6300134210,"This is a Criterion Collection release which I think will mainly interest history buffs, as it is a discrete slice of American history.  The heart of it is an Academy-Award winning documentary by Barbara Kopple on a coal miners strike in Harlan Co. Kentucky, circa 1972-73

Some of you know that coal mining in the past 200 years has been one of the most hazardous professions (it still is, in China especially), and that there was a union, United Mine Workers, who tried to unionize all the mine workers to demand not just better pay, but better pensions, health benefits, and safety conditions in the mines.  To me 1972 doesnt sound so long ago, but miners there were earning very little for 10-14 hr days.  [At the time apparently there was a minimum wage: around $2-3/hr].

This was during the Nixon administration, and some may vaguely remember the US Govt. [Secretary of the Treasury among others] getting involved in one settlement between striking miners and owners, citing national economic concerns.  Organizing in mines in Harlan County had been very bloody in the 1930s and achieved small progress, which in the ensuing 40 years was no doubt eradicated by inflation.

Live footage of miners at union meetings, confrontations between picketers and scab workers (and gun- carrying company men accompanying them) was supplemented with a lot of Appalachian-miner songs, and some national news coverage.

As usual there are a plethora of bonuses from Criterion, including an Ebert-led discussion of this film with Barbara Kopple at a Sundance festival, audio commentary during the film for the true insomniacs, never before seen outtakes from the extensive word Kopple did, and a new making of documentary by Kopple and the editor, as well as the usual no doubt excellent booklet, an interview with a legendary bluegrass singer, some of whose songs were included, and of course good subtitling.

In recent years there has not been much news about coal mining in the US, with the exception of the disaster at the mine owned by Masseyremember the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion?  2010?  Killed 29 miners.  The govt. fined Massey $10 million, which was peanuts compared to a massive $209 million paid by Alpha Natural Resources to eliminate any potential criminal liabilities.  Had there been criminal trials, they should have included the govt. inspectors as well as Mr. Massey and any of his subordinates because, as all too often (a la the financial industry) repeated violations had been found yet essentially nothing had been done to fix them and the govt. never held the companys feet to the fire (though it had the power to shut down the mine, had it chosen to exercise it).  Alpha by the way purchased all of Massey Coal Co. to the tune of a massive $7 billion (which may not look like such a great investment right now, given all the gas and oil produced by fracking) but at the time Massey was the 4th largest coal producer in the US with an annual production of 40 million tons and over 2 billion proven tons of coal deposits owned.

Corporate and individual profit outweighing human deaths, sad to say, did not vanish with modern government regulations (as witnessed by the BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, the Bhopal India disaster, and even the ignition-switch scandal dogging GM this year) though they certainly have been mitigated.  This film, made perhaps halfway between the unmitigated robber-baron era and more modern regulations (at least insofar as Appalachia is concerned) is an excellent documentary.

Strange (or maybe not) despite the lack of any love for the companies which even today dominate West Virginia with coal mining, the voting population there turned against Mr. Obama in 2012, due at least in part to the perception that he wanted to kill coal.  Not so strange if you realize that even today, there is almost no other industry in West Virginia than coal mining: hands down the most environment-unfriendly way of generating energy in the world.  I give this film a B+ and perhaps with all the bonuses it should reach A category.",1417219200,6,4073,4.902474526928676

What is not correct is the term ""Bloody Harlan"". Harlan County actually got that nickname during the civil war since half of the county is Union and the other is Yankee.

The paternal side of my family is from the mountains of Southwest Virginia; my father & uncles worked in the mines for many years (one of my uncles died from black lung, in fact). I can vouch for the accurate portrayal of the miners in that region & time period. This film is a sympathetic depiction of a people so long abused by the coal companies & banksters, and incessantly mocked as ""inbred hillbillies"" by a venomous Hollywood pop culture. The dramatic struggle of the miners & their brave, stalwart wives in the face of the guns of the coal company's lackeys like mine manager Basil Collins is nothing short of magnificent.

This epic shows the true face of Big Business, and it is hideous to behold - all the more reason for today's foreclosed, out-of-work ""globalised"" Americans to see it and rise up with the same righteous rage & courage displayed by those working-class heroes of the '70s.

As one old lady says in the film:

""You have nothin' to lose but your chains.""",1289433600,5,1064,4.589473684210526
208571,5,6300134210,"The film melds history and drama with pathos and even humor; a scene where strikers go to New York City, and one of them gets schooled in how poorly they have it by a New York flatfoot, is priceless. Even Kopple, in the commentary, admits she was floored with laughter when she first saw the footage. The lives of the miners- then without hot running water, and living in shanties that would make a trailer look comfy- are deplorable, yet the Duke Power honchos only give in after one of their gun thugs kills a young miner, Lawrence Jones, and the strikers are ready to kill any scab that crosses their picket line. And, the film takes on not only the owners of Duke Power, but the corrupt sheriff and judge of the county, who are in the back pocket of the company. One of the young wives of the strikers, in court for a phony violation, correctly sums up American justice there and then (as well as too often elsewhere and elsewhen): `The laws are not made for the working people of this country.'

  But, while such uncomplicated realities are laid bare in this film, its greatness comes because the film refuses to simplify things to a lowest common denominator. The Brookside strikers' contract is soon made redundant by a national contract, and that contract is reviled by some miners and praised by others. The new leader of the UMWA, Arnold Miller- a real miner, not just a union hack, is shown as a possible sellout; while not as corrupt as his predecessor Boyle, he seems on his way down that path; or not.

  Harlan County, USA, is not only a great documentary, but a great film. Period. It was well deserving of its Academy Award, as well as its 1990 inclusion in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress. While art is clearly not truth, documentaries are the rare art form where truth is essential, because it is not merely cinema, but a journalistic art. The film also holds up for it is shorn or much of the faux poesy that inflicts bad documentaries. This is just `point the camera' cinema, and the fact that it features poor people who are Americans- not foreigners, and mostly white- not minorities, is a rarity, and shows that this film not only can strike one emotionally (it raised my ire), but intellectually. And its end, recognizing that, although the miners won their strikes, their struggles go on (few miners could then afford to retire when most folk do), is pitch perfect. Unfortunately, that reality shows why the film is, in today's economic blight, is still all too relevant. Ironically, it only manifests the vision that Kopple had all those decades ago. Excelsior!",1283299200,4,2611,4.628509719222462
208572,5,6300134210,"This excellent documentary directed by Barbara Kopple focuses on the long, somewhat isolated, strike 1973 by the new United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) local of Brookside, Kentucky coal miners fighting for a union contract against the Eastover Mining Company (a subsidiary of the massive Duke Power Company, the modern equivalent of the old villainous Peabody Mining Company well known in labor circles and in coal country songs). That long strike, the ups and downs of the battles for recognition, the changing tactics on both sides over time, the frustrations of the strikers and their wives and other supporters and the lessons to be learned for labor militants today are what make this such a compelling and rewarding documentary to view.

That ""hot running water and a big old bathtub"" caption in the title may need some explaining in post-industrial America, although perhaps not by as many people as one would think. One of the virtues of this documentary is that the participants in the strike and their wives and loved ones get plenty of air time. Thus, we get to hear and see, up close and personal, them express their views, their frustrations during the strike and their hopes for a successful strike and a new contract that will provide enhanced safety standards (notoriously poor throughout the inherently dangerous history of coal mining underground and a central goal of coal miner unions up to the present day), produce more benefits and place the Eastern Kentucky miners on a equal footing with other UMWA miners.

The most poignant expression of that hope was provided by a poor miner's wife living in a ramshackle old cabin (company-provided, I believe, which is not unusual in coal country) without hot, running water or a proper bathtub to her daughter while the daughter was being bathed in a washtub. That, my friends, is what the class struggle meant down at the base then, and, I daresay, now. We politically-oriented labor militants may express that proposition a little more theoretically concise and analytically profuse but I dare anyone who fights for a more just society to say they can express the sense of the struggle down at the base better than that.

And what of the lessons to be learned by today's labor militants, including today's coal miners who have lost a great deal of the spirit of their militant history in the last almost forty years since the events depicted in this film occurred. Well, as always, the question posed by the sub-theme that drives the spirit of the struggle in this documentary and as eloquently expressed by the writer of the song in the 1930s when there was also a huge wave of class struggle in the coal fields, Florence Reece - ""Which Side Are You On?""  After a few minutes of viewing here one should be very clear about that point. Further that, ""picket lines mean don't cross"", a chronic problem during the strike with scabs being sent into the mines by the company daily- a question that repeatedly comes up these days when labor disputes come up as well.  And another lesson, not surprisingly, do not trust bourgeois politicians, judges, cop, the pro-capitalist union bureaucracy or anyone else that gets in your way. That is for starters.

Moreover, a strike committee has to be tactically supple, as the heroic work of the Brookside Women's Club demonstrated when the miners were enjoined from keeping effective picket lines to keep the scabs out. And... well I could go on and on but the best bet is to actually watch this film, and re-watch it because there is plenty to pick up on there. And plenty to make you glad, glad as hell that you are a labor militant. A retrospective hats off to the 1973 Harlan County, Kentucky coal miners, a place very close to this reviewer's heart.",1262476800,,3761,4.823255813953488
208573,5,6300134210,"Pay close attention to the women in this movie. They are there just aas in your face as the men were during the strike. I wept when I saw these women trying to survive on the meager wages their husbands brought home, trying to keep their kids clean in washtubs, trying to feed them. It wasn't an issue of feminism it was pure survival. But on the other hand, look at the women and they were in the background, they left the fighting to the men even though they had as much to lose as their husbands.

208575,5,6300134210,"Barbara Kopple's ""Harlan County, USA"" is an amazing look at a United Mine Workers' strike in Kentucky during the 1970s. The film won a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Documentary. I have seen few films that have ""drawn me in"" as much as this one did.

Through the film, we learn that Harlan County's mines were long a hotbed of labor unrest; in the 1930s, people called the area ""Bloody Harlan."" In 1973, Duke Power still had workers living in shacks without running water or electricity. Duke also refused to recognize the union or negotiate a contract with the miners.

I thought that I would like ""Harlan County, USA,"" but I did not think that the film would rivet my attention. The film is compelling because we see the miners struggle through difficult lives. We see a woman bathing her little girl in a pot on a stove; we see a striking miner murdered with a shotgun; we hear the stories of ex-miners who are dying of ""the black lung."" The human interest is so strong that it is, at times, difficult to believe that this is nonfiction.

The movie also ""spoke to"" me on a personal level. My wife's family and my family are both from Appalachia. Seeing the people in the film and listening to their accents and the cadences of their speech brought back so many memories of our relatives. It also gave us a new appreciation of just how difficult things were for our Scotch-Irish ancestors.

I have a few qualms about the film. I would recommend it for the human interest; I'm not sure that its coverage of union issues is very evenhanded. Kopple wants the viewer to believe that the issue is a simple one of saintly proletarians versus evil capitalists. The film does make me wonder about the other side of the story.

Fans of documentaries should, nevertheless, seek out Harlan County USA. It is ""just that good.""",1249171200,,1822,4.593846153846154
208576,4,6300134210,"Harlan County U.S.A. (Barbara Kopple, 1976)

In June of 1973, the eyes of America turned to a small rural county in the very southeast corner of Kentucky, Harlan. Harlan, the home of the Brookside Mine and Prep Plant, owned by Eastover Coal, was no stranger to mine-related tension; for a while during the Depression it was known as Bloody Harlan County. That moniker threatened to rear its ugly head once again when the workers at Brookside voted to join the United Mineworker's Union, and subsequently went on strike. While the resulting chaos is also the subject of a fictional film (Harlan County War, which is actually sitting here waiting for me to watch it), the first feature-length treatment of the subject was Barbara Kopple's Oscar-winning documentary, Harlan County U.S.A.

Kopple's approach here is simple: travel around the county interviewing everyone in sight to get as many perspectives on what's going on as possible. As a result, her team became kind of invisible, and there are some surprising scenes to be found here. She also concentrates on the role women played in the uprising; many workers' wives joined their husbands on the picket lines, putting themselves in the sights. You don't even need to be a specifically feminist filmmaker to get the message across here; whatever your sex, if you were in Harlan County in 1973, you took sides, and you were in danger.

In a film like this, you can pretty much throw the technical considerations to the wind, as what's going to grab you is the subject matter itself. Which is a good thing, because when you're filming strike-breakers carrying ill-concealed rifles, you don't really have time to set up professional-looking shots. That's what gives this its immediacy, even thirty-odd years later. This is as gripping as any Hollywood thriller, and is well worth checking out, even if you know nothing of the situation in question. ****",1242950400,2,1905,4.984276729559748

208578,5,6300134210,"""Harlan County USA"" is an excellent, compelling documentary. Depicting a strike by coal miners in West Virginia in the early 70s, the film gives a snapshot of arguably the last years of the ""organized labor era"" that began in the 30s. We see how the miners' families lived- they were very poor even by the standards at the time; mothers give their children baths in tin tubs, for example. Despite the poverty and hardship, the community sticks together, and eventually wins.

Particularly interesting was how larger social changes are reflected in the strike. For example, black miners are welcome and included in the miners' community. In addition, the miners' wives play a very big role in organizing and generating support for the strike. At one point, some of them directly confront the sheriff about the picket line- women would probably not have done that, especially in West Virginia, 20 years earlier. Further, it will probably surprise a lot of people to know that there was a grassroots labor movement in the south, but there was. How ""union"" became a dirty word in dixie even for those who would benefit from one is a complicated subject outside the scope of the movie.

Throughout, we hear the inspired folk labor songs of the great Hazel Dickens. It's almost worth the movie just to hear her sing. Dickens herself is a daughter of a coal-mining family, and is very familiar with labor struggles.

In sum, watch this if you want a real-life depiction of a unique American time and place.",1235692800,3,1499,4.824902723735408
208579,5,6300134210,"HARLAN COUNTY U.S.A. (1976)
Located in eastern Kentucky, Harlan had long been a focal point of labor/management strife. In 1932 the struggle between the United Mine Workers and strikebreakers was so sanguinary this historic episode became known as the ""Harlan County War."" We see and hear a few survivors of those dark days, including a woman who wrote ""Whose Side Are You On?,"" a protest song that has since entered the American folk music canon.

The bulk of the story however concerns the (then) current efforts of local workers to unionize against Duke Power Co. Given substandard housing by Duke (barren shacks that had no indoor plumbing) and with inadequate medical benefits, the plight of these men and their families is tremendous. Especially moving are the many victims of black lung disease, a condition management stubbornly denied was caused by prolonged exposure to coal dust.

Worse still is the 18 month ordeal all endured in a desperate fight for unionization. This program's remarkable footage includes threats of company violence and an armed attack at 5 AM against a peaceful picket line by foreman Basil Collins and his goons. The morning's silence is suddenly broken by machine gun fire and an unarmed striker is killed. This tragic event was the catalyst that brought management and union to the bargaining table, where a partial victory was gained for strikers.

In the larger picture, the UMWA itself was embroiled in its own turmoil. An unscrupulous President ('Tony' Boyle) got voted out by members in favor of a man represented as a labor champion (Tom Williams), yet when all 140,000 mine workers struck, the deal hammered out may have increased wages somewhat, but their right to strike at the local level was revoked.

The contract passed by an underwhelming majority and our story ends where it began: with miners exposed to a hazardously unhealthy work environment and without a legal right to strike against such conditions. The significant difference: this ban now applied nationwide and not just to Harlan County, KY. The film's final message assured more battles to come.

208580,5,6300134210,"I remembered this film winning the Oscar for Best Ducumentary back in the 1970's.  I remember really wanting to see it but, especially back then, it was pretty hard to come across documentaries on TV (forget about movie theaters).  Thus it was with great pleasure that I noticed it on the April schedule of the Independent Film Channel.  My politics have changed over the years so I haven't rushed out to join a union or volunteer to parade in a pickett line after watching ""Harlan County, USA"".  However, I was fascinated with the up-close and personal film that told a very compelling story.  The glimpses of the mines, the miners in their squalid homes, the anger and determination, the tedium and the violence all brought together the sort of documentary that underlines the adage ""Truth is Stranger than Fiction"".

This film excels by bringing the story to life through the people that live it.  There are a number of men and women who seem to take the lead and a number of men and women who tell the story of what happened a couple of generations earlier.  There are side stories about Black Lung disease and the Yablonski murders (that I remember well).  There is a sort of epilogue that suggests a mixed future for the mine workers.

I read a couple of reviews by indiviuals who said that they were from the area and could attest first-hand to the short-comings of the documentary.  I couldn't help but notice a telling scene or two where the strike-breakers were armed with guns and the strikers were armed with clubs.  I also noticed that there were at least a couple of scenes where the union leaders were advocating calm and reason in the wake of violence by the strike-breakers.  I knew better than to take this at face value and I appreciated those reviews that confirmed that there was violence on both sides.  The issue of unionizing and striking are not simple ones especially in a society that celebrates individuality.  The strike-breakers were portrayed as evil which is very debatable (and there was no look at the strike-breakers view by the makers of ""Harlan County, USA"").  They had families to feed as well.  I would grant them that they chose to continue on in order to take care of those they were responsible for.  I know of plenty of tales in other parts of the country where violence was more prevalent on the union side than the other and the lack of seeing any other point of view just confirms my suspicions of the bias in this film.  That said, I came away from the movie with the sense that neither side was faring very well in the conditions they worked in.

I was grabbed by the throat emotionally by this documentary and its grip did not stop with the end of the film.  Union members literally get beaten, shot, disrespected, and dismissed by the mine owners and their goon squads.

What impresses me most is the courage of these miners, their wives and families.  With union membership in America down to 9% it makes me wonder where are those who will fight for a decent living wage, health care, a safe and healthy environment, and a future for their children.  These coal miners set an example for everyone who seeks a more just society.  Their solidarity is remarkable under any circumstances, but especially so where law enforcement was owned by the coal company.

The coal miners of Harlan County are the kind of activist citizens who make me proud to be an American.  I just hope a follow up documentary will be done to see what the situation is there now.",1207526400,3,1107,4.699481865284974

I do remember the absolute poverty of the coal camps but they were no worse than lumber camps or the homes of many who worked for neither.  During my youth the third most profitable industry was moonshine, now its pot.  My Dad owned a small independent mine for a period but was forced out of business by union miners who threatened his leased truckers to the point that they refused to transport his coal over Pine Mountain to the railroad.  Life has not progressed in Harlan County today as it has in other parts of the US; in fact, during my last visit I thought that it was worse than when I was a child helping Dad at his mine (early 1950s.)

208584,4,6300134210,"I grew up in a county bordering Harlan County. As coal company employees my father and uncle both experienced the strikes of the seventies, and the associated violence, so this documentary appealed to me for those reasons.  Despite what appears to me to unfortunately be socialist or ""progressive"" undertones, Kopple does a good job of depicting the life of the eastern Kentucky coal miner in the early seventies.  Although the UMWA has outlived its usefulness, the documentary illustrates why it was necessary at one time.

One minor quibble on my part: anyone who grew up or lives in eastern Kentucky knows the sterling reputation of the Kentucky State Police, and their absolute refusal to take sides in a strike, only getting involved for the purpose of keeping roads open and preventing violence. The incorrect portrayal of them as biased against the strikers is limited, and only a slight distraction.

The commentary by the crew some 20 years after filming gives us an interesting view from their perspective as ""big city outsiders"" who were fortunate enough to find mountain folks willing to share their lives and homes with them.  Surviving in the seventies a place those of us in the area called ""bloody Harlan"" was also a laudable accomplishment, again considering that the crew was made up of outsiders.

Overall a very good documentary that I would recommend to anyone who is interested in the Kentucky coal strikes of the seventies.",1195862400,4,1446,5.004166666666666

While the elements depicted are relatively accurate, based on my recollections, it's fairly one-sided in that it leaves out the sins of the unionization advocates. It makes them out to be heroes and the mine owners the villains, when in actuality, there were villains on both sides, and probably of equivalent extremes. What is omitted is the context. Instances such as when pro-union forces firing high-powered rifles into the roofs of school buses purchased and painted green to transport non-union workers to another mining operation owned by others just upstream from Eastover Mining Company just a few short years after the Eastover union problems had been settled.

While it's a reasonably factual account for the issues presented, it was obviously produced for the purpose of demonizing non-union advocates to pull at the public's heartstrings against the ""evil"" corporations.",1195084800,14,993,5.284810126582278

We were often shipped off to another town for safety while my dad would guard the house.  This was in the mid 70's as well.

208612,5,6300134210,"Contrary to what the prior reviewer said this documentary is one of the best documentations of working class struggle in the United States. What this film portrays is the inner workings of the way workers and their families become conscious and weary of exploitive practices of the company, and the epiphanies that occur in order to overcome these malpractices. In that function this film is a masterpiece, it won an oscar rightly so because its impact on the viewer is so earth shattering.

The movie begins by showing the absolute impoverished lives of the mine workers who are virtually in feudal bondage to company tenement housing with no paved roads,running water, or electricity. Through a series of betrayals both from the company,the working class(scabs), AND THE UNION, the workers experience many cathartic moments in their campaign for material relief,rights and dignity. Some of these epiphanies are difficult to understand if you're not coming from the perspective of a highly impoverished industrial laborer, and include the rationalization of violence in defense of maintaining the strike and defying the declarations of the union.

Yes this is a biased documentary, the very concept of a documentary chooses to leave the comfort of neutrality and take a position, to choose a subject as a protagonist against an antagonist. You would find yourself very bored if you had to watch a two hour movie about how 'objectively everyone is right in their view, all we can do is observe and hope we just all get along', that's just NOT how the world works. Imagine trying to watch a movie about the Auschwitz rationalized on both sides, history would occur on film as it did in nazi germany, as a necessary process for the 'Vaterland', a crime to ignore for the sake the the majority. Now fortunately documentaries take the side of the oppressed prisoners most of the time, and we can see through this subjective view how insidious and evil these crimes were*. If we put this in perspective, a film that objectively just interviewed, got the rational view points and had some omnipotent view of the miners strike would in-fact only reinforce the reality as it occurred then,'it's unfortunate that all these accidents occur in the mines but the country needs coal more than you need you lungs,your family, or your life. Therefore, in the name of progress scabs will work your job and hopefully these inconvenient battles can stop, hope you understand you de-evolved luddite bum!'. Of course, this reality is a basic untruth and it was forcefully destroyed by the collective action of the UMWA vis-a-vis an enormous internal pitched revolt in the rank-and-file and the creation of this movie.

If you are totally sympathetic to scabs and exploitive managers, this movie will just upset you and make you feel hatred or indifference. If you want to see a documentary about how scabs are just trying to make living and companies provide ample amount of services or money to their workers watch the news, but if the contradiction of working people turning on each other perplexes you,that the only formal institutions the working class has to defend it are paradoxically controlled by company men, this documentary will show you the only means the impoverished have to combat it:their solidarity,their bodies,sticks, and stones.

(*note: It is because of the action of the allies that this reality and untruth were defeated that a documentary can expose the concetration detainees plight)",1155081600,5,3489,5.052083333333333
208613,2,6300134210,"I love how this movie portrays the striking coal miners and their wives as innocent angels while the scabs are called ""gun thugs"" who just open fire on innocently peaceful protesters with machine guns.

The film-maker spends 99% of the film with the strikers and doesn't try too hard to get the opinions of the scabs and mining company workers.

After all, scabs are people who do the work that the miners do not want to do themselves. The work has to be done anyway.

The mining company in this film not only gave its employees wages but also housed all of them too. Of course the wages and housing conditions are lousy but HOUSING EMPLOYEES IS NOT AN EMPLOYER'S JOB!

Any sane person (or anyone who has seen a major strike in person) finds it hard to believe that the scabs are the sole instigators during strikes and that the strikers are the pure victims. Scabs are just trying to go to work and support their families too but are violently harassed by strikers who can do the same work but choose not to. If the work is good enough for the scabs, then why isn't it good enough for the strikers?

Strikers also use more than just words to taunt scabs. They use sticks, clubs and occasionally guns or knives to hurt scabs whom they believe are taking their jobs away from them. In this film, when the scabs defend themselves for the right to go into work without getting hurt or killed by the hot-tempered strikers, it is the scabs who are always portrayed as the ""gun thugs"" and ""evil"" while the  strikers are always seen being saint-like, perfectly behaved and unjustly discriminated against.

Why else are police officers on the scene of most major strikes? To protect the strikers? Hell no. They are there to protect the scabs who are trying to go into work but are subjected to constant harassment by the strikers.

This film even has the token black striker, who happens to get along with all of the white striker folks. But guess who uses the ""n-word"" in this movie toward a black person? You guessed it...an evil scab.

I wonder if this film would have shown the strikers' reaction to a black scab if there was one. Probably not.

Bottom line: If you are pro-union and believe scabs are the scum of the Earth and that strikers can do no wrong, then ""Harlan County, U.S.A."" is the movie for you.",1154908800,18,2305,4.492822966507177
208614,5,6300134210,"Let me just start off by stating that is one of the most powerful emotional and memorable documentaries in the Criterion Collection and in the film industry.

We are introduced to a small quaint impoverished town of Harlan County Kentucky where hard working young Americans perservere over the harsh and hazardous dangers of mining. These miners work incredibly long strenuous hours for meager wages and at what a price. They are prone to collapsing caves, black lung, and other pernicious long term damages. These hazardous and deadly conditions are all apart of their daily lives in order to support their loving and devoted wives. When the mining company refused to approve a UMW agreement for a contract this small little town abrupts with malice, frustration, and anxiety. There is nothing more exhilerating and pleasurable than watching a group of determined Americans subjugate over Cooperate America. As I watched this town gather and form a potent and indestructible bond against ""Scabs"" or gun thugs I couldn't help but route and praise them for their determination. This town is cruelly beaten by local sheriffs and gun thugs and risk their lives as some spend nights in jail. There goal is make sure everyone is to be out at that picket line at exhausting pre-dawn hours. My most favorable scene is during the strike at Wall St, this strike is just about creeping up at 9 months where a fellow mine worker and local NYPD officer converse on a deep personal level regarding occupations conditions. It is simply one of the most poignant and moving scenes ever captured not too mention an unfortunate death of a young American who leaves behind a 16 year old wife and a 5 month old daughter. This documentary is truly a masterpiece and I personally praise Barbara Kopple and her team of talented editors and the beautiful cinematography. The bluegrass soundtrack only contributes to the blood sweat and tears that these hard working Americans endured. Just like the mine workers this talented director also risked her life everyday being out there on the picket line as she witnesses live shootings and intimidation by gun thugs.

208616,5,6300134210,"I was introduced to this film while pursuing my undergrad degree. Our professor was a wild-haired sociology PhD that taught a class called, ""The Sociology of Cultural Movements and Popular Struggle"". He was fond of telling students at the beginning of the semester that he had been kicked out of more institutions than they had attended. The professor didn't say much before showing the film, but I do recall, perhaps because of its erie delivery, that the professor used the word, ""powerful"", repeatedly, and held up a single finger in the air. I remember his eyes scanning across our faces with out a single blink in his eyes. He knew what he was about to introduce us to. He knew that this film would change our lives. He shut off the lights and took a seat in the back of the classroom. No one moved over the two days he showed this film. We laughed and smiled when we should have, we bit our lips, we clenched our fists, we felt the small victories and joy, and thankfully, the lights were out, because I am fairly sure that more than a handful of people wiped away some tears, too. I recall that this film even managed to silence the usual sarcastic rhetoric of even the biggest class clowns. I have been haunted by this film since that initial viewing, it is a landmark of journalistic achievment.

  Previous to the film's release on DVD, I would sometimes borrower it from the public library on VHS. Despite going completely retro adjusting the tracking, and tolerating the lousy, faded picture, I justified the discomfort because this film is much, much more than mere entertainment. This film stands up to repeated viewings and study. It requires time. These people give you everything they have, and all they ask for in return is some of your time.

  The cast of this film are coal miners and their families. These are people barely getting by, employed in a thankless and dangerous profession, living in poverty, and yet full of passion and unbroken hope. Most did not have running water. Your printer is probably worth more than all of the worldly possessions these people owned. They had cars that barely ran, but the vehicle got them to work. They had each other, and that's about it. However, when they realized, collectively, and decided, collectively, that the time had come to unionize and attempt to improve their lives, they met with some resistance to say the least. They risked not only the very little that they had, they risked their lives in some cases to make a better life for their children and grandchildren. This is a documentary of heroes, real, day to day heroes that we might never know about under ordinary media coverage.

  In this modern day, when the documentary has come into full vogue with a major force, this film still remains the finest documentary I have ever seen. More than anything else, this is, to me, a deeply American film, but I must tell you, I mean that in the same sense that Howard Zinn might say it. This is popular struggle. This is how it is done. This is not the glorious, bloody revolution, but is instead the day after day struggle for positive change with dedication, sweat, tears, two steps forward and three steps back, passionate victories, a silence, and a child sleeping sounder in the still of the night. Thankfully, Barbara Kopple dedicated her time, energy, and creativity to this masterpiece of documentary journalism and captured an important piece of populist history for humankind.

  If you are new to this film, I really encourage you to watch it, you have nothing to lose and so much to gain. Watch it with your family and your children. Discuss it, think about it. These are not actors. These are people struggling for everything that they have in this world just short of their souls.

208617,5,6300134210,"Granted, very few documentary filmmakers are blessed enough to have such colorful characters who almost seem to be better suited to a melodrama, but the (real-life) cast is just one of the great things about this movie.

It reminds us of a time when workers, although having little formal education, knew about class struggle.  Some of the women in this film are astounding in their will to help the men working in the mines achieve their contract.  Of all the characters in the film, Bessie and Lois may be two of the most admirable people I've ever seen.

You also learn about right-wing paranoia in the form of Basil Collins, who ascribes any instance of workers attempting to better their living situation as ""communism.""  Sound familiar?

Finally, I should add that the music in this film is incredible.  You can buy the soundtrack, too, and I recommend that you do.",1151280000,5,871,4.766666666666667

The depictions of the miners are very realistic and at times even entertaining.  I can still hear Basil Collins saying ""The Longshoremens' is known communiss, the Teamsters' is known communiss......whut will become of are country?""

In her film, the miners are depicted as poor, benighted strugglers against a positively evil adversary.  She trots out film clips of folks like John L. Lewis, the original gangster of the U.M.W.A., as though his voice mattered in this situation.  It would have been nice if she had looked more deeply into some of the criminal records of those miners and union officials she lionizes, and into some of the wonderfully selfless deeds of people like Norman Yarbrough, whom she seemed to paint as oppressors.

Fast forward to 2006.  Most of the miners in the movie are probably dead, of rockfall, lung cancer, etc., their labor gains long lost in the dust of history.  Meanwhile, Ms. Kopple continues make cynical documetaries for film festivals like Sundance.

To say I was pleasantly suprised would be an understatement. Producer-director Barbara Kopple and her ragtag crew (outsiders in every meaning of the word) were able to insinuate themselves in this culture and capture it with a clarity I didn't think was possible.

Viewing the film, I felt as though I knew these people. While I've never been in Harlan, these ARE my people. Maybe that's why I was particularly moved by it. I'd like to think it would also offer outsiders a glimpse into a world that is all too often simply considered nothing more than backwoods ""Beverly Hillbillies"" or ""Deliverance"" types.

208621,5,6300134210,"This acclaimed 1976 documentary about a 1972 miners' strike in Harlan County, Kentucky has been on my ""must-see"" list for years now.  I actually find myself feeling a little embarrassed that it's taken me almost 30 years to finally see it.  On the other hand, I find myself agreeing completely with other reviewers (both on Amazon and elsewhere) who find it as relevant today as it was in the 70s.  And maybe more hardhitting too.

I recall being vaguely aware of some of the United Mine Workers' concerns as a young man, but in the post-Vietnam)/Watergate era, it probably was something of a back burner story.  I'm sure if I had seen this film at age 23, I would have been properly outraged.  To be honest, however, I'm not sure how long that outrage would have lasted.  In that tumultuous era there seemed to be so much else to be upset about.  (Not that there isn't today, but I do have at least a little more perspective.)

Now more than 30 years after the events this film depicts, we can at least begin to sort out and separate this particular human drama from all the others that were clamoring for our attention at the time.  And appreciate it on its own terms, at the same time understanding that issues of social injustice and exploitation were emblematic of the day.

Filmmaker Barbara Kopple and her crew did a masterful job of capturing the lives and struggles of the mining families of Harlan County.  These are people you get to know and care about over the course of the two hour documentary.  It's a group portrait, of course, and you know that there's more to these folks' individual lives than the camera can show. But those moments the camera does capture are poignant and dramatic, and ultimately profoundly moving.

I was glad to read from one poster below that the living conditions for Harlan County residents and workers really have improved over the past few decades.  It's heartening to know that the struggle of the current generation's parents and grandparents yielded a better life for their progeny.  But we know that similar struggles are taking place all over the globe.  Saying that this classic documentary is still relevant 30 years on is not a just a cliche.  It's a bitter truth.

(If you're at all prone to running your own double bills, you might also be interested in John Sayles' affecting drama MATEWAN about an earlier era in the miners' struggle.)",1100995200,25,2393,4.6682577565632455
208622,5,6300134210,"I am from Harlan County, Kentucky.  This movie is a compelling visual of my family and its rich history of roots and labor. Harlan was known back then as ""Bloody Harlan"" because of the conflicts regarding the area. There is a song called ""You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive"", it embodies this documentary of the 70s.  People spent their lives digging coal until they reached the bottom of their grave.

My mother grew up in those coal camps and knew no other life.  She was pregnant with me during the filming of the documentary and worked at a small resturant where she met my daddy who was a coal miner.  She stated that those times were hard and just left it at that...she did not speak about it very often and when she did...it was cut short.  My dad made it through the riots and protesting, but he died in those mines in 1980 from a rock fall because the saftey conditions were so poor.  My stepfather has worked in the coal mines for almost 30 years.  He, like many others in Harlan are aware of the dangers when traveling into this deep graveside that holds so many.

I have watched this movie many times with my grandmother who was right there on the picket lines protesting these conditions.  When we watch it now, she always points at the television and says...you know that is such and such...it's funny how she never forgets who and what that time was about.

My generation of Harlan County USA has seen little of what our parents and grandparents endured back in the 1970s.  My brother has now entered the world of coal mining and the tradition continues.  It is much safer now.  My father wants to be a Mine and Saftey inspector because he remembers what it was like and how far they have come.  Coal mining is our legacy, our way of life.  We hold it high and its the most respectable, honest way to make a living that you can have in our town.

We in Harlan County will never forget the documentary that showed the world who we are and what we are made of...and let it be known, that we will never back down from a fight.",1099612800,67,2035,4.355437665782493
208623,5,6300134210,"When I told the librarian I wanted to see a video on coal mining, she handed me ""Harlan County.""  I looked at the date - which indicated that the coal miners' strike featured in the movie took place in the early 1970s and I handed it back to her saying, ""No, I'm interested in something with more history in it.""
A few days later, I felt impelled to return to the library and get this VHS.  I sat down to watch it one morning and could not turn it off.  It's compelling, intriguing, educational and emotional.  I cried several times, watching the struggle and learning more and more about a coal miner's life.
For the last few months, I've been doing research (in preparation for a book on Sears Homes) about Standard Oil's coal mines in Macoupin County, Illinois in the 1920s.  ""Harlan County"" showed archival footage and presented information that showed what a miner's life looked like - through the ages.  Duke Power's coal mines in Harlan County, Kentucky were so backwards and Standard Oil's coal mines in Macoupin County, Illinois were so progressive, that I learned more than I ever expected about early 1900s mining techniques.
The story about the man and the mules is something I'll never ever forget.  Or the miner's conversation with the New York policeman.  Thank God for the director Ms. Koppel, who was inspired to create this documentary!  And for her having the wisdom and foresight to record these old miners' reminiscences of life in the coal mines in the early years of the 20th Century.
Suddenly, all the puzzle pieces from my months of book reading and research came together when I saw these old films and heard the miners talk.
I'll be watching it again and again - with my family, too.  And I hope every person who uses electricity in this country will watch it, too.
An interesting aside - in the 1920s in Macoupin County, Illinois, one coal miner died (on average) for every 279,000 tons of coal that was mined.  Between 1900-1969, 100,000 miners died in this country.  Standard Oil's mines (operated from 1918-1925) in Macoupin County may have been the safest mines in the country, but several men died in those mines, too.
In 1918, Standard Oil of Indiana built 192 Sears Modern Homes for their (mostly immigrant) miners in Macoupin County.  (The term ""Modern Homes"" simply meant that the houses had kitchens, bathrooms, running water, central heat and electricity.)
In 1973, Duke Power's miners in Harlan County were still living in shacks with no running water.

208625,5,6300134210,"Not only does Ms. Kopple's work bring to the table the injustice, served daily, in Harlan, but also displays to the viewer the inner politics of powerful, present-day unions.  This film should be required viewing for  every Rank and File member of a Union.  It should also be required viewing  for all management and salaried employees.  The management will say,  ""Good thing I got my degree and I'm not down in the hole with those  redneck miners. Haw-Haw-Haw!""
The Salaried Employees will respond: I  hate my job, I hate my boss, if I could kill everyone in this office, I  would;  NO----  Not my boss, ""like the Nazis"", he's only  following orders.  Not my co-workers---They're only doing their job and  trying to lead a healthy life.
Whom then?  Who do we crucify? In every  management situation there is an overseer and a slave, in every salaried  position, there is an overseer and a slave, AND in every rank and file  position there is an overseer and slaves.
Rank and File, Unite! You  have nothing to lose but your chains, held by your big union and management  Overseers!

208626,5,6300134210,"Produced and directed by Barbara Kopple, the film crew lived with the miners and their families during that period and were able to somehow get into the heart and soul of what it is to be a coal miner.
There are shots  inside the mine where I can almost taste the dust and feel the  claustrophobic confines.  There's a shot of a woman giving a small child a  bath in a tin bathtub and promising that when the strike is over, they  might be able to live in a house with a real bathtub and running water.  There are the miners' wives who are organizing to take a big part in the  strike.  And there are labor songs sung with the voices of people who  really understand what these songs mean.
Most of all though, it is the  faces of the people that I will never forget. There are no professional  actors here; all these people are real.  They are hollow cheeked, with deep  lines etched on their faces and rotted which teeth which have never seen a  dentist.  Some are already victims of black lung disease.  Others speak of  husbands and grandfathers who died in mine explosions.
All this is mixed  with just the right amount of historical footage to give background.  There  is no annoying voice over, just an occasional line of writing superimposed  on the screen to clarify a point or give specific details.  The miners and  their families speak for themselves, sometimes directly into the camera,  other times among each other.
Because of their thick Kentucky accents, I  sometimes found it difficult to get every single word of dialog but this  actually added to the authenticity of the video.  I found myself moved by  their plight, and feeling shivers of emotion throughout.
This stands out  as an outstanding film and understand why it won an academy award.  Recommended.",950486400,13,1777,4.602564102564102

My father and their fathers were hard core Union men. *Harlan,County USA* could not touch the blood that was shed previously to  the 1973 Eastover, mine strike. The film glossed over,the miners and focused  to much attention on the roll women played. Fighting with sticks and  switches. In the 1930s Machines guns were the  miners choice against scabs  and gun thugs. The film with all its historical content,will find its place  in history.

I'm from a coal mining area in SW PA (I lived about 12 miles from where Joseph Yablonski was murdered)and seeing this brings back memories of the struggles that coal miners and their families went through trying to make a living and feed their families back in the day.

A lot of my friends and relatives worked the mines and God bless em.
Dirty and dangerous work.
I remember my uncle walking home from work covered in coal dust from head to toe everyday.
He looked like he stepped out of a minstrel show made up in black face.

I now live in the liberal bay area and the clowns around here keep on defending the illegals ,but just don't get that there are many parts of the US just like Harlen county with poverty a legacy passed on to the next generation through no fault of their own.

And now the libs have declared  war upon coal thinking that it doesn't hurt anyone.

Take a trip though these areas and see how much it doesn't hurt.",1447200000,,1000,4.292553191489362
