He slows things down a bit, but he does not slow them to the point where you can see each pluck.  And the arrangements are thick/intense enough and require enough quick and subtle muting/technique that a beginner (or even a low intermediate like myself) might be overwhelmed.  Oh well.",1216771200,,388,4.746268656716418

Roy Book Binder is a very funny and very talented man.  He also is an apt teacher.  Being a great guitarist does not necessarily translate into teaching talent.  Thankfully, this man has the talent to teach.  He moves quickly, but acknowledges, right from the start, that there will be beginners watching these DVDs.

Although I have had to use the PAUSE button often, it is well worth it.  Book Binder pushes you to develop your own style.  He has an amazing way of keeping the beat going while talking.....in that ""Alice's Resteraunt"" manner that seems so easy, but is really so hard to do.

He is able to spin magic with 3 chords, constantly changing and constantly challenging.  Thankfully, the DVD comes with the TAB, that has both ""easy"" and ""difficult"" versions.

This is for the intermediate guitarist, for the most part, but if you are a true beginner, and really want to learn the blues, start with Homespuns  Easy Steps to Blues Guitar DVD 1 and 2. (see the review there).

After that, you'll b ready for Roy Book Binder along with some other great titles that I have used, including:

 The Blues Bag 2 DVD set by Happy Traum.

This DVD set will provide months of lessons, as well as a very entertaining and talented teacher in your living room.  Homespun uses dual cameras, which bring you in very close and clear to both the right and left hands.  Just a great production!",1180656000,,1443,4.592156862745098
