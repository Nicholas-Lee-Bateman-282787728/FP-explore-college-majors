2509689,5,B000E8NRBC,"A Really Great Movie!,.

It Had Some Fine Acting And Some Very Great Insights Into American History.

Normally I'm not really into this type of flick as seeing a lot of violence in the inner city now I have to admit that Gangster Flicks don't really turn me on O.K.

But In writing my latest book : The Killing Men,

I had to review a lot of Hoodlum Books, Movies and old newsreels both to gain some knowledge and insight into how these men both think and reacted.

And the movie: NITTI really impressed me.

Not just the acting which I thought was good, But In Nitti you get some feeling for the Human Side of these people together with the hard times they lived in which sadly tended to make them into the type of people they became.

Most crime flicks tend to show these guys as a bunch of Machine Gun wielding fiends but this movie gives a more 'Balanced View' of the backgrounds of some of these guys as it was both enjoyable to watch and quite entertaining.

Plus it really helped me to write a much better book!,.

So my advise is to buy NITTI and watch the Movie.

I think you'll enjoy it.

Nuff Said.

2509690,5,B000E8NRBC,"I very much enjoyed this movie that brought to life an era in American history that I thought was just going to be a gangster flick. Its focus was on one man who had a larger role than the name and history chapters thatI was already familiar with such as Al Capone, Prohibition,and the Depression. Anthony La Paglia did a wonderful job of portraying Nitti as smart, determined, ruthless and with a hint of decency. I sometimes felt sad for him. I enjoyed the movie very much.",1338595200,5,475,4.471264367816092

2509692,3,B000E8NRBC,"FRANK NITTI: THE ENFORCER is a semi-fictonal made-for-TV account of the life of Al Capone's ""button"" man. Nitti the gangster and Nitti the family man are both explored and the contrast between the two is startling. A 95 minute time constraint tends to make the story telescopically episodic.

The Sicilian-born Nitti first made a living in America as a barber. His side activity as jewel thief and fence drew the small-time crook into organized crime, and he quickly rose to become first an enforcer and then a front for the Capone mob.

A 1932 attempt on Nitti's life by the Chicago police failed. In 1943, after several extortion indictments were handed down, others in the Outfit placed blamed on Nitti. The day before he was to appear before a grand jury, the disgraced mobster ended his own life with a bullet to the head. His suicide was witnessed by two railroad workers.

2509693,4,B000E8NRBC,Lives up to the story of the true Frank Nitty. Its a good item for those collecting gangster films.,1201392000,7,99,4.2631578947368425
2509694,4,B000E8NRBC,"I bought this movie for two reasons, 1. I love Anthony Lapaglia and 2. I love Movies with Al Capone in them.
This movie didn't dissappoint me at all.  While it centered around Organized Crime in Chicago in the 20's and 30's that wasn't the basis of the movie.  It showed Frank Nitti as a man and as a person not just as the Enforcer for Al.  I thought the best scene was in the courthouse when the cops were trying to frame Frank for a shooting he didn't commit.  The cop shot him and was going to lie and testify that Frank shot back.  The cop changed his testimony and when the trial was over Frank went in the mens' room and there were the two guys who were hired to kill him.  He told them not to worry they were just doing there jobs they would be safe and he wouldn't come after them.  I thought wow that's really a huge thing to do in that business.  It shows how while Nitti was a very powerful man he dealt with a lot of personal hardship as well.
This is definatley a movie worth seeing.",1188000000,15,997,4.051020408163265
