I never knew of John Portman before seeing this and I now have insight to the great contributions this man have made to US commercial architecture and even to global commercial building design. I really loved the way the producers included the family life of Mr. Portman and how he was as a father to his children even with the busy life that he had as both an architect and building commercial real estate developer.",1376179200,2,505,4.382978723404255
8552657,5,B00AJER3GG,As I write this I am in one of Portmans buildings.  After watching this document I have a whole new perspective on the spaces contained within.  They were clearly designed to be used.  In his own words he was first most an Architect.,1526169600,,233,4.372093023255814
8552658,1,B00AJER3GG,"Awful. This isn't the first (or the last) architecture documentary to be funded by its subject, but it is certainly one of the most heavy-handed examples. There are some decent moments that cover his contributions, but the film is tarnished by an overpowering self-congratulatory tone throughout.",1521590400,,296,5.456521739130435
8552659,5,B00AJER3GG,"While their are similarities drawn between Portman and Frank Lloyd Wright, both have their own unique twists. Obviously, Wright has been dead for a half-century, thus his work has become iconic. In any event, this was a great retrospective into the art, sculpture and incredible architecture of John Portman with an eye to the future works coming to a city near you. Great biography as I really enjoyed his story, beliefs, philosophy and even his family members. If you love architecture, you'll enjoy this deep immersion into one of Americas greatest architects ... Enjoy !!",1500336000,,575,5.063157894736842

8552662,5,B00AJER3GG,I knew of John Portman but I didn't realize how prolific of an Architect he was and how many hotels I've stayed in that he designed. He is a visionary and his decision to be a Developer and Architect was pure genius.

8552664,2,B00AJER3GG,"It always breaks my heart when people choose to profane God's name when He is the very one who has given us life - and even more importantly - His beloved Son, Jesus ... ""In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins."" (1 John 4:10) ""You shall not take the name of The LORD your God in vain, for The LORD will not hold guiltless anyone who takes His name in vain.""
