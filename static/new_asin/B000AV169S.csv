8433367,3,B000AV169S,The content of this video is fine for what it is. The animation is great and probably more for little kids like toddlers and preschoolers. They mainly teach through song and dance to keep little ones attention spans. This video I would recommend for younger children as it would be too juvenile for kids 5+. I have a son who is going to be eight this year. Parents do know their children best however.,1380758400,,401,4.4324324324324325
