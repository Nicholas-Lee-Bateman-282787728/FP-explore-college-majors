2486528,5,B000E3L7FK,"Season three of Bewitched is the first `color' season supported by me and other series purists. This 33-episode 1966-1967 season also introduces some very important characters and clever allusions to the era of series production.  Once again, it is an essential purchase for people seeking a genuinely classic TV DVD series.

The season opens with Tabitha's own powers being revealed during her pediatric visit (""Nobody's Perfect"").  This creates pressure for Tabitha to be enrolled in a `witches school'---against the wishes of Samantha and Darrin-Tabitha's own parents.  We also meet the eccentric Dr. Bombay (Bernard Fox)-whose remedies have `interesting' side effects-he is after all a `witch doctor!

Samantha's famous good nature is tested by her witch relatives during this season. Nobody does this more frequently than the well-intentioned but goofy Aunt Clara (Marion Lorne).  She makes several appearances as both a comic foil to Samantha and a sharp contrast to the sardonic Endora.

During ""Accidental Twins"" Aunt Clara accidentally makes a double of Jonathan Tate during a babysitting assignment, During `The moment of truth' Aunt Clara is almost blamed for showing her witch powers in public until the Stephens's finally recognize Tabitha is the one levitating objects around.  Like Clark Kent's secret identity, Samantha Stephens and other witches are supposed to keep their capabilities `private'.

Realizing that she causes snafus, Aunt Clara proposes to turn herself into `something useful'. Panic ensues when Samantha and others briefly assume that she has become a cow (""The Corn is as High as a Guernsey's Eye""). The witches council attempts to penalize Aunt Clara in ""The Trial and Error of Aunt Clara"" fortunately, they have a very big last-minute change of heart when her magic does in fact work-on THEM.

""Dangerous Diaper Dan: and ""Super Car"" invoke the `spy movie'---itself really popular during the cold war. Both of these episodes seem very kitschy now, but they accurately reflect the genre's fascination with secret people not exactly who they have claimed to be (like Samantha) and hi-tech `secret' gizmos enabling the product user to do anything (not coincidentally unlike `witchcraft'). Watching these episodes in the context of their own day is best. Otherwise, they don't have the same holding power.

Ditto for ""Sam in the Moon"". Darrin is riveted to what coverage of the moon is then available, but Samantha says she has already been there. Airing years before the 1969 moonwalk, this episode then-suggested the only way a person could walk on space was if they were magical-but it did `tease' that `other' people would.

This season also tried importing historical characters to the-then present-day. Endora claims to loathe `Durwood' but has Sigmund Freud (Normal Fell) himself counsel him and her daughter when their marriage appears heading for the rocks- (""I'd Rather Twitch Than Fight""). If Endora did not actually care, she would not have had THE eminent psychologist himself intervene.

Less effective however is bringing Benjamin Franklin (""My Friend Ben""/""Samantha for the Defense"") in for an ad agency campaign,  nobody seems to notice  that this `mystery man's' mannerisms, dress, and voice emphatically are not 20th century and do not question why either. I'm guessing the scriptwriters needed a `quick idea' when they came up with this one!

Overall though, Montgomery, York and the rest of this cast continued placing audiences under a powerful spell of entertainment which continues holding today. The third season of Bewitched is a delightful potion-even without extras!",1142985600,32,3625,5.3668430335097
2486529,5,B000E3L7FK,"Season three of Bewitched brought the series to homes in 1966 in full, living color...not the colorized versions of the seasons one & two DVD sets. By and large I've found that TV Land has done a pretty horrible job in its selection of programming.  There are far too many lame series that they televise but at least they've got Bewitched, my favorite show growing up as a kid.  Season three had a whopping 33 shows, a far cry from the 20 or 22 most shows these day have.  Bewitched is a classic in every sense of the word.  Elizabeth Montgomery and Dick York were perfect as Samantha and Darrin Stephens.  I've really come to appreciate York's talents much more in recent years and there's no doubt he left a big void when he left after season five.  The supporting cast really made this show rise above other shows of the mid-1960's.  There was no end to the screwball cast with Agnes Moorehead as Sam's interfering mother Endora, David White as Darrin's pushy boss Larry Tate, Marion Lorne as the absent-minded but loveable Aunt Clara, Paul Lynde as the sarcastic Uncle Arthur, and Bernard Fox as the pompous Dr. Bombay.  The cast was so talented as were the writers that the series always remained fresh and funny.

As the first reviewer already provided a synopsis of each episode, I will instead point out a handful of my favorite episodes from this season.

""Witches & Warlocks are my Favorite Things"" - I love this episode!  Sam takes Tabitha before the witches council to be tested and she proves so talented  that Endora and her sisters Enchatra and Hagatha, want to put Tabitha in a witch's school against Sam and Darrin's wishes.  Sam is powerless to stop the three witches until Sam's father Maurice saves the day and banishes the witch trio to the top of a snow covered mountain.  He brings them back on the condition that they promise to never again interfere with Tabitha.

""Endora Moves in for a Spell"" - Endora and Uncle Arthur engage in a battle of influences over little Tabitha.  Endora pops a house onto a previously vacant lot and says she's moving in, causing Gladys Kravitx to go hysterical and call the police.  The appearing and disappearing house continues to befuddle both Gladys and the cops.

""My Friend Ben""  Aunt Clara zaps up the real Ben Franklin to the Stephens' home and can't remember how to send him back.  Larry thinks it's all a stunt for a new ad campaign but then Ben disappears to visit the city and causes general chaos by taking a fire engine for a drive and crashing it.

""Samantha for the Defense"" in a continuation of the last episode, Ben Franklin has been accused of stealing a fire engine but has since been sent back in time.  Aunt Clara has to bring Ben back to stand trial as Sam and Ben take over the case to prove Ben's innocence.

""The Trial and Error of Aunt Clara"" Aunt Clara is put on trial by the witches council to see if she should be kicked out due to her failing powers.  Aunt Clara doesn't help her case by continuing to foul things up but in the end, with help from Sam, Aunt Clara gets to remain in the council.

""No More Mr. Nice Guy""  After Darrin blows up at Endora again, she places a spell on Darrin to make everyone who meets him have an instant dislike for him.  This results in their advertising firm to lose a client, a woman accuses him of making a pass, and even the drunk at a bar doesn't like him.

I could probably put a whole bunch more in here because this show is just so fantastic but you get the general idea.  On top of everything else, at

$28 for 33 episodes is a great bargain to boot.

2486601,4,B000E3L7FK,"This was a terrific show.  I enjoyed Agnes Moorehead, Dick York, Elizabeth Montgomery, along with other cast members during this show.  It was clean family fun.  Elizabeth Montgomery's cast of family actors, consisted of a great line up of funny people.  Each one contributing great performances with their characters.

Mrs. Kravitz, the nosy neighbor, was hilarious.  The second Mrs. Kravitz was okay, but not as good as the first.  Agnes Moorehead is the perfect mean mother'-in-law.  After all is done to Darren, I think she really liked him.  Dick York was so much better at playing Darrin than Dick Sargent.  I think this part was meant for him.  His chemistry with Elizabeth Montgomery was believable.  I did not feel that with Dick Sargent.

Comedies have changed much over the decades, but clean family fun is the best in my book.  Would be great if more family shows were made.",1420243200,2,886,4.859060402684563

2486624,4,B000E3L7FK,"Loved the show, too bad they didn't handle the transfer better.  Still, at the price, not a bad addition. As for the cast, it's a damned pity we lost Elizabeth Taylor at such a young age, and Agnes Moorehead, an amazingly talented veteran of stage and screen, skillfully added to her character in the show.  To those who complain that Dick York was absent from some episodes - read his bio - he was suffering from a severe back injury which occurred a few years earlier while filming ""They Came to Cordura"" whicn never healed properly.  It's amazing to me that he was able to continue working at all after that!... His generosity in helping raise funds for the needy (which he himself became near the end of his life) was also most noteworthy.  I urge you to learn more about this underrated actor.
-One last note... While I'll have to agree that the writing for seasons 1 and 2 does seem better, and the sad loss of Alice Pearce, who truly ""owned"" the role of Gladys Kravitz. This is somewhat offset by the introduction of more quirky characters and the development and growth of Aunt Clara, Uncle Arthur, etc., as the series continues. (Until the end of York's role as ""Darrin"",that is, at which point as far I'm concerned, was the end of Bewitched)",1392336000,2,1251,4.546666666666667
2486625,5,B000E3L7FK,"Love the writing and acting, back when entertainment wasn't about shock or excitement, classic fun. I recommend this for people who want to be entertained only.",1392249600,,160,5.1923076923076925

2486628,5,B000E3L7FK,"This is a wonderful season of Bewitched: the first one in color! The picture is more vivid and detailed than the first two seasons so that you can see the beautiful one year old Tabitha, a tanned and brunette rooted Samantha, a colorful and mischevous Endora, and all the rest of your favorite characters! In this season a new Mrs. Kravitz and Louise come about. It's great to see that they can fuffill the roles of the old characters so well. All together I saved money because it would've cost more to buy this at a store. I know that I will buy more seasons of Bewitched. Click the add to cart button and get ready to feel the magic!",1384473600,,636,4.308333333333334
2486629,5,B000E3L7FK,"The first season of ""real"" color for Bewitched and the show doesn't lose any of its charm. And adding to that charm is little Erin Murphy who makes her debut as baby Tabatha--complete with magical powers that has her mortal daddy Darrin Stephens wigging out at various times throughout the course of Season 3.

And of course, we get more of the Darrin/Endora battles which I really look forward to, as ""Darwin"" and Endora butt heads on a number of subjects--including Derwood's wish that Endora not practice any of her hocus pocus in front of Tabatha. I lose count of how many times she hexes Darrin but there will be plenty more to come in the following seasons.

Plus Season 3 features the return of Paul Lynde as practical joking Uncle Arthur & the first appearance of Bernard Fox as Dr. Bombay in the Season 3 finale. Missing is the familiar refrain ""Calling Dr. Bombay, emergency come right away.""

The only things that might be wrong with Bewitched in its 3rd year is that Alice Pearce is definitely missed as Gladys Kravitz. Not that I dislike Sandra Gould, but Alice was one of a kind imo.

And we get our first glimpses of the dark cloud that would hang over the show in the following 2 years--that being the absence of Dick York for a few episodes due to Darrin Stephens being ""away on business.""

Of course, it's only for 2 episodes this time around but the show definitely loses something when York is not present, which leads to me pointing out one of the more ironic statements from Samantha Stephens when she says in one episode ""I could never zap up another Darrin Stephens."" At least, not until year 6 of the show.

But--despite those few quibbles--year three of Bewitched is marvelous and sure to please long time fans of the show. 5 stars",1384473600,,1757,4.561904761904762

2486685,4,B000E3L7FK,"Okay everyone give me a collective groan.......
  The third season of BEWITCHED was good, especiallly with the introduction of Tabitha in the previous season. In this one she is growing up and displaying her magical powers, which leaves Samantha and Darrin with their hands full. For one, trying to get her to control her powers(she's more stubborn than Endora), trying to hide the fact that Samantha is a witch, but with Aunt Clara, Endora, and the rest of Samantha's family causing havoc, especially with the prying eyes of Mrs Kravits( the first one before she passed away). And correct me if I am wrong, I do believe this is where we first meet Uncle Arthur, one of the most beloved withces this side of Aunt Clara. And yes I referred to him as a witch(not because it's Paul Lynde...), BUT the term witch is gender neutral. THe early Chirstians messed it allup. A warlock is a witch who is evil and goes against their own coven. Why do Iknow this? I am a witch myself.
So, should you buy it? I think you should, BEWITCHED is an endearing classic series stayed in the top ten for several seasons. Also, Elizabeth Montgomery, that's all I gots say about it",1292803200,,1158,4.5625

A few months ago my Mother who was 88 at the time, quietly passed away in her sleep.  I was at Wal-Mart a few days earlier when I saw the 3rd and 4th seasons of Bewitched packaged together,and for one low price, I flipped. I eaglerly snatched up the two season deal, and just now finished watching the 3rd season. Now, just started watching the 4th season.  Elizabeth and Dick York are fantastic together, and I just wish that I could have showed these season to my Mom, she would have loved watching them again.  So many wonderful episodes, and the characters, Endora, Serena, Uncle Arther, but to me Aunt Clara passed them all, her episodes with Elizabeth and Dick were great. I had no idea that in the middle of the fourth season that she had passed away, and the Dick in the fifth season, was going thru some real health and back pain at the time. In the sixth season when Dick York couldn't play Darrin anymore, I was very pessismistic about Dick Sargent, but I enjoyed him alot.  True, he was no Dick York but he added a sort of flair to Darrin that I enjoyed. The last season of Bewitched was the weakest for me to enjoy. But I digress, Bewitched, was one the best shows of the sixties, and along with The Addams Family.  These two shows were my favorite.  Now, I have to decide if I want to buy Seasons one and two together in one deals.

2486724,5,B000E3L7FK,"""Bewitched"" began its 3rd season on ABC in the fall of 1966. The show went through many changes, both on the screen and off. First of all the show began to produce its shows in color. This addded to the realism of the series, as we are treated to episodes that really showed off their beauty while being enhanced by color. There were also a few memorable cast changes too; Irene Vernon decided to retire from acting, so Kasey Rogers became the new Louise Tate. The biggest change was with the character of Galdys, as Alice Pearce had died in March of 1966. Producers thought of writing out the Kravitzes, but realized they were too vital to the show, so Sandra Gould took over from Alice. This was also the year the Television Academy finally honored both Elizabeth Montgomery and Agnes Moorehead for Emmy nominations, although neither won.
 This DVD set contains 33 spellbinding episodes for your enjoyment. We also discover if Tabitha is a witch! Buy the boxset to find out.
 ""Bewitched"" also continued to be a Top 10 ratings winner in the national Nielsens, so its popularity continued unabated.",1238457600,4,1098,4.7434554973821985

2486726,4,B000E3L7FK,"Yes, some other reviewers have it right when they say it doesn't match up to the first two seasons.  It's true for much of season 3, and continues into season four, with some episodes that seem to lack some of the cleverness and entertainment value of the first 2 seasons.  The original Gladys Cravitz is sorely missed.  Two episodes that I really enjoyed in Season 3 were on disc 4, ""No More Mr Nice Guy"", where Endora makes Darrin suddenly hated by people, and ""It's wish-craft"", where Tabitha is going through a phase where whoever she wishes for will appear.  And she keeps bringing her father.  As Darrin's in-laws are coming for the weekend, Sam enlists her mother's help in preventing Tabitha in her ""wish-craft"" - there's a really funny scene in this one where Darrin gets rained on by this little thundershower that follows him wherever he goes.

Yes, there are some fun moments in this season i guess.  Another great one is on the second disc ""Oedipus Hex"" - to prove Darrin would be a pain if he had too much time off, Endora 'spikes' the popcorn and suddenly Darrin decides to take the day off and then anybody that comes by and eats the popcorn decides to stay and take the day off with Darrin, and they're all just as high and happy as kites.  It's funny watching the milkman, the repairman and the cop suddenly drop their work persona and start bantering with each other as if they were suddenly old friends.  ""A Gazebo Never Forgets"" is another good episode on the same disc 2, where a child's stuffed elephant turns into a real one.  Season 3 was released in 1966 and you can feel the times a little.  It's got it's charm, this season, but in comparison to season 2 I'd still have to say it's come down a notch overall.  The witchcraft is weaker.. though there are some 'bewitching' moments.",1224720000,,1808,4.512269938650307

2486740,4,B000E3L7FK,"The Third Season of BEWITCHED was actually a season of several important ""Firsts."" The Third Season was the first season of episodes shot in color. Erin and Diane Murphy  also join the cast in the role of little toddler Tabitha.

  THIRD SEASON HIGHLIGHTS:

 In the episode ""Witches And Warlocks Are A Few Of My Favorite Things"",  Tabitha's witchly powers are tested on a weekend. Samantha  ( Elizabeth Montgomery) explains that, although it is the weekend, her husband Darrin (Dick York) has to work. Aunt Hagatha  (Reta Shaw) happily replies, ""Good. Humans emit such a low-grade frequency they upset my instruments.""
  Samantha at first tries to avoid telling  Darrin that Tabitha has inherited her special powers. Later, Samantha and Darrin have a hectic time trying to keep the truth about Tabitha from Darrin's boss Larry and his wife Louise (David White and Kasey Rogers.)
  ""BEWITCHED"": THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON"" is best as a perfect showcase for the talents of wonderful Marion Lorne as sweet, bumbling, delightfully vague Aunt Clara, who causes much unintentional havoc in the Stephens household. Clara causes a massive Statewide electrical blackout. The Stephens' residence remains the only household for miles with the lights miraculously still on! Clara accidentally zaps both Queen Victoria and Ben Franklin back from the past. The two historical people become two very ""SURPRISE!"" houseguests. Clara also gives Larry and Louise ""Accidental Twins"" when she magically creates an identical double of their son.

 Samantha travels back in time to save Darrin from a curse in ""A Most Unusual Wood Nymph""; where she meets Darrin's ancestor Darrin The Bold, also played by Dick York. In ""Bewitched, Bothered and Infuriated,"" Darrin and Samantha travel back in time to prevent Larry from having a terrible accident. All this occurs because of some mis-information from Aunt Clara. The Witches Society finally has enough of Clara's magical mis-fires,  and,  in the outstanding episode ""The Trial And Error Of Aunt CLara"", they seek to excommunicate her. Samantha immediately leaps to her defense; but she only nearly avoids disaster as she simultaneously tries to defend her beloved Aunt and keep Darrin busy in the den so he won't find out what exactly is going on in the living room!!

* Episode #101: The Crone Of Cawdor: (3-16-67): This is a strangely weird, mystical and delightful episode. Dorothy Neuman plays a 500-year old crone who switches places with Darrin's attractive client Terry Warbell (Julie Gregg). The Crone hopes that Darrin will kiss her; thereby she will steal Darrin's youth! The transformed and confused Terry shows  up at the Kravitz's house. Gladys (Sandra Gould) telephones Samantha about the strange visitor. Gladys says, ""I have a feeling she's YOUR kind of people.""

 *Episode 106: ""Nobody but a Frog Knows How To Live"" (4-27-67): Character actor John Fiedler makes a memorable guest appearance as Fergus, a ""human frog"" who hopes that Samantha can unhex a hex and turn him back into a frog.

In the last episode of the Third Season, (Episode 107:: 5-4-67)  titled ""There's Gold In Them There Pills,"" Bernard Fox makes his first appearance as Dr. Bombay. The wacky-quaky witch doctor finds an instant miracle cure for the common cold; but his cure has  an hilarious side-effect on mere mortals!",1174176000,,3332,5.148698884758364

2486750,4,B000E3L7FK,"""Bewitched"" was a classic TV series for its first four seasons (and bits of seasons five, six and seven are worth watching--but avoid season eight!), spinning out family-oriented humor which nonetheless directly explored issues involving marriage, feminism and even the counterculture (represented by Samantha's magical world, which had much in common with the emerging folk/hippie movement, versus the straight proto-yuppie world Darrin and Larry come from).  The characters were always colorful, the plots largely original (at least, up until season five or so) and Elizabeth Montgomery was absolutely stunning as Samantha, while Agnes Moorehead was regal as Endora.

The first season was a delightful introduction to this world, and is now available in color or B&W versions (purists prefer the B&W version, of course, although it is definitely worth it to see the episodes in color).  It was slightly more dramatic in tone than later years; with season two the comedy element took over in a big way and to these eyes was the peak of the series, with many memorable episodes and characters (it is also available in both formats, and again, I prefer it in color, as the magical 60s world of ""Bewitched"" always seemed to me more suited for color).

Season three continued the roll established in the first few years, this time fully in color.  The pace quickened even more from the second season and the focus was on Tabitha's newly acquired ""wishcraft"" powers; Endora also now seemed to be bugging Darrin bigtime every week although this had not become tiresome yet, and Darrin was still a semi-likeable, human character and not yet a caricature of a dominating, mindless ad-exec bore.  Serena, introduced in season two, is missing from action but Aunt Clara, Uncle Arthur, Maurice, and a new set of relatives (Hagatha and Enchantra) get their moments, and Dr. Bombay is introduced.  Louise and Gladys Kravitz were replaced by new actresses at this time but the change was not too noticable, especially in the case of Louise who looked and acted a lot like her forebear (however, I do not like the Kravitz of the color episodes as much as the B&W one).

Episode higlights include ""Accidental Twins"", with a lot of slapstick humor, ""Endora Moves In For A Spell""/""Twitch Or Treat"", with Uncle Arthur at his very best (and I disagree that these did not hit the heights of the ""Yagazuzie"" episode, these may be my favorite ever Uncle Arthur episodes), ""The Trial and Error Of Aunt Clara"" (funny, with a touching ending), ""Three Wishes"", ""The Crone Of Cawdor"" (clever plot twists here), ""There's Gold In Them There Pills"" (Dr. Bombay was always a scream) and ""Bewitched, Bothered And Infuriated"" (Larry is particularly great as the bothered victim).  It's all fun, and in color, and you should check it out!",1153872000,6,2804,5.0

2486752,4,B000E3L7FK,"The third season of BEWITCHED (the first season to be filmed in full-colour) features Elizabeth Montgomery, Dick York and Agnes Moorehead at the top of their game, with a wacky gallery of supporting players and a roster of guest stars.  This season offers some of the most inventive, outlandish and memorable episodes, many heavily featuring Tabitha (now a mischievous toddler) played by Erin Murphy.  The cast remained fairly unchanged except for Gladys Kravitz, now played by Sandra Gould (Alice Pearce died suddenly from ovarian cancer after Season 2), and Kasey Rogers replaced Irene Vernon as Larry Tate's wife Louise.  This season introduces the beloved character of Doctor Bombay, played by Bernard Fox, as well as Esmeralda, played by Alice Ghostley (though Ghostley had appeared as another character in an episode of Season Two).  With the introduction of colour, the storylines and designs for characters became more stylised.  With Seasons One and Two mostly focusing on establishing the relationship and married life of Sam and Darrin, Season Three saw some of the supporting characters get some meaty episodes in which to shine.  Additionally, both Elizabeth Montgomery and Agnes Moorehead would receive Emmy nominations for their work in this season.

BEWITCHED remains, over 40 years later, still a hugely popular sitcom, because the whole premise of the show and the question it addresses (""how powerful can a woman be while still having a mutually-balanced marriage?"") is still being asked and discussed today.

2486753,5,B000E3L7FK,"In Many respects, the most well known shows will be from this  season for many people. I guess they selected the most from the first colour  season when in syndication. But, when handled well, these shows work very well in Colour as they did in Black and White, especially  when Directed by William Asher. Asher seemed to be able to reduce the amount of ""wire"" one could see on camera, where-as  other  directors just let it show, and I guess that is why Asher was kept on as a Production Consultant.
The DVD is well done, with some Menu variation, but is overall basic, except for the advertising that hits you on the start of disc  4, but can be easily skipped over. And this is at least the second set that the sleeve notes have minor errors ( the Tates son is misnamed on the episode where Clara duplicates the son), and I'll let you spot the rest.
Dr Bombay appears at the end of disk 4 ( but had appeared earlier, chronologically, in JEANNIE).
You will also notice absences of Darrin ( the first and only genuine, Darrin), and this is supposedly due to his back injury and the hectic production schedule.
Anyways, whilst the extras are basically non-existent, the collection is superb.
Listing the shows in a review appears incredibly superfluous, especially when there are web sites that cover this aspect much better, and get the details right..
This is a fun series, and entertaining series, and, if its important to you, very family friendly.",1149120000,9,1452,4.608527131782946

2486755,5,B000E3L7FK,"The hype about colourisation is overated. Not everything is black and white (pardon). It is nice to see where we were going with television and were we came from.
when I baught the first season I had read to much about the colourisation of series one. I did not know what to buy. I baught the coloured version and was very impressed. Really, unless you are going too watch it 24/7 and pick it too pieces it does not matter. It looks fantastic and has a new lease of life. In fact the colours are very impressive. However if you wish to view it in black and white simply turn the colour off. SIMPLY!
There were no extra features which was a shame.
Certainly worth a place in a loved dvd library.",1147737600,3,694,4.265151515151516
2486756,5,B000E3L7FK,"What a joyful experience watching this 3rd season of ""Bewitched"" is.  It helps give me perspective that the times in which I grew up were a little less complex, although they hardly seemed so at the time.  The comedy here is sweet.  The biting, deprecating put-downs and insults that are standard humor in many modern shows are absent here.  The emphasis is on character and situation, with the special magical twist giving the show an individual style.  Elizabeth Montgomery, Dick York & Agnes Morehead continue to deliver great energy to the episodes.  Marian Lorne as Aunt Clara still makes me cackle with delight at her brand of ""going-every-whichway"" confusion.

I found the episodes to hold up a consistently good standard and enjoy watching them in sequence rather than catching episodes on TV reruns.  Michael Ansara makes a fine appearance as the king in ""A Most Unusual Wood Nymph.""  ""The Short Happy Circuit of Aunt Clara"" was particularly hilarious as she accidentally blacks out the entire eastern seaboard.  I enjoyed the mix-ups that they assume Aunt Clara makes by having a cow running around an office building in ""The Corn is as High as a Guernsey's Eye.""  The season is interesting in that they magically import historical figures like Queen Victoria, Sigmund Freud & Ben Franklin and then have the problems of assimilating them into the modern age.  A couple of times the technical digital quality sags as Samantha's dress starts moving in neon TV patterns, but the sound and color are strong throughout all four discs.  This is a collection that will highlight many a rainy day!  Enjoy!",1147564800,4,1607,4.947761194029851
2486767,5,B000E3L7FK,"I just added the third season of this beloved, timeless television show to my collection and now own the complete set. I can watch these episodes over and over. They are sheer delightful escapism and entertainment. Growing up in the 70's and early 80's, I sat glued to countless reruns of the series, starting from the colour episodes. The early black and white ones were actually unfamiliar to me, as was the actress who first played Mrs Kravitz (I now think I actually prefer her in the role, the second one was a bit snooty and not as funny).
This aside however, I find the third season equally enjoyable as the first two, particularly because my favourite character; dear, sweet, bumbling Aunt Clara appears often. As a child of the colour generation, I really don't think I would enjoy Bewitched as much in B&W, and I thought they did a fine job of colourizing 1 & 2. You'd miss so much, the vibrant colours of the 60's retro settings and costumes, not to mention Endora's shock of orange hair and blue eyemakeup.
In retort to one reviewer's rather harsh comments: I think Elizabeth Montgomery looks equally gorgeous in this season. A truly, and naturally, stunning woman, long before botox and liposuction. She's slimmed down a bit here and has lost some of the earlier softness to her face, but to say she looks 10 years older..hardly. Keeping in mind too, this was moving into the late 60's period and fashions, and the visual style of these episodes is simply a product of the times, suntans, bouffy hairdos and all. I also ,for one, found the presence of baby Tabitha a sheer delight, what a truly exquisite child. There were actually two child actors that played her, I know (I think they were sisters or twins?) both beautiful, but I'm refering particularly to the main one seen in the close ups, talking and nose twitching scenes, who was just an absolute doll.
Along with the Aunt Clara episodes, of which the 'Accidental Twins' would have to be the funniest. The most hilarious situations and precious comedy, are born from where Endora casts her spells on Darrin. The best of this series is undoubtedly 'I remember you... sometimes', that sees Darrin become, thanks to his Mother in Law's usual tricks, a 'know it all' expert on every subject; much to the annoyance of Larry and their client. I think I appreciate Dick York's amazing comic timing a lot more now than when I was growing up, he really was the quintessential Darrin, an empathetic character, but who's male pride and big mouth always land him in trouble with his unusual in -laws. He may not be the Rock Hudson of leading men, true, but he had a lovely chemistry with Montgomery and you truly believed the love they had for each other, as a couple in the show. Also, he had to be your 'Mr Average', otherswise he wouldn't have been such a target for Samantha's family to pick on. It also brings more depth to Samantha's genuine love and devotion for him. Agnes Moorehead as always, is wonderfully theatrical as Endora. In a sense she became a metaphor for the Mother in Law from Hell, not to be messed with. What a fun role that must have been to play. I just can't see anyone else playing Samantha but Elizabeth, she has such warmth, charm and charisma in the role. I couldn't really take Nicole Kidman at all in the remake, I must confess.
This season sees the return of my other favourite, Uncle Arthur, in a couple of episodes where he battles it out with Endora,( Endora Moves in for a Spell and Twitch or Treat),and also introduces the eccentric, Dr Bombay (There's gold in them thar pills), who like Uncle Arthur, actually appeared as a different character in earlier shows. The only one missing is Cousin Serena. As well as the regular witchly visitors, there's an array of historical and famous figures being conjured up throughout season 3, from Benjamin Franklin and Queen Victoria to Sigmund Freud, who incidently does a very convincing and amusing impression in an episode which pokes fun at modern Psychoanalysis in relationships.
The Complete Third Season is a continuation of the vintage quality television sitcom that was Bewitched. They just don't make them like this anymore. Obviously a labour of love for its creators and most innovative for its time, it will be enjoyed for generations to come. Bewitched is a fun, fantasy comedy that captures (and reminds us of) a simpler and more innocent time, and makes us wish we could live in Samantha's world where a wave of the hand and twitch of a nose fixes everything.",1147478400,10,4515,4.680503144654088
2486768,5,B000E3L7FK,"I have read quite a few valid complaints about the show here in Season 3. It is quite a slow starter and the writing does seem to try a bit too hard with the hijinks angle as opposed to the fantastic relationship angles of the first two seasons, however, the Charlie Harper episode, the inclusion of Tabitha, and the quite a few ''hijinks shows'' that actually work propel this season.

Hard to imagine a show so all over the map as Bewitched. It can make you sigh with disdain at silly characters like Diaper Dan, then, the next instant it can make you shed a tear with the likes of the Charlie Harper ""moments"". Tabitha can be annoying at times but it brings out the best in everyone like Maurice Evans and just makes the show warmer and feel more grounded. The color can be rough, in fact the ""colorized"" Seasons brought out by Sony actually looked BETTER! Before you turn a blind eye and assume the worst, please at least give those a try, you may be surprised.

The sizable disagreement I have with other reviewers here are over the several ""Endora does something to Darrin"" episodes in this season; call me sadistic but I think this is just about the pinnacle of the comedy portions of the show, they are priceless IMO! Dick York had such an engaging enthusiasm in this department, I'm glad the writers capitolized on it. ""I Remember You... Sometimes"" is so well written and so perfectly executed it's hard to imagine if this is one that would have been whittled away HAD THEY cut them down in number. I also have no problem with the ""new"" Mrs. Kravitz. I think the character is more of a ""persona"" than an actual person, and both people chosen filled the bill perfectly.

The fantasy place in time of Bewitched is just a great place to visit, no matter whose writing the scripts. If you don't crack a smile with the episode ""Super Car"", you're too far gone to deal with anyway:)

We miss you Samantha and Darrin!!",1146355200,10,1920,4.477142857142857
2486769,3,B000E3L7FK,"If there was ever any doubt about the artistic superiority of black-and-white over color(except over at the Playboy Channel), watching the marvelous first two seasons of ""Bewitched"" in their natural B&W, and then moving on to Season Three in color removes it. What a shocking drop off, in just about every way! Mid-60s TV color was especially gruesome, so we should I suppose cut Bill Asher a break. But not much of one, because it was his choice to make everyone look as if they spent all day under the sunlamp. And it was his choice to, for gosh-knows-what-reason, move the camera in within 2 inches of everyone's nose, giving us one looming close-up after another.

(The monsters who came up with the nitwit idea to ""colorize"" things could make up for their sins by ""black-and-whitizing"" movies and shows that need it, starting with ""Bewitched"", ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and the final season of ""The Fugitive"".)

Elizabeth Montgomery comes off especially bad here. She looks 10 years older than she did at the close of Season Two, all because of that damn color and that hideous tan. She also does a lot of mugging and eye-popping and eye-rolling and all sorts of other acting ticks. WHY? Was there a new director for Year Three? Or did, as I suspect, black-and-white soften her and make her seem more natural?

The great Dick York also suffers. The combination of the Miami Beach tan, the bad make-up, and the very short haircut makes him seem like the last dude in the world a beautiful witch would marry. And again, his crazed manner when frustrated - delightful and charming in B&W - seems over the top in color. And rather annoying.

The only one who seems unaffected by the gross shift in atmosphere is the magnificent Agnes Moorehead. Maybe because they did not force her to look like Don Johnson, or maybe because she's one of the greatest actresses we've ever had. (Her performance in ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" is beyond compare.)

On top of the terrible color, there are other problems. The focus on the annoying Tabitha, the new Mrs. Kravitz, the new Louise, the producer's decision to rip open the harmony of the show by adding crazy new characters and guest spots.

""Bewitched"" was a great show, for two years. Stop there.",1146182400,5,2240,4.745501285347044
2486770,5,B000E3L7FK,"Bewitched, still one of the best shows in televesion history as withstood the test of time in full force without any doubts. Way before it's time, Bewitched still manages to make me smile with every single episode. Season 3 is no exception. We luckily get to see the funny antics of ""Marion Lorne"" Aunt Clara one last time as she sadly dies of heart attack shortly after season 3 was finished. Marion Lorne is surely everyone's favorite Aunt, I still laugh everytime she comes down that chimney.

Sadly, ""Alice Pearce"" is nowhere to be found.  She was, without a doubt, the best Mrs. Kravitz. She died shortly after Season 2 with cancer. Sandra Gould, her replacement does a respectable job, but her antics, spunk and acting abilities are not up to speed with Alice Pearce and it shows in Season 3. Thankfully, everyone is back and and going full force. Mr. Kravitz (George Tobias) is still the ultimate neighbor who still thinks his wife is on drugs for the things she sees across the street. His lines are are hilarious as they were back in the days.

 Endora ""Agnes Moorehead"" and Darrin ""Dick York"" go at it full force in season 3 and are funnier than ever together. Talk about battling it out full force.  Endora still refers to Darrin as being ""Dumbo, Dagwood, Dumpy, Darwin and Dopey"" and brings a laugh to me everytime when she never remembers her name. The storylines are still fresh and not one of them is recycled from past seasons. This might be one of my favorite seasons, I'll have to wait for Season 4 until I can be sure.

 Tabithia plays a pretty crucial role this season as she is coming to her own as becoming a full fledged toddler with witchly powers of her own. She's as adorable as she was in the 60's and you can't help to smile everytime she is on-screen. Just a quick factoid, Diane Murphy and Erin Murphy both played the role as Tabitha to give each other breaks from shoots. Can you tell them apart??

Bernard Fox is also introduced this year as Dr. Bombay and is is a fine addition to the Bewitched family. A little tidbit, Bernard Fox also played a role in James Cameron's blockbuster hit movie Titanic. He was Col. Archibald Gracie who always wanted to go into the smoking room for a brandy with the rich boys.

David White, still playing the ultimate role as Darrin's boss still hasn't determined what's wrong with the Stevens and has yet to learn that Samantha is a full fledged cauldron stirring witch!

Dick York, still the best Darrin of them all, is going strong during all 33 episodes of season 3. Unbeknownst to many, Dick York suffered a severe back injury earlier in his life and struggled in pain during every shoot of Bewitched. You'll notice during some of the episodes, you'll catch him lying down on a couch while doing some of the shoots -- it was then the pain was contained. As each season progressed, the pain just worsened and eventually ended his carreer all together.  During the middle of Season 6, his carreer as Darrin came to an abrupt end.  ""Bill Asher comes to the hospital to see York and says, 'What do you want to do, Dick? Do you want to quit?' I said, 'If it's all right with you, Billy.' And Bill Asher and I hugged for the first time.""

Amazingly, through every episode of Bewitched, you would never notice the severe pain he went through making us all laugh. It's a sign of his spirit and love for acting and he simply wanted to make people laugh and remember what he does best. Rest in peace Dick, we'll always remember you.",1145059200,33,3492,4.497630331753554
2486771,5,B000E3L7FK,"Since so many people are offering a synopsis of the episodes included in this volume, I won't repeat it. These are just my humble observations.

This season of ""Bewitched"" - the first in color- is really when all the spark plugs were firing and it ran like a well-oiled machine.  It is the first season to offer major cast changes (Sandra Gould as the new ""Gladys Kravitz"" and Kasey Rogers as the new  ""Louise Tate""). Also making more regular appearances is the dear and endearing Marion Lorne as Aunt Clara, and practical joking Uncle Arthur, brother to Endora, played by the immortal Paul Lynde.  Also coming to the forefront is little Tabitha (twins Erin and Diane Murphy) and her emerging powers.  What a cute little witchlet she is!

This is a great addition to any family viewing library. While the themes may at first seem light and fun, the greater lessons in this series are acceptance of diversity and the ability to love someone just as they are.

Freudian? Maybe.

Of course, you could just watch the episode were Norman Fell plays him and see for yourself.

2486772,5,B000E3L7FK,"The five stars are for the series itself.  Extras would get 1 star from me.  Although I seldom watched the show in its original run because I was too young to stay up that late back then, I became a die hard fan in reruns.  The dvd qualities vary from okay to excellent.  Some episodes have a few sound flaws probably due to age.  If you listen to the background music to the ""Short Happy Circuit of Aunt Clara"", you'll see what I mean.  I particularly love this season because of it's emphasis on Tabitha turning the house upside down with her powers, and the 3rd season also had more episodes that feature Aunt Clara than any of the others.  (the show just wasn't the same after her passing)  Sandra Gould actually added some much needed tension to the series, and Kasey Rogers had us saying ""Irene who?"".

I personally will not rest until the entire series is on DVD!!!",1144281600,10,872,4.4
2486773,3,B000E3L7FK,"Like most shows of the '60s, ""Bewitched"" suffered a creative decline when it switched to colour.  In this case, the likely source of the decline was a change in writers.  The success of season 1 owed a lot to the producer and head writer, Danny Arnold (""Barney Miller""). Arnold left after season 1, but season 2 was capably handled by two of the other season 1 writers, Jerry Davis and Bernard Slade.  But in the third season, all the original writers and producers were gone.

You can see the difference throughout almost the entire season.  Danny Arnold's ""Bewitched"" was basically a domestic romantic comedy with fantasy elements: the magic was a way of creating complications, but the important conflicts were never about magic, they were about relationships, work, parenthood.  Season 3 moves toward a less adult, more kid-oriented kind of storytelling where magical complications are at the centre of every story.  Most of the stories now involve some magical prank played by Endora or one of Samantha's other relatives, or historical figures being transported to the present day, leaving Samantha almost as a passive bystander on her own show.  Endora, once a complex character with genuine concern for her daughter, has become a cartoonish antagonist.

You can spot the decline of the show in this season's Halloween episode.  The first two seasons had both stuck to the idea that Samantha and Endora hated Halloween for its stereotyping of witches (an obvious parallel with racial issues of the time).  This season, the witches actually throw a Halloween party and wacky hijinks ensue. There's one great episode, ""Charlie Harper, Winner,"" that recaptures the style and tone of the first season, with magic once again becoming a metaphor for the things that can help or hurt a relationship.  But otherwise, it's mostly standard fantasy stuff, albeit with good performances.

There were other problems that the show couldn't help: the death of Alice Pearce, the original Gladys Kravitz, created a permanent hole in the show (the actress who takes over the part in season 3, Sandra Gould, was almost as disappointing a replacement as Dick Sargent).  And the original Louise Tate, Irene Vernon, left the show after season 2. The change to colour photography meant uglier, less flattering lighting, as it did with most '60s shows.

I would recommmend this season for the ""Charlie Harper"" episode (which really does measure up to the best of the Danny Arnold shows), the return of Paul Lynde, the other good performances, and the general nostalgia value.  But the essential ""Bewitched,"" as with so many other '60s shows, is in the black-and-white years.",1144195200,31,2656,5.071264367816092
2486774,2,B000E3L7FK,"Folks if you want a sloppy job of a remastered transfer, then these collections are for you! Sony pictures once again has proven poor quality when it comes to the editing of the film. Sony has always been known to nick the fade ins and outs (this started before they purchased Screen Gems/Columbia Tri-Star) with a prime example being episode #104 ""Noboby But A Frog Knows How to Live""--this time, unlike the vhs release in the late '90's from Columbia Tri-Star, they did not nick the fade into the 1st scene, but they did add an extra fade out and fade in near the end like it was extra commerical spot. Many episodes fade out to the commerical blanks before the film has finished--""Charlie Harper"", among quite a few others!
Also if you select a differing language, it may not be nicked.
Of course they left out the ""Bewitched in Color"" tags and the Screen Gem's production symbol and correct arrangement of the theme music for each season, which they do have the versions that do not have sponsor announcements, but is the correct arrangement of the opening theme. I must say, even though the sound quality also leaves a lot to be desired, the picture quality is excellent. I know many people say who cares about these little picky things, someone must care or they would have never taken the time to release series in the first place. However, I will not be purchasing another Sony product again from DVD's to electronics, and as memory serves me right, Sony has been whining about their electronic sales. Perphaps we now know the reason. Why pay for a product that is defected in my opinion and then put money back in their pockets for a TV?! If they can't do it with care and do it right, then don't do it at all. Heads up ""I Dream of Jeannie"" is even worse!

Season 3 includes many of my favorite Bewitched episodes, and I have been having so much fun watching them all again.  These are truly the ""classic"" episodes.

However, I wonder if there are any other sharp-eyed fans out there who noticed an error on the DVD case?  Episode 4 on Disk One is called Accidental Twins (I absolutely love this episode!).  The description on the case reads, ""While trying to entertain Timothy Tate, Aunt Clara accidentally turns him into twins, a spell she can't remember how to undo.""  As any hard-core Bewitched fan knows, Larry and Louise Tate's son is named Jonathan, not Timothy.  Did anyone else notice that?

Samantha and Darrin are in animated form like in the show's opening theme, which is just darling(which reminds me of when they did a guest appperance on the Flinstones!) and when you select an episode  a big color cloud appears before going to the menu! I hope Sony continues this format for future seasons because it's just so cute!!!

8105283,5,B000E3L7FK,"This is retro television at it's very best. Darren and Samantha have a ""mixed marriage"" because she is a witch, and he is a mortal. Obviously a good witch, because she is quite pleasing to the eye. Darren works in advertising in Manhattan and they live in the suburbs, although the weather is strangely like that of Southern California, except on Christmas Day, when it snows.

Due to Darren's wishes, they are trying to live a ""normal life"", without supernatural help or interference, but it never works out that way, due to various glitches and Samantha's meddling relatives.

What makes this show work so well is the casting. Elizabeth Montgomery was perfect in this role. She has been described as a sunny, optimistic blonde, always cheerful in spite of trouble, as she uses her wits, and occasionally witchcraft, to solve problems. She was also a woman deeply in love with her husband as Samantha, and also in real life, with producer William Asher.

The show is a cornucopia of 1960's trivia and culture, which makes it so fun to watch. Everything from the clothes, to the interior decorating, to the menus and drinks. We see Sam and Darren having coffee after dinner, looking at the paper, trying to decide on a movie at the local cinema. This was in the days before HBO and Netflix!

Season Three was probably about the peak of the creative quality of the program. There are a couple of clunkers in this season, but most of these shows are very good. I especially loved seeing the ""Benjamin Franklin"" episodes, after Aunt Clara accidentally conjures him.  Ben has a scrape with the law, and there is a court hearing with a judge who becomes convinced the man truly is Benjamin Franklin. The hearing reminds me of Miracle on 34th Street.

It is interesting to see the show begin to reflect the rapid changes in society that were occurring during the decade. The show is now in color, and it definitely has a more modern edge. But Samantha still wears white gloves for certain occasions.

Bewitched was by far the best of the supernatural family comedies that were popular in the 60's. The quality and variety of the scripts was excellent, especially in the first few seasons.  There were also some deeper themes involved that Ms Montgomery would regularly express. Themes of love, perseverance, diversity and sacrifice. I watched it as a child in the 60's, and those values had an enduring effect on me.

The quality of the show eventually declined, and the Ashers divorced. We are ephemeral, and not supernatural beings after all. Even so, each Bewitched episode is a little slice of life of a happier and more innocent time.",1507334400,2,2633,4.756578947368421
