7969543,5,B00006IUGD,"Three Great movies and one really good one.

House on the Edge of the Park with David A. Hess- very graphic and may offend many, but one of my all time favorites.  The ending of this film is very good.

Messiah of Evil-I reviewed this movie before, it alone is worth the price of this DVD 4 pak.

Deep Red the Hatchet Murders by Dario Argento-Need I say more this Dario Argento classic is also worth the price of the DVD.

Christmas Evil-Very funny one of my wifes Favorites.",1135555200,,475,4.292134831460674
