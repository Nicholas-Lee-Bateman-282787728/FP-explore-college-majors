YUNDI Li plays piano with a lot of feeling and musicality. Worth watching!",1383696000,,118,4.666666666666667
7964184,5,B000068GO1,Great DVD!  I definitely recommend it to people.  Yundi Li plays the piano with a lot of feeling and musicality.  Worth watching!,1368403200,,129,4.7727272727272725
7964185,4,B000068GO1,"Although I enjoyed Yundi Li's other piano DVD more -- Yundi Li: Live in Concert [2004] -- I enjoyed this DVD as well.  It was wonderful to compare the two DVDs to see how much Li has grown as a pianist since his 2000 competition performance. However, I do feel the current cost of the DVD is too much for what one gets.  I paid $49.00 plus $4 shipping for a used DVD, and that was actually the cheapest price on the market at the time I ordered.  If you are a true lover of piano, you will enjoy this DVD.  If you only wish to get a sampling of Yundi Li's pianism, I think you would get a more extensive introduction to Li's pianism via the more cheaply priced ""Yundi Li: Live in Concert"" DVD, which happens to contain one movement of the Concerto he performed at the Chopin International Competition in Warsaw, as well as other piano bonuses.  A great deal! If, on the other hand, you're unconcerned about money, go ahead and order this DVD. It's still cheaper than a night at the Met, and you will have an enjoyable experience of an evolving young pianist of great talent and potential.",1133222400,8,1088,4.313725490196078
7964186,5,B000068GO1,"For those who have already discovered the wonderful pianism of Yundi Li, this DVD will deliver the same passionate and dynamic playing in three performances
recorded ""live"" in Warsaw during the Chopin International Competition in 2000. The quality of the camera work is excellent, the audio bright and ""present"", providing the viewer an experience in viewing and listening that is often breathtaking. The reaction of the audience members following the performance of Chopin's E Minor Concerto, as well as, that of the panel of judges adds even more interest to this excellent musical documentary of a special young artist  and the youngest ever to win the Chopin competition.
If you love music and if you love the music of Chopin, buy this DVD.",1075680000,17,744,5.048780487804878
7964187,5,B000068GO1,"This DVD is excellent! The Best thing about this DVD is that it has TWO video angles (a multi-angle DVD). The first view point is a standard, edited, concert video view, and the second one, which I like the most, is from the camera putted beside the piano keyboard, unedited, and, yes, you can see Yundi Li&iexcl;s finger movement from the beginning to the end, even for the whole concerto. That means you have total of 142 minutes video on this DVD, if you count the two angles separately. Your family can enjoy a good Chopin piano concert with angle one, while you can study Yundi&iexcl;s finger movement with angle two; all on the same DVD.
The only let down is this DVD only has three songs from Chopin, but this is definitely one of the best Chopin Piano Concerto No. 1 videos available on the market today. This video might not be digitally recorded, since I noticed there are a few particles and the video is not as sharp as those digitally recorded videos, but that does not affect the quality of the film as a whole. There is also a typo on the instruction sheet of this DVD; this is a double-layered DVD, not double sided.
There is nearly nothing you can complain about the music since Yundi Li is the first prize winner. At least, you can sense that the judges&iexcl; taste in Chopin competition is very different from Tchaikovsky competition (BTW, you can see Martha Argerich sitting in the judge panel in this DVD). If Argerich is like a fire on the keyboard, then Li is like water. Yundi Li&iexcl;s music is light, like walking in the clouds. I don&iexcl;t know why, but Yundi Li reminds me of Milhail Pletnev.
This DVD is pretty expensive, since DVDs in Japan are at this price level, but this DVD is worth the price. I am looking forward to see Maxell publishing more DVD of other winners from the same competition.",1045180800,30,1831,4.518072289156627
7964188,5,B000068GO1,"This DVD contains selected Yundi Li's performance (scherzo no. 2, andante spianato et grand polonaise and piano concerto no. 1) in the 2000 Warsaw Chopin piano competition. Yundi Li, the first winner awarded in 15 years, delivers a very poetic and refreshing Chopin from his music. The live recording CD of Yundi Li (also in Maxell label) captures the rare talent of a then 18 years old Chinese pianist in the competition but this DVD provides sight and sound of all the thrill and excitement. Video quality is really good and multi angle viewing is available with this DVD.
Price of this DVD is high as it is imported from Japan but you won't be disappointed at its sense of occasion that captures well the spontaneity and excitement one has come to expect from the best of live performances. A collectible item indeed.",1025568000,40,820,4.741258741258742
