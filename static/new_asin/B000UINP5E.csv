8213348,4,B000UINP5E,"I love Patti Smith. This documentary focuses on here first 4 lps on Arista. ""Horses"", Radio Ethiopia"", ""Easter"" and ""Wave"". They do a very short few minutes on her latter CDs but not as indepth as the first four that defined Patti to the masses.

I gave this 4 stars out of five only due to the fact that after reading the back cover synopsis you can't tell if there are full performances or just clips. It just says includes performances of...

The performances they show are so short and some the audio does nto match the video. They even say there are performances of Patti in the recording studio which I must have missed???

Other than that fact this documentary is done very well. I was only dissapointed in that it wasn't clear on if these included the performances it raves about  .But all in all it was very well done. Made me want to pull out all my Patti Cds and blast them. LOUD!

I wish that some day full, whole live performances will be released on DVD.

If you love Patti Smith this is a nice addition to your collection but if your looking for anything but background stories on punk and Patti Smith you can skip this and keep your $20.",1225756800,24,1153,4.339534883720931
