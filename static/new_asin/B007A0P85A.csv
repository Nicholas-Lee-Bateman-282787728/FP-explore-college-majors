I hope this will be enough to give some indication of its quality.
Because of treaty obligations and political sympathies, Australia (and New Zealand) joined the USA in its involvement with the war between South and North Vietnam.
At the time, and increasingly as the war continued, this was an extremely controversial involvement, in Australia, in the same way that there was a strong anti-war protest movement in the USA.
To provide troops for the conflict, Australia introduced conscription, by ballot.
The mini-series shows some of this as it follows the recruitment, and training of officers and men, in Australia, before they are shipped to Vietnam.
Once the men who are the central characters in the series arrive in Vietnam, they find themselves engaging with the harsh tropical climate, the enemy, and with the local civilians.
Combat in Vietnam was rather different for Australian troops, compared with the experience of American troops. Vigorous, stealthy patrolling attempted to suppress infiltrating Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army forces, while protecting local villagers.
The mini-series pulls no punches in showing the dangers, and hardships endured by the Australian troops.
The last parts of the series shows the aftermath for the survivors, after they return to Australia -- villified by anti-war protesters, and haunted by their traumatic combat experiences.
The final healing occurs when the central character returns to Vietnam, years later, to make his own peace with the people.
Andrew Clarke was outstanding as the young, traumatised officer.
Other actors were similarly superb.
This is a war story with a conscience, a heart, and a brutal honesty that should be better known, and appreciated alongside the more famous American films.
The other Australian film ""The Odd Angry Shot"" should also be noted as a fine account of Australian Special Forces (SAS, commandos) in Vietnam.
