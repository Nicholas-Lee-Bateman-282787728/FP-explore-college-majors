2300430,5,B0009MAPN6,"This set is a truly great must own DVD for any Phillies fan who wants to relive the unforgettable 1980 season. The two documentaries in the DVD are very good ones. One is the classic MLB Documentary of the 1980 world series and the other is a wonderful Phillies documentary which looks into that entire year in detail. Having Game 5 of the NLCS and Game Six of the World Series is awesome as both are exiting games with many memorable moments.

The 1980 Phillies team was called the Team that would not die and the same can be said about this DVD. You'll keep watching it over and over again as it is that good.",1120780800,5,611,4.267241379310345
2300431,5,B0009MAPN6,"any real baseball fan for that matter. 1980 was one of the truly magical seasons in baseball lore and no team exemplified the ""Never Say Die"" attitude like the 'Phightin' Phils"". Schmidty, The Bull, Charlie Hustle, Shake and Bake, Gary Lee, Bowa, Trillo, Boone, Lefty and The Tugger -- talk about a talented cast of characters. And that's exactly what they were -- Characters. The team had plenty of personality and exuded the kind of confidence that makes ordinary teams special. Dallas Green was the perfect manager for this bunch and their accomplishments on the field made a city full of frustrated diehards chomping at the bit for a winner stand up and respond with one voice -- WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS!!!

With regard to the DVD itself, the two documentaries are nearly worth the asking price alone, but to have the added bonus of Game 5 of the NLCS against Houston and Game Six of the World Series against Kansas City -- in their entirety -- well you couldn't ask for anything more.

The '80 Phillies made my 6th grade year one of the most memorable of my childhood and it's about time that remarkable team be immortalized like this. Thank you ""Video"" Dan Stephenson and the Phillies for making this loyal fan very happy.

Go Phils!!!",1118534400,15,1238,4.669724770642202

8063182,5,B0009MAPN6,I enjoyed seeing classic baseball and seeing the all time best in their prime.,1405209600,,78,4.642857142857143
8063183,3,B0009MAPN6,There was some very good highlights but every world series game should of been high lighted especially game 4 when dickie noles brushed back george brett and caused a big controversy.  That might of been the turning point of that series.,1346803200,,237,4.780487804878049
8063184,4,B0009MAPN6,"I stumbled upon this set a few years ago and picked it up, being a sucker for old MLB games on DVD.  The NLCS game is the Phillies' local over-the-air telecast.  The video quality is scattershot.  Some moments are awful (it was admitted during the broadcast they were having technical difficulties) and at certain points they have to pick up the ABC broadcast.  That said, it's nice having a local flavor.  The NBC telecast is used for the World Series (video is fine, audio is alright).

The other portions are also very good.  The 1980 season-in-review is great, narrated by the incomparable John Facenda.  Also a 20-year reunion at the Vet is featured.  Finally, a ""Farewell Vet"" with Phillies employees is nice.  The (presumed) boss discusses the stadium and the then-recent passings of Paul ""The Pope"" Owens and Tug McGraw.

Overall a must-get for Phillies fans and for the right price, worth it for other baseball fans.",1342828800,,925,4.828025477707007
8063185,4,B0009MAPN6,"Saw this boxed set on Amazon and thought I would give it a try because the price was right at the time.  If you're a dyed-in-the-wool ""die-hard"" Phillies fan, this DVD set might not be the greatest for you.  But if you're someone who follows baseball in a very ""general"" sort of way (and especially were a fan of the 70's & 80's), it is worth the purchase.  I was 17 when this season took place for the Phils, and even though I grew up in Detroit and was an American League fan by heart, the makeup of this team and the grit and heart they showed throughout the NLCS and World Series had me pulling for them the entire way; and is the reason I say that this DVD set is worth the price.  There are (3) discs in the set.  The first one chronicles the Phillies season in VERY general terms.  Very few games are discussed, and nothing in great detail.  It is a ~ 25 minute segment narrated by none other than John Facenda of NFL Films fame (GREAT VOICE!!).  There is also a set of ""extras"" which are short snippets and segments of events or players that are recalled by the team (such as one small segment on Tug McGraw that year).  The next DVD is the Game 5 NLCS contest vs. the Astros.  It is a bit disappointing in the sense that the game rebroadcast is from a local Philadelphia station vs. that of ABC (or NBC . .not sure which one had the rights that year), but it does have Richie Ashburn and Harry Kalas doing the commentary, and I did find it quite amusing at times to see who would win the ""$500 jackpot"" every inning the Phils were up to bat.  But the game is a classic in every sense of the word, and if you're a fan of baseball as a whole, this is one to keep in your library.  Finally, the 3rd disc is of Game 6 of the 1980 World Series.  And while this game isn't as thrilling as the Game 5 NLCS disc, it is nonetheless an awesome addition to my baseball collection.  I will say that each and every time I watch these anymore, I gain a greater appreciation for players such as Bob Boone, Manny Trillo, Garry Maddox and Larry Bowa.  These were guys who just could flat out play, and it is nice to see them do it in a professional, subdued manner vs. the ""get me on the camera"" type mentality that is prevalent today. Also, after watching Steve Carlton pitch (not just on this DVD, but a number of other times on TV as well) this Game 6 against the Royals, it shows just how dominating this guy truly was, and makes you appreciate the level of talent and competitive fire he truly had.

Again, if you're ""old school"" such as myself who appreciates a gritty team such as the '80 Phils who had alot of class and character in gutting out a worlds championship, then this is a DVD set worth purchasing.",1338681600,2,2708,4.178846153846154
8063186,5,B0009MAPN6,"If you are a Philadelphia Phillies fan, then you have to have this in your collection.  It brings back memories of that time and loves watching it over and over.  Steve, Tug, Mike and all of the Phillies during that time were the best!!!",1329955200,,237,4.363636363636363
8063187,5,B0009MAPN6,Terrific Phillies DVD set.  Low price compared to other DVD sets and packaged very well.  Very pleased and would highly recommend.,1318377600,,130,5.142857142857143
8063188,3,B0009MAPN6,"I didn't have to buy this item having been able to experience it on loan and there is nothing wrong with it or the content itself but be aware that this is geared toward Phillie fans and not necessarily to those of baseball, or the 1980 World Series.  I would suggest checking out the library or rental shop (or bumming a look off a buddy who's a Philly Phanatic) for this and waiting until a package that includes all the games in full is released, although I am impressed that it includes 2 complete games (and not merely ALL highlights or team glorifying documentaries like most items of this type).  And yes, as stated in one of the reviews, you don't HAVE to be a Phillies rooter to enjoy this but it's PROBABLY not something anyone other than a Philadelphia fan wants to keep in their home collection.

I also think the baseball fan deserves to see this series treated as those in the World Series (Collectors Edition)s where the complete broadcast of each game is shown on seperate DVDs because this was really a terrific matchup and one of the better 6-game WSs (that anyone still alive could remember) featuring 3-one run games, 2-two run contests and the deciding 3-run showdown with ""Lefty"" Steve Carlton and intense closer Frank Edwin (Tug) McGraw benefiting from 2 KC Royal errors for the win and save respectively.

I have to believe the 80 WS will eventually be released as a WS(CE) and, having seen that an NLCS complete game was included in the Phillie 1980 Anniversary set, and in case producers/packagers DO read comments, etc. on Amazon, I'd like to see ""post-season packages"" become available as well, you know, include LCSs, or, nowadays, Division Championships and LCSs, with the WS games.  Then I'll wait for the 83 WS to come out; not so joyous for ""Cincinnati East"" but entertaining for baseball and World Series fans!",1314748800,,1844,4.696594427244582
8063189,5,B0009MAPN6,"I think these DVDs are great in reviving those memories of Phillies of late '70s, early '80s, led by Mike Schmidt. Although both highlight videos of season is sort of the same, and doesn't include much highlights, mostly talking/comments of former Phillies people. I would like to have seen videos of player profiles included, because I know there's a video called Lefty about Steve Carlton, I have it on VHS, so I wished something like that would get us to know the players better be included. The complete games replays are great and include locker room celebration. Overall, must have for Phillies fans, even if you weren't old enough in 1980 to remember.",1293148800,2,658,4.831858407079646
8063190,5,B0009MAPN6,"This is a definite must for any Phillies fan.

There are quite a few video errors in the first half of the video from the NLCS...does everyone else have this problem too?",1239753600,,170,4.3125
