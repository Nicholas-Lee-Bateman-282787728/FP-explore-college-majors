2629121,5,B000H6SY32,"Wow, to speak the truth about being vulnerable while being misunderstood and having misunderstandings, Dave Chappelle brings the flipside of what we did not know. His candor is very refreshing, and while I have this DVD, I regularly watch this also on my iPod Touch. The dvd has a few extras that didn't make the cut, but his experience, while he is a celebrity, still hits home. You will enjoy this.",1291334400,,400,4.647887323943662
2629122,5,B000H6SY32,"The man behind Dave Chappe-pelle. I have all the ""Dave Chappelle Show"" DVDs and yet I think that this 1-hour interview for Actor's Studio is almost as funny and touching sometimes.

What George Carlin was to English language, Dave is to racial relations. An acute observer with a genious for humour. Better watch before he comes back to Africa, folks.",1273363200,2,351,4.85

2629144,5,B000H6SY32,"Enjoy this man while we still have him on this earth. Enjoyed this piece because he does give glimpses without going into too much detail about how the industry really works. Respect this man for not selling out and being another pawn/puppet...we have enough of them already.  $50 million is hard to turn down.
