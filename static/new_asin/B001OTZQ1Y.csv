8331505,1,B001OTZQ1Y,"This whole DVD, between its main ""movie"" and additional pieces is about 15 minutes. The extra pieces are too short to be educational or informative, to anybody. It seems to be more about acting than actual addiction. This video has no educational value for anybody, at all. This video is basically a young women in a low budget high school film repeating that Addiction is ""cunning, baffling, and powerful"" over and over while appearing in different places for a couple of minutes. I mistakenly used this without watching it myself first as material for facilitating a group on chemical dependency and it was embarrassing. This is no better than a youtube video, please save yourself the money.",1328745600,,694,4.94017094017094
8331506,5,B001OTZQ1Y,"This video captures your attention and holds your interest while teaching you important information about addiction.  I think young people will relate to the struggle of the main character, and by depicting abstract qualities as personified (by the same person, no less) the video really captures the nature of the internal struggles of addiction.  It gets the point across in a way that will be remembered because it is quite unique.  The video does a great job of teaching without ""preaching"", and by keeping the message short and simple, it is effective, as well.  This would be a great tool to use with youth and young adults, as well with as any population who needs to understand addiction as a chronic disease.  I love the idea of a script that can be used with students, because the activity of making a video centered around this topic lends itself to endless variations, and keeps participants engaged in the process of learning at many different levels.  The opportunity for students to examine the ways that these ""characters"" act in their own lives is a natural parallel activity that can be developed.  I love this concept and would like to see a whole series like this.",1278633600,,1184,4.802955665024631
8331507,5,B001OTZQ1Y,"This video is riveting to watch in the way it so graphically portrays the concept of addiction and how addiction can consume and destroy young lives, if it goes unchecked. What is especially powerful about this video is the second part where addiction is explained to adolescents, in very realistic and easy to understand terms, so that they can learn about the process and warning signs of addiction. Having worked with many young disaffected youth, who have gotten caught up with addiction to drugs and alcohol, this video would be so powerful in helping them to learn about addiction and its detrimental effects. Also extremely beneficial is the script that comes with the video, so that other youth, especially those who might be headed down the path toward addiction, can perform the video presentation and through this process acquire new knowledge and skills to change their pathway in moving toward addiction.

8331508,5,B001OTZQ1Y,"I found that this piece is a powerful message geared to the 10 to 16 year olds. It is done in such a way that they ""get it

8331509,1,B001OTZQ1Y,I was completly miss-led by the description and title. This dvd has no educational advantage and is complete waste of time and money.,1268956800,,133,4.826086956521739
8331510,5,B001OTZQ1Y,"This DVD production is a great personification of the words ""Cunning, Baffling, Powerful"" which anyone in an alcohol recovery support program is familiar with.  This ""personification"" gives a good visual picture of the thoughts, feelings and imaginings many addicted individuals experience.  It gives personality to addiction, and it's not a pretty personality.  As one member of our AA group said, ""it's strange to think that there is something inside me that wants to kill me"".  But, that's the nature of addiction.  Awareness, support, and living a 12-step program is a good and necessary approach for this chronic condition.

Not to mention, this is a very well done DVD.",1232236800,19,675,5.203703703703703

The utilization of a visual medium as an education tool lends itself to innumerable explorations.  One of these explorations presents itself in the DVD, Addiction: Cunning, Baffling and Powerful.  Taproot, Inc.'s founding members, Linda Flanders and, Dorothy Halla-Poe have upended the standard training module by using students as actors, allowing them to explore the everyday risks that youth encounter and face.  As educators, we constantly ask and probe, ""How do we instruct students to connect the abstract to the real?""  The answer may lie in such a film as, Addiction, which successfully constructs a concrete portrayal of the elusive term, addiction, and its dependent offspring: cunning, baffling, and powerful.  Addiction, defined as a dual character within the film, allows the viewer to witness the struggle of dependency in physical terms.

As educators, we must acknowledge that our children have grown within the digital age.  The alternative styles to an education are limitless and it is paramount to provide understanding through associative visual learning and active experience.  The members of Taproot, Inc. are laying the foundation for these opportunities and many others within the field of education.",1232236800,11,1312,5.653061224489796
