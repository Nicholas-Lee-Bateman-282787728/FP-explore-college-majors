7995749,5,B0000A2ZQ3,"I was born in Poland and spent there the first 33 years of my life, so my interaction with this movie may be biased and not quite typical to impressions received by a typical American person. Yet, I do not hesitate to recommend this movie to any viewer who is at least 16. Apart from being very entertaining, the story educates the viewer about the influence that any corrupted society has on its members. It reminds me of an excellent book ""The White Tiger"" by Aravind Adiga. In either case, we can see how a person manipulated by the society can become capable of doing almost anything. It is sad. At the same time, the movie has so many hilarious moments, and it is  psychologically speaking very true, to which I can attest exactly by having lived so many years in Poland.

All in all, I can recommend it both as entertainment and education.",1292025600,,845,4.48051948051948
7995750,5,B0000A2ZQ3,"Just fabulous!  5 stars!  This Polish gem is a must for those that enjoy intelligent humor, a wild and offbeat plot, excellent acting and dialogue...and a great story about rags to riches in the political arena.  This film has a good feel to it...uplifting...and devious.  It is dubbed in English, but that does not diminish the quality or continuity.  This was deemed the funniest film to come out of Poland in a decade.  I'll drink to that...vodka...chilled vodka that is.",1291161600,,474,4.8625
7995751,3,B0000A2ZQ3,"This is a light-hearted Polish political satire starring one of that country's most popular actors (and also a popular young actress).  A rags-to-powers story about a funeral home worker who finds his true calling as a populist politician, eventually being named Poland's prime minister.  Along the way, he becomes a bad guy by dumping his powerful senator girlfriend and caging up one of his old-time buddies from the cemetery, and finds true love in the ex-wife of his ex-ally in politics.

The movie starts off pretty funny but after the first 30 minutes becomes agonizingly predictable and boring.  There are the trophy young wives of the old politicians, diatribes against post-Communist corruption and racketeering, and, of course, the predictable rise to political stardom of Nikos.  Saving the day is some solid acting from the actors.  They just seem so genuine and likable, even though the film script itself isn't.

On balance, this is a decent comedy and does give us a glimpse into today's Polish society.",1109808000,,1018,5.096385542168675
