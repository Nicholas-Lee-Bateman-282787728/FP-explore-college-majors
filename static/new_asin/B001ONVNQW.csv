3731461,5,B001ONVNQW,"I bought this for my Mom last year for Mother's Day and she watches one every day. She loves it! She has no complaints about the quality, I had no complaints about the price. For the person with the beef of the postal service I would have taken the insurance and perhaps made the postal service buy me a new set. They are bumbling idiots. Viva la online bill pay and paperless!!!!",1304035200,2,380,4.291666666666667
3731462,5,B001ONVNQW,I remember watching Amos 'N Andy with my great-grandmother 45 years ago.  These dvd's bring back fond memories of watching tv with her.,1271548800,,135,4.869565217391305
3731463,1,B001ONVNQW,"I am watching this and love them, but the quality is very poor. Wished I had not spent my money on it.",1265846400,12,102,3.6818181818181817
3731464,5,B001ONVNQW,"I bought this item as a gift for my husband. He had wanted to buy the Amos 'N Andy Collection but wasn't sure if the video would be the real thing. I took a chance and purchased it. It is the real deal. We do not remember any of the shows because of our ages but we remember the characters names and what the shows centered around. The videos we have watched are funny and enjoyable. When I was a child, we only had one television in the house. TV time was family time. Watching theses videos took me back to that time.
The video is much clearer than expected. The sound is not bad. Only one video we watched so far looked like it needed a fine tune adjustment but that is expected. They are old.",1262131200,16,696,4.087591240875913
3731465,5,B001ONVNQW,"The reception of this order was as always, great! The quality of the DVDs were in great condition, given the fact that
the age of the original film that they were transford from are great.

I highly recommend this DVD package.",1255392000,,226,4.512195121951219
3731466,1,B001ONVNQW,"Several episodes kept freezing up. Sound fades out on many episodes. Tried another DVD player - made no difference.
Worst of all was the Vendor's logo appearing on the screen several times during each episode. They are most likely bootleg copies so don't waste your money.",1247702400,45,272,4.934782608695652

8331011,5,B001ONVNQW,"This is a hilarious series with over 70 episodes and over 2100 minutes of viewing. These are some phenomenal actors. They've developed knee-slapping characters with humorous attributes.

As a child I used to watch these on TV and this series inspires nostalgia. Unfortunately, some liberal activists protested this series back in the 60s, but I feel the Amos 'n Andy Show was anything but racist. It was just pure humor and, would be so, regardless of the race of these actors. To call this show racist would be akin to calling Sanford and Son racist - it's simply not so, but the protestors had to find something to protest - this show was sacrificed and outstanding Black actors lost their jobs.

But apart from the politics of this show, I have to say that it ranks with the best series ever shown on TV. Also, despite the age of these films, due to digital remastering, they appear quite visually pleasant.

Will provide many hours of funny laughs and slapstick joke routines",1436659200,,129,4.416666666666667

8331018,5,B001ONVNQW,"I used to watch Amos and Andy when I was a child and young adult.  I absolutely love the plots and the interaction
of the characters.  I have been trying to find this on VHS or DVD for years.  I had one dealer tell me that is not
available because the NAACP placed a hold on it because they thought it was demeaning to African-American
people.  I disagree with them.  The episodes are very well written and hold the characters in a very positive vain.
It's a must for lovers of classic sitcoms.  Very strongly recommended!",1403913600,2,522,4.385416666666667
8331019,5,B001ONVNQW,"Love the series. The DVD case had broken prongs and some of the dvds were ""floating"" in the case, but the packaging was good overall. Thank you!",1384041600,,144,4.37037037037037
8331020,5,B001ONVNQW,"I luv this show!!! Brillant comedy!!  I so luv Tim Moore, who plays the ""Kingfish."" He makes the show great!!! His language, his facial expression, his comedic style is classic!!! Yes, I see how other Black people say that it's a stereotype and disappointing to our race, but it's no worse than the talk shows that make us look even worse.  I'd watch this before any of the stuff out now.  I'm actually at work watching it right now!! I never get tired of this.  Would be a great addition to DVD collecton.",1379462400,3,506,4.408602150537634
