5092111,2,B007K7IBJI,I got a similar tape of trucks made by a different company. That immediately became my kids' favorite tape. That made me think this would be similar with more variety. NOPE! The person who made this was a cheesy and foolish as possible. It is painful to have on the TV. The kids and he are reading scripts that sound like a 4th grader wrote. NOT the tape you are looking for. look elsewhere!,1358812800,,391,4.297297297297297

Have to keep them out of reach and now lock up the player to keep him from watching tv without permission!

5092138,3,B007K7IBJI,"Since it has a mix of different shows it was hard to judge. There is a guy who 's show is called ""Hard Hat Harry""... we are just not a fan. Also even though it seems to be written late 80's early 90's for a kids show it does not seem appropriate for the main guy Harry... to be shirtless and sharing with those watching how planes work. Just awkward and unnecessary. We mainly bought it for the planes but luckily the guys who wrote the 'trains' one are guys we liked. So it was a toss up because we thought it was a compilation of a certain tv group but then was bummed when others made it on the DVD. anyways.. so it's OK because of the shows we like but not AWESOME because we just don't find Hard Hat Harry appropriate or interesting. Thanks!",1455753600,,746,4.116438356164384

5092160,3,B007K7IBJI,"This is a series of educational videos geared towards little kids, kind of like what you'd expect to see on PBS on Saturday mornings.  While my kids enjoyed watching them, they really didn't have a lot of interest in seeing them again.  They are very basic videos, and there really isn't much to learn by watching them repeatedly.  However, if you have a kid who is a train buff, truck buff, or whatever, they do tend to show several examples of everything they spotlight.  My kids probably would have liked them better at a younger age, but it seems pretty basic, even for 2-4th graders.
Considering the price I paid, I'd say I got my money's worth, but there are better videos like this out there.
One thing I might add, is that these videos are 'safe' for kids of any age, there is nothing in them I saw that would offend anyone.  From the narration to the images, there is nothing even remotely 'bad'.",1424908800,5,905,4.460606060606061

There's too much talking and stupid comments made on the other ones. It lost his attention because there were more characters trying too hard instead of seeing these types of transportation in action.

However, they are a bit dated, and these aren't documentaries or simply footage, they feature actors, and it was shot before good old HD changed the world as we know it.
The car episode, for example, is mostly about a garage. The special effect are dated, as well.
The real test is how well it is received by a child, however, and it held the attention of my son for a few minutes per episode, mostly when there's action footage rather than scripted dialogue.

8518672,4,B007K7IBJI,Would have given it 5 stars because my kids love it but the dvd doesn't have a play all option so I have to play each individual chapter. This is a problem because the only place we have a dvd is in the car and when I am driving I have to pull over to go the next chapter. Besides that little hiccup my kids love it.,1477440000,,316,3.7313432835820897

8518674,4,B007K7IBJI,At first my son refused to watch anything but Airplane part but he is slowly warning up to others as well. For $5 you get 9 short films that entertain mostly male audience from  ages 3 to 7 for sure.,1463184000,,199,3.975
