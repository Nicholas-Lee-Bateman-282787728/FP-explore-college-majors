4157288,5,B003NE8B6K,"The Wallflower is one of my favorite anime series. It took me a few episodes to really get into it, but once I did I didn't want to stop watching. Hannah Alcorn is wonderful in the English dub as Sunako. Her unique voice is what I hear whenever I think of the Wallflower.
This series is outrageous and over the top in its humor, and there are an unbelievable amount of nosebleeds, but there are some genuinely sweet moments as well, and hints of a romance that you can't help but cheer for.
Give the Wallflower a chance and you won't be disappointed.",1302048000,2,550,4.349514563106796
4157289,5,B003NE8B6K,"This is a great anime for people that like drama, random humor, and a little bit of romance.  This show is slightly reminiscent of Oran Host Club but is a lot weirder lol.  The characters in Oran are normal but have past issues that make them a bit quirky, however you always have Haruhi as your sane, grounded character.  The Wallflower is about 4 beautiful boys who all have issues because of their looks and the main girl character is far from grounded.  She is a lover of darkness and goor and can't stand to be in the light of beautiful people.  Her Aunt wants the 4 boys to turn her into a beautiful lady and thus drama and comedy in sue.  I would suggest this anime for people that liked Oran Host Club for the same ""family bonding"" experience but would say don't get it if you want more of an earth bound, normal approach to that bonding.
 For people that have never seen Oran Host Club, this show is basically about a girl that had someone call her ugly and now is determined to not care about her appearance to the point where she cannot be in the presents of beautiful people without collapsing and getting a nose bleed.  As time goes on in the show, the 4 boys and a few other characters find they may even like Sanako (the ""Ugly Girl"") better the way she is.  The 4 boys and the 1 girl have to coexist in a mansion and eventually form a family like bond.  This is a very funny story with a little romance, some drama and a few really kick butt fights.",1301875200,,1464,4.21505376344086

I really enjoyed it- funny,sometimes very touching and really bringing something new to the anime stories out there(attention:spoiler-the nose bleeds really cracked me up every time they happened).""The Wallflower"" has some elements that you don't see very often ,pretty cool and original story. So give it a try,you have nothing to loose!",1292889600,,513,5.047058823529412

4157293,5,B003NE8B6K,"Four boys must turn a girl into a refined lady, except that she believes that she's ugly -- and I mean gargoyle ugly. Oh, and their rent is on the line. Yeah, ""Wallflower: The Complete Collection"" sounds kind of generic at first. But while it takes a little while to get used to the characters, this hilarious, surreal anime takes off like a nosebleeding rocket after the first few episodes.

Four staggeringly beautiful teenage boys -- bookish Takanaga, childlike Yuki, brash Kyohei and flirtatious Ranmaru -- are living in a luxurious mansion. One day their landlady offers them a deal: if they can turn her niece Sunako into a refined lady, their living expenses will be completely free. Of course, they accept.

Then they actually MEET Sunako. She has bad hair/skin/clothes/social skills, and spends all her time alone in a dark bedroom, watching horror movies and talking to her biology models. And she's convinced that she'll melt if she sees the ""creatures of light,"" aka the boys.

But with their living expenses on the line, the boys valiantly try to turn Sunako into the perfect lady. Instead, they end up enmeshed with illegal clubs, haunted houses, arrogant photographers, Halloween, nabe and a kotatsu, math tutoring, magic mushrooms, pirate ghosts, a day at a spa for the girls, Sunako's eccentric parents, a Satanic shopkeeper cult, a thuggish suitor, and a trip to the hot springs where Sunako and the boys are faced with a gruesome murder...

The Pygmalion-esque plot of ""The Wallflower"" is something that's been done thousands of times before. But this anime spices up its story by being hilarious, frenetic and sometimes insane -- there's a squad of insane ""goth loli sisters"" (who sprout wheels when needed), ""Road To Womanhood"" tutorials, and the EPIC ELEMENTAL PING-PONG GAME OF DEATH!

The first couple episodes are a little rough, and at first the characters are kind of flat. But then the writers settle into a comfortable rhythm -- the dialogue is weird (""Stupid Adam! Stupid Eve! Stupid DNA! Stupid Pithecanthropus!""), there are a lot of funny pokes at anime conventions (how many nosebleeds can Sunako have?!). Some of the episodes are introduced by ""Hiroshi,"" an anatomical model missing his internal organs. The one problem is that a few of the jokes don't really translate for American viewers -- who are those tanned girls with the sharp nails?

And the characters start out a little two-dimensional (Bookworm, Flirt, Jerk, Doom'n'gloom Girl) but are gradually fleshed out over time -- Kyohei seems like a jerk at first, but has a good heart underneath it all; Takanaga is mature in all ways but romance; Ranmaru is flirty but rather naive; and Yuki is adorably childlike. And Sunako seems very weird and antisocial at first, but she turns out to be nice if sinister. And, of course, she can kick butt.

Small note on the English voice actors: at first I didn't think they fit the characters, especially Josh Grelle as Kyohei and Vic Mignogna as Takanaga. But after a few episodes the actors settle nicely into their roles, especially Hannah Alcorn and her scratchy, slightly wild voice.

""The Wallflower: Complete Collection"" sounds like yet another glorified makeover show, but instead it's a hilarious, unabashedly weird little anime. Hiroshi here...",1282953600,28,3285,5.014678899082568
4157294,5,B003NE8B6K,"The Wallflower is a great series, four pretty boys put to the task of turning their landladies niece  into a lady or pay triple the rent. Sounds easy enough ,right? Wrong! Think Ouran High School Host Club meets The Addams Family and the girl from The Grudge. The guy that ' tamed the shrew' had an easier job.
  Sunako shuns everything 'light' and ladylike after being insulted in the opening scene. She prefers to spend her time locked in her room watching gore films with her anatomical dummy friends and eating junk food .
  This show is hilarious with episodes ranging from the obligatory school cultural and sports festivals , to trips to a spa , to kidnappings and a gruesome murder.
 I agree with the other reviewer in that the earlier episodes are a little better than the later ones but they are still very entertaining and keep you hooked. The only gripe I have is with the last episode , it almost felt rushed and to me was the weakest of the series.
  If you want a good reverse harem comedy , that I personally liked more than Ouran , then you should check out The Wallflower.",1281657600,6,1090,4.442211055276382
4157295,5,B003NE8B6K,"I picked this series up from the library based on a hilarious trailer I saw of it. I was not disappointed! The first disc was so great, I called up some friends to come watch it again with me. They loved it too, it had everyone in the room in crying tears of laughter. It is incredibly wacky and pokes fun at bishonen otaku. One of my friends, a guy, went right out and bought the first set (first half was all that was available at the time) and put the second set on pre-order.

Basic premise: four incredibly good looking guys living in a gigantic beautiful mansion, agree to turn the owner's niece into a ""lady"" in order to get free rent. If they fail, their rent increases. Little do they know that Sunako is reclusive, gloomy, and obsessed with horror movies and gore. Fortunately, underneath the creepy demeanor, Sunako is a nice person who can show unexpected strength of character. Too bad that isn't enough to make her the glamorous lady they need to win free housing!

Sunako is actually a really fun character, her horror fetish both hilarious and creepy (in a funny way). The guys characters are a bit stereotypical, but that is what makes it great! The first half of the series is much more fun than the second half, as the story begins to take itself more seriously and focus on darker themes in the last half. But it is still funny and the characters remain as wacky as ever.

I watched this series in Japanese and the cast did an awesome job, especially Sunako. The art is very pretty and the animation fluid, with some very detailed background scenes.

I still love the anime, its just as absurd and over the top as the manga is. This is not for people who like serious things, this is supposed to be over dramatic, crazy, and funny. Its just for entertainment, which it does well.",1393200000,3,389,4.342465753424658

All the Charcters are totally loveable and I really don't have a bad thing to say about it. Shipping was very quick. I literally got it two days after I ordered it and got it well before the projected day I was suppose to get it. The packaging was surprisingly decent I figured for such a good price they probably cheaped out on it but they didn't. When I opened it all the discs were still securely in place and I really couldn't he happier with this product!,1393027200,5,612,4.151260504201681

Throughout the series beauty is talked about a lot how it is accepted in society. I really liked the transformations of everyone in this series and how they learn to love themselves for who they are not for they want to be.

The only reason I am not giving it five stars is the animation style was not much to my liking. I was hoping it would grow on me but sadly it did not.

4157427,5,B003NE8B6K,definitely worth watching and capable of being enjoyed by everyone. This one is pretty unique. Sunako Nakahara is a character you can't help but love with all your heart. Same with the 4 lovely boys. You just can't get enough of them. This anime had me laughing for days straight. I could easily place this one in my top 5 choices. And I know for sure I'll be re-watching it in the near future. I hope everyone else enjoys it as much as I did.,1316649600,2,443,4.223529411764706
4157428,2,B003NE8B6K,"Basically, Pokemon silliness filled with sexual innuendo to the point of being obnoxious.  It gave me a good laugh at points.  If I had seen it first I wouldn't have bought it.  It could have been worse (but it was pretty bad). The basic story line was good.",1312588800,,258,4.333333333333333

It was very quirky and cute and now and then caught me by surprise and had me laughing so hard I had to back up the player because I'd missed the next scene.",1304208000,2,343,3.9855072463768115
