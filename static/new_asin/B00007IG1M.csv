I had ordered this in a big order and I actually didn't get shipped. I just chatted with amazon online and they sent a new one the next day. They are always great like that.",1409184000,,381,4.148648648648648

1811429,5,B00007IG1M,"I missed this season on tv, I usually download my TV Drama's, as i don't usually watch through them as much as i do the funny shows. anyways, everywhere i looked, i couldn't find all the episodes for season 11.

The price is great, and i got really into this class of students, so i picked it up with ssn 10 and ssn 12.",1395705600,2,319,3.984375

1811472,4,B00007IG1M,"This season got a lot better, as I also got season 12, from Demple Records,here by my house. But unfortunately, like all teen shows, they seem to run out of steam. Now they are on Sea 14, wich may be the last. But I have Sea 1-12 right now.",1417651200,,240,3.9183673469387754

1811478,3,B00007IG1M,Watching it now. Only complaint is all 3 discs were stacked on top of each other in same case & I had to order a dvd case to store them in separate compartments.  That's why I gave less stars,1410134400,,191,3.8974358974358974

7976652,1,B00007IG1M,"I can remember a television ad for Degrassi where a homely girl gets giddy because a boy told her that she is ""so much more than the smart one.""
That ad tells you all you need to know about the series.  The ad campaigns are aimed at homely girls. Watch Degrassi and the guys will tell you exactly what you want to hear.  This is a feel-good show for pre-teen girls without a social life.  An instant social life inside your computer or your television.

What makes it worse is the emptiness of the stories.  After 10 seasons, the stories have become predictable.  Each episode begins with some lie that ends up being exposed.  You can almost set your watch by it.  It is apparent that the series is aimed at younger viewers that have not watched much television before and are susceptible to predictable plots.

Our culture has been addicted to television for decades.  But in recent years, the industry has set its sights on younger and younger audiences.  Today's children don't need a social life because one is provided for them on their electronic devices.  They provide a social life to the most vulnerable of the younger generation, those children don't try as hard to develop their own lives and the industry can peddle any idea it wants - men are women, up is down, day is night, etc.  There are long-term effects.  We become a society of Eloi, incapable of thinking for ourselves or even turning off the television.",1505779200,2,1425,4.603174603174603

7976654,3,B00007IG1M,"The packaging is a bit confusing: the discs don't have clear labelling, and although there are 4 discs in the set, they are not numbered. Looking for a specific episode? You have to search through each disc, and remember what order you place them in. This quibble aside, the set is worth having for collectors.",1438646400,2,310,4.654545454545454

7976656,5,B00007IG1M,I love Degrassi still as it's going onto it's 14th or 15th season. I think season 11 has been one of my favorites so far.
