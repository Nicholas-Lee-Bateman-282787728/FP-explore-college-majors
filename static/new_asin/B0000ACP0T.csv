1904791,4,B0000ACP0T,I like this video because it's easy to choose the level and the exercises you want to do.  I've used it before when it was in a VHS tape and was happy to see I could still get it in a DVD,1363824000,6,187,3.4523809523809526
1904792,5,B0000ACP0T,Tony did a great job on this exercise DVD. This is great for older folks like myself. Non impact but affective. Completely satisfied.,1343520000,7,133,4.826086956521739
1904793,5,B0000ACP0T,I had the VHS tapes years ago and every time I could get motivated to use them I lost weight. I was looking to shed some pounds now and did a search and found these. The time bar at the bottom of the screen along with Tony's personality makes this a great work out experience. I guarantee you the first time you do the DVD you will be sore and can tell it works.,1323302400,12,362,3.9054054054054053

1904795,4,B0000ACP0T,It's a good workout video by Tony Little.  It targets all the main muscle groups so you feel like your getting a complete workout.  The drawback is that it is short and not as intense as longer videos. But since it is short it is easy to squeeze it in if you're in a time crunch.,1229040000,6,279,3.9642857142857144
