1840161,4,B00008DDXJ,"Very enjoyable for Allingham fans. Stayed close to the book and only dropped one star due to the

""fuzzieness"" of some of the audio. The usual problems of the background music being too loud

was noted with some regret.",1169424000,11,219,4.589743589743589
1840162,5,B00008DDXJ,"Peter Davison is Albert Campion to the life in this detailed representation of Margery Allinghams classic mysteries of the 1930s. The BBC has once again lived up to its formidable reputation. Acting is fabulous, sets and costumes word perfect and direction is tight.

Such a shame there are only two box sets, produced in 1989 & 1990 respectively.

It would have been good to see more of Albert and Amanda as portrayed in the later novels.",1163116800,15,439,4.7631578947368425
1840163,5,B00008DDXJ,"Campion is very well portrayed by Peter Davison - the eccentric, brilliant detective with royal connections.  But for me it is his manservant and 'Watson' who makes this series - Magersfontein Lugg is superbly irreverent of the great and the good of the land.",1152921600,10,259,4.886363636363637
1840164,5,B00008DDXJ,"""Albert Campion.  Born 20 May 1900.  Name known to be a  pseudonym.  Education: privileged.  Embarked on adventurous career 1929.  Justice neatly executed.  Nothing sordid, vulgar, or plebian.  Deserving cases preferred, police no object.  Business address: 17 Bottle Street, Picadilly, London W1.  Specialist in fairy stories.""

I watched the Campion series on PBS' ""Mystery!"" when it first aired - I was only a young teenager, but as a life-long anglophile, not to mention sucker for 1930s mysteries, I was absolutely enamoured.  I awaited a re-run of the series (to no avail), but finally we have Mr. Campion and friends on DVD!  Peter Davison (""All Creatures Great and Small,"" ""Dr. Who,"" ""The Mrs. Bradley Mysteries"") is pitch-perfect as upper-class sleuth Albert Campion, and Brian Glover is incomparable as his manservant/sidekick, Lugg.  As with all BBC productions, all details of the series are impeccable, and the scenery is positively delicious.  Unlike many of his literary peers, Mr. Campion possesses great wit, and uses it disarmingly, even in the most stressful of situations (for instance, when the Bad Guys are practically upon him - hardly a time for anyone but our Campion to be cracking wise! -- some people just can't carry that sort of thing off, dontcha know...).  Even that other high-tone sleuth Lord Peter Whimsey can't match Mr. Campion!  Sit back, watch the adventures of Mr. Campion, and have a spot of fun!",1137628800,21,1437,5.151515151515151
1840165,4,B00008DDXJ,"Margery Allingham developed a number of plots involving actors and/or artists and this series includes them all.  Allingham's debonaire sleuth has a different background, than Marsh's Allyn or Sayers' Wimsey. Although of somewhat noble birth, he was born on the `wrong side of the covers' and his name does not reflect his pedigree. The name Campion is taken from a small white field flower that he sometimes wore in his buttonhole.

Unfortunately, this and other bits of trivia are missing from these DVDs, because the BBC videos are missing `Mystery Theater' hostess Diana Rigg who introduced the stories to PBS viewers and often shed additional light on the background of the protagonist and his sidekick valet-sometimes chauffeur of his car (which can give Morse's red sports car a run for the money any day) the former house breaker and very talented Mr. Lugg.

The first season includes episodes that feature: 1/ the ancient family secret of one of Campion's old school chums which involves a frightening sight that leads to death; 2/ A poisoner removing the members of an old family of Campion's acquaintance; 3/ The death of a bully who made Campion's life as a child hell; 4/ An artists family plagued by his misjudgements and misadventures long after his death.

Like Christie, Allingham excelled in stagecraft and her plots as well as her characterizations of Campion (played by Peter Davison -- `All Creatures Great and Small' and ""At Home With the Braithwaites) and Lugg are well done. Some of the peripheral actors are also well drawn, although occasionally a few are over-the-top which has more to do with dramatization than text. We learn more and more about Albert and his manservent as time goes by, but it would have been nice to have Lady Diana introducing each episode as some of the humor might be missed by those not familiar with the series. Although it isn't necessary, it is worth reading Allingham's books beforehand, so as to be in the know.",1105833600,43,1969,4.903903903903904
1840166,2,B00008DDXJ,"""BBC"" on the label has always seemed to be a mark of excellence for entertainment.  Deep character development, sophisticated dialogue, novel but realistic plots, much better than average acting, and so on, have nearly always justified the price of admission.  I found Campion to be an exception, however, on nearly every count.  To the extent that the acting is good, it does not and cannot compensate for weaknesses elsewhere.  My copy is going to the public library to sell to raise funds rather than to catalog for public circulation.  For real private investigator/police entertainment with a British flair, try Foyle's War and A Touch of Frost, both of which I have reviewed.  Cheers.",1086739200,20,690,5.061946902654867
1840167,5,B00008DDXJ,"This wonderful series is worth purchasing and watching over and over.  Even if - like me - you're not so much of a mystery aficionado, but you're just interested in watching a good story unfold, chances are you'll still become quickly engrossed.  In my particular case, I was captivated by actor Peter Davison long before I ever saw this series, so it was doubly easy for me to become involved in the stories!
The set is comprised of eight episodes on four discs.  Each story is told in two parts, the first of which always ends in a perfect cliffhanger.  The four stories, all based on the books by author Margery Allingham, are entitled (in order) ""Look to the Lady,"" ""Police at the Funeral,"" ""The Case of the Late Pig,"" and ""Death of a Ghost."" All four are wonderful, though the third is my personal favorite.  An added bonus is a fascinating special feature consisting of a behind-the-scenes look at the fourth story.
As for the actors, they too are absolutely perfect.  I cannot say enough about the aforementioned Mr. Davison, who plays the role of Albert Campion beautifully and has a smile that may leave some viewers in an incoherent stupor for upwards of forty-eight hours.  (He also sings the theme music.)  Campion's assistant, Lugg, is also wonderfully played by the late Brian Glover.  The scenes between the two of them are a lot of fun to watch.
Aside from the behind-the-scenes segment, the only other added feature(s) is/are the cast biographies, and some have complained that this set costs too much for something with so few add-ons - but personally I believe that it is worth every penny.",1084406400,56,1609,4.7178571428571425
1840168,4,B00008DDXJ,"Any fan of series like Sherlock Holmes with Jeremy Brett, Cadfael, or Jeeves & Woolster should love it. Not as much comedy as the latter but certainly a period piece of the 1930s that has great costumes and sets. Often a case deals with a wealthy client that has an estate in the country. It doesn't move at a fast pace until near the climax of the case. It may seem a bit slow at first, but well worth a little patience.

Albert Campion, played by Peter Davison, is not your average detective nor is his assistant Magersfontein Lugg, Brian Glover. He receives the ocassional assistance from his friend Chief Instpector Stanislaus Oates, played by Andrew Burt. He is not at all the bumbling inspector sometimes portrayed in some series, but is helpful and resourceful. Campion is charming and although he may seem quite whimsical at times, he's always completely attuned to what is happening around him. Lugg is quite adept at fereting out information at the local pubs or from the butlers, maids, and other hired help of the estates. A bit of a brute with a thick accent, he's always fun to watch in action. The cases are always interesting and show us a fascinating window into the society of this period.

The DVD quality is excellent and picture and sound are sharp and clear. The set includes behind the scenes look at ""Death of a Ghost"". A little disappointing that is all, but a series well worth adding to your collection of detective movies.",1073433600,36,1450,4.638132295719845
1840169,5,B00008DDXJ,"I was quite relieved, after the passage of almost 15 years, to find that this series was indeed as good as I remembered it. Peter Davison and Brian Glover were both terrific, as, respectively, the owlish Albert Campion and the rough-around-the-edges (but loyal) Magersfontein Lugg. The stories kept my attention with their twists and turns, the supporting casts were top-notch, and the scenery, costumes, and sets were a delight to the eye. Even the opening theme was as charming and soothing as I remembered. As is the case with most BBC transfers to DVD, don't expect much in the way of extras: you get some information concerning the television/film work the stars and supporting casts have engaged in, but that's about it. That's ok.....at least the sound and picture quality are very good, which is the main thing. So, after a hard day at the office settle down with a nice cup of tea (or, as Lugg says, ""I prefer cocoa meself"") and enjoy these wonderfully crafted stories. And let's hope that we don't have to wait 15 years for season two to come out on DVD!",1063584000,144,1064,4.695187165775401

Peter Davison is a perfect fit for the role of Campion.  He pulls off that blend of logical genius, adventurer, and social nerd (especially with women.)  Brian Glover is a perfect fit for Lugg.

I am watching it using Amazon Prime and while the quality of the video is very good, the audio is marginal. I don't think it is broadcasting issue, I think the original audio recording is poor. There are times when I cannot understand what is being said no matter how high I turn up my volume.

There is one episode where 2 characters are talking as they walk across a gravel covered parking area and all you can hear is the crunching of the gravel.

It is a hilarious period piece crime drama with a lot of great names from British TV and cinema in various roles. I love to see the old houses and cars. They obviously had a lot of fun making it. So sit down with a glass of wine, suspend belief and enjoy a couple of hours with a very unlikely but amusing detective and his sidekick.

The first thing my ears noticed are the almost incomprehensible dialects.  The producers clearly weren't worried about viewers across the pond.  However, that makes it all the more fascinating,  for you really have to work to unwrap each little jewel.  The dialogue has a everpresent wittiness that shouldn't be missed, set as it is against a somewhat somber plot tone from time-to-time.

1840533,5,B00008DDXJ,"I stumbled upon this detective series on Amazon Prime streaming - I had run out of 'Inspector Lewis' shows to watch after watching all five seasons many times - and I thought I'd try this series.  I prefer British TV shows to American but had never heard of Peter Davison (I stopped watching the 'Dr. Who' series around the time of Tom Baker).
Well - Peter Davison is a revelation, he is a brilliant actor who plays an amateur sleuth in 1930s England and is able to handle the 'upper-class twit' veneer with perfection. He is a skilled and subtle enough actor to show how intelligent & shrewd his character Campion really is under the witty and frivolous veneer - and athletic and pugilistic when needed - all without ever losing his poise as a aristocratic gentleman. It is nice to see a time when good breeding, impeccable manners, gallantry toward women were all a normal part of life -- perhaps just among the upper classes - and thank God there is no hopping into bed after one meeting between him and any woman or any scene of gore and blood.  I prefer to see G-rated lives, I don't know anyone who leads lives like the characters on American television!!
 The shows are uneven, with some plots much better and less convoluted than others. My favorite is 'Death of a Pig' which moves at a fast pace with no boring scenes whatsoever. That may be because there are several different directors for the episodes and each may bring a different caliber of directing ability.
The scenes without Davison always drag for me since none of the other actors are as charismatic as he, nor do they have his energy and charm.  The period costumes are just beautiful, as are the locations and cars and houses and everything else, and the actors inhabit this world so well.
I like Campion's butler or 'gentleman's gentleman' as Campion calls him (a former burglar, Lugg) who spars verbally with Davison/Campion but don't find their scenes  that funny - that could be because the sound quality on Amazon streaming for this show is quite dreadful. It is near impossible to understand the muttered Cockney dialect, as well as all the other regional dialects without the sound being loud enough.
It is an excellent series and I was very sad to see there were only 8 episodes. My guess is that it was a very expensive show to produce and they could not afford to keep it going.
Peter Davison is nothing short of perfection in this series.",1409529600,,2422,4.597222222222222

The plot lines are OK but it would be interesting for the writers to have included just a bit more character background and bank balance. The series is well acted and it is a pleasure to see some of the old character actors putting on an excellent performance. It is worth watching but then I am a mystery fan of the first order.

But, once again Amazon mucks it up with lousy streaming--this time in Episode 6, loosing its signal twice and getting stuck on endless searching, however, I have discovered that while Amazon has no forward/backward search, you can put your courser on the little dot that marks the program's travel and move it back and forth until the program behaves and goes on its merry way",1407369600,,621,4.697247706422019

Campion is a young aristocrat who solves crimes with the aid of his former burglar butler, a high level Scotland Yard inspector friend, and a seemingly boundless knowledge of the British underworld. Lots of quirks, puzzles, and complex plans make for a good incarnation of one of England's very popular crime solvers created by female mystery writers during that period.

I found the programs to be great at bringing the characters to life in both time and place. The stories were properly convoluted, and with appropriate reveals at the end. I enjoyed watching them, and loved the fact that I can just watch both halves of each episode in a single sitting. But I did not find them so engrossing that I wanted to binge watch the series.

1840611,4,B00008DDXJ,A good series that did not begin with the development of the character of Mr. Lugg and his relationship with Albert Campion. This relationship is crucial to the strength of the entire series and it does not become truly important until the second season. In the first season Campion is the unknown somehow wealthy sleuth who somehow figures things out. Little or no physicality within the series as everything is very gentlemanly and socially correct. The viewer suspects throughout the series that there is more to Mr. Lugg and it is not until the second season that this bears fruit. Still feel that seeing the first season is necessary before going on to the second season as the viewer will appreciate the quality of the second year by comparison.,1400112000,,751,4.829457364341085

Campion lends a helpful hand to the distressed, with wit & elegance, and the help of his formerly dodgy manservant.  It's not full of blood & gore, and violence is alluded to or shown vaguely enough that faint hearts need not fear.  Those who prefer edgy language & enjoy violence will find this gentler mystery series disappointing. It draws it's strength from story development rather than shock value.

The first two episodes (2 parts) was kind of interesting.  The introduction of the characters was rather poor.  It was unclear what the relationships were between characters.  It was kind of a guessing game which wasn't bad in itself.
The story-lines of the first 5 or 6 episodes I watched, were rather disjointed and without a good plot.

It starts out quietly in a Masterpiece Mystery sort of way and before you know it, your curiosity is captured without the stress and sorrow generated from the dead bodies in the more current Law and Order style mystery shows.  What Albert Campion as the hero may lack in testosterone is more than made up by his loyal manservant/father protector Lugg.  Heavy on the style but still with substance, it is to be recommended.",1394755200,,553,4.8

Can't really blame that on the show, since it's a British production made for Brits.  But the story's complicated enough as it is without finding the exposition incomprehensible.  We've moved on to House of Cards.  It's just as convoluted, but at least we can understand what Kevin Spacey is saying.",1392681600,,463,5.0394736842105265

I so enjoyed watching this British series.  He is suave and debonaire and whatever else he needs to be to fit each situation.
He's better than James Bond.

I would recommend this for anyone who likes the more laid-back British tv programming.  Every episode is full of twists and turns.  Really interesting to watch.

Firstly, I am addicted to mysteries and secondly Campion is like the flower whose name he carries, subtle and refined. It is wonderful to discover a protagonist who shares many characteristics with Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, Lord Peter Wimsey and Dr. John Thorndyke. The casting is perfect and the stories engaging, well plotted and thoroughly engrossing. Trust the British to produce shows which stand the test of time. I have viewed the available seasons twice now and found the second viewing as entertaining as the first. If you like mysteries and have not ""met"" Campion yet, don't delay.

1840678,5,B00008DDXJ,"The Campion series are light amusing detective stories set in 1930's England about a detective Albert Campion (not his real name) and his, only for lack of a better description, valet, Lug.  Lug is a reformed criminal and the polar opposite of his boss Albert Campion. All we can deduce about Campion is he is upper class, very well connected, and works for the Crown. The series is based on the books written by the great mystery writer Margery Allingham.  These shows were part of the Mystery series on PBS.  The stories are well crafted, move quickly and I never tire of the interplay between Campion and Lug. They are always interesting, funny and full of plot twists.",1391126400,,672,4.677966101694915
1840679,4,B00008DDXJ,"Peter Davison is well know to those who has seen ""All Things Great and Small"" as the younger brother of the Vet Practice and later as a younger version of Dr. Who.

Here he plays a man with Upper Class and Public School background who has a mysterious past, a murky relationship with Scotland Yard and British Intelligence and seems to make his ready money as what today would be call a ""Security Consultant"".  He is charming and delightful, with more than a little of his Dr. Who persona coming through but not very convincing in the fight scenes.  Some of this may be the BBC tendency to do the 'flail and grapple' school of fighting but if you have seen a professional against amateurs you know what I mean.  He also seems to have poor luck in his relationships with women, many seem to adore him but few are really close and the character seems to be uneasy when they are.  No female lead is ever developed during the series.

This has somewhat the story line of a Agatha Cristy but does not use the same rigid framework or development and our hero often does do a misstep.  The BBC produced two seasons of 8 episodes each (2 episodes per story) and well worth watching.  Brian Glover is the scene stealer in his role of Magersfontein Lugg - always referred to as 'Lug"" as Campion's ""Gentleman's Gentleman's"" who is in reality is a former burgler, and Campion's invaluable partner in investigations and his information link to the underworld.  Those episodes where the writers do not utilize 'Lug' very much are much flatter than when is character is in the middle.

Overall a fun two season series and I enjoyed watching as a Prime member.",1391126400,,1644,4.5423728813559325

As to the drama series itself, it is not in the class of a Poirot or Foyle.  Set in the '30's, the protagonist seems more like a geeky dweeb than a real sleuth.  But on a cold winter night, it's better than the trash that now populates American television.",1389657600,,411,4.746478873239437

Peter Davison plays Albert Campion, an untraditional & upper class sleuth, who makes himself available to his friends and acquaintances.  His butler, Lugg, a former burglar, is played by Brian Glover.  Both actors were perfectly cast and fun to watch.

1840703,4,B00008DDXJ,"While I enjoyed the story line, it felt slow moving to me.  Otherwise I would have rated it a 5.  Scenery was spectacular.",1388707200,,122,4.260869565217392
1840704,5,B00008DDXJ,"I love this series.... I am an avid mystery fan and somehow missed this series when it was on PBS.... Peter Davison is excellent as Campion and there is just enough humor and ""camp"" to make these episodes fun....",1388620800,,212,4.461538461538462
1840705,5,B00008DDXJ,"This was great fun, rediscovering Margery Allingham.  Peter Davison was great as Campion.  The period details, like the car were a special pleasure.  I am looking forward to Season Two.",1388534400,,185,5.1
1840706,5,B00008DDXJ,"It is a period piece that more than holds its own by way of mystery, adventure and a touch of romance .  It more than entertains, it involves the viewer.  I didn't want it to end.  There are a number of series with gadgets and "" red herrings"" that ultimately disappoint the viewer.  This did not.  I was sorry when it ended",1388448000,,323,4.145161290322581
1840707,5,B00008DDXJ,Period drama at its best. Really captures British life for this tome period.  Love the costumes and hair styles too.,1388188800,,116,4.8

1840709,5,B00008DDXJ,"We had not heard of this or seen it but it looked like a period piece (30s). It is, although the exact time is difficult to estimate. We tried watching one and we were hooked. A bit like a more modern Sherlock Holmes with just a bit of humor. Sorry the series has ended now but very happy that it lives on and is available on a Prime.",1387929600,,334,3.926470588235294
1840710,4,B00008DDXJ,It was simply a good show. I enjoyed it very much. Likeable main character. Good plots. Guest actors good. Lugg was a good character.,1387497600,,133,4.583333333333333
1840711,4,B00008DDXJ,"These programs are well done English mysteries set in the years just after the end of WWI. The period costumes, cars and settings are very well done. I would recommend them for anyone who enjoyed the Lord Peter Whimsey Mysyeries, the stories of Agatha Christie and others of this genre.",1387497600,,286,4.74

1840714,1,B00008DDXJ,"I am so glad this is available to Prime Members for free.  I would have been very upset if I paid for this TV series.  It was just plain boring.  The main character was supposed to be magical, and mysterious (I think that was what they were going for.)  Instead he came across like a Charlie Chaplin character who could not even express himself in words as well as the Chaplin character did with only facial expressions.  The story line was weak, and I could not even see how all the characters fit into the story.  I love British television, but this one was not my cup of tea.",1387065600,,578,4.256880733944954
1840715,1,B00008DDXJ,Liked this actor very much in the Last Detective and also like british period stories. However most of the stories in this season were very hard to follow due in my opinion to bad scripts.,1386979200,,188,4.4
1840716,4,B00008DDXJ,"I love the period setting,and all that goes with it. I think that the casting was on the mark,

1840719,1,B00008DDXJ,I really did not enjoy this series.  I thought Campion was a bit snobbish and rude while trying to be witty.  I did like his man-servant.  He had real character and was funny.,1385942400,,175,4.242424242424242
1840720,3,B00008DDXJ,"It is a bit slow... but the characters evolve with each episode. THen, you want to see how they act/react.
It is easy to follow - which sometimes is just what is needed in such a fast paced world.",1385942400,,196,4.051282051282051
1840721,3,B00008DDXJ,It may be just personal taste but I found this series a bit scattered in telling its story. I prefer Poirot or Miss Fisher.,1385769600,,123,4.166666666666667
1840722,4,B00008DDXJ,"It is a charming series but don't look for complicated plots, or compelling drama.  The characters are very pleasant, the settings, largely English country homes, are beautiful and it appears to be faithful to the era with the clothes, the furniture etc,  it doesn't have the brilliance of Poirot but enjoyable.  I was torn between a 3 or a 4.  If you would like to watch something while taking a break, this is good one.  Of course the lead is well known to British TV watchers--remember "" All creatures great and small?""",1385683200,,522,4.630434782608695

1840724,5,B00008DDXJ,"I actually had never seen Campion before but thought I would give it a try and see if I liked it. It really is a good mystery program and I enjoy the plots and the actors and really like the main actor, Campion. It's a shame there aren't more seasons to it.",1385596800,,257,3.9615384615384617
1840725,5,B00008DDXJ,"Most enjoyable without the hype of violence.  A good author  produces a good series.  I enjoy this period of ""drawing room"" mysteries.",1385596800,,134,5.0
1840726,4,B00008DDXJ,"It is all about Peter Davison--formerly The Fifth Dr. Who--as Albert Campion and his wonderfully wry take on a sort of dapper 1930s Sherlock Holmes in a well-tailored dinner jacket. Brian Glover is equally adept at treading the fine line between tongue firmly in cheek and over-the-top parody as the aptly named Lugg, Campion's Dr. Watson-cum-Jeeves, who also conveniently happens to be a reformed burglar, as well as stalwart companion.

The production clearly has great fun plundering the BBC's vast prop and set warehouses for forays as disparately far afield from London's more fashionable neighborhoods as lunatic backwater village witchcraft and the fulsome vanities of West End theatre stars--always with impeccable style, to be sure--yet somehow nearly always seeming to involve at least one grand country house as well as Lugg's convenient access to the secrets lurking beneath the surface in the downstairs realm and/or the criminal underworld.

Quite true, we have seen it all before, and so have the people who put this series together, which yields a delightfully entertaining, if not irreverently ironic twist on the tatty old tropes of the period whodunnit without ever stooping to the silliness of Monty Python.  To call Campion ""post-modernist"" would be much too pretentious, yet it's surprisingly smart TV. Pity all we get is sixteen episodes, each a two-parter, but better eight bang-up stories that than dribbling off into that dreary, formulaic mediocrity of too many shows not bright enough to quit while they were ahead.",1384646400,,1543,5.289795918367347
1840727,5,B00008DDXJ,"Male, Agatha Christy, fun and entertaining.  Mystery and suspense, light gruesome, classic how done it. No foul language or sex.",1383609600,,128,5.4
1840728,5,B00008DDXJ,"I've watched only the first two-part episode, but was surprised, delighted and entertained by what I saw and heard. This is a mystery with twists, with characters galore, and British humor throughout. The fifth star in this recommendation is a credit to the fun in this show that is rarely found on T.V. today, especially in modern American programming. A joyous find.",1383523200,,368,4.951612903225806
1840729,5,B00008DDXJ,One of the best series on Amazon. You'll be surprised with this super sleuth as he identifies the culprit. Campion will keep you entertained as he weaves his web through his wit and humor.,1383436800,,188,4.5588235294117645
1840730,5,B00008DDXJ,Well done!  And I really enjoy the characters.  Very believable and fun!  Shame there are only two seasons. It has just enhanced my love of the presentations of British mysteries and writers.,1383350400,,191,4.90625

1840736,5,B00008DDXJ,"We have thoroughly enjoyed the Campion mysteries.  The plots are excellent, and Peter Davidson is very entertaining in the role of Albert Campion.  We will probably purchase the second season set also.  We would recommend these DVD to anyone who likes a well-crafted mystery.",1382140800,,275,5.204545454545454
1840737,1,B00008DDXJ,"I read all the Allingham books & stories many years ago, and enjoyed them greatly.  So I was quite pleased to find these televised versions ... at least, until I started watching them.  They are abysmal.  The director and the actors seem to have completely missed the spirit of the stories, the acting is wooden, and the whole thing comes across as rather lame.

If you're a Campion fan, give this a miss.  If you're not a Campion fan, give it a wide berth.",1382140800,,457,4.392857142857143
1840738,5,B00008DDXJ,"This program was new to me.  It took a while for me to become involved with the characters, but soon I was completely captivated by the story line, the character development and the unexpected twists and turns of not only the plot, but the reactions of the characters.  Often the episodes unfold in two parts which gives them time to develop and embellish the story line. I look forward to watching each new episode.  As I have noticed with other British programs, you need to ""pay attention"", distractions will cause you to miss important subtle nuances.",1382054400,,555,4.760416666666667
1840739,3,B00008DDXJ,"I don't find the main character nor the cases especially interesting.  I always seem to doze off when trying to watch one of the episodes.  I like George Gently, Inspector Lewis, and Endevour much better.",1381449600,,204,4.8
1840740,5,B00008DDXJ,Loved the mystery and sense of humor of the main character. Enjoyed the English countryside and Campion's relationship with his side-kick who has a delightful English accent.,1381449600,,174,5.481481481481482
1840741,5,B00008DDXJ,I love it very much. I think anyone who likes murder mysters will like it also. Wish there was more,1381104000,,99,4.0

1840743,5,B00008DDXJ,"Since All Creatures Great and Small and some of Davison's other acting episodes, we have enjoyed Davison's portrayal of the characters he plays.  We do wish there were more episodes or movies available starring him on Amazon.",1380412800,,225,5.081081081081081

1840745,5,B00008DDXJ,a nice period piece that you can watch and enjoy without needing ot know the whole background.  I love the person playing Campion and love the look into England at that time.  Great characters.,1380153600,,193,4.647058823529412
1840746,5,B00008DDXJ,"This is so much fun--I have seen only episodes one and two, but they are so full of the energy and entertainment that was once a part of Tristan's contribution in the series All Creatures Great and Small that I'm certain it will be a new favorite of mine. The director allows for plenty of outside time, as well, with lush and heartwarming scenery, that also makes it a pleasure to watch. One of the humorous elements, at least to me, is how the main characters are so often seen walking long distances through fields or down walkways on the various estates, down cobble streets--absent of the ever-present car in so many productions. I look forward to seeing the rest of the episodes.",1379548800,,685,4.5772357723577235
1840747,5,B00008DDXJ,"This is a very good series and so were the books it came from.  The actors have been very good and very believable, I plan on watching the rest of the series.",1379116800,,158,3.9375
1840748,4,B00008DDXJ,"Charming.  A little gem! Loved the time period and the costumes were really good.  Would like to know the make of the red roadster Campion drove.  It was super!  Peter Davison did an excellent job and many in the guest casts are still acting many years later.  Looking forward to viewing his other series ""The Last Detective"" which was made 10 years or so later.",1378512000,,362,4.507692307692308
1840749,3,B00008DDXJ,The show is a little camp. It is not my style. I guess I need to watch more episodes to get the gest of it.,1377302400,,107,3.32
1840750,5,B00008DDXJ,Campion is whimsical and humorous as he solves Sherlock Holmes style crimes.  I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys British mysteries and comedies.,1376611200,,158,5.32
1840751,4,B00008DDXJ,"These are really good detective stories in the usual style of a British period piece. Peter Davison is great as Albert Campion. I've only read one Margerie Allingham book, and I liked this TV series better than the book.

The only bad part is a technical one. Like many British shows shown in America, the sound levels are incredibly uneven. There are frequent switches from quiet dialog to loud interstitial music. It keeps us constantly working our thumbs on the remote control volume buttons. Alas, this series does not have closed captioning on Amazon, so you can't get relief that way.",1376524800,,590,4.841584158415841
1840752,1,B00008DDXJ,"Slow, too much of a Sherlock Holmes wannabe.  it was too campy and too predictable.  didn't watch more than the first 30 minutes and quit",1376352000,,137,4.44
1840753,4,B00008DDXJ,These are very well done stories. The characters are interesting and imaginative. They are set in period - early 29th century. Some humor thrown in for good measure. Definitely good entertainment that you don't have to be embarrassed about.,1376006400,,240,5.17948717948718
1840754,4,B00008DDXJ,"When I was a child and browsing through my local libraries, I found many delicious treats. Margary Allingham was one of them, along with Agatha Christie, Ngaio Marsh and Dorothy Sayers. The Campion series is a relic of those times when the caste system of Britain was undergoing considerable change. The Campion series combines the action of an E. Phillips Oppenheim or John Buchan with the school of the Christie/Sayers/Marsh with it's commentary on British social life.",1375660800,,471,5.12987012987013
1840755,4,B00008DDXJ,Character of Campion was very likeable.  Maybe they can restart series and do some more of the stories by the book's author.,1375574400,,124,4.636363636363637
1840756,5,B00008DDXJ,"I am still partial to The Lord Peter Wimsey stories, especially the programs with Edward Petherbridge, but the Campion stories are great fun. The Campion stories are more adventure stories instead of detective stories (the viewer is never given enough details to solve the mystery), but still an enjoyable ride.",1375574400,,311,5.24
1840757,4,B00008DDXJ,Great period piece with great supporting characters.  The only con is that it does sometimes drag on but it is still very good.,1375056000,,127,4.521739130434782
1840758,5,B00008DDXJ,"I stumbled on to this little gem after stumbling on to the series of books. It's amazing how well they've been able to follow the books and convey the spirit of the times. It's well acted, well done series for those who like the older style.",1374710400,,241,4.260869565217392
1840759,5,B00008DDXJ,"I enjoyed watching all of the episodes.  They reminded me of some of the Agatha Christie stories - fun to watch and very little violence.  A nice way to spend an evening.  Of course, I always enjoy Peter Davison and Brian Glover.  I'll watch this several times.",1374624000,,261,4.48936170212766

1840762,3,B00008DDXJ,A bit dated. One interesting thing: the actors (other than Campion) weren't at all attractive. Very different than modern series. Could barely understand Lug.,1372982400,,158,5.625
1840763,4,B00008DDXJ,This is the first that I have heard of this show and I enjoyed it immensely. The only reason I gave it 4 stars as opposed to 5 is because the 2nd season was even more enjoyable which I did not expect that the this could be better than this season. I am surprised that there were only 2 seasons considering the quality of the show.,1372982400,,330,4.015151515151516
1840764,4,B00008DDXJ,"I am enjoying this series with excellent dialogue, especially for Campion.  The stories are good in the style of the English Country Manor House genre.  A little spooky, a little funny, and quite entertaining.",1371686400,,209,5.117647058823529
1840765,5,B00008DDXJ,"From the lovely music and graphics at the beginning, to the end of the story, ""Campion"" is a treat. No vulgarity, sex for its own sake, gratuitous violence: it's not wanted or needed in this series.
Campion is someone you would like as a friend, as he proceeds to gently and carefully examine and solve murders. That's not to say that he can't win a punching match or shoot, which he does when called upon! His trusty aide, Lug, is a wonderful character. The two together are a portrait of friendship.
I haven't solved one mystery yet. You get all the clues, but putting them together is a challenge.
The show very, very British. If you don't like BBC offerings, you might not like this, but should at least try it.",1371686400,,715,4.465648854961832
1840773,5,B00008DDXJ,"This is one of my favorite series - I thoroughly enjoy the way Martyn Friend portrays his character, Albert Campion.

1840774,5,B00008DDXJ,"I enjoyed ""Campion"" when it was on the local PBS station years ago. With Amazon Prime, I can watch again. The cast puts on a fine performance. The stories are entertaining, without a lot of violence and gore, as some American shows are.",1371081600,,236,4.511627906976744
1840775,5,B00008DDXJ,Love the nods to thirties acting and camera styles! And it's nice to have a good mystery without body parts.,1371081600,,108,4.45
1840776,5,B00008DDXJ,The Campion characterization is very fun.  The old fashioned rural English scenes are lovely and are captured in most episodes.,1370649600,,127,5.35
1840777,4,B00008DDXJ,This is like a sherlock and Watson with more humor. The fact that this show is a mystery shows in the lead character but with our all the unnecessary violence that appears on current tv. Love the cars,1370649600,,200,4.2894736842105265
1840778,4,B00008DDXJ,"This show falls into the category of light British humor sprinkled with a touch of mystery.  Campion's

1840780,4,B00008DDXJ,"Very good series.  The characters are interesting and act like real people.  The time period with the clothes, cars and vocabulary is presented excellently.  Being an American some of the language and accents are hard to follow but that's part of the fun of the show.  I also like the double episodes.  Bravo!",1368662400,,309,4.754716981132075

1840782,3,B00008DDXJ,"If you like english murder mysteries, this is great fun.  Maybe not quite as addictive as Agatha, but it will keep you very interested, and coming back for the next episode.  Definitely has a quality that 'reality tv' doesn't.",1368489600,,226,4.769230769230769
1840783,4,B00008DDXJ,This is a cute show.  I enjoy the period and costumes and the story lines.  It's a little 'see-through' but that's okay.  It's a thoroughly enjoyable watch!,1368144000,,156,4.703703703703703
1840784,5,B00008DDXJ,"Wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy when the dated 80's opening song started, but I stuck with it and found Campion charming, fun, smart and witty.  I love British cozy mysteries with unusual detectives.

1840839,3,B00008DDXJ,"""Look to the Lady"" is the pilot episode of the series where they felt it would be entertaining to toss in everything but the kitchen sink to make the characters and plot seem curious, eccentric and mythical.  A disowned and derelict son must return to a castle where his forebears guard an ancient sacred chalice.  It's a bit of a quest and a treasure hunt, mixed in with peculiar secrets, religion and thieves.  It's a little difficult to figure out just what is going on, even at the conclusion.

""Death of a Ghost"" brings Campion to an artist colony where everyone is a little off the wall and living off the charitable legacy of a once great artist named Lafcadio.  His widow unveils a Lafcadio painting each year from a stock  left in storage just to perpetuate his name.  Ah but there is a secret about these paintings and the plot thickens with Lafcadio red, made from a paint formula known only to a few people.  Frankly, this episode gets a bit hammy all around (artists are so emotional) and Campion could use some rescuing himself.

""Police at the Funeral"" is a misnomer, because there never is a funeral.  What there might be is a murder trial for a family of rather stupid offspring living off their very old, rich mother.  They bicker, annoy each other on purpose, and cope with numerous character flaws, while living in a rather creepy old mansion.  Mom keeps control of the pursestrings, because none of them can be trusted to do anything right.  Campion must find out what has happened to a family member who has disappeared, and solve the great secret behind some blackmail.

""Death of the Late Pig"" brings Campion back to his old stamping grounds and a former girlfriend who still has a  crush on him.  Her father needs help solving a murder.  Someone has figured out a way to drop a stone urn off the roof and kill an old school chum of Campion's nicknamed ""Pig"" because of a disgusting snorting sound that seems to be inherited.  Post nasal drip aside, there is a good collection of eccentrics and red herrings to confuse things.",1360108800,6,2050,4.585164835164835

1840841,5,B00008DDXJ,"Once again, BBC outdoes its self with adapting books to TV. This time it is with a Margery Allingham mystery, Camion. Screenplay by Elaine Morgan.

Peter Davison as Albert Campion and his faithful companion Brian Glover as Magersfontein Lugg are so good in this 1989 TV series that even when you read the book you think of them. The story is abbreviated and takes a little time to get off the ground; however first time through the program you will notice some standard ploys as a person confessing that has a good chance of actually being the culprit (how many times have we seen this?)  By the second viewing, you see the clues that you missed, and you are hooked.

In this installment, Lugg (Brian Glover) gets a peripheral part, which is disappointing. Campion is present for an unveiling of a painting form the deceased artist. Suddenly the lights go out and someone is dispatched; however, this is not the mystery.

Soon the secondary artist that was dispatched is being forgotten as all his paintings are disappearing. What is this, a nefarious plot by some cabal and to what end? Alternatively, are we just paranoid?

My favorite scene is when the lights come on and Rosa (Carole Ruggier) exclaims ""Santa Maria""
I could almost hear her saying ""Jesus, Mary and Joseph""

The secondary characters make the film series just work a little better -- Lugg is delightful, and there is just some fun, good humor with the adventure/mystery.  The BBC does a lovely job with the production -- the cinematography and authenticity and atmosphere are truly late 1920's/early 1930s England.",1306108800,2,502,5.185185185185185
1840850,4,B00008DDXJ,"Just as a suspension of logic is necessary to believe in Miss Marple, a suspension of logic is necessary to believe in Campion.  First of all, he lets everyone know that ""Albert Campion"" is a pseudonym, but yet all of his old chums from school know him by that name.  Our dear boy must have known he wanted to be a sleuth from the time he was in short pants.  Secondly, he has a Scotland Yard detective available to him on demand.  Thirdly, he leaves his nicely-furnished flat unlocked because he lives next to a police station and no one would dare steal from him anyway.  Add that to small details like believing that (in Dancers in Mourning, Season 2) someone would store a real live hand grenade under sheet music on top of the grand piano, and you get the idea.

But - this series IS entertaining.  The period details (1930's) are fabulous.  The plots (and the villains) are not obvious, and  engaging.  The real flaw in the series is that Campion's man servant, the oddly named Magersfontein Lugg, speaks some sort of language that is apparently supposed to be a lower-class dialect of British English.  Unfortunately, it is all but unintelligible to American ears.  When he gets together with one of his old cronies from his former life of crime, they might as well be speaking Hittite.  I guess it's supposed to show that he comes from 'umble origins, and has risen above all that.  But mostly it's just annoying.  Thank heavens our hero Campion is usually the one with the truly important pieces of information in his lines.

This series is the type to provide good entertainment on a rainy day.  Enjoy.",1302393600,18,1612,4.6

As a result of this new movie access I found the Campion series of British TV mysteries; having enjoyed Campion as played by Peter Davison we selected it for viewing and have really enjoyed Season 1 all over again. Peter Davison as Campion and Brian Glover as Lugg both do excellent jobs in their respective rolls and is fun to watch. I'll have to admit the heavy accent used by Glover in portraying Lugg makes understanding what he is saying something of a challenge from time to time.

The individual mysteries are all two parters and utilize the time honored cliff-hanger technique which leaves the viewer eager to watch the next segment of the story. Fortunately in this case one has the option of immediately viewing the second part so one doesn't have to suffer in suspense too long.

One minor shortcoming is the movie versions don't reveal the thinking processes that Campion goes through to solve the mysteries that are more fully revealed in the books. That doesn't seriously compromise the movie versions but may leave the viewer wondering how Campion came up with that conclusion.

These are an enjoyable series of British mysteries and are especially fun to watch if you have video streaming capability and are a member of Amazon Prime.",1299196800,5,1493,4.7528957528957525

The Scarlet Pimpernel or something close to it.  Thereafter, however, the stories are conventional, Campion has only one name, has roots within the British class system, and he lives in a town where everyone knows him.  Discs two, three, and four are conventional mysteries.  And they are not well done.  Disc four, Death of a Ghost, is the worst.  I thought I was watching high school actors at times.  And the character of Campion, who seems feckless and gets beaten up, makes little sense.  Peter Davison made a wonderful Trisan in ""All Creatures.""

It's not as good as ""Sherlock Holmes"" (1980s) or ""Poirot"" (1990s), but Margery Allingham's novels were in some ways send-ups of Agatha Christie, so there is more humor here. Her detective is Albert Campion (Peter Davison), born into an aristocratic English family in 1900. He rejects his family's expectations and chooses a life of adventure and sleuthing under a variety of aliases, one of which is Albert Campion. His offices are in his flat at 17 Bottle Street, where he lives with his uncouth ex-con butler/valet Lugg (Brian Glover) above the police station where his friend Inspector Stanislaus Oates (Andrew Burt) works. The brass plaque on the door says: ""Mr. Albert Campion, The Goods Department.""

Campion seems to be estranged from most of his family and has rejected their social status, but every case in Series 1 involves someone whom he either knew through his family or knew in childhood. They must know his real name and identity, yet they implausibly have no trouble accepting his alias and remembering to call him by his pseudonym. Family is a running theme. Two mysteries from Series 1 revolve around a wealthy family and its secrets. Two feature imposing grandes dames whom Campion has known and admired for a long time. All of the mysteries are based on novels that Allingham wrote in the 1930s, but the years have been changed for the films. ""The Case of the Late Pig"" and ""Death of a Ghost"" are said to take place in 1934 and 1935 respectively.

After watching the first episode, I didn't think I would like this series. The plot is convoluted and implausible, involving gypsies, archeologists, gangsters, aristocrats, and a precious objet d'art. Campion's manner is flippant and annoying. His manservant Lugg is a pugnacious, suspicious,  whiney, ill-mannered misanthrope. I suppose he is intended to be a send-up of the iconic English valet -efficient, loyal, and indispensible. Exaggerating these ideal traits might have made for better comedy than rejecting them. Lugg is distasteful, not funny. But the series improved as it progressed. The third movie is laugh-out-loud funny. The forth has its moments. Campion became more sympathetic and affable. Lugg remained distasteful, but we see less of him.

The mysteries are:

""Look to the Lady"": Mr. Albert Campion arranges for down-and-out Percival ""Val"" St. John Gyrth (Robin McCallum) to meet him at his offices. Val arrives bewildered by his taxi cab adventure and wondering who Campion might be. Campion advises Val that the Medieval Chalice that is his family's treasure is in danger of being stolen by someone called ""George"", representing a group of wealthy collectors. Val's eccentric Aunt Diana is the current ""Mistress of the Cup"", responsible for the artifact's safety. Campion and Val head to the family home in Suffolk, where Val is reunited with his father Col. Gyrth (John Horsley), from whom he has been estranged, and his sister Penny (Sarah Finch). The estate is replete with legends of a ""nameless horror"" in a secret chamber and an otherworldly beast that haunts the clearing. When Aunt Diana dies in that clearing, it only adds to the mysteries.

""Police at the Funeral"": A school acquaintance of Campion's, Marcus Featherstone (John Harding), asks him to look into the circumstances troubling his fiance Miss Joyce Blount (Suzanne Burden). Joyce lives with her Great Aunt Caroline Faraday (Mary Morris) in the family's Cambridge home, an imposing matriarch and longtime friend of Campion's grandmother. Also living in the home are Aunt Farady's son William (Timothy West), daughters Julia (Gililan Martell) and Kitty (Avril Edgar), and roguish, cruel nephew Andrew Seeley (John Franklyn-Robbins). Andrew disappeared Sunday while walking home from church, which worries Joyce, as he hasn't collected the money he recently won from his bookmaker. Joyce's suspicions are confirmed when Andrew is found dead in the river from a gunshot wound. Oddly, he was also bound, making William the obvious suspect.

""The Case of the Late Pig"": Campion receives an anonymous letter referencing Roland Isidore ""Pig"" Peters, a man who bullied him in school as a boy, the same day he sees Peters' obituary in the newspaper. He attends the funeral, where he sees schoolmate Gilbert Whippet (Rob Edwards) who received a similar letter. Three months later, Campion receives an urgent call from Janet Pursuivant (Amanda Elwes), daughter of his family friend Sir Leo Pursuivant (Moray Watson), a police inspector. A man named Oswald Harris is in the local morgue, killed by a falling geranium urn at the local country club owned by Mrs. Poppy Burridge (Dilys Laye). The strange this is: Harris looks exactly like Pig Peters. In fact, he appears to be the man who died 3 months earlier. Effie Rowlandson (Claire Jacobs), Peters' brassy fiance, insists on seeing the body, which has now gone missing.

""Death of a Ghost"": Campion attends a soire hosted by Belle Lafcordio (Jean Anderson), widow of esteemed painter Johnny Lafcordio, who requested that, beginning 10 years after his death, one new painting would be revealed each year for 12 years. On the evening of the eighth unveiling, the electricity goes out briefly and, when the lights come back on, the painter Tom Dacre (Patrick Bailey) is dead with a pair of jeweled scissors protruding from his chest. His fiance, Belle's granddaughter Linda (Amanda Harris), is suspected, as she and Tom had argued over his marrying his haughty Italian model Rosa (Carole Ruggier) so that she may stay in the country. Campion is convinced of Linda's innocence, and Inspector Oates has no evidence. The investigation turns to imperious art dealer Max Fustian (Shaughan Seymour) and the Potters, who live and work on the estate.",1518739200,,6008,5.117227319062182

I will watch more episodes in spite of the disjointedness of the story line and music. The scenery, automobiles, and music add a lot of intrigue and culture to the period setting.",1515715200,,340,4.412698412698413

Often these are dated before my favorite shows were even conceived and Campion is one such gem! A great mix of classic English wit, suspense and entertainment with a lovely motley crew of characters. Taken in context of the time and era, this show is a lot of fun.",1507420800,,402,4.445945945945946

Exciting and entertaining twists with great period costumes and autos, (and horse teams).
