200830,2,1600591000,"This DVD is useful in the beginning only. Very soon it is no longer needed; therefore, it is not worth $30.00; perhaps $10.00 for a used copy, but not much more.",1176768000,5,161,4.225806451612903
200831,4,1600591000,I finally made the move to a digital SLR and was overwhelmed by the amount of buttons and funtions that were present.  I bought the DVD to help me get started. It goes over all the functions and helps you to understand why the camera is designed the way it is. It actually helped me to think about how to organize my ideas on how to shoot pictures.  I'm glad I bought the DVD.,1171497600,11,376,4.0675675675675675

7800089,5,1600591000,Simply awesome. Now I know how to use my camera. I wish Canon sold this video with the camera.,1258416000,,94,4.0
7800090,5,1600591000,"This DVD was perhaps the best investment I made for learning how to get the most out of my Rebel XTi -- and quickly!  Just pop the DVD in, pick up your camera, sit back and relax!  It's like having a personal tutor guide you through your camera's settings!  What's this button do?  Why would I adjust that?  At any moment, just hit pause and play with the camera yourself to test out what you've just learned... learning couldn't be easier!  You get results fast, and it's so convenient to just pop the DVD back in for a refresher!

I also really enjoyed the presenter's content and style -- quick and to the point, hits all of the highlights, skips the chaff, and tells you ""like it is"" - what settings to use and why!  I couldn't recommend this more - especially if you're still fairly new to the Rebel XTi!",1232668800,2,809,4.311258278145695
7800091,3,1600591000,"Good book for beginners, I'm one... but I still suck taking pictures. Maybe not because the book but it's better to try to make your own mistakes than trying to wait for a book that tell you what to do...If you bought a Canon in their page they have tutorials...

Good look with your shots!!!",1224547200,,292,4.3090909090909095

7800094,5,1600591000,"I bought the camera looked at the manual and knew I needed help. I spent an afternoon with this DVD and my camera and now I am a lot more confident about using it. If you need ""Canon Rebel for Dummies"" like I did, this is it!",1197504000,10,225,3.8085106382978724
