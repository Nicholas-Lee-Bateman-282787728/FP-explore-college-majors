7710763,5,B01DBVQ4KE,"Saw the sequel in theaters, i liked it so i rented this. Liked it too, so i bought it on 4k, as well as the sequel. The HDR really pops when they pull off tricks involving lights, otherwise you don't really notice the HDR part of UHD/4k.",1511827200,2,237,4.0638297872340425

7710772,3,B01DBVQ4KE,"Received this movie as a Christmas gift. I love the movie and wanted to be able to watch it on my Android devices.
My disappointment came when I tried to redeem the digital copy, and it wouldn't accept it into Vudu (Ultraviolet) at all (said it was an invalid code),
I had to create created an Itunes account (I'm an Android fan). Once I did that, I was able to redeem the code, but only into my itunes account. The redemption certificate even states you can redeem as an Ultraviolet movie. See the attached photo of the redemption certificate.
The redemption instructions are pretty unclear. I've never had a problem redeeming these codes before.
I guess I'm stuck viewing my digital copy on my Windows PC, unless I want to hassle with trying to return it.
Apple is not an option for me, as I have never and don't plan on ever owning an Apple or I-anything product. I'll probably never view it, because I don't like Apple products.
This issue needs to be fixed or clarified in the description of the 4KUHD disc so you know what you'll be getting before you order it.
Amazon, if you can fix this and give me a new redemption code that is able to be redeemed on Ultraviolet, I would greatly appreciate it.",1482624000,4,1204,4.452488687782806

7710784,2,B01DBVQ4KE,"Loved the movie but the conversion to 4K shows the limitation of poor GCI, especially in the Vegas show part.  In other words, the quality isn't better than the regular blu-ray.",1470960000,,177,4.709677419354839

7710794,5,B01DBVQ4KE,"Re-watched this movie in 4K, prior to the 'Now You See Me 2' coming out in theaters.  This was quite an entertaining, full of plot twists and turns and fast paced witty dialogue.  4K transfer is pretty good, more pronounced in the quieter scenes in my opinion.  All in all a good popcorn flick.  I will say the final plot surprise was a bit forced, but fun to watch none the less.",1466553600,,380,4.236111111111111

7710802,3,B01DBVQ4KE,"While the movie itself is great, and the 4K video looks as good as it should look, it is disappointing to see that the 4K disc does not include extended edition of the movie, while the regular blu ray disc included in the package includes both theatrical and extended editions.",1464739200,24,277,4.56

8755465,5,B01DBVQ4KE,"This movie was a genuine surprise -- not only in terms of its entertainment value, but also because of its many twists and turns.  Great cast, clever caper plot, and lots of magic tricks.  Way more entertaining than its Rotten Tomato score would indicate.  I'm looking forward to introducing this one to friends who never heard of it.  I have no idea why this movie had not been on my radar screen (the truth is, I thought it was a different movie when I ordered it), but it should have been way up there.  The 4K disc looks and sounds pristine, adding another level of enjoyment to my experience.  I love magic, so this movie kept my interest throughout.  And its final bevy of surprises was the best trick of all.",1519257600,,715,4.412213740458015
8755466,5,B01DBVQ4KE,"Great plot, soundtrack, acting and video quality.

Well worth buying in the 4K version if you have both 4K player and 4K HDTV!  4K version is noticeably better quality than the 1080p Blu-ray!",1511827200,,191,4.757575757575758
