2415805,2,B000BF0CNO,"When I first showed this in my World Literature class, it skipped through-out. I changed dvd players, but no change. I returned the product and ordered a replacement. Sadly, the replacement skips in the same places. I assume the whole lot is defective, but I could be wrong. I apologize to my students beforehand for the irritation. It IS a nice overview. I just wish I could get a decent copy. A VHS copy would be nice, but it isn't listed on the History Channel's website.",1271030400,3,474,4.523255813953488
2415806,1,B000BF0CNO,"I expected of this documentary a good description of the gods and the history of each one, and instead I'd purchased a poorly description with no history of the birth of the gods, nor the gods themselves.",1266796800,21,204,4.54054054054054
2415807,5,B000BF0CNO,"Great History DVD, the Greek Gods are well descrived, and the journey is really interesting. Recommended!",1179014400,18,105,5.625
2415808,2,B000BF0CNO,"Two hours' worth of info on the Ancient Greek gods!?  You can't help but learn something.  I didn't know the word ""hygiene"" came from a god's offspring.  I knew one goddess burst out of Zeus' head, but I didn't know another appeared from a god's bleeding genitals.

Though informative, this is filled with cheesy reenactments.  The work could have been shorter.  It has a diverse group of interviewees in terms of gender and institutional location.

I thought it was a bit heterosexist.  It emphasizes that Zeus seduced goddesses and mortal women.  I don't recall it mentioning Ganymede and that Zeus seduced males too.  Perhaps due to the cross-generational romance in male-on-male mythology, the History Channel didn't want to turn off concerned parents.  Still, it seems like a bigoted de-gaying of the past that is potentially oppressive.  It also doesn't give modern viewers an accurate picture of Ancient Greek life and beliefs. We see reenactments of heterosexual romance, but none of the [...] variety.

In Ancient Greece, statues and people were often nude.  This work dances around that fact, but it doesn't avoid it.  You see the silhouette of an athlete being crowned and it's implied that the athlete and the rewarder are nude.

You may want to see this work after showing ""Clash of the Titans"" to first-time viewers.",1178236800,19,1330,5.004566210045662

8086180,5,B000BF0CNO,"We only have 50 minutes so this has to be a quickie overview. This is part of the ""In Search of History"" series.

We get various views of the gods from the titans down to the heroes. We learn how they were born and how they interacted with the common folk.

There may be a few misleads; however if you know them you can over look them. If you do not know them it will not mislead much. One such is the inference that Homer covered the 10 year Ilium war in the Iliad.

Aside from the narration and presenters there are some beautiful panoramas.

It is worth the purchase and re-watching.",1404777600,2,586,4.205357142857143
8086181,1,B000BF0CNO,"I don't know about the programming content because I've not seen it. Though I usually love all of these type of programs on the history channel.

 I recieved a broken DVD via shipping and I've had to write numerous emails to get a shipping label and be ""allowed"" to return it.  Actually, as of yet, I still haven't gotten the shipping label.

The distinct impression that I have recieved is that the company I purchased it from doesn't want to pay for return shipping. I will NEVER buy from this seller again.  Mistakes happen, but the way that they have handled a simple return is a joke. Not to mention the snarky attitude of  the first person I delt with.

I would have been content with just a replacement copy of the DVD being sent... But not after the attitude of the first person I delt with. Now I want my money back, for everything, including the shipping fee for it to get to me.",1386979200,,889,4.351515151515152
8086182,3,B000BF0CNO,"I'm a geek...yes, you read that right.  I'm also a quarter Greek and fascinated by the Greek Gods and myths!  To me there's not really a way to make Greek myths boring, but this DVD proves me wrong.
This would be a good DVD to use in a classroom as a teaching tool, however if you plan on purchasing it for personal viewing pleasure I can suggest alternatives; Clash of The Gods for one.
While this is informative, it's also bland and clearly not meant for entertainment value.
So, if you're a student looking to cram for an essay or exam and want a summary of Greek Gods this is for you.  It's cut and dry.
If you are looking for both entertainment and information, keep looking...this is not for you.",1374624000,2,702,4.343511450381679
