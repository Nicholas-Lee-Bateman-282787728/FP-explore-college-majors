8416574,1,B00457VJI6,"What to say about this ""mockumentary""?  Well, for starters:

1)  It sucks.

2)  It's not funny.

3)  It's amateurishly acted (and written).

4)  It sucks.

Seriously, $1.99 is too much for this, and bear in mind that you are committing to an hour and twenty minutes of your life that you'll never get back.  It's just NOT funny.  I really don't understand why the other reviews are so high on this movie unless there's some kind of relationship between the movie makers and the reviewers.  (Maybe they owe them money?)  Really, this just isn't good.

The premise seems rather promising, but the execution is, well... meh.  There's just nothing to make it worth plunking down your hard-earned cash.  I will include one caveat:  I didn't make it through the whole movie.  After 40 minutes of not one laugh or even anything I thought was sort of clever, I switched it off and deleted it from my drive.  I'm sure this was well-intentioned.  But the execution is pointless and boring.",1311897600,,979,4.674556213017752
8416575,5,B00457VJI6,"I was one of the millions of Americans who believed that William Henry Harrison died a month into his only term as president. Then I saw this film and learned the cold, hard truth: that Harrison faked his death and went on to exert power beyond the ability of a mere president!

This is a must-watch for anyone who wants to know the real force that made America into the country it is today.

I eagerly await a follow-up report on James Garfield's ""assassination."" I never trusted that guy.",1304812800,,490,4.49438202247191
8416576,5,B00457VJI6,"WHH is a solid mockumentary written, directed and somewhat starring Dan Calif-Glick.  While Dan freely admits to his lack of experience (I believe he reshot at least one scene over due to suckage), the film has a great sense of humor and the story is easy to follow.  The actors do an amazing job, and I just can't believe how much additional footage was shot.  There are several shorts on the DVD that add insight to the main characters, heck even the side characters get their own spotlight.

For a zero budget movie made by someone without film school experience, WHH is surprisingly great.",1292198400,,593,4.673076923076923
8416577,5,B00457VJI6,"When I sat down to watch this film, I thought I would learn a lot about William Henry Harrison, which I did, but I had no idea I would be laughing for two straight hours too. This film is very wry and amusing, full of great performances. My favorite is a cameo by the director as the leader of the William Henry Harrison Fan society. It walks the line between fact and fiction in a perfect way. Very entertaining and illuminating. Check this documentary out.",1291507200,,458,4.4
8416578,5,B00457VJI6,"So you dozed off during the 30 seconds that William Henry Harrison was covered in your American history class.  Well don't despair.  This movie will bring you up to speed on everything you missed and it will blow your mind with everything ""they"" never wanted you to know.  ""Triumph"" stares the greatest cover up in American history straight in the eye and doesn't blink.  If you're looking for a thriller that will make you pee your pants (from laughter of course), then look no further.  Besides, think of how smart you'll feel when you know the answer to that age old question ""who was the ninth president of the United States.""",1291161600,,630,4.63963963963964
8416579,5,B00457VJI6,"this movie really freaked me out.  seriously.  the whole time i was watching it, i kept thinking ""This CAN'T be real!?!?!""  But it is!  It's so shocking to think that there are so many things we don't know about the history of our politicians, and even the history of our country!  We have so many things in place to guarantee transparency in our government and to make sure that it is representative of the people and to make sure that our politicians' lives are completely revealed in their entirety before they're elected. But we have nothing to guarantee that transparency after they die.  Once they die, we think ""well, that's the end of THAT story.""  What sense does that make?  I think Obama should definitely do something about that.  I never would've believed that one of our Presidents (William Henry Harrison of all people) could do something like this--especially not back then when everyone was way less smart than they are now.

I can't believe we're not talking more about Harrison in the news!  This dude was CROOKED.

AND THE DOCUMENTARY IS AWESOME",1290902400,,1065,4.759562841530054
8416580,5,B00457VJI6,"When a cohort brought me out to a film festival in the vast wasteland of New Jersey, I wanted to hit him over the head with a shovel. After all, wouldn't anyone? The usual fare of merely great to excellent independent films did nothing to appease my desire for striking with a digging tool. However, the main event truly was something to behold, and completely justified the trip out to that place. The final piece was a movie so well-constructed, so well-written, so damn FUNNY, that I fear my words will not do it justice (and this is not a fear I have very often).

The Triumph of William Henry Harrison lives up to its name. In a style I hesitate to call a mockumentary, the film tells the simultaneous stories of the secret life of the ninth President of the United States and the trials a plucky young reporter has to go through to discover these (admittedly poorly-guarded) secrets. Filled with lovable characters, exciting plot, and hilarious dialogue, this movie is sure to amuse anyone who watches it. This is definitely not the William Henry Harrison your eighth grade history teacher told you about.

Buy it for that history buff in your life, watch it with them, and then buy it for everyone you know. With at least three for yourself.",1290729600,,1248,4.617117117117117
8416581,5,B00457VJI6,"The Triumph of William Henry Harrison was intriguing, hilarious, and absurdist in tone.  Above all, it's a highly original and enjoyable film for anyone who's tired of the same-old Hollywood thing or just interested in a refreshing dose of revisionist history.

The custom soundtrack for the film is awesome, and the director's editing choices will keep you glued to the screen from the intro montage onward.  I love the idea that William Henry Harrison was a nefarious force behind the scenes of most of American history, and the plot that evolves from that premise will keep you laughing and engaged.

This movie is packed with stellar performances from as-yet unknown actors, and it also includes the famous Ed Asner and Jonathan Alter.  I feel like this movie is flying just under the radar, and anyone who sees it is in for a treat.",1290643200,,837,4.825174825174825
8416582,5,B00457VJI6,Hilarity prevails! Who the hell would even think to make a movie about William Henry Harrison?! This young director did. And with his band of merry men and women has managed to create an original story that is both entertaining and amusing.,1290384000,,240,4.738095238095238
8416583,5,B00457VJI6,"I understand it's easy to be jaded. It seems like every year, Hollywood pumps out another Academy Award-winning film about William Henry Harrison, our nation's most noble and most tragic president. Is it any surprise? His story, from his silver spoon-fed birth, to his decidedly modern lust for power, to his final battle with common medical advice... it's all such a rich tapestry from which one can weave myriad tales of suspense, drama, and raw human emotion.

But Triumph isn't your typical Tippecanoe thriller. It is, if I dare say it, the quintessential expos uncovering the lies, falsehoods, deception, and lies the big studios don't want you to know. It reveals, in full frontal glory, the TRUE story of our ""shortest-lived"" president. And it does it with the help of Ed-friggin'-Asner. (At this point you should have already ordered 10 copies)

Because the corporate big-wigs aren't involved, don't expect the kind of fancy explosions or nudity you'll see in the typical WHH blockbuster (though who can forget Jessica Alba's exotic dance scene in White House Harem: The Harrison Years?). This movie is down and dirty, talking to real people* about how Willy faked his death and controlled the Western World for nearly 100 years. But more intriguing is the unintentional drama of the main reporter, Amanda. As she uncovers more and more of the story behind the official story, we see her and her film crew experience intimidation, harassment, and even pantomime. The pain endured cannot be put into words.

The bottom line is simple: If you're tired of the same-old, same-old story of WHH you've seen a thousand times, Triumph is a breath of fresh air. With great writing, a memorable cast, and 100% factual journalistic science, you can't go wrong. Just don't be surprised if black helicopters and surveillance vans start showing up once you're in the know.

*Technically, actors are real people.",1289520000,3,1905,5.038095238095238
