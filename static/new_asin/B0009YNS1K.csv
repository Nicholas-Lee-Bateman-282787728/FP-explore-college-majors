8070504,5,B0009YNS1K,"""The King of Iron Town"" is one of those ""root for the underdog"" stories that you can't help but love.  Although I felt it was a little rushed in some spots (overall, I wouldn't have minded it drawing out a lot of the shots -- the movie's engaging enough to allow itself more than 90 minutes to let it soak in), the overall package is completely impressive.  For only a $10,000 budget, Mickey Fisher and his crew have created a genuinely touching, honestly-inspired film that has something for everyone.  And unlike some other independent ultra low-budget films I've seen, this one sports truly awesome performances (it's no mistake that the cast is made of professionally recognized actors).  Every second of this movie speaks volumes, and the only real problem anyone should have with it is that it's over way too soon.  Kudos to Mr. Fisher and the rest of Leo's Pride Entertainment for a superb entry into independent cinema.",1129939200,3,927,4.80503144654088
