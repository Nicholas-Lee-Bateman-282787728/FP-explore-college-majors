5883147,5,B00E15TIAS,Nice to see some of these old TV shows finally showing up on DVD.,1407628800,,65,3.7142857142857144
5883148,5,B00E15TIAS,"The episodes in this collection are very good and fit for family viewing.  But beware, the 23 episodes in this collection by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment are identical to the episodes in ""Fury, The Lost Episodes"" , sometimes referred to as ""The Tribute Collection"".

If you have young children these episodes will surely entertain without all the bad language found in some of the ""family"" movies on the market today.

Enjoy!

5883149,5,B00E15TIAS,"Absolutely superb. I was so happy with the clarity of picture--just like watching it on a television; better even--very crisp and clear. I'd forgotten how well those episodes were done. A few might be a little corny, but all in all fabulous life lessons interwoven in each episode. No wonder I loved this show as a child. Wish TV would do things like this nowadays.",1397865600,7,365,4.630769230769231
5883150,1,B00E15TIAS,"What's really weird abt this DVD is that  there  IS an ENG 1  subtitle  button,  but the  words don't show up!!!!  I remember watching this in reruns  and I have several books of Fury.  I've loved horse shows since I was little,  and this one was my favorite.  It's a shame this DVD doesn't cater to dead people.",1392163200,2,312,4.206896551724138
8599938,5,B00E15TIAS,"Anyboby that dreamed of wanting a horse when they were a kid must have watched Fury and pretended to be joey. Doesnt matter if your a boy or girl, if you love horses you'll love Fury.",1529107200,,183,4.111111111111111

8599944,5,B00E15TIAS,"This DVD contains 17 B/W episodes of 25 minutes each. Good quality and enjoyed going back in time to my childhood and reliving these memories. Also, ordered, on line, at a separate order, ""Fury"" THE LOST EPISODES, with 23 B/W episodes. Also, good quality, but disappointed to find all, but the last 6 episodes, were the same ones on ""Fury: King of the Wild Stallions"". They didn't appear to be lost to me, as I now have only 6 episodes on these sets, that are different.. Deceived is how I feel, and disappointed to have so many repeats. ""The Lost Episodes"" doesn't appear true to me, at all.!!!!",1436745600,4,596,4.527777777777778
