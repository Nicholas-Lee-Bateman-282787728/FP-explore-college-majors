5020295,5,B006UTDF8O,"I'm deeply moved by Debbie Peagler's plight. She was someone I would like to have known. Her faith, her spirit is invincible. That lives on in this documentary. It's a frightening thing, made obvious by this case, to get caught up in the Justice System. How many more victims are there? Too many to count, no doubt. The LA District Attorney's Office acted in a shameful, lawless way. The Governor at the time, ""The Terminator,"" Arnold Schwarzenegger also failed miserably, in no way less than he did his own family. Debbie Peagler's daughters are a testament to Debbie's faith, trust and prayers to our Savior, Jesus Christ. While she walked this earth, though imprisoned, she left a legacy. I've no doubt she was received into the Arms of Jesus.. Matthew 25:21 (KJV)

5020297,5,B006UTDF8O,"Excellent documentary and a real eye opener into how the justice system can be manipulated and used to advance the desired result of a corrupt DA's office. Debbie was a beautiful soul that didn't deserve to be thrown in prison and held there unjustly for 27 years.  It's shameful how even when the DA had been enlightened about the abuse findings, knew they had engaged in corruption and were aware that she only had a short time to live, still refused do the right thing and support her release.

I was impressed by these attorneys loyalty, support, belief in their client and their aggressive perseverance. We need more dedicated people working to help others like these lawyers and private detective. Although frustrated,  they continued with the case while sometimes neglecting their familes and their daily careers; and they did it without getting paid.

There was an established pattern of abuse by the male, there was clear evidence to the state of mind which brought this unfortunate woman to do what she did. The way that she did, what was ultimately done, is what put her in jail.  I would not have wished her life or his on anyone. They actually were both tragic figures in a vicious circle. Some new domestic violence laws are now in place to help some victims but for many it is too little too late. Finally it comes...the par... With the help of the Lord and two tenacious guardian angels she was set free at last. You just have to see the film then draw your own conclusions.

5020318,5,B006UTDF8O,"Abuse is real.  There are all types of abuse from sexual to mental and it has been happening for centuries.  Debbie Peagler felt she was living a dream, she had an older man that spoiled her and gave her everything but what happens when in reality he was merely setting her up.  In Crime After Crime directed by Yoav Potash, Debbie Peagler began getting abused at a young age by her man who eventually and unknowingly became her pimp.

He begin pimping her out before she was 18 years old and she could not believe that he would betray her like that.  Eventually she became tired of the life and especially the abuse so she received some help from two gang members.  After telling the gang members about the abuse that she had been living and how she had been treated the ride began when her pimp was killed.

Crime After Crime takes you on a journey into the judicial system and it shows you how the system works and how its not always fair.  Enter two attorneys, Joshua Safran and Nadia Costa who themselves were familiar with abuse in their childhood they began setting on a quest to get Debbie release from prison after serving for over 15 years; of which she should have over served about six years for the crime.

Debbie does turn her life around but is it enough?  Joshua and Nadia uncovers new, hidden and contradicting evidence but is it enough?  Debbie is later diagnosed with lung cancer and told that she has a limited time to live.  Will she finally be released or will she be left to die in prison?

5020323,4,B006UTDF8O,"Debbie Peglear is an African American woman. She was beaten and pimped by her lover for about 5 years. Then he was killed by 2 gang members after she asked them to make him stop abusing her. At her trial, the evidence of her abuse was not allow to be presented in court. Then, she was sentenced to 25 years to life. By 2008, after 27 years, she was still in jail.

Thanks to the superb effort, perseverance and generosity of attorneys Nadia Costa and Joshua Safran, after 7 years of fighting against the justice system, Debbie was released in 2009.

This documentary has all the ingredients to make it an interesting and touching movie but I don't know why I was not touched as much as watching Dateline NBC shows. It might be because of the directing and editing.

I agree with another viewer that this film should be included in the curriculum of law schools. Furthermore, it should be watched by anybody trained in criminal justice and police academies.",1389657600,,956,4.578947368421052

5020325,3,B006UTDF8O,"As an attorney practicing law for 24 years, and as the daughter of a civil rights and criminal law attorney, this film recounts a common story which society too often chooses to ignore.  It appears to me that Deborah was released from jail by the parole board because of the publicity the case got through the Los Angeeles Times (a newspaper that does wonderful investigative reporting) and because her pro bono attorneys tenaciously represented her.  They were under tremendous pressure to release her from jail.  In addition, the ""Terminator"" could have waived the 30 day appeal period and shown some compassion for her (though apparently he had none for his wife).  There was never any adjudication that the DA's office acted improperly (of course they did, but it appears that they were disqualified because of a conflict of interest - i.e. they were subject to being sued for misconduct) and the court never made a ruling on whether the plea offer was enforceable or whether there was any credible evidence to support the case against Deborah.  This may seem like semantics but the problem with a situation like this is that it does not set a legal precedent for future cases.  The other, probably more important problem, is that DAs and prosecutors continue to engage in misconduct no matter how many times they are exposed of wrongdoing.  The attorneys seem somewhat naive to an old goat like myself who is probably jaded by decades of seeing the same thing happen over and over again.

The pro bono attorneys are also quite gracious in that they never mention that Deborah probably had inadequate representation at the trial level.  Discovery is supposed to be conducted as part of an original investigation, not 25 years after the alleged offense was committed.

To me, the best part of this story is Deborah herself who reminds me of Karla Fay Tucker.  She managed to keep her faith, do her best to raise her children through prison walls and educate others despite the hideous circumstances she endured before and after incarceration.  I am so glad that she was able to spend time with her sisters, children and grandchildren before she died.  What I also liked about her was that she truly appreciated how hard her attorneys worked, at their own expense, and thanked them at every opportunity.

I wish I was shocked by this story but sadly I think its just one of thousands of cases where injustice has occurred.",1380240000,10,2424,4.823671497584541

5020328,4,B006UTDF8O,"I was recently looking for a good movie to watch at my local library and stumbled upon this documentary. Not knowing anything more than what I read on the DVD jacket, I decided to to a chance on this. I'm glad I did.

""Crime After Crime"" (2011 release; 93 min.) brings the case of Debbie Peagler, an African-American woman convicted in 1983 of murdering her abusive boyfriend. She was sentenced to 25 years-to-life. As the movie starts, we meet two lawyers who take her case pro-bono almost 20 years later to re-examine the facts of the case. Pretty soon it is clear that Peagler was the victim of ""women battered syndrome"" and should never have been prosecuted for murder, and furthermore that the Los Angeles District Attorney's office made some horrendous mistakes and probably (likely) violated her rights as a defender by withholding evidence. When presented with those facts by the pro-bono lawyers, the DA sends a letter to the attorneys, offering to reduce the crime to voluntary manslaughter (which carries a 6 year prison term), effectively freeing Peagler when the deal is sealed. At that point we are just half-way into the movie, so what more can be told for the second half of the movie? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: this movie was shot, produced and directed over a 5+ year period by Yoav Potash and his crew, and what a labor of love and endurance it became. I must admit that during the first 45 min. of the movie, this looked to be a very ""TV-like"" 20/20 story, but the second half of the movie is just riveting and will equally enrage and move you. Kudos to the two California pro-bono lawyers who spent countless hours, days, months and years taking up Peagler's case. This movie opened at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival, and in the DVD extras we see the director and the two lawyers doing a Q&A session with the audience, which you don't want to miss. This is an important movie about an important cause, not just about Peagler but for women battered syndrome victims. ""Crime After Crime"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1363824000,12,2135,4.690666666666667

 Someone deserves a medal for getting rid of that trash as the police refused to do what they are paid to do..enforce laws and keep us SAFE..getting violent criminals off the street..Our justice system is quite backwards...They just make more stupid laws..when they can't even enforce the ones that they were created to enforce!!!!",1527465600,,930,4.917197452229299
8504758,5,B006UTDF8O,"This was bittersweet to say the least. This was the very definition of unjust incarceration. Im also a victim of abuse  was a child of the 80s. The police were at my house at least 1-3x a month for domestic violence. My sister and i were 6 and 8 and being terrorized by my mothers then husband. He abused us mentally and sexually on a cosistent basis and the violence was well documented. Not once were us kids taken aside by the police and asked 1 single question. When they did actually arrest him he wouldnt even be in jail 24 hours. My mother took me to about 3 counceling sessions for child sex abuse. The entire goal was to ""put the family back together"" and i was asked the question that would determine everyones fate including my mothers and my abuser...""are you ready for him to come back home"".I was 9. My mother chose to stay with him out of some fear and some self-serving reasons. The abuse of me and my sister (and my mother) went on for 8 more years all because the system was so broken,negligent and even criminal. Children and women are forced to bear the brunt of this life of terror at night and school in the morning. Back then and still today women are incarcerated for defending them and their childrens lives. What kind of a society has a system that caters to the monstrous acts of brutality and deviant sexual lusts of men that are so weak that they only feel empowered terrorizing women and children. We have ONE state that has this law. We all see how that worked out in this story. We've come a ways since the 80s but a ""long way""??....absolutely not.% years ago i called the police due to domestic violence. You know what they did?NOTHING.While i was filling out paperwork the police were looking all through my drawers and on my tables as i was the criminal and after waiting for a total of an hour the cop said to me""well.me and the other officer are the ones that are supposed to find him so we should get going""...all the while im getting bombarded with threatening texts of what will happen if i press charges and showing the cops this in real time. There was about 6 ppl that they spoke to that witnessed (that i didn't know) the attack as well. Right then and there i stopped the crime tech before he snapped a photo and tore up my report and told the cops to forget it im scared to press charges ( the violence and being threatened by text knowing the cops are with me).I knew i had no choice to deal with it myself and THAT is REALITY.Im a white female. I grew up and live in a working class community in south Florida.is a female thing not a race or class thing. We live in the USA and this country advocates whether by victim blaming or being negligent,the exploitation and beating of children (espec. girls) and women. Period. We have President P---y Grabber  voted into the highest office by citizens so what hope is there for the rest of us.

I still suffer from everything he did to us and it has been 50 years. Abuse never leaves you. It effects every area of your life.
