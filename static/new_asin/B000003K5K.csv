7902573,4,B000003K5K,"Geordi is the test user of a new interface system that allows him to operate a probe remotely and immerse himself in its virtual environment. The Enterprise is sent to investigate the disappearance of a scientific research vessel, the Ramaan, and finds it deep in the atmosphere of a gas giant. Geordi takes the probe into the Ramaan to learn what happened. Everything is proceeding according to plan, until Geordi sees the image of his mother. Her ship recently vanished without a trace and everyone else has given her up for dead. So why has she now appeared on the Ramaan asking for Geordi's help? Is his mother really there? Are Geordi's grief and guilt making him hallucinate? Or is there something else going on?
Levar Burton does a really good job in this episode. He conveys Geordi's growing obsession with his mother's disappearance and his determination to rescue her no matter the consequences very well. It's a pity the character of Geordi was so regularly underused; we learn more about him and his family in this episode than in perhaps any other. The idea of the interface and all its possibilities, plus the eventual denoument of the situation with the Ramaan, are really interesting ideas. This episode has both strong science fiction and good drama to it. Watch out for the scene where Riker talks of his own grief over his mother's death.",1028505600,,1357,4.803418803418803
