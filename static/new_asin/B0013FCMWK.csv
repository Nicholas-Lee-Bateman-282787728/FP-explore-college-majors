8250605,5,B0013FCMWK,"This is the best documentary (or more appropriately, a seminar) on Lake Malawi's Cichlid fish yet! Ad Konings provides great filming with exceptional information on the evolutionary wonders and science behind Lake Malawi's cichlid diversity and specifically their unique feeding behaviors.

If you liked Ad Konings' other material, or just want to know more Lake Malawi's Cichlid bio-diversity and how all those fish evolved to develop unique feeding behaviors than look no further!",1287100800,2,482,5.602739726027397
8250606,2,B0013FCMWK,"I wanted to learn more about African Cichlids, I'm enjoying the hobby of keeping them. This DVD is scientific but for the most part unadaptable to keeping them in an Aquarium. The cinematography is great at times. The DVD has helped me understand Cichlids in there natural habitat a little better, more so what/how to feed them. The narration is unbearable. The case and menu needs updated to suite 2010.",1286841600,2,404,4.785714285714286
