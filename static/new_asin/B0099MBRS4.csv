It is about life, and it shows how people evolve over time. I identified with one of the people being interviewed, as well as my sister. This is one of the best documentaries I have seen in a long time. I purchased both the 49 Up and 56 Up. I have let my high school classmates borrow the DVD since we do a reunion every five years. They loved it as well. My only disappointment was that purchasing the DVD there was no option for captions. I was surprised they left out the captions. I could understand most of what was said, but some of the accents were hard to follow.
Also to note this DVD is in PAL format, and not NTSC. PAL is the DVD format used by the UK. Make sure your DVD player will play PAL. In this day and age that should not be an issue. My Mac popped up with an error that I could only change my region four times, and then could not change it anymore. if you are watching this on a DVD player this should not be an issue.",1369353600,4,1079,4.0

5294046,5,B0099MBRS4,"As I watched this newest in the series of "".... Up"" films, I asked myself, ""Has it really been 28 years since I saw the first in this series of feature films released in the US?"". Yes, I guess it has been, but time passes quickly.

I'll provide a bit of background on the film, but since my fellow Amazon reviewer, K. Gordon  has done a fine job, I will try not to repeat his comments.  His review is of the UK DVD version, which will not play on US DVD players. But Amazon always groups reviews of ALL formats of a film - and even combines remastered versions of films with the originals when it lists reviews.
The ""Up"" series began in Britain as a one of the first reality shows (before they were called that) in 1964 as ""7 up"". The first film was directed by Paul Almond, but all subsequent ones (every seven years) have been done by Michael Apted (who was on the crew of the first one.). Though there was a film for years 7, 14, and 21, the first feature to hit the US movie screens was ""28 up"". The original lot of seven-year-old kids consisted of 20 - from various class systems in Britain. Every, subsequent ""episode"" features roughly 15 of of them. Some drop off and then come back. This time around we see Peter, who dropped out after ""28 Up"" but is back - basically to promote his rock band - the Good Intentions"". In fact quite a few of those in this episode talk about how the series as often infringed on their privacy. (More so than I remember in the past.).

The film is long at nearly 2  hours, but that's partly because Apted uses clips from the previous seven films to make it easier for those catching up. But, honestly, the best way to see this series is from the beginning (well, from ""28 up"" onward. These are all available from First Run Features on DVD.
I really enjoyed watching this and can highly recommend it. It should be out on DVD in a few months (again, from First Run Features) and- since Apted is now 72 years old, we can only hope that there will be a ""63 Up"" and more.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5294047,5,B0099MBRS4,"Personally, I would strongly suggest watching the films in order. While ""56 Up"" does provide some recaps,
the cumulative effect of the series is built by watching each age in depth.

The 'Up Series' represents one of the most fascinating and unusual uses of film in cinema history - a
documentary life-long chronicle of the lives of 14 people starting at 7 years old, revisiting them every
seven years through age 56 (so far). While I could quibble, wishing for a bit more depth here and there
(especially with the women, where there's a bit too much emphasis on love and marriage at the expense
of all else), and by nature the later episodes sometimes have to speed through more than would be ideal,
since they have to both catch the audience back up as well as moving the stories forward, no matter. It's
really an astounding, moving, frightening and uplifting document. There's no way to watch this
remarkable series of films without reflecting deeply on one's own life, and how you have changed (and
stayed the same) over your own lifetime.

While Michael Aped deserves every bit of credit he's received for this amazing piece of cultural anthropology,
it's important to note the first film, 7 Up, was actually directed by Paul Almond, and Apted was a
that point a researcher for the project.

This new episode is as excellent as it's predecessors, revealing more surprising twists in turns as our
group heads towards the end of mid-life, and stare into the realities of old age.  Some old
friends re-appear, some have continued in directions they had been going in, and some have
changed course yet again.  One thing that's interesting, and more present in this episode than earlier ones
are some of the subjects questioning the objectivity and 'reality' of the series.  There are interesting
cases made that what we, the audience, sees isn't the truth of who these people are, but only
a created character.  It also (by proxy) makes one reflect on how much being in these films has
affected the lives of the participants.  Just as in physics, it seems to be true here as well, that the very
act of being observed changes what is being observed.

All fascinating and thought-provoking stuff.",1359417600,50,2196,4.788359788359788

5294069,5,B0099MBRS4,"The Up Series is a documentary that follows the lives of fourteen British children. The series began in 1964 with a group of seven-years-old and checks in every seven years. At age 56, the participants are dealing with divorce, health challenges, grandchildren, job changes and re-marriage.

I learned of this series from an elementary school friend on Facebook. His age (55) and lifes journey exactly paralleled on of the shows participants.

I found 56 Up to be very compelling, but cant say exactly why. I could certain relate to the journey of the participants and liked following the transitions in their lives. It was also fun seeing the changes in fashion and the progress of film technology.",1436227200,,699,4.965811965811966

5294088,5,B0099MBRS4,"If there is a comparable cinematic document in existence that chronicles the lives of individuals the way The UP Series does, Im hard-pressed to think of it. No doubt there are imitators. A South African version is currently sitting at 21 UP, apparently. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.

While The UP Series is unique, even more astounding is the fact that each film is a stand alone work of art in its own right. For our purposes, we will focus on 56 UP, the latest installment in the series.

Roger Ebert, whose half hour, in-depth and intelligent interview with director Michael Apted is included in this DVD release, comes very close to articulating why this film (and the series) is so important. He states the series is an inspired, almost noble use of the film medium. If we define the word noble as something which is admirable in dignity of conception, manner of expression, execution or composition, then Ebert has hit the nail on the head.

Virtually every invention in the history of the world has come to be as something to make life better, to make existence more meaningful, more pleasurable, more practical. Film is no exception. Like any great art form, film exists, ideally, to ennoble as well as to educate or entertain. Great art distinguishes mankind from the creatures around him. A reminder of the sacred act of creation (and, by extension, many would argue, cause for rumination on God), art is a gift mankind too often cheapens and undervalues, especially in the name of commerce and quick thrills. Witness any of the latest summer blockbusters in the local Cineplex.

56 UP pulls us back into an awareness of art as the great provoker of thought, reflection, dialogue and understanding. The simplicity of the concept is astounding. Who wouldve had the thought to undertake such an experiment (for that is surely what it was, originally)? Who couldve envisaged how a one-off film could inspire a series, a representational chronicle of lives, free from political correctnessarguably one of the key elements of its success?

Many artists spend their whole lives in the pursuit of simplicity and director Apted, whether knowingly or not, has defined the template for documentary filmmaking. Just tell the story in the words of the participants. Dont comment. Show, don't tell.

Apteds great body of work extends far beyond the documentary genre. My favourite film of his is Amazing Grace, which portrays the life of William Wilberforce, who was predominantly responsible for the abolishment of slavery in the United Kingdom.

There is a kind of amazing grace that permeates 56 UP. It is the grace which is defined as beauty of form, manner, motion, or action. The film is all of those things in its seamless representation of life. It is also a profound testimony to another definition of grace, namely, forgiveness. For to view the subjects under Apteds filmic microscope is to witness humanity in breathtaking variationand simplicityfull of hopes and dreams, success and failure, love and indifference, struggle and enjoyment.

The genius of 56 UP is life itself. Documentary filmmaking doesnt get better than this.",1397433600,3,3153,5.0038167938931295
5294089,3,B0099MBRS4,"I have been watching this series since the production of 28Up. Many of the subjects in this new installment appear cagey and cautious.

5294091,5,B0099MBRS4,"I have been a fan of the ""7 Up"" series since ""35 Up."" Other than your own family and close friends, where do you get a chance to follow a group of people from elementary school into retirement, hearing about their lives and dreams? Amazing to see the young boy living ""in care"" (a glorified orphanage) wishing for a family, then to see him in adulthood with his own brood of kids. Or the young man who claims year after year that he plans to have a family someday until we give up on him -- then at 49 he marries and has kids. This documentary follows a group of British kids from a variety of SES levels, interviewing them every 7 years. Each documentary integrates material from those before it, very skillfully. I teach developmental psychology and use this is my classes. One bit of advice for U.S. viewers, use the subtitles -- there are a lot of different British accents and it helps a lot to see the captions.",1394150400,5,917,4.368421052631579

5294096,5,B0099MBRS4,"I watched 56Up last week on my public television station here in Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN, USA. I own the entire series, and have 'grown up' with it, watching it every seven years or so. First of all, I will admit that it is very hard for me to be overly critical of this series, simply because it is such a remarkable achievement. Nothing like it has ever been done. Furthermore, I have literally grown up with these British children/teens/young people....and now....they, like me, are in the latter stages of middle age, soon to become 'geezers'! In addition, I have always been fascinated by British life, history, music, movies and TV, literature and sport, and I devour everything I can get my hands on. Finally, I am a fan of the work of Michael Apted, who's directed every episode except the first, 7Up, from 1964 (he was a production assistant on that first film). He is without a doubt the greatest 'unknown' filmmaker who ever lived.

Apted has worked for decades in British television and film, and has made many American films as well, including some greats (Coal Miner's Daughter (1980), Gorky Park ('83), Gorillas in the Mist ('88), Thunderheart ('92), some near-great (Continental Divide ('81), Class Action ('91), (Blink ('94), Nell ('96), Always Outnumbered ('98), Enigma ('01), Amazing Grace ('06), Chronicles of Narnia ('10), Chasing Mavericks (with Curtis Hanson, '12), and others. He even directed a James Bond blockbuster, The World is Not Enough ('99). In all of his 'Hollywood' films and other studio films done with 'name' actors, you can bet that you will be moved, enlightened and challenged by the characters and the situations. But even if he had not done any of those movies, I would still have great appreciation for him because of his wonderful documentary work....even apart from the groundbreaking ""Up"" series. One could showcase a genuinely fascinating, informative and entertaining Michael Apted Documentary Film Festival, which, besides ""Up"", would include films such as:

-The Long Way Home ('89): saving children during the Holocaust and helping them reunite with family and friends);
-Bring On the Night ('85): music film starring Sting, who is much, much more than a mere pop star;
-Incident at Oglala ('92): incidents surrounding the conviction of Lakota tribal leader Leonard Peltier for the shooting deaths of two FBI agents at Pine Ridge, SD;
-Moving the Mountain ('94): looks at the efforts and struggles of several young Chinese students living in an oppressive regime;
-Inspirations ('97): tries to unlock the creative spark of seven visual and performance artists;
-Me and Isaac Newton ('98): examines the ground-breaking work of seven scientists;
-Married in America (first episode in '03, second in '06, ongoing): follows seven (Apted's lucky # must be 7!) couples in their married life;
-The Power of the Game ('07): the powerful influence of soccer around the globe;

Just this year he directed an episode of a great new TV series called Ray Donovan, starring Liev Schreiber, Jon Voight and Eddie Marsan. This is a terrific series about a 'fixer'--who happens to be a faithful husband and father--in LA who helps the rich and famous extricate themselves from some very nasty and sticky situations.

Apted was born in 1941, which makes him 72, and he is still going strong. You can guess his political and philosophical leanings by looking at the subjects of his films. That is another reason I admire the man: he has a heart for the those who struggle against the odds, for those who buck the system, those who question authority. Many would probably consider him a bleeding-heart liberal. He would probably embrace the term.

But back to 56Up: it's a great addition to the series. During each installment you would have to deal with a certain amount of exposition and repetition, to 'fill in' those who have not seen previous episodes, and this in itself is an art. Though it adds length to the current film, it's welcome, because even for those like myself, who've seen the entire series and are familiar with the characters, it helps to get caught up with some of the film friends you've not seen for seven years.

This is the kind of show which has always generated interesting and probably, endless discussions and debates regarding class and race and the differences between growing up in England vs. the US. It really is the first ongoing reality TV show, isn't it? There is now, and has always been, huge publicity and notoriety regarding the 'stars' of the series, and you could certainly understand why these normal folks would want to opt out at some point.

In 56Up, we get the chance to once again see Peter, who dropped out of the project at the age of 28, and now has reappeared. Peter was a teacher in 1992 and, in 28Up, voiced some mild criticism of the at-the-time Thatcher government. Because the film was so widely-seen, Peter's comments were trumpeted forth by the British press. The Tory papers ripped him apart and he became concerned about his ability to earn a living. Now he is back, as a musician, and is the leader of his own acoustic folk group. A cynic might say that he's timed his reappearance to help pump sales of his records, but so what? All of these people have been, in a sense, 'used', haven't they? They've paid a price to be in this show. Why not turn the tables a bit and use the notoriety you've gained for your own benefit?

Symon was/is the only mixed race person in the series. In 1964 he and Paul--who eventually emigrated to Australia--were the only kids 'in care', meaning, foster care. Their humble beginnings certainly influenced the rest of their lives. Symon drives a forklift in a warehouse, has a bunch of kids from several wives, and is married to an educated woman who works with underprivileged kids. At one point Symon's wife ruefully says that Symon has plenty of brains and is severely underemployed. But he comes right out and says, ""I could have done much better but I was a lazy sod"", a comment which conservative viewers will surely point to and say, ""See, it's his own bloody fault!"". But Symon seems happy and is enjoying his life. Paul has spent most of his life in Australia and is still happily married to the bride of his youth.

Back in '64, we had the amazing and incredible spectacle of three 7-yr. old British boys, clad in the traditional upper-class, public school garb of coat, tie, shorts and knee socks, announcing that, for fun, their reading consisted of The Financial Times, The London Observer, and so on. Two of the lads, John and Andrew--remember, these are 7-yr. olds--proclaim precisely in their posh accents, which schools they would attend, all the way up through university, and which line of work they would pursue! Their futures had all been planned out for them by their parents, which, in itself, has to be one of the biggest distinctions between the upper classes and the lower classes, perhaps even between the British upper classes and the American upper classes (I don't know, I'm not in the upper class!). What is even more amazing is that John and Andrew followed their parents' plans to the letter, and accomplished exactly what they said they would. Both went into law and did very, very well for themselves.

Thinking back to the kids as 7-yr. olds, and listening to them speak, we found it all very cute and irresistible, with those British accents. But their speech was very telling as to how their futures would turn out. Those with the heavy Cockney accents did not go on to upper education; those with the ""King's English"" did....and their adult lives largely turned out the way you'd have thought.

It's so easy to hate on the rich, but in this case, when we see that John and Andrew have grown up into kindly, responsible, married men,  you can't help but think well of them. However, there is a bit of a sticky moment when John, who has done much charitable work with the poor in Bulgaria, and perhaps feeling the sting of criticism for his aristocratic speech and social position, dares to delve into the very touchy subject of class and privilege. He protests that there really is not a class system anymore in England, and states that he did not come from money, that his mother had to work to support the family, and so on. But in the next scene, a flashback to 14Up, John and his classmates, clad in the traditional British hunting tweeds of the wealthy landed gentry, are shown assembling for a fox hunt. Is there a more inflammatory subject epitomizing the gulf between the English classes as foxhunting? I doubt it. Apted almost seemed to be hitting us over the head with the irony at this point. The idea of most of the other kids going foxhunting is preposterous.

The three Cockney, East End girls (Jackie, Lynn and Suzanne) are shown at length. Suzanne, even though she does not have a university education and still speaks in the 'Bow Bells' dialect, manages a law school at a London university. Lynn has lost her job (working with physically-challenged children) due to cuts--current PM David Cameron is seen by the working classes as being cut from the same cloth as ""TBW"" (That Bloody Woman...Thatcher), and neither Lynn nor Jackie are in the best of health, but again, due to cuts, Jackie has to find work, even though she has rheumatoid arthritis and is a single grandmother caring for kids. Tony, the East End lad who once had aspired to be a jockey, became a cabbie in London, is still married to the same woman, and has a vacation home in Spain. He is very critical about those on welfare, and would be the equivalent of a blue-collar conservative here in the US. Neil was once homeless, and has had mental health issues. He's been involved in politics at the city and county level, and now ekes out a living as a church assistant. Though it is not mentioned in 56Up, Neil was helped by the kind-hearted Bruce, who, despite a wonderful education, chose to become a teacher in inner-city schools, a far cry from the upper class life he could have had. A cynic might ask the question: would Bruce have chosen the life of privilege if he had not been on the series? Did he take the more selfless road because he somehow wanted our approval, and would have been embarrassed and ashamed of making more self-serving or materialistic choices? I would say that he is truly a good man with a charitable spirit, and his participation in the series has not influenced his career path at all. But that is based only on the telling glimpses into Bruce's life.

Suzy married ""well"" (meaning: she has never had to work outside the home), and lives a life of comparative leisure at a country estate. Oh, there is a lot of work in gardening and manicuring the lawn and trimming the hedges and keeping the country place up to snuff, but it's really all recreational, isn't it? She doesn't really 'have to' do any of it at all. The husband brings in the money, and plenty of it. The same holds true for the wife of Andrew. Does that sound harsh and critical? It is not my intention. Suzy seems to be a very nice and warm person, with a good marriage, with two nice sons. But you see the irony and the vast difference between her life and the lives of the three East End women, who all truly have to work, just to survive, who understand this, and who want jobs, but two of the three can't find jobs!

One of the criticisms of the series by some of its own participants is that we only see brief glimpses of these lives, and only every seven years, so how accurate and complete a picture do we really get? Don't some of the participants 'come off' looking or sounding unfavorable? We are all sensitive of the impression we make. Even Nick, from a farm in the Yorkshire dales, who became--of all things--a nuclear physicist, and who left England to teach at UW-Madison, expresses chagrin at how he must look. But Nick is without doubt the person in the show who disproves the intractability of the English class system.

Based upon the lives of the thirteen people currently participating in the series--I believe that the original number was twenty--we can make some observations on class, and I believe that these thoughts would hold true for Americans as well. It's hardly surprising. If your parents have college educations and advanced degrees, you are much more likely to achieve the same. If your parents earn plenty of money, and you don't completely screw things up, you will be much more likely to have plenty of money as well. And make no mistake: having money is better than not having money, at least, if you want to have choices regarding work, leisure, travel, material comforts, etc.. The rich can make choices and can determine the way their lives turn out; they have fashioned a degree of control over things. As with John and Andrew, they can plan for a specific future, and achieve it. The poor have fewer choices. In many cases, they are victims, which, of course, is a concept with which conservatives violently disgree. Conservatives tend to blame the poor for being poor, which, to me, is a dangerous oversimplification.

The series is supposed to continue. It will be very interesting to see, as old age approaches, with the accompanying inevitable health issues, how the different folks handle things. In the US, it's a fact that the more money you have, the better health care you receive and the longer you live. Is it true in England as well? No doubt we will get a closer look into the British health care system. They have the National Health, open to all, correct? So does that mean that if both John and Symon have heart attacks and are hospitalized, will they both have access to the same degree of care? Something tells me no. As I said, a subject for endless discussion, and eager anticipation.",1382313600,9,13795,4.724553385957623
5294097,4,B0099MBRS4,"To make the points that the filmmaker wishes to make, 56 UP uses a great deal of past previously seen footage.  Also the order of appearances is not organized probably because the storytelling is more important.

BUT all the worries and drawbacks in the lives of the less successful participants especially Neil and Tony highlight the difference between the English and the Germans and unfortunately for the Eastenders and Neil, that is more important than a few more barristers in England.  The English may dislike what has happened to their country but they haven't turned to murderous hate.

The Eastenders are declaring the same problem in England as is happening in America - there are people on Welfare, being heavily subsidized who should not be.  The original UP series participants have lies very different from what is represented in entertainment.  Life just wears you down and not everyone has natural buoyancy.

Being kind to children changes the world not just the future of the children.

5294109,5,B0099MBRS4,"Unlike the fake ""reality"" shows on TV, this is actual reality.  People are viewed at 7 year intervals throughout their lives.  As someone of a similar age to these folks, it was rather emotional.  As with most of them, you do come to realize things that you will not achieve by this stage, and it can be a bit depressing.
I actually had to stop watching partway through because it was a downer.  Most of the first few stories were pathetic losers, all divorced, many not working, most whining that they could not yet retire and that the government had cut pensions(which was done because so many folks in Britain were retiring so early on so big a pension that there were not enough folks working in the private sector to support them, not realizing that if the country goes bankrupt they would get nothing.  For God's sake, these folks are 56, not 65 or 70!!!)
  I am glad I came back because many of the folks later on the DVD were actually successful, even if they had regrets and unfulfilled dreams.  Most of these folks had worked hard and still worked hard.  Some may have been a bit more upper crust, but the show ended well with the story of a London cabby, hard working, successful and appropriately contemptuous of all the bums out there living on the dole and bankrupting society while folks like him are scrabbling to make a living.  Truly this is the story of us all and, to some extent, a society in decline.",1377561600,4,1422,4.455598455598456
5294110,4,B0099MBRS4,"I had heard about, but had never viewed the on-going filming of the 14 people who agreed to be followed every seven years by the British TV. I found this film '56 and Up', fascinating, moving and a terrific view of life as it unfolds.

In 1964, British TV produced a film titled ""7 Up,"" and focused on the lives of 14 children. They sorted the participants into upper and working classes. Every seven years, the series has filmed many of the 14 who agreed to participate. This is the eighth film, ""56 Up."" The 14 participants are still alive. Some of the people grew close during the years, although some of the participants considered this documentary a mixed blessing.

In the U.K., their faces are well known. We get to see them up close and personal. Their stories are all heart felt, filled with their joys and sadness. We see bits and pieces of their lives, every seven years, as they grow from childhood to adults. Most of the participants have happy lives, ups and downs. One participant, Neil, looks to be the most troubled. He had a seemingly happy childhood, but as he grew, something was wrong. He looked to be depressed, without goals, and was homeless at one time. He is now a local politician and is a canon in his Anglican Church. So, his life is OK, but he does not seem happy with his lot.

We see a scientist at the University of Wisconsin and a man who dropped out of the series and isnow back, to promote his band. A woman without a college education, is now a head of the law college.

'56 and Up', it a terrific film. It is like visiting with old classmates you lost touch with.

The ""Up"" documentary series comprises what is surely the most impressive longitudinal study ever committed to film. It is an obvious labor of love for director Michael Apted, who has remained faithful to the project - and to its participants - for close to fifty years now.

It all began in 1964, when producers at Britain's Granada Television gathered together a group of seven-year-olds from all walks of life and interviewed them for a TV documentary entitled ""7Up,"" focused on the hopes and aspirations of these youngsters as they embarked on a long but uncertain journey into the future. Every seven years since, like clockwork, Apted has gone back to these individuals to take a peek into their lives, examining the paths they've taken and juxtaposing those youthful aspirations expressed in the original film with the realities of their lives as they've played themselves out. (The stunning contrast between the grainy black-and-white imagery of the first film and the hi- def clarity of the current interviews underlines the extraordinary length of time the series has already covered).

In ""56Up,"" the eighth installment in the series, its subjects are leaving the confidence and security and general good health of middle age and just beginning to confront the realities of impending old age and contemplating an array of end-of-life issues (if not for themselves yet, at least for their parents). And it is for this reason that ""56Up"" is one of the most poignant and insightful entries in the series (and one imagines it will only get more poignant and insightful with each successive edition). All the major issues of marriage/divorce, career and parenthood seem to have long ago been settled for most of them, as they now concentrate on their roles as grandparents and life guides for their own adult children as they embark on their own lives and families. There's less nave hope expressed in this film and more of an acceptance of how life has turned out for the participants, though there is a marked lack of cynicism and pessimism in the way they speak about their lives. Of course, they're still young enough at this point to be physically active and fully engaged in their careers and their communities, but there's no denying that the prospect of that fast- approaching downward slope of life is weighing, at least to some degree, on these people's minds. Yet, even those who haven't yet achieved their ""ideal"" lives still haven't given up hope that they will one day find what it is they're looking for. For obvious reasons, it is this installment that most comprehensively captures the range of a lifetime, at least until ""63Up,"" ""70Up,"" etc., arrive on the scene in the lead-up to the foreordained conclusion of the series.

It's clear from watching this jumble of clips from eight distinct periods of time that each stage of life contains a set of joys and concerns unique unto itself, a universal truth that this series, by its very nature, seems singularly equipped to illustrate. It's a bit like thumbing through - an admittedly disorganized - family photo album, but with insightful commentary from the individuals involved inserted along the way.

One, perhaps unforeseen, thread that runs through this film involves the self-reflection on the part of some of the participants about their appearance in the series - the sometimes unwelcome notoriety it has brought to them and their lives, with at least one of them pulling out of the project for a time only to reconnect with it at this stage, after having come to terms with himself and grown confident in his own skin. A few even question the very value of the series itself, feeling that these brief glimpses into their lives every seven years fail to create anything close to a true portrait of their lives and of themselves as people - a concern that Apted deserves much credit for including in his final product. After all, these people, at seven years of age, did not exactly ask to become a part of this much-viewed series, and why SHOULD they want to be defined and represented by it? On the other hand, as one of the participants points out, the series really isn't about these particular individuals as much as it is about how, collectively, they serve as a sort of mirror in which the rest of us can see our own lives reflected.

Yet, something indefinable and intangible keeps many of them coming back every seven years to open up and share at least a small part of their lives with us. And for that the world shall be eternally grateful. Now onto the next installment.",1374278400,,4571,4.846350832266325
5294113,3,B0099MBRS4,"First Run Features did a great job in the transfer of 56 Up except for the audio. I heard a minor, random snapping sound on my copy in the complete Up Series edition so I ordered the 56 Up single disc version which is a different run and has different art on the disc. The replacement also had the same sound over the entire film. Someone told me they also heard the popping sound on their disc that they rented from Netflicks. I didn't see 56 Up in the theaters but I'm thinking the snapping might have been on the original soundtrack. If you notice the problem on your copy I figured out that the snapping sound is only on the left side so if you move all the sound to the right side speakers, the snapping sound entirely goes away. Overall, because of the minor problems I give 56 Up by itself 3 stars. I would say this should not stop anyone from watching/buying 56 Up, I still highly recommend the complete series.

The 7 Up series is a fascinating study of human nature. My favorite episode is 21 Up because they really start to make good use of close ups and we begin to go deeper into their young adult lives. Suzy and Neil are the most fascinating to me and those two alone could have held my attention for the entire series. If you have never seen any of the episodes, you should consider watching them with some time in between each one. I would suggest watching one a week over 8 weeks and when doing so, think about how those who have been fans of these time capsules since the mid sixties have had to wait 7 years in between each new episode. The more time you have between each one, the more powerful they become.

I would say that the 7 Up Series is one of the 10 all-time best dvd sets to ever be produced and is a must own for anyone who has a serious home video library. I can't see how anyone would go wrong in buying the complete set for $37.99 offered by Amazon, that's only $4.75 per episode. When this goes out of print (and it will go oop) the price of this set will skyrocket like it has in the past. So stop thinking about it and buy it. You will be glad you did. And if you can afford it, please buy an extra copy for you local library, school or a friend.",1373846400,,2184,4.136470588235294

You know what this reminds me of ?

A sample of a series..

Something that could easily be sent out,cheaper too.
Well,I don't like it. After all these sets I have put together they give me this ????

I just opened it tonight. I thought the cardboard set up it came in was just a sampler,and I never read ahead
on any series,so I just threw it in the drawer. Then I realized,I was not getting my dvd. As soon as I got here tonight,
I recognized the same thing I threw in the drawer.

Darn it..it just doesn't fit well with my series,both VHS and DVD.

There is always something to gum up our treasures.. this series means a lot to me. I was in high school when this started.
I am now 65 !!  Ok,a comment about the series.
I am not a fan of going back in time and using it as a filler. That's all I will say about that.

But the set is memerizing. If you out there haven't seen the series..it is mind boggling to me that I remember everything
about that evening when this first came on. I was hooked immediately. My big black and white screen filled with those little faces,
and that accent they talked with. Little did I know that that sophmore would still be watching at 65. Not only do you look forward to
it,but it's almost like it's a distant relative or something. I'll stop before you think I am crazy.",1373587200,,1352,4.11787072243346
5294115,3,B0099MBRS4,"I have followed this group of Britons since 35-up. Unfortunately, this installment is oddly uncompelling because after a while the questions and format (relationships, work, the class system,etc) become increasingly predictable. Also, the subjects have mellowed in middle-age, and life for most of them revolves family, work, and the odd trip. The viewer is left longing for something other than two people clipping plants.

The director doesn't probe his subjects. How does Tony afford to own two homes when business is bad at home? One of the subjects, Nick, is so reticent that to this day I don't know whether is problem is pyschological or medical. Also, it is obvious that another of the subjects came back to the show to promote his folk group, Good Intentions, rather than give us any real insights into his life.",1373328000,,821,4.992700729927007
