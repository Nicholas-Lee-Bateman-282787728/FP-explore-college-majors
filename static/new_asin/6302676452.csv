494023,5,6302676452,Loved the movies by Wild Bill Elliott. He is a good actor!,1420675200,,58,3.9166666666666665
494024,5,6302676452,"I grew up with Wild Bill, especially as Red Rider. The only Red Rider on amazon that I have found is with Rocky Lane, not as good as Wild Bill. I will recommend this movie to anyone that  grew up in the late 40's and early 50's. It is a little hookey in today's environment but that is why I liked it.",1412208000,,301,3.8548387096774195
494025,3,6302676452,"this is not one of his best but it is still  avery good wild bill movie, him and gabby hayes work real good toghter",1406678400,,115,3.7916666666666665
494026,3,6302676452,Ok movie.  Bill was older when he made it but still good picture.,1405641600,,65,4.0
494027,3,6302676452,"While the assorted movies are a welcome addition to the Wild Bill Elliott collection, the quality of the prints was less than I expected.",1399075200,,137,4.75
494028,5,6302676452,"With the technology that they had back in these days 30's thru early 40's they done a very good job. By today's standards this movie and hundreds like it made during the same era would not be considered a very high quality production but like I mentioned it was state of the art for the time.

Wild Bill Elliott's looks were not the best. To put it mildly he just wasn't the most handsome cowboy actor in the movies during this period but what he lacked in looks his honest approach to his acting style worked overtime for him.

In conclusion if you enjoy old westerns from this era and honest acting as well as black and white cowboy movies try this movie you are sure to enjoy it!",1393632000,,682,4.27906976744186
494029,5,6302676452,Anything Wild Bill is in is super and top rated for me.  He is such a great actor and I love the old westerns.  Guess I am just old myself but this is one of those that even my teenage grandsons have enjoyed with us.  Good time movie.,1358121600,4,234,3.8333333333333335
494030,5,6302676452,"Republic Pictures present ""CALLING WILD BILL ELLIOTT"" (1943) (55 mins/B&W) (Dolby digitally remastered) --- relive those thrilling days when Wild Bill Elliott took us down the dusty trails with hard riding and straight shooting hitting the bull's eye with excitement every time ... the Wild Bill Elliott series of B-Westerns were a staple of Saturday matinees in the 1930s and 1940s ...  Wild Bill fans know one of his trademarks was wearing his pistols backwards butts front in his holsters, when he drew he would draw in the normal way flipping the guns around with a twist of his wrist, this was different from other B-Western heroes of that day ... don't miss any of the Wild Bill Elliott features loaded with action that will leave you wanting more of his B-Western adventures.

Under Spencer Gordon Bennet (Director), Harry Grey (Producer), Anthony Coldeway  - Screenwriter), Luci Ward (Short Story Author), Ernest W. Miller (Cinematographer), Mort Glickman (Original Music) ------ the cast includes Bill Elliott (Wild Bill Elliott), George Francis Hayes (Gabby Hayes), Anne Jeffreys (Edith Richards), Herbert Heyes (Governor Nichols), Robert 'Buzz' Henry (John Culver Jr), Fred Kohler Jr. (John Culver), Roy Barcroft (Captain Carson), Eve March (Mary Culver), Burr Caruth (Grandpa Culver), Bud Geary (Dean), Lynton Brent (Ranch hand) ------ our hero Wild Bill Elliott moved from Columbia Pictures to Republic where he received bigger parts and better scripts, teamed with George Gabby Hayes and Anne Jeffreys in a series of eight films ... the plot line has our hero Wild Bill Elliott going up against a ruthless Governor Herbert Heyes who has the ranchers land in his sight ... Gabby Hayes keeps bragging about how he and Wild Bill cleaned up every town west of the pecos, even though he's never met Wild Bill before ... when Wild Bill shows up, Gabby doesn't know him until Wild Bill gets the point and puts his arm around Gabby as if the two were old saddle mates ... the beautiful Anne Jeffreys is the heroine, with veteran badmens Roy Barcroft, Fred Kohler Jr. and Bud Geary bringing in all the evil this Republic Picture could muster ... some dark scenes for a B-Western when the villain tries to burn a youth with his cigarette ... wonderful supporting cast of veterans players as Gabby brags, ""Why I was so close to Wild Bill that we wore the same hat."" ---- they just don't make 'em like this anymore and Republic Pictures was one of the leaders of exciting B-Westerns and Serials.

* The eight films featuring Wild Bill Elliott, George Gabby Hayes and Anne Jeffreys are as follows:
1. CALLING WILD BILL ELLIOTT (4/20/43)
2. THE MAN FROM THUNDER RIVER (6/11/43)
3. BORDERTOWN GUN FIGHTERS (7/8/43)
4. WAGON TRACKS WEST (8/19/43)
5. DEATH VALLEY MANHUNT (9/25/43)
6. OVERLAND MAIL ROBBERY (11/20/43)
7. MOJAVE FIREBRAND (3/19/44)
8. HIDDEN VALLEY OUTLAWS (4/2/44)

Special Footnote, there is no doubt in anyone's mind that Gordon Nance from Pattonsburg, Mo, later known at William ""Wild Bill"" Elliott (the Peaceable Man) was the best Red Ryder on the big screen ... also the latest Bobby J. Copeland's book on ""Bill Elliott:The Peaceable Man"" is chuck full of answers to all the questions his fans had from early on...plenty of thrills, adventure and loaded with action. My personal favorites were the ""Red Ryder Series"" or ""The Great Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok"" an ongoing character that would appear in many films to come...as Hickok and Wild Bill Saunders. Elliott was a natural for the western, his riding abilities and fight scenes were the caliber of Buck Jones, Johnny Mack Brown and Bob Steele...good reading for all you wranglers out there...I found myself being transported back in time, Mr. Copeland's book has opened my eyes to what a wonderful unselfish person Bill Elliott was...only wish I could have met him. He was one of a kind...a peaceable man!...published by Empire Publising and available on Amazon and Empire Publications Inc ... it's no small wonder that William Elliott's name was at the top of the list, working with the top directors of the day Howard P. Bretherton, Spencer Gordon Bennett, Joseph Kane, Wallace A. Grissell, Leslie Selander and R.G. Springsteen all under Republic Pictures banner.

Second special footnote, veteran actor George ""Gabby"" Hayes...was a steady favorite as a hitchrack, was chosen five years in succession as one of the 10 best money-making Western sidekick stars...like most western comics, had his share of narrow escapes being thrown from his horse, burned by blanks...but that was all in a days work ... his one-liners will never be forgotten --- ""You're dern tootin'""...""Never trust a female, they're pure poyzin""...or my all-time favorite ~ ""Persnickgordy Women""...this crusty old-timer stole many a scene from Bill Elliott, William Boyd, John Wayne and Randolph Scott.

494031,4,6302676452,"After Gordon Elliott starred as Bill Hickok in a Columbia serial and then some Columbia features, his name got changed to ""Wild Bill"" Elliott -- and that was who he played in his first series at Republic, before becoming ""Red Ryder"" in yet another series and then moving up to A-budget westerns as ""William Elliott."" This movie introduces the new character, teams him with George ""Gabby"" Hayes, the best sidekick in show business, drops in perky Ann Jeffreys as the leading lady, pits him against a crooked territorial governor with Roy Barcroft as his chief henchman, and then we can just stand back and enjoy the fireworks.",976665600,15,625,4.850467289719626
