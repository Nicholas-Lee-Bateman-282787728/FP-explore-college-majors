8223396,5,B000WGYMAG,"I love this movie. The director and lead actor are extremely talented. The story, while dark, is inspired. The acting is wonderful. There are some scenes that are not for the faint of heart, but are necessary to the plot. I recommend this movie to all lovers of great cinema. I saw it last year at a film festival (Cinequest) and bought it this week. I am so happy it's available. I don't want to give away more than is already summized in the description. Just enjoy. I'd also recommend the latest movie by the same director (and actor), The Reject.",1205107200,2,550,4.455445544554456
