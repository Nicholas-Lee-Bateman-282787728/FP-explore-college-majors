8042931,4,B0006SRV30,Not bad for a horror movie this one definitely deserves a blu-ray treatment.,1442620800,,76,4.923076923076923
8042932,1,B0006SRV30,I also got the french version. I was told that it was a Pal system movie that was alright with me. What I wasn't told is that it was in French and hand no English subtitles. I was very disappointed in the communication.,1437523200,,219,4.116279069767442
8042933,3,B0006SRV30,"This FRENCH EDITION(2 disc set) has forced subtitles that CANNOT BE REMOVED!!! The French language version has no subs but you better know how to speak!! The extras are plenty(4 hours!) but the language is split. Some people talk French some talk English. Its a cluster f**k. The movie itself is a very nice picture. I am very surprised nobody reviewed this version yet. Oh well,you got one now!!!Have fun! Got mine for only $10 thank god.",1407974400,5,439,4.714285714285714
