4848972,5,B005NKIPUO,"""Sledge Hammer"" is one of those great, lost TV shows with a wonderful cult following. A show that was so inspired, so ahead of it's time, so great, that it was bound to struggle in the ratings and have a short life on television. It's truly one of the great ""Cut before their time"" shows. Thankfully, the show's rabid fans and cult base have never given up on the show, and it was released on DVD a few years ago. Now, you get this one stop shopping collection right here with the entire 2 seasons and 41 episodes all in one package.

Premiering in 1986, ""Sledge Hammer"" was a half hour cop show that was obviously a spoof on Dirty Harry. It starred Inspector Sledge Hammer (David rasche), a hard boiled San Francisco cop who loves violence, his gun, getting the chance to shoot or blow up something, and is quite insensitive, rude, and sexist. Oddly enough, he is very llikeable. Go figure. In the premiere episode, he is partnered up with Dori Doreau (Anne-Marie Martin). The series followed the two from one crime to the other, with their captain, Capt. Trunk (Harrison Page) trying to hold his temper and blood pressure from the always dangerous, clueless, and destruction causing Hammer.

Featuring a kick butt theme song by Danny Elfman, this collection is a laugh riot from start to finish. There is a lot of fun in watching Rasche brilliantly bring the gun loving, mayhem causing Hammer to life. You can tell he relishes the role and delivers it all straight, which makes it all the funnier. The premiere episode is titled ""Under The Gun"", although on the disc it's listed as just ""Sledge Hammer!"". The debut episode sets it up nicely. We instantly get a sense of who Sledge is, and is quickly partnered with Doreau. In a nod to 'Dirty Harry', the episode features John Vernon as the Mayor, a role he played in the Clint Eastwood classic. This episode deals with Sledge having to rescue the Mayor's kidnapped daughter. I don't need to go into every episode, but other season 1 highlights include ""Witless"", which is a spoof on the Harrison Ford film 'Witness', where Sledge takes refuge at an Amish settlement. ""Dori Day Afternoon"" is an obvious take off on the Al Pacino film 'Dog Day Afternoon' where Hammer and Doreau are trapped inside a bank with a couple of robbers. Sledge is followed by a news crew in ""Hammer Gets Nailed"", and investigates a slate of Elvis impersonator murders in ""All Shook Up"". Producer/Creator Alan Spencer ended season one pretty abruptly with ""The Spa Who Loved Me, thinking it would not be renewed. It was, and the finality of that episode was explained away in a typical TV cliche in the season 2 premiere, ""A Clockwork Hammer"". Season 2 is just as good, but I will leave it to you to either discover or re-discover the episodes.

Unfortunatley, this collection does not bring over the extras from the previous releases. No commentaries, no featurettes. That's a big disappointment, but the hysterical brilliance of the show is more than enough to make up for it.

In the end, ""Sledge Hammer"" was a hilarious show that was really too awesome for it's own good. I guess it was just not what the audience could warm up to at the time it originally aired. It's a shame. It is nothing but a huge, gigantic smile from start to finish. Hilariously acted, written, and just a blast. Still, we have the show on DVD, and that is cause for a huge celebration.",1325635200,18,3390,4.616915422885572
4848973,3,B005NKIPUO,"I was thrilled when I saw the entire Sledge Hammer series was going to be available in one set. This was one of my favorite shows at the time and I haven't seen the majority of the episodes since they first aired. When I got the set and opened it, the first thing I noticed was the lack of an insert paper. No episode list. No idea how many episodes per disc. Nothing. What if I wanted to watch a couple episodes I remembered enjoying first? Oh well, not really a huge deal. I just started off with the first disc and watched them in order. That's when the picture quality hit me. Most episodes are like watching a VHS transfer.

The show itself? It's a great mix of Dirty Harry and Police Squad with David Rasche as Inspector Sledge Hammer and Anne-Marie Martin as his partner Detective Dori Doreau. She is the intelligent, sensitive and competent half of this duo. Sledge Hammers idea of taking out a gunman on the roof involves blowing it up with a bazooka. Harrison Page plays Hammer's eternally angry supervisor, Captain Trunks. Other guest appearances throughout the series include Adam Ant, Sid Haig, Norman Fell, Richard Moll, Armin Shimmerman and Ray Walston.

I give the series itself five stars, but unfortunately have to knock a couple off for video quality, lack of inserts and no real special features to speak of.",1324425600,44,1328,4.59915611814346
4848974,5,B005NKIPUO,This is so funny.  Too bad it was only on for 2 seasons.,1509148800,,56,3.3076923076923075
4848975,4,B005NKIPUO,"Loved it. Classic 80's style humor, stupid but fun as all getup. Closest comparison is ""Get Smart"", though the interaction between the characters is not quite as good. Lots of witty lines, comedy, and being amazed how many things Sledge can do with a gun. He truly puts the ""nut"" in gun nut.

I'm glad I got it, though I'm not sure how many other people would feel the same way. Use Get Smart as your guide.",1508716800,,407,4.285714285714286

4848980,5,B005NKIPUO,One of my favorite comedy spoof shows from when I was growing up. Sledge Hammer has the type of stupid humor that has just enough intelligence to be hillarious without insulting the viewer. It's only drawback is that it is very much a product of it's time. Anyone that did not grow up in or live through the 80's might not get all the jokes and references.,1501891200,,356,4.3283582089552235

4848989,5,B005NKIPUO,"I purchased the ""Sledge Hammer"" series (Season 1 and Season 2, separately) and they are a welcome addition to any classic TV collection.  The quality of the DVDs is great and the packaging is professional.  I've purchased other series collections from other vendors and the packaging was inferior,  If you check out my Season One and Season Two reviews of ""Sledge Hammer"", I mention my favourite episodes.  Whether you purchase the individual seasons or the entire Complete Series, you won't be disappointed.  ""Sledge Hammer"" should have easily continued beyond the second year, but we have these which will give us hours of entertainment.  Inspector Sledge.  Hammer is a comedy takeoff on the ""Dirty Harry"" character.  Along with his partner Detective Dori Doreau, they investigate crimes in the Los Angeles area.

The humor can be subtle.  For example, in ""Play It Again, Sledge"", Hammer and Doreau are suspended from the police force and open up a private eye office.  Hammer gets 'career"" counseling from Humphrey Bogart (only Hammer can see him) and in the background of the office, you can see the silhouette of Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre walking past the office window in the corridor.
The only thing Sledge Hammer fears is world peace.  In my best Inspector Sledge Hammer voice ""Buy this collection, you slime-sucking maggot"".",1493078400,,1342,5.105504587155964

4848992,3,B005NKIPUO,"Haven't put the discs in the dvd player yet, BUT this is NOT new. Granted the description did not state it was new but neither did it state it was used.  I feel this is somewhat disceptive.  When I opened the mailer, the glue stuck to the cellophane wrapper. This was very thin, obviously a
re-packaged dvd.  Even though this is meant for a gift for my hubby, I tore the wrapper off.  The inside had an oily residue on the inside of the box as well as the discs;  the dvd's appeared to have been buffed/cleaned. Disc 5 has a scratch that they missed.  If it stated ""Used"", well, I have to appreciate any and all efforts to be sure it is playable AND I would expect minor issues.  Once again, leaving the information off, possibly to justify the price, is deceptive. I hope it plays without incident.",1486425600,2,799,4.322147651006712

4848998,5,B005NKIPUO,FANTASTIC!!!! I forgot how funny Sledge Hammer was. Can't stop watching & laughing. And parents there is nothing to worry about if the young ones watch. Imagine a guy tougher than Dirty Harry with a magnum he talks to that resides on a satin pillow. David Rasche nails it. Really it's as funny as Naked Gun.

4849001,4,B005NKIPUO,"I was just a kid when this show aired, but I remember it fondly.  After watching the series again, it doesn't quite live up to the nostalgia.  But it's still a lot of fun to watch.  The leads KNOW their characters and play them to absolute perfection. With slightly better writing, this could have been one of the greatest products of the 80's.  Thankfully they had the good sense to drop the laugh track after the pilot episode.  It would have completely ruined the tone of the show.",1480896000,,484,4.454545454545454

4849003,5,B005NKIPUO,"You have to remember that when they did the first season they used not real good film to film this series, in the second year they used even cheaper film. This is the main reason it look so bad, and it's a plane shame because of what we have lost in this. What a great TV show this was, absolutely hilarious. I love guns and always have, Sledge really just gives me a kick at how much he loves his, I don't sleep with mine, yet.",1480204800,,428,3.988372093023256
4849004,5,B005NKIPUO,"Yes, it's parody.  Great humor; often dry, characteristically politically incorrect (sexist or political).  You couldn't get this to air these days because of the cowards in media.  Definitely a good buy.",1474934400,2,204,5.516129032258065

4849011,4,B005NKIPUO,"I loved watching this show as a kid, and I was pretty stoked to find it on video.
Everyone that saw this show back in the 80s remembers it weather they loved it ( like 10 year old me) or hated it like my best friends parents
To really get this show you have to understand just how many stupid cop dramas were on the air at the time, and to have something like this making a huge mockery of the whole genre was just awesome. It's pretty amazing that this was on a major network at all, TV at the time was so formulaic you kids today have no idea how cheesey it was!
The show was only intended to run for one season, and season one is definitely the best, the unexpected second season has some good and not so good episodes but overall this DVD has been good times every time I've put it on.",1466380800,2,789,4.0

4849020,4,B005NKIPUO,"Sledge Hammer is a show in the vein of the classic Police Squad/Naked Gun and more recently Angie Tribeca. So if you enjoy those you would probably like this one too.

Its basically a take-off of 80's cop movies so it is sort of dated in many respects but I recently watched a bit of it again and I still laughed in places and that's not bad for a show of this age.",1461801600,,365,4.0

Video quality is excellent.  Audio is good.

Yes, it's cheesy.  It is supposed to be cheesy!  It is absolutely hilarious.

Dori (Sledge's female cop partner) asks why Sledge didn't tell her the big secret about the captain still being alive and hiding out.  Sledge responds, ""Umm.. Because you're a girl, and you have a PHONE."" so matter of factly. Bwahahahaa!!

No laugh tracks on this program.  Maybe that's why young people don't ""get it"".  I absolutely hate laugh tracks in all the current comedies on TV, and it gives me a headache.  Sledge Hammer is the prescription to cure that.",1448928000,6,636,4.796296296296297

You get the episodes and that's all. There's no closed captioning or even subtitles. Who makes these decisions??? Well, if you can find the Anchor Bay releases of the two individual seasons for a reasonable price, pick em' up. If you are in it just for the episodes, then this set is just right for you.

It makes fun of women so many people would be offended.  The shows get worse as you see more and more shows.  Either the writing went downhill (my theory) or you just start getting tired of the same old gags.

4849107,4,B005NKIPUO,"Sledge Hammer was some of my all-time favourite late night viewing highlights back in the early 90's.
So, what about this package? First, the 2 gripes: 1. The quality is still VHS level and the picture is therefore not up to  modern AV standards. Secondly, I would have been pleased if there were a warning to say that this set is region coded only to the USA. (Hooray for cheap Chinese imported DVD players  that do not care about region coding!!)
I do not care for the absence of special features that others have mentioned - I am happy to have the material.
Would any of the above gripes have stopped me from buying Sledge Hammer series?  No !!! The show, warts and all, is still a huge laugh. More fun than a barrel of monkeys!

The series is a loving send-up of macho cop movies. It follows the odd couple of super-macho cop and ""nihilist"" Sledge Hammer and his more progressive partner Detective Dori Doreau as they catch criminals with plenty of slapstick comedy and a heavy dose of satire.

It's one of the funniest things I've ever seen and holds up really well against modern comedies.

DVD set:

Ack. This dvd presentation is ugly. The video is about VCD quality (better than VHS, not nearly DVD quality). I'm assuming they just transferred from virgin Betamax. It's not bad, but I would've gladly paid more for a proper re-master.

There are no special features to speak of, though thankfully the laugh track has been removed. At least they're not flippers though. The discs don't even have inserts.
