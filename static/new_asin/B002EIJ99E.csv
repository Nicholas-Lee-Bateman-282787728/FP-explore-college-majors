8367724,5,B002EIJ99E,"I will keep it short.  This one is even better than his ""Live in SF"" DVD.  This is by far the best produced, best edited, best quality video and sound of any Reggae DVD I have ever seen (keeping in mind said genre produces notoriously subpar video product).  Put it in your Blu-Ray (for up-scaling to 1080p) and it almost looks like a true BD - its that good.  Add to this that DC is always awesome but he comes particularly heavy on this disk.  The band is fully loaded (three piece horn section, ladies backing vocal, excellent band as always) and they hold a tight flow for Don to rock; and rock he does.  I got this one on a Sat and popped it in - literally stopped working on the house so I could stop and watch.  Made me wish I was at this Reggae Rising but this was the next best thing I guess.  Even the break outs/interviews between songs are short, sweet, and don't detract from the concert.  Most importantly songs are not truncated.  Can't wait to rip the audio from this one and pump into my iPod.",1282089600,,1010,4.213541666666667
8367725,5,B002EIJ99E,This is an excellent example of reggae roots from a master like Don Carlos. You will not be dissapointed. You get the music/singing plus interview. Great!!!!,1256947200,,157,5.076923076923077
