412288,3,6301986105,"I remember seeing this as a youth,and enjoyed it then as now.  I got a little more excited then at Rita Moreno's strip tease then, but I was an impressionable 13!  She is still a beauty, and the movie has that dry Garner approach to humor that I find refreshing with all the ""in you face"" stuff today.  The twist at the end is great too.",1226361600,5,337,4.075757575757576
412289,3,6301986105,"Raymond Chandler's wisecracking, star-crossed private eye Philip Marlowe is transplanted into the swinging '60s where hopheads, strippers and psychiatrists join the usual compliment of thugs and goons that make his life miserable.  James Garner gets a nice dry run for the ""Rockford Files"" TV show, while Rita Moreno bares all in her climactic stripping scene.  Honestly, the script is not that great -- for the life of me I couldn't actually figure out who did what, or why... But it's still a fun film, in a campy kinda way.  The film's one truly great moment is a scene is with Caroll O'Connor as a police detective who, having wearied of playing Marlowe's schnook, bursts into a violent tirade about how lousy his job is, and nearly beats the handcuffed private eye to death.  It's a scene that could stand tasteful recycling elsewhere and, I suspect, was only in the film because O'Connor improv-ed it and made *something* good happen in this otherwise somewhat addled production...",1039996800,13,987,4.963636363636364
412290,5,6301986105,"Garner wins our sympathy as a battered P.I. who's client doesn't like him and neither do the thugs who cross his path.  This movie will make you feel like laughing and crying at the some time.  But you know that Marlowe is tough enough to come out on top at the end of the day.  Sort of corny in a Seventies kind of way, Marlowe is definitely comforting mind candy so curl up with a bowl of popcorn and enjoy!",1026518400,5,409,4.0875
412291,1,6301986105,"The title for this review says it all, it's exactly what ""Marlowe"" is. This is an atrocity.
Who could forget the performances that shaped Marlowe's film persona. Bogart, Mitchum, and even Powers Boothe. They knew how to do it. Garner on the other hand serves up a weak precursor to his ""Rockford"" role. As for the musical score and
overall tone of the film, it recalls movies like ""Shaft"" and too a lesser and unflattering extent ""James Bond."" (title sequence) More than anything else ""Marlowe"" is pathetic, it is pathetic because
it could have been well done, if anyone in the cast or crew had given any sort of consideration to the source material. Why did they have to ruin it? It isn't as if the public wouldn't have enjoyed a genuine effort. Yes, America was entering the seventies and movies of this sort were probably a big box office draw. But, just six years later Hollywood made ""Farewell, My Lovely,"" and they made it well staying true to Chandler.
Now, that film is a modern classic among Chandler fans. ""Marlowe"" had the potential to do the same, but chose instead to drown itself in a cesspool of seventies sludge. That is truly sad.",1009756800,13,1147,4.627450980392157
412292,4,6301986105,"This is a very entertaining 60's detective romp. It isn't too dated for the most part.  It is interesting to see a few of Rockford's traits in Marlowe, the Oreo cookies, the charm, and the slightly illegal activities.
He is attacked by Bruce Lee's character and finesses his way out.
He ends up further behind than he started like Rockford.
I enjoyed this movie and found it unpredictable, funny and a precursor to Rockford.",1003968000,21,424,4.72972972972973
412293,3,6301986105,"James Garner followed Humphrey Bogart and Dick Powell's 1940's act (and preceded Elliot Gould and Robert Mitchum) in this late 60's revival of Raymond Chandler's classic shamus character, with mixed results. Marlowe's deadpan private dick persona seems a bit out of place with all the love beads, paisley and acid-spiked cigarettes swirling about him. (I suppose you could argue that it boosts the film's appeal on a purely camp level). Garner makes up for most of the incongruity (and the rather complicated plot) with his usual devil-may-care on-screen appeal. A few supporting perfomances also keep things moving along, including a very sexy Rita Moreno and surprisingly funny Bruce Lee. Lee eats up his two brief scenes with much aplomb and choreographs a memorable rooftop ""exit"" for his irrepressible Winston Wong. Not classic Chandler, but an entertaining curio nonetheless.",997833600,5,881,5.391304347826087

412359,4,6301986105,"James Garner was the perfect actor to portray Raymond Chandler's wisecracking, semi-final Philip Marlowe. This movie is based on Little Sister, usually ranked sixth in quality of Chandler's seven novels. Nevertheless, both book and movie provide high quality entertainment. Marlowe's young female client from Kansas seems repressed and naive in her determination to find her missing brother. There is plenty of complexity, characters with secrets to hide and a terrific ending. Garner is completely convincing. I only wish Garner had been given strong Chandler novels to work with.",1476316800,,581,5.613636363636363

412363,4,6301986105,"I haven't read other reviews here for this movie, but I'd be surprised if no one else made Rockford connections between this movie and the well-loved TV series.  In that vein, whatever I have seen Garner in, he's pretty much the same guy, including the two Support Your Local..."" Westerns.  But he's got that special charisma on the screen which overcomes the similarities.  He's just fun to watch.  So if you like Garner you should like this movie.  The plot of Marlowe was a bit convoluted (at least after only one viewing) but it was never boring.  And Rita Moreno, in the few scenes she had, was hot and sexy.

412432,5,6301986105,"The problem with most detectives is that  detective must be intelligent. Sherlock Holmes is the obvious model. Later detectives get involved in more physical stuff but fundamentally a private detective who who can't figure out mysteries isn't going to stay in business long, A civil service police detective can afford to be stumped but not a guy in private practice.

But why would an intelligent guy be a private detective. Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon seemed prosperous and businesslike but that was the thirties in the height of the Depression. But when you bring the action forward to the sixties it becomes harder to make the career of private detective plausible.

Paul Newman had the same problem with Harper. But Goldman had a whole scene in which Newman (Harper) got to explain his finances and his motivations. Garner gets much less help from his screenplay. I saw this movie when it first came out - and I loved it. I still love it but Garner is this big handsome guy for some reason playing at being seedy. Why can't he get a better job that brings him into contact with a better class of people?

He made a comedy about this time -The Wheeler Dealers - in which he was mock tycoon. It was all a joke but he was plausible as a millionaire. He is less plausible as a down on his luck detective.

Bogart was small and kind of ugly. His charm comes through only slowly. Garner has a 10,000 watt smile and personality that lights up a room. He could be anyone he wanted to be. It's a little hard to believe he would settle for being Marlow,",1430438400,,1552,4.48936170212766

The screenplay is only loosely based on Chandler's novel, but that's all right. His books were always more about character than plot anyway. Bruce Lee has a hilarious scene in this one as a martial arts thug and demolishes Marlowe's office as a warning to the detective to back off.

Actually based on Raymond Chandler's novel ""The Little Sister"", which was published 1949.  Much of the storyline is devoted to mockery of the phoniness and self-importance of people in the film industry, combined with a plot twist that shows that Hollywood celebrities are not the source of all evil in the world.

Also, a parade of great character actors: Carroll O'Connor, William Daniels, Jackie Coogan and -- surprise, surprise -- Bruce Lee in a knock-out two scenes.

412658,4,6301986105,"There have been 6 major film adaptations featuring Raymond Chandler's ""poor but honest"" LA private detective Philip Marlowe. It starts in 1945 with Dick Powell in MURDER, MY SWEET (changed from FAREWELL MY LOVELY) which is closely followed by Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall's THE BIG SLEEP (shot in 1944 but released in 1946). Flash forward almost a quarter of a century to 1969's MARLOWE with James Garner set in then contemporary LA. Even more contemporary was 1973's THE LONG GOODBYE with Elliot Gould in Robert Altman's extremely unorthodox take on the character and private eye movies in general. Finally, Robert Mitchum starred in two very different versions. One is a remake of FAREWELL MY LOVELY (with the title restored) from 1975 which is a beautifully evocative recreation of the 1940s while 1978's remake of THE BIG SLEEP is transplanted to contemporary London and is better than its reputation.

Of the 3 movies that attempt to update Philip Marlowe, the 1969 version with James Garner is the most successful. Unlike the other 2 where the detective seems like a fish out of water, James Garner's effortless take on the character makes it easy to believe that Marlowe could be a contemporary of  the ""Age of Aquarius"". In addition to Garner the film is filled with choice character bits from old pros like Kenneth Tobey and Jackie Coogan as well as memorable moments from up-and-coming performers like Bruce Lee and Carroll O'Connor. There's also a remarkably sexy turn from WEST SIDE STORY star Rita Moreno. The screenplay by Stirling Silliphant captures most of Chandler's iconic dialogue and the direction by TV specialist Paul Bogart (no relation to Humphrey) moves the story along in a straightforward but effective manner. This is another made on demand DVD-R which means no extras but the transfer is fine and in the proper aspect ratio which looks great on a flatscreen TV.",1362355200,9,1896,4.996835443037975

You will see Jackie Coogan, Kenneth Tobey, the always wonderful Sharon Farrell, Rita Moreno in a drop dead sexy role, a young Bruce Lee straight from 'THE GREEN HORNET' series and pumping up his chop socky moves which elevated him to future stardom, Carroll O'Connor who was in the great John Boorman revenge classic 'POINT BLANK' the year before and British actress Gayle Hunnicut in a femme fatale role.  The script by Sterling Silliphant is less convoluted than most and the film moves in an entertaining clip throughout.  We must leave it to Director Robert Altman to give Marlowe the ultimate upgrade in his underrated opus 'THE LONG GOODBYE' a few years later with a very understated performance by Elliot Gould.  Recommended for Detective movie fans and fans of sixties television series, Warner Archive releases it in a nice 1.85 transfer with good sound but the price may be a bit steep. Garner ,as always, owns the role this time out.",1331337600,6,1384,5.026200873362446
412732,5,6301986105,"There's two reasons to watch this movie: 1) see Bruce Lee in his first movie role, and 2) see Rita Moreno's tits.  Bruce plays an underworld boss's strongman sent to discourage Marlowe (played by James Garner) from investigating a case.  Using just hands and feet, Bruce demolishes Marlowe's office.  How Marlowe eventually gets rid of him in Bruce's second scene is funny.

Rita plays the best friend of the person Marlowe is looking for, but her job in the film is as a stripper.  We get to see her act at the end of the film.  Rita is worth the wait.",1323043200,6,553,4.425742574257426
412733,5,6301986105,"I review this as a lover of almost all the previous Marlowe films (the exception is
 Elliot Gould in the Long Goodbye which is terrible). For me,Garner fits in well
with Bogart,Powell,Mitchum,Boothe (and even Caan in Poodle Springs). I've always
thought the story (Little Sister) to be one of Chandler's best-I suppose in
part because it has a bit more of a romantic interest for Marlowe than some
of the stories. As to the lack of logic in the story cited by one of the reviewers,
this is somewhat characteristic of Chandler. For example,there are still discussions
over what is going on in the Big Sleep. I don't think the update to the
1970s (Bruce Lee,hippies..) jarring to the original story. Drugs were certainly present
in many of the books. The DVD contains no extras (not even subtitles) which is
perhaps a shame.",1313971200,6,822,4.748251748251748
412734,5,6301986105,"As a Bruce Lee fan, it's great to see this title given some sort of official release all be it on DVD-R. The quality of picture and sound are both very good. Be warned though as this is one of Warner's archive collection and produced to order rather than mass produced there are no bells and whistles. It would have been nice to have had the inclusion of a picture gallery as well as the original trailer on the disc but hey, beggars can't be choosers. Service was excellent the product arrived on time and in great condition.",1313884800,3,526,4.377551020408164

The writing is good and has an outstanding cast of character actors. Carroll Oconnor, Gayle Hunnicutt, Sharynn Farrell, and Kenneth Tobey to name a few.
If you collect mystery or detective films this is a great addition to your collection.",1312329600,2,398,4.541666666666667
412736,4,6301986105,"""This is Philip Marlowe leave your message after the tone..."" If ""Marlowe"" had opened with these lines I wouldn't have been surprised in the least even though it was made four years before ""The Rockford Files"". ""Marlowe"" based on one of Raymond Chandler's lesser known novels entitled ""The Little Sister"". Writer Sterling Sillipant and director Paul Bogart give us an update bringing the story into the swinging 60's. The screenplay by  Sillipant (""In the Heat of the Night"")keeps the basic elements of Chandler's story and while the direction is a bit pedestrian the performances especially star James Garner, Carroll O'Connor, William Daniels, Rita Moreno and a supporting turn by Bruce Lee prior to his leap (pardon the pun...watch the movie and you'll understand)make for an enjoyable mystery/thriller.

Working on a missing persons case for a young woman (Sharon Farrell), Marlowe finds two of his potential leads dead with ice picks buried in their necks. He suddenly finds himself on the receiving end of an assault and threats for a case that suddenly takes a vicious turn.

Warner Archive has done a nice job on this DVD-R on demand. The print does contain speckles and there's some dirt and grit visible during the opening titles (no surprise)but, on the whole, the print looks quite nice even if there hasn't been any attempt to restore the film. Detail is nice and while the image occasionally veers on the soft side ""Marlowe"" looks quite nice for a 42 year old movie.

Audio sounds quite good with dialogue coming through nice and clear. It's a pity that there are no subtitles though as the likely audience for this movie would probably appreciate it.

The only special feature included is the original trailer for the movie.

While the film is a bit dated, it's a delight to see Garner in the role as Marlowe. Sillipant alters the material so that the role of Marlowe fits Garner like a well tailored suit. O'Connor and Moreno give terrific supporting turns that help elevate the material.

Recommended for fans of Garner, vintage late 60's films and Raymond Chandler. ""Marlowe"" may not be a perfect movie but this minor 60's classic is still an enjoyable flick.",1305590400,33,2177,4.915531335149864
412737,4,6301986105,"A hip and cool crime drama, Marlowe (1969) features James Garner as Raymond Chandler's iconic private detective Phillip Marlowe.  At the time, the film was a modern reinterpretation of the classic hardnosed private eye, who first appeared in print in 1939, and had last been featured onscreen in 1947.  The affable and versatile Garner, brought a new spin to the character.  Those who had previously played Chandler's hard edged detective, included Humphrey Bogart in film, and Van Heflin in radio serials.  The cool and suave Garner was a change of pace, however it should be recognized that the classic film noir days were clearly no more.

The screenplay for Marlowe was written by Sterling Silliphant, and was based on Chandler's novel, The Little Sister (1949).  As in the book, Orfamay Quest (Sharon Farrell) has come to Southern California all the way from Kansas, and hired Phillip Marlowe to locate her missing brother Orin.  Marlowe soon finds himself embroiled in a web of mystery, intrigue, blackmail, jealousy, greed, family ties, and murder.  To keep working the case, the detective has to convince police Lt. Christy French (Carroll O'Connor) that he is not the one leaving ice picks stuck in the back of several murder victims.

Some incriminating photos, lead Marlowe to Orfamay's older sister, actress Mavis Wald (Gayle Hunnicutt), and her close friend Dolores Gonzales (Rita Moreno), a dancer in a night club.  Wald's boyfriend Sonny Steelgrave (H.M. Wynatt), is an underworld figure who sends his messenger Winslow Wong (martial arts superstar Bruce Lee), to visit Marlowe.  When Marlowe refuses a bribe to get off the case, Wong destroys his office in one of the film's more memorable scenes.  Things get more dark and twisted, as Gonzales's ex-husband Dr. Vincent Lagardie (Paul Stevens) is involved in Orin's disappearance, and when more corpses turn up, Marlowe finds himself sticking his neck out, covering up crimes, and then later stepping aside, when another murder is about to occur.

Although this Phillip Marlowe is a less violent and more cerebral version than in the past, Garner is so real and natural in the role, that it's pretty hard not to like his performance.  There are some similarities between Garner's Marlowe, and Jim Rockford from The Rockford Files, however the material is more somber, and delves into the darker side of human nature, with almost nothing played for laughs.  Marlowe but seems tougher, meaner, and much more morally ambiguous, than Jim Rockford.

The film has a terrific supporting cast, with Carroll O'Connor a couple of years from All In The Family.  The multi-talented Rita Moreno, gets an opportunity to act and display her dancing talents.  Moreno would later win an Emmy in a guest starring appearance with Garner on The Rockford Files.  Sharon Farrell is also very good, as the emotional Orfamay.  Later in her career, after having lived in London for many years, Gayle Hunnicutt, who was born in Texas, would develop some really classy British mannerisms, but here in Marlowe, she seems very American with a slight Texas drawl.  Another reason for the notoriety of this film, is the presence of the legendary Bruce Lee.  Lee had come to the attention of the American public, playing Kato in The Green Hornet TV series (1966-67), and was about to begin his martial arts film career in Hong Kong.  Tragically, Lee would meet an untimely death in 1973, at only 32 years of age.

Happily this very entertaining and well-constructed suspense thriller is scheduled for a long overdue DVD release.",1304899200,9,3562,5.049572649572649

I was lucky enough to tape the unedited version on a late night Turner Classic Movies showing on my still reliable svhs recorder 15 years ago, and I just recently transferred the still pristine copy onto my Panasonic dvd recorder.

7819678,5,6301986105,"As many have stated, we all  have our Marlowe. My father's was Robert Mitchum. My first long term romance had his flag firmly planted for Elliot Gould. For me, it has to be James Garner. For a detailed film review, read any of the excellent reviews already posted here on Amazon. This concerns the video.

I have purchased both the DVD and Amazon Instant Video, at different times, obviously. I watch this so often I tired of going to get the disc. The video presented here, streaming, is clearly from the same source, the Warner Archive remaster. While they did remaster the film for release on disc, they chose not to release it on Blu-ray and, similarly, did not release an HD streaming copy (at least as of August, 2017). The best disc edition, currently, in the world, is the Warner Archive DVD and the video on the Amazon streaming service, SD, is identical, right down to the little pixellations and flaws during various interchanges throughout the film, which are, fortunately, rare. As such, the picture quality is very good, given the age, and the print shows only minor color distortions, occasionally tending a bit toward yellow but, overall, staying true to color. The sound quality is excellent, given the age of the film, but only very good when compared to modern film sound quality.

As stated, I am biased as James Garner is my perfect Marlowe so, of course, I love this film. But, who cares. You can read reviews, watch clips and decide for yourself. If you are considering this particular film, be advised that the Warner Archive Collection DVD and the Amazon streaming video are the same digital print and the quality difference will depend only on your television's upscaling capabilities as compared to the upscaling on a blu-ray player and your streaming speed and quality.

Good luck finding what you want.",1503100800,3,1831,4.803174603174603
