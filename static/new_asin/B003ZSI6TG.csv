A great movie to watch when you want to stop taking life so seriously and lighten up your day.",1282348800,2,326,4.278688524590164

8410796,5,B003ZSI6TG,"I've just finished watching ""The Forgotten Jewel"". It's truly a different kind of movie, unlike the ones I get to watch everyday. It was something different but very realistic,  That was pretty cool. I love the line ""Causing suffering to other will cause you suffer more pain"". Fights were pretty good, I was concerned if nothing happened to anyone, it was so real. It was amazing to see this small girl fighting. She's very talented!

 Mr Velez did a very good job. I was pretty scared of him, of the character he was in, to be honest. Though, he didn't have much time there :( There was a scene of him fighting a monk in the trailer but it wasn't in the movie. The scene where he fought with his sword. That proves whatever he did he did with his heart. He's outstanding and something to admire about him and about this movie!",1387756800,,828,4.398692810457517
8410797,5,B003ZSI6TG,"If you just read the negative reviews, you will miss out on something that is very different.  This movie was done with zero budget, but with lots and lots of love and dedication on the part of all who were involved (I wasn't, FYI).  There is a lasting and beautiful message underneath it all, and the cheesiness of it is also part of the charm of the movie! Give it a chance and support our independent film makers!",1382745600,,416,4.32051282051282
8410798,1,B003ZSI6TG,"I was looking for a action movie, no action. This movie look so fake,  it looked like someone made it with there phone camera.",1371686400,2,126,4.25
8410799,1,B003ZSI6TG,"I don't know how people can give this movie 3 stars. Don't waste your money. This movie stunk! I don't have a problem with Amazon Prime, I think it's a great deal, but sometimes I come across a movie that is awful. This was one of those times. The Forgotten Jewel with Jackie Chan was rotten, and I don't recommend you wasting your money on this movie.",1353196800,,352,4.268656716417911
8410800,1,B003ZSI6TG,"What is wrong with amazon.  How does amazon think ...  The movie is like oklahoma's version of a high school's remake of an elementary school's mockery of a Kung fu flick; it's so full of stereotypical hoopla it almost feels racist.  Watching 4 minutes of this cultural smear of a Kung fu movie made my stomach turn.  So bad I couldn't even laugh, right down to the hairy white guy's monk garb, obviously a table cloth still with its creases from the packaging.  I can only hope that Amazon has the smarts to accidentally drop this VHS tape into a bucket of mop water instead of making people think they might be spending money on an actually movie.",1352592000,,649,4.466101694915254
8410801,5,B003ZSI6TG,"This is the wrong version of the movie, still I recommend this to everyone. Why? A lots of aspects to consider, first this movie was done With No Budget at all which means not even Single Dollar was spent in this movie. Its experimental movie which aimed was to made a feature movie with no money just using creative imagination to make it happen. All kinds of down-to-earth guerilla style were used in this film. Its a challenge! A movie can be done with no money at all! Must Watch this and the right version.",1327449600,,511,4.389473684210526
8410802,1,B003ZSI6TG,Terrible movie. It looks like it was made with a home video camera. My young kids even thought that it was a cheap movie.,1320796800,,121,4.083333333333333
8410803,1,B003ZSI6TG,Horrible Horrible Horrible! I think this is the wrong video and i was retarded enough to spend my money. I am so tempted to call amazon and ask for a refund because this is not the correct movie! i am so disappointed right now.,1316131200,,227,4.181818181818182
8410804,5,B003ZSI6TG,"Great action, interesting graphics and a fine message.
Good for the whole family.
Loved the scene with the dogs.

Jack Tu is amazing!",1295481600,,133,4.782608695652174
