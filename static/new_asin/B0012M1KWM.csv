8246762,5,B0012M1KWM,"Dr. Michael Breus is an expert on sleep, that is why he is called The Sleep Doctor. I found his PBS presentation to be very helpful in figuring out why sleep problems occur. He believes poor sleep quality can be improved with proper sleep hygiene. He talks a lot about the stages of sleep and how light affects you. Therefore after watching this you may decide to do things like buy a new mattress or put darkening blinds on the windows. I found lots of things interesting like how people who are sleep deprived gain weight, probably because they are hungrier during the day.

While watching I wrote down 8 ideas for how to improve sleep. Therefore I found this very practical. It was also educational in an entertaining way. You won't fall asleep while watching this, I promise. It is very intellectually stimulating.

So if you suffer from insomnia and even take sleeping pills as I do, you will learn a lot. Education is key when trying to figure out what is affecting your sleep. I feel this DVD has solutions that I can actually apply to my life.
