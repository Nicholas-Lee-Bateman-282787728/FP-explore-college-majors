8262689,5,B0016J81K0,"I was lead to believe that this dvd was a vs. special of the japanese version of these power rangers shows. Instead, its pretty much just a theme track montage for the three sets of rangers on the cover. The series are pretty good for either version, but this dvd I think is only for the true japanese style of the show fans. Its up to you if you want to spend the money or not.",1395792000,3,378,3.986842105263158
