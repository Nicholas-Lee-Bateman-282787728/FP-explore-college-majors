8093390,5,B000BVYEKK,"Stuart Bull is an excellent teacher and guitarist. Every conceivable sweep picking pattern is covered here in great detail. There's also a nice backing track to play along with. Now you may not use all of these patterns, but if you simply master a few you'll have gotten your money's worth.",1352592000,,290,4.705882352941177
8093391,4,B000BVYEKK,"Stuart Bull runs you in a set of Sweep Picking exercise, in what I will coin as drills.  He literally dives right in at three-string sweeps starting at the top-6th string at  130bpms (triplets per se).  Of course there are a lot more exercises(drills) with plenty of variation.  This is a very good practice video for sweep picking either for someone who at least has at least a shallow familiarization w/ sweep picking or it can be a good video to polish great Sweeps for those advanced Sweep pickers.

The only two minor gripes I have are some of the exercises/drills could be a bit more melodic in a catchy sort of way, but then again others would argue that the exercises have a touch of melody in them.  Also, I have to agree w/  William V. Hayes about the amount of distortion applied to the sweep examples; the distortion/overdrive can be toned down a bit.

Other than that, anyone using this video to sharpen or to fabricate their sweeping technique will find this video very useful.

8093392,3,B000BVYEKK,"Stuart Bull has an excellent teaching style and I do like the approach of utilizing Minor/Major triads first and then moving on to larger patterns. The DVD does not come with a booklet, which would have been nice. It would have been nice if it even had some .pdf files with patterns on them, but NO, none of this. So, while Bull's teaching style is great, you have nothing to work with once you turn the DVD off.

One of my pet peves with the whole sweep picking thing is the distortion. I would like to have heard some of the examples with less distortion or a completely clean tone. I tried searching for something like this on youtube, but had no luck. Seems like everyone who uses sweep picking has to have an assload of distortion behind it. Gets old. I like a bit of classic tone, a bit more ""vocal"".

End result... it's a good video and definitely a good purchase, but if you can get it used for say five to ten dollars go that route. Twenty dollars is too much for the amount of information you don't get.",1270166400,4,1013,4.270833333333333
8093393,1,B000BVYEKK,"I rate this a one only because the exercises could be helpful to someone just learning.

First off, we shouldn't accept the excuse they give on their website about not offering Tab PDFs on the DVDs...these are exercises and they wrote them, it's not copyright infringement. The law their using to not give us tab applies to online downloads, checked with a lawyer that I work with.

Secondly, the training was subpar at best. Simply running through the exercises will little actual teaching.

I'd recommend the Hot Licks series, but you've got to rent them from Netflix first to see who can teach and who's just putting out videos that are fun to watch. This one wasn't even fun to watch.",1245369600,,688,4.669421487603306
8093394,5,B000BVYEKK,"Stuart Bull is an amazing musician and great guitar instructor. He explains everything in detail and shows all the lessons at a good moderate pace. I'm not amazing like he is, I'm more close to the advance stages of guitar but ever since I bought this DVD, I've improved alot and I can actually sweep, not crazy mozart fast but at a good moderate-speeded pace cleanly and smoothly because of Stuart Bull. I recommend this DVD to everyone and it's for all levels.",1235347200,,462,4.578313253012048
8093395,5,B000BVYEKK,"I have always been amazed at the sound of someone who can sweep as I am sure you have if you are reading this.

I found this DVD surprisingly helpful.  I have always watch all those clips of instructional video's across the internet.  So I was skeptical of getting this DVD.  I found it to cover information that no one seems to have ever mentioned.

There are good exercises to start small and piece sweeps together into the big 6, 7 or more string sweeps.  But what I found the most helpful was learning how to control the pick over different strength/thickness almost instantly adjusting which is what he points out at the very beginning.

Worth while getting if you are having trouble getting started.  If you can already do 3 string sweeps with no problem save yourself the couple bucks and practice them on different sets of all 3.
