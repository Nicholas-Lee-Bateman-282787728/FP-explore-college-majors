5115424,5,B007ZR9HPA,"Glad I finally got to finish this - didn't get to when it was on tv.  Its about nostalgia, clothes, music, beautiful girls and handsome guys.",1453766400,,141,4.423076923076923

5115427,1,B007ZR9HPA,"DVD's (Melrose place season 6, vol 1 and 2 + Final Season, Vol 1 and 2) are totally worthless unfortunately They
are all blocked by a ""region code"" and can
not be played These
DVD's should not be sold to European customers with region locks on it! Very dishonest! Total waste of money for the DVD's and extra
import taxes (84 euros / 96 USD)!",1445644800,,342,4.276923076923077
5115428,3,B007ZR9HPA,"I watched every episode of course, as Beverly Hills 90210 was my favorite TV show! The acting is not good, the story lines predictable and unbelievable, but still a 90's classic that is loved by many, I won't watch the series again as I would watch reruns of 90210 any and every time, but different strokes for different folks I guess....",1441152000,,338,4.557377049180328

5115434,5,B007ZR9HPA,"If you were hooked like I was back in the nineties then this is a must have for all. Even new generations that are into the new drama's I kinda feel this show is still relevant, and should be played more on television.",1419984000,,218,4.093023255813954

5115443,4,B007ZR9HPA,"I gave this product four out of five stars because although I love Melrose Place, this season didn't excite me like the previous ones. The story lines were a little too wacky.",1389225600,,175,4.5
5115444,5,B007ZR9HPA,"Well, this last instalment of season 7 was fantastic! I wished each season was released in one boxset... but I was keen to watch the show asap so I purchased all the half seasons and with almost 18 - 20 episodes per half season you can understand why they did it this way.
These dvd's saw so much dramas as relationships were 'finalised', death, drama and babies formulated this final episodes. I remember watching these final days of Melrose on tv and everyone was predicting how it would all come to an end... great to relieve these moments.... you won't be disappointed :)",1378512000,,575,4.592233009708738
5115445,4,B007ZR9HPA,"This was one of the classic TV shows that I had to own.  It is nice to see the gang back as I take a stroll down memory lane.  It would have been nice if there were extras and if they spent some time remastering the series, but who can complain about the series being on DVD so true fans can watch how this sizzling show ends?",1376265600,,326,3.8507462686567164

5115452,5,B007ZR9HPA,"See my review on vol. 1. Only thing is that i read the last song played was ""closing time"" by semisonic. That is not the case with this. But I loved the series nonetheless. Get it!!",1358553600,,181,4.055555555555555
5115453,4,B007ZR9HPA,"Melrose Place Final season volume 2 is the count down to the end. There are a lot of laughs and even a few tears. The story lines crumble around Eve but the whole overall feeling is a quirky fun melrose we all know and love. The whole cast delivers knock out performances till the very end. This season had a lot of ups and downs but volume to is really a fun kind of ending because it delivers so many laugh out loud moments. Though some points of this volume are slow, the story still keeps your grasp wanting to see what happens next. A must buy for true Melrose fans!",1357948800,,571,4.153153153153153

8523461,4,B007ZR9HPA,"This 1998-99 Season of MELROSE PLACE was awesome, despite the fact that it wasn't as successful as its predecessor BEVERLY HILLS 90210, plus I liked the return of Jane Mancini  (Josie Bissett) whom was married to co-star Rob Estes  (Kyle McBride) at the time.",1484352000,,259,4.863636363636363

8523463,5,B007ZR9HPA,"Love Melrose Place, all the drama, lies, bitch-slapping, blackmail, cheating, and betrayal you'd expect. I'm so glad they put the entire series on DVD. I miss the 90s because today we are flooded with reality TV no good scripted dramas like these from the late Aaron Spelling.",1459036800,,276,4.8936170212765955
