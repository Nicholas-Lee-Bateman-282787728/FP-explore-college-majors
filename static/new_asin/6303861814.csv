7854622,5,6303861814,"The whole series (tapes 1 through 4) is very nice.  Definitely geared towards the beginner ESL learner.  I teach a beginning ESL literacy class for students who are not very literate in their own language or who come from cultures where written language is completely different from the English alphabet (some Ethiopians and Middle Easteners, for example)  and this video is perfectly suited for them:  easy vocabulary and grammar, slow pace, clear progression from one conversation scene to screens that show the written text of the dialogue.  Also, it shows real life settings (conversation in a kitchen for example)  rather than a boring recreation of an ESL classroom.  I use it often to reinforce lessons and students enjoy it.",1089417600,5,732,5.100840336134453
