8168079,1,B000MDH7CE,I returned this DVD. It is more for practitioners that for a layman. It does not describe stretching that one can do on one's own. The stretching requires two people.,1487808000,,166,4.566666666666666

8168083,5,B000MDH7CE,"recommended by my brother after I had a fall and damaged a knee (patella and the end of the long thigh bone in the area).  This is a new way of exercising which is very efficient.  Have suffered from knee and lower back pain for decades (I am 68 years old).  It is a question of paying attention to one's body and knowing the anatomy of the skeleton and the muscles that are attached  to it.  They are interrelated.  All but one of the orthopedic doctors I consulted over the years were useless.  They just declared I had arthritis and learn to live with it.  No prescription except a massive dose of cortisone which I object to and the pain was gone for several months but the problems didn't go away.

The early pains and creaking knees in my 20s were gone with proper orthotics.  Unfortunately my doctor died prematurely and all other doctors wanted to create orthotics on a computerized scale and they made things worse.  I must have 6 pairs to throw out:  For years I exercised in aerobic and stretching classes that were too intense.  The 2-3 second stretches work wonderfully.  My new orthotics are made the old fashioned way with plaster and careful attention to foot movements.  I was a good swimmer at a young age, a golfer and played tennis for years. One doctor suggested surgery which I rejected out of hand.  My high instep, tight calf muscles and tight quads were putting my body out of alignment.  All these pains resulted in intense fatigue at a time when I had a very demanding job.  I returned to the practice I had initially gone to in the early 1970s and am getting the tests and the treatments I need, not a 5 minute visit with maybe an x-ray.

It is hard to find a doctor or therapist familiar with these techniques.  Now I exercise most days with ten 2-3 second stretches on both legs:  the lower back pain is gone.  If I miss a day I can go back to the stretches and the lower back and other pain is gone.

After decades of useless advice I am generally pain free except for the damage to the knee from the fall which is getting slowly better.  The other knee is fine.  Also related is a fall on the ice decades ago which this new excellent doctor diagnosed as damage to the IT band.  This is also a simple quick exercise to strengthen the IT band which also led to low back pain.

I insisted on an MRI which revealed the exact problem.  Since one is dealing with muscle tissue as well as bone, an x-ray is not enough.  It will only deal with one part of the problem.

Think seriously before having surgery and look at these alternatives.  If you have surgery you will still have to do many exercises after it.  I will resist surgery to the utmost.",1384300800,8,2673,4.348178137651822
