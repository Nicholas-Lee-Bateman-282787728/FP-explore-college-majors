Ian McShane is a talented actor. Always has been. Watch Con Man. He's excellent in it. You'd be forgiven if you thought he was terrible from watching this movie. He's hilarious in his utter lack of comic timing here. What's even funnier is that fact that Ian McShane is funny.

The movie itself plays like a really bad Benny Hill joke that goes on too long and I say that as a fan of Benny Hill jokes that go on too long. Worst of all is the fact that they waste so many things in the movie. There is a gorilla that's in love with McShane. Somehow this is only a throw away gag. I mean if you're gonna make that kind of decision. You gotta commit.

It takes serious talent to make a movie with this many bad decisions.",1388448000,4,866,4.173652694610778
