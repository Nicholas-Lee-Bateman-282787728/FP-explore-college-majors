Leonard Maltin truly discredits himself by calling this amazing, ultra-realistic masterpiece superficial! But then, isn't this the same Maltin who gave Taxi Driver only two stars out of 5 in his video guide? Ignore him, he knows nothing.
Listen to me and I'll set you straight. Keetje Tipple is an extremely rare film that manages to capture reality as it is; it juggles a thousand elements to create a fully three dimensional, balanced, film world of utter realism that with all its naturalism and proper harshness, is nevertheless not cynical.  Even Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"" is less authentic and detailed and far less realistic than this amazing fact based, magnificently photographed (by Jan De Bont, director of Speed and Twister) Dutch film from director Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven makes the mistake of having a sense of humor and a certain whimsical attitude that lends even greater realism to the film, but which superficial critics like Maltin take for 'superficiality' and 'not showing proper seriousness.' An awful two-dimensional cynical cartoon of a film like ""Magnolia"" that all the critics fawned over is a joke compared to Verhoeven's film.
If you've only seen Verhoeven's famous American films such as Basic Instinct, Total Recall, Robocop and Starship Troopers, you're in for a big surprise; the guy is truly an 'art' film director of the highest rank and he proves it here by drawing an astounding performance from Monique van de Ven, one of the best I've ever seen. Verhoeven's European films are much more sexually explicit than anything he made in the States. Verhoeven never shies away from showing violence, rape and full frontal nudity to drive his point home and Keetje Tipple is no exception. But if you think that he uses these elements exploitatively, you're wrong; they're just part of his attempt to shock people enough so that they realize they're not watching their typical Hollywood R-rated snoozer.
Overall, Keetje Tipple is one of the greatest films of the '70s, a highly underrated masterpiece, which I cannot recommend highly enough.",972604800,30,2167,5.138810198300283
