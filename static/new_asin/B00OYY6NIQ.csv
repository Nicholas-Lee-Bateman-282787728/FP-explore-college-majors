8685595,5,B00OYY6NIQ,I love the show it is an absolute riot however I was very disappointed that the dvd's I bought were copies from other sources and not a true blue DVD that you'd find in a store.,1473638400,,177,3.9444444444444446
8685596,4,B00OYY6NIQ,"Before World's Dumbest and Smoking Gun, there was this: a cornucopia of idiocy, a dictionary of dumb, a script of stupidity... America's DUMBEST Criminals. The host, Daniel Butler, takes stories, told by police officers themselves, and they are shown (via video camera footage), or re-enacted for our viewing pleasure. Some of the crimes you might have seen before, but make no mistake... this is definitely one to watch. Fans of World's Dumbest would get a kick out of its predecessor.",1442188800,,486,5.0875
8685597,4,B00OYY6NIQ,"It took me a while to get this review written because I wanted to make sure I took good notes for it first.  This was one of my favorite shows of the late '90s.  Was glad when it finally came out in this set. In general, I was pleased with the purchase.  However, there were a few issues with the set itself.  First, the episode list on the second season was incorrect.  It showed the list of episodes from the first season.  Second, on the third disc of the second season there were three episodes that had what I call ""false starts.""  The audio would begin with no video, then it would stop and restart with the audio and video.  The episodes this happened are ""Dressed for Success"", ""An Indecent Proposal"", and ""Halloween Hoodlum"".  Third, on the fourth season DVD on disc three, something happened with the episode, ""Clean-Up Crew.""  On the sixth story about halfway through, it somehow went back to the middle of the fourth story and replayed it, played part of the fifth story again, then skipped up to story 7 the ""ADC Headlines.""

I think it was because this was one of the first prints of this set, that these issues occurred.  That's why I gave the set 4 stars.  If these issues weren't present I would have given the set 5 stars.",1422662400,,1240,4.409691629955947
