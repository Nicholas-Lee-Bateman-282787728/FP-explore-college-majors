7876629,3,6304702000,"An interesting detective mystery that follows the investigation of a murdered police official. As the investigation unfolds numerous facts come to light about the life of the victim and the impact he had on those who served with him and those who were unfortunate enough to be his victims. The roof top stand off is intense, but not over done. The ending is abrupt. I expected a final closing scene with the usuall dialog summing up the tragedy, but there was none.",1306886400,2,465,4.682926829268292

Amazon - there may not be much that you could do, but you could put up your little ""Studio is not producing now"" icon so we could click to be notified by email and develop a number showing how many people would be interested.

In the meantime, anyone else who winds up on this page, please write Strand and other small DVD publishers who might be convinced to do this.  Hey.  How much are the rights?  I'll do it myself.",1149292800,5,449,4.235294117647059
