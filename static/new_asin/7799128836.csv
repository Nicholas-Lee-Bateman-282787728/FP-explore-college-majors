1117056,5,7799128836,"I have been a fan of disney ever since the little mermaid first came out, and have been a fan of the 2d since. And the one that stood the top in all the 2d animated movies of disney was Beauty and The Beast, which truly was worthy of its oscar. It had the magic of story telling that would wish you were in a fairy tail story. Sadly since then I have not seen any disney animated film worthy of an oscar not less to say but the magic was gone. After the 3d came in, I liked Toy Story but again no magic, and I personally didn't like ""UP"" although people liked it but I didn't. However, this is the first 3d animated movie that I WOULD SAY, has brought back the magic of disney again. I can't describe it but the magic is back and in 3d. if it were to me, I would say that this is going to be a big hit and I hope it wins an award.
Not only is the story good, but also the characters. Its laugh out loud funny, the characters suit there roles perfectly, and you won't get bored. It is a good family movie, and I would recommend it to everyone to watch this movie. You would remember again the disney magic when Beauty and the Beast came out. And you would surely like this one too.",1290816000,4,1180,3.9414225941422596
1117057,5,7799128836,"I would have to go back to Disney/Pixar's Up to find a movie I liked as much as Tangled.  It's a throwback to Disney's Little Mermaid/Beauty and the Beast/ Aladdin films where characters break into song (all composed -- including Tangled -- by the same composer).  Fantastic animation, character and art design and 3D all gel to make a great movie-going experience.  Highly recommended.",1290729600,3,386,5.0
1117058,5,7799128836,"If you are looking for your fix of a movie to make you smile and feel joyful inside, then this is your movie.  I say this because the movie centers around a beautiful woman named Rapunzel with very long hair, who longs for the day to enjoy the world outside. Her ""guardian"" warns her about the risks that abound for her if she goes free, but this only entices her to want to explore the world outside even more. Little does Rapunzel know at first that her ""guardian"" actually kidnapped her as a child and is only keeping her in the tower for herself. Rapunzel's life ends up unexpectedly getting changed for the happier when a charming but sensitive inside man comes to hide in her house. He ends up crossing her path after being caught in her house with an important item taken from the palace. They end up going on magical and happy adventures that change both of their lives for the better. Both Rapunzel and her newfound friend end up meeting many other interesting people along the way, and encountering some exciting adventures. This movie is going to make you laugh because I noticed that many other people were laughing at many of the humorous scenes in the movie. As mentioned at the beginning of this review, this movie is a must see if you know that you enjoy happy and uplifting films.",1290643200,3,1297,4.495762711864407
1117059,4,7799128836,"I originally had no interest in seeing ""Tangled"" based on the theatrical trailer, but good reviews convinced my family to go after dinner on Thanksgiving Day.  We had a great time among three generations: grandparents, parents, and 11-year old.  The audience was mostly families with younger kids, which was a mistake for some.  At least one family with two kids under 6 left a half hour into the movie and didn't come back.  Many parents might hear ""Disney"" and  not notice that the film is rated PG.  It gets that rating for a good reason, with some creepiness that may resonate more on an adult level (Mother Gothel kidnapping Rapunzel and their weird faux-mother-innocent-daughter interactions) but also some cartoon violence that comes across as scary on a little kid level.  When Flynn and Rapunzel venture into the tavern ""The Snuggly Duckling"" they meet a cast of scary-funny rogues like you haven't seen since ""The Poison Apple"" in ""Shrek.""

For ages ten and up (or a little younger if the idea of ""intense"" doesn't worry you), it's raucous fun with an almost Monty-Python-esque twist at some times; Indiana Jones action at others;  and romance reminiscent of the ""Kiss the Girl"" scene in ""The Little Mermaid.""

Rapunzel and Flynn were winning characters, and you'll be treated to the funniest horse I've ever seen on film.  The backstory of the King and Queen losing their baby princess stayed mainly in the background, but added a lot of emotional weight threaded through the story.

You see the Pixar storytelling fingerprints all over this Disney film, with animation legend John Lasseter producing, and that's a GREAT thing.  Lasseter added humor and action to a classic fairy tale, and kept the emotional heart intact to come up with a winning family film.",1290643200,6,1771,4.9425675675675675
1117060,4,7799128836,"*contains some spoilery bits*

Tangled, Disney's version of the oft-refashioned folk tale Rapunzel, is the studio's 50th animated film and one that is destined for classic status.

The Synopsis:
This latest retelling begins with a tiny piece of sunlight falling to earth and a magical golden flower sprouting where it lands. The flower, and its ability to restore youth, is discovered, used and kept secret by Mother Gothel. When the kingdom's beloved queen falls ill, a search for the flower (apparently its existence wasn't *completely* secret) is successfully undertaken and the healing potion brewed from it restores the queen's health. The flower's magical abilities are also transferred to the hair of the queen's unborn child, Rapunzel. When Mother Gothel discovers this and learns that the magical properties are only retained as long as the hair remains uncut, she kidnaps Rapunzel and raises her as her own child. Claiming that she wants to keep Rapunzel safe from a frightening world full of danger and thugs, Mother Gothel locks her away in a remote tower. While her hair (almost a character in and of itself) grows longer and longer, Rapunzel blossoms into a surprisingly well-adjusted young woman and gifted artist who longs to see the world - particularly the mysterious lights that appear in the night sky each year on her birthday.

Enter our amusing narrator, Flynn Rider, a roguish thief who has just stolen a tiara and is on the run from palace guards when he comes across Rapunzel's tower and takes refuge there. The very competent Rapunzel restrains Flynn, hides the tiara and strikes a bargain with him - she will return the tiara to him if he will agree to take her to see those mysterious lights, which he tells her are floating lanterns. Flynn agrees and the two set off on a rollicking adventure. Pursued now, not only by Maximus - a horse from the palace guard who refuses to give up the chase - but also by a pair of thugs Flynn double-crossed AND Mother Gothel, Flynn and Rapunzel learn to trust each other as they make one narrow escape from their pursuers after another.

Comments:
Tangled is a laugh-out-loud funny family film that will thoroughly entertain both children and adults. The animation is stellar, the story engaging and the pacing excellent, never dragging for a moment. Rapunzel and Flynn are both charming and likeable, making it easy for viewers to root for them. Further, they are surrounded by a terrific supporting cast including tavern thugs with secret dreams and Pascal, Rapunzel's pet chameleon. But it's Maximus who truly steals the show. The expressive horse is brave, determined, sometimes petty, and hilarious. Every scene he's in is solid gold. I would love to see some sort of sequel with Max and Flynn trading quips - particularly since Max doesn't speak at all and the two still seemed to be doing just that through much of Tangled.

I did have a couple of quibbles, neither of which significantly impacted my enjoyment of the film. First, the colors often seemed a bit too dark to me, rather grayed out. This impression may well have been exacerbated by the 3D glasses. (ETA: A couple of fellow reviewers have commented that they found the colors bright and vibrant when they viewed the film in 2D. It seems likely that my experience may have had more to do with the theater where I saw the film or with the 3D glasses - or a bit of both. This is especially important since I imagine most Amazon costumers will be purchasing this film in 2D. My thanks to Star Fire and Thomas Plotkin for their input - I really appreciate it!) Second, even though I felt they were well performed, the songs were, IMHO, largely under whelming. With the exception of the lovely ""I See the Light"", I felt they had neither the excitement of previous Disney showstoppers ""Be Our Guest"", ""Under the Sea"" or ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"" nor the memorable melodies of ""Kiss the Girl"", ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""Circle of Life"".

On the plus side, the film is rich in emotional depth and is blessed with a number of wonderful scenes. My favorite sequence begins with Rapunzel and Flynn entering the village and dancing with the villagers and continues on through their scene on the lake among the floating lanterns. Their happiness in the village, Rapunzel's sense of wonder (and ours!) while surrounded by the lanterns, the romantic song they sing as they realize they're attracted to one another and may be falling in love - it's all perfect. The lantern scene is jaw-droppingly gorgeous - well worth the price of admission on its own and the film's most effective use of 3D. Another scene that I loved for its poignancy centers on the silent communication between Rapunzel's parents as they mourn their lost daughter together just before releasing their floating lantern.

I do want to alert parents to one element. The relationship between Rapunzel and Mother Gothel is difficult and layered, dealing with emotional abuse masked with concern and declarations of love. (Mother Gothel's frequent put-downs of Rapunzel, followed by a cheery ""Just kidding!"" had me clenching my teeth.) Young children who are used to a more black and white portrayal of good and evil may be confused by Rapunzel's oft-declared love for the woman she believes is her mother and by Rapunzel's conflicted feelings when she first leaves the tower with Flynn. This unhealthy relationship doesn't overshadow the film, nor does it steal the humor and fun from it, but parents should be prepared for questions children might ask and concerns they might have. These questions may not come until a second or third viewing, when children have already seen the scenes where Mother Gothel more explicitly reveals her true nature and so have that knowledge when viewing the early mother/daughter scenes.

That said, I still loved the film and believe it's a great addition to Disney's animated classics. Lastly, let me just add a big ""Yeah!"" to the film's final moments when Flynn, back in narrator mode, reveals that it was several years before he and Rapunzel got married. A much better message for children than the more usual we-saw-each-other-twice-before-tying-the-knot which seems almost de rigueur in so many fairy tales.

Highly recommended.

Note: Author, editor and fairy tale aficionado Terri Windling has written a wonderful essay about the long history of the ""Maiden in a Tower"" story which, it turns out, predates the Brothers Grimm by more than 200 years. I found reading about how a story evolves over time and across cultures absolutely fascinating. (Essay is available at Windling's website. A simple google search - ""Rapunzel"" + ""Terri Windling"" - should get you there.)",1290643200,526,6702,4.912544169611308
1117061,4,7799128836,"One of the pleasures of watching ""The Princess and the Frog"" a year ago was in knowing that Disney was getting back in touch with their roots. They gave us a traditional hand-drawn animated film, a process they had abandoned after the 2004 release of ""Home on the Range."" It was like witnessing a glorious rebirth, the resurrection of a seemingly lost art form. My hope what that it would once again become custom for animated films to be done by hand. It may be painstaking, but can you deny the beautiful results? The backgrounds. The form of the line. The coloring. The lighting. The mattes. Alas, it wasn't to be; for ""Tangled,"" Disney has once again discarded pencil and paper for a computer screen. They have also released it in 3D, a cinematic beast that cannot be tamed.

But please, don't get the wrong idea. ""Tangled"" is not a bad movie at all. It's funny, sweet, and adventurous, and it's strong in character, story, and theme. And like all the good Disney animated films, hand-drawn or otherwise, it puts a refreshingly modern twist on a classic fairy tale, ""Rapunzel"" in this case. It also employs a major talent that ""The Princess and the Frog"" would have greatly benefited from: Composer Alan Menken, who - along with lyricists such as Tim Rice, Stephen Schwartz, and the late Howard Ashman - was a key figure of the Disney Renaissance, having composed such memorable tunes as ""Be Our Guest,"" ""Under the Sea,"" and ""Colors of the Wind."" His ear for melody compliments Disney so well, it's almost a shame it isn't like it was in the Golden Age of Hollywood, when cast and crew were contractually obligated to work for a specific studio.

""Tangled"" begins with the story of a golden flower that sprouted when a drop of sunshine fell to Earth. It glowed like fire and possessed magical rejuvenating properties when sung to. A vain old crone named Mother Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) depended on it to continuously restore her youth, and so it remained for several centuries until the Queen of the kingdom fell ill while pregnant; upon drinking an elixir made from that golden flower, not only was the Queen brought back to health, she also gave birth to a daughter with magical golden hair. Gothel, desperate to reclaim her immortal good looks, is forced to kidnap the infant princess, since cutting her hair off robs it of its healing powers. And so the princess was raised as Gothel's own in an isolated tower, where she was conditioned to be fearful of the outside world while her hair continued to grow longer and longer and longer.

We meet this princess, the innocent Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore), on the verge of her eighteenth birthday. Although she takes Gothel's lies at face value, she remains curious about an annual event held off in the distant kingdom: The releasing of hundreds of floating lanterns, which Rapunzel has figured out are not stars. Is it a coincidence that this event takes place on her birthday? She would like to find out. Here enters the film's narrator, Flynn Rider (voiced by Zachery Levi), a handsome, smooth-talking bandit who seeks refuge in Rapunzel's tower after robbing the King and the Queen. Upon coming to after being whacked in the head with a frying pan several times, he and Rapunzel strike a deal: If he promises to take her to see the lantern ceremony on her birthday, she promises to return his stolen loot, which she has hidden from him. And so begins Rapunzel's first venture away from home, a journey that will include chases, encounters, escapes, revelations, and yes, even romance.

It's traditional for an animated film to feature supporting players that are funnier and more memorable than the protagonists. ""Tangled"" provides us with several such characters, including Rapunzel's pet chameleon, Pascal, and a royal horse named Maximus, who has the nose of dog, the reflexes of a cat, and - when in the presence of Flynn - the personality of a mean older brother. We're also given a number of pub-crawling thugs who secretly harbor sentimental hopes and dreams. One of them, voiced by Brad Garrett, has always wanted to be a concert pianist, despite having a hook for a hand. Inspired by Rapunzel's innocence, they all reveal their desires during the film's best song, a hilarious showstopper called ""I Got a Dream.""

""Tangled"" is, in short, a pleasant, entertaining, competent animated film, a decent addition to the Disney animated-feature canon. Even so, I would have preferred to once again watch a traditional cel animated film. Perhaps I'm remember with longing the days of glorious labor-intensive productions like ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" and classics like ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" ""Pinocchio,"" and ""Sleeping Beauty."" Simply looking at these movies is an experience unto themselves. I also think that the film's original title of ""Rapunzel"" would not have altered its success in any way, despite Disney's belief that ""The Princess and the Frog"" lost out on a potential viewership of young boys. Forget about marketing and demographics - just focus on the story.",1290556800,3,5106,4.871116225546605

1117673,5,7799128836,"Wow.  My younger daughter (20) loves, loves, loves this movie.  She made us watch it, me, her mother, and her older sister who hates romance.  We both loved it, even the one who usually doesn't like romantic movies!  I think they liked that the princess character is independent-minded, brave, and adventurous. She takes care of herself. Disney princesses have entered the modern era and it is a very welcome change.

My daughter says she loves it because it is hilarious, but actually pretty dark with a villain that is realistic enough to be truly frightening. As such, the story has real drama and feeling not just for little girls but for older ones too.  We know another college-aged woman who went through a period in high school where she watched Tangled every day after school!  Obviously this is a pretty phenomenal movie!!  Moana is my absolute favorite Disney movie, but I think Tangled is the favorite for both of my daughters.

The writing and voicing is excellent and the animation is gorgeous and very expressive (we loved the horse!). The lantern scene is one of the most beautiful Disney scenes ever.  You have to see this movie!!",1515283200,8,1147,4.776649746192893

1117806,2,7799128836,"This is a funny movie, but I am always looking for the underlying message my kids are learning. I felt that one underlying message I heard was ""you can't just trust what your parents tell you, you need to get out there and make your own choices"". Well, sure it wasn't her real mom, but she thought it was, so then kids can start wondering ""how do I know my parents are my real parents"", and ""my parent seem loving, but they are probably making their decisions off selfish reasons."" Then also, on the subject on whom to trust, she puts her trust in a thief, and it all comes off so romantic and perfect in the end. Now I am not saying that people can't change, I have seen people change when they ask God into their heart, and then slowly become a totally new person. But as a general rule of thumb, marrying someone who has a record of doing wrong, and expecting  them to change has been a recipe for miserable marriages. We should be teaching our children to look for spouses that have good character. They won't find anyone perfect, but if they at least look for someone with good character, someone who is trying to do right. And people can change, but wait to see if someones changes, and if it is for real and long lasting, before they marry them.",1512950400,,1252,4.305084745762712

This is definitely one of my favorite movies. It has everything-- a strong and dangerous villain, songs, romance, spirit, humor....

Not all of the songs are that memorable, but there's a duet called, ""I See the Light,"" and it is beautiful. A song the villain, called Mother Gothel, sings gives me goosebumps. The woman who voiced her, Donna Murphy, has an incredible strong, powerful, and beautiful voice. Specifically the reprise of ""Mother Knows Best,"" it is one of the best villain songs of all time.

There is a load of humor, but some jokes, as another reviewer has said, only adults will get. This was targeted toward kids, but not as much as Frozen or Moana. Tangled isn't dark itself, but it is dark compared to other Disney movies. There are two side villains, the risk of hanging, stabbing, blood, prison....So if you're tired of watching Frozen with your kids or need a bit more excitement, then watch this.

One thing I love so much about this is that it is one of Disney's few exhibits of true love. (SPOILER AHEAD) In detail, Rapunzel's love, Eugene, is stabbed, and she can heal him with her magical hair. She sacrifices her freedom for him, saying she will do what the villain wants if the villain will let her heal Eugene. Instead of letting her heal him, though, Eugene cuts her hair, making it die and turn brown, unable to heal him. He seriously sacrificed his life for her!

The characters are excellent and well-built. There wasn't a very good backstory for the bandit Flynn Rider (who's real name is Eugene Fitzherbert--that makes me laugh each time) and no explanations for why Mother Gothel wants to stay young, but they all have strong personalities. Out of the the five three-dimensional Disney Princesses we have so far (Merida, Rapunzel, Anna, Elsa, Moana), I'd say Rapunzel is the best, and it's not because she comes from my favorite Disney movie. She is a go-getter and has hobbies. She is determined and isn't real rude to her ""mom"" throughout the movie like Merida was, but actually shows a spark of an attitude at one point. Her singing is good, and her face isn't perfectly angular like Aurora's, but a bit round, which is surprising. She is brilliant and realizes something rather important near the climax, using logic. When she finds out Mother Gothel is the villain, she is brave and bold to her. Rapunzel has a fierceness and strength in her, and it's not attitude like Merida had, nor the kind Elsa has. She is a great character and role model for girls.

I prefer this over Frozen. Not that I don't like Frozen. It is one of my top ten favorite movies. I just prefer Tangled more. It's the sort of movie I watch one day and want to watch the next. It has me shivering, my eyes watering, and I'm wrapped up in it, not thinking about the fact I'm watching a movie or wondering who voiced that character. It's a great, memorable movie for people of all ages. Even a 13-year-old boy and 50-year-old woman were laughing and grinning. Make sure to watch it with your family and as often as you want. It's one of Disney's most creative movies (the only similarities to the original are bad woman, long hair, tower, and tear). It's one of my favorite movies, and I can see it will be that way for many, many more years.

1118298,5,7799128836,"Disney has delivered again with this modern fairy tale with old Disney magic. It seems that Disney is improving with time on their animated movies. Most of the newer Disney movies I favor over, the older ones. This pace of this movie was excellent; the storyline was not slow nor boring. I would recommend this movie for older children because of the sensitive issue of kidnapping which centers around Rapunzel's life since she is a deceived hostage. The musical score was delightful as well; it made me reminiscent of the nineties animated movies.  Also, parents may be cautious of the scenes of Rapunzel using a frying pan as a weapon to hit people. We would not want children to think it is okay to mimic that behavior. Overall, the movie was excellent, and I would recommend for families to watch together. :-)",1502755200,,814,4.732394366197183

1118835,5,7799128836,"One of the more visually interesting movies I have seen in a while. I have a feeling that if I had watched it muted I would have enjoyed it nearly as much. I would say that this is a must see... if you're at all into Disney, or animation, or and medium of visual storytelling it's going to be hard to not enjoy the visuals here. The color and composition are great, and the use of her hair as prop, character and plot device was better accomplished than I ever expected it would have been.

The story isn't bad, and it isn't great either. On one hand I like that Aladdin-esque rogue/hero evolution thing and the joining together of enemies for the support of a common end is an interesting trope, but there is a little hand waving at some villains turned allies that could have benefited from some actual story telling... or at least compelling conflict. Am I being too hard on a Disney movie? Nah. I know an 8-year-old me would have enjoyed ""I like her, she's nice to me and I'll help her, but I'm still a crook"" more than ""now we're all suddenly good guys because someone was good to us!""",1492214400,,1090,4.317073170731708

I'll admit that I wasn't a huge fan when I first watched this movie (back in 2010 when it came out) but I have since grown to really like it.

1119376,5,7799128836,"Seven years ago directors Bryon Howard and Nathan Greno gave life to the ancient fairy tale Rapunzel. Tangled is fun modern take on a classic fairy tale. Tangled is a great movie because while staying true to the fairy tale, fun new twists are added to create excitement. It is important to bring this film back into the picture because there is nothing wrong with an adventure, and Tangled is full of them.

Tangled begins like most Disney movies, with a voice-over narration, this one given by a charming thief named Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi). Beginning with his story ensures the men and boys in the audience that this will not be like the typical Disney princess movie. Having the narration begin the film is one of the only original aspects. The story of Rapunzel has never been told in a film version and this was a creative and new take on it.

When Flynn ends his narration, the story then finds its center of focus, which belongs to Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), a princess locked in her tower with only her 70 feet of magic hair and pet chameleon for comfort. Also living in the tower is her mother, or should I say evil woman named Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy), who kidnapped baby Rapunzel from her real parents and has raised her in a terrible passive-aggressive physical and psychological imprisonment. Even though Mother Gothel has brainwashed Rapunzel and only keeps her around for her magic hair, Rapunzel is young and curious. As she approaches her 18th birthday she sets of on her heroic journey of self-discovery.

The development of the story can be slow at some points because it leads up to musical numbers. Even though the buildup may be slow once the songs come along you are glad they did because the music foreshadows and sets the mood up for the upcoming scenes. All in all, the music all has meaning and contains important values and messages. Music is an important aspect of emotions and the way the songs placed throughout helps you feel the emotions of the characters.

The production of Tangled was incredible. The architecture of the tower Rapunzel lives in is everything you would remember from the fairy tale you were told as a child. A big castle with clouds behind it makes it very welcoming. The way the camera focus on the castle and makes it the main focus of many scenes is very pleasing and makes you feel a little nostalgic. For the eye, there are sequences that have some of the breathtaking beauty and elegant detail of the great, old hand-drawn Disney features. A scene of paper lanterns descending through mist onto water is especially breathtaking, creating an experience that is almost tactile in its dreamy softness. Like much of Tangled this moment gives a new look to some very familiar magic.

This fun new take on a classic is portrayed in many outstanding ways. Finding negative aspects of this film is very hard because Disney has outdone themselves once again. With the beautifully animated characters and the great voice-overs it is hard not to love this film.",1487808000,,3013,4.731428571428571

1120576,4,7799128836,"I and my 4 year old enjoy this story line immensely. Be aware that if your child is young and sensitive, there are some scenes that are difficult to explain:
Child: Why does Rapunzel's mama have her all chained up and is pulling her
Me: Oh don't worry, Honey. That isn't really her mother.
Child: But... what?
Me: Yeah she's just the woman who stole Rapunzel from her REAL parents in the middle of the night while she was sleeping and the real parents couldnt' stop her in time.
Traumatized child: I dont' want to do it. Why did she steal her? I'm sad for her and her mama and her dada.
Me: Well, she didnt' want to get old, so she stole Rapunzel because her magic hair kept her looking young, remember? Her mama and dad get her back in the end when she's all grown up and they've already missed her entire childhood.",1483228800,2,817,4.27741935483871

1121057,3,7799128836,"Nothing remarkable or wildly exciting about the story events or the animation. The characters were ok. It was kind of interesting because it was different. In a time period when most Disney princess movies (Mulan, Frozen, Princess and the Frog, Brave) were about rebelling against the patriarchy and not needing men, Rapunzel was a bit more like a Renaissance princess in that she wanted freedom, love and to satisfy her curiosity, as well as the fact that she was, for a time, the obedient victim of a wicked female character. As opposed to being about rebelling against a man, it was about emotional abuse at the hands of a parent figure. For a Disney princess movie, it was something different, though I feel they only took that route because they couldn't think of much else to do with a story like Rapunzel. I have to admit, Rapunzel doesnt seem like a fairy tale Disney would do. Unfortunately, it's just not very exciting here.
Rapunzel looks odd. When I first saw a pic of her, I thought they were doing the fairy tale the way it originally went, because she looks like she's about twelve. She's not very pretty, though her hair is gorgeous. The surroundings aren't that fascinating to look at. The songs weren't anything spectacular either, though some of the instrumentals are lovely. Of course, the male lead, Flynn Ryder, is an overgrown child, useless and incompetent. Rapunzel knocks him around with ease, and even animals are more resourceful than he is. I did find the ending, where each was willing to sacrifice him or herself for the other, to be sweet. The darkness and violence of the attempted killing was also different enough to be kind of interesting. But there's not much more to say about it than that.",1481932800,,1728,4.744186046511628

As an adult, I thought the movie was very good, and would even say it was hilarious at times.  Each character is well designed with great voice actors/actresses.  Even the horse and chameleon make a good showing.  The movie does has its twists and turns, so just when you figure you know what's coming . . . . you don't.

As for the ""wicked"" character, she's bad.  Disney has a way of making the good people, good and always putting the evil out there, too.  I sort of wish the sequel was as long as the original movie, but it's not.  It's an extremely funny, but ""short"" 8 minute (or so) clip.

It's a wonderful Disney film and I highly recommend it.",1474329600,,737,4.282608695652174

The main character, Rapunzel was the best character in the movie, and was very cute and likable(she ended up being my favorite Disney Princess). Of course like most Disney movies, the animation is well done. The music, songs, and score were very memorable. Despite coming out on the same year as Toy Story 3, Tangled is a modern day masterpiece that your family must own!",1473897600,,528,4.688172043010753

Songs are fun and often funny. Princess Rapunzel is so sweet and equally feisty. The animators did a remarkable job with her hair.

1127338,4,7799128836,"As a Disney fan, I rented this because I hadn't seen it before and wanted to get ""caught up"", so to speak. I loved Tangled but there were things I hated about it also. WARNING: Plot Analysis/ Potential Spoilers. I loved that Rapunzel dares to question things and doesn't take things as they are...smart enough to bide her time until the right time. Even as she asks Mother Gothel, for permission...she still plots to leave on her own before ever meeting Eugene/ Flynn Rider. I liked that Rapunzel and Maximus(horse) were at a similar crossroads of trusting their own instincts. I really loved the concept of the mutual rescue...about doggone time, if you ask me. Now, to the things I hated: About Rapunzel: If her hair is 70ft long, then she could've rescued herself ANYtime she wanted(after her hair became long enough, of course)...also, in the song ""When Will My Life Begin?"" , the tasks she lists included sewing and baking...well, how do you do those w/o access to a knife OR scissors? In theory, there wasn't that much stopping her: Climb down w/ a knife or scissors, big haircut(either take cut hair with her or burn it, so no one could misuse it)...Escape to village, get smaller haircut.  With the exception of the blonde hair, Rapunzel bears a strong resemblance to the queen...so why did no one think to take her home to her birth parents sooner? How could anybody pass that mosaic everyday for nearly two decades in the kingdom and not see that their ""lost princess"" was home. Now, on to Mother Gothel...no powers other than her vanity and greed, lame! Why live for hundreds of years if YOUTH is the only reason?? Second, ""Mother Knows Best""...oh, heck naw! Worse villain song ever! I would hate for any child to think insults like those in that song  had anything to do with actual parental love. As an adult, I know better though an impressionable child might not.

1134427,5,7799128836,"This may just be my favorite Disney movie of the 2000's (or all time!) Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi (as Rapunzel and Flynn Rider respectively) are perfect! Tangled has just the right amount of old school Disney singing (nothing annoying like Frozen!) mixed with newer Disney Animations to keep everyone entertained! Even the side-kick animals have amazing personality- Pascal the chameleon and Maximus the horse (who is chasing Flynn) are hilarious! This movie is a staple in my house, covering all the bases- my toddler girl, my 1st grader boy, my husband and myself, we even let my parents borrow the movie and they enjoyed it too! The only downside of this version is that it doesn't come with a digital copy (you have to get that separately, or with the Blu-ray 3d version.)",1460678400,2,778,4.813432835820896

1134689,5,7799128836,"Disney's upbeat reinterpretation of this classic Brothers Grimm fairytale is, like most of their other modernizations, quite delightful. The most surprising part is that it took Disney so long to sparkle up the old tale as it seems right in their wheelhouse: a blonde-haired blue-eyed beauty is rescued from her ""adoptive"" mother who keeps her trapped in a tower where the only entrance is a high window which can only be accessed when she lets her hair down. Disney's version isn't nearly as somber as the original but it is decidedly a fairytale in the same tradition. In a pleasant reversal of the Grimm's story, Rapunzel is now a plucky princess long since lost to her parents, though still the most beautiful in the land, and her ""rescuer"" is the commoner/thief Flynn. Throw in some adventures, a few laughs, and the songs and what you get is standard-issue Disney right down to it's core. Is that a bad thing? Not a bad thing at all. The songs are well produced, the voice-acting is about as close to top notch as you can get, and best of all, the animation is a beautifully vibrant blend of CGI and hand-drawn art that is one of the more visually stunning efforts Disney has recently produced. It is very much so worth the price of admission; my kids love it, my husband enjoys, and its nice to have another quality production that we can enjoy as a whole family.",1459296000,,1370,4.595918367346939

Without compromising the classic story, Disney has filled in the gaps with appropriate back story. They've added in action scenes that are fun and hilarious. I especially like the way they portrayed Rapunzel as a strong woman with a few quirks and insecurities. The way she handles ""the hair"" is a real hoot! They have fleshed out an old story and turned it into a masterpiece. This is a film I can watch again and again. Which happens to be a good thing as my Grandchildren do watch to it frequently. They are on their 2nd copy! They know every line, cheer for the heroes and sing along to all the songs. One day I am sure their children will love it just as much as we do.",1458172800,,845,4.2875

Two of my favorite animation series are still ""Charlie Brown & the Peanuts Gang"" and also ""The Flintstones"" so I love good animation. I don't care for singing every few minutes, I need those songs spread out; but if there is frequent singing those songs better be good songs. In ""Tangled,"" I know I loved the story line & I know the songs were good & I do believe the songs were spread out just enough not to be too annoying to those people who don't like continuous singing.",1458086400,5,684,4.253846153846154

1139639,5,7799128836,"Nobody can retell a fairytale as uniquely and expertly as
Disney.  For their 50th animated feature, Disney chose to
modernize the classic tale of Rapunzel, keeping somewhat
faithful to the original German fairytale by the Brothers Grimm.

As the film opens we learn how Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy
Moore) is kidnapped as a baby from a King and Queen by
an old woman (voiced by Donna Murphy) who finds that the
hair of the child has healing powers that will keep her forever
young.  Making certain that nobody else has passage to these
special powers, the princess is locked away atop a hidden tower.

As Rapunzel grows into a young teenage girl, so does the
length of her hair.  The elderly woman who has taken on the role
of the Princess' mother visits her daily, calling for her to let
her hair down so that with every brush, she remains young.

Enter Flynn Rider (voiced by Zachary Levi), a thief by trade,
who just happens upon the tower while being chased by just
about everyone he has double-crossed and stolen from.  Upon
meeting Rapunzel, Flynn is unwillingly coaxed into helping
the Princess escape the confines of the tower so she can
discover the wonders of the outside world.

Though the story is familiar to adults, this modern interpretation
offers a fresh perspective thanks to its exquisite animation that
looks more hand drawn than computer generated and the addition
of some friendly animals that include a horse named Maximus
and a cute chameleon named Pascal.  Tangled also boasts
an entertaining, funny cast of medieval characters that we first
meet in The Snuggly Duckling Bar which becomes the setting
for one of the best musical moments in the film.  Unfortunately,
as charming and cute a film Tangled is, the music and lyrics
by composer Alan Mencken and Glenn Slater are completely
forgettable.  I don't think anyone will finish the film remembering
a single tune.

Tangled has a very old-fashioned Disney look to it and you
can sense that the animators did everything possible to retain
that classic feel.  Transfer is ultra-sharp and detailed but
nothing else seems overdone as colors have more of an oil
painting feel rather than being abundantly vibrant.  Black
levels are quite acceptable and there is no artifacts present.

Keeping with the classic feel of the film, Disney hasn't
resorted to much ""gimmickry"" with its 3D effects.  Though
the animation is greatly enhanced by the technology the
effects are more subtle than being ""In Yo' Face.""  Several
objects do protrude the screen ever so slightly which include
swords, elbows, hands and splashing water. One of the more
memorable 3D moments of the film occurs when Rapunzel
is first introduced to the world outside her tower.  The
cleverly placed animated greenery in the foreground gives
a nice feeling of depth as the Princess romps across the forest floor.

Ghosting is a minor issue here.  As with most any
film it rears its ugly head in any scene that is dimly
lit.  You can see slight ghosting within the background
of Rapunzel's tower confines or The Snuggly Duckling
Bar.  Objects like a dropped rope or even pointed swords
exhibit double images around its edgings.

The 7.1 DTS Master Audio was downconverted to
5.1 on my system but sounded full-flavored and
immersive.  Dialogue is expertly carried through the
front channels with effect noises that are expertly
placed across the entire soundfield which lend to
making the 3D experience even more realistic.  The
film score comes across powerfully and I was quite
pleased with some of the underlying LFE activity that
came beneath a stampede of galloping horses and
other climatic moments within the film.  Overall, I would
rate this as a quality listening experience.

Tangled arrives in a 4-disc package that includes the
Blu-ray 3D and 2D versions, DVD and Digital Copy.
There is added supplemental material that includes
a behind-the-senes tour of the filmmaking process, deleted
scenes, expanded songs and two alternate versions of
the film's opening sequence.

Tangled certainly will not stand as Disney's most
memorable effort, but I'll be darned if I didn't have
an immensely enjoyable time watching it.  The film
has so much ""heart"" to it, and by the time it wrapped
itself up I had a tear in my eye.

The film and its effective 3D imagery makes for the
perfect family movie and it comes with the highest
of recommendations.",1453075200,,4379,4.9103260869565215

It has great characters, great music, and great story.  The floating lantern scene is one of my favorite all-time scenes in an animated feature.  The portrayal of the wicked overly protective/borderline mother and the sheltered, conflicted daughter were well-done without being too uncomfortable.  I guess if I had one complaint it would be that the chameleon doesn't add much to the movie, but he is just a chameleon.  We watch this one often!",1446940800,,600,4.776699029126213

This one is fantastic. take a classic love story, throw in a strong independent and Innocent (in a cherishing way) lead woman, add a standard dashing frivolous young hero, that ends up not quite being a hero...more like a charismatic burglar (at first). throw in a horse that keeps up with them all, and a fight between a sword and...a pan.

that has got to be the best sword fight ever. er....pan fight? sword pan fight? If you think that's weird...the horse was wielding the sword. you gotta see it. this movie had me laughing and tearing through the whole thing. one of the best, most balanced and funny love stories out there today.",1439856000,4,845,4.48051948051948

1148774,3,7799128836,"My 3 year old daughter absolutely loves this movie, can't get enough.  And for the most part, I don't have a problem with it.  The heroine is a strong and compelling female archetype, the animation is very well done.  The music is alright, but a little too Broadway shmaltzy imo.

I never really bought in to the Flynn and his band of thieves storyline...but again, I'm a 35 year old male, this movie was never meant for me.

The issue I have, for the most part, comes down to one lyric of one song.  Early in the movie, Gothal (the evil witch who poses as Rapunzel's mother) is singing ""Mother Knows Best"" and tells Rapunzel that she's ""looking a little chubby"" as a reason she shouldn't go out in public.

Now I know that we are supposed to be getting the message that Gothal is not a kind mother figure at all, and that she's simply using scare tactics to keep Rapunzel locked up.  But none-the-less, did Disney really have to go there?  With impressionable young girls watching this show and making it their life's mission to memorize each and every lyric, should we really include a line about body shaming?  I work tirelessly as a father to instill body positivity in my daughter, along with healthy lifestyle choices.  So every time I hear that line, I bristle.

While Disney movies make a point to reach a broad audience, princess films like this one specifically reach young girls.  They are the ones watching these films over and over...absorbing every last detail.  Come on Disney, you can do better.",1432339200,3,1511,4.58955223880597

1149167,5,7799128836,"For Disney's 50th animated movie, they have returned to their roots, sort of.  They had added a new princess to the long line of fairy tale heroines in their stable, dating back to Snow White in their first movie.  However, instead of traditional hand drawn animation, they've chosen to make Rapunzel their first computer animated princess.  While this doesn't bode well for those who want to see both forms flourishing side by side, Tangled itself is wonderful.

When the queen was pregnant with Rapunzel, she became sick to the point of death.  The only way to cure her was to find a magical plant.  The plant was the secret of Mother Gothel (voice of Donna Murphy), who used it to keep herself eternally young.

Mother Gothel soon discovered that Rapunzel's hair had that magical property, but if her hair was cut, it lost it.  So she kidnapped Rapunzel and hid her in a giant tower.  Over the years, her hair grew long and continued to restore Gothel's youth.

Fast forward eighteen years, and it's almost Rapunzel's birthday.  More than anything, Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) wants to see the floating lights that always appear on her birthday in person, but Mother Gothel is so controlling she won't let it happen.  That's when fate enters the story in the form of Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi).  He's the most wanted man in the kingdom, and he's trying to hide out in Rapunzel's tower.  Only she blackmails him into taking her to see the lights.  Where will this relationship lead?

I must admit, I don't know much of the story of Rapunzel beyond the basics (young woman with long hair in a tower).  A few times the thought crossed my mind wondering if something was in the original story or not.  But as is usually the case with Disney, they take the basics and make it their own.  While I'm sure most of the elements of the story are new, they feel like they've always been part of the story.

The prologue, which sets everything up, is a bit on the slow side.  But once the story really gets going, it's a complete blast.  The plot was fairly obvious from the beginning, especially since it is a fairy tale.  However, the story kept moving forward quickly, which kept me engaged.  Plus, the Disney spins to the story made things much more interesting.

And the humor was great.  Pascal, Rapunzel's pet chameleon, and Maximus, the blood hound horse trying to track down Flynn, absolutely steal the show.  Any scene they are an active part of is a complete hoot.  The humans get some great laughs as well.  I saw this with one of my roommates, and we were both laughing multiple times.

The only complaint I've heard of the movie was the music.  Yes, this is a musical in the grand tradition of Beauty and the Beast or Aladdin.  The complaint I had heard was that the songs felt forced.  I will admit that they didn't advance the story as much as they do in the movies I previously mentioned.  However, I did feel like they were more a part of things than the songs in last year's Princess and the Frog.  A couple of them are hauntingly beautiful (as you'd expect with Mandy Moore and Donna Murphy singing them), and there's one that is an absolute hoot.  Zachary Levi does the singing for his character, and he holds his own with this cast.

There's been some controversy with this film because they changed the name from Rapunzel to Tangled in an effort to attract boys.  Trust me, this is a movie that boys will enjoy.  It's got great action and the previously mentioned humor.  In fact, I think the entire family will enjoy this one together.  Yes, it does have romance to it, but this feel much like Aladdin to me, a movie that will appeal to everyone.

The computer animation in this film is beautiful.  They strove hard to create the look and feel of hand drawn animation with the computer, and the result is art like we've rarely scene in computer animation.  Yes, it is still stylized, but it's a huge step forward.

What I think surprised me the most about the film was how much I came to care about the characters.  Flynn and Rapunzel are so nice, even though Flynn starts off as a thief.  I really enjoyed spending time with them.  On the flip side, I found Mother Gothel to be one of the most menacing villains in a long time solely because of her mind games on poor Rapunzel.  I don't think she's scary enough to frighten young kids, but she is pure evil.

If you are looking for a fun movie for the entire family, this is the film to see.",1431475200,,4452,4.483188044831881

1150627,5,7799128836,This is the only animated movie that I saw recently that I actually loved. Characters are actually developed and have a bit of complexity to them. Jokes were not too obvious. It is as if some smart people spent some time to thing of new and original things instead of just re-hashing what worked elsewhere. I laughed till I cried.

1151041,5,7799128836,"Funny, adorable family movie for all ages. Mandy Moore (Musical Artist) music throughout the movie makes this movie not only fun to watch but fun to sing along to as well. My family has the songs stuck in our heads for days after watching! The movie is packed full with parts that will make the little ones laugh, and I even caught myself laughing at the horse - who is quite a charming character, and has many facial expressions that speak loud and clear for him (since the horse can not speak).

I thought with all the music in the movie I may not like it, since I am not a fan of musicals but the story really pulls through and the musical songs are tied in very well with the moment they enter. Mama knows best, your kids will be happy (especially girls) and giggle most of the way through the movie. Perfect for a rainy day when I have work to do - I find myself singing right along with the kids! I highly recommend this movie!",1428105600,5,933,4.212290502793296
1151042,5,7799128836,"This title feels decades more old-fashioned than ""Frozen"" but Rapunzel is still infinitely more assertive and interesting than the true ""classic"" Disney princesses. (""Sleeping Beauty"" just about put ME in a coma!) The climax is unabashedly romantic and grandiose and I can respect that. Certain key emotional moments are rendered with impressive nuance and a touch of ambiguity that makes them all the more convincing therefore satisfying.

They spent almost as much as the entire live action Lord Of The Rings trilogy COMBINED. This ungodly sum didn't go for sprawling, epic battle scenes - it mostly just yielded a unique, organic glow, combining the best attributes of computer and hand-drawn animation. You might as well keep an eye out for it and enjoy. (It does actually serve the narrative quite well. By comparison, Frozen can almost look like a video game, sometimes.)

It's not all warmth and fuzz, of course. There's some visceral action and a scene or two that could almost make a horror movie. I liked the villain a lot - she seemed genuinely funny and scary.

I do prefer Frozen overall for its comparatively radical storyline and profound characters, but the margin grew somewhat narrower after watching this a second time. It really is very well done, and that's saying a lot coming from me, a straight middle-aged dude who usually prefers to browse the Criterion Collection or savor a John Wayne western.",1428105600,5,1421,5.012711864406779

When I went back to check if I had any misspellings or other grammatical errors in my review, I ended up reading the other reviews written yesterday. Very entertaining. When something has 14000 reviews, the latest ones rarely get read. One reviewer mentioned that she liked Tangled better. That intrigued me, so I rented Tangled last night. Another really fun movie. Flynn (or his real name Eugene) is just too handsome for words and he KNOWS it. But his good looks don't get him far with Rapunzel. I love the use of the cast iron fry pans in the movie (people, don't do this at home).  It was a funny reoccurring joke. The guys at the thieves tavern were vastly entertaining as they sang about each of their dreams. The floating candle lanterns set off on the missing princess's birthday where beautiful. Rapunzel's character is completely endearing, more so than Anna in Frozen. Another really charming animated movie from Disney. I agree with the other reviewer on Frozen that Tangled is a charming keeper, more for the fun story and adventurous scenes than for the songs. Will be buying this when my next pension check comes in!",1425513600,8,1174,4.726829268292683

This cartoon has got all the best elements to make this a very enjoyable movie in equal amounts. Action, drama, humor, and of course the traditional Disney sing-a-long.

The characters were lively. The action actually complimented the story very well and the songs were in the right places at the right times. There wasn't none of that ""Hey gang let's sing a song 'cause we haven't sang one in the last 10 minutes."" type of singing stuff.

This movie was hysterically funny. Even the horse acting somewhat human contributed to the laughter. Overall, I had a fun time with this and I think anyone would find it well worth their time and money to see it.",1424390400,,781,4.4475524475524475

1153642,4,7799128836,"Ah that line is so funny. Gothel reminds me of a wicked version of 80's Cher with curly black hair. Tangled is a good film.  Not a great film like The Lion King, Beauty and Beast, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid or any of the other renaissance period films but definitely worth watching.  My toddler loved the horse Maximus and laughed several times when he was on screen.

I was hesitant to watch this movie because our local paper only gave it 2 stars. I had heard it was mediocre and a so-so film from other reviewers.  After watching the movie I think it is a very good movie one of Disney's better animated efforts.  Perhaps because it did not have any memorable catchy songs to single out the movie, it did not perform as well at the box office.  But the story is decent and the movie moves along nicely.  I thought the outlaw hideout was funny and enjoyed that scene.

I thought it strange at first how people from the castle could not find a big tall tower right in the middle of a forest.  You would think that tower would stand out like a sore thumb.  Like the Space Needle in the middle of Mt. Rainer National Forest.  But as the story moves on, the viewer just goes with it.  In the end it all makes sense.  Rapunzel is a likeable heroine I am sure every girl with long hair can relate.  Others have reviewed the film better than I can.  I found the film entertaining.",1424390400,,1376,4.27906976744186

1154363,4,7799128836,"It's an excellent movie. Has a thick plot like all Disney movies! Great characters in it. Excellent villain who is eventually defeated by Rapunzel and Flynn. Good color. The plot in Tangled is like no other plot in any Disney movie! All the character's personalities are all strong and perfect! Flynn's speed, aglity, humor! Mother Gothel's greedy, selfish, vain self! Raphael's fierce independence, her bravery, kindness!
While it's excellent, there is one thing that I sort of don't like.

(Mother Gothel) ""I love you very much.""
(Rapunzel) ""I love you more."" {Flawed too}
(Mother Gothel) ""I love you most."" {This is the part that has flaws}

So you get the ""I love you most"" part. Mother Gothel says ""I love you most."" Really, Disney? Really?!Did you really have to add that scene two times? Lilly( my little 4 year-old sister) kept on saying to mommy ""I love you most."" whenever mom said ""I love you."" We tell her that it's rude to say it and just say I love you, but she still does it. I suspected that Tangled caused it.  And it did! Come on, Disney! Kids today when they watch a character on t.v; and especially little kids, do or say something bad or weird, they're likely to repeat it on other people. I'm not kidding! Also, Rapunzel loves the villain!

I'm not saying don't watch it. Just be wary of weird words and acts.",1422316800,,1331,4.60337552742616

1154655,5,7799128836,"I watched this movie back when it came out in theaters in 3D. Back then, and to this day still, I am convinced that I will never see a finer way to use 3D movie projection than the scene with the lanterns (if you haven't seen it, go watch it... it's amazing). Tangled brings to life an innocent and sheltered young woman who's intelligent beyond measure and good-natured to the point that it will warm even the most hardened and manly hearts. Tangled is witty and incredibly funny. The voice cast is amazing, the animation superb, writing creative, and the art... well... that's completely out of this world. The thing is I watched this again after I saw Frozen, and I found that Frozen just didn't have the same spark that Tangled did. I make that comparison now (after I've rewatched Tangled) because my mother did after she saw Frozen.

But what I really love about this movie is the way conflict between not only other characters and their different motives, but her own internal question of ""should I or shouldn't I?"" and ""does he or doesn't he?"" become so important and ingrained in story of this film. It's a coming of age story... A story about understanding what's most important in life... A story about true love... A story about holding on and letting go... It's about looking beyond someone on the outside and truly seeing them. It's about bravery, and owning up to mistakes. And while there are incredible laughs all throughout, there are those moments that this film will really make you feel something. And before you know it... you'll be laughing and crying... and smiling... all happy, sad, and in love at the same time. A true fairy tale.",1421280000,4,1657,4.6552901023890785

The rest of the movie was good, but the ""deal breaker"" I just mentioned was too big to ignore. Mothers have enough to cope with without a cute movie undermining the good we teach our little ones. ""Meet the Fairies"" a 2011 Australian musical is the best DVD I have purchased for my daughter.",1419811200,3,775,4.58273381294964

Mandy Moore's Rapunzel is well portrayed, as is Zachary Levi's Flynn Rider/Eugene Fitzherbert, though Maximus is a ""palace horse"" anyone would love to own. Donna Murphy's Mother Gothel is so good you'll love it how she gets it in the end, while Ron Perlman as the two Stabbington Brothers was on a level I never imagined. The story lines, for Rapunzel and the supporting characters, taking examples from previous films, adds to the hilarity, including the slow-witted Captain of the Guard, a lovable Big Nose Thug searching for true love and a musical Hook-Hand Thug that dreamed of becoming a concert pianist.",1417737600,,660,4.901785714285714

I was very impressed by the music, the animation, and what I thought was an engaging and well-written film. I had a few issues with the character development, but thought--and maintain--that Frozen was a great film. I would express my concerns but want to avoid spoilers.
A friend of mine told me that if I liked Frozen I would really like Tangled. Tangled did not get the strong press Frozen got and seemed heavily ignored in comparison, so I assumed it would be a light, albeit generally enjoyable film.
While Tangled was not the musical masterpiece Frozen was, it was cute, had engaging characters and a strong plot. It was truly a great film and was actually slightly better than Frozen in terms of plot and character development.",1417392000,2,874,4.681818181818182

1158751,4,7799128836,"This is a great disney movie!  It reminds me of the ""older"" disney movies.  Great storyline and animation. Very entertaining.  It was not laden with singing/songs.  The only small critique I would make is that the songs that were in this film were overly produced to the point where it didn't match the animation.  There was so much digitizing and ""studio/recording"" sound to it that it felt like it should be on the soundtrack, not actually in the movie.  I know that is picky, but that is where I still like the older disney films better.",1416182400,,540,4.572916666666667

1161871,5,7799128836,"My kids are older and I hadn't watched a Disney movie in a long time.  I loved The Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast, but after those I never felt drawn into any of the other romantic stories, didn't really feel the Disney magic.  My teen daughter had seen Frozen and I was told it was so great I just had to watch it and [spoilers ahead] while I enjoyed that the love story was between two sisters, I didn't really feel there was anything special about that movie.

Spoilers ahead:

And this brings me to Tangled.  I was so disappointed in not finding ""that moment"" in Frozen, that I decided to check out some other Disney films I had missed and came across Tangled.  What a pleasant surprise!  Rapunzel is adorable and likable and Flynn Rider is a funny and handsome hero.  You fall in love with these characters as the movie goes on, and I think Flynn Rider is one of the best male Disney characters ever.  Maximus is just great--I love his character, his expressions.  The look on his face when Flynn says that ""maybe we were just misunderstanding one another"" is priceless.  He is now one of my all-time favorite characters!  And that lantern scene!  Disney doing what Disney does best!  This movie was so good I made my husband and teen son watch it as well.  Flynn is a great male character and the action scene is as thrilling as any action movie, that I think boys would enjoy Tangled as well.

Of course, my husband commented on the fact that the palace should have been better guarded to begin with!  He also cleaned his glasses during the lantern scene, a scene which had me transfixed, but even so, he still enjoyed the movie.

Wonderful characters, excellent casting of the voices.  Mandy Moore is delightful as Rapunzel. Zachary Levi is perfect as the handsome, funny Flynn and his voice singing of Now I See the Light is wonderfully moving. Donna Murphy is superbly evil as Mother Goethel.

I don't know how Tangled is not as popular as Frozen?  This has become one of my all-time favorites.",1407628800,,2014,4.50828729281768

I didn't even realize who the main actors were until later, but the horse steals the show. If you love Chuck Jones animation, this is the closest your going to get with out it being Chuck himself. The two leads are great, they have a chemistry that comes through even in the animation and some of the scenes will leave you on the floor laughing. I have watched this movie at least a half of dozen times since I bought not all that long ago.

I liked Frozen ok, so I thought well if theses guys are saying Tangled is that much better I should check it out.  So I did.  Let me tell you... I'm 36 and I don't even remember the last time I watched a movie and wanted to watch it again right away... maybe The Neverending Story in second grade or one of the Herbie movies.  This movie is the first movie that I put in that category in the last decade.  Not that I haven't seen multiple films right away, but I watched this one again within a week of the first viewing.  If someone came over and I was like have you seen Tangled?  And they were like no.  I would be like.  Wanna?  And then I would watch it again with them.  Seriously a really fun, funny, endearing movie.  I would consider this classic Disney at it's best.  Put it up there with Aladin and Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid.

5 stars
Starring: Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi, and Donna Murphy
Release Date: November 24, 2010
Running time: 1h 40m

When the kingdom's most wanted - and most charming - bandit, Flynn Rider, hides out in a mysterious tower, he's taken hostage by Rapunzel, a beautiful and feisty tower-bound teen with 70 feet of magical, golden hair. Flynn's curious captor, who's looking for her ticket out of the tower where she's been locked away for years, strikes a deal with the handsome thief and the unlikely duo sets off on an action-packed escapade, complete with a super-cop horse, an over-protective chameleon and a gruff gang of pub thugs. Tangled is a story of adventure, heart, humor and hair -- lots of hair.

My absolute favorite princess fairytale from Disney is Rapunzel's story: Tangled. I won't say it charmed me immediately, because I first watched it when I was younger, and I hated the witch, so, naturally I had a hard time watching the movie at all. My older sister loved it, though, and I never understood why. (As you can see, Mother Gothel totally spoiled the whole thing for me).

But, not too long ago, it was on regular T.V., so the whole family agreed to watching it again. Boy, am I glad we did! I fell in love with it! Surprised? So was I!

Tangled is charming, energetic, magical, funny, sweet, and romantic. It has all the elements to make the perfect Disney princess movie. I even prefer it over Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella! *Shock* I just think it's such a great movie!

I love Flynn Rider (a.k.a Eugene), played by Zachary Levi. His humorous attitude, smolder, and the mishaps that befall him never fail to make me laugh. Disney really hit a home run when they created him. To me, Flynn is one of the most memorable Disney heroes to ever come on screen. His incredible sacrifice of giving his life to save Rapunzel from slavery showed his unsurmountable love for her. He's definitely a `swoon worthy' Disney prince.

Rapunzel, played by Mandy Moore, is beautiful, sweet, spunky, independent, and absolutely charming. She's a brilliant Disney princess, with a huge heart, big dreams, and a head full of hair - lots and lots of hair. Again, she is one of the most memorable, and best, Disney princesses of all time. Plus, Rapunzel has one of the prettiest voices - I'll enjoy getting to go back to the movie time and time again to listen to the music. (Or YouTube works too...)

Tangled has the feel of a classic Disney princess movie - the characters, the setting, the story, the songs. The bright colors and wonderful animation make it a really fun movie to watch over and over again.

Tangled is a beautiful masterpiece - one of the best Disney movies I've seen yet! I adore it and the characters therein. Thank you, Disney!",1401235200,,2762,4.657084188911704

My niece and I never once moved, and even my husband was fully engaged in the movie and laughing with us.  Tangled is definitely a keeper, and is great for all ages!

1165272,5,7799128836,"This movie is a lot of fun and it's endearing although the mother/daughter relationship is a bit disturbing.  It seems that in our modern movies that we're supposed to like the villains more than we did in the old days... which makes them kind of creepy.  I mean, if they are evil, ok they are evil.  But these modern villains aren't all that evil which makes the incredibly bad stuff they do a little tough to swallow.  Scar - pure evil.  Ursula the Sea Wich - 100% evil.  I prefer the cut and dry hate or love in an animation.  I don't want to work hard in an animation, I like simple.  This is entertainment for unwinding.  If I want difficult I'll watch The Hours again.  STILL, the performances are great, the story is fleshed out nicely.  There's not too many musical numbers and the ones in the movie are face paced instead of laggy like musical numbers usually are (ala Frozen).",1400371200,2,886,4.407407407407407

It is!  First off, I like this movie a lot.  It's an 8.5/10 for me, but that's not what I'm reviewing.  I watched Avatar, Finding Nemo and Tangled in 3D the first night I had my 3D TV (yes, my eyes were tired when I was done, it was a bit much) and I wanted to give feedback on which movies are worth buying (or especially buying again) for 3D.

Tangled blew me away in 3D.  Nemo really didn't even compare, obviuosly partly because it wasn't originally made to be 3D.  And honestly as a whole, it was more impressive than Avatar.  Don't get me wrong, there are a few scenes in Avatar that blow you away in 3D, but there are a lot of filler scenes that are either not very impressive or sometimes almost look ""too 3D"" if that even makes since like the seen where Jake wakes up out of his sleeping chamber at the beginning.  For me, Avatar almost created a sense of nausea, like parts of my brain were conflicted like it knew there wasn't as much depth as the eyes were seeing (sorry if that doesn't make a lick of sense).

Tangled is gorgeous in 3D through the entire movie.  Every blade of grass, Rapunzel's hair and especially the Lanterns just look amazing.  It is definitely the movie from what I've seen so far to show off your TV's colors and 3D capability.",1399593600,4,1464,4.189285714285714

Pasquale, her loyal and very cute chameleon is along for the ride and provides laughs along the way, especially when he's waking Flynn Ryder by sticking his tongue in his ear.

It's not your average fairy tale, and that's not your average princess. I would argue that Tangled is one of Disney's shiniest accomplishments. It teaches valuable life lessons, and it doesn't try to choke your children with the idea of ""happy endings"" only coming after the guy rescues the girl.

1166384,4,7799128836,"Like most Disney movies, this one is best enjoyed by teens and up. The mother/witch can seem somewhat too scary for fairly young or sensitive children.

That said, this movie is a hoot! Beautiful scenes, fun and catchy songs, silly characters, amazing characters, developing characters.

""Flynn Rider"" is a bit of a selfish jerk at first, but he develops into a young man any girl would be happy to have. Rapunzel is an insecure girly-girl, but she grows and develops into a more confident young lady. The witch is not nice - but if she wasn't, who'd dislike her?

I didn't care for the underlying theme of ""you can't trust your parents"" (even if her ""parent"" wasn't her real one). But I appreciated that it conveyed that your future can be changed by your present actions. So, if you are going the wrong way, you can change, and the outcome in the end will be different than it appeared it would be.

I thought the characters were hilarious. Especially the bandits and the horse. Makes me want to buy a cast-iron frying pan ;)

All-in-all, this movie has some drawbacks, but it is also extremely fun and interesting for teens and up.",1396828800,,1134,4.594059405940594

1166884,5,7799128836,"Disney Studios 50th full length animated feature film Tangled is a landmark film for the studio.  Disney has come a long way since they started producing animation. When comparing Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to Tangled you can see some similarities and also some huge differences  Tangled has become one of my favorite Disney films, it has heart, it's clever and also like all great Disney films, a very scary villain (and an extremely funny sidekick!). The CGI animation in this film is amazing and the Blu Ray transfer is sparkling and flawless. The bonuses aren't extensive, but interesting, Disney has dropped the ball in this area with their newer titles. (Why you ask? So they can release a ""super duper"" edition a few years from now, that's why. :-( )

Tangled has everything that made Disney great and everything that Disney has become, both good and bad and if you're looking to own it, the Blu Ray is the way to go.",1394928000,,929,4.652439024390244

After watching Frozen and walking away with a smile but also with a clear understanding it was a movie for children, Tangled left me convinced there is Disney animation out there that can tell a profound story and be great fun for children and adults alike. The villain here is superb. No doubt they modeled Rap's mother on a typical vile domestic abuser who makes abuse victim's fault. A genius move on behalf of the writers, and what a disturbing arch villain. And then a full arc for the love interest, a man of flaws who discovers a new self by following a seamless plot line embroidered with humor. Sidekicks shine and entertain, everyone discovers a touch of goodness in themselves, and the end battle and twist are as satisfying as it gets in the business.

Great work by Disney. Totally unexpected pleasant surprise that made me a fan.",1394409600,,946,4.698795180722891

1167237,2,7799128836,My 3 year old and I love Despicable Me and Monsters Inc. I thought we should branch out and try something new. Both of could barely make it through the movie. I know this is fantasy but it is annoying stupid...at least from an adult standpoint. Maybe 8 year old girls would like it but I sure did not like the values it promoted. Even the action wasn't enough to capture out attention. Typical princess movie.,1393459200,,409,4.394736842105263

1167242,3,7799128836,"I give this movie 3 stars. Wish I could rate the princess, I would give her 5 stars easily.

 The movie itself is full of happiness and light (no pun intended). Its a lot of fun to watch. What gets me is some of the slapstick. Laugh out loud is a bit of a stretch. I giggled and smiled at some parts ,but nothing that got me jumping out of my seat. Dog acting Maximus just wasn't funny to me. His presence in the movie felt forced. Also I didn't like the scene were Rapunzel has Flynn hostage and wacks him upside the head a couple of times with a frying pan. Hitting a man in most movies is suppose to be comedic relief, but I don't like it. It just doesn't look right and makes me feel uncomfortable.

 Alan Menken is the songwriter/song producer of this movie... the same guy who wrote the music for The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Pocahontas, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Hercules. The music in Tangled could have been better. Nowhere does it reach close to Disneys past epic legacy of musicals. I only liked two songs out of the film. ''The Healing Incantation'' and '' I See The Light''. Both are very enjoyable and dream-like.

 Rapunzel herself is amazing. I don't think I need to explain why. Anyone who loved the movie will know. Shes so happy and fun. A nice bright and infectious personality that sucks you in. The perfect Disney Princess.",1393113600,4,1373,4.3858267716535435

1167354,4,7799128836,"I find Tangled to be bit violent, that is my only regret about the film. I think the story is great, the animation and voice acting is spot on and my daughter just loves it. I know that a lot of Disney films have dark scenes in them that could be construed as terrifying or violent. I guess the shock to this one was that it didn't take your imagination to put it together... it right there in front of you. All in all tangled is a fantastic film though.",1392854400,,454,4.055555555555555

Rapunzel is wonderful and I love the story - brilliant.  The vocals are great and I heard that a recent movie frozen, wasnf greenlighted for production till tangled was so successful.

So they changed the name of the movie ""Rapunzel"" to ""Tangled"" and gave it a makeover to appeal to both boys and girls. When I saw the trailer, I wanted to cry. It looked like a DreamWorks movie. I never saw it, and even though everyone seemed to think it was good, I wasn't interested. Then Frozen came out. I went to see it because of the actors, and everything about it just blew me away. Seeing as how their was a similar art style and title to Tangled, I decided I would finally check this one out, and although I wish I could say I was wrong about all the assumptions I made, I was not. The plot is boring, the actors don't really fit the characters (except for Donna Murphy as Mother Gothel), and the songs are forgettable. I think I might have been more accepting of this movie had I not seen Frozen, but after seeing that, this just doesn't do it for me.",1389830400,6,1033,4.1959798994974875

Rapunzel was probably a stronger character than 'The Little Mermaid', but didn't have the benefit of a great score or 'lead man'.",1389830400,7,352,4.737704918032787

The witch Mother Gothel has stolen the infant princess Rapunzel in order to keep the magic of our heroine's luxurious hair for her own selfish reasons. Mother Gothel raises Rapunzel as her own child but keeping a curious child locked in a tower for 18 years is no easy feat. To ease this problem, Mother Gothel has convinced poor Rapunzel the world is an extremely unsafe place. Rapunzel, unaware she was kidnapped as an infant, is torn between her desire to please her mother and her aching curiosity about the world. She is specifically fascinated by the floating lanterns released every year on her birthday, which she has no idea commemorates her kidnapping.

One day, as fate would have it, she meets the dashing Flynn Rider (a.k.a Eugene Fitzherbert) after her breaks into her tower while on the lamb from the Royal Guard for stealing a royal tiara. Mother Gothel is away for three days and so she strikes a deal with Flynn (after repeatedly bludgeoning him with a frying pan) to have him take her to see the ""floating lights"". She has hidden away the royal tiara he has stolen so he has no real option but to agree. They are joined shortly afterward by the intelligent Max, a horse from the Royal Guard with an overwhelming desire to see Flynn put to justice for his crimes. But the charming Rapunzel manages to convince the resolute equine to hold off talking in Flynn till after she has seen the lights. So all three set off on a merry adventure, happiness, friendship and true love along the way.

1168847,5,7799128836,"Our entire family loves Tangled, the story of Rapunzel and Flynn Rider.  It is up there with the classics like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, etc.

The story begins with a drop of sunlight falling to Earth and a magic golden flower sprouting.  An old woman finds it and discovers if she sings to it she becomes young again.  She hides the flower for many, many years until the pregnant queen falls ill and the king's men go searching for it.  She accidentally knocks the basket covering it over and they find the flower, pick it, and the queen drinks a tonic and is cured.  Rapunzel is born and her hair contains the magic of the flower.

The old woman, named Gothel, breaks into Rapunzel's room and finds that when she sings, Rapunzel's hair glows and works its magic.  Incidentally, the baby version of Rapunzel is seriously adorable. Gothel tries to take just a lock of the hair but when she cuts it, it shrivels up and turns brown.  She then takes the baby and escapes, raising her as her own and forbidding the child to ever go outside to ""protect her"" from the bad world.

Rapunzel grows up with her only friend, a chameleon named Paschal.  She is cheerful, happy, but somewhat bored.  Every year she notices floating lanterns on her birthday and wants to get a closer look.  She asks Mother Gothel if she can go see the lanterns for her 18th birthday.  Gothel refuses and gets angry.  Rapunzel gets smart and asks Gothel for some special paints that will entail a 3 day trip for Gothel and Gothel agrees.  She leaves.

Meanwhile, Flynn Rider and his pals are stealing Rapunzel's crown from the palace and escaping.  He ditches his thief buddies and climbs up Rapunzel's tower to hide out.  She clocks him with a frying pan and ties him up with her hair.  She holds the crown hostage and says he can have it back after he takes her to see the floating lanterns.  He finally agrees and they leave the tower.

Flynn takes Rapunzel to a local tavern, the Snuggly Duckling, for lunch to freak her out but she wins over the thugs and ruffians with a song and dance.  They help the two escape when the palace guards come looking for Flynn.  Meanwhile, Mother Gothel hatches her own plan to get Rapunzel back when she comes back early and sees Rapunzel is gone from the tower.

*Spoiler alert if you continue reading*

Rapunzel and Flynn fall in love as they see the floating lights but afterward his thief buddies capture him and corner Rapunzel and Gothel (who has been scheming with them) knocks them out and ""saves"" Rapunzel.  Flynn is sent to the palace where they are going to execute him but Maximus (a palace horse) and the ruffians from the Snuggly Duckling save him.  Meanwhile, Rapunzel figures out that she is the lost princess and that Gothel is the enemy.

Flynn comes to save Rapunzel but Gothel stabs him when he enters the tower.  She plans to leave him for dead and run away with Rapunzel.  Rapunzel tells her she will always try to escape Gothel and will only go with her willingly if she is allowed to save Flynn with her magic hair.  Gothel reluctantly agrees.  Before Rapunzel can heal Flynn, he cuts her hair off with a shard of broken glass and it turns brown.  Gothel starts aging, falls out the window, and is dust before she hits the ground.  Rapunzel starts crying over Flynn as he ""dies"" and her tear falls on him and heals him.  The happy couple goes to the palace where she is reunited with her parents, the queen and king, and the whole kingdom celebrates.  Ultimately, the happy couple becomes engaged (see the short ""Tangled Ever After"" for the wedding).

Overall, a wonderful Disney movie filled with memorable and catchy songs and far superior to ""Brave"" and ""The Princess and the Frog"" (the movies that came out before and after Tangled).  Rapunzel is a wonderful princess and the supporting characters are all very lovable as well.  I highly recommend this!",1387670400,3,3914,4.567528735632184

I won't repeat what everyone is saying, but I want to point out that (only the title screen) my copy of Tangled Blu ray is in French. I can't seem to turn it to English. The title screen says, ""Raiponce"" which is French for Rapunzel. The audio and everything else is okay. I guess I got a defective Blu Ray. If you get this disc, check to make sure that you have the u.s. version. Everything else is the same, only the title screen. Lately, I've made it a point to double check my Blu Rays from Amazon because this is the second time that I've found something wrong with it, after the ending of possible return date.

1168900,5,7799128836,"Having a mother that is a big fan of Disney movies and growing up with them I started to feel that I may be growing a little bit out of their style of movie making at least in the animated department till I took my sister us both in our mid-30s to see this film on the merits of the commercials looked like the characters were having fun and that we were both fans of the TV show Chuck and we weren't disappointed we had a great time at the movie theater and it was a wonderful display of classically animated Disney movies wanting to see the movie Brave next we missed that one till we bots the blue Ray that one is a little bit more of a drama than this one but just as good just not as fun but I would recommend buying it both movies I tried to see streaming over the Internet and was very disappointed by the lag so for my mother's Christmas present last year and birthday present last year we bought both of these movies and were not disappointed by the quality of the Blu-ray edition my only complaint is there is really no way to keep the paper covering of the DVDs or Blu-ray this in pristine condition without becoming a storage unit and putting them in a bag if you're going to use the discs.

This is a great movie for a mother and her children and maybe a lighthearted father to watch there is action and comedy throughout the whole film and a little bit of danger here and there but nothing to nightmarish there may be a point when the woman that was keeping Rapunzel prisoner gets her comeuppance that might be hard to explain to small children",1386633600,2,1558,4.193333333333333

The plot is rich, filled with moments that are not only heartwarming or chilling, but also add to the story, to the character's development, and to the realistic quality of the kingdom.

Even the supporting characters add charm to the film.

There is a layered and multifaceted relationship between the protagonist and the villain (which I suppose happens when the villain plays at being a parent) and this too, makes the film one of a kind.

In short, this one is well worth the purchase.",1386547200,,734,4.848

Young girls have enough media telling them they have to be skinny to have value, and there's no reason to put that message into children's fairy tales.",1385942400,,437,4.918918918918919

1169048,4,7799128836,"It seems a little strange that it took Disney this long to adapt ""Rapunzel"" for the big screen, for it seems the natural sequel to the myraid of other fairytale movies that they've released over the years. Apparently Walt Disney himself was exploring the possibilities that the story afforded way back in the 1940s, but it's only now that the company has put their own spin on the tale and released it under the title of ""Tangled"" - apparently so as not to alienate a young male audience. I'm not sure why they bothered since every child I've come across, boy or girl, invariably calls this movie ""Rapunzel"".

The original fairytale is rife with symbolism and unanswered questions. There, the infant girl is spirited away from her parents as part of a deal her father made after he was caught stealing rampion from a witch's garden to sate his wife's cravings. In that version, the grieving parents never see their daughter again, and the stolen child is called Rapunzel by the witch, whose names her after the edible plant that led the child's father into her garden in the first place.

But the witch cares for Rapunzel until her twelfth birthday, at which time she moves her foster-daughter into a tower deep in the forest, seen and heard by no one besides herself. So isolated is the girl that the only way in and out of the tower is for the witch to use her impossibly long hair as a ladder - a security measure that is thwarted when a passing prince hears Rapunzel's singing voice and discovers the way up into her rooms...

The Disney version plays out a little differently. Here Rapunzel is called as such by her birth parents, not poor cottagers but the king and queen of a prosperous kingdom. When the queen sickens prior to her daughter's birth, the citizens of the kingdom go in search of a flower that is said to have grown from a drop of sunlight, imbued with mystical healing properties. This they find and administer to the queen - but unbeknownst to them a sorceress by the name of Gothel was using the flower to keep herself youthful.

She therefore slips into the palace under the cover of darkness and steals the baby away, the flower's magic having transferred to Rapunzel's beautiful golden hair. It is to keep Rapunzel secret, not safe, that Mother Gothel keeps her locked away in a tower, visiting periodically in order to glean magical youth from her ""daughter's"" hair.

The original fairytale offers little in the way of why the witch might want to steal away a child, but you can see the potential for crafting a powerful and potent villain from the source material. The archetype of the Malevolent Mother is a compelling figure, all the more so because her power does not come from strength or sorcery, but from emotional manipulation and psychological control. It's actually quite harrowing to watch as Disney's spin on the character expertly handles Rapunzel with a series of put-downs, passive-aggressive comments, condescending pats on the head, and subtle insults that always end with the phrase ""just teasing!""

After the lengthy introduction, the story starts proper when Rapunzel is eighteen years old. Her hair is impossibly long and beautifully golden, imbibed with healing powers and apparently elastic in quality given her ability to swing, lasso, whip and climb it, apparently with no harmful effects to her scalp. But the teenager is tired of her monotonous lifestyle, and begins dropping hints to her mother that she's ready to leave the nest - but Mother Gothel will hear none of it.

The chance for escape comes in the form of Flynn Rider, a thief that has just stolen a tiara from the palace and stumbles upon Rapunzel's tower as he makes his escape. She knocks him out with her frying pan, hides the tiara, ties him to a chair, and makes a deal with him: in exchange for taking her to see the lanterns that appear every night of her birthday, she'll return his stolen treasure. Though reluctant, Flynn agrees and the adventure begins...

The colour scheme of the film is beautiful. It's like a series of oil paintings done in luminous pastel shades, and there's a subtle but lovely use of the colour palette and various symbols to connect Rapunzel's longing for the outside world with her instinctual awareness of her true parents. Things such as the Chinese lanterns, a stylized sun, the colour purple and the tiara all guide Rapunzel to her true home, and the film uses these repeating images, motifs and colours to paint a richly animated world of beauty and magic.

The climatic scene does end with a rather shameless ""deus ex machina"" lifted straight from the fairytale (it works there, but just feels a bit random here) and Rapunzel's requisite ""cute animal sidekick"" feels a little superfluous, but ""Tangled"" is an interesting take on an old fairytale, giving it the Disney treatment by infusing it with backstory, songs, gags and romance. Perhaps it doesn't *quite* recapture the magic of the Disney Renaissance, but it's sweet and charming and beautiful to look at.",1384992000,,5021,4.782006920415225

1169227,3,7799128836,"Tangled has absolutely beautiful animation. Just look at that Rapunzel's hair. This is miles beyond what animated 3D movies looked like 10 years ago. The colors are so rich and nice to look at, I cannot believe I once that Shrek looked this good. But sadly, this is probably one of the few extremely positive things I am going to say about this film. Tangled fails to live to expectations of it's older princess films such as Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid and it fails to live up to it's contemporaries such as Up! and The Incredibles. When the children I babysit suggested we watch this movie, I was excited. But as it went on I was disappointed with the lack of caring and intelligence that went into this film. Let me explain.

Rapunzel was a good idea for a new princess movie! The last time I saw any adaption of it was, well, the skit on Rocky and Bullwinkle I watched when I was about 8 years old. And honestly? I was more entertained by that than this. Tangled starts out with the song ""When Will My Life Begin"" that really never picks up or stay in your head. Actually, no songs do that in this film which was a big let down. I love musical films and Disney's Enchanted had a lot of cute and catchy songs. The soundtrack to this will not be remembered. Anyways, the story is all about Rapunzel escaping this tower her evil mom put her in and some tiara. I did not really find any of compelling or all that interesting but I am sure it is still fun for younger children. Predictable and standard Disney delivered hot and fresh! Another big complaint I have with this movie, despite Rapunzel being a strong character and delivering good messages, Flynn, her love interest, is a total flake. I really did not enjoy his character and would have enjoyed a more interesting male sidekick. Oh well.

Despite the remarkable and amazing animation, Tangled really offers nothing new or fresh to the Disney Princess genre which is really a shame considering I usually like those films and Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite animated movies of all time. The next time Disney attempts to make another movie of this kind, I would really like to see a better and more memorable soundtrack and supporting cast of characters. Not to mention, I would appreciate a Disney movie without a concrete plot and black and white 'bad vs good' theme. But that is probably asking too much.

To conclude, I do feel guilty for putting a cute movie that has probably made many children happy down. This is better than Wreck Em' Ralph, the new Shrek movies, Cars 2, etc. I do not hate this movie but I do not find it to be classic or a perfect Disney movie as others have been proclaiming.",1377043200,,2688,4.448275862068965

She barters with him to take her on an adventure to see the floating lights. A palace horse is chasing after Flynn along with a couple man he back stabbed. The horse is hilarious. The music in this movie is amazing. Mandy Moore (Rapunzel) and Donna Murphy (Mother Gothel) have amazing voices and do wonderful jobs with the songs.",1376956800,,486,4.534090909090909

I guess I take this risk buying used merchandise, but I expected a working product.  Neither the BluRay disk or the DVD disk works- both skip after about 15-20 minutes into the film.  My daughter has never been able to watch this movie through!  We have two brand new blu ray players and a high quality dvd player, so my equipment is not the issue.

It's a standard Disney plot: parent separation, a handsome scoundrel hero, and a bunch of threatened violence.
There are a few scenes of actual violence, and one death. All are portrayed in a kinda cartoonish way, so except for the death, not much worse than my childhood Elmer Fudd cartoons. The dark scenes of kidnapping and threatened violence scared my youngster quite a bit, but the resolutions worked out.

All around, a decent coming of age theme, with a rewarding happy ending.

And when he wants to watch ""Lady and the Horsey"" (his description for ""Tangled""), it's a good day for me. Because of all the Disney/Pixar films, I think ""Tangled"" is one of the more interesting stories. And it certainly has one of my favorite villains.

Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) is complex and funny and a delight. The music in this film is enjoyable and Murphy's song in particular are a joy. Note how, whenever she is affectionate to Rapunzel, she's actually addressing her hair.

""Cars"" and ""Cars 2"" are fine. ""The Incredibles"" and ""Up"" are good fun. But ""Tangled"" really is a joy for every member of my family, even the 100th time I've seen it.",1374969600,2,751,4.474452554744525

With that, this is a very good movie. Adults and children will equally enjoy it. My son talks about the horse and chameleon all the time. We will watch this again.

1169307,3,7799128836,"I don't know why, but I splurged on a cheap used copy of the DVD for this film, and where I had a good time watching it in the theatre, I found myself wondering why I bought the DVD.

Don't get me wrong, it's an entertaining film for what it is, and I'm glad I went and saw it, but something kept nagging at me about this movie.  And it still nags at me.

Was it the message to young girls?  I think partly.  In order for Rapunzel to be ""normal"" person she has to lose part of her beauty?  I think you can be both, and not have to chance your physical appearance to do so.  I think if Rapunzel had been artificially been made into some golden haired enchantress, and all the negative overtones flowing from that were shown, then this would have been a better film.  But, as it stands now, Rapunzel needed to mutilate herself in order to be with her family, as well as lose her magical gift, which was only shown to work once or twice in the film in the first place.  That bothers me.  But, then again, maybe I'm over-thinking it.

The bright point for this film is the humor.  Unlike some of Disney's other offerings the humor in this film makes sense.  It's a little cliche here and there, but it makes people laugh and is harmless, albeit somewhat silly.

All in all it's a decent watch.  I have no idea why I bought a copy as I really don't have any great liking for this film, but I guess the price was right.

But the kids don't need to think that all villains are hideous beasts. They are often the more beautiful of the creatures walking around.
Just my take.",1372809600,,380,4.366197183098592
1169316,4,7799128836,"My wife and our three year old daughter sat down to enjoy this film, and I can actually say that the three year old sat through almost the entire film glued to the screen (and the popcorn).  Tangled is quite enjoyable.  The plot and characters are all wonderfully portrayed and can engage a wide age range and sophistication of various audience members.  Though the songs are all great fun, none of them will necessarily stick in your head.  They service the narrative more than lyrical.

The only negative I can really point out, which is near impossible to avoid with most fairy tales and is at the very heart of this well known classic, is the inherent mother issues.  Not sure how you can avoid the evil-mother archetype grounded in this particular story, amongst others, but it shouldn't be ignored.  Depending on your child's age and comprehension level it might be something worth discussing with them.  Let them know that their own mother isn't out to steal their youth to remain young forever.  I may be being oversensitive here but Disney is riddled with characters that walk a thin line with regard to stereotypes, most prevalently in their female ones: Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Little Mermaid, etc.

With all that warning aside, Tangled has an excellent female lead who, though they've been sheltered and left in a tower most of their life, can assert herself and take control of her destiny and become whatever she dreams.  That's a role model I can get behind and hopefully so can my daughter.",1372809600,,1511,4.795366795366795

1169357,5,7799128836,"This is a great movie. Its always a joy to watch animated films . Mandy Moore stars as Rapunzel and she does a great job. Then we have Zachary Levi as Flynn or Eugene Ryder, he did a fine job. Next we have Donna Murphy as Gothel the evil witch. The main cast and other supporting cast all were great. The story is similar in note to the fairy tale Rapunzel, but Disney did a noticeably impressive job adding musical numbers and their own elements to the story as a whole. To describe Tangled in a whole sentence, I would say: It has the Charm of The Little Mermaid and Anastasia, The freedom of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and even a little bit of the adventure of some of the Shrek movies. That alone should let you know that it IS a good movie.
Tangled is a well thought up, interesting take on the classic tale of Rapunzel. I consider it to be enjoyable for the whole family.

Likable characters, a cruel villain with just a touch of morals (probably just acting) that almost make her pitiable and a classic fairy tale.
I've waited for Rapunzel since I was a child and even though this changes the tale around, it's still one of the best Disney movies in my opinion. I was very skeptical when I heard it was going CG instead of 2d, but Rapunzel's hair couldn't look better! While I'll never stop loving the 2d Disney films, if these CG ones are made with the same quality as Tangled, I'm okay with a few of them being made too.",1369699200,,706,4.315789473684211

1169503,3,7799128836,"Rapunzel is a good movie and I like it, but it's just doesn't have alot of elements that really stood out for me or makes me
want to fall in love and watch it again.
The comedy was a bit over the top. Now don't get me wrong...Rapunzel is a very likeable character. She's really cute in the likeness of Ariel
and even displays that same curiosity behavior like her. She can do amazing things with her hair. I just find that
the movie itself is terribly overhyped. Do I think it's as good as the 90s films (the renaissance era)?
Nope...it's FAR from it.
It doesn't even come close to the lion king, beauty and the beast, hunchback, or aladdin. Aladdin and TLK were
waaay more funnier than this movie plus the songs from the older ones were much more iconic and memorable.
There's nothing truly memorable in this one. I would say it's a tad bit better than sleeping beauty.
I thought the scenes with Mother Gothel and the ending were the best ones in the film and
why I would give it at least 3 stars. I don't completely hate this film but I don't completely
love it either. I want to pinpoint the main problems of what I found in this film and what I felt was really lacking:

HUMOR: The movie relies too much on comedy in that I felt it was overdone. At times, it felt more like Shrek. It's like they showcased that in every
scene whereas the older Disney films kept the comedy to a minimum and focused more on the serious parts.
Examples: The Hunchback Of Notre Dame, The Lion King, and Beauty And The Beast. I think the comedy fit in more
with Aladdin and Hercules because they didn't dealt with darker themes.  I found movies like Aladdin and
The Lion King and maybe even Hercules to be far more funnier than this film.
I felt that some of the scenes came off as
cheesy and lame. I think the only funny moment for me was when Rapunzel kept hitting Flynn Ryder with the pan.

CHARACTERS: I actually thought Mother Gothel was the best one in the film and she far outshines the characters in the movie.
I just think the rest of the characters don't have nearly the wit and charisma like the ones in the older movies.
Rapunzel is okay. I think the fact that she's artistic and sheltered reminded me more of myself and Quasimodo.
Both of their parental figures would often tell them how they wouldn't fit in with society and that society
would be a threat to them. I think Mandy Moore gave a good job providing the voice for Rapunzel.
But if I have to compare her to other Disney princesses, I choose Belle, Jasmine, Ariel, and Tiana over her.
 Pascal? Okay..but he doesn't even compare to Aladdin's Abu or Ariel's Sebastian.
They definitely had more character and fondness about them. Flynn?? Not really my favorite at all. Did not
care for him at all. I didn't like how Disney changed his character from
a prince to some lame thief named Flynn Ryder. One of the reasons why I choose Barbie's version of Rapunzel
over this! They at least still stick with the originals instead of trying to sound so hip and cool like what
Disney is doing.
 Prince Stefan sounds waaaay more appealing than some stupid Flynn Ryder.
 He has no charm or charisma like the other male leads in the past.
 I much prefer Aladdin, the genie, mufasa, simba, and even my boo Quasimodo over him!!! He just doesn't have any special qualities
that make me want to fall in love with him. Maximus? I like him...he was funny at times. I have to take notice
that aside from the mental abuse and using Rapunzel for her selfish gain, I couldn't take Mother Gothel that
seriously as a villain like with Frollo or The Evil Step Queen. There were times where she seems likeable when
she shows affection to Rapunzel just like any real, loving mother would.

MUSIC: ""I See The Light"" and ""Mother Knows Best"" were the ones that only stood out for me. Most of the songs
were just modern pop songs that didn't feel classic or magical. Neither catchy or memorable. They could have
taken a cue from the Hunchback of Notre Dame songs. The Princess and The Frog songs have more a classy, jazzy feeling and
fit in more with the movie rather than relying on humor.

SETTING: Felt too modernized for a historical setting. In fact, it feels like watching Shrek. What I liked
from the older films was that they showed more culture. Like The Beauty and The Beast and Hunchback of Notre Dame showed
French culture. The Lion King showed African culture and wildlife. Pocahontas showed Native American culture.
Aladdin showed the Arabic/Middle Eastern culture. The songs of the Little Mermaid reflect the Caribbean culture.
The Princess and The Frog showed New Orleans/Jazz culture. What culture does Tangled have that we could learn
and reflect on? I really couldn't help how Tangled seem to be reminiscent of Sleeping Beauty like when Rapunzel
was kidnapped and was raised by a witch just for 18 years...just like how Princess Aurora was kidnapped and raised
by fairies for 16 years.",1364688000,3,4925,4.512331838565022

While the movie has some redeeming elements such as the heroine and her bravery, the hilarious horse character, and some other worthy features, please don't show it to kids under about age 8.

I don't remember even really noticing Tangled when it came out, I think if I did see the trailer, I may have completely over looked it, because it looked like a disney-dreamworks-shrek attempt filled with PG jokes. (which I can appreciate if it's well made, but didn't seem to go good with a Disney princess movie)

But when I stumbled (pretty much by accident) on this movie because of a Christmas gift this last year, I was blown away.  The story, pacing, music, everything is so good.  You can really tell that lots of people, spent lots of time, putting lots of attention on this movie.  There were some distractions - sometimes the dialogue was a little out of place (think southern Californian slang spoken in a 1780's fairy tale world) but it was very minor and for better or for worse was very funny.  The whole thing felt like a classic Disney movie like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, or The Little Mermaid, with that much attention to story, charm, character, music, and 'Disney magic', but with modern polish on it.  This 'modern polish', I think is what gives the movie lasting quality.  It's definitely a movie you can watch over and over, because there's so much attention to detail.  The movie moves with no drag from scene to scene - everything is important, and somehow the mix of classic 2D Disney design with the 3D CGI gives the characters and the fairy tale world they live in such a pleasant feeling that you'll want to visit it over and over again.

The Indiana Jones adventure scenes are what first got my attention,....then the warm, developed characters and story got me hooked, and it's the CGI and attention to detail that will make me watch this again and again, knowing I'll notice something new each time.

Easy, 5 stars.",1360195200,,2056,4.590163934426229

1169684,4,7799128836,"Disney has made some great films (Sleeping Beauty, The Lion King), a lot of good films (Mulan, Beauty and the Beast) and some bad films (The Black Cauldron).
Tangled isn't great - it won't achieve cartoon immortality like Snow White, but boy is it hilarious!

The first reason it succeeds are the characters, namely the main protagonist ""Flynn Rider"", a.k.a. Eugene Sebastian. Flynn is extremely entertaining, both to young kids and adults.  One can't help but crack up at Flynn's ""Smoulder"" or his conversations with Rapunzel that often go like this:
Rapunzel: ""Something brought you here...fate...destiny...""
Flynn: ""A horse.""

Rapunzel is good too - the filmmakers found a mix of damsel-in-distress and action heroine that works. The antagonist role is filled by Mother Gothel - a ample villain without that air of menace that ruined childhoods, unlike almost any character in Pinocchio or The Black Cauldron. I particularly liked the Stabbington Brothers - two thugs (Ron Perlman) double-crossed by Flynn.

But Tangled's biggest success is one that no one ever notices.
Tangled is a movie about a girl with 70-foot long hair. Therefore, the movie will succeed or fail ON THE HAIR ALONE. If the hair was animated badly - if it looked fake, then the entire film would be lost.
Yet no one ever mentions the hair - it looks so lifelike, so beautiful. The CGI, which animator Kelly Ward spent 6 years designing, is so good - so lifelike, it looks almost like an oil-painting. The whole film is visually beautiful.
No one ever talks about a movie ""with good hair"", but if there ever was one, it would be Tangled.

Quirky, memorable characters, rousing, hilarious, musical numbers, gorgeous, lush, animation, and clean, witty, hilarious humour boost Tangled to one of Disney's most entertaining films, even if it's not the most memorable or groundbreaking of family features.

5 Stars for Tangled - a fun, enjoyable, hilarious comedy for the whole family!",1358812800,,1952,5.027863777089784

1169708,5,7799128836,"When I say unmatched animation I mean the characters move and emote more beautifully and expressively than in any other 3d animated film. This film was originally directed by Glenn Keane, the master animator who drew Tarzan, Aladdin and the Beast, and his superior animation knowledge really shows in the movements of all these characters.

This is also a very well-made, funny film. My wife, my 7- year old son and I all loved it.

I don't like having to buy a 4-disc combo to get 3d, but the 3d is well-done and convincing. So I'd say the price is high, but it's worthwhile to watch.",1358208000,,585,4.509433962264151

1169747,5,7799128836,"Though it's considerably different from the original ""Rapunzel,"" this version, like all true fairy tales, is both enjoyable and instructive.  The story itself, revolving around a thief and a bright, over-protected girl, follows them through harrowing adventures and narrow escapes, and in the end, they rescue each other.  I like it that Rapunzel has the gumption to engineer her own escape from the tower.  I like it that Flynn, the thief, gradually discovers his inner self through her influence to become Eugene.  The themes of every coming-of-age story are present, as well as a demonstration of the transformative powers of love.  A secondary theme, and in some ways the most important for our contemporary culture, is the subtle suggestion in the story of the mother/villain character that it is at least egotistical and selfish, if not downright evil--and in the end self-destructive--to refuse to grow old in the natural way of all living things.

The animation, especially in the changing facial expressions of the characters, is nothing short of brilliant.  We see even the secondary characters gradually revealed and then transformed so clearly, line by line.  Maximus, the horse, is probably my favorite character in the movie, perfectly nuanced in every gesture, and hilarious.  I kept looking in the credits to find out who ""played"" him before I finally realized he didn't have a voice actor--it's all done with drawing, grunts, and snorts.  I also found myself rooting for all the dreams of the ruffians from The Fluffy Duckling.  The voice actors do a superb job, with voice and artwork blended seamlessly together, also no doubt thanks to the expertise of film editors.

To quote an old song, this is a great movie ""for kids from one to ninety-two.""  It would take a seasoned curmudgeon not to enjoy it.",1357603200,,1820,5.046822742474917

Good stuff - good music and animation, lighthearted action that doesn't stress a kid too much, recognizable stars handling voices, very funny in parts

Bad stuff - if you want to avoid exposing a kid to violence, you might want to watch this one on your own first. People getting clocked in the head by a frying pan is an ongoing plot point. Also, I have a friend who claims the goal of all Disney films is to get kids to hate their mothers. This one may be a prime example of that theory (although the villain isn't actually Rapunzel's mother).

We got the film via streaming HD and have watched via a Roku, iPad, and iPhone. All platforms work well with this service. I wish more Disney films were available through this means.",1356998400,,985,4.430939226519337

The ending is eventually happy but for a few minutes there my husband and I sat there in horror thinking our kids might be traumatized for life. Luckily, it all worked out well and parents may want to see this first so they can explain what is happening in the end. This isn't like when Bambi's mother dies off screen.

1169826,5,7799128836,These Disney films continue to draw in all age groups with the witty dialog and interesting story lines.  Great animation!,1356220800,,122,5.1
1169827,4,7799128836,"It's been a while and I may be rusty, and I know I'm about 2 weeks late on this film, but let's get started. I am a male, and didn't really grow up knowing this fairy tale. I knew Tangled was originally titled ""Rapunzel"" though. Disney attributed the failure of The Princess & The Frog to one thing; little boys didn't want to see it. I enjoyed the that film, but could see where little boys had no desire to watch it. So Disney quickly changed it's title and marketing scheme; showcase the male character! And so the adventure began.

What I liked about the movie:
The Animation
Pixar gets a lot of credit for their films, as well they should. Dreamworks has always been in second place with their films. Disney's in-house animation doesn't get the credit it deserves though. They now have three successful films in a row (Chicken Little & Bolt).

This is probably the last time I'm going to list this on my ""likes"" list. The quality of the animation SHOULD be spectacular. The animators have no boundaries to make these films look amazing. Tangled does not let us down. From the different settings to all the various characters and of course, Rapunzel's insanely long hair. There are a few fight sequences that stand out in my mind that showcase the animation. There is one involving Rapunzel and the other involves the male lead character, Flynn Ryder, awesome!

The Voice Acting
This is going to be a tough pill to swallow folks; but Mandy Moore did a great job as Rapunzel. There I said, don't make me say it again. So you know why that was tough... I can't STAND Mandy Moore's acting. This is sort of a nice fit for her though. She started as a singer and this movie showcases that ""talent"".

Zachary Levi from ""Chuck"" is a great lead. His character, Flynn Ryder, is funny, and this is due to Levi's delivery. The character has to be witty, charming and sarcastic, Levi conveyed all of those things. Ron Perlman, Jeffrey Tambor and Brad Garrett round out the supporting cast who are great.

The Story/Heart
This is pretty cheesy to talk about, considering I'm almost 30 years old, but hey, it's true. Disney has always done well in this department. Their stories can be summarized into one sentence and this movie is no different; its about an innocent girl eager to learn more about the world. There is one scene in particular that has no dialogue that had my wife and I reaching for tissues. You'll know it when you see it, as most of the people in our theater were teared up (it was a packed house by the way).

What I didn't like about the movie:
The Settings
One thing Pixar does so well is create a larger than life experience in their films. Whether its Nemo in the ocean or Woody and Buzz in a daycare, they create these amazing worlds for the characters. Tangled didn't offer up the same. Most of the movie takes place in the tower where Rapunzel is being held captive. When our characters do venture out into the world, it's not very far. There's the woods, a bar and the tiny village. It didn't have the scope of other Disney films like Aladdin for example. With Aladdin, you felt how big Agrabah was, the marketplace, the palace, etc.

There really wasn't too much else I didn't like. I wish there was just a bit more humor to appeal to adults, but overall I was very entertained the entire time. The cast was great, the story was solid and the execution was there. The songs were very fitting on the story and that's always nice, unlike some B movies out there. I would recommend this movie to young and old, but keep in mind it's very G Rated. My wife and I watched in 2D and believe me, it was just fine that way. Save your money and avoid the 3D version, I just don't see it adding much to the experience. Other than that, be a kid for 2 hours, go see Tangled, and you won't regret it.",1356220800,6,3807,4.414529914529915
1169828,5,7799128836,Great movie.  The horse is the BEST character! He's just like my wife's horse.  What a pain but still a great horse. I could watch this movie over and over.,1356220800,,156,4.166666666666667

When we upgraded to our 3D tv, I repurchased this movie since it is my daughters favorite Disney film. Thinking that it may enhance the movie some, I was actually truly blown away. Tangled was made to be a 3D movie!

He had seen the movie before, so he knew what to expect, and told his grandmother and I that it was funny, and, other than the wicked lady, it wasn't scary at all. All three of us really enjoyed it and we all laughed a lot.  My grandson went to sleep during the movie, but we continued to watch it to the end. This is just good family entertainment for 4 and above. The characters are well developed and the action is pretty benign and not scary (as my granson promised).

1169884,5,7799128836,"Tangled is a great movie, as you can see from the hundreds of rave reviews.

Because there are so many reviews available, this review is not of the movie itself (which we all loved), but more specifically of the 3-D version of it. Some 3-D movies have really good 3-D effects, with objects seeming to come out of the screen at you. Others simply display more depth and aren't that different from a regular blu-ray (which is the case for the Disney movie Brave. Great movie, but don't buy the 3-D version. Save your money and just buy the blu-ray).

In the case of Tangled in 3-D, the 3-D effects are fantastic. In fact, it has the best 3-D effects of any 3-D movie we own (and we own quite a few.) There are several times during the movie when it seems like an arrow or an axe is being thrown straight at you, and at the end of the movie there is a part with floating lanterns, and it truly looks like the lanterns are floating in our living room. Awesome! If you have a 3-D tv and are wondering if spending the extra moolah on the 3-D version is worth it, I promise you it is!",1354752000,,1077,4.173076923076923

I'm a guy, male, and I don't normally like romantic comedies.  There are very few I would watch more than once.  But this one, I've seen 3x in the three weeks since I first bought it.  Something I DO enjoy in movies is humor.  I'm less into romance, but I do like humor.  And this movie does well with the romance and very well with the humor, in my estimation, so I'm very happy.

1169963,3,7799128836,"This movie has some good Disney things to it, and some things that need improvement. My biggest problem with the movie is the villain, Mother Gothel. She's Frollo all over agin, although I don't think she's as bad as someone like Frollo. She is a little more humorous. Also, I don't like how the king and queen don't search for Rapunzel for all these years. I also wish there were more animal side characters. Pascal is cool, and Maximus is funny, but he's Flynn Rider's enemy until the end. The song ""Mother Knows Best"" is mediocre. I can't even remember the melody! I also think the climax is one of Disney's weakest. Okay, I've complained about ""Tangled"" enough. What DO I like about this movie. The Pub Thugs are the funniest in this film, as well as their song ""I've Got A Dream"". Flynn and Maximus's slapstick comedy relationship IS hilarious, the main characters are funny, likable, and have good looks. I also like how the lantern song sequence is a combination of ""Kiss the Girl"", Beauty and the Beast"", and ""A Whole New World"". It's just so beautiful. Overall, I think ""Tangled"" is okay. I don't think it's a movie I'll be watching over and over again, but I respect the good stuff for what they are.",1351296000,,1210,4.555045871559633

This was a poor attempt at 3D by disney (as are many I'm finding regardless of producer)that there might be 1 or 2 points where the 3D actually works and they are quite intentional such as a spear pointing straight at you.  I guess I expected movies to be much better at this point, 2 years + out from Avatar (blue people, not the awful movie version of the cartoon from Nickelodean), but not many movies have made the effort.  I'm still buying 3D movies sporadically if it is a movie I want to keep regardless if 3D works or not, but I would by alot more 3D blu-ray if they would make an effort to create a true 3D experience.",1348099200,,896,4.228070175438597
1169993,4,7799128836,"Disney comes with a fresh look for their standard princess film, and a modern twist on the classic Rapunzel. It is enjoyable for kids and adults alike. It was refreshing that Disney has broken off from the stereotypical helpless princess character. Instead of a silly girl who ends up marrying a prince because he saves her, we have a real relationship that forms through teamwork. We really feel like these two care about each other as a person. And best of all, the 'princess' does some of the saving as well. Certainly Shrek beat Disney to the punch here, and the parallels on the ""modern princess story"" are obvious, but other than the character dynamics there is no copying going on.

The protagonist and the antagonist are excitedly complex in this film, for a kid flick. We have a hero who doesn't really want to be a hero. A victim of neglect and abuse breaking from her bonds. The villain, a witch, isn't really an evil person at the core. She has lived for centuries by using a magic flower, which is then stolen by the kingdom and destroyed to heal the dying queen. She tries to take just a cutting of the princesses hair for her use, to keep herself alive, and only kidnaps the girl out of desperation. These characters aren't the black and white cardboard cutouts that we are used to from Snow White and Cinderella. The King, a desperate man trying to save his family, is unwittingly dooming another to death and selfishly uses a miracle healing flower for his own instead of sharing it with his kingdom. It is safe to say that these characters offer enough complexity to make it watchable for adults.

I recommend it.",1348012800,,1631,4.582191780821918

The animation and depth of scenes is really cool although some scenes appeared a bit dark...a downfall I have noticed in other 3D movies. Also, not a lot of really ""explosive"" pop-out scenes. Still, a very enjoyable viewing experience.

The story is an old one based on Rapunzel with a twist having her hair capable (magically) of ""renewing"" the old/injured. Hence, the evil witch using Rapunzel's hair to stay young and holding her prisoner in a very high tower. Rapunzel, since infancy, believes the witch is her mother protecting her from the dangers of the outside world. Rapunzel, with the help of Flynn (the handsome rogue) decides she needs to experience the outside world and leaves the tower. The emotions erupt...guilt to excitement and then the real story begins. Yes, Rapunzel is exposed to the dangers of the outside world and encounters many ""unsavory"" characters...maybe not suited for the skittish kid. Still, this is only a make-believe movie.

1170018,5,7799128836,"Disney has always been an innovator in animation & with good reason.

They have been the best at creating the '""illusion of reality"" better than anyone else.
They have always been on the cutting edge of animation techniques.
They have always had the best voice casting.
They have always had the best songs.

In short-they are the best in animation.

And that tradition continues with the movie ""Tangled""

Disney & Pixar made history by creating the very first animated movie created completely by computer-TOY STORY, & it's very successful sequels, Toy Story 2 & 3.

Their use of CGI, (Computer Graphics Imagery), has reached new heights in TANGLED.

I remember seeing a behind the scenes story of the creation of Monsters Inc, where they had been talking about the effort that it took in creating the individual hairs on Sully's body-getting them to move as freely as real hair would.

This has been taken to new lengths, (no pun intended), in TANGLED, a retelling of the Rapunzel story.

We have to begin with Rapunzel's hair. I remember one of the animators saying, ""How do you animate 70 feet of hair?""

Well, they did, & dd a magnificent job of it.

And not just of her hair, but if the individual hairs in Flynn Ryder's beard, Mother Gothel's hair, as well as the hair on the various characters in the scene in the Snuggly Duckiling Tavern.

And the detail!

The individual characters in the town where Flynn took Rapunzel to see the lanterns, the launching of the lanterns from all around the kingdom, the individual movements of the thugs in the Snuggly Duckling, the blades of grass & the water, just after Rapunzel first set foot outside of the tower-it was all there!

Never before in the history of animation had such incredible attention been paid to even the smallest detail in a movie-like the lace on the end of the sleeves of Rapunzel's dress.

And then there was the voice casting, something Disney has always excelled at.

Singer Mandy Moore, as Rapunzel, Zachary Levi as Flynn, Donna Murphy as Mother Gothel, Brad Garrett as Hook Hand, & Jeffery Tambor as Big Nose.

Every single one of those voices and all the others were perfect for the characters.

The music by Alan Menken, who has been with Disney, & was there when the new generation of Disney artists took over with the Little Mermaid.

Everything that Disney does, is brilliantly designed to achieve the maximum enjoyment value.

I remember, before the TANGLED came out, that the opinions from clips that had been released, were not all together positive.

Many people were disappointed that Disney had called the movie TANGLED, instead of Rapunzel.

Many thought that they story would be completely different & nothing like the story of Rapunzel that we ave all grown up with.

These views were completely silenced when TANGLED did come out, however.

Just as Disney set the standard for ink & pen animation, with Beauty & The Beast, so too, did they set the standard for CGI animation with Tangled-proving that they are the best!",1341360000,,3010,4.768339768339768

Wow, what a wonderful and funny movie, we were all laughing and enjoying it soo much, I couldn't believe that Rapunzel was a Disney Film, I was expecting this to be more of a Dreamworks film. Rapunzel, and Flynn Rider were great, and I was so happy that Maximus and Pascal did't talk.  Action were greater than words with these two sidekicks.  The other characters were fantastic as well.

1170026,4,7799128836,"Tangled is good, especially compared to the Princess and the Frog, which is a total disaster. I am talking about the plot, not the art work. There's nothing to complain when it comes to Disney art, but when will Disney (or other movie makers) ever learn that the plot is the most important point of a movie? Not the actors, not the special effects, not the music -- the plot!

Other people seem to like the Princess and the Frog. Good for them, but more people like Tangled. The Frog story grossed 260 million; Tangled grossed 670 million. Almost three times. To me, that's totally right.

Tangled's plot is pretty good, making the movie interesting all the way to the end. I do have a problem with the ending, though. For one thing, the bad witch fell to her death -- just like Snow White's bad witch! And further more, the relationship between the girl and her adopted mother is too easily erased. No matter what, that's the mother she knows her whole life and the only person she's ever interacted with. That relationship shouldn't be dismissed even if the mother isn't so wonderful, in my mind. She was at least fairly nice for a mother. The girl once asked for something, and the mother agreed to get it. Not like Cinderella's step mom, who was nothing but mean.

I would say Tangled was worth watching. But it was nothing like the great movies of my childhood such as Aladdin or even Beauty and the Beast. I don't think it has the Disney magic.

I think Disney movies are on its way out. Look at the recent disaster called John Carter. Pixar's new movie Brave is looking rather promising right now, or I would have said that Pixar's on its way out too. It's been rehashing old plots the last few years. But I suspect Pixar is going to run out of good ideas real soon.

Disney's been busy buying stuff like ESPN and Marvel, plus building the Shanghai Disneyland. I think it's a huge mistake. They are forgetting who they are. They need to concentrate more in making good movies. For Disney to crank out a disaster is unforgivable. It sullies the great Disney name.

The most surprising of all is the absolute absence of a single off-color joke, adult innuendo, confrontational-moral agenda pushing situation, or subversive undertone; this is an honest to goodness plain-old superb animation in the most amazing graphical stunning presentation I have ever seen.
Every song was written and performed to perfection as if it was the signature piece, the voice actors chosen were impeccable in their performances, and the refreshingly few sidekick-animals of the horse and ""frog"" were laugh-out-loud funny without detracting from the ingenious plot and creative storyline.

1170031,4,7799128836,"OK, it's pretty funny, and Rapunzel's hair is not only beautiful, it is magical. For one thing, it never did get tangled, for all the title suggests. As someone whose hair was nowhere near that long when a week's worth of bed head was bad enough to cut it off, I find it very hard to believe that she was able to keep it so smooth and clean and healthy. Imagine what it must have been like to wash!

Unfortunately, the movie does not explore these practical matters. What's more, her hair often seems to change in length, which is an inconsistency not common in Disney films. Still, the girl is undeniably pretty, even if she sounds far more 21st century than back in the ""once upon a time"" days. This is not particularly unusual for Disney princesses, however.

Just in case anyone has missed the basic premise, a princess was born with long, magical golden hair. It could cure anything, including injuries and old age. She was therefore kidnapped by an old witch who kept her locked in a tower, claiming to be her mother who was protecting her from the mean old world outside, and using Rapunzel's hair to keep herself young.

Rapunzel remembers nothing of her former life consciously, but some of it comes out in her painting, which she does all around the walls and ceiling of her tower chamber. But all she knows of the world outside is what she can see from her window. And one thing she can see is that on her birthday every year, thousands of glowing lights appear in the distance, all different colors and floating on the wind. Her mother says they are stars, bur Rapunzel is smart enough to know that they don't act like the stars do. She does not know it, but her royal parents have made a tradition of setting lamps like tiny hot air balloons adrift on her birthday, in her memory and in the hope that she may see them and know that they are calling to her.

Of course there must be a handsome rescuer, but this time it is a thief who has just broken into the palace and stolen the crown which sat on an altar waiting for the return of the golden-haired princess. I doubt that he knows that story, or he would probably have known who Rapunzel was when he met her.

In any case, the story is the traditional one with lots of amusing additions, including a little chameleon who is Rapunzel's pet. It's pretty and it's fun, but it's Disney, which means it's a pretty high sugar content for me.",1336608000,,2402,4.400900900900901

1170035,4,7799128836,"Looking back on my review of the Princess and the Frog, I feel I may have dropped the ball (no joke intended) in one respect.  I didn't give it sufficient credit for the fact that both main characters cared enough about each other to sacrifice themselves; in other words, true love.  I apologize for overlooking this.

I only mention this because the very same thing is present to an even greater degree in Tangled; probably one of the better animated Disney movies I've ever seen in my life.  Not top three, certainly, but top ten at least.

It's a story about Rapunzel and how she escapes from her tower to find out the secret of the lanterns that rise into the sky each year on her birthday.  In escaping, she enlists the assistance of a thieving, manipulative, philandering bandit named Flynn Ryder (he gets better,) and has to struggle to keep from being dragged back to the tower by the hag Gothel, who's been using her magic hair to stay young.

Tangled has everything.  There are scenes with fun, fast-paced action and adventure, scenes with pure comedy, heartwarming scenes, goofy scenes, romantic scenes, tragic scenes, etc, and sometimes, a little overlap.  There are running gags that travel through the whole movie, characters who always bring a little levity to the scenes they're in, and Rapunzel's mile-long hair is easily as eye-catching and fun to watch in action as the balloon house from ""Up.""

The horse Maximus is one of the coolest and funniest characters I've ever seen.  Utterly wordless, unquestionably upright and unshakably determined to see justice done, and yet, he pulls it off with a sort of goofy seriousness rivaling the vorpal bunny from Monty Python.  No matter what scenes Maximus is in, it always benefits from having him in it.  In fact, I'd say he's probably the best enforcer that the royal guards have at their disposal.

Gothel is a surprisingly well-done villain.  She might be a witch, but there's no indication of it.  She never uses any magic.  She's just crafty and manipulative, and really, when you think about it, that's all that most real villains are too.  On top of that, having very little power makes it much more of a challenge to write for a villain, and yet, in a sense, much more rewarding.  Coming up with schemes for an intelligent villain requires intelligent writers, and I absolutely appreciate the effort that was put into this.

Rapunzel's real parents never say a word, and neither does her best friend; the chameleon Pascal, but in a way, the fact that they can be so expressive and convey such a breadth and depth of emotions regardless, is itself quite an accomplishment.  I was amazed by just how much was accomplished with these characters, without ever saying a word.

Flynn and Rapunzel both have basically the same problem, as characters, unfortunately, and that is that while their relationship is utterly serious in later scenes, they both start out more or less goofy and hyper.  Rapunzel uses a lot of modern, casual, teenagery terminology, and Flynn is even worse in this respect, since he starts out with so many character flaws.  Still, as I said, all of this gets better later on, so it's very well-done.  Flynn is played a little like Bill Murray's character from Groundhog Day.  You don't really like him at first, but as time goes on, he becomes a better person.

Rapunzel is a little different in that respect.  She's likable from the very start; quirky and weird in a happy sense.  Energetic, intelligent and imaginative.  However, even she starts out the movie with nothing to really sacrifice, and no one to sacrifice for, and it really helps as the movie progresses, and this gradually changes, until she and Flynn both become truly heroic characters.

Flynn is clearly shown stealing, betraying, philandering and so forth, so there's obviously a reason for this to be rated PG, but like I said, these aspects of his character don't last.  I was actually amazed by the quality of the music in this movie.  It's truly awesome; even the instrumental tracks.  In fact, it reminded me a lot of Beauty and the Beast; probably because they got the same guy to do it.

The humor in the movie is wacky and weird at times, and very strongly character-driven at other times.  There was no toilet humor, no off-color jokes, etc...  I think that pleased me more than anything.  They had to get away from the Dreamworks/Fox trends of non-funny humor if they wanted to make a real masterpiece, and they did this magnificently.  In fact, I have only two gripes against this film, really.  One small, the other big.

The small one is this; I didn't feel that the narration over the beginning and end of the film was helpful.  It's like the king and queen.  The visuals alone would have told me what I needed to know.  Hearing Flynn talking in modern casual slang over them doesn't improve their ability to tell me the story of what happened.  They could still have had narration, though.  Maybe if it was just a more dignified-sounding kind of narrator, like they got for Beauty and the Beast.

The big gripe is this; something happens to Rapunzel near the end of the film, which drastically alters her appearance, and this truly troubled me.  Granted, this does show Flynn's development as a character more strongly, because it proves his willingness to give his life for her, but I much preferred Rapunzel's quirky looks at the beginning, to her more modern looks at the end.  Still, even this is just a surface-level complaint.  I tend to stop the movie before the ending these days, but if it doesn't bother you as much as it bothered me, have a field day.

To sum it up, Tangled is far superior to the Princess and the Frog, and as I said, one of the better Disney films in general.  Watch it for yourself, and then decide what you like and don't like.  Like I said, a few things bothered me, but I still think it was a great flick, and I hope you'll like it as well.",1335657600,,5948,4.6692307692307695
1170036,5,7799128836,"Rapunzel has 70 feet of golden magical hair that has healing powers. Her guardian, Mother Gothel, stole her as a baby because she wanted to stay young and beautiful forever. The flower that did the same thing was taken from her and given to Rapunzel's mother as a remedy, passing the power on to her daughter. She tried to cut off Rapunzel's hair, but it loses its magical properties and becomes useless. Rapunzel is now a young adult and reasonably would like to see the floating lights that happen every year on her birthday. Mother Gothel refuses to let her go, even if it's for her birthday, and explodes in true evil stepmother fashion. Meanwhile, Flynn Rider steals a crown from the royal family, ditches his accomplices, and hides in Rapunzel's tower. She subdues him and plans to show her mother she can handle herself, but Mother Gothel explosion ensues before she can show anything. Instead, Rapunzel asks for paints that take 3 days to get so she can force Flynn to take her to see the floating lights. Her journey with Flynn Rider will take her places she has never been and change her life forever.

The first time I saw Tangled, I was completely unimpressed. I thought the story was ok, but the songs just fell flat for me. I have no idea why I thought this, but upon a great many rewatchings, I grew to love everything about: the characters, the songs, and those small moments you only notice after watching it at least a dozen times. Something just clicked in me and I fell in love with the film. The characters are dynamic and wonderful. Rapunzel is incredibly naive because she's never been in the outside world, but she definitely isn't stupid. Her naivete and kindness actually helps them cross the land to the castle to see the lanterns of her dreams. Plus her hair gets them out of a lot of sticky situations. Flynn Rider is a cocky, egotistical, self serving jerk on the outside, but a sweetheart on the inside. I really liked that their relationship is built on friendship and getting to know each other as opposed to the typical fairy tale instalove. Pascal, Rapunzel's pet chameleon, is just about the cutest thing ever and plays an instrumental role in the story. Maximus, the horse bent on capturing Flynn, is more like a dog than a horse, which was kind of weird, but still cute.

The best part of the whole film is Mother Gothel and her relationship with Rapunzel. Their relationship is built on a heap of lies and Mother Gothel only wants Rapunzel for her hair. Mother Gothel only calls Rapunzel endearing names like Flower (for the original flower that kept her young) and constantly strokes her hair because it is valuable to her and the actual girl is not. She is pretty evil, but not in the black and white, easily discerned way like most Disney villains. She's more like an actual abusive mother. She laces veiled insults with compliments to Rapunzel and says she's just kidding after many of the hurtful things she says. She also never admits being wrong and never really apologizes for anything. This is to keep Rapunzel under control, but keep her marginally content so she won't run away. It's heartbreaking to watch because Rapunzel lived with this her whole life and internalized many of Mother Gothel's insults. The damage of this is most apparent in the scene when she first leaves the tower, alternating between celebrating loudly and crying over betraying her mother. Mother Gothel manipulates everyone around her and will do anything to get what she wants.

The music really grew on me over time and I've fallen in love with all of the songs. When Will My Life Begin is a fun song describing the many many things Rapunzel does in a day while she feels like she's really doing nothing in the bigger picture. The song is upbeat and fun, but with longing behind the happiness, just like Rapunzel. My other favorite song is I See the Light. It depicts the moments when Flynn and Rapunzel's relationship moves to more than friendship and feature the most beautiful moment in the film when the lanterns are released above them. The harmonies are beautiful and their feelings are completely believable.

Tangled is a complex film that appeals to children as well as adults. It's the best Disney movie since the 90's in my opinion. It's a little darker and more believable than the usual Disney fare because there are people in the world just like Mother Gothel. She manipulates everyone around her to get what she wants and psychologically and verbally abuses Rapunzel to keep her complacent. I think this is a wonderful retelling of Rapunzel and I would recommend to any fan of fairy tales.

But this movie leaves me no choice, as an Apostolic Pentecostal. This movie offended me, and my wife. I find it interesting that Disney, and most people today. Say that the hair means nothing, but that's not true. The Bible is very specific about a woman's hair, and I find it interesting that those who defend the short brown hair look. Over look the fact, that after that happens. Rapunzel is the one who asks Flynn to marry her, not the other way around. Which by the way, is a feminist view on things. I'll get comments for that. How dare the man be the one to ask, woman are equal to men. Said sarcastically, and yes. The mother figure, portrayed as being evil, is killed. But it's okay to disobey, because we don't believe in absolutes anymore. such as, an authority figure can't tell me what to do, I'm my own person. I would say, if you want to enjoy good Disney movies. Watch the ones from the 60's, 70's, and 80's. And a few from the 90's, by the way, for those who defend this movie, it's not even close to the original story of Rapunzel. Just a thought.",1331510400,7,1201,4.248908296943231

1170069,5,7799128836,"Okay, I remember watching Disney movies when I was a kid and aside from maybe Aladdin and the Lion King, they were all pretty much awful. I just never liked them. Of course, I was never the target market for most of them, as I am not a little girl with aspirations of becoming a princess and being wooed by prince charming. I realize this, and have conceded that most of the stuff my girls are going to watch is going to be really sappy and painful for me to endure. However, I have to say I was really surprised by how entertaining Tangled was. From start to finish the Animation and voice acting is exciting and funny. The delivery of the lines is witty, and all of the characters are really well developed. The plot is entertaining and there is some action but it's pretty mild for the most part. There is one scene at the end that I won't mention here but I had some issues with my girls seeing it and had to do a lot of explaining over it, but other than that it seemed suitable for small children. Really though the most exciting part for me is the fact that I actually enjoyed watching it. I get the songs stuck in my head which is amazing because usually the songs are the worst part for me to watch. Overall I am happy to have something my girls and I can both watch and enjoy. My oldest daughter wants to watch this movie every day and if we didn't limit her TV I'm certain she would just have it playing all the time. She likes other princess movies, but none of them as much as this one, although that could just be because Daddy actually enjoys watching it with her. I would recommend this for anyone with little girls who want to be princesses and if you're lucky, they'll like this more than most of the other ones that make me want to vomit.",1329350400,3,1757,4.201183431952662
1170070,5,7799128836,"Tangled is a Disney movie that is a re-telling of the Rapunzel story, done in the CGI fashion that is now most popular, as opposed to hand-drawn Disney movies that my generation grew up with. Tangled tells the story of Rapunzel, a young princess that is stolen away from her king and queen mother when she is just a baby. She is carried away to a tall tower deep in the woods, where she is never allowed to leave, only to look out of the windows. She makes it her home, and is raised as a daughter of the evil witch who took her, though she treats her relatively well. Every year on her birthday, Rapunzel watches out of the window while hundreds of lanterns are released at once; she doesn't know what they are for but she longs to see them in person. She decides one day that she's finally going to do it: she's going to escape and see the lanterns. Meanwhile, Flynn Rider, a local thief, is attempting to steal the crown that belongs to Rapunzel in the castle, and while he is successful at retrieving it, he is chased out of the castle by guards, and stumbles upon Rapunzel's tower. After some (very funny) confusion, Rapunzel enlists his help in taking her to see the lanterns, promising to show him where she his hid his (her) crown in return. They go out to see the lanterns with many adventures along the way, and fall for each other as they spend time together. The movie ends happily, as all Disney movies do, with great musical numbers scattered in between.

I really, really adored this movie. It's not often that I can turn off a movie and immediately want to watch it again, but I did with this one. The characters were funny (especially the palace horse) and likable, and I loved the songs that they sang (which, thankfully, weren't too many). It really reminded me of Disney movies that I loved growing up, even though it wasn't hand-drawn like they were. The spirit, the essence, of Disney, was there. The romance was believable (even though he was a thief and it didn't seem to bother anyone?) and I loved Rapunzel's character, and her little pet chameleon that was very protective of her. I liked that Rapunzel had dreams that she wasn't afraid to chase after. It's a movie that's great for children and adults alike, with real repeatability. I laughed out loud a lot. I haven't had a chance to watch it again, but I'm sure it won't be soon before I do.

Disney did a pretty good job of appealing to a range of viewers with this one, similar to Shrek (but not nearly as raunchy).  I found the mix of story (4.5), comedy(5+), action(4.5), romance (kid-rated) (3), and suspense(2.5) to be perfect.  Note, my kids really get freaked out by large amounts of suspense (they're 7 and under girls), and this was just about at their limit, but didn't cause them to run away or hide, so, just right.

I love Zachary Levi and think Mandy Moore is charming but still couldn't get excited about this movie.  At the insistence of a co-worker I gave it a shot...and I'm so glad I did!

This movie was fantastic! The animation was great, the humor was laugh out loud funny, the animals (the horse and chameleon) were a delight, the villain is surprisingly creepy and the songs are sing-along worthy.

I think this is one of the scariest Disney villains in a long time!  She is so passive-aggressively hostile to Rapunzel that it is unnerving.

The dialog is fantastic and the chemistry between Rapunzel and Flynn is great, Zachary Levi really makes Flynn a lovable, hysterical, scalawag!  This movie has one of the best lines I've ever heard in a cartoon ""here's your pan, here's your frog"" - and it is 100% the delivery that makes it.

1170075,5,7799128836,"I am watching Tangled now while cleaning my house and thought that I would leave a review on it!

I have been singing to Disney movies since before I could form sentences on my own. This movie is a relevant, spunky tale for an updated generation. However, it has all of the old charm of princesses singing about their excitement , love, or challenges, and even the ""bad guy's (or woman's rather)"" song reminds me of The Little Mermaid when Ursula is that lady with the black hair and sings deviously. So many great memories!

There are a bunch of things that will seem clever and ridiculously sarcastic to us adults that kids will not quite understand, but it makes me laugh over and over because of the cleverness in such a great kids movie. I love all of the songs, and although I am not a huge fan of Mandy Moore, her voice doesn't annoy me, it's quite cute actually, and she sings beautifully with personality.

I do not own it, but when they take it off of Netflix I will buy it. I watch it about at least 2 times a month. Usually it's on in the background while I work around the house singing, but I will always find myself stopping to sneak a peek ;)

You will not regret this movie. I cannot speak from a kids point of view, but from an adult who loves to sing Disney, it will be nice to have a kids movie replayed over and over (as kids will do)that you WANT to watch!

Enjoy!

1170077,5,7799128836,"Finally! Disney is back with a vengeance... eh, I mean, a princess! This is the great come back of Walt Disney Animation Studios to the classical fairy tales, which made the happiness of so many children since ""White Snow"" sang that first song... My daughter absolutely loved ""Tangled"" and I liked it at least as much, for all the reasons mentioned in the title:

1. Princess Rapunzel - together with ""The Princess and the Frog"" in 2009, this is the return of Disney Princesses after a long leave of absence, and Rapunzel is certainly a great success. Her magic hair gives of course a great show but Rapunzel herself is the real star. Having spend all her life in a tower she is quite naive and can even seem simple, but her charm and courage are simply irresistible. The scene in which she handles alone a whole tavern full of mercenaries, rogues, brigands and other scum of the earth is a great moment of cinema!

2. Flynn Rider, the thief - he is an extremely likable scoundrel, a perfect mix of Errol Flynn's Robin Hood and Douglas Fairbanks Jr Thief of Baghdad, with just a little something of Han Solo and Captain Jack Sparrow (just younger than both of them). It can seem an unlikely choice to make a thief in the hero of a child story, but Flynn Rider is hardly a real criminal, more like a wannabee - and for all his past misdeeds he is going to be seriously punished in this movie and will have ample occasion to redeem himself... He is also certainly a irresistibly charming character.

3. Humor - well, other than Rapunzel's pet chameleon who loves stick his tongue in people's ears, humor is provided by shovels in almost every scene and by almost every character in the movie - but mostly by the brilliant dialogs between Rapunzel and Flynn. Grown ups will find this movie almost certainly as entertaining as children. And mind this frying pan!

4. Horse power - I kept the best for the end. Maximus the horse is absolutely the greatest character in the whole movie! As promised on the poster this is a noble steed who can do everything, including sword fighting! In fact the more we progress through the movie, the more we realize that Maximus is in fact.. but no! I am not telling you anything more about him! If you missed this movie in the cinema, you deserve to discover everything about Maximus the horse by yourself!

To conclude, this movie is a wonder! Great job Walt Disney Animation Studios and let's hope that their next movies will keep the same quality level!",1328140800,,2487,4.542410714285714

1170086,3,7799128836,"Overall, not a bad film. Not the best Disney animated film, but I would say it's better than the other non-Pixar, computer-animated films.
Tangled is Disney's interesting take on the tale of Rapunzel, with a few twists and turns added in.
This film has a lot to like as well as a lot left to be desired. The story is a classic Disney princess tale and follows the same pattern as previous Disney princess films, which is good. The characters are engaging and the comedic moments add up to a lot of fun. On the flip-side, the film would have faired better as a non-musical. The songs in the film were random, unnecessary, and, at times, a bit too ridiculous. Like previous Disney films, the music is meant to add to the film and build the emotion of a character or scene. The music did not do this in Tangled; it almost seemed thrown in there just to make it a musical or to use Mandy Moore's talent.
Also, I think we've been quite spoiled by Pixar and their amazing animation skills. The animation in this just doesn't match the quality and believability that Pixar and DreamWorks have achieved in their films (especially with fire and water effects).
Also, I saw a lot of other Disney movies incorporated in this one, as if they took a bunch of previous Disney animated films and cut them together into one: The mother-daughter relationship as well as the daughter's wish to leave the tower for a day is almost exactly replicate of The Hunchback of Notre Dame (Quasi and Rapunzel even sing a similar-themed song about going outside). The almost-kiss scene in the boat on the lake was scene-stealing from The Little Mermaid without the singing fish. And - without going into great detail - the sacrifice and miracle at the end of the film was copied almost straight from Beauty and the Beast, from wound down to the tear drop.

1170091,5,7799128836,"I really liked this one and requested it from my Husband for Christmas.

You know the plot, so here's my takes on things.

I LOVE that the horse is his own character and not a side-kick.  He is a kick-butt cop, doing his job at all costs.  He is the typical humanized animal with projected feelings, but it's a kids movie, he's supposed to be.

Our star grows and learns to stand up for herself and be independent and make decisions for herself.  Our hero grows and learns to think of other people and make sacrifices for the one he loves.

Our villain...maybe the creepiest ever for me.  The fact she is psychologically controlling/abusing a child from infancy is just really super disgusting and creepy to me.  So, definitely not light on villain for me.

Cons would be the typical; they fall in love in about 2 days.  Not terribly realistic, but often occurs in movies.

Love the chameleon, he's adorable.  Great movie!",1326412800,,922,4.58282208588957
1170092,5,7799128836,"I typically dislike most Disney these days (I think that gutting a Victor Hugo tragedy and completely nullifying the point warrants outrage and I've pretty much disliked Disney from that point onward) but I watched this film with my husband and our young daughter because it had Zachary Levi and Ron Perlman as voice actors (how often does that happen?).
Suffice it to say that this movie has won me over, was enjoyable to my husband (and brother and parents and in-laws - they all watched it) and is a film my daughter insists on watching every day (she tries to sing although her vocabulary isn't quite up to the task yet).
It is visually beautiful and it's an interesting spin on the folktale (which, obviously, was Disney-fied but at least they had the sense to change the title of the film for this variant).  Even watching it a tenth or twentieth time we stumble on little forshadowings, hints and easter eggs that we didn't notice in the background on prior viewings so there is definite replay value and the combo pack is worth the investment if anyone in the household enjoys the film.",1326240000,,1094,4.639175257731959

They get above average marks for animation, obviously, and some of the character's were very uniquely amusing (the whole passive aggressiveness of the evil witch/aka Mom).
Definately a fun movie too, filled with a lot of humor, and it had some very emotionally dramatic scenes towards the end (but everything turned out well).
My issue with the movie, relates back to story structure and writing. The story just didn't punch me in the gut enough. I want a story to captivate me, to have a strong enough story, that I'm glued to the TV. Not the case with this movie. However, I did think it was clever how they updated the story of Repunzel (spelling?). High marks for that.
My smaller second issue was the musical songs. Cute, yes. But not great. I'm not a fan of musicals anyway, I'll admit. Though I did love Grease, Mary Poppins, Sound of Music.
Was it a good movie? Yes.
Was it a cute movie? Yes.
It is a good movie for families? Yes.
Was it fun? Yes.
Was it funny? Yes.
Did it move me at times? Yes.

I felt wistful for those days of good old-fashioned hand-drawn/painted animation and sad that that chapter of movies was coming to an end.

But let me tell, taking my daughter to Tangled, I was amazed, riveted, entertained. I watched it with the same wide-eyedness as my five-year-old daughter. I laughed, I cried, and I have NEVER cried during an animated film as an adult! (I won't spoil it, but it was towards the end and had something to do with Rapunzel and her real mother. I guess being a mom myself now, mother-daughter stuff always pulls at my heartstrings :) Finally, it has taken Disney nearly 20 years to bring back that Disney magic that I have not seen since Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. Sure, some elements are a bit derivative of past Disney films, but so what? If it works, it works. Tangled has it all- humor, romance, adventure, an engaging story, a charming (and funny) hero, an AMAZING duet that will give you the goosebumps, and of course a great heroine who in my opinion is the best Disney heroine to date. Not to mention, visually it is just utterly beautiful. The lantern scene is one of the most moving, breathtaking scenes in American movies, PERIOD, animated or not. I don't want to hype it up too much for those who haven't seen it, but I just can't help it. I loved it. It is simply magical.",1325203200,,1480,4.522388059701493

If this movie had been made by some fledgling, no-name outfit struggling to survive, it would be hailed as a work of beauty, simplicity, and charm.  As it is, a lot of people are just groaning because it resembles so many past formulaic outings of Disney.

But this one is particularly well-done.  There's a reason you keep seeing formulas in movies:  THEY WORK.  This is probably the best-wrought animated Disney movie I've seen since ""The Little Mermaid.""

There were two things that stuck out in my mind as particularly excellent:

1.  The completely unexpected yet captivating way that the horse Maximus stole the show from the middle of the movie onwards.

2.  The relationship between the mother and the daughter.  This was bitingly, spookily convincing.  I don't know who wrote that, but there's more than a dose of reality in there.

1170135,5,7799128836,"Tangled is of course a considerably embellished and altered version of the Rapunzel tale. The story has its ups and down, and is pretty simple overall, without quite as many twists and turns as even films like ""The Little Mermaid"". However, it does have enough body in the plot to interest viewers young and old. It also has both dramatic and humorous sections.

Mandy Moore is quite believable as the voice of Rapunzel, and Zacary Levi (Chuck) does a wonderful job as the rogue she becomes involved with. A tavern scene provides wonderful short performances by the likes of Brad Garret and Ron Perlman. Max the animated horse almost steals the show.

However, the real achievement of this movie is the gorgeous animation. Scenery is detailed and better than realistic. Faces are emotional and expressive. Action sequences are fluid and exciting, if of course entirely unbelievable. The imagination of the writers and animators was functioning at a very high level in this film. The floating lantern sequence is a truly unique and spectacular piece of film-making that should not be missed. Sequences involving the sun-flower and its latent effects are beautiful.

Criticisms that the film sends the wrong message to youngsters concerning Rapunzel's desire to find freedom from her ""fake mother"" are ill thought and completely unfounded. She never desired to ""rebel"" and ""seek freedom"". Something was obviously wrong in the relationship and she could feel that. Being locked up alone for her entire life was a situation it was only natural to wish to correct.

I was completely surprised by it, and will be getting it.  I really enjoyed the music and the story was cute as well.  It's Disney, so it was semi-predictable in the overall story, but a lot of the small comments and facial expressions of the characters really made it entertaining.  You've got to remember, this is not the classic telling of a fairy tale; it's a modernized version with all the attitudes and thoughts of today.  I thought the music was much better than the music in the Princess and the Frog (in fact I didn't like the Princess and the Frog, I feel that they had potential but didn't see it through).  Even my husband really enjoyed Tangled (and he doesn't like a lot of the animation out there).
  SPOILER ALERT:  I'm an adult, and have not been with a kid to watch this, but after reading some of the lower rating comments I have to wonder.  In the prologue the guy says that he is talking about the day he died, so it shouldn't have been a shock to people.  I do agree that the Mother Knows Best song could be confusing for some kids if they don't understand how Repunzel has been living a lie her whole life without knowing it and how manipulative the mother is, but I thought it was a really good song and was sung very well, in fact, it's one of my favorite songs from the movie.  There is a lot of sarcasm in the movie, so if kids can't tell the difference, they may take too many of the statements seriously.

Reasonably strong female characterization but still a significant amount of silly but sweet traditional femininity.

1170170,5,7799128836,"First, a little background, to give some perspective as to what the Disney animators have achieved with this movie:
The brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, great XIX Century scholars of all things related to the German language, collected popular folk stories, refined them, removing blatant inconsistencies to make them easier to understand, eliminating obviously non-Christian and sexual elements, and began publishing their monumental collection of ""Children and House Fairy Tales"" in 1812. In the end it consisted of nearly 300 tales, including ""Red Riding Hood"", ""Cinderella"", ""Snow White"", ""Puss in Boots"", ... and ""Rapunzel"".
My paternal grandmother used to read me fairy tales at bedtime, or when I was sick in bed, which was often. So she read me ""Rapunzel"". All that I remember of her reading was that a girl with very long hair was locked up by a witch in an isolated tower and used her hair as a rope to lift, with the help of a pulley, the witch. One day a prince happened by, saw her lifting the witch into the tower, fell in love on sight with the hairy maiden, and somehow they ended up married, and lived happily ever after.
The actual story was only memorable to me because of the maiden's very long hair (more than 20 yards) and its use as an elevator, as well as the witch's call: ""Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let your hair down"".
The story itself is, briefly, thus: A poor couple is expecting a child. The pregnant mother craves some rapunzel lettuce from their neighbor's garden. The neighbor is an unfriendly witch. The husband climbs her garden's wall, steals lettuce. The wife craves some more. At his second attempt, the witch catches him in the act. They make a deal: her lettuce for their child, when it is born. The child is a girl, they call her ""Rapunzel""; the witch takes her away promising to treat her as her own daughter, which she does, but then locks her up in a room atop a tower once she reaches puberty. A handsome prince happens by, sees her, falls in love, watches in hiding and so figures out how to get in via her hair. The witch, after many a visit by the prince to the little room atop the tower, finds out. When the prince shows up, she confronts him and he jumps out the window. Lands on some briers and the thorns pierce his eyes. He is left to wander in despair for years, while the witch takes Rapunzel, who is now pregnant, to an undisclosed location, far, far away. One day the blind prince stumbles on Rapunzel's hideout, they recognize each other, she cries for joy and her tears restore his sight. They, and their twins, a boy and a girl, go together to the prince's kingdom, where there is great rejoicing, and they live ""happily for a long time afterwards.""

Now, about the movie:
The tale told in the movie is a very different story: the prince is here a charming rogue, a fugitive of justice, the hair is not just very long, but magical, with life-prolonging and healing properties, and glows when certain incantation is sang. Rapunzel is a princess, and she was kidnapped by the witch, not given to her. Also, she does not get pregnant (she has no occasion, what with all the action). And the story is so changed that now it has also poetic touches and flights of imagination that the Grimm brothers conscientiously avoided. But that was because their purpose was a scholarly one. The creators of the movie worked under no such constraints, and set out to make a swan out of an interesting but rather drab duckling. They succeeded, producing another memorable Disney film. First of all, this is the best CGI animation I remember ever seeing (if only, alas!, in 2-D). The figures are fully animated, with skins that look warm and soft, not plastic-like, as in many otherwise good CGI animation films. The all-important hair truly flows and moves naturally and credibly (and it is moved a lot, being an essential participant in the action), it also looks and feels ""as fine as spun gold"" in the words of the original tale.
But there is more here than great technical achievement. There is also sparkling dialog (by some excellent voice actors), some serviceable songs that, at worst, do not get in the way. And very importantly: no cute talking animals, or even remarkable ones -- with one exception.
Finally, there are two sequences that, in my opinion, must rank among the best ever in animation history: a dance started spontaneously by Rapunzel, in one of the squares of the kingdom's capital, that then grows and grows in excitement until the dancers reach the point of wild abandon; and the scene in the boat, just after sunset, during the launching of the lanterns that slowly lift into the air, forming a floating, golden constellation, and about which others have already commented with obvious, and deserved, admiration. During these sequences the movie is not only a technical triumph, but also becomes memorable cinematography. With them, it does touch the heart, filling it with enchantment and awe, as only true art can do.
And then there is ""Maximus"", the horse. Here is a character that, if there was any justice, should have gotten the ""best supporting actor"" Oscar in the 2010 Academy Awards.
It is both a truly horsey and truly intelligent (if non-speaking) individual with lots of attitude.
I rarely watch a movie more than once. Because of circumstances beyond my control, I have seen ""Rapunzel"" three times already (always in 2-D), and every time it has been a real pleasure to watch.
I firmly believe that this is a movie that will long be remembered for: wondrous animated hair, engaging characters, the two superb sequences already mentioned, and, last but not least, for Maximus, the horse.",1318982400,,5665,4.733805668016195

1170172,5,7799128836,"I like the mix of comedy, action, and drama in this movie. The graphic is very nice too as expected for something that Disney produces.

As you can probably guess, this is not a real Rapunzel story. This is a Disney's version of Rapunzel, which I think is better. If you prefer a real, authentic Rapunzel story, this movie is not for you. If you get offended by a strong female character story, this isn't for you either.

1170173,4,7799128836,"I had high expectations after everyone told me that this movie was great. I think it was only great when juxtaposed to the other movies coming out with it.

As she steps out into the world, she must deal with the trials of life without having any experience dealing with difficult situations.

Her adventures are fun and exciting.

The film features stellar voice acting and computer-generated graphics. The audio quality is excellent. And the musical score is mostly enjoyable.

Where the movie falls flatter than it might not have is in its writing. The humor invoked is rather stale. The characters, although not flat, are also not quite engaging enough to make you fall in love with them.

1170178,5,7799128836,"For a while there, I was getting worried about the new Disney films: too many of them seemed to treat crass, rude, selfish behavior as ""cute"" and ""funny."" I understand that newer films might not want to be as sweet as the older ones (Snow White, Cinderella), but I was worried that Disney might not get that balance between saucy, fun, fresh, good-natured and caring the way that many Pixar films manage (Wally, Up).

I'm glad to say that Tangled does it. Half of the film is told from the point of view of the male hero (who is a bit selfish and untrustworthy at first) and half is told from Rapunzel's point of view (and she is a bit too trusting and insecure at first). Both characters grow throughout the film. Together, they manage to maintain a light and fun tone as they head from adventure to adventure while still showing genuine feeling (the musical numbers at the Snuggly Duckling and at the Lantern Festival are standouts for me). I don't know why the Disney did not advertize this, but the music is by Alan Menken (The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast), and the score is quite wonderful.

The passive-agressive ""mother"" figure is another good character: children might be confused at first about her ""love"" for Rapunzel, but my 4 year old daughter now likes to whisper ""she's lying!"" and ""she's not her mama!"" as she watches the evil character's manipulations. The character taught my daughter that nice people may not be good at heart, which is an important lesson. The ugly characters at the Snuggly Duckling have taught her that people who seem not nice at all may be good-hearted and kind, also a good lesson.

I thought that this movie was funny and smart, with real feeling and hummable tunes. Although I've watched it about a hundred times, I still look forward to seeing it whenever my daughter puts in in the DVD player.",1317945600,,1846,4.621951219512195

1170184,3,7799128836,"Disney shows it still has the chops in this its 50th feature length animated movie.  As you would expect with almost all animation done in the U. S., the artwork is flawless.  For example, Sleeping Beauty...no I mean Cinderella...no wait, Rapunzel (a very good Mandy Moore) spends all of her time barefoot.  In close ups when her foot hits the turf, you can see her toes actually spread apart as they would in reality.  The detail is amazing.  The color as good as you will ever see.  I must confess, I knew literally nothing of the story of Rapunzel other than she had long hair.  Now I do.  She was born a princess, but kidnapped by an evil woman who knew the magic, the child's hair had.  When Rap' sang, the hair glowed and could cure injuries and other maladies, including aging.  Stroking the long golden locks kept the woman, Gothel (Donna Murphy) young.  Posing as her real mother, Gothel keeps Rap' in check in their hidden tower/home.  As she gets older, Rap' wants to see the outside world and gets her chance when a good natured thief stumbles upon the tower.  Naturally the thief, Flynn Rider/Eugene (Zachary Levi) is young and hunky.  They make a deal and he helps her see the kingdom for the first time.  You can pretty much guess the rest.  They meet interesting characters along the way, deal with evil, charm the townsfolk, dispatch the bad guys and live happily ever after.  The music is always important in these movies and here I would say it is pretty good, but far from great.  There are no memorable tunes.  The story is rote, but the comedy is pretty good.

1170187,3,7799128836,"The story of Rapunzel is one of my favorite Grimms' fairy tale. The original story and many of its variations are quite dark. In the original story the prince calls for Rapunzel to let down her hair and sees her on the sly. One day she lets slip that her dress is getting too tight around her waist. (She's pregnant.) Gothel, the woman who kidnapped Rapunzel, traps the prince when he returns. He falls from the tower and lands in thorns, either blinding him or killing him outright depending on which cultural interpretation you read.

Now I don't expect Disney to tell a story like that. It is Disney after all and the lost princess must remain virginal - while at the same time having an unusually close relationship with the animals around her. And, yes, the guy she loves in Tangled undergoes a life-changing (literally!) experience in the end. But for all that, I didn't like this movie as much. And I wanted to like it because as a writer I see a lot of potential in the basic story of Rapunzel. Rapunzel empowered

First, this movie came apart for me at the level of the story. There were good parts to it, but overall the story didn't do it for me. I liked many elements but once again I felt as if I was watching another formulaic effort from Disney. Captured/lonely princess. Check. Evil grandmother/stepmother. Check. Funny and helpful animals. Check.  Handsome single man comes into her life. Check. Beautiful background and story boardinng. Check. But there has to be more than that. We've seen all this before. There has to be a story that grabs us. We're not all eleven year old girls, Disney. Come on. Get out of the rut.

Perfect example. In the beginning of the movie Rapunzel's mother is ill and needs a magic plant to heal her so Rapunzel can be born. But in the original fairy tale the mother needs lettuce (sometimes it's parsley) and the king makes a deal with Gothel in which he hands over the baby to save the life of the queen. Now that's pretty dark right there. Even if he is motivated by saving the life of his queen, and must be forced to make that choice, Disney doesn't tell it that way. In this retelling, Gothel steals the baby from its crib. We lose whole subterranean plots and motivations in this one move. Gothel kidnaps the baby because she's evil and greedy. It's Disney. Of course she is evil and greedy.

Finally, for the prince, in which this case it's a lovable thief, well, he serves the same function as all other love interests in Disney animated films. He's a plot point. Albeit a funny one in this case, and one in which Disney worked to flesh out -- but still a plot point. After all, Rapunzel has to eventually give her virginity to somebody, and it's not going to be that chameleon that rides her shoulder or Maximus the palace horse. Thus, we have the prince/thief/substitute-male figure who comes into her life in order to round out the story.

As far as the character of Rapunzel herself, I did like her a lot. She went through the motions we expect her to and we're on her side. The sight gags of her doing things with her hair were funny and the running gag with the frying pan was cute. We like her and we want her to win her freedom and her love in the end. But the story that surrounds her doesn't click. It's not the story that allows her to find true happiness, it's Disney that makes it come true. Just like always. And so the movie loses a lot of its impact right there because we are never frightened for Rapunzel. Come to think of it, we are never frightened by any Disney movies anymore. Which was not always the case. Disney used to have a reputation of showing some fairly dark things on screen. Or at least stories that demanded, and gave, emotional investment and experience.

We don't get that at all with Tangled.

Part of the problem, I think, is the animation. Sometimes it is absolutely gorgeous...and sometimes we are taken aback by how bad it looks and the jerks and stopRapunzel gets tangled in Tangleds between scenes. To be sure there are many nice scenes (from an artistic perspective) in this film. The scene where the dam bursts, the dance in the market square, the flight of the paper lanterns all stand out. The clothing and texture of trees and stone and water are phenomenal. But the characters themselves...well, sometimes they look kind of rubbery. Like walking dolls made out of wax. I was disappointed in that. If you're going to go the limit to make clothing have proper texture, and move correctly upon the frame, then why not make the skin and shading on the characters more realistic as well?

The music was another big let down. None of the songs were memorable. Even Rapunzel's healing song doesn't stick with you, and that song, more than any other, ties the arc of the film together. Most of the humor works and some falls flat. But that's Disney and that's their trademark and they're not going to let it go no matter how much we groan. At least we see some effort at background and characterization for many of the secondary characters. That helps round out many of the other flaws.

Not surprisingly, the one character that really stands out (and takes the stage away from Rapunzel when they're together) is Gothel. This is where Disney shines.  If there's one thing Disney knows it's ""evil stepmother"" and how to represent her as a multi-facted and three-dimensional character who is cruel, cunning, and manipulative. As much as I like Rapunzel, and the idea of story potential about Rapunzel, as a professional writer I am here to tell you that a story about Gothel is much more interesting. But, once again, we are limited by Disney and the parameters they set up for every film they make. We will never see a story about Gothel, or Rapunzel for that matter, the way it should be told from Disney. It's not what they do.

As I said earlier I really wanted to like this film. But there's too much missing or awkward about it, or worse yet, formulaic. Tangled was billed as the 50th animated film by Disney. In all that time they have made groundbreaking strides in the technical department. But the story of Tangled is like every other Lonely Princess story we've seen from Disney and that, more than anything else, is why I can't recommend it.",1316563200,3,6250,4.535936113575866

Rapunzel's fake mom (Mother Gothel) also threatens characters with a knife and toward the end of the movie even stabs the young man (Flynn) that Rapunzel has fallen in love with, nearly killing him.

There are some less scary, but violent scenes as well, though they're not gory.

For older kids and adults it's a very good movie, which is why I've rated it 5 stars.

1170209,3,7799128836,"How do you tell the traditional fairy tale - princess locked away in a tower only to be rescued by dashing hero - in a CGI format for modern audiences?  The answer is...Tangled.

The staples are all here: the adorably wide-eyed princess Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), the handsome rogue Flynn (as in Errol) Rider (Zachary Levi), the villainous stepmother Gothel (Donna Murphy), and two heroic critters - Maximus the lawful good warhorse and Pascal the chameleon (voice by Frank Welker, master of the entire animal-voiced kingdom). A magical flower falls to earth that has restorative powers that heals the wounded and promise eternal youth, but when the queen's childbirth becomes...difficult, the flower is turned into a poultice, bestowing its curative effects on the young princess. The problem is that Mother Gothel was using the flower to keep her eternally youthful and, upon realizing that Rapunzel's hair now has the same powers, kidnaps the girl and raises the child as her own.

Whew.  Got all that?  Early on, it becomes clear Gothel is blessed with superhuman abilities to do evil things.  She is basically an old lady who really, really likes being youthful.  We never get any insight as to why this is - she never flirts with anybody, so it's surely not for the obvious reasons - and so Gothel becomes a cipher helped conveniently by the plot.  She gets the drop on two huge thugs! Tangled was obviously uncomfortable turning Gothel into another witch, but I kept hoping she had some magical tricks up her sleeve.

Speaking of Gothel, she acts like Faye Dunaway from Mommy Dearest and looks like Cher. She is manipulative, loving, protective, and saps her daughter's self-esteem at every turn.  Gothel is, in other words, a post-modern villain palatable to audiences who are unlikely to accept a stepmother that managed to keep her daughter in a tower for nearly two decades. And yet, once Gothel's secret is out she transforms into an unrepentant harpy.

Gothel's manipulative skills are at their peak when she sings ""Mother Knows Best.""  Given the breathtaking old-school style of animation the film invokes, it's a shame that the music simply can't keep up. The actors rarely launch into full-throated song, preferring instead to half-talk, half-sing their way into and out of what should be true theatrics.  In fact, Tangled at times feels like a Broadway play, unwilling to go all-out because the director fears his cast can't hit the high notes.  There's not a single memorable song in Tangled's hairnet.

Flynn Rider has his own problems.  His age is indecipherable, but it's certainly older than eighteen-year-old Rapunzel. He's been around long enough to have a reputation as a lady's man and an accomplished thief, which makes him old enough to know better, but never mind that. Rider narrates the tale but rarely hasn't much of interest to say- his narration could have been removed completely without affecting the story.  Also, Rider's a world class jerk, backstabbing his partners in crime for no other reason than greed.  Even the other characters point out that his dream (to have a private island with piles of money) is terrible. Rider eventually gets it knocked into his head (literally) that Rapunzel is his dream...which is a bit of an uncomfortable message (you're either greedy or utterly devoted to your spouse), but not unexpected for a Disney film.

Just about every character in Tangled has a surprising dark streak that saps their fairy-tale qualities.  Maximus is willing to slit Rider's throat, Pascal gleefully defenestrates an old lady, and even Rapunzel turns on her formerly beloved stepmother in the blink of an eye. The most lovable characters are the self-confessed rogues at the Snugly Duckling.

Tangled wants to have it both ways - edgy and innocent, fairy-tale and girl power - but ends up somewhere in between.  It's got all the right ingredients, but they don't quite (hair?) gel.",1314748800,7,3930,5.0046082949308754
1170210,5,7799128836,"In Disney's long line of animated feature films, Mother Gothel just may be its most passive aggressive big bad. It's interesting to note that Mother Gothel, for a witch, doesn't really exhibit much magical mojo. Instead she manipulates people by applying that vile eldritch technique popularly known as psychology. To me, this makes her more memorable. I think guilt trips and ego tilting are more deadly than dragons and ogres.

""Once upon a time a single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens. And from this small drop of sun grew a magic golden flower. It had the ability to heal the sick and injured."" It's how the fairy tale begins. Except that Mother Gothel, selfish witch, got to it first and proceeded to harvest the petals to rejuvenate her youth. When the Queen of the land falls ill during her pregnancy, a desperate search unearths the golden flower. The Queen's health improves dramatically and she gives birth to a baby daughter whose hair unfurls long and golden and imbued with the enchanted flower's properties. Mother Gothel, an opportunist, promptly steals away with the baby. So it happens that, each year after, on their vanished child's birthday, the king and queen and all in the kingdom loose thousands of floating lantern lights into the night sky in hopes that they would guide the lost princess back home. Crazy thing, many years would elapse, but this far-fetched, wistful plan actually will work.

In a remote forest, confined in a hidden tower, Rapunzel gazes out each day, dreaming big dreams, open to adventure, longing to see the world. Obedient child that she is, Rapunzel heeds her mother's behest that she not venture outside, the world being too perilous for the likes of her. For years Rapunzel has made the best of it, carving out her own little world but marveling, always marveling, at the mysterious floating lights which emerge each year on her birthday. On her eighteenth birthday, her hope is that her mother will at last allow her a measure of freedom. It's cramped in that tower, what with her 70-foot-long tresses taking up a lot of room. Her hair has never been cut, lest it loses its uncanny properties.

""Flower, gleam and glow, let your power shine. Make the clock reverse. Bring back what once was mine... what once was mine."" It's what her mother, Mother Gothel, croons to her whenever she visits Rapunzel at the tower, combing her hair. It doesn't enter Rapunzel's thoughts that Mother Gothel fosters ulterior motives. Why would she? But there's a rebellious streak in Rapunzel. And when the dashing (but vain) bandit Eugene Fritzherbert - er, Flynn Rider stumbles onto her tower, she seizes this opportunity to embark on a forbidden road trip, with Flynn Rider serving as her guide. She hopes to track down the source of those floating lights.

Disney did us a solid by trotting out TANGLED for its milestone 50th animated film. This is an instant classic, a top notch animated tale with something for the kids and the grown-ups. I think I'm past the stage of going gaga over Disney or Pixar's animated virtuosity. Nowadays, I expect it. Still, the fabulous scene in which our leads are on a boat watching the rise of the lantern lights is one of the most moving and spectacular moments Disney has ever produced. And you have to laud the work that the animators put into making Rapunzel's expressive hair come to life. The laughs come plenty, with Rapunzel's animal friends predictably delivering much of the humor, although Zachary Levi, who voices Flynn Rider, occasionally contributes an arch one-liner, including the bit about the smolder. Broadway vet Donna Murphy is very good as Mother Gothel who alternates from faux cheeriness to openly manipulative. Another fun character is Maximus, the proud and tenacious Royal Guard's stallion. You have to admire how this dedicated steed goes above and beyond to apprehend the wanted Flynn Rider. There's also a shy chameleon lizard who tries to look after Rapunzel.

Mandy Moore anchors the movie. She's tremendous in inhabiting the role of Rapunzel; her voice is ideally suited to playing a high-spirited and inquisitive Disney princess (a princess who swings a mean frying pan). I'm probably dissing Mandy Moore's live action rsum, but this may be the most disarming performance she's done in cinema. Sorry, Mandy.

For all its hip sensibilities, TANGLED still clings to Disney's traditional themes, which I think is a good move. Too much adult snarkiness could've undermined the sweetness and the heart of the story. And this story does have heart, to go along with a sweet, relatable romance, Mother Gothel's showstopping tune ""Mother Knows Best,"" wet wi11ies, a pack of Viking ruffians to stir the plot whenever it threatens to bog down, and a thoughtful curveball ending. And a broken smolder.

So, finally I broke down and bought the movie and now I love it!!

The story is great and Repunzel (played wonderfully by Mandy Moore) isn't your typical disney princess.  She's not some air-head bimbo waiting for a charming prince to come rescue her.  In fact, that's not even important to her.  What is important to her however, is that she be able to see the beautiful ""stars"" that are seen only on her birthday.  And seeing as her 18th birthay is the next day, she wants for her mother to let her out of the tower so she can finally see the ""stars"" up close for the first time.  But her mother who is actually the evil Mother Gothel (played by Donna Murphy) won't hear of it.  And the reason she won't let her go is because if she lets Repunzel go, she'll lose her youth because its Repunzel's long, flowing, golden hair, that keeps her young.

So enter Flynn Rider (played by Chucks Zack Levi) a self-absorbed jerk who thinks the world revolves around him.  One day as fate would have it, he's running through the forest trying to keep two thugs who are chasing him; from getting their hands on a crown that's hidden in his satchel.  While trying to run from the two thugs, he comes upon Repunzel's tower although he doesn't know it, and climbs into the tower to get away from his pursuers.  Where he is whacked on the head by a frying pan.  When he finally comes to, he realizes that he's tied to a chair with long golden hair.  And understandably, he freaks.  At that point he confronted by Repunzel the one whose hair holds him captive. Once Repunzel realized that Flynn is not after her golden hair she agrees to let hiim go on one condition: that he gets her out of the tower and takes her to see the ""stars"" that appear every year on her bithday.  She tells that if he does this for her, she'll give him back his satchel; he agrees.  And what starts out as a matter of convenience for both, soon becomes a journey of self-discovery and personal growth.

I love Repunzel, she has spunk and is full of energy.  And although she's naive she soon learns how to think for herself and to become her own person.  And Flynn Rider who is a jerk in the beginning, learns to think of others instead of always thinking of himself.  He also learns what true love is, and the meaning sacrifice.  And I must not forget Pascal (Repunzel's pet cameleon) and Maximus (Flynn Rider's horse).  They still show sometimes and you can't help but love them.  I mean this movie has everything, beautiful music, great songs, and amazing backgrounds.  And here's one more neat bit of info, all the actors do their own singing and they all do a wonderful job in my opinion. And hey, who knew Zack Levi could sing!!  I'm not going to spoil the ending for you, if want to know how Tangled ends; you'll have to see the movie for yourself. You won't regret it, trust me.",1314057600,,3308,4.340390879478828

The depth of the story in 3D is just phenomenal!  We use Passive 3D (Vizio's new Cinema3D technology) which allows us to use the same 3D glasses you use in the theater, much cheaper.  And I can't tell a difference in the display of 3D content, except it is not as dark looking as the Active 3D.

Back to the movie.  It is excellent and if you have 3D, pay the extra for the 3D experience in this movie.  It is like watching it come to life in the living room.  The kids love the lantern scene where the lanterns seem to float into the room and the action is great as well.  I personally find the depth of the picture so much deeper and it really pulls me into the scene.  I just wish I had a larger screen... Someday!

All of the classic Disney elements are there, the lovely heroine, the awkward hero, the loveable sidekick, the fearful villain, and a sympathetic chorus of unlikely defenders. Disney re-mixes these familiar elements into a new concoction based on the Grimm's fairy tale of Rapunzel.

There is nice music and singing and plenty of humorous situations to delight the young and the young at heart. Disney has decided to update the dialogue to reflect current phrases and words that are very contemporary and up-to-date. While this may be engaging to the younger audience it imposes a timeframe which will date it before too long as language usage changes quickly.

1170227,3,7799128836,"I'm sad too give any disney movie a three star rating, espically a disney animated film, but this movie in the end is only worth that. Because the film did have tangled of problems, watching the film I can't but help ""What if"" over and over with each character, and story, point.

For one let's talk about the script, the first script was completly different in pre production stages, the disney company wanted to do a Shrek like movie (There words not mine) and had two girls fall into a fairy tale book. Think enchanted meets shrek, but the script was later on changed too what we have here today.

Watching the film I wish they took more ""Beauty and beast,""  approach, tragic tale of girl being locked away. Disney had done that theme before, with ""Beauty and beast"" and ""Hunch back of notre dame"" making those films more memorable, as well as the characters. You feel there pain, and you know ""They want more""

While tangled did in fact have that, just wasn't that strong and memorable for me as disney other films, I belive the major factor for that, or for me is in the characters themselfs. For me, they were too copy cat, I seen this, non stop these past two decade's.
Example the horse, that comedy gag was used in dream works El doradora, the horse acted the same way, and love interest Finn, just felt too much like Aladdin, meets prince from princess frog. Now I do admit he did redeem himself later on, but I just can't help but feel disapotioned still that his character was written different in the start. Just something new, but I can forgive that because movie's been doing that for decade, I just wish did something different wise.

Because of the many script revison, and fear of not making it's money back the story was alter from it's fairy tale orgin hoping to get the boy audience. And that's it problem, it should been more fairy tale like, follwed what beauty and beast did as I said up there.

  and I blame that was fault of script revision, and when I say script revision I mean allot of script revision. After Princess and frog was relsea and did not perform as strong as disney company would like it too, Tangled was alter in plot wise, hoping to reach a broader range. More for the boys, hence the name change, and more of a road trip movie.",1313539200,,2272,4.431654676258993

1170229,5,7799128836,"Wonderful songs, enjoyable for girls and boys as well ( the ""hero"" is admirable). FYI... My masculine husband really enjoyed it as well.

We first saw this movie in theaters in 3D and I couldn't quit saying ""WOW!!"" during and after.  We even went back several times.  The scenery is some of the most beautiful I've ever seen....and I mean EVERY scene of the movie is gorgeous!  The story is clever and includes intelligent dialogue that is smart and quite funny.  Of course we bought the DVD the first day it was released.  We do not have a 3D TV yet, but this movie makes me really WANT a 3D TV even more.  Don't worry... It is beautiful in 2D as well.  The lantern scene is breathtaking and magical.... One of the songs was nominated for an Academy Award ( and should have won!).

We also have the soundtrack.  Mandy Moore is Rapunzel's beautiful yet down-to-earth voice, and I cannot say enough about the performance she gives as Rapunzel.  (If your daughter likes to sing, you will NEED this soundtrack, as it is never boring to hear over and over again.)

The one very slight issue parents might need to know is that Rapunzel is kidnapped as a baby and raised by a kidnapper she thinks is her mother.  This kidnapper mom is devious and wants to keep Rapunzel in the tower (to be with Rapunzel's ""magic hair"") by always telling her how dangerous and scary it is in the world.  In the beginning of the movie, the kidnapper mom seems to care about Rapunzel, but then she keeps you guessing.  She also sings a funny song called ""Mother Knows Best"", which required some breif explaining to my eight yr old daughter that REAL mom's DO know what's best, but that the kidnapper mom is NOT Rapunzel's real mom.  This idea puts a slight quandry to us real mom's, but of course everything works out in the end.  Mom's will definitely relate to Rapunzel's desire, at age 18, to explore the world and make decisions on her own as she become a young lady.

Regardless, I HIGHLY recommend this movie... One of the best to come from Disney.  If you didn't see it in the theaters in 3D... You need to RUN get a 3D TV so that you can also sit in awe while your kids laugh and sing along with Rapunzel and Flynn.",1313539200,,2198,4.382716049382716

It's an updated version as a fantasy animation comedy/musical with a roguish hero, a spunky heroine and some basic themes about joy and living your dream.  Mandy Moore is the acting and singing voice of Rapunzel and the whole cast is good (even the minor cast) but in some scenes it seems like the evil witch steals many of the scenes with her underhanded psychological abusive attacks on her fake daughter
intertwined with a bit of defensive love. The ending would be a bit of a cheat in an adult tale but as this was intended more for kids it works out well enough and nobody becomes traumatized as a result. Heh. Disney fans will appreciate this being its 50th animation. People who want to do more research about this particular mythology can start at Wikipedia and find it at many other online sources.

1170238,4,7799128836,"<strong>Tangled</strong> (Nathan Greno and Byron Howard, 2010)

I am a believer, and a firm one, in the caveat that ""Disney corrupts, absolute Disney corrupts absolutely."" And yet I have to give them credit where credit is due. Disney pretty much holds a lock on naked emotional manipulation through cute anthropomorphic animals (in this case, a chameleon and a horse, who play straight men to the female and male, respectively, romantic leads) and songs that sound like they were written after the consultation of what's-hip trend reports, rather than being from the heart. All of which is a long way of saying that I really liked <em>Tangled</em>, though I hate myself for really liking it, and I understand all the reasons why I shouldn't like it. But there it is.

Plot: loosely based on the Rapunzel fairy tale, so the main character's name, Rapunzel (teen singing sensation Mandy Moore), make perfect sense. As we open, Rapunzel is stolen from the royal crib by an evil old witch, Gothel (<em>Spider-Man 2</em>'s Donna Murphy), because the royal guard harvested the flower Gothel uses to keep herself young to try and save the queen's baby in the womb. Which worked, obviously, but now the magic of the flower can only be found in Rapunzel's hair... as long as it's not cut. Fast-forward umpteen years, as we're never quite sure how old Rapunzel is in the bulk of the film, and Rapunzel, who has never left Gothel's hidden tower, is bored, restless, wants to see the world, and has seventy-foot-long hair that provides the only entrance to Gothel's tower. Not that anyone but Gothel needs it, and she only goes out for monthly trips to the market. Enter Flynn Rider (<em>Chuck</em>'s Zachary Levi), a small-time crook on the run both from the law--in the persona of Maximus, a horse of the royal guard who kept up the hunt when the humans abandoned it--and his former associates, whom Rider left to be captured, getting away with their latest acquisition--the royal tiara. While hiding, Rider stumbles into the hidden valley where Gothel's tower is located while she's off to market, touching off a long string of events that lead to, well, all the stuff you expect from a Disney princess film.

It's all phenomenally cute, and you can't help but admire the animation, which co-director Byron Howard envisioned as a blend of traditional Disney animation and CGI (and how they pulled it off I'm not sure I will ever know). And yet there's always a voice in the back of my head telling me exactly how much I'm being manipulated by every last aspect of this film. To its credit, <em>Tangled</em>, like most Disney films, is absolutely transparent about this, and so I guess I should give it points for honesty. I definitely give it points for the fact that I just don't care as much as I should about how certain minor characters are there just to advance the plot, and that whole ""the songs sound like they were written by committee"" thing; if you're going to hire a major recording star, why not let her write her own stuff? (And the switch some years ago from hiring straight voice actors to hiring major stars is a whole other rant in itself, and it's infuriating, and I'll stop now or we'll be here all day on that subject.)

And yet despite all that I'm attacking all the things about the movie that SHOULD be attacked is how much I enjoyed the silly thing. Yes, it's predictable, as predictable as any Disney princess movie, and yes, you will know from the outset this film is manipulating you (the first line of spoken dialogue, from Flynn Rider's voiceover: ""this is the story of how I died.""), and it doesn't matter one bit. No matter how hard you resist, you will be assimilated, at least for the hour and a half it takes to watch this movie. *** ",1312761600,,3761,4.701062215477997

Snow White is a beautiful movie and was an exceptional achievement for it's time, but if you leave outside the ""this is the untouchable all time classic princess story"" factor, you will find that these two musicals are similar in many ways (the hilarious and visually stunning singing act performed by the criminal gang in the Little Duck resembles so much the Silly Song act), the biggest difference being that Tangled ads an adventurous side to the story wich makes it both appealing to girls and boys, my four year old boy gets bored with Snow White but enjoys Tangled from start to end. All the singing acts are excellent and deserve to be staged in Broadway (no kidding). It simply haves the perfect balance between excellent storyline, caracter development, humor and stunning visuals (you really have to see in 3D the scene where Maximus destroys the dam!!!!).

1170244,4,7799128836,"The 50th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, ""Tangled"" is a little less flashy and a little less hectic than the average animated feature these days, hewing closer to ""reality"" than most such films - if one can stretch that term to include a tale of a beautiful, tower-dwelling princess whose blonde tresses glow when she sings, and whose ""Prince Charming"" comes in the form of a roguish thief whose face is plastered on wanted posters all over the countryside.  But ""Tangled"" doesn't overplay its hand in the storytelling arena.  There are no fire-breathing dragons, no talking animals, no over-extended action sequences (or at least no more than necessary).  The focus is mainly on two attractive and likable characters coming to know and accept one another throughout the course of their adventures.

The adventure begins when Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), who has just turned eighteen, decides she wants to leave the castle in which she's been locked away by an old crone posing as her mother - it turns out Rapunzel's hair confers eternal youth on anyone who touches it - in order to experience what life is like in the outside world.  Rapunzel finally gets her wish when the thief, Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) - who's fleeing the law and the two cohorts he's just betrayed - attempts to hide in her tower, which he assumes is empty.  However, he gets more than he bargained for when he meets this nave but feisty young woman who sees him as the opportunity for escape she's been pining for all these years.  So off they go to see the world, with many an unexpected adventure awaiting them along the way.

""Tangled"" is a little more deliberately paced than the typical kids' flick - indeed it takes a full half-hour before we even get outside the tower room - and the scenes run a little longer than usual, as Rapunzel and Flynn take the time to establish a relationship of mutual respect and trust.  The humor is gentle and the tone sweet, yet there is just the right amount of starch in the characters of the crone (nicely voiced by Donna Murphy) and Flynn's aggrieved criminal cohorts to keep things from getting too sappy.  The soft-focus backgrounds provide an appropriately comfy setting for the tale, and the musical numbers (by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater) have an appealing Broadway show-tune brassiness to them that lifts the audience's spirits.

As written by Dan Fogelman and directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard, ""Tangled"" doesn't come sailing out of the wings, as so many similar recent films have done, trying to impress us with its postmodern revisionism and cynical self-awareness.  It tweaks some of the elements of the classic Fairy Tale genre to be sure, but it also acknowledges and respects those elements.  It really isn't in the business of tearing things down just so it can congratulate itself on its own iconoclasm and irreverence.  And I, for one, am tremendously grateful for that.",1312156800,,2940,4.830677290836653

It is a bit dark at times, and so I wouldn't recommend it for youngsters under 5, but then I tend to error on the side of caution with young children. Why introduce them to hitting if you don't need to?

Anyway, there are a set of tidbits on the Blu-ray that are also great, outtakes as it were though really sort of clever commercials for things like available real estate (since the tower is no longer occupied) and the multiple uses of a frying pan.

Story... as other review indicate. This needs lots of explanation for kids about what mother Gothel does, why she is bad and abusive, and why Rapunzel is so confused.

Picture quality... overall very good. The 3D works great. Scenes like the ducking pub are really well rendered, as expected for a movie that came out 3D in theaters.

I had multiple glitches (small blocks in part of the screen that were garbage, but the rest of the screen was good adn 3D was still good) when playing, including a total picture and sound freeze where I had to fast forward a little. I do not know if they are from my disc (looks perfectly fine and is brand new obviously) or from my player (Panasonic something 300).

1170263,5,7799128836,"The wonderful thing about `Tangled' is that it instantly calls to mind the glory days of Disney, the years that followed the glorious `The Little Mermaid' and led into `Beauty and the Beast'; two of the greatest animated films of all time.  Yes, `Tangled' is bursting at the seams with love, danger, charm and MUSIC!  With infectious songs that swell in the heart, `Tangled' revisits the days of old, the days when Disney made us feel all warm and cuddly on the inside.

`Tangled' makes my heart feel super happy.

Taking the classic story of Rapunzel and giving it a facelift, `Tangled' tells the poetic tale of a beautiful young princess named Rapunzel who is kidnapped and locked away in a hidden tower by the evil Mother Gothel, a woman who uses Rapunzel's magical golden hair to stay young forever.  Over the years, Rapunzel dreamed of leaving the tower, hoping to see the beautiful lanterns the filled the sky every year on her birthday, but her mother (err, abductor) refused to let her leave, stating that her hair was too valuable and that outsiders would try to take advantage of her.  Remaining in the tower at all times was her only protection from the evils of the outside world.  Rapunzel's whole world is turned upside down the day she meets the thief, Flynn Rider.  Fresh off of stealing a royal crown, Flynn winds up hiding out in the tucked away tower that houses our young princess, and with a little persuasion, Rapunzel is able to get Flynn to agree to take her to see the lanterns.  Obstacles abound and life lessons are learned, with spunk and charm and a whole lot of beauty dripping from every frame (OMG this movie is a CGI dreamsticle).

While the overall lay of the plot may be a bit conventional (especially concerning the `love' story angle), there is so much excitement to be found in this animated gem that one can't help but fall in love with it.  The voice work is astonishing (YES, THEY CAN ALL SING) and the emotional connection is certainly felt.  Happy endings are what Disney was made for, and they deliver a magical one that will make anyone smile.  Each scene is laid out with the viewer in mind, creating gorgeous backdrops to plop our cast of characters in, and each character certainly has a life all their own; even Maximus the horse.

A true crowd pleasure, and every little girls dream (my daughter absolutely LOVES this movie), `Tangled' is a true return to form for Disney; a modern masterpiece of animated proportions.

At last, I see the light!

I'm not a big fan of musicals so the songs that interrupt the plot aren't my favorite, but even those are more clever than in most musicals. The acting and graphics are great and contribute to the showcase of this movie: the story-telling. The story is fantastic and is filled with love, familial conflict, and great adventure. This flick has everything. Disney is simply the quintessential filmmaker of our time, period. Also, if you don't despise the mother at the end of this picture, you aren't watching- he is expertly portrayed as the manipulative pseudo-loving mother and it's a great contrast to the wonderful rapinzel character.

Tangled gives you a lot of that old Disney's feeling, while bringing something new, it has beautiful music tracks and just like the old Disney classics, it has songs you could sing along too.

Every character has their own unique personality that you will instantly love, be it Flynn with his hilarious flirtatious behaviour, Rapunzel's cute, caring & clumsiness personality, Pascal the chameleon's sweet yet tough attitude or Maximus; the horse who is completely fearless and has a serious vendetta against Flynn which is extremely entertaining.

The voices were perfect, if someone asked me if I could change anyone's voice, who would it be... I just couldn't do it.

Overall in my opinion this is a master piece, visually the film is stunning and you get a real connection with all the characters, it's just one big emotional roller-coaster. This film will definitely be enjoyed no matter who you are; child, teen, adult, male or female, if you haven't seen it yet, then I would recommend you do so.",1310342400,,1257,4.752293577981652

The best ""classic"" Disney tale of the CG age! If you've seen the horrible trailer with a Prince on a Horse asking Rapunzel to let down her hair and then get clobbered by the mass of hair - hilarious right? No. That is NOT in the movie and was designed as the centerpiece of the brilliant (not) marketing plan.

I suspect like many adults in their 50's, the last half-decent Disney we saw was ""Beauty & The Beast"" - and that seems like a very long time ago. Since then Disney has done some right saccarine pap, but this clever little beauty is back on track in a big way. Truly beautiful animation, great vocal work from the 3 principal leads, songs that are actually witty - characters you like and root for - and a very clever modern telling of an old tale. You can 'feel' John Lassiter's presence and heart all over it (Pixar)...and it's a genuine sensation to look at on BLU RAY (I believe the 3D version is even better).

Tangled is the story of Rapunzel, the stolen princess with awesome hair. This version is different than most I've heard or read. I'm more familiar with a witch holding Rapunzel captive and a prince coming to the rescue; instead our story here is of a stolen princess with magic hair, a greedy old woman wanting to stay young forever, and a dashing young rogue just after money. The changes to the traditional story kept the movie fresh and interesting to watch.

Some characters feel like throwbacks to some older Disney movies- Max, the horse, reminds me of the horse in The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Flynn (or Eugene, if you prefer)reminds me a good bit of the soldier guy from Hunchback, too, but I think the hair has a lot to do with that. I really love that Disney put music in this- other than The Princess and the Frog, Disney seems to have strayed away from singing characters. Growing up, those musical elements were my favorite and probably influenced me to pursue a professional music career. Personally, I like that this movie reminds me of older movies. The animation is really nice- it doesn't feel totally computer generated.

Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. No sketchy stuff to worry about with little kids, humor for the adults without crossing a line, and a band of unwashed miscreants singing about their dreams. What more could you ask for?",1309996800,,1624,4.612456747404845

It was a cute movie with a good storyline and avery nice 3D environment. The movie is not as impacting visually as OWLS, but manages to do a good job. Disney movies tend to be very colorful and this one will not disappoint in that respect. This movie tends to be one of the highest rated 3D movies, I think that has to be on how well the movie incorporates the 3D effects without being overwhelming. I personally like and look for movies that have heavy 3D effects, but as we all know those are hard to find, this movie has about 2-4 big pop up effects, but the entire movie plays a very well defined 3D environment.

I would consider buying this movie in the future, but maybe after I ran out of tittles to try out. I think it's a good movie to show off your 3D HDTV.

Loosely based on the story of Rapunzel, it stays a lighthearted adventure that doesn't insult anyone. Disney is very much on track these days putting out the types of movies we all enjoyed in the past that you could take the family to see and not worry about obnoxious characters that set bad examples. My wife and I enjoyed it and agreed to get it for the children, and the grandchildren to enjoy. If you like the classic Disney movies you will probably enjoy it.

Spoiler alert:
Rapunzel is kidnapped and kept in a tower so that she may keep an evil woman young with her magic hair. When a thief climbs into her tower trying to escape the law he learns it is not wise to enter without announcing themself. Rapunzel strikes a bargain with the thief to escape the tower and see the town. As the thief avoids the law he does his best to show Rapuzel what she has missed locked away in the tower.

So then i went to IMDB.com to see the ratings this movie received, it got 7.9 out of 10, to me that's actually not bad, so i was curious and this movie made its way to my ""GOTTA HAVE IT ON BLU RAY"" check list. Waited several months, and saw it at best buy, but the price was ridiculously high since it just came out, so i said heck no lol just last week i went to check the amazon price and saw that it was 19 something, so without hesitation i went ahead and bought it.

I was sooo happy when i got it, i didn't watch it immediately though due to too much excitement in my blood. don't know why. lol  man When i see this movie, I was like a kid in Disney World for the first time.. and I'm 21 so you can picture me just in awe through out the whole journey with my jaw dropped to the floor.

PLOT was interesting. Lost daughter of a King named Rapunzel, trapped inside of a tower by an old selfish lady who desired to stay young all her life with the help of Rapunzel's magical long-blonde hair. Also a Thief who stumbled upon the Princess and both embarked on a journey to find and fulfill their dream. Of course there's more than this you just gotta see it for yourself.

I love Mandy Moore in this film, she's still got it. The animators did a great job making Rapunzel look extra HOT! And Yes I don't mind a Brunette either. LOL inside Joke.

To be honest this movie is really good playing with your emotions, you will get angry, you will be sad, then you'll laugh and then angry again. It's an up and down ride. AND like every other Disney movie, you will encounter musical piece where the characters are singing to each other, personally I don't like those kinds of scenes but I'm not complaining ;)

I do like the songs not sung my Miss Moore and I don't mind her voice acting.

There are some scare moments in it, but I actually found this story helpful in bringing up the concept of kidnapping in a very gentle way with my daughter who tends to run away in stores and has never understood why I didn't want her too. When I explained that I didn't want her to get taken away from me like Rapunzel she seemed to get it without being too worried.

1170299,5,7799128836,"I had the good fortune to take my two eldest daughters to this movie at the theater to see it in 3D. It was my 4 year old's first theater experience. We all absolutely loved the movie! My girls adored the entire thing. Disney actually breaks tradition with their princess style stories on this movie. While Rapunzel is drawn in the typical Disney style, glamour has little to do with this movie and Rapunzel shows great modesty in her dress and her attitude. There is a smidgen of romance here, but the romance is not the point of Rapunzel's quest. Rapunzel's dream is about her destiny, it's not to find a perfect prince or to be swept off her feet. In Rapunzel, we have a strong girl who is torn between this tugging that draws her to something that she truly believes is somehow meant for her and her desire to do the right thing and honor her ""mother's"" wishes. She's strong, confident, witty, charmingly naive and yet not gullible. Mandy Moore's voice acting talents here are just phenomenal... full of emotion, spirit, and just the right bits at the right time... truly impressive work.

We've now seen it twice on Blu-Ray and my girls love it even more (they insist on watching it again). It's only a matter of time before I'll have to buy it for them.

My only minor complaint is in Flynn Rider. To a certain extent he continues this tradition of male characters who are designed to be debonair but with little substance and would continue a life of emptiness as a criminal if not for the love of the fair maiden. Zachary Levi does a fabulous job voicing Flynn and you can't help but like him, but there is a concern here that it sends the ""bad boys are cool"" message that seems prevalent in so many places. My girls are very young and I've been able to talk them through some of this and will obviously need to continue to help them see that typically, good girls don't reform bad boys - it's usually the other way around.

Eventually, we learn why he's the way he is and though it is a nice bit of candor, it's a plot device to help us get past this character's penchant for criminal hi-jinks and adventure. But, hey, this is a fairy tale and that is a hyper-sensitive analysis of the characters in a children's movie. So, my 5-star review stands. Overall, it does little to color the movie which is simply another Disney ""happily ever after"" fairy tale. There is great value in the warm fuzzy feel-good stories that Disney has excelled at telling all of these years. Reality sets in for everyone and, as parents, it's our job to help our children navigate the waters of reality... but fairy tales are great places where hope and imagination run free. It's good for the soul.

I highly recommend this movie. Even I loved it... really! (Also, as an aside, the 3D experience at the theater was probably the best 3D movie we've seen.)",1308268800,,2841,4.478764478764479

1170303,3,7799128836,"FOR A FILM that's been in production almost as long, if not longer than,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Princess-and-The-Frog/dp/B0034JKZ3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Princess and The Frog</a>, the film formerly known as Rapunzel, Tangled, has nothing to show for it besides some really glossy animation and some impressive singing and acting from Mandy Moore. While Disney films are notorious for flipping copyright free fair tales or true stories on their heads with their vision or parody of how the tale should go, Tangled goes so far with this concept that it barely even has any relevance with the tale its based off besides the character's name, her impossibly long hair and the situation of being confined in a tower by an old hag that snatched her from her parents. (Originally she was taken by the old woman after Rapunzel's parents struck a deal with her. At least that's how it went in version I read by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paul-O-Zelinsky/dp/0142301930/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paul O. Zelinsky</a>&nbsp;(if I recall correctly) which everyone should pick up and read because its amazing).

---- TANGLED begins with a disembodied narration of Flynn Ryder (or Eugene Fitzherbert) describing in witty detail how the circumstances around the girl known as Rapunzel came to be. At some unknown point of time, a ""drop of the sun"" from the heavens and landed upon a plant. And old woman, Lady Gothel, discovers it and learns that it grant her eternal youth if she sings to the plant. Meanwhile, the woman who would give birth to Rapunzel fell sick around the time she was supposed to be giving birth to her (I think) and the kingdom was at a loss as to how to help her. By twist of fate the kingdom's guardsmen come across the magical flower when Gothel fails to hide it properly in a rush to hide from them. The plant is then used as a medicine to revive the Rapunzel's mother and in no time she gives birth to a beauty baby daughter with sunshine hair.

Not long after her birth, Gothel sneaks into her bedroom and attempts to steal a lock of her hair, but upon cutting it the hair looses its magical qualities and thus Gothel decides to snatch the baby in full and Rapunzel's parents are left grief stricken when their child is taken from them. Rapunzel lives the next eighteen years of her life in seclusion with ""Mother Gothel"", who fills the girl's head with fears of the outside world and the promise that everyone wants to chop her hair off. Upon the day before Rapunzel's birthday, a thief named Flynn Ryder steals the crown of the lost princess and double crosses his partner's in crime.

After a close encounter with a royal horse named Maximus (who, along pretty much all the soldiers in the kingdom, are hellbent on catching Flynn to the point of hilarious obsession), he comes across Rapunzel's tower, takes refuge inside and is promptly defeated by a simple whack to the head by Rapunzel's frying pan.

With Flynn as her captive (who fails repeatedly to charm himself out of her hair and out of the tower, quite literally), she strikes a deal with him. He is to take her out of the tower to see the magical floating lights for her 18th Birthday while her ""Mother"" is away from the tower. However, what was supposed to be a simple excursion outdoors and Flynn's meager a attempt to get his hidden ""spoils of war"" from Rapunzel, turns into a chaotic two(?) days when the kingdom's soldiers catch up with them and Mother Gothel returns early and finds her ""Daughter"" missing from the tower-----

For all intents and purposes, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tron-Legacy/dp/B004K4IZ3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tron: Legacy</a>&nbsp;after it, Tangled is in too much of a rush to get into the meat and potatoes of its storyline to focus on any sort of development for character or story (those healthy vegetables). While the Paul O. Zelinsky book allowed you to get to know the parents on some marginal level, Rapunzel's parents here are just voiceless characters akin to that of Aurora's parents in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleeping-Beauty/dp/B0013ND30M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleeping Beauty</a>&nbsp;near the end of that film. The voice narration at the beginning and the end is so rushed it leaves the viewer (or me) wanting more than what they got. You never create any sense of attachment for these characters, not even Flynn Ryder or Rapunzel herself. And the thing that killed the movie the most was the Dues Ex Machina ploy in which Rapunzel remembers her entire past life in a blurry montage via baby vision. Insult me why don't you Disney? I would've liked it better if someone had sat her aside after the crisis was over and explained her situation to her or better yet, have Gothel do that stupid Villain Monologue and accidentally slip the truth to her.

Rapunzel for all her perky adorableness falls on the short side of a interesting character. While is true enough that she's the true hero of the film and the only one that appears to get any sort of character development tailor made for all ""Disney Princesses"" of past generations (with the exceptions of Mulan, Tiana, Belle and Pocahontas who are true examples of characterization that don't fall on the ""spoiled child learns her lesson"" or ""romantic, waiting for her prince to come [and rescue her]"" tropes), the writing that surrounds the character never lifts her up to the Plato of the aforementioned female heroines. Mandy Moore's acting and singing on the other hand, are exemplary; the one scene that probably made me laugh was Rapunzel's constant back and forth of ""BEST DAY EVER!"" and ""OH, I'M SUCH A TERRIBLE DAUGHTER!"" when she finally leaves the tower for the first time.

While Zachary Levi's comic timing falls somewhere between excellent and bland, the character this movie's PR campaign spent so much time promoting to the masses, in hopes of garnering a larger male audience, is also not as hilarious as they would have you believe. Flynn Ryder's evolution to self-serving thief who'd double cross you in a heartbeat and further more attempt to slink his way out of the retribution that he's got coming, to the man who falls in love with Rapunzel and finds there more in life worth fighting for (besides stolen goods and the like) is just a non-event. The ""romance"" between Rapunzel and Ryder was so rushed and lacking of any real spark that I wondered why they even tried to begin with.

Their relationship never seemed to rise above the ""cute friendship"" as there is little to no development in their relationship (believable enough for me to buy it). The ""death scene"" wasn't even long enough to monetarily mourn the passing of Eugene because his revival happened almost barely five minutes after he got shanked by Mother Gothel. And while we're on the subject, Mother Gothel is probably one of the weakest Disney Villains in the entire history of their villains (unless I can think of someone else), with her only positive points being the design of her character. Also, her death scene was probably only second to McLeech (Rescuers Down Under) or Clayton (Tarzan) in the long line of lame ""implied deaths"".

Neither the horse or the tiny lizard (you truly DO forget is in the movie because he's that small) are funny as they should've been. I will admit that the begrudging truce subplot between Maximus and Flynn was amusing. However, most of the humor in this movie just got a chuckle and one or two laughs from me, everything felt terribly forced or too tried to be too witty for its own good; everything to the humor at Flynn's expense to the amended Will Smith line:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oh-I-ve-got-to-get-me-one-of-these/dp/B00009V7OR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Oh, I've got to get me one of these!""</a>, just tried too hard to make you laugh. And the musical themes were terribly forgettable, which surprised me because this is a DISNEY MOVIE. They may not have hit the nail on the head everytime in the days of old, but to have a film that's COMPLETELY devoid of a memorable theme? That's a first! There wasn't a single lyric from the themes that I could remember after the movie ended and the DVD was out of the player. They never hit home with the emotions, the thieves song was just ""there"" killing time and the duet theme was especially bland outside of the complimentary vocal harmony between Moore and Levi.

Overall, the best thing about Tangled is the CGI, you'll most likely spend more time focusing all the little details in the movement of the fabric and the character's expressions when they speak (exaggerated as they are). Whatever their intentions, Tangled lacks heart and it lacks a serious attention to detail for its story. Everything feels as though it just wants to get done and over with and as it stands this film is a major step down from The Princess and the Frog, which combined everything great and special about past 2D animated Disney films of the 1990s into one neat package. One that left a lasting impression on me. Tangled, on the other hand, doesn't even scratch the surface of ""memorable"" or ""remarkable"" outside of its technical achievements.

1170306,3,7799128836,"To get to the point. What worked: the look. This film is gorgeous, particularly on Blu-Ray! The villain: Mother Gothel is the most manipulative of any Disney or Pixar character, awesome. You WANT to see her go down and it's satisfying when she does. The female empowerment stuff: Rapunzel is definitely the hero of this film, and only rarely is she annoying. The ending: excellent, surprisingly emotionally affecting. The Blu-Ray version is beautiful, but animation isn't the best place to show-case HD.

What didn't work: the songs. A grand total of only two songs were firing on all cylinders, the best of which is ""Rapunzel Knows Best"" about 58 minutes in. Almost none of them came together that well, a real disappointment in an integral part of any animated Disney movie. The humor: intermittent at best. You'll chuckle, but don't expect consistent laughter if you're an adult viewer. The plot: incredibly simplistic, don't worry about having to use your brain at any point. The sidekick: that stupid, pointless gecko. You can always rely on Disney's dogged determination for every protagonist to have a sidekick. He gets kicked at one point by the villain, and it made me so happy! Tangled also tries to be a bit too modern, particularly with the dialogue--it can pull you out of the fairy tale. Overall this film is certainly entertaining, but doesn't have the magic to be a classic like the old Disney or the earlier Pixar films. Definitely worth a watch, you'll absolutely love it if you're a teen or younger, I think adult viewers will not be quite as enchanted. 3.5 of 5 stars.",1307836800,5,1588,4.838235294117647

The Film 4.5/5

Disney has been responsible for some wonderful films since releasing Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937. I remember being taken to the cinema as a child to see Bambi and The Jungle Book, and anxiously awaiting holiday specials showing classic Disney clips. What's more, all of Disney's releases are suitable for family viewing.

While I appreciate all of the above, many of Disney's classic titles are formulaic. It seems like there's a princess in every story, although there are only nine official Disney princesses. The movies feature numerous songs and often start with the image of a storybook which is used to set the scene. All of those things work, but it's a little too predictable for my liking.

Tangled is different.

Instead of using a storybook for the exposition, it uses a narrator. The narrator is Flynn Rider, our hero, and he's sarcastic and genuinely funny. There are songs, but they are short, infrequent, and also funny. There's a princess, but she doesn't act like one. This is a story that doesn't take itself too seriously. It feels fresh and contemporary. Quite frankly, I was surprised and delighted with the whole thing.

We learn during the opening scenes that an old woman, Mother Gothel (Murphy), possesses a golden flower with the power to heal and reverse the effects of aging. The queen is sick and needs the flower to heal her, so a party of soldiers is sent to find it. It works and newly-born princess Rapunzel (Moore) is infused with the plant's powers. Mother Gothel wants to appear young so she kidnaps the princess and keeps her in a tower. The king and queen release floating lanterns each year on Rapunzel's birthday and hope that she will eventually be found.

Rapunzel thinks that Mother Gothel is her real mother and that she's being kept in the tower to protect her from the dangers of the real world. Her main wish is to see the lights that appear on her birthday. Her only friend is Pascal, a chameleon. He doesn't speak, but does a good job of expressing his feelings through body language.

Flynn Rider is a notorious thief who stumbles across Rapunzel's tower while evading capture from the king's soldiers. Rapunzel hits him over the head with a frying pan and locks him in her closet. She's convinced that the outside world poses no threat to her.

We learn that her hair has many uses. It's one way into the tower, but she also uses it to pick things up and to tie Flynn to a chair. The two enter into a bargain; he'll take her to see the floating lanterns and she'll give him back the tiara he stole. She sends Mother Gothel on an errand and leaves the tower with Flynn.

Flynn takes Rapunzel to the Snuggly Duckling inn which is supposed to represent a sort of biker pub. The patrons aren't what they seem and end up liking her. Mother Gothel tracks the pair down and Flynn is also found by one of the king's horses, Maximus. The horse doesn't speak either, but is one of the funniest characters in the movie. He feels that he isn't appreciated, but Rapunzel wins his loyalty.

There's plenty of action during the ensuing chase scenes, and the pair are forced to use their wits to escape all kinds of peril. Mother Gothel is the most evil character in the story, although her selfish actions are understandable when you consider that she'll die without the effects of Rapunzel's magic hair.

There's considerable character development in the story and, being Disney, it has a happy ending. The mix of humor, action and romance works well. The characters are easy to like and there's always something interesting happening.

Video Quality 5/5
I recently reviewed Megamind and mentioned that, as well as aliasing, the backgrounds appeared unfinished. Watching Tangled, the difference is easy to spot. There is so much detail and depth in each frame. Take a look at the background shots and you'll see what I mean. Leaves rustle in the breeze, clouds drift and water ripples. This image is comparable to Bolt or the recent Pixar releases. It's another perfect transfer from Disney.

Audio Quality 5/5
The DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 mix also receives a perfect score. There's a lot happening at times, and every little sound is heard. Background noises such as hooves or running water enhance the experience and you'll hear things coming at you from all directions. Dialogue and music also receive the correct treatment. It's hard to fault anything in the presentation.

Tangled was a nice surprise with its fresh take on traditional Disney themes. There's plenty here for children to enjoy. The characters are cute and friendly and the action is never far away. Adults will enjoy it too. Disney's 50th animated feature is one of the best releases the studio has made and its modern animation style is a pleasure to watch.

1170346,5,7799128836,"This animated feature is the best I've seen from Disney Studios in many years.  It is more than a Disney update of a classic fairy tale, it is a complete reworking.  The original story by The Brother's Grimm is only 3  pages in length.  As you can imagine, a lot had to be added to make it into a 140 minute move.  What was added makes the story considerably more exciting than the original, with an action scene that Indiana Jones would be proud of; in fact it looks a lot like a similar scene from Raiders.  The villainess is one of the vilest characters in Disney history, while the heroine is one of the most vulnerable and loveable.  The hero is a typical anti-hero that turns good for the sake of love, but who can blame him; Rapunzel is absolutely charming.  The scene with the floating lanterns is gorgeous.  Even the animal characters are perfect, as good those in Cinderella.  The Pixar animation is, as promised, much softer than previous Pixar films: cloths look like fabric and Rapinzel's hair looks like hair. Everything in this movie works including the surprise ending, which I won't give away.  A must see for Disney fans.",1306368000,,1139,4.561576354679803

My only complaint is that her name is Rapunzel, and yet the movie has barely anything to do with the old Rapunzel fairy tale.",1306368000,,246,4.304347826086956
1170348,5,7799128836,"Tangled is suddenly an essential part of any Disney/Pixar library. Its uniqueness is in its realistic voice acting and the facial expressions of its characters, as well as in the fact that this princess lives the most sheltered life of any princess ever. Ironically, however, Rapunzel is the most human of all Disney princesses in how she behaves and in what she says. As well, the designers weren't shy about making fun action sequences without overloading the movie unnecessarily so. Some of the music could have used more depth and better melodies, but other than that, Tangled is an incredibly satisfying movie from start to finish, with humor for all ages and a cast that easily makes this movie a masterpiece.",1306368000,,715,4.917355371900826

1170352,3,7799128836,"Fantastic character animation, mostly due to Pixar, and despite the Menken soundtrack, the songs were really forgettable.  I will probably never think of this movie again.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good.",1306108800,,207,5.242424242424242

1170355,5,7799128836,"Tangled is the 2010 Disney computer-animated hit DVD that introduces to the world, the newest edition to the Disney Princess pantheon: Rapunzel. In this amazing comedy-adventure, Rapunzel is a special princess with seventy feet of magical hair and she is kept in a high tower by an evil godmother named Gothel, and then, one day, Rapunzel is surprised by a handsome but silly jewel thief named Flynn Rider, and together, both Rapunzel and Flynn escaped the tower and journey to a brand new world. Along the way, Rapunzel and Flynn meet tough but friendly marauders, and match wits with a heroic and lovable horse named Maximus. Mandy Moore is at her best as the voice of the new Disney Princess and Zachary Levi is as hilarious as ever as the voice of Flynn. The special features includes trailers of other Disney hit DVD's like Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure, the Re-release of the Incredibles on DVD and a sneak preview of the upcoming Tinker Bell sequel Tinker Bell and the Pixie Hollow Games that will be broadcast on the Disney Channel.

We all laughed at the funny parts, were on edge at the intense parts, and some of us even cried at the touching parts.  The movie was very well done and kid friendly while appealing to an adult audience, as well.  The only part I talked with my children about after it was over, was a remark Flynn made re: a little bit a rebellion being good.  My 14 year old actually picked up on that and knew that was not necessarily good.  The kids are quoting many of the funny (& appropriate) parts even weeks later.  Great movie!

1170364,4,7799128836,"This movie is Disney's--Glenn Keane's(with CEO Robert Iger & John Lasseter of Pixar)--attempt and desire to go back to the Classic Walt Disney formula.  After Katzenberg's departure from Disney Animation (and now we have another great Animation Studio in Dreamworks!), Disney lost its way with some very sub-par story/animation with a few gems in between (Tarzan, Lilo & Stitch, etc.)

According to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Art-of-Tangled/dp/0811875555/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Art of Tangled</a>&nbsp;Glenn Keane (Character Supervisor for Little Mermaid, Tarzan, Alladin, Beast, etc.) was tasked to create ""Rapunzel"" but later they wanted to create a ""parody"" version of the Princess theme (I think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enchanted-Blu-ray/dp/B0049GYXCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enchanted [Blu-ray</a>] might have come out from that endeavor) but Glenn Keane refused to work on such a project and pushed for a return to a classic Walt Disney ideal of the Fairy Tale story which Disney is known for.

The Current Disney CEO Robert Iger approved and supported this move and decided to bring all the old school Disney Feature Animation people into this project:
- Executive Producer: Glenn Keanne (also Character designer) and John Lasseter (Pixar)
- Music by Alan Menken (Alladin, Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, etc.)
- Directed by Dan Cooper and David Goetz (Chicken Little, Lion King, Bolt, too many!)

and thus we have Disney's first try in a long time to go back to the their roots.

I think this is for the best, as Disney Feature Animation will be able to put out their classics again while Pixar (part of Disney now) will be able to work on their more creative endeavors because John Lasseter runs both departments now!

Tangled thus, although not the BEST, made me come out of the movie theater thinking ""Disney is Back!""  Yes, there are a lot of things to criticize on in this movie; music might not be up to par with their previous classics, story is not as deep and might be predictable, but I think that's the Disney Fairy Tale formula, (Ariel didn't die at the end of The Little Mermaid like the original story!) It just makes you feel good at the end and makes you want to watch this over and over.

If you enjoyed Disney's classic Feature Animation (by classic I also mean 80-90's not only their old school ones) then you'll definitely enjoy this animation if you are not too critical... and if you're a fan of the video game Left 4 Dead 2, you might notice a certain frying pan haha.",1305763200,3,2619,5.339805825242719

1170374,2,7799128836,"I consider this movie to be the ""dumb blonde"" of the Disney princess saga: pretty to look at but lacking real substance. This movie had 90% positive reviews on Rottentomatoes.com, so it peaked my interest. I was sadly disappointed. This movie is what I like to call ""overrated animated"". I even took my 15-year old sister to see this movie, and even she hated it.

The movie isn't SO bad that it should be missed, but it's a pretty standard movie. If it were anything else, it would be tolerable, but this is a DISNEY PRINCESS movie. This isn't just a pedigree; it's a genre of its own. Disney has always been the biggest name in princess movies because they have offered us many of the best. It's not just that they are prolific but also crafted. Tangled was just playing it safe and thus offered nothing new to the experience. In fact, one could say that it is a rehash of other Disney princess movies.

The love interest is a thief, not a prince (Aladdin). The princess is taken away from her family at a young age not knowing she's a princess (Sleeping Beauty). The male and female leads hate each other first but wind up falling in love (Beauty and the Beast and any other romance). The story is incredibly cliche and predictable. You have a crucial misunderstanding that leads to ""the potential split"". You have thugs that ""don't dream of being mean"", much like in Shrek the Third. The one cliche that really ticked me off (as well as my sister) is the magical tear. I won't tell you who gets it, but you can guess. This deus ex machina has been done to death, and it's always silly and trite.

Because this is a Disney princess movie, the filmmakers saw it fitting to write new songs for it. Every song is forgettable and unnecessary. There is no cardinal rule that EVERY DISNEY PRINCESS MOVIE NEEDS A SONG, but at least those that do have at least one memorable song. In fact, it doesn't contribute anything new to the princess genre. Let's look back: Snow White ate a poison apple. Cinderella had the glass slipper say she was the one. Sleeping Beauty had the spinning wheel put her to sleep. All had princes save them. Then came the Disney Renaissance. Aladdin had no prince. In fact, the movie may have made fun of it with the whole ""Prince Ali"" schtick. The Little Mermaid had a princess who is a mermaid falling in love with a human. Beauty and the Beast: the prince was an actual beast who falls in love with a village girl. Hell, the Princess and the Frog had the prince and princess turn into frogs and becoming human after marrying and kissing. What does Tangled offer? the hair? It's not symbolic enough.

However, as I have said, Tangled isn't so bad that it should be missed. Despite its massive faults, it does have some positive qualities. The animation was pretty and creative. Disney knows how to mix and match the colors and make some really nice scenes. The scenes where Rapunzel and Flynn go to the kingdom look really good. The voice acting is pretty good despite the songs. Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi, and Donna Murphy all match their voices with their characters. There are a number of entertaining scenes, especially with the horse Maximus. That horse single-handedly (or hoovedly) stole the show every time it was on screen. If only it was on screen in every scene.

Bottom line: Tangled isn't awful, but it doesn't help that everything good about it is offset by something bad. The voice acting is good, but the songs are forgettable. The animation is pretty, but the story is ungodly formulaic and cliche. There are a number of entertaining moments, but there aren't enough to make this movie entertaining on the whole. The fact that Disney focused more on making a successful princess movie and less on making a good one is really annoying. Tangled offers nothing that the other Disney princess movies haven't. It's not one of those Disney movies that will be remembered.",1305590400,8,3905,4.596843615494978

Super-cute Repunzel is a welcome princess to join the ranks of Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Belle, Ariel, Tiana, Jasmine, Mulan and Pocahontas (can't you tell I have two young daughters?). There's plenty of romance for the girls, action for the boys and laughs for everyone! The music is OK (not as good as ""Princess and the Frog""), but the film itself has a lot of heart.

I was hoping Disney would do the story justice and...they did.
Excellent characters, they all developed at a fast and interesting pace.
Excellent story telling.
Direction, art, animation were all beautifully done.
The one thing I really don't like about old Disney films is the constant singing.
That's probably why I like the Pixar movies better but thankfully Disney toned down the singing this time around with more humor.

This is also a great movie for boys as well. She has a lot of play dates with little boys from her class and usually they are not interested in watching any of her movies because they say they are ""too girlie"" but this has just the right amount of action as well and ""girlie"" things in it too keep both boys and girls entertained.
I especially love the fact that I payed almost 10 dollars less than the local stores as well as other online sites that I checked before I bought it on Amazon.com. The greatest part is that we now have the actually movie for the house and one to use in our vehicle and don't have to constantly take one single copy back and forth; sometimes forgetting it in the house and listening to her fuss in the car that she doesn't like any of the movies in the car...or the other way around --- we leave the movie in the car and then when she wants to watch it in the house we have to get it out of the car (total nuisance).

If you have a 3D TV, get Tangled 3D, you won't be disappointed. If you are not 3D ready yet, also get this combo, for future use.

1170398,3,7799128836,"Tangled is the 50th film produced by Walt Disney's animation studio (for clarity, that number does not include joint productions, or Disney releases from other animation studios like Pixar).  This list of 50 includes some of the greatest movies of all time - Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, The Lion King, and 101 Dalmations.  Unfortunately, Disney studios has ceded the animation mantle to Pixar, and their last 10 films cannot hold a candle to the likes of Toy Story and The Incredibles.  So I was expecting, for the 50th film, a better effort, especially with John Lassiter as producer.  While Tangled does not quite live up to its more distant predecessors, it at least is an enjoyable 90 minutes, and it does contain some very nice animation and some big laughs.  It is also likely to be remembered as an ""also ran"" when compared to Disney's other release of 2010, Toy Story 3, which won an Oscar and set the box office record for most successful animated film of all time.

Tangled is an adaptation of the Rapunzel story, elaborating and making Rapunzel's hair the fountain of youth (it's not as absurd as it sounds!).  I suppose that explains how she can drag it through meadows, rivers, and forests and never get it dirty.....  Unfortunately for Rapunzel, the hair needs to be attached to her head for it to work its magic, therefore she is held prisoner in the tower to satisfy the selfish needs of her adoptive mother, Gotha.  A thief named Ryder, fleeing from his latest caper, uses Rapunzel's tower as a hiding place, and their meeting sets in motion a chain of events involving Rapunzel and Ryder travelling to the royal city, pursued by the local constabulary, Ryder's disgruntled henchmen, and Rapunzel's ""mother"".

Ryder's quipping asides generate many laughs, as do the antics of Maximus, a horse from the city guard that goes beyond the call of duty in trying to bring Ryder to justice.  There is also the joy of a remarkable action set-piece involving a breaking dam that is (dare I say it?) astonishing in it's animation (akin to the scale of Mulan's avalanche or the Lion King's stampede).  There is also the usual cast of Disney minor characters to lend colour and fun to the proceedings.  Certainly children will enjoy it, male or female, at least, if my 2 sons (5 and 3) and their female cousin (5) are any indication.  And it's ultimately harmless, certainly there are no traumatizing moments like Mufasa's death, and the violence is FAR less than that seen in The Incredibles or even Sleeping Beauty.

But it doesn't quite all add up to a classic film.  I think the problem lies in the backstory - Rapunzel is kidnapped by Gotha from her parents, but there is no emotion in their plight because no time is spent in developing their characters or any relationship with their daughter.  By contrast, King Stephan has a prolonged scene in the middle of Sleeping Beauty, Mufasa teaches Simba and plays with him in the Lion King, and Belle's sacrifice for her father in Beauty and the Beast is not taken until after a number of establishing scenes showing Maurice by himself and with Belle.  Thus the reunion in Tangled has no particular emotion in it.  The second problem is with the music - there are a number of songs by Alan Menken (with lyricist Glenn Slater), but they sound like they belong in a Saturday afternoon teenage sitcom on the Disney Channel (e.g. ""When Will My Life Begin"" and ""I See the Light""). True, ""I've Got a Dream"" is a joyous setpiece to rival ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"" or ""Under the Sea"", but one song does not a musical make.  Finally, I would be remiss if I neglected to point out that this is not a good value-for-money DVD.  Considering I paid the same price for Toy Story 3 and Tangled, the former has a number of neat extras, including a featurette on Pixar's modelling process, various short tours of Pixar's studio, and footage of a Buzz action figure on the International Space Station.  All Tangled has is footage on an alternate beginning which, while interesting, is paltry indeed compared to most Disney releases.  (of course, the intended audience will not care one whit that the DVD has no extras....)

Overall, I'd place Tangled in with the likes of lesser (but still enjoyable) films such as Atlantis, Hunchback of Notre Dame, or Pocahontas (but better than The Rescuers or Tarzan).  And it's certainly better than most other animation out there that passes for children's entertainment, such as Will Farrell's Curious George, the Rugrats Movie, the Clone Wars film, and even Pixar's A Bug's Life.",1305072000,,4569,4.731399747793191

I can see how many of the scenes would look amazing in 3D, but for me, it is prohibitively expensive. I don't think the movie suffers from the lack of 3D. The story and the characters make it.

It has some particularly touching moments where the lead characters go into detail about their unique pasts and gradually fall in love with each other, they don't just get married and ride off to a castle for the sake of it, not that there is anything wrong in that..just saying. I was torn about the Mother Gothel Character, I was glad that Rapunzel was free of her no question, but I don't like that she died, I would have liked, for Rapunzel's sake to see her maybe change and realize she really does love the little girl she raised from a baby.. it is as Rapunzel says ""Complicated"". It's hard to stomach that all she really was interested in was the eternal youth that Rapunzel's magic hair provided.. but the story ends on a high note, a still very young Rapunzel will have the rest of her life to live and her real family back to get to know and love all over again, all in all, this is arguably my new favorite classic Disney Movie!",1304899200,,1553,4.214765100671141

This package deal is a great value because not only do you get the Blu-Ray 3D copy it comes with a Blue-Ray, DVD and digital copy so I have all my bases covered.

I am an early adopter of 3D in the home and can usually complain or nitpick about the 3D releases for the home. My main complaint has been ""3D stereo ghosting of the background"". Even with this intermittent flaw I usually judge the 3D in home Blu-rays as good or better than the theater. I have seen the majority of 3D releases in the theater and own most of these movies as they become available. So... I know what I am talking about when I say... ""Ladies and Gentlemen, this is by far the best and most flawless 3D animated movie I have seen in the home so far""!!! The movie is your standard Walt Disney formula. It is a tried and true formula... updated for todays children and ""morals"". The 3D just works and does not get in the way or draw unnecessary attention to itself. My equipment is last years state of the art Samsung, but any other ""new"" equipment should work just as well. If I had a wish (or complaint) about the state of 3D, I would like to see ""real"" movies with this state of the art 3D Quality.

1170442,5,7799128836,"Yes there are a ton of reviews for thias film, so first of all amazon should divide them among the feature film, then the DVD, and the other DVD versions that include BlueRay and 3D-DVD formats.

Disney have made fairy tales and they way they present them in their own verison their forte, and this one's one of their crown jewels worthy of the same praise as Sleeping Beauty and The Little Mermaid. Their take on the Rapunzel story is very unique. The film gives us a wonderful prologue, completely animated, and narrated by the would be love interest of Rapunzel a thief known as Flynn Rider, who has another name, but is ashamed of it.

Rapunzel is anything but a damsel in distress as in previous versions of the stories in both books and animated films. She is very talented, curious, clever and 18 years old. Her ""prince"" is actually a thief who in the end saves her from a life of imprisonment in exchange for his own, not before striking a deal with Rapunzel, getting her out the tower, making her dream come true and giving the audience a fun thrilled and happy adventure., but the film does indeed has a happy ending and both end up together.

Like in Disney's Aladdin the jokes and gags come at the audience at tremendous speed, you barely finished laughing at something when there's another joke on your face. And it does include several songs weaved into the story, but Tangled is not really a full musical like Beauty And The Beast or The Little Mermaid. You can tell the writers did tons of reasearch of the Rapunzel story, and incorporated many elements from various versions, plus their own Disney magic. Visually being completely computer generated every single frame of the movie is nothing but stunning, a true work of art.

The DVD single disk edition includes two different opening sequences made by the studio artists, introduced on camera by the producers and director. Sadly that is the only extra available, as Disney felt compeled to include all the extra goodies for the Blue-Ray release. There is language selection for original English, and the Spanish or French dubs, but no scene selection. The other feature is a countdown of all their 50 animated feature films set to a song.

I give the single DVD 4 stars for lack of extras, or not including another disk like they do with so many others, and 5 stars for the movie, a new Disney classic has born! Is a must have in your Disney collection!",1304294400,,2424,4.614849187935035

1170447,3,7799128836,"Pertaining to quality of the product:
Right out of the box the Bluray didn't work (stays on Disney castle scene with motion but doesn't go past that) so very disappointed in that.  Can't return the product to Amazon since they won't take it back opened (i.e. I'm screwed on the Bluray).  The DVD worked at least so we're not at a total loss.  I need to do some more research to see if there is any way the manufacturer can do something about the bad Bluray - will keep the review posted with findings.
Just hate that you can pay for a product and it won't work out of the box (and quite possibly there isn't anything that can be done about it).  I understand the manufacturer and vendor's point of view that they won't know if the product was really a defect out of the box so therefore they instil a no return policy on an opened item.  Unfortunately that leaves us folks with an actual problem with a paid for manufactured defective product we can do nothing with...not many of us can sell something to someone brand new that is defective and say, ""sucks to be you eh?"".

Pertaining to our thoughts on the movie:
Pretty simple, our family loves the movie.  Great flow, good characters, great animation, good story.
My daughter (almost 5) loved it in the theatre and we new we wanted to buy the movie once it got out on DVD/Bluray.  I enjoy watching my daughter act out the scenes from the movie.  The only one to watch out for is the ""frying pan"" meet and greet between Rapunzel and Flynn Rider...thank you Nerf!",1304294400,,1514,4.397849462365591

This film never lost my attention and I have actually watched it 3 or 4 times since I have owned it, even my husband enjoyed this film. This movie is a feel-good movie, so if your having a bad day this could cheer you up. This film is targeted for children and I think any child would love this film, the music is put together well and all the characters are well done, the horse was my favorite and he had humorous personality which was fun. I would recommend this to all age groups, this film was put together well, the storyline is great,and you will find a few laughs along the way. I was not a fan of Alice in Wonderland with Johnny Depp, i found that movie wierd and scarey and I think a lot of children would find it frightening, so Im glad Disney put out a film that is the complete opposite and this film blew Alice in Wonderland out of the water, this is now one of my fav.

There is poignancy, also.  After all, how would YOU feel - locked up in a tower for 18 years; being able to look out but never to go out?  Think about that.  Then watch this movie.

I think it is crazy that Disney would put out a movie that doesn't play on most people's Vizio and Samsung blu-ray players. All Disney suggests is that you update the firmware on your machine.

1170497,4,7799128836,"This is another Disney animated classic in the making...nearly as compelling and as visually stunning as SNOW WHITE, SLEEPING BEAUTY, CINDERELLA and other timeless Disney classics. This is primarily because the production team, while using CGI, made a concerted effort to create the fluidity of movement of the hand-drawn art found in older Disney animated features. They succeeded so well that, aesthetically, the visuals in TANGLED are even better than the old classics. And the adaptation of the Grimms fairy tale story of Rapunzel had been waiting in the wings for Disney Studios all these years...cant believe they never produced a Rapunzel feature-length film before now. A loose adaptation, since the rescuer of Princess Rapunzel is a lovable thief instead of a prince, it is still an exceptionally well written screenplay and the music and song just enhance the mood and the overall quality of the film. The casting of voice actors is also top drawer, with Mandy Moore as Princess Rapunzel and Zachary Levi as the thief, Flynn Rider. Also listen for Donna Murphy as Mother Gothel and Brad Garrett, Ron Perlman and Jeffrey Tambor as the voices of the hilarious pub thugs. While not voiced, the animated horse, Maximus, is also a highlight, mostly from a humorous perspective. As with other Disney animated features, this one is family friendly...kids and adults alike should love it equally.

I loved this movie. While the princess retained the innocence so classic in Disney characters, she managed to remain interesting, and, honestly, it was refreshing to see a princess that could do a decent job of taking care of herself and a ""prince"" who wasn't automatically one of the best swordsmen ever. I especially enjoying how the weapon of choice was a frying pan. It is definitely a different approach to the classic, and also different in a brilliant way is that the noble steed did not actually belong to Flinn/Eugene and the princess' trusty sidekick was a small chameleon. Flinn/Eugene's voice actor also did a brilliant job of changing his tone of voice when his character was going back and forth between the dashing Flinn Rider and the caring Eugene Fitzherbert while not making it sound like our beloved ""prince"" had multiple personalities. All in all, the characters were engaging, even the silent Maximus and Pascal, the story managed to stay lighthearted while still retaining the conflict crucial to a good story, and the attempts at humor actually did end up being funny. I would fully recommend this movie.",1303689600,,1149,4.953367875647668

  will take your breath away.
  2. Humor: Humor for the most part is a success. A lot of the humor is very cliche -- you've seen it all before in Disney features.
  There are several jokes that are work, however, and they are quite memorable.

Cons: 1. Pacing: story really drags in a lot of places, and this ultimately the downfall of the movie. Every time the lead character would break into YET
  ANOTHER musical, I would cringe. Story would have been much served being a fast-paced action adventure with a lot of humor interspersed (like an
  Aladdin).
  2. Weak forgettable characters: I like the lead character of Rampunzel, and the villaness. The other characters were totally forgettable -- the
  various sidekicks (eg. the iguana and the horse Maximus), inserted for comic relief, were actually for the most part annoying rather than
  humorous.

Conclusion: worth a single viewing to see the amazing animation, but its ultimately not a keeper -- rent it don't buy it.",1303689600,2,1102,4.864864864864865

We all REALLY enjoyed it. There is enough humor in it to keep everyone happy. The horse was hysterical!  Loved the characters, loved the positive messages it sent out.
IF you read some of the 1*2 star reviews on here about some terrible stabbing scene..RELAX,...it is really not that bad, there isn't even any blood on the knife! They briefly show a little red on his shirt so you know he was hurt,...but they did NOT show the knife going into his body like other people lead you to believe.

What a surprise!!! I'm an older ""Kid"", but I loved this movie, and wonder who is in charge of marketing for Disney? They should be fired!!! The only thing I didn't like about this film is the title, but that's really a small complaint. The music is great, the comedy is funny and witty, and the story is sweet!

1170537,5,7799128836,"Before I saw the movie, I was lukewarm about this latest Disney princess offering. The main reason for my lack of enthusiasm was the trailer I saw over and over again.  The movie seemed like a zany spoof of an actual princess story. As it turns out,  about 90% of the scenes in the trailor aren't even in the movie.
 My 5 year old wanted to see Tangled and I took her on the opening weekend thinking it would be mildly entertaining but ultimately disappointing. I was thrilled to discover that Rapunzel is an enchanting film. I completely fell in love with this sincere, thoughtful well done movie. Visually beautiful, wonderful soundtrack, great acting..I could go on and on about this movie.  My daughter and I  went back and saw it in the theater again a few weeks later. We've watched it repeatedly since we got the DVD. In my humble opinion, Tangled is the best princess movie since Beauty and the Beast.
I don't know what Disney was thinking when it wrote up the marketing plan for this film. Not only does it completely misrepresent this nature of this film, it does it a HUGE disservice.",1303430400,,1095,4.538071065989848
1170538,5,7799128836,"Finally a family film that is as interesting and fun to watch for me as it my children, Tangled. On the day of its arrival my children were on edge for me to open it up and pop it in our blu-ray player. Of course I was glad to since mommy can always use an hour or so of quite time. While I rushed about the house, I found myself peeking more and more at the tv. Finally I did it; I sat right down on the couch and watched the rest of the show.

At that moment Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) makes an appearance in Rapunzel's tower to hide from the king's army. This is the point where you see the childish nature of Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) which continues throughout the film. This nature really helps my younger children connect with her character and in turn keeps them interested in each of her adventures.

As Flynn is stuffed unconscious in the Rapunzel's closet, she makes a final plea to the only mother she knows to leave the tower for her birthday to see the lights. Mother Gothel (voiced by the lovely Donna Murphy) proceeds to tell Rapunzel that it is for her own safety and protection that she has been locked in the tower. Not only does she stress this in speech but also in song. ""Mother Knows Best; Listen to Your Mother!"" is my favorite part in the movie because even though Mother Gothel is a terrible villain, she does add a bit of parental knowledge here.

I as a mom really enjoyed Rapunzel and I even watched it on my own while my children were at school. For a grown woman as busy as this mom of 4 is that is a huge thing. There is alot of action, comedy and of course a little bit of true love all in one with Disney's Tangled.",1303430400,,1646,4.169811320754717

1170547,5,7799128836,"""Tangled"" is spectacular, but it's not because it's a 3D cgi movie. The fact is, Disney has regained its magic and they did it with some hand-drawn veterans. Kudos to John Lasseter for once again pushing story rather than technology. It's why Brad Bird's ""Incredibles"" for Pixar was so fantastic and now Lasseter has pushed Disney back on track with their 50th animated feature. I wish it had happened one movie sooner to prove traditional animation isn't dead. ""Princess & the Frog"" almost made it, but they just threw songs everywhere most of which could have been deleted. Anyway, back to ""Tangled"". Some of the artists that made ""Tangled"" so spectacular are Glen Keane, Donna Murphy, Alan Menken and Lisa Keene.
First, executive producer Glen Keane was the lead animator for Ariel, Beast, Aladdin and Pocahontas to name a few. He apprenticed under Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston and obviously their brilliance is now found in him. Donna Murphy is one of the strongest voices on Broadway. She was lead in Sondheim's ""Passion"" and anyone who knows Sondheim's rigorous selection process knows amateurs need not apply. As soon as I heard Murphy's voice in ""Tangled"" I recognized it immediately and knew Disney had struck gold there. Alan Menken returns for scoring the music and although Slater his lyricist is no Howard Ashman yet, most of the songs are very solid. There's also Lisa Keene who I'd have to say is Disney's modern day Mary Blair/Eyvind Earle. Like Glen Keane, Lisa Keene has been around since the Disney magic of Mermaid, Beauty & Beast and Lion King. She and the others are in my opinion the unsung heroes of ""Tangled"". This movie keeps me optimistic that Disney will once again be the pinnacle of animation.",1303084800,,1726,4.874149659863946
1170548,4,7799128836,"As someone who grew up watching Disney (and other animated) movies and appreciates the art form as much as live action films for its freedom and creative license, I'm often one of the few childless adults in the theater when new animated films come out. There have been a rash of really good animated movies lately, and I was excited about this one. I think, for kids, this movie hits the mark very well; for adults, it's good but not quite classic material.

The story has all the potential to be a classic, and the animation - while not the quite the same style as the hand-drawn classics - has its own charm that makes up for the occasional plasticy look. Mother Gothel (the villain) had the potential to be a villain on par with Frollo (Hunchback of Notre Dame) himself - a weaselly, malicious, evil user who plays mind games to keep their charge in line. And the music was beautiful, with good to great lyrics (depending on the song). So why on earth did they choose a pop singer for their music, or turn Mother Gothel's potential complex and brilliant character into a snide, obvious, one-dimensional meanie?

The great music from the Disney classics is great because it is sung by people with the proper vocal range and steady voices; perhaps most importantly of all, they are singing to make beautiful music, not because of their trademark genre. From Hunchback of Notre Dame to Aladdin, Mulan to Beauty and the Beast, Pocahontas to Sleeping Beauty, these songs are memorable for their classic beauty. No offense to Mandy Moore - who is a fine pop singer - but her singing was not at all suited for this role, and strongly detracted from the film.

As for Mother Gothel's character, her constant snide-jabs-followed-by-quick-apologies had the effect of weakening the character greatly. I know people like this - who insult you and then laugh it off with, ""Sorry, just kidding."" Other than themselves, I don't know anyone who thinks they are clever or witty; they are clearly, obviously nasty, and not even terribly intelligent in going about voicing their malice. Gothel, however, is not supposed to be an annoying, mean dimwit; she's supposed to be very clever and manipulative. Had they had her insult without offering apologies, or insult without laughing it off - and, when Rapunzel was insulted, chided her for being too touchy or sensitive, the effect would have been much better. She would not only have been mean and hurt her daughter's feelings, but she would have then laid a guilt trip on her as well for being ""too sensitive"". (I've known people like this, too, and they are a heck of a lot more effective than the other type). Disney * tried * to do this, but failed - instead, Mother Gothel comes across as a mean (but obviously so), catty, snide witch, rather than a clever manipulator. Instead of a female Frollo personality, they got a mosquito.

These were my two biggest gripes with this movie, and what, to me, kept it from 5-star-classic material. Now, that said, this is still a good film - and one of the best ones Disney has put out in years, literally. Younger kids will probably not notice either of these points, and older ones may or may not find them as significant as I did. Rated 4/5 stars for a movie that was almost a classic.",1303084800,,3267,4.65684575389948

1170550,5,7799128836,"I tried to resist ""Tangled"", I really did. I've been entertained but somewhat underwhelmed by Disney's animated films for at least ten years or so. I found Disney's marketing campaign for this film somewhat annoying, especially their unwillingness to title the film ""Rapunzel"". I was very angry at Disney for changing from hand-drawn animation to (mostly) computer animation. There are other things, but I'll stop there. Needless to say, I was at Defcon 2 when the lights went down for ""Tangled"", ready to see yet another example of Disney losing its magic. Well, I was wrong. I love this movie. This may be my favorite Disney movie since ""Beauty and the Beast"". I apologize for the cynicism, Disney. ""Tangled"" is simply magical!

Where do I start? The animation is absolutely glorious! The backgrounds are so lush and beautiful, the characters are so vibrant and expressive. Every facial expression (well, HUMAN facial expressions - I don't think I'm in a position to comment on the accuracy of Pascal the chameleon's facial expressions) is absolutely convincing. Look into the eyes of Rapunzel or Flynn at any scene in the movie and you see their emotions reflected there perfectly. I know the eyes are the window to the soul and therefore critical to making an animated character seem alive, but the animators have outdone themselves (and everyone else) this time. And don't get me started on Rapunzel's hair! Amazing!

The story is terrific, too - I can't remember the last time I laughed so much in a Disney film. Rapunzel is spunky and adorable, Flynn Rider is a sarcastic thief with (of course) a heart of gold, a hilarious horse named Maximus, a pub full of comic ruffians, a suitably sinister villain named Mother Gothel-  all great stuff! The romantic development in Rapunzel and Flynn's relationship is done extremely well, too, and never feels forced. We all know it's going to end happily, but getting there is such a joy in ""Tangled""!

""Tangled"" seems to have been somewhat overlooked (though it was still a half-billion dollar success worldwide) when in theatres last fall, and so I really hope that it finds the audience it deserves on Blu Ray and DVD. Disney has returned to form and made a tremendously entertaining fairy tale musical. If you have not seen ""Tangled"", then I dearly hope that I have convinced you to give it a chance. You will not be disappointed.",1302998400,2,2381,4.871604938271605
1170551,5,7799128836,"After several years of ho-hum animated features that took 2nd place to Pixar's annual masterpiece, Disney finally came out with a top-notch animated film in the same mold as Snow White, Aladdin, and the Little Mermaid.  And they based it on Rapunzel, probably the most famous fairy tale that has yet to be adapted to the big screen.  Being part comedy, part suspense, part romance and part musical, this film contains all the keys of a Disney classic.  The music is great, both the soundtrack and the singing.  The animation is great, and looks like a hybrid of Pixar's CGI and Disney's traditional animation.  The film itself is quite long for a Disney cartoon, and is probably too long for younger children.  But for everyone else, it is great.",1302998400,,746,4.744186046511628
1170552,5,7799128836,"Since John Lasseter took over Walt Disney Animation Studios, a trend of quality has been noted in the features released since his commanding. Disney Animation Studios has a rich history and was one of the best (if not the best studio) in the animtion field. But since the 2000s, the studio became less and less succesful with awful movies that not only did not resonate with audiences but also were box office bombs. Since Lasseter took over the studio, only four films (Meet the Robinsons, Bolt, The Princess and the Frog and Tangled)had been released but each one of them are compelling and have pushed the studio up again. Following the phenomenal The Princess and the Frog (which also set the return of glourious hand-drawn animation into the studio), Tangled became Disney's 50th Animated film and I'm happy to report that is a sensational film that proudly fits that milestone.

Struggling almost 8 years in production and costing over $260 million, Tangled had a very troubled production. Formerly knwon as Rapunzel, the title was changed in order to appeal to boys and to draw more money from the box office. While the title change is somewhat a debatable decision, it seems it worked because Tangled became a major box office success earning almost $600 million in receipts. Although the title was changed and the trailers showed a ""contemporary"" story, make no mistake: Tangled is a tradional musical fairy tale and is a really good one.

I won't tell the plot here but let me tell you that the movie has a lot going for it: a compelling and likeable heroine, a brave and funny hero, adorable animal sideckicks and a memorable villain. Rapunzel is a very strong, free-spirited young woman who is easy to root for, the same can be said for Flynn Ryder the thief with a heart of gold. Pascal the chameleon and Maximus the horse are really funny and Mother Gothel is a very amusing villain. The animators and the voice actors have to be credited for doing such roundable palpable characters.

The animation is simply amazing!!! It's the first time that a CGI Disney film can be up there with the Pixar catalogue. The humans are rendered marvelousy and the sceneries are breathtaking (specially the lantern sequence). But what struck me the most was how amazing Rapunzel's hair is. Is so beautiful and believable that really adds to the picture value.

The score and the songs were done by legend composer Alan Menken and his new lyricist Glenn Slater. While the songs are good and serve their purpose in the film, they are far from memorable. They are not the best Menken has done and they are not at the same level as others like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast or Aladdin. Still the ones that I really like were ""When will my Life Begin?"", its reprise and of course the Oscar nominated ""I see the Light"" (which should've won the Oscar).

Wrapping up, Tangled is an excellent film with outstanding animation, great characters and nice songs. An excellent Disney film.

Video & Audio:

Unsurprisingly by now, Tangled BD looks absolutely spectacualar. A lot of things can be said about the transfer but let me tell you that this disc is demo quality and will completely blew your mind. The same can be said for the 7.1 DTS-HD MA track which is dynamic, clear and potent.

The DVD also boasts a fairly impressive transfer for SD and a good 5.1 Dolby Audio.

Bonus Material:

You have some deleted scenes, two storybooks openings, a 50th animated countdown (which is great), a making-of featurette, two extended songs and 9 teasers.

While all the material is great, the making-of featurette feels really promotional and too short to be entirely valuable. I was hoping for a more compelling documentary that will talk about the music in the film, the anination and the production overall. Overall they are entertaining pieces but Disney could've done a lot more in the special features department.

Sneek Peeks:

You got some interesting Sneek peeks like:

The Lion King: Diamond Edition (Coming this fall!!!)
Winnie the Pooh (in theaters July 15, same day as Harry Potter)
Cars 2 (in theaters June 24)
Dumbo: 70th Anniversary (not release date but is definetely coming this year)
The Incredibles on BD (already released)

And more that for me are not worth mentioning. Also is worth noting that in an insert that came in the box, The Fox and the Hound: 30th Anniversary Edition and TFATH2 are also listed in a 2-movie collection 3-disc combo pack which will include a BD and a DVD for the original film and one DVD for the cheapquel. This set is going to be released this September.

Final Thoughts:

Tangled is another example that Disney is recapturing its magic again and delivering good quality animated films. With stunning video and excellent audio and a good (if lacking) assortment of bonus features, Tangled is a must-own title on BD. This set is great for the majority of us who won't buy 3D crap and doesn't care for digital copies. Tangled on BD comes highly recommended!!!",1302998400,6,4999,4.780742459396752

1170555,5,7799128836,"I am an artist and went to this movie hoping to see some beautiful art and got more than I had hoped for. I would say this is the most beautiful animation I have ever seen. I am a painter and I like the old masters including the traditional subject matter they paint; pastoral scenes drapery figures etc. This is the first animation, digital or traditional,  I have seen that has convincing and beautiful representation of all these things.
I have studied and been a fan of disney animation art for years, and as blasphemous as it may be to say this, stepping back and looking at the big picture, I think this surpasses classics such as snow white and pinocchio. The original drawings and watercolor paintings for those old classics are among my favorite works of art, and I doubt that the studies and original art for this and other recent animation is as beautiful, but I think the final resulting movie is even more beautiful because of the lighting and the impact of the increased realism. Also those old movies are dark; in mood, and also visually. Tangled has night scenes with beautiful bottom lighting etc, but the daylight scenes really feel like day - filled with sunlight - I find this uplifting and I bet kids do too on a subconscious level. I seems appropriate to entertainment for kids
I like toy story, monsters inc, finding nemo and many other recent animations, but Tangled, because of the setting, has things that the human soul loves, green pastoral scenes, quaint towns and castles, lights reflected in water, all created with wonderful feeling (and refinement that is head and shoulders above animation of such subject matter done in the 1960's, 70's 80's or 90's) .

I agree with the other 1-star reviewers in saying this movie sends a negative message about parents and children, and about 'boyfriends' and freedom. But, the crowning horror: the evil fake mother ACTUALLY STABBING, with a knife, the thief/boyfriend in the side. I didn't see it coming, and I was horrified. Oh- yes, let's not forget my daughter, who had just turned 5, bursting into tears as the thief died. ""That's the saddest thing I ever saw!"" she said, in a choked little voice. Major applause for the movie-makers who talked themselves into thinking that was ok. One question: are you nuts? This isn't ok. A princess movie with that kind of horror-movie stuff? No, in case you need a little help thinking it through, it's really not part of classic fairy tales to have this kind of realistically-depicted violence. You can't justify that scene as some kind of truth-in-art.
The interaction between the fake mother and the princess was terribly disturbing, blurring so many lines about love and real mother-daughter relationships, with the worst kind of psychological abuse. As well as the message to young girls- hey, your home life can be awful, but some guy will come along and take you away from all that- any guy, whatever, it'll all work out: because you, the 'princess,' are so lovely, and life will reward you for that. The evil queen needing the princess's magic hair to stay young/beautiful? Hey- where was that in the original story? It wasn't. Just more Hollywood-style women-bashing. Sending the message to young girls, run away from home, your mother's just jealous of your beauty and doesn't want you to have fun, or get the guy. Wow.

I watched The princess and the frong when it came out and was so let down it was half hearted attempt from disney and it had a couple of cute momments but overall a huge disapointment. Having said that i can now say this, i was really doubtful when they released tangled, i mean after all i grew up in the second golden age of disney amimation, little mermaid, beauty and the beast, ect ect..  nothing could compare, until now.. i was shocked at how great this movie truely is, the animation is stellar, i mean the lantern secne  was so moving and beautiful,  it even topped the ball room secne from beauty and the beast, the voice acting was amazing i was kinda worried when i heard Mandy Moore was playing rapunzel, but happy to be proven wrong. the characters were well rounded, and the sidekicks are great. The music is catchy * even if it takes a couple of viewings* and brought to you by the always great Allen Menken. the last few secnes had me to tears. I was more then happy to find myself back in a real fairy tale story,where you can once again believe in a happily ever after, and if you read the story of Rapunel there are little things from the original fairy tale that are present in the re-telling if you look for them.

1170559,5,7799128836,"Tangled is a animated comedy/musical film by produced by Disney and directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard.  It features the voice talents of Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi, Donna Murphy, Brad Garrett, as well as others.  The story is based on the old fairy tale, ""Rapunzel"" by the Brothers Grimm.

  The movie takes place in a royal castle during medieval times with a little girl named Rapunzel(Mandy Moore), with magical golden hair that has healing powers and can restore youth.  An evil witch who is trying to stay young, Mother Gothel, (Donna Murphy) kidnaps the child and holds her captive in a remote, elevated tower.  Rapunzel grows up believing that Gothel is her mother and has never been outside the tower as a result of her ""mother"" telling her the world is filled with horrible dangers.  So Rapunzel has never known anyone else except her mother and her pet Chameleon Pascal.  Every year on her birthday, as Rapunzel looks out her window, she can't help but notice an arrangement of floating lights hovering in the sky, and she can't help but feel as if the lights are meant for her.  So on her 18th birthday she plans to ask her mother to leave the tower and head for the mysterious floating lights and find out what they are.  Her mother forbids it, so Rapunzel comes up with a plan, she asks for a special kind of paint that's 3 days journey away, after which Rapunzel plans to leave the tower.  As all this is happening, we meet the narrator of the story, Flynn Rider, (Zachary Levi) a hotshot thief who had stolen a tiara from the royal castle, on the run from the castle guards, and a hyperactive horse named Maximus, he takes refuge in the same tower that holds Rapunzel.  Rapunzel frightened, knocks him out with of all things a frying pan and ties him up, she hides the tiara and when he awakes she tells him that if he agrees to take her the floating lights she will reveal the location of the tiara, he accepts, and the two set off on an adventure to the castle, all the while trying to avoid Mother Gothel, Maximus the Horse, and two old partners of Flynn who also want the tiara.  The two go through many crazy experiences meeting friends and foes as Rapunzel learns what the outside world is like and learns what love is as well.

  I was very impressed with the animation in this movie, everything seems to go together, it has bright, vibrant colors, and the special effects are beautiful and work with the movie.  I love the way they portrayed certain characters, the chameleon, Pascal, is sooo cute and is always doing silly gestures towards Flynn, although he can't speak you always know what he's trying to say, kids will love him.  I also love the way they depicted Flynn Rider, his funny faces and his eccentric personality really adds something great to the movie, he's a very likeable character, and finally, the horse Maximus, has to be my favorite.  He is a very determined horse who will stop at nothing to get his man.  The funniest thing about him is not how crazy he acts but the fact that he acts like a dog, he sniffs around on the ground, he growls, and even the characters in the movie treat him as a dog, (even saying things like ""good boy, you wanna play fetch"" and such) he's definitely the craziest character in the movie.

  Another thing I enjoyed in this movie was the fact that it's a musical, I grew up in the 90s when all the Disney movies had great songs to go along with them that you remembered all throughout your childhood and that is pretty much non-existent now.  Although I do love a lot of movies out nowadays I miss the musical aspect of children films.  Tangled has done a swell job of bringing that back into Disney Films and I don't know about the rest of the world, but I found that very gratifying.  My favorite ones in particular were ""When will my life begin"" and ""I see the Light"".  Although the songs in this movie weren't as amazing as say, songs from Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, they're still catchy and memorable, at least for me.

  All in all, I LOVED this movie!  it's a great addition to the long list of great Disney movie, I think both kids and adults will love it, I know I was laughing all the way through.  I recommend this to anyone who loves animated movies.",1302739200,,4254,4.4477419354838705
1170560,5,7799128836,"Enjoyable, vibrant and all-out fun, ""Tangled"" is another wonderful animated film from Disney!

In 2010, the 50th Walt Disney Animated Classic was released!  Based on the fairy tale ""Rapunzel"" by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, the film adaptation is directed by Nathan Greno (""Bolt"", ""Meet the Robinsons"", ""Chicken Little"", ""Mulan"") with Byron Howard (""Chicken Little"", ""Brotehr Bear"", ""Lilo & Stitch"", ""Mulan"", ""Pocahontas"") and a screenplay by Dan Fogelman (""Bolt"", ""Cars"", ""Fred Claus"").

""Tangled"" would feature the voices of Mandy Moore (""A Walk to Remember"", ""Saved"", ""The Princess Diaries""), Zachary Levi (""Chuck"", ""Less Than Perfect"", ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakuel""), Donna Murphy (""The Fountain"", ""Spider-Man 2', ""Trust Me""), Ron Perlman (""Hellboy"" films, ""Sons of Anarchy"", ""Chronus""), M.C. Gainey (""Beerfest"", ""Sideways"", ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines""), Jeffrey Tambor (""The Hangover"", ""Arrested Development"", ""The Larry Sanders Show"") and Brad Garrett (""Everybody Loves Raymond"", ""`Til Death"", ""Ratatouille"").

The film was a success in the box office as the $260 million film would make over $551 million worldwide and has received mostly positive reviews from film critics.

VIDEO:

""Tangled"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 Aspect Ratio) and I don't think anyone has found anything negative to say about a modern Disney animated film on Blu-ray and the same can be said for ""Tangled"".  Immediately when you start watching ""Tangled"", you are greeted with vibrant colors, black levels are nice and fine detail crammed into every frame.  From the detail on the trees, to the detail of Rapunzel's hair, watching the folds on the clothing of the characters to the details of the Tower, the greenery...""Tangled"" features colors and detail galore.

If there was one scene that really caught my eyes was during the chase scene (which applies to audio as well).  The way the mountains look, the way the water looks, even down to the grain of the wood, ""Tangled"" looked absolutely fantastic.  I was very impressed by the animation for this film.

I detected no artifacting, digital noise, edge enhancement but I did detect slight banding in two spots.  One where both Flynn and Rapunzel were sitting near a camp fire and another scene with a lot of red.  It was noticeable but aside from those short moments, I detected nothing that would have spoiled the film.

Personally, for the majority of the film, ""Tangled"" was a visual feast and I was quite impressed by how detailed the film was but also how much went into the physics for Rapunzel's hair.  Overall, awesome PQ!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Tangled"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS Master Audio, French  Spanish 7.1 DTS-HD NR and English 2.0 DVS.  While not as strong as other Disney action-based films, still ""Tangled"" is no slouch as you can hear the wind, plants rustling, the stomping of the hooves of Maximus, the arrows being shot by the guards who are trying to get Flynn Rider and the bumps and slams into Flynn Rider's noggin from the pan used by Rapunzel.

But possibly the best segment where LFE, surround and rear-surround channels come into play is the chase scene when the guards and Maximus are going after Flynn and Rapunzel.  That was quite impressive audio-wise!

So, there are many moments of immersive audio that you can hear from the surround channels but because this is not an all-action film, one can expect crisp dialogue through the center channels and the score by Alan Menken as well as the music from ""Tangled"" through the front channels but also at times utilizing the surround and rear-surround channels.

The lossless soundtrack is quite appropriate for a film like ""Tangled"" and I don't think anyone can be disappointed by it.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Tangled"" comes with the following special features:

  * Deleted Scenes - (12:36) Featuring three deleted scenes: The Jaunty Moose, Chemistry Develops and Vigor the Visionary featuring intros by directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard on why the scenes were cut.  Note: Scenes are sketches and not 3D rendered.

JUDGMENT CALL:

This is an update to my previous review as I decided that I had to watch this film again as the first time, I felt I was concentrating too much on the visuals but this time around, I wanted to embrace the musical side to the film as well and I'm glad I did!

Not only did I enjoy it much more the second time, I just realized how awesome this Blu-ray release is by just really focusing on the lossless soundtrack and just finding that right position where the sound effects, especially the music just came alive.

""Tangled"" turned out to be a wonderful, delightful animated film by Disney and a wonderful experience that had that romantic comedy but yet darker and magical feel such as ""The Little Mermaid"" and even ""Snow White"".

And as mentioned earlier in my review, this is a wonderful Disney film that wasn't made by Pixar and perhaps that is a good thing because Disney animated classics have built themselves upon fantasy and adventure and what best to have their 50th animated film to carry on the tradition that Walt Disney had done long ago for his films and that is to have a film that can entertain people of all ages but to also to have elements based on a well-written script.

Sure, John Lasseter may have had his hand in this film as an executive producer but you have to give credit to directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard, especially screenwriter Dan Fogelman for taking on a well-known fairy tale and making an enjoyable film out of it.  Personally, I felt that the creators and staff were able to create a fresh and innovative storyline based on the fairy tale of ""Rapunzel"" but not make it so kitschy and keeping it fun, humorous and even heartfelt.

While a few may have felt that it was wrong for Disney to use the title of ""Rapunzel"" and go with the title of ""Tangled"", I can understand why they did it.  With ""The Princess and the Frog"", many felt the film did skew towards a younger female demographic and ""Rapunzel"" would have probably done the same.  Enough of the foolishness of even debating about the name, focus on the film and you realize how fantastic of an animated film ""Tangled"" truly is.

This time, you have Rapunzel and the swashbuckling thief, Flynn Rider and you have a film that the boys and girls will love, but throw in a few deeper and slightly darker elements to make the film rated PG and you have all the ingredients to make a wonderful animated film.

The voice acting for the film was wonderful.  Both Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi have wonderful chemistry ala voice acting and for the most part, the characters and the talented hired for the film were well-cast by Disney.  I'm not sure who did the singing voice for Rapunzel (as I know Mandy Moore can sing) and even for Flynn (can Zachary Levi sing?), but will say that I was quite pleased with both talent's voice acting performance.

The musical score by Alan Menken was actually quite memorable and like he has done for animated films like ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin"", the music is quite strong.  The musical numbers for ""Tangled"" are catchy and fun but while the music and the songs really provided a wonderful backdrop to the awesome visuals.  At first, I felt that I was unfair to the music as I kept complimenting the visuals but the second time around, I made it priority to listen to the music and I found myself absolutely loving it.  Menken really created music that complimented the film and once again, he has done a fabulous job.

As for the Blu-ray release, ""Tangled"" looks absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray and the music and lossless audio soundtrack is wonderful and works for this type of film.  While there are a good amount of special features with this release, I have to admit that I was a bit surprised as I was expecting a whole lot more (as Disney tends to spoil you with a lot of special features) for ""Tangled"".  But still, that's after years of being spoiled by Blu-ray releases from Disney but for what was included, there are still a good number of special features to keep viewers busy.

Overall, ""Tangled"" is a delightful film that will entertain families although because it's rated PG and does nearly show a death scene, it was a necessary move by Disney that made the film work.  The film still manages to display the magic of Walt Disney through it's look and feel and also continuing the tradition of quality with its Blu-ray releases as ""Tangled"" simply looks beautiful and sounds great via HD.

While not as special features heavy as I would have hoped (and expected) to see from a Walt Disney film, ""Tangled"" is still an enjoyable and wonderful film for the entire family and I definitely recommend it!",1302652800,,9771,4.855763427881714

1170571,4,7799128836,"Long-time readers (sufferers as the case may be) of my critical efforts may have noticed a certain pattern whereby I locate, for purpose of review, animated feature films so obscure that even the individuals responsible for their creation have long forgotten about them.  Usually (but not always), it isn't very difficult for me to find fault in these works but alas, to insure the accuracy of my whole scale of judgment, I proudly visit the latest, greatest, high-budgeted, much hyped, talk-of-the-town animated pieces as well.

As such I think it's safe to presume you've heard of Tangled prior to indulging in my evaluation but in case you have not, a brief refresher is in order: Tangled is Disney Studios' computer-generated 2010 big budget retelling of the timeless German fairy tale Rapunzel by the Brothers Grimm.

Tangled starts at the beginning and not just Rapunzel's beginning but her mother's.  It turns out the pregnant queen needs a bit of a miracle to overcome illness and that miracle comes in the form of a flower said to have come directly from the sun.

With a droplet of the flower's potency, the queen overcomes her affliction and gives birth to the baby Princess Rapunzel.  It turns out the flower's amazing abilities not only cured the ill queen but found their way into the hair follicles of the yet unborn child.  Because of the young princess' magical locks, one Mother Gothel kidnaps her from the palace under the veil of darkness.

Mother Gothel just so happens to know a thing or two about the flower's magical abilities and decides that she will stave off the effects of aging by locking Rapunzel in her hidden tower.

Fast-forward to a 17-year-old Rapunzel with hair over ten times longer than her body; tower ridden and utterly bored when a fleeing bandit by the name of Flynn Ryder takes refuge in her hidden crib.

Rapunzel works out a deal with the charming thief to act as her guide to the mysterious and perilous land beyond the tower and the adventure ensues the moment her bare feet feel the green grass of the meadow for the first time.

So now that we're up to snuff on what Tangled is and how it came to be, the all-important question then centers on entertainment.  Does Tangled deliver in terms of amusement?  Absolutely and perhaps better still, it manages to do so with the first genuine signs of ""classic Disney"" sensibilities that have been largely absent since the industry started making the move from 2D drawn animation to computer generated 3D in the mid-1990s.

I could be mistaken of course, but it has long since been my assertion that a majority of the CG features thus far have been created by individuals so awed by the medium itself that what resulted were closer to showcases of the technology first and foremost with story-development taking the back seat.  A sort of ""because we could doesn't mean we should"" mentality.

Of course there are exceptions to this trend, many of them in fact coming from the geniuses at Pixar (which has since become absorbed by Disney anyway) on account of the fact that they seemed to be oddly in tune with what kind of stories could lend themselves perfectly to the computer-generated world.

Disney, however, hasn't been so successful.  Anyone who has witnessed earlier solo-efforts like Valliant, The Wild, Chicken Little or Bolt can attest to the fact that while passable, none of these films could even come close to mastering the art ala Pixar.  That brings us back to Tangled.  Rather than create another attempt to cut into the lucrative CG glory shared by Pixar, DreamWorks, Blue Sky and so on, Disney finally seems comfortable (or perhaps confident) enough to get back to telling a tale their way- medium be darned.

What results is the formula that has made countless prior Disney films ultra-successful: A slightly modernized take on a classic fairy tale, a musically laced prose (yes the characters break out into song quite frequently here), personified animals with just enough actuality left in tact to still be considered realistic, dashing heroes, perfectly timed comedic efforts, evil old ladies and just a touch of magic.  It's all here- the precise recipe that has charmed fans for years across films like Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and to an extent even Aladdin.  This time however the clarity and attention to detail that can only be achieved via the technique of computer-generated textures factor in to aid the material rather than try to make-up for a lack thereof.

At 100-minutes, this film hints toward the marquee's return to longer runtimes and comes feeling as though that is simply how long it takes to weave its tale (rather than rushed to completion or stretched out with filler).

The casting is, as is customary for a major Disney effort, spot-on with Mandy Moore doing a bang-up job as the title character and Zachary Levi is equally captivating as Ryder.  Additional props are due to Donna Murphy as Gothel.

I came into this piece a bit jaded from the onset, feeling as though the classic fairy tale retold through CG has been done to death.  Perhaps four Shreks, two Happily N'ever Afters, three Unstable Fables, one Pinocchio 3K and countless other attempts will do that to a critic.  However, I must confess to having been swept up in the revelry with Tangled right from the onset.  Truly Disney retains its throne in terms of mastery of facial animation techniques and the hair textures here are absolutely astonishing.

By going back to their roots and doing what they do best, Disney has (finally) notched its place in the computer animated feature film hierarchy and has done so without relying upon the Pixar co-brand to make it happen.  Sure John Lasseter's name finds its way to the credits as Executive Producer, it's undeniably apparent that this was a Disney piece through and through.  I like to think that had this one been released back in the 2D era it would have gone by the simple title ""Rapunzel"" but if we have to try to isolate Pixar's influence on the project in some capacity, surly they had to have come up with the hip title.  Ironic when you stop to consider that from a puritan perspective, this is Disney's most untangled computer-generated piece to date.",1302307200,2,6231,4.819718309859155

The sound mix, incidentally, is exceptional, with strong 7.1 separation.

Though not an exceptionally flashy 3D film (that would be the 3D Blu-ray of ""Despicable Me""), the 3D set of Tangled is well worth the few extra bucks.  If you love ""Tangled"" - or any post ""Little Mermaid"" Disneys - be prepared to fall in love all over again.  If you were only ambivalent about the film, this 3D version may well win you over.

- The face movements of the main characters such as the horse and Flynn and are lively and so human-like that they captivate me. For example when the horse was angry with Flynn, it frowned its face just like a man! It's hilarious and fascinating. Or when Flynn tried to convince Rapunzel to give him back the the tiara, he raised one of his eybrows and half-closed his eyes. The facial expression was just like that of a man who's trying to come up with a trick.

- There are a lot of humour.

- Most of the time, the color are bright and beautiful. It does birghten up my mood.

- The animals do not speak human language. This feature makes this film more suitable for adults like me.

- There are two scenes that touch my heart the most. The first is when Flynn rather faced death than let Rapunzel endanger herself by healing his mortal wound. The second is the reunion of Rapunzel and her parents.

It's the only animation movie that I've bought so far. It's one of my 3 best love-story movies. The others are: Ghost (Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg),  and Just Like Heaven (Reese Witherspoon, Mark Ruffalo).",1302307200,,1390,4.427450980392157

I was SO excited to get this and watch it at home, but I didn't understand that I needed more than 3D glasses.  I have other (granted, slightly older, but still) 3D movies that don't require special players!

So bummed.  I saw it in 3D in the theaters and it was -amazing-.  AMAZING.  Now I'm going to have to wait until I find a friend who has a 3D blu-ray and 3D TV.

However, since I don't have a 3D TV and 3D blu-ray player, I can't watch the 3D copy.  I'm disappointed I can't watch the 3D blu-ray copy.

Coraline and A Christmas Carol were also beautifully done, but there are moments in Tangled I felt I was in the movie. I was scared when Rapunzel and I were in the cave filling up with water, to on the boat ride dazzled by how the floating lights danced over my head. Some people may say that 3d takes away from the movie experience, and that is true if it is bad 3d but Tangled delivered me an experience I could not get while watching it in 2D. 2D will still have the same great story and character triangles that make this a great movie, but it may not add that next level of emerging yourself in that story world.
I am 29 years old and never thought I would get reacquainted with Disney movies and enjoy them as I have with Tangled. If Disney continues to put forth more great movie in 3d like this then they will undoubtedly lead the DVD 3d sales when they sway more people into purchasing the proper equipment.",1302048000,10,1058,4.1911764705882355

1170592,1,7799128836,"What is wrong with Disney?!!!! After seeing this movie with my daughter I was really disturbed. I studied fairy tales when I was a graduate student and I am familiar with their traditional meanings and messages (always positive). This is a very twisted version of an antique story. The changes brought to the story created an extremely negative underlying message. People might not be rationally aware of the ""moral"" of a tale, but it creates a deep impression and it is effective in molding people's feelings and their perception of reality. The moral of this story is next to unbelievable. For the way it is presented it could be summarized as ""rebel to your parents, if they tell you to to be wary of the world they are lying"". Indeed one of the theme songs of the movie goes ""mothers know best"". Of course in the movie it is just a big lie and it is repeated over and over and over. In order to start living Rapuntzel has to rebel and flee this mother-witch who tells many of the things that we mothers usually say to our daughters, including warnings about the dangers of the world (which are very real for innocent girls). But in the movie all of her advice is just fake, evil, interested. All her assertions of love (the mother-daughter exchange: ""I love you"", ""I love you more"", ""I love you most"") are just a cover up for self interest and exploitation. Seeing this, my daughter was almost scared and looked at me saying, ""how do you know if a mother is really good""? Indeed this is not, as it could seem, a story with the usual and traditional wicked step-mother. Cinderella's step mother was clearly a villain, from the beginning she was cold and cruel, she did not resemble a normal mother giving heart felt advice to her daughter. Gothel in this movie mirrors in many disturbing ways a regular mother who gives regular advice and also makes ""surprises"" to her daughter (in the form of a special soup she liked). For sure we can't imagine any traditional villain doing this. And for very good reasons! They should not in your mind overlap with your parents in any way! So in the end Rapuntzel is happy beacuse she learnt the lesson: "" fight all this fake affection, all this overprotection, because it is just selfish and to your complete disadvantage and it is intended to keep you away from all the fun and happiness that is out there"". This message is absorbed by our unaware children. This message sneaks in our sons and daughters unconcious perception of things. Do you like it? I don't. No matter how nicely packaged it comes.",1302048000,80,2543,4.578947368421052
1170593,5,7799128836,My daughter loves this movie.  We saw it in theaters.  I would total recommend this for anyone that has a little princess in their house.,1302048000,3,137,4.44
1170594,5,7799128836,"I grew up in the 90s, with The Lion King and Toy Story representing the pinnacle of Disney animation--the pinnacle of animation period, from any studio. With the pool crowding, however, Disney has had trouble since I've been a kid. Shrek took over; Kung-Fu Panda; Ice Age. Sure, Disney has been a major presence throughout, but it's had to put up with some stiff competition the past 10-15 years. For the record: I'm aware that there's always been competition. My point is, that for someone such as myself, Disney has always come first; no-one else could top them, even if movies from other companies make good money and get good reviews too. With these others I've listed, that has changed a little bit as I've aged. Plus I've paid less attention to so-called ""kids movies"", so the significance of Disney, to me personally, has waned.

With Tangled, however, Disney seems to have finally found its footing in this modern era. Wall-E and other recent Disney flicks have proven themselves capable of holding their own, but the difference with Tangled--and what makes it so significant to me--is the general storyline of a princess rather than a robot or a pack of anthropomorphic automobiles. Lion King had this to an extent (although it was a Prince/King); Toy Story didn't have this, although the story illustrated the fact that CG animation could elicit genuine emotion. Tangled, although perhaps not as memorable as either of these favorites of mine (time, as they say, will only tell) but it marks a major return to form for the king of animation. Unlike other ""kids"" movies, Tangled--which is full of humor, drama, and character growth--does not incorporate inappropriate humor to attract adult audiences. Rather, Tangled's humor, despite the fact that the movie is aimed at a younger audience, is genuine enough that it doesn't _have_ to have kid-proof adult-humor (ie: kids see and hear it, but probably don't understand the double entendre) to attract adult audiences. That's what I love about this movie--it's funny without resorting to low-brow inappropriate humor. No, I'm not some angry parent who hates Shrek for its gross-out raunchiness (I in fact enjoy Shrek quite a bit); I just appreciate good, classic funny and Tangled has a plenty of it.

Rather than take the easy way out, the writers and animators have done a wonderful job of making the comedy work. The dialogue is fine, but what really stands out is the character ""acting"". The horse, Maximus, is especially well ""acted"". His facial expressions and body language (that of another animal altogether, which is for some reason very hilarious) fit perfectly with every situation in which he finds himself. Pascal, Rapunzel's pet chameleon, also expresses himself very efficiently without having a line of dialogue in the film. As surprisingly good as Mandy Moore's voice acting is, the animated acting of Rapunzel herself is amazing. With just a look, a turn of the head, the way she walks, you know exactly what she's thinking. It's truly wonderful.

Besides, the gags are all really funny too, without being raunchy. For instance, in one scene Maximus is hidden behind a peculiarly shaped and mossed-up rock, with a tree-branch conspicuously bent down--all of this with the effect of looking like a horse. All the sudden, Maximus jumps out from this situation. It may not sound funny on the page--and as I look at what I just wrote, I'm a bit unconvinced myself--but to actually see it is something else entirely. I was laughing when I saw it in the theater, along with my 35 year old aunt, 13 year old sister, and my 8 and 4 year old cousins.

Pardon my random musings on this movie. I realize that it's not an in depth review, but as usual with any reviews I decide to make, I'm writing this for people like me, people who remember the Disney of _their_ childhood (not necessarily the ""classic"" Disney; Snow White, Pinocchio, etc); for the people who don't think Disney matters any more. It's like we've all grown up now, and no one bothers to watch a movie if it's not violent or R-rated. It's not gritty, it's not a representation of the real-world. It's a fantasy, a fairy tale, and so on. But so what? Who says that movies have to be that way to be deemed worthy of viewing? Tangled may be a ""kids movie"", but I like it quite a bit.

I give it 5 stars not because I think it's a game-changing movie, not because I think it's perfect, or anything like that. Rather, it's a great ""kids movies"" that anyone and everyone can watch without feeling out of place. It's entertaining throughout, and that's what I look for in any movie.

** UPDATE FOR 3D VERSION **

[I apparently can't change this review to be specifically for the 3D version, so I'm just tacking this on here.]

When I first bought my 3D TV, this (and Tron Legacy) were the first 3D Blu-Rays that I bought. Since then I've collected probably about half of the major movies that have been released in 3D, and of all of them (including Avatar) TANGLED 3D is my favorite in terms of stereoscopic 3D. The picture looks absolutely amazing and has impressed everyone I've shown it to. The 3D definitely adds to the experience, and the world really pops on screen (and ""behind"" screen). So if you're looking for just one 3D Blu-Ray to buy, this should be the one to add to your collection.",1302048000,2,5322,4.745945945945946

1170596,5,7799128836,"Who would have thought Disney still had it in them!? I found a couple instances where I would say they tried a little to hard to make something funny, a classic Disney 'he just stepped in the #2' moment that made us laugh the first time and now it's just old, then again it is a kids movie more so and simple humor is sometimes best.

I loved right after she gets out of the tower, it was perfect. Yep, she's definitely a woman, then the guy half trying to figure out what he should do. Yep, that guy is a man.",1301961600,,510,4.0
1170597,5,7799128836,"i am pretty esceptical when it comes to Disney movies, lately they haven't been as good as in the second golden era....since Lion King, they been lacking something that i cannot put my finger on it, perhaps the human connection or the flair for humor that once was a staple.

but this movie, tangle, seems to have regain Disney's mojo...the characters, specially flynn and rapunzel are drawn with a certain degree of realness...plus, in the ""duckling restaurant"" scene it is marvelous to see that musical number and not fall off from your feet laughing and enjoying every minute of it...

it was a little off tho to see the villain for the first time take a rather simplistic approach, and not coming as close to the long list in the pantheon of Disney Villainess....she was rather, not too villain, if you can understand.

however well you put it, it is not the number one movie (that will always be Snow White), but certainly this is like a ""clean slate"" for the house that the mouse built, and a major success....hoping that is like The Little Mermaid and be the cathalist for a renew interest in hand-drawn animation and also for great storylines...wishing that this team gets to its maturity and learn from the past, a little like the second golden era learn from the past masters, but at the same time creating a new identity for themselves and keeping their innovative and amazing imagination!

It was enjoyable in the theater and they couldn't wait for the movie to be released on DVD. After watching it at least 5 times at home, it holds up well for replay value. What I mean is that some movies get to be very difficult to hear over and over but Tangled is fun.

The princess is sweet, naive, and pleasant, her 'mother' is obnoxious and Flynn Ryder becomes very lovable. We really love the horse and his 'bloodhound' style. My kids especially like when the horse is hiding behind the bushes in the shape of a horse. The musical numbers are funny, very classic Disney. The animation is very well done.

1170600,5,7799128836,"Beautiful Rapunzel's story is as old as I can remember, and it's almost impossible not to think about her every time you see a girl with extremely long hair. Therefore, it was only a matter of time before the creative minds at Disney adapted it into an animated movie, the result being the delightful and very entertaining ""Tangled.""

The story revolves around a magical flower that has healing powers, something that a lady named Mother Gothel has known for years. She knew the location of the flower in the wild, and used it for years to prevent aging and keep herself young and beautiful. However, one day the Queen, who was pregnant, became ill, and the King, knowing about the plant, sent his soldiers to search for it. They eventually find it and the flower's power cured her and she was able to give birth to Princess Rapunzel. Because Rapunzel's hair was golden like the flower, Mother Gothel realized that the baby's hair would also keep her young. So she decides to kidnap Rapunzel one night and take her to the tall tower where she lives. Time passes and the Princess grows up alone in that tower, thinking that Mother Gothel was her mother. She was not allowed to step out of the tower, so that she could not discover the truth. Enter Flynn Rider, a handsome thief, who has a charm of his own. He will be the key to Rapunzel's freedom.

As every Disney movie, ""Tangled"" is full of fun characters that create hilarious situations. It is very colorful in every sense of the word. Never mind, of course, about the thief-princess formula. Disney always finds a way to keep the story fresh and engaging. This is fun for all family. The remarkable two-disc Blu-ray / DVD edition includes deleted scenes, a making-of feature, storyboard openings, and much more. (USA, 2010, color, 100 min plus additional materials)

1170602,5,7799128836,"Ok, first off I am a 26 y/o Male who from time to time likes to veer away from violent movies and watch something a bit innocent. I bought the 3d version of this movie, but to start let me review the story. Disney finally backtracks and goes with something a little bit more familiar. Returning to princesses, heroes, and catchy songs. The story was quite touching as well... something I find quite necessary for a Disney movie. We have a return of the ""princess sidekick"" (phillipe in beauty and the beast, sebastian in the little mermaid), pascal the chameleon is an awesome addition bringing a nice touch of humor to the story, along with maximus the horse. Overall, without spoiling the movie, it is your run of the mill CLASSIC Disney movie, which we haven't seen in a long time and is very much needed. The story is clean fun I believe the whole family can and will enjoy.

Now for the graphic and 3d review. If you have a 3d tv GET THIS MOVIE!!! As most of us know Avatar set the standard for 3d by making the 3d give depth to the world and not just use it as a gimmick. Tangled follows in Avatars footsteps and I believe gives Avatar a run for it's money in the 3d aspect. Tangled uses 3d in a way to show distance and detail, rarely using it as a gimmick. Dust from the  musky tower is visible and appears to float right in front  of you in a non invasive way making you feel like you are right there in the tower. The very RARE occasion something is pointed at the screen gives the viewer a sense of surprise and is normally something that would have happened whether the movie was 3d or not... it's not just a gimmick. One part (not  to reveal anything) in 3d will make your hair stand on end.. the detail of not only the picture quality but the 3d is amazing and should definitely be in any 3dtv owners collection.

Overall this movie is a great piece of art on the part of Disney. Keep it up Disney... we are hoping you can once again make the classics we once fell in love with!",1301875200,6,1992,4.231578947368421

To date I've seen it 6 times (twice in theater and four times since getting it from amazon-I did the pre-order), I love the characters, and while there are things I'm not over the top about (namely the creepy half naked drunk midget man running around dressed like cupid) it still makes me laugh and enjoy watching it. I haven't been this excited about a Disney princess movie since The Little Mermaid, so if you haven't seen it and you're on the fence about it-watch it.

1170615,2,7799128836,"Despite the wonderful animation and art direction, this is yet another of Disney's failed attempts to capture the magic of their ""golden age"" of the 1990s.  The Lost Princess/Rapunzel is just another ""misunderstood"" girl who's coming of age means rebellion against her parent.  This is practically a theme for Disney films of late, perhaps done so they'll be marketable to the so-called spoiled ""tween"" girls who think the the world revolves around them.  In any event, this film has the obligatory (and forgetable) musical numbers that fall flat and don't advance the story, but rather are just an interruption of it.

Save your money, unless you want to entertain young children with the bright colors and fast-moving action.  The story isn't worth the journey through ""Tangled.""",1301788800,8,781,5.166666666666667

In one fell swoop he takes away the one thing that makes her unique and powerful, all under the guise of having done it for love. Just one of the many missteps of the movie--the fake mom is abusive; the love interest is a thief; above all else, beauty and youth must be maintained; long golden locks = power and short brown hair = not...etc. And then we wonder why our kids are nuts.",1301788800,35,652,4.308943089430894

1170627,5,7799128836,"TANGLED is much more than ""a drop of golden sun."" It has a flippant, modern attitude in all of the dialog, a crisply appealing and smartly styled animated technique that brings the characters to life, and a pleasant score by Alan Menken that captures the essence of the fairy tale story in street smart style. In short, it's an instant classic for today's movie fans.

With talented voice chores performed by ZACHARY LEVI, MANDY MOORE and DONNA MURPHY, the characters are given full-bodied images that are uncannily real. In fact, the chemistry between Flynn Rider (Levi) and Rapunzel (Moore) is a gradual thing (not instant falling in love as in most Disney features), and blends and ripens convincingly for the tender moments that follow.

And aside from the key human characters and a horse named Maximus, there's plenty of fast-moving adventure as the evil Mother Gothel plans on keeping Rapunzel at her side forever as a way to retain the magic powers of her golden hair, lest she shrivel away to an old hag. And within the texture of the plot is always a sense of humor from either one-liner wisecracks or the animated expressions of the humans and Maximus, the stubborn horse.

Easily one of the best animated features to come out of the Disney studio in some time despite the fact that the score is not as strong as other animated classics. Nevertheless, it has action and romance and an astounding beauty in its magnificent settings and polished art work.

Absolutely a must for any animation fan.",1301529600,8,1506,4.803088803088803

They do not need to report to many of the overdone cheesy effects that are often tried in lesser material. Good action scenes, story and it is a quality piece of work.

And, did they.

It is a good film.  There is humor.  Supporting characters that we more exciting than the main characters.  That would be Maximus & Pascal.  Stole one name from ""Gladiator""? We got back into regular Disney music for a film.  That is a plus, BUT which is major.  None of the songs are memorable.  I can NOT remember any of them after the film.

Is colorful.

When I wrote above about tried & true. I mean it.  You see several scenes here that were taken from both ""Beauty and the Beast"" & ""Snow White.  When the film started I thought I was watching ""Beauty and the Beast"".  The superior film of course, ""Snow White"" again superior and the one that started the full length  animated films.

The good guy is first a heal, hey Disney how about I saw that in ""The Princess and the Frog""?

So, it was a good try & a good film Disney.  Just NOT a bulls eye.

NOW, THE COMPLAINT I HAVE WITH DISNEY NOW.  They think EVERYONE has a blu/ray player.  I do NOT.  Can NOT afford one or the discs.  So, Disney does NOT care about regular DVD's anymore.  There is only one extra on this and it is for kids.

And, for a colorful film why a plain Jane silver disc Disney?  Cheap.  For a colorful film, beautiful animation a plain silver disc.

Cutting corners does NOT make people customers happy Disney.  Disney has gone cheap, NOT the way to make money Disney.  I hope your company AGAIN uses sales because of these cheap tricks.

It will not blow you away. If you have kids and are the kind of person who prefers to have the DVD in their collection rather than rent them, then I can safely say, it is a good addition to a collection.
People have written reviews breaking down the specifics of the movie and the product description basically tells you the story so there is no need to go into those details.
This is a Disney return to clean, family fun. It is a real family movie. It is a well animated and well voiced film. Many movies today, even though they are animated for kids have some adult oriented humor slipped in. I don't think I saw any of this in this film. It was a kids film all the way.
Misrepresented DVD vs. Bluray special features: On the regular DVD, there are no special features except 50th anniversary sneak peaks. That's it. The Bluray has all the special features. I watched the Bluray + DVD edition twice and can verify this.
EDIT: The only thing that made the Bluray better is the witty banter in the Making of Tangled extra feature between Mandy Moore and Zach Levi. It was probably scripted but was a good, funny, entertaining behind the scenes.
I really didn't see a big reason for this to be in Bluray. Like any Bluray movie compared to reg. DVD, you will see a difference but it's NOT a big difference here.

It has been a long time since Disney has produced a movie that has even come close to the quality of their classics. This movie can be ranked with those movies and eventually become a classic.

1170644,3,7799128836,"""Tangled"" has all the elements of a classic Walt Disney animated feature.  Young beautiful princess locked away in a tower.  Evil mother figure who uses the girl for her own vain, corrupt purposes and a lot of animals with quirky personalities.  A slight difference this time around is the man that the girl is supposed to fall in love with isn't of high estate.  Nope, he's a thief and while on the lamb he meets Rapunzel.  The film is nice to watch but there is really nothing in it that sticks in the memory banks like scenes from past classics such as ""The Little Mermaid"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"".  The songs are decent but forgettable.  And speaking of ""The Little Mermaid"" there is a scene towards the climax which looks like it was directly lifted from the ""Kiss The Girls"" scene.  They say a Disney movie, much like James Bond movies, is only as good or as bad as it's villain.  Mother Grothel is in this story for no other reason than the story needs a villain.  Much like Frolo from ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", Mother Grothel convinces Rapunzel that the world is an evil place and keeps her locked up in a tower for her own good.  In the opening scenes of ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", we see how horrifying Frolo is, trying to throw a baby into a well and all.  We accept Mother Grothel is the villain because the narrator has explained that is who she is.

Disney has been consistent with that quality of their blu ray disc pretty much since they started marketing them a few years back  . I am happy to say that ""Tangled"" measures up to previous standards in the tech areas.  Even though I think ""Tangled"" is amusing and is worth watching, it's by no means a classic.",1301356800,12,1686,4.393548387096774
1170645,5,7799128836,"First of all, I just want to say that I *LOVE* this movie!  It has become my all time favorite Disney movie.

I was mistakenly under the impression that the 3D version of the movie would be playable on my ordinary Blu-Ray player and TV, and that it would come with 3D glasses like other 3D movies I've purchased before have... but this was not the case.

Don't get me wrong, I'm definitely not complaining- a 3-disc combo for this price is still a steal, and I now have the 3D version for if/when I decide to upgrade.

1170646,4,7799128836,"I was really surprised by ""Tangled."" It is everything i had hoped&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Princess-and-The-Frog/dp/B0034JKZ3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Princess and The Frog</a>&nbsp;would be. Sure, I loved ""Princess And The Frog,"" but ""Tangled"" is close to perfection in all the major ways: characterization, story, style, and even song. Although I question all the brouhaha about renaming ""Rapunzel"" so that the male audience wouldn't get turned off by another Princess movie, I fully support the final product! The movie is current yet classic; edgy yet traditional; in short...great Disney entertainment.

Flynn Rider is one of the first truly dimensional male leads in a Disney film in years; Zachary Levi does a great job of voicing a character who is more than just a handsome piece of cardboard. Mandy Moore is more than able as the voice for the lead, giving Rapunzel plenty of gumption and a thirst for life after having been couped up in the tower for so long. Although I LOVED the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enchanted/dp/B0049GYXCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enchanted</a>, I was less than thrilled with Susan Sarandon's villainess. She almost seemed to walk through the role, lacking the proper subtle menace needed to really create a dark and scary character capable of doing evil deeds. Not a problem here though; Donna Murphy makes Mother Gothel, the evil woman who stole Rapunzel from her royal parents at birth, one of the scariest (albeit subtly) Disney villainesses in a long time. When she tells Rapnzel not to ask her about leaving the tower again, you know she means it!

The story is familiar, but here goes a Reader's Digest version: Mother Gothel steals Rapunzel as a baby so that her magical hair will keep her (Mother Gothel) eternally young. To ensure Rapunzel doesn't get wise to the theft, she poses as Rapunzel's mother and locks the young girl away in a secluded tower, constantly warning her that the outside world is evil. As fate would have it, a handsome Robin Hood-esque young man named Flynn Rider is attempting to escape the guards at the Royal Palace, and naturally happens upon Rapunzel's tower while Gothel is gone. Rapunzel sees Flynn as her ticket for a quick escape to see the wonders of the world without Gothel knowing. It should come as no surprise that the best laid plans go awry, and Rapunzel ends up getting much more than she bargained for, with Gothel hot on her trail, desperate to recapture  her fading youth.

So why 4 stars instead of 5? First, the picture is perfect. You can practically count the hairs on Rapunzel's head. The beautiful lighting and shading from the Disney Animation Team is shown to its full advantage. And as for the sound...awesome as well! The music surrounds you and you'll be singing the memorable music (""Mother Knows Best"" and ""When Will My Life Begin"") right along with the movie. Obviously, my slight beef is not with the music. Instead, it's with the features. It seems obvious that this set is aimed towards the regular (and possibly more youthful) viewer as opposed to the animation-junkie who wants to see the behind-the-scenes documentaries, intense storyboard sessions, and other rare material that would satisfy the deep cravings of a Disneyphile. Instead, there are hip and comical features that are more fun than informative.

Here's what you get:

-Untangled: The Making of a Fairy Tale: Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi host this featurette that is more trivia-based than anything very serious or scholarly. Again, definitely aimed at the younger set and those who just want to be entertained. For me, the most interesting part was seeing how the hair of Rapunzel was actually animated. Wow...what a challenge to make it look natural.

-Deleted Scenes: Co-directors Byron Howard & Nathan Greco introduce 3 scenes (""The Jaunty Moose,"" ""Chemistry Develops,"" and ""Vigor The Visionary"") and explain why they were cut. I have to admit I get a little annoyed with the Disney ""deleted scene"" features on their discs. Most of these haven't even gotten beyond the storyboard point, so I'm not sure they really qualify as ""deleted."" Instead, these are more like ideas that were explored but never really quite finished. All of them slow down the pace and definitely are not missed. Enjoyable, but not missed.

-Two Original Storybook Openings: Alternate versions of the film's opening, again introduced by Byron  & Nathan. This is at least interesting to see how it pays homage to classic Disney animation as well as how it evolved over each attempt.

-50th Animated Feature Countdown: Fun, but again...more on the fluffy side is this montage of the 49 Disney animated films that preceded ""Tangled.""

-9 Tangled Teasers: Another fluff piece...entertaining, funny, and witty...but again, fluff. A series of ""trailers"" that take the form of parodies of infomercials and other current commercials/news bits.

And that's it...other than the usual bag of previews/plugs for upcoming Disney releases.

Please don't let the 4 stars deter you; this is truly a fantastic Disney animated classic that deserves to stand proudly with its predecessors. CGI detractors: it's just another art tool like a pencil...this film has many stunning moments, especially the scenes with the lanterns (you just have to get it to see!).

It was so wonderful!  My boys 8 and 6 even loved it, due to the funny parts with the horse and the male character, Flynn, in the movie.  My 4 year old daughter loved it, of course, as well.  And my husband, of whom doesn't get into Disney movies really at all, also thought that it was a great movie as well.

I just have to say that I was simply amazed at the beautiful quality of this film on blu-ray. You can truly see the light, the darks and everything in between.

It might be the most fantastic looking of all my blu-ray titles, and I own quite a few. If you are one of the people who have not yet stepped up to blu-ray I highly suggest this in high definition, it comes with the DVD too and will be well worth it in the long run.

It just look gorgeous, one of the first films I've bought that looks as good or better at home than it did in the theater. I'm happy to own this Disney computer animated fairy tale, it might be their most beautifully animated film yet and hopefully they find a way to present more fairy tales this way. Now on to the next dream...

Thanks

P.S. I do wish there had been more special features, a director's commentary would have been nice or a longer making of documentary than twelve minutes, luckily I can at least watch this enchanting film over and over, it's that resplendent, dazzling, exquisite whatever word you want to use.",1301356800,3,1208,4.308370044052864
1170649,5,7799128836,"Just saw this film last night and I had to say that there were so many textures in all aspects - the characters are just lovely to look at and had so much personality (than most real live actors); the songs are funny with great melodies; the dialogue is charged with wit and charm; the animals don't talk (what a relief!) but are still hilarious and necessary (sone scenes wouldn't have worked without them); the storyline is refreshingly entertaining although you have to really look closely to see the subtle fairy tale details of Rapunzel in the film or you'd miss it. This fresh take on the Rapunzel story is well made and different, but it is very, very good. Bravo Disney. 5/5 stars.",1301356800,2,689,4.564516129032258
1170650,5,7799128836,"Pixar aside, Disney hasn't made a movie this good since the renaissance 90's when we got classics like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, Pocahontas, Mulan, and Tarzan.

Tangled is the story of Rapunzel and her long, lustrous, climbable hair, but like any iconic Disney adaptation there's plenty of twists and turns along the way.  The characters are all endlessly interesting, especially the two animal side-kicks who absolutely steal the show (despite being mute.)  The music is good, perhaps not '90s good, but still very enjoyable.  Mother Gothel is among Disney's best villains and her deliciously wicked song ""Mother Knows Best"" deserves to be among the greatest hits of all Disney musical numbers.

The animation is, of course, breathtaking to behold--especially on Blu Ray.  The attention to detail and setting is what sets Disney apart from other computer animations.  Like the Beast's library or Belle walking through town, there are an endless number of images that will remain frozen in your mind for weeks, months, and probably years at a time.  I collect a lot of Disney movies but I still consider myself somewhat of a snob, if it's not during the Walt era (or one of the better '90s releases) I have a hard time justifying it for my collection.  With Tangled however, it is a no brainer.  This is the stuff of an instant classic, it'll be around for a long time.  You might as well take advantage of it now.",1301270400,2,1434,4.812244897959184
1170651,5,7799128836,"Rumors of the end of the Disney Princess movies, to paraphrase Mark Twain, ""have been highly exaggerated."" Tangled proved it by being a huge theatrical hit. Part fairy tale, part musical, part romantic comedy, somehow it all came together despite a long, difficult history of behind-the-scenes changes and rearranges, including giving the film a ""hip"" title instead of Rapunzel (or as it was known in one incarnation, Rapunzel Unbraided).

When the Tangled trailers originally aired, I was apprehensive because of the title change and the skewed trailers with their blaring pop music tracks. Would it be a spoofy, Shrek-y send up? Would Rapunzel herself be the tough-talking ""today"" lady so common in recent animation? Would it end with a boogie dancing '80s top-40 chestnut?

I needn't have been concerned. Tangled turns out to be a Disney fairy tale in the classic sense that straddles the difficult line between ""straight"" storytelling, screwball comedy, romance and yes, even a little suspense -- because, like Cinderella, we know it's all going to be fine but we want to see how it works out.

And speaking of Cinderella, there has never been a Disney animated film with a more complicated villain than Mother Gothel since the Stepmother in Cinderella (Cruella and Madame Medusa are close contenders). The evil is all about psychological abuse, the manipulation of a person into submission that is so effective that the victim is compelled to sustain it, even though they yearn for more.

How many of us have experienced, or know someone who has experienced, a situation in which we are led to believe that we're ""lucky to be here"" or ""better off than the alternative"" by a person or a group who knows your true worth but conceals it by convincing you you're not capable otherwise? Who hasn't had the boss/parent/partner/friend who criticized you so much you started to believe you really were worthless? I was astounded to see this complex dynamic dealt with in a Disney animated film.

Both Rapunzel and Flynn have self-doubt but they trod on anyway. They didn't start out contemptuously loathing each other the way couples do in way too many films nowadays, either. Their character arcs were the most plausible we'd seen since Beauty and the Beast.

The Alan Menken/Glenn Slater songs were not tossed in at random just to fill up an album or make a great theme park number (though they probably would), but because they had a crucial book requirement. They all served the story -- and I've Got a Dream"" was the funniest number since ""Gaston.""

Often when the story was just about to approach a clich, there was a gag or twist that punctured it. And the horse -- Maximus -- stole every scene.

Animation-wise, there was a hand-drawn quality to the expressions that I don't recall in most CG films, especially in the more human-styled characters. In his commentary on Toy Story 3, Lee Unkrich said there had been huge strides in CG humans and clearly both films were able to benefit.

Tangled didn't make me get all misty eyed the way that Toy Story 3 did, but it was, in tone, more of a grand epic romp overall. I liked it much more than I thought I would. My wife and kids loved it.

The Blu-ray is truly dazzling, making full use of meticulous detail, design and color. The DVD does not contain as many bonus features as the Blu-ray, but there aren't all that many anyway. One highlight is a segment in which lead voice actors Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi breeze through a lighthearted trivia trek which includes a quick rundown of all 50 Disney animated features (a list that has, historically, changed a little bit over the years).

There seemed to be no doubt that Mandy Moore was a perfect fit for the singing and acting duties of playing a Disney princess. The surprise is Levi, who has far more range than he often is allowed to display on TV. Clearly he has more stage experience than the unpretentious persona evidenced in various appearances. He even has a decent singing voice.

Like Mickey Mouse, who started it all, the fairy tale is the heart of Disney storytelling. They can and should stretch and go outside the box but they should never totally abandon the core form. Nobody does it better. Makes me feel sad for the rest...(somebody stop me!)",1301270400,4,4268,4.776119402985074
1170652,5,7799128836,I had lost interest in Disney animated features somewhere between The Lion King and... can anyone really remember? As Disney moved towards 3D animation I must admit with exception of WALL-E there hasn't been a story that really defined what Disney is famous for: taking an already original (classic) story and adding the Disney twist. Tangled is the rebirth of this definition and more. I am looking forward to watching this again once the DVD is out. It's great for family and surprising enough I have found that even guys found it entertaining despite not being into fairy tales.,1301270400,,581,4.878787878787879
1170653,4,7799128836,"Disney's 50th Animated feature is entertaining and plays well even on a standard dep TV.

 Tangled is the 50th full-length animated FEATURE film from Disney and they are using that number to promote the film and its new DVD release. It's ""interesting"" that the DELUXE FOUR-DVD set (DVD+ Digital+Blu-ray+ Blu-ray 3D) is priced at $49.99 and not an even $50.

Anyway, there are MANY reviews already posted based on the theatrical version of the film so I won't re-hash the plot here. You probably will be more interested in the home version of the film.

As noted above, there is the 4-disc Deluxe version, but Disney has also released a 2-discv version without the 3-D disc, and a single-disc DVD version. Unless you are one of the few with a 3D TV the Deluxe version probably won't be of much use.

To date I still haven't gone Blu-ray so I was unable to watch the bonus features exclusive to BR, which include A ""Making of"", Deleted scenes and two extended songs. The other two minor bonuses are on the standard DVD version. These are two interesting ""original storybook openings"" - running just over 3 minutes each - and a two-minute ""countdown"" compilation of the 50 animated features - to a soundtrack of Stevie Nicks' ""Dreams"" - with no identification of each film.

I've watched the film on my standard large screen TV and its really sharp. The computer animation gets better and better. And the sound on the standard DVD was perfect too!

As for the film itself, I liked it though I don't think its Disney's best. The songs by Alan Menken sound more like they were written for a Broadway show then for the films he previously composed for.

So, yes I enjoyed it. And would recommend. I just wish that Disney would provide those people with standard DVD players some of the bounues that is only on the BR disc. After all,  many of these do not use the BD component.

1170656,5,7799128836,"A fun film that has entertained both my family and customers of all ages passing through my store. The Disney BD did not disappoint on quality and value for the price, albeit several features are worth skipping.

The picture quality is as expected - virtually flawless and very colorful. The 7.1 DTS is great, though most of the outer channel usage was with Maximus and the dam breaking, still worthwhile to have the extra two speakers going though. The supplements are a mixed bag and include:

* Deleted scenes, 3 @ 12:36 minutes. Directors intro for each, all still in the sketch mode. Nothing worth watching unless you like the rough draft edits.
* Original Storybook Openings, 2 versions @ 8 minutes. Both with intros, and both providing only a couple tidbits of additional details.
* 50th Feature Countdown, 2 minutes. Way too fast as they show a brief clip from each film accompanied by a number but no titles. Even pausing each one for customers to guess was not enough - too quick and not enough info.
* Extended Song Sequences, 2 @ 7:48 minutes. The ""Life Begin"" and ""Mother Knows Best"" songs, mixed in with sketch and CGI animation to show the extensions, glad they were cut down.
* Untangled, making of, 12:27 minutes. Hosted by Mandy Moore and Zach Levi. Shows some decent background on the production process mixed in with trivia and lots of cheese by those two as they try to provide some painful laughs. Not sure what the target audience was as I liked some of the information (that might bore kids) but their comedy attempts were horrible.
* Tangled Teasers, 9 totaling 10 minutes. Each is an animated minute of almost South Park-themed skits. One was an obvious take on a certain prescription medication that helps men. Wish I could say why these were even included...kids will miss some of the humor.
* The Disney 3D intro with the Lion King critters - old.
* The Disney intro to Digital Copy.
* Info: The pointless paragraph about commentaries.

French and Spanish soundtracks with English 2.0 Descriptive Service and subs in same. I enjoyed the movie and BD quality, but the extras are almost bizarre in both production and/or why they were included. Still have to give it a 5-star review for overall worth with the DVD and Solid BD specs. Region coded A/B/C.

EDIT: Forgot to mention that the opening of the BD has a VERY small menu along the bottom that you have only a few seconds to select that allows you to bypass the hideous amounts of Disney material/trailers/promos. It goes by fast but it is sooooo worth it - I was giving this a 5-star before even seeing the rest just for that. The catch is you have to scroll through several options to get to PLAY MOVIE and it goes to the trailers if you have not hit enter before it transitions.",1300924800,6,2926,4.83433133732535
1170657,5,7799128836,"All the reviews before me have pretty much said it already, but I'll say it anyway: this is a fabulous movie!  I thought the ads looked very appealing and couldn't wait to see it and wasn't disappointed at all.  Both my mom and I went to see it and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I'm going to see it again this weekend and can't wait; it's like I'm a little kid again.  The movie is witty and hilarious, the story charming and heartwarming, and the lantern scene really is beautiful to watch and listen to.  Maximus by the way is honestly my most favorite Disney animated character EVER.  He completely steals the show!  Pascal and the Snuggly Ducklings thugs do too, to a degree, but no one is better than Maximus.

I must say that I'm very impressed that Disney managed to both modernize the Rapunzel fairy tale while keeping it very true to the spirit of the classic tale.  All the classic Disney fairy tale elements are there but unlike some past Disney princesses, Rapunzel is feisty and determined and not at all the usual passive damsel-in-distress waiting to be rescued by a handsome prince who she marries five seconds later.  Thank you Disney for finally bringing a princess to screen who has her own mind and courage and determination and isn't afraid to use them!  And also major props to Disney for the character of Mother Gothel, probably one of the most interesting but also complex Disney animated movie villainess we've ever had.  (Btw she may be mean and evil but I still want her outfit she wore in the movie).

The only minor quibble I can add to this is (and I will get flamed for this)...as good as Zach Levi's singing voice is, I kind of wish they'd gotten an actual singer to do it.  Zach had a good and solid voice but I felt like Mandy's voice really outshone his in ""I See the Light"" and wished they'd gotten someone like Josh Groban to sing his part.  Sorry, Zach.  But both his and Mandy's acting were wonderful, as was Donna Murphy as the fantastically theatrical Mother Gothel.  The songs are great though and I enjoyed all of them.  ""I Have a Dream"" will definitely give you the giggles.

Nothing online, hadn't heard anyone talk about it, I mean it was an absolute null to me. But I generally really like Disney and Pixar movies, so when I came across it, I had to see it with my 7 year old.

To say I was blown away would be putting it mildly.  I didn't know Mandy Moore did the voice, but as soon as the first song started, I recognized it straight off.  Same with Zachary Levi.  Now Mandy I could see, since I've loved her voice ever since I saw A Walk to Remember.  Zachary was a surprise, having known him only from the series Chuck, I never thought of him as a voice actor.

And after seeing the movie a few times, I can't picture any other choices doing as good of a job.  They both do an outstanding job of emoting.  Both in the songs and in the dialog, the inflections are just absolutely perfect.  Her squeak when she first hits him.  His ""Surrounded by enormous piles of money"" in the ""I've Got a Dream"" song...  The way her voice shifted so well in her bipolar scene...  It was the little touches like that which put this movie right to the top for me.

Songs?  I had to buy the soundtrack and it's all my son wants to listen to now, whether on the TV (I use a media center PC for my TV so it's all available), on the computer, or on the ipod in the car.  We're singing tangled songs all over the place.  I found these songs to be my all time favorites now from any of the animated musicals.  I never thought they'd get anyone to shine better in their musical animations than Jodi Benson (hope I spelled that right) from the Little Mermaid, but Mandy Moore nailed it.  Songs are incredibly rich and have a lot of depth musically, and as always, are hilarious and very, very enjoyable.  Even the score for the rest of the movie was great, and I crank the music from the dancing scene when I'm driving around too, great stuff.

The animation was wonderful, and the job they did with her hair, as well as the horse's expressions (as someone else mentioned in a review, the horse is a riot), and Pascal, the Chameleon...  Was everything that Disney is known for when they're doing their jobs well.

Another review also mentioned the poor marketing job and such, which I guess I can attest to at a different level, as I had not noticed anything at ALL about it until March 2011 here, a few weeks ago.  But despite that, this has shot right to my number one animated movie...  And I never thought I'd see ANYTHING supplant that spot for my 7 year old, above Cars and Wall-E...  But this one did for both of us.

1170662,5,7799128836,"Disney's long tradition of musical animation never dies. Once again the company's latest work ""Tangled"" proves that. This is a family picture everyone can enjoy, telling a good story about characters you relate to, with a healthy dose of action and comedy. But what is most impressive is the film's breathtakingly beautiful colors that saturate the animation's fairy tale world.

Based on a tale collected by the Brothers Grimm, ""Tangled"" revolves around a 18-year-old girl Rapunzel living in a high tower among the woods. In fact, she was kidnapped as a baby from the king and the queen by Gothel, an elderly woman who knows the special power Princess Rapunzel possesses. Not knowing the world outside (and her true identity), Rapunzel dreams of traveling to see thousands of lights that float in the sky once a year.

""Tangled"" mixes the orthodox ""boy-meets-girl"" theme with fairy tale elements (though any sexual allusions of the original tale are carefully removed). The film keeps a steady pace with musical sequences, action scenes and nice comic turns from fearsome-looking (but actually likable) thugs drinking at a tavern, plus one non-speaking animal, Pascal the chameleon. Also, Maximus, a white horse of the royal guard, is a real scene stealer, who deserves his own movie.

But what makes ""Tangled"" really special is its rich colors and lush textures. The amazing sky lantern scene is one of the many highlights of the film. This alone would be enough to give the film four stars or even more.",1300233600,4,1506,5.016

- animation is some of the greatest I have ever seen, it's absolutely gorgeous
- story is fresh and new, a great new spin on an old story
- score is spot on throughout
- voice acting is exceptional

The only caveat I have is that the songs were very good, just not on the level with the Lion King, but this isn't a fair critique.

I have no qualms with recommending this movie to EVERYONE.  A rare CGI movie that has a feel that isn't CGI and another gem that is on the same level as Pixar.  With great movies like this and Dreamworks 'How to Train Your Dragon', Pixar finally has some really competition, something that only is a win win win for the consumer!!

When I go see an animated movie, I am not looking for serious plot, serious music, or serious anything, come to think of it.
I am looking for entertainment.
Period.
""Tangled"" gave me that.
BOY, did it ever give me that!
I saw it first with my sis-in-law...we are both in our late 60's.  Then, when my granddaughter (she's 5) said she'd seen it, loved it, wanted to see it again...I was happy to oblige, and off we went.
It was even better the second time around because I didn't have to think much about the plot, I could focus on the outstanding animation and the humor--the over-the-top, truly funny humor.
(Most of the 'funny' films these days have a humor rating that equals a junior-high locker room, either gender.)
That horse steals the show!
I'm from the generation that was the first to see ""Snow White"".  The animation in that film defies description when you remember that it was done literally stroke by stroke.
I don't want to know how they did ""Tangled"", it would spoil the magic.
To debate plot line, etc. in this film is a waste of time.
Just sit back and ENJOY it.",1298764800,15,1163,4.455399061032864

Sometimes, when you see movie trailers, the movie will look good, but, you end up being disappointed after you see it.  That wasn't the case, for me, with this movie.  The characters were very colorful and full of life.  It was an interesting, humorous take on the classic story of Rapunzel.  It is also obvious from the DVD cover picture that it had the kind of humor that I love.",1298678400,2,479,4.337078651685394
1170674,5,7799128836,"I have to agree with numerous other reviewers: I generally like seeing animated films, but I had no interest in seeing this one when it was first advertised.  Disney spun it as an MTV version of Rapunzel, and it came off cheesey and gimicky.  Over time I kept seeing more and more great reviews and film teasers that actually looked quite gorgeous and well-done.  Finally, my 4 year old asked to see it and we took a chance and brought our whole family (My husband reluctantly agreed, and my 2.5 year old we weren't sure would sit still through it).  My girls, my husband and I sat mesmerized from the first scene to the closing credits.  Only at the very end, when Mother Gothel gets what's coming to her, did my 2.5 year old utter a sound.  As we walked out, my husband, who its fair to say is NOT a Disney fan, and I looked at each other and simultaneously said ""That was AWESOME.""  It really is the best animated movie I have seen in a long time, if not ever.  You feel emmersed in a heightened sense of reality.  The scenes are so saturated and stunning; the rendering of the textures (Rapunzels hair alone is entrancing), facial expressions, the backdrop details... everything is so beautiful that you can't look away.  But on top of the magnificent artwork, there is a wonderfully touching, suspensful, exciting and funny story.  All of the characters are likeable and engaging without being the least bit sappy or helpless and my daughters fell completely in love not just with the strong but conflicted title character, but with Flynn and Maximus as well.  The songs and lighting effects are very reminiscent of a broadway stage production and really add to the suspense/drama/tenderness of the scenes.
I could go on but I think you get the picture.  Someone said the Academy overlooked this for Best Animated feature in 2010... I don't know how that's possible.  To me it is on an entirely other plane from any other animated film out last year.  I highly recommend it.",1298592000,16,1979,4.614285714285714

The movie is available in various digital media formats and with various bonus features depending on your purchase choice.  But all of that is secondary --  if it isn't a good movie, ultimately the bonus features are empty and don't matter.  ""Tangled"" IS a good movie and worthy of adding to your library.  Young and old will both find it charming, funny, and delightful.

As a fan of all things Broadway, I was extra pleased to hear that Broadway veteran Donna Murphy was featured in this.  She is a great actress with a tremendous singing voice.  She brings a lot to her villainous role in ""Tangled"" and lends the requisite amount of dramatic weight to the proceedings.

I truly believe Disney has returned to its glory with the movie Tangled.  The Princess and the Frog was way too dark, and it was hard for children to understand.  However, with Tangled, the fun has returned to the movies.  The music, action, and characters all worked to bring the movie alive.  My grandchildren, who ranged from 2-6 years old, were held captive by the story.  Yes, the ""mother"" was disturbing, but it took just a quick explanation that she was not a real mother to Rapunzel because she did not treat her like a mother should.  It's a shame that others have found fault with this movie.  It beat the competition hands-down. I am a teacher of middle-school children, and I recommended it to all of them. Many came back and told me how much fun it was to watch.  I am hopeful that more movies will continue in this vein.  I'm really tired of dirty language and situations of questionable morals as the fare that is dished up for our children.

I don't really remember being so awed by a cartoon until many years later when I saw Beauty and the Beast.  Lion King, of course, is in a class by itself.  Now I must add Tangled to the list of great Disney animation.  I never expected to see an animated film this well done again in my lifetime.  The characters are exceptional.  Rapunzel is an absolute delight.  I cannot imagine how Rapunzel could be improved.  The villain, Mother Gothel, is a complex, chilling character, again nearly perfect.  The music is divine.  The songs and dance (this is a musical) are wonderfully Broadway-like.  Except for the fancy new animation technology, this film could have been made, as is, in any Disney era, all the way back to the time of Snow White.  That is great praise indeed. I often complain that they don't make'em like they use to.  I have no complaints with Tangled.  If you are older, do yourself a favor and buy this movie.

I have to admit that I had heard so many positive things about Tangled before I saw it that I started to doubt whether it could be all that good.  As a result, I found my expectations lowering, and I went into the show with a critical eye.  What I found surprised me.  It was THAT good!

The villian in this show is worthy of being grouped with Disney's best.  She is conniving, despicable, manipulating, and, well, evil...all to meet her own personal needs.

The stroryline, characters, and their interactions were top-notch through and through.  I have to admit that one of my favorite character-character interactions was between Flynn Rider and the horse Maximus...you'll see.

It was soon obvious that Tangled works at multiple levels: small children, tweenagers, teens, and adults.

I happened to see the film in a theater that was completely packed (and in 3D).  When the movie ended there was actually applause.  The crowd liked it that well.

I noted that John Lasseter (of Pixar) was the executive producer, but Disney pulled this off on their own...it wasn't a Pixar flick, though it's as good as Pixar releases.

I look forward to the DVD release of this film, since it will certainly be joining my video library.

1170681,4,7799128836,"I liked this movie a lot more than I thought I would. From the previews it had a very Shrek feel about it, with the 3D animation and adult humor. While I enjoyed Shrek, when I think of a Disney cartoon my mind immediately goes to the 'Renaissance' movies like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and The Lion King and the wonderful warm and fuzzy feelings attributed to watching those movies. I have been waiting a long time for the return of those warm fuzzies. Princess and the Frog was an ok movie, but not anywhere near `Renaissance' quality. So when I heard Disney was doing Rapunzel my hopes soared... and crashed when I saw the previews. But the previews were very misleading; even the movie poster tricks you. She's not mischievous as her smirk implies; she's quite nave and sweet. I wouldn't put Tangled in the `Renaissance' category, but I liked the film a lot and laughed for about an hour and half.

Mother Gothel is awesomely evil. She plays mind games with Rapunzel, making her believe everyone is out to capture her for her magical powers and the only way for her to be safe is to remain in the tower. She doesn't hurt Rapunzel and actually takes quite good care of her, making meals she enjoys and buys paints for her murals. But psychological evil is so much more formidable than a poison apple or time-sensitive curse. And really, who doesn't to want to remain young and beautiful? Flynn the bandit is a charming narcissist who only looks after number one, until he meets Rapunzel and can only seem to look at her. He has great one-liners, scruff, and knee-high boots. Pretty much the perfect man. And Rapunzel fits in well with the other Disney Princesses - pretty, kind, and innocent but with a streak of sass. Poor sartorial choices though.

I thought the animation would bother me but I can see why they chose to go that route. There's a lot of hair swinging and flying around that was enhanced by the 3Dness, although it did give the people very plastic-looking faces. One thing that did bother me about this movie was the length of her hair seemed to be really inconsistent. At times it appeared to be crazy long, wrapping around and around in the tower in a dozen loops. Other times it seemed to only trail about a few feet behind her, and at one point it gets braided up in a plait that doesn't even hit the floor.

There aren't any annoying animals, in fact, Rapunzel's little chameleon sidekick is quite the little scene stealer. His facial expressions and gestures are hilarious and adorable. Tangled is fun, humorous, and all around entertaining. It could have been great if the musical numbers were more memorable. In my heart I keep wishing for another ""Part of Your World"" or ""One Jump Ahead,"" but I think it's time to accept that the `Renaissance' era has ended.

1170683,5,7799128836,"Background:

Tangled has its origins from the German fairy tale Rapunzel by the Brothers Grimm.
It was first published in 1812 as part of a collection of children's tales. It is believed that this story was an adaptation from a fairy tale called Persinette by Charlotte-Rose de Caumont de La Force which was originally published in 1698. It is a story that has been beaten to a pulp, and is best know for the line: ""Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair"".

Even further back, this story may seem to be a modified feminized version of the Biblical story of Samson as related to in the book of Judges chapter 13. Here because Samson was a Nazarite a razor was never allowed to touch his hair.

Marketing and Sales:

This film was originally titled and marketed as Rapunzel, however, at the last minute the name was changed to Tangled. It is the second most expensive film ever made and most expensive animated film ever made with a budget of $260 million. Tangled is also notable for being the third-highest grossing animated film in the Disney animated canon (unadjusted for inflation), behind The Lion King ($783,841,776) and Aladdin ($504,050,219).

Overview:

Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) is just about to turn 18 years old. She wants a special gift, to go outside of the tower that she has been in for her entire life. Her mother, Mother Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) buntly refuses. As an alternative, she asks for more paint (she paints as one of her many past times in the tower). Mother Gothel agrees to go for it, but it's a 3-days journey away.

While she is away, Rapunzel manages to strike up a bargain with Flynn Rider, a thief on the run (voiced by Zachery Levi). At this point her voyage to the outside world begins.

Rating:

It is quite surprising that this 100 minute animated feature has been given a rating of PG instead of G. In my opinion this may be due to the emotional and psychological content that Mother Gothel generates by her deceptive and manipulative relationship with Rapunzel. (since there is no nudity or offensive language in this film)

Plot:

Gothel observes a single drop of pure sunlight hit the ground, creating a magical flower with the ability to heal the sick and injured, as well as keep someone young by singing to it. Centuries past as she maintains her youth. Until the pregnant queen of a nearby kingdom gets sick. Her guards manage to retrieve the flower and make a broth out of it. The queen is healed, however, as a side-effect, her daugther is born with hair with the same magical properties.

Gothel realises this and kidnaps the child and raises her as her own. But, every year on Rapunzel's birthday, the kingdom sends thousands of floating lanterns into the sky longing for their lost princess to return. Rapunzel desires to find the source of these lights a theit true purpose.

Conclusion:

This is an excellent family film, with lots of musical content as well as humor. Highly recommended.",1298073600,2,2956,4.703488372093023
1170684,5,7799128836,"When I saw the first advertisement for this film, I was a bit turned off because it looked like one of those twisted alternate fairy tale movies; where something goes wrong that's totally unexpected and hilarity (or just plain wrongness) ensues.  The title change was a bit of a turnoff for me at first too.  But as I did some research on the film and started seeing the previews, I started to think that maybe I was wrong.  I also came to forgive the title change because I realized that judging a film by its title is just like judging a book by its cover.  And because I found out that they did that because they wanted a title that represented both main characters, not just the female lead.  I was also pleased to find that the company was now trying to market more towards boys; which as a man, I appreciate.  After all, the princesses have been getting all the attention for years.  Let the heroes have some!

Right, so anyhue...

Not only did the movie have some real catchy songs, memorable characters, and parts that were absolutely hilarious; but despite a few changes, the movie's basic plot remained mostly true to the original story.  I don't want to spoil any of it though.  If there was one thing I didn't like, it was seeing the short old guy traipsing around in his underwear.  Although there was a scene later on where he made me laugh.

Another great thing about this movie is that in most CGI films there are 2 things you don't see being animated since it apparently takes a lot of work: hair and bare feet.  But Disney stepped up to the challenge and did an excellent job animating both of those things.  You never even see characters doing so much as combing their hair in most CGI movies, whereas Rapunzel's hair... well, need I say more?  CGI movie characters also have shoes on all the time and in the extremely rare cases when they don't, you don't see much of their feet (not that that's necessarily a bad thing).  Rapunzel on the other hand, is always barefoot in the movie and her feet are almost always visible.  Just a little side note: Quentin Tarintino apparently said that Tangled was one of his favorite films of all time.  Hmm... I wonder why that is.  Anyway, all that just goes to show what a better job Disney does when it comes to animation.

In conclusion, Tangled has turned out to become an outstanding movie; which I can't wait to own on DVD.  Oh, but that brings me to one more tiny little thing I didn't like about the movie: it was released in theaters in November, so it couldn't be released on DVD in time for Christmas.",1297814400,9,2570,4.423404255319149

And then it happens. Mid movie. You'll know it when you see it. That piece of Disney Magic that you know no other creators could make. That scene that was written just to touch your heart. Your eyes light up, you might get a little teary even though it isn't sad... It's just magic.

Tangled is fantastic. I preordered it. I saw it in theatres 8 times. I bought the soundtrack.

I don't do that with movies that aren't amazing. In fact... I've never done that before in my life.

Buy this movie. It doesn't matter if you're one or 100, you'll love it.",1297555200,21,798,4.264900662251655
1170688,4,7799128836,"I saw Tangled in the theater in 3-D.  That may have been a slight mistake as it does wash out the color impact of the film but I do appreciate how far 3-D technology has come.

While Tangled was probably a very smart balancing act between emotional depth and quick-paced breezy comedy to keep the kid's attention I left the theater feeling there was a missed opportunity.  Although there is probably a strong cross-pollination between DreamWorks and PIXAR now, I'd love to know what a PIXAR screenplay could have looked like.  Something darker, maybe even Shakespearian (with an up-beat ending), could have created a true CGI classic (although Toy Story 3 was getting close).

  The simple incorporation of some true emotional problems experienced by anyone locked in a tower for 18 years by a self-serving witch could have been a step off in a totally different direction... but, yes, it's hard to sell dolls that way.  If Mother Gothel in the original story was a kind of witch-for-hire then what if Rapunzel were a witch-for-hire-in-training?  This would be her excuse to have a mission to leave the tower, even if it wasn't technically authorized.  Madcap mayhem, cold terror, and redemptive love would ensue.

While comparisons with Aladdin, Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast, are obvious and relevant, this was in many ways a much more intimate film.  The entire film was based around the initially divergent interests of three people, and other than a very short production number in a bar and an equally short and spontaneous dance in the village square there were no big crowd scenes having to do with oddly dancing to choreography or carrying pitch forks and torches.

  Unfortunately it's hard to appreciate the subtleties of all aspects of the animation in one viewing pass and there are certainly things to appreciate in Tangled that can easily be missed the first time around.  That's why they invented DVD's.",1297468800,,1930,4.928792569659443

Sure, in the past 5 years Disney has had some ""cute"" movies but this one brings Disney back to the era of The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin. First of all, Alan Menkin, the man who wrote all of the aforementioned movies songs, wrote ALL the songs for Tangled. Also the storyline is great, I really didn't plan on seeing this movie(I'm 19 years old)and all my friends said ""No, you have too! It's sooooo good!"" and they were right.",1297296000,7,554,4.388349514563107
1170691,5,7799128836,"I have to admit that I've become jaded and cynical when it comes to Disney and their ridiculous amount of merchandising which includes a TV show or a movie, and not the other way around, i.e., a movie or TV show that includes some merchandise. This was my attitude towards ""Tangled"".

Also, the trailer looked cute, but would the movie really be more than just fluff? On the other hand, did the trailer truly reflect the feel of the movie? Take, for instance ""UP"" which was portrayed as a light-hearted and funny film in the trailers, and not the slightly scary and slightly dark film with mean pack dogs and a villain trying to kill a cute, small kid.

But, as the mother of a 7 year old girl who was dying to see it, I gave in, and we saw it. And, I'm happy to say. I loved it, and so did my 7 year old and my 12 year old girl. It was charming and funny and had just the right variety of characters - light and dark - to make it interesting without being too scary, as well as, just the right amount of action versus mushy scenes to make it enjoyable, not too fast moving to be impossible to keep up with, and not so slow to wonder when it would end. We loved the songs, the silliness, Rapunzel, Flynn, the king's horse out to get them both, Rapunzel's strength and building realization of who she was. Also, there were no adult-humor hidden inuendos (like in Shrek and other not-G-rated movies that really are not for kids).

We loved it. It would be hard to beat the magic of The Little Mermaid, which was hard to beat till Beauty and the Beast came along. I'm not sure Tangled beats either of those movies, but it comes close!

1170697,5,7799128836,"Without female companionship, it's hard to go see Tangled and still maintain an air of manliness and virility. So, abandoning all hope of preserving that faade, I decided to go all the way to the deep end of the lame pool and see it with my parents. And for once, the dearth of self-confidence that inspired me to long ago stop vying for success with the fairer sex paid off, because when the dust settled and the credits rolled, there was only one fact left standing, and it towered above all other thoughts and insecurities: Tangled was AWESOME!

What a cast of characters! Zachary Levi, or Chuck from Chuck (for those of you who watch my favorite television show), is perfectly charming as Flynn Rider, the shallow and selfish thief whose good looks are rivaled only by Narcissus. Immediately likeable despite his negative qualities, Flynn Rider's journey toward empathy is one which is quickly obvious, and yet it is so flawlessly executed that I found his transformation transfixing at every turn.

As for Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), well, I was pretty much in love with her the moment I saw her. The epitome of innocence, Rapunzel is a drop of sunshine in the darkness. Her unadulterated joy is contagious, infecting even the most jaded and cynical. It was a pleasure to see how people changed when touched by such a fair creature, whether it be a group of thugs singing about their dreams or innumerable citizens breaking out into dance in the streets. Again, Rapunzel's character arc was rather obvious: from an obedient girl afraid of the world to a real person living her life. And again, it didn't matter, because that arc was artfully crafted.

Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) is an understandable villain. I mean, Rapunzel's magic hair gives her eternal youth. If that's not a good reason for keeping your daughter in a tower, I don't know what is. The two characters of a different genus deserve quite a bit of recognition themselves. Pascal the chameleon makes for an excellent sidekick to Rapunzel. He's just about the cutest thing ever (right behind How to Train Your Dragon's Toothless), and his indignant looks are a great counterpoint to Rapunzel's innocent absurdity. Even Maximus, the head guard's horse, is an amazing character with a story of his own. He tracks Flynn Rider with brutal determination, but as per usual, ends up joining the team.

Honestly, this movie has the perfect setup. You see, Flynn Rider is a character you can really get behind. Sure, he doesn't care about other people, but his charm makes him unarguably, well, charming. Oh, and Rapunzel is a character you can really get behind. The opposite of Flynn, she is trusting and cares deeply for everyone, and yet she has much to learn about the world. We love both characters from the beginning, and the traits that make each of them so great directly reflect the other's flaws, so when fate brings them together, we get to watch an incredible relationship blossom.

Plus, there were a couple of little lines that broke the fourth wall in an amusing way. At one point, Flynn Rider calls Pascal a frog. Rapunzel, offended, points out that it's a chameleon, to which Flynn responds ""Nuance."" Bringing up the clich of a princess and a frog is especially amusing, since Disney's last animated film was titled The Princess and the Frog. Also, like I said, Mother Gothel isn't particularly villainous during the film, just a bit attached to the idea of immortality. Now, when she argues with Rapunzel, she always complains that Rapunzel is ""making her the bad guy."" Well, I really wanted her to be the bad guy so I could cheer when she got her comeuppance, and then finally, much to my delight, she snaps, saying ""You want me to be the bad guy? Fine. Now I'm the bad guy."" To her, she was harkening back to those old arguments, but to me, she was talking directly to the audience, letting us know that it was ok to root against her.

If I had one complaint, and I do, it would be that the songs didn't quite live up to my expectations. They were still excellent, but they were a bit more ponderous than some Disney tunes. With the exception of ""I've Got a Dream,"" they were slow, character-heavy numbers that, while still of a high quality, lacked the pizzazz that got the Aladdin soundtrack stuck so firmly in my head.

But the songs certainly didn't detract from the experience. The dialogue was sharp, the animation was beyond beautiful, and the movie was both touching and hilarious. And as an added bonus, there was a lot of great insight into human nature. I cared for those characters, and the film was able to jerk my emotions around however it wanted. My sides hurt from laughing, my eyes ached from tears. Flynn's charm and Rapunzel's joy didn't just affect the other characters; they reached right out of that screen and touched me too, and because of that, I give Tangled:

5/5 Stars

The only truly sad thing about this movie was that Rapunzel ended up becoming a brunette. Oh, the humanity!

Its seriously a miracle for my girl to sit quietly through a movie in a theatre twice ever, which goes to show how much she loves it.  Anyways, it is by far our favorite version of Repunzel, our favorite new Disney Princess and current movie for her.  I also loves the focus on the male lead, not just the female, and his background and growth during the film.

I think that's why both the girls AND the boys liked it.  It's not overly girly, but girly enough for our 4 1/2 year old daughter to love it as well.  Our 3 year old son loved it too (and he won't usually sit through any movie other than Cars and Toy Story).

I have to admit that Rapunzel's fight with herself after leaving the tower was a bit odd, but I don't think it ruined anything.  Mother Gothel was a great villain . . . almost too great.  She is VERY manipulative and I almost thought it was too much for a movie aimed at younger children.  Mother Gothel's cleavage was a bit much.  I mean, it's a kids movie!

I thought this was MUCH better than most of the recent Disney movies (It seems like Disney has tried to reach a different audience and has gotten cruder and ruder and just lost the whole Disney feel the last several years (Bolt, The Incredibles, Shrek Forever After - awful!, etc.)  I am torn about the Princess and the Frog.  It was kind of good, but had strange undertones (for instance, I don't think they should do voodoo in a kids movie!), so it's not in our house.  Anyway, this seems to feel a bit more like a Disney movie (while still feeling updated).

Overall, we really enjoyed the movie.  Much better than most that have come out recently!  We'll buy the DVD when it comes out.",1296000000,6,1437,4.227941176470588

I think I was just as excited as she was to see the movie.  From start to finish our complete attention was on the movie.  Usually my daughter gets bored with a movie and wants to change seats and go up and down the steps...not this time!  She sat and watched the whole thing with me!

Tangled is a well written, fairly well paced film. The graphics were amazing!
I was especially impressed with the renderings & textures of Rapunzel's hair, & the worn wood around her window/doorway in the tower, beautiful work!

My only criticism is about 2/3rd's of the way thru the movie, I felt it dragged and could've been shortened by a couple of minutes, but all in all, a wonderful, classic Disney princess movie that should stand proud next to Snow White, Cinderella & the Little Mermaid.",1295913600,2,602,4.733333333333333
1170703,5,7799128836,"I took my 3 1/2 year old son to the theater to see this movie the first week it came out and I wasn't expecting anything great, or that we would even make it through the whole movie.  Boy, was I wrong!  We actually went back 2 weeks later to see it again, and I have pre-ordered it on Amazon for it's April 2011 release as I think it is well worth spending the money on to add to our collection.

At first glance, I thought this movie was based mainly for girls, which at my sons age I don't mind because he really just likes the colors, songs, and funny side plots that happen through your typical Disney movie.  He enjoyed this one so much(much more than Princess and the Frog) and I felt after watching the film that it had a little something for everyone: lots of action, beautiful animation and colors, a really great take on the Rapunzel plot, plenty of laughs, and did I mention the songs?  The songs were wonderful!!!  I can't remeber a recently made Disney movie where I enjoyed the music so much.  Parents, you will definitely appreciate the humor in this movie.  There is a horse named ""Maximus"" in it and he will steal every scene he is in - he was in parts that I was crying I was laughing so hard.

The three main characters: Rapunzel, Flynn Rider, and Rapunzel's mother, are very well fleshed out, and the side characters (wait until the scene at the tavern they stop into - there is definitely a cast of characters there).
If you have kids, do yourself a favor and get this movie when it comes out on DVD for your next family movie night.  You will be pleasantly surprised and definitely entertained.",1295827200,2,1616,4.338870431893688
1170704,4,7799128836,"Disney looks like it's going to have a great year. With the eye-popping TRON: Legacy recently unleashed on cinemas, its follow up is the equally impressive, though decidedly more traditional Disney fare of Tangled, a clever reworking of the Rapunzel fairy story.

Both are supposed to be amongst the most expensive movies ever made. That's a pretty big punt for one studio in the austere times of 2010.

But then, when you celebrate, you should do it in style. As the opening titles roll, Disney announces that Tangled is its 50th feature length animation, and in that spirit I suppose it has tried to throw in something for everyone, and impressively, has succeeded. There's the princess in the tower, musical numbers, a Robin Hood- like rascally hero, and a wide cast of hilarious bit parts including a gang of villainous but kind-hearted ruffians and what has to be the most scene-stealing horse in motion picture history.

Tangled certainly passed the real acid test: I went armed with two sceptical boys (who professed they'd rather watch TRON: Legacy) and a highly enthusiastic five year old girl, who wanted nothing more than to see a beautiful princess, and all of them came out fizzing.

It's interesting where this places Disney. In the same month that Disney demonstrates with TRON its technical credentials and, perhaps, how far In George Lucas' direction it is prepared to stray from its original mandate, it also shows a marked return to its most classic era - something that has been a deliberate strategy for the company over the last couple of years. For Tangled is fundamentally, an innocent, fun tale. It harks back to Disney's heyday: It is populated by a tried and true Disney archetypes: a classic evil witch of the Cruella de Ville mould, a feisty but fundamentally pre-feminist 18 year-old heroine in Rapunzel herself (in this way contrasting quite markedly with Shrek's Fiona), sidekicks in the form of unlikely but adorable animals, and a cuddly rogues gallery intended only to provide comic relief.

And true to this description Tangled is an altogether less knowing, less arch adventure than any of the Pixar outings to date, where you fancy they've targeted the parents and thrown in the odd jokes to keep the kids engaged. Here, this is a kids' movie pure and simple, and is none the worse for it either: as long as you check your cynical fin-du-sicle attitude at the door, you'll have a ball.

Regular readers will know I'm no great fan of 3D for the sake of it, but here I must say the 3D, and the animation generally, is continually impressive. I find myself rather fatigued by technological advances for the sake of it (well - it's shooting fish in a barrel: after all, there's not much you can't do with enough computer horsepower), but what impresses is the artfulness in which the technology is employed. The sweeping camera angles, clever use of perspective; the beautiful framing of every scene - the musical numbers particularly are brilliantly staged (for me to enjoy them, they'd have to be: I can't stand musicals). A bunch of Pentium processors won't give you that - but it's something Disney has always had a long suit in, and Tangled certainly measures up well against the studio's esteemed standards.

In terms of characters, the cast are (to my limited outlook) relative unknowns and perform a workmanlike fashion, and are never allowed get in the way of the animated wizardry (which is how it ought to be in a Disney film). Mandy Moore does a fine job as Rapunzel; Zachary Levy had a little more trouble with Flynn Rider (or perhaps the character was just less appealing) and Donna Murphy seems to have come direct from Central Casting to play the role of Gothel but in any case all, and every other presence on the screen, was blown out of the water by Maximus, a centurion's horse, who was separated from his rider in a chase scene and made the most of his fifteen minutes of fame (they lasted an hour and a half, at any rate!). Somewhat galling, I dare say, for the voice actors to be outdone by an unvoiced animation, and he wasn't even the only one - there's a delightful running gag about a Marcel Marceau mime also!

Look, it's not Citizen Kane, but if you're nostalgic for the sorts of films Disney used to make, and you're jaded by the world-weary attitude that seems to infect every ""kids"" movie in the digitally animated era, this one will be a breath of fresh air.

1170706,4,7799128836,"I saw Tangled in 2D and I really enjoyed it.  It had a lot of comedy and the music (composed by Alan Menken from Aladdin and other classic Disney movies) was pretty good.  I do want to warn that the story could basically be summed up as a mixture of Aladdin and Snow White with a new twist of Rapunzel.  Though this may not be obvious, I'll explain how I came to this (Spoilers Below):
A thief named Flynn Rider plunders inside the kingdom.  As he escapes the guards (and their horses, one of which his is main foe Maximus) he encounters a princess named Rapunzel.  Rapunzel has magical abilities (when she sings her hair glows and has healing properties) and was kidnapped when she was a baby for them and locked in a tower in a hidden valley.  She is cared for by her kidnapper (Mother Gothel), who she thinks is her mother, but wants to explore the world.  She blackmails Flynn into being her guide and, as they see the sights, they slowly grow to care for each other.  They also befriend Maximus along the way
Meanwhile, Mother Gothel finds out Rapunzel has escaped and enlists Flynn's ex-partners whom Flynn had betrayed to help her.  They track Rapunzel and Flynn down, turn Flynn over to the guards and Mother Gothel knocks out Flynn's partners and returns Rapunzel, who now thinks Flynn betrayed her, to the tower.
As Flynn is being led to the gallows, he realizes Rapunzel is in danger and escapes with the help of Maximus.  Rapunzel realizes she is the princess and is chained up by Mother Gothel.  Flynn arrives and, just as he sees that Rapunzel is chained, gets stabbed by Mother Gothel.  Rapunzel promises to obey Mother Gothel if she can save Flynn, but before she can, Flynn cuts off her hair (thereby removing its magical traits) and Mother Gothel falls out the window as she turns to dust.  As Rapunzel crys over Flynn's body, a magical tear falls on him and heals him, restoring his life.  They return to the palace, Rapunzel is reunited with her family and she marries Flynn.
So the part about a thief stealing from the palace and meeting the princess and falling in love with her is reminiscent of Aladdin (not to mention that Flynn kind of looks like Aladdin as well).  The princess being sent away where noone can find her is from Snow White.  Also, the villain falling to her death and a main character being revived from death by their lover is from Snow White as well.
I know I sound very critical of the movie, but I do want to say I thought it was very good and kept me engaged throughout.  The seen where Rapunzel gets to see the hundreds of floating lanterns that are released on her birthday every year with the hop that she will see them and return was very magical and was a fabulous scene.  Plus, I thought the voice talents of Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi worked very well for Rapunzel and Flynn.  I also want to say that I would not have seen Tangled if I did not think it was going to be good, so I am really just nitpicking at the parts I thought had been borrowed from other movies.
Overall, Tangled was very good and I recommend to everyone who has enjoyed the animated Disney movies of the past.",1295740800,,3136,4.4226086956521735

Whoever was in charge of the previews needs to go back to school. I really love this movie and I almost passed it up as a total yawn-fest. The animation was great, the graphics were beautiful and the characters so very lovable, even the 'thugs' at the pub.

The horse is easily my favorite character for two reasons. First because he was hilarious, his facial expressions were priceless and it was just so much fun to watch his antics. Second because he reminded me alot of my other favorite animated horse from Sleeping Beauty, my all time favorite Disney movie when I was a kid.

As for the problem with girls and their self image, I'd look at the 'evil mother' character as the example in this movie. She always looked young and beautiful and went to great lengths to stay that way, no matter the cost, but that's all she had and she was never happy. By valuing the one thing that is guaranteed *not* to last - youth and outer beauty - she ends up with nothing.",1295654400,2,1098,4.351219512195122

1170713,5,7799128836,"What can I say that hasn't already been said by the other well-written reviews? Probably nothing, but I felt I should say something anyways (and perhaps to prove Disney wrong about young girls not liking fairy tales anymore). I won't repeat the movie synopsis; others have done it already, and better than I could. It's almost impossible to think of enough adjectives to describe this fantastic movie. Let's start with the animation: it is, without a doubt, the most realistic animated movie I have EVER seen. Some shots (especially of people from the back) looked so real I thought the movie had switched to live-action. I didn't see it in 3D, but I didn't have to to be impressed with the very well-executed animation (no wonder this is the second most-expensive movie ever made).

Next, we have Rapunzel herself. I think something I really liked about this movie is how she was portrayed. She's not the typical female you usually see in movies nowadays. She's not the Angelina Jolie action-packed I-can-do-anything-and-don't-you-say-different; she's unsure, somewhat shy, and innocent as a lamb. Yet these qualities are not brought across as something to look down upon, which many movie companies would have you believe. She doesn't flirt once with Flynn (or Eugene, if you prefer), which is unbelievably refreshing.

Then there's Flynn Rider. I just love how he was transformed over the course of the movie. In the beginning, he's a selfish, snarky thief who cares only about himself. As the show goes on, Rapunzel slowly (and quite unintentionally) changes him. By the end of the film, he's learned to care about someone else, to the point where he's willing to put his own life on the line to protect her. The change is gradual enough that it's made fairly believable, so don't be sitting there thinking, ""Oh brother, how unlikely is that?""

And of course, we can't forget Maximus and Pascal. As someone else said, the horse really steals the show. Every time he was on the screen, I ended up laughing. His quick, jerking movements and facial expressions evoked laughter from our audience every time. Pascal is funny as well, with lots of sly looks and a bit of attitude.

I agree with others who have said the music isn't as knock-out as some of the songs from the Disney Renassaince. But they're not terrible, either. I actually found myself humming ""I've Got a Dream"" the other day. And ""I See the Light,"" when coupled with the beautiful floating lantern scene, could almost bring tears to one's eyes.

""Tangled"" is the perfect blend of plot, laughter, and just down-to-earth good-old-fashioned Disney magic. They really out did themselves on this one; I know it's going to be a favorite of mine for years to come.",1295568000,9,2724,4.874730021598272

An enchanting love story that looks great in 3D, this film will be enthralling for all who see it. Alan Menken's music is first-rate, There is humor for all ages, and the development of the relationship between the heroine and the hero will captivate adults. There is a paucity of cute and funny characters, which makes the film appeal to a slightly older audience than the typical Disney fare.

I was surprised at all levels, it is now my favorite movie EVER!

But there is a deeper truth in the movie, a painful one that any immature parent will not be able to stand

The truth that well-intention parents sometimes smother the growth and liberty of their children

""Mother knows best"" is one of the greatest lines in the movie, from an evil person who cares more for herself than from her ""daughter""

Parents will usually not understand the damage they inflict to their own children with the kind of behavior is portrayed in the evil-step mother in the movie, but indeed is a common human flaw from most parents

If you have the courage to look within your soul and see your own psychological blind spots, this is the movie that will help you grow as a parent and will help your children have the courage to be a true independent human adult

1170716,3,7799128836,"I went into this movie not expecting much. Most recent Disney movies have sucked. I was very surprised by the quality of the animation in this film. They put some serious effort into the background scenery, the water flowing, the lighting, ect. Many of those shots are worthy of framing. I did not like the character style, however. It reminded me of my daughter's Barbie movies and was very un-Disneylike when compared to the classics. Not bad, but not what I have grown to love.

The story moved along fairly well with nothing terribly unexpected happening. My biggest disappointment was the music. A great Disney movie uses the music to set the theme for the movie and the music moves the story along. With a few notes you can pick out the theme songs of Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, or even the Rescuers. I can't remember a single song from this forgettable score and I just saw it yesterday. I got the impression the songs were stuck in there because all animated Disney  movies have songs, and not because they actually cared what the songs were.

The only thing that I didn't like was a comment made by Rapunzel's ""mother"" about her getting chubby. I know that she was to be portrayed as being ""bad"" but all other comments that I remember her making were all true. She was anything but chubby and with all the self image problems girls have these days, that will just be added to it. As an adult, I can see that this was to show that her mother was bad, but I don't think little girls are going to get that.

Now it's been a month or so since I saw the show. When my copy arrives from Amazon, I'll revise my review if I'm wrong.",1294876800,,834,4.238993710691824

Now here is a film I was not expecting much from, that delivered an amazing time at the movies! What a discredit to the film, the trailer for Tangled was. It's a take on the timeless tale of Rapunzel: the girl with incredibly long hair who has been locked away in a tower. Disney has revamped the story, complete with some zany modern day jargon and the vocal talent of Mandy Moore.

Disney takes us back to the likes of classic stories such as Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. Tangled is a much simpler film than those, as far as plot and characters are concerned, but it feels just as magical. The animation is stunning, and there is some amazing cinematography; something I really enjoy seeing amidst the colorful backdrop of an animated landscape. Oh, Rapunzel's tall tower, tucked away at the edge of a forest by a waterfall. It reminded me of something Lara Croft would stumble across in a Tomb Raider game.

The movie is also very funny. We meet a guy named Flynn (voiced by Zachary Levi) who much like Aladdin, is a thief but isn't the worst of guys. He's hilarious, charming and cunning and he's about to meet his match: Rapunzel.

Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) was kidnapped at a young age by an evil woman fed up with her aging looks. She took her from her home because she possesses a few very strange gifts that allow her to work miracles. The one of most importance to our villain being that when she sings, her hair glows and can transform the decrepit old woman into one hot little animated dish of yummy. The woman raises Rapunzel as her own daughter.

Every year on Rapunzel's birthday, magical lights that hold meaning to the story, light up the sky. She is fascinated by this and dreams of seeing them up close, as she can only see them from her window. For fear that she will be found out; the mother forbids her from ever leaving the dusty old tower that is so high up, access can only be gained by the lowering of a very long rope. Or a very long ponytail!

Naturally, Flynn happens upon Rapunzel's tower by mistake when fleeing from someone he's just robbed. While her mother is away on a three day trip, Rapunzel decides to call on the aid of Flynn. Stashing away his precious stolen high dollar item, she blackmails him into taking her to see the lights before she will return it to him.

And thus their adventure begins, and only looks better in 3D, so go see it!",1294704000,,2674,4.5041322314049586
1170719,5,7799128836,"I'm sure I won't be surprising many people when I say that I think Disney is really lousy nowadays.  They seem to spend most of their time creating pop music icons (they currently have THREE circulating) and horrendously badly acted high school dramas, and their last animated feature, the incredibly hyped and incredibly average The Princess and the Frog, seemed more like a cheap attempt to make money on the novelty of a ""black Disney princess"" than a genuine strive for cultural diversity.  So when I saw the horrendous trailer for ""Tangled,"" which seemed to present the movie as one of those ""hip, modern""-type retellings and actually used the phrase ""she's been grounded for, like, EVER!"", I think I was justified in thinking the film would be lousy.  But just as one must never judge a book by its cover, one must also always remember that the people who make the trailers are NOT the people who make the film.  It's a shame, really: that trailer was so misrepresentative of the film that not only I but many people like me (college students who loved the classic Disney films) either didn't see the film at all, or didn't see it for over a month until word of mouth finally convinced us.  The movie is awesome.

If you're wondering why I included so much personal information in this review, it's because I just know there are many other classic-Disney fans like myself who don't want to see Tangled because they think it looks lousy.  And to those people I say this: I know where you're coming from, but just watch the dang movie.  It's fantastic.  It's right up there with all the classic Disney Princess films... in fact, it might be my second favorite, just behind ""Beauty and the Beast.""  It's not ""hip"" or ""edgy,"" it's a classic fairy tale with one important twist right at the beginning which forms the premise of the entire plot.  And the twist isn't stupid, either, it's very well-conceived and gives the tale the dramatic weight it needs.

The film had me in tears before any characters even spoke (not counting the opening narration).  Not because of the plot or any sort of emotional scene, but because the first daytime exterior shot of Rapunzel's tower is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen in an animated feature.  The entire movie is vibrant, alive, colorful, and overall a joy to behold.  Rapunzel's hair is certainly the best CG hair ever programmed, and the characters are animated in a way that makes them seem just like their older, hand-drawn predecessors.  But by far most of the beauty in this film comes from the scenery and environments.  The grass is luscious springy, bright green, the water sparkles and flows, and the... ""lights"" (I'm avoiding spoilers here) are also tear-inducing from sheer aesthetic splendor (to say nothing of that scene's emotional content).  You'll never get tired of just looking at the sights this film has in store.

Characters?  I don't want to spoil, but rest assured they are wonderfully written, animated, and voice-acted, with memorable personalities and some great visual gags.  I will say, however, that the animal sidekick Pascal is one of the weakest animal sidekicks Disney has created for its films.  There's nothing annoying or BAD about him, but... he just doesn't have very many good shots, and the few hilarious things he does are only funny because of the interplay with two of the other characters.  Speaking of the two other characters... there is this horse.  And he his hilarious.  He's the animal that Pascal is not; EVERY SINGLE THING HE DOES is animated in a hilariously eccentric way.  It's great.

The music grew on me.  A LOT.  As in... after seeing Tangled for the first time, my main and only criticism was ""the songs weren't that good,"" but after a second viewing I had them stuck in my head for a week.  They're great, with the exception of the opener, which is only good.

Which brings me to my only criticism of this film significant enough to warrant typing: it doesn't start out great.  The film starts out with some backstory, like Beauty and the Beast, animated and, more importantly, NARRATED to give the viewer the key bits of information that will be important later.  But the narration, in my opinion, is unnecessary.  ""Up"" and ""WALL-E"" showed how powerful silence could be in an animated picture, but Disney wasn't paying attention.  Now, if Disney just took the narration out, there wouldn't be quite enough information to make sense of, but I strongly believe that the opening plot setup could easily have been storyboarded in such a way as to convey the necessary info silently (except for the brief song... that can stay).  However, the narration is very well voiced, so it's not BAD, it's just... not amazing.  After this scene is the opening song, which is, as I mentioned earlier, the weakest in the film.  Then that scene abruptly cuts to the other main character in media res... and the movie is fantastic from that point on.  The opening scenes don't ruin the film or even make it lose a star from me, but I still wish Disney would have shown more confidence and put their best foot forward instead of trying to make sure they hook in modern youngsters with obvious narration and a kitschy pop song.

But anyway: if you are cynical about this film because of the state of modern Disney OR its trailer, I hope that this scatterbrained review convinces you otherwise.  So much could be said about this film... I just figured I'd rattle off my favorite things about it and my main criticism and leave it at that.  This is classic Disney greatness.",1294704000,21,5572,4.725672877846791

My son wasn't to thrilled to be seeing another girl movie, but at the end of the film he couldn't stop talking about it. I don't know who liked it more, my son or my daughter. It was a great movie. I actually liked it better then The Princess and the Frog, which I loved. I even came home, skyped my grandmother and told her that she had to see this movie.

My friends and I decided to go to the movies, just to go to the movies, we didn't care what it was.  My first thought was that the movie would be terrible, childish, and a waste of money.  Soon I found it to be just the opposite.  I suppose the movie would be aimed at pre-teens, but I think it is enjoyable for all.  I laughed throughout the movie, I was inspired, and I wanted to go and watch it again as soon as it ended!
I recommend this to everyone!",1294531200,,485,3.9690721649484537
1170722,5,7799128836,"Let's get a few of Tangled's bald spots out of the way...oddly executed and slightly deceptive marketing, a small chip or two in the plot, maybe one musical number that seems contrived, and....um....

Okay, that's pretty much it. This movie is FABULOUS.

Every instant is lively and witty. You actually have to see it numerous times to properly absorb the incredibly crafted dialog and character mannerisms. The first thing you notice is the visual splendor, but the unexpected treasure in Tangled is the heart and emotion to be gleaned from the expressions and interactions between the characters. None of the jokes are cheap and yet every instant is entertaining and engaging. Never have I seen 3D produce such emotive, relatable characters--or 2D for that matter. Thank the lord for good writing. And thank the lord for GLEN KEANE (hero to the animation world)!

The voice casting fits like a glove. I hesitated when I heard Mandy Moore was Rapunzel...but she is stunningly spot on and makes the character the lovable, adorable gift to the world she escapes out into. And Flynn Rider and Mother Gothel are impeccably voiced. IMPECCABLY.

The music has grown on me. To be frank, at first I was underwhelmed. But after hearing the soundtrack more times, I've started admiring Alan Menken's medieval-inspired score, and the incorporations of guitar that subtly lend a mellow soul element that surprisingly complements Tangled so well. The songs are Broadway material. ""Mother Knows Best"" is 100% stage-worthy and the lyrics are chock-full of amusements.

Beyond being an utter work of art in so many senses, Tangled is one of those movies that will improve your day. You will be delighted during every single minute you spend with Disney's 50th animated film.

The DVD is worth the pricetag. But I wholeheartedly recommend seeing it in theaters before it's gone too.",1294444800,3,1866,5.042207792207792
1170723,5,7799128836,"I'm a male in his 20's, and in my opinion this is one of the best animation movies Disney has put out in quite a while. That is disregarding their work with Pixar on Up and Wall-e which were superior films. By the way, Tangled is a much better film than Princess and the Frog could ever dream to be, that film was so boring...",1294185600,3,326,4.030769230769231
1170724,5,7799128836,"I was not terribly enthusiastic about seeing TANGLED, and in fact, I didn't see it for several weeks.  But a slow Sunday afternoon came around, and having seen pretty much everything else...I was coaxed into attending.  And now the film is on my Top 10 for 2010 list!

This is a Disney picture, with the graphic sensibilities of a Pixar film.  I know the two companies are allied, but what I mean is this:  Pixar has had the corner on smart, modern looking, genre-twisting films.  Nary a fairy-tale in sight.  And Disney has the lock on the ""princess"" fairy tale.  Heroine tackles adventures, including some kind of wicked witch-type character, with the help of her animal sidekicks and to a greater-or-lesser degree, the help of a male character destined to be her one true love.  And generally, the Disney movie is in the old, hand-drawn style (such as the excellent PRINCESS AND THE FROG).

But with TANGLED, we get a terrific ""princess"" story, coupled with outstanding CGI animation from Pixar.  It's in 3D, and features the best 3D of the year, in my opinion.  There's a gorgeous scene where thousands of paper lanterns are released into the night sky at once, and as they carry over a lake, their number is multiplied by the reflection in the water.  The moment is jaw-dropping in its beauty...and to be honest, it's worth the price of the 3D upgrade.

TANGLED is the story (loosely) of Rapunzel...the girl who is kept in a tall tower by a wicked old woman who accesses the tower by climbing Rapunzel's LOOOONG hair.  In this film, Rapunzel isn't merely rescued by a roaming prince.  She's spunky, smart and nave about the world about her.  She yearns to leave, even for a short time...and when fate puts a reluctant rescuer in her path (in the form of Flynn Rider...a charming bandit), she sets off on an adventure full of excitement, humor & romance.  And Rapunzel, with her blonde hair and green eyes, looks refreshingly different from Disney beauties of the past.

It sounds very tired...but trust me, Disney makes all the old stand-by themes seem new and fresh.  The animal sidekicks:  a cute-as-can-be chameleon and a tough-as-nails horse.  Song about yearning to see another part of the world:  yep, but it's cute and touching.  Colorful villains: check, but this gang gets to sing one of the funniest songs since Gaston used antlers in his decorating in BEAUTY & THE BEAST.  Chase scenes:  a couple of good ones, including one featuring a collapsing dam.  Pretty scenery:  yep.  This movie has it all.

There are minor problems here and there.  A king and queen who never speak for some reason.  Flynn looks vaguely generic (he's a fun character, though).  But really, the film delivered all I could hope for.  See it...and don't just drag the kids; bring the adults too!",1294012800,2,2785,4.745302713987474
1170725,5,7799128836,My daughter age 6 and I went to see Tangled in theaters (regular version).We liked it so much we also saw it in 3D a week later. We laughed and cried through out the movie. One of my top 5 for Disney!,1294012800,,200,3.7857142857142856
1170726,5,7799128836,"this movie is what i beleive to be an instant classic. although in recent years disney movies have not been as good as the originals, from the very begining of the movie ""Tangled"" i loved it! :)",1293926400,2,194,4.27027027027027
1170727,5,7799128836,"TANGLED, the latest animated film by those clever Disney folks, is an updated take on the classic tale of Rapunzel.  I had the pleasure of seeing this over Christmas with four kids - 3 girls and a boy, ages 13, 10, 7, and 5 - as well as my still single bother-in-law.  And, everyone in this very diverse group had a wonderful time.

TANGLED follows the storyline of the Rapunzel fairy tale, so I won't retell it here.  However, Disney has added humor, music, and enough surprises to turn TANGLED into an delighful, modern story for the 21st century.  Like Tiana from The Princess and The Frog, Rapunzel is not your typical, faint of heart princess; when an intruder breaches her tower, she handily whacks him with a cast iron skillet and makes him her prisoner.  She boldly goes after her destiny and discovers who she really is.  As much as I like Cinderella, Snow White, and Aurora, these new Disney princesses go after what they want, work hard, and, (with help from friends) succeed.  And along the way, they and the ""prince"" end up helping each other.  These are the role models I want for my kids!

The animation in TANGLED is gorgeous, the music (Alan Menken!!!) is outstanding and catchy, and the voice acting is excellent.  Mandy Moore is on point as the spunky, strong willed Rapunzel, and she sings beautifully as well.  Donna Murphy (as the wicked witch) and Zachary Levi (as the roguish intruder) both turn in fine voice and singing performances as well.  The animal characters, Maximus, the intrepid war horse, and Pascal, the Jiminy Cricket-like chameleon, don't talk (for once!), but they convey more in expressions and actions than many human characters.  A lot of the LOL funny moments (and there are MANY in TANGLED) occur with these two, and they alone are worth the price of admission.

Overall, TANGLED is charming, entertaining, and funny - a treat for the entire family.  And I really love these 21st century Disney princesses; they are strong, independent, hardworking, kind, and loving.  Exactly the kind of young women that I hope for my daughters to be.",1293926400,8,2081,4.752089136490251

I loved the fact that, for once, the Princess was smarter, more take-charge and more on top of things than the Hero.  There is a good villainess, some good second level villains, some wonderful characters and sympathetic leads.  The whole story is fun and I can't decide if I liked the horse or the chameleon as the best side-kick.  Other reviewers have already covered the story so I will not bother to go over it again.  It is a fast, fun, new retelling of the old Rapunzel story with plenty of laughs and the requisite happy ending after a couple of surprising twists.  I have already pre-ordered the movie and I can't wait.",1293753600,3,766,4.467625899280575
1170730,4,7799128836,"""Tangled"" continues the rich Disney tradition of adapting age-old fairy tales to the big screen. As with most of their animated films, they start with a well-worn fairy tale, in this case ""Rapunzel"" by the Brothers Grimm, make it a little more modern, add some songs, in this case, all pretty forgettable, and toss in some amusing sidekicks. The twist on this ""Princess"" (I hope Disney doesn't have the word trademarked) tale is the addition of a male hero who has as much, if not more, screen time as Rapunzel. And, of course, the film is presented in 3-D, which now seems to be required of all animated features.

""Tangled"" follows a tried and true formula, the same formula that helps make ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" such classics. John Lasseter, the force behind Pixar, is now in charge of both Disney and Pixar. Thank goodness he recognizes that this formula is necessary and has resurrected it. Disney films will only benefit; they once again have a zippier, funnier pace, more wild and funnier sidekicks and better lead characters. Strangely, these are all of the same things Pixar films are known for.

One of the first things Lasseter did when he took the reigns was to revitalize the animation wing of Disney. How could anyone with even an inkling of childhood magic left within them let such a magical institution lapse? They were no longer going to produce 2-D animation, but Lasseter changed course and the company made ""The Princess and the Frog"", introducing Disney's first African-American princess. ""Frog"" is a lively film set in New Orleans in the 20s featuring a lively, eclectic score. It is a very good film but it is also considered a financial flop. I hope they will continue to make more films in the traditional way. It often creates a much more artistically superior film. They just need to ramp up the creative juices and come up with the next ""Little Mermaid""-esque hit.

Next up, ""Rapunzel""... er, ""Tangled"" which really shows a lot of Lasseter's influence. While the characters have that classic Disney look, they are created by CGI. But this CGI is actually really good. The animation gives everything a rich, full quality, almost as though you are watching a 3-D film without the glasses. The wild and wacky quotient has been upped, giving Rapunzel and Flynn Ryder an assortment of funny supporting characters. Most of these take the form of a group of traveling marauders the heroes encounter at an alehouse. Ron Perlman, Brad Garret, Richard Kiel (Jaws from the James Bond films), MC Gainey and others give these characters voice. There is also a little drunk man who frequently appears with wings and a harp. It sounds strange, but the bizarre quality of some of the characters helps the story move along at a fast, refreshing pace.

The one thing Lasseter seems to have been unable to help is the handful of forgettable songs included throughout. But then again, the Pixar films aren't known for their songs either. I honestly can't remember a single lyric which is shameful given they were all composed by Alan Menken, one half of the duo who made ""Mermaid"", ""Beast"" and ""The Lion King"" so memorable. Mr. Lasseter, if you can't create enough memorable songs, leave them out all together. A bunch of forgettable songs stick out for all of the wrong reasons.

Also, leaving the songs out might prevent you from using pop music stars that provide less than memorable voice work for the lead character. Yes, I'm talking about you Mandy Moore.

Because of the perceived mixed reaction to ""The Princess and the Frog"", the focus of the story was shifted to feature more of the dashing hero, Flynn Ryder (Zach Levi, TV's ""Chuck""), a bandit marauding through the kingdom, trying to get his hands on anything valuable. Given the ""Princess"" phenomenon at the Disney marketing machine, they need to have a pretty young girl at the center of the story, but in an effort to also attract young boys, Flynn becomes the narrator of the story and our guide.

After stealing a crown, Flynn runs from the royal guard and soon finds himself in the middle of the glen, deep in the forest, looking at a tall tower. He climbs to the chamber sitting at the top and feels he is safe. But he is quickly knocked out. When he comes to, he realizes Rapunzel, a teenager with seventy-foot long hair, has captured him. Rapunzel lives in the tower with Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy), who is away, and the young lady has never left the tower. Flynn desperately searches for his satchel (and the crown) and learns Rapunzel has hidden it. Her ransom? She wants Flynn to take her to see the floating lights that appear every year on her birthday. If he does this, he will get his satchel back. He reluctantly agrees and they are off. Shortly thereafter, Mother Gothel returns and panics. She has her own selfish reasons for keeping Rapunzel in the tower. Along the way, Flynn and Rapunzel run into an odd assortment of characters.

""Tangled"" is beautiful to watch, funny, moving at times and a worthy addition to the Disney tradition. Too bad they couldn't come up with more memorable songs to add to the magic.

I really, truly hope this is the beginning of a new renaissance at Disney. It would be so nice to start to see some films that can once again rival the magic of the more recent classics """"Mermaid"", ""Beast"", ""Lion King"". It would be even more spectacular to see some films that might be able to rival the original classics ""Snow White"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Bambi"", ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""Cinderella"". If anyone can pull this off, it is Lasseter.",1293667200,,5571,4.735051546391753

We have had the joy of sharing the fun and excitement of annual Disney vacations, the daily fun of the Disney channel, but most of all the magic that is Disney animation. Pixar has had all the animation thunder and been carrying this torch for quite some time. However, that is no longer true. At a recent screening in our local multiplex, me and the kids sat down for an afternoon showing of Tangled. From the preview, we saw it as a movie we would see. We were all blown away. We had so much fun watching this movie, not just because it was a beautiful exquisitely timed and told story, but it was just flat out fun with no drag and a significant break from the ""formula"" of Disney animation. Not that the formula was bad, but this is something new that feels both fresh and current with the extra special ""Magic"" that only Disney can do. When I talked to the kids after watching this we all agreed, that for us this film was better than Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, Alice in Wonderland, The Princess and the Frog, Alladin and even better than the pixar films (just a small amount though).

The Alan Menken Disney movies have been my Favorites of all time and that is just inching past my love for Sleeping Beauty. Back to this movie, the plot was an interesting take on an old story I had never been too thrilled over, the female character wasn't totally helpless, and I loved the comedic timing, great stuff. I'm not going to say the movie was perfect, I thought the bad guy could have used a little more umph, but I thought this was definitely a throw-back to when Disney was actually good, and when their stuff was musical and fun.

I have seen the movie twice in the theater. I cannot recall EVER going to the see a movie a second time in the theater. I actually might see it again in 3D as it was stunning! Also One of Disney's  best villains in my opinion. The psychological aspect of Mother Gothel is deep.

Seen it 2 times in the movies and going to see it at lest one more time in the movies.

The voices are very good and the video is so good. The story is I guess what makes it so very good. It's neat to see Rapunzel get out of her tower for the 1ST time. That every thing is new and she is so excited. Like going to the kingdom for the first time her facial expression with her body too are grate. Disney did a super job on this movie!

I thought I would not like this because it's got a lot of music in it. But if this one did not have the music it would not be as good. The music is so good in this movie. It goes right with it.

Even got some books and a poster of this movie. I never did that for any other one.

You can see some video clips one the web in HD too that Disney put up.

It looks like they draw this and had a computer help them. So the video looks super good.

I love this movie.

I hope this DVD will come with lots of extras. Some clips on the Internet are not in the movie.

When a fugitive thief blunders into her life, opportunity presents itself and adventure and romance follow.

Disney's 50th animated film features beautiful animation, wonderful character design, excellent voice talent, and some terrific songs, but the script lets it down.  It lacks wit, relying too much on the other aspects of production to do the heavy lifting.  As a result, the familiar tropes of a Disney Princess film, such as the young woman with animal friends waiting for her life to begin, seem mechanical and unimaginative, as do the thugs with hearts of gold.  There are also too many moments when the screenwriter seems to have written himself into a corner and must rely on coincidence and unlikely meetings to get out of it.

1170749,5,7799128836,"This is the best Disney movie of late folks. It is not the traditional Disney Prince & Princess story but it is excellent nonetheless.

All movies these days are so dark and serious - or crude. Tangled side-steps all of those pitfalls. If I were to describe it in one word I would say, ""Charming."" And that's not a word I like to use in conversatioin. The other word would be 'innocent.'

In my humble opinion, this movie is a thousand times better than Princess and the Frog. Princess and the Frog has some 'dark' elements to it, which really ruined it for me personally. While it isn't the most original movie ever, it holds its own in every aspect.

I went to a Saturday afternoon showing and I couldn't help but notice the audience particpation. For instance, when Rapunzel and Flynn went into the town and her hair was decorated with flowers and made managable thanks to little girls, the entire audience oohed and awed. I myself was blown away by that scene. Now I'm actually a 19 yr old guy - I love war movies, westerns, and good ole 'kid' movies. I really liked this movie.

The one thing I didn't appreciate was how inconsitent the evil Mother Gothel seemed. Sometimes she was like a true loving mom - if only for a brief time. It was just a little confusing and unsettling.

Also, I was suprised how well it 'got away with' all the musical scenes. Most movies today don't even try to do that anymore, and I like the fact that Tangled did decide to implement that seemingly forgotten technique.

Bottom line: It's a good, clean, light-hearted movie with great animation, character development, and vocal talent.
I would recommend this to anyone.",1292112000,2,1655,4.574324324324325
1170750,3,7799128836,"Disney animation certainly hasn't been what it used to be. After a share of mediocre to bad animated movies, they churned out an instant classic with the traditionally animated THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG. But that film didn't catch on with the public as much as it should have (of course being released around the same time as the mega-super hit AVATAR didn't help matters either). Blaming the underperformance of their film on an assumption that boys were turned off by the phrase ""princess"", Disney decided to rename their subsequent feature, RAPUNZEL, a similar fairy tale in digital 3-D CGI. This name change is something that I still can't shake my head over. I realize the motivation was to try and attract more people, but c'mon, TANGLED? Sounds more like self-parody if you ask me!

As expected, RAPUNZEL -- OK, OK, TANGLED -- is a very loose retelling of the famous Brother's Grimm tale. The title character is a young woman with the largest amount of golden hair imaginable shut away in a tower deep in the forest. Her only guardian is Mother Gothel, who stole the child away from her parents when she was very young. Rapunzel's hair has magic powers; it can heal cuts and make even a centuries-old being still appear young. It is for this latter reason that Gothel keeps Rapunzel captive, although of course our blonde heroine is told by her ""mother"" that the world is a dark and scary place and that she should stay in the tower. (If this doesn't give you echoings of Disney's HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, then what will?) Of course, Rapunzel years to explore the outside world, namely to attend the ""festival of lights"" held once a year on her birthday. One day, Flynn Rider, a runaway thief who has just stolen a jeweled crown, sneaks into the tower to hide. Knocking him out cold with a frying pan, Rapunzel forces Flynn to take her to the Festival in exchange for the stolen crown. At first Flynn tries to weasel his way out of the deal, but as he falls in love with her, his motives naturally change. But Mother Gothel wants Rapunzel back at all costs....

There are many moments when TANGLED truly shines, mainly anything involving genuine heart or magic. In the latter half of the film there is a breathtaking moment where glowing lanterns literally float up into the night sky while Rapunzel and Flynn sing the obligatory love song, ""I See The Light"". This is a truly colorful and imaginative sequence that ranks among the best at Disney. Similarly inspiring is when Rapunzel uses her enchanted hair to heal a cut on Flynn's hand. And the last half hour offers some powerful drama and heartbreaking emotion on the way to its happy ending (surprise).

Arguably the triumph of the film is Mother Gothel, who ranks as one of Disney's finest villains in a long time. She has shades of Lady Tremaine from Cinderella, but there is also a little bit of Frollo from HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. She's selfish, manipulative, greedy, and deceptive in every way imaginable. The dynamic between her and Rapunzel is both one of the strongest points of the movie and reminds one of the Witch/Rapunzel relationship from Steven Sondheim's dark fairy tale musical INTO THE WOODS. In fact, Gothel's signature song, ""Mother Knows Best"", one of many to be written for this film by Alan Menken, is strangely reminiscent of a Sondheim song. (The score is another highlight of TANGLED; Menken's songs are very pleasing to the ear, with some emerging as true stand-outs.

Unfortunately TANGLED falls short of Disney classic status for the following reasons. One of them is the overemphasis on slapstick comedy for much of the first two-thirds of the film. Most of this consists of Flynn getting whacked around by Rapunzel's frying pan, comical sight gags, and Looney Tunes style goofiness. This gets pretty tiresome quickly after every five seconds. Other sources of comedy comes from Rapunzel's chameleon sidekick, Pascal, as well as a gang of burly bandits who break into song at one point in the film. Both are absolutely useless in that they don't contribute anything valuable to the plot. The bandits, in particular, only show up in one scene that by the time they reappear again toward the finale, I forgot who they were! Pascal seems to be mostly the typical Disney cartoon sidekick intended to provide laughs and/or lure kids into the theater, because that's exactly what he functions as. He doesn't even do anything during the finale.

As far as the lead characters are concerned, Rapunzel is an appealing enough heroine, free-spirited and alternatingly schizophrenic (her various mood swings when she ventures out of the tower for the first time, for instance), while Flynn starts off as a smug, self-centered rogue who has a change of heart as he learns about Rapunzel's past. But while they both have a solid chemistry, there isn't enough of it in the film to emerge as emotionally impactful as it could have been. (Consequently, the climactic moments of the film, while otherwise very strong, don't resonate as dramatically as they would have with better realized leads.)

Had the comedy level been cranked down by several notches and the story much tighter, TANGLED would truly be worthy of being Disney's 50th animated feature. THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG was a much better production to earn that status. I did enjoy TANGLED overall, but I don't think it's one of Disney's greatest.",1292112000,28,5383,4.82034632034632
1170751,5,7799128836,"About this time last year, Disney introduced Princess Tiana in the movie ""The Princess and the Frog"".  Well, Tiana is about to be dethroned as the newest Disney princess by none other than Princess Rapunzel in the new Disney movie ""Tangled"".

Thursday, my son and I saw an advance screening of ""Tangled"" at the Birmingham Uptown Palladium.  But that was not my first time seeing the movie.  When I was in New York for the BlogHer conference, I saw an advance screening of the Disney movie ""Secretariat"".  Before ""Secretariat"" was shown, we bloggers were treated to the first 7 minutes of ""Tangled"", so I knew a few months ago that the Disney version of the story of Rapunzel was going to be out of this world exciting and like no version of the story that I had previously read.

The movie ""Tangled"" starts out telling the Disney version of the story of how Rapunzel came to be trapped in that tower that we all read about as children.  Rapunzel's mother falls ill while in childbirth and is about to die.  To save his dying wife and unborn child, the king sends his army to look for a special flower that legend says can heal any sickness. The flower has been hidden for years by an evil old woman who has been using the flower's healing powers to keep herself young. The soldiers find the flower and the queen is healed and gives birth to Princess Rapunzel. Rapunzel is born with the power of healing in her hair and the old evil woman steals the baby and raises her as her own child so that she can use Rapunzel's power to stay young.

The king and queen are devastated by the kidnapping of their child. So every year, on Rapunzel's birthday, they release thousands of lanterns in the sky in the hope that one day Rapunzel will return to them. Rapunzel (voiced by Manny Moore) has been trapped in the tower for 18 years and has never left, although she longs for freedom and to see the magic lanterns that mysteriously appear every year on her birthday.

One day a handsome thief (voiced by Zachery Levi) steals Rapunzel's crown from the castle of the king and queen and that theft sets off a chain of events that finally releases Rapunzel from her tower and from the fears of the unknown that she has carried around since she was a baby.

Like every Disney princess tale, ""Tangled"" is an exciting, complex story about goodness, evil, hate, love, fear, destiny, selfishness and total sacrifice.  Although we did not see it in 3D, this movie should be seen in 3D because of the bigger than life scenes in the film and the exciting storyline. I had to hold my son in his seat at times during the numerous chase scenes in the movie.

Speaking of exciting, the character of Princess Rapunzel is no shrinking violet in this story. She is not waiting for a prince to save her in this tale. She is both sweet as pie and a tough cookie who fights evil better that any solider.  Everyone will love the intricate things that Rapunzel does with her piles of hair from using it as a elevator to turning it into every kind of fighting weapon imaginable. Despite the traditional story setting, Princess Rapunzel is a modern, highly intelligent princess who falls in love not with a prince, but with a bad boy with a good heart.

I and my son really enjoyed ""Tangled"" and I predict when the movie debuts on November 24th, Princess Rapunzel will become the new reigning queen of the Disney Princesses. And if Disney were smart (if they have not already), they should buy the rights to Willow Smith's new tween pop song ""Whip My Hair"" and use it in the marketing of ""Tangled"".",1292025600,2,3562,4.492260061919505

1170753,5,7799128836,"I saw this movie last Tuesday, I was a little skeptical at first because before this one, I have been deeply disapointed with the Disney animated features of the 2000's I loved the disney movies of the 90's disney's animated features in the 2000's were very disapointing. Allthough I did like Brother Bear, but the thing I loved most about it, was having the characters sing again.

That's what made me fall in love with disney movies, is when the characters actually sing instead of just a background singer singing all the songs.

The love song ""I See The Light"" has become my brand new favorite disney song. I've listened to the song ""I see The Light"" on my soundtrack so many times thank God I have it on my I-pod or the cd might be scratched by now at that point. LOL. The song was beautiful, and the scene was beautiful, and just as I remember Mandy Moore sang like an angel, and as usual Alen Menken was awesome with the music! I really liked how Mother Gothel wasn't the typical wicked step-mother that has been in past Disney movies, she's the best Disney villain since Frollo, allthough Hades was pretty good but mostly funny, but Mother Gothel is the best disney villian since Frollo he was one evil dude, and instead of the hero being a prince or a soilder, he was a scoundral, which give me a little reminder of Star Wars, (Han Solo) but they showed that Repunzel can hold her own and that she's not a typical Damsel in distress and doesn't need a prince and/or a man to save her. I loved all the frying pan hitting. That was funny, and Maxumus was funny to.

It was so heartbreaking when the King and Queen were mourning the lost of there daughter especially when the king became teary eyed, that was such a touching scene. I was surprised by how well Zachery Levi could sing, he's really good and they drew Flynn/Eugene just like Zachery I notticed in a way.

When I was watching this it brought me back to the memory of Lion King, Beauty and The Beast, Aladdin, Little Mermaid, Pochontas, Hunchback of Notre Dame, and I love how Repunzel and Flynn/Eugene didn't like each other in the least at the beginning it reminded me of Anastasia with Anya and Dimitri. I'm defently going to see this movie more, and I'm defenently going to buy it when it comes out on DVD.

I had completely forgotten about it until my brother invited me to watch it with him in theaters yesterday. Reluctantly, I agreed to go. On the way to the theater, I was skeptical. In line buying tickets, I was skeptical. Sitting in the theater watching previews, I was skeptical.
And then the movie started. And no matter how hard I tried to hate it, I couldn't. 'Tangled' was amusing right from the beginning, with a witty introduction shortly followed by colorful, catchy singing, realistic characters, a hilarious horse, and a self-righteous but sweet chameleon.

1170756,4,7799128836,"""Tangled"", by all means, represents Disney's return to the true princess fairy tales since decades.  Last year's ""The Princess and The Frog"" may seem like a princess tale due to the title itself, but it was a princess tale based on technicalities and loopholes (which, btw, were pretty clever approaches to that movie's story); it's Disney's return to traditional animated films, but not a proper return to the golden era where marketable animated girls of royal background take center stage.  ""Tangled"" actually is, and this film feels very reminiscent to Disney's hand-drawn classics, even though it's computer-animated: it has a chivalric setting, vibrant scenery, a female lead who wishes for something more, a dashing hero/rebel, an evil step-mother, songs of whimsy, goofy comic-reliefs, 'dreams come true' speeches, and a valiant story filled with contrived set-ups and implausibilit---I mean, filled with magic. Not only does it capture these elements with a sense of nostalgia that will cater to the old as well as the young (fun for the whole family and all), it manage to be refreshing and bold while staying true to its roots.

Typing from someone who has seen more than his share of fairy tale movies than he's willing to admit, this has a by-the-books story; not a lot of surprises to be had from a narrative standpoint, but then again, Disney doesn't enjoy subverting its own formula.  It has its leads, they go on a journey (trials and romance abound), and the simple audience gets what they want.  But much like ""The Social Network"", which is also formulaic in its story, this film manages to be very good because of its execution.

For one thing, it's the musical numbers.  Being an animated musical, and also the first computer-animated musical made by Disney, one has to face the fallacies of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/embarrassingly-weak-songs/dp/6305236585/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">embarrassingly weak songs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/tacked-on-musical-transitions/dp/B00005UJ9X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">tacked-on musical transitions</a>; Disney movies aren't really known by them, but I can't say its characters suddenly go into song really makes sense to me.  However, Disney managed to step up its game by making the act of singing an integral part of this movie's plot.  See, the evil Gothel had to sing to a magical macguffin flower so she won't grow old, and when she kidnapped Rapuznel as a child and raise her as her own daughter due to backstory-related reasons regarding that flora of youth, Gothel made her sing so her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/magical-hair/dp/B001YHX4B0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">magical hair</a>&nbsp;can glow and revitalize Gothel's age; since Gothel and the now-legal age Rapunzel made chirping a tune routine, their singing came naturally for them.  There was also a well-crafted musical number that took place in a saloon, where all the grunts and vikings were singing about their dreams; one of the lead characters didn't want to sing, but they threatened him to sing anyway, which made the number delightfully humorous.  If there's one musical number I thought was 'tacked on', it's the ""I See the Light"" sequence...and yet it's not tacked on; it's hard to explain, but maybe because the sequence itself is so enchanting, it can get away with being tacky.  For the most part, the musical sequences were excellently handled.

Comparing to ""Princess and Frog"", character-wise, the leads in this film were more engaging and interesting than Tiana and Naveen.  But when it comes to villains, Gothel is pretty weak compared to the conniving Shadow Man.  While I appreciate that she treated her 'daughter' with some degree of humanity compared to other Disney step-mothers, her obsession to keep Rapunzel secluded in a tall tower for the sake of eternal youth made her appear less sinister and more&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joan-Crawford/dp/B00005J6RD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joan Crawford</a>.  Back to the leads, Flynn the dashing thief has to be the smuggiest smug-face smuggers I've ever smuggin' seen this side of Dreamworks; even when he had a change of heart, found a person that's more important to him than what he stole and all that usual character development, he still had that arrogant smirk.  However, I grew to like him because he can be charismatic with his one-liners and when he does his heroic deeds later on.  There's a strong chemistry between him and Rapunzel, and there's a lot of joy to be had from those two; the funniest scene of the film happened when Flynn took Rapunzel out of her tower for the first time and she goes through a schizophrenic blast of exuberance and misery while Flynn just sulks, which was ingenious in both comic delivery and juxtaposition.  Nice that the movie took the ""Aladdin"" approach in having the animal sidekicks not talk but rely on physical gestures to give them personality, and I really dig the chameleon as well as the brave steed; they don't hog much of the screen time, but that's a good thing.

I'm amazed at how the Disney princess archetype has evolved over the years.  The likes of Snow White and Cinderella don't have much in the way of multi-layered personalities outside of being kind and pretty (or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belldandy/dp/B000VAR0T8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belldandy</a>), and it's only until ""The Little Mermaid"" that princesses started to have some depth to them; although, the deepest some can go is being assertive and independent, pretty much the 'woman in a man's world' mentality that grew to succession in reality.  And then comes Rapunzel, a proper evolution to the stereotype.  She's such an amazing character, because she has that dainty innocence as the old princesses as well as the defiant attitude of new princesses; it all says she's a woman in heart and body, but can still hold her ground, which is more than I can say about many tough action girls.  Rapunzel also has some unique quirks to give her distinction, like her hyperactivity; she's practically a child, going bananas at all the new things she sees or wanted to see.  The fact that her life was explored from the beginning made me understand her, made her compelling as she journeys not only to know her past, but to maturity.  No doubt she's right up there with Jasmine as one of the best Disney princesses.

Again, ""Tangled"" is following a familiar tale, but such familiarity comes with great characters, a solid adventure that's clever and exciting, moments of levity and grim, and a resolution that, while not quite as good in the same manner as ""Wall-E"", is so moving that it's worth suspending one's predictions.  The songs themselves are very moving; each song is catchy, energetic, and easily inviting.  These compliments come as no surprise since Alan Menken composed for this movie, who also wrote music for most of the Disney Renaissance films and had a history of turning sappy love ballads into diamonds.  Speaking of, ""I See the Light"" is personally the highlight of the soundtrack, a sublimity that owes much from ""A Whole New World"". I really like this song and I can't wait to see the accolades it deserves, and I can't wait for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/America/dp/B000B58D08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">America</a>&nbsp;to try and ruin it in a few years; good thing I have a frying pan to beat myself senseless when the latter happens.",1291507200,,7688,5.474218089602705
1170757,5,7799128836,"I enjoyed growing up with the musical scores of Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman in Disney movies like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin.  The songs were fun and memorable, I still remember the lyrics, and I occasionally watch these movies on DVD with my family.  Menken wrote and produced the music and songs in ""Tangled,"" and I eagerly yet cautiosly anticipated watching the movie.  I really did not know what to expect from this movie (nor did I have high expectations), yet I found Disney's version of ""Tangled"" to be quite enjoyable, and I would rank it one of my new favorites from the newer Disney movie repertoire that includes The Princess and the Frog, Cars, and the Toy Story trilogy.  My wife, daughter, and I were pleasantly surprised with the storyline, and thoroughly enjoyed the move in 3D.  It is based on the classic story ""Rapunzel"" by the Brothers Grimm, but with a twist.

In this version Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) was kept isolated in a hidden tower by her mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) under the guise of protecting her naivet from the wickedness of the world.  Her real motive is basic yet excessive egotism.  Although Rapunzel follows her mother's wishes to stay safe and secure up in her tower, she is not the clich ""damsel in distress"" and is able to hold her own.  Having lived most of her life locked away, she is also highly curious about the outside world.  Along comes the handsome, charming and witty Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) and gives her the opportunity of a lifetime.  Fed up with her sheltered life, and with the battle cry of ""carpe diem,"" she convinces Rider to assist her with realizing her dream.

What did I like about it?  To preface, I am a bit sick of the whole ""prince looking to save his princess"" or ""princess looking for her prince charming.""  Yes, this movie involves a princess, but not in the typical/traditional way one would expect.  It does not involve a prince saving the princess or a frog turning into a prince.  The story hinges on our heroine and her curiosity of a mystical and magical event from a land nearby.  She does not want to find her prince charming or be saved by one, nor does she want to kiss a frog (though she has a chameleon sidekick, which I thought was a cute alternative).  She does not need assistance with getting down from the tower.  And the hero is not out to save the princess, has a somewhat charming egocentric quality who is out only for himself, and only accidentally stumbled into her presence.

Absotely loved the animation!  I saw both normal and 3D versions (in that order), was thoroughly impressed with the animation in 2D, and was completely blown away in 3D!  This is not your standard Mickey Mouse animation in Fantasia.  All stops were pulled for this movie.  I didn't find the colors nor the story to be dark.  The ending was a bit violent (IMHO), though relative to the movies today I suppose it is not far from the norm.  My daughter closed her eyes through a few of the scenes, but she still loved the movie.

The movie has lots of singing and dancing, and stunning animation effects (especially in 3D).  It has a nice story for the kids and a pleasant plot for the older kids.  In summary, we utterly and totally loved ""Tangled.""  Highly recommend for the young and young-at-heart.

Note:  This review is for the movie.  The discs have not yet been released, therefore I cannot comment or review the packaging, extras, etc.  I will update on these at a later date.",1291075200,7,3492,4.579032258064516

The music was great and Alan Menken's musical score was breathtaking! The voice work was awesome and the characters were well developed! I cannot wait for this to be released on Blu-Ray!

I hope it wins the Oscar for Best Animated picture! As it truly deserves it!",1290988800,21,576,4.485714285714286
1170759,5,7799128836,"Note: A friend of mine got the movie for me as a bootleg copy 1 day after it came out on DVD (though I was expecting the actual DVD).

Disney has not lost its magic touch. They've been making quality, family-friendly movies since 1937 and still going strong. View it in 3-D. It's so worth it.

The movie begins with a clip of Mickey Mouse in ""Steamboat Willie"" then the camera pans back to show Mickey in the 0 for ""Walt Disney's 50th Animated Feature."" Very good reference to the past.

The story is based on the fairy tale ""Rapunzel"" by the Brothers Grimm, and the film was originally titled ""Rapunzel"" but changed by the studio to lure boys in. Not a bad move, marketing-wise, but Disney should have kept the original title.

Biblically-speaking, there is no swearing or sex (it's A DISNEY movie, people!! What would you expect other than singing, dancing, good old-fashioned fun and clean humor?). There is some mild violence, but it's handled discreetly, and it's usually comic (though there are some frightening scenes for little ones). ***BEGIN SPOILER*** One scene towards the end is adapted straight from the fairy tale, in which Rapunzel heals the Prince through her tears and his sight is restored (after he's blinded by falling into thorn bushes while jumping from the tower in rage at not finding Rapunzel there). Obviously, Disney changed it a bit to make it more family-friendly, but still, parents should still be there to reassure their little ones, AND never does the movie pretend to be anything more than a fairy tale (ie. ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Aladdin,"" ""Beauty And The Beast,"" etc).
***END SPOILER***

Alan Menken, the Academy Award winning composer of ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Aladdin"" and ""Beauty And The Beast,"" wrote the songs for the film. My personal favourite song is ""I See The Light""; a very heartwarming and romantic ballad that conjures up the ballroom scene from ""Beauty And The Beast."" All the songs, though, are equally enchanting and fun. Pascal reminds me of a certain Caribbean crab. This film is reminiscent of the Disney films we know and love. I highly recommend it; the perfect film either for a date night, a family movie night or just for your own  entertainment. The casting and production values are simply amazing, just what you would expect from a top-notch Disney production. The soundtrack is also Tangamazing. Rated PG for mild violence.",1290988800,,2388,4.869458128078818
1170760,5,7799128836,"With Tangled, Disney finally gets with it and recognizes that third-wave feminism is here to stay,  forever. The Disney princess has gone from demure, subservient beauty to confident, robust and  self realizing beauty. No longer will Rapunzel hide in the corner when an uninvited intruder scales her tower and climbs through her window. Instead, she repeatedly knocks him unconscious with an iron skillet, locks him in a closet, ties him up with her hair in a chair, interrogation style, and then forces him to agree to a deal. In the process, she directly contradicts her faux mother's deepest fears and warnings about leaving the tower. Nope, this is not your 20th century Disney princess. Its the 21st century Disney princess. This is one tough young woman who sets her own destiny, although not without deep-felt feelings of ambiguity and guilt about disobeying mother's orders (albeit a faux mother who definitely does not have the best interests of the young Rapunzel in mind).

For the lesser sex (aka, male homo sapiens), sit up and learn a few lessons. In spite of the  string of garbage you have consumed from Pixar for the last 12 or so years, the modern world is  not a series of testosterone-laden misadventures. Nope, to compete in this world, you had better learn to value and depend on Rapunzel's golden fleece as Flynn Rider does throughout this movie, particularly during the action sequences. In fact, you are only a secondary player in life.

It is fortunate that Disney chose Tangled, its 50th animated feature, to stay relevant. This film will likely go down as its greatest triumph, much better than those male-dominated also rans, such as the Lion King or Alladin. The visuals are strikingly gorgeous, perhaps even better than Miyazaki. It uses a rich cadre of characters and formats to present the content, including slapstick, mime, melodrama, Broadway musical, action, occasional Faustian undercurrents, and so forth. It pulls all the right emotional strings, supported by a wonderful musical score. With two great feminist movies in a single year (Tangled and Alice in Wonderland), Disney stays relevant, and gets my vote.",1290988800,,2150,5.059322033898305
1170761,5,7799128836,"Disney is very unpredictable. They crank out the movies; some great and some not so great. But their animated movies are a little more trustworthy; most of them are brilliant family fun. ""Tangled"" may perhaps be the best Disney Animated production yet!!

Tangled is the story of a girl named Rapunzel (played by Mandy Moore), who was kidnapped as a baby and put in a tower, where her ""mother"" (played by Donna Murphy) takes care of her, telling to stay indoors, where it is safe. Now, 18, Rapunzel's dream is to see (up close) the mysterious floating lanterns that are released through the sky on HER Birthday each year. Her mother forbids it. And thus enters Flynn Ryder (played by Zachary Levi). Flynn Ryder is a wanted thief who stole the crown of the long-lost princess. He seeks refuge in Rapunzel's castle while her mother is away. Thus begins a long adventure; seeking the mysterious floating lanterns, escaping palace guards and evil captors, finding true love, etc.

""Tangled"" is full of intense adventure and roll-on-the-floor humor, as well as quotable lines and memorable songs.
Rapunzel and Flynn have great chemistry, clashing and blending in the perfect way.
Secondary characters like Pascel the chamelion and Maximus the horse add so much feeling and humor to the movie.

One of the things I love about ""Tangled"" is the depth. The 'bad guy' isn't some large sea monster or scary witch, she's a little bit more subtle, a blend of good and bad.
The scenes switch from suspenseful, to romantic, to funny, to intense, without a single boring moment.
This unforgettable romp is great for all ages, and a brilliant addition to the Disney Princess Movie collection.",1290902400,75,1674,4.887323943661972
1170762,5,7799128836,"I went with my seven year old daughter, mother and aunt to see this yesterday and we all loved it.  Disney/Pixar, as usual, did a fantastic job on the computer animation, 3D, characterization and appealing to all ages in this film.  The adults laughed several times and my daughter was on the edge of her seat more than once.  The ""hero"" had a slightly bad boy image but that only served to make him more lovable as he turned out to be noble in the end.  What a wonderful movie for all ages.  I will be adding this to my collection as soon as it is available on DVD, hopefully in time for Easter.",1290816000,6,596,4.192982456140351
1170763,5,7799128836,"When we saw the previews for this, we expected it to be ok and at least mildly amusing, but we weren't optimistic that it would be anything we'd really love.  We were SO wrong!  We not only liked this, we LOVED it.

One of the complaints I've read is that the viewer had hoped to see in Tangled the same kind of irreverent humor that the Shrek movies are known for.  While I do appreciate well done irreverent humor, it is certainly not the only enjoyable kind of humor. The humor in Tangled is, by turns, good natured, slapstick, subtle, situational, and always really delightful.  We (both over 30) laughed a lot during this movie!  Another complaint I've read said that the dysfunctional relationship between Rapunzel and her ""mother"" might be rather difficult, complicated, or damaging for children to see and understand. Really?  Most people don't worry about their kids seeing Iron Man, The Chronicles of Narnia, Transformers, Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast (talk about dysfunctional relationships!), or any of a thousand other movies, but this one worries them?  I'm not even sure what to say to that...Except to tell potential viewers that it shouldn't overly concern them because many children will most likely recognize the dynamic from their own experience with a person like Mother Gothel - indeed we all know someone like this - and they may very well draw inspiration from Rapunzel's courage in finally standing up to her.

Another complaint mentioned the colors in the moving being dark - this couldn't be further from our experience.  Either the particular theater that person was in or the 3D viewing must've caused that person's experience because in our 2D viewing the colors were absolutely luminous!  I was absolutely enchanted by the colors and the vivaciousness and beauty of the animation.

The final criticism I'll address is the ""lack of memorable songs.""  For me this was a good thing!  Personally I get tired of the characters bursting into song every few frames!  When did animated movies suddenly have to become animated musicals?!  I'm glad Disney followed Dreamwork's lead in this case and seriously toned down the number and scope of the songs.  Overall, in fact, this movie felt much more like a Dreamwork's production than a Disney movie and based on the awesomeness of several of DW's recent efforts (How to Train Your Dragon for example) we think this is a good thing!

Bottom line we absolutely loved this movie. It's beautiful to look at, very funny, a good story, charming, uplifting, and thoroughly enjoyable.  As soon as it's available we will be pre-ordering it.

Oh, one other note, the voice work was absolutely excellent!  I didn't realize, until after the fact, that the voice of Flynn is done by Zachary Levi of Chuck.  Love Zach, love Chuck, love Zach as Flynn - hope he does more voice work.",1290816000,3,2848,4.877338877338877
1170764,4,7799128836,"All the big pieces fit the Disney formula: princess in distress, lovable rogue, wicked stepmother/senior advisor, a few musical numbers, and a Jiminy Cricket character - Pascal the chameleon, my favorite to date in his line of descent. Like any good recipe, though, it's what they do with familiar ingredients that makes this dish especially tasty.

Rapunzel, although she has plenty of the pining princess about her, wields a mean fry-pan, though. Maximus, a mighty battle steed, gets some great parts to play, too - some of his ""scent tracking"" moves are a riot. In fact, anything the animators could do to make this a visual treat they did beautifully, including all the characters' motions as well as the ever-present hair. And the den of thieves - well, they're nice thieves. As happened with the little mermaid and so many other old stories, the Rapunzel of the classic fairy tales might not survive Disneyfication. Well, it's a fair story anyway, with plenty of adventure but with nothing truly dark enough to upset the little kids that thronged  the showing I saw. As always with Disney flicks of this kind: good, but forgettable.
