8285792,3,B001C3ZYGO,"If you are desparate for some Ginger Rogers films, you will want  to get this set.  It has some classics on it that are available no where else.  And all 6 films are quite enjoyable.

Bachelor Mother is a gem- a classic screwball comedy.  The Major and the Minor and It Had to Be You are both a bit strange and riske but in a good way!  Tight Spot is a solid potboiler.  And of course Gay Divorcee and Top Hat are classic Astaire & Rogers musicals.

However, this set is really overpriced for what you get.  There are virtually no extras (except on Top Hat, where there's a really nice little introduction by Fred Astaire's daughter), and most importantly, Bachelor Mother is COLORIZED!  Which is utterly shameful.  It's not advertised as such- in fact, the box set itself claims the film is in its original black and white, but don't let that fool you.  What a huge disappointment to those of us who despise colorization.  Luckily, its the only one in the bunch that is colorized- the rest are in their original glorious black and white.

Also, I was puzzled by the fact that some of the dvds had menus so plain they looked like someone's DVD-Rs recorded off tv... not a professional looking job at all.

But the good news is, the print quality on all 6 films is decent, the sound appears to be OK, and this set contains films you just can't find anywhere else!!

So if you love Ginger, just prepare to turn your tv screen to black and white and enjoy!",1230595200,6,1453,4.385767790262173
