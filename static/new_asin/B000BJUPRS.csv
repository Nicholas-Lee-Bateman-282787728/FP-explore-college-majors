8087530,4,B000BJUPRS,"ISLAND OF TERROR (aka: NIGHT OF THE SILICATES) opens w/ the death of a man, under mysterious circumstances. He is discovered to have been relieved of his skeleton! This causes renowned pathologist, Dr. Brian Stanley (Peter Cushing), to get involved. He's arrived just in time, as several more citizens have been reduced to bags of jelly! Can he help to solve this nightmarish puzzle, or will everyone become boneless?! ISLAND OF TERROR is a monster movie w/ some rather original monsters. It is somewhat reminiscent of movies like FIEND WITHOUT A FACE, or X: THE UNKNOWN, due to an atmosphere of creeping doom. Cushing is wonderful, as always. Recommended for his fans in particular, and sci-fi / horror fans in general...",1474761600,,722,4.975206611570248
8087531,3,B000BJUPRS,"Started really well that when the ""big plot"" is revealed about mid-section, it just turns into another search and destroy mission that is so uninvolved and tedious.",1431302400,,164,5.111111111111111
8087532,5,B000BJUPRS,"This film is a peter cushing classic. I used to see it as a child occasionally on sat morning tv. It always scared me to death,espically the sound the silicates made as they sucked the bones from a body. As I watch it as an adult it is still a very entertaining film in the classic hammer manner. Cushing rarely fails to deliver. This film deserves a usa release as the creeping flesh was.",1252713600,3,389,4.27027027027027
8087533,3,B000BJUPRS,"ISLAND OF TERROR employed that old bugaboo, radiation, to create a race of monsters which may destroy the earth. In this case the beasts, (or ""Silicates""), were created by Scientists as independent cellular organisms which were supposed to feed off of human cancer cells, (and cure that dreaded disease). Yep, another case of the road to hell being paved with good intentions! When the experiment goes awry, and the Silicates grow to the size of large, tentacled sea turtles which replicate at an exponential rate, we have a recipe for disaster, (as they like to eat people). This is an entertaining 1960s British Horror-Sci-Fi entry that while dated today, was memorable in 1966 when it was released. There is even some ""gore"", (wanna see gigantic linguine-like Silicate DNA?). I also seem to recall a graphic shot that involved the lopping off of actor Peter CUSHING's hand, (though it was absent in the version I own). Speaking of graphic images, don't forget those decent looking victims who were shriveled up like prunes. They had their bones ""sucked"" out by the creatures, which did so whilst making a sound like a drinking straw working the bottom of a near empty cup! So that's what bone sounds like when it is being slurped out of a body! I still remember those faces of the dead with their creepy, cruel looking caricatures! They were similar to the ocean bobbing dead guy in the MONSTER THAT CHALLENGED THE WORLD. That scene was well executed and I shall never forget that victim! Yes I know that one has a problem when you find yourself thinking that one corpse is more attractive than another! But it is acceptable here as this is a Horror film, and darn, those corpses sure were ""lookers"". A lot of people seemed to have missed this film which is a shame as it is definitely worth checking out especially if you are a fan of 50s-60s style cinema monsters. Sure there are plot holes, but ISLAND OF TERROR is to the 1960s what FIEND WITHOUT A FACE, was to the 1950s, in terms of British Horror-Sci-Fi cinema. Little wonder, in that they share the same producer. With the addition of Director Terence FISHER & actor Peter CUSHING, the film also has a (superior) Hammer Productions feel about it. Cripes, I even detected what appeared to be some stop frame animation with some of the creature shots. That added touch gave the Silicates a creepier edge, (as was also the case with the animated brains in FIEND...). I hope that this minor little gem receives a new release, (with an improved image transfer), though beware of scissored scenes and what appears to be 3 different run times given for various editions of this film. When Amazon again offers this DVD title, pick it up! Recommended!",1237334400,3,2702,4.726694915254237
8087534,4,B000BJUPRS,"hadnt seen this movie in years..came upon it by accident..and couldn't wait to see it..unfortunately the transfer to DVD was less than i expected from this pricey purchase. if i had to do it again i probably would have waited for something with better quality..but overall it was still what i wanted to see and remembered it to be..great performances by all concerned...but some areas were extremely muddy and audio was yuk.

still giving it a 4 for nostalga's sake",1176163200,6,465,4.8125
