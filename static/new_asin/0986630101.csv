8324461,1,0986630101,First off all this could of been put on two discs. Half of the demonstrations the camera is behind the tattoo artist hand their for you cant see. In my opinion Gary Grays lines were very poor on the other hand Paul Millers demonstrations were good the only problem is that he only appears in two segments. Production is also poor. I'm up set I paid $100 in my opinion $40 maybe. I should of taken the advice from another web site.,1319500800,,430,4.2560975609756095
