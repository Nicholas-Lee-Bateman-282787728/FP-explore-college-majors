996539,4,6305248176,"This wartime production for propaganda and informative purposes introduced the american public into the horrors and magnitude of the gigantic struggle codenamed ""Operation Barbarrosa"" by Adolf Hitler himself. When  one sees the film over fifty years after its' production, the tone and  justified sympathy for the soviet peoples seems so novel by those of us who  grew up under the cold war vitriol. That alone and the description of the  suffering and valour of the soviet peoples is impressive in itself and  gives us an historic dimension along with the dramatism. The military,  economic and politcal foreground and explanations delivered during the film  have probably never been reproduced and made accesible for the american  public in later wars and complicated political moments. If there ever was a  time in which the nation, and indeed, the free world strove toward acommon  goal it was certainly in WWII. There is an absolute absence of political  bias towards the soviets. I can only imagine the reaction of the american  public when viewing the imposing panzer and wehrmacht columns at the  beginning of the conflict and the destruction they inflicted; the tenacity  of the soviets to overcome such a powerful foe; the footage and description  of the battle that was to turn it all round: Stalingrad. And from there on  the certainty of victory. Battle of the Volga is probably not the best for  war documentary buffs;but it delivers the whole scope of the drama and that  should suffice for the larger public, even if it is over fifty years old.",960940800,9,1560,5.003891050583658
7886027,4,6305248176,Exceptionally well-done treatment of an obscure battle (Crete) and a near-Armageddon of armored warfare (Kursk),1407196800,,111,6.466666666666667
7886028,5,6305248176,"This documentary is very well designed however, it will leave the viewer with the desire to learn more about these battles, especially the Battle of Kursk which turned the tide against the Nazis.",1393027200,,195,4.9393939393939394
7886029,2,6305248176,"This DVD set has old archival footage in black and white. That's not the problem. The problem is that the footage is a bit blurry/fuzzy looking, which makes it difficult to watch. For example, unless a person is up close in a particular shot, it can be difficult to see their face; objects and background are similar. The narration style is also a bit dated, and it sounds like propaganda talk. I've seen enough excellent documentaries on WWII that I decided not to finish watching the first DVD.

If you are interested in this DVD set, then I recommend that you rent it before buying it.

7886030,4,6305248176,"Excellent presentation of three pivotal WW2 battles.

I`d not heard that interpretation of the Battle of Midway before. Our side was very lucky.

The narrator should have taken Deutsch 101. Fallschirmjaeger is not that difficult to pronounce:  FALL SCHIRM JAEGER (Luftwaffe Paratroopers). It sounded like the narrator was saying ""fudge chum makers"" or ""fulshum makers.""

And ""general major""? You don`t need to know German to know that a division commander is a major general, not a ""general major"" (auf Deutsch: Generalmajor). He never did figure out if 1st SS was ""LIPE"" or ""LEEP"" standarte (Leibstandarte).

Also see The Green Devils: German Paratrooper Elite: 1933-1941, and The Green Devils: German Paratrooper Elite: 1942-1945.

This film was a bit better than the Green Devil presentations, except for the narrator. The first Green Devil one never really explained why a few planeloads of paratroopers overcame 40,000 Allied defenders on Crete, but this program gets you closer to seeing how that happened.",1368921600,,1012,5.3734177215189876
7886031,1,6305248176,"The videos are nice but the footage does not fit the battles and there are some annoying errors in the facts.  The Kursk segment is the worst.  Several shots of Tiger II (PzKw VI B) tanks that were not used at Kursk, several shots of German troops in winter gear (Kursk was high summer on the Russian plains) leaves one miffed.
They keep referring to the Das Reich Adolf Hitler SS division.  There was a 1st SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler division and there was a 2nd SS Das Reich division but they continually erroneously state this.  Somewhat silly mistake.  This is all extremely well known to historians and even casual students.  The names of the SS divisions are well known.  Couldn't get it right?  Very surprising.  I wonder what else they got wrong.
I would choose something well researched over this fluff.",1245974400,8,815,4.683098591549296
7886032,3,6305248176,"The info is very good, the dvd itself is ok as well, but as they talk about some things as there happening you can see the pictures are wrong for exsample you see the wrong tanks or the wrong airplanes?",1225065600,3,202,4.075
7886033,1,6305248176,"Besides the film being poorly mastered (the image shakes so much
that gives us the impression that the DVD was mastered inside a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean ), it was made during wartime by the US Government. The DVD then tells the story from the ""official point of view"" and, of course, ignores all the new evidences that were discovered/unclassified since then.
If you want a comprehensive look on what actually happened on Russia and WWII as a whole, you must then order titles such as ""The World at War"" narrated by SIR Lawrence Olivier. If you expect this documentary to be as good as National Geographic's comprehensive approach on the Battle of Midway (6 stars-""The battle FOR Midway"" ), forget it.",1015459200,4,713,4.712
7886034,3,6305248176,The documentary was good but it was very one sided. It was made prior to the U.S. knowing exactly what kind of leader Stahlin was.  As a result it is more like a propaganda film then a depiction of the reality of the war in Russia which was a blood bath between two dictators.  On a positive note it had some excellent battle footage.,1004313600,2,334,4.203125
7886035,4,6305248176,"This is one of the first WWII documentaries that really show the mistake that Hitler made by invading Stalins Russia.  I'm not good with words but no one else had written a review for it. Sorry. But if you like War documentaries watch this, it's great.",980208000,11,252,4.478260869565218
7886036,2,6305248176,"This is a remarkably bad presentation of the ""great battles"" of World War II. To begin with, in an alleged introduction to the causes of WW II - probably written at a time in 1946 when the Soviets had to be pleased - the authors do not EVEN MENTION THE SOVIET-GERMAN PACT OF 1939 !!!! The rest is a superficial, long winded, boring collection of news footage and other pictures, with poor sound and rudimentary texts. To be avoided.",978912000,6,432,4.481012658227848
