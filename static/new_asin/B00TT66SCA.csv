8703034,4,B00TT66SCA,Not as great as the first season but still hilarious. Too bad they didn't continue with another season. That was disappointing!,1519084800,,127,5.095238095238095

8703036,1,B00TT66SCA,"All the complaints I had about season 1 of Legit are magnified in the second season.  From hearing Jefferies on the Jay Mohr podcast, his stories about working with George Lazenby were far better than Lazenby's actual work.  I couldn't even finish watching the entire season before I had to give up and just get rid of the set.",1513814400,,327,4.52542372881356
8703037,5,B00TT66SCA,"Legit was one of those shows that had real limitless potential

It was the Louie of the West Coast and must have been good enough it was brought back for a second season to FX's baby brother station FXX

A station at the time of Legit's return for season two I'm sure alot of people didn't even have
FXX comes in a upgraded package (with my cable it does) so i missed the first 4 episodes cause i  didn't have FXX and the time

Season Two is insane it's cranked up all the way (it's surpasses Always Sunny in being LOL Funny and edgy)
you get to meet Jim mother & father played by  George Lazenby and Magda Szubanski  (getting these two awesome casting to say the least!)
which leads Jim to go to Afghanistan with Steve to get away from his parents
when he comes back
Jim,Steve,Billy , Walter (John Ratzenberger)  and Jim's Dad (George Lazenby),  go to this sleazy Asian massage  pallor  with coupons mind you
and it's both funny and a little disturbing (Needless to say before there is any happy ending everyone starts singing Except Jim mostly cause he's angry that he's there with his Pop's!
 Then two of the Asian Hookers i mean massage therapist go with all the guys to a water park!
Carrie Fisher makes a very interesting cameo in a episode as the head of a tv network

The final four episode were written like a film they all run into each other!

""Weekend"" is Dan Bakkedahl episode to shine he falls off the wagon when he finds out his ex wife Georgina  is pregnant by Tod the next door neighbor she left him for so he falls and he falls hard from bar hoping to smoking crack in a bathtub with a group of crack heads to going to a cock fight to waking up in his underwear at the beach (w/ out his gun!)  **This episode really pushes what edgy comedy is**  and can be
(Dan is a great actor he got a safe network sitcome coming sooon to CBS) I'm shocked they hired him from episode alone it's out there and brave for a actor to go all in...............

""Intervention"" is the fallout from Steve's weekend and it's equally  funny as the previous episode
the Intervention goes sideways when Jim brings coc@ine and hookers to the house and the intervention slowly becomes a closeted party with Steve once again falling off the wagon but, trying to pretend he is sober
even  Tod gets caught parting things go bad very fast

""Sober""
Jim promises Steve he is gonna be sober too (to keep Steve from drinking) this leads to Jim having panic attacks while on stage since he never does he act sober.....  The incident gets back to Jim's agent Jim's agent quits
Jim, Steve, Billy and Rodney go to Katie's house for her Husband's 40th B-Day Party and it's a Rock and Roll Costume party
it's very awkward since Steve and Jim can't drink and only eat b-day cake
(The 4 are dressed as the Beetles btw)
 Jim tells Steve about the panic attacks and starts bashing himself for being at this guys house  Since Jim slept with Katie at there high school reunion and  needs to go but, Steve tells Jim just to hook-up with some chick there he's looking at different girls  (notice a chick that looks like Courtney Love
Then a dude comes next to Jim hounds him  the chick that looks like Courtney Love grabs Jim and ask him if he wants to go up stairs and party
he's In Like Flint
the scene in the bedroom is downright brilliant
here's the dialogue

Jim what are you doing?
Courtney ""Parting!
Jim  ""That's Not Parting!""
Courtney  ""What do you call parting?""
Jim  ""Coc@ine & Sex"" What do you call parting?
Courtney ""I was never gonna have sex with you!""
Jim  ""Why Not?
Courtney 'Cause I hardly know you!""
Jim  ""But, your a heroin addict
Courtney ""Who says I'm a addict?
Jim  ""Who does heroin casually??""
then Jim gets tossed out
goes to leaves tells Katie goodbye and they kiss which leads to her husband Trevor catching them making out!
Episode ends with Jim at a club doing his Gun control jokes
a few guys confront him outside and he gets shot and the screen fades to black!

""Honesty""  It all comes down to this final episode they wrote these last 4 in a way it bookends the entire series!
Once again a true shame this show had ""It""
this picks up after Jim was shot it's pretty much a slow burn
Jim is thinking about  giving up standup even though now after the shooting he's becoming a household name!
while he's wrestling with his inner turmoil he starts taking pain pills  (starts eating in his sleep and txt in his sleep)
which leads to the set-up of the end
where Katie comes to Jim and tells him she wants to be with him (he has been texting her while he's high on pain pills)
her dialogue is really interesting and telling of this show as a whole
Katie tells Jim
""You said you wanted to have a real life to be legit have something meaningful lasting and real........
What kind of life do you really want????
Katie walks out the door
you have 3 month later..... at the bottom of the screen
Steve enlisted in the army!
Billy moved back into the care facility  he moved out of in Season One  episode two  (Once again things being book ended)
then you see Katie in her kitchen with her two kids being yelled at by her husband about picking up his clean laundry
her tv is on and they bring up Jim Jefferies she looks mad turns off the tv
then it pans into a packed venue (with Jim and his new young g/f and his suck-up agent (who quite two episodes earlier)
Jim made it he's massive and Legit but, at what price did he really pay???
you see him walk onto the stage with this odd look on his face and the picture goes black!
It's this very strange jarring type ending where it feels like you got punched in the face!

Overall this season is really good the ending is bitter sweet though!
I'd go as far as saying this season is better then any full Season of Louie  (and i really love Louie)
  9.3/10
