4049452,5,B0031QKTG0,Husband loved it!  He's a BIG Alabama fan and did not get the game recorded.,1278720000,,76,4.066666666666666
4049453,5,B0031QKTG0,"This DVD is excellent.  The color, sound -- everything was a perfect replay of a great game.  It was wonderful without the commercials.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching Alabama soundly beat Florida in all aspects of the game and watching Tebow crumble.",1276041600,,250,5.048780487804878
4049454,4,B0031QKTG0,"Can't argue with the content here- it is the full CBS game broadcast. Other than Verne Lundquist, it's about perfect. The biggest problem here is that it is not the HD version. It really looks bad cropped to a square and all fuzzy on a big TV. Even still, I could watch this baby every day and never get tired of it. Roll Tide Roll!",1274313600,,332,4.123076923076923
4049455,4,B0031QKTG0,"I gave this DVD four stars instead of five only because it's not HD. The aspect ratio is the 4:3 ""fullscreen"" that fills the screen of older TVs rather than the 16:9 ratio used by HDTV. That said, the picture quality is very good. I did NOT have any of the problems mentioned in the review dated April 8: lags in play or pixelation.

This is the full coverage by CBS, omitting only the commercials.

If you're an Alabama fan you'll want to watch this game over and over.",1272672000,,470,4.269662921348314
8387173,4,B0031QKTG0,"This is the CBS coverage of the game. I knocked one star off because the video transfer was done for speed rather than top notch quality, but if you're a Bama fan and want to replay this game, you won't be disappointed.

*Spoiler* Bama still wins big. ;-)

This was a great game and a satisfying culmination of the season for fans who hurt over the previous year's loss to Florida.

Note that I did not see the same problems the April 8th reviewer noted. I'm thinking that he either received a bad DVD or has player problems.",1508976000,5,525,4.336734693877551
8387174,4,B0031QKTG0,bought this dvd about 3 years ago for my son who was 3 at the time. He loved it and watched it so many times that he memorized every play and every word.,1408924800,,153,3.6666666666666665
8387175,5,B0031QKTG0,"This game put Alabama over the hump in the Saban era. Plus, tons of future NFL players played in this game on both teams. Great memories.",1388793600,,137,4.3076923076923075
8387176,5,B0031QKTG0,good.  RTR  never too much to spend to re-live the Bama Nation experience.  This was National Championship # 13.  I have also bought # 14 and # 15.  Worth the watch ... over and over again. ROLL TIDE,1383091200,,199,4.131578947368421
8387177,5,B0031QKTG0,"I'm a huge BAMA fan and also a TIM TEBOW fan, so this is the perfect DVD for me. I was glad that we won this game- didn't think we had a chance at the time, but I was also sad for Tim because this was his senior year and the SEC championship ended his hopes for a BCS title that year. Love my BAMA BABIES and was so proud of them!",1367107200,,330,3.5972222222222223
8387178,5,B0031QKTG0,"Thanks.  The video looked great.  The packaging was great.  I loved the ending.  Look out Texas, here we come.

8387179,4,B0031QKTG0,"We really enjoyed watching the game although we did expect the image quality to be a bit better - it's a bit fuzzy on a large screen. No commercials but you still get stuck with the commentators. Naturally, it's all worth it to watch Bama crush the Gators again...and again....and again.....",1360713600,,291,4.7254901960784315
8387180,5,B0031QKTG0,"That is what two people, Tracy and Joe, described this DVD as! I can tell you and these people, the one on August 29th review and April 8th review, YOU ARE NOT TRUE CRIMSON TIDE FANS!!!! It was just like or even a little better than watching these replays on regular TV when they have, THe Greaest SEC replays. These usually come on during August of every year on my local ABC affiliate. This DVD is a lot clearer than those replays. I've been a Bama fan since I was 10 years old and that was over 50 years ago! I bought the perfect season also, but Tracy and Joe would think it was garbage too, because it isn't in HD, they are wonderful as well!",1359072000,,647,4.142857142857143
8387181,5,B0031QKTG0,"As a Crimson Tide fan I wanted a lasting copy of the 2009 SEC Championship game.  I read the reviews and even though I was happy that there was a DVD of the game available, the reviews made me nervous.  So I took the chance and bought it.  This is what I discovered...

1) According to a few of the Reviews the DVD was poor quality and was not worth buying.

* I found that to be untrue with MY copy of the DVD.  It wasn't HD quality but for me that doesn't matter.  It is just like watching it in 'real time' without the commercials.... (The commentators are still just as annoying....) :)

2) As I said it doesn't appear to be in HD....  but it is the SEC Championship game.... Do you really care if it is in HD?

So for a die hard Alabama Fan.... (like myself)... who wants to replay
the glorious victory over the once #1 ranked Gators.... this is a great way to see the game again and again....

Roll Tide!",1289347200,2,910,4.084745762711864
8387182,1,B0031QKTG0,One of the best games ever played deserves to be reproduced to HD quality not this garbage that i cannot even watch.,1283040000,4,116,4.318181818181818
