It has brutal Nazis, but also the brutality of the occupied Russians trying to survive. The contrast is the Russians who took great risk overcame their fear to help others. Treachery, betrayal, valor, loyalty and a story of star crossed love weaves through the right episodes with some exceptional action sequences. Again, I stress that it is old fashioned story telling so one will either love it or not. I found it very interesting and entertaining.",1508025600,,542,4.838709677419355
8662512,1,B00KXH24B8,"This is one of those tings that should be required viewing for students of the art of montage, or as you northerners call editing. The only reason I did not shot my television was the price tag attached to the ceremony. It could have been such a great movie with the proper hand behind its editing. The female protagonist is agonizingly shallow, and when you want to cheer the Nazis for getting close to killing her, something most be wrong with the movie. In the plus side, it is beautifully filmed, but it was long, too bloody long, and if I have to seat to watch it again I may star singing.... Deutschland, Deutschland ber alles. Traumatic.",1502841600,,644,4.512820512820513
