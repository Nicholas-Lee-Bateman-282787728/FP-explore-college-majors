5859795,5,B00DVH21D8,"I already had this in VCR form and am thrilled to get in on a DVD. This is an excellent series, not only on the importance and function of dreams but also on the information in the section dealing with post traumatic stress on returning Viet Nam vets. Not nearly enough of Carl Jung's  voluminous writings and interviews have been released to the public. The man was a major pivot in the evolution of human psychological and emotional evolution. More, please.",1406851200,10,459,4.666666666666667

5859797,5,B00DVH21D8,"I've been reading and studying Jung for about 25 years and it just keeps getting better and better, especially the older you get! I had this on VHS but just recently decided to see if it was on DVD and hurrah! I usually buy most of my DVD's from the C.G.Jung Institute--they have a DVD collection of 30 discs of interviews with analysts who went to Jung in the 1920's and 30's and then became analysts themselves--mostly here in the States. Excellent series",1400803200,3,457,4.518072289156627
5859798,5,B00DVH21D8,As I continue to be greatly interested in Dr. Carl C. Jung and read many Jungian Analysts greatly illuminating a complex profound researcher and his many publications including the Red Book.  This DVD was originally a VHS tape set available earlier and then out of print and thus making it priceless. I have listened to this DVD recently released many times and each time I hear and see new things giving me increased consciousness.  Highly recommended for anyone interested in Dr. Jung and learning more about him and the Analysts he greatly impacted who then carried forth this learning and so on and so on.  May Dr. Jung's messages continue to ripple out to our pained world.,1389744000,11,678,4.777777777777778
5859799,5,B00DVH21D8,"Long unavailable except on out-of-print VHS tapes, this fine 3-part documentary on Carl Jung & the mysteries of dreams is finally released on DVD. For anyone unfamiliar with Jung & wanting to know more, it's a perfect introduction, as the first part offers a brief overview of Jung's life, basic concepts, and work with dreams. The two subsequent parts go directly & more deeply into the ways in which dreams connect us with the unknowable & unfathomable Unconscious. In truth, it uses dreams as the key to entering the palace of Jung's psychology, which encompasses many rooms indeed.

Unlike his former mentor Freud, Jung believed that dreams were more than mere residue of the day's events, cast in cryptic form to deal with emotional sore spots the conscious mind didn't want to face. He saw them in more positive terms, as speaking a symbolic language that drew on both personal & universal experience -- the latter being what he called the Collective Unconscious, a storehouse or matrix of archetypal images & forces that all human beings have experienced. Further, he believed that dreams were a different way of knowing, of casting into tangible form our deepest concern, desires, and fears. By exploring our dreams & striving to understand what they were saying, we could gain insight into the unconscious forces that drive us unknowingly but powerfully, often against our conscious wishes. And with that insight, we could begin to change our lives, to learn from our dreams & grow as human beings.

At this point it's good to remind ourselves that Jung was a doctor, a healer, before anything else. For all his depth of curiosity & intellect into the myriad aspects of the psyche, mythology, culture, and spiritual yearning, his primary purpose in life was to help other wounded human beings. In the end, he felt that his approach to the psyche was valid because it worked in real life. His experience as a doctor helping patients confirmed his explorations & speculations, and grounded them in everyday experience. This is especially important to remember when dealing with something as intangible, fleeting, yet intense as dreams.

This series was made at just the right time. Most of Jung's foremost colleagues & students were still alive, and thus able to speak about the man & his work from their own experience. But there's more here than just talking heads, however witty & intelligent -- the series uses vivid imagery to convey the emotional impact of dreams & dream work. For anyone fascinated by Jung's work in general, and by dreams in particular, this is required viewing -- a first step, to be sure, with many more to go for those eager to continue. Most highly recommended!",1381708800,28,2697,4.923076923076923

8598287,5,B00DVH21D8,"Excellent series.  I wish the episodes were longer.  One thing I can complain about is the lack of the option for closed captioning.  I don't know about other people, but when foreign people are talking, on whatever medium, I often have trouble understanding them.  (I even turn on the closed captioning for programs with English people in them.). On a subject like Jungian psychology, which I'm very much interested in, I find it essential to understand exactly what the people are saying.",1462752000,3,490,4.939024390243903
8598288,5,B00DVH21D8,"Interesting series.  It seems to have more substance in explaining what Jung was about, and that gives more meaning to his research.  I have personally recommended this to others that are asking about these issues.",1448928000,,214,5.085714285714285

8598291,5,B00DVH21D8,"This was a great find! It was fun and interesting to watch - I learned more than a few things about philosophies that I didn't know Carl Jung was involved in. Or to put simply, he coined the phrases. I was interested to learn that like most enlightened minds, he took time in his life to devote to himself and explore his conscious awakening. To find out he was the one that brought the idea of the collective consciousness to mainstream scientific thinking and developed the word association ""test"" was interesting. And although he had a personal and professional connection with Freud, I found that his work is closely linked  to Joseph Campbell's work. And having just watched the Bill Moyers and Joseph Campbell Power of Myth - finding The Wisdom of Dreams with Carl Jung proved to be a fantastic synchronicity!  This is something I'll watch many times as I explore my own awakening. Also it's worth mentioning that after watching this and then falling asleep for the night - I had a most amazing lucid dream!",1424736000,6,1013,4.685393258426966
