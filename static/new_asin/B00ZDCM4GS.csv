8719841,5,B00ZDCM4GS,"We love this resource for teaching young kids Spanish! It's very professionally done, entertaining, and best of all it's actually educational. Most ""educational"" shows have a whole bunch of mindless entertainment with a few little bits of learning thrown in. This, on the other hand, has so much learning that's actually been made fun.

40 different words are introduced and reinforced through different fonts and animations to help teach sight reading to little ones. There's lots of fun clips of animals and children, songs, and sound effects. It's definitely something you can feel good about letting your kids watch while giving mom or dad a break.
