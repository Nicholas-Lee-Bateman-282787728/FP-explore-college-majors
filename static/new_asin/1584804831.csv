8621331,5,1584804831,"The plot of this movie is incredibly difficult to follow.  The best I can tell, it seems to be about a group of heroes who go around trying to save lives, BUT we're introduced to characters only to find that they're not even in the rest of the movie.  We never get a chance to understand the characters' motivations before they're swept off-screen.  I guess the biggest problem is that the storyline is paper-thin and hard to follow, it's basically a convoluted mess of mismatched storytelling. The director really should've watched The Avengers or something like that to see how a super hero movie is supposed to be made.  The special effects are low quality and/or non-existent.  Usually the easiest way to improve a movie is to add explosions (e.g. The Avengers), but director simply ignores this simply fact and doesn't add any at all.  Still, I'd rather watch this than the Transformer films.",1404950400,3,897,4.792207792207792
