If you didn't know that you can stick your fingers in somebody's eyes or hit him on the throat then you are a complete newcomer and maybe you'll benefit from this video but if you've got any background in any martial art, this info is way too elementary. For each strike point, Franco (off-camera) tells you where to strike and then demonstrators demonstrate over and over and over again. How many times do you need to see a guy stick his fingers in a punching dummy's eyes to get the picture that you can stick your fingers in some guy's eye? Way too little info, way too much repetition and the end of this brief video is nothing but ads for other Franco videos. Buy something else. I'm trading mine in.",1335830400,10,777,4.402777777777778

After owning many DVD's that CFA has to offer, and believing that it could not get any better, it has. Sammy's material is as solid as a rock, and this Pressure Points DVD is the condensed blood, squeezed from that stone.

Covering the vital head targets in detail, with training options for 'with a B.O.B' or without', you can't hold off getting this.

Each target area has multiple techiques presented, in real time and reduced slow motion. Quality information, that any serious RBSD practitioner must pactice.",1262822400,8,576,4.979166666666667
