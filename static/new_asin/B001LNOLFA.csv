Overall this is my favorite movie of the late, GREAT Amando De Ossorio.",1427500800,3,382,4.2465753424657535
8319089,5,B001LNOLFA,"After a child goes missing, a local witch is questioned by police. When threatened w/ sodium pentothal, she dives out the window to her death. The witch's daughter seeks vengeance, and gives a little girl a small devil statue. The girl is soon possessed, and begins behaving in an atrocious manner. She levitates off her bed, arms outstretched. Sound familiar? A devil cult is busy in the nearby woods. They call the girl to them in the middle of the night. Many eeevil chants and incantations are regurgitated, and the little girl shifts into demonic overdrive! She takes on the persona of the dead witch, offering up an infant sacrifice! She also develops quite a potty mouth. Her parents are not amused. DEMON WITCH CHILD (THE POSSESSED) is a wacky, tacky tale of good vs. eeevil. It's a thoroughly ludicrous affair, trying so very hard to be ""shocking"". Though it's obviously an EXORCIST clone, it's schlock-factor is so high, that it simply cannot be taken as anything but comedy. The laughs come fast and hard, making for a VERY entertaining experience. A classic in the annals of rubbish cinema...",1402185600,2,1104,4.8465608465608465
8319090,4,B001LNOLFA,"As a major fan of The Tombs of the Living Dead series by de Ossorio, I went out and watched his other horror offerings. This one, aka ""The Possessed"", is a 1975 film and is set in that time, though its story seems to belong in the 18th or 19th centuries, at the latest. The film was an absolute hoot to watch. You have to appreciate the incredibly low budgets de Ossorio was constrained by, as well as the strict censors that existed in Franco's Spain. He died after this film was released (Franco) and the censors began to gradually relax until they faded away entirely. I should say here that the film is dubbed in English.

The story line is simple and what you read in the synopsis is accurate, though keep in mind we are talking the 1970s and not the middle ages. The old crone that dies at the beginning is a hardcore Satanist. She possesses a girl about 11 or 12??? Anyway, her face changes at times in the movie, as does her hairline, where she resembles the old crone. That was just classic. She can assume different voices, including the old crone. And she likes to offend and shock people with sexually inappropriate remarks, curses, and its also a hoot to hear and watch her when she looks like her normal 11ish year old self.

I think this film is suitable for Eurohorror and especially deOssorio completists. I don't think you'd appreciate it if you don't fall into either category.

P.S.- if you, like the review above, missed that scene: the reason the old crone jumped out the window is because she was about to be given an injection of sodium pentothal in order to force her to spill the beans as to where the baby she kidnapped (and intended to sacrifice) was being stashed. She preferred to die than spill the beans.",1392595200,5,1736,4.452830188679245
8319091,2,B001LNOLFA,"This film is purely ludicrous and should only interest horror fans because of its obscurity.

A balding gypsy woman is arrested for kidnapping a child and, for reasons beyond my comprehension, she jumps out the window to her death.  Evidently to avenge her mother, the gypsy's witch daughter curses the daughter of the police commissioner.  She gives the girl a figurine and a necklace which seem to allow the ghost of the dead gypsy to enter her body.

There's a dumb levitation scene which seems to serve no purpose other than to confirm to the audience that, yes, she is indeed possessed.  The possessed little girl acts out the maligned misdeeds of the gypsy by sacrificing an infant, speaking obscenities, unconvincingly twisting her torso 360 degrees, loving Lucifer, engaging in a lot of telekinetic nonsense around the house, strangling people, a random castration, mimicking people's voices, baby snatching, holding evil gypsy witch meetings.

It's all rather melodramatic and boring.  Very boring.  The story doesn't seem to have any aim as we watch the possessed girl carry out one sin after another.  In the end a priest burns a crucifix on her forehead and she falls impaled on a big cross.  Nobody wins, especially not the viewers.

IF YOU LIKE THIS WATCH:  If you like random and obscure horror movies then I'd suggest The Nesting (1981), The Outing (1987), Deadly Blessing (1981) and The Sentinel (1977).
