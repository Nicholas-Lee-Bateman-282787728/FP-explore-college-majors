2228745,1,B0007PAM24,"the episodes are not all that amazing, but  the worst part is how they hype it as being star wars related episodes, when in fact none of them are, the last episode has a cameo by mark hamil as luke, that's only a few minutes long, other than that, there is no reason why these episodes were picked, or why you would play up the star wars angle other than trying to feed off the hype for episode III.

unlike the christmas and halloween themed seta that were very nice and contained episodes related to those seasons, and was a great idea, this has no theme to it, and i hate False advertising.",1115164800,85,593,4.238938053097345
2228746,1,B0007PAM24,"Just an attempt to push Episode 3. Notice the release date? Instead of screwing around and making single dvd's, why not bring out more than just 2 seasons on dvd a year?",1113868800,16,169,4.3125
2228747,4,B0007PAM24,"This is probably the first real ""Classic Simpsons"" disk that has come out.  The other singles have mostly been about the more recent, not to mention far less funny and at times insulting, seasons.  There are four episodes.  The first one is Dog of Death.  In it Santa's Little Helper is deathly ill and the family has to make great sacrifices to afford for the operation to save him.  But as a result they are all angry at the mutt, who then runs away and gets abducted by Mr. Burns.  A good episode, although it's already on the 3rd season collection.  Luckily, the other three episodes haven't been released yet.  First off is Marge Be Not Proud, a charming X-mas episode, which for some reason wasn't even included on either Christmas DVD, where Bart shoplifts a video game.  We see Bart actually feel guilty in this episode, giving him a very nice touch of characterization, something the later episodes are extremely lacking in.  The Secret War of Lisa Simpson sees the Simpson kids enrolled in a military school.  Although Bart is soon accepted by the other kids, Lisa is shunned.  Lisa becomes more depressed and alone, and eventually Bart's the only one who gives her any kind of support.  The final episode, Mayored to the Mob, was from the 10th season, which is when the series started to veer from the sitcom status to more of the Family Guy rip-off style it has become nowadays.  As a result, it's the weakest in the set, however, it is still more entertaining than some of the other than, say, all the episodes on the 2nd Christmas DVD.  In it, Homer becomes a bodyguard for Mayor Quimby, who is soon targeted by Fat Tony(brilliantly voiced by Joe Mantegna).  Mark Hamill guest stars as himself and a few additional voices.  All in all, it's a flawed set, but it seems to be the first one of the single disks headed in the right track.",1112140800,10,1848,4.551515151515152
2228748,1,B0007PAM24,"Don't take this one star review the wrong way. I love the Simpsons, it's probably my favorite next to Monty Python. A scale for comedy shouled be measured by how below other shows are then these. But why does Fox have to keep sending out these single disc dvd's some of which have already been realesed, and some of recent series which have very much lost there quality, with a few exceptions. The season 6 dvd will be out in August, but maybe if it wasn't for dvd's like this it would have been out a while ago. For example: The Simpsons Christmas dvd was pointless, because two of the episodes had already been realeased, the mr. plow one had no mention of Christmas whatsoever anyway. The the snd edition has a alternate title as well as two episodes that have vertualy nothing to do with Christmas. What's the point. Dog of Death was out a while ago, with commentary, and storyboards. This dvd has it without storyboards and commentary. What is the real point of these dvd's. I guess it's to keep our hopes up and for us to say 'Well at least they relaesed a dvd recently'. It takes a whole year for another season dvd to come out. Friends is up to like 9, and has been for a while. I can't stand that show, so why should that show stand to get much better realese time. i doubt the wi=riters and animators don't have free time everyday to record commentaries. They obviously have funn recording them. This dvd has very average episodes and not that funny, only because for a long time, the Simpsons have kept up such a high standerd of clever, well-written, and hillarious comedy.

So I wish Fox would stop recording these, and I wish I could have season 9 on Dvd, before I graduate High School.",1111104000,6,1700,4.414012738853503
2228779,3,B0007PAM24,"I was expecting Star Wars related episodes here but all it got was the episode with Mark Hamill that I seen a dozen times already. Anyways this compilation did help me remember why I used to love the Simpsons so much. ""Marge Be Not Proud"" and ""The Secret War of Lisa"" were not only really funny but kinda touching as well. This is the cool thing about earlier episodes, they managed to be irreverent but also affectionate.",1312156800,,422,4.4935064935064934

2228783,1,B0007PAM24,"I think it is rather shameful of fox to mis-represent what this DVD is. They call it Bart Wars, and put Darh Vader on the cover why is it unreasonable to buy it expecting the Star-Wars episodes of  THe SImpsons? They are not bad episodes (So Please don't send a letter to Foz about me whoever writes those ""a Kid's Review"" But Fox should be ashamed for trying to rip off the fans and decieving us like this. The only rason to buy this is if you can't wait for the eventual Box Set of their respective Season. Otherwise, if you do buy it you are just getting another hastily thrown together DVD to keep us (the fans) at bay until they can catch up On the Season Box sets.

2228795,1,B0007PAM24,"This isn't hard to figure out.  Fox released the latest Star Wars film this past May and they also own the rights to the Simpsons.  This DVD was released within a few days of the film's release.

The episodes are all pretty good, but I'm not sure what the point of this was.  It's good if you're a Simpsons fan who just wants something to view on a plane or long car trip.  It's only 9 bucks, so it obviously was popular with the average fan.

But if you're a hardcore fan like me who's collecting every season, you won't waste your money on this and instead wait for the next season to come out.

It really depends on what you're looking for.",1132272000,4,643,4.178861788617886
2228796,1,B0007PAM24,The DVD didn't even come in the original packing.  It was just in a regualar CD jewel case.  I'm going to have to buy another copy just to complete my Simpson's set!!!,1125705600,5,167,4.1875
2228797,1,B0007PAM24,"There's a sticker on the cover that says: ""3 new to DVD episodes.""  As President Clinton once said, ""It depends on what the definition of 'is' is.""  Apparently, this doesn't mean, episodes that are New and only on DVD, it means, episodes that were never on DVD before.  As already discussed, there are no epsidodes in this package that includes the artwork depicted on the cover (and back) of the package.

Oddly enough, there is also no phone number for Fox Home Video anywhere on the package.  Go to their website, and you will also not find a phone number.  So after over an hour of research, I finally called the main Fox ""News Corp"" number, and left a message... four times.  Finally, someone called back today and woke me at at 8:15 in the morning... and again at 8:35...

So, the least I can do from this experience, it to share with you the super secret number for Fox Home Video TV Products Customer Relations, which is in the subject of this message.

2228798,5,B0007PAM24,"The packaging says ""3 new episodes"". Oh wait, it says 3 new episodes...TO DVD! My God you people are so slow, these 3 episodes haven't been released on DVD before so they would be considered ""new to DVD"". As well as only 1 episode having to do with Star Wars, if you've known anything about The Simpsons, they've only had one episode that was related to Star Wars and thats on here (one with Homer as Quimby's body guard). Final thoughts, you people shouldn't judge a DVD by its cover. The Simpsons are making a little joke for the box (so you think its about Star Wars) but really, why would they make 4 episodes based on Star Wars? OHHHHHHH wait...they didn't. You people are too impulsive and shouldn't be allowed to have credit cards.",1121472000,,738,4.474074074074074

2228800,1,B0007PAM24,"*SO* cheesed off at Fox.  The episodes they included have nothing to do with Star Wars.  The box is misleading.  I would have been happier if they would have at least included episodes about Kang and Kodos, at least they have a spaceship.",1120176000,9,238,4.488372093023256
2228801,1,B0007PAM24,"Looking at the cover and the spoof title (and the inside sheet and the DVD menus!), one would think that the episodes chosen have SOMETHING to do with Star Wars.  However, you will be sorely disappointed if you expect even a hint of connection with Star Wars save for the last episode with Mark Hamill (which is a classic in my opinion).  Being a Star Wars and a Simpsons fan, I was hoping for ANYTHING more than what I got with Bart Wars.  I was very disappointed....",1119312000,8,468,4.35632183908046
2228802,4,B0007PAM24,"Pity Darth Vader. He used to represent the worst that the dark side could do. Darth Vader needs to be scared. Very Scared. Bart Simpson represents the darkest side of the force and Darth, he's going to whip your butt. The entertainment business is like ILG (the company that advertises on TV in ""The Simpsons"" as recycling the essential chemicals of your body into food stuff); it's all about recycle, recycle, recycle. The good news is that this recycled set (which has four episodes that come from the years 1992, 1995, 1997 and 1998). ""Bart Wars"", alas, isn't all tied into ""Star Wars"" but Mark Hamill DOES appear in one episode in Luke Skywalker garb. There are four delightful episodes from the series included here including the classic ""Dog of Death"" where Santa's Little Helper (Bart's dog)  must have an expensive operation. The Simpsons resent him so much afterward they sell him to Mr. Burns where SLH becomes an evil hound till Bart's love wins him back. Sigh. ""Marge Be Not Proud"" focuses on Marge's reaction when Bart shoplifts a new video game he can't afford. In ""The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"" Lisa (and Bart) join a new military school and must survive an obstacle course. In ""Mayored to the Mob""

The family attends a science fiction convention where Homer saves Mark Hamill from an unruly mob.  This changes Homer's life and he decides to become a bodyguard to the Mayor. The mob is now after the Mayor. The mob is in for a very big surprise.

The same masters used for the boxed sets were used for this set as well so, needless to say, the image quality is exceptionally good with bright colors, nice sharp image quality and minimal digital artifacts. The stereo surround soundtrack is pretty good as well making good use of the format. The dialogue (one of the delights of any ""Simpsons"" episode) comes across bright and clear.

Although it isn't advertised on the box, there are extras with this set. The extras are drawn from the boxed set and are for the episode ""Mayored to the Mob"". We get an animatic section for the first act, an animation showcase that allows you to use the angle button to change the view from storyboards, animatic and the completed episode. Two of the options are shown as picture-in-picture in the lower left and right hand corner of the screen. It's a pity that Fox didn't do here as they did with the themed ""X-Files"" sets and include new commentary tracks or even preview an episode that hasn't aired on TV yet (much as Paramount has done with some ""SpongeBobSquarePants"" episodes).

If you'd like to own just a little slice of Simpson heaven, this is a pretty good place to start. As much as I love this show, I doubt I'll be collecting every season on DVD (I'd have no place to put my other DVDs afterwards) so the fact that Fox is releasing a taste like this is good but could be improved.

I'd suggest, however, that they release a highlights disc for each season consisting of 8 episodes with extras for the best two along with commentary tracks since they already have access to them. It's a great way for a casual fan to collect the series. Fox didn't have to put any extras on this one and I'm happy that they did include some.",1118880000,6,3190,4.576182136602452
2228803,4,B0007PAM24,The Star Wars theme is just a spoof for Bart...Hence the name Bart Wars! these episodes are suppose to be based on Bart and his worst moments. However only 2 or maybe 3 have something to do with Bart...Star Wars is just a spin off name.,1118188800,,236,4.1521739130434785
2228814,2,B0007PAM24,"As others have noted, the tie-in is really misleading.  You get only one episode that has anything to do with Star Wars, and that only half-way in.  The other episodes are decent ones, but at least know you are not really getting anything that has much to do with Star Wars.

A much nicer idea would have been a montage made with bits from other episodes that were Star-Wars related, along with the Mark Hamil episode.",1117843200,6,418,4.473684210526316
2228815,1,B0007PAM24,"What a rip off, very misleading cover, has barely anything to do with star wars. DVD contains 4 old & very average episodes, including one that features the voice of Mark Hamil.

2228816,3,B0007PAM24,"I agree with a lot of the other reviewers about one thing: this dvd is pushed as a Star Wars dvd but actually has little to do with Star Wars. Bart and Homer duel with lightsabers on the cover, but that episode is nowhere to be seen. So I was disappointed. However, the episodes that are there are very funny.",1117324800,4,309,4.166666666666667
2228817,4,B0007PAM24,"Just the last dvd on this disc has Mark Hamil on it and is a hilarious episode. Homer becomes a bodyguard for the Mayor after he saves Mark and the Mayor from nerds at a Sci-fi convention. There's other episodes that also have StarWars jokes that could've been added on the disc. Instead there's just 3 other episodes that have nothing to do with it at all. The cover shows Bart with a lightsaber fighting Homer dressed up like Darth Vader. That's false advertising because there's not even an episode like that on this dvd.

  There's one episode that could've and should've been added. That's an episode where Lenny and Carl are fighting with Lightsabers. They're arguing saying ""Episode 1 sucks more..., No episode 2 sucks more!"". Still though since the show is always funny. The episodes on the disc that have nothing to do with StarWars are still funny. Ok this isn't  worth 15 dollars but the Mark Hamil episode will still make any StarWars fan laugh. Plus I love the part on one non-StarWars episode where Homer and Marge get Bart to go to Military school by lieing saying they're going to Disney World lol.",1116979200,5,1114,4.6395939086294415
2228818,1,B0007PAM24,"I bought this DVD because I thought it would contain spoof's of Star Wars for my son.  He and I both thought that was on there and both of us were terribly disappointed (a 7 year old does not understand about marketing)

I am appalled that Fox would sink this low and deliberately try to cheat people..  If I want to see the Simpsons we turn on the TV! I for one now have a bad taste in my mouth when it comes to Fox and I will never ever buy another DVD from them.

Obviously as a cash in with the release of episode 3, they've decided to release it in the USA.

However there are some good episodes and it is still the Simpsons, and these episodes are from the time when it was at the top of its game.

2228821,1,B0007PAM24,"virtually no thought or care went into this dvd collection.  it just seems to be playing up the Star Wars angle with no real connection to it.  here's why you should skip it:

1.  only 4 episodes(and one's already on dvd)

2.  no extras to make up for the fact there's only 4.

3.  no theme to this set(a cameo by mark hamill doesn't justify a star wars theme)

do yourself a favor and either get one of their 5 episodes + a featurette set(like the christmas one).  or better yet, save your ten bucks, add to it slowly, and then bust it open and buy those complete season sets as soon as they come out.  at least those are well thought out and packed with extras.  if you need a quick fix, watch a few episodes from your current seasonal sets.  this bart wars disc just screams ""rip-off"" too much for me to cut it any slack.",1116288000,8,824,4.139240506329114
2228822,3,B0007PAM24,"Again, Fox is releasing a 4-episode DVD of shows you'll be able to get eventually on the full season compilations being released at a snail's pace each year (one of these episodes is already available on a full season set). The episodes are Dog of Death, Marge Be Not Proud, The Secret War Of Lisa Simpson, and Mayored To The Mob. For those who can't wait for all those sets or who just like the convenience of these theme compilations, this may be worth the modest price of roughly $10 to $11. However, even for that money you'd think there would be a few more episodes on these discs. After all, without commercials each show only runs about 22 to 23 minutes. Then there is the cheesy marketing ploy of using the current Star Wars Episode III fever sweeping the nation to market this collection, which has only one episode in it with any real connection to or parody of Star Wars. Note that The Simpsons is a Fox show and Star Wars is a Fox film release; this DVD's title is just a blatant attempt to cross-market two products owned by the same company. Notice that the DVD's release date is just two days before Star Wars Episode III opens in movie theaters.

There are fun episodes on this DVD, but these 4-episode releases are of dubious value given their short running time, lack of extra features and the fact that the episodes are being released on the full season sets. My 3-star rating of this disc is not a comment on the quality of the episodes, but rather a comment on the quality and value of the DVD. If you only want modestly priced ""best of"" collections then this disc is a good way to own some Simpsons episodes without spending a lot of money on the full season sets, otherwise, you may want to think twice before you plunk down your cash.",1115942400,27,1758,4.409230769230769
