8005390,5,B000127IGG,My 2.5 year old has been watching this video for the past 6 months. He loves it. Between the animals and the tractors it keeps him interested each time he watches it. Well put together DVD and highly recommended. Girls would probably like it took as it talks about baby chickens and other non-machinery events on a farm.,1317600000,,320,4.5344827586206895
8005391,5,B000127IGG,"My son is 3 1/2, and he loves this movie.  It's presented simply, but includes a lot of detail about farms and how they work.  My son knows that honey comes from an apiary, and that veterinarians give cows checkups.  Good clean fun!",1102550400,,232,4.348837209302325
