8480548,5,B005NJLFAM,"This DVD has the Documentary films of WLADYSLAW SLESICKI (Polish Director from the School of Documentaries in Poland).
All films are shot in Black & White, in Poland in the 50's-60's. The photography is absolutely stunning and the anthropological importance of each film is beyond words. These films are a window into a world long gone.  Shot in Poland a few years only after World World II (1950's and early 60's) and during the occupation already of Russian Communism, we discover a way of life long gone. WLADYSLAW SLESICKI is one of Poland's greatest filmmakers. His talent and vision deserve to be recognized as one of the greatest filmmakers of documentaries. I was moved beyond words by the beauty, simplicity and poetry of each of these films.",1326844800,,751,4.913385826771654
