3153862,4,B0016821YI,"I wondered how the BBC would handle their 4.5 season of specials...this. The one-shot new companion nature of the Dr. Who specials lends it self to this single story DVD release.  This ""Easter Special"" follows the 2008 X-Mas special ""The Next Doctor""  leading us up to the END for the !0th Doctor as played by David Tennant....some reference is made to this in the final moments of  Planet of the Dead with some foreshadowing similar to the Planet of the OOD line about the Doctor's song coming to an End (but not before the October special and Xmas 2009).

Planet of the Dead is a pretty good special with some lovely cinematography and great location in  the Dubai desert , some retro-aliens. The Doctor and a bus load of characters make an unscheduled stop on a desert planet . Characters like ""sassy""  wealthy adventurer/thief Lady Christina de Souza a'la Laura Kroft  as played by the lovely Michelle Ryan (Merlin, the Bionic Woman, Jekyll) are likely to become fan favorites. Ryan, contrary to internet buzz, never auditioned to replace Billie Piper's Rose in '06, but after seeing the end product I think you'll agree she'd  make a terrific season 5 or 6 addition to the cast. Enough filibustering for Ryan, the cast was great including Mousehunt's  Lee Evans who superbly plays UNIT's technical support and parody of fandom....oh yeah did I mention UNIT gives fire support as always.

Extras....Backstory is outlined in the consistently good behind-the-scenes series ""Dr. Who Confidential."" This features the making of the special was even better the actual end product...how the double-decker bus of shipped out of country, the stunts, disasters endured and of course effects.",1246060800,17,1685,5.007168458781362
3153863,3,B0016821YI,"This dvd release and the one for ""The Next Doctor"" in September is are what the BBC call the vanilla DVDs or  used to call them that.  With almost no special features they are sold so children and the less avid fans can afford them. This is not anything new it only looks that way as we here in North America are often so far behind the UK that the box sets are all we see and then the vanilla DVDs. So the there will probably be no commentary on these dvds,

And the only reason that this dvd is coming out before ""The Next Doctor"" is that Planet of the Dead is the first  episode recored in High-definition and they are releasing the blu-ray  before the next Comic-Con",1245888000,2,670,4.162790697674419
3153864,1,B0016821YI,"Given that the BBC is only producing a handful of episodes of Doctor Who this year, you'd think each one would be crafted with care and skill.  Alas, that is not the case.  The plot of this ""special"" is nonsensical bordering on nonexistent.  Some people on a bus (including the Doctor, of course) end up on an alien planet thanks to some flying manta rays that are zipping around in swarms really, really quickly.  Or something.  Oh, and there's an international super-thief on the bus, too.  As there often are.  And an old psychic lady for good measure.  This whole people-trapped-on-a-bus-bond-and-bicker scenario was done better last season of Doctor Who in an episode called ""Midnight.""  In fact, the Doctor actually makes a joke to that effect in this episode.  Calling out that you're plagiarizing your own stories doesn't make it okay....  Don't waste your money on this DVD.  Hopefully next year's ""reboot"" of Doctor Who with new writers and a new showrunner will step up the quality of the program.",1245801600,10,1008,4.864705882352941
3153865,5,B0016821YI,One greatest Sci fi programs of all time!  I don't see what the big deal is with everyone and the price of the DVD!!  Most of the original Who shows with tom baker and john pertwee will run at least $20 or more for one DVD..  Personally I'm Glad that the last couple of David's movies are being release indvidually rather having to pay a fortune for one big box set..The way I see it you have 2 options ... Buy the DVD and enjoy it or don't buy it and complain about how you don't have it!!,1245628800,17,490,3.979591836734694

As for the other reviews, I completely agree. An acceptable show, one of the series, but certainly NOT a $10, best of the series, price! If you want the best episode, it's the ""Family of Blood"" with Freema Agyeman 2 part... However, that said: the Christmas Special: ""The Next Doctor"" was far superior. Hopefully they put out the entire series 4.2 series on one DVD. 4 episodes for $10 is the right price.",1245628800,2,655,4.368852459016393
3153867,1,B0016821YI,"Hey ""Who"" Fans! I count myself as one of your brood, and I have to speak up about this DVD.

We all know that there are going to be 4 specials for this unofficial ""Season 5"" of Dr. Who (the last episode being a two-part show, shown around Christmas 2009 in the UK). So, we can only assume that at some point all 4 shows will be included in their own DVD set. Buying individual episodes sends the wrong message to the BBC. We DON'T want to shell out cash for one-offs -- give us some value for our money.

And if any BBC execs are reading this, how about throwing in the animated ""Dreamland"" to any upcoming 2009 Episodes DVD set? It would be a really nice include.

And to the fella' on this review list who thought that ""The Next Doctor"" was part of this series of specials, sorry -- if the BBC holds true to their prior DVD releases, then THAT episode will be included in the release of next season's box set. Just look at how they packaged seasons 2 through 4. The previous year's Christmas Special was always included in the following season's DVD box set.",1245283200,16,1060,4.263681592039801
3153868,1,B0016821YI,"At 13 episodes a season, the series price for one episode (Amazon discount) is about $5 (per episode). I am not paying double that price, for an episode I haven't even seen! Get real, Russell T. Davies & BBC!

P.S. What happened to the first special? (Or are you saving that as a bonus for the ""specials full set"", making everyone re-purchase all the individual specials they bought!) Love Doctor Who! Love the new (and old) series! Hate this price gouging! Aren't you Brits having the same economic depression we are?",1244419200,4,518,4.6923076923076925

3153878,5,B0016821YI,"As single episode DVDs go this is pretty good. One of the better, self-contained DW stories recently done. Overally I have to say I have come to like Matt Smith best of all for the new doctors, mainly because he's brought a real sense of humor to the role that the others haven't. But David Tennant was also very good in the role.

The BBC has released seasons of the show in odd ways from the American point of view (partial season, collector's editions etc.), which confuses things and makes it hard to collect all the shows in proper chronological order at reasonable cost. But if you are looking for just one DW flick to pass an evening with, you can't go wrong with this one.",1389657600,,680,4.396825396825397

3153885,4,B0016821YI,"To date this DVD is my only Doctor Who purchase, and I think it's a good one. Like the series itself this special doesn't take itself too seriously yet exhibits a level of thought and detail that makes you wonder what a ""serious"" Doctor Who episode or theatrical release could be like.
From Michelle Ryan's guest appearance as society play girl / thief making her escape on a crowded double decker bus (apparently she even did her own stunt work) to their adventures on the other, dead, planet and return to Earth- everything a fan of the Doctor would expect and want in a story. I especially liked the bit where the Doctor needed something to make a bit of stolen alien tech work so the bus could escape back to Earth. He got Lady deSouza?(s) stolen gold artifact- and to her horror promptly proceeded to flatten it.

Please watch the behind the scenes special- it'll be worth your time.",1354233600,2,888,4.55

3153887,5,B0016821YI,"Good Doctor Who special. Excellent chemistry with Lady Christina made me wish that she had been kept on as a companion for a while. The aliens were a bit hokey, but considering how serious the Doctor is from here through the End of Time, we needed a good fun romp on an alien world.
Recommended to all Doctor Who fans, and this one might be a pretty good introduction to Doctor Who for younger people. It's pretty fun and not too scary with lots of good action and some good problem solving as well as great banter between the characters.",1352505600,,538,4.39
3153888,5,B0016821YI,This was a cool adventure for the Doctor. The new companion was great. Wish she would return for other adventures. Recommended viewing for all Doctor Who fans!,1344643200,,159,4.925925925925926
3153889,3,B0016821YI,"""Doctor Who: Planet of the Dead"" is the first of the 2009 Doctor Who specials, and follows the Christmas 2008 special ""The Next Doctor"". It is the first Who story available in high definition. Aside from that, ""Planet of the Dead"" is good but not very special. Compared, for example, to the 2007 Christmas Special ""Voyage of the Damned"", ""Planet of the Dead"" has a simpler and less original story, less interesting characters, and less excitement. It's not bad, and I enjoyed watching it, but it's not among the best episodes with the tenth Doctor. Reviewed 8/29/2009 after watching on Blu-ray.",1325894400,,594,4.891089108910891
3153890,5,B0016821YI,"I had seen every special that was made between seasons four and five, except this one. Now I've just recently checked it out from my public library and watched it, and although I still liked ""The Next Doctor"" better, I very much enjoyed this one as well.

Faults:

I don't and never have believed in phychics, so when they slapped a phychic in this story who tells the Doctor of the ""Prophecy"", it really pissed me off and almost ruined the story for me. I also miss the Brigadier an awful lot. Although the Brigadier and the Doctor had their disagreements in the classic series, the Brig would have never chosen to sacrifice the Doctor's life without first giving him a chance to succeed. The lady who commands UNIT in this story seems awful cold-hearted. I had a hard time liking her after she decided to sacrifice the Doctor.

Strengths:

This story has a lot of good actors and special effects in it. The characters (apart from the UNIT commander) are all great and fun to watch. The story also has lots of action and funny parts in it too. I also think that Christina made a great company for the Doctor, and if she continued in the show, I think she'd would have made the best companion ever!

A great and fun adventure that keeps you hooked from beginning to end.

Highly recommended!",1284163200,,1291,4.495726495726496
3153891,5,B0016821YI,I got this movie for my son who is a huge Dr. Who and David Tennant fan. It is a great DVD and would recommend it to any Dr. Who fan.,1278201600,,133,3.3225806451612905

3153893,1,B0016821YI,"This ""special"" has not one bit of the elements that make the best of recent DOCTOR WHO fresh and exciting. Forced attempts at drama and humor. A forced excuse for another kiss. Embarassingly derivative cgi aliens. Writing which once again seeks to tell the viewer to like a new character or to think that said character makes a great partner for the Doctor. Even David Tennant seems to just walk through his part this one. Eye-rollingly convenient plot devices and distasteful glossing-over of gruesome deaths. Yuck. This is ""new Who"" at it's worst; it's smug. And then you've got the portents of things to come delivered by the working class psychic woman. The Doctor uncharacteristically takes this to heart only because it serves to set up the remaining three specials of his tenure. I enjoy David Tennant but I feel he is sorely over-estimated as a dramatic actor. A froggy grimace and some moist eyes does not a heart-rending scene make. If you want to remember David's Doctor at his exhilirating best, displaying his range of strengths, pick up THE WEDDING OF SARAH JANE SMITH instead.",1265587200,,1091,4.870967741935484

3153897,5,B0016821YI,"When the Doctor hijacks other peoples transport trips they never seem to go well for the other tourists. Like he did in the episode Midnight. Countless other episodes show how he just manages to get other people killed without giving it much thought that maybe this would not have happened had he not been there. Nurse Redfern goes so far as to ask him if he had chosen another place to take his stand against the family of blood then would any of those people had to have died. That made the Doctor stop and think. Well, he never seems to remember the error of his ways for very long and this episode is another example of the Doctor getting other people in hot water. Whether the bus would have gone into the hole by itself might be debatable, but I suppose it was going to. Even so, he is at it again. This time, it is another casual partnership he has instead of having to invest in a permanent companion. The Duchess stands her own with him and goes caving before he can remove his coat. She proves to be as careless and nonchalant as he is. At least this episode did not have a dumb giant metal monster at the end. Not too shabby all in all. And a foreboding premonition from the pork chop lady stops his smirk for a minute or two. A well rounded adventure.",1259884800,,1263,4.266666666666667

3153899,5,B0016821YI,"I absolutely bloody loved this special episode with Tennant and Ryan.  It's always nice to get someone like Ryan (Lady Christina) to play against Tennant's (the ""Doctor"") scene-stealing talent.  Storyline is not your typical serious and horror-like atmosphere.  It's more playful and teasing with the sexual attraction between the Doctor and Lady Christina.  All cast members were wonderful and especially appreciated the bus passengers dynamic.  A little bit like TV's Lost in the beginning but it's done with a slight twist in the desert.  First scene is brilliant with laser beams and treasure hunting heist in the museum.  Oh my lord, the directors and producers nailed this script for everyone to enjoy.  Everyone does not have to be a frigging Doctor Who fan to appreciate this special episode.  Yes, it's only 60 minutes but it's an exciting thrill ride.  Amusement park rides should be more like this TV episode with double decker bus going through worm holes.  Okay, I said too much and will let you decide for yourselves.  There is an added bonus with the Doctor Who Confidential which shows all the planning and design for all the scenes.  Pretty exciting and you appreciate every aspect of the team of TV producers, directors, set designers, make-up artists, etc.  Blimey good fun, mate.  These blokes got it right in these last few special episodes.

Also aboard this bus is a thief that the police are pursuing, Lady Christina de Souza. As they drive through a tunnel, a wormhole opens, and the bus and passengers are whisked away to an alien world much like a desert.

There are many good, solid performances in this episode, and many funny moments (most courtesy of Doctor Malcolm with UNIT, who I do hope returns in a future episode).

Our family actually found the behind the scenes documentary of how they got the bus into the Dubai desert more exciting than the episode itself.",1250553600,,683,4.636363636363637

There is no compelling reason to buy this as a stand alone item.  It has been shown pretty much everywhere the BBC reaches.

A agree with the lack of originality mentioned by other reviewers.  Plus, contrary to the comment about the picture quality is was unimpressed.  Michelle Ryan is a goodish actress, but the part was over the top.  It almost seemed like a stereotype & parody of itself.  The anti-Bruce Wayne (i.e. thief with a ton of money).

3153915,5,B0016821YI,I have been watching Doctor Who since 1979. I Have seen and own every single episode there is on DVD ... and I have all of the old episodes taped off PBS ... back to William Hartnell ... to fill in the blanks until all of the old ones are released on DVD. Each Doctor has added something and was unique ... I love tem all ... but David Tennant is in my top 3 favorites of all time! Of course some stories have similarities ... same guy writes a lot of the new episodes. I love this story! It was another solid Doctor Who story with more foreshadowing of the Doctor's next death. Someone mentioned Pitch Black (one of my favorite movies) ... I don't see the same plot or the same killing machines. Again ... there are a lot of sci fi stories out there ... so I guess you can always find similarities if you look hard enough. I feel this story stands on its own! This is a great buy! It's got the Doctor WHo Confidential as a special feature which is reallly nice! The original Whos have special features too .... but they are more expensive! I imagine at some point David Tennant's last year as the Doctor is going to be boxed together ... but I couldn't wait so I put it on my Amazon list and got it for my birthday!!! One of my favorite gifts! I liked the dynamic the doctor had with his new temporary assistant. I realize he has lost allllll of his assistants ... but she woulda made a great addition. I hope the new Doctor goes back and gets her LOL,1250121600,3,1452,4.134275618374558

The Especial is quite good, The Desert view looks alien indeed, but I think the red sands of the Monmgolian desert is more alien to me. Lady Cristina is funny, cocky and a great team with the Doctor. This especial have nothing to do with Eastern by the way, have a strong ""influence"" of Pitch Black. David performance remenbers me the last years of Tom Baker as The Doctor. The Episode fits perfect as part of any season of the Doctor.

Esta aventura del Doctor, recuerda mucho los escenarios y la trama de Pitch Black, es como si el Doctor viajara a ese planeta. El desierto parece un planeta lejano y Lady Cristina hubiese sido tremenda companion del Doctor de haber sido este episodio parte de un season completo.

After the events from the XMAS special of '08 (by the way if your wondering this came out before that and I still haven't been able to see that yet.

After what she thinks is a perfect theft she sets the alrams and has to get out quickly. Finding her way on a double decker bus she encounters the Doctor who as usual does his thing and he along with everyone else on the bus are sent to antoher world of endless sand.  Soon the Doctor along with the thief really Lady Christina have to find a way back and soon for something is coming.  Something big and something bad.  I don't want to give to much away for those who want to see it.  Needless to say it was great to see Tennant Doctor again after the events from series 4.

3153919,3,B0016821YI,"(Let's call it 3 & 1/2 stars)
I was also a little disappointed when I first watched this episode online a few months ago (Human-ear friendly bluetooths in a ship where the crew has no ears? Alien anti-gravity clamps that just happen to be the right size and number to fit the wheels of a London bus?). I also think it was a wasted trip for them to shoot in Dubai since most people will assume the vast expanse of desert is just a CGI trick anyway. I didn't think I would be watching it again anytime soon.

Having said that, I recently saw it again with a couple of people who are only casual Doctor Who watchers and they enjoyed it and took it for what it was, an amusing diversion. This made me relax and just have fun with it. It was good to see UNIT in action again and Lee Evans is always hilarious (if you haven't seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mouse-Hunt/dp/0783231172/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mouse Hunt</a>, do so immediately!)

I think most fans' problems with this special stem from the fact that we are having to wait so long between installments and we expect every one to be a complex stunner. In a normal season this would have been a perfectly acceptable light ""change of pace"" entry sandwiched between two heavier episodes. I think after we've seen the upcoming specials, which promise to be darker, this one will be put in its proper context.",1249171200,7,1411,4.802469135802469
3153920,4,B0016821YI,"This isn't the best Doctor Who episode ever and I think that's the problem for a lot of people.  With only a single episode gracing our screens for the larger part of a year, I think were expecting something spectacular and amazing.  This doesn't meet that bar, but it is a solid and entertaining hour of television.

The story is typical Doctor Who: the Doctor hops onto a bus trying to track a stray wormhole and he bus is thrown into another planet that is complete desert.  Aliens lurk behind the Dunes and a strange cloud of objects approaches.

The story isn't as epic as the previous season finales.  However, on the positive side, it also a little toned-down from the over-the-top pace that has characterized Davies' tenture on Doctor Who.  For once, we take our time in getting to know the characters and the situation before things get crazy.

There are several things that make this episode work for me.  First is Michelle Ryan, who is a great companion to the Doctor and who I hope we'll see again down the road.  She continues the trend away from the helpless screaming companions, not only proving useful for the plot but matching the Doctor one-liner for one-liner.  Second, is Davies' patented ear for character and dialogue.  As ridiculous is the situation is (and as loopy as his science is) he always makes me ignore that with strong characters that I come to believe in and care for.

Finally, since this is the first DW episode ever in HD, I'll not that the transfer is spectacular.  The desert looks amazing and the F/X stood up just fine on my plasma (although the flying bus looked a little weak).  Fortunately, the episode does not try to overload on F/X; it would have had no problem fitting in with the old series.",1249084800,,1741,4.588996763754046

3153922,5,B0016821YI,"DOCTOR WHO:  PLANET OF THE DEAD is a very fun, very entertaining Easter special that provides fans with a light-hearted episode featuring David Tennant, the beloved Tenth Doctor.  As we all know by now, this shortened 5th season will be Mr. Tennant's last, and it certainly was enjoyable to see him save the day in typical easy-going fashion.

DOCTOR WHO:  PLANET OF THE DEAD is full of the characteristic energy and charm that is brought to the Tenth Doctor by David Tennant.  He matches wits with Michelle Ryan, who would clearly make an excellent companion and foil for Mr. Tennant if he were continuing on.  The chemistry between the two brought a well needed sparkle back to DOCTOR WHO:  PLANET OF THE DEAD, and the pair was quite fun to watch.

As DOCTOR WHO:  PLANET OF THE DEAD opens, Lady Christina de Souza (Ryan) is attempting to evade the police after stealing a rare and priceless artifact.  Of course, she ends up on the same tour bus as our quirky, lovable Doctor.  And as is expected in any episode of DOCTOR WHO, that bus then drives through a wormhole in time and space and winds up on a desert planet, placing all aboard, and all life on Earth, in terrible danger.  As always, it is up to our Doctor and his faithful companion to save humanity.

The Dubai location of DOCTOR WHO:  PLANET OF THE DEAD is quite spectacular, the aliens cool and retro, and the threat to Earth as expected.  Is this ""the best DOCTOR WHO episodes ever?""  Of course not.  But it is engaging, amusing, and very, very Tenth Doctor.  It reminds us why we like David Tennant so much and why he will be sorely missed.",1248912000,13,1608,4.505190311418685

Maybe I didn't really have high expectations going in and was expecting it to be more of what RTD does best: Little on plot, High on drama and technobabble.  I guess I just knew what to expect and could forgive the flying bus and the convenient psychic.

David Tennant turns in another fine performance while Michele Ryan's is just acceptable.  Also the addition of Lee Evans as UNIT's Scientific adviser brings a much needed comedic presence to the show.

As for the plot I loved it!  The Swarm were a really neat sci-fi concept and The Mill did another outstanding job with the effects.

I don't see a problem with the price, don't understand why people are complaining.  Sure it doesn't have tons of extras on it but it does include the entire confidential episode with it.

3388359,4,B0016821YI,"I wondered how the BBC would handle their 4.5 season of specials...this. The one-shot new companion nature of the Dr. Who specials lends it self to this single story DVD release.  This ""Easter Special"" follows the 2008 X-Mas special ""The Next Doctor""  leading us up to the END for the !0th Doctor as played by David Tennant....some reference is made to this in the final moments of  Planet of the Dead with some foreshadowing similar to the Planet of the OOD line about the Doctor's song coming to an End (but not before the October special and Xmas 2009).

Planet of the Dead is a pretty good special with some lovely cinematography and great location in  the Dubai desert , some retro-aliens. The Doctor and a bus load of characters make an unscheduled stop on a desert planet . Characters like ""sassy""  wealthy adventurer/thief Lady Christina de Souza a'la Laura Kroft  as played by the lovely Michelle Ryan (Merlin, the Bionic Woman, Jekyll) are likely to become fan favorites. Ryan, contrary to internet buzz, never auditioned to replace Billie Piper's Rose in '06, but after seeing the end product I think you'll agree she'd  make a terrific season 5 or 6 addition to the cast. Enough filibustering for Ryan, the cast was great including Mousehunt's  Lee Evans who superbly plays UNIT's technical support and parody of fandom....oh yeah did I mention UNIT gives fire support as always.

We all know that there are going to be 4 specials for this unofficial ""Season 5"" of Dr. Who (the last episode being a two-part show, shown around Christmas 2009 in the UK). So, we can only assume that at some point all 4 shows will be included in their own DVD set. Buying individual episodes sends the wrong message to the BBC. We DON'T want to shell out cash for one-offs -- give us some value for our money.

And if any BBC execs are reading this, how about throwing in the animated ""Dreamland"" to any upcoming 2009 Episodes DVD set? It would be a really nice include.

And to the fella' on this review list who thought that ""The Next Doctor"" was part of this series of specials, sorry -- if the BBC holds true to their prior DVD releases, then THAT episode will be included in the release of next season's box set. Just look at how they packaged seasons 2 through 4. The previous year's Christmas Special was always included in the following season's DVD box set.",1245283200,16,1060,4.263681592039801

Compared, for example, to the 2007 Christmas Special ""Voyage of the Damned"", ""Planet of the Dead"" has a simpler and less original story, less interesting characters, and less excitement. It's not bad, and I enjoyed watching it, but it's not among the best episodes with the tenth Doctor. Reviewed 8/29/2009 after watching on Blu-ray.",1325894400,,594,4.891089108910891
3388387,5,B0016821YI,"I had seen every special that was made between seasons four and five, except this one. Now I've just recently checked it out from my public library and watched it, and although I still liked ""The Next Doctor"" better, I very much enjoyed this one as well.

Faults:

I don't and never have believed in phychics, so when they slapped a phychic in this story who tells the Doctor of the ""Prophecy"", it really pissed me off and almost ruined the story for me. I also miss the Brigadier an awful lot. Although the Brigadier and the Doctor had their disagreements in the classic series, the Brig would have never chosen to sacrifice the Doctor's life without first giving him a chance to succeed. The lady who commands UNIT in this story seems awful cold-hearted. I had a hard time liking her after she decided to sacrifice the Doctor.

Strengths:

This story has a lot of good actors and special effects in it. The characters (apart from the UNIT commander) are all great and fun to watch. The story also has lots of action and funny parts in it too. I also think that Christina made a great company for the Doctor, and if she continued in the show, I think she'd would have made the best companion ever!

A great and fun adventure that keeps you hooked from beginning to end.

Highly recommended!",1284163200,,1291,4.495726495726496

A forced excuse for another kiss. Embarassingly derivative cgi aliens. Writing which once again seeks to tell the viewer to like a new character or to think that said character makes a great partner for the Doctor. Even David Tennant seems to just walk through his part this one. Eye-rollingly convenient plot devices and distasteful glossing-over of gruesome deaths. Yuck. This is ""new Who"" at it's worst; it's smug. And then you've got the portents of things to come delivered by the working class psychic woman. The Doctor uncharacteristically takes this to heart only because it serves to set up the remaining three specials of his tenure. I enjoy David Tennant but I feel he is sorely over-estimated as a dramatic actor. A froggy grimace and some moist eyes does not a heart-rending scene make. If you want to remember David's Doctor at his exhilirating best, displaying his range of strengths, pick up THE WEDDING OF SARAH JANE SMITH instead.",1265587200,,1091,4.870967741935484

Countless other episodes show how he just manages to get other people killed without giving it much thought that maybe this would not have happened had he not been there. Nurse Redfern goes so far as to ask him if he had chosen another place to take his stand against the family of blood then would any of those people had to have died. That made the Doctor stop and think. Well, he never seems to remember the error of his ways for very long and this episode is another example of the Doctor getting other people in hot water. Whether the bus would have gone into the hole by itself might be debatable, but I suppose it was going to. Even so, he is at it again. This time, it is another casual partnership he has instead of having to invest in a permanent companion. The Duchess stands her own with him and goes caving before he can remove his coat. She proves to be as careless and nonchalant as he is. At least this episode did not have a dumb giant metal monster at the end. Not too shabby all in all. And a foreboding premonition from the pork chop lady stops his smirk for a minute or two. A well rounded adventure.",1259884800,,1263,4.266666666666667

It's always nice to get someone like Ryan (Lady Christina) to play against Tennant's (the ""Doctor"") scene-stealing talent.  Storyline is not your typical serious and horror-like atmosphere.  It's more playful and teasing with the sexual attraction between the Doctor and Lady Christina.  All cast members were wonderful and especially appreciated the bus passengers dynamic.  A little bit like TV's Lost in the beginning but it's done with a slight twist in the desert.  First scene is brilliant with laser beams and treasure hunting heist in the museum.  Oh my lord, the directors and producers nailed this script for everyone to enjoy.  Everyone does not have to be a frigging Doctor Who fan to appreciate this special episode.  Yes, it's only 60 minutes but it's an exciting thrill ride.  Amusement park rides should be more like this TV episode with double decker bus going through worm holes.  Okay, I said too much and will let you decide for yourselves.  There is an added bonus with the Doctor Who Confidential which shows all the planning and design for all the scenes.  Pretty exciting and you appreciate every aspect of the team of TV producers, directors, set designers, make-up artists, etc.  Blimey good fun, mate.  These blokes got it right in these last few special episodes.

Also aboard this bus is a thief that the police are pursuing, Lady Christina de Souza. As they drive through a tunnel, a wormhole opens, and the bus and passengers are whisked away to an alien world much like a desert.

There are many good, solid performances in this episode, and many funny moments (most courtesy of Doctor Malcolm with UNIT, who I do hope returns in a future episode).

A agree with the lack of originality mentioned by other reviewers.  Plus, contrary to the comment about the picture quality is was unimpressed.  Michelle Ryan is a goodish actress, but the part was over the top.  It almost seemed like a stereotype & parody of itself.  The anti-Bruce Wayne (i.e. thief with a ton of money).

I Have seen and own every single episode there is on DVD ... and I have all of the old episodes taped off PBS ... back to William Hartnell ... to fill in the blanks until all of the old ones are released on DVD. Each Doctor has added something and was unique ... I love tem all ... but David Tennant is in my top 3 favorites of all time! Of course some stories have similarities ... same guy writes a lot of the new episodes. I love this story! It was another solid Doctor Who story with more foreshadowing of the Doctor's next death. Someone mentioned Pitch Black (one of my favorite movies) ... I don't see the same plot or the same killing machines. Again ... there are a lot of sci fi stories out there ... so I guess you can always find similarities if you look hard enough. I feel this story stands on its own! This is a great buy! It's got the Doctor WHo Confidential as a special feature which is reallly nice! The original Whos have special features too .... but they are more expensive! I imagine at some point David Tennant's last year as the Doctor is going to be boxed together ... but I couldn't wait so I put it on my Amazon list and got it for my birthday!!! One of my favorite gifts! I liked the dynamic the doctor had with his new temporary assistant. I realize he has lost allllll of his assistants ... but she woulda made a great addition.

This especial have nothing to do with Eastern by the way, have a strong ""influence"" of Pitch Black. David performance remenbers me the last years of Tom Baker as The Doctor. The Episode fits perfect as part of any season of the Doctor.

Esta aventura del Doctor, recuerda mucho los escenarios y la trama de Pitch Black, es como si el Doctor viajara a ese planeta.

I was also a little disappointed when I first watched this episode online a few months ago (Human-ear friendly bluetooths in a ship where the crew has no ears? Alien anti-gravity clamps that just happen to be the right size and number to fit the wheels of a London bus?). I also think it was a wasted trip for them to shoot in Dubai since most people will assume the vast expanse of desert is just a CGI trick anyway. I didn't think I would be watching it again anytime soon.

Having said that, I recently saw it again with a couple of people who are only casual Doctor Who watchers and they enjoyed it and took it for what it was, an amusing diversion. This made me relax and just have fun with it. It was good to see UNIT in action again and Lee Evans is always hilarious (if you haven't seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mouse-Hunt/dp/0783231172/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mouse Hunt</a>, do so immediately!)

I think most fans' problems with this special stem from the fact that we are having to wait so long between installments and we expect every one to be a complex stunner. In a normal season this would have been a perfectly acceptable light ""change of pace"" entry sandwiched between two heavier episodes. I think after we've seen the upcoming specials, which promise to be darker, this one will be put in its proper context.",1249171200,7,1411,4.802469135802469
3388417,4,B0016821YI,"This isn't the best Doctor Who episode ever and I think that's the problem for a lot of people.  With only a single episode gracing our screens for the larger part of a year, I think were expecting something spectacular and amazing.  This doesn't meet that bar, but it is a solid and entertaining hour of television.

The story is typical Doctor Who: the Doctor hops onto a bus trying to track a stray wormhole and he bus is thrown into another planet that is complete desert.  Aliens lurk behind the Dunes and a strange cloud of objects approaches.

The story isn't as epic as the previous season finales.  However, on the positive side, it also a little toned-down from the over-the-top pace that has characterized Davies' tenture on Doctor Who.  For once, we take our time in getting to know the characters and the situation before things get crazy.

There are several things that make this episode work for me.  First is Michelle Ryan, who is a great companion to the Doctor and who I hope we'll see again down the road.  She continues the trend away from the helpless screaming companions, not only proving useful for the plot but matching the Doctor one-liner for one-liner.  Second, is Davies' patented ear for character and dialogue.  As ridiculous is the situation is (and as loopy as his science is) he always makes me ignore that with strong characters that I come to believe in and care for.

Finally, since this is the first DW episode ever in HD, I'll not that the transfer is spectacular.  The desert looks amazing and the F/X stood up just fine on my plasma (although the flying bus looked a little weak).  Fortunately, the episode does not try to overload on F/X; it would have had no problem fitting in with the old series.",1249084800,,1741,4.588996763754046

3388419,5,B0016821YI,"DOCTOR WHO:  PLANET OF THE DEAD is a very fun, very entertaining Easter special that provides fans with a light-hearted episode featuring David Tennant, the beloved Tenth Doctor.  As we all know by now, this shortened 5th season will be Mr. Tennant's last, and it certainly was enjoyable to see him save the day in typical easy-going fashion.

DOCTOR WHO:  PLANET OF THE DEAD is full of the characteristic energy and charm that is brought to the Tenth Doctor by David Tennant.  He matches wits with Michelle Ryan, who would clearly make an excellent companion and foil for Mr. Tennant if he were continuing on.  The chemistry between the two brought a well needed sparkle back to DOCTOR WHO:  PLANET OF THE DEAD, and the pair was quite fun to watch.

As DOCTOR WHO:  PLANET OF THE DEAD opens, Lady Christina de Souza (Ryan) is attempting to evade the police after stealing a rare and priceless artifact.  Of course, she ends up on the same tour bus as our quirky, lovable Doctor.  And as is expected in any episode of DOCTOR WHO, that bus then drives through a wormhole in time and space and winds up on a desert planet, placing all aboard, and all life on Earth, in terrible danger.  As always, it is up to our Doctor and his faithful companion to save humanity.

The Dubai location of DOCTOR WHO:  PLANET OF THE DEAD is quite spectacular, the aliens cool and retro, and the threat to Earth as expected.  Is this ""the best DOCTOR WHO episodes ever?""  Of course not.  But it is engaging, amusing, and very, very Tenth Doctor.  It reminds us why we like David Tennant so much and why he will be sorely missed.",1248912000,13,1608,4.505190311418685

David Tennant turns in another fine performance while Michele Ryan's is just acceptable.  Also the addition of Lee Evans as UNIT's Scientific adviser brings a much needed comedic presence to the show.

As for the plot I loved it!  The Swarm were a really neat sci-fi concept and The Mill did another outstanding job with the effects.

I don't see a problem with the price, don't understand why people are complaining.  Sure it doesn't have tons of extras on it but it does include the entire confidential episode with it.
