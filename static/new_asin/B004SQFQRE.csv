4464280,2,B004SQFQRE,Not as compelling as you'd think. Two titans of the age don't really differ enough to make it interesting to watch since the discussion is not terribly relevant today.,1384300800,,167,4.793103448275862
4464281,5,B004SQFQRE,"It doesn't get much better than this, with regard to civil discourse and intellectual discussion of ideas. . .Capote and Buckley are two great minds...sharing, debating. ...and all with respect shown for each other.  We are lacking this type of dialogue in today's society.  This is well worth watching.",1384214400,,303,5.163265306122449

4464284,3,B004SQFQRE,"As a writer, I admit I loved the movie Capote, and was intrigued by the prospect of seeing a bit of his personality in an interview situation. I don't know if it was the interviewer, or the nervousness of Truman, which was evident as he is obviously not a person who is normally set in a position to comment on such a serious subject and was probably quite prepared beforehand to make his statement, it was a bit, dare I say, boring. Capote, I'd heard, had a flamboyant and fun personality, but in this interview you won't even see those famous glasses. He takes a sort of middle ground on capitol punishment, that it is not such a deterrent as it is often not performed with consistency, and it is evident that he hasn't really made up his mind but has thought a lot about it. If the story in the movie, Capote, is true, he was overcome with emotion with his involvement during the writing of In Cold Blood, which I have yet to read. But I'm sure he did not want to disappoint anyone, nor become more of a controversial figure than he already was, as he was openly gay in a time when that was a secret kept close to the belt. It even seems like he is trying to be less gay, have a deeper voice. He is more handsome than I imagined. But overall, this is a rather dated piece and a quick few minutes will satisfy.",1350604800,4,1312,4.2103174603174605

8440092,5,B004SQFQRE,Insightful discussion. The rapport between Buckley and Capote improves considerably after a slightly prickly start. The contrast in personalities and in speech makes for plenty of color. This discussion offered subtle points of view on the subject of capitol punishment. Most worthwhile.,1461715200,,287,5.857142857142857

8440094,5,B004SQFQRE,"I love this interview for the fact that Truman is allowed to speak his mind and also explain why he has the opinions that he speaks about. For not having been to college, as Buckly suggests, Capote is very philosophical and intelligent in a way that is usually cultivated through the college experience. I also tend to agree with his opinion on capital punishment, and that someone needs to take the bull by the horns and just fix what is not working, and not pussyfooting around the issue to avoid hurting someone's feelings.",1449273600,,526,4.666666666666667

8440096,3,B004SQFQRE,Very stuffy.... Watched this after having seen Capote and wanted to get a feel for the real Truman while I find him very interesting the interviewer was very over the top.  Mildly entertaining.,1424390400,,193,4.848484848484849
