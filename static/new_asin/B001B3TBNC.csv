A man enters a store to buy clothes, a revolver, and a horse. He is going to Rainbow Valley, about 60 miles away. He sees a man on foot who needs water for Nelly (his automobile). He delivers the mail. Four men on horses pursue and shoot at him! The stranger stops those four men. ""Why don't they build the road?"" Gunmen drive away the workmen. [For what reason?] The people in town need to defend themselves, and prepare a petition for the Governor. The postmistress hears about the attempted stickup. A crowd gathers to watch the fight. They need a fighter like John Martin. Can he guard the workmen on the road? If the road can't go through the miners will sell out for a low price. What organization is behind that gang? John will take charge of the road-building crew.

Work goes on, they have watchmen on duty. When that gang approaches, shots are fired as a warning. The armed workmen drive off that gang. So do sticks of dynamite! The postmistress thanks John. ""Reach for the sky"" says one of the gang to George as they hijack his automobile. John reads the clues in the dirt road and finds the gang's headquarters. He rescues George and his automobile, they make their getaway. In town a man gets into the Post Office to take a letter addressed to the governor. He reads the signatures, and replaces the letter with one that asks for a pardon for Austin Galt! Later works stops due to a lack of dynamite. Butch is freed! We learn about John Martin's past, the word gets out. John goes to meet Butch. Does this look bad? John asks for men and dynamite to fix the road.

The townspeople meet, they must put an end to the gang. They arm themselves with rifles. In town a letter from the Governor identifies John Martin as an undercover agent who must be given ""utmost cooperation""! George must stop that mob of civilians who are running miles to reach the road-building project. The townsmen open fire on the gang. An explosion wipes out Butch's gang and opens the road so wagons can get through. The postmistress thanks John.

This is variation on the classic Western where a small group seeks to exploit and dominate a larger group of people. Thanks to one strong individual this plot is foiled, and prosperity will return to Rainbow Valley. [Unless there is another economic depression.] Towns that depended on mining alone were abandoned when the mines played out. The hero gets the girl and any other rewards offered. But what happened after a few years? Will compatibility grow due to different backgrounds and interests?",1508976000,,2560,4.619780219780219
