2896458,5,B000TESUIG,"I've been purchasing Spanish educational DVD's for my 3 year old since she was born.  Most of them are extremely boring and repetitive. My daughter would watch but with little to no interaction.  I recently brought home Whistlefritz: Vamos a Jugar and was astounded when she started answering questions and singing songs after the first viewing.  This is a full immersion DVD and my daughter is not bilingual.  Whistlefritz arranged the program in such a way that my daughter truly understands what they are saying.  She has now been viewing this DVD on and off for about 3 weeks and is actually using the words throughout her day!  I would highly recommend this DVD over titles such as Boca Beth, Brainy Baby or Plaza Sesamo.  The Spanish to English translations used by Boca Beth only confused my daughter. Brainy Baby won't hold your child's interest much past 12 months and Plaza Sesamo uses far too many slang words and is not a good language learning tool.  My only complaint with Whistlefritz is that the play time is too short.  It is only about 23 minutes long and I felt that once my child was really getting in-to the program it ended.  I think 30 to 40 minutes would be a better running time. Regardless, those 23 minutes are packed with more quality learning than many other programs that run much longer.",1189382400,90,1318,4.666666666666667
2896459,5,B000TESUIG,"My wife and I were always impressed with how my cousin's children had excelled with picking up Spanish as a second language at such a young age.  We were eager to get our son started but did not know where to begin.  My cousin gave us copies of ""Los Animales"" and ""Vamos a Jugar"". He was immediately captivated. My wife and I were amazed at how quickly he seemed to be picking up Spanish while singing along and having fun. It even helped us to remember what we had learned years back in school. As soon as the DVD ends he claps, yells Yeah! and then asks for ""Mo Whitlefrit"".",1185753600,11,576,4.2272727272727275
2896460,5,B000TESUIG,"""Vamos a Jugar"" is an extremely welcome addition to the set of (suprisingly limited) tools available for parents who wish to teach their kids Spanish.  While efforts by shows like ""Dora"" and ""Dragon Tales"" to include Spanish language content are positive, the occasional word or phrase does little beyond letting kids know that other languages exist.  The immersion philosophy behind the Whistlefritz videos is a quantum leap forward.  The genius is in the simplicity of the concept -- take characters, skits, games and songs largely familiar to kids and present them purely in Spanish rather than English, guessing (correctly) that kids will be able to follow the storylines and pick up the vocabulary quickly.  Perhaps just as importantly, the entertainment, novelty and challenge levels are more than high enough to keep our 3 and 5 years olds fully engaged.  ""Los Animales"" (the first video) has been part of the permanent rotation in our DVD player for months with no signs of displacement anytime soon; very happy to see a second video added to the mix and looking forward to more.  Highly recommend this great new product.",1185667200,39,1129,5.043010752688172
2896461,5,B000TESUIG,"Vamos a Jugar (Let's Play):Beginning Spanish for Kids is the second DVD in this series and I believe it is even better than the first one,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Los-Animales-Animals-Spanish-for-Beginners/dp/B000PHG0NY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Los Animales (Animals): Spanish for Beginners</a>&nbsp;as there is more interaction with the kids.  You really can't tell from the cover however it is all done with real people and not animation (and the kids are all cute and very entertaining).  This DVD covers the parts of the body (head, face, hands, knees....) and they even do the song ""Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes"" (in Spanish of course).  It is a wonderful alternative to Dora, Diego or Dragon Tails. It comes with a guide to help with translations.",1184457600,31,809,6.017391304347826
2896462,5,B000TESUIG,Purchased this for my 2 1/2 year old grand-daughter. My daughter is a teacher and had nothing but praise for this teaching video. She is using it to learn right along with her daughter to better serve her Hispanic students needs.,1455840000,,229,4.609756097560975
2896463,5,B000TESUIG,"This is WONDERFUL!!! I am a Spanish teacher. I have two little boys and it is VERY important to me that my children learn Spanish. I was looking for something to buy that they could watch and help to reinforce what we are already doing at home. This is perfect. I love that it's completely in Spanish. Immersion really is the only way to learn a second language. My 3 year old loves this this and often will repeat the words that he knows. He also likes to get up and dance to the songs. As a teacher I can appreciate how this DVD uses multiple learning styles -visual, auditory and kinesthetic. I very highly recommend this (even if you yourself do not speak Spanish. You'll learn along with your child!)",1447977600,4,705,4.3893129770992365

2896466,5,B000TESUIG,My son is now only 5 months old and he will watch this show 3 times in a row before getting bored with it....he absolutely loves the kids in it as he always smiles when they come on....I sing him the songs and he loves it!!!!!!,1428451200,,227,3.9565217391304346

2896469,5,B000TESUIG,Great video! Uses the immersion technique very successfully. It's the only immersion video that has kept my toddler's interest.,1421366400,,127,5.7368421052631575
2896470,5,B000TESUIG,Easy for the kids to sing along and understand. Catchy songs and easy simple phrases/words to remember,1420761600,,102,5.0588235294117645
2896471,5,B000TESUIG,Excellent for non-speakers!,1419465600,,27,8.333333333333334
2896472,4,B000TESUIG,My kids like it but not as much as Adentro y Afuera with Fritzi!,1416960000,,64,3.642857142857143
2896473,5,B000TESUIG,AMAZING! We will be ordered ALL of these!!!,1415923200,,43,4.5
2896474,5,B000TESUIG,My daughter loves it and both of us is learning. It has catchy music... but please don't rely on this alone.,1407715200,,108,4.190476190476191
2896475,4,B000TESUIG,"If you are interested in having your kids learn Spanish, these are the DVDs that can help.  Interesting for the toddlers and not overly annoying for adults.",1406505600,,156,4.777777777777778
2896476,5,B000TESUIG,"Those dvd (vamos a jugar and Adentro y Afuera) are very pleasant to watch even for adults! I am a native spanish speaker, but live in a country where no one else around us speaks spanish and i wanted my kids to have some spanish notions, and those dvds do the job! They love it! Accent is good, Music is really lively!!! I fully recommend them",1395792000,,343,4.212121212121212
2896477,5,B000TESUIG,My kids love whistle fritz.  It is educational and entertaining.  I like that the music was originally written in Spanish rather then awkwardly translated from English (so that the syllables don't match up to the music).,1388102400,,220,5.083333333333333
2896478,3,B000TESUIG,My five year old granddaughter picks up spanish words looking at Dora videos. She even tries to speak to her fellow kindergartners in school. I'm not sure if this video will capture her.,1385683200,,186,4.666666666666667
2896479,5,B000TESUIG,This series is awesome.  All in Spanish but very easy to understand.  My kids love the CD's and interact through the entire video.,1381536000,,130,4.608695652173913
2896480,5,B000TESUIG,I enjoyed these videos; all of the Whistle Fritz movies.  The 'Felix Cumpleanos' video is the best.  This one was really good.,1376611200,,126,4.681818181818182
2896481,4,B000TESUIG,this is just what I wanted for my class. They will learn and have fun at the same time. thank you,1374451200,,97,3.6666666666666665
2896482,5,B000TESUIG,These are very well made and educational.  My daughter enjoys watching them and I like exposing her to another language.,1369526400,,120,5.0
2896483,4,B000TESUIG,"Not as good as Los Animales, but still worthwhile.  Like Los Animales, this DVD is educational and entertaining.  One of the best features of the WhistleFritz series is that each lesson comes with a translation insert.",1369526400,,218,5.027777777777778
2896484,5,B000TESUIG,My 3 year old and 19 month old watch this in the car on our commute and they enjoy it and are learning some solid spanish words.  I will buy all of these dvds.,1364601600,,159,3.676470588235294
2896485,5,B000TESUIG,"My two year old loves watching this video over and over again. It is so fun, even I like watching it. We sing and dance together along with the children on the DVD.  I love that it comes with a booklet with the songs and translations. I Much prefer Whistlefritz to Kids love Spanish. Wish they would do more DVDs with Alphabet, numbers, shapes etc.  Highly recommend it.",1363219200,,370,4.426470588235294
2896486,5,B000TESUIG,"My daughter immediately loved this video! She is 19 months old and even with Spanish being a third language, she was able to follow along just fine and loves to dance to the songs that are played. She loves the puppets and loves to repeat after ""Maria."" Great purchase!",1359417600,,269,4.510204081632653
2896487,5,B000TESUIG,Love that it is all in Spanish. I bought it for my child but I'm learning a lot too. I will buy other DVDs in this series.,1358035200,,122,3.5555555555555554
2896488,5,B000TESUIG,"I wanted to get my 3 year old son learning another language as early as possible, but without knowing any Spanish myself, I went the DVD route. I researched a number of different Spanish for kids educational movies before selecting this one, and I have not been disappointed. This uses immersion as opposed to translation, meaning the entire movie is in Spanish.

""Let's Play"" DVD is the third one of this series we have purchased.  There's a lady named Maria who does most of the talking and interacting with the kids in the video.  The movie connects with kids by introducing a mouse named Fritzi who my son loves!  It's a very entertaining and engaging way to introduce a new language to small children.",1354924800,,706,4.669354838709677
2896489,2,B000TESUIG,"The concept is great.

However, for an english speaking child coming into this at ground zero, it does not seem likely that this approach will be successful based on initial use.",1344816000,,178,4.741935483870968
2896490,5,B000TESUIG,"We all watched this together as a family and tho our 7 year old got bored and walked away, the 5 year old and 3 year old enjoyed it and wanted to watch it again.  It was a good choice as the first step in our family's learning Spanish together.  Eventually we will move beyond this series, but this was a good starting point.

We bought the entire series and this DVD spends a lot of time explaining the various parts of the body and never is a word spoken in English anywhere in this DVD.

I did wish it had subtitles.  It does occasionally show the word spelled on-screen, so there is that at least.

It also includes a few songs to help reinforce what was learned.",1319068800,,667,4.171875
2896491,4,B000TESUIG,"My 3 years old daughter is very much attracted to this DVD.
She likes to dance in front of TV along with the songs played.
I think this is a good DVD to get started in learing Spanish.",1315440000,,184,3.8684210526315788
2896492,2,B000TESUIG,"We got 3 of these DVDs, Maria - the host, will get on your nerves as she is trying to hard to be ""warm and fun"" - it's also very slow. This is a good option for a non bilingual home that is looking to learn Spanish. Too annoying for any native Spanish Speaking home....as it's slow and forced at times. The only good thing is the singer and the songs they feature.",1310601600,3,364,4.0
2896493,5,B000TESUIG,"I have 1 year old twins who were enrolled in a weekly Spanish class when they were 18 months old. I wanted something that I could use at home to continue their exposure to the language outside of the classroom. I have reviewed many programs and this is by far the best. My children would come home each day, point to the TV and say ""mouse"" at 19 months old because they love the series. The Spanish on all of the Whistlefritz DVDs is spoken well (I'm not fluent, but have collegiate-level Spanish III knowledge). I am able to follow along easily and the characters speak clearly and naturally without speaking too fast. I also love the fact that all of the vocabulary is included in the sleeve inside the DVD case. This is a huge plus!

As for the comments about not having subtitles or text in English...if you do research on babies and children learning second and third languages, you'll read that the full immersion method is the preferred method, which Whistlefritz takes full advantage of. I would also like to introduce my children to French and hope that they will start producing videos in other languages.",1300233600,4,1115,4.603015075376884
2896494,5,B000TESUIG,"This DVD is a must-have. The speaker is energetic and she engages children! I am an educator and I have a 1 year old, so needless to say I wanted an educational dvd for my son, and this meets all of my expectations. Whether you are using this as a supplement or as a way of introducing Spanish, it is wonderful to use. It is a lot of fun. My son absolutely loves it and I even laugh at the DVD myself. Definitely worth it and it is such an affordable treasure! Much better than the Brainy Baby and bilingual Baby Series.",1298937600,,520,4.107843137254902
2896495,4,B000TESUIG,"We decided to purchase this DVD in addition to our preschool language program for our four year old. Its only about 25 minutes long of immersion Spanish, which is pretty short for the price. But the lady enunciates very well and its pretty easy to understand what she is talking. The music is catchy and both of my kids (ages four and two) were into it (especially ""Head Shoulders Knees & Toes""). They watch the program and repeated the words and phrases as best they could. Overall, its a good buy, but really helps if you know a little bit of Spanish to begin with.",1297728000,,567,4.40952380952381
2896496,5,B000TESUIG,"I bought this for my 18 month old granddaughter because she is part Hispanic and wanted her to learn some Spanish to impress her other grandparents.  In only a couple of sittings she caught on immediately to the words for face, head and hat.  Although she knows no Spanish this video makes it very easy to understand what is being said.  It is repetitive and keeps her attention rather well.",1293840000,,391,4.557142857142857
2896497,5,B000TESUIG,We have made it a priority to teach our young daughters Spanish and have purchased several kids Spanish DVDs.  The Whistle Fritz DVDs are my favorites and if they make more I will buy them.  I really like that they are just in Spanish. Young children just need exposure to language to learn. I don't like other videos that give directions and definitions in English.  It might be nice for the English speaking parents but the kids don't need it to learn.,1287878400,,454,4.512195121951219
2896498,3,B000TESUIG,"After reading so many of the positive reviews, I was very excited to receive this item. As someone who has extensively studied second language acquisition, I firmly believe that total immersion is the best way for a child to learn a second language. That is the main reason why I bought this video. However, the video itself was way too short (for the price). The video host was pleasant, at first, but then she started to annoy me, as her smile seemed to be permanently plastered on. As for her ""accent"", it's extremely close to being that of a native speaker, but true native speakers will be able to hear a very slight difference. Her accent isn't bad enough to teach incorrect pronunciation, so no worries there (not like those HORRENDOUS ""Kids Love Spanish"" videos).

Bottom line:

Will kids learn some Spanish words with this video? Yes.
Will it keep their attention? Sometimes.
Is it worth the price? No.
Would I buy it again or recommend it? No.",1283731200,4,953,4.666666666666667
2896499,2,B000TESUIG,"Bought for my 2, 4 and 5 year olds. I thought it was a cute video, but the 4 and 5 year old had no interest. They said it was boring and refused to watch it after about 5 minutes. The 2 year old might have watched it if it were not for the influence of her older siblings. I would not recommend for children over 3. I feel like it was a waste of money.",1280793600,4,352,3.6447368421052633
2896500,5,B000TESUIG,"My daughter is a few months shy of 3 years and she loves watching this video.  Although the entire video is in Spanish, it is very easy to understand due to the graphics and repetition.",1265587200,,185,4.285714285714286
2896501,5,B000TESUIG,My 17 month old daughter loves this video. She usually watches it 2 times in a row. If your child likes sesame street videos they will like this one. The only thing that it is missing is more supporting graphics for the words that they are saying otherwise it is fun and educational.,1263340800,,283,4.3584905660377355
2896502,5,B000TESUIG,"My daughter loves this dvd, the kids make her giggle and laugh, and it cements some Spanish vocabulary she already knows.  She is probably learning new vocab also, but I cannot tell yet!  The songs at the end are the same on the cd called A Bailar, so we learn the actions from the dvd and do them when we listen to the cd.  I would recommend the cd as well!",1260921600,,358,4.014084507042254
2896503,1,B000TESUIG,"I recently purchased this CD for my 5 year old daughter. I am not very happy with this purchase. There is no english,spanish translation and the children are at least 7-8 years old not the ages I was expecting for a beginners program. Ithought this would be fun for my daughter but she has no clue what they are even asking her so she can;t participate in the games or singing and dancing:( This CD i good if you already have the basic idea down of spnish but NOT FOR BEGINNERS!!",1253145600,3,479,4.274725274725275
2896504,5,B000TESUIG,"I love this video and, more importantly, so do my two boys (ages 2.5 yrs & 20 mos.) As another reviewer has mentioned, it has a very ""Blue's Clues"" feel- the hostess, Maria, is an actual person, but the background and other characters are cartoons. Maria speaks very clearly and has a very soothing voice. What I like the most is that it is very interactive. Maria asks a lot of situational questions, and the ""audience"" of children answer. For example, after she introduces different article of clothing she'll ask ""does a sock go on my head?"" and the off screen children will yell ""no."" Then she'll ask, ""then what goes on my head?"" and the children will yell ""un sombrero (a hat)."" It's a lot of fun and makes learning Spanish easy. It's by far the best Spanish video I've purchased.",1250899200,8,786,4.542253521126761
2896505,5,B000TESUIG,Since we are teaching my daughter both English and Spanish...I am always n search of tools that will help her learn more Spanish.  She's 14 months old and enjoys the video.  She now says many of the words and loves the little songs.  We will be buying the other video from this company.  The length is just about the right amount of time.  (Approx. 25 minutes),1239062400,2,360,4.393939393939394
2896506,5,B000TESUIG,"I really like this DVD.  It is very interesting.  It uses alot of puppets and engaging songs.  It is completely in Spanish, but it does come with a guide that translates the words and phrases used in the DVD. Also, it is repetitive enough to help you learn the words but not so repetitive that it gets boring.",1236124800,,309,4.293103448275862
2896507,4,B000TESUIG,"I chose this Whistlefritz video because it was priced less than the Little Pim series. I have a 4-year-old daughter who watches Dora the Explorer and talks in her own spanish made-up language, so I wanted to try this out first.

Talk about language immersion! Whistlefritz is completely in Spanish, with no english subtitles or spoken words at all.  This is great.  Kids learn through complete immersion.  My 4-year-old and 2-year-old girls are totally captivated by this video and have started saying a few words in spanish.  Yay!",1232236800,4,531,4.988636363636363
2896508,5,B000TESUIG,"My first language is Spanish and my husband only speaks English. It is VERY important to me that my baby learns Spanish. I bought Vamos a Jugar, Los Animales and the Vamos a Bailar CD for my 20 month old baby. I also have 2 Cantarima DVDs, Brainy Baby Spanish and 123 Cuentame un Cuento.  The Whistlefritz DVDs and music CD are BY FAR THE BEST ONES. They are wonderful to watch, even for us parents. They are extremely well produced. Every moment is filled with words and lessons. No time is wasted on useless images. And there are no mistakes, at least that I have noticed. All the participants appear to be native speakers. These are full immersion productions, which in my opinion is the only way a child or adult will learn the language. My baby loves to watch the DVDs and requests them every day. She is starting to say some of the words and imitates Maria's dances. She also loves to play the music CD.  All the songs are wonderful and I have not gotten tired of them at all.  I highly recommend that you purchase this collection for your children and other friends that might be looking for DVDs/CDs in Spanish for their children. I wish I would have bought these a long time ago! Los disfrutaran mucho!",1231804800,15,1211,4.42152466367713

We want our 13 month old son to be bilingual, but we do not live close to any of my husbands family so it is hard with just him speaking spanish.  These videos are great!  I am even learning because they make it very obvious without translation what they are talking about.  The video is a little short, but so is my 13 month old's attention span so it's okay.  He watches the video contently the entire time and sometimes I can play it again about half way through.  Love this one and the other one by the same company.",1227657600,,557,4.111111111111111

2896511,5,B000TESUIG,"The whole family watches this video and learns spanish.  Even though sometimes it seems low-budget, it is fantastic at teaching basic spanish.  I wish they made more videos.  We also own the ""Los Animales"" video which is good too.",1218758400,,230,4.846153846153846
2896512,3,B000TESUIG,"I was so excited to see all the positive reviews on this product, but once I saw the video I was dissapointed. The effort is OK. Overall not very exciting for my 2 year old - she looks like she is falling asleep while watching it.  The songs are very plain and boring to me. I recommend Susy Dorn's series instead.",1217721600,,314,4.147540983606557
2896513,5,B000TESUIG,"I bought this DVD and their other one, Los Animales for my 2-year old grandson. He loves it! and he is learning fast. When his father gets home from work, Joaquin brings him the DVDs and tell him ""Daddy, 'paol"" meaning, Daddy, Spanish, and he sits in front of the TV mesmerized and going along with the teacher. Yesterday, he dropped his pacifier, picked it up and told his father ""lavalo"" (wash it).  We are delighted with how much he learns as well as with the quality of the product itself. Hope they make more!!!",1207699200,6,516,4.431578947368421
2896514,5,B000TESUIG,I bought this video a while ago and my 3 yr old son still loves it.  I like that it's entirely in Spanish and that it is not very long (about 20 minutes)as he gets bored with videos quickly.  The narrator is also fun and the words are repeated several times with a lot of different picture examples.,1207699200,,299,4.137931034482759
2896515,5,B000TESUIG,"I bought this video along with a few other Spanish videos.  Neither my husband nor I speak Spanish, but I realize how important it is in today's world.  My 18-month old had never sat through an entire video without losing interest, but this one did it!  He sat through the whole thing and even got up to dance during the songs.  I highly recommend this video!",1206057600,2,359,4.393939393939394
2896516,4,B000TESUIG,"We have both Whistlefritz DVDs and my 16 month old loves them both.  Los Animales is his favorite, but he also enjoys this DVD which teaches him the parts of his body in Spanish.  The teacher on the DVD is great, the children are really cute and this DVD has some dancing which my son always loves.  Both Whistlefritz DVDs are well made and very educational.  A great choice for Spanish immersion for your child.",1203033600,,412,4.453333333333333
2896517,4,B000TESUIG,"I'm not big on TV teaching - I like to do things with my children face to face, rather than looking at a screen.... So, I'm a bit biased. But some of my students' parents asked me to review this DVD. First, I agree, for the money, it's quite short. The good points are - excellent pronunciation, clear audio, and professional movie-type  video. It reminds me of the Baby Einstein Series - high quality. Our children for the most part sat through it and tried to sing a long.

The bad parts - the actual words and phrases that are learned a not very numerous. My children (6, 4, 3, and the baby, 14 months) all knew these words already, but I did like that they were learning in a different format, even if it was review.  Did they enjoy it? Yes. Will they watch it again? I can't get them to. I'd like the 3 year old to watch more, as she could really learn some more from it, but she refuses. Motivation is REALLY important when learning a second language, so I don't force it.

For an introduction, I think it's a good product! If your kids are happy to watch DVD's, this is a good idea, well-executed. I would definitely supplement with other types of learning though.

2896518,5,B000TESUIG,"All of my children (5,3,2)love it.  My youngest (2) loves to dance around to it.  The songs are fun to follow and makes learning spanish fun.",1202428800,,141,4.384615384615385
2896519,5,B000TESUIG,"The first time my 2 yr old watched this he immitated the movements associated with the song ""Cabeza, hombros, rodillos y piez."" This DVD (and it's partner ""Animales"") are essential to really exposing children to the Spanish language. Another series (Kids Love Spanish) is good for basic vocab. ""Vamos a jugar"" immerses the child in the language, understanding that context and repetition aid learning. The narrator (Maria) is wonderfully engaging and the puppets are quaint. I sincerely hope Whistlefritz will make more (SOON!), as my Spanish is limited to what I didn't learn in high school (my fault, Senora Gershon!).",1200009600,,620,5.21
2896520,5,B000TESUIG,"Our kids, ages 4 and 6, love this DVD.  The kids love the songs which are very catchy and fun.  The all Spanish format has also been very effective and the kids have picked up lots of new Spanish words.  Great video!",1197676800,,216,4.095238095238095
2896521,2,B000TESUIG,"I was excited to view this DVD based on the reviews, but it did not quite live up to expectations. I saw it together with my 4-year old and it did not hold his attention. The format consists of a narrator/teacher who speaks entirely in Spanish. She uses hand gestures and puppets to illustrate the Spanish words. This becomes somewhat repetitive after a while.  The narrator was remarkably unremarkable, which may be good in that she doesn't detract from the lessons. Now for the not-so-good. Every so often a song pops up. Unfortunately the songs did not add to the video as they were reminiscent of old cowboy tunes. The accompanying ""booklet"" was a single fold-out with the words and phrases taught in the DVD.  It would have been more useful if it were better structured with some explanation. Finally, I was surprised that the DVD only ran 20 - 21 minutes as I had expected more for the price.",1196121600,23,898,4.60625

8208678,5,B000TESUIG,Great for dual immersion learners.  I have a kindergarten and 3rd grader both in Spanish 90/10 programs.  The teachers agree this is a great tool to help in addition to their classroom learning!  And bonus the boys love the video!,1481328000,,230,4.7
8208679,5,B000TESUIG,This is the best for kids.  My kids are already saying word and singing some of the songs.  It really captures their attention and only speaks in Spanish.  I will definitely order the other dvds they make.,1481068800,,205,4.486486486486487
8208680,1,B000TESUIG,"Complete garbage. I bought because my 3 year old son sneaks out of his room in the very early AM and gets into things he shouldn't. I put this on his door to alert me when he opened it. The alarm woke me at 3 am the first night and I went up to find him sound asleep...it turned out that the smaller piece fell off the door and had gone between the spindles on second floor railing and landed downstairs. Apparently the fall 1 story into carpet knocked something loose inside so that the unit could no longer be turned off. Now, the only way to get the siren off was to pull out batteries. I was going to give it another chance, because two units came in the package. I realize the one that fell off could have been screwed on, so I thought I'd try again and screw it fast to prevent falling again. By the end of the day, the larger party of the unit also fell off the door. That piece cannot be screwed on. So at this point, I haven't even bothered to try the second unit. What good is it if it's just going to fall off? Not to mention, I dislike having it wake my family at night for no reason.

Cheaply made garbage as far as I'm concerned.",1470268800,,1143,4.035242290748899

8208682,5,B000TESUIG,"I recommend this, and all Whistlefritz videos, to anyone wanting to learn Spanish. Whistlefritz videos are literally the only videos we let our 2 year old watch. I can speak enough Spanish to get by in a Spanish speaking country and these videos are helpful for me as well. Our 2 year old loves watching Wistlefritz and can already understand a LOT of Spanish.",1462752000,,360,4.640625
8208683,2,B000TESUIG,"Good for either pre verbal kids or children who have taken a few weeks of beginner Spanish, but if just watched without any knowledge of Spanish it would be frustrating and difficult to pick up. I like that it mimics natural / native language acquisition techniques but it certainly difficult for my child to decipher at times. I speak Spaniah at an average 2nd grader level so I can explain it to him.",1462665600,,402,4.52054794520548
