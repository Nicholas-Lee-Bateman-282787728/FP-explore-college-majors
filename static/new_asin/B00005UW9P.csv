7955681,5,B00005UW9P,"Truly fantastic TROMA!  Great statements about the corrupt media, idiotic war on drugs, and war in general.  Endless nudity and gore.  Everything you could want from TROMA in 5 episodes of the UK series as well as extras that were 'Too Hot For T.V.'! As well as bonus material.  No one is safe in this collection, especially Princess Die.",1324771200,,338,4.677966101694915
7955682,1,B00005UW9P,"I enjoy camp and excess as much as the next person, unless the next person had anything to do with this release.  This is mearly an excuse for the Troma team, which has made some entertaining movies, to be social critics and show some naked women on tv.  Very poorly done, don't waste your time.",1032652800,,295,4.345454545454546
7955683,4,B00005UW9P,"Troma's edge Tv was a series created by the modern geniuses down there at Troma studio for UK television. I had never heard of the show before a friend, from the UK, brought this DVD over one day.
The DVD has a few episodes including the 'too hot' sex episode as well as epsidoes dealing with other important issues like drugs, war and horror in a typical Troma way. They are all totally hilarious and often make truely serious points mixed in with all the fun.
The hosts on the show include Tiffany Shepis as super Tromette Bullemia, Trent Haaga who contains in himself the personality and energy of more than a dozen game show hosts and Debbie Rochon who is unbelievably funny and sexy at the same time in the horror episode. It has to seen to be believed she's so cool. But even with this talented cast of hosts, I still dig Lloyd Kaufman's bits the most, that guy is so damn funny.
After seeing this DVD I feel tottally cheated that it never came onto TV here. But at least we can see some of this great show on the DVD. And as usual there is countless extra's included.",1025222400,3,1074,4.321782178217822
