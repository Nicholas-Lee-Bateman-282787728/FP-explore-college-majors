8726092,5,B012E66NIK,"I have been using this programme for a week, and I can't say enough good things about it.  It is important to note that it is a combination of yoga and exercise- if you are expecting modified yoga, you will be disappointed.

Having said that, I am very impressed with the programme.  In total, it is a bit long for a time-crunched mother of three, but when broken down into the warm-up, two areas to concentrate on, and the cool-down, it is very doable.  When done, I feel that I have had a complete work out without feeling sore or exhausted.  I can see changes already, and my posture, which was awful to begin with, is improving rapidly.  The directions are clear, but it would help to watch the sections carefully, as there are minor moves that aren't articulated by the orator.

My chiropractor, who was leery of my starting yoga in the first place, loves this programme.  He is 100% behind my doing Yogalign, especially so because I have some spinal issues that make traditional yoga painful to downright harmful.  He particularly loves her emphasis on building up the muscles around the rib cage, not the typical promotion of the six-pack.  (He thinks she was either a chiropractor or studied chiropractic methods.)

I truly feel that one can't go wrong with this programme.  If you like yoga, but find some of the moves painful or nearly impossible, give this DVD a try.  As mentioned above, it isn't traditional yoga, so if you are a purist, you won't like it, but the rest of us that want to get a thorough workout without pain or mobility issues, this is the way to go.",1503532800,5,1580,4.540636042402827

8726095,5,B012E66NIK,YogAlign DVD is an amazingly easy program to follow. From my first viewing/ practice my entire body felt better and low back pain disappeared with only some minor sensation in my right buttock.  I'm hooked and love the beauty of the Hanalei Bay background!  Thank you Michaelle for your grasp of how the body and breath work when truly aligned.,1476403200,4,344,4.716666666666667

8726098,5,B012E66NIK,"I purchased this DVD from the Yogalign website.  I came upon the Yogalign method after taking yoga classes at a local studio and researching if some of the poses were safe for me to do (fish pose, plow pose, shoulder stand, camel, etc). Something just didn't feel right in my body while practicing those questionable poses and I did some online research which confirmed my suspicions that if you are are not naturally super flexible then contorting yourself into uncomfortable poses might be of no benefit and may cause injury.  After about a month of Yogalign practice two or three times a week this yoga method helped to relieve an upper backache I couldn't seem to get rid of. The poses are not difficult nor uncomfortable since they honor the natural curves of the human body. I do feel taller and lighter after the practice. It's a good long practice and there is the option to select segments to practice if you can't do the whole workout. The voice over instructions are clear and the beach setting is beautiful along with some funny characters in the background!.  As a woman about to celebrate her 50th birthday I plan to continue Yogalign to improve my posture and stay flexible.",1457568000,10,1189,4.706730769230769
8726099,5,B012E66NIK,Beautifully produced workout.  Very clear instruction and easy to follow along to.  Would love to see a Volume 2!,1444608000,3,113,4.894736842105263
