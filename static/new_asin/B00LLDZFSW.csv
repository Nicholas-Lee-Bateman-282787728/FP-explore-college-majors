8666363,5,B00LLDZFSW,"This set of four Blu-ray disks is intended to be part one of a complete set of the Bruno Monsaingeon films about Menuhin. The ones on this disc span films made between 1979 and 1994. The set opens with a documentary in the form of an illustrated interview with the violinist made in 1994. There are several concert films made in Moscow between 1987 and 1989. There is a performance of the Four Seasons recorded on 1979 at the Yehudi Menuhin School, a concert in Leipzig from 1982 and a further interview with the director, Bruno Monsaingeon. There are two final performance films directed by others from 1977 and an unknown date.

The opening disc features the 155 minute extended interview made in 1994 between Menuhin and Monsaingeon at Menuhin's Greek home. During this, in the format of a series of chapter headings, Menuhin discusses the whole of his life from the earliest times before he became famous as a child prodigy until the end of his performing life. He describes family relationships in detail, his wartime experiences as a touring and performing soloist for the allied troops, and a wide range of career performing experiences. These go on to include playing in Germany with Furtwangler as a Jew which led to inevitable racial conflicts between those observing and commenting around the world.

The documentary goes on to cover his extensive Russian experiences as well as his activities as an early example of cross-over music making including Hungarian gypsy music, jazz with Ellington and Indian music with Ravi Shankar. His relationship with Bartok and his music is also emphasised. Throughout this film there are copious examples of his playing with an emphasis on the late 1940's but stretching either side of that decade. This leads to observations and comments about various other musicians that Menuhin was involved including conductors and chamber musicians. This proves to be an informative and engrossing film that places recent recollections of Menuhin firmly in the context of the rest of his previous life. It was previously shown on the BBC.

Disc two is devoted to Menuhin's Russian experiences and starts with a 53 minute film entitled First Episode during which rehearsal and performance sequences and conversations are followed between the violinist and the conductor, Rozhdestvensky. These conversations revolve around music and reminiscences involving Russian connections. Later on the disc there is a follow-up documentary entitled Second Episode which centres on his musical partnership with pianist Viktoria Postnikova. This incorporates further rehearsal and performance sequences plus reminiscences and observations including an amusing incident with a too-small en-suite toilet which required some dexterity from the visitor! This is very much a sequel to the previous film.

In addition to these two documentaries there are complete concerts given in Russia with the main works being the Bach Concerto for 3 violins with Igor and Valery Oistrakh, the Beethoven concerto, Bach's Partita in E, Brahms 2nd sonata, Bartok's 1st Sonata and Beethoven's 7th sonata. The whole of disc 2 was recorded in Russia in 1987 and both the stereo sound and the colour film is of a surprisingly good standard given its date and provenance. All the films were originally copyrighted by Erato but the quality demonstrates successful re-mastering for the Blu-ray edition.

Disc 3 commences with a 52 minute documentary focussing on Menuhin as a conductor and rehearsing Beethoven's Piano concerto 1 with Jeremy, his son, as soloist. Also featured is rehearsal footage of Tchaikovsky symphony 6. Once more there are reminiscences including references to the Oistrakh family with supportive archive film material. Reminiscences include generalisations about the Russian character as he perceived it and which is described as being essentially extreme in its emotional responses to various stimuli.

The film concludes with his companions documentation been taken for scrutiny by police which leaves various questions unanswered. The rest of the disc consists of complete concert footage of the complete Beethoven Piano Concerto 1 and Tchaikovsky 6 as seen in rehearsal. Those performances are followed by Brahms Sonata 2 and Mozart Sonata Op. 78, both accompanied by Viktoria Postnikova, plus Tchaikovsky's Trio with Menuhin, Postnikova and Marc Coppey on `cello. These are in re-mastered condition as before and, as before, have clearly benefited from this. The whole of this disc dates from 1987-1989 and was originally copyrighted by Erato.

The final 4th disc starts with a performance of the Vivaldi 4 Seasons from 1979 with the Menuhin Scholl Orchestra. We also see the Brahms violin concerto, recorded in 1982, with the Leipzig Gewandhaus under Masur. The disc ultimately concludes with an uncredited recording of the Elgar concerto 3rd movement before which the Bartok Duos are heard on a recording made by Menuhin and Monsaingeon in 1977. Before those last two items there is a final full length interview / documentary during which Bruce Monsaingeon explains the length and course of his admiration for Menuhin and his reasons for this.

Monsaingeon's first encounter with Menuhin's playing was through a recording made by Menuhin as a child. This was followed by attending a concert in 1957 and then by enrolling in Menuhin's Master class in 1962. He immediately established a close link with Menuhin which developed over the years and, in the context of this Blu-ray set, this culminated in his coverage of Menuhin's Russian engagements. Throughout Monsaingeon stresses Menuhin's ability to connect with all those around him. He believes that this was facilitated by Menuhin's wide repertoire and willingness to travel widely all over the world giving performances to both large and small audiences. This film was created as recognition of the scope of Monsaingeon's enormous filmed library but there can be no doubt that he feels that his work with Menuhin represents the pinnacle of his musical experiences. This is a very interesting 57 minute film with much detail provided and makes a very suitable summary of this boxed set.

No attempt has been made to comment upon the actual qualities of the musical performances in this set. There can be no doubt about Menuhin's remarkable prowess as a child prodigy and this prowess continued to develop up to the war. At this point Menuhin explains how his concert schedule made practise impossible and one can see how this would affect his technical delivery which became a subject of concern as time passed. These discs do not explore that situation other than to give plenty of examples of Menuhin in rehearsal and concert which will give plenty of food for thought for purchasers.

This generous first instalment of Monsaingeon's complete coverage of Menuhin will therefore be very tempting proposition for admirers of Yehudi Menuhin.",1415577600,2,6919,5.247739602169982
