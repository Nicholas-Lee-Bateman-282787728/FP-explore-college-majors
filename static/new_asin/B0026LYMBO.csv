I was a little confused by the fact that the lebensborn girls seemed to leave after the birthing process.  I had thought that lebensborn women simply waited for the next shipment of soldiers to arrive.  I found the ""Nazi ring ceremony"" and ""Nazi communion"" to be particularly interesting.",1469404800,,373,4.873015873015873
8353117,4,B0026LYMBO,"This Czech film tells part of the story of the Nazi's programme known as `Lebensborn'. This was a system whereby natural authorised and certificated women of Aryan purity were chosen to go to special schools where they were matched with a pure Aryan hero of the Master Race for the sole reason of reproduction. The babies of this union were to be raised to continue the Thousand year Reich.

In the film we meet Gretka who is a Czech from the Sudetenland - she is chosen and sent off to one such place. There she is at first honoured and amused by all the attention. Then she meets a local Jew who is being held as a hostage by the Nazi's and treated like a dog. Through his suffering and the ever more intransigent attitudes of her teachers - and alleged betters - she decides to rebel.

This is all based on true events, it will have you reaching for the tissues too as anything dealing with babies and war is bound to be a tear jerker. This was a made for TV production in 2000 and the quality of the production belies its humble origins. In Czech and German with very good sub titles this is one for all followers of World War II films in all of their guises.",1420848000,2,1163,4.257918552036199
8353118,4,B0026LYMBO,"Fans of Nazisploitation will probably be somewhat disappointed with this film, as there are none of the standard sleaziod cliches inherent in such flix, but as a WW2 film based on true facts, it's a fascinating view into the workings of Nazi politics before the Great War. What helps are the great featurettes that are included, giving us an even greater understanding and insight into the concept of creating a 'Master Race'.

Based on little-known historical events, 'Spring Of Life' is a disturbing drama about a young girl named Gretka, who was taken away from her family and selected to attend an elite school run by pre-war Nazis to participate in Lebensborn, a mad Nazi concept to create a pure Aryan race. It is only when eager young SS officers arrive at this 'spa' that she discovers the sinister truth, that she is being groomed as part of a breeding program to further Aryan lineage.

Well told and directed, it presents a sobering picture of actual events absent from the usual nazisploitation films that center around torture, nude showers, and the concept of 'Joy Division', another true saga involving SS officers ravaging prisoners to blow off sexual steam, which is what most of these films are centered around (not that I object, I'm a fan of exploitation). For fans of WW2 and military history, it's a treasure, for sleazemeisters, it's a waste of both your time and possible short-attention span",1272326400,4,1416,4.895833333333333
