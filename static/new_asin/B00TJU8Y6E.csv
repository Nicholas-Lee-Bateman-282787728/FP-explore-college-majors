""Act of Violence"" is a seminal piece of film noir.... coming on the heels of WWII, it capitalized on the negative undertow of resentment carried by some veterans in the wake of that war, but the gritty bitterness of the film failed to resonate at the box office.

This is a film about guilt and vengeance.  Van Heflin plays Frank Enley, a successful young Los Angeles area building contractor, starting a family with his wife Edith (played by a very young Janet Leigh).  Building new subdivisions in the suburbs, Frank seems to embody the forward-looking spirit of the post-war era.  However, he is hiding a troubled past, and it catches up to him in the form of his nemesis, Joe Parkson, played by Robert Ryan.  Parkson arrives in ""Santa Lisa"" on a mission to kill his ex-war buddy, whom he blames for a failed POW escape attempt in Germany.

Joe Parkson, in the hands of director Fred Zinnemann, seems to be demonically possessed.  He drags a wounded leg with a wheezing sound,  summoning monster movie associations.  The movie creates enormous tension by pitting this possible lunatic against a protagonist who is undermined by huge flaws.  The audience doesn't know whether to root for the man seeking retribution, or the victim who seems too weak in character to defend himself.

As Heflin's character reels helplessly in his predicament, he's taken in by a 'lady of the night' portrayed by Mary Astor in a minor role.  She steers Frank Enley further into peril by hooking him up with grifters who want to provide an answer to his dilemma---a hired assassin to take out the stalker Parkson.  In the meantime, Parkson's girlfriend ""Ann"" has arrived from New York to try to dissuade him from achieving his murderous aim.

Director Zinneman  handles all the plot angles ingeniously, and the Los Angeles location shots are also a treat.  One of the bonuses of the movie is that viewers will be reminded of many other movie associations that came later.  Gregory Peck was slated for the Van Heflin role, and later Peck would star in the similarly themed ""Cape Fear"" against Robert Mitchum's vengeful character.  Van Heflin would soon play another flawed hero who enlists a hired gun in the classic western ""Shane"".  Janet Leigh was the mother of Jamie Leigh Curtis, who decades later would star in the same LA suburbs in ""Halloween"".  ""Halloween"" supposedly was set in Illlinois, but obviously was shot in California, and again featured a relentless, vengeful pursuer, this time named ""Jason"".  There are also some ways that ""Act of Violence"" merits comparisons to other classic films like ""Chinatown"", ""The Verdict"", and ""No Country for Old Men"".

All of that makes me think that ""Act of Violence"" has not been properly credited with due significance as the landmark movie which it undoubtedly was.",1516579200,,2931,4.862903225806452
