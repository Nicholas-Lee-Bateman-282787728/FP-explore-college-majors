8550403,3,B00AEE67IG,"This tape had a few good tips, but not work the money spent.  They actually cut away when horse was acting up and came back when the horse was behaving better.  Would have liked to have seen how they solved those issues.",1399507200,5,220,4.214285714285714

8550405,4,B00AEE67IG,"I've been reading about this gal for a long time, finally purchased one of her vids was pleased from the outset..lots of interesting stuff and the Buddy horse is in for it..went out yesterday (with some carrots in a bucket)to tell him to expect to work today..this guy is my first quarter horse, I've mostly had thoroughbreds that I would have liked to see Diana tackle..because a pro's reaction to a difficult horse is worth it's weight.  I'm pleased with this product and will buy again...especially if I knew that she was dealing with difficult cases.
Cheers K",1357084800,,563,4.744897959183674
8550406,4,B00AEE67IG,I thought the training video was very informative. I watched it through and was able to pick up a few pointers. Diana explained things pretty well. You could see the horse had been worked with before the video was made. I was hoping she would be working with a green horse as that is where I think the most important things are learned.
