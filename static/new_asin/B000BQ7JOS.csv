8090963,3,B000BQ7JOS,"Honestly, I was expecting more from Smokey. He is a legend, after all. There are better videos of him on youtube that were not included on this DVD. Worth watching if you're a big a Smokey fan, or want to see what the owner of a multimillion dollar tuning company does for fun. He has big balls, and plenty of skills. He's a bit on the batty side, and is an interesting character - he looks like the should be pushing paper in a mid-management position... He's quite shy, yet he does some of the most insane stuff you'll ever see on the street. This - [...] is a perfect example of how insane he is, or maybe this (Just to show you what the Mid Night Club was all about) - [...]. I enjoyed the video but was hoping for more high speed clips and less downtime. Considering how cheap it is, I recommend it to any street racing enthusiast.",1264809600,,836,4.198757763975156
8090964,4,B000BQ7JOS,"Chapter 1: Smokey's Lady Friend
""Smokey's lady friend handles the boost from the cockpit, what a pimp.""
This is a great gem of bizarre Japanese TV.  I do not think that Japanese TV is really that bizarre but when you add some weird American English commentary, thinks get weirder for sure.  The commentator on this special edition is amazing.  He say things like, ""One think is for sure, sheep do not like big burnouts.""  Maybe the original language narration said this but when the English announcer talks, everyone laughs.  Also, I have no friends that are into cars, or into cars that go 200 mph.  It is kind of like being into Black Metal.  People will act like they like that kind of thing but they just think it is cool to think it is cool.  However, I have an actual problem where I am really into cars from before the Fast and the Furious made it kind of cool and after that wears off.  My point is, out of all the Option and Best Motoring videos, this one gets the biggest laughs from Art Students to my cyclist friends that act like cars are the devil (until the have to use one...i.e. mine).  This video has hot footage of over the top speed runs AND it is campy enough to show friends.  I highly recommend it.",1251244800,,1221,4.334801762114537
8090965,3,B000BQ7JOS,"interesting to see exotic cars but it needs more actions, and/or more details about the mods of the cars. This type of tapes are meant for car  buffs, right? I didn't quite get that sense after watching it.",1191196800,,206,4.421052631578948
8090966,3,B000BQ7JOS,"it has some good footage and clips,but it could of been better, to much talk and not soo many real tips of what the cars have,works and trouble of them.",1175040000,,152,4.1
