3798217,5,B001UFCNI6,"Ed and I are from this era of music. When I met Ed in 1970, his theme song was ""Them Changes"" by Buddy Miles. At the live musical show in San Diego in Sept 2007, Ed talked to Buddy and asked him to autograph a picture of Buddy and Jimi Hendrix. We loved the whole musical production with Strawberry Alarm Clock, Peter & Gordon, Eric Johnson (who played Jimi's songs), and Vince Martell from Vanilla Fudge along with his wife, Peg Pearl. Of course, Ben Vereen ,as MC, stole the show with his costumes, wit and singing. As Ed said to me while I am writing this review: ""Seeing the musicians and hearing the music from 1967's Summer of Love made us feel young again!"" So now we have the DVD to share with friends and to play over and over again when we want to remember how much fun it was to be part of the ""Peace, Love, Tune In, Turn On, and Rock Out"" generation. You will truly love this DVD. Ed & Peggy Sanchez",1236988800,2,911,4.1525423728813555
3798218,5,B001UFCNI6,I was fortunate enough to have attended one of shows and was blown away by the line up the producers were able to put together to highlight this amazing period in history and music. This is truly an amazing collection of performers.,1236988800,,232,4.5476190476190474
8343515,5,B001UFCNI6,"They filmed this over several nights. To see this live was amazing, to work on this project, sublime. Ben was amazing as well as the rest of the performers. Sadly Buddy's last live show, blessed to be part of it in some small way.",1389830400,,230,4.25
8343516,1,B001UFCNI6,This sucks big time. Let's see....Do i want to pay almost $20 for a DVD where every song is interrupted with someone's thoughts about the song.....HELL NO!...Don't buy this DVD. This is a big F...... disappointment.....Why didn't someone warn me?,1277164800,2,246,5.175
8343517,5,B001UFCNI6,"Terrific trip back to the 60's, with great music and put together in a reflective way, intermingling music and interviews.  I recommend it most highly.",1245801600,,151,5.04
8343518,5,B001UFCNI6,"This DVD really captured some of the true essence of the 60's.  The performances were all solid and it is amazing to see where many of our musical roots came from.  Most of the songs helped define that ""Summer of Love"" and for guitar players it is a must see. It is fascinating hearing the performers describe what it was like during this period.  I saw Jimi Hendrix in 1968 at Swing Auditorium in Riverside California. Eric Johnson's performance of ""All Along the Watch Tower"" was so masterful and dead on, that if I closed my eyes I thought I was in the presence of Hendrix again. No other performer has ever covered Jimi so flawlessly.  His guitar tone was amazing.  A real treat in surround sound.

8343519,5,B001UFCNI6,"A beautifully produced and presented flashback of the era of my teen aged years. enjoyed every performance....some even more than when they were originally released.  a little grey hair and a few additional belt sizes later, this is still great music.",1241308800,2,251,5.121951219512195
8343520,5,B001UFCNI6,"I was lucky enough to see this concert live. The producers put together a group of terrific musicians and music from the peace movement of the 1960s.

The final mix in this DVD is incredible and includes the last performance of the late Buddy Miles (Jimi Hendrix's drummer).

This DVD is a collector's must.

8343521,5,B001UFCNI6,"Seeing the live version of  ""Love-In""  was an experience I will not soon forget. Very glad the DVD is now available for purchase at Amazon. The smorgasbord of great music that came from this sliver of time still echoes loudly for all future generations.  This would make a perfect gift for anyone that grew up in the 60's and 70's...or someone that wants to learn about the great time they missed. My personal fave performances are (in no particular order) Eric Johnson doing Hendrix & Cream, Vince Martell & Peg Pearl knocking the house down with their version of Sonny & Cher classic ""Bang, Bang"", you've have got to love Strawberry Alarm Clock still putting out pure joy with ""Incense & Peppermint"", and Peter & Gordon are spot on.  Plus, the audio quality is not to be believed.  So put something in your pipe, pour a glass of wine, and slip the DVD in...then it's time to Tune In, Turn On, and Drop Out.",1237334400,2,908,4.512195121951219
8343522,5,B001UFCNI6,"I was lucky enough to go to this concert while it was being taped. I also saw a screening of the dvd and was happy to find that the final mix on the dvd was even better than the live mix I heard in person. All acts sounded as good or better than they did back in the day(late 60's) at the 2007 live performance. The final mix will knock your socks off. It's a very touching tribute to ""Peace Music"".",1237161600,2,399,3.9382716049382718
8343523,5,B001UFCNI6,"The music documentarians of ""Love In"" just keep getting better and better with every new production. What a great musical experience. I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. This music documentary and their prior production, ""Primal Twang,"" are an absolute must have for any guitar player or aspiring guitar player. This DVD preserves the very best of what could well be the greatest era of rock and roll music ever. This DVD will become more and more valuable as the featured musicians pass on. The best of their work will be preserved on this DVD for us and for future generations.",1237161600,2,574,4.808080808080808
8343524,5,B001UFCNI6,This was an impressive and moving show!  There is so much excellent music; all of the hits from this era are included.  There are parts where I was singing along.  Ben Vereen is amazing as usual.  This DVD is a must have for anyone who grew up in the 60's!,1236988800,,256,4.06
