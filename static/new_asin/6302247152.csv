440598,5,6302247152,"While many people know this film from it being used by MST3K, the fact is that the story is a good one, based on the short story by the same name by John Varley.  Raul Julia plays a man named Fingal, a button pusher who is getting bored with doing nothing but helping the computers crunch numbers.  After he is caught watching ""Casablanca"" he is sent to spend some time as a animal, to help calm him.
But they lose his body and things get weird.
Raul Julia, Linda Griffiths and many of the other people in this made-for-PBS movie do a very good job with their characters.  The settings, the special effects, the use of nature films and everything else reminds me of a mixture of Dr. WHO? and somebody's college film.  BUT that doesn't hurt it.  It, in fact, gives it a interesting, unique feel that you don't get from most sci-fi films.
It is worth it if you can get it used.
Interesting note: the people at MST3K felt guilty about using this film for their show as they respect the work of the late Raul Julia.",1056067200,5,1011,4.3
440599,3,6302247152,"The late Raul Julia was a scene chewer, no doubt about it.  An effort of Julia's in the 1980s, Overdrawn at the Memory Bank is one of those small films that always gets ragged on because the production value was so low the sets and special effects don't stand up to what we are quite used to seeing even on TV these days.
But that doesn't make the film unwatchable.  The story is by John Varley, who envisioned a time when corporations rule the planet planning everything from the weather to our lives.  There is a veiled message in the story, but don't worry about it.  Instead, let the playfulness of the tale draw you in and the true chemistry between Julia and Linda Griffiths will take care of the rest.
 (spoiler) So, it isn't Kiss Of The Spiderwoman.  It isn't Street Fighter either!  This has a lot of heart and charm showing through and is well worth watching.",1005696000,2,869,4.427672955974843
440600,4,6302247152,"The previous reviewer's criticisms are reasonable. The  explanations offered for the cyber antics are of no help, and hacking is depicted as nothing more than guessing a password. But there are a few laughs, and satire of a future corporate hegemony. The intrusion and blending of realities is done with a surrealistic touch that I appreciated. In particular, there is one scene that makes the whole movie worth watching. Aram Fingal (Raul Julia) is stranded in cyber space and causing the corporation trouble. Appolonia James (Linda Griffiths) is instructed to appear to him and win his obedience.  She breaks into a Casablanca scene, descending from the sky on a clam shell as in the famous Botticelli painting ""The Birth of Venus"" (but with no nudity). I have watched this scene over and over, and it is definitely low tech - framed by double exposed images of foliage and a choir. Still the beauty of Linda Griffiths, the lighting and music, and the way reality is parted revealing another, produce a remarkable effect. For a moment you are in the presence of a real Goddess, even though the whole scene is intended as a gag. Give it a chance and maybe you will get lucky also.",1001376000,,1181,4.7560975609756095
440601,1,6302247152,"Raul Julia is a great actor, but even he can't redeem Overdrawn at the Memory Bank. Apparently WNET was very proud of it, as they plasted their name in much larger type than the rest of the credits right at the beginning. Think about that the next time they try to guilt you into paying 100 dollars for Riverdance.
The story is basically 1984 gone horribly wrong. Raul Julia gets busted for watching Casablanca on company time, and his mind is put into a baboon for reasons the writers choose not to divulge, just as we never find out why it is illegal to watch movies. He escapes just as the baboon is killed and turns the world into Casablanca, with himself as Rick, the woman monitering him as Ilsa, and the evil ruler of the world as the fat man. If it sounds stupid, that's because it is. Also, the story gets very hard to follow, and by the end I really had no idea what was going on. I still don't believe the people on IMDb who say they've seen it 30 times and know what's happening at the end.
The special effects, even for 80s PBS, are laughable. They basically consist of rectangles that fly out from the middle of the screen and pixilate everything. Also, it doesn't help that the whole thing is shot with a regular camcorder on videotape.
As if that wasn't bad enough, the final nail is at least three derrogatory remarks about anteaters. (MST3k might have cut some out) We also never find out why everyone hates anteaters so much. My best guess is that the writers also share this prejudice, and couldn't find a way to talk about it in public.
All in all, I think if this movie was the only one Raul could watch, he would choose to keep working.",998006400,3,1659,4.337620578778135

7822806,4,6302247152,It's always difficult to put into video a futuristic story and especially one so compelling as John Varley's great Science Fiction tale shown here. Nonetheless a great short story and a credit to Varley's skill at taking you out of the box.,1395446400,,240,4.738095238095238
7822807,4,6302247152,"Like another good science fiction film, ""This Island Earth,"" this TV movie from the early '80s is a casualty of having been shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000, which -- read the Amazon reviews of both films -- has given a lot of overly impressionable people the notion that the film *must* be bad.  In fact, it's quite good.

The main point to remember while watching the film is that it's obviously intended to be a lighthearted story.  A droll tone runs right through the film; you can see it, for instance, when a frantic teacher scolds a young student,""You almost got mustard on that man's brain!"" or Apollonia's ""commandment"" to Fingal, ""Thou shalt not screw around with things thou dost not understand,"" or the ever-escalating series of projectiles attacking Fingal and Apollonia from offscreen (darts, spear, Molotov cocktail).  This light tone is completely consistent over the course of the narrative.

The MST3K guys totally missed this and took everything humorous about the film to be *unintentionally* humorous.  They were way off the mark.

For God's sake, guys, re-read the title!  What kind of story does that title *suggest* you're going to experience?  An Ingmar Bergman drama?

Also, the fact that the film has lowish production values is no criticism either, unless you feel the Tom Baker ""Doctor Who"" episodes are just intrinsically bad because they're, like, you know, low budget.  Actually the film is quite lush, in terms of the handling of Rick's Place from ""Casablanca,"" for example, and the low-key futuristic environment of the story.  Budget-wise, it's no different from many other American Playhouse productions from the same period.  There's simply no problem with the look of the film unless you're constitutionally incapable of wrapping your brain around the idea of anything shot on videotape having quality.  (Which I guess means ""I, Claudius"" sucks too.)

And now that I've mentioned ""Casablanca,"" let's talk about the influence of this film on later ones.

""Overdrawn"" takes place in a near-future scenario, in which an anonymous bureaucratic worker, obsessed with the movie ""Casablanca,"" repeatedly falls into a dream world.  He rebels, is briefly tempted to play along and retreat back into bureaucratic anonymity, then rebels again.

Sound familiar?

To me it sounds an awful lot like ""Brazil,"" which was released two years after ""Overdrawn.""

Or how about this: an anonymous corporate worker finds himself inside a simulation of the real world in which he's chased by simulated thugs, who represent those who control the simulation.  His allies are able to ""plug into"" the simulation as well, and resemble their real-world avatars.  Eventually, in the final confrontation with the main thug, the protagonist is able to directly access the core of the simulation, becomes able to actually see the data flows running through the simulated world, and uses his newfound power to obliterate the villain.

That's ""The Matrix.""

But it's also ""Overdrawn at the Memory Bank.""

It's seriously time to rehabilitate the reputation of this film and recognize it for what it is: a lighthearted, witty, low-budget, independent science fiction TV movie whose makers knew exactly what they were doing.  I remember seeing it in high school when it was first broadcast and being thoroughly tickled by it.  Now that I've purchased a VHS copy of it and have seen it again after all these years -- yep, it's still just as charming.

""Charming"" -- just the right word for this film.",1359158400,,3504,5.1

7822809,5,6302247152,"This movie here inspired my all-time favorite MST3K episode.  I think I like it so much because it combines so many of my favorite elements.  Fragmented storylines, the 1980's, nostalgia for times past, a good looking blonde chick, and stock footage.  I don't even care that it's a movie so horrible that nobody can understand it.  Put Raul Julia in the starring role, and man, this becomes gold.  Of course, it's not as good in its original form as its MST3K counterpart, but I think it's still fun to watch.  Where else are you going to get a chance to see Raul Julia doing Casablanca?",1168128000,,587,4.542857142857143
7822810,3,6302247152,"On paper (literally, as this was based on a short story) Overdrawn at the Memory Bank has a great premise, informing us of what can and can't be controlled, and how some can adjust to that control, but others will always try to change it, for without progress, we would all be subjucated to what Fingle frequently finds himself...bored.

Fingle is sent into an Identicub holomatrix during a compulsary rehab session, and becomes trapped there, creating his own world (or rather butchering the settings and characters of the Humphry Bogart film Cassablanca) Fingle is soon able to use his surroundings to polay havok with the coroporations that run the planet's financial and climate conditions, a one-man rebellion from within the system, against the system.

Only a woman assigned to monitor Fingle whilst hsi body is located is his sole window into the real world, the two begin feeling affection for one another, but she works on both sides of the fence, trying to keep Fingle from going too far whilst trying to appease the wrath of the Corporation president (whom Fingle refers to as ""FAT MAN"")

Whilst the film fails on most levels to impress, (what film produced by PUBLIC ACCESS can do that and NOT be a miracle?) the story still shows signs of promise that hopefully, one day, is broght to our screens again, only this time with a competant script, sharper acting, and better quality.

At least this film isn't an ant-eater...",1101340800,3,1435,4.844897959183673

7822812,1,6302247152,"Don't sit through this movie, it's much more barable to sit through with Mystery Science Theatre 3000. Anyone agree? This is like the film the matrix ripped off, but guess what the matrix was good, this one totally sux! This is not a ""movie"" (I use that term lightly) for anyone human being to see. Eraserhead was easier to follow than this. Boring, stale, and lame. The only highlight of the film was seeing glimpses of casablanca. That's a great move, show a really great movie in your terrible movie. A man refusing to submit to the mindless monotony of his world punches up endless re-runs of ""Casablanca"" on his video display terminal until, in a strange mechanical mix-up, his identity and Rick Blaine's become fused within Novacorp's computer bank. Now, what was just a flickering fiction on his screen, becomes a reality. Yet another entry in the bizarre ""people getting lost inside computers"" genre. This one isn't even coherent.

To give an idea of just how bad this movie is, Mystery Science Theater 3000 even made fun of it.
