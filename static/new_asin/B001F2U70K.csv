8300680,5,B001F2U70K,I want another second season of ghost hunt animated. It's awesome. I love the first season of it. I want to know more about the mystery and characters. I want to see Mai and Nerico together. They make a cute couple.,1484697600,,215,4.2682926829268295
8300681,5,B001F2U70K,"My copy came slightly used but heck, this is one show I love. I wish they would have finished it and Ghost Hunt fans that are in this for an ending or explanation aren't going to get one unless they read the manga. That being said, it still has an ending to the current case without a cliffhanger and is a must for people who own part one.
I do, however, recommend people simply buy the 2 parts in the 1 season that's being sold instead of getting parts 1 and 2, as they are still only a season long and it's not a continuation of the box set that you can get at the same price as ONE part. Part one and two do cost more separately than the box set.",1456617600,,649,3.9242424242424243

Next season will be on the list.",1359417600,,133,4.36
8300683,5,B001F2U70K,"This was the last thing I received, but it was one of the best. It wasn't scratched and it was in good shape. I really love it!",1321142400,,127,3.740740740740741
8300684,5,B001F2U70K,This is a great series that I believe any fan of Ghost Hunters (Scifi channel) would enjoy. The characters are well done and they each have a disctinct personality that comes into the story. I found that the main characters were easy to like and to get along with. The dubbing was well done and did not have the usal whiny/ suealy quality that some do. The animation is excellent as well. I would say that this series is truly an excellent buy for any anime lover. This is good for younger teens all the way to adults as well. This is a series that I have shown to the anime club at the high school I work at.,1293667200,,609,4.126050420168068
8300685,4,B001F2U70K,"Bloodstained mansions, zombies, ghouls, deadly curses, and an army of vengeful ghosts that wreaks havoc on an innocent family. While the first half of ""Ghost Hunt"" was all about subtle spooky stuff, ""Ghost Hunt: Season 1, Part 2"" decides to embrace a more obvious brand of horror. It's both a good thing and a bad thing -- some of the supernatural goings-on are rather ridiculous (""He's using whirlwind sickles!""), but it's also skin-crawlingly creepy and horrific.

Naru and Co. are called in to yet another school, this one run by snotty, strict teachers. The place is apparently swarming with hostile spirits, and it seems to be linked to a student who committed suicide, and an ouija-like game called Orikiri-sama. Then the gang is summoned to a vast, labyrinthine haunted house, along with a number of psychics, mediums and even a few charlatans. Unfortunately, people start to go missing without a trace -- and the only clues are an old bill and a spirit's bloody messages, pointing to someone called ""Urado.""

And in the final arc, the team deals with the weird problems of a family living on a clifftop inn -- their pets are killed, someone is murdered on the clifftop, and malevolent spirits are possessing some of the family members. Naru is knocked senseless when a spirit enters his body, leaving Lin, Mai and the others to unravel a horrendous mystery rooted in half-forgotten legends of the past... and a presence that is trapping ghosts in a seaside cave.

While the previous episodes were rooted in psychic theory and subtle horrors, ""Ghost Hunt: Season 1 Part 2"" is a more exciting, visceral kind of horror. All the horrendous ghostly activity is amped up a notch from what it was before-- grinning possessed children, bathtubs of blood, a spirit-eating curse, and a dream of Mai's where she's kidnapped, dragged into a torture-porn lab, and cruelly murdered.

The one problem: the last arc is rather cheesy, with zombie invasions, ""whirlwind sickles,"" and John swatting ghosts with his HANDS. It also ends on an open note with many questions unanswered... particularly about ""dream Naru.""

Fortunately, the rest of these episodes are pretty well-written. Each arc is set up in the style of a murder mystery, with people being killed/threatened by mysterious forces, and a cluster of supernatural clues that must be unraveled before the story's end (from Dracula to a homemade Ouija board). But there are still some funny moments sprinkled throughout the stories, such as Yasu's peculiar sense of humor (""You're so HOT!"" ""You're kidding, right?... That's not funny, man"").

The writers also expand on the characters -- Ayako's special talents (and why they haven't worked before), Naru's true powers, and Monk's fanboyish side. And while she's still the likable schoolgirl, Mai's psychic talents rapidly become central to the investigations -- and we not only find out about her sad past, but she finds herself stuck in a love triangle with an oblivious Naru and a jealous, catty Masako.

But Lin gets the most attention in these arcs, since he not only turns out to have shikigami servants and kung-fu skills, but he unfreezes to the point where he becomes fond of Mai. And a new character is added to the mix: Yasu, a brilliant high school student with a knack for intricate research... and uttering outrageous lies.

""Ghost Hunt Season 1, Part 2"" has a rather cheesy final arc, but fortunately that doesn't keep it from also being extremely chilling, fun and sometimes horrific. Just don't watch the stuff about Urado after dark.",1261008000,,3549,4.9730185497470485
8300686,3,B001F2U70K,"Now originally I thought this would be good, but I was somewhat disappointed. Ghost Hunt has some good and bad points as an anime.

The great part is that it serves as a legit horror/suspense anime. There were a lot of times it made me jump. There were also a few times where I felt pulled into the anime and felt the emotions of the character, like when Mai almost gets her throat slit. It doesn't fail to scare you.

The animation doesn't get in the way either. It is really well put together, and the characters are well thought out. And there is always room for comic relief.

The bad news is that there really isn't a main plotline. The series is broken up into cases, which interfers with the idea of having a main objective. This also makes the series end too suddenly with too many questions. We never find out if Mai and Naru get together or if there is a bigger plan for the cast. Perhaps there will be another season since the collection says Season 1. If not, that's why I marked it down so bad.

Ghost hunt is by no means a bad anime. Just be prepared to be disappointed at the end.",1252195200,,1095,4.22488038277512
8300687,4,B001F2U70K,"Ghost Hunt concludes in a set sure to make it both a shoujo and horror anime staple.

Character development continues, as in particular we find out the reason for the bug up Lin's behind as Mai has a conversation with him that finally removes said bug.  Mai's relationship with Monk continues to be a highlight as he remains 10 shades of awesome, particularly when he takes the reins when Naru is incapacitated for a large chunk of the final case of the series, which also gives Ayako some great moments when the situation enters her territory.  The series also gains a new regular in Osamu Yasuhara, a bright boy with a good sense of humor roughly Mai's age who becomes the team's unofficial research assistant after he befriends the gang when they take a case at his school.

We're not allowed to forget, though, the reason why the series is named Ghost Hunt; and unlike most of the first half of the series, these three cases are genuinely scary.  This is turn the lights off and crawl under the covers material, culminating in - what else? - a battle between the cast regulars and an army of undead in July (a month which corresponds in Japanese culture to October in the United States in regards to things that go bump in the night).  It also stays true to the subject material - Ghost fans will notice, for instance, the nod in the middle case to the Winchester House which eventually shows up in any documentary anthology of hauntings on TV.

Several key issues are not addressed.  We never find out what Masako has on Naru, nor the reason for Mai's dreams of Naru; and the Mai/Naru/Masako triangle is nowhere near resolved.  Will Ghost Hunt eventually continue?  Only the spirits know for now - but I can safely say that the series as is will not-so-paranormally enter my DVD player in October for the forseeable future.",1227484800,9,1828,4.596923076923077
