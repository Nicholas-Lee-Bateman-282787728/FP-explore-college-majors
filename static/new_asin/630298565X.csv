7832995,5,630298565X,"The 1956 World Series was the only one the Yankees had thinking about revenge with Brooklyn as 1955 was the only year that those Brooklyn bums ever beat the Yanks in a World Series.  This was another classic 7 game series and Mantle came into it as AL MVP and triple crown winner.  Larsen's perfect game in game 5 against Brooklyn was a crucial game to win for the Yankees and using the no wind-up delivery Larsen had impeccable control and set down all 27 Dodgers that came to the plate.  He had help on the play by McDougald on the ball Andy Carey deflected and Mantle ran down a long fly ball in deep left center that Gil Hodges hit.

I really want to get this tape.  I have seen many clips of portions of Larsen's perfect game but in those days the weekday games were played in the afternoon.  My elementary school was just around the corner from my house.  I was only in the third grade. We get out at 3 PM and run home ot see the end of the game on NBC, channel 4 in those days. I was shocked when I turned it on and there was no game! The game took well under 2 hours to play and was long over when I tried to turn it on! Larsen mowed them down and Maglie only gave up 5 hit and two runs.  No need for relief pitchers that day.  The only pinch hitter was Dale Mitchell batting for Maglie in the ninth and taking a called third strike.",1207440000,39,1341,4.030188679245283
