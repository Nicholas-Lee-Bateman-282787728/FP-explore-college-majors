3597069,5,B001G6E7TM,My 17 year old daughter LOVES Tye so I thought I'd get her this DVD for Christmas.  SO GLAD I DID!  I'm 43 years old and found myself enjoying it as much as her.  Have even encouraged her and some of the other teens from our church to learn the mime dance from the dvd so they can do it at our church.  Would encourage others to purchase without hesitation!,1231200000,,357,4.057142857142857
3597070,4,B001G6E7TM,"This video is very-well put together, though the overall cinematography is not at the same level as ""Victory! Live!"" The bonus features more than make up for it as the message is on point, the commentary is hilarious, and the extras will keep you watching for quite a while. Every Christian/Gospel music fan needs this in their collection without a shadow of a doubt.",1229385600,,367,4.75
3597071,5,B001G6E7TM,"This was by far one of the most well rounded gospel dvds I have ever come across. The concert was off the chart,the band was the tight, the vocals were on target, the ministry of the word was effective and the return from the purchase was a major plus. I would recommend you add this dvd to your collection.",1228694400,,307,4.220338983050848
3597072,5,B001G6E7TM,"I anxiously awaited this dvd and was not disappointed. The energy and excitement of this video is phenominal...Minister Tye  covers several music genres with his songs......and he does take it to church also. His guests include Kierre Sheard(Kiki),Kim Burrell, Judith Christie McAllister and Jon Owens.
  What is different is the audience's response;at times they are still and observant. Perhaps it can be attributed to the songs being unfamiliar to them or not wanting to miss what's going on onstage.  Some of the music has a rock/metal flava to it and I think it took some by suprise.....eventually they get with it.
  Soooo much info is given in this dvd. You get an interview with Shante (wifey),Sound Check (band). In addition, you get to hear commentary by Tye,Thaddaeus and others;they are so crazy!!! Questions are also answered on the dvd concerning G.A.,SoundCheck,music content,song inspiration....just everything you might want to know about Tye & G.A.  You really get a glimpse into his personality. I commend him for giving so much of himself and his family  (and all for $14.98:)
  You gotta add this dvd to your collection along with the previous ""Victory"" dvd if you don't already have it.  You shouldn't soon tire of hearing Tye Tribbett and seeing him 'cause he's so versatile and always keeps it fresh.  He mentioned in the dvd that he can't give us everything at once because it would probably scare us; so stay tuned for more.
  I also note that musicians will definetely appreciate hearing the testimonies of how his band members eventually forsook playing secular engagements and how music inspiration from the HOLY SPIRIT far exceeds other musical influences one may think is relative.",1226188800,3,1712,5.067857142857143
3597073,5,B001G6E7TM,"The focus of this dvd is Jesus Christ. God uses Tye Tribbett and G.A. to accomplish real ministry through word and music. It's not about the entertainment, it's about Jesus!!! It will make you strive to have a real relationship with God. Holiness is the only way to do it. So Go and buy this dvd because it will be a blessing to you.",1226016000,,333,4.21875

So Tye has done it again!! Stand Out everybody. This DVD was great. However, I thought with the energy from the CD that the DVD would have been off the charts. Victory was way better in terms of the energy you could feel from every one in G.A. But yet and still Tye and G.A. always deliver a great performance and the spirit of God was most unquestionably in the building and that is all that matters. So go on ya'll and give God the Glory",1225929600,,584,5.358695652173913
3597075,5,B001G6E7TM,"If you LOVE Gospel you'll LOVE this DVD.  It's full of powerful worship, behind the scenes footage, and lots of fun.

3597077,5,B001G6E7TM,"I'm not much of a ""music buff"" - but I do love to praise and worship the Lord! My husband has a LARGE music collection - and in the 12 yrs I've been married to him, I think my collection has grown to 5 CD's!  This CD is by far MY FAVORITE!!  When I am down, sad, depressed or just feel like ""lifting the name of Jesus"" - there is always a song on here that helps me to do just that!  I originally purchased the CD for my daughter - but I don't think she's listened to it (or seen it) more than twice! Mommy has it now!!!",1274140800,,520,3.7522935779816513

3597084,5,B001G6E7TM,"I really enjoy this DVD. I watched it every night when I first received it.  This group is energetic and eager to lead people into worship.  I love the commentary that Tye and Soundcheck do.  I wish they had more interviews with members of the group, though.  He has had some people with him for years and I would love to learn more about them.  The Rock Church was just on fire!  My respect for Tye Tribbett has really increased since seeing the professionalism of this video. The beach party was also an unexpected bonus.",1233705600,,523,4.4526315789473685
