8625338,5,B00GOA297C,"Streetwalkers (& the preceding Chappo-Whitney band Family) were personal faves of mine way back when. I saw the 'Walkers on the 1975 tour, and they were way more powerful live than the debut Downtown Flyers album degraded by mediocre production. it was fabulous to be able to see and hear the boys at their best again. The DVD looks great, and given the limitations of '70s technology, sounds great, too. ""Burn it Down"" & ""Walking On Waters"" are just as explosive as I remember, and this is the first live version of ""Hangman"" I've heard. These guys deserved a better break than they got in the US, but the collection here is a must-buy for the few of us who got the word. It's even priced well.",1442016000,,695,4.480314960629921
8625339,5,B00GOA297C,"What could be better than a Rockpalast release featuring the Streetwalkers?  Unlike actual live shows, this is more along the lines of a BBC release in a sound studio but that is great as it shows the music we hear on their studio releases in the actual gritty way they conceived it.  You have a stunning DVD showing the band doing its thing, something you will find nowhere else that I am aware as well as two CD's featuring the band doing multiple versions of its tunes.  Alas, if they only had ""Sam (Maybe he can come to an Arrangement)"" on this CD, it would be the greatest in the world. Roger Chapman's vocals, Charlie Whitney's and Bobby Tench's smoking guitars, a powerful rhythm section, what more could one ask?",1433289600,,720,4.523076923076923

Both were in the band when they recorded what I feel were their strongest albums, ""Downtown Flyers"" and the stunning ""Red Card."" Two takes of the 1977 show have Michael Feat on bass and David Dowle on drums, along with keyboardist Brian Johnstone (the latter two later joined WHITESNAKE). Some clips from these shows have been on YouTube for a while. I have similar sets from Repertoire featuring ROCKPILE, CLIMAX BLUES BAND and MICKEY JUPP, and the quality of all considering their age have been excellent, but they only have a single concert apiece. The STREETWALKERS set is an embarrassment of riches in comparison! Here's the track listings:

The set comes in a nice slipcased digipak with a booklet featuring a history of the group based on a lengthy interview with Bob Tench. The sound and picture is as good as it gets for it's age and somewhat better than the companion ROCKPILE and MICKEY JUPP sets. There are some clips on YouTube that you can check out beforehand. Stop your toenail draggin' and down some rum, jump on your horse and buy this immediately.....!

For the uninitiated: STREETWALKERS rose from the ashes of beloved UK group FAMILY, formed by FAMILY vocalist extraordinaire Roger Chapman and guitarist Charley Whitney, both were also the band's main songwriters. Active between 1966 and 1973, the band released seven studio albums, a remix album and numerous singles. Since their demise there have been a bounty of compilations including a live set, four BBC session and concert discs and the requisite box set or two. Other well-know members include Ric Gretch (poached by BLIND FAITH), John Wetton (poached by KING CRIMSON), Tony Ashton (Ashton, Gardner & Dyke) and Jim Cregan (BLOSSOM TOES, COCKNEY REBEL). Popular in the UK and Europe, FAMILY never made much of a dent in the US, but had most of their albums released here anyway. Upon their demise Chapman and Whitney made a duo album titled STREETWALKERS. A few concerts thrown together to promote the disc were wildly popular, encouraging them to form a full time band and triumverate with Bob Tench (JEFF BECK GROUP, HUMMINGBIRD) that lasted the run of the band.
