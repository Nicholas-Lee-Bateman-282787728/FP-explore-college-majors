8240963,3,B00118SUHK,I expected something more exciting. One of the greatest US fighter jets ever made. A plane that changed the face of a war deserves better then this. This may have been one of the most boring films I've ever watched. I only gave it 3 stars instead of no stars because I love the F4 phantom and feel it's been poorly represented.,1519516800,,327,4.290322580645161
8240964,3,B00118SUHK,This was a present so I didn't get to watch the whole thing.  But what I saw was just OK video transfer.,1504569600,,104,3.727272727272727
8240965,5,B00118SUHK,"This is way more tech information than anybody will ever need about this airplane

People who really love airplane minutiae will love this video.

Any idea how many were built?????

I know",1503878400,,188,4.8125
8240966,3,B00118SUHK,Good buy,1493942400,,8,3.5
8240967,5,B00118SUHK,"Tons of information,rare footage .explanation of how the phantom was developed and how this amazing machine functions. Although most of the footage is dated it is still highly collectable for F4 fans.",1393891200,,200,5.28125
8240968,4,B00118SUHK,"Just like the videos we watched in Navy training to be mechanics. It was a good bird in it's day but it seems it was more of a test platform to perfect the J-79 engine for the F-14 Tomcat (which ultimately replaced the Phantom.)
 The video seemed to spend more time on flaws, particularly with the engines and as usual by the time it was perfected it was obsolete!",1378598400,,364,4.27536231884058
8240969,3,B00118SUHK,"Fairly technical review of the F-4. Would recommend other works such as ""Threshold: A Blue Angels Experience"", SkyfireVideo's, ""Phantom"", and the book, ""Phantoms and Angels"" for more exciting narratives and visual spectacles.",1323993600,,225,6.0625
8240970,4,B00118SUHK,"I worked on these when I was in the Air Force back in the 70s. Great video to bring back memories. Covers both Navy and Air Force models. More technical info than battle scenes.

But, not as good as ""Phantom"" by Skyfire.",1287878400,8,220,4.238095238095238
8240971,5,B00118SUHK,"Terrific!...The quality of the video is a little dated. However, the substance of the DVD is excellent, I love it! The most detailed DVD i've ever seen about one of the most Beautiful and capable fighter aircraft (of it's time) ever built by our country. Definitly a must have for all Phantom Phanatics video librarys. The F4 Phantom II is the muscule car of fighter aircraft in my opinion. Long live the Phantoms! The Below listed books are an outstanding resource for the true Phantom Phans.

8240972,5,B00118SUHK,"As a former fleet sailor on USS Independence back in the 70's, boy, this was one thunderous workhorse of a fighter!  This fighter had power (thrust) to burn and could hold its own in a dog fight (although one of its weaknessess was its average to poor turning ratio); but what an airplane!  This dvd goes over most of the F-4's design systems, archival photos of this bird in action, this is a great dvd of a past great fighter!",1218499200,6,428,4.3375
