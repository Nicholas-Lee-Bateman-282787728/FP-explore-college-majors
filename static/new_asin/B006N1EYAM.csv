8501246,5,B006N1EYAM,"This video is ""Perfect!"" I had little knowledge of Tai Chi or its history and healing power and I was captivated by this video. The video was brilliantly put together. The visuals and sequence of the origin of Tai chi was not only fascinating, but orchestrated in a way that kept it interesting and entertaining to watch.

When the video showed how Tai chi changed the instructor's life a constant thought kept running through my mind throughout the remainder of the video, ""Why don't more people know about this?""
Tai chi should be adapted for children in preschool, teen centers, mental health facilities, etc. The steps were introduced in an easy, non-threatening manner that made me even more excited about Tai chi! Overall, this is an excellent video that I would recommend to anyone at any age!",1341187200,5,800,4.839416058394161
8501247,5,B006N1EYAM,"I met the instructor of this tai chi video at Tai Chi Gala. There, she taught an awesome workshop and this video of hers is excellent. I am new to tai chi, so I'm glad I got this video. It's more expensive than many of them out there, but better in quality than other ones I've bought. Mostly because of the multiple angles, each move is in separate chapter, cuts down the BS, and the instructor really supports you with free ebooks you get from the DVD, and the related blog videos. Other teachers don't do that at all.",1341100800,5,520,4.262626262626263
