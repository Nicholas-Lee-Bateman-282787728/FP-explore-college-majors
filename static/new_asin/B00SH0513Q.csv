6983808,5,B00SH0513Q,"For those who have read and dreamed along with Ryan and Colin Pyle on their circumnavigation of China this Blu-ray set is a pure pleasure. Not only does it document the men on the motorcycles, their brotherhood and relation ship as they say goodbye to their families to mount this terrific trip, but it also shares with the viewer the grandeur of China, the vast cities of Shanghai etc, the incredibly challenging terrain, the impossible situations that arise, the comedy and the difficulties of the challenge to travel 18,000 km in 65 days.

The photography is splendid (Ryan is a professional photographer but the trip is captured by a ride along crew allowing us to see the men on bikes in motion) and the sense of grandeur - both of the land and of the spirit - is deeply moving.

6983809,4,B00SH0513Q,"Tough Rides: India (2015) is a six episode, 156 minute long presentation that follows the adventures of brothers Ryan and Colin Pyle as they pilot a pair of Royal Enfield motorcycles, on a route that mostly runs along the coastline and upper borders of India.  The trip begins in New Delhi, and lasts for 54 days, covering a total distance of roughly 14,000 kilometers, or 8,700 miles.

Followed by a camera crew and a support vehicle to help document the journey, Tough Rides is not about rapidly covering difficult terrain, while overcoming dangerous obstacles.  The journey proceeds at a steady pace, where scenes on the road are complemented by the experiences the two riders have along the way, which includes interaction with the local people, vehicular repairs, tourist type sightseeing activities, participation in cultural events, visits to temples and a hospital, para-gliding down a mountainside, and a closes with a visit to the Taj Mahal.

Besides the scenery and insights into Indian culture, what makes the journey interesting and fun is the personalities and extremely positive attitude of the Pyle brothers.  These guys seem so genuine and real, that you can't help but be won over by them, and their open and honest approach to what they do.  Aside from some mild playful banter, there doesn't seem to be much pretense about them, as neither Colin nor Ryan seems to have a huge ego, or displays any hint of anger.

When the travelers were crossing through the arid western section of the country, I expected to see some grueling footage, but that did not really happen.  The trip is not without hardships, but considering the scope of the journey, except for many instances of dangerous traffic situations, what you do see seems rather mild.  A few minor mechanical issues, trouble finding petrol, a touch of indigestion, sharing the road with animals, and one minor fall, are among the mishaps.  The Indian people seem friendly, and no one seen seems to resent the presence of the travelers or their camera crew.

In their book about this journey,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-India-Ride/dp/B00JHM423I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The India Ride</a>, the Pyle brothers may get into different aspects of their Indian Odyssey, but in the documentary episodes, the tone is mostly light and fun.  Not much time is devoted to basics like eating meals, refueling, communication with the outside world, or the logistics of the trip or the shooting of the documentary.  The image quality of the Blu-ray is excellent, capturing the at times very colorful aspects of Indian culture, clothing, and architecture.

The Pyle brothers had previously travelled on motorcycles in China in 2010, and this journey was also the subject of a documentary presented on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blu-ray/dp/B00SH0513Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blu-ray</a>.  This however, was my first experience following their very family-friendly adventures.  Tough Rides: India wasn't the rough and tumble adventure I expected, but it was certainly well worth watching, as you are presented with sights that the average tourist may not often see.  I do wish that the content ran a bit longer, as India seems to be a fascinating place.

A complimentary copy of the Blu-ray was provided for evaluation.",1441152000,,3380,5.442528735632184
6983810,4,B00SH0513Q,"This is an interesting, worthwhile DVD that's a bit conflicted. It can't decide if it's about India, modestly skilled motorcyclists contending with India or two Canadian brothers' reactions to India. We get a good deal of each with the contending being the most prevalent.

Along the way, they hit a few famous places such as the Taj and major sites of three of the four major religions of India skipping only Islam. Some of their comments about these visits are embarrassing for being so ignorant, but some, like their reaction to the rat temple, are frankly hilarious. Along the way they experience one harrowing traffic jam after another. If you ride a bike, or maybe if you only have a car, just seeing what Indians live with in traffic will make you many times the cost of this DVD happy wherever you live, ride or drive.

Although less often than their China trip, they do encounter some very rough terrain including some serious water or mud crossings. Like in China, they make it thorough less on skill (which is lacking) relying instead on their general athleticism.

I'd have preferred more about India. Having one or the other brother be at an interesting site and repeat over and over that he has no idea what's going on is less interesting to me than if they bothered to get someone to narrate just what was going on. This sort of non-information happens over and over and is particularly bothersome at some places like the gate and flag ceremony at the Pakistan / India border. If you don't know, keep quiet. Don't repeat over and over that you're baffled.

Both the audio and video are excellent although the videographer is a bit overly in love with time lapse. It does do a good job of showing the huge mass of humanity which is India. Overall, this is a well done and interesting DVD for anybody interested in India or riding in India. I doubt anybody watching this would wish to duplicate the brothers' adventures, though.",1440374400,,1941,4.666666666666667
6983811,5,B00SH0513Q,"Showing both the good and the bad, this unvarnished Blu-ray documentary explores about 8,900 miles via motorcycles over a 54-day period, showing the beautiful and the ugly...all fast paced and with gentle humor.  Watching brothers Colin and Ryan Pyle banter with each other during their adventure was as much a part of the entertainment as was the spectacular but often gritty scenery, as was their amusing beard-growing contest.

My wife and I watched this on a 100-inch screen from a cinema projector which would have exposed any production errors and video shortcomings.  The transitions from their main video cameras to the ones attached to their motorcycles and helmets were skillfully done during post-production and helped to sustain our interest.  Unlike videos produced by tourist bureaus, this video provides what I believe is a realistic view of India.  It nonapologetically exposes India's grinding poverty, gritty, crowded urban regions, often disintegrated roads filled with aggressive, dangerous drivers and well as some extremely friendly and helpful Indians, stunning landscapes, architecture, art and antiquities.

This video, provided to me in exchange for an honest review, greatly enhanced my education about one of our world's most densely populated countries.  While viewing this video on my big screen with the benefit of high definition photography, I believe that this documentary was the next best thing to being there.  Anyone interested in learning more about India, its people and landscapes, I believe will greatly appreciate the energy and effort expended by the brothers Pyle in producing and releasing this video.",1440288000,,1647,5.482213438735178

In this documentary they travel for 54 days, going from one town, one City, the Country side to another in this amazing Nation, India
So what was it like to take this journey
 First, let me say that the two brothers were absolutely great in their presentation of the Country and it's people. .As  you shared the adventures, they became your fellow traveler, as their explanations and merging with the  people brought you right into the moment with them. .I liked how they didn't try to put on a ""Big Shot"" roll, but were themselves, sharing their feelings, their excitement, their problems so that you felt  you were experiencing it with them, good or bad I was very impressed with how well they rode their bikes over the 'crazy' roads that they had to travel on.  I think I would have died right there, but they were great.  They also allowed the different trials they went through to be shown, sickness, flat tires, broken car, and that just made the trip  more to life. I myself loved seeing the different Villages, Towns, Cities, people, events, Customs, it was
amazing. Although the Rat Palace was kind of hard to take, but each to their own. That in itself was something to see. I definitely had more of an understanding of who these people are, how they live and how beautiful their Country is.
  This was a wonderful learning experience, entertaining, and very enjoyable.  I loved the Elephants probably more than anything else. They are amazing. I am very happy to recommend this to you. I think schools should show this to their classes, they would love it and learn from it. The Brothers did a excellent job and should be very  proud. I'm not real sure  about the jumping off the mountain, but that's another story., and it to  is amazing. Great Documentary highly recommended. Well worth your time.  Received for a honest review

The only experience that I have with motorcycles is from my wilder----""daze""----days. I won't relate
THAT part of MY life, other than to say I lived through it; so did Colin and Ryan Pyle.
Our experiences were different. My adventure was in a blizzard, after a bachelor party, with a borrowed
Harley. THEIR 18,000 kilometer adventure was shorter than some of MY adventures... longer than most.
I helped tow a ship from Guam to Texas. That involved getting from The Pacific to the Atlantic via The
Panama Canal. I've been on the Transiberian Express. I made it back from Vietnam in the 'sixties... but,
I've never been on a 2-wheel vehicle longer than TWO hours. I'm content to sit back on my COUCH, and
watch THE PYLES get all those saddle-blisters and cracked ribs!

The Pyle brothers did MUCH more than I ever dared to... and on only TWO wheels! What an adventure!

One brother was a successful---Canadian equivelant of a---Wall Street banker. He sold his house, quit
his job, and joined his brother that has lived in CHINA (of all places!)for over 11 years. I can understand
THAT, though. I've got an itch in my shoes too. I'm a 65-year-old, retired military man that has lived in
Germany the past 21 years. Since the age of 19---after a Jimi Hendrix concert and a draft notice call-up---
I have lived all over the world. I returned to America in 1973, left in 1976, and have returned only once,
for four years, in the '90s.

I UNDERSTAND the travelling bug. I do. I've had bullets buzzing past my head, and often. I'm adventurous,
and I'm a really big fan of the Pyle COUSINS: Goober and Gomer. The BROTHERS: Colin and Ryan, may SEEM
to be almost as ""goofy"" to most people [that've never been outside of their home country].

The Pyle brothers set out to see all they could---on BMW motorcycles---driving around China [for 65 days].

They have a Guiness World Record.

They started out in Shanghai. Neither a mechanic, but learned along the way. Six EXCELLENT 26-minute epi-
sodes, they're in Shanghai again... planning a trip around INDIA. Ah! I've never been to India... but I WAS
on a ship during the Indian/Pakistan War and circled Sri Lanka [then, Ceylon] for a few months.

I enjoyed THIS so much, I'll buy THAT [next] series... after I finish reading the book about the adventure:

If---I say IF---I had ANY criticisms of these six---easily digested, enjoyable---episodic legs of the journey, it

6983815,5,B00SH0513Q,"I was sidetracked from Vietnam when I was in The Navy. The ship I was assigned to circled a small island south of
India called Ceylon [now Sri Lanka]... for several weeks.
India-Pakistani relations deteriorated when civil war erupted in Pakistan, pitting the WEST Pakistan army against
the EAST Pakistanis. That fighting forced 10 million East Pakistani Bengalis to flee to India.
When Pakistan attacked Indian airfields in Kashmir, India attacked both East a-n-d West Pakistan. It occupied the
eastern half, which declared its independence as Bangladesh, on 6 December 1971. Under great pressure, a United
Nations cease-fire was arranged in mid-December, after Pakistan's defeat.
Pakistan lost its eastern half, an army of 100,000 soldiers, and was thrown into political turmoil. Tensions were al-
leviated by the Shimla accord of 1972, and by Pakistan's recognition of Bangladesh in 1974, but tensions recure per-
iodically. THIS border is shown in the travelogue; remember these facts when you see the changing-of-the-guard!
Interesting area of the world... see The Taj Mahal; an elephant sanctuary; eye-clinic; shrines to rats; sacred cows;
monkeys; landslides; chaotic trafic; wonderfully helpful people; and little kids stealing hubcaps... but TOO polite to
run away when caught!
Bombay----like Ceylon----changed its name to Mumbai. Okay; enough of that! WHY would you want to SEE this?
This circumnavigation of India----because China limits the size of families, India will soon be the most populated
country on Earth----depicts HOW c-r-o-w-d-e-d the place is; how bad the infrastructure is; how diverse the people are;
how beautiful the country is; how POOR most people are; and, how many different religions live, in peace, to-geth-er.

As an old biker myself, I've often thought about some of the sights I missed, but now I have a pretty good idea, at least for China and India.

You won't get any in depth analysis of the culture or philosophy, but you will see that the people of India are pleasant and welcoming, and apparently almost always willing to help foreign travelers get their bikes fixed, find fuel, and so on. And what sights! From a rat temple to the Taj Mahal, we see a culture rich in history and rich in happy people. I was quite impressed with the brief look at tea growing in Darjeeling. It occurred to me that some of our wealthy CEOs could use the attitude put forth by these tea growers; after all, who is it who actually earns all that money for a company, anyway? You won't want to miss that segment.

I greatly admire the tenacity of Colin and Ryan, taking on a 14,000 km trip in sometimes less than ideal weather conditions, and sharing this exciting video with us. Two very enthusiastic thumbs up. Don't miss it.

I was about to rate it 3 starts but the later episodes pulled it up to nearly a 4. As someone else mentioned, it seemed over edited in order to fit a small time frame....and I very much agree.

Would I recommend buying....well, maybe if only for the scenery.  Long Way Round/Down was much more compelling in my honest opinion.",1487116800,,484,4.528735632183908
6983821,3,B00SH0513Q,"So, this is an interesting concept, but could have been done better. It seemed over edited to fit time constraints.

First, the negative. Both guys seem to complain constantly. The younger brother makes a lot of disrespectful comments and doesn't even possess elementary knowledge about China. A little research about a place you plan to visit seems standard. Also, neither guy seems to know much about bikes. I found that odd.

On a positive note, cool scenery and it seemed like a cool trip.  I found it somewhat entertaining. The older brother seemed to have a genuine appreciation for China.

All in all, it was inexpensive and mildly entertaining.",1482192000,2,652,4.954128440366972
6983822,5,B00SH0513Q,"I really enjoy Ryan's work, both as an extreme trekker as well as a photographer.  This Blue-ray, though, is especially  fascinating for me because the viewer sees several changes in his docu-logue:  the many diverse terrains of China and the bond he shares with his brother Colin.  Colin quits his job as an investment banker in Toronto to travel around China with Ryan.  One also sees how Colin's impressions of China improve the longer he's in the country.  Yes, there's more to China than just air pollution,  crowded, dirty city streets and loud industrial sectors with people speaking a dialect most westerners don't understand.

Ryan lived ten years in China.  This trip was completed in 2010 and released in 2013 and in Blu-Ray two years after that.  The brothers start in Shanghai and travel counter-clockwise around the country, north along the busy east coast to North Korea, across the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, the Gobi desert, along the Pakistani border, across Tibet, Yunan Province and back to Shanghai.

The video is captured by helmet cam both brothers wear, and some wide angle footage made by their two-man support team, that travels in a van large enough to carry a broken-down BMW motorbike.  Dialogue is provided by audio between the brothers, ""Diary Cams"" both brothers make at the end of each day's journey, and frontal footage.  Viewers see and hear the highs and lows of each day, the impressions they capture, and even some good-natured joking between the two men.  Their beards grow thicker as the days pass on.  By day 65 the beards are impressively thick.

There are some scary incidents along the way.  Neither man is a motorcycle mechanic. Both men wipe out a few times. Colin wipes out four times, two of them rather frightening.  The motorbikes' batteries freeze in extreme temperatures. Ryan's clutch fails in the middle of nowhere. They ride past a traffic jam in which people were stuck for 26 days (!!!)  Days of intense rain challenge their spirits.  There's even a few scenes around Day 37 where even Ryan sounds defeated.  He celebrated his 32th birthday feeling very melancholy.  But the brothers manage to take advantage of the time they are stranded in Lhasa for some more spectacular scenes with Buddhist monks.

I enjoyed the interactions between the Pyle brothers with the locals, whether they were in along the North Korean border, Kaqa, Kashgar or Guilan. Ryan is the native tour guide who also adds short historical narrative to the scenes (sometimes followed by Colin's sometimes witty remarks).  The fraternal interchange at times is quite comical.  They make quite a few comments about animal scat. (The expletives can be annoying at times)

The photography and videography are impressive.  One sees and feels the diversity of China.  One even sees footage that I'd think were prohibitive, since so little photography is allowed to come out of Tibet. Another impressive plus is that this documentary is not  a noticeable documentary sponsored by, for example, BMW or a big travel guide business.  This is a documentary paid for primarily by the Pyles and the passion for their adventure shows.  Highly recommended for fans of China or for anyone traveling to China.

6983823,4,B00SH0513Q,"Tough Rides China is a six part documentary series running about 156 minutes, that follows brothers Ryan and Colin Pyle, as they embark on an 18,000 kilometer motorcycle ride through China, scheduled to last 60 days.  What is referred to as the middle kingdom ride, begins in Shanghai, and follows a route that mostly runs along Chinas borders.  The brothers journey takes them through some unusual, picturesque, and at times rugged locations.  The documentary also features the Pyles in various cultural activities and side trips, and in numerous interview clips.

The Pyle brothers come across as pretty likeable guys, and following their adventures is interesting and fun.  Their journey is not always smooth, as they have to contend with traffic, rough weather, and various equipment problems.

Having already seen&nbsp;, a similar six part documentary that follows the Pyle brothers in a subsequent adventure riding motorcycles in India, I pretty much knew what to expect.  Although Tough Rides China is entertaining, educational, and features some notable locations, various circumstances and mechanical difficulties make for a journey that does not flow as well as it might have, as unfortunately the Pyles had to bypass certain areas on their itinerary.

I believe that the Pyle brothers learned a lot from their adventures in China, which probably contributed to Tough Rides India being a better edited and more enjoyable watch.  One item however, did remain the same.

Although they travelled for thousands of miles on motorcycles, neither of the Pyle brothers seems to have much knowledge about how to maintain or repair them.  Often, the fate of their quest, seems to rest in the hands of some random mechanic.  The brothers are being followed by a camera crew, so they are not completely on their own, and perhaps including someone in their party with the ability to repair motorcycles, might have been a good idea.

A copy of the Blu-ray was provided for review, and the video presentation is very good, however covering an adventure with a scope this broad in only six episodes, obviously required that content be edited out.  This contributes to a feeling of incompleteness, and wanting to see much more.  For those seeking more detail, there is&nbsp;&nbsp;a book written by the Pyles about their journey.  Tough Rides China provides some interesting insights into the country, and features many interesting places.  I just wish that the format of documentary permitted more of their story could be told.  This same documentary was apparently previously released on DVD as&nbsp;.",1451174400,,2595,5.197115384615385
6983824,4,B00SH0513Q,"As with the other series Pyle produced, Touch Rides India, and Sacred Mountains of China, I enjoyed it immensely. However, if I were to rank them in order, this was maybe my least favorite. That can't be blamed on any lack of jaw dropping, stunning scenery in China. I was totally absorbed by the Great Wall's merger with the Gobi Desert, by the magnificent views in the Himalayan mountains, by Mt Everest, the Potala palace in Lhasa, and especially by the Li River cruise.  Exotic locales such as those, are the very foundation of an interesting travel documentary. Maybe what bothered me with this, the first in the series, was all the problems they had with the bikes. They would break down, or they'd have accidents. On many occasions, the bikes needed to be put on trucks, towed, or pulled into cars. In fact, if you were to add together all the time during the Middle Kingdom ride, when they were either dealing with a broken bike, or complaining about how upset they were, by their bikes, it ended up being a large percentage of the entire program. Even though the two brothers were obviously blown away by the scenery,  a feeling which I could easily share, they also were understandably upset and depressed by the accidents and the break downs. Unfortunately, that vibe started to effect me too. Even though this program is about their bike ride, its also a travel documentary. When their bike ride, and the problems associated with this overwhelmed them, then the travel documentary portion of the program started to suffer. Another issue I had, was that on a few occasions, it was as if Ryan and Colin forgot that they needed to appeal to a wider audience. Instead, they started to use each other as their audience. Of course, you speak differently to an adult sibling, than you would to a large scale TV audience. So, dropping a ton of  F bombs, or complaining that your Dad doesn't like you very much, gets to be a bit off topic. Especially if you're at the foot of Mt Everest. A few more words about how Hillary was the first man to  have scaled the mountain, or why it's holy to Tibetan Buddhism, or even its height in feet and meters, would have been more appropriate. Since this was Ryan Pyle's first documentary, it could easy be forgiven, as he searched for his narrator's voice.

Overall, I enjoyed this program, and will watch the DVD again, especially their Li River cruise, and some of the Himalayan scenery. If you've ever wanted to travel thru China and Tibet (I've dreamt of it my entire adult life), then you'll certainly take vicarious pleasure from their journey. Of course, that's exactly why the Pyle brothers went to the trouble, to film this show anyway. On the other hand, I'd be less than honest, to rate this series as highly as I might have rated Sacred Mountains, for example.

6983825,5,B00SH0513Q,"I was given a hralled with the video. I have always had tmy honest review.  I have to say I was enthralled with this video. I had preconceived ideas about wht China was like. i probably am like most westerners in that respect. There are beautiful beaches, glacial lakes, wonderful sand dunes. They  travel by motorcycle through torrential rains, mudslides, freezing temperatures and snow.  You get a great idea of the different cultures and food throughout the country.  I was surprised to find that there were camels in China. You see how large the country is when they stand at the border of China and North Korea. They travel to the border of Pakistan and China. When they travel to Tibet you learn that they use yak and sheep poop for fires.  Most of the areas you see are so remote and beautiful. They are completely different from what you would find in Shanghai where they started their journey. I find people who take journeys like this very brave. They face bike accidents, broken bikes and the hospitality of the local peoples. There is such a contrast between the century old cities and their buildings and the more modern cities like Shanghai. The trip had both highs and lows throughout the trip. I was shocked to find that they had trouble getting parts for their bikes because there were none. They were able to do some unexpected site seeing while waiting for parts for their bikes to come in. My only complaint if I had any was the language. They used the ""F"" word quite a bit which is something I haven't encountered in their other videos.  Would I recommend this movie? You bet I would I would also welcome the chance to review their tough rides through Brazil. I will never travel where they have, yet this is a wonderful way to see a country.",1445644800,,1763,4.563291139240507
6983826,5,B00SH0513Q,"This certainly isn't the typical travel documentary. Like other travelogues, we get to see distant places(China, of course, in this case) but here we really get to experience the culture of China and meet its people. We also get to see places far away from the people: the mountains, the deserts, the lakes the farms, as well as the farm animals(and non-farm animals). And then there is the adventure and dangers of the trip itself. It is amazing that these brothers survived all of their trials. Their motorcycles(BMWs in this trip) didn't always survive and they had to repair them a few times while they had to make some of the journey by other means, even a bit by plane. There were also some amazing hazards near the cities like a twenty day traffic jam(they didn't stay long in that traffic jam, being able to wiggle through it with their motorcycles)! If you really want to experience China without actually traveling, this is one of the best ways.

6983827,5,B00SH0513Q,"I was given this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:

I have and ride a motorcycle, so I can appreciate the wanderlust in the Pyle brothers to do this trip in China.  The trip would have been difficult enough in a car, so two motorcycles make it that much more compelling.  There are crashes and impassable roads and snow and mud and rain.  It's interesting to see the brothers' attitudes change from day to day as the journey unfolds.  The trip itself was epic and is worth watching the highlights in this video series.

The videography is great, with lots of shots of the beautiful countryside around parts of China that westerners rarely get to see.  Also interesting is the interactions with the people they meet on the way.  Editing was done very well and your attention is captivated in each episode.  It you like adventure and exploring new places with a guide, then this ""Tough Rides"" series is for you!",1444953600,,921,4.560975609756097
6983828,5,B00SH0513Q,"As a general rule, the reality show genre is not my gig.  This Blu Ray  disc would easily qualify as an exception to that rule.  It is about 2 brothers who set off to circumnavigate China on motorcycles.  It isn't any kind of a race, nor are there any contrived tasks for them to perform.  Rather, it is simply about 2 brothers who embark on a 65 day odyssey to explore regions of China that few people from the west have ever seen.  The journey includes drive-bys of China's borders with North Korea, Pakistan & Nepal.

For myself, I have been to Shanghai, which is both the starting point & the ending point of their journey.  Westerners who go to China typically hit the hot spots such as the Forbidden City, Tibet and the Great Wall.  While the latter 2 are explored by the brothers, they also travel to far more remote places in the country.  As it turns out, China has an amazingly diverse topography that most people (including myself) are not aware of.  They go from parts of the Gobi desert to high altitude mountainous regions to forested parts & scenic riverways.  All along the journey we experience the pitfalls such as culture shock / red tape, motorcycle wipeouts, vehicle breakdowns and foul weather.

For anyone who has a passing interest in China as a country or in the myriad locations therein, this disc is highly recommended.

is it good or bad?
I'll make the provider/author
either happy or sad...........
and sometimes even mad.

A copy of this DVD was offered to me in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.  I took them up on the offer because I expected a fairly in-depth geographical lesson about China, a giant sprawling country that spans jungles, deserts, endless plains, and mountains.  What better and more comfortable way to see China but from the back of two motorcycles on an epic journey covering 18,000 kilometers in 65 days.  They gave me that highly visual tour while encountering repetitive and unanticipated problems beginning on Day One, all the while (well, mostly anyway) cheerfully narrating the trip in English.

This DVD seems to be an edited version of their trip cut into several episodes that might have been planned for a television series.  The running time is approximately 156 minutes.  Adding in 8-10 minutes for each 30 minute segment would result in around six installments--should they be able to sell them.  I think that the problem though is that potential viewers are more wrapped up in the various survival shows currently playing in prime time.  Hearing Colin and Ryan Pyle commenting on how ""difficult"" this hard trip was on them pales before shows such as ""Naked And Afraid"".  Now that is hardship.  I'm not saying that the Pyles had it easy, but worrying about getting the right parts to repair their motorcycles doesn't seem to be on the same difficulty level as having to find and kill your next meal.

I applaud the exposure that the brothers brought concerning the people, geography, and various rules that the Chinese live with.  Their presentation was very educational especially for someone who will never have the chance to tour China.  And I thank them for that.",1443398400,,1821,4.908496732026144

I learned a incredible amount about china. You can tell that this is a story made with love about this country.
I had no real idea what china was like. All we ever see is a few stories here and there and generally about negative things.

This gave me a real idea of just how varied a place China is and how beautiful. The people they met was very nice and it was good to see that.
I felt bad for the mishaps they had, and I was really happy that they turned out ok.
I also found it to be really funny at times especially when dealing with the frustrations of getting a GPS in China.
It was enlightening to see how motorcycle riders are treated differently.
I did not expect that. I always thought most people rode motorcycles in China. Evidently that is not the case in todays world.

6983831,4,B00SH0513Q,"This is a review of Tough Rides: India on Blu-ray Disc. I received a free copy of the disc for my unbiased review. The opinions expressed are my own.

Compared to the previous Pyle brothers adventure in China on DVD, Tough Rides: India is a much more slickly produced disc, but this adventure is on Blu-ray Disc, not DVD.

As a travelog of their motorcycle adventure that takes the brothers  on a 14,000km circumnavigation of India, it largely succeeds. The video quality is mostly spectacular... the scenery is breathtaking. The storytelling leaves me with some questions though.

There is great video both first person point-of-view while riding the motorcycles as well as from the film crew that accompanied the brothers. However I feel that the opportunity to explore the cultural details of India more deeply was not fully realized. I still do not know what types of food the brothers ate... very little idea of what their accommodations were like... things like that.

The documentary does a nice job of chronicling the various challenges the brothers face on their journey... everything from heavy traffic, animals in the road to severe weather and washed out roads.

The episodes were split up nicely with a somewhat too long recap of the previous episodes preceding each new episode.

If you have read the book, this disc adds so much more than just reading the book alone. If you have not read the book, then this disc stands alone and reading the book is probably not going to add much to what was presented in the disc.

I've never traveled to India and it is highly unlikely that I ever will have that opportunity. Being able to see India through the eyes and experience of the Pyle brothers is the closest I'll probably ever come to getting there. It is certainly a disc I enjoyed watching,",1442102400,,1804,4.759615384615385
6983832,5,B00SH0513Q,"This travel adventure follows the Pyle brothers on their extensive journey through India, giving you a very authentic view of the landscapes and cultures that are present there. The filming captures the brothers in a way that feels genuine, as if you are there with them in the moment encountering what they encounter - not like something staged and heavily edited for a TV show. Thus, there is interesting dialogue and comments to go along with the varied scenery and different sorts of people they meet on their motorcycle trek. I've known a variety of people who have traveled to India (usually for spiritual retreats or studies) and they each get to see just a small slice of that country. This travel documentary brings you a lot more of India - some is very scenic and some is not so pleasant looking, while it never gets dull.

I've heard different stories about their life in India and it didn't really make sense until I watched this video. I had no idea of the diversity in climate, topography and culture until now.  I cringed as I watched them wend their way through the crowded streets. I'd heard from my students how dangerous the roads were. Seeing it up close was terrifying. I can only imagine what was going through their minds as they actually drove them.  One thing stood out to me, and that was the beauty of the country. It didn't matter if they were in the mountains, valleys or near the beach, the land was beautiful. Even the barren desert had a beauty to it that I didn't expect. I loved the way they handled all areas of the culture including the religious beliefs of the different people.

6983834,5,B00SH0513Q,"Colin and Ryan Pyle-- brothers and adventures has taken me on one of the exotic trips I have ever had without leaving my living room.

I love adventure shows, especially the Lonely Planet series of the mid 90's.  Then, of course you have The Amazing Race.

I'm familiar with Ryan Pyle from a book on his travel to remote locations in China as well as a Blu Ray disc of his Extreme Treks in China.

But, this is very different than the other works I've seen from Ryan-- and, a welcomed addition.

This is, essentially, a site seeing tour circumnavigating India.

Along the way, the brothers stop into a Hindu temple, talk with Buddhists, have flat tires, get hit by another motorcycle and enjoy exotic foods and even boat along the Gangees River.

I like this kind of adventure a lot more than the Extreme Treks because the pace is a lot faster and the brothers played off of each other very well and it was very entertaining.

Shows like this are both educational and great entertainment.",1441756800,,988,4.5423728813559325
6983835,4,B00SH0513Q,"Note: The agent supplied a review sample for evaluation, the opinion of the production is my own personal view

I previously looked at the Pyle brothers China biking adventure and found it very enjoyable (as a non biker) For this trip the Pyle Bros drop their BMW Motorrad bikes and gear up with a pair of Royal Enfield bikes (this is the Indian arm of Enfield that bough the rights to the British makers name) hand made custom bikes the guys are using a well known Indian based manufacturer for their mammoth journey. Their route takes them 14,000 km around the country (the China one was a little longer) it's still a huge ride though and one with many challenges including some very poor weather and road conditions they encounter.

The episodes are split into 6 segments of 30 minutes each and I'm pleased to say the editing is a big improvement on the prior instalment. Not easy to edit down what is probably many hours of footage into 2.5 hours of viewing and I think the production team have done a good job on this. At the start of each 30 minute episode you get a quick recap on the prior events (not too long and unlike the China one they don't recap all the way back just a few minutes of what went on in the last episode compressed into highlights)

Blu ray transfer is to a high level lots of details though a few blowouts at times in harsher lighting. A mix of action camera and from the crew cameras it's well edited for the most part. As you'd expect with such a long trip there are problems (India's roads leave quite a lot to be desired) and the driving conditions in some of the populated areas (Mumbai - also known as Bombay) is quite shocking massive traffic jams and dangerous driving mean even urban rides in this trip are fraught with danger. Two areas I enjoyed (as a non biker) the cultural side to the country and some stunning vistas from the rugged northern mountains to hot desert areas and flash flooding in places too. Weather conditions vary significantly as it's such a large country this presents some challenges for the team. Mechanical problems are par for the course and yes you do get moments where the brothers get down and this is shown clearly. This is a tough ride a little bit of moaning is going to happen they're only human anyone doing a 14k ride isn't likely to do that with a big smiley face through the entire trip! It's hands on and real there isn't any obvious camera play going on here you just see it as it happens good moments and harder ones; that's part of the appeal of the series.

For the most part it's a slick production with some experience from previous trips under their belt they've refined and honed the final production and it shows. If there were any areas to improve I'd say that whilst 2.5 hours seems quite long it's maybe over a little quickly for me I'd have loved to see another couple of episodes included though appreciate editing might not be easy. If you're a biker fan you'll love it no question there but even if you're not the journey reveals some spectacular scenery and insight into the customs and cultures of India which is a very unique country.",1441756800,,3132,4.451219512195122
6983836,5,B00SH0513Q,"Tough Rides: India has been an enjoyable, entertaining and enlightening series of episodes.  I think it is a show that a family can watch together which is a big plus for me.  First of all and most important, brothers Colin and Ryan Pyle are likeable guys that really have nothing offensive or unappealing about them.  They seem to be average guys tackling the monster project of cycling around India.

The scenery is splendid and captures the myriad contexts of India from desolate mountains to bustling mega-cities.  I have enjoyed the visuals and learning about the vastness and varieties of Indian culture -- there is so much there to discover.  Colin and Ryan take readers on the ride that is full of adventures and misadventures. All along the way, they find Indian friends to help them and welcome them.  The traffic in the cities is another thing all together, but they survive the chaos and thrive in the peaceful landscapes.  They approach it all with light-hearted excitement and anticipation.

The brothers invite their audience to discover some of the sights in India along with them, and these are eye-openers to all.  The ceremonies at the India - Pakistan border were breathtaking to observe, as was their visit to the Rat Temple (but for other reasons).

For the brothers, the journey is exhilarating and at times exhausting, and the viewers can vicariously experience it with them.  I received this dvd as a gift in exchange for an honest review.  I have appreciated the series and look forward to watching the previous and future journeys.  I commend them to you, even if you have no familiarity with the Pyle brothers or motorcycle riding; I think anyone would enjoy these.",1441670400,,1693,4.874125874125874
6983837,5,B00SH0513Q,"If you have any interest in Indian Culture, then you're sure to enjoy this series. Basically two brothers circumnavigate India, hitting all the main cultural highlights, plus the little out of the way places as well.  You'll get a nice overview of the diversity of India, its people, its languages, its religions. Visit the Golden Temple of the Sikh Religion, and Hindu temples holy to rats, the Shiva temple, and road side festivals sacred to Ganesha. Go to Bodhgaya, and see the Bodhi tree, where Siddhartha Gautama (Lord Buddha) obtained Nirvana. Discover the banks of the Ganges, where people wash their bodies next to human cremations, and of course the Taj Mahal, built by the Muslim Mughal king for his wife. The colors are vibrant, the landscapes diverse, and the people always friendly and kind. Then, you get to see poverty unlike anything seen in the USA. Utter destitution, dirt, the ghettos of Mumbai, ramshackle roads, or the small towns, where everybody lives in a shack. I don't know how they didn't kill themselves driving those bikes, on those roads. Seriously, the traffic in India was unbelievable. As in England, they drive on the left side of the road. And the middle. And the right side. Or, they just stop, and you drive around them. If watching these bikes dodge cars, motorbikes, little kids, and flooded roads isn't enough, you can always have fun saying ""Holy Cow!"" every time they avoid hitting one of the cows that roam the streets. (The Cow is an incarnation of Shiva. Shiva has 108 different names.) Maybe the oddest temple they visited, was the famous rat temple. Ryan petted the rats for good karma, while Colin his brother was so disgusted he marched out of the rat temple. Guess which one got food poisoning the next day? Colin. (The Great Wheel of Karma.)

I had watched the other documentary that Ryan Pyle did, the Sacred Mountains of China. In that series, Ryan is walking around these sacred mountains. The filming is magnificent, the pace is slow, but utterly beautiful. Even the music is this sonorous, languid new age music for the China mountains series. Tough Rides India is the flip side of the coin. The pace is fast. The music often techno. Instead of marvelous cinematography, you get a lot of GoPro shots, or filming from their support vehicle. Instead of watching India from a walking perspective, its flying by often at 60MPH. I'm not suggesting that this series isn't as realized as the China series. Its just so totally different. However, both series bring you a wealth of information about the religion and culture of those countries.  If you wish to visit India, and not just a couple of tourist traps, then this series will show you that country in great detail. Ryan remarked that one needed to see past the nerve wracking traffic, and poverty, so you wouldn't let the negativity overwhelm you. If you don't  look past the bad parts, you wouldn't be open to the beauty and culture that is India. Apparently the dichotomy of poverty, combined with spiritual riches, is the very heart of India and its people. Visit India with the Touch Ride brother team, you'll find yourself enjoying the elephants in the refuge, the charity of Seva Foundation, the numerous religions and temples, and more than anything, the simple kindness of strangers. I found that I learned a lot about India, that you cant absorb by just listening to Sitar music, drinking Chai, and reading the Upanishads and Dhammapada.

8698320,3,B00SH0513Q,"Indie Long Way Round/Down - that's what pops in my mind thus far. It's unfair to compare the two shows - Round and Down featured Obi Wan and considerably larger budgets. But it's impossible to ignore the parallels.

These guys had an opportunity to capitalize on being a smaller production - more interactions with locals, explorations of local towns, normal food, etc. For example, the yurt village scene - some tourists (I presume) are singing karaoke. The video was shot from the back, seemingly incognito style, with neither brother interacting. That's a missed opportunity for great cultural and entertainment value. It doesn't matter if you don't speak Chinese. Learn a few phrases and put them to use. They'll reciprocate and everyone will have fun.
There's another scene with a mudslide. It's another missed opportunity to interact.
And the traffic mess... I was turned off by the bad attitude. Barking at some Chinese truck driver in English - do you expect him to understand English?! Imagine what that sounds like to him! You're guests in their country and live privileged lives compared to many (you are after all, riding around China on new BMW touring bikes!)- show respect and be more humble.
