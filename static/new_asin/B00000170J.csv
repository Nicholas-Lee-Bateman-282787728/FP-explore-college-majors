He is fairly young in the video and it has very candid moments with him at his home at Lake Simcoe playing his good old Chickering as Panquil, his dog, sits by his side as Glenn performs an amazing rendition of Bach's Contrapunctus I which as far as I know is not on any of his cds. There are also scenes of Glenn in the studio at work not only performing  Bach's Italian concerto and listening to playback but also featuring his singing back the rhythm almost perfectly during playback. Other parts of the video include him talking about Webern and Atonal music, his growing up, and his playing. I know this film was shot fairl early in his career because at the end he discusses an upcoming recording of the two part inventions. There is also a fairly amusing scene in the Steinway gallery where he goes to pick a Piano for his recording and they joke about his special chair. A very touching memoir for one of the great and innovative pianists of the Twentieth Century.",1020816000,,1125,4.461165048543689
