This DVD is one of a series of DVD imports from a company named Laser Media which compiles various TV appearances of a performer - often captured from TV broadcasts - and presented with no opening or ending credits and providing no date as to when the performance was captured. In this case it's Dolly Parton - who recorded her first record at age 11 and is now 68 years old (can you believe it?).

The videos don't go back that far but there is at least one clip - maybe more - from her appearance on the Porter Wagoner TV show from the 1970s. (Dolly was on 218 episodes of the show between 1967 and 1975).  The 41 minute DVD contains 13 performances and they are not presented chronologically. I was able to identify one clip as Dolly's appearance on Austin City Limits. It was March 27, 2001 and the band Nickel Creek opened for her on the hour long show. Mandolin player Chris Thile hung around to join other musicians - including Fiddle Player Stuart Duncan to back up Dolly. Her version of ""Little Sparrow"" here comes from that show (there's even the logo og the TV station that aired it in the corner).  There's another clip with Thile and Jerry Douglas backing her up. Both these are the musical highlights. You can tell how old the clips are by the size of her wigs, and in both the early and later ones you actually get to see her play the guitar, rather than just hold a microphone.

One performance is a real dud - ""Me and Little Andy"" (from a Wagoner show?) is silly and sappy and makes Dolly come off as a ""dumb blonde"" - which she isn't. The duet with Kenny Rogers is from a performance in a Portland, OR arena from their 1985 tour and includes some cute back-and-forth dialog between them.

The quality of the footage (all in standard format) varies from fair to good. Nothing is shar and the sound blasts on the early numbers.

Many folks might rate this  DVD two stars (I Don't Like It) but I'm raising mine to three because - other than the Austin City Limits performance, I have not seen the other and finding good video of Dolly in her early days is not easy to find. So I was entertained. But won't run back to watch this again.

(added note 8/13/14) See T. Gordon's ""comment"" for the source of the videos here - Thanks T)

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
