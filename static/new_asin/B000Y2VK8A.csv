8230884,5,B000Y2VK8A,"This is a classic - some of the best action scenes (two of the fights have beeb rated top ten) if that is your interest, but also a blend of humour and tragedy best found in Hong Kong films- children who suffer terribly then resinvent themselves or find theselves as in this case gamblers, in other films master thiefs, criminals, forming a family or like to create an unbreadable whole. You can watch this film forever - it never gets old. And some of the top perforances for these tars esp Leon Lai. Chan was maybe better in the Who's A Woman series but then who wasn't? When you are down and out, this is the film to watch - and the scenes when Chan has to save the ones he loves and also get some clothes on is fluid, beautiful and of course tragic, this is Hong kong where you must never form attachments to the actors, as noone is safe in a Hong Kong film. One of my all time favorites in all categories.",1338595200,,910,4.176136363636363
8230885,4,B000Y2VK8A,"A good spin off of Chow Yun Fat character from God of Gamblers.  Tells the backstory of Ko and Wolf. Overall, it's funny and entertaining.  Worth to watch and to add to the collection.  Not a bad job from Leon's part.",1193788800,,217,4.2439024390243905
