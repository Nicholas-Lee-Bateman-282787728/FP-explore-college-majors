8128445,5,B000G1N9YW,"This book was bought as a gift for a friend.  Although I can't review it, Arlene says it is fantastic.  She is quite a fan of laroche-both books and dvds.  It gives her time to laugh at the world and at herself.",1298419200,,211,3.9761904761904763
8128446,5,B000G1N9YW,"This was my first introduction to Loretta LaRoche.  I found this DVD entertaining, humourous and thought provoking.  It was a wonderful reminder to choose to live life with joy and optimism.",1242000000,,190,5.096774193548387
8128447,2,B000G1N9YW,"I've seen Loretta LaRoche in person several times. While the content of her lectures is always the same, the DVD can't compare with the in-person delivery. Overall, I found the DVD uninspiring and long. Also, the production quality was not high - it was like I was watching something a friend had taped from PBS.

I'm not discrediting Loretta LaRoche. I am recommending that if this is going to be your first experience, you try her newer DVD (which I haven't seen yet - but it's got to be better than this).",1161734400,6,508,4.521739130434782
