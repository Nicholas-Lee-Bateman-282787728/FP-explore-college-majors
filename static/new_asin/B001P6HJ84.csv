THE PICTURE IS AMAZING AND THE SOUND IS AMAZING TOO!

Note: Listen to the initial Electro-acoustic Gibson guitar on ""Black Water"" song, IT'S REALLY HEAVEN IN YOUR EARS! Buy it and enjoy it!",1250726400,8,371,4.707692307692308
3740786,5,B001P6HJ84,"I am listening to this blu ray concert as I'm writing, it feels as if I am RIGHT THERE in the audience in the front row.  What a GREAT dvd concert!  This is the way blu ray should look and sound.  If you are a Michael McDonald fan or a Doobie Brothers fan PLEASE do not miss owning this blu ray concert.  It is hard to find.  The concert is a Soundstage Production and can be found at most Sears stores(yes, you've read correctly) and on line.  It's a great find and a must have for any fan!",1239753600,14,491,3.9591836734693877

8332368,4,B001P6HJ84,"We run this concert in our store everyday. It's playing on around 30 TV's at a time, round the clock, from open to close. It was okay at first, because my dad's a huge Doobie Brothers fan, but it's gotten pretty old after seeing it a thousand times. The customers seem to like it, though, so the manager leaves it in there.",1383523200,,323,4.225806451612903
8332369,5,B001P6HJ84,A beautiful concert in sound and visual. I would recommend this blu-ray to my friends and family. If you like great music..get it,1357776000,,129,4.6521739130434785
8332370,1,B001P6HJ84,"I purchasted this concert for my wife who is a big Michael McDonald fan.  We opened the wine, set the lights low, put the Blu-Ray in the player and it finally opened to the set-up/play menu and nothing.  No matter what I tried I could not get it to play beyond this point.  I own hundreds of DVD, dozen of Blu-Rays and this is the only one that this has happened with.  And I did not return it to Amazon because their return/refund policy is terrible.  We did enjoy the wine though and put on Chocolat instead.  This isn't the first time I have received faulty merchandise from Amazon, hence the knowledge regarding their return procedure.  Better luck to you if you purchase this DVD.",1285804800,,685,4.432
8332371,5,B001P6HJ84,"I was looking for a Doobie Brothers concert on Blu Ray , building up my musical Blu Ray collection & now running out room and happen to read good reviews about this concert with Michael McDonald and wasn't disappointed is as good as they say with a pretty good clear picture & sound with especial guests like Asford & Simpson and Dobbie Brothers Patrick Simmons & Tom Johnston & good band & backing Singers with a Female drummer Who's pretty good too playing tracks like , It Keeps You Runnin' , Sweet Freedom , I keep Forgettin' , I Heard IT Through The Grapevine ,Ain't No Mountain High Enough , Ain't Nothin' Like The Real Thing , Black Water <- another favorite , Take Me in Your Arms (Rock Me A Little While ), Minute by Minute , What A Fools Believes and Takin' It To The Streets ... Good Show Recommended .",1285200000,2,813,4.3202614379084965

8332373,4,B001P6HJ84,"This is an excellent, if short, concert with Michael McDonald and long-time Doobie Brothers joining in along with some surprise guests.

Everyone sounds great and the presentation has an excellent transfer (both video and audio).  The only disappointment is the concert is less than an hour long.  But it's a solid hour of classic rock with no junk filler.

Highly recommended blu-ray.",1280361600,,385,5.161290322580645
8332374,5,B001P6HJ84,The only thing I didn't like was that it was to short. For all the music he has recorded the concert should have been 2 hours.,1271462400,,126,3.8846153846153846
