6356272,1,B00JESB64I,This was a good idea but didn't work at all. Get a better story writer. The acting was really bad.,1397779200,2,98,3.95
8650347,1,B00JESB64I,Seems like they had about a $100 budget to do this movie and it shows.,1530403200,,70,3.7333333333333334
8650348,1,B00JESB64I,"We bought this film along with several other family movies to watch with our young children. This was, by far, the worst movie I have ever seen. We literally watched the movie for 30 minutes before we could bear no more. My husband ejected it and gave it to a friend as a prank. The cover has nothing to do with anything in the film. The movie appears to be recorded by a child with a Sony handycam or perhaps a phone. It bounces and shakes, blurs in and out, and the volume also cuts in and out.",1521849600,,496,4.071428571428571
8650349,1,B00JESB64I,"This movie was terrible. The is minimal mention of God (I think once he says ""God gave me an idea), they are seen coming out of church, there is a bible on the side table. They don't pray or talk about God beyond that. It's wholesome in that there is no swearing or sexuality, but beyond that don't be fooled. The camera work is terrible, shaky at times and a few scenes were blurry. The acting for the most part is awful, the kids did the best of any of them. The story can even be tough to follow sometimes, especially for kids. This was a complete waste of my evening.
I agree with others that indicate the cover is nothing like the movie.",1480204800,,642,4.185483870967742
8650350,2,B00JESB64I,"I could not believe there was no caption to this movie.( as a friend of mine has trouble hearing.), The ending was terrible.",1438300800,,124,4.434782608695652
8650351,3,B00JESB64I,really didn't show where the farm was saved or not,1432339200,,50,4.1
8650352,1,B00JESB64I,"I can only wholeheartedly agree with the other reviews here.  The WORST movie I think our family has ever seen.  We actually finished it to see if it would redeem itself at all, but it absolutely did not.  If I could I'd give it no stars at all.  This movie should never have been made.",1424649600,,286,4.1454545454545455
8650353,1,B00JESB64I,"Wish I would have read and listened to others reviews, they were spot on. About 30 minutes into this movie we ejected it and threw it straight in garbage can. The most awful movie ever. And nothing like cover and description say!",1420156800,3,229,4.476190476190476
8650354,1,B00JESB64I,"Terrible movie - don't buy this film! The cover has nothing to do with the film whatsoever - which is very interesting. I guess the film is so bad that they needed a hook, line, and sinker to bait sales for this rotten fish of a movie. The film is poorly written and brings to closure no redeeming quality or point at all. There are so many loose ends left undone. The parents are vacant, depressing, and drone-like...as are most of the characters.  Everyone just mopes around emotionless. This movie is just plain weird.  There is no mention of God or Faith, or any other redeeming  quality. The young girls are immodestly dressed. This was a terrible waste of  money. Wow - there is just  so much wrong with this film, I could just go on. I'm shocked that the Dove foundation gives this their approval and a strong recommendation.",1412553600,3,832,4.52
8650355,1,B00JESB64I,"Save your money! Video quality was very poor and even though it says it's a faith based movie it had little to no mention of God. I find the cover of the DVD intriguing because the movie depicts nothing of a man, lady, little girl or a dog. A low budget film with a poor story writer.",1411257600,3,284,4.0
8650356,1,B00JESB64I,"I like that it is Christian based, and a good wholesome family film that is rare to see these days. However, while young children may find it entertaining, as an adult, I did not. The acting is terrible, and it left a lot of loose ends. Intriguing premise, but it just didn't work here.",1400112000,3,286,4.314814814814815
