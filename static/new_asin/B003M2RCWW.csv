As usual with these IMMORTAL/ZOOM label imports and their corresponding US counterparts HUDSON/STREET DVD's, it looks mastered of a VHS tape at best, which is a crying shame because the concert itself is well shot and lit, and would've been worth the extra price if done right.  As is now, it's nothing but a travesty...AVOID!",1455840000,3,617,6.333333333333333

8400013,3,B003M2RCWW,"a long-time fan of the well-known line-up, i was surprised at how loose the band had become at this point in the band's once-illustrious career. some of the vets remained with new supporting players (like 'blue' lou marini, later to be part of the 'blues brothers').  vocalist jerry fisher did okay on the later stuff (like ""snow queen"") but was clearly not right for the band's signature songs (most of which are absent from this recording...what's up with that?) sloppy and amateurish at times, i found few bright spots which is especially sad for a band once known for musical excellence. it was a major mistake not finding a david clayton-thomas-type vocalist to replace thomas and the sound suffered as a result. i enjoy the dvd strictly from a historical point of view but lament no video recordings of the hit-years line-up. i'll take what i can get...",1313280000,4,859,4.804054054054054
