8265681,5,B0017CW5S0,"Gung Ho keeps you laughing and enjoying the spirit of the American worker, as well as respecting the spirit of the Japanese worker.  A must see.  I miss that America.",1328227200,,166,4.5
8265682,5,B0017CW5S0,"Yup, this movie has all those actors and more in it. Back before some of them got too big for their britches and others fell off the star map into obscurity.

I thoroughly enjoy Gung Ho. I've watched it at least a dozen times throughout the years.

A good comedy movie with a few serious points. Culture clash ensues and we see how both sides compromise and learn from each other and themselves.

I've seen the second movie on this disc ""Jimmy Hollywood"" and while it wasn't total garbage, it also really isn't worth watching more than once in my opinion unless you are a huge Pesci or Slater fan.

The main reason I bought this DVD is for Gung Ho. Now I can watch it whenever I want.",1326153600,,684,4.27906976744186
8265683,5,B0017CW5S0,Hard to find Gung Ho anywhere on DVD. Always loved this movie and fits with how we are feeling in the current consumer market and in the jobs market as well. The other movie is a waste and boring...,1282953600,6,198,4.102564102564102
8265684,5,B0017CW5S0,"""Gung Ho"" is a great Michael Keaton movie! It has a lot to say about today's abhorrent ""Lean Manufacturing"" concepts. What were once silly ideas from the far east (worthy of a laugh or two)are now sweeping the factories of the U.S.A. These dehumanizing, deindividualizing and thoroughly demeaning concepts are great sport, however, in this hilarious send-up of east-meets-west car manufacturing.",1258329600,2,395,5.491803278688525
8265685,4,B0017CW5S0,"If you are in business, this is a must see.
