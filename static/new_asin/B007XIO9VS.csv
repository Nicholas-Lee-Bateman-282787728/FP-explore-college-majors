8522919,1,B007XIO9VS,"The whole story surrounds around one little girl who tragically makes the mistake of thinking a movie producer ruined her life. this is not a scary story, but a tragic and awful tall tail, with the idea of film producers and how they screw the people over that they work with. The acting is very uninspired, in fact the lead girl needs to show more psychotic rage and anger to me. She was not believable. The camera work is not shot to professional standards, but it's not supposed to be professional so that's a moot point. or not...
There is little context in the first hour, then we are shown at the very end why this movie was supposed to be great...I will not give it away, but it's about her own father. SAAAAAD film!",1383523200,,723,4.362962962962963
8522920,3,B007XIO9VS,"I guess I just expected more.  I watched it to the end, but when it was over I questioned that decision.  Most of the scenes that were evidently meant to be scary or gory were just ridiculous.  The acting was second, possibly third rate and the script should've been burned.  All in all, this movie was a total waste of precious minutes out of my life.  Pass it by.",1378512000,,365,4.231884057971015
8522921,1,B007XIO9VS,"Dumb, just Dumb......................Maybe there are people into B movie type shows I'M NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wouldn't recommend it unless you are. It starts weird which set up the stage for dismissal 1/3 into the movie.......No Thanks I will cut my loses on this one. However, Amazon has movies that suits all types of personality andn that's why we continue coming back to view their broad spectrum of cinematic theatre :):):):):):)",1377993600,,436,5.333333333333333
8522922,5,B007XIO9VS,"I love scary movies and this one kept me on the edge of my seat...with a rapidly beating heart!!!
Don't watch this alone...unless you're brave!!!
Excellent direction, acting, cinematography plus an awesome soundtrack featuring the band Jed's Dead!
Perfect for my upcoming Halloween party!!",1376352000,3,289,5.590909090909091
8522923,5,B007XIO9VS,"Excellent independent film!  I am not a horror film fan; yet I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  This may be a work of fiction; however, it is very plausible to see this plot line explode on the six o'clock news one day.",1376352000,2,218,4.2926829268292686
