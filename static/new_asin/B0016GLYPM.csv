8262331,3,B0016GLYPM,"SCHOOL OF FEAR follows the exploits of a group of bratty students at a boarding school. One boy in particular seems to be hated by certain teachers, as well as by some other students. His name is Kurrat, and when he turns up missing, the faculty seeks to solve the mystery without involving the police. When the police arrive unexpectedly, it is revealed that Kurrat's father has also disappeared! Then, the decapitated body of a staff member is discovered in a nearby canal. Is Kurrat alive? If so, is he the killer? Soon, more death occurs. While not the worst movie ever made, it is somewhat long-winded and silly. The camera work is hilarious, w/ sudden, drastic zooms filling in for any real drama. This is accentuated by the overwrought soundtrack. Still, it's watchable enough to justify a viewing. Plus, the surprise ending is a good one...",1393113600,4,848,4.775510204081633

8262333,2,B0016GLYPM,"I guess the story here is pretty fair:  A teacher at a boy's boarding school is someone other than who he appears to be, and when someone finds out, he must protect himself using any means possible, including murder.

The DVD though, seems to be the real horror here.  There are missing bits, dialog and action jumps, and obviously some scenes have been cut, and not particularly well.  Televista/Substance/etc. quality runs from ""not bad"" to ""really bad"" and this one, unfortunately, falls into the latter category.  There are times when it looks quite good & then action & dialog jump ahead with missing words and actions that are very frustrating.  Not recommended...I would like to see this film with a proper transfer, though.  2 out of 10.",1219276800,6,745,4.818897637795276
