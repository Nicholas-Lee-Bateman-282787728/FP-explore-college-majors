8546088,1,B00A1TJ74K,"I ordered the Prometheus Blu-ray / DVD / Ultraviolet Collector's LIMITED EDITION Includes Photo Book With Production Art and Photos ""Prometheus: The Art of the Film"" the only problem is, it did NOT include the book! It was a gift and no, I do not wish to return it for a refund, I want the book Prometheus: The Art of the Film by Mark Salisbury and Ridley Scott sent to me in time for Chanukah but for some reason there is no options available to contact the seller directly, which infuriates me. I paid $50.00 for this item when I could have bought just this edition of the movie from any number of other sellers for much less, but you advertised it as coming with the book, that it does not. I am very upset. Next stop: report false advertizing to amazon.",1385164800,28,757,4.338028169014085
