6860324,4,B00Q7SLCLA,"1.) The New Age Outlaws vs The Ascension

This was a filler match put on the PPV after The Ascension had an epic encounter with the NWO, APA, and The Outlaws at Raw Reunion. The Outlaws still looked in good shape for their age and still moved around in the ring well. The Ascension stay in control most of the match over Road Dogg, Billy Gunn gets the hot tag with a comeback but The Ascension put him down with the Fall of Man for the win. Standard opening match and a nice match to finally get people to start taking The Ascension seriously

2.) WWE Tag Team Championship Match: The Miz and Mizdow vs The Usos (c)

I really enjoyed this match and it seemed that the crowd did as well....mostly large in part due to Mizdow's antics. Miz refuses to tag in Mizdow for the duration of the match due to Mizdow's popularity with the crowd, building more dissension between them both. The Miz works the entire match himself, almost winning the titles on a couple of occasions. In the end, Miz is taken out with a double team finishing move from Jey and Jimmy and The Usos retain the titles. This turned out to be a fun and entertaining match-up

3.) The Bella Twins vs Natalya and Paige

They should've had a Diva's Championship match on the PPV anyway instead of a Tag Team match. I'm not sure why they don't have the Diva's Title defended at the Royal Rumble anymore but it's whatever. This was a surprisingly decent divas tag match. Both teams get some shots in on each other but the Bellas end up working over Natalya for majority of the match. Brie prevents Paige from tagging and Nikki knocks Natalya out with a right forearm for the win. Decent tag match that got a fair amount of time on a PPV. Hopefully they get more time like this going forward so they can improve with each step

4.) WWE World Heavyweight Championship Triple Threat Match: John Cena vs Seth Rollins w/J&J Security vs Brock Lesnar (c) w/Paul Heyman

Originally supposed to be Brock Lesnar vs John Cena for the title, the company played it smart by adding Seth Rollins to the mix as it made the build-up for the match much more exciting and made the match itself much less predictable as to who would win as all 3 competitors had a chance of winning. Lesnar had gotten jacked since his last match at Night of Champions and literally looked like a best (more than ever) in this match. Lesnar dominates early with german suplexes on Rollins and Cena. He even double german suplexes J&J Security which was hilarious. There were tons of bumps and close calls in this match. Probably the most memorable one is Rollins diving off the turnbuckle on to Brock Lesnar through the Spanish Announce Table. The end comes with Rollins nailing Lesnar twice with the MITB briefcase. Rollins attempts to Curb Stomp Lesnar on the briefcase but Lesnar counters with an impressive F5 to retain the title. This was a really great and exciting match and undoubtedly the first of many potential match of the years for 2015. The crowd was extremely pro-Lesnar which was shocking as I don't remember the last time a crowd was that in to Lesnar, if ever

4.) 2015 Royal Rumble Match

The moment everyone was waiting for had arrived. Who was winning the Rumble and going to main event Wrestlemania for the WWE Championship? Going in, there were various favorites fans had picked to win. Bray Wyatt, Dean Ambrose, Roman Reigns, Dolph Ziggler, and Daniel Bryan were the top 5 favorites for the match. Of course no Royal Rumble match these days is done without a few surprise returns and appearances. The Miz entered at #1 and R-Truth was #2. Things got exciting in a hurry when Bubba Ray Dudley entered at #3 making his first appearance at a WWE event since One Night Stand in 2005. The first favorite to enter was Bray Wyatt at #5 who along with Luke Harper (#4) work to eliminate the Dudley. Bray Wyatt pretty much dominated the Rumble this year, lasting the longest of everyone else and eliminated quite a few people, including Daniel Bryan who was #10. Unfortunately Bryan was eliminated way too soon and the moment he was eliminated the crowd's excitement dwindled greatly and booed and chanted for Bryan for the remainder of the match. The Boogeyman made an appearance at #7 and DDP made an appearance at #14. Roman Reigns enters at #19 to a mixed reaction, mostly boos though. Dean Ambrose was #25 and Dolph Ziggler was #30. The crowd seemed to revive a bit of their energy once Ambrose and Ziggler were in but after they were eliminated it was officially downhill for the remaining minutes of the PPV. Roman Reigns eliminates Big Show, Kane, and Rusev to win the 2015 Royal Rumble. The Rock makes an appearance after the match and helps him fight off Kane and Show before raising his cousin's hand and allowing Reigns. Unfortunately for Reigns, the Philly crowd would have none of his victory and boos him out the door to take the PPV off the air

Overall: What a Rumble! It's been quite a few years since the Royal Rumble PPV was good top to bottom. All the undercard matches did well and the WWE Championship Triple Threat match was A+. The Royal Rumble had some nice surprises with the returns of Bubba Ray Dudley, The Boogeyman, and DDP. Whether you enjoyed the Royal Rumble match really depends on who you were pulling for. Reigns got more boos than Batista did at last year's Rumble and equal the amount of boos that Cena got at Money In The Bank in Chicago and the 2006 One Night Stand PPV in New York. There were even riots in the parking lot after the PPV! I didn't agree with how early Bryan was eliminated as he should've been one of the last ones in the match. Unfortunately most people will probably overreact and say that the 2015 Royal Rumble is the worst WWE PPV of 2015 and give it low ratings simply because of Reigns winning, when in fact it was actually a decent PPV. As mentioned, the undercard matches and WWE Championship match did very well and the Royal Rumble match wasn't that bad. Although much of the energy died after Bryan was eliminated. There's still time for WWE to turn it around though. Just remember the original Wrestlemania 30 main event and what it ended up becoming. Anyways, I personally give the 2015 Royal Rumble a 4/5 stars",1422230400,2,6671,4.907719609582964

6860326,3,B00Q7SLCLA,"Only really worth it for the Triple Threat match which was an absolute classic. Other than that everything else was mediocre or downright terrible (The Rumble match itself). Granted the rumble had some cool surprise entrants, but it was an atrociously booked Rumble outside of those surprise entrants. Fan favorite wrestlers get tossed to the side like garbage which the guy hardly anyone wanted to win...won and the crowd completely turned on the match. First with shock and then with anger that only continued to build as the fan favorites were tossed one by one.

The rest of the matches are okay to amusing (Mizdow vs. the Usos. Divas etc). Oh and the Triple 3 Threat match up is hella good/worth the price alone. Thumbs up. :-)",1424563200,,490,4.157894736842105
6860330,5,B00Q7SLCLA,"I have to disagree with the first reviewe here, this years royal rumble was again awsome. In fact the 2013, 2014. and 2015 rumbles are the only ones relevent in recent years.  This year had the major triple threat match main event, Seth rollins, Vs. John Cena, VS. Brock Lesner.  This was and is the best triple threat match I have ever seen including the superstars involved in the match.  The match quickly  turned into utter chaos a all out extreme rules triple threart brawl.  The crowd said it all that night that match was awsome, Epic Epic match.  Now that alone gets 5 stars.  But this years undercard gave us nostalga including in the rumble match itself.  The assention vs the New age out laws true attitude era nostalga match for any longtime fan new fans just don't understand the significance of that match.  The other tag team and diva match were undercard matches that I agree but decent matches nontheless.  The rumble match itself really set the stage for the new stars in WWE as they stood alone this year in the rumble.  WIth only a few surprises nothing major like the past 2 years.  But what you got was again nostalga Appearances by the Boogeyman, and Diamond dallas page to name a couple.  Dont forget about the rock screwing triple H at the end.  In the end roman reighns wins the rumble and sets the stage for alot of other superstars in 2015 and for himself at wrestlemania.  Whats cool abot reighns winning the rumble is that everyone thought daniel bryan would be the winner now we have a potential wrestlemania main event we never even gave a thought to Romen reighns vs Brock Lesner for the title.  Which will be an all out war another epic match in the works just like the rumble.  Thats why this ppv gets 5 stars.  Believe that.",1424044800,2,1760,4.4984227129337535

The Bellas-Paige and Natalya-tag team match while bad,it still felt a filler bout. The 3 Way World Title Match: Champion Brock Lesnar vs. John Cena vs. Seth Rollins was hard-hitting,smash-mouth,wild,heart-pounding,nail-biting brawl. The 2015 Royal Rumble match was poorly booked & forced despite some pretty good wrestling with a bad booked finish to boot. I give this PPV 4 out of 10.",1423180800,,596,5.154639175257732
6860333,3,B00Q7SLCLA,"New Age Outlaws vs. The Ascension - The Outlaws took the early control constantly taking their opponents off their feet before The Ascension cut the ring in half isolating one man away from his partner working him over with double teaming in a match that was very short but did it's job in giving The Ascension their first legitimate win against one of the legendary tag teams they've been referencing since their debut.

WWE Tag Team Champions The Usos vs. The Miz & Damien Mizdow - Miz started out the match while Mizdow continued to copy everything he did to the crowds approval & The Usos having a chuckle at it resulting in The Miz continuing to tease but ultimately refusing to tag him in & only used him when as a human shield against The Usos trademark offense as this was pretty much the same match they've been having for the past few weeks (including the previous PPV) where the match was a background to the bigger story of Miz starting to resent Mizdow's popularity as this was a glorified handicap match.

Natalya & Paige vs. Bella Twins - Natalya & Paige started out in control including some teamwork such as a double suplex while Natalya showcased her superior strength such lifting one of the Bella on her shoulders from a dead squat position while the Bellas used classic tag team wrestling tactics in keeping one member of the team away from her partner in their half of the ring while working her over as either individuals or together. I'll give the divas credit in that this match was given more time that you would normally get from a divas tag match (outside of NXT) but it was pretty flat & dry for the most part with some botched spots.

WWE Champion Brock Lesnar vs. John Cena vs. Seth Rollins - It should be noted that the crowd was very creative with their John Cena chants during his entrance that gave me flashbacks to when Kurt Angle used to come to the ring. This match was filled with various highlights such as Brock german suplexing anything in sight repeatedly throughout the match weather it was each individual or two at the same time including the first two in the opening seconds or the one that had a nasty landing for one of the opponents, an unlikely alliance made to take out the biggest threat in the match, Seth's aerial assault that even at one point took out both opponents at the same time along with the amazing way he was eventually caught in mid-air & one move he did later on that I don't recall seeing from him in WWE, action spilling to the outside with the ringside environment coming into play including one move that finally eliminated one of the opponents for several minutes, and various counters & reversals to trademark offense. This was definitely the first ""match of the year"" candidate & match of the night.

Royal Rumble Battle Royal - As usual, WWE put together a great ""by the numbers"" video package featuring facts & highlights from the previous Rumble matches but I have to give extra credit in that this was the best one yet as we got facts & figures that we've never gotten before along with J.B.L. continuing to give those extra facts that nobody thinks about (such as Albert/A-Train/Tensai being the most Royal Rumble matches without having one elimination). The various highlights include an ""extreme"" return to WWE after 10 years, the Wyatt Family reunion, ""the eater of worlds"" vs. ""the eater of worms"", one man domination in the match picking off opponents one at a time, another surprise return from a former World Champion that caused J.B.L. to reference yoga of all things, the traditional ""how Kofi Kingston avoided elimination"" spot, Miz & Mizdow, when it got down to the final four...or five?, and without a doubt the biggest moments that will be remembered were was the lack of ring time & elimination of one specific participant had that resulted in the crowd completely turning against this match & the eventual winner both in the arena & on social media to the point where the special surprise guest who appeared couldn't turn the crowd around. I actually enjoyed this match more than the previous years match but it was completely overshadowed by ""the movement"" making their voices heard for the second year in a row.

(Pre-Show) New Day vs. Cesaro & Tyson Kidd - New Day combination here was Kofi & Big E with Xavier Woods on the outside while Kidd & Cesaro had Natalya & Adam Rose with his rosebuds in their corner as New Day showcased their trademark offense double team moves using Big E's strength & Kofi's athleticism including Kofi launched by Big E over Cesaro on the apron onto Kidd on the floor while Cesaro & Kidd used similar strategy to perform such moves as the giant swing into a low dropkick & superplex followed by a springboard elbow in what was actually the best match on the card outside of the main events as both teams evenly matched throughout the contest.

This years event was a ""thumbs in the middle show"" as I enjoyed the Rumble match despite the fan outcry while the WWE Championship match stole the show but the rest of the card was easily forgettable to the point where I said that the pre-show match was the best match on the undercard.",1422921600,,5158,4.6071817192600655

8690796,3,B00Q7SLCLA,"Well what can I say about this year's Royal Rumble??  I think it pretty well disappointed most (if not all) WWE fans!  The best match by far in this one was the triple threat WWE title match, which I think also saved this Royal Rumble from sinking completely!!

1.  New Age Outlaws vs. The Ascension:  I thought this was a terrible match mostly due to the wrong team winning!!  I wasn't impressed with the Ascension team at all - they seemed like Road Warrior wannabes!  New Age Outlaws are MUCH better and it showed in this match - the ending was a complete fluke with the Ascension copying off the Eliminators finishing move for the win!  I think they'd (Ascension) would be better off going to a developmental promotion for a while as I don't think they're nowhere near ready for the big time yet!  This match only gets a 3/10 from me!

2.  Usos vs. Miz/Mizdow (Tag-title match):  Here we go again with another dose of the stupidest gimmick in wrestling history!!  We get the same old routine of Miz not taggin in Sandow and the Usos finally winning!  To the life of me I can't understand why the creative team would want such a talented wrestler to act like a complete idiot all the time!  Very forgettable match:  3/10

3.  Natalya & Paige vs. The Bella Twins:  Well my heart is officially melted now 'cause here come the beautiful Bella Twins!!  Loved their little green outfits!  As far as the match goes it was okay but could have been even better had it not been for a couple of botched spots!  I'm loving Nikki's forearm smash and glad the Bellas got the win!  6/10

4.  Lesnar vs. Cena vs. Rollins (WWE title match):  This match was by far the best on the card and should be considered for match of the year in my opinion!  Lesnar is simply better than anybody on the WWE roster right now!  The only one that comes close in sheer ability would be Randy Orton!  I'll go so far as to say the only wrestler I've seen that can beat him (WWE or TNA) is Kurt Angle!  Anyway this match went back and forth - Lesnar dominating early and then it broke loose completely... they did the spot where Lesnar was supposedly hurt after Rollins (Shawn Michaels, Jr.) did an elbow drop off the top on Lesnar through a table!  He laid there and got some deserved rest - then jumped up and started dominating again!  Eventually got the F-5 on Rollins for the win!!  10/10

5.  Royal Rumble Match:  I thought the only good things about this match were bringing back Bubba Dudley and DDP!  Great to see those two back again - but, why couldn't one of those win the match??  This is why I don't like the RR match - it's wayyyy too predictable!  They do the same thing every year - bringing back some surprise stars, only to have them only last a couple of mins.!  Why couldn't they have the Boogeyman put up a decent fight against Wyatt??  All they did was stare each other down before Wyatt clotheslined and threw Boogeyman over the top!  And what about what happened to Daniel Bryan (the most popular star on the roster) - I think he only lasted about 5 mins.??  Come on!!  No wonder the crowd turned against this match!!  And then the final... Big Show-Kane-Rusev-Reigns... a 5 year old kid could have predicted who the winner would be!!  Reigns is the only face with the biggest push in the bunch!!  Of course he's gonna win!!  I actually thought Rusev should have won - I'd LOVE to see him go 1 on 1 with Lesnar!  But NO - they had to play the predictable card again!  Even the Rock showing up at the end and doing a few spots couldn't get the crowd out of their utter disappointment with this match!  I'll give it a 4/10 only for the appearance of DDP and Bubba Dudley - hey - where was Devon??

Overall this event gets a 5/10 from me.",1431907200,2,3729,4.3304347826086955

ROYAL RUMBLE 2015

1. THE NEW AGE OUTLAWZ VS THE ASCENSION-this was a fun opening contest as some of my favorite teams of all time [possibly favorite] in the New Age Outlaws took on a team I have been enjoying. While short it did have enough time to make both teams look good. The Outlaws would be in control especially when Billy was in the ring while Dogg was the guy needing to make the tag. Still in the end it was Gun who would be taken out and pinned giving The Ascension their first big win over some legends. This match kinda reminded me of classic tag matches. Maybe because the Outlaws were in it or because The Ascension reminds us of some other certain teams.

2.[TAG TITLES]THE USOS VS THE MIZ & DAMIEN MIZDOW-next up we get another tag match which I love and this time the titles are on the line. This match was about Miz and Mizdow and the lack of respect Miz has for Mizdow. Good back and forth affair here with the Usos hitting their trademark spots. They retain the titles after a match of Miz refusing to make the tag.

3. THE BELLAS VS NATALYA & PAIGE-another tag match and I am honestly surprised the crowd wasn't into this one as much as I thought they would be. Considering the competitors into his one I was surprised. The actual wrestling ability of Paige and Natalya in particular and the evil twin thing as their opponents seems like it should have worked. The story here was all about The Bellas dominating Natalya and keeping her from making the tag until getting the win.

4.[WWE TITLE TRIPLE THREAT MATCH]BROCK LESANR VS JOHN CENA VS SETH ROLLINS-a triple threat match for the title and what a match it was. I will even say that I think this match a classic, yes you read that right. The way these three guys worked with each other was great and the match played out wonderfully. The match was violent, technical, aerial and everything in between. Lesnar of course showed off his power and wrestling ability with his various suplexes and vicious attacks. Cena of course kept battling through everything and Rollins showcased his ability to steal shows, kinda like one Shawn Michaels. I also liked how they found a way for Lesnar to be taken out of the match yet stay in it and it made sense. Great match with various high spots and all three looking excellent, Lesnar comes out on top in a hard fought battle.

5. ROYAL RUMBLE-this was a fun Rumble match with various great moments, my favorite being the Wyatt Family reunion and Bray facing off with the returning Boogeyman. Of course we always get the legend appearances, this year it was Bully..err I mean Bubba Ray Dudley and DDP returns. Then of course there is the now infamous Daniel Bryan elimination at the hands of my boy Bray Wyatt. That moment sent the WWE Universe into a tailspin as that is their guy. They reverted back to last years Rumble and hated on this match and its winner big time. Poor Reigns even after being a huge fan favorite prior to his injury, even his cousin Rock couldn't turn the crowd to his favor. Also it didn't help that everyone knew who was going to win this before the event even started. Then when Bryan was eliminated and it came down to those final four or five it was easy to see Vinces plan was going through.

BONUS

1. TYSON KID & CESARO VS THE NEW DAY-for this match New Day members Kofi Kingston and Big E stepped up to wrestle with Woods on the outside. This was a great match with two very talented teams with Natalya and even Adam Rose out there. great back and forth action with Kid and Cesaro coming out on top.

Over all this was a great event full multi wrestler matches, no singles bouts. You get interviews and such on the DVD.",1431734400,,3671,4.412112259970458
