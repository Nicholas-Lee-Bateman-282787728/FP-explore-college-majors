3829620,5,B001Y8DJLY,I bought both IP Man I & IP ManII they both were in excellent condition and great quialty. I bought these for my boyfriend for his birthday and he was so happy.,1286755200,2,160,4.03125
3829621,5,B001Y8DJLY,"Excited about FINALLY getting a decent transfer of this soon to be classic film. This was produced from an HD master for sure!! I swore I had to remember this is DVD, not Blu-ray...that is how prestine the transfer is. It is anamorphic 16:9 2.35 and it looks GREAT upconverted on my Blu-Ray machine to 1080p. Hopefully the Blu-Ray set for release next monty can look as good. Several special features (although have not played any) are included on this beautiful dual layered disc. The sound is awesome even though it promised dts-HD Master (impossible with DVD) and several other HD soundtracks. Appears the menu and slip box were made for the future import Blu-Ray (would love to see what that looks and sounds like!)but with these quibbles aside this was $15 well spent. If you love Hong Kong action films...this is the version to get. Don't wait before its hard to find!",1276128000,6,874,4.718954248366013

8348013,5,B001Y8DJLY,"I love Donnie Yen movies, this movie is touching as well as action packed. Best role he's played so far!",1392854400,,104,4.25
8348014,1,B001Y8DJLY,"Bad quality, grany, not actually 2 moves like I expected to get with this set, but only 1 movie with additional almost worthless disk telling about movie creation, etc. If I knew about that I'd never bother and went another way with another disk for same or lower price. Even Netflix has this movie in the stream in much-much better quality! I'm under impression that this movie was copied from some strange source. If I didn't see a much better stream from N/F I'd never think about this disk this way. Sorry. Lost money.",1302220800,2,522,4.5638297872340425
8348015,5,B001Y8DJLY,I really enjoyed this movie. Donnie Yen really lived up to my expectation. He is on the level of the great Bruce Lee.  I highly recomend this movie and all of Donnie Yen movies.,1294185600,2,177,4.205882352941177
8348016,5,B001Y8DJLY,"I have to admit, I really think that I lucked out on getting this special edition version.

As for the movie, if you are into martial arts films, and if you are into understanding what some of the other less commercial forms of Martial Arts might be about, then this might be a good introduction into the Martial Art known as Wing Chun, which was created by a Nun (her name was Ng Mui) and named after its very first practitioner (here's the history: [...]).

As for a movie, well, sure, it exaggerates a little, as most Martial Arts movies do. But this movie was still VERY entertaining to me, and I enjoyed it immensely.

To simply keep it short, I'm glad to have come across this movie, and I'm sure that I'll enjoy it for years to come. If you like Martial Arts films, as I do, you will enjoy this film and find yourself riveted to your seat, as I was, even though we all know that the hero of the film is always the winner.

If this is not one of my all time favorites, then it is easily within the top 5.",1291939200,2,1010,4.137755102040816
