2885615,5,B000SINSVC,This was an outstanding series that unfortuniately came to an end this past year. I have everyone of the previous dvd's of this series and it is a must have. Extremely funny and you will love the characters. I hope everyone buys this dvd.,1184544000,10,238,4.431818181818182
2885616,5,B000SINSVC,"The finale of The Vicar of Dibley was a two-part special for Christmas 2006 and New Year Day 2007. The writers decided that the best way to send this great series out in style was to marry off Geraldine to the man of her dreams. Part 1 is their meeting and courtship (with some hilarious complications), and part 2 is the wedding. The dreamboat groom is Richard Armitage, currently glowering attractively as Sir Guy of Gisbourne in BBC's Robin Hood. As the fiance, Harry, he is charming, funny, and totally convincing in a romantic role that has to have a light touch. Did I mention that he is heart-stoppingly handsome? I just showed the two-part special to a group of my friends who had no prior knowledge of the series and they were laughing to the point of tears.",1183593600,176,767,4.525179856115108

2885618,5,B000SINSVC,"An instant forever-classic TV show gets a gloriously happy and hilarious finale.  Anything that can make you laugh and cry out loud at the SAME TIME is worth having in your DVD collection.  The funny, smart lady gets the sexy, smart guy in the end--there's a moral to the story to rally around.",1464480000,,294,4.528301886792453
2885619,2,B000SINSVC,"Boring.  First 15 minutes holds great comedy, but devolved to slapstick.  Stick to earlier episodes.  Even the wonderful Richard Armitage can't save this self-loathing storyline.",1464048000,,178,6.04

2885630,5,B000SINSVC,GREAT SHOW!!,1444867200,,12,5.5
2885631,5,B000SINSVC,"both episodes were great because RICHARD ARMITAGE was in them, but my favorite was the first one(the handsome stranger) RICHARD ARMITAGE  was great in this, he was very sexy,handsome,cute, so adorable. I just loved watching him get nervous when he was asking the vicar out, going on the dates , especially when he asked her to marry him, and she acted like it was nothing, you could see all the  expressions going on all through his face,(confusion, sadness, happy,etc.). he was so sexy,adorable.",1444521600,3,496,4.963855421686747

2885633,5,B000SINSVC,It was hilarious! I really enjoyed it. I have never seen Richard Armitage smile so much. He does not look like the same person.,1443484800,,127,4.333333333333333

2885641,5,B000SINSVC,I absolutely love Richard Armitage in the roll of Harry Kennedy. We've seen Richard in roles like Thorin Oakenshield and in Robin Hood. It's refreshing seeing him as just a normal man that falls to the parish Vicar. This is a very funny show. I remember watching it on public television. It's a British comedy so some of the jokes you might not understand but the whole show is very funny.,1431216000,,389,4.492957746478873

2885644,5,B000SINSVC,"Ever since I found out that Richard Armitage guest starred in this sitcom, I immediately watched it on Netflix. Over and over again. So I decided to get my own copy. And I did. Not only that, I bought the Divine Collection as well. I love the cast of The Vicar of Dibley! The comedic timing is just spot on and will make you fall in love in their small community. Start watching one of the episodes, you'll find yourself wanting more.",1430438400,,434,4.304878048780488

2885647,5,B000SINSVC,"I pretty much loved everything about this special. Was it over the top? Yep. Predictable. Indeed. But I can take predictable and over the top comedy when it's performed so well. Dawn French is hilarious, Richard Armitage is the perfect straight man, and the supporting cast is a hoot. I loved the May-December aspect of Geraldine and Harry's relationship and how no one blinked an eye that they had fallen in love at first sight. The town just wants their vicar happy, and it's clear she's beloved by her congregation. It's all silly fun!",1425686400,,538,4.73404255319149

2885654,4,B000SINSVC,"No no no no no no, yes! Very entertaining. Laugh out loud funny. Although I found Dawn French to be a complete miscast as the vicar. Her acting skills were far inferior to most other actors in this show. I would have loved seeing someone with some wit and humor, rather than someone as dull as her, constantly obsessed with getting laid or stuffed with chocolates.",1424390400,,364,4.53030303030303

2885663,5,B000SINSVC,"I was not familiar with this series nor Dawn French.  I ordered it only because I discovered the handsome, and extremely good actor, Richard Armitage was in the last two episodes.  Ms. French was a delight and extremely funny.  And well, Richard Armitage was excellent and a double delight.  They played their roles well and were quite convincing.  It was lighthearted and I laughed a lot.  Not taking away anything from Ms. French, because she did an excellent job in this role, and I'm glad I had a chance to discover her and her talent.  But if it had not been for Mr. Armitage in the cast, I still would not have known her.  Mr. Armitage is excellent in any movie role  I've every seen him in, i.e. John Thornton in North and South,Guy of Gisborne in BBC's Robin Hood series, etc.  He's excellent, he simply becomes the character.  By all means ""The Vicar of Dibley-A Holy Happy Ending is worth buying fror your library of DVDs, it will be money well spent.  It's totally entertaining!",1422662400,2,989,4.556818181818182

2885673,5,B000SINSVC,I haven't watched the whole series.  I really just watched both parts of this episode because of Richard Armitage.  Both he and the cast are cutely funny.  Too bad he doesn't do more romantic comedies.,1419897600,,201,4.685714285714286

Perhaps the description of the series didn't appeal to me but when I had some time, and saw them available on Prime, I took the plunge.  I think it took me less than a week to view the entire series (as available) and now kick myself for missing them for this long.  Totally enjoyable and now I know why everyone talks about the talent of Dawn French.  However, don't forget the talents and performances of the entire supporting cast.

These episodes are laugh-out-loud entertaining and soft-heartedly romantic, too, a hard combination to pull off but creator Richard Curtis and his team manage it with joy and panache.  I have watched this DVD several times and will continue to do so.  It was a wonderful purchase!",1398902400,,475,4.9125

Wrong... I didn't even get through the first episode and had to shut it off. There was so much sex innuendo that is was very unsuitable for younger children and teens. I was a little disappointed but moved on.
Funny for those who don't mind all the sex talk, but not so much for a family show,..if you don't want your kids around all the sex.",1392595200,2,512,4.069306930693069

2885821,3,B000SINSVC,"If you're a fan of the vicar and her flock, you'll enjoy the specials, but like me, you'll probably be shaking your head at the decision to separate them from the timeline of the series.  They clearly should be nestled within the timeline, because each so-called 'special' follows along with the season it was broadcast in.  In fact, I'm not really sure why they are considered 'specials,' they seem like just another episode from a particular season.  And if you haven't seen the series, you won't really get much of the inside humor, and you'll be completely at a loss as to much of what the characters are referencing.

The Vicar of Dibley is such a sweet show with some fantastic and endearing characters, and they did a fantastic job with these episodes ending the series on a happy note. Richard Armitage is so handsome as Geraldine's true love Harry Kennedy, and it was lovely to see the Vicar get her happily-ever-after with the man of her dreams. If you enjoyed these episodes and haven't seen the earlier episodes, do watch them - you won't be sorry. This is one of those shows that stands up to repeated viewings, and for me visiting Dibley is like visiting a beloved set of old friends.",1375833600,,773,4.4125874125874125

And eventually just went for the cheap and easy laugh (which mostly resulted in not being funny).",1370217600,,257,4.953488372093023
2885887,5,B000SINSVC,"Classic BBC humor, highly reminiscent of the Saturday Night Live stand up comedy of the 1970's....In typical BBC Comedy fashion, the series starts like a cat waking up....stretching slowly, moving a bit faster, then pouncing on tidbits (of comedy in this case)...You have to watch several episodes and then you will be hooked.  U.S. comedy is geared toward the ""immediate satisfaction"" crowd for the most part - the bulk of British comedy (and it's enduring following) lies in silliness built over episodes and seasons.

A note about the boxed sets...make sure all the seasons and the Specials are included.  For instance, the second series contains the two specials produced after the last season, for some odd reason.  The Specials both belong after the final season if you are looking to watch them in order. Cheers!",1369958400,,819,5.044444444444444

You have to watch the Special Features first so you know what this is all about if you haven't seen the series and I haven't seen anything so funny in the last 55 years.  I actually laughed out loud and the characters, although slightly raunchy were delightfully human.  There is something about British humor that can't be beaten this side of the pond.  I've loaned it out and can't wait to get it back to see it again.  Bravo.",1366934400,,542,4.38

They were not considered a part of the standard season in the UK - but presented as specials. I wish the BritCom seasons were longer - a few short episodes (4-8) and the 'season' is over....sad as this is a great show and would have loved to see it continue. It can alternate between very funny, serious and one time very sad - but then a laugh again to make you smile. Well written and excellent cast.",1363046400,,488,4.147368421052631

Not too difficult to see why Dawn French hand-picked him to play her love interest/husband in the final episodes and he may think he isn't funny, but I honestly feel that he more than held his own with this consummate group of zanies.  It makes me very happy that they didn't destroy the Dibley sets after all when the last episode wrapped, because I would love to see another special somewhere down the road, just to catch up with Gerry and Harry and all the Dibley denizens.  Wonderfully romantic and laugh-out-loud hilarious--and taking place during Christmas, which is my very favorite time of the year, is the icing on a terrifically crafted cake.

Oh, he is charm itself in this show, but the Armitage love aside, this is a wonderful series on its own.  This particular DVD is the series finale and the only one to cast Armitage.  Even though I watched it just because he is in it, I've now discovered Dawn French and heartily glad.  She is a wonderful comedienne.  I'm sorry I didn't know of her sooner, and her ensemble cast is the perfect foil.  I have now gone on to watch almost the entire series, and I have enjoyed it so thoroughly that I doubt watching the series finale first was ill advised.

 The first episode on the disk is abosolutly halarios! I fell off my couch laght manys times! It is one of the best episodes made ever.
 But the second episode is barelly funny. It has a few good laughs but the rest is serios and boring.
 So overall, there is only one good episode, but it is extremely funny.",1250899200,,382,4.277777777777778
2885947,3,B000SINSVC,"I'd never seen any other episodes of the Vicar of Dibley before I saw these last two episodes, and I only watched these because I wanted to see more of Richard Armitage.  I did not at all expect to be so completely charmed by Dawn French and the loopy but lovable Dibley residents.

I loved episode 1, ""The Handsome Stranger.""  It's laugh-out-loud funny with some truly classic moments, like the book club meeting where no one has read the book and the fantasy sequence at the altar set to the song ""It should have been me.""  I've watched the latter scene over and over again.  Hysterical!

However, episode 2, ""The Vicar in White"", was a disappointment and is why I'm giving this review only three stars (and a half, if I could) instead of four.  As others have noted, the script for the second episode is not strong and wraps itself too much around the wacky mechanics of the wedding--the result is predictable and unsatisfying.  Many of the jokes are strained and not especially funny.

What is so compelling about the first episode is the relationship between Geraldine and Harry, especially given Geraldine's insecurities. I also liked how the other characters respond to Geraldine's new found love; the scene about the newsletter advice column is especially touching.  I really wish the writers had developed the romance further and given more justification for why Harry falls in love with Geraldine. I so wanted to believe that a man who looks like Harry would fall for a woman who looks like Geraldine because he sees her inner beauty and her heart of gold...but ultimately, I couldn't and didn't.  Richard Armitage has the requisite sensitivity to make the attraction believable on his side, but his character is not developed enough and there isn't enough interaction between Harry and Geraldine to show what he finds irresistible about her.  Had the second episode focused more on their relationship and less on the wedding, the finale might have been an all around winner.

In spite of the flaws of episode 2, I found myself identifying with Geraldine--how could I not when, to ease her broken heart, the woman pulls out a massive Cadbury Dairy Milk bar from her Bible?  And I ended up watching the earlier seasons because I liked the Dibley characters so much.  I then viewed these two episodes again, and I have to admit that I enjoyed them far more after I understood the Dibley history--there are many allusions to previous episodes that I missed or misunderstood on my first viewing.  All in all, this is a wonderful show and I highly recommend these two episodes along with the rest of the Vicar of Dibley series.  These are a fitting ending to a very fun ride.",1248220800,12,2680,4.75377969762419

These two-part special episodes are so funny and so sweet that I was converted on the spot to being a fan. Dawn French stars as Vicar Geraldine Granger, and there is a regular wonderful cast of parishoners who are all so droll in their eccentric ways.

Armitage portrays Harry Kennedy, a mild-mannered accountant who moves to the village and they meet cute when the Vicar goes over to give him a piece of her mind regarding gentrification occuring in Dibley. Sweet Harry is smitten and pursues the Vicar through several hilarious misunderstandings to win her hand.  The second part centers around the wedding which is a ""loving hands at home"" sort-of-affair. When her bridesmaid Alice showed up dressed as the 10th Dr. Who, I knew I was not in US anymore. All's well that ends well and this ends quite wonderfully.

Armitage has a rare chance to play comedy here. He has said that the sense of humor that he displays here is actually the closest to his in real life. I know envy is a deadly sin but a girl can't help but envy the lovely Ms. French for all those kissing scenes, especially ""with tongues.""",1248134400,26,1336,5.0590909090909095

There is a great balance between the insane comedy of the series regulars - which left me laughing until I cried - and the romantic story of the handsome stranger who falls in love at first sight with the vicar.  The romance has many very funny moments, but is not played for laughs.  It has a sincerity and truth that is a tribute to both Dawn French and Richard Armitage.

Did I mention he's really good-looking. The Vicar is distressed to learn that yet another Dibley cottage has been sold to a ""layabout Londoner"" who doesn't care for the village as anything more than a weekend retreat. Resolved to give him a piece of her mind, she ends up giving him her heart and hand as well. You know from the beginning that they'll make it down the aisle, but since this is Dibley, you know the road won't be smooth. Geraldine's road to wedded bliss is rocky but hilarious, and you'll enjoy traveling it with her.

2885966,5,B000SINSVC,"I gave this 5 stars -- the first episode here greatly deserves it, but the last and final episode was, as someone else here noted -- a bit flat, writing-wise.  It's always diffcult to keep the last episode of a comedic series light-hearted when all of the players, writers, and crew are feeling sad and nostalgic, I suppose, but here the writing is just not up to the importance of the moment.  Still the romance with the truly appealing (and pleasingly believable) Richard Armitage left things in a good place for our dear Vicar, and in the end this is an absolute must see for those who have followed the series.",1207612800,5,614,4.5225225225225225

2885971,5,B000SINSVC,"I'm totally biased because I love Dawn French, but this is truly a happy ending. A very funny ""Brit-com"" has come to a nice conclusion. I wish all shows could wind up this way. Make sure you watch all of the series before watching ""A Holy Wholly Happy Ending"". It just makes it so much better!

If you like Dawn French, check out ""Clatterford"". Kind of an oddball show written by my other favorite, Jennifer Saunders. Anyway, out of the whole terrific cast, Dawn steals the show..",1201651200,3,480,4.517241379310345

2885974,3,B000SINSVC,"I really liked this series and I like it when a series ends and actually makes and ending instead of trailing off.  Having said that, I was a bit disappointed w/this ending.  I am glad the Vicar finally found love but frankly I love the whole cast and I feel like they were given short shrift in this ending.  The problem w/this sort of ending is you have to introduce a groom so there is one new major charachter and they had to give the reverend friend of the Vicars some air time and the result is my favorite charachters got little time.  Still, there were some genuinely funny scenes and overall I enjoyed this DVD.",1199750400,3,620,4.318965517241379

Great DVD.",1198800000,,266,4.34
2885976,5,B000SINSVC,YES! At last the vicar snagged her a good man who is very good looking as well. And WHAT A WEDDING! The Dibley crowd go all out for their vicar. Bizarre as usual but from their hearts. Very enjoyable.,1198627200,3,200,4.153846153846154
2885977,3,B000SINSVC,"We love the Vicar and the loony town of Dibley.  There will always be a soft spot in our heart for them, but, as with many season finales, this one lacks some of the charm and wit of the original series.  Nevertheless, we still think it is an improvement over the tenth anniversary special.  Though we are sad to see the characters go, it is probably time to for the town of Dibley to move on and for the story to come to an end.  In that way, these final episodes provide some nice closure for fans.  Still glad we own it and makes for a nice rounding out of the story.",1198281600,27,570,4.053571428571429

2885982,5,B000SINSVC,"Is this the last joint appearance of the strangely wonderful Vicar of Dibley cast of characters?  Quite possibly. These two episodes seem to wrap up the story of parish vicar Geraldine Granger as she finds true love at last, although her wedding plans are hilariously usurped by her longtime colleagues on the church council. This is mainly an entertaining reworking of themes from previous episodes, a must-see for a true fan.  The accompanying short feature, The Vicar of Dibley Story, is a fascinating look at the history of the series, highlighting its small but critical part in furthering the cause of female vicars in the Church of England.  Cast bios, on the other hand, are somewhat disappointingly low tech.  On the whole a 5-star DVD, best enjoyed with a bar of chocolate.",1195257600,9,783,4.909090909090909
2885983,5,B000SINSVC,"I had watched many of the Vicar of Dibley episodes but had never seen this DVD. It did not disappoint me. Finally, the love-starved Vicar finds someone to share her life. Of course there are many obstacles put in her path, but our valiant Vicar bravely fights to overcome each one as it presents itself.

Treat yourselves to a funny, warm (and a little naughty) slice of Rev. Granger's life. Dawn French is terrific!",1195084800,4,416,4.621621621621622
2885984,5,B000SINSVC,"For fans of Dawn French and the Vicar of Dibley show, this is a wonderful way to end this superbly divine show. Don't miss the extras to see the cast and crew's thoughts about VOD-this is one show that not only entertained us, but pushed the envelope in regards to showing a woman vicar and some of the messages that came out.  This is a truly heartwarming way to end this series-I will miss all the folks in Dibley!",1194998400,5,416,4.265822784810126
2885985,5,B000SINSVC,"Dawn French is one of the greatest (and most beautiful) comedians to ever grace the tv screen, and it's always a wonderful welcome to see more of ""The Vicar Of Dibley"" as well...

This british import features, undoubtably, one of the funniest (and most underrated)ensembles in television history, and they're all back (except, of course, the character of Letisha Cropley, who passed away in the first season...)

And, as the title and cover suggests, this time around it's Geraldine's turn to find love, so there's no spoiler there, but...is it true love?...will it last?...will things end the way they began?...these are the questions we ponder, as we laugh our bloody heads off...",1194566400,9,682,5.080357142857143

I searched on line to find out what show I had been watching that night because it was so hilarious.  I finally found it under BBC shows and found out that it was being released on this DVD.  What a great show.  Funny, charming, heart warming and easily one of the best TV shows I have ever seen.  I just finished ordering the Immaculate Collection, which includes this final show, as well as all of the shows and specials from the 12 years this series was on TV.  I can't wait to see the other shows in the series.  I don't think anyone will be disappointed if they buy this DVD, but I would spend the money and get the Immaculate Collection so you can have all of the Vicar of Dibley shows.  What an amazing and talented ensemble was put together for this show, along with some great writing.  A must have!",1193356800,3,927,4.192090395480226
2885992,5,B000SINSVC,"This is a must-have for any Vicar of Dibley fan! I fell in love with this series years ago, but I don't think it ever had a proper send-off...until now.

The final regular episode (Summer) was very good, but was written and played as though it were just another show in the series. As a U.S. viewer, I wasn't even sure it was the end of the line until I realized I couldn't find any other shows! The 10th anniversary specials came around a few years ago, and they just didn't work. The tired jokes and the well-intentioned, but somewhat baffling, inclusion of the African crisis footage at the end of the second ep made me feel like the show bowed in due time.

Then came these gems. I agree with the reviewer who said Part I was as good as any episode from the original run. It's a refreshing reunion with beloved characters and will remind every fan what drew him/her to the series in the first place. I also liked Part II; it was so wonderful to see the Vicar marry such an appealing man who loves her back!

In fact, this special was so great, I felt kind of disappointed that it was truly the end for The Vicar of Dibley. I guess we can only imagine how the village reacts when Geraldine and Harry have their first child!",1193011200,13,1226,4.275862068965517
2885993,4,B000SINSVC,"I have mixed feelings after watching this much-anticipated ending to the Vicar.  Part I was as good or better than ANY other episode of the show (and I have the complete collection).  My sides were splitting the entire time, definitely 5+ stars.

However, the final episode was a bit of a letdown, it was almost anticlimactic.  I think the writers and directors had peaked on the previous episode and just didn't have anything left to give.  It rather dragged, the humor, while bawdy, just wasn't very funny; I mean, you can take Owen's (literal) love of animals only so far before it just gets old.  Even Alice wasn't very funny in the final show, her fixation with hanging a fake beard on Geraldine for the wedding left me flat.  3 stars (barely).

I'm really sad the show has run its course.  To me, it is probably the best show ever to come from the BBC and I will miss it.  I just wish it could have ended with a little more zing.",1192924800,6,935,4.383720930232558
