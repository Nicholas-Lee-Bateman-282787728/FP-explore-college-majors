Did not catch my interest which I thought it woulld.",1334016000,,138,4.148148148148148
8501901,4,B006OFDPD4,"It's ok and it's pretty funny.  I've watched The House of Venus Show and I like that so I expected it to be campy and it is. It is in a sort of reality tv style and budget spoof. Shirtless actors. A few butt shots. They could have added more nudity.  If you are a fan of The House of Venus Show you'll probably like it. If you don't like camp, it's not for you. Very over the top. 3.5*",1326672000,2,385,3.8
8501902,1,B006OFDPD4,"I had watched the trailer for this....movie shall we call it? and I could tell it was going to be over the top camp with really amateurish acting, but the trailer looked funny so I thought why not, it might be good for a few laughs.  Unfortunately, the funniest bits were in the 3 minute trailer.  The rest of this one hour ""film"" was pretty lame.  The same jokes over and over.  And if you're going to make a campy gay mockumentary about porn the very least you should do is show a little full frontal.  I mean.....hello people, where's the beef?!  The only reason I gave it one star (and not zero stars) was for the two hot butt shots we got to see of the lead actor.  The $1.99 rental was $1.98 too much.",1326412800,3,707,4.154411764705882
