8478252,5,B005LKH5BG,"It is a wonderful idea to offer a 7 DVD set of Tarkovsky's works! I'm surprised it was not available long ago. Of course, his imagery is superbly mysterious and magical and unique, especially in the films ""Stalker."" Andrei Rublev is intriguing for its historical aspect and its attention to the physical details of 15th century Russia. The sound quality is very good overall, however, in a couple of films, for example, ""The Mirror,"" I found in this version of the film a lack of subtitles and the subtitles that exist are poor translations - poor to the extent that the sentences are cropped and often make no sense. I saw this film years ago under Kino perhaps, and the subtitles were much more adequate. That said, ""The Mirror"" is beautiful for its stream of consciousness effect, that is, its assemblage of images that are hypnotic and absorbing if you, the viewer, just allow them to flow past you and do not expect them to transform into a more readily comprehensible narration.",1362614400,5,984,4.726744186046512
8478253,4,B005LKH5BG,"If having all of Andrei Tarkovsky's feature length films in a box, with remastered prints, sounds too good to be true, it is. No sooner had this review been written than this box set went out of print. -- Besides&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jean-Vigo/dp/B005152CC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jean Vigo</a>, Andrei Tarkovsky is the only film maker whose each and all feature length films I have watched multiple times. Part of the secret is of course the scarcity. Besides 3 early student films (which I haven't seen) and a documentary Tempo di Viaggio (which I have seen), Tarkovsky only made 7 films in 25 years, starting in 1961 with Ivan's Childhood and ending in 1986 when he died while The Sacrifice was in the last stage of editing. But the real secrete is his very unique personal style. These films are like some of the greatest art works. You can not just like them; you must either love them or leave them alone.

How shall I describe these films if you have never seen them? It is an impossible task which I will not even attempt. Perhaps, it is wiser to quote from a director who influenced (and was influenced by) Tarkovsky. Ingmar Bergman, upon seeing the original cut of Andrei Rublev without subtitles(!), proclaimed Tarkovsky to be one of the greatest directors. Bergman later took his case even further: ""Tarkovsky for me is the greatest [director], the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream."" The admiration is mutual. In his last film The Sacrifice, Tarkovsky paid respect to Sweden's famed director.

If you are on this page, likely these films need no introduction.(*1) -- The following information might prove useful for your purchase decision.

1. This box by Artificial Eye (AE) contains all of Tarkovsky's 7 feature length films and 1 documentary ""Meeting Andrei Tarkovsky"" by Dmitry Trakovsky.

2. All DVDs are PAL Region 2 encoded. You will need an all-region DVD player, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philips-DVD-Player/dp/B004BI6MVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philips DVD Player</a>, Oppo pre-blu-ray DVD players, or other custom-modified players, like modified Oppo BD-83.

3. The main problem, as I see this set, is the PAL-speedup(*2), which causes the total run time to be shorter. Here is the comparison chart. (All time approx.)

Film  | Running Time (director's cut) | AE Edition Running Time
Ivan's Childhood | 95 min  | 90 min
Andrei Rublev (original) | 205 min  | NA
  (revised)  | 186 min  | 174 min
Solaris  | 165 min  | 159 min
The Mirror  | 107 min  | 101 min
Stalker  | 163 min  | 154 min
Nostalghia  | 125 min  | 120 min
The Sacrifice  | 149 min  | 142 min

However, the shortening in Andrei Rublev and Stalker goes far above 4%. Is there an explanation? I want to know!

4. The video quality is in general very good, and in many cases best among the available DVDs. For example, AE's The Mirror is hands-down the best transfer I've ever seen. Andrei Rublev has better picture quality than Criterion's, whose source is a personal copy from Martin Scorsese.(*3) The Stalker is also among the best transfer(s) available. The sound has no problem except for Nostalghia, which has on-and-off crackles throughout. The subtitles, especially for the first 5 films (in Russian), seems at times incomplete, as sometimes no subtitles are displayed while the conversations are going. Nostalghia (in Italian) and The Sacrifice (in Swedish) seem to fare better in the subtitles department.

Anyway, the films as presented are still unforgettable masterpieces. In particular, The Mirror, Andrei Rublev and The Stalker are ranked by the British Film Institute (Sight and Sound 2012 poll) among the 30 Greatest Films of All Time.(*4) Get it before it disappears.

-------------------
(*1) As you might have guessed, the Wikipedia provides pretty good information on Tarkovsky's films. I was able to contribute a little bit there as well.

(*2) PAL system shows 25 frames per second instead of 24. Thus, the running time from unconverted sources is about 4% shorter.

(*3) Two prints seem to have VERY slightly different ratios, with AE's picture slightly slimmer and taller.

(*4) This is distinction shared by no others. If one goes beyond 30, then only 3 other directors have 3 or 4 films ranked in the top 50: Francis Coppola (Apocalypse Now, The Godfather I & II), Carl Theodor Dreyer (The Passion of Joan of Arc, The Word, Gertrud), and Jean-Luc Godard (Breathless, Contempt, Pierrot le fou, Histoire(s) du cinma).",1346630400,12,4622,5.107712765957447
