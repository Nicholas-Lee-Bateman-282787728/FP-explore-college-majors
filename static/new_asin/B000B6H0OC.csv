2403160,5,B000B6H0OC,"This could be the best foreign film and for my money one of the best films at the 2005 Oscars.

My wife and I still talk about the film. It is a story about a Quebec family (French) with the focus on the coming of age/coming out story of one of 5 boys. Well done and sensitive, it follows the boy from birth to middle age providing a real insight into what it was like for this person discovering his homosexuality. While the story focuses on his relationship with his father, his mother's role is priceless and the music was exceptional.

A French Canadian masterpiece.",1137110400,9,570,4.419047619047619
2403161,5,B000B6H0OC,"I had the pleasure of seeing this award-winning French Canadian film at the 2005 Toronto Film Fest.  I would dearly like to see it again -- even at the exorbitant price of $45 -- but I have to refrain for the time being.  The reason:  the details don't specify whether or not this film has ENGLISH SUBTITLES, and I strongly suspect that it DOESN'T.  (It's been my experience with Quebec DVD films in the past that if they don't specifically MENTION subtitles, there ARE no subtitles.)  I've inquired about this to Amazon, but have not received the courtesy of a reply yet.  So, much as I would like to recommend that you check out this amazing character-driven film right away, I can only suggest that you hold off for the time being, until the issue is cleared up.  (Unless you SPEAK French, of course ... then go for it!)

* Update: Thanks to another Amazon user, I found out that the DVD was available from an alternate source for a lot less money and definitely DID have English subtitles.  I strongly believe that it's the same version that Amazon is offering.  Why they refuse to update the details is a mystery, but you can now consider it safe to purchase if you don't speak French.",1132617600,60,1190,4.493023255813953
2403162,5,B000B6H0OC,"I rarely review items on Amazon, but I just saw this film and believe it deserves far more attention than it is getting in the U.S.  If you like movies about people, family, and relationships and don't like Hollywood's oversimplified characters and facile plots, this film is for you.

The story in a nutshell: lower middle class parents raise 5 sons in suburban Montreal from 1960 to the present. There are 2 main themes: the father's relationships with his sons, and the struggle of one of the sons to reconcile his identity with his parents' expectations.

While I was watching this film, I kept waiting for one of the usual missteps: a character simplified to keep the story moving, an action or phrase that isn't genuine, an actor briefly stepping out of character. It didn't happen! This 2 hour movie was flawless in how it portrayed this family and the times they lived in. But don't get the idea this is some french version of Forest Gump. This movie encapsulates a time and place by focusing on the individuals and letting their unique lives tell the story of the generation.

I would be remiss if I didn't comment on the superb acting from this cast you've probable never heard of (I sure hadn't). If this film was in english the actor playing the father would be a slamdunk for the best supporting actor Oscar. The portrayals of the mother, the eldest son as an adult, and all the sons as children were superb. Finally, I would call the lead character's performance a Tour de Force if it weren't for the fact that this somehow implies it was overdone. It wasn't - it was just perfect!

A word of warning. These characters speak Quebecois. Don't expect your high school french or even your college french/english dictionary to let understand the dialogue without subtitles. This is a shame because the color imparted by language is part of the story, especially the French Canadian swear words based on the Catholic liturgy.

Go out of your way to see this film. It's a gem.",1131753600,20,1984,4.654285714285714
2403163,5,B000B6H0OC,"It's already Canada's official entry at the Oscars and has been distributed in 50 countries. It also boasts one of the most enthusiastic ratings response on the IMDb ([...]) and it's just been made available on DVD on Amazon. See: [...]

It's a coming-of-age story set in Quebec in the 60's, 70's and 80's in a suburban family of five boys. It's been variously acclaimed as the ""Best Canadian Film ever"" and the ""Best Quebec Film of the past 20 years"", which is not surprising as the best Canadian films are almost invariably from Qubec.

I personally think it deserves all the accolades. On top of good acting, a gripping story, gut-wrenching situations, a wonderful recreation of the era, and a very real Qubec atmosphere, it offers visual explosions of pure cinematic genius.

The main character Zachary, is so compelling he brings you to tears. And the parents relationship with their son is so touching you just can't even pause this movie to go to the restroom. It's a continuous emotional roller coaster of happiness, sad, honesty, confusion, and at times, rejection from love and family. Please watch this movie!! It has been totally underrated in the movie world!

2403178,5,B000B6H0OC,"I'm not a huge fan of ""Gay Cinema"" as most of it comes of as trite and doesn't give it's characters the depth that we as homosexuals deserve.

That's why I don't even group this movie with gay cinema.  It's a terrific movie about Family from the point of view of one of five children, who happens to be gay.  The film is really more about family ties and seeking approval, though it's often lumped in with ""gay cinema"", it transcends it.

The budget for the music rights in this film was well worth it... without Sympathy For The Devil by the Rolling Stones, the scene in the church would never have been as powerful and profound.

2403180,5,B000B6H0OC,"I have watched this film three times now and I appreciate it more each time. I am disappointed that it did not receive more recognition from the critics. But then, it's not the first great movie that slipped by under their radar.

I think the actress who played the mother provided one of the best performances I have seen in years. In the scene following the funeral where son and father embrace in a desperate effort to recreate a damaged relationship, the mother's reaction is one of the most touching moments I have ever seen on film. So simple, so understated, so moving.

I think the father's performance was outstanding also. The actor who played Zac would probably win the viewer's poll as the best performance in the movie, and that choice would probably be pooh-poohed by those who consider themselves critics above the pack. But on reflection, I think he did a laudable job of holding his centerpiece performance in check. It would have been so easy to overdo it and lose the realism he achieved.

Taken on the whole, every performance was so natural, so real, so convincing, that I find myself wondering how the surviving Beaulieus are doing today.

None of those performances could have been realized without a screenplay and direction that resounds with truth.

In another sense, this movie is like a painting. It is perfectly symmetrical. There is the forced march through the blizzard and the flight across the searing desert. There is the marijuana shotgun and the asthma inhaler. In every event in the film, there is balance not only of circumstance, but also of significance. The mystical elements of the healing powers and the religious faith are balanced by the gritty realism of the family conflicts and the post-pubertal priapism. What a powerful way to emphasize the symbolic as well as the real identities of the characters.

The symbolism is as playful as it is serious. From the twin smokestacks to the use of the inhaler, the symbols appear exactly when and where they should.

The soundtrack is very near perfect. I have heard it compared to the music from Trainspotting, but it really isn't fair to compare the Trainspotting soundtrack to that of C.R.A.Z.Y. In the former case, the extraordinary soundtrack must not stray from the relatively direct path the film follows. In the latter, there is no direct path, rather a serendipitous wandering that imitates life. If C.R.A.Z.Y. were constructed like Trainspotting, then the casual viewer would remember only the Stones and Bowie and Floyd. But it isn't. Therefore, the choices of Cline and Aznavour for natural and that ethereal Sheremetiev chant for supernatural are spot on. The L'Elisir d'Amore aria playing behind (and in front of) the drunken brawl at the family Christmas table was pure art. A choice every bit as superb as the choice of Lou Reed's ""Perfect Day"" in Trainspotting.

At the end of the '70, beginning of the '80, Zachary will try to find his way, in and out the tight circle of his family, passing through everything, sex, drugs and rock and roll, with mostly negative experience, but with one certain in life, that sooner or later he will have to be back ""home"", to close what he started and never finished, trying to find a relationship with his father.",1278288000,,698,4.376923076923077

All the stars I gave, I gave them for him - not true - I enjoyed this film for a number of reasons, I enjoyed the collection of kooky characters, their interactions and the interesting story; there were a number of surprises, some edgy filmmaking and competent acting performances (what a dysfunctional family). The Story could have used a bit more of a sexual awakening/realization with the lead; the coming out story seemed a bit hazy and inconclusive - plus any excuse to get Marc-Andre naked would be much appreciated.",1271289600,,547,4.89247311827957
2403196,5,B000B6H0OC,"What a delight!  The movie is about a guy who is the fourth child of the family (the family ended up having five boys: Christian, Raymond, Antoine, Zac, Yvan.  OMGsh!  CRAZY) who was born on Christmas (good timing).  He had an idea he was different, but he didn't want to admit it.  His family didn't like it, and that subject was a taboo.  You know what that subject is....

What differentiates this movie from other gay coming-of-age stories is that he wasn't out-and-proud.  That's refreshing.  Which gay person hasn't (physically and/or mentally) self-mutilated themselves until they finally could admit a fact they cannot change?

Another refreshing feature of this French gay movie is good writing.  Come on, everyone.  You know it, but you don't want to admit it.  Gay themed movies is littered with gawful scripts (and acting!).  Once in a blue moon you'll come across with gems like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Edge-of-Seventeen/dp/B00004UEDZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Edge of Seventeen</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mudge-Boy/dp/B000EGEKRO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mudge Boy</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Line-of-Beauty/dp/B000GIXLX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Line of Beauty</a>, but typically you get instead is some one and half hour farce.  In CRAZY, you get exceptionally well-caricatured family members.  I bet by the end of the movie you'd at least remember the stubborn military father who enjoyed singing karaoke or Raymond the do-no-good brother who was our main boy's nemesis (but also best ally).

It's all about the family.  I think you might even want to subconsciously leave this movie on top of your parents' TV set, so they'll watch it, accept it, so you can accept yourself.  ;-)",1260403200,,1874,6.2784313725490195
2403197,5,B000B6H0OC,"First, let me say that this is an often overlooked, gem of a film. An absolutely brilliant piece of filmmaking by Jean-Marc Vallee and the entire crew and cast. So, why have so many people not seen (let alone heard of) this film? In this case I think this has to do somewhat to it being 1) a (french) Canadian production (i.e. not coming from Europe, Asia or the USA), 2) it is a film that superficially (plot-wise) might seem to primarily be about gay/lesbian subject matter 3) the title of the film, which, while pointing to some inside content of the movie, is not really the most captivating. Let me say, the film is brilliant. Ultimately, the film is about growing up and the dynamic relationships within a family. I say this while thinking how even that description really doesn't captivate the true essence of the film.... So let stop right here and just say, that it is an amazing film (with an amazing soundtrack) and I highly recommend it (although it should be noted that it does contain some R-rated content so maybe not for the young ones depending on what you deem appropriate).",1258416000,,1092,4.576530612244898

2403200,5,B000B6H0OC,"This movies is great because it just protrays Quebec as it was in the 60's and 70's.

I remember that htings were liked that and I knew several families just like them

where dad is making a good living in the construction business. Then, these construction

guys were most of them fitting the macho profile. The high school life was also just like shown

with those leader guys always making fun especially of the sensitive or intellectual boys

to the point of violence. Those were the days.

You could see that anyone had a high quality of material life because everyone had money

but it was difficult to be different. It is also the fact that Zac's catholic mother would

finally be the understanding person that would accept Zac's evolution. It is quite true that

in North America, living a very rich material world can hide a very poor capacity to true

relationships.

It is also a great film about the true sense of family where the dad-boy relationships are

so important abd that the men, in those days, were so unprepared to cope for. It is a movie that

shows how much change that the Quebec society has lived. What is so great about this film is that knowing

that all these people were true with themselves, they could not do better than what is seen.",1171324800,3,1267,4.524229074889868
2403201,5,B000B6H0OC,"C.R.A.Z.Y. is a miraculous little film from Quebec written with pitch perfect dialogue by Jean-Marc Valle and Franois Boulay, on whose memories of his own experiences the story is based, directed with tremendous zest and sensitivity by Jean-Marc Valle, and with a cast of fine actors that would be impossible to duplicate. Yes, it really is that fine. The title of the film may put some people off as silly, so let it be said early on that the letters C.R.A.Z.Y. represent the first names of the sons of the Beaulieu family - and the fun, hilarious and touching story starts from there!

Christmas Day is the birth of Zachary Beaulieu (impressive Marc-Andr Grondin as a young man and mile Valle as a youth), the fourth son of Gervais Beaulieu (a brilliant Michel Ct) and his seemingly perpetually pregnant wife Laurianne Beaulieu (Danielle Proulx, a superb actress), and at his birth he is immediately dropped on the floor, 'dies' for a few seconds, and is resuscitated, a fact which later leads his mother to consult her Tupperware friend/seer about Zachary's power from God to heal other people. The children include Raymond who is a boisterous youth and later a worthless drifter/panhandler (played by Pierre-Luc Brillant as a young man but also played as a youth by Emmanuel Raymond and Antoine Ct-Potvin); Christian (Maxime Tremblay as a young man and Jean-Alexandre Ltourneau as a youth; Antoine (Alex Gravel as a young man and Sbastien Blouin as a youth; and Yvan (Flix-Antoine Despatie and Gabriel Lalancette). Each brother has a particular personality, whether a bookworm, an athlete, a ne're-do-well or a dreamer and we watch the family adapt to each of the brothers' idiosyncrasies.

But it is Zachary who is the focal point as he struggles with his sexual identity from childhood on through his teenage denial years while dating a girl, to his final longing for the unreachable relationship with a man as an adult. His 'powers' of healing he uses to great advantage for his family and he gradually becomes disenchanted with the omnipresent Catholic Church, a force that plays heavily in his fantasy life and dreams and fears. As the years pass from 1960 to 1971 we are allow to watch a family connect, fragment and ultimately survive, always bound to traditions of holiday and love. Gervais claims all of the good points of his boys as patterned after him, yet as he faces Zachary's possibly being gay he balks and it is only after a mesmerizing life changing experience Zachary undergoes that Zachary and Gervais finally find the mutual love they have both needed.

Though the film is long (running time is over two hours) the film seems to fly past us like a comet of experience to which we all can relate. The performances are so very powerful that they sweep us away with the amount of love they exhibit: Danielle Proulx as the mother is so subtle in the little things she does for her beloved though at times wayward sons that she glows and Michel Ct steals the screen as a father searching for understanding of his crew of crazy boys. But the revelation is Marc-Andr Grondin's embodiment of Zachary that is nothing short of a miracle of acting. There is not a weak moment in this little masterpiece of filmmaking and one hopes that it will be released and widely publicized in the theaters in the USA as it deserves standing ovations! Highly recommended. In French (Quebecois) with English subtitles. Grady Harp, January 07",1169251200,3,3441,4.828813559322034
2403202,4,B000B6H0OC,"Elsewhere in these reviews you've been given excellent descriptions of performances and plot development.  But, here and now, let's look a little deeper into our thinking about the three more important members of this C.R.A.Z.Y family:  there's Michel Cote's ""Dad""---he's the anchor around which ""Zac's"" life raft circles.  And Marc-Andre Grondin's ""Zac""---he's the one never so happy as when his father is accepting him.......acknowledging him.  And never forget Danielle Proulx's ""Mom""---she's every gay boy's ""dream-delight"" of a parent, the one who knows how to keep that 'different' child on an even keel.

Here's a film trip downright engineered to dig up / dredge out memories of times with ""Dad"".......times in car washing driveways, times of just-you-two car rides-----""connecting times"" you'd thought....you'd hoped......but maybe not.  And for many of us, other not so happy memories perhaps raising their ugly heads-----yet even for that we've got to say:  Thank you, Director Vallee.

Sudden inspiration!......did YOU catch it:  Cote's ""Dad"" and Grondin's ""Zac"" are the 2-sides of the same coin.  The two of them are more alike than any other 2 family members shown in this film.  Sadly, how many wasted years and how much heartache til they found that out and, eventually, owned up to it.  Repeating, I believe a lot of ""Dad's"" 'problem' was that he sometimes realized he was a great deal more like ""Zac"" (or vice versa) than he was comfortable with.  That's when their relationship would 'cycle down.'  Ah, poor ""Zac,"" how does one cope with that?  Took him a very long time to figure out how to do so, didn't it?

Finally, one thing truly stands out for me, and that is how very difficult it has to be for an, essentially, first-time theatrical film actor to, let's face it, carry a 2+ hour movie.........this being Grondin's first ever film since reaching teenage.  And as a final thought about Marc-Andre, why not admit it:  what an amazing kid; even more, what a great 'package'.......what a gorgeous ass!  What more could Grondin want from life?

PS--I'll tell you this---I'm gonna buy anything of Grondin's work that comes along.  And Marc-Andre: if you're seeking an immigration sponsor, look no farther; I'm here.

2403203,5,B000B6H0OC,"The French-Canadian film ""C.R.A.Z.Y."" begins on Christmas Day 1960 with the birth of Zac Beaulieu, the fourth of what will turn out to be five sons of Gervais and Laurianne Beaulieu.  From very early on, Zac begins to see himself as somehow ""different"" from his other brothers and, indeed, from all other boys around him.  While his other siblings seem to have found their individual niches in life - one's a cool Casanova-type ladykiller, another a rough-and-tumble jock, another a book-obsessed brainiac - Zac suffers from asthma, wets his bed and would rather play with a baby carriage than the hockey game his father bought him for his birthday/Christmas present.  In fact, thanks to his sharing his birthday with Jesus, Zac's devout but highly superstitious Catholic mother has always believed her boy has some miraculous connection with the healing powers of the Savior (obscure relatives are encouraged to call the Beaulieu residence when they are suffering from some minor injury or illness).  Zac's dad, meanwhile, struggles with making sure Zac doesn't turn out to be a mollycoddled ""fairy,"" which would be not only a disgrace to the family but an embarrassing indictment of himself as a father .

""C.R.A.Z.Y."" takes its title from both the first letters of each of the boys' names as well as the Patsy Cline song that is a particular favorite of their father's.  This is a brilliantly perceptive and emotionally devastating look into the heartbreaking struggle that gay youngsters have to endure growing up in a world that teaches them that there is something ""wrong"" with them if they happen to find themselves drawn to people of the same rather than the opposite gender.  The last thing Zac wants to admit to himself, let alone to anyone else, is that he is attracted to other boys.  When his father suspects that Zac may be heading in that direction, the son perceives a change in the man's attitude towards him.  The dad to whom he once felt so close suddenly seems distant and no longer accepting of his boy.  Thus, fearing rejection from the very people who mean the most to him, and with no one and nowhere else to turn to, Zac spends much of his life fruitlessly pleading with God to perform a miracle of ""change"" in him and to take away his ""affliction"" (he is so steeped in self-denial that he convinces himself that it is his asthma he is praying about and not his sexuality).  He also gets himself a girlfriend as a way of hiding the truth from himself and others, and sublimates his own anger and self-hatred by beating up another boy whom Zac suspects of being the same way.  However, through various key incidents and events in his life and the life of his family, Zac slowly comes to accept himself and to even make some inroads into the heart of his recalcitrant father.

Based largely on his own experiences growing up in Montreal, director Jean-Marc Vallee has co-written (with Francois Boulay) a beautifully insightful screenplay that not only shows the fear, loneliness and self-loathing that come to dominate Zac's life, but perfectly captures the complex dynamics of life in this one family.  The father is by no means a ""bad"" man; he is a faithful provider who loves his wife and children and wants only the best for them.  The fact that he can't accept his son's possible homosexuality is an understandable by-product of the time and society in which he lives.  Like all of us, he fears that which he doesn't understand, and with no precedents - either personal or societal - to help guide him in this area, he firmly believes that he is doing the right thing in first taking Zac to a counselor to ""cure"" him, then banishing him from his home when Zac is seen in a car with another man.  Ironically, Zac's mother, despite her tendency towards mysticism and superstition, is, in many ways, the most level-headed and tethered-to-reality of all the people in the family, arguing that their boy is no less worthy of love and acceptance simply because he isn`t like all the rest.  Even though the characters fill the roles set for them by society, none of them is a clich or stereotype but is instead a fully-rounded individual, with the good and bad traits, strengths and weaknesses that we all share as human beings.

Despite its miniscule budget, the movie is ambitious in scope, spanning a period of 21 years from 1960 to 1981, capturing the flavor of the era through such defining touchstones as drug use and the music of David Bowie, Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones.  Rather than following a set formula, the script frequently veers off into unexpected paths and by-ways, making it appear less theatrical in nature and more like real life.

The performances by Marc-Andre Grondin as Zac, Michael Cote as his father, and Danielle Proulx as his mother are beautiful and heartbreaking to behold.  Grondin, in particular, has an amazing talent for showing us a character whose internal impulses are constantly at war with his external actions.  Emile Vallee is also superb as Zac at a younger age.

This is a beautifully realized tale of the dangers of repression and of the importance of accepting people for who and what they are.  Blessed with one of the most emotionally wrenching endings in recent movie history, ""C.R.A.Z.Y."" takes its place among the very finest films of 2005.",1167696000,4,5318,4.785792349726776
2403214,4,B000B6H0OC,"A Christmas story too as it was anchored around the birthday which was on Xmas day (December 25). That's probably why Sundance decided to make its TV debut around XMas. Not your typical Christmas story for sure...

The family portrayed has all sorts of personalities/(stereo)types:

* macho dad

* caring/nurturing mom

* rebel without a cause first-son

* Weezer/book-geek son

* hockey-playing son

* gay son

* youngest son of a big family

A well-done movie, realistic, grounded, emotional, even-keeled (given all the drama), quirky, funny at times, with 70s music (a lot of Pink Floyd). In french.

If you are tired of formulaic, fast-food like, disposable, predictable, mass-market movies with recycled plots and jokes, give this one a try!

(Was there a not-so-subtle homage to Pink Floyd by the director/producer? The prism painted on his bedroom wall was very similar to a certain Pink Floyd album cover...)",1167177600,2,916,5.121621621621622
2403215,5,B000B6H0OC,"It's a coming out story and some people will complain about that, but saying that coming out stories have been done before is kind of like saying that love stories have been done before. The real story is about human love, despair and triumph. One of the great things about this film is that the main characters have depth. Even when there is conflict, you understand everyone's backgrounds and motivations. This is so much like a real family, rather than a movie or TV family, it can give you chills. Add some brilliant acting and great camera work, and you've got a terrific film.",1166918400,3,582,4.605769230769231

2403218,4,B000B6H0OC,"I usually have trouble with subtitles and when I found out I would need them to watch this film (and understand it) I was a little apprehensive. There is one thing I like about subtitles, it helps me decipher whether a film is good or not. If I forget it's in subtitles by the end I know it's drawn me in. By the end I wouldn't have been able to tell a difference if it was in English.

C.R.A.Z.Y. tells the story of the second youngest in a French-Canadian family of five brothers who is struggling with his sexuality and, although it's more subtle, his faith. Zachary as a kid is effeminate and has a motherly connection with his baby brother that his father finds abhorrent.

As Zachary grows to a teenager he attempts to shut these things out through sexuality, drugs and rebellion against God, his family and his own ""gift""

The movie takes the family through the 60's to the 80's. There are many downs and a few ups. They are constantly at each other and when something seems to be going right one character turns it on another. It's a sad movie but there is a lot of hope. It has a happy, although slightly melancholic, ending without being unrealistic and wrapped up with a bow like a soap opera. Not everything works out but somethings do and others start on their way to being fixed. C.R.A.Z.Y. all in all is a great movie about family, God and just how messed up most of our relationships are.",1155081600,9,1404,4.392307692307693
2403219,5,B000B6H0OC,"It's hard to write a review after all the good ones already written. As a Quebecois very quebec-centric when it comes to movies, I admit my partiality towards C.R.A.Z.Y but let's face it...this movie is one of a kind gem filled with some of the best talents in Quebec.

It may be 45$ but it is worth it, you will watch it again and again.

Attention Rolling Stones Fans: you will never listen to Sympathy for the Devil without thinking about this movie. David Bowie Fans will also be pleased.

Enjoy!!!!!",1143331200,6,504,4.516483516483516

2403222,5,B000B6H0OC,"C.R.A.Z.Y. is a rare film. Wonderful, comic, beautiful, poetic, tragic, and more- it effectively captures the cultural norms and social atmosphere of Montreal in the late 70s. More importantly, it tells the story of a suburban, working class family and their confrontation with the most formidable of challenges that could threaten any family's stability.

Brutally honest, morally visceral, and cleverly presented, C.R.A.Z.Y. will alter the meaning of the word, permanently, for anyone who is willing to accept that the most important foundations of family are love and acceptance.",1142294400,8,582,5.613636363636363
2403223,5,B000B6H0OC,"First, to answer the question another reviewer had about whether or not this DVD has English subtitles, I can confirm that it does.

I was shocked and delighted at how wonderful C.R.A.Z.Y. is.  It is so rare to come across a gem of a film like this.  It shows just how great movies have the potential to be, though they almost never rise to this level.  As one reviewer put it, C.R.A.Z.Y. is ""magical, mystical, sexy, funny, touching and ever so crazy.""  It is a movie you will never forget.

This is not just one of the best movies of recent years, but one of the best ever made.",1138579200,7,580,4.275229357798165

8082382,5,B000B6H0OC,"Crazy is a family film. To me, it has particular anguishing moments as I review it in a Christmas day. A day to be always remembered as a day of frustration. I can easily relate to the main character of the movie, being born in 1958 in a working class family just like him (happily not at Christmas time). The film can be as destroying as one wants of Christmas fantasies and family attitudes towards sexuality. Like the main character, I too delayed the internal coming out as much as I could, and it only sorted out with difficulty and pain.
The relationship father son mother is, to me, splendidly shown. I fell like myself being described in the triangle where the mother protects the son from the furies and frustrations of the father, who wants to transform the son in something he isnt, an idealized version of himself. In the film its even worst: none of the sons become the fathers desire, all have their own trajectories, more or less developed, but all authenticable.
I wouldnt describe this as a gay film, even though the theme is largely discussed. Its much more than that. Its the microcosms of issues that form a family, and it not always simple solutions.",1482624000,,1171,4.580952380952381
