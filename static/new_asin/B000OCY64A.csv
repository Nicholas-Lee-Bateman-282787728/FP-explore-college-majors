8184293,4,B000OCY64A,"The third volume of ""Le Chevalier D'Eon"" is here and with the first volume focusing on D'Eon searching for the death of his sister Lia and the second volume being more of an introductory volume to more characters in the anime series, the third volume featuring episodes 9-12 is finally reaching an exciting phase of the anime series.

  In this third volume, we may get the answers to who killed Lia Beaumont and why.

  Where the last episode left off with D'Eon, Robin, Durand and Teillagory reaching Russia into getting answers to the death of Lia, episode 9 starts to pick up with the knights of France meeting with the Russian empress.

  In episode 9 (The Lovers), we learn about how close Lia was with Empress and how she was instrumental in establishing the strong bond between France and Russia.

  Also, the four receive information that there will be an assassination attempt on the empress and the four will do what it will take to help protect the empress.

  In episode 10 (The Royals Psalms), things start to pickup as we may get some clues to who killed Lia and also learning about the sinister Maximilien Robespierre plans and one of his plans is to make the wicked and abusive Pyotr the emperor of Russia.

  In episode 11 (Rain on Saint Petersburg), you learn about the relationship between Ekaterina (Pyotr's wife) and the empress and learn that Ekaterina was the one responsible for assisting the four knights.

  The episode also features a major death caused by the sinister Maximilien Robespierre.  You also learn how Ekaterina was looked upon as being the Lia of Russia.  As for our four heroes, they are accused of the murder.

  In episode 12 (Rest in Peace in Thy Fatherland), with things going awry in Russia, D'Eon and Durand confront all that is sinister and that means confronting Maximilien Robespierre.

  I apologize for being a bit vague on the reviews but with some important developments in the episodes of this third volume, I have to keep it short.

  Just say that the ""Le Chevalier D'Eon"" storyline is starting to pick up some steam again and if you enjoyed the first volume, you will enjoy the third as the storyline has received a shot of synergy and is more exciting, faster-paced and action-packed than previous episodes.

  The special features include commentary with the ""Russians of Le Chavalier"", ""Cast a Spell: A Commentary Sance with the poets"", clean and opening and closing animations and my favorite of each volume, another well written booklet with character information, interview and script.

  With the first volume introducing really cool commentary (although a bit too much profanity in my opinion), the third volume introduces some really cool commentary especially with the voice actors of Pyotr and Ekaterina.

  Typically when you watch a commentary section, it seems a bit politically correct and stays on topic.  I'm starting to learn that the commentary for this series will go on several tangents and ends up being commentary but also conversational, almost like listening to a podcast.

  So, I found the freestyle side of commentary on this series refreshing.

  The series is definitely picking up some steam in the US as people who are attracted to the Rococo era (18th Century France) and enjoy the series impressive cast and its utilization of fictional and historical characters.

  Volume 3 of ""Le Chavalier D'Eon"" gives us storylines that make you want to keep watching.  Volume 2 was very slow pace and I was not sure if this latest volume would follow that same path.  Fortunately it didn't because volume 3 just kicks butt!

  We are now starting to get the answers that we have been waiting for in this beautiful and intriguing series.  I really look forward to volume 4!",1218326400,,3754,4.85126582278481
