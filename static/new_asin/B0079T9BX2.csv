This is a great workout as long as you remember to squeeze your navel toward your spine during many of these exercises. About 45 minutes to an hour (not sure about the exact length). I sweated my butt off and burned muscles I didn't know I have. The benefit is core, hip flexors, glutes, and IT band areas. Lots of elongation. The instructor is very clear. I normally would just go to Amazon Prime and find something like this but I couldn't locate a streaming video with the ring. So deal with the DVD. It's worth it.",1521590400,,655,4.377049180327869
