7815396,1,6301715764,Do not purchase this exercise review.  It is like a voice over you cannot hear her voice and the exercises are ordinary.  I should have returned it but I was so distracted.  She should have done better as a professional on this video.,1488153600,,234,4.395348837209302
7815397,4,6301715764,"If you remember beautiful, leggy Cyd Charisse from films like Singing in the Rain and my personal favorite, Brigadoon (she & Gene Kelly were so romantic and the dancing was great), for nostalgia alone you may want to get this video just to see how well Cyd had aged by 1990, the year of this video.  She had the body of a woman half her age, very close to her lovely long-legged young figure, and to her credit she is in constant motion (from easy to exertional) and speaking gentle instruction for the entire 50-min. video.  She begins doing basic leg & arm stretching exercises sitting in a chair, but then gets up and starts some serious leg moves - careful ladies, she kicks HIGH, both front & back - the Latin dances cha-cha & basic flamenco minus the hard stepping, a slow romantic adagio reminiscent of her movie dance duets, and finally a 10-min. stretching cooldown.  I was wondering why she is doing the workout alone with no classmates (except for 2 guys who pop in for a brief soft-shoe number), then realized she covers about the entire room with her dance steps.  She is a very pleasant instructress, all the while trying to involve the viewer in the ""fun"" aspect of dance-exercising, but the one distraction is the musical score.  She is obviously trying to re-create some of her jazzy film numbers and set an upbeat mood, but the beginning music is very much '50s burlesque-stripper Gypsy Rose Lee type, then you get sexy piano cha-cha & tango numbers, the tapdance style of A Chorus Line, then slower piano for both the adagio & final cooldown, all sounding like it comes from a pianoman on a soundstage, but so loud it nearly drowns out Cyd's gentle voice.  You can really do the tape on mute or low volume and just follow Cyd's example, which I think would be more enjoyable than hearing that heavy-handed music.  This is a fun, different type workout video that isn't as ""easy"" as its name implies, the dance moves & frequent kicks are a little challenging and you have to be careful not to strain or pull something, but Cyd is encouraging to watch because she looked so physically terrific in her late sixties that it's inspiring.",1363046400,3,2151,4.5859375
7815398,4,6301715764,"Cyd provides an initial limbering up with a chair as a brace, followed by unsupported dance steps with different rhythms at an increasing pace, trailing off with a more ballet like set, and ending with a short prone stretching session on a floor pad.  You'll definitely need a bit of room to accommodate the aerobic portion.  You might be able to manage this barefoot, or with soft shoes or slippers so your toes can change position.  If you've watched her musicals, you will find familiar ground here.  It depends on your taste in dance.",1354233600,2,538,4.691489361702128
