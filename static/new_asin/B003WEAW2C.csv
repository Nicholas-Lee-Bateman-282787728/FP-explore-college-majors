4213349,5,B003WEAW2C,"Being Human is a fun show, something different.  BTW...it's coming the SyFy in the US very soon.",1287964800,,96,4.647058823529412
4213350,5,B003WEAW2C,"I mean, 'Being Human' started out as this...how do I put this? This 'little' show. With this small idea--to just live in this house, get along with the neighbors, blend in with these so called, low-key jobs and well...be human.

And in the first season, you see a lot of that. And it's a fun ride to be had by all.

Though by the second season, things have had a way of moving along--to the point, that maybe just 'being human' isn't quite the goal anymore.

It's more like just trying to keep your head above water now. If the powers that be could just allow that.

And from very early on in the new season's opener, we're introduced to these 'powers'.

They come in the form of two new characters: Daisy and her husband Ivan. These two figure a lot into Mitchell's life--and that's probably because they're vampires too.

I won't give too much away here, but I think it's because of the two of them, that you ultimately see an advancement in Mitchell's personality.

It's like Mitchell sorta steps up and assumes a more leadership role in the vampire community at large in the wake of Herrick's departure. (Or at least, he tries.) And through this role, Mitchell becomes a more darker figure.

And can I tell you how this really changes your perception of him?

Because from the first season, you're thinking that you sorta know this Mitchell character. I mean, I thought I did. It's like from last season, Mitchell always came off as this fun loving guy.

I mean, oh sure he was a vampire all right, but there was always this light-heartedness about him too, that always managed to shine its way through. (That's what I always loved about his character--he was a vampire that you could love and even cuddle up to.) This season though, maybe not so much. (Though there is a cute scene in episode four where George is jumping on top of Mitchell and Mitchell is telling George that he stinks--I think this is one of the FEW times in the season that you see Mitchell actually smile.) Boy, do I miss this. (Only because you got so much MORE of this in season one.) Oh well.

And maybe when I think about it, that's the evolution that Mitchell's character needed to make. You know, to advance the plot along.

There's an evolution that the George character makes too. He seems bolder this time around. And decisive too.

It's good that with (his girlfriend Nina's encouragement), that he gets on with things and gets himself a new job teaching English as a second language. This development really suits him I think, though...again, I won't give too much away, but some of my beefs about this season probably go to the writer(s).

It's like the writers will do something, like they'll take the story in one direction, then they'll do this 'take back'. (That's what ultimately happens with George.)

OK, so I'll give ONE thing away regarding a 'take back'.

Early on in this season, the ghost Annie can be seen. And she's so confident with this ability, that she even gets herself a job in a pub.

Only after the show progresses along, this ability of being seen (seemingly at random or maybe not?) is taken away from her. And when she can no longer be seen, I'll tell you it's heartbreaking. And kinda pointless too.

I mean, why give her this ability (to be seen) just to take it away? [Note to the writers: I think it would be a good idea to make Annie be able to control when she wants to be visible and when she doesn't want to be--like I think a 'real' ghost would be.] Then her character could have more of a life and you could do more things with her.

All in all though, I will give the writers of the show their 'props' for keeping 'Being Human' fresh and entertaining. The way the second season ends, you can hardly wait for the third. I know I can't!

(Also, how the show had these flashbacks--that was a nice touch too. I really liked the one with Mitchell and his girlfriend from the 60's.)

And something else with the Mitchell character that I feel I need to add:  I really feel astonished with where the writers took him this time around.

It's like whenever I used to think of him, he was almost like the 'father' figure of the group. And it made so much sense. Because it was like he provided the balance and structure of how George and Annie got along.

Only in this season, he sorta crosses that line. (Or really abandons it!)

Because to hear Mitchell say (to Annie) 'I just think about your body...under those clothes. I think about your skin...' This is a NEW Mitchell indeed!

Because before all this commentary, I NEVER gleaned any kind of 'physical' attraction between Mitchell and Annie. (That is, it never crossed my mind that he could be attracted to her like that.) I mean, because he'd always seemed like this jovial 'big brother' type to me.

Now, not so much.

And so like I said in my title, the second season of 'Being Human' really DID turn the corner!

And maybe that's not such a bad thing after all.

Watch and ENJOY!!!",1287273600,,4955,4.467258601553829
4213351,4,B003WEAW2C,"Returning for a second season, vampire Mitchell (Aidan Turner), werewolf George (Russell Tovey), and ghost Annie (Lenora Crichlow) face all new challenges in their hopes of leading normal human lives. Mitchell is dealing with the fallout of the vampire community left without its leader. And meanwhile, he begins a relationship with a new doctor with dark secrets of her own. George also finds a new girlfriend, but her daughter is wary of him. And Annie deals with constant changes and challenges to being non-corporeal.

This season ramps up the suspense and violence to a whole new level. The trio are faced with a new enemy this season: CenSSA, a religious organization headed by a man with a deeply-rooted vendetta.  Mitchell takes a dark turn to his former blood-thirsty and violent self that I didn't care for. It also didn't make much sense when he drastically shifts mind-sets and moods without much provocation. Most of his decisions and actions this season seem severely out of character, even before he is betrayed. He never seemed to care much for the vampire community until they are left without a leader. Now, he cares more for them than humans.  Despite this, the plot and pacing throughout the season is non-stop suspense, thrills and chills. While the viewer knows what's going on most of the time, it's fun to watch the mysteries unfold through the eyes of Mitchell, George, and Annie. And seen in blu-ray is all the more thrilling and captivating.  Fans of the fantasy and horror genres should not miss this incredible series.",1286323200,2,1547,4.938461538461539
4213352,5,B003WEAW2C,I just found out about this show and in the past 3 weeks have downloaded and watched the entire first season and just started with season 2.  Season 2 is a tad darker than season 1 was but it justs keep getting better and better.,1285977600,,229,4.088888888888889
4213353,4,B003WEAW2C,"Life -- and occasionally undeath -- just keep getting more complicated for the three supernatural roommates of ""Being Human."" The second season is a much darker affair than the one before it, and while there are occasional patches of lighthearted fun (""Clowns... so many... clowns!""), the real focus here is on the dangers both to AND from the supernatural world.

About a month after Herrick's death, things have gotten complex for everybody. Annie has decided to get a job at the local pub, leading her to meet a man who is being manipulated by the spirits of the dead. George's strained relationship with Nina takes a new turn when it's discovered that he accidentally infected her. And with Herrick gone, Mitchell is struggling to keep the vampires from being discovered -- and may have to do some morally repulsive things to succeed.

Along the way, they have to deal with Annie's matchmaking efforts, vampire attacks, Mitchell's mentor falling off the wagon, George's efforts to quell his lycanthropy (and how THAT backfires), a senseless psychic, and Mitchell falling for a pretty doctor.

Unfortunately, the little gang has become an object of interest to the mysterious Kemp and his organization, who are determined to wipe out the supernatural population (""Beasts should be kept in cages""). And though the gang are not aware of them, Kemp's group is drawing closer and uncovering more and more of their secrets, until disaster strikes.

The first season of ""Being Human"" was a pretty even mix of horror, comedy and drama, but the second season is a lot darker and more painful. More blood, more angst, more glimpses of the horror of being a werewolf/vampire/ghost/whatever -- and Kemp's cold-blooded approach is a pretty horrible one (example: the scene where a werewolf is prevented from shifting).

But fortunately, the series has retained its3 wit (a werewolf afraid of clowns, a vampire who throws a tantrum when he misses his favorite TV show) and delicious dialogue (""This can't be happening to me! I teach language!"" ""You could teach BAD language""). And the writers tighten up the storylines with new problems for each supernatural group, which get progressively worse as the season goes on.

The downside: a vein of anti-religious sentiment running through the season. Yeah, of course ONLY religious fanatics would hate werewolves, vampires and ghosts, and the ONLY possible response to the supernatural would be... you guessed it: religious fanaticism. How cliche.

The three lead actors are still doing brilliant jobs as three very eccentric roommates: Lenora Crichlow's Annie is charming and sweet as a good-natured ghost, who is just trying to live her own life; Russell Tovey's George goes through some painful patches as he continues to struggle with life as a nerdy werewolf (although he's a complete jerk in Episode 1). And Aidan Turner does a truly brilliant job as a ""clean"" vampire who is slowly slipping down the moral slope.

""Being Human Season Two"" is a darker, grimmer affair than the first season, but it's still pretty good TV with loads of supernatural drama. And it leaves you waiting for more.",1280707200,26,3132,5.0562015503875966
4213354,5,B003WEAW2C,I loved season one and season two was NOT a disappointment! It's different and fun and worth owning as it's a series you can watch over and over again.,1280707200,7,151,4.241379310344827
4213355,5,B003WEAW2C,"American buyers should be aware that this BluRay title is encoded at a 50hz refresh rate, which is INCOMPATIBLE with most American BluRay players and TV sets (yes, the PS3 is one of the players these won't work on).

You have to have one of the following two setups to play this (or any other) 1080/50hz disc:

1. a player that can output 50hz discs at their native 50hz rate, PLUS a TV that can accept a 50hz 1080i input signal
2. a player that can convert the 50hz refresh to the 60hz standard preferred by American sets. This is similar to a PAL-to-NTSC standards conversion

VERY FEW American players/HDTVs can cope with 50hz discs. The Oppo players (BDP-80 and BDP-83) are among the few that can both output 50hz native AND convert it to 60hz, depending on your needs.

MOST British television shows these days are shot in 1080/50hz, because the Eurpoean HDTV standard is still on the same 50hz refresh rate that the old PAL standard was on. Many (but not all) British BluRays are encoded at that same 50hz rate to keep the signal pure/as intended, although some are converted to 60hz to appeal to the import/export market, so it's always best to do your research on these things!

UPDATE! UPDATE! UPDATE!  There will be a Region-A (American-compatible) release of this happening September 21st, so if you can wait a couple months, those of you without the 50hz technology will be able to finally see the episodes without possibly importing the British set which likely won't work on your equipment.",1277164800,35,1504,4.699619771863118

4213443,2,B003WEAW2C,"after Being Human US I had an expectation of not the same story being told with different characters, but some cross over between the two with a common underlying story.  Not that the US show couldn't have been better it could, but unfortunately the UK version was a step in the wrong direction.  As I pointed out in my review of Season 1, the show is really 3 related shows: seasons 1-3, 4 and 5 all basically stand alone with the prior ones as a backdrop story.  Season 2 continues to disappoint with the story taking to large of jumps without filling in the details and never obtaining any vesting of the audience in the characters so that we are rooting for ""our hero's"".  They aren't hero's as the episode synopsis says, they are messed up monsters who were messed up humans, yet trying to be human.  Annie in her innocence is probably the bright spot as George is a dweeb and Mitchell a skank.  Their friendship is far from believable and the main points of the story continually come across as side points instead of the critical points.  I so wanted Being Human UK to be Being Human US with it's warts removed, but instead it continues to be a version with more flaws.  The relationship of the characters growing is somewhat realistic between Annie and each of the others, but not between Mitchell and George.  They're both so busy being self centered that they just don't draw in audience concern.  Annie's purpose isn't even apparent until season 4, and without it season 4 is a platform for her purpose and an introduction to two completely new characters.  I just can't deal with a show that never cracks 10 episodes a season yet turns over its main characters as soon as major development occur that could make the story interesting.  The one positive is that the traditional characteristics of the werewolves and vampires is more in keeping with the historical story of what they are, aren't, can and can't do than the US version that diverts pretty far from that path.  There was something to work with that could have brought this up to a 4 star show and season, but they missed the boat.",1406332800,,2104,4.5638297872340425

4213470,5,B003WEAW2C,"I saw a promo commercial for Season 2 (Series 2 if you're British). Had no idea what I was watching. Just saw this cliche' of a hottie sitting on a couch, and this beautiful chick tells him and the other guy, ""Okay, shut up I'm gonna tell you...""  The commercial ends with the dark hottie saying, ""The disembodied ghost of a dead woman is getting a job...""  ""My mind was completely blown at the concept.  I was awed that that was a ghost, even more awed that the guys could see her, and just hella curious.  My obsession began in that instant. I searched and discovered the show was about A ghost, a vampire and a werewolf who were roomates.  But I couldn't find the damned show!  Then I saw a Syfy commercial for Being Human.  I got all excited, and marked by calender and set my DVR -but when I saw the Syfy show, I was HELLA DISAPPOINTED. These weren't the same people I saw from that commercial.
I set out to Google once again and found the show I had been jonesin' for was the BBC original.  That SYFY created an American remake.
I was so desperate, that I settled in for what ever crumbs they threw at me. I accepted the American version.  It was cool enough.
THEN...I...DISCOVERED...BBCAMERICA.
And it was ON-LIKE-DONKEY-KONG.
The BBC original is just pure magic. They are lovely and funny and tragic.  The characters are so awesome.  the writing is so innovative. The actor delivery is so magnanimus.  And not just the three main characters.  Some of the best scenes were with the guest characters.  Herrick is just brilliant as a character. Not to mention, the story with the social worker in season 2.  She has this ""bitch slap ya"" line with her lap top that will just split your sides.
The adventures of the original trio stay embedded in ones heart for months and years to come.  Flashbacks of scenes and scenarios that are just meaningful on an indescribable level.
There's a true love between these characters that everyone must experience at least once. One experience is all it takes typically to get hooked into all of the first three seasons.  And out of pure loyalty, It makes sense to stick around for the final two.  Different cast in the 4th and 5th seasons. But they win our hearts in the end.
Theres no replacing Mitchell, George, and Annie. To be fair, there's no replacing Nina either.
I would recommend checking them out on Amazon PRIME, the eps are free at the moment (though they are shortened by 15mins compared to the DVDs -you really don't miss much.)
Try BBCAmerica's Being Human.

I was sorry to see it end, although when Aidan Turner left the show, it went downhill for me.  The three main characters in the first 3 seasons really were to good to be replaced.

4213479,5,B003WEAW2C,"This series about three primary characters and the situation they find themselves in is sometimes humorous, sometimes horrifying and almost always has a reality feel to it.

The acting is superb, the intensity and the drama focused and never corny which I find amazing.  I've watched a few of the American made series and didn't like it, but possibly because I started watching this series first and find the acting and actors to be believable.",1388793600,,444,4.906666666666666

4213492,5,B003WEAW2C,"I just happened on this series this past fall while browsing the BBC station on Xfinity On Demand. Fell in love with the three/four main characters. Watched all programs in first three seasons totally engrossed. Tried watching beyond the third season but it just wasn't the same without Aidan Turner's Mitchell. Once I learned Aidan was cast in The Hobbit trilogy, I purchased the first three seasons of BH and have recently enjoyed watching all three once again.  The writing, the backdrops -- especially the two ""homes"", the supporting actors were all superb.  The very best part of this series for me was the chemistry between the four main characters.  It drew me in and kept me entranced every minute.  Well done!.",1388620800,,719,4.868852459016393

4213500,4,B003WEAW2C,"Note:  This is really the same thing I said in my first season series as I felt the first three seasons were very enjoyable.

I really enjoyed the first three seasons of this series.  After the main characters left though (other than Annie) it really went down hill fast.  I really felt Annie should have left as well as her character alone was too weak to keep the show going, and by the end of the fourth season I actually cheered when her character finally left the show. The fifth season isn't free with amazon prime, and I definitely wouldn't pay to watch it as it just wasn't going in a good direction by then.

In summery, I would definitely recommend the first three seasons, but anything after than isn't really worth watching.",1379116800,,736,4.503759398496241

4213502,5,B003WEAW2C,"I have been a big fan of Being Human (the UK version).  I love the characters, and the stories where there is no clear definition of good and evil, black and white.  John Mitchell is such a tragic figure, trying so hard to do the right thing and be a ""good"" person while it seems so many forces both human and supernatural are there to tempt or force him back to the ""dark side.""

4213508,5,B003WEAW2C,Anyone who liked the first series will definitely like the second. The story lines are interesting and fun. The characters are awesome the actors who play them help to make the show what it is. Its not your typical vampire werewolf kind of show. Its easy to get into and doesn't feel like something you've already seen before. If you're looking for a new show to watch I would definitely suggest being human.,1374364800,,408,4.602739726027397

4213510,5,B003WEAW2C,"I seriously love this show; the characters are well developed but continue to grow as they face each new challenge of ""ordinary"" life. The first season we meet all the characters and get to know them, but in this season, we see a lot more of what is lying under the surface. True colors start to show with a major confrontation between a religious group hell bent on destroying the likes of vampires, curing werewolves, and exorcising ghosts - and of course, our favorite group of supernatural roommates. We see them at their breaking points, how they react to extreme situations, but then how they emerge and go on from there.

4213512,5,B003WEAW2C,"I don't even know exactly why I like it so much.  I guess it's because I am now attached to each of the three main characters despite (or maybe because of) their insecurities and often self destructive behavior.  I also like that an episode can be very dark but have lighthearted, funny moments.  If you aren't a fan of violence and a bit of gore, this show probably isn't for you.",1370736000,,381,4.338028169014085

4213516,4,B003WEAW2C,"This season, the British took a different direction as the United States (US) version.  I'm not so sure one is any better than the other.  They're just different, although there are still some similarities.  One of the things I do prefer in the British version is they don't buy into the ridiculous puritanical restrictions we see here in the US.  I'm referring  to the natural dialogue (F and S bombs) and the less restrictive nudity.  The British version dialoge is more representative as to how people actually speak. It doesn't feel sensationalistic, it's more in line with day-to-day conversation.  In the US, you would think such dialoge (FCC restricted words) would cause children and adults alike to jump off of a 12 story building after hearing such mind altering language.  It's absurd!  Oh well, I've started season three...stay tuned.",1366588800,,846,5.028776978417266

Although Mitchell the vampire was still darkly brooding and magnetic his conflicts came more to the fore and more evocative. He loves not wisely but too well  might have been written for him.
The werewolf reveals complexities (speaking six languages?) heretofore unknown amongst lycanthropes. He still looks funny - but a smart funny. Even Better.
Silly goodhearted Annie is the emotional lightweight and the victim of all the dramatic fallout.

Sensitive brooding guy, a touch dysfunctional, but basically a guy fighting a battle within himself to be human, and good. You learn a lot more about his sometimes buddy/enemy Herrick and their history. Also, you learn that Annie, who can't always be seen, chooses to see what she wants to. Her relationship wasn't exactly how she remembered it. George, well, he too tries to fit in, and gets a little better at romancing the ladies.

4213566,5,B003WEAW2C,"I have watched both the UK and US versions of Being Human and much prefer the UK version.  Although it gets serious, it has much more humor and cast seems to have better chemistry.  In season 1, the first few episodes are the ones they copied the US version from, but by 3rd or 4th episode, the storylines diverge significantly.  I feel the UK version has a better story going for it.  Features Aidan Turner, now known for being Kili in The Hobbit, Lenora Crichlow who has also appeared in Dr. Who, and Russel Tovey who has a very good role in Little Dorrit.",1360713600,,558,4.336538461538462

4213582,5,B003WEAW2C,"Season 2 finds the characters from Season 1 developing more complex problems in trying to quietly live in human society.  Nina's role expands and there are complexities with her and George's relationship.  There is a human group that is determined to study or end supernatural beings. Mitchell tries to have a relationship but is being pulled back into vampire society.  Annie is caught in the midddle of it all.

This is a great season as all of the characters are starting to have to face their demons so to speak.  The scary part is that some of their character flaws that are causing problems are not specifically realed to what they are, but rather who they are.  This is the thing that is best about this series, that the problems are not specifically tied to being supernatural.  They are human problems and things that the viewer can probably identify with.

One additional note, make sure that you are purchasing the BBC version of the show. This series is being re-made by the Syfy channel and both sets of DVDs are sold off of the same page. The BBC version is the one listed as starring Lenora Crichlow.",1358812800,,1115,4.624365482233503
4213583,5,B003WEAW2C,"Despite being one of the many many fiction works about vampires and werewolves these days, ""Being Human"" has the ability not to become just another one. It stands out because it has heart. The supernatural factors are just that, factors, with the core of the series being finding yourself, fitting in, overcoming obstacles. It's funny, charming, has the right amount of drama, and suspense. And you got to give it to the brits: they are not afraid to be graphic, which in this case is quite refreshing. Definitely a great series. Loved it!",1357257600,,539,4.806451612903226
4213584,2,B003WEAW2C,"I know this is the original series of being human and the US one is based off of this one but I find it to not have that much comedy or drama and definitely not a lot of darkness to it which one would normally expect from something involving a werewolf, vampire, and ghost as antagonists.",1356739200,,288,4.160714285714286
4213585,5,B003WEAW2C,"While still uneven at times, with it's goofy moments of humor not always meshing smoothly with it's darker and more emotional sides, the serieshas grown a bit in it's 2nd season.  While still not (for me) up with the all time great series like The Wire or Mad Men or Breaking Bad, at it's best, it's an amazingly potent mix of heartrending drama, dark, off-beat humor and some effective horror as well.

But this is horror with all the rules reversed, with the `monsters' being the human race, and the heroes our vampire werewolf and ghost who simplywant to live like other people.  At times, in an odd way it reminded me of ""Dexter"", the outsider with scary possibilities, who wants to fit in.  But whereas Dexter is all about emotions repressed, here the emotions are on the sleeve (occasionally a bit too much, and there are a few soapy moments).

Much like the first season this starts strong, seems to lose its way a bit in the middle, with some forced humor, and repetitive moments but finishes with such a kick that its easy to forgive any lapses.  The acting is on a very high level, the writing is witty and human, and the direction and camerawork can be very effective at creating mood and scares on a TV budget.  Not perfect perhaps, but it's a rare TV show that can make me think, laugh, cry, and send a shiver down my spine all in one episode.  Some great and inventive use of rock tunes to set the mood tops it off.",1356566400,,1429,4.406844106463878

4213589,5,B003WEAW2C,"Slightly difficult to start, this series or season finally finds its rhythm and its pace in the chase of the bigot priest. Is it the chase of the bigot priest by the monsters, or is it the chase of the monsters by the bigot priest? Both probably. But once this chase is started it gets speed and strength frame after frame. Speedy Gonzalez is playing the road runner.

The three friends of ours, plus the brand new female werewolf, and a few occasional acquaintances, are confronted to strong and powerful choices to make. To abstain from drinking blood, hence killing, for the vampires, or to go on with the blood festival. For the werewolves to transform inside a cage or to go on transforming in nature. For the ghost to go on being a spirit invisible to everyone or to go on and proceed to the other side of the door.

And in-between the werewolfish changes what about having a normal; creative and fully productive life? And in-between the drinking episodes or the Bloodoholics Anonymous meetings what about having a job and a social life in your neighbourhood and in your community, if you are a member of any community. For the ghost it is more difficult because a ghost is a ghost all the time and there is no in-between episodes. The ghost can just satisfy him/herself by making cups of tea she/he will never drink.

All that would be simple if the normal people around them in society were a little more empathetic and supportive. But alas there are on both sides some fundamentalists. Either the fundamentalists of monstrousness for whom there is no possible change of the monsters who have to just follow their ways, their genes. On the normal human side there are also some fundamentalist Christian (in this series) who consider it their duty to kill as many monsters as possible in order to save them, which means to get them away from normal society. That has a name: ethnic cleansing or eugenics.

The worst part in this confrontation is that there will always be a scientist who will justify the eugenic ethnic cleansing on the human side, and some ancestor who will always say that things have always been the way they will always be, or vice versa, on the monster side. In other words there is no possible escape from these various dilemmas.

But please do not use this very serious discussion as a metaphor of any kind of ethnic confrontation. The people of the other ethnic groups than yours are not vampires, werewolves or ghosts. They are just as human as you, so it does not work. But what about meeting some extraterrestrials tomorrow? The only point that can be generalized is that there will always be fundamentalists on any side of any divide, even when the divide is phantasmagorical. Unluckily we can say fundamentalism is a basic dimension of the human mind and behaviour. God help the poor, the rich, the weak, the meek or the powerful all alike.

The series becomes then interesting though maybe slightly too dense in the peripeteias inhabiting the underbrush of the story and we get fearful because there might be some werewolf or vampire behind some heather or ferns. But I do like the various views we get of Bristol now and then.

The end of this series is so full of twists we cannot even start summarizing it. Sorry folks no spoilers, for once, I am not a party pooper. I generally go poop in some private place with highly selected company.

Toby Whithouse is a genius he takes his time in exploring the characters and their stories, yes there's less episodes but better story lines. It's too much of a copy the US version and rushes through the stories and doesn't allow for the character development. It's not as gritty or brilliant either ok stories but I will stick with my original love being human uk.

The actors are better and I am sorry but I hate sally i find her way too annoying! I understand they are trying to create their own version and get past the UK to make new stories by having all three seasons of the Uk version happening in one, but if they really wanted to do that they shouldn't of copied and pasted all the stories from the UK version and rearrange them and add a few extra tidbits and dialogue inbetween.

I say stick with the original and watch all three series through not just an episode or two before you make your decision. Being Human UK is the best!!!!

4213599,3,B003WEAW2C,"I had mixed feelings about the second season of the BBC's 'Being Human'.  The first half was as good as it gets; Mitchell trying to get Britain's vampires to swear off blood (and killing) and George trying sleeping pills to make the monthly transition to werewolf a little less, well, traumatic.  But, no good deed goes unpunished.  And Annie, the ghost, finds a boyfriend of sorts, only to have a unique problem with him.

The thing I didn't like was the last two episodes.  Mitchell has a terrible change of heart after a tragedy, and Annie gets swept up in the Anglican priest's experiments in dealing with those represented by the three housemates.  Mitchell's change is especially terrible; you can no longer sympathize with this young hunkish misfit.  He and his erstwhile girlfriend are reunited, and things are not well in Bristol.  George maintains, but Annie has the rug pulled out from under her, and she's powerless to prevent her sudden change of scenery.

Mitchell must become more sympathetic for me to root for him.  Ditch the old girlfriend, avoid the new girlfriend (well, that's not a problem) and get in good graces with the people in Bristol again.

Maybe season three will sort it all out.  Let's hope!",1305763200,,1224,4.803827751196172

Mitchell is an agonized vampire, with a sense of humor and real feelings for his flatmates. George is so sweet and sensitive, you'de never believe he is a werewolf unless you saw him change. Annie is my favorite! She is sweet, sensitive, agonized and quite fun!

Two episodes into the first season and I was hooked, particularly with the oddball nerd turned werewolf, played by Russell Tovey. Season Two continues the fun, though it's a bit darker, as many have noted. I won't say it's a perfect show, but there's plenty to think about, including the idea that, if God created man in his own image, could he have also created beings in the image of his wrath and rage?",1290988800,,563,4.423076923076923
4213636,4,B003WEAW2C,"I found the first season of Being Human to be kind of a mixed bag, no so with this season, it is great, different and interesting. Again we follow the lives of three supernatural creatures, Mitchell a vampire, Anna a ghost and George a werewolf, this time they are joined by a second werewolf, Nina who get accidentally scratched by George at the end of season 1. This time around there is allot more going on. I would say there are four main plot lines, one is Mitchell having to try to handle a vampire society now left leaderless after the events of season one, then we have George trying to deal with his relationship with Nina, then we have Anna being threatened by whatever lies beyond death which want her back, and then we have the main plot line of a organization of monster hunters who have their eye on the main characters.

Again this show is as much about the everyday life of the four main characters as it is about a fantasy storyline, the show very much deals with the difficulties of being different. In a way the supernatural elements of this show get even more there and in your face because of the mundane events which surrounds them. If you liked the first season, even if you only liked it a little bit, you will love the second season, and really I would recommend the whole of the Being Human series to anyone who like modern fantasy and the supernatural. The show is very original and everything good in the first season is amplified ten fold in the second one.

My only complaint about the season is the length. English TV series seasons tend to be short and I would have loved to see this story get more time to develop, and just see more of these wonderful characters. However the show do make good use of their time and it do not feel rushed. All in all I would say this is a very good series which drive the story onward in a satisfying way.",1290643200,3,1871,4.3428571428571425

I would like to hear the background music and overall noise reduced a bit so I can hear the dialog more clearly.
An episode guide is a must. Not having one makes for a lot of searching through each episode to find something one might be looking for is annoying at best.
I hope all three will be a bit more realistic towards each others feelings.

8407313,5,B003WEAW2C,"Season 2 of Being Human pulled me right in after the finale episode of Season 1. Thoroughly hooked, I went into Season 2 hoping they would keep up the good work and they didn't disappoint. Our characters are still their intense yet fun and lovable selves, but season 2 did take a darker turn that enhanced the suspense to such a degree I couldn't stop watching. I think I watched Season 2 within 24 hours. I couldn't stop myself and I know I stayed up until midnight to see the Season 2 finale. Every show has its ups and downs and this show is no different, but the downs are so few that you hardly even remember them as you move on to the next episode. Very excited to finish Season 3 and post my next review!",1497916800,,711,4.197080291970803
