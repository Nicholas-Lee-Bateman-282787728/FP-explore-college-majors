6556820,5,B00M4BCFH4,"Batman was only second in popularity to Superman in the 'Super Hero' world of DC comics. Deadpan humor, sharp clear colorful images and costumes, gorgeous females, clever gadgets, catchy theme music... it's all here.

Some interesting facts about Adam West:

Was the third actor to play Batman (though some may credit him as the first, as the old serials are much more obscure than West's television series Batman (1966)).

According to DC Comics statistics, Batman stands 6-foot-2. Of all the actors who have played Batman, West is believed to be the only one who stood the same height.

Had his creative dentist add a little black Batman logo to one of his molars.

Before he was a successful actor, he worked as a radio disc jockey, where he founded a military television station that his knack for deadpan comedy expanded.

Future comedians Conan O'Brien, Drew Carey, Bill Maher, Ross Shafer, radio disc jockey Howard Stern, The Simpsons (1989) Matt Groening, reality television show participant Lorenzo Lamas and weatherman/game show announcer Rich Fields, all said West was their childhood television hero.

Before he was a successful actor, he also worked as an island tour guide.

He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6764 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on April 5, 2012.

Began his television series Batman (1966) at age 37.

6556821,5,B00M4BCFH4,"Wow look at this-- a review from a person who actually BOUGHT the DVD and has it already!
The transfer is stunning, you'll be amazed at the details you'll see that you never noticed before.  The colors are rich and lush and the shadows are deep and black.

The episodes themselves, for this first season, are the best of the series.  The pilot in particular starts out pretty straight and there are some very serious undertones to it (Bruce talking about the murder of his parents, etc).

The show was innovative then and it remains innovative today, and with these DVDs you get to see it again for the first time.

Menu wise, Warner gave this little thought, the most basic menu you could find, and zero extras, but if you want just the shows, this is what you should get.",1415664000,13,773,4.453900709219858
6556822,5,B00M4BCFH4,"I'm pretty happy about Batman the Series being released on DVD, but I have to let you all know my raw feelings and impressions; 1. Picture: Beautiful picture, very sharp and crisp. 2. Audio: VERY GOOD, except for the PILOT EPISODE, the rest of them definitely sound remastered. 3. Special Features; absolutely NONE. Kind of a dissapointment. 4. One perk, is that this is NOT in letter box format, and what a relief that is! That was something I was worried about, but the ratio is the same as you remember watching it when you were a kid! 5. NICE COMPACT case! (The same standard size case that usually houses a single DVD, manages to house 5!!)  BARE BONES, but overall- I'm just very happy to have it on DVD finally!",1415577600,31,718,4.480916030534351
6556823,5,B00M4BCFH4,Batman season 1 started it all. Because of all the guest stars in it plus the show back in 1966 skyrocketed up the ladder to 1 place in ratings. It had all the villains from the comics and thats what made this show so popular so if you can't afford the deluxe edition buy the seasons separate now. Because after season 2 the show started to go down hill and and season 2 and 3 will be coming out soon they don't have no date yet though.,1414886400,6,436,4.022988505747127
6556824,5,B00M4BCFH4,"I agree with other's on this ! Hey Warner Brother's What The Heck Took You so long?
Did you not see that releasing this fabulous Tv Series gem wouldn't be a money maker for you!
Holy Bat video's/dvd's Batman! A true bat-fan's dream! I already pre-ordered mine early in August!
I also bought An official Mattel Classic Batman tv series utility belt on E-bay too! Holy Bat WOW!!!!!",1409270400,3,379,4.588235294117647
6556825,4,B00M4BCFH4,"Please remember that season one was only a half season - Batman was a winter replacement show. It was on twice a week, so the episode number seems like a full regular season. You can expect the individual season set for year 2 to be more expensive because it'll have more episodes.  As was pointed out after my review went live, Season 3 went from two episodes a week to 1, so it will have fewer episodes than season 1, even though it was twice as long calendar-wise.

Having said that, Season 1 is the lightning in the bottle. By Season 2 the celebrity cameos and guest-villains started taking over, and by season 3 they added Batgirl to try to spice things up because the show was fading so fast.  But Season 1 - that's what everyone remembers so fondly.",1407110400,83,756,4.385714285714286
6556826,5,B00M4BCFH4,That's a switch. It looks like buying the individual seasons may be a better deal than the complete DVD set. Currently $35 for season 1. If that price holds for season 2 and 3 then times 3 = $105. The complete set is currently $135.,1407024000,8,232,4.177777777777778

6556828,5,B00M4BCFH4,"While I am giving the show a 5 star review, I would rather buy the complete set. $35 is an decent price for 1 season, but why wait for all 3 seasons to come out when the complete set is going to be released. For me, and a lot of others, we do not want to wait for them to release season 2 then season 3. The Blu-ray with digital copy complete set is in my view the better choice.",1406592000,7,379,3.75

6556841,5,B00M4BCFH4,"""Batman: Season 1"" represents the classic series at its best, for many reasons.

Many of this season's episodes were adapted, either directly or indirectly, from stories appearing in ""Batman"" and ""Detective Comics"" magazines. Lorenzo Semple Jr.'s pilot script, ""Hi Diddle Riddle/Smack in the Middle,"" for example, was based upon a story which had appeared less than one year earlier in the pages of ""Batman."" Semple's pop-art adventure writing style defined this season before his participation declined and writers more inclined to camp comedy and outright slapstick took over and sent the series into creative decline.

Also, writers during this season were more inclined to use villains such as the Joker, the Penguin, Catwoman and the Riddler-all of whom had originated in comics-rather than creating their own.

This season also prominently features Frank Gorshin's wonderfully insane portrayal of the Prince of Puzzlers. Gorshin appeared in nine episodes, then held out for a salary increase during Season 2 in the wake of his Emmy nomination. One Riddler script was rewritten for the Puzzler; the other was produced with John Astin in the role. Astin's a fine actor, but he merely inhabited the role, whereas Gorshin defined it. He returned for one episode in the forgettable final season.

Stars Adam West and Burt Ward are also in top form, facing the most absurd of situations and delivering simple moral lessons with great seriousness.

Visually, Fox Television was spending money on the series, which showed in the elaborate sets and the use of rotoscoping to superimpose comic book sound effects on each episode's climactic Batfights.

If you can afford to purchase only one season of the ""Batman"" series, this is the one.",1477267200,2,1735,5.223021582733813

6556844,5,B00M4BCFH4,"Yes, it's corny. But it's also great fun to relive the days of my youth by watching these episodes. This was before every thing became so dark and grim/foreboding. Even though it was the height of the Cold War and we lived under the shadow of nuclear annihilation, it was a simpler, more innocent time, I think, and this show kind of reflected that. It was purposely aimed at spoofing the so-called flower child culture of the time, but never mean-spirited. The heroes were honest and clean living, dare I say wholesome, and the villains were all colorful, with dastardly intentions, but bumbling just enough that you knew that Batman and Robin would always prevail. And the '66 Batmobile built by legendary Hollywood car crafter George Barris using a Ford prototype car called a Futura is still the best one of all to date.",1470873600,,824,4.729166666666667

Additional Notes:

The Batman boxset was originally released with missing footage. Season One deletions included:

01 The William Dozier narration that originally opened the pilot episode, 'Hi Diddle Riddle'.

02 An assembly of villain tags from the end of various episodes.

Kudos to Warner Bros for listening to the fans and correcting the errors and sending corrected discs to all of the fans that bought the botched pressings and requested a replacement.

All pressings released since the original batch have been corrected. You can tell you have a corrected set by checking out the first disc. In addition to having the narration restored to 'Hi Diddle Riddle', there are some bonus features on the new pressings...

01 Next Week Villains - 7:52 : Rather than restore each tag back to the endings of each episode, WB opted to included them all in one place.

02 Batman's Amazing Arsenal - 0:39

By itself, this did not necessarily mean the product was used, except that two of the discs had fingerprints on them, and the other discs showed obvious signs of being wiped clean.

Our boy is in his mid thirties and loves superheros, but he was not interested.  This may be because of the impression that the show is campy and stupid.  I agree that some of the characters or situations are a little goofy, but that is part of the fun.  Give it a try and I think you would also grow fond of the series.

6556890,4,B00M4BCFH4,"This abbreviated season from 20th Century Fox was the one that started the Batman phenomenon when it debuted on ABC in the Winter of 1966 making this comic book character into animation by having Adam West portraying Batman as well as stellar millionaire Bruce Wayne and Burt Ward as Batman's sidekick Robin & Bruce's ward(Dick Grayson), fighting surging crime in Gotham City, NY against unruly crooks like Joker(Cesar Romero), Riddler(Frank Gorshin), Catwoman(Julie Newmar), and Penguin(Burgess Meredith)during this series 1966-68 run on ABC, which showed twice a week with a cliffhanger.

This BATMAN series also had some interesting guest starred villains to such as
*David Wayne as The Mad Hatter
*Roddy McDowell as The Bookworm
*Art Carney as The Archer
*Van Johnson as The Minstrel
*Vincent Price as Egghead
*Milton Berle as Louie the Lilac
*Rudy Vallee as Lord Marmaduke Fogg
*Liberace as Chandelle
I used to watch BATMAN in reruns in syndication as a kid and then on the back then Family Channel in 1989, and then on FX from 1995-98, then on TV Land from 2002-03, and now I watch it on MeTV every Saturday night at 7PM before catching WONDER WOMAN at 8PM as part of MeTV's Sci-Fi Saturdays.",1428278400,,1198,4.960199004975125

6556892,3,B00M4BCFH4,"Nostalgia can have its limits, and when I watched these episodes almost half a century after their first appearance, I found that I hit the wall rather early. I recall sitting down religiously to soak in every moment of the Adam West Batman series, from beginning to end, but I must say -- and I realize that my opinion is very much in the minority -- that the whole thing doesn't hold up well with the passage of time. To be sure, there are some nice touches, and if one can put one's self back in the mid-60s, it all goes down reasonably well. There are Dutch angles galor, a vibrant use of color -- reproduced wonderfully well in this set -- and some inventive plot elements.

In the end, though, I found this set sinking in its own repetition and tiresome melodramatic mood. Sadly, the producers at the time believed that the only way a comic book character could be sold to the general television audience was in the context of campy humor, which as I said, simply has not aged well. There are wonderful portrayals of the Penguin by Burgess Meredith, Catwoman by Julie Newmar, and the Riddler by Frank Gorshin, and Alan Napier, Neil Hamilton and Stafford Repp do marvelous support as Alfred, Gordon and O'Hara, respectively. However, one can take Burt Wards incessant ""Holy [insert noun here]"" and West's mannered delivery just so much.

Still, there's no denying that the show had a cultural impact and an effect on the Batman mythos in its way. I certainly don't dislike these early episodes; I just find that I've moved on.",1427760000,2,1531,4.604395604395604

Season One is remastered very well, full-frame as it was originally shown on ABC, with eye-popping color and a sharpness to the picture that we've never seen before.  The sound is also remastered, not in stereo, but in the original mono, crisp and clean.  Only two options are available for sound, English and. . .Portuguese?  Well, at least we have subtitles in English, French, Spanish and...Portuguese.  The menus, as is the usual for Warners these days, suck.  Titles against a blue swirl background.  Yawn.  No commentaries.  No special features.  And the DVD labels are plain, red on red.  Well, at least we finally have BATMAN on legit DVD.

6556911,4,B00M4BCFH4,"Over the years, Batman '66 has attracted lots of criticism from comic book fans who dislike its campy take on the Caped Crusader. But I find this series to be oddly enjoyable, and a charming alternative to Christopher Nolan's grim Dark Knight trilogy. Yes, the more serious versions of Batman are more rewarding, in some ways...but *this* Batman is the most fun by a mile.

And I'll tell you something - this show is far more faithful to the Batman comic books than I was led to believe. Batman is his usual self here; he's a dedicated crime fighter who uses his detective skills, high-tech gadgets and amazing fighting abilities to defeat criminals. Sounds like Batman to me. His major difference from today's Batman is that he doesn't brood as much, which to me is a bonus. The villains are faithfully portrayed, too; the Riddler riddles, Catwoman is a beautiful cat burglar and Penguin aspires to enter high society. Not much has changed in the decades since this show came out. Only the Joker is unrecognizable, since he's more of a pest here than a serious threat. (However, it's worth noting that the Joker was also a goofy character in the Batman comic books of this period, which were campy before the show was.)

So that's my two cents on the misleading (IMHO) reputation of Batman '66. How about the DVD package itself? Well, the prints look great. The show's production designers made free use of bright colors and wacky special effects that just pop out of the screen. Details are very clear, too; I could easily make out the seam in Penguin's fake nose, Burt Ward's stunt double, and the Joker's mustache that's barely concealed under his white makeup. Good times! I suppose the Blu Ray print must be even better...and yet, I'd advise buyers to think twice before splurging on the more expensive Blu Rays. The DVD print is great - far superior to the Batman prints I've seen on television - and the Blu Ray might not be worth the extra dough.

So why four stars instead of five? Well, the DVD set has no extras to speak of, unless you count a lame assortment of clips on Disc One that isn't worth the 30 seconds it takes to watch. Also, the show itself is great fun...really great fun...but inconsistent. Some episodes, like the Riddler ones, are quite witty in addition to being enjoyably camp. Other episodes, like the Joker ones, tend to be simply ridiculous and not all that witty. Another problem is the show's repetitive formula - how many times do the villains knock people out with purple gas? Still, even the worst episodes give me a few laughs. Just try not to binge by watching 10+ episodes at once; you may end up feeling like you've eaten too much candy in one sitting.",1425859200,2,2695,4.622129436325679

6556916,5,B00M4BCFH4,"Batman was the very first show I watched on a color TV as a young child. I often watched it in reruns as a young adult; now I'm looking at it through the eyes of a middle-aged person, and as an amateur reviewer.

For the first time I'm noticing how the 1966 Batman Live-Action TV Show was a product of its times, in much the same way the 1950's Adventures of Superman (AOS) was. There is a little moralizing in Season One, none of which I really noticed as a child; also brief references to God and prayer. As in AOS, despite being a ""kiddie"" show, the regular actors and guest stars take their roles seriously, even if the plot-lines weren't always very good. I will elaborate more on this later.

Episode-wise, season 1 has mostly the ""usual"" rogue of regular guest star villains: The Riddler, the Joker, the Penguin, and Catwoman. Riddler appears in four two-part episodes, Penguin in three two-part episodes, Joker in three two-part episodes, and Catwoman in one two-part episode. There are six non-regular guest-villains in Season 1: Mister Freeze, Zelda the Great, The Mad Hatter, False Face, King Tut, and The Bookworm. Zelda, False Face, and the Bookworm make their only appearances in the first season, while Mister Freeze and Mad Hatter also appear in Season 2. King Tut appears in all three seasons.

As another reviewer stated, Batman's first season hadn't yet been taken over by the special guest star villains.

In Season One all of the episodes are in two parts: Part one introduces the guest villain, and ends with Batman and Robin in a cliff-hanger predicament; part two has Batman and Robin escaping their predicament, and, with the exception of the Zelda episodes, near the end, physically battling the villains (to some rocking music, and punch ""POW"" graphics), eventually bringing them to justice. Well, being gentlemen, neither Batman nor Robin would ever think of hitting a villain-ness...

There is a flyer included in this collection that lists all of the 34 episodes in the order they first appeared, the dates they were originally shown (one of which was first broadcast on my sixth birthday!), and a synopsis of the story (which I may, or may not give). The episodes on Batman: Season 1 are as follows:

1-2: HI DIDDLE DIDDLE/SMACK IN THE MIDDLE. The pilot episode and concluding part, featuring Frank Gorshin as the Riddler. It introduces the regular non-villainous characters Bruce Wayne/Batman, Dick Grayson/Robin, faithful Wayne butler Alfred Pennyworth, Police Commissioner Gordon, Police Chief O'Hara, and Dick Grayson's Aunt, Harriet Cooper. (I don't recall Chief O'Hara or Aunt Harriet ever being in the comics; perhaps they were ad-ins to just this show?) It also introduces some neat Bat-gadgets, and, of course, the neatest gadget of all, the Batmobile!  Part one is the only time there is any mention of the murders of Bruce Wayne 's parents, and it is done very poignantly by Adam West as Bruce Wayne. This is also the first of the three episodes where the villain hopes to unmask Batman and Robin. Ironically enough, in part one Riddler hopes to do so through the legal system! This is the first of three stories from season one where only Robin is placed in jeopardy.

3-4: FINE FEATHERED FINKS/THE PENGUIN'S A JINX. This features the villain Penguin, who is played by Burgess Meredith, whom was Sylvester Stallone's trainer in the first two Rocky movies, and part of the third Rocky movie. Part one of this episode is the first of the two stories that feature only Batman in jeopardy, and the first as his alter-ego Bruce Wayne.  In part two the reason for Batman's costume is disclosed. In the first Batman comic book, Bruce Wayne gives the explanation; in this episode, Commissioner Gordon explains.

5-6: THE JOKER IS WILD/BATMAN IS RILED. This features the villain Joker, who is played by Cesar Romero. Part one ends with the Joker threatening to unmask Batman and Robin. Part two begins with Batman and Robin getting out of that predicament through Batman's utility belt, and ends in similar fashion.

7-8: INSTANT FREEZE/RATS LIKE CHEESE. This features Mister Freeze, portrayed here by George Sanders (who was the best of the three at playing the frosty fellow. Two other actors played Mister Freeze in Season Two). Part one gives a brief synopsis of the causation of Mister Freeze's inability to live outside of frigid temperatures and it concludes with Batman and Robin being frozen. Part two begins with the dynamic dual being thawed out. Later on, Batman is involved in a hostage exchange that Robin exerts himself into to save his pal. We also learn yet another reason the Gotham City Police Department needs extra help, as O'Hara and company get lost trying to follow Robin's directions to Mister Freeze's hideout!

9-10: ZELDA THE GREAT/A DEATH WORSE THAN FATE. Zelda, played by Anne Baxter, is the first of the only two female villains in season one. Zelda is an escape artist who, in the conclusion of part one, holds Aunt Harriet hostage. Part two concludes with Zelda saving the lives of Batman and Robin after they escape an inescapable doom trap.

11-12: A RIDDLE A DAY KEEPS THE RIDDLER AWAY/WHEN THE RAT'S AWAY THE MICE WILL PLAY. This is the second two-part episode featuring the Riddler. In part one, the Riddler kidnaps a visiting King from a foreign country to lure Batman and Robin into a death-trap. Part two begins, as usual, with Batman and Robin escaping their doom, and ends with the dynamic dual outriddling Riddler. It is also when Bruce/Batman explains to Dick/Robin that Riddler gave himself away: Riddler reveals what his actual crime is when his stops giving riddles.

13-14: THE THIRTEENTH HAT/BATMAN STANDS PAT. The Mad Hatter, played by David Wayne, steals the jurors that convicted him, and in both parts seeks to uncowl Batman. He almost succeeds in Part one.

15-16: THE JOKER GOES TO SCHOOL/HE MEETS HIS MATCH, THE GRISLY GHOUL. The second two-part episode that features the Joker.
 Joker rigs high school vending machines, and lures a class mate of Dick Grayson's into a life of crime. Here we learn that Dick Grayson's first name is really Richard.

17-18: TRUE OR FALSE FACE/HOLY RAT RACE. Part one ends in Batman and Robin facing being run over by a train; part two concludes with the derailment of False Face's counterfeiting plans. The identity of the actor who played Face Face is not revealed in the opening credits of either part one or part two, but is revealed in the closing credits.

19-20: THE PURR-FECT CRIME/BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME. Catwoman's one and only appearance in the first season. At the end of part one, Batman faces being killed by a tiger; at the beginning of part two, Robin faces death from two tigers. Catwoman herself faces an uncertain end at the story's conclusion. But, CW resurfaces in the other two seasons. Julie Newmar was Catwoman for seasons one and two. I read that she had adopted two kittens just so she could learn from them how a cat behaved. Smart lady! To me, she will always be the best Catwoman.

21-22: THE PENGUIN GOES STRAIGHT/NOT YET HE AIN'T. The second appearance of Penguin. In part one, Penguin feigns being a good guy, and sullies Batman and Robin's reputations. In part two, Batman and Robin feign insanity, while Penguin steals the Batmobile (albeit temporarily).

23-24: THE RING OF WAX/GIVE 'EM THE AX. The third appearance of Riddler. Riddler waxes long with his riddles while trying to get a book about lost treasures. He gets the book in part one and attempts to dip Batman and Robin in hot wax. As usual, Batman and Robin escape death in part two, and in a museum basement Batman must fight the villain and his henchmen alone to save Robin and the valuable treasures. In part two it is revealed that Riddler hates liars.

25-26: THE JOKER TRUMPS AN ACE/BATMAN SETS THE PACE. The third appearance of the Joker. In part one Joker kidnaps a Maharajah, and traps Batman and Robin in a tower that he is filling with poison gas. In part two, Batman and Robin escape being gassed to death unmask a phony royal.

27-28. THE CURSE OF TUT/THE PHARAOH'S IN A RUT. King Tut, played by Victor Bueno, makes his first and only appearance in these two episodes. In part one, we learn that Tut was once a Yale professor who became Tut by a bad konk on the head. (Tut reverts back to being the Yale prof at the end of part two.) In part one, Bruce Wayne is in jeopardy; in part two it is Batman.

29-30: THE BOOKWORM TURNS/WHILE GOTHAM CITY BURNS. Bookworm, portrayaed By Roddy McDowall, makes his only appearance in this story. At the end of part one, Robin is tied to a bell clapper, with only a minute left before it rings. In part two, Bookworm attempts to scald Batman and Robin to death in a giant cook book, and steals the Batmobile, using its bat-beam to break into a library of rare books.

31-32: DEATH IN SLOW MOTION/THE RIDDLER'S FALSE NOTION. The fourth appearance of the Riddler. In part one, we see part of the range of Frank Gorshin's acting ability, as at the beginning of the story he mimic's silent screen star Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp. Part one's conclusion leaves Batman trying to maintain order at a spiked Lemonade party, while Robin's in the Riddler's clutches, about to be sawn in half. In part two, Batman has Robin use his teeth to keep from plunging to his death. This is the third time that Robin alone is held captive by a villain, and two of the three it has been the Riddler.

33-34: FINE FINNEY FIENDS. The last episode of the first season, and the third appearance of Penguin. In the story, the Wayne Butler Alfred is kidnapped and brainwashed to reveal secrets about a charity dinner. Part one ends with Batman and Robin trapped in a chamber that steals all the oxygen once all the balloons inside are popped. In part two, Batman and Robin escape the death chamber, and eventually foil Penguin's plans to abscond with the charity money.

It is now 'later""... Reiterating my previous comments, everyone who acted on the show, during the first season, at least, took their tasks seriously, even though the material may not have always warranted it.

I am impressed at what a good job Adam West does of differentiating the dual characters of Bruce Wayne and Batman in Season 1. At times Burt Ward's portrayals as Dick Grayson and Robin aren't as distinctive For instance, in ""The Joker Goes To School"" at one point Dick Grayson uses a ""Holy..."" expression that Robin would normally use. And Dick's mannerisms in that same episode seem more like Robin's.

The rest of the regular cast do an excellent job at their respective roles, although sometimes the police seem rather inept. I cannot imagine any others doing the parts of Gordon, O'Hara, Alfred, or Aunt Harriet.

I now have a better appreciation of the acting abilities of the guest villains. For some reason, a as child the Joker always scared me. Maybe that's why I don't like clowns very much. Riddler never scared me (although he probably should have!). And Julie Newmar will always be Catwoman to me!

Now, my conclusion:

Some shows lose their attraction over time as people grow up. The first season of Batman isn't one of those shows. It's just good fun. Lots of silliness, with some sprinklings of seriousness thrown in. I haven't decided yet if I will get the other seasons. Guess I'll turn that Bat-dial when I come to it.",1424390400,5,11361,4.757621951219512

6556967,5,B00M4BCFH4,"Batman: Season 1 is a very different animal from the 2 seasons that followed it. With the highest budget of all 3 seasons, Batman: Season 1 also had the very best writing, attention to detail, stylish cinematography, moody lighting in some episodes, minimal camp, and flat out sense of danger that is downright chilling in some episodes. Who can forget in particular Frank Gorshin as the Riddler in the episode ""A Riddle a Day Keeps The Riddler Away?"" The Riddler's blood curdling laugh near the cliffhanger as Batman and Robin are spinning to death strapped to those wheels is unsettling to say the least. This episode in particular gives the strongest indication yet that you as the viewer, have stumbled upon an alternate credible reality of comic book mahem come to life where Batman and Robin are up against arch villains (the Riddler in particular) who are all truly insane. Multiple bravos to this episode as well for its dark lighting and spooky cinematography sometimes with the face of the unhinged Riddler filling the television screen. Of course, special praise to the late Frank Gorshin as well for his truly disturbing and unsettling performance as a mad man in this episode. He really threw himself into this episode in particular and just gave it everything he had as a professional actor. Bravo!!

The ""Purr-fect Crime"" had its chilling moments as well. In this first appearance of the Catwoman (Julie Newmar), we the viewers sense that Catwoman has a beginning attraction to Batman, yet she would sick a dangerous tiger on Batman at a moment's notice, mine a dirt road with explosives, and have spiked walls close in on the Dynamic Duo. The spikes ultimately were made out of rubber, but still. This episode is also neat in that we see the Batmobile is definitely a nuclear powered vehicle, requiring a repowering of some sort with Alfred and Robin doing the chore. This changed in seasons two and three in that references were made to the Batmobile needing a quart of oil and regular fuel.

My third favorite episode in this first season is the Bookworm episode with Roddy McDowell. The late Roddy McDowell deserves special mention for his performance in this episode as well. He suddenly starts yelling and going off his rocker here and there in this episode, and I also like how he slowly and methodically adjusts the light on his hat.

Season 1 of Batman in particular leans in the direction of the manic danger of the Tim Burton Batman films in some instances. The cast and crew went to great lengths in this inaugural season to ground Batman and Robin in a credible and insane alternate reality more nightmarish than the mid 1960s Batman comic books of the time. Yes, Batman runs around in broad daylight in this version of the superhero, but despite that this first season has just the right amount of straight drama, moody atmospherics, traces of camp here and there, unsettling danger, and Batman and Robin really thinking their way through the problems these insane villains create for them. You get the impression that no matter how insane these villains are, Batman and Robin are accustomed to dealing with them, and know how to deal with them without letting the insanity get to them.

6557001,5,B00M4BCFH4,"The best of the three seasons of the Batman television series (1966-1968) was the first HALF season in early 1966.  This was when the show was at its best in terms of having a delicate balance of memorable characters, stories, good scripts, quality sets, suspense, seriousness, darkness, humor, camp, and overall quality in general.  The first half season of early 1966 was when the camp element was there, but didn't go overboard.  It had the highest budget as well.  Beginning with the second season (which was still good), which ran from late 1966 to early 1967, the scripts started getting ridiculous and the show got more and more campy as time went on.  Overall quality was starting to go downhill as well.  It was also when guest stars started taking over with their window cameos and guest villains were numerous.  Don't get me wrong, it was still a good season and very entertaining, but it wasn't quite the same as the first half season.  The third season (late 1967 to early 1968) was when the episodes just got way too campy and ridiculous (though I do like Batgirl).  I still like this camp element I'm describing, but there's a noticeable night and day difference between Season 1 and Season 3.

So, if you don't want to purchase the entire series, but want the best of the three seasons, then Batman: Season 1 is the DVD set to get.  I feel it is the best overall batch of episodes in the entire series.  It was when the show was in its infancy and struck that delicate balance I mention above.  The set contains 5 DVDs for a total of 34 episodes.  The picture and sound quality are both excellent.  Much better than watching re-runs playing on cable TV.  There are no extras on this set, but if you just want the episodes and nothing more, then this set will deliver.  If you already own Batman: The Movie (1966) and Holy Batmania! like I do, then you know that both of those contain excellent extras and documentaries.  The documentaries/extras on those two DVDs might make you feel that it's unnecessary to acquire the extras and documentaries that are part of the newly released complete three season, 120 episode Batman television series DVD sets (DVD or Blu Ray).  At least that's how I feel, anyway.  I'm satisfied with what I already own.  On the other hand, YOU might want to acquire the new extras/documentaries on the 120 episode set.  But again, if you just want the episodes and no extras, then Batman: Season 1 is the set to get.",1417392000,52,2458,4.589449541284404

I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!!!
I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!!!",1416441600,,198,5.1875
6557004,5,B00M4BCFH4,"The wait is finally over true believers!  It is hard to imagine this truly unique
and original series is just now!!! making it to home video thanks to the brain
trust at Warners (who owns the characters) and Fox (who owns the series),
plus a lot of red tape.  The good news is the series looks as vibrant as it did
when it premiered in the fall of 1966 at the height of the pop art craze in all
its four color splendor. The audio is crisp and bold as the living comic book
images that literally pop out at you.  Season one came out of the gate and
vanquished the competition flat.  The scripts, sets, score, production values
coupled with an ensemble cast supported by an all-star line up of seasoned
pros portraying Batman's rogue gallery make this set top notch escapism
for all ages.

The pilot episode alone stands out in broadcasting with the great, Frank
Gorshin, portraying the Riddler setting the tone for all actors to follow.
Cesar Romero, Julie Newmar (YOOWZAA!), Burgess Meredith, George
Sanders, Roddy McDowall, David Wayne, Victor Buono, Malachi Throne,
and Anne Baxter are all on deck to challenge the caped crusaders.
Subsequent seasons were pale limp shadows of the initial season as the
producers failed to maintain that difficult balance between comedy and
suspense.  To those ""serious Batman fans"" who feel the show is a mockery
of the character.  Take a deep breath (get a life) and try to appreciate this
highly innovative interpretation of iconic American mythology.",1416268800,4,1489,4.79296875
6557005,5,B00M4BCFH4,"If $135, is too much for you right now, don't worry. There is this $30. option. Most of the best episodes were in the first season anyway. This was Adam West's favorite season. He thought Season 2 was ok. And he didn't think much of Season 3,

Season 1 was where the show was at its best. It had a great mixture of comedy, darkness, and suspense. Later on, the scripts went downhill. Most of the dark and serious elements disappeared, and the show fell into an overly campy style. By Adam West's confession. S3 episode 'Surfs Up, Joker Under:' ""crossed the line between parody and stupidity."" He also described Season 3 as a 'generally unhappy time in my life.' Furthermore, he said 'Enter Batgirl, Exit Penguin' was: ""The show that introduced Batgirl, and the start of a season I didn't much enjoy.'

But Season 1 was a real powerhouse. You get Adam West's favorite episode 'Hi Diddle Riddle.' The Penguin is introduced in the suspenseful 'Fine Feathered Finks.' 'The Joker Is Wild' is a terror filled episode. 'Instant Freeze' is Adam West's 2nd favorite episode. 'Zelda the Great' was an episode that with all the darkness and suspense, revolved around the theme of a villain having a change of heart. 'A Riddle a Day Keeps the Riddler Away' explores kidnapping for political reasons. 'The 13th Hat' explores revenge and is filled with darkness, horror, and suspense.

'The Joker Goes to School' was ok, but a step down  from the terror filled 'The Joker Is Wild.' 'True Or FalseFace' was a dark episode revolving around the problem that you can't be sure anything is real. 'The Purr-Fect Crime' was full of chilling darkness and suspense. Catwoman was at her best before she sunk into her romantic feelings for Batman. (Julie Newmar actually preferred it that way.)

'Penguin Goes Straight' is an interesting episode that revolves around deception. 'Ring of Wax' is an unusually dark episode that revolves around the Riddler and has an almost Halloween feeling to it. 'The Joker Trumps an Ace' isn't exactly 'The Joker Is Wild.' But it does have a mysterious suspense that comes together well with a twist ending.

'The Cure of Tut' introduces poor King Tut. (The villain who is the most sympathetic in that he does what he does because he was hit on the head.) 'The BookWorm Turns' has an especially creepy and sinister Roddy McDowall. (Though on a side note, Mr. McDowall will always be Tolkien's Samwise to me.)

'Death In Slow Motion' was a good Riddler episode that involved deception, creepy suspense, and comedy. 'Fine Finny Fiends' had a great scenario. Afred was kidnapped and brainwashed by the Penguin, and then returned home. (Obviously to get information on Bruce Wayne's affairs.)

Obviously, if you want the whole saga right away. $135. may not sound like much. But if things are tight, don't worry. $30. will get you the best season.",1416268800,25,2853,4.808163265306122
6557006,5,B00M4BCFH4,"Ugodly good picture. Like watching the series over again for the first time. The colors are sharp and vivid. The Batmobile gleams like you just waxed it. Penguin's purple hat sticks out and POW hits you in the face. Fire, coming from a furnace, looks so real it looks like your room is on fire. You already know how good the show is and now, on DVD, you know just how crisp and clear the picture truly is. Run and get this. There is no excuse!

6557007,5,B00M4BCFH4,"Lots of people look at this show and think it is either just campy fun for kids or an insult to the dark gritty version Batman that they love. I would like to suggest that Batman's role in our culture has always been to make us question authority, the invisible structures that govern our lives. Batman shows us that the rules most of us live by don't work and urges you, by example, to make your own. If you are willing to accept this premise, this show is Batman in as pure a form as any out there. The more seriously the actors  in this show play their roles, the more earnest they are, the more ridiculous the social structures of the 50s and 60s appear to be. Some have said that this is the last ""square"" representation of a super hero before the more serious interpretations in the 70s and 80s, but I would like to suggest that this version of Batman is just as subversive as any out there. Brilliant satire. Great fun.",1415836800,6,926,4.291428571428572
6557008,5,B00M4BCFH4,"I just got this on a whim, and I must say that I'm glad I did. The picture quality is very good, and it is fun to relive the past with this show. The set comes with an episode guide too, which I've never seen with a Warner's release of an old show. It also has SDH in 4 languages. Don't really understand the only other audio language option to be Portuguese, but I'm sure there is a reason. There is a coupon included for $10 off the complete series, and at the price of the second season this is probably the way to go. Enjoy!",1415750400,6,528,3.990566037735849
8670235,5,B00M4BCFH4,"I guess I may be one of the few who can say they saw it in its first run when I was about 14 years old,and now I have seen it for the first time since then ,on DVD all these years later.
When I first saw it, I saw them all in black and white. Colour sets were expensive,and the very few colour ones I saw in my neigbourhood at that time, had terrible colours,as they all seemed to have a green hue over everything,not like the clarity we enjoy as a given today. So you can imagine my amazement when I stick the first disc into the player and out comes a product I originally saw in B&W and grainy(we had TV antenna's not cable) to this,so clear and crisp it looks like it was filmed just yesterday. There is a bit of graininess of course,to be expected considering its age,but holy DVD Batman,what a pleasant surprise.
Now,along with seeing it as a young teenager,I could get the humour and double entendre's, but basically I was viewing it more or less as a serious series. It has so many layers to it,and those layers/levels I NOW enjoy as an an adult. The humour weaves through everything, along with a ton of life lessons(tongue in cheek,of course) ,and some ultra smart dialogue,along with those double entendre's I mentioned earlier. It's a veritable smorgasbord of tastes for everyone's palate,no matter how old you may be. As I said I got the light heartedness of it all,yet seriousness when I was young,but now it all comes together. I can see it now in its entirety,and I must say it is delightful. Some say camp,I say smart...period. And one has to look at Adam West's titular role as close to flawless in execution. I cannot imagine anyone else in the role. His phrasing of a line,with frequent hesitations(reminding me of William Shatner on Star Trek) is delightful. And Burt Ward as his faithful sidekick, always coming out with the line""Holy...""something or rather,which more often than not were funnier than all get out,considering the circumstances of the moment.
And who can forget those wall climbs with celebrity guests popping out of a window?Jerry Lewis was the first. And they went on to have many high profile stars do this. If this was not the hit it was,as many claim,what could have attracted them to appear at all? Rowan and Martin's Laugh In went on to have many a star and cast member pop out of windows/walls during their shows,and I have often wondered whether Batman was the influence.
Then we have the stalwart cast members:Alan Napier as Alfred the butler,Neil Hamilton as Commissioner Gordon,Stafford Repp as Chief O'Hara(""begorah""), and Madge Blake as Aunt Harriet. Veterans all,these guys,like the two leads,played all their parts straight down the line,which is what all good comedy is supposed to do. That is one of the most important and appealing aspects of the show, as comedy,good comedy, is indeed a serious business.
Last but not least are the villains,and what an absolute wonderful cadre of criminals these folks were. Comedian Frank Gorshin who just chewed the scenery up with his portrayal;Burgess Meredith who also went a long way in almost upstaging the dynamic duo;one of my absolute faves Victor Buono as King Tut,what an actor;who can forget Caesar Romero as the Joker,and that painted over mustache of his?,and Julie Newmar makes her first appearance as Catwoman,who brought sexiness to the show in spades. Other foils for the caped crusaders were less than inspiring,folks like David Wayne as The Mad Hatter,Roddy McDowell as the Bookworm,Malachi Throne as False Face,Anne Baxter as Zelda the Great and George Sanders as Mr. Freeze. I left Mr Freeze until last because they switched him up three times which pee'od me to no end. As they would later do with the Riddler(twice), but that's for another season.
All in all what a delightful blast from the past and in glorious living colour,beautifully remastered after TOO long a wait. I think many folks today won't get it,like we did  having grown up with it,because there are many jokes and many of the on screen personalities that have long past and would be unknown to generations now. The show was of its time,but at the same time well ahead of it. I enjoyed it immensely(in the past and now) and look forward to future seasons. To the bat cave.",1522713600,,4255,4.72678331090175
