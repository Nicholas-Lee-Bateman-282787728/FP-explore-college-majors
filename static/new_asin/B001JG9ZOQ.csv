3657880,5,B001JG9ZOQ,"I have practiced Tai Chi for 15 years for health.  Everyday at sunrise I do a Yang Style long form called Chang style.  In the beginning of my journey I read 100s of books on Tai Chi principles, Chi  Gung, and Tao.  These works can be valuable if one is seeking  the essence and a distillate of Tai Chi.  But, there are plenty of bad translations and the works can be plain esoteric and inscrutable.  That's why the Chinese say 1 picture is worth a thousand words.  I like that this video shows the evolution of all the main forms.  Yang style is shown in a park in  Beijing.  Chen style is shown in Chen village with 2 masters of Chen lineage.  Wudang style is shown in Wudang Mountain  and is hard core and mystical.  The film is beautiful and thorough.  The masters are top notch and you get to see all major forms of Tai Chi illustrated by reputable masters.  You can see the Chi flow.  The DVD is a valuable supplement to the endless supply of books and magazines I have read, and it adds a visual dimension without an endless stream of words.  I have watched it once and it has improved my practice.  I plan to watch it again.  There are many people who claim to teach Tai chi out there--  but what they  are teaching is questionable.  This is a good video to see what the authentic lineages look like in pursuit of a master and form.",1285891200,10,1340,4.23015873015873
3657881,4,B001JG9ZOQ,"The movie starts with some fragmentary demonstrations that appears to be from the Beijing Olympics opening ceremonies. Boring.

There is then a very brief interview with a Yang style master and a short look at some of his classes. So-So. We see fragments of the 24 form.

Then they have a long look at several Chen style masters including several detailed form demonstrations and a discussion of Chen style. This includes the relationship between the hard and soft Chen forms. Very interesting.

The documentary concludes with a long look at the Wudang Mountains martial arts. Again very interesting. There are discussions of the relationships between the hard and soft forms and talks about the relationship of Taoism and martial arts in the Wudang styles. Curiously there are several form demonstrations that look a lot like the Bagua circle walking exercises.",1271721600,14,862,5.142857142857143

It's not a how-to-do DVD but rather a documentary on this ancient martial art form. It's shot in HD with an inspiring sound track.

I've been training in the martial arts since 1965, which includes tai chi study. I highly recommend this high quality, well produced DVD.",1254700800,26,346,4.476190476190476

This film is NOT a learning method, but a kind of spiritual and cultural travel between different frames and minds of internals martials arts.
DVD ok for all zones. Few images problems on HD screens, but nothing really important.

Now, I would like to discover others movies from Empty minds films.",1252627200,17,434,4.786666666666667
8312896,4,B001JG9ZOQ,"I have always wanted to see the Home of Tai Chi in Wudang and was once invited to go there but declined. I don't think I could have tackled all those steps up that mountain.
This is another excellent Braeley disc of various Tai Chi Forms. I met the Master Chen Xioa WAng here in New Zealand many years ago and he has changed very little. That time he demonstrated his skill of chi projection and knocked down 6 students one after the other with a light touch to the chest. These secrets are still not revealed to the public in general and I am pleased they are still secret and treasured as surely once in the hands of the West they will be commercialized and corrupted. Nothing flashy in these discs but plain and simple as they should be.

I practice Shaolin Five Ancestors system and have also been interested in Taoist martial art systems such as those practised in Wu Dang Mountain.

This documentary was informative and very interesting and inspired me to take up some Wu Dang kung fu taichi training.

I'd love to see more such dvds in the market!!!",1323302400,6,526,4.954545454545454

Review by John Loupos

Written and directed by Jon Braeley, this DVD opens with scenes of martial splendor, depicting masses of Tai Chi and Kung Fu performers, including a brief cameo by Jet Li.

Once it begins in earnest the DVD is comprised of several `chapters', each one focusing on a different Tai Chi master or tradition. Throughout the DVD informational voiceovers are helpfully spliced in with interviews.

The first section takes viewers to Beijing and interviews with Master Cui Zhangsan, whose Tai Chi family has taught Yang style in the same park for more than 100 years. Viewers are informed that Master Cui Zhangsan's grandfather was the first student of Yang Chengfu. Despite the historical interest of this chapter, I have to admit that I was not especially enamored with this teacher. According to Cui Zhangsan, Yang style Tai Chi's ""most obvious feature is its stretching,"" with an emphasis on big steps and hand positions that are open and suited for grabbing one's opponent. I wondered if maybe something was lost in the translation, until his many students-at-practice evidenced these training priorities. Certainly, these features may be more or less important during one's training, but they hardly seem to me to encapsulate the essence of Yang style Tai Chi. Especially in comparison with the teacher interviews that followed, this first segment was not outstanding. I give this section ** 1/2.

The next section brings viewers to Chen Village where we meet Chen Xiaowang, the current standard bearer of Chen style Tai Chi. Master Chen looks very impressive as he performs his Tai Chi alongside the Yellow River. Engaging interviews and historical background on Master Chen's early studies as a youngster under the tutelage of his father' and other relatives follow. No doubt these tidbits are as real pearls for Chen style enthusiasts. I give this section ***.

Section three stays focused on the Chen style, but turns its attention to Xiaowang's brother, Chen Xiaoxing, who oversees the family school in Chen Village. Chen Xiaoxing is immediately a warm and soft spoken man who exudes Tai Chi. The footage of his Tai Chi performance was inspiring and, by my estimation, nearly flawless. The interview with Chen Xiaoxing cast additional fascinating insights into the history and development of the various Chen form routines. ****.

Viewers are next transported to Wudang mountain, which we are informed is actually 72 separate peaks. Here we meet both Masters and devoted students. Grandmaster Zhong Yun Long of the main (Purple Cloud) temple is another deliberate but soft spoken steward of a great tradition. Master Long's Tai Chi performance was exquisite. He and Master Chen Xiangwen offer compelling perspectives and information on the more esoteric aspects of Tai Chi and Taoism. The student interviews contribute to the overall flavor*****.

The DVD also contains some less engaging footage of a `Tai Chi for tourists' school and a field trip to a local sword shop.

All things considered this is a well made DVD with quite a good bit of fascinating information. There's not much here that will help you improve your Tai Chi from a technical standpoint (it's not intended as a teaching DVD), but many serious students will find the historical and theoretical information useful and inspiring nonetheless.",1316995200,13,3395,5.113718411552346
8312905,5,B001JG9ZOQ,"I bought this documental because I am a lover and practitioner of taichi for 15 years, the views, the styles and the masters are wonderful. Well done and nice to enjoy. Also having Jet Li  in this dvd is inspiring.",1299369600,2,214,4.35
