8325313,5,6303364632,"This is a great family movie. Is shows the struggle of two boys. You will laugh cry and root for them. But is has good morals learning . I think in this day and age we shoulld all have a movie like this one in our collections. Young and old alike will walk away with a better idea of what griendship across racial bounds can create a better understanding of each other and how if we just stop our judgement of other up color,race,or beliefs we could all get along better in this world",1233964800,2,484,4.159574468085107
8325314,5,6303364632,"I immediately fell in love with the movie Warrior Spirit.  This story was so compelling and moving that I wished it never end.  It tells the story of two young boys who face an incredible adventure and they form a friendship that stands the test of time. Revenge,betrayal, and greed take a part whent the two must face hard challanges and descions on their journey to seek a mysterious legend.  I really fell in love with the actor Allan Musy and would love to be able to meet him in person.  The ending was great but left me feeling a little sad.  I wished it would have ended differently and those who see this movie will see why.  Maybe its because I never wanted it to end.  I just couldn't get enough of Allan Musy.",1073692800,20,720,4.288888888888889
8325315,4,6303364632,"It follows the story of two young men who meet in school, a poor white boy and an young indian who is ridiculed by the other white students. They form a friendship and later have an adventure, searching for gold. The film deals with greed, as well as honor, and compassion.
I agree with the above reviews, its hard to seperate love for this movie with love for the ultra-fine Allan Musy, and the character of Wabigon. Also stars loveable Lucas Haas.
Whatever happened to Allan Musy?!! Unfortunately, he dissappeared after this movie:(",1062806400,13,534,4.752688172043011
