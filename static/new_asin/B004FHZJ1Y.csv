8427843,1,B004FHZJ1Y,"The 4 male leads are all fairly attractive. That is the one star. Senseless, directionless and pointless. I can't remember ever having seen 4 more vapid creatures. The story is just so bad 4 men having a pool party and discussing the most inane things. The talks are not even interesting. Characters pop in and out for no apparent reason, Virgil's mother, next door neighbor, David's sister and nephew, an old man living down the street brings peaches???? This movie needs to just go away. Now for the ""actors"" God awful! Not even any promise from anyone...all horrible, notably, Virgils mother, the neighbor, the shrew of a sister (who is she related to? really awful) and of the 4 main characters....go back to waiting tables is Weho. My conscious is clear...stay away!",1394496000,,771,4.848484848484849
