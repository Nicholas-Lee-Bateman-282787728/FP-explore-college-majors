6111838,5,B00GTF526M,I wanted to watch this as I get ready to see Lone Survivor when it comes out in the next few days. I think this was a good documentary about who Murph was and what kind of man it takes to do that kind of job. The family must be so proud of him but I can truly feel the heartbreak also. Very touching moments in the film too which I think everyone should experience through watching this. It really focuses on the family and friends that made up his environment. I can't say more.,1389052800,4,479,4.052631578947368
6111839,5,B00GTF526M,"Michael Murphy serves as an example of what we should all aspire to be in our own lives.  Michael put others first in everything he did and he truly understood what it meant to be a team player, a leader, a protector, a soldier, a friend, and a son.",1389052800,25,249,4.081632653061225
6111840,4,B00GTF526M,"""Murph: The Protector"" (2013 release; 85 min.) retells the story of Michael Murphy, a Navy Seal who was killed in Afghanistan in 2005 and who received the Medal of Honor in 2007 posthumously for the service he gave to our country. First, let me be clear that I have nothing but the highest admiration and respect for what Murph did and he fully deserved the Medal of Honor, a true American hero.

That said, as a movie, this is a mediocre documentary at best, I am sorry to say. Several things: the documentary consists for the vast majority of interviews with his immediate family members (parents, brother, etc.), and the lack of any sizable archive footage really surprised/disappointed me. Second, the documentary is skimpy on too many details (example: the fight with the Taliban where Murph lost his life is dealt with in mere minutes, without the slightest critical look back or analysis; also: in the middle of the movie we learn out of nowhere that Murph got engaged at some point to ""the love of his life"", whom had never been mentioned before and on top of that is never interviewed for the movie; and so on). I am sure that this documentary will be uplifting for Murph's family and friends as this movie is a fitting tribute to Murph, but as a ""neutral"" movie watcher, this documentary fell short for me. As a complete aside, there is a very nice soundtrack to this documentary, scored primarily by Jeff Widenhofer and Chris Irwin who operate under the Madjac Music name. Be sure to check that out.

This movie showed up unannounced and without any pre-release hype or advertizing on one theater screen for all of Greater Cincinnati earlier this year (I believe it was in March, I am really surprised how long it has taken to be finally released on DVD), and the screening I saw this at was sparsely attended. As a result, not surprisingly it played here only two weeks before disappearing. That said, even though it is not the strongest of documentaries, I think this is still worth checking out on DVD, in particular if you have a high interest in our military.

*UPDATE* (January '14) A movie called ""Lone Survivor"", giving the account of Operation Red Wings (in which Murphy lost his life) is now in the theater, and in every which way a much better tribute to Murphy than this documentary. Check it out.",1386028800,,2320,4.6536585365853655

You know who the dirtball Michael Brown is but not Michael Murphy and people just look at me weird.  Michael Brown was the crook,high on Dope fool that roughed up a convenience store clerk and then tried to beat up a Police Office in the town of Ferguson.  While CNN & MSNBC folks like Don Lemon, Sharpton, Rangel may appreciate these morons I appreciate and respect guys like Michael Murphy (A True Hero).  So please watch this and then tell people about it, we should also make mini documentaries about our everyday hero's (Police,Fire, Coast Guard, FBI, CIA, Border Patrol, and other services).

6111888,5,B00GTF526M,"This movie isn't about the war, or about Operation Red Wings, instead it is about a man whose selflessness and sacrifice is the stuff legends are made of. Lt Michael Murphy's story is told by his family and friends, from his childhood through his time in the SEALs. It wasn't clear at times who some of the people narrating this story were or how they fit into the film but I felt that by the end all of it was made clear. I also wish that we were able to hear from his fiance and from his teammate Marcus Luttrel during the documentary but it may have just been too painful for them to talk about. Other than those two critiques I can't say that there is anything more you could ask for from this film. Lt Michael Murphy is a hero and someone to be looked up to and I will most certainly be purchasing a copy of this film to share with family and hopefully someday when I have kids or grandkids of my own to share with them to share with them someone who I saw as a hero and an inspiration as a young man. MURPH: THE PROTECTOR is one hundred percent the movie to watch if you aren't afraid to have yours eyes wet with tears of sadness for his family and also tears of pride for our country and our servicemen and women.

6111903,5,B00GTF526M,"I've been aware of LT. Michael Murphy well before watching this documentary.  I've known of him and his selfless act that posthumously won him the Medal Of Honor before the movie Lone Survivor.  I read Marcus Luttrells book back around 2010 after it was recommended to me by a co-worker.  I'm very glad I did as it has truly changed my life for the better.  I have a sense of pride as an American and as a member of the military that has been perpetuated to great heights because of the 4 man SEAL element that ultimately faced their death (aside from Marcus) but would go on to become the most highly decorated SEAL unit in history.  While every SEAL and member of Special Forces is innately unique and worthy of their own praise, Murphy is the one who sticks out the most.  He's just a cut above the rest.  In the Lone Survivor book, Marcus references that Murphy was his best friend.  He even goes on to add in later interviews/speeches that he loved him.  He said he never told Murphy that but he was so close with him that he practically considered him a brother.  It's also worth noting that while he does a brief introduction to each of his teammates they are indeed very quick.  So, needless to say, if you're looking to get to know who these guys were, the book only sheds the faintest bit of light on what was otherwise very remarkable individuals.  I personally wanted to learn much more about Murphy so Murph: The Protector was a perfect avenue to take in order to do so.  Marcus is thanked in the credits for sharing Michael's story.  That story I'm imagining must be of Operation Red Wings as he is otherwise non-existent from the video.  While I do not know exactly why, I'm willing to take an educated guess and assume it's one of two things.  Either he did not want his celebrity/icon status to shadow or even merely take away from Murph or he simply could not or did not want to be part of it.  I'm actually very confident that its a mixture of both.  He knew it would be too difficult for him.  After watching this video, I'm here to tell you that for the better part of 45 minutes, it was hard to finish this.  It hit me right in the heart.  While anybody who is looking to find out or learn more about the mission that ended up taking his and so many other lives will be disappointed to know there is very little in the way of new information in that regard.  This is about Michael and his life leading up to his death and the events that transpired after.  This one hour 16 minute movie is well worth your time for a man who is worthy of his Medal Of Honor.  Rest in peace, LT.",1447286400,4,2599,4.278688524590164

Not knowing or even being interested in war movies in general,something inside said watch this. I like Marc Wahlberg so I was a little curious. The movie was already in progress so I really had no Idea what was going on. I watched on as four soldiers were in the fight of their lives. As I continued watching I realized there was something special about the movie but didn't know why at that point. I was captivated how they cared about each other and went to any extreme to work together as a Team. Then at some point I realized they were part of an elite team,a seals team. Wont give anything away about either film only to give  my highest suggestion for to you watch both of these films. I am in Ah when I see or hear a story of this magnitude,because it gives me hope that there are people of this caliber in the world we live in today. Real stories like this are so hard to come by or hear about because of all the other distractions thrown our way. This is a true and real story about a incredible person who served his country,but lived his life serving others.

6112179,4,B00GTF526M,"Murph was just another extraordinary guy, who stepped forward because he wanted to defend his family and nation. He made the biggest sacrifice for his brothers-in-arms and in his own way defined the courage. He's another honorable hero--one of the greatest--and he hasn't been praised until now. The new short documentary film, created by Scott Mactavish, brings this inspiring story to everyone.

In the world of documentary film, there are just as many bad ones as good ones. Thankfully, Murph's story is the second option. It's an emotionally strong narration, paved by dialogues with his family and friends. Yeah, that's all, just dialogue and family photos! But it's enough. When you hear about this smart guy, who could have been a lawyer and instead, he chose to become a Navy SEAL. Scott Mactavish literally forces you to think about this extraordinary brotherhood, and through questions he composes a moving picture of one America's hero, and his brotherhood. The simple narrative style doesn't interfere with message, on the contrary, it highlights it!

However, this perfection is still marred by Mactavish's unconvincing use of the camera, and editing. I can't help myself, but there is much more potential here in terms of post-processing and exploring various camera compositions. Especially if you have seen this director's previous movies. But that's really the only problem with this thrilling portrayal. This story is so strong, that it carries the whole piece without any hesitation. And is backed with a little help from the solid music. The soundtrack is largely unimpressive, almost ambient, and that's really good! The focus on the message about unsung heroes, and particularly Murph, without any digression from the topic, is the most valuable quality of this movie.

The Navy SEAL motto is: The Only Easy Day Was Yesterday. And Murph: The Protector is the best example of this quote! Maybe it isn't the best documentary film I've ever seen, but it's definitely worth a look. At least in remembrance of Lt. Michael P. ""Murph"" Murphy.",1394755200,,2057,5.152694610778443

6112184,4,B00GTF526M,"For some reason people in the US tend to steer clear of documentaries. I think in part that has a lot to do with the one sided take most US documentary film makers have chosen, that of an involved participant with an axe to grind as opposed to a non-involved film maker attempting to capture the reality of the moment. True, no matter how hard you try to stay objective, your values and beliefs will come through. But it seems like most documentary film makers today take pride in displaying their beliefs before you even have a chance to watch their movie and most often these days that involves slamming someone, manipulating facts to your previously held conclusions or just plain using tabloid techniques to twist the story to fit your goal (can you say Michael Moore?). That being said I am sure that there was an opinion formed by the makers of MURPH: THE PROTECTOR. Fortunately that opinion was one of praise as opposed to how much dirt could be dug up.

Michael P. Murphy was your typical American boy for so many years with the exception that while some chose to pick on the little guy he always seemed to end up the defender. Told with a combination of family photos and interviews with family and friends, we get a glimpse into the formative years of this young man. Some may already know what he achieved but for others this is the beginnings of a story so many have come to be a part of in their own way, with their own families.

As he grew Murphy went on to accomplish many things. He was a comfort to his brother, a great son to both of his parents and he eventually went on to be an outstanding college student who was easy going and made plenty of friends. And then, after graduation, he made a decision to join the Navy. Not only that, he wanted to become a SEAL, the best of the best. As with all of the plans he made, he accomplished his goal. It was in his career as a SEAL that his name was brought to the attention of the world down the line.

As part of Operation Red Wing, a counter insurgent group in Afghanistan, in June of 2005, Murphy and 2 other members of his four man squad were killed in action. The fourth member of the squad, Marcus Luttrel, barely made it out alive but was the only survivor of the battle between this squad and insurgents there. If the name Luttrel sounds familiar it's because he went on to write a book about those events which became the basis for the hit film LONE SURVIVOR. By surviving and writing the book Luttrel has received attention, but Murphy is never far from his mind or from those who knew him and share those memories in this film.

Near the end of the film we are privy to the memories of his mother talking about meeting then President George W. Bush as Murphy was posthumously presented with the Medal of Honor. It's a touching story that shows not only the feelings of this mother who lost her son but gives us a glimpse of the man who Bush was behind the scenes, a man who felt her pain and shared it with her to the extent that was possible.

There are no action sequences in this film. It is almost all straight on head shots in interviews intermingled with the family photos I mentioned earlier. There are some filmed portions with Murphy on screen but they are rare. The best part of the film though isn't the way it was put together but in learning about the life of this young man who gave his life for his country. In a world where we make heroes out of million dollar earning movie stars and sports figures perhaps we need to see more about true heroes who deserve to be called just that. When this movie is finished you might think differently about what a hero truly is. Michael P. Murphy fit those criteria completely. So do the makers of this film for bringing his story to us. My guess is you won't see them honored by Hollywood but that shouldn't be a surprise.",1393372800,,3852,4.3370319001386965
6112185,5,B00GTF526M,"I rented this film via Amazon and was not disappointed.  This is one of those rare films about war that you SHOULD watch with your young teens/young adult children.  Michael Murphy shows us all how to be courageous.  The film will remind us of all the lessons that every teacher, every parent, every mentor ever tried to deliver to us.  The difference was that Michael Murphy was a willing and able student of those lessons.  He took them to heart and they meant something to him.  This movie will help you understand the commitment, dedication and compassion it takes to be a member of our military and more importantly, a member of one of the most elite military teams in the world.

6112198,5,B00GTF526M,"Lt. Michael P. Murphy's life is depicted in this documentary.  For those who do not know who he was, Mikey, as he was known to his SEAL brothers, was the leader of a small group of Navy SEALs that was sent into the Hindu Kush Mountains of Afghanistan to seek out the location of a Taliban leader.  The group's mission was compromised, and all but one of the SEAL team was killed in action.  The lone survivor was Marcus Luttrell, the author of a book of that name.  The story of June 28, 2005 and Marcus's rescue are depicted in the heart wrenching movie Lone Survivor.  Murph: The Protector is more about his life and legacy than it about his military action.

6112225,1,B00GTF526M,"While the documentary's heart was in the right place, I didn't come away knowing much more about Lt. Murphy.  The Medal of Honor is the highest honor that can be earned and this movie didn't correlate with that.  There were virtually no significant details about Lt. Murphy here.  I came away not knowing anything more about Op. Redwing that I didn't already know from Marcus Luttrell's book.

Lt. Murphy earned the Medal of Honor, but why?  Isn't it relevant to describing a man who gave his life for this country?  I think so.  While we get an indication of why Lt. Murphy was willing to sacrifice, we come away not knowing specifically how he sacrificed.  I'm not talking about wanting to know morbid details, but a general overview of the mission that led to the nation's highest honor would be relevant.  I think the book, ""Lone Survivor"" honors Lt. Murphy more than this documentary ever could.

I would have given this 2 stars had they not thrown in the scenes of the winner of the Lt. Murphy Scholarship, because it took away from Lt. Murphy.  Yes, this scholarship was created in his name, but who was Lt. Murphy?  To me, a documentary titled, ""Murph: The Protector"" would seem to hint at a description of what made him a protector.  We see some of that with the details of his upbringing but that is a small part of the overall picture.

My rating of 1 star is solely based on this documentary and not of that of the service of Lt. Murphy.  I believe for a man that won the Medal of Honor and had a DDG, Arleigh-Burke class destroyer named after him, that a better service could have been done in outlining the deeds of this American Hero.  This documentary, while well-intentioned, lacks the follow through to give a complete picture of Lt. Murphy.

Do yourself a favor, save the money used to rent this and donate it in the name of his scholarship or buy Marcus Luttrell's book Lone Survivor.  Those two options would be doing a much greater service than watching this documentary.",1390348800,27,1993,4.566197183098591

6112228,5,B00GTF526M,"I am constantly fascinated with military stories that make headlines nowadays, especially those that involve our Special Ops forces.  More awe-inspiring still are the details that usually come out after the headlines have died down.  Take for example the mountainside battle that ensued on June 28, 2005.  The headlines proclaimed a battle had taken placebut when the details came forward, many Americans were surprised to find out a force of four SEALs had taken on an army of Taliban.  Three of the brave SEALs died, but one name in particular stood out for his actions that helped to save the fourth man.  Amidst a hailstorm of gunfire, Lieutenant Michael Murphy left cover and dashed to a clearing to place a call for backup.  This ultimately led to his death, but the legacy he left behind will never be forgotten.  MURPH THE PROTECTOR is an in-depth documentary that reveals a hero in the making, from his birth to his death.

I cant put into words just how much respect I have for our military and those who serve in it to keep our country safe.  Several friends of mine served, and I am proud to call them friends for doing so.  These men and women, those like Lt. Murphy, deserve acclaim and respect, even though they rarely receive the accolades that they should.

MURPH THE PROTECTOR is shot well and looks great.  The narrative is provided by Lt. Murphys family and friends as they discuss his childhood and how he grew up in New York.  Even at an early age, people could see he was destined for great things.  And hearing the stories of his childhood and upbringing as told by those closest to him really brings the man to life.

Lt. Murphy is one of the men portrayed in the new Mark Wahlberg film LONE SURVIVOR.  Thus, this documentary is an excellent precursor to watching that film.  I highly recommend giving this one a look.  It is a poignant and powerful glimpse into a true American hero.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1390262400,,1961,4.599423631123919

It is a comfort knowing there are people in the world like him, with so much personal integrity.

6112273,5,B00GTF526M,This documentary gives you an insight of what Lt. Michael Murphy was all about. He was an amazing man and he displays the type of courage that anyone wishes of having. I enjoyed this documentary so much that I will have to say that it was my #1 favorite documentary. R.I.P. Lt. Michael Murphy.. you will always be a hero to me,1389484800,,326,4.274193548387097
6112274,5,B00GTF526M,Excellent job bringing the man out of the story.  I was very familiar with the tale of Operation Red Wings and the book Lone Survivor.  This gave a great snapshot of one of the real hero's from that fateful day.  My young boys even seemed to enjoy seeing about a real life hero. RIP Lt Murphy.,1389484800,,293,4.196428571428571
6112275,5,B00GTF526M,"This documentary is one of the best I have seen. It gave insight with personal notes of a determined boy who became a great man. Michael Murphy is a hero and nothing less. Michael portrays who God created men to be in the first place. This film was heartfelt and brought my daughter and I to tears, knowing the losses and sacrifices of so many soldiers and their families. I definitely recommend this film.",1389484800,,406,4.5
6112276,5,B00GTF526M,This documentary does an excellent job showing what the American military is all about and how brave our soldiers and sailors are. It puts a human story where there is usually none. 5 stars no doubt.,1389484800,,199,4.555555555555555
6112277,5,B00GTF526M,I watched it with my young teenagers as an example to them on how to live their life. Lt. Murphy left a lasting impression on all that he met and the story needed to be told.,1389484800,,174,3.861111111111111

6112279,2,B00GTF526M,"The whole movie is about Murphy's family talking about Murphy.
About what a nice guy he was, and how they remember him. Very touching but not really something I look forward to watching.
I took it for granted it would be like ""Killing Bin Ladin"" where you actually see Navy Seals in action.
Although I'm very touched and feel very bad for his family, I don't think this movie is worth watching unless you actually enjoy going to funerals,
Everything that happens in the movie is something you would expect to see / hear in a funeral.
If this sort of thing is what you enjoy, then go for it.
Otherwise don't waste your time, this movie has no business being on Amazon for rent / sale.
I think it stinks..",1389398400,4,703,4.374045801526718
6112280,5,B00GTF526M,"The movie was about the person, and not the battle. Loved it. It's definitely worth watching. I guess I have about five months to figure out how to do 100 pull ups (for Memorial Day Murph on May 26, 2014).",1389398400,,205,4.15

It was well done with a lot of family and friend interviews and brought tears to my eyes. Thanks for your sacrifice brother. You are not forgotten.",1389398400,,439,4.714285714285714
6112283,5,B00GTF526M,I ordered this the first day it was out...downloading it onto my Kindle.  I was not disappointed.  This was a wonderful heartfelt documentary of a true hero of our times.  It shows you what our men and women in uniform do to protect us from harm and the commitment they have to do this.

6112286,5,B00GTF526M,This the best doc film ever made. This film should win an ocacar along with lone Survior. These two film shows what real American hereo is. Am not  just saying because Michael is my cousion. He is the pride of my family. Some people have raltives with movies stars or famious singers but my family have a real hero and real american and I wouldn't trade him for anyone. When I think of my cousin I hold my head up high.

6112287,5,B00GTF526M,"Instead of focusing on Lt Michael Murphy's final hours, ""Murph The Protector"" focuses on his life as a normal boy who grew to have a deep sense of service and duty. The film is still resonating with me days after I watched it and I feel it will do the same for the weeks to come.

It's a collection of impressions and memories from the family, friends and people who knew Lt. Murphy.  It's as much a tear-jerker as it is inspirational.

This doc covers the character of Michael Murphy; An unbelievable american that lived and demonstrated the values of a real hero and someone to look up to.  I was brought to tears on occasion hearing the stories from his friends and family.  At times though, I wasn't sure who some of the people being interviewed were and how they fit into Murph's life.  Oddly absent from the documentary were his fiancee and Marcus Luttrell.  Very possibly just too painful for them, but I thought it left a void.",1389225600,88,616,4.719626168224299

But what we didn't know was who Michael Murphy was. Where he grew up,what type of person he was. I really enjoyed hearing the stories and seeing the man behind the cameo. I enjoyed hearing what he was about and what he stood for in every day life. Not just war.

This movie wasn't about politics or war. It was a beautiful story of a young man with such promise and hope who left the world too soon.

I highly recommend to anyone who is interested in hearing about a true American hero.",1515456000,4,620,4.282051282051282
