The special features are also stellar, with a ton of great materials showing behind-the-scenes events, a cool little alternate opening shot for the guys (wink wink), and a huge collection of trailers and TV spots (including the French release trailer and the original Central Park Media rerelease trailer), among other cool things (my personal favorite is Yuji Moriyama's fantastic film commentary).

There are even a couple of references to US cartoons/comics.

Excellent animated 1986 Sci-fi comedy spoof from director Yuji Moriyama is a nicely animated and totally funny film that has became a box-office hit in Japan and was released in the US and all over the world in 1992. What makes this a cult classic is due to it's spoofing of the superhero subgenre including to anime like ""Fist of the North Star"", ""Macross"" and ""Captain Harlock"" that are guaranteed to make otakus (anime fans) giggle, 2 cute girls like A-Ko and B-Ko who are total hotties that i adored since i was a young teen, good animation in some parts, action and some originality. I believe this movie was a source to other superhero parody films like ""The Incredibles"" or ""Hancock"", i always loved this movie since i was 14 when i saw it 16 years ago on video after being blown by Akira.

This DVD contains excellent remastered picture plus English and Japanese dubs with subtitles, an audio commentary with english subtitles, trailers/TV Spots, Japanese behind the scenes video, itnerview with the director, music videos, outtake and fanart gallery.",1311552000,2,1663,4.711340206185567
560717,5,6303104207,"All too often in today's video market classic anime films are abandoned and left to wither away when their licenses expire or their domestic licensing company goes belly-up.  This happened with ""Project A-Ko,"" an anime classic and fan favorite when Central Park Media went out of business a few years ago.  Luckily, Discotek Media has re-released this animated, Japanese gem on their Eastern Star label.  Is this new DVD edition worth picking up?  Well, first I'll talk about the movie itself for those who have not seen it so they can decide whether or not they want to buy this DVD, then I will discuss the new DVD release itself for the benefit of the ""A-Ko"" fan who already owns the movie and wants to know whether to spend their hard-earned cash on this or stick to the old CPM two disc edition.

The Movie:

A-Ko and C-Ko are new students at Graviton Academy, an all-girls high school in a city that was destroyed by a mysterious meteor 16 years ago and subsequently rebuilt in the middle of the ensuing crater/lake.  Their first day at their new school does not go completely well, though for two reasons:  a)C-Ko is a crybaby who talks and acts about half her age and b) rich-girl classmate B-Ko has an inexplicable crush on the annoying little twit and will do anything to win her, which first involves getting the little blonde's best friend A-Ko out of the way.  This may be difficult though considering that A-Ko has the physical strength of a thousand men.... Meanwhile, a mysterious alien spy is searching Graviton City for a lost extraterrestrial princess that disappeared on Earth 16 years ago.  Hmm....

If you were to tie me up and make me name my favorite anime film of all time, I would - after telling you that I'm not into bondage - probably name this film.  I love this movie.  It's funny, it's exciting, it's brilliant, it's everything an anime movie should be.  This was made by fans for fans, and it shows.  Everything an otaku could want - schoolgirls, giant robots, spaceships, panties, endless references to old anime - is here and here in abundance, although it never overdoes it either.  Sheer love for the entire animated medium is evident here as well, and is expressed through the animation itself: for its budget this movie is superbly animated (thanks in part to animation director Yuji Moriyama, who is one of the best in the business and later went on to work on the likewise otaku-fueled productions ""Wings of Honneamise"" and ""Gunbuster"" for Gainax). The real brilliance of ""Project A-Ko"" though is that its appeal is not limited to hardcore otaku; any general anime fan or moviegoer will find something to enjoy or laugh at in this film.  For example, B-Ko's henchman (henchgirl?), the huge, manly and thuggish schoolgirl character Mari is funny on her own but is even funnier when you realize that she is a parody of Kenshiro from ""Fist of the North Star.""  Yes, a parody of head-explodin' Kenshiro that is a *Japanese Schoolgirl.* That is sheer brilliance, folks.  The fight scenes as well will appeal to a general audience along with those into action anime: A-Ko and B-Ko's final battle is the greatest girl-fight in anime, as they thrash each other and then proceed to demolish large chunks of Graviton City in a struggle that will make you both laugh in amusement and gape in amazement.  Another interesting facet of this wonderful film that makes it fun to watch is that all of the main characters are female.  This is rare in any movie, much less an animated feature from Japan.  I doubt that the makers of ""Project A-Ko"" had any feminist intentions in doing this - I'm sure they just liked animating pretty girls (and, you know, this did start out as a more risqu title) - but the end result is refreshing in a world of movies dominated by male protagonists.  Just one more bright spot in an overall stellar film.

Pluses - The comedy, the action, the voice acting, the music, the all-female cast, most of the animation.

Minuses - ....Although there are some animation hiccups.  This isn't ""Akira,"" after all.  Also the admittedly non-sophisticated humor may not appeal to some.

Conclusion - ""Project A-Ko"" is an anime classic.  This is just a joyful, superb animated movie that never fails to make me happy whenever I watch it.  Highly recommended.

The DVD:

Now onto the question on many ""A-Ko"" fans' minds: what is on this DVD and how does it differ from the previous Central Park Media release from a few years back?

Well, first of all this new Discotek/Eastern Star release has one disc - the film itself - as opposed to the two disc CPM release, which included a soundtrack CD.  So no bonus disc with this one.

Secondly, you no longer have to watch a badly animated image of M.D. Geist pollute your screen every time you start the movie.  It might seem like a minor quibble to some, but to me this was (and is) the most annoying part of watching any ""US Manga Corps"" CPM disc.  This is especially egregious when watching any actual *good* movies that CPM put out, like this one or ""Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer.""  The effect for me is analogous to being forced to watch the trailer for a Michael Bay crud-fest before viewing ""Seven Samurai,"" or being forced to hear a Pat Boone song before listening to Beethoven's Symphony No. 9.  Wait, did I just compare watching ""Project A-Ko"" to experiencing Kurosawa or Beethoven?  Yes, yes, I did.

On the video side, this ""remastered"" edition is very good, and better overall than CPM's (which was itself an improvement over the even earlier Image DVD)... with a few exceptions.  I ran the two discs at the same time in two different windows side-by-side on my computer to compare them.  The Discotek image is a lot sharper than the one on the CPM disc, and has better colors.  In the previous release, for example, reds were rendered as more orange than real red.  The colors on this DVD are deeper and more vivid.  In fact, ""more vivid"" is a term I would use to describe the video on this release, for better and for worse.  It looks like Discotek turned up the contrast on this disc - this is evident in the scene when A-Ko and C-Ko are in the movie theater: the flickering screen creates a strobe effect that that made me uncomfortable when I watched it... I hate to think of what it might do to someone prone to epilepsy.  Also, the higher contrast results in crushed blacks, i.e. the condition in which there is less detail in shadows and dark spots.  So, you have to take the good with the bad.  Overall, though this is an image upgrade, although I don't know if it can be called a true ""remaster,"" as the DVD cover claims.  I think the video on this disc was taken from the same video source as the previous CPM release and not the original film negative, for two reasons.  First, I believe the original negative does not exist anymore (the Japanese are not known for their awesome film preservation).  Secondly, I did spot some ""video lines"" in this release, just as I did in Central Park Media's.  These ""video lines"" (I don't know the proper technical term) look like the result of transferring an image to DVD from an old analog source - magnetic tape, laserdisc, whatever.  Now, they are very minimized and smoothed over in this edition and not as noticeable as in CPM's - but they are still there.  This isn't a huge deal for me though as I'm just glad the image was cleaned up and sharpened.  So, overall a good effort from Discotek and a nice visual experience, although not really a true ""remaster"" in my mind, hence the quotes.

""Project A-Ko"" is presented in its open matte aspect ratio of 1.33:1 (aka 4:3).  This means that the image on your screen is the original negative aspect ratio, which was re-matted (i.e. had the top and bottom chopped off) to a widescreen ratio for its original theatrical release.  Interestingly, the original 90s Image DVD release chose to present ""A-Ko"" in its theatrical aspect ratio on a (non-anamorphic) widescreen DVD .  All subsequent releases have gone with the original negative ratio - more picture.  This is nothing new - Stanley Kubrick filmed a lot of his movies in open matte but cut them to widescreen for their theatrical showings; later video releases used either version depending on the TVs prevalent at the time.  Wait, did I just compare ""Project A-Ko"" to the films of Stanley Kubrick, one of the greatest film-makers ever?  Yes, yes, I did.

Audio-wise, this disc is the same as CPM's (with one exception, which I will talk about later).  It has the same 2 channel stereo Japanese, English and Commentary tracks as the older disc.  The Japanese track sounds great for its age.  The English track is not as good, but seeing as how it contains an old Manga Entertainment dub, I don't listen to it a lot anyway (I don't really like Manga dubs).  The commentary track is the same.  Subtitles are the same as CPM's (they use the same translation) but are white instead of yellow.

And now the biggie: what extras are on this disc?  Well, the answer is: Discotek ported over most of the extra goodies from the CPM disc, so this is not a bare-bones release.  Yay!

Here is a list of all of the special features on this DVD:

Outtake - This is a short alternate take of a scene in the beginning of the movie where A-Ko's shirt becomes see-though when backlit (this was originally going to be hentai, remember?) that was toned down for the final release.  Interestingly this extra was *not* on the previous CPM disc - it was inexplicably on CPM's DVD for one of the later ""A-Ko"" OVAs.

Music Videos - These are the same music videos from the previous CPM release.

Image Gallery - This is a different image gallery from the Central Park Media disc - there aren't as many pictures, but they are larger .

Trailers and TV Spots - This is the exact same as on CPM's edition, down to the English re-release trailer - for the CPM release!  Hilarious!

Making Of - Again, this is the exact same extra from the CPM disc.  Warning: this is very, very Eighties with a capital Eight.  Part of it was filmed in 80s LA (the music producers and composers for this movie were American) so expect Big Hair.

Interview With Yuji Moriyama - Ditto.  (Except for the Big Hair part)

Commentary With Yuji Moriyama - Ditto.

Some of the extras on Central Park Media's Collector's Series edition are not on this disc, namely the fan art section and comic comparison, but these are honestly not missed that much.  If I want to see fan art I can look on the Internet, and the CPM comics (by Tim Eldred, I believe) weren't that interesting.  Also not included (for obvious reasons) are the feature about CPM's video restoration and the CPM product trailers.

Winding up, the biggest and most pleasant surprise for me on this new release is how nice the *disc* itself is.  Let me explain:  the previous Central Park Media release of ""Project A-Ko"" was one of the worst-coded discs of all time.  I actually bought it twice (both times used).  The first time the copy I bought had a noticeable scratch on it.  When I put it into my computer's external drive it didn't want to play at all, and when I put it into my internal drive it barely wanted to play.  There was one point in the movie when the audio ""hiccuped"" (during the scene where we first meet the alien captain - this is the audio exception I was talking about earlier).  I figured that this was because of the scratch and returned it.  Well, when I got my second copy sans scratches I put it into my external drive and discovered... that the exact same thing happened (it was better on the internal drive though, but then again I had gotten a new computer in the meantime).  Therefore the problem wasn't the scratch but the encoding on the disc itself.  This new Discotek disc works like a charm - no problems at all playing it in my DVD player or PC, no more audio hiccup.  The only downside is that it is region encoded for Region 1 whereas CPM's DVD was All-Region, so I guess anyone outside North America without a Region-Free DVD player is out of luck.  Still, a huge improvement.  Thanks, Discotek!

Pluses - Better overall image quality (especially sharpness and colors) than older releases, great extra features, better disc encoding, no more audio hiccupping.  I even like the new cover art - very nice, very close to the theatrical poster!

Minuses - Higher video contrast may offend some, crushed blacks.

Conclusion - This new Discotek/Eastern Star DVD release of ""Project A-Ko"" is overall a better product than Central Park Media's 2002 two Disc set.  The only thing you miss out on here is the bonus soundtrack CD that came with that release, but the new video quality more than makes up for it.  If you own that version, seriously consider upgrading.  It's like upgrading from a cheap old paperback copy of a Shakespeare play to the nice hardback complete collection of all his plays. If you *haven't* yet bought ""A-Ko"", buy this.  You will be glad you did.

Wait, did I just compare ""Project A-Ko"" to the genius works of William Shakespeare, the greatest playwright who ever lived?

Why, yes, yes I -

560718,5,6303104207,"I was looking for a review comparing the Collector's Edition of Project A-ko and the standard widescreen to see what would be the better version of the film to own. After watching them both, in my personal opinion the Collector's Series version is definitely the way to go. This version has: Trailers and commercials, an interview with Yuji Moriyama, the soundtrack on CD, a couple of mini documentaries about the making of the film and you get to see the people behind the film and soundtrack. I really enjoyed this version of the film. When I watched the original widescreen release of the film I instantly could feel the superiority the Collector's Series of the film had over it. The video quality of the widescreen is not as clean looking and there are practically no extras on the widescreen version.. I think maybe only the original Japanese dialogue. Sorry I can't remember.

Even though now it's several years later, and the animation style's age shows through, I enjoy re-watching it.  This may sound weird coming from a man's keyboard, but Project A-ko is my ""feel good"" movie.",1129248000,2,471,4.5058823529411764
560809,5,6303104207,"Yeah, you heard that right. The best EVER. Unfortunately, Central Park Media has never been the top-of-the-line in terms of packaging, voice acting, mastering (etc., etc., etc...), but that's the reality. Unless you have a Region 2 DVD player and can dig up a Japanese version, this is the best you're going to get.

If you have to ask what Project A-ko is, you may wish to go back to watching Cartoon Network, because you'll probably hate it. Otherwise, this is the brainchild of Yuji Moriyama, an anime director who seems to have had a role in creating every single 80s anime series (yes, they made anime in the 80's. What, you weren't born then? Oh). Moriyama also directed several orginal video productions, most of which were slightly above average fanservice-fests. However, Moriyama had a moment of sheer genius and created Project A-ko, a film that is supposedly about three girls (who Moriyama and his team didn't get around to naming, thus Girls A, B, and C) but is more an excuse to blow things up, break things, promulgate even more fan service, and lampoon just about every major anime up to that time.

There is a storyline, but it gets weirder and weirder as things go on and starts to reference things so obscure most Japanese fans can't even recognize them all. Good thing that the humor is easy to laugh at, the animation is top-notch (for the time), the character designs are wonderful, and of course that nothing is sacred. A-ko, by the way, is a normal happy schoolgirl who is habitually late, likes junk food, and can lift a tank. B-ko is her wannabe evil genius rival; hers is a stereotype almost any anime fan of any age will recognize - the evil pretty girl. B-ko, however, is also completely insane. C-ko is a walking cerebral hemmorage who could have been written into the movie after Moriyama had a vision of infuriating 'Ninja Scroll' and 'Akira' fans for the next 25 years. She is also A-ko's best friend. The only other characters of significance are the cross-dressing aliens. To summarize, B-ko decides to steal C-ko away from A-ko. This soon turns into 'A-ko must die,' so B-ko begins to create a stream of incredibly destructive inventions to use on A-ko, who -unfortunately for B-ko- is invincible. Hilarity ensues.

Moriyama succeeded brilliantly, but sadly A-ko was buried by godawful dubs, the curse of being shown on the infant SciFi Channel, several very mediocre sequels, and the fact Central Park Media went from being an obscure producer of weird overpriced VHSes in the 80s to the most obscure anime distributor on the face of the earth today.

I have not listened to the newest dub of this movie and I don't plan to. If you cannot bear to watch this movie in Japanese, please click on over to the DragonBall/YuGiOh/Hello Kitty portion of Amazon. If you haven't seen A-ko but your buddies make fun of you for watching 'wussy' anime, whine that they can't read subtitles, or think the Evangelion movie is the greatest thing since Benedict Spinoza, then A-ko may be for you.

Perhaps you can imagine watching an ancient VHS with the words ""CONTAINS NUDITY""  printed embarassingly on the box, or perhaps you can imagine you are watching this in a darkened Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza conference room at a sci-fi convention in a time before 99.99999% of the US population knew what ""Japanamashin"" is and anime cost $34.95 for thirty freaking minutes... if you could even find it outside of mail order. If you can, you may very be blown away by this ludicrously irreverent, clever, and endearing  anime that has stood the test of time, if not the test of marketability.

One was the Robotech generation and one of many others was the Akira generation (whose descendants still go nuts over ever blood spray they see).

560810,5,6303104207,"Project A-Ko is a total send-up of the genre, which is no doubt why I enjoyed it (and its sequel) so much. It has the usual giant mechanical paraphernalia, teenage school girls, and crossdressing alcoholic aliens. Err... where did they come from? Never mind: far more than most of the famous and iconic animes it parodies, Project A-Ko is entertaining, intriguing, and often just fall-down laughing funny. It's sort of like Japanese anime directed by an English eccentric. It's still sutiable bewildering in a Japanese sort of way, but with flashes of anglo style satire thrown in.

In the director's notes, Shigeru Morikawa, gives tons of interesting facts and trivia about the creation and dynamics of Project A-ko. What was first planned to be a soft porn cartoon turned a science fiction anime slug fest and acknowledged by Japanese animation industry insiders as a hallmark in the field of Japanese animation.

In fact, I was surprised to find out that tons of famous people in the field of manga (such as Kia Asamiya of Silent Mobious fame) and animation (people who worked on great Sci-Fi series like Macross and Evangelion) were key animators and contributed to the storyline of this movie.

I could go on for ages but I would spoil it too much. So if you are still behind the times and want to update your A-ko to DVD or haven't watched the movie but considering the purchase, I say, go ahead you'll love not only the anime itself but also the tons of extras packed within.",1118793600,3,1174,4.4511627906976745

The characters all appeared very real and I felt I could relate to their situations. But then again another twist; the plot took a full right turn and captured my imagination!!!! This film has everything; comedy, tragedy, love, drama, and more comedy!!!  And not to mention, the brutal fighting scenes'!! The animation is classic, and no fan should miss out on the rising era of anime! Please, I beg whomever is even CONSIDERING this film, to buy, rent, or even borrow it!!!

Days later when a race of female-male mixed aliens from space come kidnapping C-Ko, both A-Ko and B-ko fight each other off in a triangle on who gets to be her friend and also trying to save the poor girl.

Hilarious and wild 1986 cult Sci-fi comedy animated feature from Japan was a box-office hit in it's country and has became a popular cult animated feature since it's 1992 US debut in theaters. There are 2 cute animated girls like A-Ko and B-Ko who are both dreamy toon girls guaranteed to make guys go nuts, good animation and a nifty storyline as this movie predates ""The Incredibles"" and ""Hancock"" in terms of superhero parodies as this one was a possible inspiration. I remember back in 96 when i was 14 after being blown away by Akira, i decided to rent this one before my last day of school for summer break along with Grave of the Fireflies, i saw Grave first as it saddened me then afterwards i got good laughs and fun from this hilarious anime spoof. I like how it pokes fun at ""Fist of the North Star"", ""Captain Harlock"" and ""Macross Plus"" in comical ways. If your looking for something with cute anime girls and laughs with excitement, seek this one.

The movie is about A-Ko, your average high school gal...with super powers??  Yep!!  And her best friend C-Ko who is so nice and ignorant it's down right annoying.  And the super genius antagonist B-Ko who is trying to steal C-Ko's affection away from A-Ko.  Everything goes screwy when Aliens come to Earth looking for their long lost Princess.

560815,4,6303104207,"This is one of the few animes that I still get a kick out of (mainly because of the fact that it is an anime that ridicules its own genre).  After seeing my fair share of Japanese animation movies and series, I have noticed an unfortunate trend.  That is, that anime is utterly plagued with stereotypes.  This movie redeems itself in that it (quite intentionally) pokes fun at those rampantly recurring elements that make up Japanese animation.
What themes am I referring to?  I'm talkin' bout' epic space battles with zillions of missles, about ultra hot women fighting and striking poses left and right, about the stupid sailor outfits, gigantic robots, jealousy among peers in a prestigious school, etc.  Just about every sterotype is represented here, and played off as exactly that.
So check it out.  There's something here for you no matter what.  I'm willing to bet that if you love or hate most animes, you'll at least enjoy this somewhat.  I also want to point out the fact that the overall QUALITY of the animation here is AMAZING even today.  ...  This is the one to watch.  This movie has provided me with a surprizing amount of entertainment value over the years, and has imparted a strange attraction to redheads on me to boot.",1041811200,,1241,4.699074074074074
560816,5,6303104207,"The Collector's Series DVD version of Project A-ko is all new version of an anime classic. This version is far better then the old Image version in just about every way. CPM were able to locate the original full screen version of the film (all the old versions had the top and bottom cut off to create a wide screen version for the theater), and the film has been Digialy remastered. The remaster was well done, colour is much better then the old release, black level is back where it should be without being crushed. I don't see any artifacts like I have seen in some other remastered animation. Gone are the badly timed white subtitles of the Image release, this version has very easy to read subtitles in yellow with thin black boarder.
Extras? Some of the best I've seen on any anime DVD! All the extras from the old LD are back (missing on the Image DVD), plus new ones from the Japanese SE LD, plus some created just for this release. If you buy the A-ko box set you also get the sound track on a CD (along with two more DVDs).
There are lots of good reviews here about the movie, I've just reviewed the technical features of this DVD. If you have ever been interested in this movie, or even already have a Image version THIS is the version to buy! I don't see how it could be any better.",1029715200,2,1294,4.285714285714286

Go ahead and get this edition, and pay no mind to what follows:I won't go on about how great this movie is. I leave that to the other reviewers. What I will talk about is the dreadful job that has been done releasing this. The picture is grainy. They didn't clean up the scratches on the film. The sound quality on the Japanese track is okay, but is shockingly poor on the english dub. Trust me, even if you prefer dubs to subs, you won't like this. They also put the subtitles on the picture itself instead of below it like they used to. I advise you to wait for the Project A-ko collection. Rent it first, and see if they don't do a better job.

560958,5,6303104207,"Maybe all the wackiness got to my head, but I think this is the best Japanese animated film, if not the best movie ever. I haven't been watching it much lately, but that could be 'cause I watched it about 5 consecutive times when I first rented it and more than 20 times after I eventually bought it 4 years ago. Hey! How many times have YOU watched a single flick? Seriously though, I have been known to have weird taste so you might not like this film nearly as much as I do. However, if you'd like a movie with the hyper behavior found in Ranma 1/2 and Tenchi Muyo and the blow-everything-up machine clashes of the Gundam series, Project A-ko is your ticket.
A-Ko (or Eiko) is a teenage girl with super-human strength and speed. When she transfers to Gravitron High with her friend C-Ko, she runs into an old foe from kindergarten named ...you guessed it... B-Ko. I don't know why the creators of the movie chose an ABC list like this, but that's Japanime for ya.
B-Ko wants to fight A-Ko to the finish with C-Ko as the prize. ""We'll call it our own superbowl.""
Things get even weirder when androgynous aliens think C-Ko is their lost princess and want to take her back to their home planet. Now A-Ko has to fight B-Ko's robots and an elite force from outer-space.
The English dubbing is not bad, especially for a foreign film. All the characters sound fine and their altered lines still fit the cartoon almost perfectly.
Everything up to this point was written for the VHS version of this movie. Now, the Collector's Series DVD is slightly different. I'm sure Amazon.com tells all the extra features but there is something you might want to know: near the end of the movie (when Miss Ayumi steps out of the classroom onto the balcony), there is a slight pause that shouldn't be there. This is trivial and it's probably just the copy I have, but I thought you should know. This is a Dual-Layer Format DVD. It says on the back of the box that the ""Layer transition may trigger a slight pause.""

One more thing: don't bother using the english subtitles to read words you can't quite make-out. The direct english translation is different from the dubbing.",1020729600,,2155,4.5115089514066495

The fact that the aliens are women who look and sound like men, and that never being explained, just adds to the silliness and makes you laugh. All of the characters are lovable and the animation fits this type of a movie perfectly. It has a suggested lesbian theme but I found it refreshing from all of the ""boys fighting for girl's love"" themes. I want C-Ko to be my friend too!",995673600,2,676,4.090225563909774

Everything is fine until B-Ko, who's a science genius, wants to finish a battle of 10 years ago with A-Ko, so she can regain C-Ko's friendship again.  You'll gain a lot of laughs with this one.
I gave 4 stars only because the some of the subs are out of time, and that's tedious.  The english audio is terrible (but most of the anime fans like me doesn't care because we can't stand dubbed anime).  The DVD has no extras either.  Well, not all is bad, it's presented in its 1.815:1 original theatrical aspect ratio.  Anyway is worth the money, if you haven't watched the original Project A-ko!!!",995155200,,776,4.532374100719425
560962,5,6303104207,"The original Project A-ko is certainly one of the funniest titles in anime. Released in 1986, the action supposedly takes place in 2003 in Graviton City, Japan, the site where a massive meteor crashed seventeen years previous (after first destroying a Space Shuttle in orbit).
The main characters are A-ko, B-ko, and C-ko; A-ko is insanely strong and super-fast, B-ko is tremendously smart and uses her brains to design mecha, and C-ko is intensely stupid and highly impulsive. The relationship between the main characters is a bit fuzzy. On the surface, A-ko and C-ko are friends, and B-ko is jealous of their friendship. However, given that Project A-ko was originally intended to be a hentai (adult, sex-oriented anime) film, the intensity of B-ko's jealously and her many attempts to take C-ko, and the way that C-ko almost literally clings to A-ko all certainly allow for a lesbian-triangle reading of the film... which also adds more hilarity to the dialogue for those who are not offended by (pseudo-)lesbianism.
However, the aliens cannot be forgotten... and never will be forgotten. Only an alien would stand in the middle of a road day after day to faithfully conduct research!!! Apparently, sake is available outside our solar system, and is relied upon quite heavily by a particular alien. And the aliens - who come to Earth with a spacecraft seemingly larger than Rhode Island - also have some dirty laundry which needs airing. Further, how did the aliens learn Japanese so well, having apparently never been on Earth before?
Project A-ko is an excellent film to watch when in need of mindless fun, combining sexual- and gender-based humor with general slapstick and a high content of fast-paced, often-explosive, sometimes-meaningless chaos and violence. The subtitled VHS version also includes original French and Japanese trailers for the film (I remember seeing Project A-ko on a movie theater marquee when living in Belgium in 1990), providing an unusual learning opportunity for French and Japanese language teachers and teaching assistants to use in class; these additions are unfortunately not included on the Project A-ko DVD. This is one of many anime titles for which normal laws of physics and biology are often neglected, but always in the name of humor; for example, A-ko could never realistically survive sitting on the cockpit of a jet fighter at high altitude, and B-ko's monokini-style hardsuit could never realistically hold that much (read, ""unlimited"") ammunition!!!
Unfortunately, the sequels in the Project A-ko series all pale considerably compared to the original :-(  However, a ""redeeming"" point of Project A-ko 4 is the inclusion of a music video which is very much a throwback to mid-1980s American music videos, but featuring a Japanese all-girl group.",993772800,2,2795,5.197339246119734

It was startlingly fun story of a unexplainably puissant young girl who can run at supersonic speeds yet wears a cutesy school girl uniform and has a school girl crush on her best friend B-Ko. The movie is hilarious, off-beat and ironic in a very non-threatening way.  Its main theme is friendship, the importance of and maintenance of.

Made in 1986, it sports classic old-school hand-drawn animation throughout the whole production, which brings a tear to my eye and gives me the sniffles *cries*. But seriously, Project A-Ko is a classic piece of anime history, just as much as some major high-profile series like Neon Genesis Evangelion (a very good series indeed!), and it would behoove anybody even remotely interested in anime to buy it. You don't have to be a hardcore collector to enjoy A-Ko, and casual viewers will find their sides splitting over this movie's humor. There is plenty for everybody: Gunfights, big explosions, space battles, romance (talk about a subject shift!), intrigue, and enough physical humor to permanantly fracture your funny bone. Even the English dub of the movie is good, which is rare with older anime titles like this one. One particular scene in English is incredibly funny and happens to be the greatest KFC joke ever. Not that the English version is a gem, but compared to the dubbing in some series it stands out. Sailor Moon S, for example, has atrocious voice acting that I shun like the ebola virus, but that's beside the point. I enjoyed all of the movie, which sports cool 80s rock tunes and a good plot. The only reason I took off one star is that the audio isn't too great and the video could have been cleaned up some more, but these are mere oxpeckers on the charging rhinocerous that is A-ko.

While the story is about two high-school girls who end up fighting over the ""affections"" of another young girl (you think that's weird, wait'll you see the rest of this movie) while their city is in the midst of an alien invasion, this film was made mostly as a spoof of just about every other anime of its time in Japan.  Parodies of and references to characters from everything from Captain Harlock to Macross to Space Battleship Yamato (Starblazers) to Fist of the North Star show up in nearly every single scene, and it not only makes for wide grins and pointing fingers from otaku everywhere, but it also fits into this crazy flick like a glove.  Some of the rip-offs are pretty blatant (like the alien mothership; when you see it I'll give you three guesses to what it looks like), but hey, that's the point!  Aside from all that, this is one of those anime that simply has it all; cute girls in sailor suits, giant robots, aliens, almost-nonstop smash-mouth fighting action, and laughs aplenty.  The animation for its time is unparalleled; silky-smooth with theater-quality fluidity. The soundtrack, a rocking set of themes that keeps right up with the action, was put together entirely by Americans (the first of its kind!) and produced by the legendary Ritchie Zito (producer for Cheap Trick).

 * pre-occupation with  school girls (in sailor suits)
 * robots (with school girls inside)
  * repetitive fight scenes (to the extreme)
 * one central character  being annoying (to the extreme)
 * transgendered sub-theme (this is even  funnier after Ranma 1/2!)
 * Hidden plot elements that make more sense  on subsequent viewing
 * Characters stolen from other 1980's anime  series
 * period music (theme song almost identical to movie  Flashdance)
  * Inappropriate ""fan service"": dressing,  bathing, and upskirt shots, ...

7837584,4,6303104207,"In what could be considered the first official anime parody, Project A-ko(named after one of Jackie Chan's earliest flicks)is combo of several anime genres and titles that were popular during the early-to-mid-80s. This was one of the first anime productions by APPP, who still do work today on various TV shows.

Starting out around the mid-21st Century, a tremendous alien craft crashes on Earth creating a huge crater. Using technology acquired from the wreckage, the new Graviton City is constructed over the remains, which is a new bustling high-tech metropolis. A new school semester begins at the local high school where longtime buddies A-ko and C-ko start attending. A-ko is a spunky redhead with incredible super-strength, enhance speed, and near invulnerability(the answer to why is hinted at during the end of the first chapter), while C-ko is the single most annoying character in the history of anime, plus it's shown in the spinoff series that she's also the single most dangerous character too. All seems like plums and pudding for the old school friends, but the snobby B-ko has some kind of ""romantic"" fixation for C-ko, and was odd considering the whole shoujo-ai genre didn't really start up until the early 90s. So, B-ko uses her unlimited resources and genius intellect to constantly act as A-ko's personal Lex Luthor, even to the point of creating a scantily-clad power suit to match her strength. They have an overly-extended battle throughout the city, which is conveniently getting invaded by an alien armada searching for their long last princess, who they believe is C-ko. After the shrieking blonde hellbeast is capture by space invaders, A-ko leaps up several oncoming missiles to the mother ship to rescue C-ko. A-ko eventually grounds the giant spaceship, resulting in dozens of male-looking female aliens getting stranded on Earth.

The original first chapter spun-off three more OVAs, mostly dealing with B-ko and her gang trying to separate A-ko and C-ko, or fighting over a newcomer bishounen named Kei. There was also a spinoff OVA titled Project A-ko Vs. Battle which is one of the first anime reboots that definitively takes place in another universe and not just another remake. The first chapter of the original OVA was dubbed in English with a very questionable script, while the rest of the anime was dubbed by the Ocean Group from Canada which is a big of an improvement. There's also been an American comic adaptation of the first two OVA chapters, and spinoff by Ninja High School's Ben Dunn. The original OVA is pretty much mandatory for old school otaku to have seen at least once, but might be lost to some of the millennial anime fans.",1487635200,5,2684,5.002237136465324
7837585,4,6303104207,"A pretty fun anime flick, and a good example of the parody and gag elements that would later find their way into Excel Saga. The ""Fist of the North Star"" expy had me splitting my sides anytime she was speaking. C-Ko was a little bit shrill in either Japanese or English audio. While appropriate for the character, you'll definitely want a break after any prolonged scene with her in it to let your eardrums recover. Avoid watching with headphones altogether.",1483920000,,458,4.7375

Probably more for the oldschool fans out there.",1474588800,,80,4.785714285714286
7837589,4,6303104207,"Project A-Ko is a classic anime. There are other movies but this is the only one you should bother with. It's hugely fun to watch the insanely strong A-Ko getting wrapped up in a nonsense competition with her classmate B-Ko for the sheer visual pleasure of the viewer. If you like anime, for where it evolved from, this is essential to your collection.

One drawback to the DVD itself is the quality.  Sometimes the picture resolution isn't up to the quality it needs to be on modern screens.  This is not really a fault of the DVD itself but rather that the movie needs to have a remaster done for modern technology.",1466208000,2,617,4.491071428571429
