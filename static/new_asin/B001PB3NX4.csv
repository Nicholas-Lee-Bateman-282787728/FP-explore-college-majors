3746623,5,B001PB3NX4,"Incredible Priest.. Needs to be a Saint..Liotti portrays with deep understanding and talent..Pray God, we have more priests like this..Hope you love him too... Great Movie...",1243296000,13,174,5.730769230769231
3746624,5,B001PB3NX4,"This one is not just for Catholics, or even Christians, but for all people searching to perfect themselves. Excellent example of what it is to truly give of oneself for the sake of others, to the very end. Powerful ending. Re-masculinizes a badly feminized priesthood. A MUST for Catholic boys and teens who are still discerning God's path for them in life. Really shines as an example of what a priest is. Both holy and defective (the humanity) at the same time. This sort of movie should be mandatory viewing in all CCD classes. Great for girls also in terms of what a Catholic needs to be. This is the sort of film which inspires and inflames the seeds of priestly vocation in boys. Alas that ""modernist"" catechetical directors are so damned lame and insist on making Catholicism as ""comfortable"" as possible. What blindness!!",1236902400,38,829,4.763888888888889
3746645,5,B001PB3NX4,"A stunning story of a man who as a priest lead and was true to the cause. I loved Danile Liotti in this production as he portrayed a kind, caring, devoted and determined man who only chose to serve and carry out his priestly duty with only love in his heart. I recommend it highly. Many children who are now grown can thank Fr Carlo for his devotion.",1390348800,,350,4.161764705882353
3746646,5,B001PB3NX4,"I had already seen the movie, but I felt it would be wonderful to have a copy that I could share with my kids (7th graders) from Catequism.

We are currently learning about human dignity and this is a great way of showing how members of the church have fought for the ones who can not defend themselves.",1359936000,,303,4.224137931034483

3746648,4,B001PB3NX4,Pretty good film. Liked the acting and the depth with which it portrayed the characters. Inspiring in this secular world and the message is important.,1353542400,,150,5.04

3746650,4,B001PB3NX4,"This movie, one in a series of foreign made movies about Catholic Saints distributed by Ignatius Press, is a good family film. I cannot vouch for historical accuracy; some of these Italian made films get rather ""creative"" with the personal life of the Saint featured in the film. However, it is a noble story with good depiction of everyday kind of struggles that people go through.  The acting is on par with some American TV rather than Hollywood.  My 11 year old son, who loves to ""play war"" and shoots everything that moves (including his fav target- his father!) with his Nerf guns, but who also gets up every morning to serve at 7 AM Mass (yes, even in summer), really liked this Saint's story. He identified with Fr. Gnocchi's manliness in his devotion to God and affection for his friends. Often a man's spirituality is portrayed in a feminine manner, which can be demoralizing to a ""real boy"" (let alone a ""real man!""). I recommend this film.",1278547200,4,951,4.654761904761905
3746651,5,B001PB3NX4,"I was not sure what to expect with this film and it was awesome.
It is not syrupy in any way.  It presents a real man who was inspirational and dedicated to his mission.  He had courage and knew how to minister among those in need without making himself into a king among them.  He clearly won the hearts and touched the souls of the young men in the military around him.  This is a great movie.  He ""walks the talk"" of the Gospel - watch the video and you will be impressed; even if you don't consider yourself particularly ""religious"" you will find it easy to respect him and his personal character.",1266192000,4,601,4.283185840707965
3746652,4,B001PB3NX4,"Paul Fussell, a literary scholar and World War II veteran, writes about war largely from a perspective forged in infantry combat.  As an antidote to what he calls ""military romanticism"" he wrote the book, ""The Boys' Crusade: The American Infantry in Northwestern  Europe, 1944-1945,"" in which he states, ""anyone who imagines a military `victory' gratifying is mistaken"" (p. xiii).  Professor Fussell dedicated this book ""TO THOSE ON BOTH SIDES WHO SUFFERED"" (the dedication is entirely capitalized in the book).

I was reminded of ""The Boys' Crusade"" while watching the movie, ""Father of Mercy.""  In this film, war's gore and cruelty is seen from the vantage point of Father Carlo Gnocchi as a combat military chaplain for the Italian army in World War II and, after the war, as a caregiver for the war's most undeserving victims, children who were mutilated during the war by bullets, bombs and mines.  ""Father of Mercy"" shows casualties as being not only soldiers and civilians wounded and killed, but their families and friends.  Wounds are portrayed not only as physical, but mental and spiritual.

In one memorable combat scene on the Russian front, two Italian soldiers are suddenly confronted by a Soviet soldier. All three are paralyzed with fear - not of dying, but of killing.  Finally, the Russian is killed by one of the Italians, who suffered devastating psychological damage as a result.  This scene reflects findings of the United States Army that only 15% of American soldiers in combat in World War II fired their weapons at the enemy, so repulsive is it to kill another human being (see ""The Price of Valor,"" The New Yorker, July 12&19, 2004).

""Father of Mercy"" is laudable for its depiction of war and for its celebration of the selfless, heroic charity of Fr. Gnocchi.  My major complaint would be the inclusion in this movie of a love story subplot which unnecessarily lengthens the film, adding little if anything to the more important themes.",1259539200,27,1966,4.978593272171254
3746653,3,B001PB3NX4,"This priest's story was a good one, I am sure. But why insert a love triangle when there wasn't one in reality? Italy is the same as Hollywood it seems. And this true story took place during World War II. Well, the ones who made the movie were probably not Catholic or were born after Vatican II when the novus ordo Mass started. When this priest was actually a priest, the Mass was in LATIN and totally different from the way the director/producer portrayed it. The vestments were correct, but the words were not. This is not a truly Catholic movie. Somebody truly orthodox should remake this movie please! It was terrible. Also, the story was sappy to begin with. Not realistic. Shame on Ignatius Press for putting forth such a bad movie. Too long, too.",1250553600,22,755,4.5588235294117645
3746654,5,B001PB3NX4,"This is the story about a very good and unselfish man, a peron dedicated to a good cause and I like stories like this. He has also founded an excellent establishment or series of establishments as I have viewed these for the disabled in Italian, in Italy. If only we had such gracious clinics here in the USA!!",1243296000,10,310,4.362068965517241
