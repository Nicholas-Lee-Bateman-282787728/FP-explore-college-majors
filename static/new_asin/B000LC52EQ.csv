8161084,3,B000LC52EQ,I think the editing was well managed but the director and script writer had no cohesive construct.  Over all it is an interesting movie.,1417651200,,136,4.666666666666667
8161085,1,B000LC52EQ,This movie was very poorly made. I took it straight to the trash. I just didn't like the move at all.,1354492800,,101,3.857142857142857
8161086,2,B000LC52EQ,"Mediocre acting, minimal direction, and a miniscule budget have borne a typical mutt of a horror movie.  Unlike most modern creature features, however, this one takes itself so seriously that the improbable situations and blindly risky behavior make for a melodrama with undertones of comic absurdity.  The cinematography--and often the subject matter--resemble a home video of a family vacation.  Sets range from a residential pool that looks like a mini water park to a spartan, Ed-Woodsian hospital suite more reminiscent of a mechanic shop waiting room.  There's a sex foreplay scene with the paunchy lead seductively peeling off his shirt and canine-kill scenes where the victims look like they succumbed to paint-ball attacks.  The pacing is as lazy as a hound on a hot afternoon, but the viewer who can doggedly endure this dud will at least be rewarded with a howl or two of laughter.",1274140800,,892,5.082191780821918
8161087,1,B000LC52EQ,"OK, I admit, I love bad movies. And this may have proven to be my new favorite..it's just..awful. From it's complete lack of cinematic or editing continuity to it's bad industrial film style acting, the quality of this film is about fifth-grade home video level (sorry kiddies). But then I made the mistake of pausing it, and the DVD was so badly coded that it returns to the beginning and there are NO CHAPTERS in the entire thing, so you have to start over from the beginning. But then, when you try to fast-forward, it freezes up and returns to the beginning..AGAIN. Like I said, I love rotten movies, but even I'm not masochistic enough to watch this all the way to where I stopped in in order to find out the ending. I'll re-watch Devil Dog, hound of hell. Now THERE's a great/bad dog movie!!",1203465600,,797,4.465753424657534
