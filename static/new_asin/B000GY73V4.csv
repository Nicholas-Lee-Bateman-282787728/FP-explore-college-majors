2620429,4,B000GY73V4,"Naturals vs. Austin Aries & Roderick Stong- Better match then I expected. Great back and fourth action. Good way to start off the PPV.

Alex Shelley vs. Jay Lethal vs. Petey WIlliams vs. Matt Bentley- The one thing I watch TNA for. Great match but the ending seemed rushed. I wish they'd have a guy like Joey Styles doing commentary for these matches. Im sick of Tenay calling every cool move a power move.

James Gang vs. L.A.X- The PPV starts to drag on with this match. Tenay gave us the background on James Gang, as if wrestling fans didn't already know.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Abyss vs. Rhino- Typical Abyss match. The Best of the Bloodest Brawls is a great dvd but they do have some pretty weak hardcore matches. I will say the ending of the match saved it for me.

NWA Tag Team Champions AMW vs. Chris Sabin & Sonjay Dutt - The match was alright but I didn't find anything speical in the match.

X Division Champion Samoa Joe vs. Christopher Daniels vs. AJ Styles- Match of the night. These three man are the future of TNA. Well they should be at least, bringing all the WWE stars isn't really looking good for anyone but Joe. Hell of a match.

Team 3D vs. Team Canada- Boring.

NWA Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Christian Cage- Cage got the fans support by turning down WWE and telling them they are old and out dated. I love his promo's and agree about his views about WWE partly. The match was pretty good and you knew Cage was going win the title.

So theres my take on this PPV, I highly recommend it.",1187136000,4,1515,4.347517730496454

2620432,3,B000GY73V4,"This PPV focused on one thing...and that was Christian Cage's change at becoming a World Champion.  Christian was one of the best all around ""sports entertainers"" in the business.  He could wrestle, he could talk, he could entertain...however, he was never given the chance to be a main event due to not being seen as anything more than a ""mid card comedy act"" so he came to TNA for that opportunity he didn't get & this was it.

Preshow: Lance Hoyt, Shark Boy, Cassidy Riley vs. Diamonds In The Rough & Shannon Moore - Just a preshow match to warm up the crowd, nothing special here.

Preshow: Ron ""The Truth"" Killings vs. A1 - Pretty short & sweet as The Truth won this squash match

Naturals vs. Austin Aries & Roderick Stong - It's nothing special past a nice tag team match.

Alex Shelley vs. Jay Lethal vs. Petey WIlliams vs. Matt Bentley - There's really nothing new here as you won't see in other X division matches but again, they don't disappoint.

James Gang vs. L.A.X. - Apollo was suppost to be teaming with Homocide but he no-showed so Machetie took his place (before he was replaced with current member Hernandez).  This match was nothing outside of what you would normally see from the James Gang which is a real disappointment knowing what is capable from Homocide.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Abyss vs. Rhino - They took it back to the old ECW hardcore days in this match as it was non-stop brawling in the ring & through the area with even a gore that Abyss took from the top of the bleachers through tables that is something to see.

NWA Tag Team Champions AMW vs. Chris Sabin & Sonjay Dutt - This was actually a good tag team match as Sabin was really selling his ankle injury and AMW kept going after it.  Eventhough nobody questioned who was going to come out on top in this match...it was solid from start to finish.

Team 3D vs. Team Canada - This was your basic Team 3D formula match that again was solid but nothing special.

X Division Champion Samoa Joe vs. Christopher Daniels vs. AJ Styles - This match is just another wrestling clinic between these three that I honestly can't put into words.  It's right up there with any of the previous battles between either 3 of these men.

NWA Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Christian Cage - Before the match, all night Larry Zbyszko was implying that there would be no outside interference in this match & Earl Hebner would be the official.  With those stipulations in place, this wasn't the typical Jarrett match with brawling & non-stop interference until Jarrett wins.  These two wrestled with Jeff pulling out every dirty trick he could until Christian finally pulled out the win the end.  The celebration was really something to see as all the fans jumped into the ring & hoisted Christian high into the air.

Again, this PPV was just another good showing from TNA wrestling & I recommend.",1169596800,7,2862,4.5655577299412915
2620433,3,B000GY73V4,"...that's not saying much.  Here's how I saw things --NO SPOILERS:

1.  Pre-Show: The Naturals vs Team Canada
  Didn't catch it. (No rating.)

2.  Bingo Hall Brawl: Team 3D vs The James Gang
  Things get started off with a bang as these 4 come out brawling already.  This one brought back fond memories of the Dudleys' ECW days.  This was probably the best match that any of these 4 guys have put on in TNA to date.  A tad too short though.  ****(out of 5 stars)

3.  Handicap Match:  Rhino vs Bobby Roode & Coach D'Amore
  Total filler but nothing horrible, had an oddly satisfying ending.  **

4.  X Division Ranking Match:  Alex Shelley vs Senshi vs Shark Boy vs Jay Lethal vs Sonjay Dutt vs Petey Williams
  With all of these great high fliers I expected MUCH more from this slow paced match.  This is the X Division not Flair/Race.  It had enough good spots to keep it interesting though.  **1/2

5.  Chris Sabin vs Kevin Nash
  The whole David vs Goliath thing worked here.  Nothing spectacular but fun to watch.  **1/2

6.  NWA Tag Titles:  AMW (c) vs AJ Styles & Christopher Daniels
  One of the three great matches of the night.  Not a classic but still a decent tag match.  Styles & Daniels work amazingly well together. And the ending was funny. ***

7.  Grudge Match: Samoa Joe vs Scott Steiner
  Wow, the fact that this is one of the best matchs on the card is astounding, all things considered.  I'm no Steiner fan but he really delivers and Joe didn't have to carry him through the match at all.  It makes me wonder what COULD have happened in WWE with Steiner.  The only blemish?  The ending came out of nowhere and was way too abrupt.  I guess they decided they were running out of time.  ****

8.  King of the Mountain Match for the NWA Heavyweight Title: Christian Cage (c) vs Sting vs Abyss vs Ron Killings vs Jeff Jarrett
  Sooooo that's it??  This was my first KOTM match and I loved the premise.  However, the execution of this particular bout was somewhat sloppy and very uneven.  It started off with intensity that burned out quickly and turned into a redundant brawl with the occasional high spot.  Abyss does his typical table spot which was much appreciated and the ending was bizarre but entertaining.  It's obvious that Killings was booked here to pick up the pace but even he can't carry the slow nature of the rest of these guys (Christian Cage excluded).  *** (just barely)

--Essentially a 2 match card: Team 3D vs James Gang and Samoa Joe vs Steiner.  Both were great!  The main event and tag titles match were decent but not fantastic.

--The rest of the matches are average but none sucked.

Overall PPV Rating (not an average): ***1/2

This was the 3rd TNA PPV I caught in '06 And out of the ones I've seen I'd say it's the worst of the year (although I haven't seen them all yet).  That being said it is STILL better than nearly every WWE---the only WWE PPV in '06 worth viewing was WM 23.",1168128000,2,2928,4.4
2620434,3,B000GY73V4,"Slammiversary was one of those PPV's where it starts off strong, gets a little stale in the middle but then picks up and has an ending that you will either love or hate.  It was a good show but I would expect more for them celebrating their four year anniversary.

Bingo Hall Brawl: Team 3D vs. James Gang - This was an ""extreme"" tag match that had weapons & brawling all over the arena...and actually looked like a legit fight at times instead of a wrestling brawl.  This wasn't the typical 3D or James Gang type of match but it was really enjoyable.  For those who want to know, the hidden message behind Bubba's statement at the end of the match was to show Vince McMahon how ECW is really done compared to the first week episode of ECW on Sci-Fi.

Rhino vs. Bobby Roode & Scott D'Amore - This was the worst match (compared to all the others) of the PPV as it was just an average match with some comedic spots involving Scott D'Amore but the story were was about Rhino getting his hands on D'Amore which he did in the end.  It was about as good as you expect it to be.

Senshi vs. Sonjay Dutt vs. Jay Lethal vs. Petey Williams vs. Alex Shelly vs. Shark Boy - Typical X divsion type of match with some nice spots at times.

Kevin Nash vs. Chris Sabin - This was the start of the ""Size Matters"" storyline with Kevin Nash & the X division (which ended due to Nash being hurt...AGAIN!!!!).  This ""david vs. goliath"" type of match actually worked because the storytelling was that despite Nash's tough talk, he couldn't beat Sabin unless he had help.  He did make Sabin look strong here & actually sold his offence.  I'll give it more credit that I would normally give a Kevin Nash match.

NWA Tag Team Champions AMW vs. AJ Styles & Christopher Daniels - This was the match of the night as Styles & Daniels knew each other so well that he made a credible tag team while AMW are just the best in the business today.  Plus that ""Chyna-like"" woman who showed up for Gail Kim was also a nice added bonus.

Samoa Joe vs. Scott Steiner - This one match will crap on all of Steiner's matches in WWE.  Steiner was allowed to be himself & do his ""stiff"" mat game while everyone who watches TNA knows what Joe is capable of.  A different type of Joe match here than we normally see in the X divsion but still effective & still good to watch.

King of the Mountain Match: NWA Champion Christian Cage vs. Jeff Jarrett vs. Sting vs. Abyss vs. Ron Killings - This was the first King Of The Mountain match I've seen & it's a unique concept once you understand how all the rules go & watch it come together.  The match itself was something to watch as you see multiple stories being told at different times (ala ""does Sting want the belt or just doesn't want Jarrett to have it?""...the story between Sting & Christian).  However, the ending really overshadowed the whole match as they were tryin' to do a ""Montreal Screwjob""  ending with Jarrett (HBK), Larry Zbyszko (McMahon), and Earl Hebner.  You could see how the TNA fans felt about this match & the idea of Jarrett having ANOTHER title reign at the end.

Also throughout here, Jim Cornette is introduced as the TNA figurehead and gives a great promo (one of the best promo men in the business) putting over the TNA product.

Bonus Section: Eric Young & A1 of Team Canada vs. The Naturals - Just an average tag team match.  The main point of this was the speech given to the Naturals by Shane Douglas after the match.

They also had two VERY well done 15 min. video features on the King Of The Mountain match.  One of them showing the wrestlers arriving to the building & preparing for the match while analizing each wrestler in the match & the match itself with comments from Tenay & West.  The second one has all the participants along with Tenay, West, Zbyszko & Hebner talking about the aftermath of the match and once again, trying to put it over as TNA's version of Survivor Series of '97.  That hurts this because Montreal was REAL & nobody will ever be able to recreate or top that incident.

Bottom line is that Slammiversary was a nice TNA PPV but it's not one of the best ones available.  I would check into Bound For Glory, Genesis, Turning Point, Against All Odds 2006, and both Lockdowns before thinking about this.",1158883200,9,4266,4.376903553299492

I got the old feelings of original 1980's-early 1990's WWF SummerSlam's. You remember WWF PPV's were spread out where feuds and title changes really meant something.  TNA PPV's are monthly but they differ from any organization just trying to make money...THEY REALLY MEAN SOMETHING! Great matches here's the rundown:

Eric Young & A1 of Team Canada vs. The Naturals *(I missed this preshow match - No Rating).

""Bingo Hall Brawl"" Team 3D (Brother Ray & Brother D-Von) vs. The James Gang (BG James & Kip James) *(Classic match between two dominate teams. This match is aggressive and worthy of any Best of TNA Wrestling DVD compilation - 4.5/5)

Rhino vs. Bobby Roode & Scott D'Amore *(Another classic, Roode is always outstanding.  All three of these guys really work well together.  Old school as the manager gets involved in his wrestler's match. Good Old School feeling in this match. 3.5/5)

Senshi vs. Sonjay Dutt vs. Jay Lethal vs. Petey Williams vs. Alex Shelly vs. Shark Boy *(The trademark X-Division at its best. The match feels a little long at some points but worth the watch! Great Match! 4.5/5)

Kevin Nash vs. Chris Sabin *(I loved this match! This wasn't just another david vs. goliath match.  TNA actually made this formula work. 4/5)

NWA Tag-Team Title Match: AJ Styles & Christopher Daniels vs. America's Most Wanted *(The internet predicted that this would be the match that steals the show. As predicted, THIS MATCH WAS AWESOME! This is a match that you will watch over and over again. 5/5)

Samoa Joe vs. Scott Steiner *(The battle of the bulls, good stuff but not great. Still a decent match. Joe in another classic performance. 4/5)

King of the Mountain Match for the NWA Title:

Jeff Jarrett vs. Sting vs. Christian Cage vs. Abyss vs. Ron Killings (A true MAIN EVENT! This match was hyped up perfectly and performed very well. Although the action becomes pretty ""mis-cued"" at times, still a very good match. The controversial ending gives fans the reason to watch Impact the following Thursday on Spike TV. Good work TNA! Keep the action coming. 4.5/5)

8135021,5,B000GY73V4,"TNA Against All Odds 2006 is one of the greatest wrestling Pay Per Views in the History of TNA. This is one of my favorite TNA dvds to watch as the main event was epic. Christian wrestled the match of his life and won the title. This was a great time for TNA as they were starting grow. They had just signed The Dudleys, Christian and Sting. They had a lot of momentum. 2006 one of the greatest years for TNA wrestling. Cage and Jarrett was an awesome match and the way they ended the show was great. It reminded me of when Dusty Rhodes won the NWA title for the first time and the fans ran into the ring to celebrate with him. Cage celebrated with all his fans and his dream came true.

  Preshow: Ron ""The Truth"" Killings vs. A1 - It was a brief match but The Truth on the card only helped it. Oh how things were changing four years before Ron was the champion now he was on the preshow.

Naturals vs. Austin Aries & Roderick Stong - Good match. The Naturals were always a great tag team and Aries and Strong had great years ahead of them.

Alex Shelley vs. Jay Lethal vs. Petey WIlliams vs. Matt Bentley - Great match loved all the wrestlers. I think Shelly and Lethal were always underrated. Petey was a great wrestler. Matt was good too.

James Gang vs. L.A.X. - Good solid match James Gang always deliver and L.A.X. was a team on the rise.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Abyss vs. Rhino - One of my favorite matches on the card. These two were a good match and I loved the match very hardcore.

NWA Tag Team Champions AMW vs. Chris Sabin & Sonjay Dutt - Loved AMW this was a great match and Sabin and Dutt were great. Dutt one of the underrated wrestlers in TNA. Sabin was great.

Team 3D vs. Team Canada - Great match Team 3D nough said one of the top five greatest tag teams ever. Team Canada was a hell of a team and if you don't believe look at where their members went onto. Young and Roode to be great TNA Champions.

X Division Champion Samoa Joe vs. Christopher Daniels vs. AJ Styles - The match was awesome. It was perfect to go before the main event. These three guys together couldn't have a bad match if they tried. Joe was gaining a lot of momentum and Styles and Daniels were neck and neck with him. All three came out as winners along with the fans.

NWA Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Christian Cage - Epic match. Cage and Jeff worked well together. This one was one of my favorite matches that Jarrett had. For those that said he liked putting himself over and being the star he really let Christian shine in this one. It was a great story being told. Cage had his shot to finally be a world champion on the main event level so it was do or die and he crossed the finished line. It was a great story for TNA giving a former WWE star who never had been given a fair crack at the title a shot at their title. Cage took the ball they gave him that night and went on to have 3 great years in TNA. This was how it started. Great show!",1433635200,,2945,4.131118881118881

Pre-show matches

-Ron ""The Truth"" Killings vs. A-1: Standard warm-up fair, but not good as Killings was in a rivalry with the Team Canada stable and its a quick one that sees Truth hits the spinning axe kick and covers to win. 1/10.

-6 Man Tag Team Match, Shannon Moore & The Diamonds in the Rough vs. Shark Boy, Cassidy Riley & Lance Hoyt: Not a bad one here, all guys get some good moves in, Hoyt's team works well before the heels take over working on Sharky. However miscommunication allows for Hoyt to be tagged who just overpowers everyone, Riley gets sent to the outside, Moore breaks up a pin for his own team, locks on a single leg crab but gets out of the ring after Elix Skipper kicks him, Lance hits a big powerbomb and covers to win. 4/10.

Live show

-Austin Aries and Roderick Strong vs. The Naturals: Decent opening tag match as these four worked well together, lots of good double team moves from both teams. Douglas and Stevens work over Aries, then Stevens hits a Shooting Star Press from the top to the outside. Austin ends up hitting an impressive dive through the first and second rope knocking Stevens out, then he and Strong take over with Roderick hitting some impressive backbreakers he's well known for. Nice closing moments with some nearfalls, Aries gets hit with the Natural Disaster and cover him to win. 7/10.

-X-Division 4-Way Match, Alex Shelley vs. Petey Williams vs. Matt Bentley w/Traci Brooks vs. Jay Lethal: Its the usual high spot match though there is some good wrestling between all four men, Shelley and Lethal to me shine in the match. Nice series of moves where each man breaks up a pinfall, including Bentley hitting a nice diving elbow while Jay had Alex in a German Suplex pin. There's some distraction after Jackie Gayda comes out and confronts Shelley, Lethal ends up rolling Petey up for the three. 7/10.

-Challenge Match, James Gang vs. The Latin American Exhange w/Konnan: After the break-up of the 3 Live Kru thanks to Konnan's jealousy, we have this match which is a fairly bland tag match as both Kip and B.G. (WWE's Billy Gunn & Road Dogg) were near the end of their careers at this time. There's the usual antics from the James Gang, Konnan attacks Kip on the outside behind the referee's back. Soon after B.G. hits the Pump Handle Slam and he covers to win. 3/10. Afterwards L.A.X. attacks both men, then B.G.'s dad Bullet Bob Armstrong comes out and Konnan leaves the ring.

-NWA World Tag Team Championship Match, America's Most Wanted (Champions) vs. Chris Sabin & Sonjay Dutt: The previous night on Impact Sabin had injured his ankle however that didn't stop him from giving his best effort to dethrone the tag champs. AMW both try to work on the ankle, before Dutt comes in hitting some good quick moves, then Chris comes in but soon Harris and Storm target and work on the injury for a few minutes. Sonjay is back in, hits some more quick moves, a chair is brought in, Sabin hits a DDT on Harris slamming his head into the chair but he doesn't stay down. Soon after AMW hits the Death Sentence and covers Dutt to retain the titles. 5/10.

-Falls Count Anywhere Match, Abyss w/James Mitchell vs. Rhyno: This was the third match in their rivalry and takes place shortly after Rhyno hit a massive Gore on Abyss, knocking him through the wall of the Impact Zone. It goes into the crowd, back in the ring, weapons are brought in like a kendo stick, trash can and a trophy and this is just an all out brawl.  Near the entrance ramp, Abyss sets up a few tables while Rhyno struggles to get back to his feet. The action spills outside the arena then back in, more tables are set up in the ring, Rhyno gets chokeslammed through a table but kicks out at 2. Of course the tacks are brought out, Rhyno Gores him through the table but only for two. In the crowd Rhyno Gores him off the rafters through the four tables, covers him and wins. 9/10.

-Triple Threat Match for the X-Division Championship, Samoa Joe (Champion) vs. AJ Styles vs. Christopher Daniels: Not as good as their Unbreakable 3-Way in Sept. of '05, however there was tension between all three as Daniels wanted to prove he didn't need AJ's help or sympathy (like at Final Resolution the previous month). It was a match full of intensity, tons of submission moves, Joe uses his strength and submission skills, nice trio of hold where each man tried to get the other to tap out. Great spot where Joe hits a big diving elbow sending both men to the ground, AJ and Daniels trade nearfalls, Joe comes back in hitting some big moves. Nice closing moments as the pace picks up, with each man trying so hard to get the three, however Joe knocks Daniels to the outside, then hits the Muscle Buster on Styles and covers to win. 9/10.

-Revenge Match, Team 3D vs. Team Canada w/Scott D'Amore: For months members of Team Canada had screwed over Brother Ray and Devon, so hence this match where 3D came out full of fire taking it to Bobby Roode and Eric Young slamming them on the outside for the opening minutes. 3D dominates for the first 5 minutes or so, before the Canadians take over on Devon busting him open. Ray gets the tag, throwing both men around and hitting a big superplex on Young off the top. After Roode accidentaly clotheslines Eric, they hit the 3D on Young and cover him to win. 7/10. Afterwards AMW hits the ring attacking 3D, grabs a table, but Ron Killings comes in and helps 3D put Eric through the table.

-NWA World Heavyweight Championship Match, Jeff Jarrett (Champion) w/Gail Kim vs. Christian Cage: The story going in here was could Christian realize his dream and capture a heavyweight championship, he had a ton of momentum coming into the match and all that was standing in his way was Jeff Jarrett. Also an underlying storyline during the match was would referee Earl Hebner call things down the middle or screw someone (remember Survivor Series '97?). It was a good match, where there was a lot of counter wrestling, a good pace was kept and Jarrett actually helped make Christian look good here and didn't bury him like he had other opponents in the past. Despite interference by Gail at ringside, Christian would not be denied, as he reversed the Stroke, hit the Unprettier for three to win the NWA title. 8/10.

As a PPV its not bad though besides a few matches its not really something you have to get on DVD. But seeing Christian get his just do at this point in his career is worth watching.",1342224000,,6700,4.535596026490066
8135026,4,B000GY73V4,"I've had lots of TNA laying around and bought more after watching the ones I had. This dvd shocked me with the great matches, I had no idea why I had not purchased it before. Well that is until the end of the main event.

Team 3-D VS James Gang: A great hardcore match. When TNA wrestlers go into the crowd to fight, I usually lose track and interest of what is happening. The camera man isn't very good at trackng the action. However, this match was very well done and I enjoyed it.

Rhino VS Bobby Roode @ Scott D'Amore: I'll agree they set up this match nicely but I don't care for any man in this one. D'Amore's last appearance on air for TNA, thank god he was friggin annoying.

Senshi VS Alex Shelly VS Shark Boy VS Sonjay Dutt VS Jay Lethal: I'm a little burned out on x-division wrestling. Yes, its better then most of the WWE but they always had x-division matches with multi-wrestlers and its hard to keep track of whats going on. Nothing wrong wrestling wise, just too many wrestlers.

Kevin Nash VS Chris Sabin: I'm a sucker for Nash. When ever I see a match of Nash on a dvd, i'll watch it. Nash is a decent worker but all his matches are the same. Now, he is older and slower. This match was decent but Alex Shelly comes out to help him thru out the whole match. It's the last time Nash would have brown hair as well, I believe.

AJ Styles @ Christopher Daniels VS AMW: I loved the tag team match between these two teams on a PPV before and this match is no expection. A hell of a good match and the ending was awesome. I miss Curry Man though.

Samoa Joe VS Scott Steiner: A decent match up. The ending sucked and was botched by Steiner.

Jeff Jarrett VS Sting VS The Truth VS Christian VS Abyss: The match was going fine and dandy. Lots of great action and I understood the rules clearer. Then as Sting and Christian were climbing the ladder, Earl Hebner pushed them over. Well, Larry Zybzko (wrong spell, I know) interfered but got laid out. Jarrett wins the match with help from a ref and Larry. Then Jim Cornette strips him of the title to end the show. It ruined what was a good main event and I remember why I didn't get this PPV. I don't remember if anything happened to Hebner but I could careless. A good main event ruined by trying to recreate Montreal ala 1997.

Overall, a damn good line up that delivers for the most part. The main event made me angry but other then that, it was good.",1239667200,,2413,4.207792207792208

1. Team 3D vs. The James Gang in a Bingo Hall Brawl- This I thought was a good way to kick off the show. Both these teams are veterans and have gooten older so I did think it was a good idea to put them in a hardcore like environment. This match had everything from chairs to tables and even bra's. This was an enterataing one. Good way to kick off the show. And a great crowd reaction. Winner Team 3D. Match Rating 6.5/10.
2. The War Machine Rhino vs. The Candian Enforcer bobby Roode and Coach D'Amore in a Handicap Revenge Match- They had a nice video for this one before the match started and I have to admit I was a little excited for this but I really felt that this did not live up to the hype. It seemed a little to slow for me and most of the match was controlled by team Canada. I have never really liked Handicap matches so that could be a reason. Winner Rhino. Match Rating 3/10.
3. Alex Shelly vs. Senshi vs. Shark Boy vs. Jay Lethal vs. Sonjay Dutt vs. Petey Williams in a X-Division Ranking Match- This was the first really good match of the night. This was a great match that was set up given a lot of time and showed why TNA is were they are today that's because of the X-Division. Great fast pace action in this match the eliminations were perfect and just some awesome action. Winner Senshi. Match Rating 8.5/10.
4. Chris Sabin vs. Big Sexy Kevin Nash- This was set up as a daivd vs. golith type of match. I like this to a certain extant and I think that sabin and nash could not have done a better job at nashes age and these two put on a semi entertaining match. Winner Big Sexy Kevin Nash. Match Rating 6/10.
5. Americas Most Wanted vs. The Phenomenal A.J. Styles and The Fallen Angle Christopher Danials for the NWA World Tag Team Titles- This was the match of the night in my opinion. Wow these two teams had been feuding for a while were gail kim had cost AJ and Danials numerous matches so this was there last chance. This had so much build to it and so much hype that you would never sit down for this match. This was a solid tag match for a while but than the last  7 minutes were non stop action near falls everywhere and just some great action. Great celebration after the match. Winners and new NWA World Tag Team Titles The Phenomenal A.J. Styles and The Fallen Angle Christopher Danials. Match Rating 10/10.
6. The Samoan Submission Machine Samoa Joe vs. Big Poppa Pump Scott Stiner- This also a lot of people were expecting to be bad because of stiners age but it lived up to the hype and the storyline this was awesome. A lot of people say this was the best Stiner has looked in years and he did look great. There was so much awesome technical wrestling a lot by Stiner and the suplexes. A great match and the only bad part was the ending. Winner The Samoan Submission Machine Samoa Joe. Match Rating 8.5/10.
7. Christian Cage vs. Sting vs. Jeff Jarrett vs. Abyss vs. Ron the truth Killings King of the Mountain Match for the NWA World Heavywieght Title- this was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. I had never seen a king of the mountain match before and I have to say that it is a unique match. I will say everyone here gave it there all espically Abyss who took a sick fall off the ladder and he crashed through 4 tables below the ring. The ending sucked but a great match overall. Winner and new NWA Champ Jeff Jarrett. Match Rating 7.5/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give TNA Slammiversary 2006 DVD a grade of 50/70 which is a 71% which means this is a awesome DVD. I think that is a good grade there are 3 really good matches on this DVD. Than we got a pretty good Main event so I would say if you can pick this up do it is worth it. If you can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate that. Thanks for your time.",1188086400,,3859,4.19811320754717
