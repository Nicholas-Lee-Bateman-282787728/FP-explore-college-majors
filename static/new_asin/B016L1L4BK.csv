8736674,5,B016L1L4BK,"Being a longtime fan of the Clevelanders Im not exactly an unbiased observer when I opine that I cant imagine these late Romantic orchestral masterworks performed any better.
Of course one can quibble about interpretative matters. What we hear in this compilation is a lighter, brighter Brahms with relatively brisk tempos, quite the contrast to the heavier, somber Brahms we encounter in the Herbert Von Karajan versions, or Wilhelm Furtwanglers dark, elemental readings.
The soloists in the concertos are first class, especially Julia Fischer in a sensitive performance of the mellifluous violin concerto. The DVD quality is visually sumptuous and likewise captures a full, lively sound quality. In sum, this is an exceptional collection, and much recommended.",1484265600,5,762,5.521367521367521
8736675,5,B016L1L4BK,"This cycle of Brahms Symphonies, Piano Concertos, and the Violin Concerto was recorded in 2014-2015, at Clevelands Severance Hall, Londons Royal Albert Hall, and Viennas Musikverein.  The works are played with the Cleveland Orchestras customary technical finish and clarity, but the interpretations will not be to everyones taste.

Welser-Mst tends toward brisker tempos  particularly in slow movements.  An example of this is the Andante and Grazioso sections of the Haydn Variations, performed rather breezily here, which gives the listener a new perspective in this oft heard work.  In this respect, and in his striving for transparent textures, Welser-Mst reminds me not so much of another conductor as of a pianist: Wilhelm Kempff.  Welser-Mst also eschews unmarked but traditional ritardandos and accelerandos - which will challenge some listeners preconceptions of how Brahms should be performed.  Yefim Bronfman contributes extroverted yet poetic renditions of the solo part of the two Piano Concertos, and Julia Fischers performance of the Violin Concerto emphasizes the contrasts between the bolder and more lyrical sections.  For both soloists, Welser-Msts accompaniment is hand-in-glove.

The camera work is more kinetic than was common in the old days, but seldom distracting.  One sees the appropriate performers at the appropriate times  and there are cutaway shots of the various venues.  One striking angle has the camera placed directly above the piano keyboard.

The sound quality is the major inconsistency in this set.  The performances taped at Severance sound much as they do in real life: transparent yet robust.  But the sound from Viennas Musikverein is disappointingly muddy and clotted, and the Albert Hall recordings sound a bit over resonant.",1483660800,12,1772,5.559701492537314

8736677,2,B016L1L4BK,"I've never heard the opening of 3 sound like that of 4, but FWM gets his orchestra to play down the power and treat those opening chords as something to be caressed. The rest of the movement is just as breezy and superficial. FWM gestures like he want's something dramatic to happen and all you get is a burble. Is there a tradition of playing this this way in Cleveland? No- Dohnanyi, Maazel and Szell all deliver the goods with the same orchestra- they sound like giants by comparison- magnificent, all three. It's just sick that this is what Cleveland amounts to these days.",1464998400,10,577,4.5576923076923075
8736678,5,B016L1L4BK,"This is a superlative set of performances of the great orchestral works of Brahms. The Cleveland Orchestra is in extraordinary form under the baton of its conductor Franz Welser-Most, and the soloists, violinist Julia Fischer and pianist Yefim Bronfman, deliver exciting performances of the Brahms concerti. My only slight disappointment is that the double concerto was not included. Highly recommended.",1458172800,7,403,5.733333333333333
8736679,5,B016L1L4BK,"The blu-ray I received is region 0 (all regions / not restricted to a region) not region 2.

The audio and video and excellent.
The performances may not be the absolute greatest in all cases (there is a lot of competition), but they are consistently very good and at times great.",1452988800,9,279,4.470588235294118
