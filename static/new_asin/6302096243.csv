Some might criticize the director's choice of deletions, but remember that the original text of  Shakespeare plays were events to spend an entire day listening to. Mel  Gibson lends his trademark manic on-screen pesonality to the perfect role,  that of the Danish prince who is both saddened and outraged about his  father's death.

421409,4,6302096243,"A superb rendering of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet."" I watched it with a friend, & we'd read Isaac Asimov's remarks & then watch part of the play & continued through the whole play that way. So it was not difficult to follow. The one thing I don't like about this version is the hint of incest between Hamlet (Mel Gibson) & his mother (Glenn Close).

421477,4,6302096243,"Whenever I think about shakspear, firt thing came out of my mind is Orson Wells. And then kenneth branagh.
Their movies are so great making shakspear's work into film. I still think Orson Wells' OTHELLO is the best Shakspear's  film that ever made.
Kenneth's HENRY V is also great work too.
But when it comes to HAMLET made by Franco Zeffirelli, I have a little doubt.
Mel Gibson's acting has something missing. Maybe because of his previous image.
Glenn Close and Helena Bonham Carter ar more then perfect and there is no doubt about it.
Except the ending theme, Ennio Morricone's music score is not that powerful which is also a little dissaponted since i like his music so much.
The movie contains so many monologue and I know that original script has that much monologue but mostly Mel Gibson's molologue is very boring.
I think it's Mel's fault. And maybe the director's fault too. Maybe the framing perhaps.
The moment when Hamlet's father appears was very powerful and it really made the movie shined. Although we did know that it's gonna happen.
The ending was very sad and that was even more sad because of the ending theme composed by Ennio Morricone.
I wouldn't say this movie is a failure.
It is a well made film.
But I wouldn't say it's an instant classic because of Mel Gilson.",1453939200,,1291,4.637554585152839

421564,4,6302096243,"when i first saw this Hamlet back in 1990 i remember not liking it .

but in 2015 , 25 years later i really liked the film . Gibson has brought to life a Hamlet different then seen before .

not at all like Olivia but a real person with courage , a quick and funny wit , very atlethic , charming and well a real interpetation of a person

undergoing what has happened to him .

the King and Queen and Polonius are only marginally effective . But the rest of the cast are realistic .

For the time frame of the film certain scenes are left out and those themes are absent from the film and faithful to the Directors vision .

speaking of visions the atmosphere is quite good . And i believe faithful to a realistic version of Shakespeares Brilliant Play!!!

but the sword fight at the end is too comical and destroys the power of Shakespeares Dramatic Ending which is a shame . But as i said before it had to be that way because key ideas and scenes were left out .

421622,5,6302096243,"Not everyone's cup of tea.
Zeferelli takes great liberties with the play, omitting vast swaths of dialogue, several scenes, and the character of Fortinbras altogether. He also rearranges the order of several critical scenes, and makes mighty interpretive leaps such as having Hamlet overhear Polonius's instructions to Ophelia that she must not have any further contact with the prince--an understanding that of course colors our view of Hamlet's actions toward Ophelia for the rest of the play. Knowing that Hamlet KNOWS the poor girl is in a hopeless position, acting under her father's direct orders, makes his treatment of her seem wantonly cruel as the play moves forward, rather than justifiable as a manifestation of his paranoia. One failure of this interpretation is that Zeferelli doesn't do much with that knowledge--Hamlet's having overheard Polonius--once having established it. He seems to go on courting our sympathy for the character as if he'd done nothing to lessen it.
On the other hand, the director does deliver a film just over two hours long--compared to Kenneth Branagh's four-hour-plus rendition--that is well-acted, properly atmospheric, successful at differentiating critical passages and performances from those which are meant merely to flesh out the plot, and relaxed enough en route that the necessarily intense scenes stand out as they should. (Branagh's version, while great in its own way, is acted by every character in every scene as if he or she were the MAIN character, and the scene itself the very climax of the play--a greater gathering of famous hams, each determined to make the most of his moment in the sun, has rarely graced the silver screen, if ever. Every one of the performances is marvelous--but taken as a whole, the play is exhausting.)
My students tend to prefer Zeferelli's film over Branagh's--but add the reservation that if they hadn't already known the play, they probably wouldn't have understood this one as a stand-alone drama. Some of the aforementioned liberties with the play leave holes in the plot--the viewer familiar with the play is kind enough to fill them in, but Branagh's version doesn't require such helpfulness.",1433548800,3,2187,5.233618233618234

421624,4,6302096243,"Having been a fan and scholar of the play since high school, I would like to give this version props as true to the spirit and emotion of the original work.  I also really like the fact that it appears to be set close to original historical time period of the play.  Glen Close is a wonderful Gertrude (a part that is often discounted) and even Helena Bonham-Carter, overused in historical films, does well as Ophelia.  Beautiful cinematography, as one would expect from Zeffirelli.  The dank castle setting suits the play, as do the exteriors.  My biggest gripes are (as mentioned in an earlier review) the missing Fortinbras plot and all the cut lines in general.  Shakespeare's rich verse adds so many layers that it's a shame to take a scissors to it.  I wish this had been the ""uncut"" Hamlet, rather than Branagh's.  Whatever we may think of Gibson personally, I find his performance far superior to Branagh's, which is pretty much manic and tiresome throughout.",1433203200,,967,4.748502994011976

421627,3,6302096243,"I use three different versions of Hamlet to support my teaching of the play with h.s. seniors. I wish there was a single version of the play that stood on it's own from start to finish. Unfortunately, providing good visuals requires jumping around. For example, the Branagh version does an excellent job with the last two scenes in Act I because it dramatizes the story the ghost tells Hamlet. On the other hand, the version on PBS with David Tennant is quite good during Act III, but the actress playing Ophelia is not as effective as the actresses playing the role in the versions with Gibson or Branagh.
For me, the main problem with this version is that Gibson just seems too old. (I felt this way about him in Braveheart as well, so it just might be me and my personal reaction to close-ups of his face). On the flip side, his crazy is pretty hilarious and teenagers respond to it. He's right on point in Act II. Subsequently, I bought this film specifically to show a visualization of Act II.  Act 2.1 works because the story Ophelia tells Polonius is acted out. Gibson looks like he's doing a parody of a maniacal person and as I said above, my teenaged students love it. The play within a play scene isn't bad either.
If you're buying it to augment your teaching, caveat emptor: It's out of order. If you want a version that follows the script as it's written, you'll need to look at other versions to meet your objectives.

421656,4,6302096243,"Franco Zeffirellis 1990 Hamlet makes for a pretty useful introductory run-through of the main themes and ideas of the play.  At two-and-a-quarter hours compared to Kenneth Branaghs four, its severely cut, but surprisingly (at least to me), Mel Gibson gets closer to the feel of the character (at least as I understand him) than Branagh does, even if he doesnt necessarily act as well.  (I might add that Zeffirelli seems to have a much better grasp of the material than Branagh does.)  Gibson comes across as intelligent and sensitive, though he emotes a bit too obviously, spending too much time with a single bewildered look in his eyes.  Overall, though, the lines are very well read, and the film feels vivid and vital; though as always, the Americans cant really hold their own next to the British actors.  Helena Bonham Carter at 20, as Ophelia, runs rings around Glenn Close at 43, as Gertrude, though she may be a bit too strong a personality for fragile Ophelia; and Gibson cant really compare either.  Bonham Carter arguably gives the best performance in the movie, though I think that  arguably  Kate Winslet, in Branaghs film, is more convincing in the mad scenes.

The film is similar to Zeffirellis Romeo and Juliet in many ways:  its gorgeous to look at, without undermining the play, and the sets have a very authentic feel; its clearly structured and very judiciously cut; and the main themes and plots mostly survive the cutting.  And since Zeffirelli doesn't have any underage girls to cast here, there are no serious casting concerns.  Having said that, the cuts do make the film feel somewhat choppy; and though all the famous speeches are there, they feel a little crammed together in the shortened running time; at times it feels a little like a highlights reel.",1428019200,,1785,4.8355263157894735
421657,5,6302096243,"When I first saw this film I was transfixed.  It was my first amazing experience with Shakespeare on film.  With the revelations that Mel Gibson is a manic jerk in real life, I am not a fan of him in general, but I once was.  Even with my revised negative opinion, this is an incredible film.  I still appreciate the talent that Mel Gibson brings to his movies.  This is by far his best performance.  Watching the extras (which I rarely do) it is obvious that he worked with manic dedication to make Hamlet a person deeper than the words.  I am going to be a heretic now: I find his performance far superior to that of Sir Laurence Olivet and Kenneth Branagh.  Franco Zeffirelli is a master director.  All of the performances are masterful.  The costumes and sets are amazing.  This adaptation of Hamlet is tight and short.  It focuses on the psychology and personality of Hamlet and his family and personal relationships at the expense of the politics and over a third of the play.  I am frustrated with much of Kenneth Branagh's complete version of Hamlet, but if you want to see the full the play it is essential.  If you want to see the most realistic, personal and compelling version this is the one to watch.  Ian Holm and Glenn Close, Helena Bonham Carter are amazing.  I am not aware of one performance that is not excellent.  I have watched this film about six times.  It gets better each time.",1427846400,2,1403,4.456692913385827

421770,5,6302096243,"Although I don't agree with the Freudian overtones in this production, I think that Mel Gibson performed his part extremely well.  I loved the way he was always lurking around corners, seeing and hearing the others plotting.  And of course I loved hearing and watching Paul Schofield (not certain if his last name is spelled correctly here)  as his father's ghost..  They all were great in playing their parts!  Great cast!",1405209600,,423,4.901408450704225

421773,5,6302096243,"While Gibson has gone a bit looney in recent history, some of his movies are amazing.  This showing of Hamlet is great.  If you are a lover of Hamlet, I would also recommend you check out ""Rosencranz and Gildenstern Are Dead,"" a charming, off-beat side story look at the clueless servants who meet untimely ends (much to their own puzzlement).  The two movies together give a much fuller look at the ruthless, surreal, and wacky world of Hamlet.",1404259200,,445,4.67948717948718
421804,5,6302096243,"I would not show the whole film. Students get grossed out by the scene between Hamlet and his mother, but it is worth buying to show the famous monologues and scenes.  Gibson and Helen Bonham Carter do a great job and students are familiar with them.",1402531200,,250,4.434782608695652
421805,3,6302096243,"The director plays with the sequence of the play, taking part of a scene from later on in the play and using it as a funeral scene at the beginning of the movie.  That part was innovative, the rest leaves a bit to be desired.  The acting can be hammy (notice the pun) at times.  I kind of wish that they had tried to make the dialogue a little non-Shakespearean, and by that I mean cut out some of the superfluous lines and spice up the delivery so that it seems more modern.

And then on the opposite end of things, the bedroom scene is almost laughable.  The director takes the whole Oedipus complex to an extreme that destroys any subtlety in the relationship between the two characters.

I believe the challenge of making a Shakespearean play into a movie is combining the strengths of both media in a way that retains the originality of the work while appealing to a modern audience.  The material is there, the dialogue needed to be delivered in a way that seemed more modern.  The use of scene changes could have been better.  And Mel Gibson, to me, seemed too old to be playing Hamlet.  It's not bad, but it's nothing outstanding either.",1402531200,,1145,4.435406698564593
421806,4,6302096243,"I am a high school English teacher and I show this movie when we study the play.  It is fairly short and a decent adaptation.  My main issue is the overtly Oedipal interpretation of the relationship between Hamlet and Gertrude, but since it always shocks and freaks out my students, it makes for a good discussion after we watch it.",1401753600,,332,4.516666666666667

421809,5,6302096243,"Who would think that crazy guy Mel Gibson of Mad Max and Lethal Weapon could pull off Hamlet -- but he does! Hamlet is, after all, a little mad himself so it works. This all star cast steps up to the plate as well. I've watched it at least 5 times and always find something new in it. My only criticism is that Mel Gibson and Glen Close are a little too close in age to be mother/son.",1398470400,,384,3.9358974358974357
421810,5,6302096243,"I did not know this movie was made until I searched for Hamlet to help my teenager with a class assignment. I watched it first and I was presently surprised about the quality, though I should have figured Mel Gibson would be great as an emotionally disturbed Hamlet.

Still, my teenager is too lazy to watch this and prefers to wallow in ignorance. If you have someone who seeks to appreciate this great play, this is a very good way.

You may have better luck with your teenager; I should have forbidden this movie so my son would have watched it...",1394928000,,550,4.435643564356436

The scenes and lines are also not in correct order.  And the Closet scene between Hamlet & his mother has VERY heavy Oedipal overtones.",1394236800,,292,5.041666666666667
421813,5,6302096243,I think this edition is wonderful for teachers of Shakespeare.  It allows students who are used to visual stories to access all of the intricacies of the most complex play that the world has ever seen.,1393459200,,201,4.583333333333333
421834,4,6302096243,"I will say that purists will probably not enjoy this version.  A lot of the lines, scenes, and even entire story lines are changed or omitted, but I have to say I liked it.  For one thing it was shorter (although Hamlet would have chastised me--for several pages--for such a sentiment given his reaction to Polonius's assertion that the lead player's speech is too long).  I will say the Freudian theme (while having already been suggested by Barrymore and Olivier) was a little too much for me.",1392940800,,495,4.666666666666667

421837,5,6302096243,I have not received the movie yet but I have seen it. I liked it enough to buy it. It is Mel at his finest. I am not a scholar of Shakespeare so for me it was a good introduction. Glenn Close is marvelous also!! My kids even liked it and actually started thinking about the plot and asking questions. I thought it was a good way to get them interested in Shakespeare. We could all do with more culture in our lives.,1390608000,,415,4.0120481927710845
421838,5,6302096243,"Although this movie has received fair, and in some cases, somewhat overzealous feedback, I love it... I admit that I may be biased since I watched this movie from a very young age as something of a tradition. But I simply love watching this movie. Mel Gibson displays a very believable image of Hamlet, the way I consider him to be. A confused, angry man, who is to be pitied for all that he has lost, and all that he comes to lose. And very sad. He does not display the level of anger that Kenneth Branagh did, and in my opinion this is good. In Kenneth's version, the entire movie had a very surreal feel to it, where this one was more of what you would expect in your typical 'not really very accurate but looks great for a period piece' movie. Definitely worth a watch, if you've never seen it. Considering the price you can get it for here, even if you don't like it, you're not out more than a Theater ticket, if that.",1389830400,2,924,4.2259887005649714
421839,5,6302096243,I ordered this DVD to replacde the VCR version that I had.  I finally had to throw the old version away.  Students still respond positively to this version of Hamlet.,1389657600,,166,4.5
421840,5,6302096243,"Mel Gibson as Hamlet?  Most peopel wouldn't buy this idea at all but he's amazing!  Glenn Close is phenominal as well!  Helena Bonham Carter was born to play Ophelia.  My favoriter Shakespeare story, don't perfectly!",1389657600,,216,5.085714285714285
421841,5,6302096243,Such a great movie. Mel Gibson is phenomenal as Hamlet and plays the part with ownership. I would definitely recommend it.,1389312000,,122,4.857142857142857
421842,5,6302096243,I would not have known what a good movie this is had I not been asked to review it in my college English class.  Mel Gibson and Glen Close are superb!,1388102400,,150,3.838709677419355
421843,5,6302096243,"Hamlet is the best play every written.  Every actor wants to play Hamlet-to show his Range.  Mel Gibson does a very good job of playing Hamlet.  He is physical when it is right to be physical, brutal at times, and most important of all, not moved when he kills someone in this play.  Indeed, the most dangerous position a character can be in in this play is as someone who really cares about Hamlet.  They almost all die, killed by a Hamlet who listens to a ghost.  This is one of the better of many versions of Hamlet on DVD.",1387411200,,526,4.21
421864,5,6302096243,"Though it's Shakespeare's original words, the acting and location drive home the drama if the words fail your ears. A must see for anyone intimidated by this author.",1387411200,,165,4.928571428571429
421865,4,6302096243,"Yes, this production is full of problems. Yes, it is hard to take Mel Gibson seriously anymore. However, after teaching Hamlet for years, I still find this version the most accessible for Seniors. It is short enough to not bore them to death and Mel Gibson physical acting really connects with students. Glenn Close's Gertrude is amazing. I show this first and them compare it to other versions.",1387324800,,395,4.823529411764706
421866,4,6302096243,"Strange to say, Mel Gibson as Hamlet comes off better than you may thing.  You have to like Shakespearean tragedies.  If you do, this version has some elements you don't see in other versions.  The principle thing to watch is the relationship between Hamlet and his mother, the queen..  Well done period piece.",1386720000,,310,4.7924528301886795
421867,5,6302096243,you may not like the Gibson in this day and age and e-mail always been a way he was but this is the best rendition of Hamlet that I have ever seen even for going the age differences and the actors that play the characters if you like your. Pieces to be as gritty as the. It was meant to be played in then this is a good movie. At a time when Kenneth Branagh was taking Shakespeare out of the boring and into the light of the movie screen Mel Gibson beat him to Hamlet using some of the own actors that Kenneth Branagh used himself in his own movies. Most likely making Kenneth a little jealous for only a year or so later he came out with his own version of Hamlet in a overly glitzy version as not to match this darker version which I do not think the play was intended to be as shiny as Kenneth made his Hamlet also I found his Hamlet to be much more boring even though his Hamlet was probably more unabridged then this version. I doubt this is the version that they use in schools since Mel Gibson let his feelings be known or whatever he was going through reacted the way he did but it was probably the version they showed before his outbreak,1386547200,,1146,4.075221238938053
421868,5,6302096243,"This is maybe one of my favorite works by Mel Gibson. Many people didn't consider him a serious actor until he did this movie. It arrived quickly, in perfect shape.",1386374400,,164,4.5
421869,4,6302096243,"In most movie adaptations of Shakespeares plays, it is necessary to cut some scenes or entire subplots. And this is a great challenge for the directors, who have to decide which parts to be cut and what parts to be invented. The problem is that Shakespeares plays are incredibly precise; there are no scenes and no episodes that are not needed.

In the case of Hamlet it is necessary to recognize that the play is the sequel to Measure for Measure. The events that led to the current situation in Elsinore are presented in The Murder of Gonzago, i.e., the play-within-the play presented by a travelling troupe of actors. Upon Hamlets request, the actors staged The Murder of Gonzago, which supposedly was based on the story he heard from the Ghost. In this story the murderer of the king married the kings wife.

The actors, however, presented their own adaptation of The Murder of Gonzago. They included the Ghosts story as dumb show, i.e., in the first episode of their performance. And then they added the second episode that took place in Vienna after the conclusion of Measure for Measure. The second episode illustrates the story of the Duke of Vienna, i.e., the events that took place prior to the murder in Elsinore. The Duke of Vienna is presented as a sick and elderly man. The Dukes wife, Baptista, is devotedly attached to her husband. There is no indication that she is deceiving him. The audience will recognize that Gonzago and Baptista represent Duke Vincentio and Isabella 30 years after the conclusion of Measure for Measure. Lucianus, the Dukes nephew, is the murderer. Lucianus represents Hamlets father.
However, the players are not able to finish their story, because irritated Hamlet disturbs the performance. He abruptly interrupts the performance by delivering his own line:

you shall see anon how the murderer
gets the love of Gonzagos wife.

This is not the Dukes killers line. This line belongs to the murderer in the first episode of The Murder of Gonzago. Hamlets interruption does not allow the actors to finish the second episode.

In Zeffirellis production the first episode of The Murder of Gonzago, i.e., the dumb show is cut off. And this makes impossible for the audience to figure out what is going on. As long as the audience does not realize that Hamlets father was a murderer, so long the Hamlets story will remain incomprehensible.",1386288000,,2374,4.866336633663367
421870,5,6302096243,While Shakespeare is not my favorite subject I still have to teach the subject to my students having mild-to-moderate disabilities.  Using movies such as this one helps my students to see and hear Shakespeare in the light that it was intended to be seen and heard.  To have my high school students reading at a 2nd-5th grade level read Shakespeare would have been complete torture!,1385856000,,381,4.846153846153846
421871,5,6302096243,Love Shakespeare. Hamlet is my favorite.  Mel Gibson portrayed a believable Hamlet without the over acting others of many others. An enjoyable relief,1385769600,,149,5.478260869565218
421872,4,6302096243,"Two reasons for buying this version: it was directed by Franco Zeffirelli, one of my theatrical heroes (director/designer), and it features some excellent performances by some fine actors, including that of Mel Gibson, who has since weirded out.  Zeffirelli had an uncanny ability to cast very well.  As a theater director myself, I can affirm that the single most important decision any director has to make is casting the exact right person in each role--the rest is easy.  It's a little strange to have Gertrude played by Glenn Close who was actually younger than Mel when this film was made, but it sort of works.  The best ""Hamlet"" on film, in my opinion, is Kenneth Branagh's definitive version.",1385683200,,701,4.915254237288136

421900,5,6302096243,"Mel Gibson's version of Hamlet is spot on. There are a lot of one star reviews here, but please read them closely. They are not complaining about Gibson's adaptation of the play, but the poor quality of the physical product. Gibson understands the complexity of Hamlet, and his struggle to find justice for his father's tortured soul. This is no small task for the grief stricken scholar. Though tormented by Claudius, his mother, and his Ophelia, Hamlet remains single minded in his quest to set things right. Gibson does not portray Hamlet as a puny coward, stuck vacillating in indecision. This Hamlet rises to the occasion and strikes his villain dead. Yes, he dies too, but then ""flights of angels sing thee [Hamelt] to ... rest."" For some, the action is delayed too long. But Hamlet is precise in his actions, and Mel Gibson does not treat the subject lightly.",1382486400,2,866,4.78
421901,2,6302096243,"This is a sharply cut Hamlet with subplots removed and an invented opening scene. Mel Gibson is an acceptable if undistinguished Hamlet, with some good supporting performances.

421903,5,6302096243,I absolutely love Gibson's rendition of Hamlet.  I believe I've seen all that made it to the big screen.  Gibson IS Hamlet!  He draws us in and we experience the character like never before.  It's a MUST HAVE for any collection.,1381190400,,228,4.487804878048781
421904,4,6302096243,"This was a smart adaptation of Hamlet. Gibson brings the character to life in a very multi-faceted performance. The rest of the case is great as well. I think what also made this work was that the director knew what to cut to give the essence of the play to film without some of the extraneous elements. Yes, Fortenbras is gone and we don't see as much extra chasing around of the ghost, but all the great parts of Hamlet are there. Just a fine film version.",1380499200,,458,4.275862068965517

421906,5,6302096243,"This version of Hamlet is short and fast paced. It has plenty of energy and Mel Gibson is a convincing Hamlet. The balances of the cast are top-notch actors and are in excellent form. There is enough of the story to give cohesion. There are no stories or plays that could not stand a little reinterpreting. But some times this leave out the feel. Mel actually put more feel back in to the original intent. So do not compare while watching. And watch it a gain.

The story takes place in Denmark. Hamlet the prince is informed by the ghost of his father that his mother and uncle were responsible for his father's death. His mother and his uncle get married before the funeral meat is cold. How will Hamlet deal with the situation and what effect will it have on others around him?

421938,4,6302096243,"I prefer reading Shakespeare to seeing it on stage or in movies, mostly because so many stage productions and movie are so deplorable.  This is an exception, and a surprising one, since I figured the part of Hamlet would be too much of a stretch for The Mel, but in fact he does fine by the role, certainly much more watchable than Laurence Olivier's overrated (and frankly boring) 1948 movie version.  One beef is that he and Glenn Close are way too close (sorry!) in age to be playing son and mother (couldn't they have solved that with makeup?), but she does fine as the somewhat befuddled Gertrude, and Alan Bates is fine as Hamlet's murderous uncle Claudius.  (Bates, as he got into middle age, ceased exposing his arse in films - good!)

Franco Zefirelli did some lush color movies of Romeo and Juliet and Taming of the Shrew. Here his color is a little more restrained (would anyone expect lavish color in medieval Denmark?), but suits the story perfectly.  And, considering he's Italian, he does well with his mixed cast of Brits and Americans.

After this movie's release, Kenneth Branagh came out with his version, when he filmed the FULL (meaning LONG) version of Hamlet, and I simply never made it through that version.  Shakespeare has almost always been cut for stage or film versions, and rightly so, because even the greatest writer of all time needed some judicious ""pruning"" here and there, and cuts usually make for a more comfortable running time as well as eliminating some non-essential scenes and speeches.  Zeffirelli's version is just about perfect (probably just one bathroom break for any viewer over 40).  Acting by the whole cast is fine, costumes and sets and photography have the usual Zeffirelli high quality, and one of the treasures of English literature gets the treatment it deserves.",1372809600,5,1820,4.84516129032258

Mel Gibson conveys the unutterable loneliness, as well as the rage of Hamlet - that tragic hero of never ending deliberation. 'Hamlet' is ultimately about self-birthing pains to become what one is, and this production convays this thought.
Far too many contemporary (ultimately mediocre) directors try to `improve' on this 'play of plays', while Zeffirelli remains faithful to its spirit and deeply respectful of Shakespeare.
I saw this film more than 20 years ago, and then again quite recently. It has only risen in my estimation on second viewing.",1334707200,,756,5.204918032786885
422125,5,6302096243,Well done.  Nice interviews with actors and directors in special features.  I definitely recommend this movie version of the play.,1330646400,,130,5.45
422126,2,6302096243,"I really wanted to like this because I like Mel Gibson and I like Hamlet. Unfortunately, I have seen all the Hamlets and this is, in my opinion, the 2nd worst. Here's why: First and very quickly, what I like about this production is that it has the best location shots of any of the Hamlet productions, but it turns out location is decidedly not everything when it comes to pulling off a good Shakespeare play. I had a long list of pros and cons, but the whole problem can be whittled down to simply not being able to suspend disbelief and accept that Mel Gibson is Hamlet. I don't want to criticize his accent or acting because [in the right roles] Mel is a great actor. I *LOVE* Mel Gibson when he is shooting people up in Lethal Weapon or Edge of Darkness, but not for Hamlet. The whole time I kept thinking, ""Mel Gibson, Mel Gibson, Mel Gibson, etc..."" instead of ""Hamlet, Hamlet, Hamlet."" Here's the problem: We love Mel Gibson because he *always* plays the same character--himself! I don't mean that as a negative trait because it's fine when we're toasting our brain over the fire on a cold night and wolfing down cheap pizza and beer while cheering along during another Hollywood FX extravaganza. We do the same thing with Bruce Willis, another guy who, regardless of his talent, should *never* act in a Shakespearean play. Perhaps the litmus test for disqualification should be this: If you have ever been filmed being thrown through the window of an LA skyscraper...and had your character live to tell about it...you are not allowed to act in a Shakespearean play!

The other problem is that I cannot figure out which ""Hamlet"" Mel Gibson is performing. His lines don't match the standard play editions. I know I'm using the wrong words here but I'm not a specialist. I think the correct word is ""quarto"" or something, and there is a lot of controversy over which is the ""definitive"" quarto...or something. Whatever the case, I don't think this Mel Gibson interpretation is the right one. I try to follow along with what is being said using either the Signet or Oxford editions of the plays and this version of Hamlet jumps all over the place. That isn't quite a fair criticism, because so far, none of the televised versions of the plays accord exactly to the text, but this one is particularly egregious.

Sorry Mel: you rock, but this one just didn't work out buddy.

Peace,
Mike

In summary, given how many editions there are of this play, I would recommend going with a more ""classic"" performance, by which I mean, simply, to find one with old British actors. I'm an American, but Shakespeare just sounds better performed by someone with a real English accent and especially by someone who we've seen perform in other Shakespeare stage productions. My personal favorite is the BBC Television production...it's free to stream on Amazon if you have Prime (the one with Derek Jacobi as Hamlet).  For a definitive albeit non-televised version of the plays, find the Arkangel Shakespeare audio CD's. They cost a fortune, so rent them from a library unless you're rich. Get the Signet editions of the plays to follow along, or use 'ShakespearesWords' which is a free online resource I found that has an interactive cross-referencing dictionary/glossary along with full texts of the plays.",1329436800,4,3296,4.7452006980802794
422127,5,6302096243,"No murky Hamlet here.  The film version is one-half the time the play normally takes, yet is well paced, the vital lines kept, and the diction clear and excellent.  What makes or kills a filming of Shakespeare is the pacing of the lines, and whether you can hear the actors well.  For the play's the thing, and the words are the play.  Miss the words and you may as well not watch.  The other big problem with Shakespeare films: they tend to be too theatrical, which makes the words wooden, sterilizes the plot.  That problem is avoided, here.  Here we see Hamlet traditional, even curtailed: yet lively, real.  Good momentum, not tedium.  You identify with the characters, even if you know the lines by heart.  The play lives, inspires.

Gibson captures the unstable elements of Hamlet's character I've not seen in other versions, and his interpretation is among my favorites.  The other actors are perfect in their roles, rightly legendary.  Clean.  Pure.  Well-nuanced without gimmicks.

The DVD special features are two, both about playing Hamlet and making the film;  the second one is quite long, and mesmerizing.  Well worth watching, remarkably and wonderfully candid, even self-critical.  Wish more DVDs had this kind of introspective explanation about film-making.

422130,5,6302096243,"This is an abridged version of the play, but that fact does not interfere with enjoyment of the film.  In my opinion, the only thing wrong with Shakespeare's original version of this play is that the play is too long.  This film solves that problem.  With reference to the performances, I must say that the acting is outstanding--never overdone, and never lacking in enthusiasm.  The other advantage that this film has over a live theatrical performance is the fact that the settings are realistic--by that I mean that it's filmed on location, with a real castle, real trees, and a real hole in the ground out of which a skull is produced--you get the idea.  I like Shakespeare on film when it's filmed using a real set--it adds a fresh new dimension in which to appreciate the story.  I can't say anything bad about this film.

422167,5,6302096243,"Well, I just read ""Hamlet"" and I must say: no one really needs Fortinbras. This version of ""Hamlet""-- directed by Franco Zeffirelli and starring Helena Bonham Carter as Ophelia-- is head and shoulders above Kenneth Branagh's pompous, pretentious, self-indulgent four-hour take on the classic. Zeffirelli sticks to what matters most in the story, including (obviously) Hamlet's revenge saga, Ophelia's not-so-happy journey, and a very touching take on the philosophical subtext. The movie is set in gorgeous medieval locations (unlike Branagh's overly bright and opulent 19th-century sets) and employs a dandy music score by the legendary Ennio Morricone (""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly""). This version draws a lot of criticism from people who have either never seen it or are the disciples of Branagh. Mel Gibson's performance is not a masterpiece, but it is pretty far ahead of most of his other work both as an actor and director. Helena Bonham Carter gives the performance of a lifetime, though, and Glenn Close (Gertrude), Alan Bates (Claudius), and Paul Scofield (the Ghost) are superb. Though it leaves out a lot of the text, it's still the definitive modern or nearly-modern film of ""Hamlet."" (I've never seen the Olivier version, but I would like to.) This is mainly because its adaptation does not mistake content or quantity for quality, and everything in the movie makes perfect artistic, dramatic, literary, and cinematic sense.",1306108800,2,1441,5.242424242424242

422171,3,6302096243,"Overall, the acting is pretty good (and not quite as over-the-top as in the Branagh adaptation). Also, unlike the Branagh adaptation, this film is shown in its time-appropriate setting. However, in this film, Fortinbras and all references to Norway are excluded. In fact, this 1991 film condenses the play considerably (almost by 1/2). In my opinion, eliminating the Fortinbras subplot was particularly disappointing, even though one can understand the reasons for doing so.

Below, I have listed most of the changes (as well as some other staging comments). [What follows assumes a considerable understanding of the text of Shakespeare's Hamlet.]

Act 1, Scene 1 is excluded.
- Film begins with Hamlet's father being laid to rest in the crypt, with Gertrude crying over King Hamlet's body.

Act 1, Scene 2 is considerably condensed.

Act 1, Scene 3 is slightly condensed.
- In the conversation between Polonius and Laertes, Polonius speaks only the most a few of the most famous lines such as ""to thine own self be true.""
- When Polonius tells Ophelia not to speak with Hamlet, Hamlet overhears the conversation.

Act 1, Scene 4 is slightly condensed.

Act 1, Scene 5 is slightly condensed.
- Hamlet actually appears somewhat afraid of his father's ghost.
- Hamlet speaks with his father's ghost on the battlements of the castle.
- Hamlet only insists that Horatio and Marcellus swear on his sword 1 time.

Act 2, Scene 1 is excluded.

Act 2, Scene 2 begins around line 80 and is slightly condensed.
- When Polonius talks with Hamlet, Hamlet, in his madness, has one shoe on and one shoe off.

After Act 2, Scene 2 line 215, adaptation shifts to Act 3, Scene 1, which is slightly condensed.
- Hamlet, when he meets with Ophelia in the lobby, spies the shadows of someone. Hamlet assumes that he is being spied upon and begins speaking louder to insure that those spying on him hear him.
- Hamlet grabs Ophelia's face rather violently when he accuses her of using cosmetics.
- Hamlet speaks his ""to be or not to be"" speech alone in the crypt near his father's coffin after his meeting with Ophelia. [In other words, Ophelia, Claudius, and Polonius do not hear Hamlet's ""to be or not to be"" speech.]

Act 2, Scene 2, after line 215 is slightly condensed until line 305, at which point the scene is greatly condensed.
- Hamlet behaves violently toward R & G when R & G remain silent after Hamlet asks them whether the King or Queen sent for them.
- Hamlet does not learn the players have been displaced by a younger troop.
- The players do not present speech to Hamlet at lines 448 to 498.
- Hamlet's ""O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I"" speech is considerably condensed.

Act 3, Scene 2 is considerably condensed.
- Hamlet does not tell the players not to overact.
- Male actors play the female roles.
- Many of the less important lines of dialogue are cut from the play within the play.
- Claudius is very distraught and disoriented after he witnesses the poisoning in the play within the play.
- Hamlet forces the flute up against [G's] neck when he accuses R & G or trying to play him like a flute.
- Lines 342 and after are eliminated (i.e. Polonius does not appear telling Hamlet to see his mother).

Act 3, Scene 3 is considerably condensed.
- First 70 lines are excluded.
- Most of Claudius' lines as he prays are excluded.

422172,5,6302096243,"When you think of Mel Gibson's career, it is a traverse across infinities of violence.  Even his comic, antic cop movies are motivated by violence.  Nobody can deny that the heart-sickening violence of the Passion of Christ was the the scene of the flogging of Christ by drunken centurions.  Where better to start one's voyage than in Hamlet?

Since this is a young Gibson, you can see where he began his trademarked looks.  He looks off camera one way while his eyes shift to the other to communicate anxiety, or double think.  We have seen this in many of his movies.  He communicates the opposite meaning through his roughing Ophelia up while he smiles.  Gibson's heart is that of a narcissist player, but here, in his youth, he carries it off.

Glenn Close is a wonderful Gertrude.  Gibson matches well with her, because she is the best Gertrude I have ever seen.

The Polonius character is underplayed, which is unfortunate.  He is a slimier character than shown here.

His daughter, Ophelia, played by Hellen Bonham Carter, is as magnificient as is Glenn Close.  She is the only Ophelia I have seen where I truly believed she was going crazy in grief.

This is a fantastic film production of one of the most famous plays of all time. Director Franco Zeffirelli has done splendidly with this rather faithful adaptation. Much of the text from the play has been edited out, but the human drama still stands (every bit of rawness and intensity from the play remains). The actors have made some fine achievements. Gibson, Close, Bates, Holm, Bonham Carter, and Scofield play their parts very well (though I do believe that Gibson doesn't really look the part sometimes). The only problem I had with this movie is that there were several moments in which it felt very ponderous. I know Shakespeare isn't supposed to be very quick-paced, but here, some scenes do seem to plod when it's not even intentional. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this adaptation of Hamlet, and it makes me appreciate the great master of literature & theater even more.

Glenn Close is outstanding, her appearence is very appealing, very genuine both in a maternal and sexual way. The chemistry between Close and Gibson is impeccable. Glenn Close as Gertrude potrays every single emotion well, she is a prowd, happy queen to marry her husbands brother, on the other hand also a concerned and caring mother to Hamlet, her closeness to her son certainly gives a sexual tension as well. The film oozes with fine, flmamboyant performences from almost all the cast.

422259,5,6302096243,"It was about twenty years ago that I turned on my television idly one evening to find that a showing of Hamlet had just started. I was instantly transfixed and not just because this is my favourite play of all plays, but because I was looking at my absolute idea of what a Prince Hamlet should look like. It was another two hours before I found who was in the title role, but throughout that two hours I watched the action and listened to the dialogue and monologues acted and spoken by as perfect a piece of casting as I think I have ever yet seen.

Let me say that I have seen Olivier's Hamlet and I have seen Branagh's Hamlet and that I hugely enjoyed them both. I am not greatly concerned in this notice to weigh up niceties of interpretation and direction, because there are enough subtleties and possibilities in this great play to allow full scope for the individual style of every great actor for another thousand years. The literary criticism trade, profession or industry, though it has not yet talked Hamlet to death, has been trying hard to do that, and I would not like to be, without intending it, the straw that broke that camel's back. What puts this production in a class of its own for me is simply that for me Gibson IS Hamlet whereas Olivier and Branagh are acting Hamlet, albeit superbly. The blond fringe and the smallish physique are right for a start, in my mind. Then there is the understated style, the diction quiet, the mood brooding and smouldering. That is my idea of how to do the great soliloquies, not declaiming them, and when the repressed tension is abruptly released as, say, when Hamlet runs his sword through the arras, the contrast is all the more effective and does not require histrionics. Does Olivier perhaps over-act a bit? To my way of thinking he nearly always does, and in Hamlet his final `then venom to thy weh-eh-eh-eh-eh-rk!' definitely goes over the top even if nothing else does.

The supporting cast have won high praise, and I shall join in that too. Perhaps no other play by Shakespeare, unless maybe Coriolanus, is quite so dominated by its lead role as is Hamlet. Nevertheless the best Hamlet in the world could be undone if Claudius or Gertrude or Polonius or Ophelia or Laertes were not up to scratch, whereas if he has the kind of `support' provided here a performance that is already superb seems better than ever. One feature of the production, attributable to both the acting and the directing, struck me forcibly this time in a way it had not struck me before, and it relates to the character of Claudius. Up until the play-within-the-play his sang-froid is remarkable considering the primal crime he has committed, and even though his guilty conscience comes to the surface in the chapel, he carries his burden lightly, to all appearances. The play-within drives him to further desperate stratagems, but what came across to me was just how cool and inventive he remained. He tries to have Hamlet executed in England, and when that fails he arranges for not one but two types of poison to ensure the outcome of Hamlet's duel. Most strikingly of all, when Gertrude drinks the poisoned goblet he still controls his reaction to avoid giving himself away. Iago impressed Goethe enough to serve as the prototype of Goethe's Mephistopheles, but Iago's actions were small beer compared with this, and his planning was nowhere near as clever. Iago has had more attention from the commentators because he shares more of the limelight, but at the end of Othello he runs away as if Shakespeare did not even think him worth killing. Claudius may have deserved everything that Hamlet called him, but his defects did not include lack of quick thinking or want of nerve.

The production, but for the fact that this is a slightly abridged Hamlet, suits me admirably. The camera work and lighting are superb, and there are some excellent little vignettes, such as the terror of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern being brought to their executioner. In keeping with Gibson's reading of the title role, the `effects' are less highlighted here than from Branagh, and much less than from Olivier. The ghost is not melodramatic, and significantly the background music is kept within bounds of tolerance. It is a sad pity that William Walton, whose music accompanies the Olivier production, had on the one hand exceptional talent for such music but lacked the experience to know when he was overdoing things. I did not manage to spot what castle was used. It may have been in Scotland, and certainly the scene at the graveside could almost have been from Braveheart. As some will know, the real castle of the real Amled does not beetle o'er any crags, and the Bard's Elsinore is much more imposing than real-life Helsingor, but the Bard's is the concept that we need, and it is what we are offered.

Right at the start we are told that what we are about to see is `based on the play by William Shakespeare'. There are no major liberties, and what we are given is a bit of an abridgement. Hamlet is not a tightly-plotted drama, and I am not unduly upset by what Zeffirelli has done. The opening scene with the night-watchmen is skipped, and at the end Fortinbras is dispensed with. Neither of these acts of pruning bothered me, although I regretted the loss of occasional bits of dialogue from this most quotation-replete of plays. Of all plays that I have ever seen or read it remains my favourite, indeed this production reinforces its primacy. I can't say, as Mr Clive James has said, that it is the best play in the world because I don't know all the plays in the world, but surely it must be a candidate for that honour.",1233360000,5,5661,4.663663663663663

*Spoilers*

I adore Shakespeare in general and Hamlet in particular, and I generally try not to hew too closely to any one version, but I did not much care for this version of Hamlet. Compared to the superb Kenneth Branaugh version, Gibson's Hamlet seems dazed, drugged, and lackluster. His lines are spoken with no particular emphasis - everything sounds flat and dull. Initially, I felt this was an attempt to portray Hamlet as dazed and overwhelmed by his father's death, but even his descent into madness seems dull and lifeless and pales strongly in comparison to the manic babbling and hyper antics of Branaugh's Hamlet. I appreciate an attempt at a numb, grief-stricken performance, but it just doesn't work dramatically, and Hamlet requires more energy than Gibson displays here.

I will also add that Glenn Close, whom I usually respect, seems overly campy and bubbly here, with very little attempt at any facade of widowhood. This contrasts, too, with the Branaugh version, where Gertrude is superbly displayed as a politic queen, with a perfect facade of mourning, overlaying an underlying joy. This duplicity is more intriguing than the dancing, giggling child-queen we get from Close, and I found it strikingly simplistic.

Also very annoying is that several scenes are cut out of place, lines are spoken out of order, and soliloquies are cut short. This chops the drama badly and while I understand that some people feel that Shakespeare must be made more brief in order to be more accessible, there must be a better way with this.

This version provides a closed caption option for the hard of hearing. I do not own this movie - I rented this through my Blockbuster Online account.",1232409600,2,1717,4.947916666666667

422263,5,6302096243,"After seeing Olivier's version of Hamlet, I was interested in seeing this version of Hamlet. Admittedly, Mel Gibson was one-hundred percent of my impulse to see this film. I don't usually follow actors when choosing movies; I trust directors more than I trust actors in choosing movies. But Mel Gibson is an exception to this rule: when was the last time the man made a bad movie?-- I can't even think of one.

With this said, I rented this movie and watched it with growing delight and amazement. As always, Mel was Mel--great. Glen Close--great. The actors and actresses, from Mel Gibson, to Glen Close,to Alan Bates, to Ian Holmes, etc., delivered the complicated verses of the Bard's epic tragedy as though those words were their very own words. And those words, though fast and often ferocious, were nevertheless so clearly defined and nuanced that at no point during the film did I feel any inclination to switch on the subtitles. As Adrian Lynne's Lolita to Stanley Kubrick's Lolita, this version of Hamlet was so well made as to defy every comparison with its former. The gargantuan and rough-hewn sets of Zeffirelli's Hamlet sharply contrasts against the tiny, but well-organized sets of Olivier's Hamlet. Precision, economy, and bourgeoisie ethos marked Olivier's Hamlet; though equally articulate, Mel's Hamlet is scruffy and coarse as if to blend in with the harsh interior and exterior sets of the movie.

Hamlet is a proverb centered around the murder of King Hamlet, Hamlet's father. The murder of King Hamlet at the hands of his brother, Claudius--who subsequently assumes both Hamlet's crown and queen--is the outrage that inflames young Hamlet (Gibson)against his mother's--Glen Close-- new husband. Despite all signs pointing to the affirmative--that Claudius murdered his father, young Hamlet cannot act decisively and his wavering establishes a chain of terrible and tragic incidents.

This Hamlet is a great movie, equally so to Olivier's Hamlet. Mel Gibson's best acting performance. Glen Close, never more beautiful.",1222646400,2,2040,5.213414634146342

422290,5,6302096243,"As a very outspoken theatre and Shakespeare buff, I should favor Kenneth B.'s 1996 version of the tale, what with its full text of the original play and so on.  However, I find this version of HAMLET to be far superior to Kenneth's long, overdrawn, melodramatic, and slightly TOO epic version of the story.  My main reason for prefering this version is the fact that Mel Gibson is a much more relateable and multi-faceted Hamlet than Kenneth, who's Hamlet goes through out the course of the film whinning, brooding, speaking eloquently, and then...well, whining some more.  I was annoyed with his performance, but very refreshed by Mr. Gibson's.  He doesn't play the character as a medieval Goth punk boy, he plays him as a relatively normal young man who has been thrust into a situation that is far from average.  The supporting cast is also suberb, especially the regal Glenn Close as Queen Gertrude, portraying very boldly the sexual longings of the character, a very rare find in most productions of the play.  Helena Bonham Carter turns in the most modern and strong Ophelia that I have ever seen on screen or on stage.  Her Ophelia is obedient, yes, but passive, whiny, and weak, she is not.  She gives the impression that she is obedient for one reason only: given her sex and the time period, she has no other choice, but she doesn't give in without a fight.  Even her insanity is strong rather than weak - she is a very angry Ophelia, and her madness seems to almost be her way of rebeling against what has happened to her and how her fellow characters have abused and walked over her, rubbing in their faces the fact that her decent into madness is the result of their depravity, selfishness, and manipulation.  I love Kate Winslet, but her Ophelia in Kenneth's version was too weepy, too whiny, and too converntial.  Helena breaks all the barriers with her portrayl.  The atmosphere of this film is very fitting for the story: it is a very remote, earthy, dark, dank Denmark, and even though we see many beautiful European locations and sweeping staircases and large royal halls, Zeffereli manages to artfully make his audience feel as Hamlet feels: anxious and claustrophobic.",1206662400,7,2189,4.761904761904762
422291,5,6302096243,"Mel Gibson won me over. Hamlet was produced by Franco Zeffirelli, the guy behind Romeo and Juliet 22 years earlier. Great color, grays and browns from the Middle Ages. Shakespeare biographies are sketchy. William Shakespeare was born at Stratford-on-the-Avon in 1564. Stratford is 100 miles from London. Avon is the river. He married Anne Hathaway and had three children. He moved to London and established himself as a playwright. His plays were staged at the Globe. Hamlet is the best, written in 1601. It deals with revenge, procrastination and insanity. Hamlet puts on an ""antic disposition"" as he delays avenging his father's murder. The real issue is death. Why do we have to die? Why live at all if we must die? Shakespeare died in 1616 at age 52. His 36 plays divide into tragedies, comedies, histories and problem plays. Characters drop like flies in the tragedies.",1204070400,2,874,4.9523809523809526
422292,4,6302096243,"Franco Zeffirelli takes another shot at directing Shakespeare--a hobby of his since the 1960s--in this solemn 1991 production with his characteristically abridged text.
 Gibson joins an intriguing fraternity of the onscreen portrayers  of Literature's Princely Procrastinator. Laurence Olivier had the classically dramatic Hamlet(1948), Nicol Williamson had the staid Hamlet (although in that 1969 production, Marianne Faithfull's Ophelia made more of an impression on me), and Kenneth Branaugh, clad in 19th century costumes, had the intensely sinewy and thorough Hamlet(1996).
 But Mel Gibson strikes me as the intensely cool Hamlet. In a drafty-looking Elsinore Castle situated by the sea, the drama begins, and the modernity Gibson lends to the role of the melancholy Dane as he mourns his father (the venerable Paul Scofield) is confronted by his ghost, disturbed by the sudden remarriage of his mother Queen Gertrude(a most Scandinavian-looking Glenn Close) to his Uncle Claudius (a conniving Alan Bates)who succeeds his brother to the Danish throne, emanates.
 Gibson makes this role a carry-over from his roles in ""Mad Max"" and ""Lethal Weapon"" as he plays another character on a quest for vengeance (and perhaps he also draws on earlier training as a Shakespearan actor, having played Romeo onstage in Australia years before). Feigning  madness, he has the melancholy air displayed in so many of his films and the close-ups of his very expressive  trademark cornflower blue eyes encapsulates that.
 He has the opportunity to kill his Uncle after learning of his responsibility  for his father's death as Claudius kneels at prayer with a troubled conscience after watching a play with an all-too-familiar theme. Worrying that Claudius' soul may go to Heaven if he is killed while at prayer, Hamlet decides to wait for a more appropriate moment--a decison that leads to a mounting array of carnage.
 The tragedy of Polonius(Ian Holm)the King's Chamberlain, falls fast on the heels of Hamlet's unfortunate decision, which soon has its bearing on Ophelia(a well-cast Helena Bonham Carter), Polonius' daughter, as well as  well as his son, Laertes (a sharp-eyed Nathaniel Parker who is relatively calm in his treachery).
 Amid an array of seemingly accurate Danish Medieval era costumes, and an environment of mostly cold solemnity, we watch Hamlet outwit two fellow students, noblemen Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Michael Maloney and Sean Murray), with the fatal consequences for the duo; another lugubrious moment is briefly assuaged by Hamlet's chat with a gravedigger (Trevor Peacock).
  Later John McEnery, two decades removed from his memorable performances as Zeffirelli's Mercutio, appears as the nobleman Osiric.
 Stephen Dillane's Horatio bears witness to these calamitous events, and after Gibson gives the most soberly forceful  delivery of Hamlet's denunciation of his Uncle that I've witnessed to date, is charged with telling the tale. No invasion of foreign troops. No seizure of the Danish throne by the Norwegian Prince Fontainbras in this production. It is just basic, and full of profound sadness, leaving a viewer with much to ponder about the folly of it all.",1201392000,,3185,5.445121951219512

422296,5,6302096243,"Throughout cinematic history many gifted people have made many splendid versions of what is one of Shakespear's most spirited and acclaimed stories of all time. They have come and gone, but this is one that should remain for all times never to be forgotten. Definitely my favorite, it seems so much more alive than other versions and lets face it, with an actor so live as Mel Gibson at the helm, its bound to be.

Gibson slips immaculately, if not effortlessly into the shoes of this hard-to-fill character previously portrayed by so many other fine actors. But in doing so, he brings something new to the theatrical table set forth here by Franco Zeffirelli (The Taming of the Shrew). It is practicalism. Gibson does not selfishly  attempt to play Hamlet in his own way as some have, but instead prefers to keep things deeply theatrical and classic as well as practical for all those watching. In the 'actor's journey' included in the special features leaf, we witness Gibson's painstaking and dedicated efforts to keep the character accurately real through constant research and repetition of the lines. We get to see a master at work. Mel Gibson sacrifices nothing and yet adds everything to the renowned character, and does it with a truly wonderful supporting cast.

Glenn Close is Hamlet's mother, Gertrude, while Alan Bates portrayes Hamlet's Uncle Claudius. Both are superb in their skills and fill their respective roles wonderfully, but the two roles that really captured my attention were Ian Holm as the meddlesome Polonius, and Helena Bonham-Carter as our frail and lovely Ophelia. As a viewer I have always been partial to Holm in any role. To me he seems to be one of the lesser known geniuses of his craft, and that evaluation is in no way lessened by his work here (for those of you unfamiliar with his name you might remember him from his most recent role as 'Bilbo' in Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy). He's been around for ages and seems to be at the peak of his acting abilities in this work, moving effortlessly over the unceasing and complicated structure of Shakespear's lines and phrases. As for Helena Bonham-Carter, no one could have been better to portray the ill-fated Ophelia in saneness or madness. She also posesses one of those unique, other-worldly kind of faces that just seems to gel for this role. Paul Scofield returns to familiar work in William Shakespear's plays as the dead ghost of Hamlet's father. Top all of this off with music scored by the legendary Ennio Morricone (who was recently honored with lifetime achievement at the Academy Awards) and you've got yourself a depiction of a story that can't go wrong!

The movie runs 135 minutes long and is accompanied by a making-of documentary by Mel Gibson, ""To Be or Not to Be"". It also comes with the original theatrical trailer and the movie itself is viewable through English, French or Spanish subtitles. And be sure to buy the widescreen version for better viewing.

This movie is produced with the upmost dilligence, and most superb effort from actors, writers, designers, musicians and director alike. The most wonderful and practical version of ""Hamlet"" on the market. You'll see what I mean.",1185408000,2,3206,4.875229357798165

Only since the release of Taming of the Shrewd on VHS have I ventured to view and thoroughly enjoy not only the Shakespearean words, but a lively tale which showcases how life has not changed since the 16th century.  Hamlet, with Mel Gibson, is another such movie that has brought Shakespeare alive and understandable.  It is entertaining & easy to follow & not too lengthy that one would lose interest.

422311,4,6302096243,"1991's ""Hamlet"" featured action star Mel Gibson as the melancholy Danish Prince of the title of Shakespeare's famous tragedy.  Gibson, whose resume was based on the Mad Max and Lethal Weapon franchises at that time, is surprisingly effective in a role thought be a stretch.  Director Franco Zeffirelli had the good sense to let Gibson's energetic performance drive the pacing of a very brisk two-hour version of the story.  The result is a very accessible production about murder and revenge in the Danish Royal Family, and a vigorous portrayal of the normally languid and moody Hamlet.

Zeffirelli's movie features beautiful location shooting, excellent costumes, and an extremely talented supporting cast, lead by Glenn Close as Hamlet's mother Gertrude, Alan Bates as the treacherous step-father, and Helena Bonham-Carter as the doomed Ophelia.  At the center is Hamlet, as played by Gibson, visibly disturbed in his madness over his father's death, and movingly emotional in his approach to his mother and to Ophelia.

This movie is highly recommended as a different but highly entertaining version of Hamlet.  It may appeal most to those without preconceived notions about how Hamlet should be portrayed, or to those who know Mel Gibson only from his later films.",1180656000,2,1268,5.247524752475248
422312,5,6302096243,"I laughed my head off when I was told that Mel Gibson had made a version of Hamlet. But even though casting a then action star as the meloncholy dane made as much sense as casting Charlie Sheen as King Lear, Gibson actually pulls it off, making for a more accessible and relateable Hamlet without cheapening or selling-out the material. The rest of the cast is perfectly acceptable: Glenn Close, Alan Bates, Ian Holm etc. And  director Zeffirelli (already a notch on his belt with a definitive version of Romeo & Juliet) brings an interesting visual style to the mix: Matching the film to a rugid, harsh, grey, landscape the mirrors the rugid, harsh, grey content of the film to an effect that would have made Igmar Bergman proud (along with an, of course, wonderful Ennio Morricone score). The play is abridged which means that there isn't nearly enough of (amoung others) Helena Bonham Carter's Ophelia, but I suppose it's better to wish you could spend more time with someone than for them to wear out their welcome.",1180483200,5,1019,4.724719101123595

422314,5,6302096243,"When it comes to adaptations of Shakespeare, modern films unfortunately fall into one of two rather broadly defined groups. There are those films which seek to set all of the Bard's plays in his late 16th, early 17th century world, even when the plays do NOT take place in a time contemporary to Shakespeare's own (Julius Caesar, King Lear, and Antony and Cleopatra all take place in times far removed from Shakespeare's own).

The other set of films usually attempt a ""modernization"" of Shakespeare, setting his plays in our own time, perhaps in an attempt to help us ""relate"" to an era deemed too distant by some; what usually results is a film that seems awkwardly uncomfortable in both our world and Shakespeare's world-- Romeo and Juliet with DiCaprio, and ""O"" come to mind here. Although a few films (such as Julie Taymor's beautiful and disturbing ""Titus"") are quite successful at blending modern aesthetics and world-views with those of the Renaissance.

However, with this version of Hamlet, the viewer is presented with early medieval Denmark... exactly the place and time that Shakespeare had in mind while writing this play. The accuracy of the cultural and historical ambiance is of course to be celebrated (standing in stark contrast to Kenneth Branagh's version which is mysteriously set in a 19th century context, but should be celebrated for presenting the entire play, whereas Gibson's Hamlet is somewhat abridged), but it is only part of what makes this adaptation notable.

The quality of acting and casting seems near perfect in my mind, and indeed the acting shines above everything else in this rendition. Mel Gibson, Ian Holm, Helena Bonham Carter are all superb-- but it is Glenn Close's Queen Gertrude who truly deserves praise.

Close is able to portray the complexities of thought and feeling which motivate much of Gertrude's actions during the play. While reading Hamlet, or viewing a version with a less-than-ideal Gertrude, the character can quite easily become inaccessible and distant; Glenn Close imbues every action with purpose, and sheds some light on one of Shakespeare's arguably most mysterious characters.

Gibson's talent at portraying the tormented Hamlet is an unlooked for surprise, as is his ability to handle Shakespeare's complex language with grace and ease. Sadly, his recent behavior has tarnished his career, but his beautiful portrayal of Hamlet is a wonderful reminder of what a great actor he once was.",1178928000,5,2458,5.135
422315,4,6302096243,"This is a fresh and vivid version of Hamlet, and merits repeated viewing despite some eccentricities.  The strengths are its solid core, with Gibson's excellent embodiment of the hero and the best Ophelia in modern productions, Helen Bonham Carter.  Alan Bates' scruffy, dissolute Claudius is also both soundly conceived and executed.  The sets are highly realistic and there is a grand amount of outdoor photography making it spectacular to behold again and again.

The chief weakness is a way, way overplayed Freudian interpretation of Hamlet and his mother, which almost spoils the movie.  Otherwise Glenn Close as Gertrude is at her professional best.

The 2 hour rush through the play is breath taking, but sacrifices some fine points such as Rozencrantz and Gildenstern, and the ghost of Hamlet's father which sadly misuses an earnest Paul Schofield.  These are minor arguments; there is always room for experimenting with the play.  It is funny however that Zeffereli, usually a first rate Shakespearean interpreter, shoots so finally wide of target here.  But with a play of this nature you have to take what you can get, and I have never seen the funeral of Ophelia better done, and Hamlet's defining leap into her grave.  Sure, this is a little bit of an ""action hero"" Hamlet, but that is an important corrective to too many rather stodgy versions of the play which had dominated for awhile before this came out.",1178841600,2,1422,4.987288135593221

I would recommend this film to someone who wants to learn the story but is not interested in true dialog of the period. Not one of Mel Gibson's finer performances.",1178755200,,436,4.265060240963855

Paul Scofield's Ghost and Glenn Close's Queen Gertrude are the best among a cast of talented actors.  Mel Gibson for the main role was since the beginning the more controversial choice, and no matter what he is not suitable for prince Hamlet.

But at the end, it was always common with Zeffirelli making this kind of ""moves"", like casting Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton for ""Taming of the Shrew"" or the multicast of ""Jesus of Nazareth"".",1177804800,,768,4.632352941176471

422351,4,6302096243,"I just taught a course on Hamlet for Lifelong Learning and this was one of four film versions of Hamlet I used.  This is a very good short version of the play.  Mel Gibson does a credible job and the supporting cast is excellent.  Glenn Close as Gertrude is outstanding - she shows the giddiness and joy of new love which helps to explain the rashness of her remarriage.  Alan Bates as Claudius is likeable and you can see why Gertrude violated canonical law to marry him.  This is the incestuous relationship at the heart of the play.  Think of your mother marring your uncle.

The reason I did not use Olivier's Hamlet is that while it's a good film with great acting -  it's a very bad Hamlet.  Freud was very much in vogue at the time and Olivier distorted the movie to put overtones of the Oedipus Complex into it.  Also the Claudius in this film is obnoxious and there is no reason for Gertrude to marry him or for Hamlet to delay so long.

One of the important points of this play is the struggle between the two ""mighty opposites"" of Hamlet and Claudius. They have to be seen as  equals.  The best Claudius I have seen is Derek Jacobi in Branaugh's Hamlet (also my favorite version of Hamlet).

For a short version of the play, I would definately recommend this Hamlet over the Olivier version.

 Another point for viewers to note, in Shakespeare's time, a ghost could either be good or evil.  Hamlet has doubts about the truth of the ghost's statement until the mousetrap play proves the allegations.  At this time Hamlet assumes the ghost is a good, but sometimes an evil spirit can be telling the truth.  It is up to the viewer to decide if the ghost is from heaven or from hell.",1163462400,57,1690,4.393548387096774

422353,5,6302096243,"Brilliant is an often overworked phrase, but in the case of *Hamlet* starring Mel Gibson, the word cannot be used enough.  For brevity's sake, I will save Zeffirelli's cudos for another time and place except to say that he has done a good thing.  This review is for Chris Devore and his beautiful working and dramturgy of the more than difficult Shakespeare script.  Devore somehow makes it better.  Were he in London, late 1500's, he would have been a collaborator, making Will's work the pearl it is today.  My only plea is that, at some date, we will get to see Gibson give the advice to the players which was omitted so that other pieces could be spared.

This may have been Glenn Close's best work.  This is not a complaint, but rather a sign that anyting else she may have or has done cannot be any better than this wonderful, small role.  Gertrude, the Queen (Close), has an important commentary that must be heard in order for the play to work - Will was no fool - and it needs a Close to do it.

Alan Bates has been a staple of English theatre and screen and has delivered many fine parts (such as Gabriel Oaks in *Far From the Madding Crowd*, 1967).  As Claudius, the regicide and brother of Hamlet, Senior, Bates makes you believe that his reign could have been noble except for that one small cancer, that flaw in his character - very Clintonian and very believable.

I have wanted to kick Ian Holm's ever since Ash hurt Ripley in *Alien*, 1979.  I have to keep reminding myself that he really is that believable and that I really don't hate him, It's the character he has created so well.  His body of work is repleat with characters of such believability that you forget his name - IAN HOLM - until he does it again, the next time, in the next movie.  If films were strictly Hasidic, Holm's version of Polonius would be Kosher.  There is not one piece of ham in his entire performance. It is worth the purchase of the DVD just to see him act.

Everyone is good in the movie and there is not time to talk about all of them.  But a note to those whose noses are airbourne and won't tolerate anyone but Olivier as Hamlet.  There are several uneven performances in his excellent movie.  There are no uneven performances in this piece.

Finally, we come to the mad prince of Denmark.  It is most astonishing that I watched this epic again after Mel's dark night of the troll, thrashing about in complete insanity, arguably brought on by hard likker, frustration, and stupidity.  Yet with all said, Gibson IS the essential Hamlet.  You will find no other actor who delivers the goods the way the Cruiser from the Boozer does.

You know this is true, not just by watching the exquisite performance on the DVD, but by Gibson's own marveling at what was accomplished, not because of some actor's raison d'etre, but rather by the actor's very ability to understand that he is dealing with things that go beyond the ken of normal humans.  IS Hamlet crazy, or crazy like a fox?  And when is he crazy we get to hear Mel say in the devastating interview he made for the DVD release many years gone by.

So, enough from me.

If you want to see the best Hamlet ever, buy this DVD and feast.

422355,5,6302096243,Shakespeare's Hamlet has been done and redone many times over.  Probably because the play has so many universal themes it is the most popular of his plays.  When I first saw Sir Lawrence Olivier's adaptation I thought there could be no equal.  Mr. Gibson has challenged that thought with a moving and  passionate portrayal.  Mr. Gibson has created nothing short of a new standard for this old favorite.  Ms. Close as the doting but fickle mother sets an equal standard for her part.  The other roles are filled perfectly as well and the visuals take you back to that time and place to witness the events first hand.

422358,4,6302096243,"My kids really enjoyed this version and actually, so did I. I have to say that Mel Gibson verged a little too strongly on that dippy character he played in all those Lethal Weapon movies - but that's probably my bad. If I hadn't watched those dumb movies all those years ago, I probably wouldn't have been expecting Mel's Hamlet to suddenly dislocate/relocate his shoulder.

Anyway, Mel was pretty good. And Helena Bonham-Carter was REALLY good. After Hamlet stabbed Polonius behind the tapestry, Ophelia came unglued in a really spooky and satisfying way. Her big crazy scene was full of energy from every actor on the set - you could FEEL their ""Ew! Keep away from me!"" emotions jarring around with their terrible grief and pity for what poor, pretty Ophelia had descended into. It was very spine-tingly.

I liked Glenn Close a lot as Gertrude. That was definitely a different spin on the role I'd ever seen before, with the guilty queen swanning around with wide, innocent eyes, so happy with her big, strapping new hubby (ick) and so pleased when her darling boy makes the effort to cast off his gloominess and embrace his new daddy (ick more.) Hamlet's ""gotcha"" scene with Gertrude was also very good.

Because so much has been cut, this is a great version for kids to watch. Mine sat on the edge of their seats for the whole two hours and never mentioned popcorn. The ending threw me for a loop - Fortinbras? - so I couldn't give it 5 stars, but Rosencrantz and Guildenstern got their comeuppance, so I was somewhat reconciled.",1155772800,4,1533,4.67037037037037

422390,5,6302096243,"When Director Franco Zeffirelli is at the director's helm, the  results are nothing short of phenomenal. Along with the Sir Laurence Oliver version, this is the one I watch the most. As usual, Franco Zeffirelli adds his phenomenal, but dignified scenery, his music that flatters the content, and a great cast that actually become the characters. For those of you who don't know the story, it revolves around Hamlet. I really don't like Mel Gibson, but there is no denying the fact that he handles the role of Hamlet very well. (His sorrow, his contemplation, his sudden rages, his seeming madness, etc.) He suspects his uncle Claudius murdered his brother (Hamlet's father) to steal the crown and the elder Hamlet's widow. His beliefs are confirmed when he meets the ghost of his father who tells that story. (The ghost by the way is portrayed phenomenally by Paul Scofield who portrays human sorrow and dignity.) However, Hamlet can not just kill Claudius. (He has no evidence, and Claudius is an EFFECTIVE AND LIKABLE  king. The murder of Claudius will not be accepted on some ghost story.) We also meet the bumbling, but good hearted Polonius played well by Ian Holm. His son Laertes is played well by Parker. (Parker has Laertes's love for his father and sister down as well as his sudden rages.) Helena Boham Carter gives beauty and dignity to Ophelia. Glenn Close does a fairly good job as Hamlet's mother. A big extra kudos goes to Alan Bates for his phenomenal portrayal of Claudius. This is a complex character that many people don't fully understand. He is the villain who murdered his brother and stole the crown. But like Macbeth, he DOES have a conscience, and he does feel sorrow and regret. (Richard III could have easily sat through a play of what he had done without even flinching! Claudius IS NOT that sort of person!) He is also a good king except for what he did to get the crown. (He is especially likable when he quells Laertes's raid with pure courage and intelligence. And he IS being honest when he says he was guiltless of Polonius's death!) As Hamlet begins plotting his moves, even at the point of appearing mad, Claudius is NOT fooled. He sees the madness exactly for what it is. (An element in a plot against him.) Except for Hamlet, Claudius is by far the most intelligent character in the story, and just as Hamlet is waiting for his chance, Claudius is waiting for his chance. (But he can't just kill Hamlet either. Like himself, Hamlet is too well liked.) So, it is a race as to whether Hamlet can prove that Claudius killed the elder Hamlet or if Claudius can prove that Hamlet is plotting treason first. To be sure, this movie cuts a little under 2 hours from this 4 hour play. But Director Franco Zeffirelli was really careful about what he deleted.  (Even the Sir Laurence Olivier version was 2 hours and change.) But despite the missing material, nothing is obviously missing. In fact, it would seem that rather than trying to memorize 4 hours of script, the actors concentrated on what was essential, and they BECAME the characters for 2 hours. Whether it is Hamlet, Claudius, The Ghost of Hamlet's Father, Gertrude, Polonius, Laertes, Ophelia, Horatio, Guildenstern, Rosencratz, the players, or even the grave digger, can any one person be accused of not having the role down? In all honesty, there is not a dull moment in this production. Finally, to Director Franco Zeffirelli's credit, he juggled the scenes around to make more sense. (One example is that he deletes the first scene with the ghost of Hamlet's father. We just see his funeral. This makes it all the more frightening when Hamlet's friends tell him that they have seen his father.) Overall, this follows Sir Laurence Olivier's ""Hamlet"" very well. The dvd has 2 nice extras.

422391,4,6302096243,"This Play is one of the most important pieces of drama and poetry in Shakespeare's complete works. A cycle of peace and quiet is disturbed by an incestuous crime, both the murder of a brother and the hasty and sensuous marriage of the murderer with the victim's wife, a marriage which is totally against the normal Christian and feudal rules of the time : you are not supposed to covet the wife of your brother. Then havoc falls onto the kingdom of Denmark. Hamlet is forced to play deranged and crazy to save his life and to cover up his violent defense against dangers around him. Ophelia will get deranged to the point of drowning herself. Then the cycle of disturbances will go on to its utter end which means the destruction of all the protagonists. Shakespeare's vision does not stop there : equilibrium is reintroduced in this disturbed kingdom by the arrival of a distant cousin, Fortinbras, who seizes power by force though he represents the last touch of legitimacy available. But this film takes two interesting options. The first one is the will to be as realistic as possible about the real living conditions of the time in the Elsinore Castle in Denmark. Gloomy, dark, shadowy, life is nothing but a shady dream accompanied by ambitious social climbers who are ready to do anything to have power and privileges. The film insists on the fate of some of these smiling hypocrites, like Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern who are shown in their last living instant just before the axe of the executioner falls on their necks in London. The film also insists on the filth of such a life and concentrates this dirt onto Ophelia. This realistic choice gives to the play a dramatic density that it deserves entirely. At times it verges onto a melodramatic dimension, especially when dealing with the mother who is an unsensitive ambitious woman who does not want to lose the status of Queen and is ready to do anything to keep that crown. In fact she cannot love Hamlet because he represents a danger to her queenhood. Zeffirelli shows her nearly as being repentant. The second option is the cutting off of the last scene, the arrival of Fortinbras to seize power by force and legitimize the return to equilibrium since he is the only surviving relative of this blood line and he had been banned out of Denmark because he was against the strange crowning of the brother of the dead King due to his marrying the dead king's wife, which is incestuous as we have seen. This change in ending cuts off any historical and political meaning in the play, and that is a shame because Shakespeare is a great historian in a way, definitely a historical playwright who has a full vision of fate and time. Why did Zeffirelli do that ? We can hardly know. Maybe he wanted to balance his Romeo and Juliet with a second drama of the same type. Maybe it is his vision of Shakespeare, even if it is a reduction.

Having a clear ability to understand Shakespeare (as I had read several of his plays, but not yet Hamlet) I was bewildered. A film based on Shakespeare needs to interpret the work VISUALLY as well as with the dialogue.

This is not a film for those who know not the play and it is too short, too cut and too uninspired for those who do. What a pointless mess, really. Typical dreary castle, typical silly costumes, typical, typical, typical. It's everything people expect from films based on Shakespeare, boring, dull, familiar.

See Kenneth Branaughs 4hr masterpiece, and Anthony Hopkins ""Titus"" or Ian McKellen's ""Richard III"" to see what Shakespeare can really be on screen.",1148688000,7,772,4.885496183206107
422393,4,6302096243,"Once again, I'd like to give a half-star rating, but alas . . .

As my by-line indicates, I am a former high school teacher.  Without exception, this is the version of Hamlet that is a class-room favorite.  (I show 2 others: Branaugh (2nd place) and the film starring Ethan Hawke (everyone hates it).)  It is accessible to younger viewers and is just a beautiful film all around.

The filming, camera work and sets are impeccable.  One is instantly transported into the world these characters inhabit.  As to the script, it IS heavily edited; however, most of what is omitted (see note below) is ""shown"" to the audience through visual media.  This isn't a ""filmed version of the play""; it is a film based on the play.  In that framework, it is quite well done.  I particularly like the beginning scenes that make Hamlet's description of his mother - ""Like Niobe, all tears"" - come to life.

The acting, to my thinking, is superb.  The emphasis here is on Hamlet's relationship to his mother, Gertrude. That comes through quite clearly.  Gibson's Hamlet comes across as a soldier - a man of action - who agonizes over the eternal consequences of his acts.  He is believable in the role, masterful in some ways.  Likewise the supporting cast.  Helena Bonham-Carter and Glenn Close provide particularly vibrant portrayals of their characters.

So, why not 5 stars?  Without the ""Fortinbras"" subplot, some of the urgency in the play seems missing.  While definitely a secondary story-line, it provides a framework that adds tension to the play as a whole as the war is waged both outside the castle walls and within.

Overall, this production gets an A.  Very accessible.  Very easily understood.  And haunting in its own way.",1143590400,97,1722,4.802047781569966

Intense and broody, it manages to convey the confusion of a mind being torn apart by fate in a way that is more convincing and watchable than Branagh's. The whole film is entertaining while still managing to bring something new to the much feasted upon Shakespearean table, just what every film adaptation of the bard's works should try to do.",1140048000,5,665,4.6923076923076925
422422,2,6302096243,"First, let me clarify that I sometimes like Mel Gibson as an actor, even sometimes as a director. Also, let me say that Franco Zefferelli has a very fine eye for color and composition, fine enough to make all his films interesting to look at. However, the problems of this film are many-fold, so many that in spite of its being pleasant to look at, it is unpleasant to watch and hear. The biggest problem is the director's lack of depth. Viewing this movie, I have the distinct impression that Zefferilli's first thoughts were about the length of the picture (keeping it from exceeding ""two hours traffic"") and making interesting-looking pictures. This surface-oriented approach to Shakespeare indicates that the director placed little emphasis or made nearly no effort at what constitutes the heart of his work: Making the most of the language.

Among other errors, Zefferelli makes unfortunate cuts and emendations. For example, he guts much of Claudius's soliloquy in the prayer scene, leaving the character almost a stock villain (this in spite of an excellent actor, Alan Bates, in the role). He also seems to be unconcerned with temporal logic: Hamlet and Laertes cannot duel properly with bated or unbated rapiers because of the medieval setting. It is absurd that they use broad swords rather than rapiers in the duel scene, swords which are meant to hack, rather than stab, contradicting the whole point of the unbated and poisoned tip of the foil. The medieval story always, in Shakespeare, has to be consistent with the Elizabethan context in which it was composed.

Finally, Mel Gibson, ordinarily a decent film actor, is hung out to dry and unable to negotiate this, the most challenging male role in English theatre, alone. He needs a director who is both a deep thinker and who knows how to challenge his actors to find the spine of their character and bring it to the surface. Zefferelli just didn't (or couldn't) make his leading actor dive deeply enough into the character - especially not THIS character. And Mel Gibson is an actor who himself lacks the depth needed to investigate Hamlet thoroughly, and his is surely an actor who needs a very different type of director for this kind of role.

I give the film its two stars, however, for a couple of reasons: First, the supporting cast has two gems in it -- Helena Bonham-Carter is, in spite of some very odd choices from her director, a wonderful Ophelia, and Ian Holm is one of the very best Poloniuses I have ever seen. Second, as bad as this film is, it is far less painful than Kenneth Brannagh's so-called ""uncut"" Hamlet.",1138147200,9,2598,4.807606263982103
422423,1,6302096243,"I give this film version of Hamlet one star only, and that is for the Paul Scofield's terrific ghost, which is perhaps emblematic of the several smaller roles taken in this production by superb Shakespearean actors of British backgrounds.

Such performances notwithstanding, the film is, quite simply, dreadful, and more in the vein of high melodrama than high tragedy.  Gibson is altogether unable to convey anything of Hamlet's complexity.  Why are mediocre actors applauded for their ""vitality"", when the results are this, well, mediocre?  And given her abundant gifts as an actor, Close is especially disappointing as Gertrude.  The problem here may be partly interpretation, and hence the responsibility of Zeffirelli.

In fact, it is Zeffirelli who surprises me most of all with this mess, as he has been responsible for several fine renditions of the Bard's plays, not the least of which was his Romeo and Juliet.

One is much better off going to any of number of other cinematic Hamlets, begining with Olivier's magnificent 1948 assumption.  And if the objective is to appeal to a mainstream audience, why not turn to Almereyda's 2000 film, set in New York City?  For all of its eccentricity, that film, contains some interesting performances, and on the whole, possesses the tragic quality that a good Hamlet should.",1131148800,17,1325,5.125581395348838
422424,5,6302096243,"I put off seeing this film for many years as I did not believe that Gibson would issue appropriate treatment to Shakespeare's masterpiece. In retrospect, Braveheart and Gibson's own masterpiece, The Passion, should have alerted me that Mel was a serious artist with extensive vision far before his later achievements came along. Here, more venturesome viewers than I, discovered that Gibson was not a bubblegum actor but a figure worthy of association with the bard. With this film we see a rather early glimpse of what Mel Gibson would become. There is a boyous impetuousity and energy to his performance that makes him infinitely believable. Helena Bonham-Carter is her princessularly beautiful self. As a feminine figure of wonder she has few peers. Ian Holm, as always, is first class. The same can be said of Glenn Close. One of the things I find rewarding about watching Shakespeare on DVD is turning on the subtitles and having the text enhance the visual  experience...and enhance your mind as well.",1128988800,9,1007,5.029940119760479

422426,4,6302096243,"In a Catholic family which includes a daughter who still wears a threadbare ""Braveheart tee"", a mother who has seen ""Signs"" three times on the big screen, and several men folk, who, in spite of the female Murphys' incessant pratings about Mel Gibson being one of the Almighty's more lovely creations, are nonetheless willing to admit that the man, after all, can act, it should come as no surprise that this 1990 film, directed by the flamboyant Franco Zeffirelli, is not known as ""Zeffirelli's Hamlet"" but ""Mel's Hamlet."" What is surprising, perhaps, is how much this film adaptation has grown on Clan Murphy over the years, in spite of Zeffirelli's mutilation of Shakespeare's text. Cut by half&#8213;nay, chopped, hacked, eviscerated, generally shot all to hell, with no Fortinbras, nary a complete soliloquy except for the inevitable ""To be or not to be,"" with lines reassigned all over the place&#8213;this two-hour script of a four-hour play should have been enough to make these bardolaters grieve...were it not that the acting and staging of what remained was so remarkably satisfying.

To begin, Zeffirelli is an Enthusiast with an operatic streak. His many virtues and occasional vices, cinematically speaking, appear to stem from a temperamental tendency to what the Italians call ""sprezzatura.""  Let us say, ""dying in his own too much.""  But Zeffirelli has taken his over-the-topness down a notch in this film, befitting its bracing North Atlantic setting designed by the brilliant Dante Ferretti.  Zeffirelli has thereby resisted the temptation to Wagnerian excess that I, for one, would have loathed. Instead, the medieval Norse Elsinore that the filmmakers have created, an elemental time and place in which springtime seems like a promise never kept, is subdued in color and ornament, but rich in texture. It reels with labyrinthine staircases leading everywhere and nowhere at the same time, as in one of those dizzying Escher lithographs.  More to the purpose, perhaps, Zeffirelli and his cast put their sets to good use. The actors move, interact, fill the stage&#8213;unlike the Talking Heads productions one so often sees, in which characters stand around babbling beautifully, but never seem to inhabit their spaces, let alone live in them.

I was impressed, too, as I have been before, with Zeffirelli's talent for getting inside the rhythms and Weltanschauung of another century, another culture.  With a play like ""Hamlet"", this time-traveling facility can be especially valuable, as it has become notoriously difficult for us twenty-first century postmoderns to get our imaginations around a world in which vow-breaking, adultery, incest, and political murder are shocking crimes, worthy of gasps rather than snickers; in which a belief in Ghosts, Angels, Demons&#8213;even Eternal Damnation&#8213;are tenable metaphysical positions held by sophisticated, educated, people. But that was the world Shakespeare lived in, the world his text hands us, and many directors, circumscribed by their own broad-minded relativism (not to mention, devotion to Foucault-laced lit crit) cannot seem to stage it any longer without dragging in boatloads of irony. What the audience is usually left with is a Prince of Denmark whose much-ballyhooed ""nobility"" consists of little more than a furious facility for skewering hypocrisy (Branagh) or a rebel-without-a-cause ennui (Almereyda).

Zeffirelli, however, by all accounts (like his star, Gibson), still adheres to many of those traditional concepts which form the subtext of this Elizabethan revenge play, and the anti-anti-hero he gives us looks a good deal more, I suspect, like the tragic hero of former ages than has been seen for some time.  Burdened, baleful, a little batty, yes, and ultimately broken, but no deconstructed Hamlet this...and my goodness, how refreshing it is.

As for Gibson himself, there has always been something a little ADHD about the actor, and he holds the screen with his energy as much as his good looks.  In the role of Hamlet, his athleticism and animal spirits imbue the top-heavy Dane (always thinking too precisely on the event) with an intensity and edginess that I found most appealing.  Not that there's anything blunt or un-intellectual about Mel's Hamlet, either, let us hasten to add; just that, for once, I was able to believe that the Prince of Denmark was by nature a robust male with an intact personality&#8213;-until, at least, he returns from school to find his familiar Elsinore transmogrified into the Twilight Zone.

Too, and to his credit, Gibson is one of the few Hamlets I've seen who actually thinks his words as he speaks them; is even surprised on occasion&#8213;horrified&#8213;by his own suddenly tempest-dark thoughts and impulses. This, too, was refreshing, as actors aren't the only ones who know these lines so well they could recite them in their sleep.

The rest of the cast is excellent, though the mangled dialogue frequently leaves the actors with insufficient material to build their characters' motivations. Helena Bonham-Carter comes across as too feisty and ornery to suit my personal taste in Ophelias, but her mad scenes are nonetheless deeply affecting. Paul Scofield is a soft-spoken, purgatorial Ghost whose impact proves no less powerful for being restrained. Ian Holm's busy-bee Polonius is not so much malicious as enormously irritating, as he should be, I suppose, mixing the devil's own pride with a fawning servility towards his sovereign&#8213;-Alan Bates doing a finely calibrated ""bloat king"" Claudius.  The latter is an interpretation for which I usually care little, as it runs the risk of lessening the danger the character should pose to our protagonist, but it works well here as performed by one of Britain's most seasoned performers.  Kudos, too, for Nathaniel Parker's endearing Laertes, who proves a worthy mirror-image for Hamlet's faltering will-to-revenge; one can see the poor man's fury, shame, pity and befuddlement, all in the space of a moment, particularly in the engrossingly staged final swordplay with Hamlet.

Special mention, I think, needs to be made of Glenn Close's Gertrude.  In spite of her occasionally off-putting Brunhilde-ish get-ups, she is primo throughout.  She is also the first actress, in my viewing experience, to nail the poisoning scene.  No delicately swooning Gertrude this, as is so common even with the finest actresses.  Her Gertrude's death is not only *not* pretty, as they say, it's just about what one would expect, if one really thinks about it, from a fast-acting ""potent poison"" capable of reducing an otherwise vibrant woman to a lump of worm food in the space of a couple of minutes.  As someone who has worked in hospitals with the very sick and dying, all I can say is, ""Yes.""

Least favorite scene: Ophelia's overtly challenging interchange with her father upon Laertes' departure.  In response to Polonius's command that she no longer see Hamlet, Ophelia spouts off with a perfectly sarcastic ""I shall obey, my Lord.""  To my way of thinking, any young woman (especially in that day and age) strong enough to stand up to her paterfamilias in such a ballsy manner should have the whatsis to keep a good grip on her wits when the obnoxious old so-and-so is later killed.  The whole episode came across (to me) as an ill-advised and anachronistic concession to the ravenous demands of feminist criticism, and certainly proved a source of cognitive dissonance vis-a-vis Ophelia's later unraveling.

Favorite scene: The Hamlet-Gertrude ""shenting scene,"" in which an enraged Hamlet mimics ""making love over the nasty sty"" on top of his own pole-axed mother.  For Hamlets, this scene is like the tenor's big aria at the climax of an opera; which means that to be fully satisfying, the Hamlet in question must have had the good sense to check himself till now; must have saved something for the finale.  Gibson, in keeping with his legendary ability to project rage on screen (think of the revenge-of-his-wife scene in Braveheart-&#8213;yikes!) does just that, and the result, when he finally lets fly here, is a doozy: It takes little imagination on the part of the audience to understand why Gertrude is hysterical with fear that her son is about to kill her, perhaps even rape her.

But that's still not the (pardon me) climax, for a second later Close manages a one-eighty that few actresses could navigate:  She vises her out-of-control son in a violent lip-lock, and it is Hamlet's turn to be shocked nearly out of his skin.

Okay, so maybe the whole Oedipal thing has been done to death in the last fifty years of Hamlet productions.  Goodness knows I've often wished to see just one Closet Scene which didn't end up in Gertrude's bed, with Gertrude's robes falling sexily off her shoulders as her son tosses her about; but in these folks' skillful hands the effect is grisly rather than titillating.  This is something of a ghost story, after all, and we should come away just a little freaked out.

I'm reminded of the cover of the program for the Tygre's Heart Shakespeare Company's 1997 production of Hamlet, which read:

""Father dies. Mother marries uncle. Dead father visits son.  Son plots revenge.  Stepfather plots sons death.  Mother is poisoned.  Son is poisoned.  Dying son stabs stepfather...Hamlet:  Suddenly your family seems normal.""

Now if only, if only, this had been a nice, plump three-hour Hamlet, complete with ""Rogue and peasant slave"" and ""O how all occasions"" speeches left intact...",1122508800,15,9518,5.17328990228013

I really, really, really got behind Gibson as the Prince in this one, and I thought Paul Scofield as the ghost was magnificent - his scene with Hamlet on the battlement is so intimate - a real father/son talk.

For those who know the play, some of the textual cuts and re-arrangements may be startling -it's odd to hear Hamlet tell Ophelia ""get thee to a nunnery"" in the middle of the Mousetrap scene, for instance.  I also found myself feeling frustrated that I didn't get to see Gibson do some of the speeches and soliloquies which were cut --  ""How all occasions do inform against me"" for example.

422428,4,6302096243,"Franco Zeffirelli's (""The Taming Of The Shrew,"" ""Romeo And Juliet,"" ""Jesus Of Nazareth,"" ""Othello"") third stab at transferring Shakespeare to the screen works very well, with the casting of Mel Gibson (""Mad Max,"" ""Lethal Weapon"" and pre-""The Passion Of The Christ"" noteriety) in the role formerly owned by Sir Laurence Olivier (and rightly so; see my review on his ""Hamlet,"" arguably the best interpretation of one of the Bard's  timeless [and most quoted] tragedies) and redone 5 years later by Kenneth Branagh as a full-bloodied treatment, explaining its 3 hour 22 minute running time, combined with a dream cast (and a lot of little additions, which were well-chosen and expertly done by the contemporary master of William Shakespeare, Kenneth Branagh, the director of ""Henry V"" and
""Dead Again."" Joining the ""Lethal Weapon"" star are Glenn Close (""The Big Chill""), Paul Scofield (""A Man For All Seasons""), Alan Bates, Ian Holm, Michael Maloney (who would be cast as Roderigo opposite Kenneth Branagh and Laurence Fishburne in Oliver Parker's ""Othello"" [see my review of Olivier's ""stage"" version of the tragedy, though he only starred in it] and who Branagh would cast as Laertes in HIS 3-hour version of ""Hamlet"" [a proper homage to Sir Laurence Olivier and his classic version of the play; see my review on that one as well] 5 years later), Nathaniel Parker (who would be cast as Cassio in his brother's version of ""Othello"" 4 years later) and Helena Bonham-Carter.

Zeffirelli intended this movie as a homage to Sir Laurence Olivier (who had died 2 years prior to this movie) and it works pretty well, for the most part. What I was slightly uncomfortable with was Zeffirelli's misplacing a lot of lines and in one scene, he gives one of Hamlet's lines to the Ghost. Also, Helena Bonham-Carter DID NOT convince me as Ophelia. She was too dull and unreal, whereas Jean Simmons (who had immortalized the role in Olivier's version) and Kate Winslet (who did an acceptable job in Kenneth Branagh's uncut, epic revisionist reworking of ""Hamlet"") were good in the role, with Jean Simmons being the BEST Ophelia ever, that's why she was nominated for Best Actress in 1948 (she didn't win-what a shame). Ian Holm said his lines too quickly, not slowly as I expected him to, in  a scene with him, Laertes and Ophelia. But then again, I'm more used to Felix Aylmer and Richard Briers' interpretations of the role and I think that they did better jobs than Holm in their respective versions of ""Hamlet"" (both done by great directors, actors, text-editors, producers AND stars of all their versions of the Bard's work) as Polonius.

The rest of the cast, however, was excellent. The scene where Hamlet confronts his mother was very well done, but Olivier and Branagh heightened the scene to better lengths to create even more emotional intensity and suspense that the scene required.

I recommend this version just to pass the time, but it's ideal as a teaching tool for 12th-grade English teachers (I recommend showing Olivier's version first, then Branagh's and finally this version). Despite the film's ""PG"" rating, there was really nothing objectionable in the movie. Only what the play called for.

The Best Versions Of ""Hamlet"" Are:

#1 Sir Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh. Both were so good that I can't decide which one was the best. See my reviews on these versions for more information.

#2 Franco Zeffirelli. This one was alright. It started out alright with a scene not in the play, but should've then progressed to the actual beginning of the play, where a guard cries out ""Who's there?"" ""Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself!!"" That scene scares the hell out of you because you're sitting quietly and then-bam!!, you almost jump out of your skin. In short, that scene sets the tone for the rest of the play. HUGE blunder on Zeffirelli's part to omit that scene. It also misplaced a lot of lines (and cut others that I think should've been put in), such as the line where Hamlet says to Ophelia ""Get thee to a nunnery, why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?""; that line was supposed to have occurred in THAT scene, NOT where it was placed in the film. This version struggles between cutting out too much or too little. Kenneth Branagh would remedy that 5 years later with his uncut version of the tragedy, making HIS version a more fitting homage to Sir Laurence Olivier, as several of the actors (aside from him) had performed ""Hamlet"" on stage/or on film many times on different occasions. However, Zeffirelli's take on ""Hamlet"" IS faithful to the play and THAT's what I was looking for. The setup for the final act duel was the same as in Olivier and Branagh's versions, only that the denouement in Branagh's version was more violent than the denoument of the previous two faithful versions and stuck more closely to the play, with Branagh throwing in a few harmless touches of his own...to very good effect.

He goes on to suggest that actors need to ""1) Know the script, 2) Know what the script means"".

What script is ""Me Just This Guy"" referring to? It's worth reading a scholarly edition of Hamlet (& other plays) to learn of the difficulties in agreeing on a definitive script. In the case of Hamlet, 'pitch' is used in one early version of the play (Quarto 2), and is the preferred use in many published editions (e.g. Cambridge). 'Pith' is used in other early editions (e.g. Folio), and appears in other modern versions of the play (e.g. Oxford).

Now, I saw 3 versions of Hamlet as part of my in-depth study of the play for school. This one was the second-best. The acting is not bad; Gibson's Hamlet is very physical and very angry. Olivier's was introverted, quiet, calm. Branagh's (the definitive Hamlet) is an effective mixture of these two extremes. This ""Hamlet"" movie is an enjoyable telling of the story, and perhaps easier to sit through for those who don't want four hours of Shakespearean dialogue, but it's far from being a masterpiece and definitely not the full, perfect rendition of the show I'd assume people would want.

422452,5,6302096243,"I simply loved this movie, even when I realized the subplot with Fortinbras was effectively eliminated, for I also realized I didn't mind one whit.

With the exception of a scene between Hamlet and Ophelia that contained no dialogue, which was, in my opinion, not well-done at all, Mel Gibson was superb in his portrayal of Hamlet, a far cry from the overblown pomposity of many classical Shakespearean actors whose over-the-top boomings of ""to beeeee...or not to beeeee...."" completely demolished the introspection required of many of Hamlet's soliloquys.  In contrast, Gibson's performance conveyed much more effectively the internal dialogue that both pacified and plagued Hamlet.

Helena Bonham-Carter's performance as Ophelia was exquisite and ranks up there with her performance as Lucy Honeychurch in ""A Room With a View"".  I can't imagine anyone else better suited to play this most tragic character of the entire play.

Alan Bates, Glenn Close, and Nathaniel Parker were perfectly cast, as well.  It was his portrayal of Laertes that persuaded me to also seek out Nathaniel Parker's later movie, ""Far From the Madding Crowd"", which I also strongly recommend.

Beautiful camera work, gorgeous scenery, and acting that didn't seem like the stereotypical Shakespearean overblown pontificating that puts off so many would-be fans of Shakespeare.  Heartily recommend this movie.",1102982400,5,1382,5.455399061032864

However, I take issue with the excessive dramatism. Subdued shadows of danish mist are replaced here by italian exhuberance. Olivier's hesitant progress towards doom is replaced here by well intended overacting - nicely done, of course, we have great actors in this movie, but overacting nevertheless. Zefirelli did a nice job on The taming of the shrew and Romeo and Juliet, but Hamlet requires, I believe, a more nordic introspection. Too bad Bergman never did attempt to film it.",1102291200,,651,5.392156862745098

Sadly, Mel Gibson was a disappointment to me.  He did give some force to the character that many others have lacked, but I kept feeling that large chunks of his interpretation and his delivery had been perhaps overly influenced by the 1964 Richard Burton performance, not a very well-known version today because it exists only as a fairly rough filming of the stage play.  However, the Burton version is available on DVD, and I recommend it not only for the excellence of the performances but also for an interesting comparison with the Mel Gibson interpretation.",1100217600,,700,4.760330578512397
422455,2,6302096243,"Dear Mr. Gibson,

I realize that you have nine children and a wife to provide for, but is nothing sacred to you?  I don't mind you exploiting and over-dramatizing violence, religion or even Scottish history, but please, stay away from Shakespeare in the future.  Though not even your director, Mr. Zeffirelli, will not criticize your flailing arms and agape mouth to represent fear and/or confusion, it does not mean it is good acting.  Just because you have a knack for pouting and making puppy eyes does not mean that you should resort to making them in nearly every scene.  I am disappointed in your director for not telling you to use some real acting, for he has made acceptable Shakespeare films in the past.  Remember also that there is a time and place for staring off into the distance, but usually one can tell the person is thinking about something, whereas you basically look like you've forgotten your next line and are staring blankly ahead - a dear in headlights, if you will.  I have also never met anyone who does it quite so often as you did in this film.

Again, I beg of you, Mr. Gibson, stick to violence, religion, comedy - even historical fiction - just stay away from Shakespeare.  Let the British do Shakespeare, for they are his countrymen after all.  Shakespeare was not meant for Hollywood, and I fear Mr. Zeffirelli forgot this when he directed Hamlet.  Shakespeare deserves a bit more depth and reflection - especially Hamlet - than the typical Hollywood actors/directors/producers can provide and you, Mr. Gibson, are very typical.",1100131200,10,1562,4.791044776119403
422456,5,6302096243,"I both read the play as well as watched the movie version of it with Mel Gibson. I found that the movie was easier to follow yet the book covered more detail. I noticed this especially during the part where Ophelia has lost her father at her lover's hand and has now gone mad from the pain of it all. My 16 year old son watched it with me and found this part to be extremely humorous. While it is a revenge tragedy, the way they showed it had a comical effect during different parts. While finding it sad that she had lost her mind, he couldn't help but giggle when Ophelia runs her hand down the front of the guard and he does little to protest what she is doing. It's good that another guard comes along to escort the ""Lady"" inside the castle where she confronts the Queen next. Helen Bonham-Carter did a very good job playing Ophelia in all her nuances.

  Hamlet returns to find Ophelia too late to save her from her madness and finds himself in a duel with her brother Laertes because of having killed their father Polonius by accident. During the course of time that he tried to find a way to deal with his promise to his ghostly father, he makes some bad choices in his life. Perhaps if he had dealt with his Uncle when he first learns he killed his father, it would have saved a lot of other people's lives, including his own mother's life. However, he didn't have any proof to be able to do that in the beginning.

  The scene where Claudius was praying and Hamlet refrained...Hamlet knew his father was in torment because he was killed with ""all his sins on his head"" he was spending time in hell during the day and walking through the castle ""for a time"" during the nights. He wasn't allowed to say any details of his torment but we can tell it must be horriffic.

  With Claudius praying at the time that Hamlet had an opportunity to kill him, he stopped because he knew it would serve no justice as Claudius would not be dying with his sins on his head as his father had. The more I understand this story, the more I see the intelligence Hamlet had in the choices and actions he portrayed.

  His idea to use the players to re-enact the scene was inspiring to say the least. If he held any doubts that he had imagined the entire scene with his father talking to him after his death, they were put to rest after seeing his uncle's reaction to the play. After Hamlet's hesitation in taking action against his uncle, he had no trouble taking his life after his mother Gertrude died from the poison his uncle had meant for him. The final scene is truly tragic when it doesn't end with the ""bad guy"" losing and the ""good guy"" winning. In this revenge tragedy, not only does the uncle die in the end, but also Hamlet, his mother, and Ophelia's brother Laertes.

  Where the movie ends, the book continues. Hamlet's last words to Horatio in the movie, ""the rest is silence"" yet the book show the rest that was written where the English Ambassadors arrived too late. Hamlet is seen as royalty in all its colors and the word is to spread for all to know. I wondered at the end, who took over once the family was all dead?

  I actually watched this movie three times. The first time it was catch as catch can as far as understanding everything, the second time was easier with the sub-titles, the third time was pure enjoyment since I really understood it and could sit back and enjoy the full impact. I always shyed away from these types of movies before but after this one I have now ordered a few more.

The film is a fairly good rendition of Hamlet by William Shakespeare. So many good actors are in this film I can't mention them all, but to name the tops are Gibson, Glenn Close, Iam Holm (Frodo Baggins from the LOTR films and Bilbo from the BBC audio), and Helena Bonham Carter.

A quick synopsis: The King of Denmark dies at the hand of his brother, who is having an affair with the queen. He is made king. Prince Hamlet is visited by his father's ghost, who tells him what has transpired. Hamlet takes it upon himself to right the wrong, and let his father rest in peace. In the meantime, he loses his mind, and everybody dies. Typical Shakespeare.

However, Mel Gibson has a difficult task, he is no Shakespearan actor. Though he walks the walk of a soldier, his dialogues are not well done. The soliloques are terrible compared to the Branagh version. The best one is from the Olivier one though that one was done in 1948, it won the best picture and best actor. Gibson does not have the polish and his interactions with Ophelia are not well done. He should stick to the type of roles that he is best suited for and leave these to better actors.

The sad part is that he has an image now and people see this version as the Olivier version is not easily available. If people view that they will realize the difference in acting quality of an amateur Hamlet vs a true Hamlet. People who adore Gibson must shed that image and see the other versions before making up their minds. As a true actor, especially in this role, he does not hold a candle to Lawrence Olivier.",1093910400,3,1063,4.395939086294416

But watching his work in action is a new experience.  Where, for me, reading Hamlet was difficult and not very pleasant, watching it come alive on the screen was mesmerizing.  Shakespeare certainly knew human nature, and was able to mix the entire rainbow of human emotions with the interplay between complex characters to form outstanding, and timeless, stories.

I found this version of Hamlet to be quite good, and Mel Gibson suprisingly good at the title role, if you can keep up with the obscure language.  Even if the language proves difficult, it is still easy enough to follow along with the story by the context of the action.  The story is shortened considerably from the full script, it would have been nice if a ""Director's Cut"" might have been made that contained an extended version.  This movie would make a great film introduction to the works of Shakespeare, and for the student of Shakespeare a comparison to longer versions (such as Kevin Kline's, or the Branagh version) would certainly be enlightening.",1093132800,3,1162,4.862944162436548

Mel Gibson has some fine acting chops. His portrayal of Hamlet is energetic, intense, and believable. He brings a much needed shot of adrenaline to a play that is often portrayed as a stuffy, ""masterpiece theatre"" type production. It does take a little while to become accustomed to the shakespearian dialect, but if you're already familiar with the story you should have no difficulty. If you are new to Shakespeare, I would suggest veiwing it at least twice: once with subtitles (to get the dialog), and then again without them so you can simply enjoy the performances. For fans of Gibson, I would recommend this because it will certainly show that he's not just 'that guy from the lethal weapon movies'. For college students or literature professors I would recommend it because it remains faithful to the play without being dull or stuffy.",1091491200,3,1022,4.747191011235955

The Olivier version is more accurate to the stage version but the camera techiniques are over-blown and hokey (circling the swords before the duel to see which one is tipped, it made me dizzy). the Branagh version, while creative in it's set up (modernizing it to imerial Russia), and using the entire text, complete with Prince Fortinbras of Norway, is SO long and SO over-acted (especially on the part of Branagh) that i needed a nap after i saw it. and i choose not even to dignify the Ethan Hawke version it was so terrible.
This one is my favorite, all the scenes which are cut aren't necessary for the forwarding of the plot in my humble opinion (the opening scene with the palace guards meeting the dead kingis cut yet horatio's explaination of this happening later in the movie is sufficient). Gibson chooses to play Hamlet as insane (that decision is left to the director) and as i am in the camp that Hamlet IS insane, you could also see why i favor this version. Glenn Close is EXCELLENT as Gertrude as is Helena Bonham-Carter as Ophelia.

It throws all over attempts into shadow, including the great Lawrence Olivier and certainly Kenneth Branaugh or Ethan Hawke.  So often the female characters are reduced to cardboard mock-ups of feminine ideals of the Shakespearean age.  Not here!  Ofelia and Gertrude have souls and minds to probe, filled with as many dark secrets as Hamlet himself.  I could never say enough about the caliber of this film.

Gibson's is very much stripped down to focusing on the three main character's. It does loose a lot by this device, but it does gain considerably in that the viewer doesn't have to shift through all the sub-plots. Brannaugh's, however is far more complete & I would consider it far more the best "" study "" version of the play. If you've read the play ( & this is the reason I give it 5 stars ), Gibson's version is great beause you can fill in the blanks quite easily & nothing is lost. The Ghost is by far better in Gibson's version ( remember, this is not a ghost in the modern sense, so it's important not to judge by appearences ), & the interplay between them in their first meeting is just amazing. However, the politics of the play suffers badly, in my opinion, becuase many of the characters in the sub-plots are missing, especially Polonius' machinations....however, he certainly DIES better in Gibson's version. I personally like this version & I am impressed with all the actors. If this had been the entire play, I think it would definitely have given Brannaugh's version a run for it's money, but being so stripped down, I feel the actuall story suffers greatly.

The film is also very good in it's setting; a genuinely dark, brooding, primitive castle. Quite accurate, given the historical setting of the Hamlet legend.
Unfortunely, the editors cut so much from the play that whole, important themes, themes that speak towards the very nature of a given character (especially Hamlet himself), are absent. Even a very important solliliquiy (sp?) of Hamlet's is cut(""My thoughts be bloody, or none else"").
Now, I realize that most productions of Hamlet have cuts; this was true even in Shakespeare's time. However, the slash-and-burn type cuts in this Hamlet leave out far too much that contributes to a good understanding of both the main character and important secondary characters.

422515,3,6302096243,"We all know the story so there is no need for me to summarize.
It's not a bad rendition but there are a few problems. It suffers mainly from a strong Ophelia and a weak Horatio. Ophelia, as played by Helena Bonham Carter, is played too strong to believe she would go mad and kill herself. Nowhere, in the movie, is there any indication she is ruled by her father, brother and whomever else would try. She herself, as written, is a weak person and needs to be played weakly.
Horatio, as Shakespeare wrote him, is the only one Hamlet trusts. Yet, nearly 75% of his lines are cut and he spends the majority of the movie looking concerned but standing around doing nothing.
The pacing really stumbles until about halfway into the movie. The best part is the dueling sequence. The rest of the time, the pacing doesn't quite make it.
I was also disappointed the ""From this time forth, my thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth"" soliloquy was cut. It, along with the ""To be or not to be"" speech are two of the most important moments of Hamlet's progression.
Gibson delivered the ""To be or not to be"" soliloquy extremely well, fortunately. His Hamlet is most believable after he sees the ghost.
However, if you have not seen this version, be prepared for one thing: the director suffers from what I call the ""Olivier Complex."" Just because Olivier played Hamlet with an Oedipus complex doesn't mean he was right. When Hamlet confronts his mother in her closet, it is an extremely annoying scene in the movie. Much better to portray him as a son who loves his mother as a MOTHER, not as a lover.
Otherwise, the scenery is gorgeous, the costuming was nice, other than Glenn Close's operatic braids--I kept expecting her to break out in a Wagner opera--and the rest of the casting is quite good. Ian Holm plays an excellent Polonius.
All in all, it wasn't bad. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad.",1080777600,17,1884,4.527859237536657
422516,4,6302096243,"I like almost everything about this 'Hamlet'. Gibson brings a physical sense to the lead role that I've never seen before, and it works. He's always done well playing unstable, potentially explosive characters - face it, that's Hamlet.
Ophelia worked well, too. She seemed to struggle, in the play scene, placed in a grown-up situation and not quite sure how to act grown up. She later fell back into over-dramatic snits and weepy romanticism. That sure looked like a teenage girl to me. I was interested by Ophelia's choices in clothing - gray, in many scenes, and the least colorful of all the costumes on stage. I felt that, if she'd hold still for a moment, she'd simply vanish against the gray stone of Elsinore's walls. Perhaps she wasn't so different from a modern girl affecting a black-on-black wardrobe - both trying to attract attention and to avoid it at the same time.
Elsinore and it surrounding country-side were wonderful, and almost became characters themselves. Brooding, stark, and solid, it seemed almost to ignore the player's doings inside, as if it were above such transient events. I was a bit disappointed, however, that the castle was so bare. Castles were cold and echoic - any king that could afford the labor involved in building a castle could also afford carpets, wall hangings, and other furnishings to make it look lived in. Elsinore didn't look like a working structure, more like a near-ruin with strangers wandering around inside.
I was careful to say that I like the acting - vivid physicality really brought the characters to life for me. I wasn't so thrilled with the recitation of the script, though. Elizabethan English is very nearly a foreign language, with a rhythm and flow of its own. Gibson, in particular, sounded as if he had learned the lines without learning the language. Lacking the cues of meter and sound, I sometimes found the listening hard.
There are lots of good renderings of Hamlet, and this is another good one. If the actors could have seemed more comfortable with the language, it might have been great.",1080000000,3,2067,4.858356940509915

Originally, Shakespeare's plays were intended for the masses.  At the time they were looked at like Adam Sandler movies are today.  What's wrong with making his greatest work more accessible to contemporary audiences and possibly setting off a few sparks of interest in folks who may have otherwise been content to spend their $10 on a Happy Gilmore sequel instead?
I was an English major in college and spent a lot of time that first semester `decoding the bard'.  It wasn't until my sophomore year that I was able to truly immerse myself in the language and enjoy Shakespeare for what it is.  Had Gibson's Hamlet been around I may have been able to get into the waters a bit quicker.  His performance was riveting and the rest of the cast was simply amazing.  I fell in love with Helena Bonham Carter's Ophelia and nearly cried when she...  Wait!  Spoiler there.  (Yes, Shakespeare can be spoiled for the uninitiated.)
One last thing I would like to point out to those who complained about Mel being far too animated and crazed as Hamlet.  Melancholia was considered a medical term in Shakespeare's time.  It was a generic term used to describe a variety of psychological maladies, which included mood swings and possibly even schizophrenia.  Just because Gibson chose to go in a different direction from more traditional interpretations doesn't make him wrong.  He may have been closer to The Bard's vision of the character than Olivier or Richard Burton.  (Maybe.)
Regardless, this is at the very least a very entertaining interpretation of a great classic.  Now let's talk about why Brannaugh's uncut, super, four hour edition has not been released...  What fools these mortals be.",1078272000,23,1717,4.909722222222222

It's no surprise that he would play Hamlet.  He's been playing Hamlet in just about every movie he's ever made.
I gave it three stars on the strength of Helena Bonham Carter's Ophelia, but I would be a shame if anyone watched this thinking it was a valid representation of Shakespeare's finest work.  As an introduction, it may work, but only as an introduction.  The play has so much more depth than this version indicates. Watch it in addition to reading the text and watching a live performance and even Branagh's film.

If I talk to anyone about checking out one of the Bard's plays, I always point them this way.  Snobs may sniff away, but this is a HAMLET for an audience looking for drama--the same folks who stood in the pit of the Globe 400 years ago.
Mel Gibson is one of those rare actors who brings an emotional intensity to a role that can overwhelm his considerable physical presence.  That's definitely on display in HAMLET.  His grief and rage and confusion threaten to push him over the edge, even as he plots to expose his father's murderer, Hamlet's own uncle.
The rest of the cast is wonderful: Glenn Close, the late Alan Bates, Helena Bonham Carter.  It was a thrill to see the great Shakespearean actor Paul Scofield as the ghost of Hamlet's father.
Hollywood and the Theatre both owe Franco Zefferilli a debt of gratitude: he introduced Shakespeare to new generations of fans (who didn't watch his ROMEO AND JULIET in high school?) and connected the Bard to modern events (casting Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton during Le Scandal in THE TAMING OF THE SHREW was inspired).

The students watch the Branagh version first and then watch Mel Gibson's metamorphosis into the being of Hamlet.  The general consensus is that the Gibson version is far superior to the Brannaugh version simply because Mel brings more depth to the character of Hamlet via the  juxtaposed emotions of quiet contemplation, stinging wit,  and raving anger.  Branagh's Hamlet tends to be steadily caustic in nature and speaks (shouts) all of the lines at mind whirling pace! Gibson's delivery of famous soliloquies is natural and laced with appropriate emotion, which allows the watcher to completely comprehend each scene.  Mel Gibson does not play the role of Hamlet - Mel Gibson BECOMES Hamlet!  Truly Mr. Gibson's portrayal of the Prince of Denmark is one of the pinnacles his acting career.  To those who scoff at the notion of Mad Maxx playing Hamlet, I have a word of advice - ""Watch it, and you'll change your mind!""
  While this film has been roundly criticized by so-called movie ""experts"" due to Zeffirelli's cutting and rearranging of certain lines and scenes, it would do those ""experts"" well to learn a little about Elizabethan theatre.  An average Elizabethan audience NEVER saw the entire play all at once as they relied on natural lighting in the theatres of their day.  The Elizabethan directors (including the Bard himself) had to eliminate scenes in much the same way as did Zeffirelli.  So, upon closer examination, it appears as though Brannaugh's version of Hamlet is the less ""correct"" version.  Don't get me wrong...I still admire Brannaugh's Hamlet.  I am just weary of the constant criticism Mel Gibson's portrayal garners.
  This version of Hamlet also contains incredible performances by Helena Bonham-Carter as the naive, young Ophelia and Glenn Close as a less than virtuous Gertrude.  The scenery and costuming is absolutely captivating!  Finally, the portrayal of the ghost, a role which Shakespeare wrote for himself to perform, is carried out brilliantly by Paul Scofield who is forceful yet subdued.  We are left to wonder, as would the Elizabethan audience, whether this ghost is pure or a devilish incarnation - which is THE KEY to what drives the plot of the play Hamlet.

I also feel that Gibson makes a far better Hamlet then Kenneth Branagh.  If you love the play then you will be swept off your feet by this film.",1071100800,3,429,4.195121951219512
422554,5,6302096243,"The movie opens with the funeral of Hamlet's father, the king of Denmark. Both Hamlet(played with brilliance by Mel Gibson) and his mother, Gertrude(Glenn Close), queen of Denmark, are in deep mourning over the king's death.
The next scene shows King Claudius(Alan Bates), who was the former king's nephew, announcing to the inhabitants of Elsinore(the castle where the action takes place) of his marriage with Gertrude, not two months after Hamlet's father's death. Hamlet did not like this turn of events, as he was still deeply in mourning over the death of his father the king, and thought that it was not proper that his mother married so soon afterwards. As he put it, ""Frailty, thy name is woman!""
While Hamlet is atop a tower of Elsinore, his good friend Horatio arrives, accompanied by several soldiers. Horatio informs Hamlet that he saw what he believed to be Hamlet's father the night before. Hamlet, taken aback by this news, decided to serve watch with Horatio and the other soldiers that night.
When serving watch, he saw an apparition which did indeed appear to be his father. Though in shock, he followed it as it beckoned him, despite his companions' opposition.
When the ghost(played by Paul Scofield) spoke to Hamlet, he told Hamlet that he was murdered by Hamlet's uncle, Claudius, who poured poison into his ear as he slept in the garden. And so, Hamlet begins to plot the demise of his uncle. The best means of which he should do it, he decides, is by feigning madness.
The verdict: A huge success. Directed by Franco Zeffirelli of Romeo and Juliet, this movie was everything Hamlet was intended to be, and perhaps a little more. As someone who has read the play, I know which scenes can be removed without sacrificing quality, and, while it wasn't completely accurate to the play, the changes they did make either did not harm it or made it better.
All in all, this movie was a huge success, and I definitely recommend it to any fan of Shakespeare. And remember, ""To be or not to be: that is the question.""

This is a very realistic and natural version set during 13th Century (the period Shakespeare set his play in). The acting is amazing; Mel Gibson and Glen Close both give the best performances of their careers and everyone else is also fantastic.

422558,5,6302096243,"The decision to watch a filmed version of HAMLET is roughly comparable to choosing whether to vacation in the Bahamas or Aruba.  You'll get a tan from both but the ambience will surely vary.  Olivier's HAMLET is classic, introspective, and hesitant.  Branagh's is fully texted and purposefully allegorical.  But,if one wishes to see a more decisive Dane, who combines this sense of deliberation with charm, humor, and exaggerated violence, then one would do well to turn to Mel Gibson's Hamlet.  Director Franco Zeffirelli has lopped off much of the original text, excising those scenes that were of more import to Shakespeare's audience but retaining the rest.
The viewer who knows the play well can tell from the opening scene that Zeffirelli chooses not to begin with the conversation between Marcellus and Bernardo, whose dialogue about the ghost of Hamlet's father foreshadows the imminent appearance of a ghost whose 'reality' in the context of both contemporary and modern audiences has been endlessly debated. Such divergences between the original text and this filmed version do not detract from the visual and visceral power of Zeffirelli's vision. Hamlet, as Gibson plays him, is not the meek and indecisive Olivier, who seems unsure until the closing scenes as to what lengths he will go to eliminate the rottenness that is now Denmark.  Gibson's Hamlet is more closely attuned to the printed version who can seem indecisive in one breath but violently purposeful in the next.  One of the most enduring enigmas in a play that is riddled with them is the enduring controversy as to whether Hamlet is seeking to cleanse Denmark's rottenness under the claim that he is a legitimate avenger of Heaven as the ghost seems to imply or he is simply seeking a personal vendetta against the man who killed his father and bedded his mother.  Gibson makes it clear in the scene when he encounters his uncle, the now king, engrossed in prayer, and has the long-awaited opportunity to kill him with impunity.  Hamlet decides not to since death while praying might still admit King Claudius to Heaven.  For Hamlet, such a death and pleasant afterlife, is not punishment enough.  Hamlet will wait to dispatch the King in a manner that will surely doom his soul to eternal torment in Hell. Thus, Gibson is fixed in his interpretation of a prince who resists being a pawn in a game of political chess, while all the while transforming himself from pawn to chess king as he masterfully moves the rooks, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, to their undeserved deaths in England.
Glenn Close, as Gertrude, Hamlet's mother, has been unfairly pilloried as being too youthful and attractive to be convincing as a woman who ought not have remarried quite so soon after her husband's death.  Her performance is, nevertheless, quite riveting and is probably closer to the dilemma that Shakespeare envisioned as he wrote of a woman who chose to overlook the obvious in favor or re-establishing a moral center for a country that was in turmoil and could not turn to a moody, brooding prince for salvation.  With each heart-rending word from Hamlet that pushes her nose in the slime of real world grubby politics, Gertrude stands revealed as a woman who was more simple in her life and philosophy than simple-minded in her acumen.  It is no fault of her own, as Hamlet so viciously accuses, that she has failed to see what to him is so painfully obvious.
Since this HAMLET is a truncated version of the text, much of the grist for the scholarly mill has been thankfully eliminated. Shakespeare's contemporaries might have exulted in and commiserated with the long dramatic advice that Hamlet gives to the passing troupe of actors, the purpose of which was to present on a microcosmic scale within the play-in-a-play what Hamlet was to accomplish on the macrocosmic.  For modern audiences, such digressions would surely have diluted their interest.  What Zeffirelli and Gibson do manage is to present a two hour howl of pain of a man who is caught in a box, locked with a key that can double as a self-immolating sword. For many of Shakespeares' heroes--as well as his villains--the choice of their use of a life-saving key or a life-ending samurai dagger is what continually drags audiences to eternally reenact the angst of his best and worst.  This HAMLET does that as well as any other of Shakespeare's plays.",1044057600,10,4388,4.916102841677943
422559,5,6302096243,"Mel Gibson's portrayal of Hamlet is wonderful.  (Course, I'd say that about ANYTHING he does)  He brings out Hamlet's darkness and makes you mourn right along with him.  He also makes the spoken language of Shakespeare clearly understood which makes for easy viewing of the story that is so masterfully written.
And who doesn't love to hate that mother of Hamlet, portrayed by Glen Close.  She does a wonderful job as well.

422560,3,6302096243,"Mel Gibson's 1990 version of argueably the greatest of William Shakespeare's works unquestionably has its flaws, but certainly holds it own among myriad other versions of the play.  Please, don't pay too much attention to those who would attempt to compare Gibson's Hamlet to any of his action roles; Hamlet is perhaps the most complex intellectual character in all of the English language.  It is unfair to compare him to a futuristic road warrior or a Three Stooges-loving, suicidal cop.

The reason why Gibson was cast as Hamlet in this version is simple: he helped cast himself.  Why?  For the opportunity to establish himself as an actor with serious talent, not just serious sex appeal.  His Hamlet possessed more than enough of the emotional depth and range necessary for the role, and Gibson also brought an intangible element: his own charisma.  As we do with Jack and Rose in the movie _Titanic_, we truly rooted for this Hamlet, despite knowledge of the inevitable conclusion.

Gibson looks uncomfortable at first (nervous?) and starts out slowly; tentatively.  He finds his acting feet soon thereafter, and by the end of the film, his presence seems to upstage that of the other actors.  So while it is a somewhat unbalanced performance in that regard, Gibson's physical communication of his torment was both dynamic and convincing.  The explication of information during his monologues was far superior to Derek Jacobi's BBC version in the late '70's, and in my opinion, over the decades and the evolution of acting methods and styles, almost supercedes Olivier's 1948 version.  If you can overlook the fact that Mel Gibson is a very grown-up version of Hamlet, then his rendition, while flawed, is still an effort worthy of The Bard.

His supporting cast was very well chosen, with the exception perhaps of Glenn Close as Hamlet's mother, Gertrude, who must have been eight years old when Hamlet was born!  Helena Bonham Carter was simply outstanding as Ophelia... the madness of Shakespeare's characters is a difficult state to emulate, and the heartrending sadness she bears is palpable.

Franco Zeffirelli is a longtime Shakespeare veteran, most memorably for directing the 1968 version of _Romeo and Juliet_, considered by many to be the best film adaptation of any of Shakespeare's works.  He paints an atmosphere in Elsinore as cold as the tension between Hamlet and his uncle, but perhaps tries a little too hard to make things fresh by infusing awkward new camera angles and an unbalanced (and sometimes nonexistant) complimentary music score.

If you're thinking about buying Gibson's Hamlet simply because you are a big Mel fan, then by all means, you should do so.  You'll see a side of Mel that you hadn't seen prior to 1990, and in many ways, haven't seen since (_Braveheart_ was a triumph, but it's simply a different genre than Shakespeare).  But if you're looking for the best version of Hamlet, and you have to choose between this version and Kenneth Branagh's 1996 version, I would strongly suggest Branagh's.  It is a full-text version (excellent for students) while Gibson's has cut scenes, re-organized scenes, and missing characters.  Branagh's moves much more swiftly, vividly, and energetically, and although it is set in the 19th century rather than the 15th/16th century, the language still fits snugly in that timeline and in no way affects the plot.  But if you don't have to choose, don't count out Gibson's version one way or the other.  It is definitely worth viewing, and perhaps you'll consider renting both versions before buying.",1042416000,20,3578,5.0476190476190474

The studios need to get with it.  I suspect that the marketing people are asleep at the wheel again as has become typical of our modern age (talk about tragedies).  Our movie makers have become so overly concerned with what Joe 6-pack and the teen aged girls are wanting to be watching that they have forgotten all about what a great film is.

The latter version holds students' attention best due to a judiciously (for the most part) edited script, the Zeffirelli ""pretentious"" style (much of the play let alone the medium of film is about pretense), and the full-blown, ""sincere"" Gibson style.  Branagh is certainly superior in portraying Hamlet's ""antic disposition,"" but younger students and ""first-timers"" are slow to pick up on the play's verbal ironies.  Moreover, Branagh's passionate scenes can seem overplayed because of the theatrical resonance of his tenor timbre.

422582,3,6302096243,"This is an interesting and serviceable Hamlet both different and the same as other Hamlets done in the past. Its abbreviated by half. And unfortunately by necessity characters are altered pretty drastically and you'll never get a feel for the really fascinating and motivations of the lesser characters that are really make the play a great experience when seen in full.  But if you haven't seen the entire version I doubt you will feel deprived.  I guess what makes this version distinctive is Mel Gibson plays Hamlet driven with a measure of rage and aggressiveness that is probably refreshing to people who are used to seeing him as the ""melancholy Dane"".  So this is a pretty good version that tries to retell Hamlet in an original way. This is directed by Franco Zefferelli who in my opinion did the ""definitive"" version of Romeo and Juliet that I doubt will ever be topped. I think he also directed the best of the Jesus movies.  I can't say this is the best Hamlet, the new modern version is pretty good and the Kenneth Branaugh version is really awesome because he really understands every minute of the play. He plays Hamlet as incredibly intelligent and cunning. Hopefully this version will whet your appetite for his full version coming to DVD later this year. Unfortunately B's Hamlet is a very (panoramic) widescreen title that must be just awful in pan and scan and is going to look quite small on a 27 inch tv screen.  This version of Hamlet plays alright on the tv screen because it pretty much stays focused on Hamlet himself and the periphral characters are not nearly as important to this retelling as they are in the full version. The only negative thing I have to say about this version is that everyone is a little bit too crazy. Ophelia becomes totally mad in this version. Hamlet is supposed to be feigning madness and in the real play he plays mad when it serves his purposes. Gibson's Hamlet actually is a little crazy. Sometimes I think this waters down the motivations a little too much. I always have to remind myself watching this that there is only half the time to tell the story so its a pretty competant job.
  If you like this, definitely check out Zefferelli's Romeo and Juliet. And if you have a big big screen TV, Branaugh's Hamlet later in the year when it comes out.",1019952000,3,2306,4.609756097560975
422583,2,6302096243,"When Franco Zefferelli directed his 1968 film of ""Romeo and Juliet,"" the first person he approached to play the male lead was Paul McCartney. The Beatle turned down the offer, but Zefferelli enjoyed a phenomenal success by casting two unknowns with no Shakespearean experience in the title roles. The director doubtless hoped lightning would strike twice by casting the screen's reigning action star in one of the most demanding roles in the Shakespearean canon. The result is a staggeringly ordinary production, but a serviceable primer for those who want to familiarize themselves with the text.
The virtues of the film are many, with fine performances turned in by Helena Bonham Carter as Ophelia, Paul Scofield as the Ghost, and an especially memorable one by Glenn Close as an unusually dense Gertrude. Zefferelli also serves himself well by providing a brilliant and concisely edited screenplay; paring down the length and complications of the text for the masses, while retaining all the key characters and points of the story with the precision of a surgeon.
But the name of the play is ""Hamlet,"" and this production is bogged down by Mel Gibson's lack of imagination or sustained sensitivity in the role. Gibson does not embarrass himself in the manner of Keanu Reeves or Michael Keaton in Kenneth Branaugh's ""Much Ado About Nothing""; indeed in some scenes such as Hamlet's aborted attempt to return to Wittenberg or in his surprisingly touching reading of the ""Alas, Poor Yorick"" speech he is very effective. But this is the first film Hamlet not played by an actor who had already distinguished himself in the role on stage. If Gibson had been serious about wanting to invest himself in the part, he would have challenged himself in a theater production where his movie star clout might have been more easily cast aside. But by throwing himself into a big budget film of the play without any real idea of how to play the role is simply an act of arrogance, and by the time Gibson is seen in the Act V duel grotesquely whooping and stomping like in one of the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies, the film has degenerated into a tiresome Vanity Production.
Zefferelli obviously wanted Gibson because his presence in the role meant that he could raise the money to satisfy his affinity for lavishly ornate sets and costumes. But while this sumptuous rendering served his films of ""Romeo and Juliet"" and the memorable Burton/Taylor ""Taming of the Shrew"" well, ""Hamlet"" is another matter. The most effective films of ""Hamlet"" had simple settings, such as the stark and cold stone Elsinore of Olivier's film or the generic castle set of the magnificent BBC Television production starring Derek Jacobi and Patrick Stewart; unpretentious surroundings that makes the viewer focus on the very human drama that is unfolding in front of them. By overdressing his production, Zefferelli tries to draw attention away from his less than compelling leading man. But, like Cyrano de Bergerac, Hamlet wears his adornments on his soul; and in this production the soul is sadly lacking.",1019779200,4,3065,4.98828125
422584,5,6302096243,"While this is a complex movie that demands your full attention, this has to be one of my favorite Shakespeare plays. It is beautifully acted out in a gorgeous castle filled with tapestries and everything you would imagine a castle to be from the candlelight to the dimly lit spiral staircases.

The most enjoyable scenes are when Hamlet expresses his thoughts in soliloquies and gives insight into what his character is feeling. Mel Gibson becomes Hamlet and I thought this was perhaps some of his best acting ever! Glenn Close is exceptional as Gertrude, the incestuous mother. The uneasiness and distrust in Denmark since King Hamlet's death and Queen Gertrude's remarriage sets the mood for the rest of the movie.

The story begins on the outer ramparts of Elsinore castle. A ghost appears and Hamlet, speaks to his deceased father. The ghost asks Hamlet to revenge his ""most foul, strange, and unnatural murder."" Hamlet then deviously plots a psychological revenge by putting on a play in which a scene portrays the actual murder of his father.

""I'll have grounds
More relative than this-the play's the thing
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King."" -Hamlet, Act 2, 603-605

Once guilt takes hold of the King, the pieces of the puzzle start to fit together and you realize that one immoral action only makes another wrong even more probable.

Throughout the play, Hamlet shows his intellectual superiority and states his case by saying: ""Do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe?"" While he desires to have the upper hand until the end, he cannot of course know all the intentions of those around him nor can he escape his own fate.

An Unforgettable story that made an impression on me in school and still holds a certain fascination for me. Did Hamlet ever really love Ophelia? That is the question.

Some reviews I have read were judging the movie by the play but seeing that I've seen the movie first our opinions differ.  I've noticed that some had complaints about the acting while others liked the acting.  I for one have to say that the acting is quite good.  In fact, I've seen ""The Lord of the Rings""(GREAT MOVIE-read the books to find out what happens in the second and third movie)and just now discovered that Ian Holm who acts as Bilbo in ""The Lord of the Rings"" is Polonius in ""Hamlet"".

Anyways to get back on the subject,both my sister and brother (he has read the play before seeing the movie I believe) have seen and also enjoyed this movie.  Although like other reviewers have mentioned and were a bit disappointed they did leave a couple of parts out from the play.  For example they left out the conversation between the clowns concerning Ophelia's burial and the part where Laertes and Hamlet leaped into Ophelia's grave.  But I still hold onto my opinion and say that this movie is very entertaining.  My only complaint is that this is not out on DVD.",1012003200,4,1363,4.3438735177865615
422586,4,6302096243,"The movie Hamlet directed by Franco Zefferelli is a historical drama, based on the popular Shakespearean Tragedy. Zefferelli decided to retain the name Hamlet, which I think could be modified to be more effective. Theoretically, a title is a microcosm of the theme, which `Hamlet' doesn't really accomplish; a title that can foreshadow the theme of the play will be more formidable. Perhaps the director could have excerpted one of the dominant quotes out of the play, the most famous being ""To be or not to be"". This would have at least given a foreshadowing to the indecision seen by the tragic hero throughout the plot. Generally speaking, the movie was well done and I comment the director for his concise but accurate representation of Shakespeare's `Hamlet'.
 On the whole the actors depicted the roles of their characters quite well. Hamlet played by the Australian, Mel Gibson took command of his part, and captivated the viewers with his emotional conversations, as well as addition of humor and a masculine vigor to Hamlet. He portrayed his part with a great deal enthusiasm, bringing the play to life. The royal couple played by Alan Bates and Glenn Close, as king Claudius and queen Gertrude respectfully, were able to capture the conduct of a monarchial leadership, of the middle ages with little difficulty. Claudius displayed an exceptional representation of a lusty, murderous king. The minor characters such as Ian Holm as Polonius, Nathaniel Parker as Laertes, and Helena Bonham Carter as Ophelia gave considerable support to the leading characters, as they were subtly but effectively able to dictate the plot.
 Hamlet is noted as one of Franco Zeffirelli's best productions as he recreated yet another Shakespeare masterpiece. He took a conventional approach to this production of Hamlet as he kept with the mindset most people would have to character and setting, in other words he tried not to give any surprises. Zeffirelli's main goal was to create a lighthearted enjoyable movie that would appeal to the general public who don't have the time and stamina for Branagh's four-hour version. In keeping with typical Shakespearean movies the director chose a soundtrack consisting of classical pieces, which is suitable for what he was trying to achieve. Little special effects were used, which may be a major flaw when trying to grasp the attention of modern day viewers, perhaps he could have included some more dynamic effects, especially with the ghost who appeared almost as though he was a living character.
 This movie is a concise version of the original text and has left out and/or shortened many scenes keeping only the ones necessary to tell the story. I really liked the way he incorporated old Hamlet's funeral in the beginning and the voyage to England. However, there were a few scenes like the fight between Laertes and Hamlet in the graveyard, which could have been further accented. The major flaw I observed in the movie when compared to the book was the exclusion of the sub-plot with Fortinbras and the Norwegian influence. This led to the ambiguity the viewers were left in once the movie ended, as there was no hint to the outcome of Denmark.",1007164800,3,3186,4.996233521657251
422587,4,6302096243,"If Olivier's version is too stodgy and stagy for you, and Kenneth Branagh's version either too ""Hollywood"" or just too blamed long, then you may want to try Franco Zeffirelli's version, which is a pleasant surprise in just about every way.
Zeffirelli has a history with Shakespeare, having directed gems like Romeo and Juliet, and a somewhat overheated (but very funny) version of The Taming of the Shrew -- in which we are treated to a pickled Richard Burton trading barbs with an overripe Liz Taylor. Zeffirelli and Shakespeare go hand-in-hand with one another; the director seems to know just how to adapt the Bard's plays for film. So when I heard he was filming Hamlet, I was overjoyed -- until I found out who was being cast in the lead:
""Mel GIBSON?! Is he NUTS!?!""
I figured it was a vanity thing for Gibson, one of those ""PLEASE take me seriously!"" ventures that would fall flat, and that Zeffirelli was sullying his own reputation by involving himself with it. I'm pleased to say I was wrong. This verson, while not the best I've seen, acquits itself honorably -- and Gibson is equal to the task of this very challenging role.
It helps that he's surrounded with a stellar supporting cast, such as Paul Scofield, Ian Holm, and Glenn Close (more on whom in a minute), but even on his own, Gibson makes for an impressive Prince. He's done his homework, and makes some intelligent decisions. Hamlet in this film is not brooding/depressed so much as he is ticked off, a cauldron of boiling rage (as in the moment when Gibson attacks Elsinore itself with his sword); physical actor that he is, Gibson wouldn't have played it any other way, and so doing brought a human element to the role absent in other interpretations, including, sorry to say, Olivier's -- who looks, for all his  ability, like an actor playing a role. Not so Gibson; his Hamlet is torn between royal obligations and those to his father, and  looks as if he's been driven more than a little mad in his attempt to reconcile them. One feels that his antic dispotition  is something far more than put-on -- Gibson looks quite literally like he's about to go nuts, especially during his cathartic scene with Gertrude -- and as long as I'm on that subject ...
There are several ways to approach the role of Gerturde: unknowing dupe, dotty but loving mother, and willing conspirator are just a few. Not many actresses would choose Close's daring, electrifyingly Oedipal/Freudian route, if only because it's A)the hardest to play accurately, and B)probably closest to the psychological truth, and the one actresses with less chutzpah than Close would shy away from. Close said she saw Gertrude as a ""trophy wife,"" who married Hamlet Sr. and bore his son when she was little more than a teenager. This accounts for her, ah, physical affection towards her son (I'm being euphemistic here), and is a big reason Hamlet's so messed up  to begin with. In this context Denmark's royals can be seen as just another dysfunctional family; small wonder things turn out as they do. Shakespeare knew the human condition intimately; this becomes more obvious as centuries pass, and he remains as relevant today as he was in his own time, if not moreso.
Zeffirelli's direction is as impressive as the acting (Ian Holm as Polonius is another delight!); he imbues the setting with the brooding qualities Gibson chooses to leave out of his acting. (Several different castles were used in bringing Elsinore to life; it's a testament to Zeffirelli that he's able to make a seamless whole of them.) Elsinore here becomes a grim, oppressive place; it's no wonder the people there are going mad or power-mad. Zeffirelli uses few tricks to tell his story -- a few crossfades here and there, and a Scorceseish tracking shot during Hamlet's confrontation with Ophelia, are it. This speaks of a director confident in his abilities to tell a story without having to dazzle the viewer.
And speaking of Ophelia, I think this would be an opportune moment to address the issue of ""cuts"" -- the process of making a four-hour play into something platable to filmgoers. Many have tried to cut Hamlet and made a conditional success of it, or botched the process entirely. For a primer, I refer you to the film adaptation of Tom Stoppard's brilliant The Fifteen-Minute Hamlet, which'll tell you everything you want to know. Cutting Hamlet can leave actors with little to say or do and unfortunately, this is what has been done to poor Ophelia. While some of her scenes remain (such as the abovementioned confrontation), others are lost to the fabled red pen, and Carter is reduced to making her role (perhaps the most tragic in the play, as she's the only real victim) into a series of mannerisms. She does well by what's left of the part -- but she doesn't have much to work with.
Still, that's my only complaint about this lovely abridgement.  I think it's a great movie, better than it had any right to be -- and for that I'm glad.",1006128000,2,4964,4.727482678983834

In an excellent scene where Hamlet is saying, ""You would not play apon this pipe (or flute), but you would play me ..."" Mel Gibson pins the man to whom he is speaking against a nearby brick wall with the musical instrument. Mel adds fire and sincerity to the struggles Hamlet is facing in trying to determine the morally correct path in which to respond to his father's untimely death.
Mel Gibson, during an televised interview before the movie was released, even voiced his own concerns about being able to follow in the footsteps of the world's greatest actors who have previously played Hamlet either on stage or on film.

All doubts of Mel Gibson's ability to do classical work was immediately erased in my mind.  Where most actors struggle to find any humor in Hamlet (including, sadly, Olivier), Gibson uses humor magnificently to balance Hamlet's equally spontaneous wildness.  And he can make the switch on a dime.

422602,5,6302096243,"I was deeply offended by Gibson's ""Braveheart."" For a while I refused to watch his movies, but with this movie, I somewhat forgave him. The images are done with rare delicacy and beauty. The symphony music flatters the images. Gibson is phenomenal as Hamlet. He portrays the many dimensions of Hamlet (his sorrow, his fury, his feigned madness, and his sharpness) quite well. Alan Bates is by far the best Claudius I have ever seen. Claudius is a difficult character to perform because of his many dimensions. He killed his brother, and stole his wife and crown. Yet, he is a reasonable monarch. He is VERY likable when he quells Laertes' raid with pure courage and intelligence. Also, he clearly regrets his murder and suffers for it. I tip my hat to Alan Bates. Scofield is superb as Hamlet's father. He displays pure human sorrow. Laertes is outstanding in his display of his character's multiple dimensions. (A loving son and brother, a revenge driven monster, and a penitent victim.) Ophelia is fine as the helpless pawn, and Gertrude and Polonius are fine as the characters who never see the plainest point. One thing the director avoids is the common mistake that Hamlet is simply stalking Claudius. It is clear in this movie that Hamlet and Claudius are stalking EACH OTHER. Also, this movie outdoes the book in that the filler is eliminated, and the scenes are juggled to make more sense. (Ex. Rather than seeing Hamlet's father's ghost first thing, we see the funeral of Hamlet's father. This makes it more frightening when Hamlet's friends tell him that they have seen his father.) My only complaint about this is that the director deletes lines that indicate Hamlet wants to be king.",974332800,2,1695,4.828178694158075

422604,5,6302096243,"After recently spending days viewing all currently available video Hamlets, I realize that this is definitely the best of the lot.  Branagh's version is certainly valuable for the full text and is beautifully filmed, but that is part of the problem.  The 19th century setting makes the instructions from Claudius to the King of England to kill Hamlet on his arrival ridiculous.  This is a much too civilized court for the rottenness in Denmark.  The Zeffirelli version sets Hamlet in a dark, primitive, medieval Denmark where all is possible. Branagh is a stage Hamlet, an actor playing a part, however well, while Gibson IS Hamlet for the two hour duration of the film.  The blonde wig Branagh wears is also rather off-putting, as though he were dressing up as Laurence Olivier in his version. I also find the cameo parts in the Branagh version rather self-indulgent, particularly that of Robin Williams and Charlton Heston, or simply incompetent (Jack Lemmon).  All the actors in Zeffirelli's version are living their roles, with their facial expressions changing moment to moment as the play unfolds. No ego trips here.",971481600,3,1122,5.037837837837838
422605,3,6302096243,"This is a pretty decent version of my favorite play Shakespeare ever did. Even though I say it is good, it is very soundly beaten by Branagh's version. Mel Gibson, although a great actor, could not pull it off as good as Kenneth Branagh. In this version, Gibson seemed to underact in scenes that I think should have deserved more drama into it (like the ""Too, too solid flesh,"" and the ""To be, or not to be"" speeches, and the scene in where Hamlet dies). He also overacted in scenes that shouldn't have been that dramatic (like in the scenes were he first talks to his Father/Uncle, and in his mother's closet). Branagh, on the other hand, pulled it off the way it was meant to be, as Gibson's way was not to be. Was it just me, or did it look like Hamlet was trying to make love to his mother (olayed somewhat well by Glenn Close) in the closet scene, after he had murdered Polonius? In my words, UUUUGGGHHH! The mood was dark, darker than Branagh's version. This version did have some good moments: The fight scene at the end, and Hamlet's confrontation with is father. If there was anything that even trys to make this film be as good or better than Branagh's version is the locations in where they filmed. The castle that they filmed this in was absolutely stunning, and some of the sets were neat looking. But they still couldn't rival the beautiful manor, or the dazzling rooms, in which Branagh's version was filmed. This version also had edited out some very important scenes, like the Norewegian army movements, the scene where the Norwegian prince and the British ambassador arrive, and, might I ad, that changing scenes around, and adding several unimportant scenes, was not great. Branagh's additions did not mess up the storyline. If you wish to see this version, do it only if you do not wish to sit through the four hours that Branagh's version uses to tell the story. I warn you though, this film is also slow. It is a good film, but take my advice, Gibson is better as an action star (even though FOREVER YOUNG was a good film, according to me). Branagh's version, although twice as long, moves along faster. Grade: B+",971395200,4,2135,4.533678756476684

But this modern version is excellent. Fine performances, great cinematography as is always the case under the direction of Franco Zefferelli. He had done of course the 1968 Romeo and Juliet and when his name along with Mel Gibson came out... it was sure to be a great film. And it is. There is not much emphasis on the ghost, nevertheless, only appearing once when he is originally supposed to come out twice, second time in the bedroom scene between Hamlet and his mother. That scene in particular is very distorted in this version. Mel Gibson and Glen Close actually have an incestuous intimate moment that any audience may find disturbing. The tragic endings are well performed. Helena Bohham Carter is a great Ophelia gone mad and Glen Close a pretentious, hypocritical queen. Mel Gibson.. for an actor who has done roles in the Lethal Weapon movies is quite good. Most of the Hamlets in the past, Olivier (though the best) and others are elderly and do not truly fit the original Hamlet the Bard envisioned- a young man out for revenge and that is what we see with Mel Gibson's performace.. a younger and more  vigorous character.. not the ""depressed, weak "" Hamlet many have recreated in Romanticism.

422643,2,6302096243,"Having had to compare the relative merits of Zeffirelli's and Branagh's Hamlets, I think that there are a few points which people tend to overlook. Branagh has been criticised for making his version 'too long'. Well, that's  only because he includes every line that Shakespeare wrote - it's along  play. So if Zeffirelli manages to tell the story in only an hour and a  half, what does he miss out, and are those omissions the right ones?  Yes, Gibson IS good as Hamlet. What I'm concerned about is a character who  constantly gets overlooked in both stage and film adaptation, namely  Ophelia. Where is she in Zeffirelli? He omits her only soliloquy, and  replaces her account of Hamlet coming to him 'with his doublet all  unbrac'd' (2.1.77-84) with a representation of that encounter which draws  our attention more to Hamlet's suffering than to hers. The fact that she  might have a mind of her own is glossed over repeatedly. For  instance...
1. She looks and acts like a girl (Kate Winslet's Ophelia is  most definitely a woman). The fact that all the men in her life mess with  her mind is detracted from because, as a child, we more or less expect her  to be told what to do.
2. Mel Gibson has been quoted as saying he was  shocked by the idea that Ophelia and Hamlet might have a sexual  relationship - in this film, she's supposed to be fourteen. What exactly is  a thirty year old man doing pursuing a girl less than half his age with  such passion? Zeffirelli removes the notion that Ophelia might be a sexual  person, and with it another element of her independence in a patriarchal  world.
The real killer is her appearance. Pale and flowing dress, long  romantic hair...do you have any idea how long Ophelia has been played in  this way? Over a hundred years, back to the dark times when all the critics  were men and thought that Ophelia was 'too exquisitely touching' to examine  in depth. So instead we have this romanticised doll, pretty to look at,  touching in her madness, but still a thing, not a person. Zeffirelli, like  so many before him, more or less uses Ophelia as a way to look at Hamlet,  and reduces her character to the bare minimum needed to convey the  slightest sense of her tragedy. Check out Branagh, it beats it by a long  way. Watch it in two chunks, if you must.",947376000,12,2304,4.524271844660194
422644,5,6302096243,"Hamlet: Tragedy Seen in terms of Christianity  Samuel T. Goldberg, M.D., psychoanalyst, Columbia, Maryland  Samtgoldberg@pol.net
  As illuminating as it may be, the  psychoanalytic is only one specific  perspective among many from  which one can examine Shakespeare's tragedy,  Hamlet, Prince of  Denmark . Equally important and valid would be to view  Hamlet's  entire struggle as between belief in spiritual life after death  vs. a materialistic scientific belief that the disintegration of the  body is the final end; or, as vacillation between the poles of  Christian  faith vs. skeptical doubt. One could interpret the  greed, ambitions,  fears, actions, and foibles of those  defending or seeking political  power as representing their  ongoing choice between the ""Kingdom on  Earth"" and the ""Kingdom  of Heaven""; clearly, this is how Claudius is  poised when he  attempts to pray. Yet again, one could explicate  Shakespeare's  commentary on how these choices affect not only the souls  and  lives of the individuals, but also the health or illness of the  state as a whole.
  Even before learning from his father's  ghost of Claudius's crimes,  Hamlet is undoubtedly depressed. By  his own descriptions, he wears  black, sighs, gives forth  ""fruitful river of the eye"", and is dejected  in mood and  behavior, showing ""all forms, moods, and shapes of  grief.""(1.2.77-82) All the uses of this world to him seem ""weary, stale,  flat, and unprofitable."" (1.2.133-134) He depicts himself as weak,  as  distant from Hercules as Claudius is from his father.  (1.2.152-153).  He's lost all his mirth, and given up his habits  of exercise.(2.2.297)  His heart breaks (1.2.159). He wishes for  suicide, if only God had not  forbidden it (1.2.132). He values  his life no more than he does a  pin(1.4.65) The encounter with  his father's spirit hardly lifts his own  spirits. Soon after,  he tells Polonius he will walk into his grave  (2.2.207), and  that Polonius can take his life, with which he would part  willingly . (2.2.217) He calls himself a rogue, a peasant slave, a  coward, an ass, and a whore. (2.2.549-585)
  What is the  cause of Hamlet's depression? Obviously, he has lost his  father. Hamlet has not completed mourning for his father; he has not let  father go. He repeatedly is confused about how long father has  actually  been dead, a duration he always underestimates.  Moreover, his mother's  behavior has disillusioned, tormented,  and infuriated him. Gertrude had  made great show of her love  for his father while he was alive, and of  her grief for his  death. Yet, her tears in truth were ""most unrighteous""  (1.2.154). She is like Niobe(149), whose behavior led to the death of  all her children; so also, Hamlet seems to predict, Gertrude's  behavior  will lead to his own death. She has permitted herself  with indecent  haste to be seduced by and to marry Claudius, her  brother in law,  incestuously. Hamlet at times seems even to  suspect her of complicity in  the murder(3.4.30).^ Flesh itself  is sullied, defiled and debased. All  frailty can be seen in  woman.
  ( It is at times ambiguous whether or not Gertrude may  have participated  in the plot to kill Hamlet's father. In the  Glenn Close film version, at  the senior Hamlet's coffin,  Gertrude and Claudius exchange a lengthy eye  contact full of  significance, noticed by Hamlet, though perhaps  indicating only  an attraction till then suppressed. The ghost not only  fails to  include Gertrude as a murderer, but orders Hamlet to contrive  no revenge against her. Hamlet, however, seems at first to hold her  equally as guilty of the murder. Though it's not clear that these were  among the lines inserted into the Marriage of Gonzago by Hamlet,  the  player Queen says, ""In second husband let me be accursed!  None wed the  second but who killed the first."" (3.2.177-178) In  his mother's bedroom,  Hamlet accuses her of killing a king, but  her response indicates  astonishment (3.4.30-31), and their  making peace by the end of the scene  again seems to dispel that  accusation against her.)
  This painful disorder and  disappointment in his family has caused Hamlet  to lose faith  more generally. Pulled into his disillusionment are not  only  the key people about him, but also the state of Denmark, majesty,  men generally, women, beauty, love, words, the value of action, his  self-worth, and the worth even of life itself. Despondent, betrayed,  and  aggrieved, Hamlet observes things rank and gross in nature  possessing  all the world. It is an unweeded garden grown to  seed (1.2.135-136), as  if he could now see what has become of  the Garden of Eden because of the  original sin, Adam's and  Eve's sensual transgression. Claudius is the  serpent who has  tempted ""Eve"" and stung Hamlet's father's life.  (1.5.40).  Moreover, with regard to the deaths of fathers, the new King  of  Denmark refers nonchalantly to the first murder, telling Hamlet that  ""from the first corpse (ie, Abel's) till he that died today, `this  must  be so.'"" (1.1.101-106) Claudius later refers to his crime  as having ""the  primal eldest curse upon't,"" ie, the curse of  Caine. (3.3.36-37;  cf. 5.1.77) His rank offense and its effects  rot in Denmark (1.4.90) and  ""smell to Heaven.""(3.3.36)
  Hamlet is appalled: everywhere he sees mere seeming. All appearance is  deceptive. Only one man in ten thousand is honest, (2.2.178)  and the  world will be honest only when doomsday is near  (2.2.237-238), ie,  never, or but very briefly. One may smile,  smile, and be a villain.  Consider how Claudius first appears,  addressing the full court. About  his grief and his marriage,  his public statement is crafted for public  purpose; he allows  no candor. (1.2.1-13) Though just having achieved a  new wife  and kingdom, he shows not full joy, but must pretend it is  ""defeated."" Discretion, he says, makes sorrow ""wise"", limiting grief and  advising also to remember oneself, but it also makes joy wise, ie,  curtailed so as not to offend. ""In equal scale weighing delight  and  dole,"" Claudius at nearly every moment can be seen to be  calculating,  measured, his self-interest never forgotten.
  Claudius advises Hamlet no longer to continue those ""mourning  duties"" to  his father(1.2.89), which he sees as issuing from  mere ""obligation""  (1.2.91). He does not permit himself to  recognize true or unadulterated  grief within himself, nor to  empathize with that suffered by Hamlet.  Though he has just  given the other youth, Laertes, leave to return to  Paris,  Claudius bids Hamlet to ""remain here in the cheer and comfort of  our eye,"" and opposes his returning to Wittenberg . (1.2.115-116)  Perhaps suspecting already that Hamlet could become a threat, Claudius  wants to keep an eye on him. In reality, Claudius subjects Hamlet  to  ""the oppressor's wrong... the insolence of office.""  (3.1.72-74) Though  he courts the prince with expressions of  fatherly love,^ Claudius is  manifestly the bad father, who  fears, suspects, needs to watch and to  control Hamlet, and who  is ready to turn against him murderously. Hamlet  suspects his  villainy even before meeting the ghost: (""O, my prophetic  soul!""1.5.42).
  Likewise, Polonius, the king's most trusted  adviser, also lives by  scheming. He dissembles constantly, and  even advises his son Laertes  against being direct, telling him  to keep his true self internally  hidden, in reserve: ""Give thy  thoughts no tongue.""(1.3.59). The outward  show is what is  important: ""The apparel oft proclaims the man."" (72). So  also  does he hide himself externally, in order to observe others in  secret. He is willing to contrive even to sully his own son's reputation  in order to spy on him. (2.1.22-63) In his loyal service to the  King, he  will^ sacrifice even his daughter, using her as bait.  He admits, ""With  devotion's visage and pious action we do sugar  o'er the devil himself.""  (3.1.47-49)
