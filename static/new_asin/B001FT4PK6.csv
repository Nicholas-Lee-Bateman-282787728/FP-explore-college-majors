3588812,5,B001FT4PK6,Brevity is the soul of wit - this film rocks! Buy it and let's hope Logo makes a sequel!,1233619200,,88,3.6842105263157894
3588813,5,B001FT4PK6,"This was a excellent movie.  It was so inspirational, touching, funny and very entertaining. I knew the movie would be good but it past my expectations. The movie was awesome!!",1233619200,2,176,4.866666666666666
3588814,5,B001FT4PK6,"This movie turned out to be even better than I expected. I saw it 3 times at the theatre,and I just ordered the DVD. Darryl Stephens and Jenson Atwood are so perfect together as Wade and Noah,that you almost long for them to be a ""real life"" couple. Rodney Chester (whom I met in NYC at GAY PRIDE)was hysterical as ever as 'Alex'.That ho Ricky was up to his old tricks,and hiding a secret that is sure to shock some,but it didn't surprise me at all. I was dissapointed the Alex's husband,the gorgeous hunk of beef,'Trey',is only in the movie via webcam images when he and Alex video call. The movie takes place in Martha's Vinyard at Wade's families' vacation home,and at time reminds me of the Mexico location scenes in 'Sex And The City'.(The Movie) I have to admit I wanted more nudity,but it was still a sexy flick to watch. The new chracter in the film is adorable and was featured as cute little 'Nelson' on the 'Cosby Show'.

This is what gay black friendships should be like,this is what they used to be like.",1233619200,4,1017,4.438502673796791
3588815,5,B001FT4PK6,"I'm co-signing with reviewer Tracey.  Heterosexual female totally in love with Noah's Arc. I have season's 1 & 2 and cannot wait for the movie to come out!  I wasn't able to view in theater's cuz it never came to my city. This show has something for everyone because their topics are so diverse and real, plus it deals with the day to day struggle of love like everybody else. I would also co-sign and say that my hubby is a homophobic but it's amazing that he always managed to come into the room while I was watching my discs and know every character and episode too, so I commend Mr. Polk's writing skills in opening minds to acceptance.",1233273600,5,640,4.369747899159663
3588816,5,B001FT4PK6,"OMG!! i looooove noah and the girls, they are my boy toys!! i became and instant fan from day one so of course i ran to see the movie the first day it came out. i cant wait to add this dvd to my collection. WHERE IS SEASON THREE OF NOAHS ARK??? please bring it back!!",1232755200,3,267,3.7857142857142856
3588817,5,B001FT4PK6,"As a completely heterosexual female, after viewing an episode of Noah's Arc on the LOGO channel, I was completely hooked.  I had to go to see the movie by myself, being as though my husband is homophobic.  I watch the reruns over and over again and have ordered the complete 1st and 2nd seasons on DVD through Amazon.com.  I can't wait to receive them.  I am also on the list to be notified when the movie, Jumping the broom, and the soundtrack  become available.",1228089600,5,463,4.464285714285714

3588819,5,B001FT4PK6,"I just finished watching the movie and it was FABULOUS.  I would recommend getting the video at soon as it releases.  I will be doing just that.  Jumping the Broom was a great love story.  It had all elements of a great movie. It was heart-warming, and funny, sad and a feel good movie.  I have but two negative comments, the first being it was way to short and I would have loved more.  Story lines could have developed into more but as it was it was GREAT. My next negative is where was WILSON CRUZ.  Not having this final and important member to the movie was extremely DISAPPOINTING and would not have destroyed the story line. I will purchase this movie and I am going again to see it.",1224979200,23,690,4.2615384615384615

3588857,5,B001FT4PK6,"This is the best gay drama movie I have seen in a long time. With same sex marriages becoming legal in several states, it proves that same sex couples just want to be treated equally and want the same as everyone else.",1405555200,,218,4.214285714285714

3588865,4,B001FT4PK6,"The first season really was the best. This was nice to see some closure to the story lines, and also to see the characters once again.

3588893,1,B001FT4PK6,This was a terrible movie with good actors. The concept was flawed in a forgettable movie. Too many players with too little influence on the plot line.,1386374400,,151,4.62962962962963

3588919,5,B001FT4PK6,"I have enjoyed and loved this series and this movie.  I hope that Jumping the Broom was not the end of Noah and his friends.  This series should have at least 5 more.  There are so many aspects to the gay life that it should not be hard to do several more series.  I know the cost is high but they will reap the rewards from doing some more series.  The characters are hot and the way it look at gay couples are true in most aspects.  Jumping the Broom was everything I thought it would be.  It gave an insight of how a person can love someone and that person be in love with someone else and will try to get with that person not out of spite or being mean but wondering what do they have that I don't have.  Been there. Noah the series and this one was excellent.  I hope that we don't have to wait too long before another Noah comes out.  We do not want to forget about the characters especially ""Baby Gap""??  Any who! For the curious straights, these are the movies to get to get a good and easy insight into the gay life without being disgusted or afraid that someone is going to jump your bones. Not too over the top for the straight of straight men and women.  Great location---Martha Vineyards.",1376352000,,1201,4.151515151515151
3588920,5,B001FT4PK6,it was everything that I expected it to be. and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good down to earth movie about really what's going on in the gay and lesbian community.,1375488000,,179,4.142857142857143
3588921,5,B001FT4PK6,"Watched the series and absolutely loved it.  This is a great follow-up movie to the series that has all the elements that the series embodied; funny, heartfelt, touching, and emotional one word ""REAL"".  The love story is one that many can identify with.  The movie had me laughing and crying.  I love the character that each actor portrays Noah and Wade the perfect ideal couple and Mama Alex a hoot.  Curtis aka ""Baby Gat"" great job. This is a must watch.",1373328000,,456,4.580246913580247

3588923,1,B001FT4PK6,"This movie starts off poorly and gets worse from there.  The characters are flat and lifeless and have zero likability.  Stay away from this stinker, unless you have a penchant for watching garbage.",1371081600,,198,4.96969696969697
3588924,5,B001FT4PK6,"I highly recommend this movie, because it is the conclusion to Noah's Arc the second season.  This is a full length movie not a series. Amazingly the creator of all of the Noah's Arc, Patrik Ian Polk continued where season two left off, but in a grand way. This movie is refreshing and you will be very surprised. But if you didn't see Noah's Arc season two, don't worry you definitely will not be confused my just watching the movie. I'm telling you Patrik Ian Polk is a genius!  Peace!",1369785600,,487,4.4
3588925,5,B001FT4PK6,"I came across the TV series, Noahs Arc. Became fascinated and ended up watching all of seasons 1 and 2. Thought it was going to be predictable but not much was really. There were lots of creative twists, deep insights, humor and suspense woven into a show really about relationships, human strengths and human frailties. I think I learned some things about myself watching this through the experiences of the characters. Being that they are gay and Black only made it even more poignant. I truly enjoyed dropping into the culture of my brothers as it was so Black and so gay and so fun... AND gorgeous, sensual, romantic and sexy! God, did we need something like this! Thank you for creating it and for introducing us to some wonderful actors and creative talent.

The character development was great. After becoming a fan of the TV series. I got to see more sides of the characters as a bonus in this film, Jumping the Broom. In dealing with their challenges; the tension, embarrassment and insecurities gave way to something more precious within them as the friends each made decisions for what a better life would be. It was fun watching each of them travel on their journey of ""growing up"" all while holding the sacredness of their circle of friendship.

We need films like this and stories like this, stories that affirm that we are all ""alright"" but just travel on different paths as special and individual people. When we meet in the circle, it brings the magic.",1360108800,,1469,4.689922480620155

3588927,5,B001FT4PK6,"Having lived in Los Angeles during two separate stints, I can honestly say that I have never seen such camaraderie by gay men of color, in WeHo, no less. WeHo, the tainted fairyland complete with successful men of color bonding, is just not my experience of the WeHo fantasy world where blonde and blue eyed rule the roost. Anyone not meeting those standards are ostracized.",1354579200,,374,4.769230769230769

3588939,1,B001FT4PK6,"Not as funny, interesting or well made as the TV show it's based on!  Which is weird, considering you'd think it would have a nicer budget.  I did enjoy the TV show, the camp and bad acting were a hoot- shame it had to end with a whimper.",1353628800,,238,3.9375
3588940,5,B001FT4PK6,I love the show & I always wanted the dvds. I saw the movie & had to get it on dvd. So I came on amazon to see if they had it & they did at such a great price! :) I read the reviews about the person & saw the great reviews. The package was sealed (brand new) from the factory of where it came from & the package came very very fast. I will definitely be ordering from them again!,1342483200,,379,3.6341463414634148
3588941,5,B001FT4PK6,"I stumbled on this series by chance. This is not the genre that I usually watch, but was captivated by it. I would say that the acting is well done, the series seems to deal with real issues that affect gay men. Again, I don't usually watch this genre of movie, but found this to be an enlightening one.",1339718400,,303,4.1525423728813555
3588942,5,B001FT4PK6,"It was moving, and awfully funny. It was odd in that it wasn't a typical gay movie, where being gay is at the heart of everything. You almost completely forget their orientation, and you just sit back and watch a movie about relationships and love. I highly recommend this movie!",1337558400,3,279,4.6
3588943,5,B001FT4PK6,"i pray that this will not be the last of Noah's arc because this movie opened eyes to great things...

3588944,5,B001FT4PK6,I'm in love with the seriies along with the movie. As a straight women it showed the ups and downs of relationships the bond between friends and how love is just that love. A WHOLE LOT OF FINE MEN.The only time I wish I were a guy LOL.,1335312000,,235,3.9166666666666665
3588945,5,B001FT4PK6,"You could watch this movie all on its on or even better you might be jonesing for a little closure after that grand finale of season two. I will definitely watch it several more times. The acting is sound, Im so glad Baby Gat was in this one! I would love another movie. I adore the lessons Polk wolves into his work. Teach us more. There is so much to play off of. Nothing seemed signed and sealed. MORE MORE MORE!!! haha Oh and yes Polk also has something new called The Skinny. Havent seen it (its still in the theater and Im not so lucky to have it playing in my city). I'm confident it will be sensational. I wish I had the time to fly into Cali and see it.",1333929600,3,662,4.0227272727272725

3588949,5,B001FT4PK6,I purchased this gift as a Birthday gift for my friend.  I was never a Noah's Arc fan but I must say that this movie was enjoyable and had both of us in stitches.  I would recommend this purchase for anyone who just want to seat back and enjoy a good laugh.,1326240000,,257,3.923076923076923
3588950,5,B001FT4PK6,"Well my friend recomended that I check out/buy this movie since I did not see the TV series. My response was""Just another B gay movie. NOT...

I would say 2 thumbs up with a twist.",1326240000,,307,4.049180327868853
3588951,5,B001FT4PK6,"I watched the series and was very excited about the movie. The characters stayed true to their roles from the series. The story had a proper balance of drama, laughter, and tears.

3588959,5,B001FT4PK6,"I really liked the series and was disappointed when it was cancelled after only two seasons (shame on you, Logo network!). It deftly alternated riotous humor with deeply moving moments, all revolving around the sweet entity that is Noah and his ""universe"" of friends: Flamboyant Alex, scholarly Chance & promiscuous Ricky. It was such a pleasant surprise to see a film that not only tied the knot between Noah & his hunky beau Wade, but tied up loose ends left from the series. Off to a gorgeous home at Martha's Vineyard, Noah & Wade are already suffering from pre-wedding jitters when high drama is dropped off at their doorstep: A pill-popping Alex obsesses over wedding details, Chance & his husband Eddie come precariously close to divorce, and Ricky--with cute nineteen year-old Brandon in tow--drops what is undoubtedly the biggest bombshell of all (sorry, no spoiler alert!). Add to this the unexpected arrival of Noah's sassy boss & closeted, troublemaking rapper Baby Gat to the mix, and it all makes for a recipe for disaster! I was happy that the film stayed consistent with the series as far as quality: It's well-written, with hilarious, sexy moments & scenes of profound soul searching, and the cast slips easily back into their roles as if they've never left!
Like many fans, I'd be interested in seeing another film which brings the characters up to date. Then again, this film isn't a bad one to exit on.

Some of the writing was VERY bad...the scene where Alex rings the bell to discuss the wedding plans was really bad to the point the actors actually looked awkward and embarrassed by the dialogue. Watch it and you'll see it. It's so awkward because the writing is so bad.

The movie really cheapened the characters. The TV show was cut VERY prematurely...all the characters had so much development and growth ahead of them and thus, made this move VERY premature...I would say Noah's Arc had at least 5-6 more quality seasons ahead of it before the movie should have been done.

Everything was sex, sex, sex, everybody seemed to want sex with everybody. Ricky's character was an afterthought; this movie provided actually nothing for his character whatsoever. I also would've liked Noah's character to have a bit more development to it. Alex's character nearly dominated the entire film.

The ending almost makes up for it and it was a bit of a tear-jerker, but it did not excuse the rest of the film. I'd like to see a return of the TV show where this movie can be forgotten as if it never took place.

P.S. - ""Baby Gat's"" character was beyond annoying...just...really stomach churning. What was the point of him being there?",1291852800,,1409,4.7860082304526745

Almost the entire cast is back - this time at Wade's guesthouse for the upcoming marriage of Wade and Noah.

3588968,5,B001FT4PK6,"I'll keep it short and sweet. The movie was adorable. Of course the returning cast completely set the mark of the movie. So much of each character has come into their own. I'll agree that Wade is more comfortable in his own skin as an ""out"" gay man and Noah has completely grown into a very inspirational/encourging young man as well, seeing as though throughout seasons 1 and 2 he was seeking the advice of his friends, now his calming advice seems to help reconcile the others ""troubled"" relationships (both)as previously mentioned in the JTB photo shoot interview) I believe Noah and Wade (maybe unintentionally) switched roles in this movie. I can't really explain my reasonings for this but Noah has seemingly become the ""steady ground"" in Wade's life, of course Wade still continues to ""carry Noah""... but then again that'd only seem right... seeing as though Noah's quest to ""win Wade back"" in Season 2 appeared impossible considering Wade's (somewhat) loyalty to Dre' minus the two times they cheated w/ each other, but in their defense, both times (after Noah bailed Wade out of jail and the beach) with such passion between two ppl, it'd sure to lead to sex. In JTB, Noah and Wade's relationship has definitely evolved from both seasons and their chemistry stronger.

**SPOLIER ALERT** Noah brought out alittle of ""Alex"" in himself in the movie, which was cute, especially in the hot tub when assumingly they were all playing drunk drinking ""blue gatarade"" I mean, Hypnotic...lol... One (I have many) of my favorite scene is in the house during Noah's accidental phone call to Wade's mother, and the ARC, all drunk, sat there laughing at Noah's drunken attempt to get her to the wedding, Ricky especially. I admit I was laughting too when Wade's mother asks ""Wade's getting Married?"" ""And who are you the pastor?"" LMBO. And toward the end during the conversation with Noah and his mom. Mother: ""Your father really wanted to be here but he had to go stay with his mother"" Noah: ""Grandma, she ok?"" Mom: ""Yeah, she fell"". ""Bruised her hip"" ""Drunk ole battle axe"" Noah: ""Mom"" Mom: ""Oh, she's fine""...lol. (sounds like my mom in refernce to my dad's mom)

Ok, back to the movie... I wish Trey would've appeared in the movie. His and Alex relationship has grown on me, after watching both seasons. However with watching the movie twice, I still can't really place where Brandy and Baby Gat fits into the movie... **SPOILER ALERT** Although Baby Gat falling into the water and then stripping bare naked and running to the hot tub was hilarious and Brandy's kitchen conversation w/ Alex was cute- her and Beyonce' twins...lol... their characters seem unrealistic... BUT on another note since they did return to the movie, I'm glad the orginal actors were not replaced. The only part I'm in the dark about is the webcam conversation between Alex and Trey (toward the beginning of the movie) and whateva it was Trey asked if Alex would tell Noah... that was never clarified, unless I missed something or he was talking about their martial problems (which I doubt) Anyway, I said I would keep it short, so all in all, I enjoyed the movie and has watched it repeatedly. I became a fan alittle late in the game, but hey I'm here now... Well... enough for now... (in the voice of Brandy) *Toodles*",1271635200,2,3293,4.775438596491228

3588972,4,B001FT4PK6,"I watched this movie on DVD last weekend with my 2 best friends (gay men who have been fans of the TV series for a long time).  While I am not a regular viewer of the TV show, I've seen enough episodes at their house to be familiar with the core characters and a little of their history together.

While Jumping the Broom would never be called great cinema, it was an immensely enjoyable experience for my friends and I.  We laughed our butts off at Alex's wired exploits in the kitchen, enjoyed the gorgeous eye candy of Noah, Ricky and Wade, and tsk-tsked at Ricky's even-tackier-than-usual behavior (leaving the date he brought to the wedding to have sex with strangers).  While we got some laughs out of Brandy's 'morning after' look and behavior, I felt that the whole Baby Gat & Brandy storyline was unnecessary and did not add much to the movie.

The constant bickering and multiple ""marriage trouble"" storylines got to be a bit much, not because each wasn't believeable or engaging, but because--for me at least--it was overkill.  Do we have to see EVERYONE having relationship problems at the same time?  It was a downer, though the Chance/Eddie/Brandon situation was both touching and hilarious.

The movie descends into cheesiness at times, but we all came out of it smiling, having had a fun movie-watching experience together...and that's what it's all about, right?!",1255392000,,1380,4.817796610169491

3588977,5,B001FT4PK6,"As a fan of the late, lamented Logo series, Noah's Arc, I approached this film with a little trepidation. The Logo series was wonderful, but the second season and the quickened plots indicated that Noah's Arc might not be long for this world. It wasn't. Of course, everybody I know watched it and loved it. We asked ourselves: why cancel a smart, sexy, worldly, funny and pertinent show about the ups and downs of a close-knit group of friends that we incorrectly assumed was a hit? Well, the gods of television are ruthless and unkind.

Then, they made a film. Would the charm of the series be able to translate onto the big screen? I can assuredly say ""YES!"" and then some!

The film picks up where the series left off, ties up a few loose ends and then goes on its merry way as Noah, Alex, Chance, and Ricky travel to Martha's Vineyard, MA, for Noah's wedding to Wade. Chance comes with Eddy. Ricky brings along a young student of Chance's named Brandon. Trey is back in CA taking care his and Alex's newly adopted HIV+ baby, OJ, but Trey shows up via webcam with OJ on Alex's laptop.

Thus the stage is set for what the gang hopes will be a celebratory weekend of love and friendship. Of course, everything that could go wrong does, in sometimes the most hilarious ways.

Baby Gat shows up unannounced and uninvited along with Brandy, Noah's boss, to throw a wrench in the works. Alex is determined to have the ""perfect"" gay wedding for Noah, popping OTC stimulants to keep the energy going; he then becomes even more rev'd up and imperious than he usually is as he merrily rolls on in his controlling, diva ways. Ricky quickly dumps his young companion, Brandon, and goes on the prowl locally for some anonymous sex, with unexpected results. Chance's and Eddie's relationship starts to show a few cracks and they realize that they may have to come to terms with some unpleasant truths. And Noah and Wade go through the pre-wedding jitters, with enough ups and downs and all-arounds to make a prospective groom's head spin. Toss in a couple of ""coming out to the family"" moments (one unplanned) and the stage is set for a difficult but ultimately revealing weekend for everyone.

All the actors shine as brightly, if not more so, than they did in the TV series. The acting is solid and one marvels at this ensemble cast that makes one believe that they really have been friends forever. There are subtle ""teaching moments"" here and there that are not preachy and mix right into the dialogue and action.

There are so many comic moments and there are many poignant insights into the complexities of love, friendship, the true meaning of family, self-realization, self-acceptance and long-term commitment.

Will Noah and Wade finally Wed? Will Chance and Eddie get back on track? Will Ricky come to terms with his promiscuity? Will Alex be able to give the perfect wedding? Will Baby Gat create his usual chaos and pandemonium?

No spoilers here. Just a recommendation that this film will not disappoint and, in fact, will entertain over and over again.

I really liked Noah's Arc on Logo.  Funnier than Showtime's Queer As Folk and every bit as sexy, it was a delight to watch.  I thought that the film fell short of the TV series, though.  Not that I could write and direct a feature film, but I think that writing and directing half-hour or hour length shows for TV is quite different than writing and directing a feature film.  One cannot just use the same formula and double the length.  Unfortunately that's what Noah's Arc: Jumping The Broom is -- an overly long TV episode.

Well, I can confidently say that this movie is the equivalent of having 5 more episodes of Noah's Arc, back-to-back. The 90 minute movie format gives ""Noah's Arc"" the time to explore an issue without having a 20 minute time limit in which to resolve it. My point is that practically nothing was lost in the transition from small screen to big screen. Very few tv shows can successfully make that jump.

But I did NOT like all of the bedroom shenanigans. Too slutty.

Other than that, it is a movie that will make you YELL out loud with laughter!  :)  Everybody overacts or underacts and the one-liners just keep coming. It is like watching the best 5 minutes of your favorite ""The Simpsons"" episode but there is enough funny material to last 90 minutes.

3589008,5,B001FT4PK6,"Earlier this year, a big screen adaptation of Sex & The City was released. Actually, that's not true, a ninety minute advert for Products was released, with the characters from Sex & The City grafted on to make people watch.

Noah's Arc is often referred to - for better or worse - as a black, gay SATC. So, when I heard the news that the prematurely cancelled series would also be bursting onto cinema screens, I had my doubts. Television and film are very different beasts, and one doesn't necessarily translate into another. Just look at SATC - a depressing, cynical exercise in vulgar consumerism.

When Noah's Arc first appeared on our screens, it was unique: a show that wasn't about white gay men. It was Queer As Folk in colour, and funnier. The series suffered under the tyranny of network television censorship (that NA was as hot as it was is a miracle) and a miniscule running time. But it was bursting with heart and soul, and audiences fell in love with Noah, Ricky, Alex and Chance - not to mention their numerous sexy suitors.

Season two ended on a cliff-hanger, but with criminal disregard for the loyalty of the viewing audience, Logo cancelled the series, just when it was finding its feet.

Let's not be bitter, because we have something to celebrate. Noah and Wade are getting married! We might not have a Season 3 (yet), but we've got Jumping The Broom. So what happened after the car crash? Did Noah wake up and find Wade in the shower? Did the whole of season two not happen? Was it all a dream?

Don't be silly, kids. The movie is set at some point after the crash, which Wade survived. That's not a spoiler - he's all over the publicity photos, and Noah's Arc without Wade would be like SATC without Big. But what of Dre, I hear you cry! Well now, you'll just have to watch and see.

And what of Jumping The Broom?

It's a joy. A big, sexy, laugh out loud joy. There's smiles and frowns, and tears, and... er, Baby Gat (Jason Steed). Oh, Baby Gat. He's back, innit, full of bruvs and bluds, u get me. This one needs his own series. He lights up the screen and steals the show. I beg u, giv the boi his own show, innit. Brandy's (Jennia Fredrique) back too, bringing a lil fem to the table. Gary LeRoi Gray's Brandon is a refreshing addition to the clique. They're all welcome guests.

Only Gregory Kieth's Trey is missing in action, which is a real shame. His long-suffering relationship with Alex was always a pleasure to view. Don't worry, all is not lost - he puts in a welcome cameo via webcam, in a pleasing throwback to Season one. It's a shame we couldn't exchange Trey for Jonathan Julian's depressing Eddie. I'm not quite sure if it's the character, or if the actor isn't quite at home here, but Eddie just gets me down. At least in the series his appearances were kept to a minimum - but we're forced into close quarters with him here. But that's a small quibble. The truth of the matter is this movie is packed with so many ""OMG - I can't believe he/they just did that!"" moments that such minor shortcomings can be overlooked.

Noah's Arc: Jumping The Broom is heartfelt, hilarious and packed with eye candy. This wedding cake has all the right ingredients.

3589012,5,B001FT4PK6,"After the abrupt ending of a Groundbreaking series 2 year run on Logo channel, viewers including myself yearned for more. Anything, we wanted to continue Noah's ARC, a dynamic series.

Sometimes comical, sometimes serious, ridiculous, outrageous, steamy, scandalous. Noah's ARC was always fun. In an interview with Doug Spearman (Chance) he said to the effect - 'I could imagine how a series like this could have helped me when i was 16 years old.'  I agree, i remember being a black gay male at 16, luckily living near New York and a progressive College town i had a pathway to my identity. The series fulfilled my pathway, while laying a pathway for many young gay people of all groups.

With its untimely end after 2 seasons many viewers felt as though a lifeline was ripped away from them. At the news of a follow up movie, we were elated to at least see closure to such a warm series. ""Jumping the Broom"" throws you into the Wedding weekend, learning that Noah and Wade are a couple ready to marry. While the regular series takes a whole season to run through a gamut of situations and  emotions, this movie threw all of that into about 100 minutes. When you think of it, that's one heck of a roller coaster ride, and it is. My personal loyalty to the show and cast gives the movie bias. Seriously, the stormy emotional environment dares to spin the story out of control, nearly losing the movie. You would wonder could the story be saved without being too pretentious. It was miraculously saved in the final reel, making the movie a bit unbalanced, Melodramatically laden through three quarters of the film. If i were a drinking man, the depression would have had me hopelessly drunk before the end. The salvation in the last quarter of the film appears to patch the tension and give you a happy ending as more of a duty than a natural progression.

Thanks to the vision and work of Patrik Ian Polk, ""Jumping the Broom"" contains strong symbolism such as relating the phrase 'Jumping the Broom' also creating a humble yet believable wedding ceremony. If you look closely (and diligently) Polk showcases the possible caveats, many 'what ifs' in the lives of Gay relationships.

Overall i suggest, ""Jumping the Broom"" is the third and final season of ""Noah's ARC"" concentrated into 100 minutes. As a loyal fan of the series,
the movie presents closure to an abrupt series cancellation, for that i am happy to add ""Jumping the Broom"" to my seasons 1 and 2 DVDs. If you've never seen the entire series the movie might seem ridiculous, maybe even trivial.

3589018,2,B001FT4PK6,"As a huge fan of the original television series, I was taken aback by this melodramatic and stereotypical film adaptation. It's not to say that 'Jumping the Broom' completely loses the general appeal of the television show, but character continuation, nuance, and a solid plot is sacrificed for overblown plot devices, bad dialogue, and unbelievable scenarios.

Darryl Stephens (while I love him) seems to have been sleep-walking as 'Noah' in the film. Originally, 'Noah' was to 'Arc' as 'Carrie' was to 'Sex in the City', but in the film he's more like second-billing than the flagship. Stephens gives his character no presence, which wasn't the case during the television show.

The character of 'Wade' played by Jensen Atwood does a complete 180 in the film. During the T.V. series, 'Wade' was the hyper-masculine, bi-sexual type...in the film, certain apparel and actions the character wears are wholly different, and unexplained.
Rodney Chester as 'Alex' seems more the flagship of the group in the film, and Chester vividly brings his character to life (as always). But creator Patrik-Ian Polk didn't really give 'Alex' a lot of important things to do in the film. That coupled with the overblown, over-the-top (more so than even in the T.V. series) persona of 'Alex' in the film, is truly puzzling.

Lastly, Douglas Spearman as 'Chance' is what his character has always been, 'blah'. His subplot with ""husband"" 'Eddie' and pupil 'Brandon' is truly a waste of screen time. It's nonsensical, lame, anti-climatic, and unbelievable (when/if you see the film, the resolution between these characters is ridiculous). The actor who played 'Brandon' definitely needs work on his dramatic delivery. I know 'Jumping the Broom' wasn't aiming for any Oscar nominations, but I shouldn't be rolling my eyes during its most ""dramatic"" scenes either.

Beyond the characters I think 'Jumping the Broom' did a piss poor job of representing black, gay men in general. These characters are careless, promiscuous, they betray their friends in the worst possible ways (all resolved by the end of the film of course), and live life as if they were children. I won't divulge any further, because it would give the film away if I did.

Ian-Polk constructs the film like he would've the television show, one pratfall after another. One scene of melodrama, followed-by comic relief, followed-by more melodrama. That is the structure of the film for 1 1/2 hours, which can be frustrating for a viewer. It got to the point where I just began rolling my eyes when some major event occurred, because it was so unbelievable.

In closing, this film very much felt like a continuation of the SECOND season of 'Noah's Arc'...fans of the show will be aware that there is a distinct difference in quality between the first and second seasons of the show. The second season was full of recklessness, cheesy dialogue, poor plot, zero character development (I mean really, did 'Noah' grow-up at all during the second season?); these are all traits of the film.

Ian-Polk should have took a little more time...thought about plot, dialogue, and scenarios, because this was borderline embarrassing.",1234656000,11,3162,5.0926640926640925

Noah and Wade have evidently reconciled (since the series abruptly ended) and they and the boys have assembled (minus a couple characters) on Martha's Vineyard at Wade's family vacation home (an ocean-side mansion, of course) to celebrate their wedding.  Whether they will actually tie the knot (or jump the broom) is anybody's guess, and they don't actually seem too sure about it either.  Noah's friends don't help as they add their own flavors of sexual tension, jealousy, their own couples' problems, and a lot of snide comments.  Add to that a new young guy just coming to grips with what being gay is all about and he acts as a catalyst for a lot of self-disclosure and good discussion amongst the characters.

My favorite scene-stealer is Noah's boss, the name-dropping diva who gets all the good lines along with ""Curtis,"" aka ""Baby Gap"" who shows up in hopes of sweeping Noah off his feet.

The editing of this movie is tight and spot-on and there is hardly a moment that isn't packed with all the stuff you loved about the series.  The characters have all aged well (i.e. they are smokin' hot) and seem to have had no trouble going back into their ""Noah"" characters.

It's funny, it's moving, and it feels real; it's a study in relationships and friendship, courtship and love.  After seeing the movie, I have ordered the soundtrack.

Let's break this down.

ACTING

Honestly, I have never thought the acting in NOAH'S ARC was anything to write home about.  The fellow who plays Chance has potential to be the best, but his haughty nature, which, from seeing him in interviews, seems to really be his, ruins it to hell.

What made this movie worth watching until the end was Alex's turnout (or was it turn-up?).  Alex has always had the best zingers and vernacular in the series.  He continued that by 20-fold here.  (My favorite line was when he was fighting with Noah's boss:  ""Baby, we can clear this table right here!""  Love it!)

I do feel compelled to call out Jensen Atwood.  That man simply cannot act to save his life.  I get that he's got to play the role of a straight-acting, slightly thuggish fianc/boyfriend.  He captures the thug part perfectly, but that's because it seems to be his nature.  (He was raised in South Central, I believe.)  But the moment he tries any sort of intimacy, he falls flat -- and I mean hard.  Or the moment there is conflict, it's like watching a piece wood onscreen trying to get you to sympathize/empathize with him.  My opinion is the only reason he was cast was for his looks.  And truthfully, I don't even find him that good-looking.

What really took the cake for me is the discussion with Chance's husband and his student about masculinity and femininity during the bachelor party.  I guess he was trying to be deep, but his explanation about how he deals with a hyper-feminine fianc was just stupid and made not a lick of sense.

PLOT

The movie serves as a closing to the series, which ended abruptly.  Noah and Wade are tying the knot in New England.  Shenanigans ensue when wedding-planning time comes.  Alex, who is planning the wedding, loses his mind trying to keep everything together.  Chance and his husband are in a rut in their own marriage.  The ho' of the group doesn't disappoint with his ho-dom.  You have Chance's student who tagged along who finally comes out to his parents, at which point they disown him.  And that's pretty much it.  Nothing earth-shattering, almost bordering on hackneyed.

CONCLUSION

The ONLY reason this is getting four stars is Alex and his tomfoolery.  He made me laugh so much that I couldn't stop watching.  Other than that, if you plan to devote time, do so because you want to see a nicely wrapped-up ending to Noah and his friends' lives.  And expect the same type of acting that you got in the series.",1503360000,,2493,4.599088838268793
