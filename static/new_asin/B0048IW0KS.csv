4286052,5,B0048IW0KS,"Every Season only get's better on Ghost Whisperer and Season #5 is no different. Jennifer Love Hewitt shines as Melinda Gordon. Her family complete with the birth of Jim (David Conrad) and Melinda's first child Aiden Lucas Clancy. We jump 5 years ahead to Aiden's 5th Birthday. Guessing the Producers went that way in case the show was canceled by CBS and we'd never know about Aiden's Gift/Powers. Good move since that is exactly what happen. CBS dropped it. Huge Mistake and ABC passed on picking it. Another Huge mistake since the show has a very large and strong fan base. Maybe the Jennifer Love Hewitt, who is one of the Producers could get the rest of the Producers to continue the show on DVD or even as a Online TV Show.

Ghost Whisperer should NOT be sent into the Light!",1276387200,44,781,4.539007092198582
4286053,5,B0048IW0KS,"I have been watching this series for the past two years. I own all seasons to date and the more I watch, the more in love I am with Ghost Whisperer. I watch this show because Jim Clancy reminds me of my husband. He is kind and compassionate and blatently in love with Melinda.  Jim is the type of man that all men should aspire to become. Men that are strong and supportive, but who have their own interests and passions.

  The dialog between Jim and Melinda is extrodinary, they share their joys and sorrows, doubts and dreans, even their fears are expressed with openness and kindness. The writers of this show should get awards.

  I have recently purchased the fourth season. I held off for about three months since completing the third season because someone told me that something bad happens in the fourth. Even though the fourth season was difficult to watch, I am inspired by Melindas courage to keep moving forward. I truly enjoy the fact that Melinda does have an unusual way of helping others deal with grief.

Excellent cast, believable experiences, Excellent TV series",1266883200,5,1083,4.693121693121693
4286054,5,B0048IW0KS,"The first time I saw Ghost Whisperer on TV I was HOOKED! The story lines behind the series episodes continue to fascinate and intrigue me. These story lines lead to the next installment in such a subtle yet powerful way that I can hardly stand the wait until the next episode.

Jennifer Love Hewitt is the perfect acting match for anyone having the ability to communicate with the Spirits...think me crazy, but I believe there ARE people out there who do exactly what she does. I had an out of body experience when I was 5 years old. I was very sick with a fever of 105.6 (according to my parents) and I truly believe I died for a short time. I could clearly see my body laying in the bed as I looked down on it from high above. I witnessed my mother rushing my body to the tub and pouring ice over it until I returned to it. That memory is burned into my mind like it happened yesterday.

As members of my family have passed on over the years, I have always felt a calm, very serene presence in the minutes, hours and up to a few days after their deaths that has made me a true believer of ""The Light"" and an afterlife. And because of ""The Ghost Whisperer"" I'm not the least bit afraid of death and am actually looking forward to it.

In my humble opinion, every episode has an extrememly emotional cleansing effect that I carry with me for days, weeks, months at a time...some are more powerful than others.

I want to own every single episode of this one.",1259798400,37,1458,4.252707581227437

4286072,5,B0048IW0KS,"I really liked this series except for one thing.  The main character that spoke to ghosts was always dressed in low cut, revealing dresses or tops.  For a business woman, she dressed inappropriately.  Every episode, just about, I commented to my spouse that she dressed like she was a trying to show off her breasts.  Most husbands would not like their wives showing their chest to everyone.

4286135,5,B0048IW0KS,"Just a note on one episode in season 5. Episode number 4 ""Do Over"" may have been the best Ghost Whisperer episode and the series entire run. Despite having watched the series a few years back, I somehow missed that episode until now.

The strength is in the story and benefits from having some terrific actors playing the rolls of the haunted and their ghosts. Not only the the guest stars (including Mike Farrell) nail their roles, but even those actors outside the primary story line were perfect. ""Awards"" got to Bryan Batt, David Andrews and Farrell.

Jennifer Love Hewitt as usual has to play the link between the show's tragic, comic, dramatic and romantic scenes without losing grip on her own character. Despite all the moving pieces in this story she never puts a foot wrong, and Camryn Manheim also is successfully stretched in many different directions in her roll. Other cast regulars also nailed their parts, as usual.

I can't believe it's taken me so long to get a review of this show up!

MILD SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I loved this show from the first episode, and was pleased that each season became stronger than the previous one. The relationships between Melinda and Jim, and Melinda and her friends was delightfully natural, which made the happiness and heartache all the more real.

Melinda: her abilities grew, which I would expect, and the writers did a great job at not making her gift turn over-the-top or silly. She is still one of the most relatable characters I've ever watched on tv; every heartbreak, every laugh, every ghost interaction... For one hour every Friday night I could easily forget my stresses of the day and enjoy the GW world.

Jim: I really loved Jim. He was a great character and a perfect pick for her husband. Their marriage wasn't perfect but the love he had for her was clear, and his support and encouragement was a nice change from a lot of shows.

Delia: I am so happy this character walked on stage in Season Two (as much as I loved Aisha in Season One). Delia is fantastic character and the friendship she forms with Melinda was great to watch. Her own storylines were wonderful and I wish we had more Delia episodes :)

Nate: Even though they aged him after Season Two, I liked having Nate around. I think he brought a lot to show, and his interactions with Jim, Melinda, and his mom Delia were excellent.

Professor Rick Payne: I really enjoyed him on the show in Seasons One and Two. His storylines were great and his friendship with Mel and Jim and Delia were lovely to watch. I missed him greatly when he exited the show.

Eli: While I liked Rick more, the addition of Eli was a good one. His own unique ability to HEAR the dead was fun to watch.

What I DID NOT like:

Jim's death in Season Four was gut-wrenching, but when his soul jumped into another body I found that plot rather interesting and eventually warmed to it. In Season Five, while I was happy Jim was around, I really did not like that they used the same actor. I LOVE David Conrad and did not want to lose him, but I don't think they should have killed him in Season Four if they were just going to use the same actor in Season Five because he is in ANOTHER BODY. We do not really see that other body in this last season, and it is something that really irritated me, no matter how much I enjoyed having David still around.

I also wasn't that happy with the final episode. I think they moved too fast to end the show and the storylines were all very rushed. I expected much more in the showdown with the Shadows, and was left feeling very disappointed in that and the way the last scene of the show.

Overall: Loved it. And I miss this show terribly. There's really nothing on now that replaces it, so I'm left to watching my dvds :)",1462752000,,2850,4.385199240986717

Well after watching it on Amazon, he technically didn't die, he became a GHOST. After his death, the show became medeoker, I just couldn't get past that he was a now a ghost. Therefore, I couldn't believe there LOVE. Their affection towards one another just didn't seem genuine. Overall, the show was good and kept me intrigued but they shouldn't change Jims character.

There were too many scary things going on in this season. The shadows and the older man Carl would freak me out. I wish they wouldn't have involved Melinda's son Aiden in everything like those bad people really wanting ghost children. I like more of the positive aspect. I would have liked to have seen Aiden helping spirits cross over. Overall it was a disappointment, but I was sad to see the show end.",1446854400,,556,4.304761904761905

4286240,2,B0048IW0KS,"After a hiatus from GW for a while (due to the fact that I was greatly disliking it's increasingly negative focus, IMO), I decided to give it another try because I love Jennifer Love Hewitt, Conrad, and some of the other actors.  I got hooked again and then came Season 5 - extremely negative and dark.  I'd get so ticked off that I started yelling at Melinda and others to call on God or a Higher Power, most especially in this particular episode.

I'm really disappointed in John Gray focusing on such negative entertainment.  He should have listened to Mary Ann Winkowski, the real life Ghost Whisperer and consultant.  I am glad though that James Van Praagh made sure the episodes included forgiveness and happy resolutions, although sometimes not for everyone.

The cast is great.  Camryn's character would continue to really tick me off.  And Christoph is awesome too.",1444176000,,874,4.818791946308725
4286241,5,B0048IW0KS,This show is by far awesome.  It is a good family show and every episode ending is a tear jerker.  I like the fact that every episode had something much different to offer which kept my interest.  I also like the fact that Melinda doesn't come acrossed as a typical corny soccer mom.  The show is very down to earth and heart touching.  A must see:-)  I wish there were more seasons:(,1443139200,,384,4.263888888888889

I would like to have seen her son pick up where she left off at that would make for a nice come back there was few things I don't think they thought threw thou for when Jim died and then came back as Sam he took the name Jim so wouldn't there be questions as to why a man who don't look like Jim and has the looks of Sam would change his name to her dead husband name but other then that one miner thing I still loved the show and still wish they had not taken it off the air,  Bring it back or have new one with her son picking it up and showing what other powers he has now as a grown up.",1439337600,,667,3.625

Add in the creep-tastic child that had no expression and couldn't act with the way off the wall crazy themes and I was definitely glad this was the last season of the show.

4286335,2,B0048IW0KS,"I enjoyed the first 3 seasons, but was found it strange that so many things seemed to just get left off with no closure. You spend those seasons hearing she is something extra special, but here you find she pales next to her son, and yet it still focused on her. Jim is suppose to be Sam, but everyone calls him Jim. I would think people would ask if she needed help for calling her 2nd husband by her 1st husband's name. It is like he just became a doctor and season 4 being of little consequence. Then of course it all ends with so much going on. You are just like where is the rest.",1421193600,2,585,4.051724137931035

4286337,5,B0048IW0KS,"One of my all time favorites. This show could bring a tear to my eye with almost every episode. Melinda Gordon (Love-Hewitt) shares her big, incredible, sweet, warm, heavenly heart in such an intimate comforting way, we boys can't help falling in love with her. But, seriously folks every episode is a spiritual event akin to an altar call. The miserable wandering spirits need to make peace with those who wronged them or seek forgiveness for their own misdeeds. Many just need to say goodbye to loved ones or apprise them of danger or relieve them of any guilt they carry. Whatever the tragedy Melinda Gordon acts as the forensic spiritual investigator, the final messenger, grief therapist for the living, advocate for abused, overlooked or penitent souls needing to make things right. Melinda is a most intimate comforter to the living and the dead, though the strain on her clearly shows. Strongly emotional, powerfully heartfelt and sweetly relieving this show penetrated the heart and soul like no other series except JOAN OF ARCADIA. Seeing it end is heartrending. It's irreplaceable. TV at it's VERY FINEST.",1420416000,,1116,5.037837837837838

Whoever the moron was from ABC that decided to cancel the show in the middle of Season 6 and not finish it is a genuine idiot. How can they sleep at night knowing they canceled one of the BEST shows ever? Someone needs to knock some sense into that persons head. They should have made Seasons 7, 8, 9, & 10 too and maybe more.

4286381,3,B0048IW0KS,"I liked the overall series and I may have had some greater expectations for the grand finale.
I found most of the plots for the fifth season episodes, a bit cliched and somewhat silly.
Their was an overuse of melodrama in a few episodes that made it just a ""corny"" soap opera or simply ridiculous.
Any show on the paranormal with an emotional sub plot needs to be integrated and clever in its delivery. This lacked both.
There were a few episodes that were a little creative and made you pause ,wondering it's possibility.
I reccomend seeing this just for closure but this was not the best of the show and probably a sign why it left the air.",1360022400,,642,4.4033613445378155

The fifth season, takes a whole new direction, now we do not only see Melinda crossing over ghosts (sometimes dangerous ones) but also we get introduced in some new foe, the shadows, the shadows are after Melinda's son,Aiden,now Melinda faces the decision of taking away her son's gift by telling him he cannot see ghosts and that is all a lie, and changing him forever, or fight the Shadows that everybody seem to be afraid of...Amazing season and I would love if this show would continue...What can I say...",1354752000,,900,4.521472392638037

I want to get the fourth and fifth season and it will be complete. I also have the Ghost Whisperer Games that I love to play. Jennifer Love Hewitt is a beautiful and talented actress and hope she makes it in these shows that she's doing now. I hope that CBS will put the show back on the air.

The romance between Jim and Melinda is just GONE, I mean they act like roommates and are hardly affectionate with each other.  He is actually downright RUDE to her on at least one occasion when he is frustrated over the ghost stuff, it's such a total shift from the first four seasons.  I did not mind the addition of their son, he was cute and brought some interesting story lines, but with Jim and Melinda being so completely out of sync my attention just wandered.  I also didn't really care for Jamie Kennedy, I can't even remember his character's name.  As an actor he did a fine job, but first they got rid of Andrea, who I just LOVED, and then they got rid of Professor Payne...he was hilarious and SO inappropriate sometimes, and they replaced him with Jamie...who was just okay.  The character did nothing for the show IMO.  Delia was also just an okay character.  So basically the removed all the excitement and spark from the show for me, and with Melinda being the only interesting person left on the show, I can see why it went off the air.",1305763200,8,1213,4.36

4286407,4,B0048IW0KS,"This has been my favorite show for some time now, but if they'd only known that this was the last season of the show before the network cancelled it, they could have finalized alot of things and tied things up neatly before the series ended.

I was really hoping for Andrea to come back in Melinda's dreams or visions, watching over Aiden maybe.....or maybe have Professor Payne return...possibly as a ghost (I never could figure out why even though they were such great friends, he takes off on sabbatical and nobody ever sees or hears from him again, let alone mentions his existence).  I also hoped that some of the people Melinda helped in the past (living and dead) would make a reappearance in the final season.  But sadly, they didn't know the show was going to be cancelled.

I did enjoy this season and i do recommend it to any fans of the show.  However, it did take a little while to get used to the ""skip ahead 5 years"" thing.  Like suddenly Sam Lukas is back to being called ""Jim"", he's a doctor, and other things that were kind of jarring at first.  Still, this was an excellent series, and Season 5 is a must-have for any Ghost Whisperer fan.",1297123200,,1157,4.429245283018868
4286408,5,B0048IW0KS,"I have loved this show from the beginning, and this season stood up to the previous standard set, imo.  It took a little while for me to catch on, and understand the whole ""shinies"" and ""shadows"" thing, but that was either the producers point, or because it had been so long since I watched season 4 that I forgot some details.

I was glad that I was finally able to see Jaime Kennedy as Eli, and not see him as Jaime Kennedy anymore, I think that his performance improved a lot, I was able to take his character a lot more seriously.  I also enjoyed that Delia was a lot more accepting of the goings-on, but still managed to maintain her hesitation about the involvement of her and her family.

The boy who played Melinda's son did a great job, he portrayed such innocence and and acceptance of the ghosts and other beings he saw, I almost could believe they are a part of his real life also.

4286415,5,B0048IW0KS,"Hi
Firstly many thanks to Amazon for their speedy delivery and stress free service for me to then sit and watch hours of one of my favourite programmes.
This season seemed darker than the last..
I still can not get use to Jim being Jim again not even a snippet of the actual body he is in.
The skip to their lovely baby to a boy was probably expected it could have taken a lot of drawn out episodes to get Aiden to school.
I enjoyed all of the episodes and it kept me entertained as usual and of course in tears in some.
The turn around of Aiden saving his mum was good.
Oh Melissa's fashion are always an interest to me, but why you would wear some of the things she does on a normal day is definately questionable.
I certainly hope there is another season to come can anyone tell me???
Enjoy everyone

4286416,4,B0048IW0KS,"Great series but by season 5 it was getting a little goofy. The writers tried to keep the show fresh by making major plot changes throughout the 5 seasons the show aired. Unfortunately, they never quite seemed to finish one plot line before plunging into the next. I won't spoil it for anyone who has not watched it but suffice it to say you don't really need to watch the episodes in order nor do you need to watch season 1 before you can understand season 4 for instance.

Well what can I say...but I`m a little disapointed.
Here`s why;
I was expecting hewitt and friends to go all out this season but I do not think they did so. They did not give the ansers to the big questions and the final episode was mid range.
 Don`t get me wrong, I`m glad I`ve seen the fifth season but I was expecting more.

The Lead Actress Hewitt, I do have issues with.  She can act.  I will give her this credit.  She has issues with dress and character situations.  This whole series is based on a young, ""gifted"" woman with paranormal abilities.  Her platform for the series is a small town, simple life of a paranormal person yet her dress reflects bizarre personality which minimizes the premise of the series.  The personality of the actress is NOT in symmetry with the plot of the series.  Not to mention this series is NOT intented for young viewers however they will see them from time to time and quite frankly Hewitt's dress d/o can be unwise for children to be viewing.  We worry about guns, cigarettes and violence in hollywood however neglecting the influence of someone such as Hewitt and how she appears to the audience and how this could influence the society at large.

The beginning of the season through everyone for a loop with five years missing and her having a child and adopting a new concept with the shinies. It still had you going and it still kept the love, caring and mystery the show always had. Should they of slowed down a bit yes but they didn't and unfortunately people stopped watching (not me) and they are canceled... very sad and I hope it comes back sometime.

4286423,5,B0048IW0KS,"I know this hasn't come out yet (I'm sure it will be as bittersweet as any other end of a series DVD), but I just wanted to prelude its release with a plea to other fans of this show.  Maybe if we buy the DVD's right away it will show CBS that they made a HUGE mistake.  If sales were through the roof maybe they would realize their mistake and try to pick it up again.  This happened when they cancelled Angel, only everyone involved had moved on to permanent jobs already (Bones, Supernatural).  Jennifer Love is just doing small movies and guest spots right now, the writers are developing new projects, but maybe it's not too late.  This just sucks.  Why are network people so stupid?  If you go buy the numbers and not by the fan output and desire you are not really seeing the true popularity of a show.  How many people have a Nielsen box anymore?  This crap that they pull is the reason why I watch the shows on DVD instead of TV.  But I'm Canadian so it's not like my ratings count anyway.
  Shuffling the time slots every few months, changing days to see if it will go up against another network's most popular show, showing re-runs for 3 or 4 weeks every few new episodes....  Just stand behind your show and leave it alone and you'd really see how popular it is you business school morons.  I don't think we'll ever see a network hold onto a show for 10 years again... gone are the days when a show like Friends or Seinfeld can fluctuate in ratings but still stay until THEY want to leave.  I miss the days when TV didn't disappoint me on a daily basis.  We're really not all as stupid as you think we are Hollywood, we're getting tired of your crappy movies, re-makes of EVERYTHING that has ever made money in the past and your cheap reality TV shows. Just tell me Medium isn't next!
