2828320,2,B000PUB2A2,"The two stars are for the lovely raga played continuously during the practice by musicians right there in the yoga studio. This DVD gives you the options of either David's instruction or Sharon's instruction in the voiceover. What you get here is not really instruction, but rather a poorly-timed loose verbal prompting through a very traditional (and frankly, unimaginative) sequence of postures. There is no warmup; the sun salutation flow begins full on and at a very brisk pace. If that's how you like to practice, then this video might be for you. OTOH, if you like to linger in a posture and if you like to hear reminders about body dynamics to help you reap the benefits of an asana and get deeper into the practice, you're out of luck with this one. If the DVD still appeals to you after reading this review, please buy mine! It's been viewed twice, and is in like new condition; I won't be using it again.",1199491200,16,914,4.579268292682927
2828321,5,B000PUB2A2,"I wasn't familiar with this couple, but bought the DVD based on Amazon reviews.  I'm glad i did- it's a full workout, gentle yet challenging and they offer alternate poses for the less flexible.",1197936000,3,194,4.705882352941177
2828322,3,B000PUB2A2,"I've been practicing yoga for almost 10 yrs and 4 yrs ago I came to NY on a visit. While I was here, I went to the jivamukti center. I felt like I had finally made it home! However, this dvd falls way short of that experience. First, the good...*the practice itself is very good *I love the music(they have a live band playing) *I love the way it was filmed. But thats about it! I cant tell you how many times I looked up to see what pose they were doing, only to see a musician. This dvd is definately for advanced beginners. I think the more advanced yogi/ini's will be disappointed. I do have to add though, that I moved to NY to study yoga and the classes at the Jivamukti center are second to none! This dvd  does not capture that magic or feeling. I hate myself for giving this 3 stars but I think you'll be better off with Bryan Kest Power Yoga or Kundalini Yoga w/ Gurmukh.",1196208000,47,881,4.122093023255814
2828323,5,B000PUB2A2,I love this workout. It's so peaceful. Great pace. Not at all fast like they suggested it would be. The routine on the dvd is amazing. I loved it.,1193184000,5,146,4.068965517241379
2828324,5,B000PUB2A2,"I loved this video and consider myself intermediate to advanced.  I can do backbends and headstands but really who cares.  A great video has great teachers, music that helps you go deeper into your practice (i.e. the tamboura does it for me) and an easy to follow sequence. They both have calm, peaceful voices and offer different insights on their separate audio tracks.  Rodney Yee and Erich Schiffmann are great too but it is so nice to mix it up.  If you want to feel happy and peaceful this is the perfect yoga DVD.",1191542400,13,520,4.5
2828325,3,B000PUB2A2,"I love Jivamukti and consider myself an intermediate yogi. Only the first 10 min of this video were challenging, the rest was slow and boring, I didn't work up a sweat. Shannon's verbal ques were before she actually did the movement which was annoying. The set and music was nice and I appreciated her explanation on why shoulder stand and head stand are important. But in the end I didn't get a good yoga practice out of this video.",1326499200,,433,4.493670886075949
2828326,5,B000PUB2A2,"I generally attend a studio where many of the teachers were trainged at the Jivamukti Center in New York.  I was looking for a video for the days I could not fit a practice in at the studios that gave me the same studio feel with an intermediate level practice.  This is it!  It has a nice flow sequence, floor poses, back bends, inversions, meditation.  Best video I've purchased for moderate length, intermediate level.  Beautiful music.",1325030400,,439,4.723684210526316
2828327,1,B000PUB2A2,"Just received my order of 3 dvds. Each packaged separately with the most annoying packaging! So annoying I felt compelled to write this review! Change the packaging, please! Each dvd was packaged in an envelope that is sticky inside. It required minor surgery to remove each dvd from each envelope!!! Please change the packaging! I will probably never buy from this retailer again. Sorry.",1318550400,,388,5.078125
2828328,4,B000PUB2A2,"Pretty much echoing others' sentiments:

beautiful layout and setting
good steady instruction but beginners will need to watch it a few times to follow without watching (true wherever you practice no?)
beautiful music EXCEPT for the noted Savasana hoe-down (""You are not a bad, messed-up person"" (subtext-you think you are)). How inappropriate, what a jolt thematically and musically, what were they thinking??? Seriously thinking about redubbing the earlier music to mask this part.

I found the practice rather short when you take into account the length of time spent in shoulderstand and headstand. Are there any dvds with practices over an hour, rather than a quick 'workout'?
Would be nice to see a pt2 with a denser, longer sequence.",1282780800,2,740,5.2100840336134455
2828329,5,B000PUB2A2,"I love this dvd. i get to choose shannon's voice or david's. The music is incredible as well. i dug this so much that i try to practice with this as much as i can. i have never been to new york to experience jivamukti first hand, after practicing with this, i'm wanting to go there now!",1282262400,,286,4.035087719298246
2828330,5,B000PUB2A2,"Finally, a comprehensive yoga video that gets me away from my own sequencing, which is primarily how I've practiced yoga for the past nearly 3 years. With a few little tweaks to it, plus a lit candle for atmosphere, this video rocks a practice that rivals in difficulty the All-Level classes at the studio I go to a few times a month. Some of those classes have been Jivamukti-inspired, taught by both guest and staff teachers, some of whom themselves graduated from the 250-hour Jiva teacher training program. That being said, as an intermediate in a slower but just as intricate practice, it would take me a little time to work up to the difficulty of this program. In particular, though, I do find Sharon Gannon's voice to be particularly comforting and inspiring; and so this program is a keeper.",1267488000,,800,4.7214285714285715
2828331,5,B000PUB2A2,"If you are familiar with basic Yoga and don't need to be taught each position individually, this is a great DVD.  Otherwise, move on.

In a nice setting with nice (live performance) yoga workout music, the authors take you through a complete workout routine.  Not too fast or slow.  I like the option of choosing to hear either the male or female instructor leading the progression.  You can also choose no voice over at all.  This is great to work out to at home, for a daily practice, or a fill in when you can't make it to class.

If you want a good, well presented Vinyasa (flow) Yoga session given by thoughtful professionals, you will be happy with this.",1264550400,2,660,4.45
2828332,4,B000PUB2A2,"Professionally recorded, this yoga session is very soothing with emphasis on seamlessly integrating the breath with movement. This is not for novices due to the lack of instruction, but those who know how to do the asanas/poses correctly w/o any direction, and being able to know the poses by their Sanskrit name & not just English is better since the English name is never given.
The music is a live band, and you have the option of voice overs from either David Life who will always tell you when to inhale/exhale, the pose name, and generally is quiet, or Sharon Gannon who tells you always when to inhale/exhale, the pose name, as well as more mind/body awareness, and occasionally the benefits of poses (especially inverted).
The session is made for advanced beginners as the hardest poses are full wheel, and a headstand w/forearms done with David while Sharon stays in a high downward dog. The pace is almost yin yoga, you will be holding the pose for several/many breaths to really feel the stretch and to relax into the pose.
Grounding/chanting - (3 min)  standing, just sometimes chanting OM
Sun Salutations - (6 min)  mostly mountain, standing back bend, standing fwd bend, downward dog, plank, chaturanga, cobra, and adding lunges
Standing Poses - (13 min) warrior 1, triangle, warrior 2, side angle, pyramid, twisted prayer lunge, seated twist, fwd bend over simple seated cross legged pose, plank, chaturanga, cobra, downward dog. Repeat with the other foot fwd. This requires more lower body strength as you are doing all those poses on the same leg before allowed to switch. Next wide legged seated fwd bend, chaturanga, rest in downward dog.
Balancing - (2 min) Intro about balancing while resting in downward dog, side plank on both sides, chaturanga, rest in cobra
Back Bending - (6 min) locust, bow, bridge, wheel, rest, knees to chest, reclined spinal twist knees to side, downward dog.
Forward Bending - (4 min) intro while in staff/seated legs straight, single straight leg fwd bends both sides, butterfly, star seat (looser butterfly stretch), both straight leg fwd bend.
Inverted Poses - (13 min) shoulder stand straight legs up, plow & knees to floor, fish, child's pose, down dog w/head cradled between forearms in 1/2 headstand then full headstand if ready, child's pose.
Meditation/Savasana - 5 min seated & 5 min reclined

This was a very soothing session with great yogis, the only issue I had was when holding the pose, though I enjoyed the reminders of when to  inhale/exhale slowly overall, a few more benefits of the pose or general mind/body advice in between would have been better then hearing the actual counting of the breath (inhale/exhale 1, inhale/exhale 2, inhale/exhale 3 .... inhale/exhale  24, inhale/exhale 25, inhale/exhale 26...) was very annoying, like a very slow aerobics session.

Bonus:
Bios of both yogis
Over one minute freestyle yoga - demonstration of them doing harder poses
Almost 9 min. facial massage - voiced over by Sharon which includes a couple yoga facial poses, massage of the face/ears, and stimulating acupressure points of the face w/calming music.

2828333,4,B000PUB2A2,I love the live indian music and that you can have with Shannon's or Davids voice giving the instructions. You can also have just the music. Nice!  Good balanced workout.,1246752000,,170,4.666666666666667
2828334,5,B000PUB2A2,"If you are new to yoga, this is not a good place to start. This is definitely an advanced practice with quite a few challenges. The cueing is good but you have to know the poses beforehand so you can follow along quickly. Also, the headstand and shoulder stands are held for an extended time. Some of the poses are held for 10 to 26 breaths. You need to develop some endurance or you just have to try to hold the poses for as long as possible.

The set is gorgeous with flowing curtains, candles, pillows and carpets. David Life and Sharon Gannon sit and exercise on orange yoga mats. The music is beautiful with violin, drums, a sitar and flute performed exclusively for this workout.

The practice begins with sun salutations and works into standing poses like triangle, and warrior II. You might recognize plank, fish, downward facing dog, upward facing dog, cobra, backbends and forward bends. All the poses flow together well so you are getting a good cardiovascular workout.

What I liked most about this workout is the atmosphere (sunlight streaming into the room) and the fact that they include a meditation session and extended relaxation. What I didn't like was the music they played during the final relaxation and the comment about worshiping mother nature. Other than those two things I think this is a perfect workout with great appeal to anyone looking for the full yoga experience.

Something you might want to try is putting sandalwood, patchouli and ylang ylang in an oil burner. That helped me to relax and made the practice feel more authentic and healing.

2828335,4,B000PUB2A2,"For me this is a nearly perfect routine (full disclosure- I typically do kundalini yoga, but among the other yoga styles jivamukti is my favorite.) It has great pacing and isn't as predictable as most yoga DVDs. Even the sun salutations are slightly different- a typical ""surya namaskar a"" is followed by a variation on surya b.

I found myself feeling invigorated throughout rather than tired. I suppose this routine doesn't push me overly hard (I am approximately intermediate level), but it offers a great variety of poses. I like that the disc was willing to take a risk and include both shoulderstand and headstand (which I do against a wall for support). I also loved the bonus 10 minute facial massage, which is lovely to do with the facial serum / oil of your choice.

Regarding the music- I adored the background music throughout except for, as most everyone else has mentioned, during savasana. It didn't drive me to distraction as it did most reviewers, but I did roll my eyes the first time I heard it.

I had done some of the jivamukti CDs before this (I nabbed them when I visited the main studio on a trip to NYC), and found the DVD true to my prior experiences. Anyway, the Ana Brett/Ravi Singh DVDs will remain my favorites discs, but this is a great addition to my collection.",1230768000,4,1294,4.593073593073593
2828336,5,B000PUB2A2,"This was my first experience with any kind of yoga. Not really knowing where to begin, I searched the web for information on all forms, and was really impressed with the videos I saw for Jivamukti. My daily exercise routine included running, push-ups, and sit-ups, but I really wanted something that would help 'center' me better. I have to admit, Jivamukti was very challenging at first, and I was wondering what good all my other exercise was doing for me, because I felt very 'weak' trying to follow David and Sharon through the exercises. But, as David says at the beginning, in time you will be amazed how your body and mind will benefit by keeping with the routines. I am still not totally one with Jivamukti, but I'm not giving up, because it really helps me physically, but more importantly, mentally.",1229731200,3,809,4.704225352112676
2828337,4,B000PUB2A2,"I enjoyed this DVD very much.  For all those reviewers stating that there is very little instruction: It states right on the front that this DVD is for the experienced beginner. The lack of instruction is a plus for some of us.  I hate when a DVD has too much instruction.  I know the poses and don't need an extended discussion about how to get in them. So if you are a yoga newbie, then this DVD is not for you.

My only small gripes are: After few minutes of standing meditation,they jump right in to some fast paced sun salutations without any warm up poses.  I did find the sun salutations a little faster than I would have liked but that is a minor issue.  Another minor issue is that they tend to talk a lot.  This isn't such a big deal for me through out the workout because they tend to talk about the poses and their benefits, along with also counting the number of breaths out loud through a lot of the poses. But during the 2 meditations (one in the beginning and one right before Savasana), I would have liked a little bit more silent time.  And lastly I was a bit distracted by the song they chose for Savasana.  During the whole practice the music was so soothing.  So I find it odd that the decided to add a depressing country-like song during Savasana.

But overall the workout was great and challenging. You will sweat.  The DVD to me had a very spiritual/meditative soothing quality that a lot of other yoga DVD's tend to lack.  The atmosphere is wonderful, and the live Indian music was so beautiful.  David and Sharon both have very calming voices.  I would highly recommend this yoga DVD. And I am looking forward to purchasing ""Power to the Peaceful Yoga"" and ""Chakra Balancing Yoga"" by David and Sharon as well.

2828338,2,B000PUB2A2,"I had heard so much about Jivamukti! I really liked the book, and I was excitedly awaiting this video. I thought it started off with a bang and was great for about the first 10 minutes. After which, the poses were not that imaginative and I noticed that the sequencing was slightly off (ie; the verbal instruction did not match the movement). I didn't feel like I got a great yogic workout after this video. The song during Savasana was a totally cheesy instrumental bad folk song. I think this dvd is not worth the asking price. If you get it, buy it used...",1222560000,10,559,4.384615384615385
2828339,5,B000PUB2A2,"David and Sharron have been such a HUGE inspiration to me as a teacher and as a student! I LOVE this dvd. Not just because of the wonderful instruction, but it is so COOL! They have the musicians right there in the room with them. And the studio looks like a great loft right out of New York! They are are an amazing pair. I have no clue how old they are now, but I know they've been around a very long time and they STILL have such an amazing practice and wonderful spirit! You've also got to check out their practice with Michael Franti (an amazing artist!).&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TAMARA-S-YOGA-FUSION/dp/B001DDY6RG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TAMARA'S YOGA FUSION</a>",1221177600,,722,5.398230088495575
2828340,5,B000PUB2A2,"David Life and Sharon Gannon are true Masters of Yoga.  This is the first video I have seen that the couple have not produced themselves through their Jivamukti ownership.  It is a bit shorter than their usual CD/DVD's and a little less vigorous, but offers enough challenge for all levels.  The ambiance is beautiful with kirtan players, wooden spiralling pillars draped in soft cloth, soft moving camera work and an option to have Sharon or David direct the asanas.  I liked the home-grown feel of their first series, complete with cat siddi appearances, but this DVD is also inspiring and uplifting and, as usual,  sends a message of Yoga that goes far beyond the mat.  Shanthi.",1208649600,4,681,4.827586206896552
2828341,5,B000PUB2A2,"I greatly enjoyed practicing to this DVD because - unlike a lot of videos made by the beach, or on rocks, or on what look like desert islands or the moon (Shiva Rea's), this one had a very real sense of being in a live yoga classroom, such as one would find at Kripalu Institute (with the wonderful musicians).  For those who find the music annoying, I believe there are music choices available.  The poses are done slowly, and with beauty - David does the more challenging version, Sharon the more beginner or intermediate.  It is not a difficult program if you are already familiar with the poses and terms.  I was also caught up short a bit with the cowboy song during shavasana (and I think that - for a commercial DVD they should have chosen something more vanilla) but I let myself go into it & had a great time feeling that I was settling down by a fire on the trail out West, with a tin mug of warm drink, under the stars, with the cattle & horses all settled in the night.  By keeping an open mind, I ended up being delighted. THis might have been someone's idea of a Krishna like life surprise!",1206748800,8,1104,4.288461538461538
2828342,2,B000PUB2A2,"I don't understand why, during savasana, the soundtrack includes a guy strumming an acoustic guitar and singing a song containing rather vapid lyrics. I find it completely disruptive. All the rest of this practice is accompanied by instrumental music played on Indian classical instruments, with NO SINGING, and it works fine as a backdrop to the instruction. Why introduce some folky singer-songwriter at the end, when it's necessary to ""pacify the sense organs?"" The whiney singing does absolutely the opposite for me. And yes, I could just mute the television, but there are cues from the instructors that happen afterwards, and it would be counterproductive to keep my eye on the clock (DURING SAVASANA) to know when the song is over and it's safe to un-mute the TV. I think it's a poor choice of music for that part of the practice, and if I'd read about that in a review beforehand, I definitely would not have put it on my xmas wishlist!",1206057600,10,944,4.7975460122699385
2828343,4,B000PUB2A2,"It's a good intermediate workout.  Pacing is nice, maybe a little bit too fast.  There is very little instruction going on here.  There appears to be the assumption that the viewer already knows all of the asanas.
  The pacing is brisk, and the sequencing is creative.  Both audio tracks are relatively well executed, although I liked David Life's narration better than Sharon Gannon's dialogue.
  There are many asanas here that are not taught well enough for a beginner.  This is a video for someone who has attended yoga classes for a while.
  I would reccommend this DVD for an intermediate yogi/yogini who wants to have an alternative when he/she cannot get to the studio.  For this purpose it is an excellent choice.  I would NOT reccommend this for someone new to yoga.  Many of the asanas are complicated, and a novice might find it difficult and a bit confusing.",1202774400,3,871,4.758389261744966

BUT once you get to corpse pose some sort of weird country-feel good hybrid comes on and that was very confusing. My way to handle this is just turn off the DVD right before savasana and do my own. I think I can handle that. 
This DVD is more ""personal"" than those mass produced blank background ones and there are personal touches and sentiments throughout. If you buy this, just keep that in mind. It really is a good practice.",1438041600,,684,4.3858267716535435

The teachers are good, you have a choice of male or female instruction which I think is a great idea.
Probably the only thing I don't like is the final resting pose and the choice of song, not too sure how it fit's in. Would rather of listened to the live instruments played throughout which are very soothing.",1337558400,,617,4.107438016528926
