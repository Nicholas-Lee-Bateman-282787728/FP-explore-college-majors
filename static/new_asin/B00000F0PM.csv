To my dismay the video is barely an hour long with disjointed vignettes from India's independence movement and about fifteen other African countries.  The result is some terrific clips from an era gone by but presented in a disjointed manner.  My guess is the producers wished to cram in material to make a hour long PBS episode.  The product gives one the impression that the producers needed to get something ""out the door"" so as to meet a deadline.  Too bad!
What an opportunity squandered.  This could have been a terrific history lesson if events were presented in a cogent manner.  To do the topics justice this could have easily been a eight to ten hour series in the Ken Burns Civil War genere.  Instead we get extremely brief ""interviews""  and some terrific footage.
What a disappointment!  Surely a history of the Indian sub-continent and the continent of Africa deserved better.  I look forward to the day when this important chapter of twentieth century history is presented in a serious manner.",1013385600,3,1124,4.863157894736842

This film puts together a variety of media clips from the colonial and independence eras, along with interviews of the men and women (now advanced in years) who discuss life under colonialism and their roles in the independence movements.  It's great for college viewers in the U.S., as they often have only the very faintest glimmer about the rise and fall of imperialism in Asia/Africa.  What they do know has been taught to them on classes focusing on Western history, so I like to show them this film to let them see and hear the other side of the story.",1004313600,3,588,4.689320388349515
