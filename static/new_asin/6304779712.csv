7877416,5,6304779712,"This is a wonderful movie.  It combines the hilarity of Leslie Neilson with education in an attempt to dispell the myths of the dangers of the ocean.  It talkes about many of the oceans dangerous creatures from jellyfish to conesnails.  It tells very factually about the creatures, how dangerous they are, and how you can avoid the danger.  Neilson keeps the movie light while providing information on the dangers in the sea and just how mythical they are.  I am a marine biologist and I found the movie to be very accurate though it was a bit dramatic.",974246400,5,553,4.6020408163265305
