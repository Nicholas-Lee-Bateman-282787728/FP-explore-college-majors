8485474,5,B005STD78U,I loved Gary Player's conversation on his life lessons and can't get them out of my mind.  I wish I had a transcript so that I could read them every day.  He talked late in the conversation with Charlie Rose about how to treat people and how to live your life.  What a beautiful man this is when he can speak so eloquantly about how to live the best way possible.,1318896000,,363,4.084507042253521
8485475,5,B005STD78U,"My wife and I (neither of us golfers) absolutely loved the interview with Gary Player. Articulate, insightful, accomplished, poised and candid but kind. Certainly not a one dimensional guy. It was a treat to be able to see and hear Mr. Player respond (accurately and thoughtfully) to Charlie's questions. And Charlie Rose, once again, offers ""an oasis"" to which we can repair to find quality individuals and hear their views on a variety of subjects. Wow!
