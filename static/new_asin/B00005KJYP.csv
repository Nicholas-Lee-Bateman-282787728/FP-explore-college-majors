Lever's biography, and have sung both Barbiere and Le Nozze, and jumped at this dvd....but my French is next to non-existent, so I can't really enjoy it.  I saw a trailer on You Tube that had subtitles so I naturally thought it had them.......wrong.......really disappointed.  It looks like it is great, but I miss so much.",1486771200,,389,4.878787878787879
7943593,5,B00005KJYP,Excellent movie with amazing acting! The only negative is that it doesn't have English subtitles and there were some parts that I had a hard time understanding (I had to watch this movie for a university French class).,1453334400,,218,4.7631578947368425

7943595,5,B00005KJYP,"I love and use this book frequently, as I do talks on opera for the public in the Los Angeles area.  Beaumarchais was a fascinating
historical personage for many reasons.  Scoundrel to some, patriot to others, and always interesting.  He helped the beginnings of
the French Revolution by his plays and pamphlets, and paid for arms for the American forces out of his own pocket (at the order
of the French king).  He was never repaid in his lifetime, but his estate received partial payment later.  Scoundrel?  Now the DVD
gives us a good picture of many of his talents, and is well done; however, I do wish it had come with English sub-titles.  PAL I
can handle, as transfer to American format is possible; but adding the language is a tough job.  Find me a copy in NTSC with
English sub=titles and I'll be totally content.  As it is now, I still have to translate the dialogue for those audiences who would
like to know more about this fascinating character.  Thanks for being there for us  Joann Porter Toll",1404518400,,1009,4.55
7943596,5,B00005KJYP,"I see this film has come onto DVD at long last.  The listing mentions American Sign Language as the only subtitle track....which is curious, because why (and how) would sign language be necessary if there were printed English subs.

Can someone please clarify whether the subs are indeed in English?

I have been waiting what feels like an eternity for this wonderful film to come out on DVD.....",1322697600,,396,4.794117647058823
7943597,5,B00005KJYP,"I can't comment on the historical accuracy, but from what I do know of Beaumarchais I would say they succeeded with flying colours in representing his character, aswell as the atmosphere of the time. While the film is light-hearted and very funny, it doesn't take the easy option of caracaturising him as a cheeky libertine but also explores his serious ideals, which are essential to understanding the plays (and operas). And then of course there's the added bonus of the incredible Fabrice Lucchini who is equally at home creating the twinkle-eyed scoundrel, the passionate idealist, and the ordinary man who nervously awaits the verdicts of censors and public. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.",1223078400,,695,5.0
