1383864,3,B00004ZESV,"FIve years ago I would not have complained a bit about the sound and picture quality of this show but now with the standards being so high for everything, this appears poor in comparison.
Yes, the sound is mono and the picture is blurred and grainy, but no more that a VHS release. It still looks good and sounds OK. The band is really swinging and having a lot of fun up there on the stage.
I have a VHS copy of a UK performance which was made 20 years ago and is almost as good as this DVD release, but which company will pay the money to get it cleaned up and re-released?
My major problem with this DVD is the lack of extras. You get a (static) menu, a photo gallery (4 pictures from the show - isn't that what pause is for?) and a discography.
But all that said, for a budged DVD, it'll have the joint jumpin' and is well worth adding to your collection.",1023753600,4,859,4.088757396449704
1383865,1,B00004ZESV,"This audio track on the DVD is mono.  The audio quality is not much better than that of a cheap clock radio.  Video is 4:3 (non-widescreen)

1383866,5,B00004ZESV,"I've owned for years a VHS featuring part of this same concert, that I actually attended at the Zenith Concert Hall, 16 years ago. On this DVD, you can find nearly all the show that was dispatched during the Leisure Tour, without question the most explosive and creative tour Kid Creole ever made. This represents nearly 90 minutes, whereas the video only featured approx. 60 minutes of the show. The director of this video made a very good job, in re-creating the atmosphere of the concert that occured that day (the Zenith Concert Hall can hold between 4,000 and 6,000  people, according to seats configuration; and it was packed and very hot on that evening !) The picture quality is very good (better than on the video) and the sound quality, despite whatever has been said, is very good too (better than on the Hi-Fi Stereo VHS release, even though it is far from the level of some recent 5.1 productions). But this would still be a terrific show to see even with a bad sound and picture. Kid Creole means a lot of fun, energy, exceptional musicians (ah that horns section !)and some very original and perfectly synchronized choreography ! Don't hesitate and go for the buy, especially at that low price !",987638400,6,1210,4.654205607476635
1383867,4,B00004ZESV,"This was a favorite VHS video a few years ago. When it was released to DVD I snatched. Kid Creole's music is breezy and worldly, hot and cool. His big band, with great horns and percussion, works hard and you are going to want to dance. The focal point is the Kid, with his Panama zoot suit and flashy guitar, and of course the coconuts. Calling these three beauties back-up singers doesn't do them justice. Their synchronized dance moves are very sexy, and they never stop. This band gives it their all and they are obviously having a great time. The Kid's music is very melodic, very catchy, and you will have songs running through your head. The picture quality and sound are improved over the VHS video, but the production shows its age and doesn't quite have the polish of recent concert videos. But it also doesn't have irritating MTV-style shaky cam quick cuts. Overall a very fun and satisfying production. The DVD has songs not on the VHS video, a nice surprise. Recommended.",976147200,,984,4.628571428571429
1383868,5,B00004ZESV,"So after reading reviews and seeing rating for Rammstein in Paris, I was kind of iffy if I should get it. I did and I love it. Yes camera does change a lot but not to the point where I would get headache, like some people posted lol. I will say this that the colors were rich sound was terrific and awesome cgi effects here and there. This one is unique and awesome job by Jonas.

1383869,1,B00004ZESV,Rammstein was great but the editing of the concert was hard to follow with all the camera changes and very hard to follow the show.

1383873,1,B00004ZESV,"I have been waiting for this to be available for so long and was looking forward to the original idea of seeing it in a theatre with other Rammstein fans. The theatrical release was,I guess, scrapped.

Picked up some adult beverages and zoomed home because I knew the Blu Ray had arrived! YAY!!!

I got through about a third.

Ich Tu Dir Weh that was released on youTube was great!!
It KILLS me to be derogatory about one of my favorite bands.

Yes. It's the editing.
And the mix isn't all that great either.

 Volkerball (2006) Is the best (imo) Rammstein concert film.

I'm still glad I bought it because I want to support the band, but I doubt I'll ever dust it off again.

Kills me to say that.

1383874,1,B00004ZESV,"Absolutely the worst live video I ever owned. The Sound is amazing, the video editing makes it unwatchable. This is not an exaggeration, almost no camera shots last a full second. If you try to count to ""one thousands one"" you will rarely get through the word thousand before the camera shot changes again. It is completely impossible for your brain to process what it is seeing. It's almost like watching a strobe light where each flash is a camera change. It's just a completely frustrating experience.

I saw this tour, it was amazing, it is so sad that the live video is so bad.",1501545600,4,582,4.542857142857143
1383875,5,B00004ZESV,"What sets 'Rammstein Paris' apart from their past live DVDs is an appropriate facelift to an already tantalizing live show. This was their ""best of"" tour, which was amazing to see in person, and equally spectacular on blu-ray. You get all the typical over-the-top theatrics, with some special effects thrown in from time to time. I think hardcore fans blew the ""over editing"" part out of proportion a bit. It flows with the music's tempo, and the special effects are more enhancements than distractions, just adding to an already epic concert/film",1501027200,2,547,5.021978021978022

1383898,5,B00004ZESV,"If you want this blue ray or cd (or both) get it from the bands website!  Ordered this back in May and the delivery date kept being pushed back. I ordered it from the bands website and got it to Alaska, from Germany, in 3 days. Price was pretty decent as well. The concert video is AWESOME!!",1499731200,,291,4.105263157894737
1383899,3,B00004ZESV,"I'm a huge fan of Rammstein, so it's with a heavy heart that I must give this show such a mediocre rating.

What they did right with this show is what they always do right: A great performance with plenty of pyrotechnics and interesting theatrics. The inclusion of Buck Dich (which I don't think is featured in any live show you can buy except the uncensored version of the Live Aus Berlin VHS!) is definitely nice and, as a fan, is enough to make me glad I bought this. Additionally, the track list - sitting at an amazing 22 songs - has a great mix of old and new.

So why only 3 stars? There are 3 reasons regarding the visual element of the show which are almost enough to turn me off sitting through it again. My first issue is the CGI. Certain songs feature small bits of CGI - e.g. Til with a long lizard tongue - and it looks so fake that it's just distracting. There's no reason for it to be there and it's used so rarely and infrequently that I don't know why they bothered to include it, not to mention that Rammstein's much beloved theatrics don't really need any additions to make them better.

My second issue was the constant camera angle changes. Sometimes it seemed to change angle half a dozen times in only a couple seconds. This hyperactive camera work was often disorientating and made it hard to concentrate on what was happening. For me the worst part was when the guitarists were playing with their guitars on fire, and angle changes so often and usually to such bad angles that it's hard to actually get a good glimpse of the action.

My third and final issue is that the camera angles hardly ever focus on the crowd. This may sound minor, but it makes the show feel like a mediocre music video rather than a concert. Going from this to any of their other live shows (where the audience is focused on a lot more) makes you realise just how important it is to see the faces of the individuals in the crowd, singing along and yelling, for a good sense of the concert atmosphere.

My final thoughts? The show isn't bad; the issues just hold it back from being great. If you like having your music on CD, then getting a version with the CDs is probably worthwhile due to the large track count and good selection. Ultimately, considered by itself, it's a good watch and something great to witness if you've never seen Rammstein live before, but compared to their other shows I would recommend Rammstein in Amerika over this. In fact, I would also recommend Volkerball over this, and, if you are fine with the low-quality 4:3 video and more limited selection of songs, I'd probably even recommend Live Aus Berlin over this.",1499126400,,2642,4.439175257731959
1383900,1,B00004ZESV,"UNWATCHABLE !!!!  seems like other people are trying to be polite...and I understand that everyone has his one opinion,vision and understanding....but the guy who made this movie/concert/blu ray is an IDIOT !!!  he is a degenerate !!! don't buy it if you love Rammstein...",1498867200,,272,5.159090909090909

1383902,4,B00004ZESV,"...I enjoyed the hell out of this production. Yes, some of the cutaways were fast but the slow motion sequences (particularly the ones involving the pyrotechnics) and the little production moments: Till's snake tongue, Flakes' lightning fingers, the song titles, etc. added a unique touch to what is already a supersonic assault. I've seen Rammstein several times live, and I own their other three DVDs, so I understand the group trying to branch out and give the viewers something beyond 'standard concert footage.' (Not that there is ANYthing ""standard"" about a Rammstein gig!) While ""Volkerball"" still remains my favorite Rammstein video, ""Paris"" is not to be missed.",1497916800,2,670,5.271028037383178

1383907,1,B00004ZESV,"This is more a collection of Music videos than a concert movie,, The Director it seems had to justify the use ( and the cost ) of 30 cameras and he use them all in each song so he has like 2 seconds per shot. !!! You can't really see any of the players performing ( that for me is the idea of a concert movie ) for more than 2 seconds.. and I really doubt that anybody could watch this more than once...Just get the CD for the superb music and watch for free the promo video on youtube ( all songs on the bluray are like that..) like you have to see the whole show in less than a minute !!",1497225600,,589,3.796747967479675

1383929,2,B00004ZESV,"I absolutely love Rammstein, but this video is unwatchable due to seizure like editing. Cheezy CGI effects, filters, picture overlays and fades.

I do not recommend this video to anyone without a serious case of Attention Deficits Disorder.",1496361600,3,318,5.134615384615385
1383930,1,B00004ZESV,Just reiterating what others have already said. I doubt Rammstein is capable of putting on a bad show but Jonas kerlund ruined all of that with the editing. Never ending fast cuts (if you have epilepsy and watched this then you're probably already dead)... horrible special effects. I would love a video of their show with a single camera facing the stage so we can see actually SEE the show because I've seen them live 3 times and it's incredible. Rammstein is one of my favorite bands... I have a tattoo on my forearm... I will never watch this show again. Get the audio CD if you want this show.,1495929600,7,598,4.445454545454545

1383932,3,B00004ZESV,"As everyone else has mentioned, this is actually a great show. Rammstein always puts on an over-the-top performance and this is no exception. It's definitely something to be seen.

Unfortunately, the editing here just ruins all of that. I'm actually a fan of the fast-cut movies like Domino, but it doesn't work here. Cuts are made to the temp of the song and terrible effects and filters are thrown all throughout the show. Multiple cuts per second doesn't work and really takes away from the show.

If you want to see a better Rammstein show, check out Rammstein in Amerika on blu-ray which doesn't have these same problems. It's hard to recommend paris, even at the discounted price it's sold at.",1495843200,10,699,4.768595041322314
1383933,5,B00004ZESV,"The Blu-Ray looks and sounds fantastic. But as the other reviews mentioned the editing style may be a turn off for some. It is indeed very fast for most of concert, usually matching the tempo of song being played. The official Rammstein YouTube page has several songs from disc that you can watch before deciding to purchase.

There are several added effects such as CGI lightning on Flakes hands during Du Hast and Til with snake tongue and eyes during another song, I've only watched once so far but I'm guessing every song has something added somewhere. This wasn't made to be a typical concert recording, if that's more of what you're looking for then consider purchasing their 'Rammstein In Amerika' Blu-Ray.",1495670400,9,713,4.844262295081967
1383934,3,B00004ZESV,"Awesome concert footage from the Made in Germany Tour... but I hope they never go with this director again.

1383936,2,B00004ZESV,"I ordered direct from the band's website and it showed up before it's official release date, even went as far as ordering the laser-cut edition. Everyone is right, the cutaways are brutal. The blu-ray quality is amazing and the footage is incredible, but it's almost not worth it. Not a fan of the title animation before every song too.",1495324800,8,336,4.711864406779661
1383937,2,B00004ZESV,"I saw the Made in Germany tour twice when it came through the U.S., and it was one of the most spectacular things I've ever seen. I have been looking forward to this Blu-Ray for a long time.

If you're buying this just for the music, I think you'll be quite pleased. The sound is fantastic, very robust and polished. The set list is excellent, the performances are flawless and inspired. Also, I appreciate the subtle cinematic enhancements. (Was that a vampire in the audience? If I was a security guard, I wouldn't have let that guy in!)

Unfortunately, that's about all the good I can say, and it breaks my heart. Everything else that might have been great about this is completely ruined by the editing. 2-4 shots per second I'd say...for 2 hours!

It's not just that it gives the viewer a headache, although it might. It really doesn't matter how great the footage is, because nothing appears on screen long enough to appreciate it! It doesn't matter how marvelous the show is, because all you get is one throw-away close-up after another, or a wide shot covered by a blurry overlapping effect. Not for one moment did I feel immersed in the show, or connected to the performers. It's shameful, cruel, almost like the editor is taunting you:

""Look at all this great footage I got, and you'll never see any of it, because I'm just going to chop it all into confetti and throw it into a pile!""

It's a sin to treat such good footage like this, what a waste. Also, there's actually nothing about Rammstein's music that calls for this kind of fast editing. Rammstein is relatively slow and burly, it's not thrash metal!

In the credits I saw 14-15 people with the word ""EDITOR"" by their name, maybe that's the problem. Every single one of them should be blacklisted as far as I'm concerned.",1495324800,43,1791,4.56386292834891

I have had problem in the past with lightning fast editing (see AC/DC.....) but this one takes the cake. I have never seen so many fast cuts and multiple screen shots PER SECOND.
So much potential, this one could have been great but was instead completely ruined by the director/editing job. Awful. If you want a Rammstein DVD or blu-ray, stick with ""live aus Berlin"", ""Volkerball"", or ""in Amerika"", all of which are much better than this.",1495238400,20,518,4.831460674157303

They include: Pierre, a cabaret dancer who learns from a cardiologist that he has a severe heart condition; lise, Pierre's sister and a social worker, divorced with three children;Roland, an academic at the Sorbonne and expert on the history of Paris;Jean,a vegetable market vendor and separated from Caroline,a fellow market worker;Philippe,Roland's brother and a successful architect whose wife Mlanie is pregnant with their first child;Khadija, a student of North African background, who is looking for work;Laetitia, a Sorbonne student who begins a relationship with a fellow student; and Benoit,who tries to cross the borders of France from Cameroon without the necessary legal immigration paperworks.

French director Cdric Klapisch keeps the movie moving but making the viewer excited on what is going to happen in the next scene. While the story is definitely far from being realistic as the number of characters in this movie and the events that happen in their life get to intersect in more ways than one in one big and busy city where millions of people live. But nevertheless,one would definitely still find the movie both enjoyable and entertaining. This ensemble drama has great performances from the cast and each character are involved in an intriguing story of their own.",1421452800,,1400,5.1946902654867255

1384108,3,B00004ZESV,"Paris is a complex web of interconnected stories that messily tie together, leaving a lot of loose ends but also simulating the messiness of real life.

The film centers around Pierre (Duris), a young man who finds out he may be dying from a heart condition and will need a transplant in order to survive.  His sister, Elaine (Binoche), is the only one in his family he initially tells of his condition and she promptly moves her and her children to live with him though they have previously been distant.  Pierre, a former dancer, is no longer able to perform due to his heart condition, and now finds pleasure in observing the lives of those around him--nods to Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"".  Among those is an attractive young woman living in an apartment across the street from his, and her story is perhaps just as interesting--she is torn between two suitors, one a fellow student and the other an older man.  While Elaine is assisting Pierre in the physical sense by helping with meals and cleaning, she benefits as much as him if not more from their repaired relationship--after Pierre convinces her to live her life fully, Elaine opens up to a friendly longtime acquaintance, with satisfying results.

The acting in this film is brilliant, even though I speak English and watched most of this film on mute, just reading the subtitles, I didn't feel that I missed out. Binoche's Elaine is melancholy and wounded at times, and sexy and playful at others--depicting her character in a believable and yet striking way.  Pierre, the lead, is played by Duris and the expressiveness in his body language shows his introspection and struggle with his own feelings about mortality.

The only thing that I didn't quite get was the plot...a few of the stories fit well and intertwined, but a lot of the extraneous side stories didn't really fit in with the main plot and instead confused me, making the film difficult to follow (i.e. the man immigrating to Paris from Africa, the whole backstory with the professor, etc.)  The film was overall good, because of its memorable acting, but the tangled web of story lines left a lot to be desired.",1388361600,,2138,4.772357723577236

The ending tied the whole movie together and at least to me I felt strongly about the importance of appreciating every precious moment of your life.  That being said the movie itself is not without flaws; it lags in parts a bit and the characters never truly develop so individually I never got into any of them.

1384200,2,B00004ZESV,"I was a student in Paris when it was still....Paris.  Maybe because I was young but it was magical and beautiful then and the people were charming.  I have been back a few times and frankly found the people crankier but it was still beautiful.  Now, I don't know if this film is an accurate picture of present day Parisians but I found theses characters hard to like or to care about.  Maybe it was just the film maker's point of view.

The story line is one that sounds good on paper....glimpses of the lives of several sets of people of different social groups and how their lives interact.  It's an idea that has been done very well elsewhere, as in ""Crash.""  Here somehow it doesn't work so well. The main story line concerns a young male cabaret dancer who has just been told that he has a heart disease and that only a transplant can save him and that gives him just a 50-50 chance of survival.  His sister, a single mother with three small children, begs a little time off from her social work job in order to move in to take care of him.  Somehow although he's not bed-ridden and seems to function well enough he can't manage to help her with any of the housework so she does it all while he mopes around looking out the the window and goes through old photos. Every time we see him a sad tune plays on the piano.  Somehow that's not enough to give me any sympathy for him.  He calls a girl he once danced with in 6th grade to tell her how much he loved it. She hangs up so he drinks a beer and vomits and the social worker sister has to leave her job to rush home and hold his head.

That's about the tone of it.  At one point when the dancer gets a call saying there's a heart waiting for him he rides in a cab and waxes supremely sentimental about Life in Paris....""Oh why don't these people realize how lucky they are!""  He does utter one true statement...that no one is happy there and they love to complain.  That's probably why this film, which is supposed to be meaningful is such a downer.

There are a few good moments, mostly with Juliette Binoche who is still quite beautiful.  The best is when she does a strip tease before the guy from the fruit stand.

I have never cared for Binoche.  I found the beginning of the film to be hackneyed and trite.  The character of the professor was off-putting and a bit creepy.
Nevertheless- by the end of the film, I was won over and I think the film is good but not great.
One of my favorite activities (shared by many visitors to Paris) in Paris is watching the life swirl around me on the streets and in the surrounding houses.  This film captures this experience.  We are brought into the interlocking worlds of a number of characters whose lives intersect in ways they do and do not perceive.  Although there are some truly clunky aspects (the affair between student and prof was not credible, the young man's illness seemed to be conveyed in an unconvincing manner, the last-minute intersection of the professor and the dying man, the motorcycle accident, the fashionistas in the warehouse) of this conceit in the film, the melange is ultimately messy, unresolved, and poignant.  One is left with a true appreciation for the people whose lives touch our own.

Some of the best scenes:
the small-minded owner of a boulangerie
the party scene (what great dancing)
the father-to-be
the cruelty of the young student
the tenderness between the fruit seller and Elise
Elise and her children

The last scene- where the dying man looks upon his nieces and nephew, says good bye to this sister, and takes a cab to the hosptial- was just like the film iself- hackneyed, trite,and clunky in places ---but ultimately true-to-life, messy, unresolved, poignant and somewhat magical.",1318204800,4,1748,4.742574257425742

We should all be as prettily perhaps dying as Romain Duris, a professional dancer who is told one day that his heart is going and he will need a transplant.  What he does then is mope around his lovely Paris apartment, which seems to overlook a cemetery, babysit his semi-estranged sister's three kids when she (Juliette Binoche) moves in to take care of him, and observe the comings and goings of his neighborhood.  He develops a crush on the student across the way who is being stalked by text messages from her professor.  And so it goes -- the professor has a damaged relationship with his brother, the vegetable man where Binoche does her daily shopping still loves his ex-wife, etc., etc.  The best scene is when the smarmy professor dances to Wilson Pickett's Land of a Thousand Dances, and it is the song, not the dance that makes that scene.  There's lots more, most of it scarcely worth a second glance, until the final scene of Pierre's taxi ride to his transplant appointment when director Klapisch appears to suddenly realize he hasn't shown us enough of The Eternal City so under the pretext of demonstrations throughout Paris necessitating a roundabout route to the hospital, the ride becomes a Paris-lover's dream with many long loving shots of its boulevards and monuments, and of course the obligatory glances at some of the characters whose lives have glanced off Pierre's.

Of course the screenplay has to be interesting but these two always hit it off.

I don't want to spoil the film but I just want to say that filming in Paris, during winter, the storyline, the actors and the different stories within created a this piece of true cinema.

Not surprisingly, the movie is visually beautiful, and thus does justice to the beauty of Paris.  But more importantly, the movie uses its distinctively French style and sensibility in order to probe many facets of the human condition in a sensitive, penetrating, and balanced manner, thus taking us on quite a journey of diverse vicarious experiences, thoughts on questions big and small, and a wide spectrum of simple and complex emotions.  In short, the movie gave me a lot to ponder, and I may need to eventually watch it again.

At the end of the journey, it's clear that this is by no means a feel-good movie, and my net feeling was closer to poignance than happiness or even ambivalence.  But the movie does also illustrate the possibility and value of savoring, while we can, the positive elements of life (a very French attitude), some of which can be a source of hope, so the movie has an uplifting side as well - just like real life.

Paris is my favorite city, with SF and Berlin close seconds. After about 20 visits over the last 40 years and some brief spells living there, I love any chance to be in Paree, even if just in spirit, so Parisian films delight and intoxicate with memories and the promise of another visite. Paris the movie offers some nice moments and some good acting, and is a fine film...but as a Parisian classic I can't really rank it up there with Amelie, Breathless, Le Dernier Metro, Day Of The Jackal, Diva, Les Ripoux, and a few others.

The highlights include the acting of Binoche and Lucchini, a good script, and of course some fine shots of the town. But despite the realer than usual feel, something didn't quite click for me here. Many might call this episodic flick Altmanesque, and I'd agree, for better and for worse. It's got his multiple storylines, one or three characters too many to get much involved with any of them, and an ending that's a little too forced and tidy, even though nothing is resolved. Which is fine, but I wasn't left with the same feeling of wonder I get when watching any of the other mentioned films, or the same longing to jump on a plane that instant and walk the town for 12 hours day after day.

I speak decent French and the subtitles are actually more accurate than usual, though the language is actually nowhere near as idiomatic as one might expect...which is one of my qualms here. It sets out to be a panoply of Paris viewpoints, but there's less local feel than you might expect for each arrondissement and the very different vibes each place has, except perhaps the Pavillon des Viandes...they got that right!

The stories are interesting but never really gripped me, and there was more angst and less amused Gallic shrug than I've encountered in the town and France in general. I can't quite put my finger on it, but the happy slyness I love in so many Parisians one meets during non-tourist season (go in late fall, winter, and early spring!) seems rather absent. But perhaps that's a function of the town being, as is said here, for rich people now. It can't be getting any cheaper to live there, no doubt. It's the working class Paris I was looking forward to seeing more of here, but it all felt like a movie in the end.

A good movie, well shot and acted, no doubt...but without the magic of so many other Paris films that seem more suffused with the City of Light's glow, both inside and out.",1280275200,2,2450,4.496629213483146

The sister has her own problems of the heart as do the film's secondary characters who orbit around the dancer's story.

1384250,5,B00004ZESV,"I'm in the middle of a project to view as many Robert Altman films as possible. He made 35 films in a long career and they feature ensemble casts whose stories intertwine. Cedric Klapisch, a talented French writer and director, follows the Altman model.
My first Klapisch film was Chacun Cherche Son Chat (When the Cat's Away)from 1996 which features a declining Paris neighborhood with well written characters. Paris is like an expanded version of that film.
My next two Klapisch films, L'Auberge Espagnole from 2002 filmed in Barcelona and Russian Dolls, the 2005 sequel, featuring St. Petersburg, follow an interesting group of international students.
I believe Paris is his best film so far. It shows many
faces of the City of Light and the ensemble cast is led by Romain Duris and Juliette Binoche. We have not seen such a captivating view of Paris since the Montmartre of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Amelie (2001).",1272585600,3,913,4.973856209150327

So, 'Paris' seemed like a custom-made movie made specifically for my viewing interests.  And, it delivered.  All that and Juliette Binoche, too.  What's not to love?

Klapisch's script interweaves two main story lines and some smaller Parisian vignettes.  It's the Duris/Binoche tale that is the clear winner.  The movie percolates whenever the two of them (portraying brother and sister) are on-screen, either together or in their own storylines.  The second major narrative thread - involving Fabrice Luchini's character's midlife crises and panic attacks - is, at best, less compelling and, at worst, slightly creepy.  Luchini's late-50s history professor hits on his early-20s student (Mlanie Laurent) via a series of increasingly inappropriate text messages.  Kalpisch makes a misstep here: right at the point that Laurent's Laetitia is convinced she has a stalker, Luchini's Roland is clumsily forced to reveal his hand.  The upshot is an unexpected, offputting consummation of the 'relationship.'  That doesn't feel credible at all.

By comparison, the Duris/Binoche tale is fantastic.  The heart of the story is Duris's character's heart.  In short, it's failing.  Time is running short.  Binoche and her young, adorable children move in to help while he hopes a donor comes through.  You'll find yourself counting down the moments for Klapisch to return to their story.  I was especially taken by the scenes of Duris's character (Pierre) watching movies of his earlier self as a Moulin Rouge dancer.  Klapisch and his filmmakers have gone the extra step of making those reels look like older, grainy, amateur footage.  It's a wonderful effect.  Later, Duris and Binoche host a party.  Pierre's ex-fellow dancers attend and we see them in the living room doing the dance steps we saw on the earlier tape.  Little details like this are redolent of the Klapisch touch.",1268956800,3,2702,6.438888888888889

The characters' connections to one another are mostly happenstance, and often known only to the audience.

The focal point of the film is the story of Pierre (Romain Duris), a retired cabaret dancer with a degenerative heart disease. Pierre needs heart bypass surgery. The doctor has told Pierre that he has a ""50-50"" shot of making it through the surgery.

With an ailing heart, and no longer able to continue his dance career, Pierre spends his days in the company of his sister Elise, and her three children, wandering around his apartment, standing on his apartment's balcony, and looking at the Paris cityscape. Elise has taken time off work to be with her brother.

But Pierre is sidelined with an ailing heart, not a broken leg.

Because Pierre's illness, unlike that of Jeff's, is life-threatening, his ruminations carry an existential weight that is utterly absent from that of Jeff's. Jeff in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rear-Window-Universal-Legacy-Series/dp/B001CC7PPI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rear Window (Universal Legacy Series)</a>&nbsp;is more bored voyeur than brooding philosopher.

Pierre's thoughts are concerned with loftier matters: the seeming obliviousness with which the inhabitants of Paris, a city teeming with life and business, take for granted their health.

In the film, on a number of occasions, Klapisch fills the screen with the solitary image of a confined Pierre gazing out his apartment window, like an explorer standing on a cliff's edge above the ocean. Below Pierre, the cityscape of Paris unfolds with the ebullient color palette of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sisley/dp/0714838926/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sisley</a>&nbsp;painting.

Only on a few occasions does Pierre's gaze ever stray into a neighbor's window - through the apartment window of the beautiful Mlanie Laurent (Laetitia). Pierre's brief, voyeuristic foray is only a function of his existential angst - time is potentially running out for him to make love one last time. He is thinking Laetitia may be for him a possible lover; the audience knows the futility with which his hopes rest (Laetitia is already entangled in two coinciding love affairs - and Pierre is an awkward lover).

The tight borders that confine the world, which Jeff spends his days observing in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rear-Window-Universal-Legacy-Series/dp/B001CC7PPI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rear Window (Universal Legacy Series)</a>, lead only to him getting entangled in a murder investigation. But Paris for Pierre conjures up meaning and clairvoyance. Paris helps Pierre make sense of his situation. The expansiveness of the world he contemplates provides him with a perspective he has never had before.

The film ends with Pierre riding in a cab to his heart surgery, staring longingly out at the city that he fears he will never see again. On the ride, Pierre points to the spiritually-lost Fabrice Luchini (Roland Verneuil) strolling down the sidewalk, and proclaims that he wishes he could be like Roland (to Pierre, a stranger), carefree and healthy.

But Roland is far from carefree. He is a self-absorbed, middle-aged man, who had just had his hopeless affair with one of his students (Laetitia) end nastily. Roland's isolation is compounded by his father's recent death, and the contempt with which he treats his brother, and what he views as his brother's conventional life. Roland, by indulging in his own fear of loneliness, over the course of the film, only becomes lonelier.

As a healthy stranger walking the streets of Paris, Roland is to Pierre someone of whom to be jealous. Through Pierre's reduction of Roland's life, and his reduction of the lives of all the other strangers walking the city-streets of Paris, Klapisch illuminates an important irony.

The perspective that Pierre finds in his personal wrangling with death is also blinding; Pierre is a poor empathizer (he covets the life of a man who is clinically depressed and utterly lost). Even the vilest of men to Pierre become romanticized - and with great reason - they have life! At least on the surface, they have life. Locked in the shackles of his self-absorption, what kind of life does Roland really have?

Towards the end of the film, a minor character, Caroline, played by Julie Ferrier, catapults to her death in a motorcycle accident, highlighting a second irony in Pierre's situation.

Pierre's awareness of his own situation imprisons him. The unfairness of his situation seems far less unfair when compared to Caroline's. Pierre has a 50-50 shot of living. Caroline is dead. But Pierre, if he saw Caroline zooming on her motorcycle the very day she died, would have probably thought - if only I could be like that woman! Carefree and healthy! Zooming around like there is no tomorrow!

How can we gain the perspective that the imminence of our own mortality provides us, when our mortality is not imminent? For Roland and Caroline, and everyone else for whom death is seemingly far-off, mortality is more a source of anxiety than clairvoyance.

Perhaps the average citizen's obliviousness to mortality is what frustrates Pierre the most. Pierre cannot help but to lament that his experience is lost on millions of people, as they buzz around Paris like a bee colony, answering to the needs of their everyday lives, while Pierre consciously and quietly marches to his own end.",1259020800,19,7280,6.277555110220441
1384255,4,B00004ZESV,"PARIS is a kaleidoscopic view of that great City of Light inhabited with a variety of individuals each of whom is consumed with life and love and living and dying. Cdric Klapisch has written and directed this richly populated canvas as a background of a tender story of a Moulin Rouge male dancer Pierre (Romain Duris) who is diagnosed with a terminal heart disease requiring transplantation if he is to survive. But in the end the many characters introduced in 'incidental stories' have become so interesting that, instead of providing simply a background for Pierre's portrait, they become an integral part of the drama as well as indelibly stamped on the viewer's mind.

Pierre has kept his illness secret, yet when faced with the dire concept of a transplant he confides in his sister lise (Juliette Binoche), a single mother of three, who takes him in to fill his boring days of self confinement. There is a palpable magic between the two as lise attempts to bring Pierre out into the world of hope and of living. Incidental to her life are trips to the market where she observes the lives of the grocers and discovers their private lifestyles, information shared freely with the viewer. A Parisian North African communicates with his brother at home with a postcard of Paris, seducing the brother to brave all odds to come to the city. We also meet a jaded art historian Roland Verneuil (Fabrice Luchini) whose father has just died, an event that devastates his emotional brother Philippe (Franois Cluzet): Roland proceeds to have an affair with a student but his physical awakening is abruptly altered by the realities of Parisian life while Philippe progresses through his seemingly mundane existence toward a surprise ending. The grocers seek adventures with a group of girls among whom is the ex-wife of one of the men and in the process we observe the varying reactions of interpersonal relationships tested away from the eyes of group participation. All of these stories are white noise to Pierre's situation, and though lise is able to make Pierre 'dance again' at a party of his fellow dancers she organizes, in the end Pierre is left to care for lise's children while lise finally opens her frozen heart to a new romance. At this point Pierre receives the inevitable telephone call that a transplant is ready, and as he proceeds to the hospital he opens his mind to the beauties of Paris. Some of the vignettes we have observed are completed while most simply continue - just like life in the glorious city so often considered the city of love.

All of the many roles are enacted by gifted actors, the cinematography offers us a different view of Paris than that of postcards and travel brochures, and the musical score ranges from popular music to the haunting 'Gnossiemme No. 1' of Erik Satie which is Pierre's theme music. At times the viewer feels lost in the complex overlay of the many stories being told, but settling back in a chair and just absorbing the film results in an evening of Parisian intoxication.

1384256,5,B00004ZESV,"What is it about French films that makes the best of them so deeply reflective in a way that few American and British films achieve? Maybe it's that France itself is such a beautiful and evocative country, maybe it's that the French have a lifestyle that, for us non-French, appears so stylish and romantic... whatever... but when they get it right they really are in a different class, and ""Paris"" most definitely gets it right.

Beautifully filmed, brilliantly acted, and underpinned by a superb soundtrack, the film explores ""real"" peoples' lives slowly and above all subtly. Not a great deal happens, and there are no conclusions to the stories involved - a guy gets diagnosed with a life threatening heart condition, another chap falls in love with one of his students, a lonely single mother and a market stall trader are hesitantly drawn together, and an African dreams of getting to Paris to start a new life. That's about it really. But it's the way that this is all put together & explored that makes the film, and which achieves its objective of trying to capture what Paris is to people who live there or dream of living there - which of course means that its infused with their, often vague, hopes & fears and it has no clear & tidy ""Hollywood style"" endings... life's not like that.

At times funny, at times charming, and ultimately quite moving, Klapisch directs the film without reverting to heavy-handed sentimentality or high drama to make his points.... in fact, exactly the opposite: witness the fleeting, beautifully poignant shot at the end of the film as the African compares the view on the postcard of Paris that has driven him to make his journey there, and which underpins his hopes for the future, with the reality of it... nothing more needs to be said or filmed to capture what he must be feeling.

Perhaps the greatest credit to ""Paris"" is that, even though it's two hours long, subtitled (which is never the easiest way to watch a film), and devoid of any clever plot twists or unexpected surprises to hold your attention, by the end of it all... you really don't want it to end. It's that good.",1248393600,144,2128,4.684491978609626
1384257,3,B00004ZESV,"The sound is lousy, AM radio quality, but this is worth buying just the same. Such a great performance. Kid Creole is a great songwriter and his performances are great live acts.
The visual part of his performances is so fun and powerful, I can't understand how it is possible that this is the only Kid Creole DVD available in the market at this moment!!!
Producers should check out their vaults for Kid Creole tapes...
But please, with a decent sound!!!",1185580800,,454,4.617283950617284

The real gem among these is a terrific version of ""Say Hey"" by the incredibly energetic Andy Hernandez--a true funk classic which alone makes this DVD worth the purchase.",1029888000,3,293,4.547169811320755

The director has the camera angles shifting waaaaayyy too much, it really becomes annoying. Still enjoyable concert, reminds me of when I was watching them live some years ago. A worthy addition to your collection, just mind the camera.",1522972800,,393,5.061538461538461
