4861024,3,B005R2RDEC,"I love barre workouts, and I was really looking forward to receiving this DVD. I did the workout today, and I was disappointed. Many of the exercises were strikingly similar to those in the Physique 57 DVD. I realize that barre workouts are all somewhat similar to each other, but here the similarities were really obvious. Sometimes, the instructors in Burn at the Barre even used the same phrases to those of the Physique 57 instructors. I felt like the creators of Burn at the Barre just purchased the P57 DVD, took notes and released something very similar.

To be fair, the creators did have some original exercises in the video as well, but there were just too many similarities. On the plus side, Burn at the Barre has a tough leg section. My legs were burning by the end. The butt and arms section were a bit light, but the ab section was good. There were some unique moves that combined abs and inner thighs. I also liked how the video showed the beginner, intermediate and advanced versions of the exercises. I thought they handled that really well...better than most other exercise DVDs I have done.

Overall, the workout was underwhelming. I would say, save your money, and just buy Physique 57.",1333756800,38,1207,4.661971830985915
4861025,5,B005R2RDEC,"I JUST finished doing this work out, I love it, I love it, I love it. I when thru the whole workout with a smile, you'll work the whole body, and because it has three levels, you can grow with it. You can take it easy when you feel tired, or kill yourself when you have the enrgy and the strength. THE TEACHERS ARE amazing, excellent cuing. I can't be more pleased. Really buy it, you are not going to regret it.  Did I tell you that it is an excellent price for the product?",1333670400,14,475,4.0

4861032,1,B005R2RDEC,"This DVD, (in my opinion) does not deserve a single star. I normally refrain myself of giving bad reviews, i try to be very polite referring at what went wrong and the reason I don't like certain products, etc.. But this DVD, I am going to categorize it as ""a very bad joke"". I am a very disciplined person while exercising, I like to be corrected by my instructor or in this case Dvd's. I do not think they have discipline, I also think that the person who they said it was the alrternative for advance exercises was terrible, coming out of her alignment, not having balance, etc, etc.
I am very upset that I bought this DVD, based on the good reviews many people gave it. I must say, many of those reviews were wrong. If you are into Pilates, yoga, barre and you used to be a dancer, you will laugh at this DVD...
I do not like the lack of coordination, I honestly  do not like anything about this DVD. Whoever compared this DVD to ""The Bar Method and ""Core Fusion"" (Fred & Elizabeth) are far from reality, and obviously haven't taken barre seriously.",1416700800,3,1053,4.345177664974619

I have an extensive library, and just wanted it for future use..my bad, should have checked it bout right away.. cannot wait to get replacement, because of the defect I gave 3 stars..I'm sure I'm going to love it once I get one that works!!!",1412726400,,366,4.397058823529412
4861035,3,B005R2RDEC,"This is a good workout, but I prefer a slower, more intentional barre workout. This felt a little too much like barre on speed.",1405123200,,127,4.333333333333333
4861036,1,B005R2RDEC,"others may love this workout-""to each there own""- as some would say--it just not what I wanted--but how do you know until you view the dvd--try it you may like it-- but its not for me",1401494400,,183,4.111111111111111
4861037,4,B005R2RDEC,"When I first started the dvd I thought that I did not care for the instructors and the set-up. I am very used to Stott Pilates and this dvd is very different. But what a pleasant surprise once I started the workout! Unlike the Stott Barre workouts, this is more cardio focused. I have read other reviews in which people complained that this dvd does not focus as much on proper form and sacrifices form over fast movements. I disagree. I really like that this workout focuses more on cardio than on slow controlled movements, because I already get that in my Stott dvds. I do believe that the instructors give enough tips on safety. There is a whole segment on safety and proper alignment and instead of talking a lot during the workout about proper form, they do this in the extra segment. They probably spend more time than other dvds on proper form, since they dedicated whole segment to it. When they get to the actual workout they don't repeat all the instructions from the proper form segment, which I think is great because they make you work right away instead of talking through the exercise for several minutes before they get started. This workout really gets you working start to finish with minimal talking in between sets.
The workouts are shown in three different levels, beginner, intermediate, and advanced. There are different segments to choose from so you can mix and match your workout or do them all:
1. Warm-up
2. Thigh work with mini stability ball and barre
3. Glutes and hamstrings with mini stability ball and barre
4. Legs with barre
5. Arms with weights
6. Abs on the mat with mini stability ball
7. Glutes on the mat with mini stability ball
8. Stretching on the mat
You will need a barre or chair, weights, mini stability ball, and mat. If you don't want to buy props, you can  do the exercises without the barre and use a chair, and hold onto something heavy instead of weights (some people use water bottles), but I really would invest in a mini stability ball.",1388880000,37,1994,4.569832402234637
4861038,4,B005R2RDEC,Great workout...it does ;make the muscles burn.  I highly recommend this workout CD...if you purchase it and do the exercises you will be happy with the overall results.  You can tell the workouts are working your muscles and toning.,1387152000,,233,4.948717948717949
4861039,1,B005R2RDEC,"After much 'research' I chose this, based on reviews.  I am very disappointed.  The music is repetitive (not motivating at all), and the instructors are very plastic with their leading.  The two different levels of the younger girls on either end are unbearable, with their fake smiles, and the workout is not very challenging (even the high level).  I will give this away to a friend that wants to try Barre, but fear that she would not get into it, so I might just invite her to the awesome class that I can only afford once a month.",1383523200,3,535,4.428571428571429
4861040,2,B005R2RDEC,"I have been doing barre exercise for about 3 yrs. The bar Method, The Dailey Method, Physique 57 and Core Fusion. I have also attended The Bar Method and Dailey Method classes when I travel since my home town does not offer it. Unfortunatly, this workout did not do it for me. I felt as though I was flailing my limbs, not very good core control and not a very good leg or glut burn. I did not care for the switching of instructors, one of who was overly energetic, it was a bit distracting. There ia nothing better than a good barr DVD that focuses more on the burn, core control and tight instruction than trying to make a big cardio statement. You can get a cardio workout without swinging your legs back and forth risking injury. Waisted my money here. I have Cathe Fredrick's Turbo barr to try next.",1380153600,5,804,4.33112582781457
4861041,3,B005R2RDEC,"it needs more instruction and safety measures on it, but it has challenging beginner workouts on it. Some of the things the advanced level does look really dangerous she was even shaking while trying to balance on her toes.",1380067200,,223,4.743589743589744
4861042,5,B005R2RDEC,"I am a college student dance major who let herself get out of shape over the summer. THIS PROGRAM IS AWESOME! It is absolutely killing me, in a good way. Many exercise programs are great for the general public, but don't really target the specific muscles that dancers need to keep strong for technical work, such as turnout muscles. This is a great substitute for the dance classes that keep me in shape during the year...actually, it may be even better.

There is a TON of glut work in this program and my rear end is both feeling it and showing it. The whole program focuses on abs as well, but it also includes an ab work section. The two women who lead it are encouraging and tough on you at the same time. I'm sure that this would be fantastic for dancers and non-dancers alike! BUY THIS DVD!",1376784000,13,798,4.355704697986577
4861043,5,B005R2RDEC,"I had also purchased a Cardiobarre DVD and looked into Physique 57 which is very expensive, and Burn at the Barre was mentioned so I sent for it.  You need a set of weights (I use 5 lb.) a chair, and a squishy ball and will your hamstrings burn the next day!  It is a challenging workout and there is a person doing beginner, one doing very advanced and one in between which is nice when you want to really challenge yourself and other times you know you can't do something - so you can modify as you go.  I noticed one review said it is similar to Physique 57, so as there are only so many barre exercises out there, I think these two DVDs will work great and will be all I need.  I am 59 years old and have been very impressed with how my legs have responded to these exercises - much leaner than with just doing weights and squats, etc.  It really targets that ""pear"" area that I have such a problem with!  It is challenging, but keep at it and you will feel yourself getting stronger and able to do the exercises with better form.  These are low impact also which I like and it is nice to strengthen my legs without always having to jump around or squat which is hard on my knees.",1375833600,5,1184,4.0995670995671
4861044,5,B005R2RDEC,This video is great. I love the attitude of the two instructors that are giving out instructions and encouragement. I would highly recommend this video.,1374192000,,152,5.12
4861045,4,B005R2RDEC,"I took Barre at a studio for several months and loved it but got too expensive. This workout is good, alot of the same moves but get to do at home. Using a chair to lean on can be uncomfortable, so I put a folded towel over the top. The women are super cheezy, feel like this was made in the 1980s. But if you do it right, you get a good workout. You'll need to incorporate other types of videos or you'll get bored. And form is key to getting the right burn.",1373414400,3,459,3.893617021276596
4861046,5,B005R2RDEC,This workout will challenge you!! It did me & I've been doing this type of workout for several years. Love the levels they offer & I do agree with other reviews I find the skimpy outfit out of place with the rest of this high quality production.,1372118400,,245,4.23404255319149

4861048,5,B005R2RDEC,"This one hour workout has changed my body. I never liked my slim non shapely legs, but now they have well defined muscles from my butt down to my calves. My stomach is rock hard and my arms are sexy and strong. What i like best is there are three girls doing the workout. You can follow the one that is more comfortable for you- beginner, intermediate, or very hard! I worked up to imtermediate. This dvd works you hard but stick with it. I feel amazing. I do it 2 to 3 times a week. It is fantastic, I recommend it to anyone that wants to feel strong and slim down.",1368921600,7,566,4.0625

4861050,5,B005R2RDEC,"I have used exercise videos most of all my life. I found certain ones too unbelievably difficult with the instructors all over the place. Some others just too boring. Engaging an audio visual audience is an art. These women have done an awesome job in all points in my opinion. I have been working out to this Video for 4 months and have see big changes in my body!
As a Christmas gift I received a ballet bar.. Pure awesomeness! Thanks! Can't wait for this next one!",1359763200,8,467,4.379310344827586

4861052,5,B005R2RDEC,I did not think I was going to like this DVD but it's the best of their productions because it gives moderations for all levels. The cuing is great. The toning is just enough to get a burn but not overkill.  I love it. I recommend this DVD to all people who love all things Barre. Excellent.,1354924800,5,291,4.105263157894737
4861053,5,B005R2RDEC,Very effective workout. Good choice. Already work out at my club in a barre class; this is a great sub for days when I can't get to class.,1353801600,,138,3.9642857142857144
4861054,1,B005R2RDEC,"This is a very basic video with not a single exercise that I haven't done before. If u are a complete beginner this might work for u as an easy introduction to the barre, but if you have done it before get a different one...
The ladies in the video do have 3 different levels which is great, but the exercises are so basic that it almost makes no difference from intermediate level to advance except for the level of flexibility..
Another thing I didn't like is the instructions of both of the ladies, sounded a bit annoying repeating ""good"" between every other word and not natural.
I wish I read the reviews before i bought it..",1351641600,8,630,4.3931623931623935
4861055,4,B005R2RDEC,"I like that this workout is lead by doctors (at least one of them is, not sure about the other) and give superb instruction on form.  I live by Pilates and power walking and this is a wonderful addition to elongate the muscles.  It looks like there is only ONE left so you should buy it....really!",1342483200,4,297,4.285714285714286
4861056,5,B005R2RDEC,"I purchased this video 6 months ago and have been doing the DVD 3x/wk ever since. My body has completely changed! I now have lean, toned arms, abs and my calves and thighs have never looked thinner and more toned..even after years of working out. I have tried many Barre routines and I can say that this workout is the safest Barre workout out there (in terms of keeping your spine and knees out of incorrect positions). I cringe when I watch other Barre DVDs...they must not have been developed by people who know their anatomy. You will love this DVD! You will burn but the results are so worth it! Many people have noticed the change in my body as they say I look smaller but my weight is the same...yes because muscle weighs more than fat! But don't worry ladies, you won't get that bulky look like some workouts! You will look longer and leaner. Thank you Burn at the Barre!",1341100800,65,879,4.398773006134969
4861057,4,B005R2RDEC,"I like this DVD!  The instruction is good.  The moves are not innovative, mostly ones that I've done before with Tracey Mallett and Physique 57.  But they are presented in a different manner so it makes for a different experience.  I do like that this is a total body workout, including all major muscle groups.

A few picky things:
There are 4 exercisers; one performing beginner, two that are the presenters and they trade off performing intermediate, and one that is advanced.  Three of the girls are similarly dressed, sleeveless exercise tops and cropped yoga pants.  Then Ashley, the advanced exerciser, is as scantily clad as she can be and still be considered ""dressed"".  I'm not being a prude, and have many DVDs with instructors in various degrees of dress. I think that it is an odd choice to make her stand out so much.  I appreciate being able to see that this exercise routine is worth the effort, but I could still see that she has a nice body if she had on the same clothes as the other girls.

The last issue is the instructor Andromeda.  Whenever she tells you to do a tough move, she says ""I know, I know"".  And this is repeated throughout the session.  I guess it is her way of being empathetic with you, but it turns out being annoying.  She must be used to teaching live classes, where this would be more appropriate.  Otherwise, both instructors are very good.

Try this workout, if you are into the ""barre"" it is a good option.",1340841600,35,1451,4.501915708812261
8484058,5,B005R2RDEC,"The closest thing to being in a barre workout class at the gym.  The workout is a generous 50 minutes, not counting the warm-up and stretching. Movements will build strength and endurance and also get your heart rate up. Just pop in the DVD and play it continuously.  No stopping to go back to the main menu for several different workouts like some other DVDs.  Love it!",1526083200,,370,4.492537313432836

8484062,5,B005R2RDEC,"This is a great workout. Barre workouts generally bore me to tears so I don't do them but this one is fast-paced and interesting. I'm an advanced exerciser but definitely not for this one! It really got me and I definitely have room to grow. I didn't feel like I was over-working at the time and for a few of the exercises I thought ""could use more reps"", even though I had to stay at the beginner/intermediate level, but I sure felt it for a couple days afterwards.

I really like how they don't do a lot of reps for each exercise but change the style (even if it's only a slight variation) to keep it interesting.  Plus all three girls do each exercise differently depending on your level: beginner, intermediate, or advanced.

8484067,5,B005R2RDEC,"OMG what a workout and I love it. It's 60 minutes long.
I love that it included cardio in the workout, that way I don't have to go and do cardio on my own.
Not only did it remind me of Physique 57 it also reminded me of Cardio Barre.
It works the hell out of your legs, butt, thighs, calves, abs and arms; which I loved b/c a lot of barre workouts do minimal arms and this one had my arms burning.
(Element Ballet Conditioning does work the hell out of your arms too, just buy having you raise your arms.)
I love that they give you 3 levels so you decide which is best for you and you actually see all 3 instructors doing beginners, intermediate and
advanced.
They do tend to move from exercise to another and really don't give much instruction like: have your hips squared, back straight as if you
are against an imaginary wall, So this is if you are familiar with barre workouts and know how to properly do the exercises.
Susan Bowen's BarreAmped workouts are phenomenal for doing barre properly.
I also have the beginners and now am going to order their Burn at the Barre Advanced, which is 30 minutes b/c I loved this one.",1432425600,,1126,4.266355140186916
