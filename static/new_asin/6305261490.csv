The slow start was expected based on other reviews. But after it gets going, there are a few laugh moments, and an interesting story develops. As is expected, the ending is very much like the beginning. (No closure. Just life the way it is for some, or many.)",1473984000,2,402,4.373333333333333

1006628,5,6305261490,"Being and nothingness at the Trees Lounge means being served a cold beer when the older bottle runs dry.

Steve Buscemi's movie classic reflects heavily on current philosophical ideas: mainly existentialism. Personally, I first saw Trees Lounge in 1996  at an art house in Malverne not too far from where Buscemi grew up in Valley Stream Long Island. Sometimes the burbs does feel like a burp, a relief of internal commotion, yet this movie is more of a realistic eye opener than the release of internal energy.

As far as story telling, this movie is poignant. Buscemi who wrote, directed, and starred in Trees Lounge. tells the story of a middle-class suburban young man who attempts to get his life in order before it runs out. The young man, Tommy, takes over his uncle's ice cream neighborhood trunk after his uncle, Al, dies from a fatal heart attack while driving his truck on a quiet, suburban neighborhood. Even though this movie is dead serious, it also has comic moments: a young child with money in hand is constantly ignored by Tommy who isn't paying attention and drives right pass him.

In the eyes of some, Tommy might be considered a loser, a never do well. In the eyes of others, Tommy has lived a real, normal life filled with misfortunes and heart breaks. He's just whiling away the time, until his number is called and his ticket on life is punched out. Like the ideas of Satre and Camus, it's all about the idea of here and now then the passage into the existential world of nothingness called so by the famous existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. Yet before he final moment happens Tommy spends plenty of his time in the neighborhood pub called Trees Lounge. There he chats with Mike, a regular there, along with other customers. It's there people hang out and bond. As far as cinema, this one has a European flair done by an American. Without a doubt, this movie evokes profound thoughts and reflections. If someone hangs out in a bar all the time, is that person a loser? Not in my eyes, it is subjective. For me that person who always hang out in bars, I believe, is someone who is thirsty. There are a million and one stories to tell about hanging out in a bar. I remember once at two in the morning, a burping contest broke out when those drinking started to burp melodiously like a chorus. Thus is life is the burbs, sometimes it's a burp fest. other times, it's quite a bore fest.

When I first saw, Trees Lounge, it was filmed in standard definition. This movie is in high definition. Oh, how the times have changed. The fact, though, that's in HD made it more enjoyable to watch. When I first saw it in SD twenty years ago, the movie had less impact. Regardless, the bottom line is this movie is well-crafted, brilliant, and most of all, an artistic gem. It's nice to know that someone well known behind the camera has something to say in a humble tone without bright lights. Even if that something to say is nothing. The meaningless of life for some, if not many.

As far as knowing his surrounding, Buscemi is well verse in life in both the burb and in the city. He knows young adults want to get out of the burb to live in the more exciting city. After all, the burb could be quite humdrum. And the city offers the antidote, with excitement and opportunity, all existentially speaking.

This movie makes me think, it is well serving for those who spent four years in college, studying an abstract liberal arts curriculum, then find themselves endlessly hitting the pavement, not getting good job offers, only a thank you for showing up. The next stop after a futile job search, why, of course, the Trees Lounge.",1473206400,4,3654,4.569465648854962

The cliche is always a character whose life suddenly plunges into melodramatic chaos immediately follower by a 12 step program or a cathartic improvement.  In real life, alcoholics sometimes meander through a long successive chain of minor failures and continue going to the same seedy bars every day until they die or get too sick to walk.  Along the way, various colorful characters feel disgust, empathy, anger, amusement, or even a sincere desire to help.  This is a good example of why Steve Buscemi is a star.

1006907,4,6305261490,"This effort by Steve Buscemi, as both writer and director, seems so natural and effortless, it's a surprise he hasn't done it more.

Here's the scoop. Tommy (Buscemi) hangs out at the Trees Lounge. He's an unemployed mechanic. His long time girlfriend is married to his ex-boss. She's pregnant and the baby might be his. He can't find a job, drinks more than he should and is trying, in general, to return to some degree of normalcy. The problem is, he keeps getting in his way.

This is a nifty little flick. One of the coolest things is the cast. I don't know how much Bescemi had in the choosing but seeing a pre-fame Chloe Sevigny, Kevin Corrigan, Michael Imperioli, among others is a real hoot. The story is good. Tommy isn't a bad guy. He's just a screw up, and a selfish one at that. He would be in fine shape if he thought about the possible conseqences of his actions. Face it. Who ""borrows"" $1,500.00 from his boss figuring he would return it after winning on a weekend binge in Atlantic City? Seriously?! And yes. When you keep a 17 year old girl out all night, chances are her dad is going to get ticked. He does some really stupid stuff.

This is well acted and deftly directed. It sports some nifty 70s tunes and has a nice flow. It's very slice of life in that the viewer gets a snapshot of all the characters involved. As a result, there is really no story arc and not really a character arc either. You do see Tommy taking a long, hard look at what's going on around him during the final scene, but that's about it.

Buscemi is in top form here. I like his acting and he's written this for himself. So, if your a fan of his, indulge yourself in this.",1380240000,,1667,4.2993630573248405

After seeing trees Lounge you will also appreciate it's signature dialogue, ""Korea"", which takes place between Buchemi and a hard of hearing veteran. Cracked me up.

 Anyone who frequents a local bar or VFW will appreciate this film. you'll find someone you know in the bar scenes, perhaps yourself. For avid Indie fans it is a must for your collection. My Bohemian friends will be joining me for a Trees Lounge theme party. We wear our thrift store finds,eat bar food and drink beer while we watch the film.

1006942,5,6305261490,"Trees Lounge  (1996)  Steve Buscemi, Chloe Sevigny. Mimi Rogers
Rated R
Thees Lounge is the name of a non-descript  and depressing dive bar in Long Island. Steve Buscemi  wrote, directed and stars in this low budget, heartfelt Indie. He smokes too much, he drinks too much, he can't hold a job and his life is falling apart around him because of his irresponsible alcoholism. He finds himself relegated to driving his dead uncle's ice cream truck in his neighborhood as everything goes downhill in his life.
He gets into a mistaken relationship with Chloe Sevigny, his niece, who is a truly remarkable actress in her own right since she can say SO MUCH with her eyes and her voice. She's irresistible in her flirty role as Debbie.
This is a slice of life character study with many profound themes. It's not shallow entertainment by any stretch. There's much more here than meets the eye.
If you've ever experienced hazy, weary, self-destructive honky tonk loneliness in the barfly tradition, you will relate.
This is an under the radar independent movie, my favorite kind.
A dark, comedic and realistic film about a man who's life is slipping away right in front of him and he's too afraid to discover why.",1361145600,,1206,4.783653846153846
1006943,4,6305261490,"Steve Buscemi may have appeared in some Bruckheimer blockbusters but his heart is pure indie.  ""Ghost World"" and the Coen Brothers is where his true iconoclastic spirit lies.  It should come as no surprise that he chose this slice-of-life serio-comedy for his directorial debut.  It should also be no surprise that the film is rich in characterization.  The story, however, is a little on the thin side.  No matter because Buscemi adds another trophy in his gallery of rogues and losers with his Tommy.  When Tommy isn't drinking he's stalking his ex-girlfriend who may or may not be carrying his kid.  The assumed father is Tommy's former boss who Tommy stole $1,500.00 from and gambled it away in Atlantic City.  To make Tommy more savory he carries on an illicit friendship with the niece of the ex-girlfriend.  Only an actor of Buscemi's calibre could make such a loser somewhat empathetic.  It's a fascinating character study trapped in a film that falls short of its intentions.  These flicks dealing with life's underbelly are indie cliche.  I swear I've seen this movie before but I can't put my finger on it.  Regardless, it contains more intrigue than ""Armageddon"" so I'm giving it the pass.",1340928000,6,1201,4.8861386138613865
1006944,5,6305261490,"Drinking as a desperate attempt to overcome personal problems is quite a common theme in films. Since the 80s some films portray the drinker as an outcast, living almost alone in the universe (e.g. Barfly, Leaving Las Vegas). Their drinkers are existentialist alienated savants who cannot stand pretensions and conventions. They leave everything worldly (apart from alcohol) behind and end up somewhere so they can just drink themselves to death (Leaving Las Vegas again).

Trees Lounge belongs in this tradition but with a major difference. This drinker, Tommy (Buscemi), is not alone, away from home, floating in space. He is firmly rooted on home ground. Tommy knows everybody around, since ever, and everybody knows him; he is surrounded by relatives, friends, ex-girlfriends, etc. The fact that Tommy is at his home town unfolds slowly (especially more so to a viewer not from the US). Buscemi's major achievement in directing this film is the way he deals with this, the story's central point: in a gradual, slow, painful and occasionally funny revelation.

So, if one thinks that you end up alcoholic because you lose contact with a wider community the film shows someone ending up drunk despite being in community; can one speculate that it is because of this fact? The film doesn't apportion blame. We are never told why Tommy has ended up as a permanent resident of Trees Lounge. Was it the community? Was it the fun? Was it a character failing? But, for sure, if Trees Lounge is not a safe haven, neither is the community.

I saw this film on the big screen when it came out and it was a superb and memorable experience. Recently I watched it again from a Region 1 DVD. As others have mentioned, this DVD is not a very satisfying offering; nothing like watching the film on the big screen. However, as by now the likelihood to come across the film in a cinema is low, you should definitely try the DVD; but one hopes that the production company will come up eventually with a better package.",1328659200,2,2002,4.780346820809249
1006945,4,6305261490,"Steve Buscemi is right on target with his character in Trees Lounge. Playing a young but probably past-his-prime local, he hits all the right notes about a character who never quite makes it. Drifting through his home town like a lost soul, he is someone we all know, someone we all have seen, especially if we are from the northeast and grew up in a small ethnic community. Movies like this get little attention from the Oscars but contain exceptional performances. The cast surrounding Buscemi is also very good.  There was another little known movie called Last Night At The Alamo which was released in 1984 that has a similar theme. Also well acted and right on target. Fans of the Sopranos will probably love this film also. This movie is well worth the small investment. Enjoy.",1305417600,2,783,4.7153284671532845
1006946,4,6305261490,"Trees Lounge is hard to describe because it doesn't really stick to one specific genre.  The reason it doesn't stick to one specific genre is because it doesn't really do much of *anything*.  Plot development?  Yeah... if you wanna call it that.

It's about Steve Buscemi playing the role of a guy who basically has no life, no ambition, no desire to succeed, etc.  He spends his days in the bar hitting on women, occasionally working on his cars or driving around in an ice cream truck, or getting into trouble with the fellows around town.

Perhaps I'm so quick to forgive the storyline because it takes place in a small town making it very simple and relatable, and I simply love these kind of films.

The humor is only sometimes funny, but the actual storyline is the reason Trees Lounge isn't getting a 5 star rating out of me.  Steve's character could certainly have been more interesting instead of being a lazy bum who has constant trouble scoring with the ladies.

Spending all day getting to know numerous women around town isn't really appealing, and it eventually gets Steve in trouble (the best part of the movie, might I add).

Overall, be cautious with this one.  You might find it boring if you believe character and plot development are crucial components required to make a movie watchable.",1297814400,2,1308,4.692982456140351

I think Tommy is a great chracter, so seeing how he ended up by the end of the film is, unsettleing I guess. I really wanted something good to happen to him. I'm used to unhappy endings, Edward Scissorhands is one of my favorite movies, but this one just broke my heart. In a weird way, Tommy reminds me of myself. I'm not an alcoholic, but I live in a town that people rarly escape from. So Tommy's confession to Theresa about being lost, hits home a little.
Other than being unable to watch the film, the film was overall very good, full of interesting characters, the actors were good, and despite making me sad, it also had some funny parts.",1270339200,3,782,4.326530612244898
1006948,4,6305261490,"The title of this finely humble film, Trees Lounge, is the name of a New Jersey bar that acts as thirty something Tommy Basilio's (Steve Buscemi) second home throughout it`s running time. We initially find him hung-over, waking up in the Trees fifteen minutes after last call, demanding a shot of Wild Turkey. Tommy has just been fired, broken up with his pregnant girlfriend of eight years whose now involved with his once friend and former boss Rob (Anthony LaPaglia). Despite unable to keep his own car running, Tommy mooches around town looking for work as a mechanic, but spends most of his time getting drunk at the Trees making strained if appropriate acquaintances with some of the locals. Namely one Mike (Mark Boone Junior), who himself has his own domestic issues but has chosen to spend his ""vacation"" coming to the Trees everyday.

One thing becomes clear to all around Tommy - including his family, that he is a bit of a sad sack loser. A leech that expects everything but is unwilling to do the work required for a person to change their life situation. Unable to really get over his previous relationship or find work, he ends up taking over his recently deceased Uncle's Ice-Cream truck, causing more trouble than it's worth involving the seventeen-year-old niece of his former girlfriend.

Made in 1996, Trees Lounge reminds you of what a real independent film feels like. In recent years, the line seems to have become blurred in the mainstream as too who or what exactly constitutes such a thing. However, this film is the debut work of a true artist in writer/director/star Buscemi. Made for less than two million dollars, the film's confronting reality of the almost pointlessness of life at times, alongside an ensemble of great performances from the likes of Junior, Chloe Sevigny, Elizabeth Bracco and Daniel Baldwin give the film a real spirit and ironic humour.

Buscemi himself, as the central Tommy, plays out a meditation in all things loserdom excellently. Bad choices, selfishness, alienation, you name it; Tommy justifies such a label to himself and to all around him. Coupled with all that happens up until the poignant, almost depressing ending, it is difficult to sympathise with or for him. Not that Buscemi as writer/director expects or even wants us too. The laidback, but hardly laconic script slowly draws out circumstance in a very observatory way avoiding influencing the audience too much about how we should feel about these people. We can only gauge their actions, not really react.

The lesson here must be then that life is what you make it - and sitting around in a dive bar all day will not help your cause. Tommy, and many like him, are destructive people to all who are close, never fully realising until it is too late. In short, and incorporating a great soundtrack to boot, Trees Lounge is a deeply humorous, albeit bleak slice of life that, if you let it, can help put your own into perspective too.",1245888000,,2955,4.822485207100592
1006949,5,6305261490,"Tommy (the amazing Steve Buscemi) is an alcoholic, perhaps not ready to admit it to himself.  He lives in a tiny apartment over a local dive named Tree's Lounge.  Tommy shows up everyday and knows all the regulars, specifically an old man named Bill who sits in his favorite seat all day, and an elderly couple who come in to gossip and play cards.  Tommy has recently lost his job as a mechanic for ""borrowing"" money from the business for gambling reasons.  He's bothering those who still work in the shop by hanging across the street, including ex-friend Rob who is now with Tommy's ex-girlfriend Teresa who's quite pregnant.  It's never sure if the baby is Rob's or Tommy's.

Then appears a new guy in the bar, Mike.  He hangs out and drinks as regularly as the rest, but it turns out Mike has a family, wife and daughter, and a rather nice Moving Business that he runs from his barstool.  Mike and Tommy become friends, which doesn't stop Tommy from hitting Mike up for a job.  He's been cruising for mechanic work (while unable to keep his own car running) and finally takes a job running Uncle Al's Ice Cream Truck after Uncle Al suffers an unexpected and fatal heart attack.

Debbie ""Deb"" (Played by Chloe Sevigny - Kids), related to Tommy though his past relationship with Teresa, helps Tommy run the truck, and though she's only seventeen they form a bond.  Jerry (Daniel Baldwin) and Patti (Mimi Rogers) are Deb's parents and still treat Tommy like family.  This puts his relationship with Deb, especially after it spins out of control, on the dark edge of friendship with what little family he has left.  Tommy is a disappointment with everyone, even Connie the bartender at Trees Lounge (played perfectly by Carol Kane) and he can't afford to loose family from wherever it comes from

The most poignant scene in the film is Tommy sitting in Bill's regular chair after Bill has been taken to the hospital (and no one has gone to see him, not even his ""bar"" family), and you can see the look on Tommy's face wondering if he is becoming the next ""Bill"" in the bar.

This film was written, directed by, and starring Steve Buscemi, one of my favorite actors.  The movie shows his talent doesn't lay in just acting alone.  It's a great story and beautifully directed.  The role of Tommy was (of course) written for Buscemi and he plays it to perfection.  You can clearly see Tommy's playful side, and why he's liked so much by his friends.  The film is surprisingly visual, capturing the way people look and act when they're under the influence or simply not taking care of themselves.  My only problem with the rental DVD I watched is that there were no subtitles for hard of hearing, and no extras on the DVD.  I bought it anyway, hoping for extras and possibly an interview with Steve Buscemi on the triple role he played in this movie.  I highly recommend this movie.

Okay, so it's not that bad, but it is like hanging out in your garage on a Saturday afternoon, watching your great uncle throw back cold ones while he drones on about politics and the state of the economy. It's not entirely horrible, but you know you could be doing something better with your time.

I tried to like Trees Lounge, which deals with a man who owns a bar and drives an ice cream truck around town doing his best now to be seduced by a local teenaged female, but I just couldn't. Be warned. This is not your older brother's independent film. It's Steve Buscemi with too much power and too little wit.",1212019200,2,889,4.414634146341464

I loved it when I saw it a decade ago and my opinion has not changed in the time since. I rented it the other day and was as pleased as I was the first time around. Buscemi's virgin directorial effort could not have been more resonant. He portrays Tommy as both a hero and an anti-hero. The plot itself takes us to quite familiar places as there isn't anything too ""Hollywood"" about this production. It is not happy, but its realism offers great value. Trees Lounge has the type of feel that Ed Burns has tried to create continuously over his career, but was only able to do so in Brothers McMullen.

This is a slice of life type movie, filled with colorful but not 'pre-meditated' characters. I always got the feeling I was watching these people, not the actors playing them. This film derives much of it's humor from the problems that can plague any of us, from drug and alcohol problems to losing someone you loved to a best friend. There is lots to laugh at here, but has a nice dramatic side when needed.

The film is depressing, and therefore I'd recommend everyone watch it, especially those who were born into their own perfect little worlds and became what they are because of their parents' money.

1006978,5,6305261490,"Boy, am I glad I took the time to watch this movie! I suspect ""Trees Lounge,"" a low budget 1996 film directed, written, and starred in by veteran character actor Steve Buscemi, slipped under a lot of people's radar. What a shame. This film ranks as one of the best dramas I have seen in quite some time. Most people would probably recognize Buscemi from his many appearances in films ranging from the Adam Sandler vehicle ""Billy Madison"" to the dark comedy ""Ed and His Dead Mother."" Well, Steve isn't putting on lipstick in this intense dark comedy about a New York loser and his relationships with like-minded souls living out their miserable existences at a neighborhood bar named Trees Lounge. I will never look at Steve Buscemi the same way after viewing this picture, and why this talented individual isn't getting more attention is beyond me. ""Trees Lounge"" is that good.
Buscemi plays Tommy, a poor soul whose life spirals out of control day after day. He lost his job after taking some liberties with his employer's safe, lost his girlfriend to that same boss, cannot stop drinking to save his life, isn't above using drugs, and entangles himself in a relationship with the seventeen year old daughter of his former girlfriend's sister. Even worse, Tommy can't seem to land another job as a mechanic because his former employer badmouths him whenever someone calls for a reference. Tommy ultimately breaks down and takes a job as the driver of an ice cream truck, a position that causes more problems than solutions. He can't even pick up a girl at the bar without something bad happening. In a country where millions of people barely keep their heads above water, Tommy serves as an archetype of the lost soul. Arguably, his biggest problem stems from the fact that he blames everyone else for his own problems. Even when he approaches his former girlfriend with the intent to change for the better, he cannot do so without stating that he needs an external object to bring about that change (in this case, a child). In short, Tommy is afraid to look deep into his soul because he won't like what he will find there. Part of Tommy's problem rests on the fact that he lives above the bar, along with a few other losers like Billy, an old coot whose life melts away one drink at a time. By the end of the film, the viewer wonders whether Tommy will replace Billy at the bar and in life.
""Trees Lounge"" does display comedic elements from time to time, giving rise to a situation where you laugh at scenes you know you shouldn't be chortling over. For example, there is the scene where the daytime bartender at Trees Lounge bets Tommy ten dollars that he cannot walk out of the bar without taking a drink. Tommy sneers at such a ridiculous proposition, wisecracking his way around the issue until finally forced to take the bet. He starts to walk away with the money, quickly reaches for his drink, downs it, and runs out of the bar. While the scene brings a smile to your face, you know at the same time that you are watching a man with a serious alcohol problem who probably isn't going to seek help anytime soon. I found the disheveled drunk who can't seem to keep his family together but who owns a moving company and a fancy house amusing, although it is an amusement tempered with a sense of sorrow for his inability to communicate with his own family. ""Trees Lounge"" plays your emotions like a master violinist handling a priceless instrument.
The supporting cast floating in and out of ""Trees Lounge"" staggers the mind. Chloe Sevigny, Debi Mazar, Daniel Baldwin, Mimi Rogers, Carol Kane, Samuel L. Jackson, and Anthony LaPaglia all appear in roles both major and minor. Buscemi must have called in a bunch of favors for his film, and the recognizable faces definitely provide the otherwise dreary atmosphere of Tommy's life with a little glitter. Sevigny especially shines as the flirty yet wise Debbie, the teenage girl who accompanies Tommy on his ice cream rounds and who helps bring down a whole lot of trouble for him.
The DVD version promises a commentary by Steve Buscemi and a music video by one of the soundtrack groups, but the version I watched included none of these extras. That is unfortunate, too, because I would really like to hear what Buscemi says about this spectacular effort. Ultimately, ""Trees Lounge"" offers no definitive conclusions about Tommy's life, no concrete resolutions about where he will end up. In this way, the film mirrors real life where we cannot arrive at certainties from mere snapshots of a specific time in a person's existence. Who knows? Maybe Tommy will snap out of his malaise and finally live his life to the fullest, or maybe his doom sits right around the corner. Whatever the result, the fascinating ""Trees Lounge"" sits on a video store shelf near you awaiting your attentions. Run, don't walk, to see this film.",1066003200,58,4876,4.697429906542056
1006979,4,6305261490,"Steve Buscemi is one of our absolute finest character actors, but in Trees Lounge he gets a chance to direct himself in a starring role.  The result is an excellent movie that doesn't seem to have gotten the attention it deserves.
Buscemi's character is a loser: he's been fired from his job as a mechanic, his long-time girlfriend left him for his best friend, and he spends much of his time as a regular at the local bar, the Trees Lounge.  A loser, to be sure, but also a basically decent guy.  A funny guy with a quick wit, living in a dead-end, blue-collar Long Island suburb, surrounded by friends and relatives with little vision beyond their dead-end lives.
We watch as this loser tries to do the right thing, but just can't get it right.  At one point, he apparently succumbs to a certain temptation, but when confronted about it, he insists that ""nothing happened!"".  We believe him, we even feel sorry for him, but we also recognize the inveitability of the outcome, for he has squandered whatever goodwill he still had coming to him.
The final scene is haunting in the way it echoes the opening scene.  Sometimes funny, usually bittersweet, Trees Lounge is a very good character study.  As a portrayal of alcoholism, it also makes a fine, understated companion piece to Barfly, its more famous, self-conscious, and, in my opinion, inferior predecessor.",1056153600,6,1364,4.754237288135593

David Chase has said that when it came time to cast the Sopranos, he had been so impressed by ""Trees Lounge"" that he went ahead and got the same two casting directors who had worked on this film.
The film is a consummate example of dark humor.  You watch this character screw up his life, in slow motion.  Persistently and consistently.  Given that life is ugly, and that some people do choose to squander it, I found the way this film unfolds to be darkly humorous and in fact to be the funniest film I saw in 1996.  Buscemi has not acquired an especially strong reputation from this film, but I find this to be masterfully done.

1007018,5,6305261490,"There are few roles Steve can pick up that he can't enhance.  In bit parts, as in Floundering or Wedding Singer, or when in the driver's seat as in Fargo and Living in Oblivion, the man has the presence of a decimal point in a twenty digit equation: He's the smallest entity there, both physically and supposedly in importance.  But the man, like the dot, carries the sum.  No other actor short of Dustin Hoffman has this kind of charisma in such an, at first glance, unprepossessing package.  Like Dusty, Steve is amazing.
But he's typecast, isn't he: He's good looking for an oddball, and he's got impeccable comic timing and the sort of fey delivery most stand up comics would kill for.  Hmm, let's make him a pitiful comic foil to every virile, obnoxious hero out there.  That, it seems to me, is what Hollywood does with idiosyncratic talent: Gives it a donut, and tells it to act weird.
So: He picked up one more cinematic onus, and became both director and star, with sensational results.  Buscemi's performance is one factor in the success, the supporting cast holds a sizable portion of the credit, the plotline is taut as a cliff diver's nerves.  It's an unique concept: A comic foil new to the director's chair, upstaging the men who threw him pell-mell into Armaegeddon by simply making a GOOD MOVIE.
Credibility makes the difference.  Every character in this opus is vibrant: Chloe Sevigny's Debbie has a youthful, homely-beautiful role in the deterioration of the man we're looking for: One Tommy Basilio, a grimy mechanic around whom every other character orbits, from the knot-on-the-stool Mike (Mark Boone Jr.) to whom Old Crow takes priority over wife and kids, to Carol Kane's smart aleck bar keep.  Kevin Corrigan is typically remarkable in a bit part as Matthew, son of Uncle Al as played by Symour Cassel (remember Rushmore?  Another favorite.)  He and Steve saw action together in the hapless-film-makers flick L.I.O. Anthony LaPaglia is staid as Rob, who robbed with Tommy's woman.  (Sidenote: He also stole Blanche from Mr. Penn in Sweet and Lowdown-Friggin' thief!)  The movie is tight and orderly, a by-the-book but still intriguing look at substance abuse and every ramification of all those shots and cocaine breaks.  And whomever culled together that soundtrack deserves a scholarship to Julliard on the grounds of taste alone-Ink Spots, Bachman Turner Overdrive (not so crazy for that one, but...).  And Hayden!  Hayden, I say!
This is an example of what I like to see: Ingenious, energetic indie film-making.  Every time I see a movie like Trees Lounge, Palookaville, Buffalo '66, Living in Oblivion, et al, I feel refreshed with the knowledge that cinema, like literature, never dies: It simply goes into periodic comas, and emerges even stronger and more unflappable than before.
So, whomever funded Armaegeddon: Leave.  Buy a Rolling Stone and keep dreaming of Alexander Hamilton and Oscar nominations.  For the men or women responsible for movies like this: Were I Pope, you'd all be canonized.",1027036800,3,3030,4.962376237623762

And whether or not a particular project is a hit or a flop, Buscemi is always good, and can always be counted upon to add that extra something to any given film, as he has in ""Trees Lounge,"" an affecting drama he not only stars in, but with which he makes his debut as a writer/director-- and an impressive debut it is.
 Tommy Basilio (Buscemi) is an out-of-work mechanic who lives alone above a bar called Trees Lounge in Long Island, N.Y.  He's more than a bit down on his luck; not only did he lose his job, but his pregnant girlfriend of eight years, Theresa (Elizabeth Bracco) recently dumped him for his former boss, Rob (Anthony LaPaglia).  He wants to pick himself up and get his life back together, but he doesn't seem to know where to start, and the garages to which he's applied for work aren't exactly knocking his door down to hire him.  So he gravitates to the Trees, where he can at least interact with others who seem to be in situations not entirely unlike his own, though at different stages and for different reasons.  But they all have one thing in common-- they're people just trying to get through the day; they're trying to get through life.  If they can only figure it all out.
 With this film, Buscemi proves that he is more than just a talented actor, but rather a true artist in every sense of the word, with his chosen medium being film.  He has an eye for detail which complements his insights into human nature and enables him to effectively translate his material to the screen.  His characters are finely drawn and complex, and with each and every one he manages to successfully avoid the stereotypes to which a setting like this could easily lend itself (and no doubt would, in lesser hands).  Even with the minor characters, he succinctly gives you enough of who they are that it allows you to see beneath the surface and know what makes them tick.  And he does it imaginatively-- by filling a room with photographs or items that reflect who a certain person is, for example, or simply by training his camera on someone's face and allowing that extra beat that affords the viewer a telling glimpse of what's hiding behind a character's eyes.  Buscemi has an innate sense of knowing how to convey what he's trying to say, and he does it in a million small and different ways that are subtle and incisive.  Simply put, he knows what works-- including how to get what he wants out of his actors-- and he presents it all with a pace and timing that are right on the mark.
 In Tommy, Buscemi creates a character to whom many will be able to relate and identify on any number of different levels.  To say that Tommy is a ""loser"" would be too much of a simplification, because the character is too complex for that tag alone to be accurate.  Tommy is blue-collar, down on his luck, and like so many people in real life, just can't seem to put it all together, can't figure out how ""life"" is supposed to work.  And that's what Buscemi conveys so subtly and so well, and it's the key to the success of this character-- it's what makes Tommy believable and real.  Obviously, Buscemi knew exactly what he wanted when he wrote this character, and he puts it across with a brilliant, memorable performance which also demonstrates his ability to star in and carry a movie on his own.  Certainly, he has a wonderful supporting cast that gives him plenty of help, but few character actors have ever been able to step into a lead role with such facility and achieve the level of success Buscemi has here.  And it's work that deserves to be acknowledged.
 There are a number of notable supporting performances in this film, as well, beginning with Mark Boone Junior, who as Mike captures the essence of a guy who is successful, but a loser nonetheless; LaPaglia, who gives a solid performance as Rob; Bracco, with a performance that is introspectively revealing; Debi Mazar, who with very little screen time leaves an indelible impression (and her eyes are absolutely mesmerizing); Kevin Corrigan (another of the finest character actors around), as Matthew; and especially Chloe Sevigny, as Debbie, Theresa's mature-beyond-her-years, seventeen-year-old niece.
 Rounding out the ensemble cast are Carol Kane (Connie), Bronson Dudley (Bill), Michael Buscemi (Steve's real life brother, playing Tommy's brother, Raymond), Suzanne Shepherd (Jackie), Rockets Redglare (Stan), Seymour Cassel (Uncle Al), Annette Arnold (Sandy), Michael Imperioli (George), Mimi Rogers (Patty), Daniel Baldwin (Jerry) and Charles Newmark (Puck).  An involving story presented with a rich assortment of memorable, convincing characters, ""Trees Lounge"" is a drama about life-- about the things going on in your own neighborhood, or downtown or two streets over, no matter where you are in the world.  Wherever people are, there are situations like the ones depicted in this film, problems that have to be solved and life that has to be lived.  And that's what makes this film so good; it gives the audience a chance to connect with, or at least examine, things that anyone anywhere will be able to recognize.  It may have taken a collaborative effort to make this one what it is, but in the end, it's Buscemi's film from start to finish, and a satisfying little gem of a movie it is.  And that's the magic of the movies.",1019174400,16,5589,4.71047227926078
1007020,5,6305261490,"With an unlikely background of a dingy neighborhood bar, Steve Buscemi has produced an enlightening story about the spiritual growth of a man named Tommy (Steve Buscemi) who is burdened with what author John Bradshaw has termed ""toxic shame"". The audience quickly learns that Tommy is an alcoholic. As the film progresses, the audience also learns that he will do or say anything to avoid taking personal responsibility for himself and his life.
The movie takes the audience through Tommy's healing crisis. When the movie begins, we find out that Tommy has recently lost his job as an automobile mechanic and his girlfriend (who is now pregnant with what may or may not be Tommy's baby). Instead of looking inside himself for the source of his problems, Tommy has fingered Rob, his former boss and his girlfriend's new lover, as the villain. In an early symbolic scene, Rob twists back Tommy's index finger in a spot outside of Rob's auto shop where Tommy has been spending his afternoons stewing in hatred and resentment.
According to Tommy, everything would be different if he had an external reason to change. In the movie, Tommy's idea of a compelling external reason is symbolized as a wife and a child. Through the character of Mike (Mark Boone, Jr.), the movie demonstrates that the external reason alone doesn't bring true healing to a shame-based alcoholic. Like Tommy, Mike spends most of his time drinking in Trees Lounge. Unlike Tommy, Mike has a wife and a child. According to Tommy, Mike is a ""wacko"" because he still drinks and does drugs despite the fact that he has a compelling external reason (wife and child) to be more responsible.
In a symbolic scene, Mike proclaims to Tommy and two young girls that he is ""serious"". Mike's actions, however, demonstrate that he still has an immature consciousness. After Mike's wife returns home for an apparent reconciliation, he has an opportunity to tell the truth and take responsibility for having a party with young girls in the house when his wife and daughter were away. Instead, he lies which leads to further marital problems when the lie is exposed.
For most of the movie, it appears that Tommy would also not reach a higher level of consciousness. Rather, it appears that Tommy is destined to become an old drunk like Bill (Bronson Dudley) whose purpose in the movie is to act as a symbolic mirror of Tommy's probable future if he doesn't wake up.
Tommy's crisis hits rock bottom when it is discovered that he had an inappropriate relationship with a 17 year old girl (Chloe Sevigny). After the girl's father (Daniel Baldwin) finds out, he hits Tommy on the head with a baseball bat. Symbolically, this blow represents the hit on the head that finally gets through to Tommy and wakes him up.
In the following scene, Tommy is visiting his former girlfriend in the hospital after she has just given birth. In an initial appology, Tommy still holds onto his blaming, victim consciousness. At the end of the conversation, however, Tommy makes an unconditional apology in which he takes full responsibility for himself and his actions.
In the brilliant final scene, Tommy walks into Trees Lounge and symbolically sits in Bill's chair. Shortly thereafter, Tommy learns that Bill is in the hospital in near-death condition. Symbolically, the audience is supposed to infer that Bill lost his wind at the moment of Tommy's unconditional apology and that Bill's survival (i.e., Tommy's future as an old drunk) depends on whether Tommy fully embraces his new change in consciousness in which he takes full responsibility for his life.
With terrific camera work and choice of music, the movie shows that Tommy's external world is changing as a result of his internal change of consciousness. First, Tommy winces after taking a swill of his bottle of beer. Next, Tommy declines to down the shot of Wild Turkey directly in front of him on the bar.
With the close-up shots of Tommy in thought at the end, Buscemi is shifting the focus to Tommy's inner consciousness. If one only looks at Tommy's external circumstances, his crisis appears to have been a disaster. If one looks at Tommy's significant change of consciousness, however, he is a triumphant hero. As a result of a devastating crisis, Tommy woke up and expanded his consciousness. As anyone who has tried to change knows, all real change begins on the inside.
""Trees Lounge"" is a wonderful, thought-provoking film. The acting is superb, the soundtrack is terrific, and the spiritual message is subtly delivered. Highly recommended for everyone, especially spiritual seekers.",1008201600,30,4589,4.937904269081501
1007021,1,6305261490,"Movies exist to entertain. They entertain by telling a story. Some filmmakers choose to ignore the first part and simply tell a story, one that may not be entertaining but still carries some sort of meaning, some sort of message, some sort of point. Some filmmakers choose to ignore the second part and simply entertain with action scenes, or special effects, or humor. It's a rare and tragic thing when a filmmaker ignores both parts and yet still manages to get a movie made, but Trees Lounge is one of these films-- aimless, pointless, and devoid of any entertainment.
In this film, Steve Buscemi (who also wrote and directed this) does a fine job of acting as Tommy, a Long Island resident with no apparent aim in life other than to convince the world that he is the lowest form of human existence. He steals from his employer, he alienates his female childhood friend for the sake of brief sex, he alienates his older friends over the girl, he loses any other jobs he attempts to win, and ultimately his best friend beats him down with a baseball bat and leaves him lying alone in the dirt.
And that, friends, is this film. There is no point to it, no reasoning behind it, no logic behind the assumption that we would want to follow this man as he completely ruins everything he touches and ultimately finds himself desolate and alone, hated by his friends, by his employer, and by us, the audience. I've seen films with far worse acting, with lesser writing and direction... but I've never seen a film so infuriatingly pointless and wasteful as Trees Lounge.
Do not bother with this film.",1000166400,9,1594,4.616197183098592

1007023,5,6305261490,"Anyone can take a story about heroes--or for that matter, strong antiheroes and villains--and hold a viewer's interest for the duration of a  movie.  And many's the hum-drum film about which it could be said ""but  the scenery was breath-taking.""  Tree Lounge has none of that going  for it, which means that Buscemi had his work cut out for him from the time  he first had an idea about making the film.
The regular patrons of Trees  Lounge are an interesting mix.  Especially interesting are those who spend  their lives in the place--literally the entire day.  We have all heard that  ""even the dull and the ignorant have their story.""  Buscemi  handles the  supporting characters by letting us see the puzzling story of  the one successful denizen, which leaves the viewer wondering what the  stories of the others may have been.
Tommy, Buscemi's character, is the  irresponsible, anti-social but somehow engaging alcoholic we have all met  along the way.  He wants others to bond with him, but he is incapable of  holding up his end of any relationship.  Tommy's the sort who would be the  first to tell you that he never asked anybody to get hooked on him or to  trust in him.  Therefore, if anyone ever suffered the consequences for  doing so, it isn't his fault.  And he will be the first to tell you, too,  that he is not an alcoholic and that what drinking he does do hurts nobody  but himself.  And he didn't steal that $1500 from his employer; he just  borrowed it and was going to put it back after his successful (in the  planning stages) trip to Atlantic City.
As the film cruises towards its  close, we see Tommy facing for perhaps the first time that he has had love  all his life, but he abused it until it became lost to him.  He tries to go  back to all the people who once cared for him, only to find them all too  hurt and burned out to want to be involved in his life anymore.  At the end  when Tommy seats himself in the barstool normally resolved for Trees'  oldest all-day drinker (who is then in the hospital dying [probably] alone  [definitely]), Buscemi's face is a study as the character seems to deeply  internize the double meaning of the words from the bartender and customers  who protest, ""Hey!  You're in Bill's seat.""  Will he ever get out  of it?  Who knows?
This is a story about little people in a little bar in  a little town--but it is a hugely satisfying film.  This is one not to be  missed.",964396800,11,2434,4.459954233409611
1007024,4,6305261490,"This film, written and directed by and starring Steve Buscemi is perhaps a tale of how his own life may have gone if he had not made it as an actor. The story centres around a bar, the Trees Lounge, in which Tommy (Buscemi)  hangs out and gets drunk with the other drunks.
Many of the settings are  lifted from Buscemi's life before his acting career took off.
Tommy  doesn't have a job, or a girl or a life. He managed to loose them all at  the same time. In their place, all that he has is an alcoholic haze. What  he really wants more than anything is to get those things back. Ideally,  he'd like the old job and girl but instead he finds himself driving an  ice-cream van and hooks up with the young neice of his ex.
This does not  sound like a brilliant basis for a film and this movie's impact depends  almost exclusively on how the viewer relates to the main character Tommy.  If he is a shallow drunk with no merits beyond a quick intelligence then  the film will not appeal. On the other hand, if you find yourself wishing  him well and hoping that, somehow, he can get himself back together again  then you will enjoy this film.
What makes this movie for me is that  Buscemi is seen in a role where you feel he really is playing a character  that he is close to. In Reservoir Dogs and Escape from LA, he was acting.  Here and in Fargo, he just was.",958694400,2,1359,4.1692307692307695
