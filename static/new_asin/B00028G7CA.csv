Considering the movie Voyage Dans la Lune from 1903 was about 3-4 minutes, I expected this 1905 offering to be about maybe 10 minutes...but the movie bountifully exceeded my expectations, as this 1905 movie is 43 1/2 minutes long!
The movie is an exceptional treat to be sure. There are no dialogue cards, just scene titles, so you have to know scripture to know what they are saying and as is typical for religious movies there are glaring inaccuracies, and even then they felt the need to put in extra stuff not found in scriptures, like angels rescuing Joseph and Mary on the way to Egypt. Also the sign on the cross was typically Catholic (INRI) rather than the scriptural three languages of his kingship. Still it was very interesting to see how they would produce such a movie in 1905. What's also a bonus is it's in colour! Not just Tinted scenes, but hand tinted frames all done at the time making this an incredible experience. One scene scripturaly speaking is out of order {Mary and Joseph sent to Egypt AFTER the killing of the infants scene). The movie has similar feeling to Le Voyage Dans la Lune from '03 in its production values. The movie had the flavour of a kid's stage play in some ways. For 1905 some of the special affects I would say are pretty good...though there is precious little out there to compare it to. The scenes and the stage props were pretty cool I thought. One thing I thought particularly annoying was they burned into the movie the title of the movie in the bottom corner three times for about 10 seconds each and it was quite distracting. Still all told this was an amazing treat. Though no doubt at the time this was a serious attempt, I couldn't help laughing at times at how silly some of the scenes were.

They felt compelled to include a 1958 (The box says it 1962 but the movie copyright says 1958) movie called the ""Power of the Resurrection""(once again they annoyingly burned the title into the movie on several occasions into the corner as well.) With a title like that one would hope the importance of that event would be the central focus. To me it seemed almost marginalized, even to the point of excluding incredibly important events in relation to the resurrection, for example Mary seeing Jesus in the garden is excluded. Once again this movie is typically liberal in its focus and occasionally inaccurate when compared to scripture. For example Peter calling himself the rock (referring to when Jesus called him Cephas [meaning little stone...not rock] and referring to himself as ""this Rock"") Furthermore most of the movie focused on intrigue, possible logic and motivations behind scripture events such as figuring out why Judas would have betrayed Jesus and behind the scenes intrigue rather than actual scriptural focus. If you know the events you can understand what they are talking about, but even then it's liberal in its latitude: obviously to fill time and make it more entertaining...and indeed it is an interesting process to consider events leading up to occurrences. Still this was clearly the main focus in the movie rather than what the movie title would suggest. There was precious little focus on actual scripture or scriptural events. What little there was, was good, but only about 5 minutes of the movie was direct scripture. Thus making the ""power of the resurrection"" somewhat muted in its portrayal and importance. Admittedly the Thomas meeting of the risen Christ scene was surprisingly accurate considering it's importance. It was an interesting movie to be sure, but the acting was somewhat muted in relation to the corresponding events and many key events related to the resurrection were either not depicted or muted in their significance or once again adding possible dialogue rather than sticking with or apparently in preference to scripture. I'm a stickler for accuracy when it comes to movies on scriptures and precious few really are and this one is no exception. A watchable movie to be sure, but only marginally theologically in focus. a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z",1388966400,2,4094,4.686111111111111
