3477404,4,B001AZUU6I,"I bought this for my husband who damaged his legs in a serious accident.  It allows him to safely ""work out"" and build muscle strength without worrying about instability.",1301356800,,170,4.862068965517241
3477405,4,B001AZUU6I,this is a great and helpful aid for teaching--doable for  all ages--beginners and seniors and I incorporate it in my Yoga class.,1293753600,3,128,4.818181818181818
3477406,5,B001AZUU6I,This is a great workout for me as I am sometimes dealing with severe arthritis which makes a lot of movement difficult.  It allows me to work at my own level and feel like I've accomplished something.  Joel is a fantastic video trainer.,1288137600,7,236,4.465116279069767
3477407,5,B001AZUU6I,Easy to do and can do multiple times daily. Keeps you moving and feeling good. Recovering from non weight bearing foot surgery. So able to do this and also for my inlaws 86 and 91 years young.,1269734400,14,192,4.216216216216216

8280721,5,B001AZUU6I,"Wonderful yoga-like routine, stretching out all the kinks -- and not too difficult for those of us with poor balance (or other infirmities) who prefer the support and comfort of a chair.  All in 16 minutes!",1427155200,,206,4.722222222222222

8280723,5,B001AZUU6I,"I have the DVD and love it. This one was ordered as a gift.  I am over 70 with neck fusions at three levels and a plate, lower back surgeries and nerve entrapment in one arm.  My husband is over 80 with arthritis in his hands and mid-back pain. The chair exercises have reduced our pain and my husband's golf game has improved drastically. We also use Joel's DVD ""Firming After 50"".",1398384000,2,382,4.291666666666667
8280724,2,B001AZUU6I,"There was hardly anything on the DVD- only about 15 minutes of things you could figure out for yourself.  Very elementary and therefore not worth the price asked.  I ordered it for my 94 year old mother.  She disliked it, because she is able to do so much more. I'm thinking it MUST be a first effort or something.",1396569600,2,314,4.288135593220339
8280725,2,B001AZUU6I,It's only 16 minutes and would not have spent the money...$1/minute is way too costly for info that can be obtained online for FREE!,1363564800,2,132,4.541666666666667
8280726,5,B001AZUU6I,We are using Joel Harper's Fit Pack Chair Workout during our coffee breaks instead of eating rolls! Everyone that has tried it has felt energized and given it rave reviews.  One person had a medical issue improve because of it.,1350345600,,227,4.675
8280727,5,B001AZUU6I,"It seems like a joke, doesn't it? ""Chair"" workout? But, believe it or not, there's some really cool stuff in here. I learned some stretches and muscle toning exercises that I use at a daily basis at work and even around the house. I would never have known about those techniques had I not seen this video, so ""you go, Joel Harper"" thanks for providing these tips.",1344297600,2,363,4.432835820895522
8280728,1,B001AZUU6I,"$20 for a 16-minute simple, unimaginative chair workout!! Are you kidding me? Of course this is not mentioned in the advertising! This is worth about $2.50 or could be on three pieces of paper with stick figures and cost nothing. Harper and model mom must be laughing all the way to their Swiss bank. Please don't give them more of your money until he and mum produce something of integrity and substance. This is a blatant rip-off which could have easily been avoided by selling it cheaper or adding some meat and potatoes!! I get nauseated and have fits every time I think of the Joel Harper's Fit Pack Chair Workout! Bleeck!",1328227200,6,627,4.607142857142857
8280729,3,B001AZUU6I,"What's here is great, but I was hoping for a workout that was much longer than the ""free"" one on his web site.",1317772800,2,110,3.8260869565217392
