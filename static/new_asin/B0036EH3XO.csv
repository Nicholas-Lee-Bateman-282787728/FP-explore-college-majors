4076406,5,B0036EH3XO,"If you don't count the 1966 cartoon; this marks IM's first appearance.  The former took panels from the comics and made what is called a motion comic today.  This version has all the original villians that tangled with Tony Stark and his company Stark Industries. The only glaring stero type was Mandarin.  He was a villian from his comic debut in the mid sixties.  What sets this series apart was that other super heroes were part of the team.  In this one we get to see the Hulk, Hawkeye (from the Avengers), Spider-Woman,Scarlet Witch and many more.

I do have say that many of the plots were taken straight from the comics.  Modok,who was a villian for the Incredible Hulk, was portrayed as an underling to Mandarin.  In the comics, he operates independently.  In fact, Modok was more of an evil presence in Stark's universe than Madarin was.

From episode 14 to 26, a new set of animators take over. The show has a completely different theme song,""I am Iron Man"" and a drastic cast change.  In a prior episode Stark made his former crew think he met his demise.  When he came back, half his team quit due to lack of trust.  Gone were Scarlet Witch,Century and Hawkeye. The cast was reduced to Iron Man, War Machine and Spider Woman.  Apparently, the powers that be decided they were better to write for.  Episodes 15 through 26 featured more of Nick Fury and his S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.  In this version Fury has to quit smoking and is reduced to having a toothpick instead of a cigarette!

All in all, it's good clean fun and colorful to watch.  If you don't like the current material that passes for entertainment today, and you love Marvel Comics, this is worth every penney!",1273363200,2,1680,4.580536912751678
4076407,4,B0036EH3XO,"Released just in time for a certain movie, the Iron Man Animated Complete Series collects the two season series that ran 1994-1996 as part of the Marvel Action Hour (alongside the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantastic-Four-The-Complete-Animated-Series/dp/B0007US7CQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantastic Four - The Complete Animated Series</a>) - but the two seasons are so different that it may as well be two different shows.

In the first season, Iron Man - accompanied by War Machine and a barely-developed Force Works team (consisting of Scarlet Witch, Spider-Woman, Hawkeye and the Century) battles the Mandarin and his minions (which include M.O.D.O.K. occasionally disguised in a baby carriage) in pretty much self contained episodes. The animation and simplicity of the stories could have been made ten years earlier and are about on a par with He-Man.

In fact the first season could almost be recycled He-Man scripts with the names changed; they're really that simplistic and dated.

Marvel Entertainment must have realized that they were on to a loser, because in the second season everything changes.

The animation improves, most of Force Works leaves, storylines are sometimes stretched out over multiple episodes, stories are cribbed from the comics (such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Man-The-Dragon-Seed-Saga/dp/0785131310/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Man: The Dragon Seed Saga</a>&nbsp;storyline), the Mandarin's presence is dramatically reduced, Iron Man gets new armor, Tony Stark gets a mullet and the show gets a snazzy new title sequence.

It feels like a completely different show - and one that can stand next to the Spider-Man, X-Men and Hulk cartoons of the day (and when do we get the Spidey and Hulk series on DVD?). For these episodes alone, the boxset is worth a look.

Plus, you get Fin Fang Foom. Can't go wrong with that.",1273190400,3,1962,5.9644128113879
4076408,4,B0036EH3XO,"I've been waiting for this set since forever. I thought it would have been released when the first Iron Man movie came out, but all we got was a blu-ray and reissue dvd of the previous Lionsgate Iron Man animated feature (which I hated)and later, the equally lame IM: Armored Adventures. I guess I understand why they waited on releasing this series because it features characters from the new Iron Man 2 film(War Machine and Whiplash - who don't appear in the Lionsgate animated dvd)and creates less confusion for the casual IM fans if this series and characters were ""introduced"" prior to their debut in IM2. My favorites are War Machine and Spider Woman. By-the-way, I like the first season better because it features the other heroes more and the goth theme song's cool too. The best part of movie studios trying to cash in on hot ticket items like Iron Man 2, is that we get great releases like this, that may not have ever been released otherwise. Thank God I waited and didn't buy that bootleg set floating around at various sites. It even costs more.",1273017600,,1058,4.632978723404255
4076409,4,B0036EH3XO,"So I'm excited to have this series on DVD finally, it was part of a series of Marvel Cartoons back in the '90's with X-Men, Spider-Man, Fantastic Four and others.

I caught this series when it first aired on UPN Channel 11 on Sundays and I really enjoyed it. Not as good as X-Men or Spider-Man, but still enjoy able for its style of animation and more solid story lines compared to what else was on and playing at the time.

My only -though minor- complaint with the DVDs is the lack of an episode guide or insert for that purpose.

Otherwise I'm am happy to get this finally.",1273017600,,576,4.26605504587156
4076410,5,B0036EH3XO,"My guess on why Disney is taking forever to release (HIGH IN DEMAND) Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends 1981-83/Incredible Hulk 1982 featured in Season 2 & 3 Of Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends - is because it's in very high demand as of follows.

1. After Disney released Fantastic Four 1994/Spider-Man 1967 - Disney and Marvel started fighting over rights issues

2. As of now 2010 - Disney own Marvel, it's all been settled already. The Boss of Marvel agreed to be bought by Disney in 2009 because he was part of the bargain. Stan Lee personally thinks it will do a lot of good for Marvel Films, TV Series, Animation & Direct To Video Movies, which Disney will be financially distributing and releasing 100%, once all current existing Marvel Screen Contracts with rival companies expire. Marvel is still it's own company including highly trained staff for comics and staff who are experts in the Marvel Comics Universe to help make Marvel Animation as original to the comics as possible, Disney just now financially own and distributed the Marvel Comics Company specifically in the Screen Entertainment format while they also do trading with Marvel Comics Magazines

3. Before and after Disney/Marvel settled them self's - the current master copies to Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends/Incredibly Hulk 1982 - used on TV by Disney - have far too much cut out edited sound and scenery featured in the show from when it first broadcast in the 1980's, which Disney have absolutely no idea on how to find or any idea on production history of how to find them, but know that true fans want the originals as the below website makes abundantly clear to Disney who it is meant to be read by, which is why Disney haven't yet bothered to release this High In Demand Series, and from my guess they have only just started looking into finding the original master copies, which I can tell you will take them way, way above the expected average financial staff fee limit for finding original master copies, which I will explain in the next sentence.
HERE'S THE WEB SITE - [...]

4. The original distributors(ARP FILMS) sued Marvel in 1986 due to not keeping to part of their agreement with Marvel. Because of that, in 1987 NEW WORLD become the new distributors, who in 1988 approx - created new re-mastered master copies to all of Marvel's 1978-86 Animated series including too much editing and changing the original themes/Credits/Commercial Gaps including cutting bits out to fit more commercials in on TV and Sound in the background being removed plus more. And from then onwards, too many new third parties have done even more editing from NEW WORLD'S Un-Original Master Copies, making each new edited version - edited from the previous edited version which is far too annoying for top fans, which is why Disney have not yet bothered to released this incredibly high in Demand series.",1266624000,7,2879,4.83367139959432
4076411,5,B0036EH3XO,"Iron Man debuted in 1994 next to the 94 Fantastic Four on the MARVEL action hour on the Fox Kids network. This was a good series but it was short compared to X-Men and Spider-Man which were also on Fox Kids. This was a good series. Iron Man ran for 2 seasons. It featured two different intro themes. The first had a gothic pipe organ theme, the other had the lyrics, ""I am Iron Man!"".

Iron Man follows the adventures of Iron Man himself and his friends War Machine, Spider-Woman, Century, Hawkeye and The Scarlet Witch fighting The Mandarin and his evil forces and stopping them from taking over the earth. The first season is kind of silly but it gets more darker with the second season.

It's nice to see another one of Marvel's 90s animated series being released along with the final season of X-Men. I just hope we can someday see the 90s Spider-man get a DVD release along with some of Marvel's other animated shows such as Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends. I just don't know why Disney has to be too darn slow on releasing such ""most-wanted"" titles. Heck, they haven't finished releasing Gargoyles and the Tick. So far the only entire Marvel animated series they have released so far is Fantastic Four, the 67 Spider-Man and the X-Men. Let's hope someday they'll release the 94 Spider-Man, Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends and more. Heck, they even need to release other Fox Kids titles such as Eek the Cat.

4076509,5,B0036EH3XO,"First off, let me just say that Marvel characters are my favorite super heroes in any media format.  This was my introduction to Iron Man.  When I was a kid I liked the first season for this & the Fantastic Four, & loved X-Men & Spider-Man.  Then my dad showed me his old comics, my favorites of which 3 issues of Iron Man & a really good Marvel Team-Up with Spider-Man, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Moon Knight & Daredevil.  So then I started getting any Marvel comics I could find cheap or that looked good, so when the 2nd season of the Marvel Action Hour came, I had a better understanding of the Marvel Universe so I appreciated most of the cameos.  And I was blown away by how improved the shows were.  Even 6-year old me could've told you they were better than ever.  But I'll still discuss the history of this show with you.  Although it was called Iron Man, it was really more like Force Works: The Animated Series.  Iron Man, with the heroes War Machine, Spider-Woman II (Julia Carpenter), Century, the Scarlet Witch & Hawkeyeformed Force Works teaming up against the Mandarin & his henchmen MODOK, Blizzard, Dread Knight, Blacklash, Whirlwind, Grey Gargoyle, Living Laser, Fin Fang Foom, Justin Hammer, & the original character Hypnotia (a substitute for the Enchantress).  Looking back, having all these vintage Marvel characters together sounds like it would have made a great show.  But the final result is more Super Friends than Justice League, with lame jokes, poor animation & nonsensical plots; just like in the Fantastic Four show.  It took me a few years to notice it.  When I got the only VHS released for this & Fantastic Four, I thought ""These are good, but not as good as the second seasons.""  I eventually came to realize how stupid they were & gave them away, hoping that they would release the 2nd season episodes on home video, & at long last here they are.  I got it shortly after it came out, & have watched it several times since then.  It never gets old.

Here's a review for all of the good episodes, with synopsizes from Marvel Animation Age & Wikipedia.

Season 1 is pretty poor for the most part, but if you watch one episode, I recommend this one, found on Disc 1.

6. Enemy Within, Enemy Without:  Mandarin's forces kidnap a fashion model while Modok defects to Iron Man's team. Modok then reveals that the model is his wife, and he will betray The Mandarin if Tony Stark helps her.  Ron Freidman may have made a mockery out of Iron Man & the Fantastic Four for the most part, but he tried his best with this episode & succeeded with a pretty good story.  B+

After that, just skip to the next disc for the real reason people like this show.

14. Beast Within:  Mandarin tries to lure Iron Man into a trap so that he can steal his armor. When Tony Stark fakes his death and emerges in new armor, the Mandarin joins forces with Iron Man to foil a horrific plot by Fin Fang Foom.  This is a terrific start for the excellent second season.  A+

15. Fire & Rain:  Firebrand, the son of a disgruntled former Stark board member, causes a blackout, and when Iron Man confronts him, Firebrand destroys a huge hydroelectric dam, endangering the city.  My second least favorite episode of the season, but it's still great.  A

16. Cell of Iron:  Iron Man discovers a mysterious space station called Star Well when he investigates a terrorist satellite attack on a school in China. Iron Man must stop the mile-long satellite from crashing into New York City.  A very well-done episode.  A+

17.  Not Far From the Tree:  Tony receives a plea for help from his thought to be deceased father. After rescuing him, Tony must deal with old wounds and battle a takeover of Stark Enterprises.  This is a very interesting episode.  A+

18.  Beauty Knows No Pain:  The disfigured Madame Masque becomes inhabited by the spirit of the Egyptian goddess Isis. Tony must save Julia Carpenter from a disaster in the subway tunnels of Cairo, caused by Masque.  Madame Masque was one of my favorite villains in the comics, so I was thrilled when she showed up on the show.  A+

19.  Iron Man, on the Inside:  Iron Man shrinks down to molecular size to implant a lifesaving ""chip"" in Hawkeye's spine. Inside Hawkeye, Iron Man must battle his immune system and a molecular sized Ultimo.  Hawkeye was my favorite of the FW characters (even though he never actually was a member), so any season 2 episode with him in it is a favorite of mine.  A+

20. Distant Boundaries:  When Iron Man assists in the landing of an unidentified, unmanned space ship, he learns that it was sent by the distant planet, Elysian, with a distress message - pleading for Iron Man's help in their fight against a madman called Dark Aegis.  This is another excellent episode. A+

21-22. Armor Wars:  Adapted from the ""Armor Wars"" comic series. Iron Man tries to stop a coup in Russia involving Crimson Dynamo, but many people are hurt and Iron Man is made a scapegoat.  Tony also discovers, to his horror, that Crimson Dynamo had some secret Stark technology in his armor that contributed to the tragedy.  Feeling responsible, Tony designs ""negators"" and sets out to take on every armored warrior in the world.  Rhodey and Julia beg him to stop.  Nick Fury warns him not to do it.  But Iron Man proceeds, amyways.  Justin Hammer, who stole the technology in the first place, is thrilled with the furor over Iron Man's actions.  This is the second best story in the whole season.  It's also a vast improvement over the comic version.  A+

23. Empowered:  When Modok locates one of Mandarin's rings, the Mandarin comes to claim it. Iron Man must travel to Modok's cave to battle the Mandarin.  A clip show, but the surrounding footage is worth watching, though it still feels like a waste.  C+

24.  Hulk Buster:  The Leader plans to go back in time and murder a young Dr. Bruce Banner in order to gain the Hulk's mighty powers. Iron Man and the real Hulk battle The Leader through several time periods.  The Hulk is another one of my favorite Marvel characters, & this episode does him justice.  A+

25-26. Hands of the Mandarin:  Iron Man must recruit his old team to fight Mandarin, who captures New York City in an attempt to control the world. Mandarin also builds up his old crew, and the two forces battle.  They saved the best story for last.  This is a perfect finale.  A+

The reason I like Marvel cartoons better than the DC ones is with the exception of X-Men they are pretty easy to imagine as being canon with the comics.  All Marvel needs is some little omissions &/or little rewrites.  DC comics often don't gel with the animated continuities, with the exception of some of the minor characters like Booster Gold, Blue Beetle & Mister Miracle.  I know it's a strange reason, but that's just me.  Anyways, this is the perfect ending for the story of Iron Man.  If you've seen it, you know what I mean.  I paid $12.99 for it & that's the perfect price; a dollar for every watchable episode.  I would have paid 3 times as much if I had to, the second season is incredible.  The animation isn't just good-looking compared to the first season; its good-looking period.  The voices are awesome too.  Robert Hays IS Iron Man, Dorian Harwood IS War Machine, Robert Ito IS the Mandarin; you get the idea, the voices are perfect.  The characters are complex and the writing is mature.  Just so you know, some characters actually die in this cartoon.  Compared to the other Marvel cartoons, this is a welcome twist (though I have to admit, I still love X-Men & Spider-Man).  Like I said, if I could save one show from cancellation, it would be this series so that the people who turned garbage into gold could continue telling us good stories.  Every Iron Man fan should have this in his or her collection.  If you enjoyed the movie, definitely pick this up (Although to be honest I didn't.  Iron Man is a bit too much of a jerk in the movies for me, & the first 2 suffer from a weak second half & a weak opening half, respectively.  Haven't seen the 3rd one, but I will definitely give it a try.).  You'll kick yourself for not having watched it, if you were around when it was on.  I give it 5 stars because the price was right & the second season more than makes up for the first.",1367971200,,8261,4.504383007417397

This series like other ventures by Marvel, gets a radical improvement in animation quality about halfway through the series.

I especially love the openings for the series, the one with the kick-ass song, ""I am Iron-Man.""  This series is good from beginning to end and for any fan of Marvel is a must own.

Sadly, Spiderman (1994 series), Incredible Hulk (1990s series), Silver Surfer (1990s series), and others are not availale in the United States.  I have no idea why whoever owns the rights to these series will not stamp them out and sell them.

Check out ClearVision in the UK, they have rights to all Marvel cartoon series and are selling them like hotcakes.  Oh to be in England right now...

For now buy Iron-Man, Fantastic Four, and the X-Men and hope for a day when all the rest make it stateside.

4076529,1,B0036EH3XO,"The problem here is just like the first season.  Done extremely cheap.  The software designed for the DVD is not compatable with all DVD players.  I do not have old equipment but could not get past the first episodes to play.  When I choose the play all selection off the list, the first episode would play and after that was over with, you were screwed.  The screen went dark and the unit clicked or was quite. It would cause the remote control and the buttons not to respond on the units either like they should.  Very very crappy. Depending on the player I used.  The first season was not that big of a miss.  It's coloring was second grader.  This was 1994 when it was done, but the coloring was as bad as if it was the old Super Friends of the early 70's.  You would have Iron Man's suit one color one minute and then change.  It was a constant problem.  I thought that drug testing in the work place was supposed to have helped stop this.  Save your money.  I never got far enough due to issues, and yes I exchanged and this happened on the other package, to see if the season with Starks longer hair was included.  That when they actually made a soundtrack for the cartoon and not the lame crap of the first season.",1299801600,,1222,4.252173913043478
4076530,3,B0036EH3XO,"Before I start, I should say that I love the show and it was first on. I would get up early in the morning (Sunday morning as I remember) just to watch it back to back with the fantastic four; of the two I definitely preferred Ironman. I was unbelievably happy when I got a second series in the animation improved so much. Watching it again so many years later, does that still hold up?

For me the answer is no in a big way. Animation is very low quality, even for its day. Normally I wouldn't comment on this and make any big fuss about it, but one thing they did with that really threw me off. They only had enough money to do one scene where he was changing into his Ironman outfit insert of a semi-3-D animation. It was something novel in its day, but looking back it just pulls you out of the animation. I know they only did that much because they couldn't afford to do that kind of animation for the entire episode, but I've asked my friend and we both felt that it almost feels like they're saying ""We can do good animation. Here it is. Now we take it away. Ha ha ha."" It's a minor thing, nothing I'd count off for really, but it dulls the luster a little bit.

What makes me lower the view really is a laughably bad plots. That's not to say there weren't some really good ones, there were. I was especially fond of one where Iron Man has his armor specification stolen and goes on a one-man crusade to destroy all versions of it but the criminals are using. It's a two-part episode and it really shows him going over the edge. While you have good episodes like that, you have many boring ones where enemy X is dispatch, Ironman fights him/her, almost loses, but hurray he wins, boring stuff and some really bizarre ones too. There's one episode in which they wanted to teach children something I guess so they have Ironman losing power in his suit when he's able to recharge using Walkman. Are you kidding me? Their whole point was to teach children that soundwaves could power something that the output of a Walkman is can be nowhere near strong enough power some sort of suit like that. We're talking about two 1.5 V batteries for goodness sake. You can teach something to kids without being that lazy.

Season to up the ante for the animation, much improving it. What really hurt it for me though is that his freedom works group was almost entirely left out of the second season. They show up for may be two episodes or three and otherwise it's pretty much just Ironman running around doing his own thing. It's possible that you would like that, I have no idea. For me though I preferred the team environment. I will say though, I really did like the Mandarin's quest to get his rings back and the final episode of the series.

To sum it up this is a show that was much better in my memory is that when I watched it again. I suppose that's true of a lot of things, but when I go back to watch Batman or Superman they still seem to stand up on their own to this day. I don't regret getting this set, but if I had to do it over again I'd probably skip it.",1294272000,4,3065,4.225255972696246

Both shows showed some promise but inevitably left a huge gap of things to be desired. The 2nd disc picks up a bit more steam in terms of story & animation. The downside is no special features & your left with a satisfactory product. I more or less knew what to expect as I was already aware of this series when it aired on TV back in the early 90's. It's a nice piece of nostalgia to see what came before the live action movies that became such a hit. If your looking for a great animated feature with Iron Man look no further than ""The Invincible Iron Man"" from 2007 & the current Iron Man ""Armored Adventures"" series.

4076547,3,B0036EH3XO,"Sometimes I'm convinced that there will never be another period in superhero animation quite as exciting as the early 1990's. There were shows literally popping up on nearly every single network with each new season, some ranging from the immensely popular (Superman: The Animated Series for example) to the truly obscure (anyone remember Ultraforce?). The shows were typically divided into two separate and distinct classes: The after school series and the Saturday morning series.

As logic would suggest, the after school shows were a bit darker, grittier and allowed to get away with much more (watch an episode of Batman: The Animated Series if you find yourself in doubt) while the Saturday morning set was generally brighter, milder, and a whole lot more campy. Interestingly, this is where a majority of Marvel's animated shows found themselves and many were represented: X-Men, Spiderman, Fantastic Four, Iron Man, and The Hulk to name a few.

I recall enjoying some of the earlier entries mentioned clearly but somehow managed to fall out of the whole scene by the time shows like Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk aired (I suspect it had something to do with jobs, girlfriends, sports cars, that kind of stuff).

Anyway, you'll likely understand my excitement when I discovered that Marvel has finally decided to grace us with an official DVD box set. I ordered without hesitation in anticipation of catching up on what I missed out on all those years before- Hey, better late than never!

The set comes in at a total runtime of 572 minutes and contains all 26 episodes of the show across three discs.

The audio is presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 (stereo) and the only language option is English. Extras are completely zilch but again, beggars can't be choosers (or so I'm told).

Now onto the show itself: In the history of animation I'm aware of only one other program that managed to pull off such a radical swing between the first and second season and live to tell about it. That other show just so happens to be another Marvel property: Fantastic Four the 1994-95 series. I was warned countless times about the unambiguous swing from awful to decent even before I began the series but it's still difficult to accurately convey the train wreck that is the first season (episodes 1-13) of Iron Man without appearing overly merciless or on an agenda.

In effort to keep it simple, I'll start at the beginning. The first episode, And the Sea Shall Give Up Its Dead, somehow manages to combine all of the worst elements of Superfriends, Scooby-Doo, and He-Man then manages to integrate them into a muddled mess of plot points and poor acting. It should be noted that Fresh Prince's Uncle Phil (James Avery, none other than Shredder from competing show, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) provides the vocals for James Rhodes/ War Machine in the early episodes then vanishes around the fifth episode never to be heard from again.

Honestly, if this first episode was in fact the pilot, it's downright amazing that the show ever saw the light of day. Fortunately things get a little better in the subsequent 12 episodes. Rather than try to cram as many scattered subplots into the twenty-three minutes as humanly possible, writer Ron Friedman settled down into a rhythm that was much closer to what we could expect from some of the finer moments of shows like Superfriends or the 1980s incarnation of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The plots almost always revolved around the Mandarin and his band of lackeys hatching up some scheme of world domination and Iron Man (with what is called the Armory Team (more on that later)) stepping in at the zero hour to save the world.

There are some really convoluted attempts at back-story amidst these episodes (such as Iron Man and Mandarin's origins) but even a fan of these characters will likely end up slightly more confused than enlightened (that's experience talking right there).

I'm not sure what they were thinking when the decision was made to integrate stock footage into each episode for Stark's transformation into Iron Man but the only mistake superseding that one was to approve the computer generated stock footage that they had to do it with! Sure I realize CGI was absolutely cutting edge back in 1994 when the show was being produced but why nobody who watched the test footage stopped to say, ""why does Iron Man's armor go from red to pink in this sequence?"" is beyond me.

Then there's the Armory Team... Why this show wasn't called Avengers Junior is really anybody's guess. Tony Stark is surrounded at all times by War Machine, Spider-Woman, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye and Century. On the other side of the coin our buddy Mandarin doesn't make a move without the aid of Modock, Blizzard, Dread Knight, Hipnotia, Grey Gargoyle, Whirlwind, Blacklash and occasionally Living Laser and Stark-hating mogul Justin Hammer (each complete with single-brain cell intellect).

Just as things were starting to get better, the thirteenth and final episode of the first season (The Wedding of Iron Man) comes along and introduces a new low point to an already sinking series. Namely when a Tony Stark, dressed in drag, dons the Iron Man armor to appear at his own wedding to Julia Carpenter to prove once and for all that the man walking down the isle simply cannot be the same dude in the armor (never mind just letting someone else wear a replica Iron Man armor to the wedding). Rather, the show's big ironic twist comes when the Tony Stark getting married reveals that he is in fact just an android by opening his tuxedo to reveal a chest full of computer components apparently salvaged from the early Apollo missions. Cue up forced laughter of superhero team standing in a circle then fade to black. I think perhaps now you may better understand the Superfriends comparisons.

Then suddenly, just when you realize there's no way you'll be getting a refund for the $20 you sunk on this box set, the second season begins and within the first fifteen seconds of the first episode (# 14, The Beast Within), all hope is restored. The show's not just good when compared to the first season; it's just plain good period. The artwork is better, the voice acting more consistent; the beginning theme music/ animation is superior, the pacing is much more organized and above all else the episode plots are spot-on.

It turns out that while X-Men the Animated Series was done by Saban and Spider-Man by Marvel Film Animation, the first season of Iron Man was done by a company called Rainbow Animation Group, a firm oft criticized for having been stuck in early 1980's in terms of animation style and quality of production.

Season 2 went with a new firm (Koko Enterprises) and kicked Ron Friedman to the curb in favor of Tom Tataranowicz. Better still, rather than create new ""kid friendly"" material for the animated format, the second season witnessed a return to some of the classic comic-story threads that made Iron Man such a promising property throughout the years.

The Mandarin remains one of the focal points but this time the show wastes little time in having a deal gone bad between he and a (much more intimidating) Fin Fang Foom results in his power rings being scattered throughout the globe. Not only does this move level the playing field, it creates an excellent ongoing thread element where the viewer is given a glimpse into the trials and tribulations of a powerless Mandarin in the final few moments of each episode.

Additionally the team element comes to an end only rather than just cheapen out and scratch the remaining heroes, the second season writes in a pretty believable reason for the ""Armory Team"" to become disgruntled under Stark's leadership which results in their walking. Jim Rhodes and Julia Carpenter (War Machine & Spider-Woman respectively) opt to stick it out with Tony.

Another point of improvement worth noting is the inclusion of depth brought to the characters in the second season. The cardboard-cutout, one-dimensional (and I'm rounding up there) characters of the first season evolve into individuals with realistic motivations, ambitions, and fears (like Jim Rhodes developing a phobia of being trapped inside his War Machine armor which just so happens to have been based on a then-current comic storyline).

In conclusion the fact that season 1 pales in comparison (and that's putting it very lightly) to season 2 is not nearly as remarkable as the fact that happened twice, in as many years, to the same people!

I've found that the best way to view this collection is to consider it a purchase of the stellar second season with the complete first season included as a bonus feature.",1276732800,18,8682,4.869241192411924
4076548,3,B0036EH3XO,"The ""Iron Man"" comic book series has been a strong part of the Marvel Universe.  Originally created by Stan Lee and debuting in Tales of Suspense #39 back in 1963,the series revolved around the playboy and industrial millionaire Tony Stark who suffered a severe heart injury during a kidnapping.  Keeping him alive was a device connected to his heart and being the master inventor that he is, creates a suit of armor to help keep him alive but also to become the super hero known as Iron Man.

The character continues to be a popular and within the last four decades since his character debut, Iron Man has gone through various uniforms with one given to his best friend James Rhodes who would go on to become War Machine.  And with the resurgence of comic book collecting in the early '90s, Marvel capitalized the opportunity by releasing new animated series.

And in 1994, the Marvel Action Hour was born. ""Iron Man"" aired from 1994-1996 in syndication along with ""The Fantastic Four"" and also had a popular toy line to go along with the animated series.  Although the episodes have been shown on television, the complete 1994 animated television series (featuring both seasons) for ""Iron Man"" will now be released on DVD via a 3-disc DVD set.

The first season of the ""Iron Man"" animated series was quite different from the comic book series as it featured Iron Man taking on the Mandarin and his group of villains which include Dreadknight, Blizzard, Blacklash, Grey Gargoyle, Hypnotia, Whirlwind, Living Laser, MODOK, Fin Fang Foom and Justin Hammer.  Joining Iron Man in the battle are his fellow Force Works team (ala remnants of the West Coast Avengers) featuring Century, War Machine, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye and Spider Woman.  By the second season, there was a connection to the comic book series with the inclusion of ""The Armor Wars"" storyline.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Iron Man - The Complete 1994 Animated Television Series"" is presented in full screen (1:33:1).  It's important to note that a lot of animation created in the '90s don't hold up as well in terms of picture quality.  I've always felt that the Marvel animated series from the early '80s had more detail when it came to artistic backgrounds and even the characters themselves.  But for the most part, the animation is fine but for those with larger television sets, the edge enhancement is quite apparent as well as interlacing.  Although, I was watching this on a 51', I switched to a smaller screen and on smaller screens, things looked better but the interlacing is still noticeable.

But it's important to remind people that this is an animated series that is over 15-years-old and it was the first Marvel animated series to also sport CG.  Although, the CG is quite dated by today's standards.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

Audio is presented in Dolby Digital 2.0.  The sound effects are fine and the dialogue is clear.  I preferred to have my receiver settings set at stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundscape but for the most part, there are no issues with audio.

Subtitles are in English SDH.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are no special features included.

EXTRAS:

""Iron Man - The Complete 1994 Animated Television Series"" comes with a slip cover.

JUDGMENT CALL:

It's great to see ""Iron Man"" the animated series finally being released on DVD.  As a big fan of Iron Man especially enjoying and collecting the comic books for many years, it's great to see the character receiving some love by fans especially since the first live action film had done so well.

When the ""Iron Man"" animated series was released in 1994, I have to admit that although I enjoyed the character and the comic book series, I didn't like the enemies presented in the animated series at all.  To have Mandarin being this leader of evil (like Magneto and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants) just didn't seem right.  Also, to see A.I.M. leader MODOK working for Mandarin also seemed a bit out of place.

But when the series was on television, one of the major reasons I was staying tuned to the series was that the characters of the West Coast Avengers (Force Works) were in the series.  When the X-Men animated series was released two years earlier, I was wanting an Avengers series (which would eventually happen but several years later), so this ""Iron Man"" animated series was the best thing at that time.

I felt that the first season of ""Iron Man"" was a bit hokey but by the second season things started to get better.  Especially with the inclusion of the Armor Wars and also showcasing the Hulk Buster armor (it's important to note that the ""Hulk Buster"" episode was connected to the Incredible Hulk animated series in 1996 but the animated series has not yet been released on DVD).

As for the DVD itself, it's great to see all episodes from both seasons on DVD.  I guess it has been so long since I have seen the episodes that I was a bit shocked by the edge enhancement and interlacing but I suppose considering the age of the series, this is probably the best we will see of these older animated series.

Overall, ""Iron Man - The Complete 1994 Animated Television Series"" was great for nostalgic sake and for hardcore Iron Man fans, if you enjoyed the animated series between 1994-1996, then definitely give this DVD a chance!",1276646400,3,8399,4.481505944517833
4076549,3,B0036EH3XO,"The thing you need to know getting this show is that there are two seasons by 2 different head writers and animators. So you have the first season which has very poor animation. And on top of that the writing and theme song is about as low on the 80's cartoons schlock scale as you can get (despite this being made in the 90's). The characters are one dimensional and the plots make about as much sense as an episode on Ninja Turtles.

Then we get to the second season. Which cleans up the animation, opening theme, and the writing putting it more on par with other 9-'s marvel cartoons such as X-men and The Incredible Hulk (which still needs a DVD release). Some the stories are based on actual comic book stories. And everything really picks up.

So if you get this and find the first episode unbearable try poping in the second disc and got to the episode called ""The Beast Within"" which is the start of the second season and try from there.",1275868800,2,945,4.363636363636363

4076552,4,B0036EH3XO,"The second time Marvel's Iron Man was adapted for a TV cartoon (the first being the kind of cheesy 1966 version), was in this two-season syndicated series that premiered in 1994 as part of The Marvel Action Hour. Stan Lee appeared onscreen as host, and though these intros are not included on the new DVD, Iron Man: The Complete Animated Series, the end credits mention it.

This is actually, in effect, two series with the same actor, Robert Hays, as the voice of Iron Man. The first season was produced by Rainbow Animation with scripts largely by Ron Friedman. The animation is a sort of lower budget ThunderCats, with recycled action and somewhat limited scope. The stories are a bit overloaded with characters so numerous they weigh down the chance to develop them.

There are also plenty of pop culture references (David Letterman?) and Bill Clinton himself is depicted rather than a generic President (voiced by none other than Jim Cummings, the voice of Tigger, Pooh, Darkwing Duck and many more including Ray, the beloved firefly in The Princess and the Frog). This set of episodes also allows you to see the origins of Iron Man and his arch nemesis, Mandarin and his henchman, MODOK (also Cummings).

Once you hit episode 14, there is a distinct difference in style and a totally different theme song. This season was produced by Koko Animation and written by such comic book veterans as Len Wein. The animation is more elaborate but what is particularly noticeable is the dialogue. While there is a lot of action, an effort seems to have been made to flesh out the personalities, conflicts and, most of all the inner turmoils that are the Marvel trademark.

The cast, by and large, provides outstanding performances of what could potentially be campy. Robert Hays is given the opportunity as the voice of Iron Man to deliver more depth and complexity than many of his best-known characters in TV shows like Angie and the movie Airplane!

Most of the voices were recast in the two series. James Rhodes (aka War Machine) is played by James Avery in season 1 and by Dorian Harewood in season 2. Ed Gilbert (Baloo in Disney's TaleSpin) as Mandarin is recast with Robert Ito (Quincy).

In season 2, when the Incredible Hulk appears in an episode, Ron Perlman (of the Bill Bixby live action series), voices the Hulk and Dr. Banner. Also this season, Wanda/Spider Woman is voiced by Jennifer Hale, who is the current voice of Disney's Cinderella.

The episodes look and sound great on the three discs. It would be nice if there was a printed episode guide in the package. I know budgets are an issue, but surely one panel of the enclosed Blu-Ray flyer could be used. That way, it's less likely to be tossed away!",1273449600,5,2716,4.7293868921775895

8389936,5,B0036EH3XO,"Before the movie ""Iron Man"" came out in theaters in 2008 and started the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there was this classic 1994 animated series Iron Man. Unlike other Marvel animated series of the 90s, ""Iron Man"" barely contains episodes based on the Iron Man comic book storylines. The show features Force Works (Hawkeye, Century, Scarlett Witch, Spider-Woman & War Machine) and for the first 13 episodes, Iron Man & Force Works battles the Mandarin & his posse (MODOK, Justin Hammer, Hyponita, Dreadknight, Blacklash, Living Laser, Grey Gargoyle & Whirlwind) in open-and-shut cases. In the final 13 episodes, it features Tony Stark dealing with his own personal demons which led to the disbandment of Force Works, Rhodey giving up the War Machine identity due to his fear of drowning and the infamous ""Armor Wars"" which based on the classic ""Armor Wars"" comic book storyline while the Mandarin begins his global quest of searching for his rings after losing in the battle against Fin Fang Foom & the dragons.
