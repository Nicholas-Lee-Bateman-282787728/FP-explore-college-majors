1850524,5,B00008LDZU,"I bought this as a tape for my VCR many years ago and loved it.  I lent it someone and never got it back - now I know why!  I had forgotten how, enjoyable and effective these workouts are.  Although this is 55 minutes long it works every part of the body and you feel the muscles still working long after you have finished.  I have started collecting the DVDs for all the tapes that I have.  Also note that the music is so good on this that it makes the exercise enjoyable.  I highly recommend this one.",1467763200,4,503,4.081632653061225

1850526,5,B00008LDZU,"I've own this program before. There are two other Programs in this system, titled: ""THE FIRM BODY SCULP"" and ""THE FIRM AB SCULPT"". I'm sure that there are consumers who aren't aware of this. Originally each program came individually cased inside of an ""outer sleeve"". This is one of ""THE FIRMS"" better programs, though it is somewhat strenuous. But I would suggest modifying any move that can't be safely done or without pain. I don't step to high because I have somewhat of a bum left knee. I also don't jump up and down. When I first had this program it came with the Two-Part ""The FIRM STEP"", in ""VHS FORMAT"". I then wound up buying the step again, but with DVD'S. I used it for awhile and then put it to the side, probably during ""Rotation"". I didn't use it again for a long time. Then about four and a half years back my entire program, on DVD'S, were stolen. Though it wasn't the only ""FIRM BODY SCULPTING SYSTEM"" I had, I was brokenhearted to have lost it. I actually had forgotten about this program until I decided to go back to ""THE FIRM"". Over the years and even recently I've used other programs: ""HULA"", ""BELLYDANCING"", ""ZUUMBA"", ""SALSA"", ""BALLROOM DANCING"", LESLIE SANSONE ""WALKING PROGRAMS"", JOYCE VEDRAL'S ""STRENGTH TRAINING PROGRAMS"", AND OTHER VARIOUS AEROBIC PROGRAMS. I've mostly only kept to a few, like: The Walking Programs, Some of the Dance Programs, Some Of Joyce Vedrals Programs, and ""THE FIRM"", which seem to be the most effective.

I'm really excited about getting back with this program. I know about and trust ""THE FIRM"" to get me into shape fairly quick, if I use the program. I've already began a steady exercise program. Unfortunately I've had to use a different step, one that I've had for years. ""THE CLASSIC STEP"". It will suffice until I get another adjustable step. I would suggest this to anyone who wants to get into shape and strength train at the same time, without using alot of time. Buy this. Hopefully the entire program can be found at one time. If not, then buy them individually. They're not to expensive. The thing is, I'm not sure that ""THE FIRM STEP"" is still available. But I think it's worth it to look for one. If they aren't available then get as close to a facsimile as possible. Some kind of a step is needed, even if it is a short one.",1467504000,8,2296,4.559322033898305

1850530,4,B00008LDZU,"I've been doing this workout off and on for about 12 years.  For a quick rundown on what it includes:

-It's about 56 min, including warm-up and cool-down.  The warm-up is about 7 min and includes some challenging moves like push-ups.  They always give you modified versions of each exercise, though, in case you are a beginner.
-After the warm-up, they go right into weight-lifting, alternating between leg and arm work.
-The entire workout is broken up (at least in my head) into four sections.  The first three sections start with arm and leg dumbbell work and then end with about a 5-6 min cardio routine.  The final section has arm, leg, butt, and ab work, but no final cardio routine.  So, basically, there's about 15-18 min of cardio total.
-You need their ""fanny lifter"" or a very tall step for the step-up exercise and a front lunge exercise.  They also use a step for two of the cardio sections.  You need a range of dumbbells, as obviously some muscle groups need higher weights than others.  When I first started years ago, I used sets of 6, 8, and 10 lb weights.  Now I use sets of 10 and 15 lb weights, and I hold my 10 & 15 lb weights together (i.e. giving me 25 lbs in each hand) for the back rows.

At first I thought the ""CardioSculpt"" was a bit of a misnomer.  Like I wrote earlier, only about a 1/4 of the workout is straight cardio.  But if you use challenging enough weights, your heart rate will will stay high during this.  I've also adjusted some things to make it harder, including the following:

-During the first cardio section, I do a high knee jog instead of marching in place.  I try to jump as high as possible with the side to side leaping move they do.  I also hold light hand weights during each cardio section and the warm-up.

-During the second cardio section, I use the taller step instead of the short one (which they use).  Same for the lunge set they do in the second weight training section.  I also use the taller step for the third cardio routine and use much higher weights than they do during that section.

-For the chest fly exercise in the final weight training section, I use heavy weights and do them much slower.  They perform that move so fast, you could never use an especially challenging weight.

So all that said, I still love this video.  It has grown with me as I've developed in endurance.  I used to run a lot and used this as my weight-training.  Now I'm into HIIT and tabata style cardio, and still find this this a challenging part of my rotation.  Frankly, the last ab section is still incredibly hard for me.  (FYI, I'm in my 30's and would consider myself an intermediate-somewhat advanced exerciser.)",1459641600,13,2670,4.447422680412371

1850538,4,B00008LDZU,"I am an ""old school"" (80's series) FIRM workout fanatic but try to venture out to other things now and again.  I picked up some newer FIRMS a few years back and was sorely disappointed.  This video is a pleasant surprise!  Allie strikes a great balance between ""firm"" and ""peppy"" and leads well.  Though I do not need it, I appreciate that they have a modified version in the line up of ""friends"" as so many people get discouraged if they go to hard and too fast,  I was dreading a ""cha cha"" dance sequence.  Sure enough they had one...but Allie demonstrated it well and I think I can grasp it in another time or two.  ;)  I felt great after the hour I spent with Allie and have purchased two more of her DVDs.  Can't wait to try them.  Thanks Allie!",1449878400,2,750,4.21830985915493
1850561,5,B00008LDZU,"This is the very first Firm video I ever worked out to, on January 1, 2008. This video, in conjunction with Ab Sculpt and Body Sculpt, got me into the best shape of my life in record time; I went from a size 10 to a size 6 in three months! This video was my favorite one out of the three to do. It's very difficult and I quit halfway through it the first time I tried it. But what's important is that I got through it the next time and with hard work and determination, I looked and felt better than I ever had in my entire life. It's unfortunate that I am overweight right now, but I got back into The Firm last year and I've lost 40 pounds so far and I'm hoping to lose at least 20 more by June 20 (The first day of Summer). I'll never regret trying out these videos. The best advice I can give to any first timers out there is, try working out without the weights for a while (maybe a month). It'll still be challenging without the weights, but when it's not, that's when you add the weights. If you need to get some water or catch your breath (which I do almost every time), pause the video for about a minute, drink water, wipe the sweat away, then get right back into it; there's no shame in being overwhelmed by a tough workout like this. You will need the Firm Fanny Lifter and eventually 3, 5 and 8 pound dumbbells. This is one video you want to have if you're serious about getting in shape.",1449187200,7,1401,4.061371841155235

1850568,5,B00008LDZU,"I bought this workout as part of a box set with the fanny lifter many moons ago (VHS Version). I recently came across the video when doing a renovation and decided to look for the DVD version on Amazon. The DVD arrived on Sat and I eagerly did the workout on Monday morning. I am Soooooooo happy to do this workout again; it is as good as I remember. It's not insanity or P90X (may even be a little old fashioned; no bells and whistles) but it's a great workout and makes me sweat. I love that the workout is a combination of cardio and sculpt and happy that Alley is the instructor, she is low key and not annoying. Don't be fooled by the fact that Alley (the instructor) is not stick skinny; it is a great workout and you will see results. I recommend using 8 and 5lb weights if you workout regularly; or no weights at all if you are a beginner (at least the first couple of weeks). Get the DVD; you won't be disappointed.",1438128000,3,924,4.167597765363128

1850593,5,B00008LDZU,"I'm not really one to write reviews for things, but I feel as though these workouts deserve recognition. My first experience with The Firm was a few years ago when I decided to buy and try the Transfirmer series of workouts. I wasn't necessarily a beginner at that time, but man..those workouts kicked my butt! I then ordered the previous body sculpting series videos to rotate to avoid boredom. I had great success with them but for whatever reason, I ended up joining a local gym and the The Firm videos/step began collecting dust. Fast forward to present, a husband and almost 2 year old daughter later, I decided I needed something that worked for me at home bc trying to coordinate a toddler to your desired gym schedule isn't necessarily the easiest task (not to mention wasting so much gas). It dawned on me to re-order some of The Firm workouts, new and older DVDs; no more driving 30 minutes to the gym for me! Let me tell you, as someone who is by no means a beginner when it comes to fitness, these workouts are no joke. I got a better workout with these DVDs than I did at any class or time on the treadmill/elliptical. I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone who wants to get in shape and get there FAST. I can tell a change in my body already-they promise results in 10 workouts, but you'll see it before then. Trust me. What's also great is that you can make them as easy or as challenging as you desire-increase or decrease your weight. Either way, you'll get a great workout!",1431993600,8,1486,4.427007299270073

But if you are, in fact, looking for strength training, don't waste your time on this - just get any of the Biggest Loser DVD's for that. So basically, this DVD doesn't really do anything for me, and the actual routines are boring as heck.

1850670,4,B00008LDZU,"I love this DVD and have used it a million times. Ali is fun and I really like how you utlizie the workout at so many fitness levels, either by following the simpler moves or by adding and increasing your weights. The workout is fun and has a good balance of cardio and strengh training/toning. I also like that it offers a good balance between working out your arms and legs. I feel that so many cardio workouts practically ignore the arms altogether. I did knock it down a star for a couple of reasons: there are a few rest and stretch segments that I don't really think are needed, they are pretty short so I can tolerate them and usually just do some over head presses or something as such to make the workout more efficient. Also I abhor floor routines and half of this is just that. As far a floor routines go this one is good, but I always skip it because I can't be bothered, too uncomfortable and too slow (not this workout just any/all floor routines IMO). What is good about this workout is they build up from the most basic version of a move the the advanced (still never too complicated) version. Once you build strength and have the routine down it's easy enough to move straight into the advanced move which often includes the arms and light weights so really amps up the workout. I suppose if I know on my own to just go ahead and do this it doesn't make a difference, but I wouldn't mind Ali saying something like ""if you already know what's next go ahead and get started"" or even have one of the girls start with the advanced move, it would make the workout more seemless, because sometime the count or the rhthym is a little different between the basic and advanced. This was the only workout I did for a year straight w/some walking/jogging days in between to mix it up. It got me in the best shape of my life and really made my thighs and butt look great (and my arms). I totally suggest it. If you don't have a step skip the fanny lifter and get the Transfirmer which is basically the Firm's version of an aerobic stepper, it will let you do more of their workouts. If you like this I would also recommend getting Supercharged Sculpting and Aerobic Body Shaping.

The 18"" step-ups are challenging and a bit hard on my knees (arthritis in both).  Sometimes I'll forego the weights or use only one of the two step segments with weights as a modification.

1850730,4,B00008LDZU,"This is a good one-hour FIRM workout that was the first release from ""The New FIRM"" (i.e., not made with Anna Benson onboard) back in 2002. I started with the Classic FIRMs back in 1996. I've had significant periods of no workouts since that time, but now I've been consistently working out again about 9 months. I consider myself high-intermediate at this point, just to share my own perspective. Many of the new FIRMS have been duds to me, but this one I bought a DVD copy of upon getting rid of my videotapes several years ago. It has some caveats that must be noted.

If you have knee, hip, or back issues and getting up and down off the floor is an issue for you, then this may not be the workout for you (at least not without modification). One thing that drove me nuts about many newer FIRM workouts was this element. I am used to (and prefer) workouts where you finish your standing aerobics and weight-training first, then move down to the floor to finish floorwork up one time. I hated the old Vol. 3 workout with Sandahl Bergman (1989) for this reason. I find this pointless, it can be hard on the joints, and it's not great for consistent heart rate (which is not going to kill me, but intervals where the heart rate jumps way up and way down repeatedly just annoy me).

Whether the sixty minutes put into this workout is maximized is debatable. I certainly do not feel it compares to the original FIRM Classics or Cross-Trainers in intensity (when they're done heavy) or comprehensibility, but since this is a fun workout to me, I tolerate that. Other exercisers may feel this workout doesn't deserve a place in their rotation. For example, there are no specific floor exercises for the inner thigh, only some tablework and outer thigh leg lifts. If they weren't a problem area for me AND if this wasn't already an hour-long workout, I'd be less annoyed with that fact. If I put in an hour to a total-body workout, I'd like every body part hit once at least. If you're expecting a workout that will work you like Susan Harris' old Vol. 1 (Body Sculpting Basics) workout, look elsewhere. Even if you heavy up, that's not going to happen here.

The cardio, for all but beginners or low-intermediates, will need to be modified by adding in more jumps or upping the step height from one instructors use during step aerobics. Similarly, beginners or the very overweight will need to modify DOWN on step heights (both during cardio and the leg press), or eliminate the step entirely during step aerobics. I know it's tempting to overdo, but some beginners need to drop down to a 6-inch step for even the leg press exercise! I doubt that any FIRM instructor would admit this, but it's simply the truth. An exerciser who is 250 lbs. and has very little aerobic endurance or leg strength from years of inactivity is probably not going to do a leg press on an 8-inch step with good form, let alone the 14-inch. Realistically, the 14-inch step is not the ideal height for everyone...even some advanced exercisers. Use the height that you can perform ALL of the reps on with flawless form. Beginners may need to slow down the leg press or other exercisers to maintain perfect form. These workouts were crafted for high-intermediate maximum, not advanced exercisers (IMHO), even with heavier weights.

The lead instructor and four other cast members are hit-or-miss. Cuing is a tad annoying, as it's being done on the count of the move, not beforehand. I'm used to this because it's a bad habit of The FIRM's, but I admit it can get on my nerves as I get more advanced and want to focus on myself and not on having to look at the instructor constantly for cues because I can't rely on her verbal instruction. Only Jen Carmen looked as though she was putting in some effort and really strived during this workout, particularly considering these were all long-time FIRM instructors with a high level of fitness. Honestly, the others looked too ""pretty"" and were phoning it in. I understand not wanting to intimidate your audience (or needing to keep weights a bit lighter to handle a long day of filming) but these are advanced-level exercisers. Let Libby in the back be un-intimidating through using low step heights and weights, and show an instructor or two up front maxing out! I've been exercising a long time, and I can tell you that an instructor will make or break your workout motivation. A highly motivated instructor that's pushing themselves can make you want to push yourself in a good way, too! Since you have to get to failure on sets to see max results after you've gotten past the initial exercise break-in period for beginners, I'm disappointed that the instructors here just do not educate about the need to heavy up (at least periodically). I have to remind myself a lot during this workout, ""Work out harder than Allie does here"" because it gets all-too-tempting to want to coast through a workout. Even though I'm nowhere near what I would consider to be an advanced exerciser (like people who regularly do Cathe Friedrich would be, something I aspire to!), I use far heavier weights than even Jen Carmen does in this workout. I use a 25-lb. dumbbell on lat rows, for instance, while Allie is using an 8-lb. dumbbell! I want to finish my workout with weights drenched and a bit tired, not looking flawless and working about as hard as if I was washing a few dishes!

I also feel a few more form pointers a la Tracie Long or Susan Harris could have been thrown in here. I realize that beginners may not catch all of those pointers, certainly not in the beginner, but teaching proper form is imperative. Telling exercisers what muscles to utilize, how to engage the glutes and pelvis (anterior tilt vs. posterior tilt) and so on will make the moves safer, more effective, and allow for better results through an increased range-of-motion. Perhaps Allie Del Rio wasn't aware of all of these pointers herself, and if so, maybe I'm being a bit unfair. However, I believe knowing how to fully utilize the powerful muscles within the mid-body should be a prerequisite of anyone teaching weight-training workouts to the masses. As proper gluteal and pelvic positioning can be the difference between powerfully-initiated jumps, step work, squats, lunges, leg presses, and floorwork OR lesser versions of these powerhouse exercises that could end up injuring a person or at least seriously limiting their results, I believe it's pretty imperative to teach this correctly.

I'm glad that the old FIRM workouts are on DVD, but I do enjoy this one for a break from that workout style on occasion. I recommend this workout IF you go out on your own and learn all you can about proper weight-training form (Bret Contreras' teaching on the power of glutes are a fabulous start!), keeping in mind that this isn't the only weight workout you'll ever need. This workout is feminine, fun and empowering, it's challenging but doable, and helps get the journey with fitness started.",1280448000,,6980,4.698529411764706

1850734,4,B00008LDZU,"The Firm Body Sculpting System 2 was the first home workout system I ever tried when I committed to changing my body.  It jump-started my fitness when I was 85 pounds overweight and continued to shape my body.  Cardio Sculpt was my favorite in the series and the one I used for my cardio and strength training.  Throughout my weight loss, this workout remained challenging and the movements got results, especially in my legs and rear.  I dripped sweat doing this workout and I would be sore for 1 day afterward or longer.  I definitely recommend listening to your body if something doesn't feel right and modifying the movements to avoid injury, though, especially if you have pre-existing soft tissue injuries.  You don't have to use weights if they impair your form or are too much for you at first.  I did end up losing the 85 pounds through the use of Cardio Sculpt, walking, and eating less.  Cardio Sculpt was my go-to workout for results I could see.  I don't see it as a beginner's video since the use of weights adds more challenge to any fitness level and it has remained effective even at a healthy weight.  It can take a while to learn the routine enough to switch movements and disassemble/assemble the Fanny Lifter while keeping up with the workout.  Cardio Sculpt is definitely one of my favorites produced by the Firm.  This workout can kick your butt, but it's worth it.",1246233600,7,1388,4.6204081632653065

1850736,5,B00008LDZU,"I have this workout along with 2 others that I bought as a set with the fanny lifters. I bought it back in 2002 and I don't think I used it more than once then (guess I wasn't serious enough about weight loss then) and then I used it briefly again in 2003 (after losing 50lbs by doing weight watchers and just walking) in hopes of maintaining my then-healthy weight and like someone else said, I was in serious pain in between the first few workouts. After the first time I could hardly even walk for days. Obviously each time got better, but even then I didn't stick with it. Now, all of the sudden as I reach higher into my 20's, nearing 30 my husband has convinced me that with all my family health issues I should think about taking better care of myself. I got an aerobic dancing dvd hoping fun would motivate me more- nope. That just made me feel silly. Then I remembered the firm, I dug out the fanny lifter from the garage and got to it. This workout makes me feel so amazing. It's really hardcore so that I feel proud and accomplished when I finish (I can't even finish the whole 60 minutes yet, today I made it to 50), and best of all- IT'S FUN! Just when you get so tired you can't go on with what you're doing or you get sick of a certain move, you move on to something completely different. It mixes it up perfectly. Even the warm up gets your heart pumping and your sports bra quickly starts getting damp from there on :) I highly recommend the firm and once I'm comfortable with this whole dvd I'll probably purchase another from The Firm.

Wow, that was way longer of a review than I intended on writing but long story short, if you're looking for a good hard work out look no further.

I really feel that the workout targets all of the problem areas (for me)-- arm flab, thighs, etc. Plus, I enjoy the cardio segments, especially the one with the Samba music.

My only complaint, and I believe that this was addressed by another reviewer, is that the DVD has no menu and you cannot skip or reverse to a different segment. Sometimes I want a modified (30 minute workout) and I'd like to not have to fast forward the same way that I did with the VHS. I'm sure they've (the FIRM) remedied this with their current DVDs.

She WILL say things like, ""This is a long set, so stay with me here,"" which I personally don't like because I hate hearing that it's a long set - but when you actually get right down to it, each set is not that long.  Each set is relatively short (maybe twelve or sixteen reps total) but then the workout spirals back to the same muscle group eventually, so you get enough reps without burning out.  Her cardio moves are fun and easy to learn, and she gives verbal cues with good timing so you don't get lost.  I agree with other reviewers that this is more of a moderate toning tape with some cardio thrown in, but it does make me break a sweat and I feel that good burn all over when I'm done.  I actually look forward to doing this workout, and I don't even mind that it's close to an hour long.  I look forward to any future FIRM DVD's that Allie comes out with - she's a great instructor.",1177286400,19,1311,4.166666666666667

I also really like that she walks you through warm-up and cool-down activities.  And best of all?  I can see the results, I feel better, and actually find that I have more energy!!",1173312000,7,318,4.338983050847458
1850754,5,B00008LDZU,allie is awesome.  she works you in this workout.  it's exactly what the title says.  sculpting for a few minutes and then cardio off and on.  allie always has a bit of more 'dance' in her cardio moves - which i prefer.  she's always been a favorite of mine and doesn't disapoint me here.,1173139200,4,288,4.2592592592592595
1850755,3,B00008LDZU,"I am a former Jazzercise student so I am use to challenging routines and heart pumping classes.

That's not this tape.

However, if you are new to exercise, just getting back to exercise after childbirth or illness, or if you just want a mild exercise tape to workout between heavy workout days, this could be a good choice for you!

The choreography is clear and easy to follow.  The instructor covers upper body, lower body and abs, with good stretching.  There is some cardio interspersed, but it's mainly a toning tape in my opinion.

I found the pace kind of slow and the tape seemed long.  I wouldn't recommend it as a challenging cardio workout, but for something to do when I want to bring the intensity down this is fine.",1172275200,7,730,4.526717557251908

1850757,5,B00008LDZU,"I have been using this video on and off for a number of years and love everything about it.  I don't get to use it as often as I would like to (it's long - just under an hour, and I have a baby at home!), but each and every time, I work my muscles in great ways.  I never feel stronger than when I do this workout and Allie is my favorite instructor.  I highly recommend this for anyone beginner through advanced.  With the ability to increase and decrease the weights you use, this video can sit on your shelf forever and through all of your fitness levels!  I recently started working out heavily with the Firm after a brief hiatus and after a week (only 4 workouts), my hips are down an inch, and my waist is down a 1/2"".  Not bad!  I used this video with my new TransFirmer and had no problem adapting the exercises for the Fanny Lifter at all.

Oh - and to the people who might not feel that Allie is fit enough - ARE YOU CRAZY??  She has a great body - and has achieved the same results that most women would if they have an agressive exercise program.  She is not a stick figure.  She has curves and looks amazing.",1143417600,43,1121,4.073059360730594

Perhaps Ms DelRio is not quite as toned as one would hope..I don't know. At one point she has her eyes shut while she squats. I have dozens of Firms and some with this instructor, that I like. It seems that most Firm videos have a way of tricking you into working out hard before you know it, but this one falls short in some indescribable way.",1120608000,5,465,4.235955056179775
1850760,4,B00008LDZU,"Don't be fooled by the title, this is a strength workout with cardio portions mixed in.  Though with this workout lighter weights may be used for some of the exercises which are more compound movements where you are working upper and lower body at the same time, such as lunges with bicep curls and plie squats with shoulder raises.  This would classify as more of an aerobic weight training workout, though there are some strictly weight training exercises as well.  Upper and lower body is covered well, plus there is some ab work at the end.  In between the strength segments, there are 3 cardio portions, one of them is low impact, and the other 2 use a step, the last one using very light weights.

Allie Del Rio leads this workout along with 4 fellow Firm Master Instructors including Libby who demonstrates beginning modifications.  She does a nice job here, very pleasant and encouraging.  You will need a Fanny Lifter or stool and assorted dumbells, this would be a good workout if you are not up for a heavy lifting day.",1110067200,30,1030,4.626373626373627
1850761,3,B00008LDZU,"I am definitely a fan of the FIRM video workout series, but this one doesn't do much for me for several reasons--first, I miss the nice sets with the rugs and artwork and marble busts in the background. Now it just looks so sterile and ordinary. As for the workout, the toning moves are effective and purposeful, but for some reason they're stretching after almost every toning segment. I just don't need all that stretching interspersed throughout my workout. It seemed like the workout was geared more towards beginners who are trying to avoid injuries. So I either fast-forward or just wait for them to finish. Kind of annoying. I haven't suffered any injuries from failing to do all those stretches. Thirdly, I was annoyed by the instructor constantly reminding me that ""this is a long segment"" or ""this is gonna get tougher and tougher"". Is that supposed to help me stick with the routine? And finally, I hate the abs section of this video. The moves are really awkward and caused me to have neck cramps. So I usually skip it and stick with the awesome abs video that came with this 3 pack series. Anyway, you'll get a good workout from this video for sure, but it's not comparable to what the FIRM used to be.",1105747200,3,1215,4.577981651376147

The warm-up will get your heart pumping in a hurry. The instructor, Allie, cues impeccably and all of the people working out in the video are inspiring. The cardios moves on the 6"" segment of the Fanny Lifter are especially fun. My only criticism is that there is not enough cardio emphasis in this ""cardio sculpt"" video.",1099785600,9,432,4.6103896103896105

I must said though I love the Firm....however, I also discovered that Anna Benson has a new line call PrimeFit...I may check out those videos too since I don't seem to catch up with ""The Firm"" accesories.... now there is a new Fanny Lifter....I won't be buying that.",1098921600,,623,4.612612612612613
1850764,5,B00008LDZU,"This is one of my all-time favorite The Firm tapes. It is a great combination of cardio and strength. The time flys when I'm doing this tape.

I read the reviewer that said that these reviews were not by 'real' people. I'm very real and in NO WAY connected to the Firm company or any of it's affiliates.(sounds like legalize, but it's true). I discovered the Firm a couple years ago and discovered that even though I thought I was in good shape, I was wrong. Firm tapes really put you through the paces. If you really do the tapes and stick with them, you WILL get stronger and feel better. I didn't loose a ton of weight, but I DID get fit enough to be able to do a triathlon this last summer.

I've been doing workouts since before we had VHS tapes (I used audio tapes that came with a poster that showed the moves). I've tried just about every exercise instructor out there. They all have good and bad and so does The Firm. But, all in all, I have to say that the Firm workouts are the hardest, safest, most effective, and most fun I've ever done.",1098057600,10,1050,4.218905472636816
1850765,5,B00008LDZU,"first of all i'm a 100% authentic firm customer and i have been since 1998 and i resent the person that said these reviews were fake. i don't waste my time or others commenting on these DVDS to be fake, i do it cause i believe in this program!! doing these enjoyable but aerobic interval weight training workouts altho has been the toughest thing i have done and i feel complaining muscles everyday. the firm has toned my body head to toe twice twice because i was sick for 6 months and by the time i regained my health i gained the weight i had lost the first time back. but i've used this firm system to lose almost all of it now. i have a size to go. and it took me 8 months. but i've watched myself tone up.  i highly recommend the Firm. even if you are a beginner like i was you can still do lighter weights and not do the whole DVD just a mix of segments working the major body parts and work up to them all like i have. you will feel stronger and happier that you commited yourself to do something good for yourself. and it IS a commitment. sure there are  exercise days i don't feel like doing it.. but i do cause its a commitment i intend to keep. and you will tone on this program. at first you don't think you are, but stick with it. you are worth having the best body you can and enjoy your success.  i'm not ever going to be petite or thin, but i'm working on the best body i've been given in this life and the firm helps that with good advice and fun workouts no matter what your body type is.

now on to my review of Cardio Sculpt which i just purchased and worked out to. excellent mix of fun cardio and weights. Allie Del rio is a fun informative instructor see also her other cardio DVD Maximum Cardio Burn plus Abs for a great cardio workout. This workout has more of the weight based body sculpting i like. but i can't deny that Allie's cardio videos are the few i really like and look forward to doing and are such fun and motivating but complete workouts i'm glad i went outside my usual weight training buys and got something different. i hope this review helps the true exercisers out there.

Luckily the newer generation of Firm tapes don't hurt my back and still give me an effective workout.  This one is not my favorite, but still a decent workout.  Allie has always been one of my favorite instructors.  It's an effective blend of cardio and weights.  The only part I really don't like is one move used in this tape and the Body Sculpt tape where you lay on your stomach over the fanny lifter and lift weights in a v-motion, it's an uncomfortable exercise.  Otherwise a good, effective workout.  BTW, using a regular height step just does not compare to the intensity that the fanny lifter adds.  Recommend getting the fanny lifter, it definitely made a difference in my thigh and butt.",1087948800,4,842,4.457516339869281

I haven't worked out in a little over a year and found this tape fun and a little challenging(especially the floor exercises)My outer thighs were burning. I think there should me more cardio, I'm used to my tae bo where I'm trying to catch my breath..(update)Ok, so after 2 weeks 3x a week I am definately noticing a difference. My legs are slimmer and I'm not sure why but the second time I used the tape it seemed a lot harder. I was actually a little out of breath at one point.

After about 4 weeks,  believe it or not, I lost 12 pounds and went down 2 sizes. No special dieting, no Atkins, South Beach and the rest. Just healthy eating and this tape 4 times a week.

I was mortified and devastated looking at myself on that picture, and I decided to start the DVD right after the Thanksgiving holiday. Well, you know how it is when you're trying to lose weight. It never goes fast enough (when you're doing it the healthy way) so I decided I would NOT weigh myself.  I went home again for MLK weekend and my family was like, Oh my God you lost weight. How much have you lost? I was glad they noticed, because I wasn't sure that Id lost enough for them to see. I was curious but I still didn't weigh. I was too afraid of getting discouraged. I had a doctors appointment about a week later and it was there I discovered Id lost 36lbs!!!! THIRTY SIX. From Thanksgiving to basically MLK. Now, I was about 100lbs overweight when I started. But learning that Id lost almost 40 in that short space just following their eating tips and rotation calendar was amazing. You really DO see results in about 10 workouts. For me, being non-athletic and heavy, it was a hard workout. But not P90 hard. Its actually doable. And, so worth it. I kept at it and took off 77lbs in about 6 or 7 months. This was 2004. If you have weight to lose and want it gone fast, and you're willing to put in some blood, sweat, and tears (or at least sweat, LOL...and maybe a few tears) this is THE workout for gaining strength and losing weight quickly (you have to eat well too, not perfect but cut the crap, mostly).  It took me over two weeks just to get through the warmup without stopping. The rotation calendar calls for you to workout about two to three times a week at first, then three to four after a couple weeks. I usually worked out three.",1517702400,,1819,4.347058823529411

7985244,5,B00008LDZU,"The FIRM has been around since the mid-80s and truly were the trailblazers of the cardio WITH weight-training movement. Our modern workouts almost always have a weight-training component to them, but they didn't always. The FIRM has also changed hands over the years as they competed to stay interesting and relevant. This FIRM series called ""Body Sculpting System"" (BSS) was developed to continue their commitment to body sculpting through weights, but it is in a way ""easier"" than their earlier workouts. By no means is this series ineffective. In fact, all their workouts can be tailored for an advanced user through the use of increased weights. I think the moves in this series were selected specifically to be easier on the joints. The cardio in this video is lower impact. It's now known that higher impact isn't necessarily better (and definitely not better if you have weak/bad knees or back). If you want to ramp up intensity, you certainly can! The instructors in this series are long time master instructors of the Firm, so for many they are welcome familiar faces. More importantly, they guide the user well with perfectly timed cueing. You will most certainly sweat with this video! With this series you will need a set of dumbbells (3-15 lbs. most beginners don't use weights at first, intermediates 3-5 lbs. and advanced 8-15 lbs.) and you will need their ""Fanny Lifter"" if you do not have a Fanny Lifter, any other aerobic step (preferably with a short and stackable taller segment) will do.
