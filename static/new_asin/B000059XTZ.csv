1409918,2,B000059XTZ,"This is my least favorite disc to hit from the final frontier. And is at best a formality for me as a collector of the Star Trek DVDs. Once again there are no xtras to be had of any value but thats not really the problem for you see my dear reader I am used to that, what I'm not used to is 2 duds on one disc (OK, one dud and one NEAR dud).
Mudd: 1 star: Actually both of the scripts of these episodes seem similar in that the Kirk and Spock I know would not have the conversations they have here outside of these episodes; very surreal; similiar to the animated series. Harry Mudds character is not funny. And for a comedic role that doesn't bode well. I find the android story to be laughable (not to mention predictable), and for all the characters to bring back (Miri?), Mudd should not have been it.
Trouble W/Tribbles: 2 1/2 Stars: I can hear the yelling from here; THIS IS A CLASSIC! In my opinion this is far from a classic. I find Captain Koloth to be a poor xcuse for a Klingon (As the Squire he was dashing, however) and Cyrano Jones to almost be a nuisance. This show does have one redeeming value, Mr. Scott. The exchange with the Klingon in the bar is gold, as is his ""reason"" for starting the fight. I find most of the moments with the Tribbles themselves to be unbelieveable. I do not believe Kirk would have permitted them to be scattered all about the bridge, silly.
I do STILL have to reccommend this disc. After all this is Classic Trek, even if this disc is less ""classic"" than others. Besides where else can you get Star Trek from 1967 in Dolby Digital 5.1?",988848000,3,1580,4.217821782178218
1409919,5,B000059XTZ,"Volume 21 of Paramount's DVD release of Classic Trek features two popular episodes which emphasise humor over drama, both of which make excellent use of the supporting cast.
""I, Mudd"" features Roger C. Carmel, reprising his role as Harry Mudd from the first season episode ""Mudd's Women.""  Carmel plays the role more broadly here than in the earlier story, but that's appropriate given the more comedic writing in the script.  This episode features another instance of Kirk (with the help of the crew) using logic/illogic to destroy a computer brain.  William Shatner and the supporting cast members at times appear as if they're a zany cross between a Vaudeville troupe and Improv theatre.
""The Trouble with Tribbles"" needs no introduction.  This episode has consistently topped Trekker's lists of all-time favorite episodes.  The gentle humor here is in contrast to the more slapstick approach of ""I, Mudd.""  This story was revisited in Deep Space Nine's 1996 episode ""Trials and Tribble-ations.""  Hopefully, that installment will be available on DVD soon.  Again, the supporting cast is used more fully here than in most episodes.
Both of these storylines were also revisited in the animated Star Trek series (""Mudd's Passion,"" and ""More Tribbles, More Troubles"").  Hopefully, these will be made available on DVD as well.
Paramount has done a good job of resorting the picture and sound here.  There are several opticals of the Enterprise and Space Station K-7 filmed specially for this episode.  The clarity of these newer shots contrasts with stock footage of the Enterprise, which is considerably grainer.",988243200,7,1611,5.229571984435798
1409920,5,B000059XTZ,"Both of the episodes on this DVD are among the most humorous from the original 79 episodes of the original Star Trek series.  Roger Carmel as ""Mudd"" is the classic con artist and charleton.  In ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" we find out about yet another ""entrepeneur"", Cyrano Jones, who unleases the adorable, yet highly prolific tribbles upon Deep Space Station K-7 and the Enterprise!  Both of these episodes are fun to watch even if you are not a Star Trek fan.  The humor in them is timeless, and the legacy of these is everlasting.  A keeper for the Trekker, or non-Trekker alike!",982886400,9,583,4.676470588235294

1409923,5,B000059XTZ,i think this one gives insight into how technical advancements can almost suddenly transform into our keepers instead of the other way around. These androids begin to study humans in a cold dispassionate way and determine to become the overlords of the galaxy. This giving them the authority to decide what they consider best for all of us but they do come to be deposed and disabled from this by their weakness discovered by their inability to understand illogic. It's a fun take on the monsters that humanity creates and the ethical considerations that must be seen.,1398470400,,568,4.865979381443299

1409931,5,B000059XTZ,"The first best DVD is the one with ""Shore Leave"" and ""The Squire of Gothos"" on it. Ironically, the guy who played 'The Squire' in that fine episode, also plays THE VERY FIRST KLINGON that we ever see in ""The Trouble with Tribbles""! William Campbell, as Captain Koloth, defined for us what Klingons were all about.

I have known Bill Campbell for many years and he always felt it was important to point out to fans, ""I was a Klingon before they acquired the 'nodules' on their foreheads."" As far as I can ascertain, Bill also held one other unique position in regard to Star Trek -- he was the only returning major actor to the series who ever played two different roles (unlike Roger C. Carmel who played Harry Mudd in multiple episodes).

In ""The Trouble with Tribbles,"" Kirk runs into big diplomatic problems with the Klingons and with The Federation's own Administrator. Klingon agents are also wreaking havoc. And then those dang, incredibly prolific Tribbles are found eating up the Enterprise's precious grain cargo, the Quadrotriticale (the scientific name for common wheat is Triticum aestivum). But the Tribbles might just be the answer to the whole mess...

All the ""Harcourt Fenton 'Harry' Mudd"" entries are just great, and that's a second episode on this particular DVD.

A steal for Original Series Star Trek fans!",1199836800,,1327,4.8584070796460175
1409932,4,B000059XTZ,"In 'I Mudd' once again the crew is captured or the Enterprise taken over. In this case the crew is captured with the goal of taking over the Enterprise.

While another comedy episode 'A Piece of the Action' is my favorite episode, for many fans 'The Trouble with Tribbles' is a favorite. An episode of Deep Space 9 had the crew go back in time and actually participate in the episode. The images of the crew of Deep Space 9 are superimposed on this original footage. There are Klingons in The Trouble with Tribbles, but the scenes with Klingons aren't just funny, they are especially funny. This is a fun, light-hearted, comedy episode. And there's some kind of trouble with Tribbles. . .",1170720000,,688,4.59349593495935
1409933,5,B000059XTZ,"If you are picking which volumes to collect, this falls in between the ""must have"" and ""good to have"" categories.  An aspect of Classic Trek that is much beloved and sometimes overlooked is the humour that appears in many episodes in various doses but never in the quantities that we get on these two episodes although the second one is far, far better than the first.

On the first episode, we get that irritating character Harry Mudd again this time as a virtual slave of androids no less.  The plot is very similar to a first season episode and just like in that episode, the manner in which Kirk so easily outwits the androids and the overall storyline leaves much to be desired and places this as an average episode at best.

The second episode is a must have in any TOS collection though.  ""The Trouble with Tribbles"" has gone down as one of the best and favourite episodes in the history of Trekdom.  It has even an episode paid in tribute to it on Deep Space 9 which is also a classic.  The overall plot, timing, acting and extremely humourous storyline makes this an episode that I find myself able to watch over and over again without getting tired as each time, I seem to catch another comedic gem that I seemed to have missed the previous time.  Who can forget the scene in which Scotty confesses to starting the brawl with the Klingons for example which is my favourite.  This among many other scenes make this the most lovable TOS episode for me and I'm pretty sure you'll like it as well.

Recommended.",1162252800,,1517,4.483636363636363
1409934,4,B000059XTZ,"Time has not always been kind to the original Star Trek, certainly not in light of its special effects or sometimes labored drama. But as camp, some episodes still work, and in this DVD we have two of the most indomitably comic.

""The Trouble with Tribbles"" is deservedly well known for its writing and comic aspects. Even those who thought William Shatner a bit insufferable will take pleasure in seeing him tormented by sneering Klingons and prissy Federation bureaucrats, and, in the climax, subjected to a shower of tribbles when he opens a cargo bin over his head. (Apparently the cargo sequence took several re-takes, so his put-upon look is probably quite real). Nichelle Nichols, as Uhura, gets a role in which she finally does something besides open a hailing frequency, we get treated to a Klingon imitating Scotty's Scots accent, and Scotty gets to brawl instead of fix things -- the scene afterward where Kirk has to discipline him is one of the more touching moments in the first series.

""I, Mudd,"" of course, is Monty Python meets Falstaff, as other reviewers have noted. Leonard Nimoy gets a John Cleese kind of turn as a not-so-straight man (""I fail to see why I should induce my mother to purchase falsified patents,"" in an icily comic tone). Roger C. Carmel gets the role of a lifetime in Harcourt Fenton Mudd, exceeded only by the actress playing his android wife Stella Dear. Scotty and Dr. McCoy do a rather jaw-dropping duet. And Walter (Chekhov) Koenig gets to perform Gene Roddenberry's underrated choreography.

Worth it.",1151884800,2,1547,4.8745247148288975
1409935,5,B000059XTZ,These two Star Trek episodes where most likely two of the best ever made. The cast was fantastic and really made there characters shine!!! This is some really enjoyable viewing and will cause fits of uncontrollable laughter. AND... Chekov is really awesome in these two (I love him! :-) LOL)!!! Enjoy!,1104796800,,301,4.921568627450981
1409936,5,B000059XTZ,"Volume 21 contains two classics from the original series that showcase the lighter side of the Star Trek universe.  Both however are excellent classics.
I, MUDD features the return of space rougue Harry Mudd to the Trek universe.  Kirk meets up with his old nemesis on an unknown planet when taken their by androids.  On the planet thousands of androids do Mudd's every bidding however they won't allow him to leave!  So Mudd lured the crew to the planet by placing an android on the Enterprise however the androids refuse to let Mudd leave even after the crew is trapped.  Therefore it's up to the crew to team up with Mudd and blow the androids minds with illogical behaviour.  This episode is definetly one of Star Trek's funnier moments.  The whole acting illogical bit has to been seen to be believed especailly Spock's bit.  Roger C Carmel does a great job as Mudd.  I love the bit with his wife Stella it's hilarious.  I, MUDD is a quirky yet comical outing for the crew of the Enterprise and it's one of season two's most beloved episodes.
THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES needs no introduction.  It is an undisputed classic and by far the funniest Star Trek episode around.  When the crew arrives at Space Station K7 to find out that Kirk's job is to watch over ""wheat"", things begin to get hairy especially when Cyrano Jones shows up with a handful of fluff balls known as tribbles that reproduce like mad and eat everything.  And when you add Klingons to the mess you have Cpt. Kirk having a tough day.  This episode is quite entertaining and really lives up to it's reputation as being a classic.  The cast was really good in this especially Kirk, Scotty, Chekov, and Uhura.  The supporting cast was great too.  I always liked William Campbell's (the Squire of Gothos) klingon Cpt. Koloth.  I thought he did a good job.  Some scenes here are great especially the bar room fight between the crew men and the klingons.  THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES is one of my favourite Star Trek episodes ever and it is a true classic.
Overall I highly recommend this DVD maybe even more so than the others.  It contains to classics from the second season.  I,MUDD is great but THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES sells this baby!  Highly recommeded!",1033776000,6,2226,4.608142493638677
1409937,5,B000059XTZ,"Neither of these episodes could be taken seriously if your life depended on it, and they know it.  They're just pure fun.
""Tribbles"" must have been a working vacation idea for the cast, who get to spread their comic wings for a change  -  and pretty well, at that.  Shatner has always had a flair for comedy, and does a fine job here.  Leonard Nimoy was always a natural straight-man, and very funny whenever he got to display offense at injured pride  -  his best moment in this one is being caught responding to the cuddly loveableness of the furry little title beasties.  James Doohan also proves to have a fine flair for the funny, and gets ample opportunity to prove it, upholding the fine honor of Starfleet to Klingon barbarians in a bar-fight, and greater pride in the honor of the Enterprise, itself  -  at Captain Kirk's expense.  The always entertaining William Campbell, seen in the title role of ""The Squire of Gothos"" the preceding season, guest stars here as a snidely prissy Klingon, and Stanley Adams is more enjoyable than usual in his standard fat Falstaffian fool/con man role.
""I, Mudd"" finds the Enterprise again encountering another con-man of its past acquaintance, Harcourt ""Harry"" Fenton Mudd, who is even more Falstaffian than Stanley Adams.  Harry's gotten himself made into a king  -  on a planet he can't leave!  The inhabitants are all directionless androids, built long ago to serve their makers, who fled millennia ago after discovering paradise wasn't all it was cracked up to be.  Harry's enjoyed the endless schmorgasbord of brothel delights the mechanical lassies among them have to offer, but is restless to con and swindle his way across the galaxy again.  In an effort to escape, he has the androids' leader, Norman, hijack the Enterprise to his planet, planning to give its crew to the androids in place of himself  -  but the androids plan to keep Harry, too, and additionally to use the Enterprise to go about the solar systems looking for other races they might ""help.""  How does one beat such ruthless machine logic?  Why, by a pure assault on reason, of course, which manifests itself in Monty Python-ish silliness, that is highly entertaining to watch.
""I, Mudd"" benefits from the clever casting of sexy twins Alyce and Rhae Andryce as same-model identical androids, enabling them to double and triple for each other in convincing fashion.  The set design is minimalist and effective.  A very funny cameo appearance by the shrewish harridan Mrs. Harry Mudd is worth the price of admission, alone.",1027987200,14,2543,4.862790697674418
1409938,5,B000059XTZ,"What can be said about these epsiodes that already hasn't been said before. The energy and comedy of the original cast and the comic timing of Shatner, Nimoy and Kelly are incredible.
I MUDD: This is a great showcase for the late Roger C Carmel. He was wonderful in playing the character Harcord ""Harry"" Fenton Mudd, that this was the one episode they wrote for him after his other stellar performance in MUDD WOMEN. Funny and excellent example of how Star Trek can take a serious subject and make it entertaining and funny.
THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES: Simply - David Gerold at his very best. Filled with Tribbles, Klingons and attitude this romp to save ""Wheat"" is histerical. William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy shine in this one too!. William Campbell comes back (He was Trelane in THE SQUIRE OF GOTHOS in an earlier epsiode) but this time as the Klingon Captain to yet again be at odds with Captain Kirk.
All the supporting cast get their shinging moments in each film. Espeically, Chekova nd Uhura. (Koenig and Nichols)

1409939,5,B000059XTZ,"These two episodes are probably the funniest and most light-hearted of the original Star Trek show.  The Harry Mudd episode really gets wild when Kirk and his crew act totally crazy to befuddle the androids holding them hostage.  Scotty's ""death"" scene is also hilarious.  Trouble with Tribbles is even funnier.  One scene has a drunken klingon insulting the Enterprise space ship, much to Scott's fury.  This klingon also refers to Capt. Kirk as a ""tin plated, overbearing dictator with delusions of godhood"" and ""a Denebian Slime Devil.""  All this leads to a wild bar fight.",1010793600,,576,5.010526315789473
