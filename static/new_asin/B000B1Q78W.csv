2399398,5,B000B1Q78W,"This is one of the many movies that scared me when I was growing up and another in a long line of movies that I have looked for to see and own in my attempt to have a second childhood.

  This one isn't gory or even well acted(it has the look of a low budget or even a student movie. It was written and directed by John Newland of ""One Step Beyond"" fame and claims to be based on ""true stories"". Perhaps because of the low budget and imperfections in the film stock, this is one eerie little movie. It kept me up late with the lights on long after it ended as a 10 year old!

  The movie tells three ""True Tales"" of trips into the supernatural. In the first, a prank leads to the death of a young man and his mother puts a curse on the boys responsable and they find out that the number 7 isn't always lucky. The second tale takes place at the turn of the century, and tells of a hole that opens in the earth around a farming town. Terrible smells and awful sounds emerge from it and against sound judgement one family man goes down to retrieve what sounds like a family dog,with very unexpected results. The third tale is about a couple who pick up a girl hitchhiking home and what happens when she gets there.

  Like I said this isn't a great film but it does what it sets out to do, which is give you a cold chill up the spine. The transfer is not the best but that is part of what makes this one so creepy. Worth a look",1178582400,2,1424,4.003533568904594

8081292,5,B000B1Q78W,This was a very interesting VHS of a movie I hadn't seen in years.  I am very pleased with it.,1420588800,,94,3.7
8081293,4,B000B1Q78W,I saw this in the theater with my sister when I was a young boy.  I never forgot the scene where the father is lowered into the hole in the ground and comes out terrified and crazy.  Can't wait to get this on DVD so I can see it again over 40 years after seeing it in the theater.,1403654400,,280,3.7288135593220337
8081294,4,B000B1Q78W,"This is more a acted out documentary than a horror movie. Rod Serling narrates but is not in the movie.
The stories are based on true stories and pretty interesting. The acting is okay no big stars but it's not
bad just like a cheap made movie. If your like Twilight Zone don't expect that but it is a lot like Night
Gallery the other great Rod Serling tv series which is finally out now! If these had been made for that
show they would've been really good but here they were at least worth adding to my Serling collection.",1386374400,,523,4.24
8081295,3,B000B1Q78W,"This movie has 3 stories which could have been very good. Unfortunately they were not, and I hate to be the one acting like a wet blanket. The excellent quality of Rod Sterling's works like Night Gallery and Twilight Zone is why I wanted to see and have this movie. I was deeply disappointed because the movies was like a low budget film with bad lighting and stiff acting, terrible camera angles and sound. I was waiting for this to come out on DVD and only had the option of VHS so I bought it. This should stay on the VHS shelf. Highly disappointed.",1293408000,,552,4.3173076923076925
8081296,5,B000B1Q78W,"I saw this many years ago andhave it on VHS.  I was looking for a DVD version and am glad it exists.
  This is a 3 part story with 3, as Serling's usual, great stories.  The first still haun ts me when I think of the woman's eyes.  She curses the kids who sent her son to his death on a prank.  These guys die and the story is told from one of the boys on a flight telling a priest.  The second is about a pit a guy goes down into , to get his son's dog and comes up insane.  The third is  based oin many storiesa of the paranpormal , the LAdy On The Birdge.  It is based on things like ""Resurection MAry"" from Chicago of a girl who died and is trying to get back home.  Thinking bout the 1st and third story bring goose bumps.
  Anyone with any paranormal inkling will love this DVD.  It is not a high tech production and could have been better made but the story far surpasses the quality of the production.  Any of the stories could have come from Twilight Zone or Night Gallery and would have had a geat intro and talking outtro.
  I am glad they are still available",1248652800,3,1070,3.9716981132075473
8081297,5,B000B1Q78W,"The Hell Pit

Young lads dog falls into a mysterious hole - that has hellish moans and groans - the hole becomes the talk of the town ( IE becomes the other hole ) - the kids father and some local townmen from the local wateringhole set out to retrieve the dog. The kids father is lowered into the hole, which at this time begins emitting groaning, moaning, roaring sounds, the old man starts screaming & the townsmen quickly pull him back up where his eyes are white and he runs away like a stark raving looney - If you have ever been in the south you know about these cavern entrances that have wind howling in them that can be mistaken for groans - this short story scared the hell out of me and made a mental impression that I never forgot .. the cinimaphotography used here was very effective ...",1223769600,,801,4.269736842105263
8081298,5,B000B1Q78W,"In the latter years of his career, Rod Serling began doing documentaries such as this one.  This and the other documentaries are on youtube.  Horror movies and documentaries seem incapable of embellishing their themes with an eerie mood or sense of horror.  It is as if all current writers are completely lacking in imagination.  The best of the stories is the one about the hole in the ground in Southern Missouri.  It's quite spooky.  The ""dummy"" in that episode, by the way, is the producer who, hitchcock like, wanted to appear in the movie.  The hole is contrived to replicate himself and produce other dummy clones.  Look at Joe.  He went down into the hole, and now the dummy has a friend.  Don't worry though, ignorance is bliss.",1222819200,,737,4.6875
8081299,4,B000B1Q78W,"I once recorded this upon a very late night presentation, which became a dark evocation. Three stories of the paranormal contained in this eerie documentary reminiscent of Night Gallery, narrated by Rod Serling:

Curse of The Heptagram

Three jokers trick a young gullible fellow with the promise of a sexual experience with a fictitious promiscuous girl. But when he goes to the address provided, he is met by an old lady who accidently shoots him. At the funeral, the boy's mother places a justified curse on the three un-""wise guys"". Lifting her veil, she widens her eyes, points and utters:

""One by land, two by sky. Three times 'round the heptagram go the three of you. And may your reward be just and true.""

And so it comes to be. Telling the tale from the perspective of one of the accursed while on a plane, he regales a Catholic Priest with the chain of strange events. Seven days apart, the first is run over by a car which suddenly reels out of control. The second perishes in a sky diving ""accident"" {his parachute fails to open}; and the final perpetrator perishes on the plane right after telling the priest his odd story. The priest just so happened to have gotten off at a stop right before the crash, and upon finding the accursed among the gory wreckage, manages to gurgle ""Father, it's the seventh day...""

And so they received what they deserved. I love the way the dynamics of a Curse are illustrated here. Applying 'The Evil Eye' and 'The Devil's Hook' upon the rotten. Good riddance. Lex Talionis.

The Hell Pit

When a young boy's dog falls into a mysterious foggy pit, he seeks the help of his father and some of the town's men to retrieve him. But when the boy's pop is lowered into the pit, which at this time begins emitting groaning, moaning, roaring  sounds, he emerges insane, spending the rest of his life in an asylum. Interesting to note that at the same time he was in the hole, a framed picture of him fell off the wall back at the house, in a seemingly sympathetic connection. Apparently, the dog was never rescued.

The Girl on The Bridge

The urban legend of the ghostly girl on the bridge who just wants to go home. But upon arriving at the address she cites, she disappears upon arrival. It turns out that she had died many years ago.

This relation also details her life prior to her 'excarnate' condition. She was a girl in love with a young suitor, whom her father disapproved of. They eventually decide to elope, and plunge over the side of that very bridge where they both die.

Just about every town has a variation of this tale with the same general elements - most notably, one ""Resurrection Mary"".

Conclusion

The presentation concludes with a review of the events, commenting about the resurgent interest in 'Witchcraft', a ""cursory"" explanation of a malediction. While the narrator asserts that those afflicted 'allowed' themselves to be thus hexed, the reality is that this is of little consideration, although still effectual on a Lesser Magic scale - only those who deem to protect themselves from such can attain a state of balance, and only if they are undeserving, which the individuals in this story certainly were not.

An analysis of the psychology of the country bumpkins at The Pit; and finally, the question of 'ghosts', which may have been more or less an environmental impression, perhaps caused by the intense emotional expenditure at the final moments, replaying in the atmosphere when similar conditions are present.

I really enjoyed the style in which this presentation was arranged. Allowing for mystery to pervade, allowing the viewer to question for themselves the nature of the events.",1222473600,,3663,4.735849056603773
8081300,5,B000B1Q78W,"This movie is hard to find. But worthy of a search. The 2nd story, about the hole in the ground, is sure to creep you out. On a more famous note, a popular hoax was based on this tale. The story is of Mel's Hole. A hole that seems bottomless and emits strange and frightening noises from deep within. Google it and you will be amazed and intrigued.",1197849600,5,348,4.132352941176471
