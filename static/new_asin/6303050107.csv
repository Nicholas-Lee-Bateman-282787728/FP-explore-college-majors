542595,5,6303050107,I very highly recommend this Mario Lanza film.  It is very enjoyable to watch and colorful.  The clothes and scenery are great and also the song selection.  It's little shown on television but a really good Mario Lanza film. Mr. Lanza can hit all notes so beautifully.  He truly has a angelic voice.,1052006400,9,299,4.584905660377358
542596,5,6303050107,"If I could award this Video a 10 I would just for the musical score alone. Mario Lanza's talented rendition of the arias in this presentation make it one of his very best. This is a sure winner that will have you watching it over and over just for the music. Lanza's ""Pagliacci"" is spell-binding and his acting skill shines through in this touching tale. A must for your Lanza or Opera collection.

542598,4,6303050107,"Musically speaking, Lanza's best movies are undoubtedly The Great Caruso, Serenade and For The First Time. The Great Caruso is the most accessible of the three, and also has the best production values. Serenade is a much darker movie, and contains Lanza's most impressive dramatic singing. It does, however, suffer from an uneven script (see my review if you're interested).

Although a much lighter tale, For The First Time is similarly flawed. It contains the most perfectly balanced musical programme of any of the tenor's seven movies, but at the same time suffers from a poorly written script and some sloppy dubbing. As with The Seven Hills of Rome the preceding year, the original script was apparently a good one, but somewhere along the way a sugar coating was added to the story. The result was a highly sentimental tear-jerker with a good deal of banal dialogue.

It's to Lanza's credit, then, that For The First Time transcends its limitations and remains a watchable - and often moving - swansong from a musical giant. It helps that Lanza, just a year before his death, was in superb voice throughout - with one exception that I'll get to in a minute. Here his voice retains the baritonal depth of the Serenade period, but if anything his tenor is even rounder that it had been three years earlier. This is a voice of extraordinary depth and power. The high notes are faultless and retain the brilliance of old, but equally importantly his singing is more controlled and sensitive than in some of his boisterous earlier appearances. It must have helped that the operatic selections were recorded (and filmed) at the Rome Opera House, thus providing the tenor with a more artistic atmosphere than Hollywood could ever have afforded.

The Vesti La Giubba scene is extremely moving, both visually and vocally. Free of distracting histrionics,
this is a very different rendition from his slightly hammy earlier performances of the aria. If you never thought Lanza could top his magnificent rendition from The Great Caruso, then be prepared for a big surprise. This is the perfect Canio voice - dark, rich and powerful - and the pathos in Lanza's voice as he sustains the climactic High A on the word ""infranto"" is all but overwhelming.

The other operatic selections are equally impressive - with the exception of the strained La Donna E Mobile that begins the movie. The Otello Finale, Grand March from Aida, and trio (E Voi Ridete) from Cosi Fan Tutte present an amazingly varied programme, and I can think of no other tenor capable of pulling off both the drama of Verdi and the lightness of Mozart with such effortless panache.

Among the lighter selections, Lanza also sings appealing versions of Come Prima (For The First Time), O Sole Mio, Schubert's Ave Maria, a Bavarian Drinking Song (Hofbrauhaus Song), and the pretty-though-brief O Mon Amour. There is also a tantalising snatch from Grieg's I Love Thee, with Lanza's gleaming tenor ringing out in all its glory.

Physically, he often appears tired, and the unhealthy bags under his eyes betray his failing health. Nevertheless, he looks terrific in certain scenes, and unusually for the tenor his relatively slim appearance remains more or less consistent throughout the movie.

Aside from the movie's vocal strengths, what really saves the film is the tender rapport between Lanza and his delightful co-star, Johanna Von Koczian. Their love for each other, quickly though it develops, seems convincing, and there are moments in which it is hard to believe that Lanza is only acting.

Corny moments aside (and there are plenty of them), For The First Time is a poignant farewell to Lanza, and a vocal feast at that.",1003536000,53,3686,4.9243156199677935
542599,5,6303050107,"""For the First Time"" is my personal favorite and one of the best Mario Lanza pictures. His voice, magnificent.  The movie is a  tender love story filled with great music from opera to pop. Why the cd of the soundtrack does not contain the delightful ""Cosi"" trio is a mystery. Mario's supporting player are all first rate.  How Mario must have revelled in playing a difficult opera singer. This film contain some of his best singing. What might we have had if he had only lived, or been better treated by  the studio system. An all around treat not to be missed.",980985600,13,561,4.470588235294118
542600,4,6303050107,"Mario Lanza made seven films, from 1948's That Midnight Kiss to this one, his last, filmed in 1958 in Capri, Austria and other beautiful locales.  Lanza is often underrated as an actor--the fact is, people paid to hear his  top-notch tenor voice--but he is always good in his movies, and this is one  of my two favorites (the other is Serenade, from 1955, Warner Bros.) MGM  gave him ""A"" picture treatment here, with fine co-stars,  including Kurt Kaszner and Zsa Zsa Gabor.  The musical score ranges, as  usual for Lanza, from pop standards to light classics to heavy operatic  arias and scenes. He really sounds fantastic in most of the film, singing  Come prima, Schubert's Ave Maria, Grieg's I Love Thee, and music from the  operas I Pagliacci, Cosi fan tutte, Otello and Aida.  His appearance varies  from scene to scene, but, well, that was Mario!  Who cares when you hear a  voice like his?  His Vesti la giubba, in full clown make-up and costume, is  one of the best around.  A nice, sentimental musical romance that will  please the eyes and ears.",958435200,22,1056,4.6775956284153

This is an excellent movie, if you love Mario Lanza.  The scenery, setting, the story, the filming, acting and directing are all good.  Most of all, there is Mario Lanza at his best.  It showed he was once again ""on top"" as a tenor, a movie star and a brilliant concert performer and recording artist.  He had years of magnificent performances ahead of him when he died in Rome at the age of 38, 54 years ago this month.  His last movie is a tribute to his art and the generations of singers who were inspired by him.

He was enormously gifted with good looks, charisma and immense talent. Mario Lanza was the most versatile tenor who ever walked on a stage. He could sing opera like the greatest tenors of all time. He was a master at ""crossing over"" from lyric opera to popular singing. As a result, he was a top recording artist and concert performer. In the ""Great Caruso"" he also showed he could be a global movie sensation. The movie about the amazing Neapolitan tenor actually was about Mario Lanza. It turned the Great Caruso into the Great Lanza. He exhibited all of his splendid qualities.

His movies inspired me to write my recent book about him: ""A Kid from Philadelphia, Mario Lanza, the Voice of the Poets."" It is not a biography. If you are searching for a biography of Mario Lanza, this is not the one, even if it goes into his life.  There have been several excellent bios about him. This is a book from a fan. It exhibits his qualities, talents, passion and love for his art. I wanted it to be a ""page turner"" that would be impossible to put down while listening to the magnificent voice of Mario Lanza.  I suggest you listen to Mario as you read it.

Anyone who loves Lanza the movie star, the tenor, the popular singer and the human being, who did so much in such a short time, will love his final film, ""For the First Time.""",1381536000,3,2083,4.80672268907563

It gives the audience some of his finest operatic singing. Again as in the MacDonald/Eddy films there is idealism motivating characters. One feels nostalgia for that lost world.",1379203200,2,422,5.115942028985507

Both the movies are a sheer musical delight and this one about an American Italian who visits Rome - Italy. To reveal more would spoil all the fun, but suffice to mention  superb photography. The picture and sound is great.

7835703,4,6303050107,"I am a big fan of Lanza- his singing was the first 'classical' singing I ever remember hearing as a child (Student Prince) and his film biopic of 'The Great Caruso' made me want to go into classical singing myself as a career, as both performer and Academic. So, I know what I am talking about. This film (Lanza's last) has a rather bland woman as his 'co-star' and the silliness of the sub-plot (a self-absorbed egotistic opera singer gives up an equally self-absorbed Zsa Zsa Gabor, for a deaf - a DEAF girl!? and then foolishly puts her in harm's way, when 'even a cold' could cause her to lose her regained hearing, etc. is just about more than even a B-grade flick - which is what this is) can carry without collapsing into cliches and predictable outcomes. Which it does.

I'm sorry if I am 'raining on your parade' in saying what I do, but even the ""Seven Hills of Rome"" (the previous 'made-in-Italia' film of Lanza's) came off better than this one, and it was not as costly to produce. Lanza looks and sounds tired- as if all his philandering, binge gorging and boozing were finally catching up to him (they did- he died a ridiculous death at too early an age) and I hoped that it could bee overcome. There are moments when Lanza actually ACTS, and that is a joy to see- but it comes and goes, like the plot. The Score is nice, but the 'lead' song is nowhere near 'Be My Love' (one of Lanza's biggest hits). I mean, the cost is less than a first-run movie ticket, and if you are curious, then I suppose getting this film makes sense. But the positive reviews on this site, made me believe it was the ""summum bonum"" of all Lanza cinematography. It ain't.  Your call- but, for me, I wish I had bought something else... like a real singing movie, with McDonald and Eddy. So much better, even with all the campiness.",1501200000,,1820,4.381656804733728
