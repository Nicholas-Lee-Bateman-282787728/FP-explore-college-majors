7549405,5,B018IDVB3U,"This review is for the movie, however, I have already pre-ordered DVD when released.
There is so much action going on, and even though I was paying attention, I can't wait to watch it again.
I came away from movie thinking that anyone who didn't try and make a difference in the outcome of these true events, then SHAME ON YOU!
A small group of brave Americans went against orders and at least did their best, even though we lost 4 great men.
Not naming names, but those who were in charge, they know who they are.
No spoiler here, this movie kept to the facts and events as they unfolded.
Michael Bay did an incredible job!
Please watch this movie, and help support all of our brave men and women in the military who are assigned to dangerous places around the world.",1453075200,128,768,4.3776223776223775
7549406,5,B018IDVB3U,"""13 Hours"" gave me one of the very best movie-going experiences of my life.  The fact that I'm considering this movie as one of my Top 5 All-Time Favorite Movies shocks me nearly to death--I had never expected to enjoy it so much.  And not only is ""13 Hours"" a solid film in and of itself, it does an incredibly good job honoring those who risked and gave their lives to save other people.  All of us need constant reminder that we sleep peacefully in our beds at night because good men stand ready to do violence on our behalf.

I was very skeptical going into this movie, considering the event happened a mere 3 years prior to filming and was incredibly hush-hush (considering it mostly revolved around CIA stuff, how much classified info is out there we don't know?) and that this movie covers a political hot-button issue.  Upon hearing from some people I respect tell me that this movie is worth seeing, I watched a trailer and decided it might actually be pretty good, so I gave it a go on opening night.  It did NOT disappoint!!  I constantly keep up with current events, and even have two degrees in history with a military history focus, but I didn't realize just really what went down in Benghazi that night (I hadn't read the book either for the same reason I didn't think the movie would be good).

This movie surprised me with how much it really focuses the audience on the people involved.  As a father of two children under the age of 2 years old, perhaps it was easier for me to relate to real-life characters being portrayed that have babies and toddlers back home, but I really felt connected to the warriors in this film that risked it all to help others.  Sure, they were private contractors that needed some money, but you know what, this is a foolish criticism because there are simply so many safer ways to make a buck than to put yourself in a 3rd world warzone in which there is no real government and rival, radical groups are constantly shooting up the city!  They did this because they knew they had the skills and dedication to put it all on the line if it came down to it.

The story's pacing and action will also keep you riveted to every moment of the movie as one situation escalates into the next.  Personally, I thought the acting was superb, and the cast spectacular (it includes war movie experience including some lesser knowns who were in 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'The Pacific'---Jim and Roy from 'The Office' both make solid transitions to a totally different acting job).  I'm also simply shocked that Michael Bay had anything to do with this movie, but you would never guess he directed ""13 Hours"" if you watched it without knowing beforehand.  This is easily his best film ever and I doubt he will ever top it!

So, what difference does it make??  Well, ""13 Hours"" will inform you, entertain you, and make you really think about and appreciate those who fight for the lives of other people, especially others they don't even know.  If anything, watch this to honor and respect the four Americans that died on 11 September 2012 during this attack, and be thankful that 30 more Americans made it back home thanks to military veterans that volunteered to put themselves in a dance with death to get people back home to their families and loved ones.",1453075200,32,3290,4.528716216216216
7549407,3,B018IDVB3U,"I was looking forward to seeing '13 Hours' since Michael Bay directed the movie. However, I was baffled at how detached I was to any of the characters. Let alone the action in the movie became overbearing at times which is what you may expect from a two and a half hour movie.

7549408,5,B018IDVB3U,"This is perhaps the best film on the American soldier since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Hawk-Down/dp/B000065U1N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Hawk Down</a>.

Like all the best war films, this focuses on the soldiers (technically ex-soldiers in this case, now working for the CIA), and what they go through. Not just another Bay action film, very intense in content and emotion. John Krasinski, a long way from The Office, is going to surprise people here.

Bottom line is this: People have been talking about Benghazi for the past years, yet few still seem to know what exactly happened there. This movie fills in that blank and reminds us, while we sleep in our safe little world, our soldiers selflessly hold the line around the globe.",1452988800,602,1251,7.34
7549409,5,B018IDVB3U,"Just got back from the theatre and wanted to put my order in for this movie.  Great movie, Michael Bay is a fabulous action director and he served up another one of his best.  The actors did a superb job.  Sadly this is a movie about an actual American event.  However it's good to see the whole situation played out for some better understanding of the actual events.",1452902400,15,368,4.367647058823529
7549410,5,B018IDVB3U,It is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It should open your eyes as to the negative desire of our government to protect our people.,1452816000,23,136,4.074074074074074
7549411,5,B018IDVB3U,"13 HOURS  is Michael Bay's best movie in years. After a decade of directing 4 Transformers movies (directing another one in 2017). Bay takes time out from giant CGI robots to do an intense Benghazi thriller that's based on a true story. Many are maybe unsure of Bay directing another film based on a real life event (PEARL HARBOR and PAIN & GAIN) but here he delivers a visceral, intense, mature thriller. Yes this is his most mature movie ever, with subtle humour that's not over the top. The movie completely avoids politics and doesn't mention  Hilary Clinton or Barack Obama,  but Bay's main goal was to feel as if your there with these soldiers in Benghazi and he succeeded at that. The action will have on the edge of your seat,  some shaky cam at time, but still intense. The film's ending has emotional tribute to the real life brave soldiers who lived the attack and those who have fallen. If you love or like AMERICAN SNIPER, BLACK HAWK DOWN, ZERO DARK 30, LONE SURVIVOR and THE HURT LOCKER you'll enjoy 13 HOURS. The film is also shows that Michael Bay knows how to tell a great story, with characters you care about.",1452816000,390,1128,4.514705882352941
7549412,4,B018IDVB3U,"When Ambassador Chris Stephens visits the city his compound is evaluated and found to be lacking the usual protection of an embassy. It is not an embassy but rather a living quarters.

On September 11, 2012 people show up at Stephens' living quarters and start shooting as well as start fires. The CIA has a nearby compound staffed with staff and former military to provide additional security. They are ready to go help the Ambassador but are told to wait. By the time they  get there all they can do is rescue a couple people. They return to their compound where they are attacked two times and manage to fight the attackers off.

So the attackers bring in bombs which can not be fought with bullets. Insightful, shows what happens in the 'fog of war'. A significant amount of the unknown of which Americans are help accountable if they do something that later turns out to be considered wrong. Military violence and swearing.",1452816000,9,928,4.680981595092025

7549462,5,B018IDVB3U,"When you hear a movie is Michael Bay, chances are your first reaction is to cringe at bad jokes, excessive explosions and a lackluster... everything.  I feel as though the writers and he, really wanted to portray a solid, true to life story.  Documentaries talk about how they had several of the real soldiers on set to help them make this happen and what came out of it was an amazing story that didn't feel over the top at all.  It had real passion, a great cast, timely jokes, suspense, drama and didn't try to lean political at all.  It just told the story and wow.. what a movie.  Watched it a dozen times at least and I don't even really get into war-genre movies.  Just an exceptional job.",1535328000,,696,4.3565891472868215
7549513,4,B018IDVB3U,Good movie.  Good actors. Sure the book and movie glossed over real events.  Surprised that Michael Bay was on this project. He's not really a detail kind of director.  Good depiction on the frustrating  government policy of putting CIA / State Department sites in areas of the world that we can't defend.  .  Rescue mission failed before these sites were established.  Love to see a documentary on these events plus actual report on Libya today.  Bourdain had a interesting show on Libya from 2014.,1535155200,,499,4.857142857142857

7549515,5,B018IDVB3U,"I had not watched any trailers or read anything about this movie.

+ We care for the characters involved and are rooting for them.
Just enough time spent on seeing the main protagonists missing their families and the strain of their job that is put on their families.

+ We appreciate their competence.
The movie shows us how these guys are cool, calm, and capable. There may be chaos around them or heightened emotions, but they often sit and watch, talking to one another and/or talking to their translator versus shooting everyone up, which is what you'd expect from an action movie.

+ Great realism and action scenes.
The mayhem that ensues in the action scenes feels realistic and full of tension and suspense.

+ Based on true events and real-life people.
The ending credits we see the real people portrayed in this historic event.

+ Directed by Michael Bay?!?
Mr. Transformers movie did this. What?! Well, it was well directed and Michael Bay knows how to give us tension and action.

OVERALL:
We liked it so much, we had to watch it again within a day or two, so we could pick out more of the subtle details that we missed the first time. Truly respect people who for their job are in these dangerous places on Earth. Very enjoyable movie.",1535155200,,1249,4.603603603603603

7549519,5,B018IDVB3U,"Anyone interested in the truth surrounding the events in Benghazi should see this movie.  Fast-moving, detail oriented and absolutely spell-bounding.  All the while watching this movie, I just couldn't get this question out of my mind:  ""What difference at this point does it make anyway?"" It makes a big difference and kudos for those making this movie.",1534809600,,354,5.175438596491228

7549521,2,B018IDVB3U,"Michael Bay attempts to direct a subtle war film riddled with gunfire and explosions.

13 Hours is easily one of Michael Bay's finest films. The trouble is that he is such a stubborn director, he cannot help but stuff explosions, fire, and bullets anywhere he can to ruin the movie. The dramatic moments actually work well, especially during the few quieter moments. Bay actually finds some neat framing shots and camera angles at times in 13 Hours. It's almost as if he attempted to direct a good film for once. I can applaud his efforts.

Additionally, the first half drags until the deadly rooftop sequences in the second half pick things up. I wish Bay could have tried just a bit harder to make a more concise effort as 13 Hours really is about 20 minutes too long.

I must mention that this is essentially a propaganda movie for not just the American army and CIA, but also a clearly Republican conspiracy film to undermine to Obama administration's war efforts. To be fair, the mistakes make during Benghazi were devastating and avoidable, but little effort is make by Bay to explain these decisions. It's all simplistic and one sided to the last. At least Bay tried to honor these brave soldiers in earnest.

The acting is pretty bare bones. I buy these actors as the characters, but they are all so underwritten and dull, you hardly even make the effort to learn their names.

In all, if you want an entertaining enough war flick from Michael Bay and all that implies, you will get what you paid for, honestly. 13 Hours is not a great film, but it does make for an engaging conflict chronicling the Libyan engagements in Benghazi. Watch at your own risk.",1534636800,,1663,4.623728813559322
7549522,5,B018IDVB3U,I loved this movie because it tells you what happened in Benghazi! Now those who don't know have an idea why the rest of us are so disenchanted with Hillary Clinton!

7549553,5,B018IDVB3U,"One of my favorite movie and that says a lot, given my age and how many flicks Ive seen. This is a story of patriotism, loyalty and sacrifice. We could focus on the cowardice or downright betrayal of those in charge, but I don't want to give them any airtime, they suck. God bless fine young men like Rone, Glenn and others who put others lives before their own. You all are truly people we should all emulate.",1534464000,,410,4.269230769230769
7549554,3,B018IDVB3U,I was enjoying the movie until it came to the point where there was fighting but the scenes were jumping back and forth between daylight and dead of dark. I couldn't tell if it was a flashback; a combat scene happening in some other part of the world or what. It was very confusing and from that point on I really couldn't follow the story line anymore.,1534464000,,353,4.2835820895522385

7549800,5,B018IDVB3U,"Some reviewers have compared this movie to Blackhawk Down. I agreeit's a wonderful movie about brotherhood and never giving up the fight. I didn't realize until after the movie ended and I research it further that it is the movie that was panned by many people as being unrealistic, propaganda, and exaggerating or changing details of events. The funny thing is, the ""revised"" version of events that I've read in various places does not seem truthful at all. This movie, on the other hand, does. The incompetence of desk personnel and their coverups of that incompetence are laid bare in this film, and though it's sad to see such idiocy at such high levels, anyone who lives in the real world should expect that.

Enough editorializing about the general state of stupidity. This movie manages to humanize the men in it. They are shown with their weaknesses and strengths equally exposed. People sometimes forget that just because some guy is a badass in battle, does not by default mean that he's a one-dimensional idiot. This movie does a good job of showing all aspects of these men's lives. It also exemplifies how messy the world really is, especially in times of war and conflict. The fight scenes and overall tension in this movie is unlike most movies you'll ever seestunning.",1528761600,,1284,4.836363636363636

Turns out, the ambassador was likely an arms dealer, and had some deals taking place in Benghazi. The movie portrays ambassador Stevens as an idealistic do-gooder, trying to help the Libyans form a new government.

Here's the deal: This is a far cry from ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Full Metal Jacket.""  In fact, it's a far cry from any film that involves discernment or critical thought. It's more like a video game transposed onto the silver screen.

But we all need to be entertained sometimes, and this accomplishes that.  It's fine.  But the back stories are rote and totally unconvincing.  And the conflict that inevitably develops between the CIA staff and the military contractors is entirely color by numbers.

This review contrasts with most others, and, yeah, I get it, it's a nice production. But 4 or 5 stars ... nah, not by a long shot.",1525392000,,732,4.627906976744186

It will drive home the horror they lived through and, if you've been in a war zone, it might even bring back memories you'd rather forget.
This is a history lesson and the movie follows the events with exceptional accuracy. I can see why people tried to stop the distribution of this movie as it exposes some truths that some people didn't want revealed in gut-wrenching detail.
We should never again allow this to happen, to rely on indigenous security, especially like the February 17th Martyrs Brigade and never again without a rescue plan.
Missing from the movie was a discussion about the 400+ missing MANPADS (MAN-portable Air-Defense System) that were supposed to be at the compound.
Also missing was the fact that Ambassador Stevens' travel itinerary was one of the emails Secretary of State had sent over her unsecure server--it was published on Wikileaks with the rest of her emails.",1523836800,,1142,4.984293193717278

7550346,5,B018IDVB3U,"This movie is a fantastic look at an event that was made to be a political minefield, but the movie is essentially apolitical.  The director and actors did a fantastic job of sticking to the facts in spite of the political hot potato it could have been.

Besides the apolitical side of the film, I enjoyed the struggle you see in these guys who want to help and are trained for just such an event, but are ordered not to.  The tension there is one of the best parts of the film.  Do they go against their orders?  Or do they do as they're told?  When they act, is it too late, or would their participation have changed the outcome?  All these questions are posed to the audience.

The acting is great, the action/firefight scenes are realistic and gritty, and the emotion evoked is very authentic.",1519171200,,797,4.410958904109589

The movie skips and condenses some of the book. The JAMBO rams buying confrontation is not mentioned in the book though it is a high point of the movie for me.
The CIA personnel at Benghazi consider their ex-Special Forces such as Navy Seals who are their Contractors/Protectors to be useless meat heads who just pump iron and watch video to while away their time. UNTIL THE SHOOTING STARTS!

Many would classify me as a hardcore conservative.  Maybe I am.  I believe in the Bible front-to-back, God first, family second, country third.  I support our troops.  Doesn't mean I condone every military action our nation is involved in, but the men and women on the front line- I support them.  I want them all to accomplish their mission and then return home safe and sound.

This is a movie about those men.  It shows their sacrifice, their courage, even their weakness (soldiers get scared too).

Love this movie.  I don't consider it biased in anyway.  Be that pro-conservative, anti-us-military, etc.  It's a movie that focuses on the soldiers, tells their story.  That's it.  No political BS thrown in.

7550428,5,B018IDVB3U,"This is an excellent film that tells the story of what happened in Benghazi at both the diplomatic compound and at the CIA Annex. It is based on a book by the same title. It is told by the operators, warriors, that were there and that fought to save lives and protect other Americans. The book and film take no side in the political arguments that have taken place during the event or after the event. It is a film to simply tell the story of the actions of the people involved in protecting the security and lives of the people that were there.

The movie is well produced and the story is so intense that it is hard to believe the conditions the American warriors, the personnel of the diplomatic compounds and the CIA annex went through. It shows the bravery of the men involved in the security and how they risk their lives to protect the Americans in Benghazi. It is important for people to know that brave men defend this country daily and this story clearly depicts what these men went through during this ordeal.

I rated this film at 5 stars and I commend the warriors that were involved. Overall, people were killed by terrorists and many more would have certainly died if not for the brave actions of these men.

As necessary as it is to know how to physically defend yourself, the pen *is* mightier than the sword; our words and ability to communicate with one another must be capitalized on and we must find a way to peacefully blend our cultures. Information is This is MORE than possible with the internet nowadays; we can communicate with those we don't understand

I say we bring back Persian Mesopotamia, put it under Westernized SECULAR, democratic government that actually allows women freedoms like suffrage and doesn't kill off and throw LGBT individuals off rooftops.

At the time of this incident I was in Ghazni Afghanistan and still remember the discussions and speculations about what the .... happened. I guess we may never know everything but ........

Now for the review: I give it 4 Stars even though in the beginning it was heavy on the clichs, it had a few unrealistic special effects, and may have taken some literary license.

On the positive side, true feelings and raw emotion were expressed i.e. the way you miss your wife and children when you are there but when you are home you are haunted by the need to go back.

The movie kept you riveted to the point that if you are watching it with someone that has never seen even a small portion of what happened in this movie i.e. mortars, rpg, and people you know dying, you may become a little frustrated with the questions and interruptions.

The action brings you to the point of .....<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/13-Hours-The-Secret-Soldiers-of-Benghazi/dp/B01AIW6KZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi</a>",1515801600,23,1218,5.1313131313131315

7550601,5,B018IDVB3U,"(DSM) Excellent film of the Benghazi attack on Sep. 11, 2012.  It is a war movie, from the point of view of CIA contractors.  The film depicts the events up to and during the terrorists' attack on the US facility (the Obama administration refused to call it an embassy) and the death of the American Ambassador.  Three other Americans died during the fighting that night.  The film is well done and the special effects are more realistic than most Hollywood drivel.  Hollywood usually depicts all rifles firing full automatic at all times, but this movie showed the CIA guys firing single shot (semi-auto) and even the SAW (a machine gun) was fired in short bursts.  There was no depiction of lead bullets creating sparks, either, as Hollywood loves to portray. Michael Bay did a great job with this story.  Very little was mentioned about the reluctance of the Obama administration to send assistance to Benghazi (a reelection was looming) and the CIA station chief in Benghazi who felt security was ""someone else's job"".  One of the lessons learned (again) is that the terrorists are dressed as civilians, making tactical decisions by Americans very difficult.  We had the same issue in Viet Nam, but then, politicians never learn about war.",1514764800,6,1243,4.909090909090909

Viewing the events leading up to and during the attack only managed to further fuel my anger for the HEINOUS, WASTE OF SPACE A$$HAT US GOVT OFFICIAL(S) (and we ALL know who that is) responsible for NOT sending assistance when they had the opportunity to do so. That this even took place is ridiculous but that the highest trained military of the most powerful country in the world wasn't IMMEDIATELY dispatched to this sad circus of insanity can never be forgotten OR forgiven and this film does excellent work of putting the viewer right inside every soul-searching, heart-wrenching moment of it.

War sucks, yeah but I knew that already. Something deeper was troubling me about this movie.  I wrote down a few thoughts as to why and arrived with a few thoughts. How can we send our people, eg senator, special forces, to a hostile location without protection?  And our government watches live via drone! I then realized that my anger was not against war, but against lies and coverups.

How can our elected officials knowing all that was going down, (and presumably knowing citizens will know soon), lie and cover this up?  Because 'they' can!

The movie does a great job of showing real events by placing you in the action and making you desperately care about each fighter and what unfolds. It balances action with tension and quiet, realistic dialogue and sets the scene in such a way that you aren't drowned in the politics of the evnets but the controversies are not ignored, either. It focuses almost exclusively, and most importantly, on realistically portraying true American heroes in a heart-stopping, awful situation.

I am heartened by the fact that they showed everything it means for our service men and women to be uniquely American and a force for good, while simultaneously showing the complete and utter, shameful breakdown of everything that we stand for in the response from our government under that administration.  Not only did our leaders show extreme cowardice and purely anti American values but they also put on display treason, lies and misinformation to the complete dishonor of Ambassador Chris Stevens and the operators who were killed.

The Whitehouse and Secretary Of State ""Hillary Clinton ""  prevented our military from intervening in the attack.  We had a US destroyer approximately 20 minutes flying time away from the embassy.  Hillary Clinton said that it was only a protest of a movie made which was anti-Islamic.  Hillary lied to the families of the victims .  This shows how Hollywood is not telling the real truth and covering up for Obama and Bitch Hillary.  Google Susan Rice was Obama's  National Security Advisor.  Susan Rice was on all the network TV shows saying Benghazi was only a protest of a movie.

For the Americans not to have received support from their own country was a slap in the face for them.  Then, they did not even get flown out of the country by their own.  Thank Libyan Air for that.  I think the head of the CIA compound was in denial as to the seriousness of the situation and simply did not have military expertise and judgment to get things done in a timely manner.  He should have sent help to the ambassador's compound immediately without question.  Did he think the other compound had nothing to do with the CIA compound.  Obviously, the CIA compound would be next.  So much goes on that we never hear about.  This film is quite good showing the down to earth events without politics.

7551088,4,B018IDVB3U,"very well directed, It moves quickly just as the actual events most likely did. I've read reviews of this film stating that it conveyed an (anti State Department) point of view which translates for some into an (anti Hillary Clinton) point of view, Hillary Clinton being at the time the Secretary of State. I didn't get that impression. You can fault Hillary Clinton for other things but any one who knows how the State Department has traditionally operated knows the relatively wide latitude given to its ambassadors. Yes, it would've been prudent and more than a little prescient had someone in either the State Department or the executive branch foreseen the uprising that occurred and taken some measure of preventative protection, but that didn't happen. I'm sorry for the lives lost on both sides, but once the battle was joined, you cant fault the well trained, well armed security personnel for doing what was expected of them. When the political dismemberment of Libya turned the country into a free fire zone for a number of factions willing to kill any and all who opposed them, nothing was predictable.
Much has been said about the failure to call in U.S. military force. Most of this criticism is uninformed. Those who think a single telephone call can produce either an air strike or low fly over in minutes don't understand the importance and legitimacy of going through the 'Chain of Command.' It's never as simple as people think it is.  I think this film is (generally speaking) an accurate portrayal of what happened in Benghazi. I'm no right winger. I believe the Pentagon and the CIA should be vigorously reigned in but I have enormous respect for those security guards who certainly prevented a massacre that awful night in Libya.
I would have preferred giving this film four and a half stars.  M.M.",1506556800,,1821,4.852090032154341

The acting was very good even though it was hard to distinguish some of the characters from one another at times due to the dirt, grime, and effects of the combat scenes. But I do give them glowing marks for their great performances. Introducing the viewers to some of their families provided a nice personal touch.

The fact is that the attack was pre-planned a month in advance, had nothing to do with the video and was admitted so in Mrs. Clinton's emails on September 13th around the same time that Susan Rice was going before the world media and announcing the official lie.  An innocent man spent over a year in prison due to an insulting video and an officially backed US lie.

7551467,5,B018IDVB3U,"I am unsurprised that this film has so many reader reviews.  I thoroughly loved it; the acting was superb; the soundtrack was incredibly well done.  The movie does make this viewer angry and sad and in awe, all at the same time.  I appreciate that the director did not politicize it except to make us wonder and help us to understand how help does not get to those who need it.

I do not believe that the fault lies with Clinton alone on this; a LOT of mistakes led to this fiasco including Ambassador Stevens going there in the first place.  I understand his dedication and think it was beautiful but ended tragically and hurt others in the process when security was not in place at the State Department compound.  Obama was too timid and should have allowed the military to come in from Italy instead of waiting for permission.  It is a case of act now, apologize later being best; timidity never works for the powerful, and the U.S. lost a lot of respect over this.

There should have been a better idea of the plan for 9-11's potential for issues, especially when that compound was so unprotected.  This is where  the CIA chief should have done a better job; his unwillingness to let the contractors go to assist was a very bad decision (he who hesitates is lost--but in this case, it was Stevens and the IT guy who were lost, then eventually two incredible SEAL heroes) when they could have prevented the escalation to the CIA compound AND saved the Ambassador had there been a strong immediate reaction.  So many lessons and so much to think about, thank you so much for the author of the book and those contractors for telling the story.  And to the director and actors for doing it so well.

I thought the depiction of confusion was excellent.  I do not understand the criticism that the combat scenes went on too long; viewers experienced NOTHING compared to the actual people who lived through it in Benghazi.  I appreciated the sensitivity to some of the Libyans who were working with the Americans to defend; but not getting the context or why there was animosity to the U.S. was unfortunate.  Yet it was appropriate to leave it out of the film.  It just made me go and research this incident.  We all need to understand why there is animosity toward the U.S., and also that when a leader like Gaddafi is taken out, a severe power vacuum will exist and it will be bad for civilians who have to live through the infighting.  This I do feel was something Clinton did not and does not really grasp, power can be arrogant and foolish.

The Administration's reaction afterwards was sorta understandable because no one wants to have to assume responsibility for such a fiasco.  But leaders do this.  They take responsibility.  I can't imagine Bush, or Trump, doing any better in terms of assuming responsibility.  Kennedy would have, Nixon might have.  Carter, yes.  Bush the elder, likely.  Had it been Biden, he would also have taken responsibility, but we would not have been there in the first place.

The film is so well done that it makes you think, for a long time...so I highly recommend it.

To those Contractors who were there and so valiant, I am just in awe of you and so appreciate your skills and training and courage.  That was some job you did, no words suffice.  Thank God you were there.  I have a much better appreciation for what Contractors do and what they are facing.

I hope you have been able to finally go home and find some meaning in a life after being a warrior.",1501891200,,3497,4.526315789473684

As someone who did not vote for Hillary or Trump,  I wanted to see if all the ""bad"" and ""good"" I'd heard from my network (depending on your political persuasion) was real.  Would it be a Hillary blame fest?  Would it be a right wing consipiracy theory dreamed up from the deepest depths of Sean Hannity's mind.  Was it a propaganda film based in complete myth designed to influence the election.

What I got instead was an amazing true story with no political overtones,  as hard as this is to believe.  It was just a frank, brutal retelling of the real life heroics, trials, and tragic deaths of these men and their comrades who risked all to save lives despite the bureaucratic nightmare they were up against.  The film blames nobody overtly,  it just tells the harrowing story which needs no embellishment and leaves it to the viewer to decide who might be responsible.  Watch it.

As far as facts go, the only person to criticize this film was the CIA chief who claimed that he never told his security contactors to stand down. The contractors eventually disobeyed his orders;
the 1/2 hour delay may have caused Ambassador Stevens his life.

The film moves at a fast pace & the combat & tactics give the movie a very realistic feel. These 6 contractors were ex-elite military with combat experience with the Marines, Navy Seals & Army Rangers. Greatly outnumbered, they displayed remarkable courage & professionalism under fire, despite the fact that they were not given their requested air support. The use of relatively unknown actors also adds to the realism.

I have very little to criticize this film. It has a gritty, unsanitized quality to it. It's about betrayal, selflessness, the chaos & confusion of combat & fighting for survival & the man next to you. Not for some ideology or political agenda. If you enjoyed movies like Platoon, Blackhawk Down, We Were Soldiers or HBO's Band of Brothers, you will like this movie. It can be viewed again & again.",1499212800,48,1242,4.821596244131455

It isn't afflicted with the prepubescent toy box atmosphere of the Transformer films, or the over-the-top jingoism of Pearl Harbor. It's a straightforward war film that takes care of business. You know at all times the geography of the conflict and the roles of the players. Nothing feels like it was strained through Bay's ultra-commercial sensibility. Kudos to the screenplay by Chuck Hogan which keeps everything real. This film is more in the vein of the Peter Berg trilogy of recent real stories, all starring Mark Wahlberg (""Lone Survivor,"" ""Deepwater Horizon"" and ""Patriots Day""). Like those films, the coda at the end features photos of the real people whose stories we have just seen. John Krasinski has the Wahlberg role, a key player that the dramatic narrative focuses on.

He was conservative compared to his normal style and it really works here.  It's a character study and a horrific view of what happened there ... without being overblown or too 'patriotic-y'.  Just a sad, sad story and I see the special contractors in a different light now.  So, thank you Michael Bay for making a film I can get behind 1000%.",1498176000,,485,4.726190476190476
7551720,4,B018IDVB3U,"I liked this movie for that last few minutes at the end when the people of Benghazi were looking over their dead husbands and family members. That is when it hits you that you say to yourself, why the hell is America over in these countries in the first place? Think about it, who really are the heroes and patriots here? It's NOT America people, it is those who are fighting for their own land. America is the insurgent, not the people of Benghazi. As much as I wanted the Americans to win, it is the people of that land that should be the ultimate winners and who decide what goes on in that area of the world. The movie in a round about way, showed that this is nothing but a wasted war for America where Americans sacrifice their lives for the God of War and big oil companies. George Washington and others made it quite plain that we should NOT be in these foreign wars. As to the movie itself, it had some good effects and suspense because you never knew who was on your side. I can't imagine being an American working under those conditions.",1498176000,,1048,4.297979797979798

7551726,4,B018IDVB3U,"I finally got around to watching the well-known story from September 11, 2012.  From what I remember most of the focus was on the modest State Department diplomatic outpost where Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed in a fire.  The battle that went on at the CIA outpost is brought out of the shadows in this film.  Usually Im cautious of seeing a film by director Michael Bey, but this is some of his best work.

A civilian crew of 6 former special service military men are hired to guard the CIA outpost which included about 25 people.  The station chief known only as Chief or Bob (David Costabile) is in charge.  He and others become concerned when it is learned that Stevens and a modest entourage are coming to Benghazi and will be staying at the consulate, guarded only by local Libyans.  The 6 commandos are led by Rone Woods (James Badge Dale).  The primary focus is on Jack Silva (John Krasinski), the only one we get much of a back story on.  He seems to take on these assignments much to the consternation of his wife (Wrenn Schmidt) and young daughters.  But the money is good and Jack does like the action.

The rest of the squad includes Tanto Paronto (Pablo Schreiber), Boon Benton (David Denman), Tig Tiegen (Dominic Fumusa) and Oz Geist (Max Martini).  When the consulate comes under attack, Bob refuses to send them, suggesting Stevens own protection (2 men) and the Libyan military and police would fend them off.  It doesnt happen of course and the 6 men and a couple others eventually head to the compound only to find it set on fire, which is what actually killed Stevens.

Returning to the CIA post, it is now also under attack by local insurgents.  Beys focus during the movie is the fighting and to be honest it is terrific in terms of execution.  The horrors of battle are seen, even with what appears to be an Alamo-like last stand.  Fortunately our guys have a lot of bullets and night vision goggles.  What Bey doesnt challenge to any degree is the poor preparation, let alone why we are there to begin with.  There are certainly a lot of other unanswered questions such as why the response was so slow out of Tripoli or Italy where the U.S. has a strategic base a couple hours away.

Much of the movie is controversial in terms of what is true and what isnt.  Most prominent, why Bob was so reluctant to help the consulate.  In real life, this is still disputed by many who were there.  Some suggest otherwise.  So I don't know.  This is a very good, gung-ho, action-based film which for the most part leaves the politics aside.",1498003200,,2558,4.508695652173913
7551727,5,B018IDVB3U,"All I can say is wow!  I bought this movie to find the truth about what really happened.  I never waste precious time listening to the B.S. propaganda spewed by the inept media.  Normally I shy away from movies of battle-worn soldiers and war but this was one I had to see.  The magnitude of how these brave secret soldiers came together while the compound was under siege was amazing.  13 Hours was up close and personal.  I felt I was in combat with them, which I believe was the intent of the director.  By taking charge, the mental pressure they endured just to get through, along with life-threatening injuries is to be applauded.  Ignoring orders to stand down while other American lives were on the line was a bold move on their part.  However, with those orders, the life of the U.S. Ambassador [to Benghazi] was put in jeopardy, causing him to die of smoke inhalation and could have been prevented.  Watching the bravery and courage of these soldiers has me praying every day for our military, police & K9 units.  Having experienced life in another country makes me appreciate the freedoms I have as an American citizen.  Many thanks to our military and local police for putting [it] all on the line daily.

7551856,5,B018IDVB3U,"Good job focusing on the families for the character development that made you care about the team.  I saw other reviewers complain about lack of background, but I also saw trivia that the original cut was 4 hours, so letting the character development stand on a sketch of their experience and calls to the family while the movie focused on the environment and fight itself was a good call I think.  Greatly appreciated the tension of never knowing who were the good or bad guys, and even the one good guy calling his cousin among the bad guys to hear what the bad guys were up to.  And the one scene where they wouldn't shoot the car with the guy just holding a cell phone, then thinking that guy was actually a spotter for the mortars that hammered them...  It's amazing they didn't just start shooting everything in sight.  And this was just some handful of guys.  Pretty sure we have tens of thousands of soldiers in places just as ugly and ambiguous as this place risking their necks whenever they let an unknown person or car within fifty yards of them.  Anyway, that's what I got from this movie.  It's probably not as terrifying as the reality, but the essence of the fact nobody's sure who's friend or foe, and that they could even be the same people, and every act of restraint could be good or bad and get you killed either way.  Anyway, I'm glad the guys who survived this resigned after this mission irl but also glad our country has a deep bench of others filling their ranks.  Also, I didn't see anything political about this movie, though I could imagine conspiracy theories forming around plots to drop the Ambassador if someone thought that'd serve to keep Libya off its feet (or if someone thought he might become another Jimmy Carter or other such presidential candidate).  Sometimes wonder if the oligarchs formed the 2-party system to distract us from the fact 1 party is actually over everything... but, this movie wasn't about that.  Good movie about the soldiers, and generalizable to the worries of any soldiers who have families.  (I'm aware of soldiers who decline to marry because they don't think it's fair to the potential spouse or kids, and I can give those folks a nod too.)

Even though much of the info from the Benghazi hearings will remain redacted for some time, it's strongly encouraged for Americans to learn about the exceptional bravery of those who rushed to selflessly defend the attacks on the Diplomatic outpost (Ambassador Chris Stevens' residence in Libya) and the CIA annex in Benghazi. Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, Glen Doherty and Ambassador Chris Stevens lost their lives while U.S. diplomacy (aka Sec'y of State) and Susan Rice spun deliberately false tales of the night's events to the press. There are several other heroes who, until the release of the book by the same name, had not received celebration or proper recognition for their roles in keeping loss of life to a minimum.

The situation deteriorated and AMERICANS lost their lives.  We all witnessed the lies promulgated by the prior administration, they failed us all, this is their true legacy.

7551988,3,B018IDVB3U,"This film is supposed to honor the true story but it plays like a stylized action movie made for the military video gamer generation.  Lone Survivor, American Sniper, and even Black Hawk Down handled similar subject matter much better.

Even worse, the script and characters lack any subtlety or nuance.  Any of the scholarly CIA office types that work against our main characters are arrogant jerks while the main characters are all blue collar macho men that know everything and are never wrong.  They can also be pretty hard to tell apart except for archetypes such as the leader, the funny one, and the tough one.

There's a scene at the end where one character tells another that they're heroes for saving them as if the audience couldn't put that together on their own from watching the film.  In this, it just feels like the film is overly self-conscious about disrespecting the real life people.  Scenes like that one are even more bizarre when you compare it to all of the stylized action like the first-person camera view following a mortar from launch to target.

If it were not based on a real life event, I think the movie works as an action movie.  As it tries to both honor the true story and fill itself with blockbuster-style action it doesn't work.

Stevens wanted to be near to those who could impact the civilian infrastructure post Kadafi's era.  The CIA as noted (to some degree) was there with the mission to buy, destroy or otherwise depose of weapons of mass destruction, surface to air missiles and other so that the ""bad guys"" could not take advantage of the situation.

That said, the actions of the contractor force protection force did the best they could under the circumstances and the film correctly give these guys the true respect they deserve.

Some say..$700.00 per day (that was the going rate during my time) was too much...how many would take their places knowing full well the support unlike typical Army or Marine units would of been much more robust and better coordinated.

I think that if the explosions were cut down or weren't focused on as much then it would have looked better.  I say this because anyone who knows the littlest amount about what happened would already know that buildings would be destroyed and people would get shot.  For me, I like to focus on acting and script when I watch a film.  The acting was okay...very good by some and not very good by others.  The script didn't seem to flow for me either.  Some people seemed forced to speak when they could have easily been omitted in the final cuts.  I say the film is okay.

when u.s. personnel undercover, verified military are in need and their requests are not honored,.... when the request does not reflect a danger to the security of the base and only involves more assistance of chosen able bodies, then what is the problem? The problem is the resistance of prideful officers in command whether it be whoever in the house that is white or the commander nearby--- there is a definite problem of neuro transmission of the body of this country..... that is the vulnerability here..... sometimes commands need to be over-ridden even if it means a discharge-- if you sign up to die for your Country, you also sign up for the many ways to die-- even if your own country starves you and leaves you out cold while you are attempting to protect and serve- you have to prepare to die for your country-- even if your own country has an infection and refuses to provide....... which means,... those of others not in command knowing what is necessary to do but command does not allow it, must over-ride command to try and help fellow military personnel when there is a clear  danger if help is not achieved faster than what command is authorizing and also then refusing-- the most to happen is that your commander shoots you [so you died for your country] or you get discharged [ same thing].... either way there will be review upon the decision you make-- involving discharge, but you signed up to do this- even if it meant suffering by the own hands of your countries spin tops.",1493337600,,1866,4.795031055900621

It's just that, unlike most of his movies, the explosions didn't have their own explosions. And I don't think I noticed a single CG death robot.

If you like your war movies dramatic, highly cinematic, and with attractive hollywood stars pretending to be regular Joes who in turn happen to be experienced combat operators - but that also strives to accurately portray complex military events - then you'll like this movie. If you liked ""Black Hawk Down"", you'll probably like this movie.

If you're looking for a movie that blames Hillary Clinton for Benghazi, this isn't it. I suppose it might even partially ""vindicate"" her, inasmuch as it portrays the ""stand-down"" order coming from the CIA station chief, not the State Department. But doesn't do her any favors when it comes to 1) Noting that the embassy shouldn't have been staffed then in the first place [which I suppose Clinton could/should be blamed for], 2) was woefully underprepared [which is clearly on the GOP at least in terms of funding], and 3) mentions the initial reports stateside that it was a protest gone awry. (And although I don't think Clinton handled the fallout from that very well, I still give everyone involved a continent and ocean away, benefit of doubt for not only a confusing and muddy situation, but a confusing and muddy existence there. It would be easy to judge, but shouldn't be unless you were there. I don't like Clinton, but I think it's pretty clear there was political grandstanding and witch-hunting going on. Some cliche'd sayings are in order here: ""The first casualty of war is the truth"", ""Never attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence"", and ""The fog of war"" [causes incompetence]. )",1492819200,,1835,4.859424920127796

Regardless if you know anything about this subject before watching the movie, you will be moved at the sacrifice of our men overseas and enraged at the bureaucracy and what happened to these heroes.

When the movie was over, I had to do some fact-checking. I try to stay current on news topics and it was almost impossible to escape the numerous stories about Benghazi. Having said that, there were some scenes that seemed sculpted by Hollywood (who is notoriously liberal, but still). Surely I would have heard about this. As I checked, it turns out the movie was remarkably accurate. Once again, it depends on the sources you check. My advice is to try multiple, as everyone has their own angle or spin on the story.

Who do you believe? Someone who lived through it or the CIA base chief whos name has never been made public?
Lets not forget the semantics game. There may not have been an official stand down order, but when a security team is told to wait before rushing to the compound, thats a game of words with the same impact.

The fact that no one (no one being Obama or Hillary) went to prison is staggering, and a testament to just how numb our society has become and starving for true justice.  It was an emotional movie, difficult to watch, and one I won't watch again simply because it boils your blood.  Seriously...if you have high blood pressure, careful with this movie.

7552279,5,B018IDVB3U,"""13 Hours"" pulls you in from the first moment and doesn't let go.  The astonishing incompetence of CIA and State Department managers is on display from the start and contrasted starkly with the common sense, gritty wisdom of the six ex-military security operators assigned to protect them.  Along the way, a lot of Libyan Islamic fanatics get killed, along with a US Ambassador, a State Department IT contractor and two of the security operators who sacrifice their lives to protect bureaucrats who don't appreciate them.

The one element of the film I found hard to believe was how arrogant and detached from reality the Benghazi CIA station chief was.  He treats the security operators with open scorn, as if security in a terrorist chaos zone is an unnecessary inconvenience.  The screenwriters took artistic license there.  What CIA chief would be that stupid?

But the insanely thin security provided to essential US personnel in this Islamist hellhole of a country can't be denied.  Our government failed its US Benghazi staff utterly.

I have a feeling that Michael Bey intended this film as an indictment of the Obama administration's naivet in dealing with the new world order in the Middle East.  Mission accomplished.  I was embarrassed for our country after watching this film.",1491264000,,1289,5.061611374407583

Notice the scene at 1:30 Am in the hanger...but it is full day outside.  Lots of scenes like that.  It's like they just failed to plan how they were going to shoot the movie.  Don't get me wrong.

It pulls no punches and shows not only the lack of preparedness of the U.S. in reinforcing the consulate in Benghazi but the lack of leadership and concern, particularly in Washington, DC, in dealing with the Benghazi crisis, once it had begun to unfold. It displays, with no uncertain conviction, the bravery and valor of all of the military and security service personnel as they fought to defend against terrorist attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi on the eleventh anniversary of the 9/11 attacks of 2001.

This movie pays great testament to them and their memories I think.

The movie does not delve into the politics of Behghazi, other than to briefly point out that America and its European allies destabilized Libya and created a failed state.  The fact that it was President Obama and Secretary Clinton behind this disaster is never mentioned.

I don't understand the positive reviews that claim this is a story placing the blame for this fiasco at the feet of Secretary Clinton. The Secretary of State does not control the C.I.A, and director Michael Bay goes out of his way to point out that, despite repeated requests for additional security, and additional funding requests for more rapid response military forces from the State Department, these assets were not in place. If you want to assign blame for this situation, it can be laid at the feet of the most obstructionist U.S. Congress in our country's history. The G. O. P. controlled House and Senate were unwilling to support the State Department's requests for supposedly fiscal reasons. Hypocritically, they had no problem in authorizing countless investigations to establish the fault of this failure at the feet of Secretary Clinton. They failed to find any evidence, and wasted millions of dollars after the fact, and once again put party before country.

7552575,5,B018IDVB3U,"This film, nailed it from every angle. From the story line, directing, cinematography/visuals, special effects, stunt team, acting and a realistic dramatization of true events. The film also refrained from bringing politics into the film--making it easier to focus on the timeline of events. This allowed the viewer to make their own conclusions about what may have gone wrong and what might have been done to prevent this attack in the first place.

The acting was top notch ensemble style--each individual actor worked together in believable characters/team roles. The film, from the first few minutes, left you on the edge of your seat and took you mentally into the chaotic regional culture of Benghazi 2012 post-revolution. The characters' inability to distinguish between allies and enemies was palpable throughout the story, and outlined the constant danger these security teams faced. It was interesting to reflect on how petty tensions and egos between different government groups could ultimately lead to dissension, and put people in harms way.

I've watched this film three times so far. Upon reflection, I feel disturbed about this event and in general about the myopic, self-serving nature of politics in D.C. While we may not have the full story, I wonder how many fewer wars we would be fighting abroad if it were *mandatory* that the politicians sending our men and women into war/war zones also had to send their own (adult) children into harms way.

And it stirs my anger, my rage for that abandonment by the State department including Hillary Clinton, the CIA, Obama, and the whole Obama administration.  The blood of every person lost there is on their hands.  Everyone involved in the abandonment of our people should be indicted and sent to prison or at least have all their property confiscated and abandon them to the streets.  Wouldn't you think that would be justice?  We have been lied to and led down a long dangerous path by all in and associated with the Obama administration, including the media.  Our borders should not be open to terrorists or potential terrorists. We won one battle in our standup vote for the White House.

7552606,5,B018IDVB3U,"13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is a superior war drama, very well acted, filmed and edited.  It focuses on six ""contractors,"" ex special forces soldiers assigned to protect an unacknowledged CIA mission in Libya. John Krasinski gives an eye-opening performance for those who only remember him from TV's The Office. Viewers quickly get a sense of how volatile the post-Gaddafi situation is as his character arrives in country.  An embassy office, housing the Ambassador, is soon attacked (per the very well publicized tragedy), and then the CIA outpost is assaulted, like an ""Alamo"" in Libya.  Without going into detail, suffice it to say that you'll endure 90 minutes or so of harrowing, tense combat footage which forms the heart of the film. James Badge Dale and Pablo Schreiber are standouts, too, among the six and David Costabile wonderfully plays their stubborn, obstinate supervisor. An excellent job balancing the personal - very empathetic portrayal of the ""brotherhood among the six and their fears about not making it home - with very realistic battle scenes.",1487808000,7,1081,5.1657142857142855

7552621,5,B018IDVB3U,"Such an incredible movie!  I was impressed with how the movie and Michael Bay's directing of the story mirrored the information laid out in the book.  Unlike many action films, the scenes laid out and the heroes shown in realistic fashion.  I know that Michael Bay is always portrayed as telling stories with gratuitous explosions and overly cinematic flair, but this film is an action movie where in my opinion the fit is perfect.  Yes, there are slow motion shots aimed at tugging at the patriotic side of the audience but I think for this film it works just fine.

I have always enjoyed John Krasinski's acting on the TV show 'The Office' and was concerned that I would just see that character in this movie, but that was not the case.  Krasinski was able to prove in this movie that his range as an actor is impressive and I think he has found his new film genre to act in!  Also, David Denman (who played Pam's boyfriend Roy in The Office) is a principal actor in this film and he was incredible as well.  Again, a transformation from the character he played on the The Office.

I know that when they work in places such as this, they know what they are getting into, and that they know they are taking huge risks.  When it comes down to it actually happening, and there is no one to help you....that has got to be a crushing blow.

7552703,4,B018IDVB3U,"The ""pass the buck attitude"" is a normal thing in the military and . officers think they are in charge but will not accept any responsibility that endangers their career progression. The Special Operators have a different code and commitment, they stick together no matter what and will give when no one else will, regardless of the circumstance, assets or themselves. The majority of NCO's in the military operate the same way, they do not worry about progression and instead concentrate on mission and soldiers first. It is always better to ask forgiveness than ask for permission when it comes to mission readiness and completion as anyone with decade or more in the military, that has been in real combat knows.

The lawmakers and politicians are clueless idiots. Not fit to make decisions when they are not on site. Waiting for some boneheaded politician or officer to make a choice when they are on the other side of the planet or hundreds of miles away makes for bad outcomes like this incident that cost lives.

We know politicians were responsible for delays in both manpower and support. We know officers in charge were to afraid to make the right calls because they are cowards and afraid to destroy their careers to save lives. We know we need the CIA, but some members of the CIA need to be tied to chairs and placed in a pit with hungry dogs and left to die, like the politicians, cowardly officers and anyone not willing to make a call to save lives.

I spent 2 years in Iraq, one year in cav when I was an E-5, one year in Iraq as an E-7. During my time In April we lost 5 scouts and troops and 20 plus wounded because of an officer ignoring an NCO and giving a wrong turn into Al sadr's territory, they figured we came to attack but the joke was on them and us as the road crew was lost. Al sadr's fighters opened up from the roof tops into canvas covered 5-tons with troops simply being ferried around picking up roadblocks. Subsequently we sent out Bradleys and dismounts and for nearly 7 hours we had medivacs rolling in and out of FOB Wareagle. The officer in charge was never punished but he was evac'd as he was not to popular anymore.

During the first 8 months we took 40-60 mortar rounds a day, mostly 60mm with the occasional 80mm, never more than 7 as they moved alot, 15-30 minutes and rinse and repeat, no officer felt the mortars would last that long and until several people were wounded we received no counter fire support, nor any counter fire radar or UAV support. Finally the last 4 months we received uav and gunship support, and artillery, these killed 8 mortar teams in total in two months time and the last 2 months were very quiet. 3,049 mortar impacts on FOB Wareagle, highest in theater during that time.

One anecdotal note. While relieving myself in a building latrine, there was a small window just above my head, right in front of the urinal, It was about 2 am, I hear the ""chunk"" from the mortar round, and knew to count 9 seconds, because we knew where they were distance wise, time varied a bit. At count 6 I stepped away from the urnial, business ""still in hand"" so to speak and turned away and to the side wall, the round hit in between the buildings knocking out the glass above the urinal. I simply slid back over and finished my business and went back to work. Just another night.

It is always the brainless idiots in charge that are not on site that cause these situations and cost lives and wounded.",1487116800,2,3457,4.462025316455696

7552752,5,B018IDVB3U,"I had avoided watching this movie for quite awhile after hearing how it was a perfect example of Hillary Clinton & Obama ""not caring about our troops."" I thought it was going to be a cheesy partisan war movie demonizing the Obama administration at every turn. I was happy to find out this is not the case.

Instead, Michael Bay delivers a fairly neutral and straight to the point military drama. A true story about a skeleton crew of US CIA personnel stationed in Syria after a chaotic overthrow of the country's leader: Muammar Gaddafi. A small group of Americans secretly stationed in a country that is in the midst of chaos. What could go wrong? This is a real world example of exactly what can happen. The movie reminded me a bit of Black Hawk Down. I recommend this movie to others!

This movie certainly answers Hilary Clinton's question about Bengazzi; ""What does it matter, now??"" It certainly exposes the lack of leadership and proper planning. Have we learned nothing from the deaths of the 238 Marines in 1983, or the bombing of the Pan Am 747?
The movie is intensely realistic, compelling and spellbinding. I highly recommend it to anyone who is curious about that secret operation and is not afraid of a little violence.",1486857600,2,524,4.965909090909091

The five survivors who were contractors for the CSI all participated in writing the book that this movie is based on, as well as being on set during the filming of the movie.

13 Hours surprised me. If you were to ask who I thought had directed it, Michael Bay would've been the furthest from my mind. The movie gets personal with the characters, developing their stories, their positions, and their camaraderie. The suspense continues to build, keeping you on edge until the conflict actually starts. Once the first shot is fired, it's an intense experience that gives you a taste of how scary it is to fight a in foreign land where you can tell the difference between the good guys and the bad. There's no excess of explosions, no out-of-place humor, and no fluff.

I will warn you, this is not for the faint of heart. There is blood, disembodiment, and language. That said, I highly recommend that everyone watch this movie. I'll probably watch it again this weekend.",1486771200,81,991,4.625

7552818,5,B018IDVB3U,"This is a good representation of what happened that fateful day, yet just a small idea of what those brave Americans actually went through and suffered having no response to their pleas for help. I've always found it extremely troubling why not one of those 30 people who made it out of CIA annex alive were interviewed by media when this was major news story and can only assume they were silenced by the same administration who wanted us to believe this was a ""spontaneous protest about a video"" when its evident this was well planned terrorist attack  that could have been stopped with adequate security Chris Stevens had  repeatedly requested from State Department.

There is little question by large gap in in Benghazi related emails Hillary turned over, her deleting 30,000 emails and wiping her server the moment Benghazi committee issued subpoena for that server, that this is massive cover-up by Obama administration. Not many people
know that filmmaker who made video they blamed for this attack actually spent a year in prison which tells you how serious they were in
diverting attention away from who was really responsible for the deaths of those 4 Americans and why they were denied help from the
same government who sent them to that hornet's nest when every other country had pulled their own people out weeks before.

How our government could have watched live footage of a deadly assault like that on their own people from a drone overhead and NOT
sent any help is something I can't even begin to comprehend.",1486684800,5,1526,4.835249042145594

7552822,5,B018IDVB3U,"I had read enough about the event to realize what I was getting into. However, outside of the event itself, the movie was truly beyond my expectations. John Krasinski, from the ""Office"" plays an amazing part. I was surprised by his performance in this movie. I truly felt that I would see ""the Office"" in this movie because of John but I have to say, he has quickly become an actor that I look forward to watching on more films. I pray that he becomes the next Tom Hanks, someone who can do a little comedy and a little drama and no one would be the wiser.
I also was impressed with the ability to remove politics. Yes, I had already formed my own opinion, but had a person had no idea of the event, this movie would do little to cause someone to point a finger or cause blame. The movie was about the 13 hours and that is it. The viewer can decide what they want.

Try actually being a decent individual and quit thinking that we are better than every one else.  Are we really free?  Or are we all just living for the almighty dollar.  Story and cast was the best I have ever seen and I would stand up for what I believe in.  I believe we should all take a look at what we think we are.  Don't judge people to make yourself feel better.  If you have indifferences don't be manipulative and dishonest to fit in.  Fight for what you believe in but don't disrespect and lie about other people and don't wreck everyone else or their life to get what you think your getting.

7553114,5,B018IDVB3U,"This was a really great movie.  It was fascinating from start to finish, and kept my attention.  The Bengazi fight was truly a hard and hairy experience, and showed that the attack was only a surprise to the State Department and lower level CIA managers who were not adequately communicated with or appraised of the situation.  Those men were heroes who fought against overwhelming odds and managed to prevail more than anyone would have thought possible.  They served their country well, despite the near non-existant support they received.  The effects of their lack of support was made obvious without anyone in the film having to pontificate at length, and was most realistic for that.

Despite the politics surrounding the events, it's still a solid film that remains rather neutral overall. Well, places the blame squarely onto the CIA as well as how messy ""intelligence"" is and remains. It was a boondoggle situation that should not have happened; the how and the why it shouldn't have happened, is up for endless debate. What always remains clear is... No matter the branch, everyone should have their back when someone calls for a ""broken arrow"" or a ""zulu"". There were failures up and down the chain-of-command and it started with Contractors vs CIA, their pissing contest.

7553362,5,B018IDVB3U,"It surprised me how quickly John Krasinski quit being Jim from the Office, and became a hardcore soldier.  I really thought he would dampen the seriousness and intensity of this movie (just a little anyway).",1486512000,3,207,4.914285714285715

7553365,5,B018IDVB3U,"I have watched this movie over and over.  I can't believe how incredibly brave these 6 GRS contractors were.  They tried to save the lives of Americans while our President and Secretary of State ignored the calls for help.  I believe no one had to die if only they would have let the jets do a fly over and they could have left the Annex when the first call for help came.  I firmly believe if the fly over had happened no mortars would have been fired and Ty and Glen would still be with us.  It hits me in the gut every time at the end when Tanto says ""Still no Americans"".  The movie makes you laugh at their interactions and it makes you cry at their bravery.  They rushed to the fight where others would have run away.  Just like the so called local security.  And the CIA people there came to appreciate why they needed the contractors if not for them they wouldn't have made it out alive.  Definitely a must see if you haven't seen it already.",1486512000,,950,4.198895027624309

7553370,4,B018IDVB3U,"Thought it was great. They presented the story without being political. Did a history v Hollywood fact check, and they were very true to actual events.",1486512000,,151,4.846153846153846

7553376,3,B018IDVB3U,"For a war movie,13 hours is cliche. Cliche characters, cliche dialog, cliche camera work, and above all cliche fireball explosions. As far as following the book that it is based on the script writer followed the chronology of the events but has mislead the audience in the places. Particularly with the CIA station chief ""Bob"" where the tension between him and the operators is overstated and his lines are made up when compared to the book. Beware of movies based on history, but are not actually history.",1486425600,,506,4.827586206896552

7553380,2,B018IDVB3U,"If they had not pretended this had anything to do with real events, it would have been fine as a childish action movie. I did fast forward to get it over. The cameraman was shaky to the point of annoyance, the explosions unrealistic and the characters plastic. That is great for Underworld, Sixth Sense, Judge Dredd or any of the various alien invasion movies.  As a story even suggested by real world events, Band of Brothers is a better use of your time. On a positive note, no extra charge to watch because I have Amazon Prime and it is included in the annual fee!",1486425600,,567,4.4

8742423,5,B018IDVB3U,"If you haven't seen this movie, you should. I believe that our current President is Donald Trump BECAUSE these soldiers were left to die by Hillary Clinton acting as Secretary of State. An uprising in one of the most dangerous cities in the world did not fit into hers and President Barack Obama's narrative leading into the 2012 election. By all accounts, including those that were there, they all should have died in the battle(s). God Bless the USA and her military protecting us all!",1536451200,,487,4.741176470588235
