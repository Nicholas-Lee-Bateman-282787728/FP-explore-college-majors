8056613,5,B000929V1S,"I sent this DVD (along with 6 other ""Big Bird"" DVDs) to a child who has never experienced Big Bird. She'll open them all up on Christmas Day - and I'm certain she won't be disappointed.",1354320000,3,185,4.166666666666667
8056614,5,B000929V1S,"My sister and I have been looking for this for YEARS--I was especially happy to be able to get it on DVD!

It works perfectly, and I absolutely couldn't beat the price. Thank you!",1254355200,4,179,4.264705882352941
8056615,5,B000929V1S,"If you love ""old school"" Sesame Street, you'll enjoy watching this with your child. I first discovered it at our local library, and after watching it once, I had to have a copy of my own. My favorite is seeing Kermit the Frog and his many ""misadventures"" while he reports the news. My two-year-old granddaughter quite enjoys this DVD, and she often requests ""Big Bird"" when I ask her what she wants to watch. I am not one to let kids watch too much television, but running about 30 minutes long, this DVD the perfect length and a top quality show. Thank you, Sesame Street!",1217116800,3,573,4.466666666666667
8056616,5,B000929V1S,My 7 month old loves this video. It calms him down before nap and bedtime. Fun for parents to watch too.,1208563200,2,104,4.0
8056617,5,B000929V1S,"Maria is my favourite of the Sesame Street humans.

It's good to see that everyone else,besides Big Bird,now knows that Snuffy truly does exist.

My favourite segment is The Three Little Pigs. I love the way the big bad wolf blows everything but the pigs'house away. Everything including Kermit and the clouds. A riot!

My second favourite is At Your Library.",1173830400,3,359,4.852459016393443
8056618,5,B000929V1S,My 5 year old son and 20 month old daughter loved this video.  The video includes Kermit the Frog as the reporter-which I loved as a child.  I love the combination of fairytales and Sesame Street!  Great video!,1159228800,3,210,4.473684210526316
