8690219,2,B00Q3ITC34,"Renae (Bouvier) who looks old enough to be a grandmother, inherits a nightclub from her grandfather. To make money she turns it into a lingerie club. Someone is killing off the models. Limited number of suspects.

The club is very small and they play crowd music to make it seem larger than the three customers we see in it. The camera and sound are not great and the acting is cheesy as are the lines.

8690220,1,B00Q3ITC34,Oh my this move sucked even on the B scale star rating. Nothing to see here folks! Keep moving along. I would go into detail but that's a lot of work for something that is this bad!,1466812800,2,181,3.918918918918919

8690222,1,B00Q3ITC34,I turned this off after about 5 minutes.  I knew it was going to be a waste of my time.  Horrible acting and grainy picture.  Nothing more to say.,1466467200,3,146,3.9655172413793105
8690223,1,B00Q3ITC34,To be perfectly honest- I am not sure what I expected... but I wish I had my time back.,1465776000,2,87,3.6315789473684212
8690224,4,B00Q3ITC34,"I agree with the other reviewer that this movie is a treat for those looking for cheap thrills. In fact, I wasn't expecting to like this movie as much as I did. Sure, it's low budget. Yes, it doesn't take itself seriously. But that's part of its charm. It has a slew of offbeat, eccentric characters, including the ""cult goddess"" Bouvier (the club's owner), a homeless girl on skid row, a hyper fire-and-brimstone preacher, a transvestite, a puppet/muppet, and a plethora of hot girls (one of my favorite ""hotties""--Sydney Raye--has a tantalizing strip tease to make her abusive boyfriend jealous). I was surprised that the ""lingerie girls"" had so much natural charisma on screen and were talented actresses. Yes, it's a ""murder-mystery,"" but it's actually a laugh-out-loud comedy that's a nod to the sleazy ""sexploitation"" films of the 60s and 70s. It's a throwback to the type of movies John Waters shot before he went ""mainstream."" It's not meant to be taken as a ""serious, highbrow, big-budget movie."" It's campy, exaggerated, fun, and outrageous. I thought it was a hoot!",1424563200,5,1076,4.983333333333333
8690225,3,B00Q3ITC34,"Oh well! At, least it's so bad it's good! And, I mean, plot,direction and execution are so muddled and quite juvenile, but the beauty of some of the girls, and some rare good acting (Domiziano Arcangeli always reliable but I wish to see in way better movies and roles), sets, costumes, colorful or over the top characterizations, or weird, unbelievable stretches, plot holes and dialog, make this one treat for all of those looking for cheap thrills and hard core underground fun! Over all, it's a miracle that all of this came together as a movie and not a spoof of one, I must tell you without a little dirty shame, was quite pleasantly entertained by the end of this comic romp enriched by horror and  ""Giallo"" bland references, while time went by quickly without using the fast forward device, which considered the over all insanely laughable intents, appeared to make of it quite a miracle.. No, perhaps, better, an experience !",1419465600,4,933,4.7592592592592595
