7818023,4,6301966694,"BOTTOM LINE: If you enjoy these numerous ROAD WARRIOR copycats then this one likely won't disappoint. It's got the requisite number of guns, babes and car stunts to keep you sufficiently entertained for its 80 minute runtime. I enjoyed it and consider it a worthwhile purchase with a decent replay value. 4 STARS

THE STORY: In the now desert wastelands of post-nuke Alaska, mankind has devolved into roving bands of semi-savage types who war over anything that strikes their fancy, more or less. A group who are trying to establish some system of law & order find themselves besieged at every turn by ruthless bandits who want their supplies and women. One man takes up the challenge to aid these law bringers in their quest. With the help of the village blacksmith, our hero forges a mighty weapon - cobbled together from at least five or six different guns - into a huge, bicep-straining superhowitzer: The Equalizer 2000.

THOUGHTS: Think of this film as ROAD WARRIOR meets WINCHESTER '73. One of the better Mad Max clones to rumble across movie screens, this effort was one of several such films shot in the Philippines and subsidized by the one & only Roger Corman. While the same basic cookie-cutter concept is repeated here as in Italy, these Phillippino-lensed post-nuke potboilers were often a cut above their Italian-made counterparts. The ""production values"" aren't much to speak of in any of these things. One of the reasons these made so much money was that the initial budgets were incredibly low. All you needed was access to an auto junkyard for your ""futuristic"" vehicles and wiping out every nearby Goodwill & garage sale for costumes. LOL. Star Richard (Gymkata!) Norton makes for a suitably rugged macho leading sort. Future T2 liquid metal assassin Robert Patrick makes a strong lieutenant villain here, showing that he had the intensity to be something more than a came & went actor. Drop-dead gorgeous 1982 Pet of the Year Corinne (Alphen) Wahl plays Karen, the feisty sort-of interest love for Norton. Although she never gets nude she flashes enough skin to keep your eyes glued, (and hopeful fingers crossed, LOL). The action is consistent and modestly energetic for a lowbuck flick of this caliber. It's a fun diversion and nowhere near as bad as many others in this 'burned-out Dodge Dart & flatblack spray-painted football pads' sub-genre. Director Cirio H. Santiago & scriptwriter Fred Bailey actually throw in a few interesting ideas as well, including an inspiring finale that I honestly didn't see coming and found quite refreshing.

THE BLU-RAY: Code Red Pictures has had a wobbly success ratio with their home video product. EQUALIZER 2000, I am happy to say, is one of their better efforts. The picture is fairly solid and mostly clean, all things considered. Sound is LOUD and that is no exaggeration. Some decent extras top off this release.",1451520000,6,2879,4.956521739130435

An excellent movie. Richard Norton delivers in this post-apocolyptic thriller that is very similar to the Mad Max movies with Mel Gibson.

Norton is highly under-rated as an actor. Great story line and high-adrenaline action for a low-budget flick.",1237420800,2,255,5.35
7818025,3,6301966694,"this ""road warrior"" rip-off is one of those movies that takes it's self so seriously that it is very funny and in a strange way that makes it a hoot to watch. the title gun is made by our hero richard norton(a co-star in many kung-fu movies) and it is a piece of work(i call it the swiss army gun because it has so many different guns and things built into it) and he uses it to protect a smll clan of people after the world has almost killed it's self off. silly and pointless but a real hoot if you like this sort of thing(and i do).check it out!!!",1151452800,3,550,4.009090909090909
