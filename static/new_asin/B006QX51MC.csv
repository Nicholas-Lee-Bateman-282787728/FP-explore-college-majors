8503391,5,B006QX51MC,"I ordered 4 winter living art DVD'S and this one is my favorite. It has relaxing winter snow scenes, and  I love having the choice of either Christmas music or just relaxing music to use throughout the entire winter season. Both of the instrumental musical options are beautiful, and set the relaxing tone for the scenes. It is great to use as living art for your TV, to relax or set the mood for Christmas, or to use as a background for parties or when friends visit. The music is so good, they have included a CD as well that I might use in my car, since I prefer the DVD at home. My only criticism is that sometimes the video looks black and white, simply because they use mostly clouldy snow days without much color; However, when there is sun, there is color. I love seeing the actual forest snowfall, snowy flowing streams over rocks, mountain peaks with blue sky, and the incredible waterfall scenes with snow and ice! Also, this is video, not still shots. Really you can't go wrong ordering this DVD/CD combo, I just love it!",1385596800,4,1033,4.436842105263158

8503393,4,B006QX51MC,"So nice to have both DVD and CD, I found myself using both equally. It is easy to get mesmerized by the winter scenes. The CD is a rare find that allows you to focus on other things, but provides a pleasant background to be or to do.",1356220800,3,233,3.875
