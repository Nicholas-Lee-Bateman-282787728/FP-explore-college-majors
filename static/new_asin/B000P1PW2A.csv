2807178,1,B000P1PW2A,"Just as it is called in Spanish, this is a complete "" CHURRO "". No disrespect to Alejandro Fernandez, I truly believe he is a great actor, but how dare they make a movie about Emiliano Zapata, and portray him as someone who he never was. Respect should exist to heroes. The story is really dumb, there is no logical in the sequence or no true message in this film, not to mention some stupid witches that come out and disappear, this is why our cinema is not considered seriously. Avoid this film. I'm sorry if you don't like what you read, but it's true. Save your money and time. I hope Alejandro has another chance to prove he is a great actor.",1200614400,,647,4.2682926829268295
2807179,5,B000P1PW2A,"This is by far one of the most beautifully filmed movies I have ever seen! I cannot believe this is not one of the most popular films ever. Alejandro Fernandez gives a stunning performance and I really cannot say enough about it, you must see this film. I only have it because I saw it in Mexico where it was extremely popular.",1188432000,,327,4.290322580645161

8188163,5,B000P1PW2A,a lot better than I expected this movie to be.,1410134400,2,46,3.7
8188164,4,B000P1PW2A,"The film is colorful and well-done.  I enjoyed some of the indigenous scenes showing locals celebrating festivals in the old pre-Columbian way.  Zapata--despite legends to the contrary--was not an Indio.  He was mestizo although he may have spoken Nahuatl.  The film shows how people with a certain quality--generalship in Zapata's case--can be completely out of their element in another situation.  Zapata wasn't a sophisticated man and the politicos ate him for lunch.

Also, although it may seem attenuated, there is the old Mexican issue to gun possession.  Zapata made his revolution via an armed peasantry.  As soon as the revolution was 'won' and the new political class installed, the guns were seized.  After all, this revolution thing might become a nasty habit.  Such it has been in Mexico since.

Politicos, police and carteles, rob the people blind and sometimes kill them.  It's easy because the people have lost the ability to defend themselves.",1372377600,,960,5.2026143790849675
8188165,5,B000P1PW2A,Good film love the director and love the actor not only does he know how to sing but acted well and his first starting role. It is a sad film but the history is right on.,1355097600,,170,3.75
8188166,5,B000P1PW2A,"I must say this is a truly great movie.  It weaves the known facts of the great Mexican Hero Emiliano Zapata with a surrealistic environment set during the Mexican Revolution to give it the look and feel of a dream.  Yes, it has witches speaking to him but this is only to tie him to his indigenous roots and to narrate the story to the viewer, similarly to the use of witches by Williams Shakespeare in Macbeth.  The reviewer who called this story a ""churro"" not only  did a disservice to a great movie but to many people out there that will never see this great movie because of insensitive and obtuse remarks.  Give this movie a chance, you will be glad you did!",1317513600,,665,4.330645161290323
8188167,5,B000P1PW2A,I purchased the cd a couple of years ago and really liked it. It's taken me several years to find this DVD and I wasn't disappointed. Good acting. The scenery was great.  You won't be disappointed.,1314403200,,197,4.472222222222222
