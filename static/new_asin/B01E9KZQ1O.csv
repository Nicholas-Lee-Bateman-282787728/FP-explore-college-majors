8758126,5,B01E9KZQ1O,Amazing movie. The entire family loved it. Beware: you need a European or unlocked Blue-ray player to play this disc.,1525478400,,117,4.9
8758127,4,B01E9KZQ1O,"This was quite good. The premise is simple: they are all such good friends that they have nothing to hide. So they can all put their phones out on the dinner table and listen and watch every single thing on everyone's phone which comes in. The only incredible thing about this is that by the end it is hard to believe that anyone agreed to this as everyone had way too much to hide. It is interesting to see all of their secrets unfold. I was actually more interested in the segments that were not about marital infidelity. Thus, one spouse getting info on a rest home for the other's parent (who is living with them) and the 17 year old daughter calling her father to say that this may be the night she loses her virginity and she found the condoms he'd put in her purse.

The phone call between the father and the daughter is lovely. No one else had a lovely moment. One thing that did surprise me was that with all the infidelity going on, they all managed to forget about it within about half an hour and get back to the usual. I am going to assume that is a cultural difference; that perhaps the Italians do take infidelity in daily stride. For the one person who is exposed as gay though, that the Italians certainly do not take in stride.

I enjoyed it but I would have preferred a few more major problems that were not marital infidelity. There are other serious problems which people do keep secret from one another. But it was otherwise a fresh and interesting film.",1519776000,,1476,4.344202898550725
8758128,5,B01E9KZQ1O,"Perfect Strangers (or Perfetti sconosciuti under its original Italian title), is a nice simple movie, that starts off a bit slow, but when it's over you end up thinking, gee that was really good.  99% of the movie is set in a small apartment mostly around a dining table, with pretty much just seven actors. There's a teenage daughter character we see and voices of others on the phones from time to time but most of the movie we're just watching seven people, consisting of three middle aged couples and a man who was supposed to bring his new girlfriend too for them to meet, but arrives without her claiming she has a fever. They all plan on having a nice meal, which they have done countless times before over their long friendships and to watch a lunar eclipse  This isn't an action film, comedy or anything like that. It's more of a drama, occasionally the embarrassment of the character or the situation will be amusing or even make you laugh though.  If you don't like movies which are primarily people sitting or standing and talking, (in the case of an Italian spoken subtitled in English text on the screen movie that means for the viewer a lot of reading), then this isn't the movie for you.  But if you don't mind reading a good film, you won't be disappointed with Perfect Strangers.

The basic premise of this film is that after the topic of mobile phones and social media's rudeness and other interruptions that now plague social interactions and society in general (remember these characters are old enough to have socialised before this technology was around), one of the group comes up with a joke of a suggestion for a game, that they should put all their mobile devices on the table during their dinner and if anyone rudely interrupts their meal through a phone call, text message, Facebook message, e-mail, or whatever the case may be, it will be shared with the group.  Everyone reads it, or the caller is put on speaker phone.  The caller can not be told they are on speaker.  I don't think it is a spoiler to tell you, obviously this doesn't turn out to be a good idea, otherwise we wouldn't have much of a movie.  Everyone at the dinner has secrets, and they are not all what their partners or friends are happy to learn.

As I said as the movie gets going it moves from being a little not that interesting at the start to really good. I thought the acting was really good. There (slight spoiler) is an incident where two of the characters in this secretly switch phones where it seemed a little bit ridiculous that one character wouldn't just say, actually we switched phones rather than let the impact of a wrongful belief the caller was referring was them, impact their relationship.  Perhaps it was protecting a friend that you maybe valued more than your relationship, perhaps wanting to see how the partner really would react to learn more about them.  It didn't seem plausible to me you'd keep the mistaken belief going for as long as it does.

If you want a good movie, you won't go wrong with Perfect Strangers",1501718400,,3045,4.565137614678899
8758129,5,B01E9KZQ1O,"Watched this film on our flight back to the States from Rome.  I loved it!  It started out ho-hum, but immediately became more intense.  Loved the story line and the characters.  What a great ending!  Great entertainment.  Made me forget I hadn't slept for 28 hours and was cramped in an airplane economy seat.  The hours flew by.  LOL!",1499385600,,336,4.576271186440678
8758130,5,B01E9KZQ1O,"Three couples, a single man. they will meet around a friendly dinner. One of them will trigger a risky idea: to let all the people listen and read mesaages and calls around every i-phone. But what it begins as an innocent experiment will become a terrible set of unfortunate events. good acting and emotional tension all the way through.

Watch it!!!",1497744000,,350,4.737704918032787
8758131,5,B01E9KZQ1O,"Excellent film
Surprised it has not make a big splash in this country, at least in the more adventurous theaters",1497225600,2,112,4.65
8758132,1,B01E9KZQ1O,The DVD is for Region 2 ( Europe ) and not Region 1 ( USA ) - So it can not be played by the receiver,1496188800,3,101,2.923076923076923
8758133,4,B01E9KZQ1O,"Saw it in a theater. A very nice comedy with occasional diversion into real drama. Seven old friends get together for dinner. One suggests that since they have nothing to hide from each other (including spouses), they will put all their cell phones on the table and everybody can hear the conversations or read the messages. Oh well, as could have been expected, everybody has secrets, some minor, some darker. The idea turns from a lark to a series of crises among friends and for each couple. Overall, since 95% of the movie happens in the flat of the hosting couple, it is more of a filmed theater than a movie in a classical sense. Like in a theater performance, the impact on the audience depends heavily on acting, directing, and more than anything else, on dialog. The acting is very good, the directing mostly competent to good, and the dialog well written and very well delivered. Still, I was slightly disappointed- the movie opted for facile light comedy and even farce and away from trying to cope with the psychology and sociology of human behavior. One can see the petty and the lage lies, one can lough, snicker, censor, even commiserate - but one does not get any in-depth sense why do we do what we do. Nice sophisticated entertaiment",1494979200,2,1251,4.665158371040724
8758134,1,B01E9KZQ1O,Does it play on a regular dvd plyer NTSC or is it only PAL?,1494547200,,59,3.2857142857142856
8758135,3,B01E9KZQ1O,"The plot is terrific. Friends agree to share the info that arrives on their cell phones with everyone at the table. Unfortunately the truth behind their secrets and lies are exposed. A weird ending though. I'm not sure if the ending was forgiveness or a the end of a fantasy of ""what If this happened.""",1494460800,2,302,4.509090909090909
