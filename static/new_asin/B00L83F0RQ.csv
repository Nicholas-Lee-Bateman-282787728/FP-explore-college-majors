6473731,4,B00L83F0RQ,"If your a fan of The Equalizer you probably already own season one and, after six long years, getting season two is high on your list, but if your like me and don't want to wait any longer for the individual releases of seasons three and four, you should get this collection, that is if you can afford it. Of course buying the sets individually will save you money in the long run, but when VEI chooses to release the remaining seasons is another question. Besides offering all 88 episodes of The Equalizer you also get as a bonus the complete series of CI5: The New Professionals, a short-lived show which aired in 1999 that also starred Edward Woodward and lasted only 13 episodes. You also have the last movie Woodward did called ""A Congregation of Ghosts"" from 2009. Carried over from the region 4 release is a 45 minute documentry about the making of The Equalizer. It includes interviews with Keith Szarabjaka, William Zabka, co-producer Coleman Luck and co-executive producer Robert Eisele. They talk about, among other things, the casting of Woodward, an intended cross-over episode with Magnum PI and, of course, Woodward's heart-attack during season 3 and bringing in Richard Jordan and Robert Mitchum. There's also an image gallery which is about 2 minutes long. Carried over from the 2008 release of season 1 is the commentary by Michael Sloan for the pilot episode.

Lastly VEI has included a rather pointless booklet which serves only to offer short biographies of Woodward, Szarabjaka and Zabka. It also contains a few images of notable guest stars like Kevin Spacey, Macaulay Culkin, John Goodman, Christian Slater and Ving Rhames. Other stars who made appearances on the show include Steve Buscemi, Laurence Fishburne, Jennifer Grey, Michael Wincott, James Remar and William H. Macy. VEI has done an alright job with this boxset, but don't expect any cleaned up or remastered picture, you'll see plenty of dirt and grain in these episodes. A notable mistake on the backs of all the seasons is the misspelling of Stewart Copeland's first name (Steward), although they spell it right in the booklet. And the biggest, most WTF foul-up on this set occurs during season 3 with ""The Mystery of Manon"" 2-parter, VEI somehow managed to mix-up the order of these two episodes so that part 2 appears before part 1. Now this might not be that big of a problem if the two episodes appeared on the same disc, but they don't. Hopefully VEI will fix this problem before season 3 is released individually.",1410739200,138,2506,4.855140186915888

6473745,5,B00L83F0RQ,"A great series at a great price. Edward Woodward (""Breaker Morant,"" ""The Wicker Man"") ,is one of my all-time favorite actors. In the 1960s in Britain, he became a sensation playing the anti-Bond, a tortured man named ""Callan,"" whose only talent was killing. He was so impressive that Laurence Olivier hired him for the Royal Shakespeare Company. Then, after making the two iconic movies, he came to the US to star in ""The Equalizer"" on CBS TV. I wanted to buy the complete series, but it was $109 in the US. There was also a set with all 88 shows from VEI, an Australian company, for only $29 listed on Amazon, so I took a chance. While I have an all-region DVD player, it's in our living room and my wife prefers reality TV. but these DVDs work just fine on the US DVD player in my ""man cave,"" which was an extra special bonus. So many excellent actors were guest stars on that show, including the great Robert Mitchum, who was one of the few actors of Woodward's caliber. He and Richard Jordan came in to help Woodward, who had suffered a heart attack. At the end of that special two-part show, the final scene with Woodward and Mitchum is as good as any movie moment I've ever seen. Actors at their pre-stardom level appeared on the show and it's fun seeing them so young while there were also some truly impressive established names who added class to their episodes. The revolving cast of supporting players Is top-notch. ""The Equalizer"" never seems to lack star power and the writing is first rate. The formula may be simple, but it's what the creative team does with it that makes it so special. The same kind of quality control that elevates Brtish programs is very much evident in this series that has stood the test of time. ""The Rockford Files"" is the only American series that stands up to it in my opinion. I can't stop watching ""The Equalizer!""",1517875200,,1858,4.5
6473746,5,B00L83F0RQ,Edward Woodward was born to play this role.  I watched every episode when it first came out.  Considering the source for these DVD's they are Remarkable.,1517875200,,153,4.846153846153846

6473748,3,B00L83F0RQ,I never saw this when it was new on tv....Have only watched a few segments.....very repetative story lines that probably didn't bother viewers that watched show on weekly basis but bothered me watching consecutive shows.  Good and sometimes well known actors in it but still cannot watch on a binge basis.,1517097600,,305,4.980392156862745
6473749,5,B00L83F0RQ,"I suppose the ideal review is 50% about the show and 50% about the quality of the DVD, packaging, etc.  Well in this case, ""The Equalizer"" is so great as a show, that they could have mailed it in Ziploc bags and it would get five stars.  Sorry, I just think everything Edward Woodward touched instantly became magic. And the directing and Stewart Copeland music made this thing nigh unto perfect for ""80's TV.",1516492800,10,409,4.513513513513513

6473752,4,B00L83F0RQ,"This was a great series when I was growing up. Smart thinking, witty comments, and decent acting for back then. Plenty of action to keep you in twined in the episodes.

Just a guy who wants to make New York a safer place.",1513382400,2,347,4.523809523809524
6473753,5,B00L83F0RQ,"I had forgotten how good this series was. Edward Woodward is an excellent choice for the spy/vigilante type with the British voicing. So many actors from the 80's in this one. Even Robert Mitchum jumps into the scene for a few episodes. The DVD 4:3 playback is fine, although some may find it a bit ""dark"" overall.... You get the music and feel of the 80's.. Just a wonderful series with very few episodes worth passing.  If available under 30..its a no brainer,,",1511827200,,463,4.578313253012048

6473758,5,B00L83F0RQ,"A retired spook helps people out. This was a fun show to watch. There were several threads weaved throughout the episodes, the main one of course was Robert McCall and how he left the Agency and wants to help people. He often relies on a group of Agency free-lancers that sometimes use Agency resources to help McCall. A 2nd theme is between McCall and his son Scott. Both want the relationship but its tenuous at first. In short order Scott understands his father better and vice-versa. A 3rd relationship that works its way out through the end is the relationship between McCall and Control (his former boss). Another relationship is between McCall and his daughter that he never knew he had.

If you get a chance buy & watch the series. Seasons 1,3 & 4 averaged about 1.2GB per episode while Season 2 was 1.7GB per episode. I watched the entire series on a 480i TV set which is how the show was intended to be watched on. Richard Jordon starred on 10 episodes about the time that Edward Woodward had a heart attack. His was a memorable roll especially in the episode titled Christmas Presence which is about a group of men who terrorize a young boy because he has AIDS.

The show was picked up for a 5th season, but due to an issue with CBS in which the network had to be pick up one show and dump another, The Equalizer got the axe.",1509062400,4,1336,4.4048582995951415

6473767,4,B00L83F0RQ,"A bit dated, and with Miami Vice style music. But Edward Woodward is truly excellent in this roll. He IS the eqalizer!! If it were made today it would be much better. They tried to squeeze two clients in per episode instead of developing one story line more in depth. The script writing and the stories are decent, but Woodward is the real reason this show was so popular. Too bad he wasn't about ten years younger when he did this show. But he is still very effective, with his English Shakespeareian delivery. A great voice.",1503014400,2,526,4.489583333333333

Then Season 4 has 1 disc with 1 unwatchable episode.  Same thing, couldn't watch it on either player.  I have occasionally seen bad DVD's but 2 in one package is inexcusable.

6473814,4,B00L83F0RQ,"This is a review for the $29.99 Equalizer Complete Collection set that was released by VEI on October 27, 2016.  The Equalizer is one of my favorite shows. However, I hesitated purchasing The Complete Series when it was released by VEI a few years ago after reviews of bad discs, etc. and the price.  Recently, I've been wanting to get this show on DVD so I would check amazon to see if they had a deal and to my surprise VEI released a complete series set for only $29.99 last week. The other set is around $60 I think.  It was a deal I couldn't refuse so I bought it.  Ordered it on Friday, was delivered to me on Monday.  First thing I did was check the discs and I had no problems at all. There is a difference between this complete series set and the previous ones though. I believe the other sets had 6 discs for each season while the new set has 4 discs per season. That means half of the discs now have 5 episodes on a disc and the other half has 6 episodes per disc. Except for Season 2 for some reason which was 6 Discs although that could have been an error on their part, but I'm not complaining. The video quality isn't bad at all. The episodes appear to be complete minus some music replacement which I'm sure has already been mentioned by other reviewers. I've posted the running times below.  Only problem with this set was on the back it says there is The Story of The Equalizer bonus feature and it doesn't seem to be on any of the discs. Also the commentary on the pilot isn't here like it is on other sets, but bonus features aren't a deal breaker for me.

Everything was fine till I got to the season three set. I discovered it was missing disc four and instead had a second disc two!!!

Apparently they hired MONKEYS to pack and ship these discs from the factory!!! They must've hired more MONKEYS to staff their QC department too!!!

Sadly, I'll be returning this set. I'll try again, because I LOVE The Equalizer that much! Hopefully the next set will be fine.

6473838,5,B00L83F0RQ,"Loving the memories of this series. The episodes have good story plots, several of which I've seen retailored on Law and Order, Walker, and other series. Edward Woodward is riveting to watch as the Equalizer. Each episode features actors who rose in prominence, such as Jennifer Grey, Kevin Spacey, William H. Macy, John Goodman, Lori Loughlin, Michael Moriarity, Macauley Culkin, Ving Rhames, and more. Interesting to see them mid '80s. Love the music.

I like Seasons 1 & 2 the best, which have plots about helping individuals in need who call on the Equalizer's help. Season 3 had a great two-part intro starring Robert Mitchum and Richard Jordan. Jordan stepped in for most of the season when Woodward was recovering from a heart attack so you see very little of Woodward and also not much of Kostmeyer.. Season 3 and 4 follow socially relevant themes like spousal abuse, bigotry, etc, which give you a good view of how these issues were treated in the 80s. A bit too preachy for me, but still good plots. Some of the Season 3 and 4 episodes feature bubblegum background sound music - mostly like piano notes or new age stuff, which is extremely annoying. The series ended with Season 4 and the last few episodes went back to the winning strategy of the type of plots from the first two seasons. Love The Equalizer's two main helpers - Kostmeyer and Jimmy. Kostmeyer (Keith Szarabajka) was a favorite actor to watch.

There's a fifth disc on the first and only season of CI5 - The New Professionals which features Woodward as the head of a British CI5 intelligence unit with three young actors doing the gruntwork. The plots are very good, very well thought out - again, some I have seen retailored on later TV series.  But I dislike the music. There is also Woodward's last film, Congregation of Ghosts, on the fifth disc. Very much like a PBS movie; really enjoyed it.

All in all, I'm very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend it.",1466121600,6,1948,4.687134502923977
6473839,5,B00L83F0RQ,"I enjoyed the originals on Sunday evenings in the late 1980s.  My 14 year old son watches these with me now.  The right amount of action, good story lines, excellent cinematography.  Plots generate discussions on moral choices.  It gives my son some history on life in the 1980s on technology, the Cold War, and views of NYC that still included the Twin Towers.",1465689600,,361,4.682539682539683

6473841,5,B00L83F0RQ,"The 1970's and 80's were a dismal time for quality dramas. The art of storytelling was near an all time low - which is kinda funny as an actor moved into the White House. The Equalizer was one of those exceptional few gems which stood above the rest. Timely social issues, talented actors, and editing used as a tool to further the story rather than simply squeezing entertainment into the time slot. And shooting in and around NYC - unheard of! A shame that the film remake was so poorly crafted, as this would be a great series to resurrect the way Battlestar Galactica was.",1465171200,4,576,4.495238095238095

The actor in this well put together movie is stellar in his ability to carry out his role as Mr. Mc Call. The format of how this movie was put together in the time of the year it came out was simply awesome in its performance, as a different kind of action movie.

Unfortunately for our children, it brought about the birth of the truly sad anti-hero- the twisted, sick or criminally insane heroes such as Tony Soprano, Dexter, Raymond Reddington and the ilk.  Imagine.... we were raised on Gunsmoke and Bonanza and the Brady Bunch-we had hope that good would triumph evil, virtue would be rewarded and evil would vanquish.  How sad it must be to have those Sopranos, Dexter, Black List shows in your childhood background.  No wonder Millennial's have no hope!

6473865,3,B00L83F0RQ,"First of all: about the series itself: *Love it!*  I was actually more than pleased with the overall viewing quality of the DVDs and really impressed at how good the show is--even after all these years--throughout the show.  The show really didn't seem as dated as I feared it might and did not seem ""campy"" to me at all (which I can't say for a few far more modern shows I've re-watched).  Perhaps it's because technology wasn't the main focus of the show, but I think it actually holds up well.  I found some of the guest-star appearances to be surprisingly delightful.  The viewing quality of the episodes is probably around about what you would have expected for over-the-air TV in the 80s, so it's really not that bad. I only noticed a few visual pops and blips and some slight darkened vignetting around a couple of scenes.  What I was *not* impressed with was the actual DVDs.  Even though none of the DVDs were loose on arrival, some of the discs were pretty scratched.  There was some skipping playback.  I'm not sure if the culprit is badly manufactured DVDs, or sealant emulsion, or what, but ('m not an uber-techie type)... It's a bit disappointing, because I'm worried about how well the dinged DVDs are going to hold up for future viewing.  This is one series I probably will re-watch--at least once.  .

On the extras... I found the Interview disc very poignant. I enjoyed CI5, even though it did seem a bit dated.  _A Congregation of Ghosts_ was very sad, but Woodward gave a really poignant, passionate performance.  The booklet was interesting, but didn't have much meat to it for super passionate fans.  The packaging was good.  The outer box is pretty sturdy, our hinge is as bit wobbly, but mass-production and all.  The discs are divided by season (1-4) in plastic cases within.  CI5, the interview disc, and _A Congregation of Ghosts_ are in the last case.

Overall, I'm glad I bought this set.  However, I'm really glad I didn't give over $200 for this, the original ""asking price"" for this set when I first looked it up.  I don't think I'll be getting either VEI collection I was looking at (two other longer running television series) because they're very expensive for old shows.  Given the manufacturing quality and scratches on these DVDs... I'm just not going to take a chance.",1452211200,9,2307,4.672456575682382

However, I really don't like his son in this show and pretty much dislike all of the episodes that included him.  The son is in his 20s but acts so immature and his relationship (or lack of) with his father often dominates the episodes he is in.

I guess I only remembered the really good episodes that did not include his son and as such bought this set; enjoying Season 1 but giving up on Season 2 and later because of the son's inclusion that detracts from the interesting parts of the episodes.",1451520000,,660,4.43801652892562

6473879,5,B00L83F0RQ,...when this will be out of print and become overpriced. I gave it a 5 stars because of the content and representation. You get all complete episodes nothing is missing. The remastering is commendable you get a clear picture and sound. It comes in a big clamshell box surrounded with photos and information. The case itself can hold firmly all 6 DVDs without any fear of them falling off the case and in it are summary of each episode. The downside is no subtitles though the sound is clear a reason for not having it for those who are auditory challenged but if you are totally impaired no way you can enjoy the show. The first DVD is the only one with a special feature an audio commentary and the rest has none. The 5th or bonus dvd is irrelevant it contains the making of the Equalizer which can be included in any of the disc. The C15 new professional episodes with Edward Woodward is totally revolting and avoid it by all means! The movie congregation of ghost saves the bonus disc from disaster. Watch it from the start and you will be moved by this drama and Edward Woodward delivered an award winning performance. There is a complete version at a lesser price and without the bonus disc and not in a box clamshell but if you want to have  Woodward apart from the Equalizer this box set is for you.,1439424000,6,1306,4.396694214876033
6473880,5,B00L83F0RQ,Everything played fine and was packaged good!  I had playback issues with 2 episodes but I think they had to do with my DVD Burner because when I switched the 2 discs to another drive those 2 episodes played fine!  For the age of this series this turned out better then I expected it would!  I grew up watching this show as a kid and have been waiting for a long time to have it released on DVD!  The case that houses the complete season discs was also better then I expected it to be.

I have only gotten into the first CD, but the quality is excellent, especially so given that the series ran from 1986-1989. so any existing recordings are likely to have glitches. Unlike some renderings of the show, the music is by Stewart Copeland, and is as I remember it. I will update this as I watch later episodes.

I expect some problems from the disclaimer that this is a 1980s television show recorded to higher fidelity DVD media on a modern television, but the problems I'm complaining about go beyond what a person should reasonably expect.

One of the disks is not even recognizable as a recorded DVD and one of the episodes has so many skips that the entire episode is unwatchable.  I've ordered a new set of DVDs in case this was just an unusually bad copy, but at the moment I cannot recommend the product.
---
This is an update after ordering a second set.  The new set of DVDs has problems too.  One of the episodes in season 4 is completely unwatchable because the DVD player goes from skip to skip to skip.  They also messed up and included two disk #6 from season 4 instead of including disk #5, so I don't even have a proper complete set.

Unfortunately the period for returns expired yesterday, so I am stuck with these $80 drink coasters.

It also appears that the Season 3 disc problems were addressed (at least on my copies). Disc 4 functioned perfectly, and the episodes were in the correct order (including the part 1 Mannon episode at the end of Disc 4, and the part 2 Mannon episode at the start of disc 5). Neither did I have any of the ""Main Menu"" or ""Play All"" issues mentioned in previous reviews.  Thanks for listening, VEI.

6473929,4,B00L83F0RQ,"I'm not quite through the series (will update once I am) on DVD, but I've already noticed a few things.  First off, I love the series (would give it a 5).  The DVDs are quite good (considering the age of the recordings), but I have noticed a few issues most of the way through 3 seasons.  First off, if you hit ""play all,"" the intros (what precedes the theme song) to the episodes are not played--except in a few instances where it is the first episode on that disc.  Often the intros are just a summary of scenes from the episodes, but on a few occasions it is actually the start of the episode.  Also, on a few episodes, there seems to be issues with the DVDs that I have where a scene freezes up or skips a few seconds.  Thankfully if I rewind or fast forward it, I have been able to watch the skipped/frozen sections, but I still didn't like the problem.  So far the last big issue I've found (at least on my DVDs) is that the ""Mystery of Manon"" (not ""Memories of Manon"") parts one and two are mislabeled.  So what is labeled part one of the episode is actually part two and vice versa.  Since these episodes are on different discs, that means that you have to go through the whole intro for the disc (VEI, warnings about video quality, etc.) to watch once you change discs back and forth.  I was glad that both episodes are included, even if mislabeled--for a moment I worried that they had just put part two in the package twice though I decided to check what was supposed to be episode two before letting myself get too worried.

[Update 3/31/15:  I have now watched all the seasons and the DVD issues seemed to mainly be with the earlier seasons.  I started watching the other show included on the extra DVD and now wish that I had just ordered the complete Equalizer instead of this limited edition which includes ""The New Professionals.""  EW is, as always, great, but the show is pretty horrible.  I may never watch all the episodes because it was so bad.  I did, however, enjoy the interviews about ""The Equalizer,"" though it is sad that they didn't do the interviews before EW passed away, so we don't get to hear from him.]
2nd update (8/21/15):  With my new blu-ray player, I had no freeze-ups in the first two seasons (I have not yet watched the final 2 seaons on the new player) though the little imperfections of the picture were a bit more noticeable and the overall picture was sharper.  I also didn't notice the intros being cut off with my new player.",1421798400,122,2472,4.37199124726477

6473933,3,B00L83F0RQ,"I bought season I when it first came out.  Very excited as I'd missed the original 1st episode though I saw all of the others.  I'd recently purchased season 2 but hadn't got around to watching yet, what with the holidays, Sweeps weeks before that.

When I saw the complete collection, I was going to return the unopened season two, and spend the money for THE EQUALIZER COMPLETE COLLECTION LIMITED EDITION until I saw there were no closed captions or subtitles.

Many of us who were around for the original airing are getting on in years, and to comfortably watch a show these days, require CC or Subs to get all of the dialogue.  Granted I knew Season one didn't have them, but I figured they were testing the waters before spending the money and releasing the subsequent season.  Visiting VEI's website, I saw that they have released seasons 2-4 and this complete collection, however, they had not availed themselves of the modern technology,  which could easily have incorporated CC or subtitles.

VEI, if you monitor the reviews, you'll note I'm not the only one talking about this deficit. If you release a BluRay version, repackage or reissue the current version, figure this into your planning, the market you'd be after are the same people who bought the current versions so you'll need to offer something extra.  Gaining new buyers  you'd need to ask yourself what kept some of these buyers from purchasing the first time around.  From personal experience, I can honestly say for me it's the lack of CC and subtitles.

Addendum:  I've been reading from other reviewers that there seems to be a consistent problem with season 2 and a two part episode is reversed.  VEI, here's your chance to rectify a short coming.

Besides the hearing impaired, another market you are missing out on is people whose 1st language isn't English.  I've had lots of clients who used TV shows to learn conversational and everyday English from turning on the CC or Subtitles.",1421020800,6,1963,4.7804154302670625

If your unfamiliar with the Equalizer its basically ""James Bond meets Death Wish"" where Edward Woodward attempts to help others in trouble to atone for the 'dirty deeds' he performed as a Spy for the US during his career. I read others comments about missing CC/subtitles which is a HUGE issue for me on all the movies/TV shows I buy due to my poor hearing.

Disk 4 The Mystery of Manon (part 1) is actually part 2, and Disk 5 Part 2 is actually part 1, so if you want to watch in the correct sequence, you have to keep juggling the disks and put up with all the pre play garbage repeatedly.

Since Universal was mainly a movie company, they filmed the series on their 35mm widescreen Panavision movie cameras and then they used their pan and scan equipment to make a 4:3 aspect ratio print for airing on standard TV in the 80s. In 2006, the Universal HD cable TV channel re-aired the series from broadcast tapes made from the original 35mm wide screen prints so what you saw on TV was a 16:9 aspect ratio and 1080i HD resolution image. I saw it and it was so clear that when they ran a scene filmed in Times Square, you could read the movies titles from the marquees of every movie theater on Broadway at the time!

6473959,5,B00L83F0RQ,"The Long Awaited Release of The Equalizer the Complete Series is FABULOUS! The sound is now Dolby quality. The picture is the same as was on TV. Marvelous collection with an additional DVD of extras. Go to the VEI.com site for great information on this fabulous DVD collection. This was obviously released to coincide with the Denzel Washington ""Equalizer"" film which is a shabby recollection of this award-winning TV program. I'm a big fan of the great Edward Woodward. This collection also has the last film he made right before his death. Check out the VEI site you'll be glad you did.",1412294400,41,588,4.7745098039215685
6473960,2,B00L83F0RQ,"This complete series (with extra items) does not have closed captions or subtitles according to the info about the set on the VEI website--
that lack of captioning is a big negative to me--since I have had hearing loss--I need to see as well as ""hear"" the dialogue. And for a set that is supposed to offer ""more"" then the omission of closed captions is more glaring than omitting Woodhouse's final movie...",1411862400,21,406,4.652777777777778
6473961,5,B00L83F0RQ,"What wonderful news that finally the complete seasons of the Equalizer is now being released.  However, disappointed at the price since anyone who is a fan of this series already owns season one.  Too bad we cannot buy 2-4 individually as well.",1411689600,20,244,4.785714285714286
6473962,5,B00L83F0RQ,"Great show. Edward Woodward fits this role perfect and the writing and action are as interesting as you would want from that time period. If you have the first two seasons it is a stretch to pay the $100.  Give those away to a friend or family member who might need a introduction to this show, and buy the box set. VEI  THANK YOU for finally bringing out this set.",1411171200,25,365,4.2

8664232,4,B00L83F0RQ,"First, 5 stars for the show, because come on, it's The Equalizer!  Everyone who grew up watching this will get nostalgic.  Video transfer is actually pretty good for the age of the show.  I had to delete 1 star for audio quality though, as the audio level varies WILDLY within each episode.  For example, there is speech and then background music cuts in so loudly that you cannot hear the speech without cranking the volume way up and blasting your ears.",1531440000,,455,4.580246913580247
8664233,5,B00L83F0RQ,"What makes this show so good is that its lead actor, Edward Woodward, is so consistently good no matter how bad some of the individual episodes are. I don't know how Woodward got involved with this show, but it's good for him and the show that he took it so earnestly.

The show itself has an odd premise. McCall, Woodward's character, is a retired CIA operative whose specialty was overthrowing foreign governments unsympathetic to American foreign policy. In each episode, McCall either helps people from his previous life as a CIA killer, or else he helps average private citizens overwhelmed by crime and corruption. One message of the show is that US government policy focuses too much on foreign policy and not enough on domestic policy. McCall tries to set that balance right.

Frequently thought of as a vigilante show with an excellent actor, The Equalizer is more nuanced than that. It certainly has a right-wing focus--the show's creators show how McCall has the right to use weapons and high-tech surveillance to monitor and control undesirable criminal conduct. What makes it tolerable is McCall's shadowy past with the CIA and his on-going relations with his former boss ""Control"". The constant underlining of this background reminds viewers of how fallible and guilt-ridden McCall is. This fallibility is frequently a theme in many of the episodes.

The most remarkable aspect of this show, however, is how it simmered with so much talent--in front of and behind the screen. Actors include Kevin Spacey, Ving Rhames, Dan O'Herlihy, John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, Macauley Culkin, J.T. Walsh, Vincent D'Onofrio, Michael Rooker, Tony Shaloub, Patricia Clarkson, Melissa Leo and Lori Loughlin. Director Tobe Hooper directs one of the episodes. Future Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow co-wrote one of the scripts. Police drummer Stewart Copeland wrote the exciting theme and most of the music for Seasons 1 and 2.

The show ended after four seasons, which technically makes it a flop. The complex political content was probably too much for some viewers, especially considering that in the early to mid 1980's most viewers during the Reagan-Bush years thought that America was actually doing good things in central America. Fortunately, home video enables us to watch sleepers such as The Equalizer and give them a second chance to catch on with audiences.

My only complaint is that picture quality is average at best, but frequently sub-par with pixilation and washed-out color. It's watchable, but you will need to adjust your expectations for picture and sound.",1530662400,2,2581,5.194711538461538
