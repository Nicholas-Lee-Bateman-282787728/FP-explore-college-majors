7155732,1,B00X3DC8RE,Good movie but I'm surprised it made it all the way to Alaska without falling out of the envelope. It was not sealed shut.,1480809600,,122,4.125
7155733,5,B00X3DC8RE,My boyfriend laughed at me when I said I hadn't seen this movie.  I was pleasantly surprised and loved the movie!  Who doesn't love Robin Williams!?,1476576000,,148,4.653846153846154
7155734,5,B00X3DC8RE,"I absolutely LOVE this move!

7155737,1,B00X3DC8RE,Movie is great but the price sux. I got the full screen and wanted the wide.  At this price I'll pass and you should to. Movie is worth half what they're asking. A**es asking $20 for a non bluray version of an outdated movie so  they can take advantage of his death.,1453075200,3,266,4.096153846153846
7155781,5,B00X3DC8RE,Great humor and one of Robin William's best!,1502323200,,44,4.625
7155782,5,B00X3DC8RE,"I love this movie that is rarely shown on TV, so I decided to share it with my brother especially since Jon Stewart is in it.  He and his wife loved it as well.",1501027200,,160,3.7058823529411766
7155783,5,B00X3DC8RE,Wish it was blu Ray but its perfect,1500508800,,35,3.5
7155784,1,B00X3DC8RE,"War of the kid's show mascots, as a shameless Barney stand-in steals the national adoration (and television slot) of a down-on-his-luck Captain Kangaroo stand-in. With an invested Ed Norton as the former and a cackling, chaotic Robin Williams as the latter, the right pieces might appear to be in-place for some fireworks, but the film never gets there. Hopelessly predictable and cut-rate, it's a watery humorless mess. The cast seems to know they're in a stinker, too, with a steaming mound of half-assed performances and a full gallery of awful, borderline-offensive caricatures. Norton is really the only one who seems like he's into it, throwing his all into the part of a hopelessly naive nice guy who falls in bed with a den of vipers, though Williams admittedly doesn't get much substance to work with. Jon Stewart is particularly atrocious in his supporting role as a weak-willed executive with bad hair who constantly, pointlessly lingers around the fringe like a wet fart. Riddled with holes and desperately short on laughs, Smoochy's questionable morals seem to hint that the key to success in show business involves choosing the nicer of two warring mob factions. Bizarre, boring fodder without a purpose, this one was a real chore to finish.",1500336000,,1255,5.067632850241546

7155787,5,B00X3DC8RE,Great to see these back in stock. My son has been searching for this for quite a while. Loved the movie.,1490659200,,104,4.0
7155788,5,B00X3DC8RE,"For my money, one of the finest comedies of the 21 century.  Good comedic acting all the way round from this well put together cast.",1486944000,,132,4.28
7155789,5,B00X3DC8RE,"I've been waiting for this to become available on Amazon at a reasonable price & now I own it! One of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Everyone turns in two thumbs up performances. If you haven't seen it, you do t know what you're missing. For those who have, you know why this review is so good!",1484956800,,299,4.172413793103448

8714824,5,B00X3DC8RE,Great movie,1509667200,,11,5.0
8714825,5,B00X3DC8RE,"This movie should be a cult classic. I am getting rid of 99% of my DVDs but I have a small collection of my absolute favorites. Robin Williams and Ed Norton star in this unique film. While it's about a kids TV show, a couple parts lean towards adult humor. I'll watch anything with either of those actors in it so it's a treat to see them in the same movie.",1504656000,,357,4.042253521126761
8714826,5,B00X3DC8RE,Forget all the negative reviews this got when it was first released.  Robin Williams lets out his full energy and rage in this piece and his character is really something to see even if you don't enjoy the satire of children's television that runs the plot it's worth your time just to see Williams letting his emotions loose again the way he did when he first started out.,1502409600,,373,4.485294117647059
