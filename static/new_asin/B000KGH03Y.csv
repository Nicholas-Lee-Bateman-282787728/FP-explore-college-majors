2690980,5,B000KGH03Y,"Gunbuster (Aim for the Top!) is a masterpiece in Japanese animation. Created by the famous anime studio GAINAX, Gunbuster starts off as seemingly light girls' high school drama and unfolds across space and time into an epic galaxy-spanning space opera. It follows the adventures of Noriko Takaya, a student at the Okinawa Space Force Girls' High School, as she pursues the ambition of becoming a pilot in space like her late father. Along the way she will meet the inspiring and preternaturally gifted Kazumi Amano (a.k.a. Onee-sama) and a tough coach who is willing to train her to her fullest potential. She will face bitter rivals on the ground, horrifying enemies out in space, and heartbreaking separation from the ones she loves as she strives for a position in the elite ""Top Squadron"" and eligibility to pilot the amazing super-weapon, Gunbuster.

Gunbuster was mode ""for otaku, by otaku"" and even as it builds to an epic climax it drops references left and right to everything from sports anime to the science fiction works of Robert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov. Playing ""spot the reference"" will be fun and rewarding if you're in on the joke but if not the magnificent story and sterling art design will still carry you away. The characters were designed by Macross designer Haruhiko Mikimoto and are more fluidly and emotionally animated than you will see in a lot of anime today.

This DVD release from Bandai Visual comes loaded with extra features like the famous ""science lessons"" (all of them including the ones from the LD release) and some never-before-seen footage which shows a different perspective on the Gunbuster saga. My biggest complaint is that it has some nasty cover art that looks like it was done by a fan artist plucked fresh from Deviant Art and commissioned to do the job. It's not as bad as the Captain N cover art but it doesn't do justice to the wonderful characters. Thankfully, this is counterbalanced by a wonderful booklet inside which contains loads of original design art, character descriptions, and information about the production itself.

If you are a true anime fan and not just a Narutard you really owe it to yourself to own or at least watch this incredible release.",1204588800,2,2215,4.88563829787234
2690981,5,B000KGH03Y,"Finally on DVD, my wish has came true after 15+ years! I have exposed to animes in the early 90's and this is one of the titles it will be in my heart. Why? The storyline is very deep and the development of the characters are very well done. There are couple areas that got me teary eyed as well. Everything is hand drawned and detailed when computer use was not involved. I would recommend to anyone who really to see some classic animes, this is one of them. Keep in mind this is suited for 16+yrs due to graphical violence and some nudity. This is maybe the only chance ever existed on DVD.",1176595200,,593,4.2105263157894735
2690982,4,B000KGH03Y,"Okay, let me start by saying that I am a mecha fan.  If it has giant robots in it, then I'm going to watch it, and I'm probably going to enjoy it regardless of the plot issues involved.

With that out of the way, let's go on with the review (CONTAINS SPOILERS).  This title is, according to every other otaku I know, the keystone in any mecha collection.  I may differ on that opinion, but it is still a great series that may confuse some people at first.  The suits are impressive, and the battle sequences are something that can't be missed, but keep in mind that the first four episodes are more or less a subtle parody of the genre to which it belongs.  You want sexy pilots in futuristic Japanese high school tennis uniforms, you got it.  You want training regimes that consist of piloting a robot through standard gym class workouts like pushups and jumping jacks, you got it.  You want an incomplete superweapon laying waste to alien scum, you got it.  You want a series that shifts from subtle parody to hardcore s-f for its last two episodes, you got it.

The last two episodes are where this series shines, and also where it falters.  The final battle against the alien armada that numbers in the billions is something to behold, with weapons that would put any other mecha series to shame.  The problem is, along with two artistic choices that place one epic battle in the form of pencil drawings that run like a slide show and have the entire last episode in black and white (animated in shades of grey, not just filmed in B&W, that part is kinda cool), the whole series relies heavily on the concept of time dialation in relation to near-lightspeed travel.  The end result is a tear-jerker of an ending with a premise that left me scratching my head:  The Gunbuster and its two pilots return from the final battle in what seems like no time to us and them, but according to normal space-time they've been gone from Earth for a while.  Something on the order of 12,000 years.  I won't mention what happens after that, but it was reassuring and a little bothersome to someone like me who likes a slightly more logical ending, not an ending that is played up for dramatic effect.

All in all, though, I highly recommend this title to any anime fan that likes giant robots, epic space battles, a little emotion, or are a fan of Hideaki Anno (You know, the guy who gave us that mindf--k of a series ""Evangelion"").  Despite an odd but satisfying ending, I dare you not to find something to like about Gunbuster.  Oh, dub purists be warned: THIS DVD SET IS SUBTITLED ONLY.  NO ENGLISH DUB AT ALL.",1175385600,2,2602,4.460887949260043
2690983,4,B000KGH03Y,"My first encounter with GunBuster was over a decade when I was in high school.  I was out of school for a few weeks because I was quite sick.  We didn't have a lot of money but my mom took me to the local Blockbuster video store whenever I wanted to grab some movies to pass the time with.  I cleared out their section.  Previous to this my only exposure to anime was this one-time event the Cartoon Network did in its early days.  At midnight they ran Project A-ko, Vampire Hunter D and Robot Carnival.  The latter two are still amongst my favorites and from then on I was hooked.

So, when I went to Blockbuster I grabbed such classics as Devil Hunter Yohko, the unedited Vampire Hunter D, 3x3 Eyes, Dangaio, Bubblegum Crisis, GunBuster, and a few others.  Each one I've listed is special to me to this day.  But GunBuster was unique amongst the bunch because until that point I'd never seen sci-fi done like that.  Go out for a 10 minute mission and 6 months pass on Earth!?  What was that?  And science lessons at then end to explain it all?  It was wild and something that colored my own writing to this day.

When came time to talk anime with my friends they often brought up Robotech as one of their favorites.  I never saw it and still haven't seen it.  My only exposure to anything Robotech was the terrible film Macross 2 and thought, ""If this is Robotech then they can keep it.""  My friends assured me it wasn't and recently we saw Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles in the theater.  The highlight of the entire film was me constantly riffing on it to my friends' amusement.  The thing was terrible and my friends, the Robotech fans, will only now refer to it as `the film whose name cannot be spoken.'  Grumbles about destroying their childhood did occasionally come up.

While they were lauding Robotech I was constantly talking about GunBuster.  No one I knew, no anime fan I ever met, had seen it.  And since it was only out on VHS that pretty much meant no one was ever going to see it.  Well, that's not exactly true.  I had obtained through various means a DVD rip of the VHS version.  It was done so bad I refused to let them see it.  It was really, really bad.

Then I read about this DVD release and I saw the clouds part and a ray of golden sunshine pierce through the darkness.  It was wonderful.

You're probably wondering why I'm blabbing on like this?  I want you to know just how much this OVA means to me.  My first experience with it, and all that other anime I watched when I was sick, is one of the few pleasant childhood memories I have.  I just want to make that abundantly clear.  Now I can get to what I thought about this DVD release that we're on the same page.

It's good but not great.  I'd call it great if it weren't $65 retail.  There's little reason I can fathom why this release couldn't have been put on a single dual-layer DVD.  There's isn't a lot here outside the episodes themselves.  I'll be the first to tell you that the image quality is fantastic!  It's very, very pretty.  But that's it.  No commentary.  No eater eggs that I could find.  The new science lessons are nice.  The promo clips are interesting but of terrible quality as they were ripped from some 20-year old VHS tapes (the originals were lost).  I wished that the promo's for following episodes were better organized.  I watched the science lesson for episode 2 and was treated to the promo trailer for episode 3 and then immediately the trailer for episode 4.  If I wasn't already familiar with the series a major event would have been spoiled for me.

And the series isn't dubbed.  I know, I  know - I hear people hissing already.  Listen, I've heard good dubbing and I've heard bad dubbing.  But for a $65 release I expect something more than what I got to justify the price.  It's not here.  Had this been $30 I would have given it 5 stars.  4 stars are still very good but the outrageous price forces me to knock it down a peg.  The company behind this release simply did not invest the money they should have in any additional features that would justify the price tag on it.  They didn't.  My advice:  Don't pay retail.  Get it here or some others place where you'll get some kind of discount.  Otherwise, wait for the price to drop on its own.  This OAV was first released in 1988, a few more months until the price is more reasonable won't kill you.

Price and lack of features aside, the video and audio quality is great and the story is as fresh as ever.",1173139200,6,4480,4.32810615199035
2690984,5,B000KGH03Y,"Gunbuster.  You've probably heard of it before, even if you weren't old enough to experience it first hand when it was released in 1988.  US Renditions blessed would be anime fans back then with VHS tapes in clamshell cases with one of the most engrossing and moving mech anime releases ever.  Not to mention the story and whole direction is actually a parody of many of the then current ""themes"" that were popular at the time.  ""Fan service"", the super deformed characters in the science lessons, the over the top ""Super"" robots, and the now legendary ""Gainax bounce"" could all be seen here in this early release.  Compared to many of today's modern efforts this OAV remains true to it's original Japanese title, Top O' Nerae! or, ""Aim for The Top!"".  It always has and always will be at the top.

Gunbuster is the story of a young girl, Noriko Takaya who wants to become a space pilot like her father, who was Captain of a vessel that was attacked by large bug like space aliens who are intent on finding and destroying Earth.  Enrolled in Okinawa's Space Pilot High School for girls, Noriko begins the training to become a defender of Earth and begins a long journey  (though through the miracle of time dilation and space travel hardly ages throughout the series) transforming from a crying nugget rookie pilot to the savior of the world.  Along the way, she is befriended by her ""Coach"" Ota and Kazumi Amano, the super talented and gifted girl who is the school's top student and almost a shoe in for becoming a pilot.

What makes Gunbuster work, unlike many typical, ""save the world from aliens in giant robots"" shows is the fact that while the show deals with the mechs and science behind it, it is really just backdrop for the character's growth.  While we get space battles and action, it is really the filler for seeing Noriko mature over time into the strong character she becomes by the end of the series.  The story will make you sad enough to cry at points if you are the type that does (and some people really do I'm told), and it will make you feel like cheering at others.  This is one of director Hideaki Anno's first works (Evangelion fame) and it shows how great his early works were. Absolutely top notch. Along the way, take note of the many parodies and references in names to contemporary things like the Sizzler units, or the RX-7 mechs.

Mech fans don't despair, since when the Gunbuster is finally truly unveiled (you don't even get to see it until halfway thorugh and then only for a short period) the real treat begins and it becomes one of the coolest moment in 80's , 90's, or even current anime mech scenes/battles.  The music is awesome, every single piece is perfect (note: It is known that for this US release, one piece of music was changed for a training sequence so purists be warned), and the animation even for a nearly 20 year old OAV looks great partly in thanks to character designs from Haruhiko Mikimoto, the character designer for the original SDF Macross series.

Bottom line is this set is a must buy for old anime fans or to new ones who shouldn't miss out on one of the finest OAV's ever to be released.  Gunbuster gets a 5 out of 5 no question.",1171756800,24,3195,4.517361111111111
2690985,4,B000KGH03Y,"I love gunbuster and will be snapping this up.

2690988,4,B000KGH03Y,"This legendary animation OVA series in 1988 directed by Hideaki Anno, best known by Neon Genesis Evangelion series, starts out like a typical school drama in girls' school focusing on player-coach relationship, one of the popular soap and animation drama categories in Japan during 70s or 80s. Except that the goal of young girls' training is to become one of the members of elite robot operators what they call ""the Tops"". Noriko is the freshman of the girls' high school for training future TOP pilots to fight against space monsters in outer space. She is not good at training but she was chosen as a pilot for Gunbuster ultimate weapon for the mankind by her drill-sergeant coach Koichiro Ohta. As the story goes on it is getting more and more interesting and serious sci-fi drama just like Neon Genesis Evangelion is. After Gunbuster piloted by Noriko shows its true strength the drama is filled with surprises and Wows. Some of the viewers feel that you are left behind because its technical details seem too complicated. The drama also has additional lectures to explain about how these mechanical things work. In this drama time dilation concept is dealt really well. While Noriko ages little while being in near-light-speed environment those left in earth grows old much faster than the pilots in outer space.

Verdict: Sci-fi drama with some light comedy and military adventure which also targeted for female viewers.

Gunbuster is the amazing and heartwarming girl named Noriko. who grows up starting out as a no talent cadet all the up until she saves the world from a horde of space monsters.

This series covers many facets of human drama from Noriko's relation to her ""onii-sama"", her first love, their coach, the legacy of her father and even the theory of relativity as noriko leaves time itself behind.

The first series (not their first animation but the first multi-episode animation) by the world renowned studio gainax, this is a must especially for those who consider themselves anime buffs.",1331769600,,623,4.971153846153846
2690990,4,B000KGH03Y,"Just got the boxset in today, and could not be happier! It's tough to find other legitimate releases of this show, let alone a reasonably priced box, so I was glad to get such a great deal ($32 dollars on sale, with Prime).

While I have not watched each DVD yet (I've seen the show, but I will review this particular release later), the box itself is very nice. A booklet is included, which has character art sheets and descriptions, as well as art and images of the mechs, ships, aliens, and weaponry.
Such extras are always a huge plus to any boxset, so my thanks to Bandai (even though they recently had to shutter their American branch). The booklet also has some writings on the show, its context to Gainax's history, and short essays on each OVA episode.

My only qualm with this box was that, while brand new in box, when it arrived, the discs were fine...but had slid out of their place in the case. No scratches, so no problem, but a bit of a flaw with package design. My friend also ordered this item recently and had the same issue, but like my item, no harm caused.",1327881600,,1078,4.358208955223881
2690991,5,B000KGH03Y,"This review is based on having the series when it first came out here in the US.  It is an excellent concept that deserved better than it got.  Contrary to some who think the director was being inovating at the end just didn't pay attention to the fact that while the animation was spectacular in Eps-1&2, the budgets were being squeezed once the Company realized they had over-extended themselves with their first big project.  The fact is that the last episode actually had to use art off the story-board in order to finish the story.  Unfortunately, it was clear from the second tape (eps. 3 & 4) that the quality of the animation was slipping quite visably from the opening episodes and the last tape showed just how close they came to not finishing the story at all, in fact the time between the second and last tape was double the original gap from #1 and the second.  We, at the time of the original release, thought they bailed on this one and still hold that opinion.

That is not to say this is a bad story, on the contrary it is a great story.  Sure it starts out light with young girls in tight suits and a sense of fun and adventure, it soon makes clear that it is a story of genocidel war, sense of duty, and the harsh cost that war can extract on those who have to fight it.  More than just another mecha story, this is a story of the cost payed by people who wished for a normal life but were destined to sacrifice all but true friendship in pursuit of doing what has to be done.  It is the story, and it's faithfulness to costs of light-speed travel, that makes this great-whil eps. 1&2 show how great animation can be when supported properly.  Unfortunately, the rest of the series showes what happens when the bean-counters (accountants) are let to wonder away from their ledgers and allowed to make operating decisions.",1308700800,,1839,4.43026706231454
2690992,5,B000KGH03Y,"This is a classic, must-have for any anime fan.  The military style music and old-style art is very nostalgic and wonderful to watch, compared to some of the new anime out there.  I highly recommend this movie!!",1296172800,,211,4.675675675675675
2690993,5,B000KGH03Y,"Do you know those parody anime when they make fun of an old classic anime,well, i think that Gunbuster is the main Target that they aim at.
This 1988, 6 Episode OVA from the Director Anno Hideaki, the man who presented to us NGE is one of the best OVA that i've ever watched, though i couldn't stop laughing here and there for how much classic this anime is.
the story follows Noriko who her father was killed in humanity's first encounter with aliens. being Proud of her father Noriko decided to be a space pilot herself, for that, she joins Okinawa Girls' Space Pilot High School, unfortunately Noriko is just a klutz young girl who is one of the worst pilots in the school, but when Koichiro Ohta a new couch arrives, he sets his eyes on her out of all the students and he puts her together with Kazumi Amano the best mecha pilot in the school, and there Noriko's journey to space starts.
what i really liked about this OVA was the good implementation of the space theories, like the speed of light and the time dimension factor and how those have effected the characters and the story development. that helped us see the change on earth over the years from the eyes of the characters.
the characters themselves were memorable, even thought Noriko was so annoying in the begging, she managed to get so much experience that made her develop remarkably making her fit to be a the pilot of the great mecha gunbuster,and while noriko was going foreword we saw the other character Amano being bushed back by her emotion that she was hiding at the begging and which made her a cool character at the time, but still she was a great character herself.
the music for this OVA was just great, i loved that sound track that comes with the gunbuster seances making the fight much more exciting, and that Inazuma (lighting) kick, even thought it was funny at the beginning, it was just plain cool later on.
the Art for it's time was nice, i'm still not that much into the characters design, but it was still classic, what i really hated was the last Ep Black and White panel thing, after 12,000 year people will think that the animation should be more the better, but using black and white coloring was annoying, they say it's artistic and unique, but still it was annoying, if i wanted to watch something in black and white, i would put my sunglasses on, but still, that what makes out Gainax, they always don't disappoint you to be disappointed in the end of anything they make, i'v got used to it, but that doesn't change that this OVA was the best for me so far, even from Gainax.",1261353600,,2574,4.455508474576271

There is a thick white line that always runs down the entire left side of the frame and there's a thin white line that sometimes runs down the right side of the frame. There's constant video noise that mars the image (not film grain, mind you, just video noise). Worst of all is the near constant frame judder. The video jumps constantly and almost never stops moving. It's extraordinarily distracting.

2690996,1,B000KGH03Y,"After many recommendations from friends, and reading universal praise, I went into the ""classic"" 6 episode series with high hopes - hopes that developed leprosy and collapsed under the weight of their dead, jaundiced flesh by the end.

Gunbuster is wrought with 2D characterization, uninspired designs,  awkward fan-service, and a hilariously incomprehensible plot - and not incomprehensible in an entertaining, mysterious sense - but in a pissed out sort of way that's explained in an embarrassing, 30 second, expository excretion. Anyone who says this show has depth must be weighed down by nostalgia for it, because I simply can't understand any other reason for it being praised. It boggles my mind. And if anyone recommends it with a disclaimer about it being made in the 80s, don't trust them - age does not excuse quality.

But does Gunbuster have redeeming qualities? Of course - it's very well animated. The drama with characters aging in space is novel. And...uh...hmm...sorry, I just remembered how tedious and head-punchingly bad this show was.

If I was forced to recommend this series, I would only for those who are interested in its historical value, to be watched more as research than entertainment. I would explain my reasoning further, but this brief moment of nerd-rage has subsided - and the less time spent with Gunbuster, the better.",1231200000,6,1357,5.126696832579186
2690997,5,B000KGH03Y,"The directorial debut of acclaimed director Hideaki Anno, Gunbuster is a legendary anime fan favorite that casts pretty girls and giant robots into a moving epic of insterstellar naval war. Newly translated and re-mastered in HD 24P format, Gunbuster has never before been available on DVD in North America...until now!

2015: Earth's first faster-than-light ship, the Luxion, is lost, attacked by unidentified space monsters in the Perseus Arm. Six years later, Noriko Takaya, daughter of the Luxion's commander, enters the Okinawa girls' Space Pilot High School, vowing to be a pilot and follow her father's trail to the stars. But is she prepared for the intense training to become a member of the elite Top Squadron? Noriko's fight has just begun-and the fate of all humanity depends on her meeting the challenge!

It's hard to believe that it's been nearly 20 years when I first discovered ""Gunbuster"", the awesome mecha anime that has won the hearts for anime fans since its first release back in 1988.

The year was 1992 and I discovered this awesome series through an anime club meeting and I was just enamored by the series so much that I purchased the English subtitled VHS videos which contained two episodes for like $35 through Books Nippan. In fact, when the VHS was re-released in 1996 by another company, I had to buy that because the video tapes have been viewed too many times and started to lose its quality.

It's really interesting how many people I converted to anime fans through letting them borrow my video tapes. ""Gunbuster"" is one of the few rare series you will find where each episode is well written, gripping and you just can't stop after one episode. You just want to watch the whole series completely throughout.

What I really enjoyed is how the OAV series fluctuated between parodying other anime but also its attention to light speed travel, black holes and warp factor.

Of course, back in the 90's, not only did you have a knock out punch with beautiful animation, a well written storyline but you also had the top voice actresses from a popular anime series that was so big among American anime fans at that time. You had Hidaka Noriko as the main character Takaya Noriko (note: Hidaka is known for the voice talent of Akane from ""Ranma 1/2'), Sakuma Rei as Amano Kazumi (note: Sakuma was the voice talent of ""Ranma 1/2"" character Shampoo) and then you had the ""Active Heart"" theme song by then-pop idol Sakai Noriko.

The series would feature a lot of references and then at the end of each episode, fans were treated with ""Science Lesson"" episodes featuring chibi versions of the characters featuring even more references.

But as much as the anime references to other anime and scientists, ""Gunbuster"" also worked as a fun parody with its use of the title ""Gunbuster! Top o Nerae"" (Aim for the Top) which is a parody of the anime and manga tennis series ""Ace wo Nerae!"" and the hugely popular Western film ""Top Gun"".

Of course we know that director Hideaki Anno went on to be known for his creation of ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" and the ""Science Lessons"" director Tsurumaki Kazuya went on to direct ""FLCL"" and ""Gunbuster 2"".

Here we are 20 years since the original OAV's were released in Japan, six episodes all on DVD featuring Noriko as she pushes herself to become a formidable pilot, watching her as the weak girl who would cry a lot but push herself and train herself to become one of the best pilots from the squadron.

There is so much to love about the anime, not just about the oh-so-good feeling of an underdog showing everyone that she can do it and accomplish things and prove them wrong but also how science is used in this series. Each time they go light speed into space, each minute that goes by, three months has gone by in Earth.

So, what could be complex is actually well written and explained in the anime series as each time Noriko arrives back to Earth, her schoolmates are much older than her and have children.

I guess you can say that with each episode, you get much more than what you would expect. That's how I felt about ""Gunbuster"". Fulfilled, excited about the next episode and wanting more.

Also, for the guys wanting a little ""H"", ""Gunbuster"" does have it's share of nudity scenes.

As for the DVD, inside the box, you will find a folding case with three DVD's featuring artwork of the cast of ""Gunbuster"" and the ""Gunbuster"" mech itself.

Also included is a booklet featuring character information, ""Gunbuster"" Gainax behind-the-scenes information plus information on each episode

The episodes are presented in its full aspect ratio with the final episode being black and white and letterboxed. The animation looks awesome even for it being 20-years-old, I really enjoyed how this anime was remastered.

The sound is offered in Linear PCM 2.0 which is a higher bit rate for audio.

There is no English dub, all vocals are Japanese and for subtitles, you can choose to have it on or off or on with the signs translated as well.

The menus are clean with selections of each episode (two episodes per disc) and the Science Lesson Chapters.

As for extra features, there are a few.

Disc 1 features ""Good Morning OGH!"" which was the promotional trailer produced back in July 1988. This is featured in 2ch, 5.1ch and 5.1ch (dialogue off). There is a quic intro explanation how the trailers were saved on to a VHS tape to a super hi-8 tape and thus the quality is not great. But you start to see how the quality between the DVD versus a promo tape are.

Disc 2 features ""Cosmic Battle Space"" in 2ch or 5.1ch which features another perspective (from episode 4) of the fight between the squadron and the alien monsters.

Disc 3 features the ""Sizzler Project"" in 2ch or 5.1ch. This is a promotional trailer produced in 1989 and actually features character Jung Freud learning about the new Gunbuster mechas being created. This was very interesting to see and similar to the first promotional trailer.

""Gunbuster"" has remained one of my top 3 anime that I will forever treasure in my heart. It's a series that shows guts, determination, happiness, sadness. It's literally an emotional rollercoaster that has made me smile, cry...

It's well written, features really awesome scenes and interaction between the characters. Well-acted, well-animated and just one of those rare treasures that have come along that you just don't see as much these days from a lot of anime.

Especially with a storyline managed to be complete in six episodes, I'm impressed.

I know that there is a region 0 disc that was released with a fourth disc that featured a rough episode five and unmatted episode six with a few other features but sure, as much as it would have been nice to have that in the US release, I'm not actually losing sleep over it either.

For a great price, you get all six episodes on DVD. For the boxset is the price I paid for one VHS back then. And I know for dub fans who don't like to read subtitles, it's going to be hard to recommend it to you to begin with.

But if you want quality anime that still looks very cool now as it did 20 years ago and also to watch one of the best, well written sci-fi/mecha anime OAV series ever released, then definitely check out ""GUNBUSTER"".

I highly recommend the ""Gunbuster"" anime DVD box set. You won't regret it.",1218153600,11,7329,4.684579439252336

8156710,5,B000KGH03Y,Gunbuster is something you have to see. This dvd set is great. Nicer than I thought it would be. The booklet is full of interesting stuff and guides for each set of 2 episodes. If you haven't seen the show just watch it and don't read the book or look too much at the case. Bit spoiler tastic. Absolutely worth it though.,1469232000,,321,4.193548387096774

8156714,5,B000KGH03Y,"Few OVAs have achieved the level of what could be called true pathfinder in the way this 6-episode series did. Back in Gainax's early days, they decided to get into the giant robot game with Gunbuster, a mix of Top Gun and the Aim For The Ace anime/manga. This was one of the first anime to incorporate the logistics of space travel and its relation to how time passes on Earth, although a lot of it is based on physics made up specifically made for the story. Evangelion creator Hideaki Anno seriously brought all his talent into this production, and you can see its effect on future projects like Nadia.

First starting out in the early-mid 21st Century, mankind's exploration of the galaxy has revealed a race of ""space monsters""(and that's the official name for these aliens)that are the size of starships who can survive in space and use stars as a nest for their drone forces. One of Earth's main military fleets was destroyed during one of their first initial encounters, the admiral of which leaves behind his daughter Noriko who spends her teenage years training to become a mecha pilot to help the defense forces counter the oncoming aline threat. She goes to an all-girls facility modeled after a high school where the pilots have the robots doing pushups for some reason, and makes friends and rivals along the way, including the top student Kazumi, who she becomes partners with as they graduate to go onto operating on a space vessel. Accompanying the girls is their Coach Ohta, the sole survivor of Noriko's father's ship. They become part of a special regiment searching for the aliens, and are ambushed by the space monsters, where Noriko learns the horrors of war after her friend is killed during the attack. She and Kazumi split up too as she doesn't believe Noriko has what it takes to keep up with her to pilot the mighty transforming combiner robot labeled Gunbuster. After returning to Earth, the few months they spent in space turned out to be about a decade for the rest of the world. Noriko and Kazumi patch things, and take up the mantle of piloting Gunbuster to escort the fleet from setting of a black hole bomb to destroy the alien fleets. The two spaceship fighters unite to form Gunbuster which is about ten times bigger than the other mechas, and capable shooting multiple lasers at once over long distance of space. They manage to stop the aliens at this time, with Kazumi making it back to Earth in time to confess her love for Coach who is dying of space radiation. The final chapter is set about 15 years later where Kazumi married Coach during his remaining time and became a mecha pilot instructor at her old school, while Noriko has spent what was for her a shorter amount of time in space and is still only a teenager. The two pilots help lead a final assault against the space monsters who have resurfaced using Jupiter as their final standing ground. After the star fleet fails to launch their final black hole bomb, Noriko and Kazumi fly Gunbuster into the heart of Jupiter using their own reactor to set off the remaining space mines. The husk of what remains of Gunbuster returns to Earth what for them was a few hours, but in reality a much longer time has past for the rest of the planet.

Not to spoil the ending, but it is truly one of the most memorable finales to an anime ever. You can simply not forget it, and it is probably one of the few non-downer conclusions to a Gainax story. The OVA features the best quality Gainax had to offer since their previous hit of Wings Of Honneamise, and their attention to detail, including some of the made-up physics for the story(including bionic dolphins!)culminate in a classis anime in the truest sense of the word. Even though there's never been an English dub of it, it's still an integral part of otaku heritage!",1442275200,,3812,4.612665684830633
8156715,5,B000KGH03Y,"I recently showed this classic to my wife, but I discovered it way back in my college days. If someone were to ask me to define anime classic, this would surely be at the very top of the list.

The story-telling is disjointed the change of tone drastic. One moment you are expected to laugh and the next you feel like a bucket of cold water was dumped on you. The protagonist cries like a baby and saves the world. The girls all wear swimsuits for ""uniforms"" and the robots due calisthenics for training. There's rivalry, training montages, helplessness and heroism. There's the biggest giant robot and largest alien fleet of anything ever and the finale is in black and white with a large series of sketches.

But what really makes this anime for me is the way it treats FTL travel. As the various characters of the show zip around the galaxy on missions, they all age at different rates due to relativity. By the end of the short series the main character is still a teen, but everyone around her is anywhere from near her age to near death of old age. It makes it all so much more...real than it would have been otherwise.

I pulled this one off the shelf and watched it with my wife because we had just watched Interstellar and I said ""Hey, you know what's a REALLY good anime that features relativistic aging due to FTL travel?"" If you are into that kind of science-fiction and especially anime sci-fi you owe it to yourself to watch this show. It has fantastic artwork with astounding detail, the transfer is beautiful, and yeah, the MIDI version of Mars:Bringer of War from Holst's Planets still gets me excited to this day. Watch it, own it, love it.",1417046400,,1658,4.483443708609271

This was one of my favorites growing up, up there with Bubblegum Crisis and Macross.  Even among those series, this has the best anime storyline of all time.  It seems to have been the prototype for epic story arcs to come in later anime series like Masterforce, Gaogaigar or any Brave Series, and Gurren Lagann.

The show starts out small but soon grows into intergalactic war.  The charm is that it never loses its main focus, the characters.  In fact, while the settings grows in scope, the character development just gets better and deeper.

The animation quality still holds up and is pretty amazing to watch.  Not all anime looks good 25 years later and on a big screen.  This DVD transfer is top quality and the sound is great.

Nostalgia is one thing, but my two daughters loved this series as well.  They really dug the story and science lessons.  If you enjoyed it as a kid or are into retro anime, then this is a must purchase.",1381104000,,952,4.502923976608187

Highly Recommended for Mecha fans.",1354406400,,306,4.083333333333333
