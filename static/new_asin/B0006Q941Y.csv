2191060,5,B0006Q941Y,"Tom Sizemore at his best! He really gets inside the tragic character of baseball's Pete Rose in this great ESPN Film. What is it really like to have a gambling addiction- horrible? As we watch the FILM, hopefully we will see how a gambling addiction destroyed baseball great Pete Rose. After viewing this film, we can see the need for Gamblers Anonymous. On a personal level, we probably all know someone destroyed by compulsive gambling. Tragic!",1350000000,,446,4.881578947368421
2191061,3,B0006Q941Y,"One thing made apparent from the extras included with this very first ESPN TV movie is that the pleasant-looking yuppie of the teleplay whom Pete Rose convinces to place bets for him with mob bookies looks like a thug in real life.

The story mainly sticks to Rose's gambling addiction and his self-inflicted downfall from placing bets on his own team, then lying about these and showing no remorse after being caught.

Sizemore gapes, mugs and exaggerates Pete's ambling monkey gait.

An only-OK sports bio directed by Peter Bogdonovich.

2191062,1,B0006Q941Y,"Saw it on ESPN when it was released. Not worth anyones time. Unless they like to hate Pete, then it would support their hatred.",1302134400,,127,4.333333333333333
2191063,4,B0006Q941Y,"Hustle is the correct name for this movie.  I learned so much from this movie.

A movie all would enjoy.",1298246400,,104,4.15
2191064,5,B0006Q941Y,"Tom Sizemore did a good job as Pete Rose, except for the way he was walkign when he entered the gym in the very beginning.  The Special Features were really neat, and it made me realize I hate Charlie Gibson even more than I thought, because it seemed to me that he asked Pete Rose the same question two times in a row, but reworded it the second time, which is stupid, because you're going to get the same answer you got before.  Pete Rose did bet on baseball, and what he did did not affect the outcome of baseball games, yet he's banned from baseball for life, whereas Mark McGwire, Jason Giambi, Barry Bonds, and numerous other steroid users, are either still playing baseball, or srill affiliated with baseball in some way when what they did affected the outcome of games.  They wouldn't have hit like they hit if they didn't do steroids.  Bud Selig told Hal McCoy off the recored that Pete Rose will never be reinstated as long as he is commissioner, so hopefully we will get a new commissioner in 2012 that will reinstate Pete Rose, and make him eligible for the Hall of Fame, where he belongs.",1259712000,,1101,4.435643564356436
2191065,4,B0006Q941Y,"Too bad the story had to be made. Rose was a good player. Off field activities bring down others, also. Can we forgive as a nation?",1242604800,,131,4.076923076923077
2191066,2,B0006Q941Y,"Tom Sizemore has been in some outstanding performances but I for one do not feel that he resembles Pete Rose.  In some ways yes, he evokes the anger and power trip as well as the fan friendly appearance that Rose was known for, but in the end I did not feel that Sizemore should have been cast as Rose, to me it just was not the best fit.

The movie portrays a lot of truth but one has to wonder how much is actually embellished.  It was interesting to get a behind the scenes look into how a gambling addiction can consume a person and destroy everything and everyone around them.  For the most part this is just a made for T.V. movie and although interesting at times, I came away disappointed with it.",1185840000,,704,4.231343283582089
2191067,1,B0006Q941Y,"Its like watching a bad saturday movie but its cheap so it the cost out ways any recentment that its a bad movie. like to see them do a movie about the big red machine, but not if its as boring as this",1114041600,3,201,3.697674418604651
2191068,5,B0006Q941Y,"This movie does a pretty good job of showing what Pete Rose is about.....himself.  He may have admitted to betting on baseball and the Reds after fourteen years of denial but he believed then and now that he is bigger than the game.  The movie shows this.
The special features on this DVD are very good.  It has interviews with the investigator John Dowd, Fay Vincent & Paul Janzen who was dumb enough to listen to Pete. Also included is the press conference with Bart Giamatti & the interview where he admits his guilt but STILL denies that they showed him the evidence that they had against him. Just check out these interviews and the movie and you'll agree that Pete doesn't belong in the Hall Of Fame.",1112227200,8,706,4.5

8042284,5,B0006Q941Y,"So, yeah, I'm a Charlie Hustle guy. I also think that Tom Sizemore makes Charelton Heston seem like a Euro-trash porn stunt double who hasn't worked in weeks due to dysentery.  Nuff said! Get this movie, unless ofcourse that ur an enormous jerk, disliked by both family and city officials.",1405728000,,289,4.78
8042285,1,B0006Q941Y,"an absolute waste of time. poorly done, worse acting and even worse directing. don't waste your money your time or insult your intelligence. I forced my way through half of the movie just to make sure I was not having a very poor dream because even a nightmare would be better played out than this junk.",1404000000,,303,4.428571428571429
8042286,3,B0006Q941Y,"He's not in the Hall of Fame, nevertheless, Pete Rose was still one of the best players in Baseball history. He played for an amazing 27 years, setting the all-time hits record, but this film ignores all of that. I'm a baseball fanatic and I find bio-pics, like this one, to be a great tool for learning more about the people who came before my time. Hustle was unfortunately very one sided and focuses entirely on Rose's activities after his playing career. Tom Sizemore stars as Rose and makes this film worth watching, he really does do a tremendous job, and that's the only reason this film is rated ad highly as it is. After doing some research, it turns out that the events in this film are historically accurate, but blown way out of proportion. Hustle makes Pete Rose look like a junior gangster, running around Cincinnati, ripping people off, and using anyone that he can find. The truth is that Pete Rose was a sick man with a gambling addiction. He got in over his head and yes, he started betting on his own sport and even the team he managed. Rose was never buddy buddy with the mafia, he never bet hundreds of thousands of dollars at one time, and he was never involved with drugs. This film makes a case that Pete Rose was a small time gangster in a baseball uniform and that's simply not true. The man had an addiction that he's been treated for. This addiction cost him his career, his status, and even his family. 25 years later, he's admitted to what he's done and has sincerely apologized. I personally think, it's been long enough and it's time to put the man in the Hall of Fame. It's also time for someone to do an accurate film depiction of Rose, that shows the good along with the bad, something Hustle simply doesn't do.",1389744000,,1746,4.442367601246106
8042287,1,B0006Q941Y,I also need to send this movie back.  When you're watching it it wants to pause every little bit. I don't want to have this movie sent back.  I would like to have credit for it.  Let me know what I need to do.,1387497600,,209,3.7045454545454546
8042288,1,B0006Q941Y,"This movie isn't about how Pete Rose played baseball.  That is what I was hoping for...seeing him hustle and win games, etc.  This movie is about his darker gambling rich man side, almost like a mob movie.",1370044800,4,205,4.513513513513513
8042289,5,B0006Q941Y,Very good product.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.  Good quality and easy to operate.  Good product to purchase.,1365120000,,122,5.0
