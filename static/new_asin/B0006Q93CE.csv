2190835,5,B0006Q93CE,"....thought it was fantastic.  I almost forgot I was watching a movie.  Afterwards, I saw a program with the Leps and it seems this movie was dead on (according to the things they talked about that had happened in their career).  I recommend it to ANY Leppard fan, the long-time deadicated fan and the casual ""like some of their stuff"" folk...you may ALL come away being Lep fans.",1119830400,4,380,4.5588235294117645
2190836,5,B0006Q93CE,"I first saw this movie just last year, due to I was over sea's and wasn't able to see it when VH1 previewed it. Boy did I miss out on a great movie, I knew of most of the story that was told but it really put into perspective of how the band grew together and how they were able to over came Rick's accident to continue to give us awesome songs to remember them by.

Def Leppard is and always will be one of the biggest bands ever.

Hey and while your picking up the movie, check out the latest  album ""Rock Of Ages"" :) it's pretty good to.

Forever an 80's rock Fan.

2190837,5,B0006Q93CE,"This is a movie focusing on well known facts from the Def Leppard 197901986 period.

It starts with Joe Elliot auditioning for Atomic Mass, the band including Sav and Pete Willis, and goes all the way to their first performance with Rick Allen after his accident.

The casting directors and vocal coaches did a fantastic job.  Also, the director was able to pull off the personal background that affected highs (their first EP funded by Joe Elliott's dad) and lows (Steve Clark drinking his father's demons (literally) to death) of the band without overdramatizing them.

Also, the movie shows us the influence that Mutt Lange had on their carreer without forgetting the fact that the Lepps had the skills, the talent and the commitment to make it happen with his producing genius.

If you are a fan of Def Leppard, stop reading and buy this movie immediately.  If you were a casual fan of the Pyromania and Hysteria albums, you might as well enjoy a nicely made movie that gives you a glimpse into the history of a hugely popular ""pop"" metal band.

I actually saw it years ago and had been looking for it to see again and could not rent it anywhere - so chose to buy it, was a good price.  If you do not like Def Leppard - well you shouldn't even be searching for this.

2190858,4,B0006Q93CE,"Back in the day, Def Leppard was about as big as you could get in pop-metal music. At a brisk 90 minutes, this movie gets to the high and low points of their story as soon as possible. For example, the opening scene is the car wreck that took drummer, Rick Allens, left arm; flash-back to the beginning, and then on to the hits. Any sense of paying their dues is skipped over, and Mutt Lange quickly arrives on the scene. Speaking of Lange, its not really conveyed how big of a deal he was/is in music. He is their George Martin.

The actors sort of resemble the band members. Long hair wigs don't automatically make you a heavy metal singer. The typical lip synching and instrument synching is abundant, meaning theres a lot of exaggerated face grimacing and air-guitar playing. Im not sure if the vocals were performed by someone else, but I sure hope that wasn't Joe Elliot, the real lead singer.

Regardless of the movies quick pace, it reminds us that perseverance, comradery, and keeping an eye on the goal is of utmost importance. All in all, this is a fun trip down memory lane to hear some hits from the 80s and reminisce how we use to dress and wear our hair.",1483228800,,1169,4.407407407407407

2190898,5,B0006Q93CE,"To please everyone in every way all the time is absolutely impossible. But knowing that this movie which was over seen here and there by Joe Elliott when it was being made makes me happy knowing that this movie does hold essential key events that shows the bands early beginnings from the day Joe Elliott met Pete Willis after missing his bus after work, up to the release of 'Hysteria' as the movie is rightly named and of course to Rick Allen's first time playing live in front of an audience during the 'Hysteria' tour without his assistant.
Yes there were some things that could have been added such as Steve Clark's death and how it affected the band members, his family and other friends, but that happened after they finished their tour for 'Hysteria' and began the writing and recordings for 'Retro Active'. Honestly that tragedy should be another movie in it's self since it is definitely an important fact. Had it been added to this movie it would have made this already quick moving movie feel even more choppy then the 2 hour movie that it was and it might not have seen the light of day or it would have felt like a fictional movie instead and some people would still have had another reason to cry fowl.
As for me I love Def Leppard, I have ever since the end of their second album 'High and Dry' and beginning of 'Pyromania'. I could honestly feel a spark about them that stood out amongst other bands at the time, for a very young kid back then. Personally, I'm glad the band even allowed this movie to be made so we could see a little glimpse into some of the things they went through early on and glad to hear that there are bands out there today from different genre's that proudly admit that they have been inspired by this talented band over the years.
Goes to prove that this amazingly talented band has had the fighting power to stay from the beginning...even the movie pointed that out.",1432944000,5,1910,4.46

2190903,5,B0006Q93CE,"Haven't seen this really since it was aired by VH1 back in 2001, but recently got the Live in Vegas DVD and enjoyed it so much (particularly for the older songs they did on that) it reminded me of this.  Saw Amazon had it for quite cheap on DVD so went ahead and ordered it.

First the bad stuff, all technical:  DVD only (no Blu Ray), old-fashioned 'full screen' format only, and NO EXTRAs whatsoever- not even subtitles as an option!

That said, the movie itself really is good and more or less accurate based on what I know (which at least used to be quite a bit, I was a rabid fan in my teen years).  The actors are all quite good and look and play their roles well.  Biggest thing I took away from this recent viewing was how bad I felt for Steve and his demons, his story is such a sad one in the end.  The movie itself KINDOF tries to focus more on Rick and his accident, and half of the run-time was the time between Hysteria and Pyromania (with the rest being basically the entire band history before that), but pretty much everyone (except maybe Sav) gets their due.

Also, Anthony Michael Hall plays Mutt Lange quite well, and his importance to the band is emphasized as it should be.  Even their manager Peter Mensch (who gets more screen time than Mutt) is pretty well done.

Anyway, if you are a fan at all this is well worth having, but I would sure like to see a more complete and updated release sometime in the near future.",1426723200,2,1441,4.245421245421245

2190953,5,B0006Q93CE,"This is overall a very accurate, gripping dramatization of the first nine years of Def Leppard's existence. Casting is absolutely superb; everyone really looks like who they're supposed to. There are certain distance shots of the group onstage where I honestly forgot it wasn't the real band. The actors did a fantastic job mimicking the mannerisms and attitudes, and the costume designer deserves a medal for duplicating real outfits any Def Lep fan will recognize. One thing in this movie that really stood out to me is how well they portrayed Steve Clark's alcoholism. I knew he had a terrible problem with it, but to see it so realistically acted out is enough to bring you to tears. Certain events have been fictionalized/tweaked, but it gets the general point across (e.g. in tweaking: Rick Allen didn't drum completely by himself for the first couple of shows after his accident; there was a backup drummer briefly. E.g. in fictionalizing: again with Rick, they show him using drugs just before his accident. I may be misinformed but I have never ever heard that drugs were involved with the wreck).

I feel obligated to offer a few words of caution, however. The case simply states it's rated R for drug use, but there's more than that. There is some language (f word used twice, some ""white trash-talk,"" and some crude comments). If that sort of thing bothers you, all you need is a good memory and a mute button handy. One scene involves some groupies and the guys at a hotel; thankfully, it is right at the end of a scene segment [in other words, if you press the scene skip button right as ""Photograph"" is finishing, the DVD will skip the nasty scene entirely and take you to the next part without leaving anything else out. I promise, you're not missing anything if you do that). My other caution is they do show Rick's arm lying on the ground after the accident. You might want to have your younger Def Lep fans close their eyes.

Those detractors aside, this is a great movie that I have watched multiple times already and will continue to do so for many years. It's a real treat to get to see the story of one of rock's greatest bands lovingly represented on the big screen. The determination and friendship really shows through, making one appreciate all over again just what a close-knit unit this was.",1337040000,,2320,4.669926650366748

The story-line is an in-depth look at the high's and low's of THE greatest band in the history of rock and roll. The way they pull no punches and stay true to facts says alot about not only the writer's but also the band itself!! How many other band's have we seen such a personal look into the things that made them who they are today?? NONE! Most celeb's deny the ugly truth about everything from drinking to botox!!LOL. I highly reccommend this movie to everyone who has ever jammed to a Def Leppard song or those who have never heard the guys play---it will make you an instant fan!!!!

2190973,4,B0006Q93CE,"Talk about a truly unusual saga!  This is a re-enactment of the Def Leppard adventure, a saga that carries multiple turns of events typical among rock musicians and bands, yet made instantly distinctive by one crucial element, the story of drummer Rick Allen.

Hysteria starts off with a dramatic re-creation the automobile accident on December 31, 1984 near the British province of Sheffield in which Rick lost his left arm.  He's in his Corvette with his girlfriend Miirium, tearing up the Motorway towards Sheffield, the recent Def Leppard hit ""Rock of Ages"" blaring on the stereo.  Rick starts racing a British vehicle.  Going around a swift turn, the Corvette crashes through the left-hand barrier and rolls over several times. . . As the title sequence runs, we, the viewers are taken back to 1977 in Sheffield, itself.  It's a typical workday, and Joe Elliot (performed by Orlando Seale) is working on a pencil-drawn poster while he waits for the steam whistle.  When it blows, he leaves; the name he's been penciling in is Deaf Leopard.  After a rough day at his factory job, Joe is unfortunate to leave just late enough to miss the bus home.  But, he hooks up with guitarist Pete Willis (Nick Bagnall), whose band called Atomic Mass just lost its singer and lead guitarist.  Joe meets Pete's drummer Tony Kenning (Bret Watson) and bassist Rick Savage (Adam MacDonald), also known as ""Sav"" and auditions as a guitarist; the three of them say they prefer his singing.  When he suggests the new name of Deaf Leopard, Tony suggests changing the spelling to make it ""rock harder.""  Pete rounds out the group with a friend named Steve Clark (Karl Geary) as the lead player.

Nine months later, they're rehearsing at the local spoon factory, playing an early original song called ""Getcha Rocks Off,"" but Joe is dissatisfied with the output.  Tony's girlfriend enters the room and jealously coaxes Tony away from the rehearsal.  They get their first gig at a local school dance (at Steve's be-urging).  The gig is a triumph, except they only receive 8 quid per man, and Steve's hypercritical father refuses to compliment his son on the job he's done.  After the gig, the Def Leppard members are planning to cut a demonstration tape funded by Joe's parents, when Tony's girlfriend gives him an ultimatum, the band or his relationship, and he quits.  They replace him with fifteen-year-old Rick Allen (Tat Whalley) who demonstrates an uncanny knack behind the kit.  They record the demo, including an early version of ""Ridin' Into the Sun,"" and the gigs and attendance improve by leaps and bounds.  Backstage after a show one night, Joe spots promoter Peter Mensch (Dean McDermott) and recruits him as the band's manager.

Def Leppard release their first album and embark on their first American tour.  The audiences are ecstatic, and the single ""Hello America"" becomes a minor hit, but the band spawns less-than-positive reviews.  Upon their return to Britain, they get a call from legendary producer Mutt Lange (Anthony Michael Hall).  The production of their second album, High 'n' Dry proves tedious and painstaking to the young musicians who aren't used to Mutt's meticulous standards.  But, they're delighted with the results, especially what will be their first significant hit, ""Bringing On the Heartbreak.""  On tour one night, Pete walks offstage in the middle of ""Heartbreak"" and helps himself to booze.  Backstage after the show, the lads fight it out, and the other four decide to kick Pete out.  Afterwards,  Joe and Sav are at a pub in Sheffield and hear a sizzling guitar solo in the background, performed by Pete's eventual replacement, Phil Collen (Esteban Powell).

In the studio once again with Mutt Lange, Steve and Phil find they blend well, despite their sonic differences and Steve's internal doubts.  The third record, Pyromania is finished, and the reviews, in an about-face to the early ones, are decidedly positive; all the same, Steve is still plagued by his father's negative influince, which also fuels his own drinking problem.  The album goes on to spawn three gold singles.  The band tour for sixteen months after Pyromania's release and the success of the video for ""Photograph.""  Rick comes off the tour frustrated and desperate for a break.  Here is the instance of the gut-wrenching accident that would claim Rick's arm and, almost his life.

In hospital after the accident, doctors have re-attached Rick's arm, but he's far from in the clear.  Not wanting to dismiss him, the rest of Def Leppard talk about what they can do while they wait for him to resurface.  They're optimistic, even though his condition is critical.  In the interim, Steve and Phil, who call themselves ""The Terror Twins"" frequent pubs and get drunk together (Steve is still trying to drink his father out of his head).  Peter Mensch persuades them to double-date two American models he knows.  The date is a success, and Steve begins a relationship with his match, Lorelei Shellist (Amber Valletta).  Meanwhile, Rick is now in worse shape physically, and the doctors set him to have his arm permanently removed.  He dreams about being able to drum again, but at least, he's going to make a full recovery.  Afterwards, Phil gets into trouble by driving his car clear up to the front of his house and buying a fifteen thousand quid watch; he resolves to quit drinking and tries coaxing Steve to do the same (unsuccessfully).

In the meantime, Rick has expressed an interest in being able to play more with his feet and getting a set-up that would allow him to do so.  He reads a magazine article about how pilots can function with one arm, and his band mates present him with a new hybrid electronic kit with foot pedals at the left side.  At home, he's trying to practice on his new set and ends up embarrassing himself in front of the others by playing for them before he's ready.  Meanwhile, Steve's alcoholism worsens to the point when he ends up in the hospital just at the moment Mutt Lange turns up (after a leave of absence) to help them finish their fourth album.  In hospital, Joe and Lorelei learn that Steve's blood alcohol level far surpassed that of Led Zepplin's John Bonham.  In a rehabilitation home, Steve displays a complete lack of confidence in himself, claiming the other Def Leppard members ""should've backed a better horse.""  Meanwhile, Rick is improving on his new kit, but he still makes the odd mistake.  Lo and behold, Steve checks himself out of rehab, Joe dispatches Rick to find him, and he's discovered back at the pub.

The film culminates with a sellout stadium concert, in which the band triumphantly takes the stage to perform ""Pour Some Sugar On Me,"" which had taken them years to perfect.  They don't miss a note or a beat, and the audience is applauding thunderously.  Before the closing credits role, it's revealed in captions how Rick returned to Def Leppard as a full-fledged drummer and Steve lost his life as a result of his drinking.

When I first saw this film on VH1 (catching it at the point when Mutt lange was producing High 'n' Dry), I immediately caught a few inaccuracies.  For one thing, it's depicted that Rick Allen's severed arm remained re-attached for a matter of weeks after the car accident, not to mention that he was coherent throughout the whole tangled event.  However, Rick himself has said in interviews that his arm was only attached for 24 hours before infections set in, and he was out of it the whole time.  Not to mention, the incident with Steve's blood alcohol level exceeding that of John Bonham's took place after the events surrounding Rick's accident and the completion of the Hysteria record.  But, I also recognize how much more effective it was for the plot line to draw out the details of Rick's medical issues and reposition the moment of Steve's drinking incident. The real Steve Clark suffered bouts of stage fright when offstage, but he always performed sober and focused.  The film depicts his accelerated drinking as an aftereffect of the downtime after Rick's accident.  And, it was great the way they managed to make Tat Walley look as though he only had one arm.  In retrospect, I'm more than interested to know if Steve Clark's psyche was as damaged by his father, the way this plot depicted.

But, one thing I am kind of sore about is the title of the story, Hysteria.  Nowhere in the film or the soundtrack is there any reference to the album title or the song of the same name.  There may not have been room for it, but it would've been fitting.  That's the real reason I give it four out of five stars.",1238544000,,8606,4.801630434782608

2190992,4,B0006Q93CE,"I've been a huge fan of Def Leppard since the early 80's, and their longevity and mutli-faceted talents continue to amaze me 20+ years later.  This movie chronicles a relatively short but crucial period in the band's existence, from their founding to the accident that cost drummer Rick Allen his left arm, and his truly incredible determination to re-train himself to use his feet instead.  It ends with what I believe was their first public performance with Rick post-accident, at a Monsters of Rock concert - an amazing performance that made music headlines all over the world.

Def Leppard is one of the only bands whose story and music consistently trigger a multitude of different emotions for me.  I personally find the whole band and their story to be incredibly inspirational.  Obviously there's Rick Allen's story, which would be pretty hard to top.  I also think of Joe Elliott as a quintessential frontman, and he seems much more than that.  His passion for music and drive to succeed is palpable, and his and the other guys' determination to keep it together through some tough times is something anyone can take a lesson from.  I have all of their albums from On Through the Night to Yeah, and there's not a single one with a bad or even forgettable song.  My emotions run the gamut when I listen, from the happy-let's-party feeling I get from songs like Photograph and I Wanna Be Your Hero, to mellow-smooth with songs like Too Late for Love, Breathe a Sigh and Truth, to sad with White Lightning, Scar and Blood Runs Cold, to sexy with All Night (REALLY like that one), Slang, and I Wanna Touch You.  Their music captures an entire life, with all its twists and turns.

I'd in fact been resisting the whole mp3 player / iPod mania until I realized that I couldn't get all my Def Leppard CD's into one player, so if I ever meet them I'm going to tell them they owe me $150 bucks..... LOL

Anyway, back to the movie.... it ends just before the Hysteria, erm, hysteria, so it's hardly a complete picture of the band's career, but then again, 20+ years would be hard to take down to 2 hours of screen time.  The acting is slightly cheesy, but I thought everyone did an admirable job of portraying the band members as faithfully as possible.

Definitely recommended.",1178668800,6,2277,4.6318407960199
2190993,4,B0006Q93CE,"It's hard to make a movie about bands, two notable band with bigger movies were the Doors and the beatles, as well as countless other bands having films out their. When I saw this was coming to VH1, I was pumped. it shows the band from start up in Sheffield england to their biggest during the Hysteria tour.  It covers this period well, pete willis and his departure, the finding of Phil collins, and the rise of the terror twins. And, of course, how to handle a drummer who looses one essential tool...an arm.  My only critisism is the fact it was so short, and didn't go beyond hysteria. I wish it would have covered the loss of Steve to alcohol and the eventual addition of Vivian Campbell.  also, the video and stage footage was kinda cheesy, but its still leppard music.  If they would have cut out some of the cheesy stage footage and added a few more minutes of movie to cover through the arrival of Vivian, it would have been perfect in my book.  But, with only so much time, some things get cut, and this version is good enough. Check it out, entertaining.",1177545600,,1066,4.3908629441624365

I understand where the diehard fans are coming from when they all say that it was too short and didn't include a lot of important details, but come on now, you can only fit so much into 80-90 minute movie. Let's all cross our fingers and hope that one of these days a major studio will create a better/longer version of their story and cast better actors because Def Leppard's story deserves more than what VH1 dished out. Overall, I thought that it was good, and the only reason why I'm giving this a 5 is because I can't help but give VH1 props for trying. I'd strongly recommend this for any and every DL fan.",1174348800,,747,4.158620689655172
2190995,4,B0006Q93CE,"I thought this movie was really good but honestly I was hoping that it would go into further detail about when Steve Clark passed away but it didn't but overall it was good! The movie starts out right away when the drummer Rick Allen got into a car wreck so right off the bat it has action. It shows all the detail on what the band had to go through just to get where they are today and that is the best rock and roll band in the world...in my book anyway!!

And if you are a true Def Leppard fan as I am, then this movie will leave you very satisfied and wanting to watch it over and over again as i do. Thank you amazon and I will be ordering from you again shortly. Again Thanks!!

I am an old school, original, diehard Def Leppard fan, and I have been since the release of their first album, On Through the Night - I have devoutly followed them ever since.  This film could have been done a thousand times better.  It feels rushed, the actors aren't very good at portraying the band members, and it is just horribly disappointing.  Steve Clark's ultimate and untimely death receives barely a mention at the end of the film, a fault I personally can't see as excusable.  This band is legend.  If homage is to be paid to such a legend, it should be done so in a FAR better manner.  Is it worth owning, as a collector of DL memorabilia?  Really a personal choice, I do personally own it.

2191003,5,B0006Q93CE,"This was the name of the article I read in Hit Parader magazine when I first heard of Def Leppard in late 1981/early 1982.  I have been fan ever since I bought 'High N Dry.' at 12 years old.  I kept wondering why I like this movie.  Yeah the acting is kinda corny, the lip synching to the actual def lep songs is a little goofy, the low budget, etc.  And I know why I like it now: They are just a great band who have a very strong friendship.  How many other bands do you know of that kept their drummer after losing an arm and has been drumming with them 22 years later? That's damn cool to me.  Rick Allen is simply amazing in his bravery and determination.  Plus the music is great, another reason to watch the DVD.  All the band members are portrayed by relatively competent(but unknown) actors and it's easy to get into the movie and believe they are def leppard except for the actor who portrays Joe Elliot.  He kinda took me out of the movie cos he didn't really look like real Elliot or act/talk like him perhaps(not to mention the bad hair).  Other than that, the movie was great.  The actor who portrays Steve Clark impressed me the most and I wish they would've explored his problems more with his father, who as far as this movie showed, had a severe impact on his life up until his death in 1991.  Yes it's cheesy and low budget but if it has some great funny moments, dramatic moments and everything in between.  Great band.  Great movie.  It does what it should: It tells thier story.  It would have been interesting if they went up to present day and not stopped at approximately 1987 while on the Hysteria tour(which I've been to... simply awesome).  I wish the move whould've been longer than it's 89 minutes.  The DVD is the most bare bones of any DVD I've EVER seen but it's worth it.  The main menu has 'play' and 'chapter selection' and THAT'S IT.  No audio/subtitles, bonus features, trailers, nothing.  Kinda odd.  I hope they expand on this movie someday and perhaps get the real Leps involved.  Any fan of Def Lep should check out the DVD ""Classic albums: the making of Hysteria""... you will simply drool at all the bonus stuff on that.

It's hard to put Hysteria into words. As the viewer you follow Deaf Leopard on their rise from a bunch of kooky kids that like to polka to a full fledged rock supergroup that sings songs like Photograph and Rocket(their tribute to Roger Clemens, little known fact there kids). They're english, so their teeth aren't really healthy and they have accents. One of the guys, Steve Clark, drinks like a freakin fish. He's like me in Dallas getting blitzed like Tony Eason against the 85 bears. He drinks himself to death by the end. The drummer gets in a car accident and loses one of his two arms. You'd think the band would fire him at that point because there is no way in hell the guy could play drums with one ahm. Slap me in the calf with a trout Tom, he does it. I was so inspired that I went out and started a deaf Leapord cover band called Hard of hearing cougar. I was on lead vocals because I'm hot and can shake my butt like a martini on acid. I put on an over the top show. Burns was on keyboards even though they didn't have a keyboard player. Well, we added keyboards to their songs and crowd quickly realized how great Deaf Leopard could've been. JAbs played bass and lead guitar at the same time. How, I don't know, it's jabs. Kroll tucked one arm in his shirt and played drums. Brennan managed the band and booked us in places like Sokol Hall and Chucky Cheeses(he knew the manager). He made us huge money and only kept 3%.

8042264,5,B0006Q93CE,"Usually i don't care for made for tv movies. This is one of the best movies about a band I have ever seen. Genuinely touching, shows the human side of the Def Lep boys. Great music and rekindled my interest in their music. I was a huge fan growing up but hadn't listened to them in years til I saw this on late one night a month ago or so. Buy it you won't be dissapointed.",1502582400,,373,3.9210526315789473
