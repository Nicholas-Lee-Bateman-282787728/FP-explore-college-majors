7616925,5,B01B2CX0LU,"I know it's only March, but I think this just might be the best movie I've seen this year so far.  We went to see it this morning in IMAX 3D and while I expected it to be good based on the early reviews, I wasn't expecting it to be this good and to work so well on so many different levels.  This is a ridiculously entertaining movie with plenty of action and fiercely intelligent writing that doesn't speak down to or condescend the kids in the audience, while at the same time challenging adults to rethink the way that fear and prejudice can tear us apart.

The storyline starts by following young rabbit Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) in her dream of becoming the first bunny cop on the police force in the thriving metropolis of Zootopia.  At this point, the story seems to be a somewhat familiar ode to determination in the face of incredible odds and the value of persistence.  Once on the force, though, it quickly turns a corner into an intriguing crime mystery in the vein of Chinatown and L.A.Confidential.  After being immediately put on parking duty, Judy has a run in with a scheming fox con-artist (voiced by Jason Bateman) and soon finds herself forced to solve a missing otter case or be dropped from the force.  From then on, prepare yourself for a wild ride from an animation studio clearly at the top of their game.

While that plot may sound fairly simple and maybe less than original, let me say that it is anything but.  The dialogue, pacing, and character development are all outstanding and the distrust and fear that exists between the ""predator"" species and other inhabitants of Zootopia serves as a very timely allegory for the some of the complex issues that are currently dividing the U.S. in this historical, stranger than fiction election season we are in right now.  At the same time, I felt like it also addresses these issues without being preachy or dogmatic, which is not easy to do.

Obviously, many of the kids might not pick up on these parallels or the clever references to ""the Godfather"" or ""Breaking Bad"", but I bet the very positive messages will sink in and if nothing else it is extremely entertaining.  The animation is absolutely top-notch and made great use of the IMAX 3D format, but I think it would play equally well in 2D.  My four year-old son normally gets very restless after the first hour of any movie, but this one had his rapt attention throughout.  When we left the theater, he turned to me and my wife and said ""wow, that was a really, really good movie.""  We both wholeheartedly agreed, although we probably all liked it for different reasons.

Overall, as the father of a young kid I'm very happy that there seem to be more and more movies like this being made and I can't wait to get this on home video.",1457136000,67,2778,4.526

Kids will like the animals talking and running around. It kept my kids' eyes glued to the theater and TV screens.

7617036,3,B01B2CX0LU,"Well, what can I say about this movie. As always, it is beautifully animated and has an interesting story...that is, if you don't mind something a little on the dark side like prey vs. predator as well as the politically correct B.S. I've heard countless people complain about this (like the infamous 'only rabbits can call other rabbits cute' crap, and I know darn well what that alludes to). The bottom line is, this is the movie that despite the extreme work that went into it, the creators must have been on dope because that's what it comes across as. In fact, I no longer like anything by Disney because of this movie, because it represents an extreme departure from what Disney normally does (I didn't like the ketchup scene representing blood either at the start of the movie - even though it was only ketchup, I still felt it repugnant and vastly inappropriate for younger viewers). It's almost as if this movie was made by a completely different animation company.

I won't be buying any more Disney movies.",1518652800,,1017,4.681564245810056

7617050,5,B01B2CX0LU,"I fully expected to hate it, but...  This is no Lion King or Moana or other Disney trash.  This may be the best Disney animation movie since the days of Walt Disney himself.  The animation is astoundingly good: one expects Disney studios to be good at animation, of course, but here they have hit what seems the perfect sweet spot between cartoon animation (Sleeping Beauty, etc., from the Walt Disney days) and CG fabrication: the characters have a physical presence that matches their species, the fur/skin is spectacularly good, but their faces retain sufficient cartoonish traits to make them endearing as cartoon characters.  The storyline is fun and surprisingly grownup, but should go over well (with a bit of terror, perhaps) with little ones too.  It's fast-paced, funny without falling into the kind of silliness or farce that too many Disney productions have given us in the last 20 years, and, as the best movies always do, makes us think -- here about nature, animals, humans, civilization, etc.

Had to return because Blu Ray disc was warped or damaged and it kept skipping around at the end! The best park i couldn't even watch.

She manages to get her friends tickets back, when they were taken by Gideon Gray. Judy Hops enters the academy, training vigorously, determined to make her dream come true. When she does, she leaves her family, very large family, to go to Zootopia. Officer Hops is assigned parking duty for her first task. When crocus bulbs were stolen, Hops goes after and captures the crook. Eventually she is given a two day period to find Emit Otterton, and with Nick Wilde helping, the two have an adventure ahead. But at one point, Hops feels that she makes a mistake that cannot be fixed, so she quit and went home. After learning some valuable information, she is determined to not give in. One of my favourite scenes is when Nick accompanies Judy to the Department of Mammal Vehicles, where we meet Flash. Something so encouraging and uplifting about this beautifully animated program.

7617265,3,B01B2CX0LU,"I purchased this movie to show in French (with English subtitles) for my middle school French language students because it fits in with our unit about animals, their personalities, and their body parts. The description in the Amazon listing says that it has French as an option for language, but then when I look at the back of the box it says that French is only an option in Canada.

If the French language option is, indeed, only available in Canada (though I thought they were in the same zone as us?), then I will be returning this product as it is not useful to me.

If it is actually an option to play the movie in French, then I will be keeping it. I suppose I need to do a bit more digging before I open it.",1494374400,,716,4.181159420289855

I asked for a refund.  It does not have a deep message like some seem to think.  Its just a bunch of left wing propaganda.  When the bunny reams out the tiger for calling her ""cute"" and states that only bunnies can call other bunnies ""cute"" the movie tipped into an excessively preachy tone.  Not to mention that i have 2 daughters and I would never support them watching something that is so degrading.  I work with many successful women who are measured by their worth not their sex.  This movie seems to think that everyone is sexist and racist and attempts to hold others back.  I object.

It is horrible and boring.  My daughter hates.  We could not stomach more than like 20 minutes before we had to turn it off.

7617308,4,B01B2CX0LU,"I am surprised to know Zooptopia is a Disney film. The plot is rather obscure with a lot of violence for a kiddy family film. In a way this could be a good and bad thing. Good for older viewers that won't feel like their brain is frying. However, the darker tone of this film that gives me memories of several 80's animated classics such as An American Tail or The Secret of NIMH might confuse the younger kids.

The animation is indeed exquisite (although I've heard a lot of complaints about poor shadow coloring and other lighting effects from critics with a graphics art background) and the interaction between the main characters is a common trope of comedy detective films. The strange thing about this movie is that all of the humanoid animals are mammals. No lizards and birds?

I give the film 4 out of 5 because while it's a good movie, it didn't blow me away either. I am also concerned about the copyright lawsuit that is probably going to end up in a juicy settlement from a character designer that patented his script ""Zootopia"" (yes, it seems like Disney not only stole his basic plot idea and rough character design sketches, they didn't even bother to change the title of the story).

7617343,2,B01B2CX0LU,"Wistful, fluffy bunny Judy Hopps blatantly disregards the wisdom and concerns of her bunny rabbit parents and fulfills her lifelong (four or five years? I don't know...she's obviously seventeen or so in human metaphorical years) goal of heading to Zootopia (a play on the word Utopia, in case you missed it), a multicultural metropolis in which every animal and every gender get along equally and no one has any problems ever. But such is not really the case, even in CGI cartoonville, and soon enough Judy (who demands that she not be called ""cute"" by anyone, because apparently that's offensive or some nonsense) is moved from lower-rung traffic cop to ambitious public detective. Along the way, she meets a con artist named Nick, a fox who refuses to be out-foxed (it's a stereotype thing, get it?) and even begins to fall for the attractively drawn little bunny himself after the two share many adventures together. Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are more than adequate as voice actors here, and the Disney animation is about as sharp as it has been of late. The animal designs, too, are well done, featuring a plethora of species that roam the city in brightly lighted full color clothing and elaborate CGI designed sets.
I will admit that these characters are well-designed (Judy is a cute character). I will admit that I even laughed a few times throughout. I will confess to having enjoyed some of the humorous interplay between Nick and Judy. The movie should, in all seriousness, be all out fun and not be thought of as a by-product from these fevered film producers's wild and weird imaginations. But, in truth, ZOOTOPIA is a film with a harmful message. Not only is Judy marketed to emerging young girls in this country (whose heads have already been corrupted by such publically tolerated malignities as Feminism) who will now not only be encouraged to think of their parents as ""slow,"" ""resentful,"" and ""not in step with the times,"" but also to go running towards the same multicultural sub-center that the ""Zootopia"" in the film represents...namely, Hollywood, California! While it might be obvious what the pedophilic community has in mind for the younger people that they are trying to attract to head on out there and ""see everything,"" such subliminal messages will go unnoticed amongst very young children. And not only is ZOOTOPIA guilty of trying to promote the equality agenda, but it is also a movie aimed more at adults and children alike. When did the movies aimed at children decide to become so politicized? And why do ticket buyers think that such things are a good idea?
Anyway, perhaps the real backlash against this release will come with a plaintiff's case filed only yesterday, Tuesday, March 21st, 2017. It seems that writer Gary Goldman (you know him from his work on MINORITY REPORT and TOTAL RECALL) has alleged that the Disney company lifted several ideas and characters from a project that he had pitched to the Disney executives in both 2000 and 2009, respectively, but was politely told by the powers that be to get lost. Well, not long after, of course, ZOOTOPIA came limping into theaters in a Johnny-come-lately fashion, and the world went mad for it. ""How original!"" the audiences exclaimed (not taking into account the fact that Disney has been busily producing such original and unheard of titles as of late, movies called CINDERELLA and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, just to name a couple). Disney's spokesperson promptly issued a statement saying that Mister Goldman's carping was ""ridden with patently false allegations"" (which, keep in mind, is not the same as saying that the allegations were untrue). I, for one, believe in Mister Goldman. And I hope he fights these thieves all the way down the line, baby! The Hollywood entertainment industry is long overdue for a good expose that accurately paints them as the money hungry, creatively bankrupt idea thieves that they so undeniably are. I will be following this case myself to see what becomes of Mister Goldman's lawsuit. If you Google this case (or watch any of the videos on YouTube that have been uploaded about the recent litigation) then you will learn for yourself that Goldman's concepts, script, and original property were in fact stolen outright by the ""creative"" team at Disney. These thieves think that by simply changing around a few elements here and there (and by waiting several years before they go public with a film) that they can then discredit the original writer for his/her early contributions that gave the production staff all of their ""fresh"" ideas in the first place. I am very happy to see that Mister Goldman is standing up for himself, and if he wins this it will certainly show other writers and creators that they can fight back and oppose the bullies. Such creative thievery is what keeps many talented writers and artists from wanting to work in Hollywood or with any of the major film studios. How do we know that Mister Goldman is on the level? Well, the evidence is most clear once you compare the images in those YouTube videos. But secondly, I have read print interviews with Mister Goldman in which he has stated that he has ideas for politics and how to implement them in the world, and how frustrated that he feels with his many rushes of sudden creativity. Well, Hollywood certainly doesn't want to hear him out. Perhaps because of his irascible nature, the executives chose just to pirate his original work rather than simply trying to figure out how to have a workable relationship with the man himself (God knows that BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA wasn't the happiest of experiences for Mister Goldman). ZOOTOPIA, therefore, does not signal Disney's mass exodus from the bowels of creative desolation, far from it. In fact, it's a lighting rod of a stinker heading straight for the direct-to-DVD paradise where future ""original"" Disney movies are going to be finding themselves. I realize that the public liked this puppy and that it grossed a few dollars at the ticket booths, but, for me, the political correctness and the touchy-touchy attitude of princess Hopps was more than I could stomach. What happened to the days of good animation, you know?
Although the intellectual tomb raiders who pilfered from Mister Goldman's mine of ideas have currently sent me hurtling downwards in a spiral of burned out rage, I will add that the Blu-Ray's picture and sound is quite good and that the extras (including a fine 'making of' in which the production team explain how they stole their ideas from Mister Goldman--just kidding!--how they created the Judy Hopps character, how Nick came to be, how the story conferences turned out, etc.) are a bit more worthy than the typical kiddie stuff that we usually see on Disney digital movie releases for home viewing. The Blu-Ray/DVD combo set is, in terms of overall presentation, a nicely crafted package. But movies like ZOOTOPIA are offensive, not the least of which because they claim to have a way of solving society's problems (insert giggle here) based upon unrealistic premises (such as pressing for the wider acceptance of multiculturalism) but also because they seem to be sending messages to the young that their parents (now considered backwards types, unworthy of true respect) don't really know what is best for them. The character of Judy represents the kind of rootless, rebellious young lady of the 21st century, a whimsical but inwardly spiteful type who just knows that something out there is more ""inviting"" than her boring old life with her folks. Zootopia, the megalopolis of the title, beckons to the young like candy upon a store shelf as seen from the POV of a stroller. And yet Zootopia is not an ideal place, it's a place that has learned to ignore (or even more insultingly, correct) the unending tensions that lie just beneath the surface. If there were such a place as Zootopia, I guarantee you that it wouldn't be safe. In fact, there may come a day when none of us feel safe ever. If you watch this movie more carefully the next time, see if you can spot its covert agenda. The script is so worried about being politically correct that often times the humor and joy of the picture suffers as a result of all the constant cultural policing. And this is the kind of world that we have to live in. Of course, the liberal critics loved the movie because they too are politically correct secret policemen who apparently have no trouble navigating the odd corridors of public mores and social relations that the picture presents.",1490140800,,8541,4.862731640356897

The premise is wonderful of evolved intelligent cultured animals trying to live to their fullest potential despite existing speciesism (prejudice against specific species of animals by others).  As with many Disney first run projects, the artwork is astounding--they've created different ecospheres (desert, tundra, tropical rainforest, etc) for all the different types of animal communities that are just stunning.

The characters are interesting, cute, well-written and the voice acting is great. Although I suppose this is an ""all-ages"" movie, you don't need kids to watch this and the movie can be easily recommended for adults. The story manages to keep things interesting enough, and even though the ""message"" is occasionally hammered in a bit heavy-handedly it does not take away from the main thing which is the interactions between the interesting and well-written characters. The humor is also above-average for a kid-friendly movie without cheap fart jokes or overly annoying sidekick characters.

Overall, one of the best animated movies made. I just wish they would render and make it avalaible in 4k.

7617383,5,B01B2CX0LU,"""Zootopia"" (for some reason known as ""Zootropolis"" in Europe) is a Disney computer animated film that takes place in a mammalian utopia in which all its animals, predatory and non-predatory, live together peacefully.

A sophisticated merging of utopian science fiction with a gumshoe detective story, this relates the unlikely partnership between a pint-sized rabbit police officer and a red fox con artist as they uncover a conspiracy involving disappearing animals.  It's also a hilarious movie, maybe even more so to adults than children, with one sequence that could be considered the funniest sequence ever put in an animated film. (Those who've seen ""Zootopia"" know what I'm talking about.)

This has everything a great animated feature could have: intriguing plot, adorable characters, uproarious comedy, emotional resonances, and a moralistic theme.  And some of the best animation ever seen in a cartoon feature.  Voiced by Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons and Octavia Spencer, with Ginnifer Goodman perfect as the voice of the rabbit cop Judy Hopps, this is Disney's 55th animated feature, and an indubitable masterpiece in the art of animation.  Cartoon enthusiast or not, this is required viewing for every movie lover.",1488672000,4,1238,5.421875

7617407,4,B01B2CX0LU,"Bottom Line First: Highly recommended. Zootopia is family friendly as you would expect from a Disney production. Beyond expectations is some of the finest animations. The landscapes, the detailing the textures are rendered to a degree that make this movie worth watching with the sound off. Plot lines and pacing are per the Disney formula. It is also somewhat sophisticated and therefore more interesting for the older and adult members of the family. This is a movie you and your family will want to see more than once.

If I have a problem with Zootopia is in the mix of humor and danger. I would have preferred a slightly less dramatic plot and more humor. A month after watching the movie one will remember the jokes built around the sloths and maybe one of the visual jokes and not much else.

The message of Zootopia is tolerance. A sympathetic audience is expected to learn that individual talent is more important than stereotypes. Meantime the fox is sly, the bunny is quick and her family is highly reproductive. The fat cop loves doughnuts and politicians cannot be trusted. So stereotyping is bad and stereotypes are good entertainment sounds confusing. Beside this major cross messaging, I have a quibble about making a Rabbit, Officer Hops our strong female star of Zootopia, function in a world of animals where she is extremely out of scale for the job.

Agreed too much thinking. Zootopia is a fun and beautiful movie",1487635200,2,1435,4.82520325203252

7617411,5,B01B2CX0LU,"In animation,the concept of anthropomorphic animals...ones that act human,walk upright,wear clothes,speak English...is certainly nothing new. In fact,it's been around so long,it's practically a standard. But in this 2016 computer-animated feature from Walt Disney Studios,the notion is given a new wrinkle,as it serves as a backdrop to an entertaining tale about conquering xenophobia.
Rural-born rabbit Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) realizes her childhood ambitions of becoming a police officer,but once moving to the mammal-dominated city known as Zootopia,she finds herself on a police force made up of much larger predator animals...and unwillingly in the uniform of a meter maid. Opportunity presents itself as she learns of a missing-persons case (or more accurately,a missing otter),and convinces her superiors to let her take the case. Partnered with an initially unwilling fox con artist Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman),the pair eventually bond as their search takes them all over the farthest reaches of the city,as they discover in the course of their investigation that they have more in common than they first believed. They also discover that what they thought might be a simple kidnapping is actually much more,something that could affect the entire city.
From start to finish,this is a wildly entertaining movie...the vocal cast also includes Idris Elba,J.K. Simmons,Jenny Slate and a memorable scene including Tommy Chong.",1487635200,,1444,5.72093023255814

There is also a weasel in the story, who moves just how you would expect: fast and slithery (if that's a word). Great humor throughout as well; I was constantly laughing.

7617422,5,B01B2CX0LU,"You really have to hand it to Disney- a little over a decade ago these guys were grasping for straws to gain a foothold in the CG animated feature film game.  Its easy to forget that Pixar hadnt always been a part of the Disney empire but rather a completely separate entity; one that was briefly considering partnering up with one of the other major studios for distribution besides.  Or another way of saying it- they were Disneys competition.

And while Pixar was pumping out blockbuster hit after blockbuster hit, Disney was struggling to hang.  They had films like Chicken Little and Valiant and The Wild but Toy Story and Monsters Inc. these certainly were not.

Of course, in time Disney would prove successful in purchasing and absorbing Pixar into their collective whole and is it safe to say the quality of their CG animated features improved?  Look at the critical reception and box office numbers for Tangled, Frozen, Big Hero 6 and now Zootopia respectively.  There is no question Disney has taken their rightful place in the throne as the king of the CG animated film kingdom.  Even if it took them on a long and rather unorthodox path to get here.

In the event that youve been living in a cave or under a rock, Zootopia (also known as Zootropolis in Europe and the Middle East) is the 2016 American 3D computer-animated comedy-adventure film by Walt Disney Pictures.  It also just so happens to be Disneys 55th animated feature film.

It was built on a budget of $150-million dollars and returned an absolutely staggering $1.024-billion from the box office alone.  These totals are only a fraction of the return revenue Disney pocketed on merchandising, licensing, the home DVD release etc.

Believe it or not, even with such a successful box office run, it still managed to come in at only the fourth highest-grossing film of 2016 (do keep in mind it had to compete with Pixars own Finding Dory, a Marvel Civil War and a new Star Wars film- Dont feel too bad as every one of these properties is owned by Disney).

Along the way Zootopia was recognized for many of its achievements, having won the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature, the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature, and the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film.  It was also nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film and an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

The story tells of an anthropomorphic world where where predators and prey species peacefully coexist.  We follow along with a determined rabbit-protagonist in Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin).  Having longed to be a police officer since youth, she finally gets the chance, thanks to a mammal-inclusion effort focused on recruiting cops of diverse backgrounds.

She learns fairly quickly that starting at the bottom means meter maid detail and, after being hustled by a smooth-talking fox (Jason Bateman) on her first day, ends up on a high profile case by sheer chance.  From this point on, the film is literally a crime/ mystery piece not unlike something you might see on CSI (minus the sexual overtones, of course).

It is here, in the plot and narrative itself that Zootopia draws its greatest strength:  The viewer is treated to a thoughtful and never-preachy examination of the real society in which we all live, complete with its prejudices and stereotypes.  At the same time we get a colorful, comedic and clever mystery tale that hits all of its marks.  Pacing is spectacular as well, with its fairly lengthy (1 hour, 49 minute) run-time coming all too quickly.

Visually the film is an absolute delight as well- with bright, colorful set pieces, beautifully animated and emoted character models and the type of background detail that makes multiple viewings an absolute must.

Scoring is likewise sweeping yet sublime in its emotional range; thanks in no small part to Disneys having called upon Pixar staple maestro Michael Giacchino to provide the notes.

About the only miss I can come up with in this entire production was Disneys having cast Shakira to play the pop musician named Gazelle.  You take a cue from DreamWorks on this one and hire Giselle just for the tongue-in-cheek cache.

In conclusion, Zootopia may have taken second fiddle to Finding Dory in the box office but it is clearly the superior film on most every level from creativity, originality, to characterization and even underlying morale.  This one has no shortage of hype of heaped upon it but its easy to add a little more to the pile when it is well deserved.  And well deserved it is indeed.",1487203200,,4566,4.815384615384615

Worth rewatching, without a doubt.",1486684800,,336,4.711864406779661
7617439,5,B01B2CX0LU,"Zootopia is an exhilarating, wonderful romp through a magical world of animated characters.  The music is beautiful, uplifting, and so appropriate to the content. Ginnifer Goodwin does outstanding work voicing and singing the protagonist.  Though ostensibly a ""kiddie"" movie, Zootopiia delivers serious messages to not just children but also adults on the importance of fairness, and treating all without regard to prejudice or discrimination.  A strong anti-bullying point is also made.  Disney once again shines as a leader in unsurpassed technical animation achievement, especially while delivering sweet (yet not saccharine), superbly voiced character development, all wrapped in a musically compelling, charming and humorous motion picture with timeless messages of doing the right thing and celebrating our differences.",1486684800,,825,6.0256410256410255

So why don't they?  With beautiful, detailed animation, jarring plot twists and even some hysterical jokes and movie/T.V. references, this film also carries with it a very important lesson that could not be more timely for both children and adults.  It perfectly illustrates, in a very real way, how subtle prejudices and privileges are learned, and can easily ""evolve"" into downright discrimination.  After generations of predators vs. prey, will the citizens of Zootopia, who are so very different from each other, ever be capable of looking past their differences in a time of crisis and distrust?",1484524800,,767,5.112

7617606,4,B01B2CX0LU,"Probably the best Disney movie ever, after The Lion King and Bambi, and my favorite after Lilo and Stitch. They borrowed from the Robin Hood art style and made it a modern day Tail Spin City.

I have to laugh at people who point out aspects of the film as subliminal social commentary. I've read that because the animals aren't portrayed interbreeding that it promotes separatism and classism. That because they are all mammals and not birds, reptiles, fish or insects that somehow these missing animals were ommitted because they are worth less. Even that the film's positive message of trying to be who you want to be is suggestive to challenging sexual and gender identities. To all those, I say, relax.

It's a buddy-cop movie with talking animals. It's funny, it portrays main characters as confident and self-reliant and it makes bold statements that should be considered. Oh, and it has a Breaking Bad reference in a Disney cartoon. Awesome.

Reactionaries aside, if you like Disney, check it out.",1484438400,,1004,4.894117647058824

7617679,4,B01B2CX0LU,"For their next original animated film after Big Hero 6, Disney decided to make an all-anthropomorphic animal film several months before the recent Sing theatrical release. Helmed by Disney regular Bryan Howard, and Simpsons alumni Rich Moore, Zootopia is similar Disney's regular habit of making the entire cast be talking animals, but this is one of the first ones where the entire cast is sentient mammals living in a modern day society.

 Judy Hopps is an energetic young rabbit from the country who becomes the first bunny to join the police force of the capitol city of Zootopia, which is in a world where animals have ""evolved"" to the point where predators and prey can live together in harmony. On her first day, Judy is assigned with being a meter maid, but comes across a con artist fox Nick. This is shoved aside though as the police chief gets railroaded into giving her the task of finding one of several predators that have gone missing, but Judy has to solve it in 2 days or give up her badge. Judy cons Nick into helping her find the missing predators, and their investigation leads to them meeting with the local mafia, along with several other comedic misadventures. The unlikely duo seemingly find that the whole scheme was fronted by the mayor, and Judy is praised for her work, but she ultimately quits as she thinks there is something more sinister going on. After spending some time with her family back in the country, Judy realizes what the real cause behind the crimes was, and heads back to Zootopia to team up with Nick to catch the true culprits.

 Disney seriously went out of there way to make this a diverse cast and metropolitan background with all the eclectic animal characters. The 3-D animation really works incredibly well, and provides a tangible amount of realism for the otherwise cartoonish critters. Very similar to the Blacksad European comics, but set in present day.

7617699,2,B01B2CX0LU,"To say I was really disappointed with this movie would be an understatement.  While there were lots of ""cute"" lines and funny characters, these were obscured by all the subtle and not so subtle politically correct agendas.  When I watch movies, I enjoy being entertained because the movie is funny or because there is some depth to it - think Wall-E or Inside Out in the same genre.  This was a waste of time and so much so that I won't even take the time to enumerate all that was wrong with it.",1483488000,,496,4.311827956989247

7617701,1,B01B2CX0LU,"Definitely PG rated. Would not suggest for children under 10. At one point they go to a ""naturalist club"" where all the animals are naked and in suggestive manner, they even mention a ""pleasure pool"".  I just didn't find this appropriate for my 7 year old, even though they didn't understand that real meaning behind it all. I don't understand why kids movies have to be filled with secret adult content. We stopped watching the movie at this part but I have now read online that there are also scary moments in the movie that may frighten younger children. I definitely will take the PG rating more seriously from not on and really do my research before watching movies with my little ones. I hope this review is helpful for those with small children.",1483488000,7,752,4.611940298507463

But even so I would think it'd be scary for most kids under 5 because of the sudden ""wild"" animals that jump out and the other bad guys.

7617753,5,B01B2CX0LU,"Children (and adults) sometimes have a hard time understanding that they can choose their behaviors and responses to others. This movie has excellent messaging about how individuals choose who they want to be as they move through the world, how they can choose how to respond to others and to events rather than blaming others. We cannot control others, but we can control ourselves. This is not a super blatant message in the movie, but it is certainly what I got from it. The more obvious message is that we shouldn't judge others based on preconceptions, but rather on them as individuals. This makes an excellent companion movie to Inside Out. Movies like this are certainly making it easier to help children understand how to recognize and modulate their emotions and behaviors. I highly recommend it.",1483056000,,806,4.9338235294117645

7617810,4,B01B2CX0LU,"The DMV sloth scene killed it but the laughs were far fewer throughout the rest of the movie from what I expected. Still, the movie satisfies in so many ways and will keep a smile on your face as you root for plucky Rabbit Judy Hopps as she tries to take a nibble out of crime but is obviously the underdog of the story. Youll also root for plucky Nick Wilde, the fox who is out to make a quick buck basically by reorganizing and re-purposing items (I suppose hed be a Greenies dream). Wilde gets roped into helping Hopps after he suckers her and his world-weary vision of Zootopia is slowly worn down by Hopps always-can-do attitude. But far beyond being just a buddy cop and triumphant underdog story Zootopia does something that the best science fiction does: it discusses an ideal (utopia) and critiques it by playing up its potential flaws. Zootopia is a veritable utopia as animals of all sorts, herbivores and carnivores, live together in peaceful harmony and communities get along (at least they seem to; one must wonder how much crime and seediness exists in this world that still has mobstersbut this is never explored). You can be completely opposite of what your biology would suggest and still be a success (such as a tubby tabby, a fat leopard who is into boy bands and works as the police receptionist) because society has found a way to breed out your flaws and make you safe. The elephant can get in touch with his inner mouse if he wanted. But the critique is that despite a persons ability to transcend they are still beset by their biology whether they want to be or not and that societal distrust and willingness to be zenophobic or <<insert prefix here>>phobic (as is our current vernacular and wrong-headed way of understanding differences) is lurking, even looming not far behind the curtain of all-is-well pretence. And because of this (supposed) weakness the masses are easily (mis)led. Case in point: Zootopia ends where it begins and makes us feel that all can be right in the world as long as we believe it and want it and work for it but reality hasn't borne this out; quite the opposite in fact. If what Zootopias utopian moral tells us were true then thered be no need for a Judy Hopps, police officer. Thered be no need for cops. Zootopia exists as a desire, as a dream, as a hope. As does utopia. But I do appreciate that the talking animal flick had more on its mind than being cute, fluffy, and funny. Its all of that and more!",1482624000,,2463,4.537078651685393
7617811,5,B01B2CX0LU,"This movie has it all. Stunning visuals, great characters,  a heart warning story and comedy. Judy Hopps is the first bunny police officer ever in Zootopia's history. All she wants to do is prove that she can do anything the bigger animals can. Her sheer determination, is what  drives her to do her best. If you're someone who's been treated like she was and told you would never amount to anything. Then you should watch this movie and reevaluate yourself.  Because, I grantee anyone can really relate to Judy's character. It's all around enjoyable movie I'd totally  recommend it to anyone.",1482624000,,593,4.841584158415841

7617877,4,B01B2CX0LU,"Zootopia is a very fun Disney movie. However, on first viewing in the theaters, there was something about the movie (particularly in the last half-hour) that rubbed me the wrong way. It was that the movie became somewhat political towards the end. Now there are some positive, moral messages to try and help balance it out, and it is interesting to see current-day political issues referenced in a cartoon to a degree, but overall, even if they won't get it, why put it in a movie aimed at kids?

Because the political elements do bring the overall movie down a little. The rest of it is, for the most part, a lot of fun. The characters are fun. The animation is fantastic. Shakira's song is great. The dialogue and banter is all extremely top-notch clever. But the film's political turn makes the clever story take somewhat of a backseat in my opinion.

If you like politics (particularly liberal) in your movies, then you will probably love it. But families looking for old-fashioned Disney fun won't find a lot of that here (Moana has more of that). It's still a lot of fun at times, and still worth watching for the animation and the inside Disney jokes, but it's not quite a classic. 3.7 out of 5.",1481760000,,1202,4.560185185185185

7617962,5,B01B2CX0LU,"Great for any kid or adult.  Zootopia focuses on the very relevant issue of racism and crime statistics, and manages to come out of it clean, without making it 'on the nose'. One of those rare examples of humanistic and contemplative Disney movies when the complicity of ethical values is dissected so well in a way that doesn't feel didactic.

In many kids movies and cartoons, there is always right and wrong in such a polarized manner, that they rarely prepare kids for the grey area we often find ourselves in, in real life. The movie follows a 'hero' that starts on the 'right' side of the equation, and is even the victim of racism herself -- and yet, all of a sudden, finds herself in the position of an anti-hero; where she unwillingly encourages institutionalized racism. What makes her the real hero of the film is that she risks her status to reverse the cycle from within the system and succeeds.

There's also Shakira in the movie by the way.",1481155200,,955,4.573099415204679

Basically, it shows with family fun & laughter, that setting aside old ideas may be a good idea, but not as easily accomplished. Like real life, some ideas are hard for some to let go of.

7618091,5,B01B2CX0LU,"Disarmingly simple, but has plot twists, emotional struggles, conflicts within conflicts, and excellent animation.  Discusses real human issues and problems. (But cleverly disguised as talking animal issues) If it were a film with human actors and without animation-only scenes, it would work as well.  Watch it with the kids. You both will get some jokes together and other  jokes only the adults will get. if you don't think anything is funny in this film then you have a serious personality disorder.

7618140,1,B01B2CX0LU,"Divisive propaganda designed to slant young viewers.  We just got done with an election where half the nation told the other half that we are bigoted, hateful, and uneducated, and then I watch this.  We couldn't enjoy the film because from the beginning, a young viewer will be taught that rural working class people are mean and uneducated, have too many children, are silly, arrow-minded parents, and they are foolish enough to pray.  The theme song is 'Try Everything'.  There is glorification and near-worship of celebrity.  Slander of Boy Scouts of America is the most blatant dig.  They use a recognizable scout uniform, a shortened version of the actual scout oath and promise, and then the scouts are shown as cruel and scary.  Obviously since BSA decided it didn't want gay men going on sleepovers with our sons, this is the retaliation.  Now when young boys may join BSA, Disney has attempted to set a cruel and scary memory as deterrent.  How dare we have an opinion different from liberal ideology, right?  If we are not urban liberals, our children must be indoctrinated until they are, apparently.
I'm sure this is a great film if you are an urban liberal household.  However, if you are not an urban liberal, you will easily recognize this as the propaganda piece that it was carefully designed to be.  No more Disney for us.  They are not to be trusted with the minds and morals of our children.  I am very disappointed in their efforts to further divide our culture and silence those of us who don't march in lock step with their ideology.",1478822400,8,1556,4.714814814814815

It is full of good fun, great gags, and a wonderful story about dealing with different people.

In fact the characterization is key. It's the odd couple of rabbit officer Judy Hopps and shady fox Nick Wildecity mouse, country mouse; idealist, jaded; prey, predator; female, male. Yes, these are stereotypes, even cliches. But Disney brings a novel vibrancy to the duo, as vibrant as the colors and playful animation.

Moreover, the secondary characterswhich is typical for Pixarare a hoot. There is a lushness to the back-story and background, even if the fugues seem hackneyedthe mean bosses, etc.

The plotting was interesting, and there was just enough foreshadowing that we did not feel cheated. Although the denouement came close to being a deus ex machina. Yet they inserted the flashbacks to explain how thing happened.

Now this film's theme is about prejudice in the Good Society, and using an animal fairly tale is part of a venerable tradition going back to Narnia, and before that, George Orwell. C. S Lewis observed, Paradoxically, when Orwell turns all his characters into animals he makes them more fully human. The same can be said about Zootopia, and this is what makes  both Zootopia and Animal Farm so effective in their respective homilies.

I was left with a concern: all the predators in the movie are male. Is there is a subtext here?",1478822400,,1816,6.046692607003891

7618175,1,B01B2CX0LU,"My first response after I saw this movie was that it was well written, and had a solid plot. Then my kids and I began talking about it, and the more we thought about it, the more disturbing it became. Intended to be a feel-good movie about overcoming prejudice, it uncritically reflects much broader and deeper problems in our society. The minority in Zootopia have overcome their predatory nature to live in harmony in society. Until a secret government plot tries to unravel their progress by infecting them with drugs to make them behave savagely, so that the innocent majority turn against them in fear. But a talented female rookie cop (who must fight against chauvinism to earn her place on the force) uncovers the conspiracy through investigative tools such as secretly recording conversations to be used for blackmail, collaborating with organized criminals, and using torture to obtain information from suspects. These would be dark enough topics to portray in a children's movie, but what is disturbing is that Zootopia does not seem to understand morality. First of all, the minority population in the movie *is* predatory by nature. Secondly, the hero's tactics are profoundly unethical. Third, government officials are (almost) all abusing their power. These underlying messages should not be portrayed as inspirational.",1478476800,5,1333,5.233644859813084

I don't hate Shakira or anything, but he character was really annoying and it seemed like Zootopia kind of just threw her in and tried to make it work.",1478217600,6,265,4.215686274509804

7618211,5,B01B2CX0LU,This is an adorable but smart comedy. It's bright and beautifully animated. The story is easy enough for the kiddies to get into but nuanced enough to keep adults entertained (I was not expecting this much social commentary from a Disney movie about about a feisty bunny cop). I would definitely recommend it.,1478131200,,309,4.849056603773585

7618218,5,B01B2CX0LU,"I didn't go see Zootopia until it was in one of the smaller theatres. I actually wasn't that interested - figured it was something I was going to see on video. Was I ever missing the boat! This movie had everything but the stars bursting into song (which it made up for with an incredibly memorable song at the end): great plot, jokes for the adults, incredibly hard-to-spot Disney hidden memes, an incredibly creative concept, and excellent animation. It was on Delta's video list to Europe and I liked the movie so much I watched it twice (to Dinosaur's once - the latter being a great idea with sadly, high nap-supporting execution; I think I got my only flight sleep while ""watching"" the latter) and ended up humming Gazelle's song all through Germany. The characterization was mature, unpredictable, and engaging.

I have to admit (I'm sure this is Disney heresy) that I forgot what was significant about Frozen right after I walked out of the theatre - and I do love princesses. Zootopia was an immediate, gotta buy, Dumbo quality. Loved it.",1478131200,,1047,4.752747252747253

7618223,5,B01B2CX0LU,"Particularly wanted to see this after seeing the ""making of"" video. Well animated, enough sight gags and tossoffs in the background to warrant more than one viewing, and the story hangs together on several levels.",1478044800,,213,5.114285714285714

7618328,5,B01B2CX0LU,"Zootopia is an excellent movie for adults and older kids. Its one the best-animated 3D movies I have seen. If you love animation you're in for a treat. If you love a good mystery you're in for a treat. Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde solve a case thats more interesting than some live action movie cases. It had twists, turns, and lessons to learn. Zootopia was anything but one note. It was fun, sad, and dramatic. A new and exciting animal world was created and I want to learn more and see more from it. This is a movie that you can watch over and over and not be disappointed, which will make some parents very happy.  This is a 10/10 movie no wonder it is part of the billion dollar movie club.",1477180800,,693,4.2105263157894735

As we were watching it I disliked how graphic the bunnys face was when she was hit. It was rather long and a useless plot and story.

I freaking LOVE me some Disney, anything Disney and I am happy.  And yes I am a 33 year old adult.  While sitting on the redeye looking through the movie choices I found this so of course I had to watch it.  I cant sleep on any flight no matter how tired I am.

This movie is so well done!  It is hilarious throughout, with tons of adult humor and funny puns.  I was laughing so hard that I woke people up and kept startling my sleeping hubby.

I think this has good appeal for all ages. The message is very positive and uplifting--yes, it is also very PC, but not in an offensive way (pardon the irony).

Excellent use of ""suspense of disbelief"" to disarm defensiveness of the audience to convey messages. Nice balance of hope and toughness in zootopia as opposed to the setting being completely downtrodden or always rosy setting. Nicely paced storyline that is fun without being scary. Strong protagonist that is female and comparatively weak physically using cleverness, tenacity, and adaptability to solve the problems at hand. Next generation Aesopes fable.",1476921600,,604,5.711111111111111

7618386,2,B01B2CX0LU,"I was surprised at the lack of warnings about this film. Having a clearly deranged animal charge directly at you multiple times is the stuff of nightmares. And it is done so fast that there isn't any warning for a child (or adult who doesn't appreciate terrifying scenes) to turn their face away. There is a lot of bullying, not much retribution -- lots of forgiveness, and it ends well. I chose to continue watching it with children ages 3 - 10 because I felt we needed resolution seeing as how the terror didn't begin until well into the movie and we all would have spent the night wondering what caused these animals to change so drastically. But we spent the night huddled in one bed. I think I'd rate this one PG-13 simply because of the manner in which this movie presents the terror. If they would have toned down that part a bit, which of course a Walt Disney feature would NOT do, it would have been completely acceptable.",1476835200,,931,4.450292397660819

This is a movie that makes me feel like I can't wait to be a father and show this to my kids. No I'm not a furry, but I love these characters (kinda have a thing for Disney foxes for some reason I just noticed, fav animal and they're in my fav Disney movies excluding Lion King of course, oh and side tangent for anyone who has seen or is about to watch this, when Nick gives his fake thanks to Judy after she buys him the jumbo pop I swear his facial expression Bateman's tone in his voice is pulling a page from Robin Hood, and I wouldn't doubt it as in their behind the scenes they talk about how the directors and artists drew inspiration from that Disney classic), their voice actors and how the movie develops them along with the world around them. Bottomline, no matter why or how you loved it (the only thing I didn't like is the fact that there isn't a Zootopia 2 out now), it's an amzing movie, one of the greats and will-be classic.",1476403200,,1184,4.1521739130434785

7618482,5,B01B2CX0LU,"Zootopia is another film in a sub-genre of Disney films (the non-musical ones). In a world of anthropomorphic animals, predators and prey live in relative harmony. There are the usual unsavory criminals and corrupt politicians, and this is obviously a parallel to the real world.

Judy Hopps, the first rabbit police officer (who graduated at the top of her class) is understandably mopey and insulted after being placed on parking duty. Fortunately, she doesn't let arrogance get the better of her and leaps into her role with considerable gumption. Soon, she's caught up in a string of missing-predator cases, and must work together with con artist Nick Wilde to uncover a multi-layered plot.

It's everything a great Disney movie should be: heartwarming, funny and inspirational (especially for children who may feel discouraged about their talents and options for life). JK Simmons, famous for his role as Peter Parker's heavy-handed boss in Spider-man also stars as Mayor Lionheart.",1475971200,10,987,5.280254777070064

I went into the movie with the expectation that I would be taking a nap - after watching a Secret Life of Pets with my kids, I really didn't have any expectations of this movie at all.  Disney did a great job at making a movie of Pixar proportions.  The visuals were stunning, the characters were relatable and likeable, and the story was clever and well paced.  The jokes were funny and not limited to slapstick, and for those with an observant eye, there were plenty of Easter Eggs to be seen and to be spotted later.  The adults particularly like the Breaking Bad Woolter and Jesse references, as well as the bootleg DVDs sold by Weaselton.  For the kids, we spent time after watching the DVD to look up the harder to spot references such as the elephants dressed up like Elsa and Anna, the many hidden Mickeys, and so forth.  Overall, this was a fun movie for the kids and adults alike.  For people with really young kids, be warned, there are a few intense scenes.",1475712000,11,1087,4.42713567839196

Yeah, I know she wouldn't like anyone except another bunny and maybe Nick calling her cute, but hey, it's true!  Nick is that fun/sly/clever guy that makes you go ""I want to be like him!"" (the cop version, not the homeless pawpsicle hustler LOL).  The story is a fun one, kindof a rough subject if you dig down into it (prejudice) but they do a great job at the realities of comparing this to real life.

Furthermore, since you cannot launch the movie without the special features, you are forced to load the entire file. This becomes even more problematic if you want to download the file for offline viewing to a tablet or phone; you end up sacrificing a bunch of space and bandwidth for something you will rarely want and when you do want the special features, there is no way to navigate to exactly the part you want, nor a way to remind yourself where it is.",1475539200,,628,4.517543859649122

JUDY HOPPS IS A LOOSE CANNON.

Not only does she blackmail Nick regarding tax evasion (a white collar crime), but she drags him into a dangerous investigation regarding biological weapons, kidnapping, narcotics, etc.

AND THEN WHEN SHE FIGURES IT OUT... what does this prodigy, this valedictorian of the academy do? ACTS AS A VIGILANTE, PRIVATE CITIZEN. Endanger the public, destroy property and evidence.

7618697,3,B01B2CX0LU,"Cute, and well-acted, although the film goes a little heavy with it's message. the best films are the ones that can share a message without being too heavy-handed about it, and the themes of diversity get stretched a little too far here to feel a little bit too weighty for the goofy subject matter of intelligent talking animals. So this probably isn't a big deal for kids, who will love the talking animals, but for anyone who spends time reading into cinematic messages this one ranges from blatant to oblique (for instance, what exactly was the message being related in the darts that turned animals feral again?)  And the message of, ""You can be whatever you want to be"", well, yeah, motivation is one thing, but there's also a place for understanding one's limitations: I've got bad vision and will never be a jet fighter pilot, and I'm clumsy and forgetful and won't be doing open-heart surgery anytime soon, so sometimes the ""you can do anything you set your mind to"" message grows a little trite and tiring. Or maybe I'm just growing a little too old and cynical for the Disney message in these films.

It's otherwise a cute film, with a couple creepy moments involving the feral animals (and a jump scare kids should be warned about in the animal hospital.) The sloth sequence - I don't know, but this seemed to have an obliquely directed feeling of targeting the mentally disabled. I might be reading into it too much but I found those sequences strangely uncomfortable more than funny. Maybe it's just me.

The film is well-animated, I'll give it that, and the Zootopia districts are bright, colorful and beautifully rendered. Just don't read too much into the message as it can be a tad heavy-handed.",1474588800,,1713,4.722408026755853

7618759,5,B01B2CX0LU,"In a world populated by anthropomorphic mammals, Judy Hopps, a rabbit from rural Bunnyburrow, fulfills her dream of becoming the first rabbit officer in the police department of nearby city Zootopia.
However, upon arrival, she is assigned parking duty by Chief Bogo, an African buffalo, who doubts her potential due to her being a rabbit and thus smaller than most of the large animals on the force. During one of her shifts, she meets Nick Wilde, a con artist fox.
Hopps abandons her shift to arrest a thief, Duke Weaselton. She is reprimanded by Bogo and nearly fired until Mrs. Otterton, an otter, arrives pleading for help locating her missing husband - one of many animals recently missing in Zootopia. To Bogo's dismay, Hopps volunteers and agrees to resign if she cannot solve the case within 48 hours. She sees Wilde in the last known photo of Otterton and tracks him down, coercing him into to assisting her with the investigation.
After acquiring Mr. Otterton's license plate number, Hopps and Wilde track the vehicle to Mr. Big, an Arctic shrew crime boss. Mr. Big informs the pair that Otterton, his florist, had gone savage and attacked his chauffeur Manchas, a black jaguar. Hopps and Wilde locate Manchas, who mentions ""night howlers"" were responsible for attacking him before he goes savage and chases the pair out of his home. When Bogo and his reinforcements arrive, Manchas disappears. Bogo demands Hopps resign, but Wilde takes a stand, insisting they have 10 more hours to solve the case. As the pair leaves, Hopps learns from Wilde that he was bullied by prey animals as a pup and became a criminal, believing he would be stereotyped as one no matter what due to being a fox.
Wilde realizes that the city's traffic camera system may have captured Manchas's disappearance, and the pair consult Assistant Mayor Bellwether, a sheep. They identify the captors as wolves, hence ""night howlers"". Hopps and Wilde locate the missing mammals (including Mr. Otterton) at Hillside Asylum. All are predators, and all have gone savage like Manchas. The two discover Mayor Lionheart consulting with a doctor about the predators' condition. The pair escape with the evidence and the police swarm the area, arresting Lionheart.
Having developed a friendship with Wilde throughout the case, Hopps requests that he joins the Zootopia Police Department and become her partner, which Wilde happily considers. However, during a press conference, Hopps mentions that the savage animals are predators and argues they have gone back to their ""natural state."" Wilde is hurt and angrily walks out on her offer. Fear and discrimination against predators spreads across Zootopia, and a guilt-ridden Hopps resigns. During this time, pop singer Gazelle holds a peaceful protest and publicly asks for the harmonious Zootopia she loves to be restored.
Back in Bunnyburrow, Hopps learns that ""night howlers"" are flowers that have a severe psychotropic effects on mammals. Hopps returns to Zootopia and reconciles with Wilde. They locate Weaselton and learn that he has been collecting night howlers for a secret laboratory. The pair discover the lab and find ram scientists creating a night howler serum, which has been injected into predators via dart guns. Hopps and Wilde race to the ZPD with the evidence, but the rams pursue them.
Just short of the ZPD, the pair encounters Bellwether, who tries to take the evidence. Realizing Bellwether is the mastermind of a species-supremacist conspiracy, Hopps and Wilde try to flee, but Bellwether shoots a dart at Wilde and calls the ZPD for help. Wilde becomes savage and corners Hopps, but it turns out the pair were acting and had swapped out Bellwether's darts for blueberries. With Bellwether's confession recorded on Hopps's carrot pen, the two have enough evidence to unravel the conspiracy.
Some months later, Hopps is reinstated into the ZPD. The savaged mammals are cured. Lionheart is cleared of all charges and is reinstated as mayor. Wilde joins the ZPD as the first fox officer and Judy's new partner. In the final scene, all of Zootopia enjoys a performance by Gazelle, who dances with four tigers.",1474243200,,4148,5.065789473684211

My son and I, on the other hand, were laughing so hard at all the jokes that were over the kids' heads, but we got. Not one of the jokes was off-colored or smutty, just clean, very funny jokes.

7618831,5,B01B2CX0LU,"Deserving of the praise and hype surrounding it, Zootopia delivers a premise that has complex social and moral issues compounded in, almost discreetly so. The first time you watch it you will likely miss many of the underlying tones implied by the animists, writers, and various artists whom worked on the project. Beyond the complex themes is an intriguing story of a bunny that wanted to be different from the norm, whose wish was to become a Police Officer, and live in the city of Zootopia, one whose mantra sported 'Where anyone can be anything', a thought that comes into conflict multiple times throughout the movie as various groups generalize and persecute others based on their appearance or ethnicity. However, it also goes to show that sometimes generalizations are so simply because that is the most common, or at least most noticeable, attribute of their heritage. A great example is the foxes shown throughout the film, both sides are seen. You will see good foxes, and bad foxes. However, the ones that tend to stick into the mind the deepest and most vivid are those where the evil, or at least morally lacking fox does something against, and therefore breaking the law. I won't go into further depth to avoid spoiling the details, but both adults and children will enjoy watching this film. There is even a reference to Breaking Bad included in the film.",1474070400,,1372,4.842553191489362

7618866,4,B01B2CX0LU,"Great movie, and I like that I do not need to find the disc. Marred by only two things.
1) Bonus material is part of main movie track, not on separate track/episodes. Not a deal breaker, but irritating as I will only want to watch it once or twice, and I would rather be able to choose which bonus feature I am watching from a menu rather than having to scroll through and try to find the start of the bit I want to watch.
2) Amazon blocks movies from being played over a ChromeCast. Even when you bring the movie up on a PC or ChromeBook (and you can watch it in browser on my ChromeBook) Amazon has software that recognizes you are using a ChromeCast and prevents you from playing the movie. Rather monopolistic, but I'm the one who made the mistake of buying digital movies on Amazon, and this is an issue with Amazon as a service more than an issue with this product. Therefore I didn't deduct any stars for it.",1473897600,,915,4.234285714285714

7618873,5,B01B2CX0LU,"I originally saw this money in theaters about 2-3 times, even bribing a friend to go once by buying their ticket. When Amazon had it one their Amazon videos for rent or buy, I went for it!

The movie itself is a great movie for both kids and adults. Though it does have a few scary scenes that could frighten smaller kids. The plot, especially towards the end, can get a little predictable. In terms how they defeat the villain of this movie- like all or most Disney movies there is a villain. Other than that I loved with what they did with it.

The makers of the movie really took the time to make the world of Zootopia a living and breathing world of its own. They show how all these different types of animals are able to live in this huge and diverse city. The main two characters (which are on the cover) Judy, the rabbit, and Nick, the fox, worked fanatic with each other. All the side characters were great as well along with all the 'Dsiney' jokes. Especially one particular Frozen joke I keep laughing at.

7618883,4,B01B2CX0LU,"Zootopia is an animal populated world where its citizenry is segregated into their own communities.  A world where bigger animals pick on smaller animals.  Bullies abound and are wildly accepted as behaving according to species.  As one character puts it, deep down were still animals.  Into this melee a plot appears.  Someone is causing animals to revert to savagery.  Prejudice emerges because fear always works.

Its not a subtle film by any means.  The message is heavy-handed and hammered home in an obvious manner.  The villain is expected.  The results are expected.  But.  There are a few clever ideas (the DMV sloths).  The score is great.  Some of the characters are cloyingly cute.  But.  With that many writers involved youd expect a lot more creativity and a lot less lecturing.  We get it.  You don't need to be that didactic.

Still, it is...............cute.",1473724800,,875,4.993006993006993

The world of Zootopia was fully developed and there was a lot of attention paid to the small details. My kids love this movie and have watched it over and over again.

She had determination and drive and became the first bunny police officer. The co-main character was a fox. Foxes were seen as the type of animals that you always had to watch out for.

7619020,3,B01B2CX0LU,"Great animation and models, but the story drops off at some points, and there is a clear overt pandering towards the furry fandom. This movie uses bedroom eyes and sexual innuendo more than family guy with cut away gags. The best thing to say is that everything looks nice in the film. The story is something you have all seen if you have watched buddy cop flicks, but now with animals. There is a plot hole where Judy should have known what Nigh Howlers were, as her dad outright says he had always told the story to the kids about his brother in law being affected by them. Really if it weren't for there being animals as the characters the whole film is generic and clearly just some pander piece to make some cash. It isn't bad, but it doesn't have any of the story telling power of films like Up or the Incredibles.",1473465600,,820,4.3311688311688314

I feel that it teaches good lessens without being too in your face like say, Fern Gully.

People watch movies to escape what's going on around them and that's kind of impossible with this movie. Kids shouldn't learn about racism at an early age or they might learn there is something to discriminate against people, which there isn't.

7619089,1,B01B2CX0LU,"My 6 year old was terrified by the violence, dark theme, and tense and suspenseful moments interspersed with frightening surprises.  This also contains a lot of inappropriate language and behavior included for shock value.  The attempt at a positive message was lost in the darkness.  I don't know why Disney keeps marketing movies to children and including adult levels of content, themes, and violence.  There were many references to adult things, intended to go over children's heads and keep adults entertained, that simply confuse and frighten children.  The previews never hinted at the dark and frightening content.

Disney needs to choose a target audience for each movie and build appropriate content for that audience, rather than trying to tailor kids movies to entertain adults who accompany kids to movies, terrifying and confusing kids in the process.  If you want to make a good family movie, write a good story that appeals to all, without relying on inserting so much suspense,  ""wink wink, nudge nudge"" content, and adult themes.

It's my new favorite Disney movie, tied only with Treasure Planet. I love it because it's real, relatable, and touches on quite a few deep messages that not a lot of kid's media gets into, but should. This movie teaches kids (and I'm sure some adults too) not to judge others prematurely and the effects of bullying, as well as other things. And the characters are so cute and lovable.

7619309,5,B01B2CX0LU,"8.5/10 one of my favorite movies. The world design is just absolutely stunning. I had to watch it three times before I paid full attention to the plot because I was just mesmerized by the detail put into everything, the wondrous composition of the shots, the movement, and character design.

Great plot, but third act was very weak. a lot of build up of a plot about grey morality for a black-and-white villain that completely destroys the mood. First act had a lot of repeated exposition, but was otherwise great. Second act was a damn masterpiece. However, the fact that they were using metaphors for racism seemed cheap as it's a kid's movie. Metaphors will go over kid's heads, and it was more of something for critics to look at, but considering the large adult audience of this movie, it may have not been entirely for the critics.

Use of sound effects were good, but they got a little too level. whispers are the same volume of yells.

Disney made a very strong comeback after multiple weak movies with this.",1472515200,,1016,4.633333333333334

7619360,4,B01B2CX0LU,"Funny, creative, and not too computery.  I really enjoyed this movie.  However, it did get a lil' preachy.  And it's going to be on  Netflix next month, so you may want to wait on this one.  Here's ebert's review; I can't do any better than him.

Fantasy films aimed at kids don't have to have political messages, but when they do, they should either be internally consistent, or work through the contradictions in terms that kids can apply to the real world. Zootopia, a fantasy set in a city where predators and prey live together in harmony, is a funny, beautifully designed kids film with a message that it restates at every turn. But if you think about that message for longer than five minutes, it doesnt merely fall apart, it invites a reading that is almost surely contrary to the movies seemingly enlightened spirit: discrimination is wrong, but stereotypes are stereotypes for a reason, and its not easy for members of a despised class to overcome the reasons why the majority despises them, so you gotta be patient.

Ginnifer Goodwin (Big Love) voices Bunny Hops, a small town rabbit whos told that she cant be a police officer in Zootopia because theres never been a rabbit police officer. (The job tends to be done by predators and large herbivoreslike a water buffalo thats become a police captain, voiced by Idris Elba.) Hops makes it through police training anyway and gets assigned to meter maid duty, to the relief of her carrot farmer parents (Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake), who gave her fox repellent as a going-away present. They had good reason to give her fox repellent: the fox is one of the rabbits mortal enemies, and when Judy was child, a fox cornered her at a county fair, insulted her for being a bunny, and slashed her face with his paw. (This is a slightly more intense kid-flick than you might expect, given how many adorable animals are in it.)
Of course Hops ends up partnered with a red fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a small-time hustler who reluctantly helps her investigate the disappearances of a dozen predators. I won't reveal exactly what the mystery is here (its a pretty good one) except to say that it invites kids and parents to talk about nature versus nurture, and the origins and debilitating effect of stereotypes.
But this turns out to be not such a great thing once you get deeper into the movie. Because people are not animals, I dread thinking about the logical conclusions to which such conversations will lead. The film isn't wrong to say that carnivores are biologically inclined to want to eat herbivores, that bunnies reproduce prolifically, the sloths are slow-moving (they work at the DMV here), that you can take the fox out of the forest but you cant take forest out of the fox, and so on. If you think about all this as an analogy for the world we live in (particularly if we live in a melting-pot big city like Zootopia) and and then ask yourself which racial or ethnic or societal groups (cops, businesspeople, city bureaucrats) are predators and which are prey (for purposes of metaphor translation), you see the problem. ""Zootopia"" pretty much rubber-stamps whatever worldview parents want to pass on to their kids, however embracing or malignant that may be. I can imagine an anti-racist and a racist coming out of this film, each thinking it validated their sense of how the world works.
Zootopia is constantly asking its characters to look past species stereotypes, and not use species-ist language or repeat hurtful assumptions. Only a bunny can call another bunny cute, Hops warns a colleague Its filled with moments that are about overcoming or enduring discrimination. Never let them see that they get to you, Wilde advises Hops. And there are acknowledgments of the destructive self-hatred that discrimination can cause. Many of the animals make self-deprecating jokes at the expense of stereotypes about their species (such as Hops volunteering to do math for Wilde, telling him, ""If there's one thing we bunnies are good at, it's multiplying""), and there's a fairly intense flashback which reveals that Wilde became a hustler because other animals hazed him as a pup while repeating anti-fox stereotypes, and responded by embracing his species' caricature and becoming the foxiest fox anyone had seen. This all seems clever and noble until you realize that all the stereotypes about various animals are to some extent true, in particular the most basic one: carnivores eat herbivores because it's in their nature. (Yes, readers, I know, there are tigers who've been taught to snuggle with lambs, and I've seen the same memes with cats and dogs snuggling that you have; I mean in general.)
It might seem weird that Im dwelling on this aspect of Zootopia, which is directed by Byron Howard & Rich Moore and co-directed by Jared Bush, because the movie is entertaining. The thriller plot, which borrows rather generously from 48 HRS and every cop drama involving governmental conspiracy, is smartly shaped  Its hard to imagine any child or adult failing to be amused and excited by parts of it. The compositions and lighting are more thoughtful than you tend to get in a 3-D animated film starring big-eyed animals who speak with the voices of celebrities. And there are a few sections that are transportingly lovely, in particular any sequence involving the pop star Gazelle (voiced by Shakira), and Hops' high-speed train ride towards and through Zootopia, which introduces the city's different terrains (including frozen tundra and misty rainforest) while leaving room for subsequent bits of spelunking (a foot chase through rodent town lets Hops know what it feels like to be a giant). Some of the biggest laughs come from obvious gags that you know the writers couldn't resist, such as the bit where Idris' water buffalo captain says they can't start the morning briefing without acknowledging the elephant in the room. If you decide not to think about the metaphor that the film is built around, it's an enjoyable diversion, made with great skill.
Still: is it too much to ask that a film that wears its noble intentions like a jangling neck collar be able to withstand scrutiny? If ""Zootopia"" were a bit vaguer, or perhaps dumber and less pleased with itself, it might have been a classic, albeit of a very different, less reputable sort. As-is, it's a goodhearted, handsomely executed film that doesn't add up in the way it wants to.",1472342400,,6431,4.860401459854015

But, also, the not-so-hidden themes of acceptance in a multicultural society as well as the threat of xenophobia to the harmony in that society (symbolized as predator-phobia here) were well drawn but not too heavy-handed. It is, obviously, a social commentary on how polarized our own society has become lately.  A good movie to take kids to to talk about afterwards.

It is funny, full of irony and ""in"" jokes and has a plot that makes the watcher think.

7619509,4,B01B2CX0LU,"A beautiful film that tells a pretty good story about how racism, bigotry and prejudice, all wrapped up in a kid friendly package. It touches on social issues that exist in our world today and lays a buddy-cop, police procedural story on top of it. Like it honestly feels like one of Pixar's earlier films where they built movie worlds that felt like functioning, real worlds and not just, you know, needless sequels made to make money.

But at the same time, it's almost /too/ political.

All in all, a really great film and I recommend buying it, just be prepared to be smacked over the head about race issues. It's a beautiful film, easily Disney's best to date in terms of animation quality, but you may get a little tired of the Shakira character being shoehorned into your face for poorly done comedic relief scenes (and a absolutely terrible theme song).",1471651200,,861,4.657894736842105

It's definitely the kind of movie that I feel like I could easily watch multiple times and enjoy doing so every time. I wouldn't recommend letting little kids watch it without an adult present because there are some shocking/frightening scenes in the middle portion of the movie.

7619584,1,B01B2CX0LU,I'm not sure what the deal is with Disney these days but every DVD disk I have purchased from them in the past year simply won't play on my 6 month old DVD player ... nor will they play 'properly' on any of my computers... On the computers some will play but only intermittently... or seem to have file cache issues that won't smooth out... or audio/video sync issues or some other something or other... My neighbor next door has a DVD player of a different manufacture... won't play on that DVD player either... It's as if they are trying to discourage the purchase of their products in the DVD format... Imagine that... your selling a product to discourage people from buying your products... Wow!  What is that... Anti-Sales you guys are doing over there? You Disney guys get stupider every time I read something about you... poor Walt is rolling over in his grave... I bet his undertakers are wondering why his grave is freshly plowed up every morning by 6am... LOL!,1471392000,,970,4.606936416184971

7619617,5,B01B2CX0LU,"Zootopia is probably my favorite Disney film (Sorry Beauty and the Beast). I love the story and the way it can cater to both kids and adults with hilarious antics and a witty critique on the way our world still views racism today. I love the way this film unapologetically makes me question the way I view the world. Nick Wilde and Judy Hops have such an amazing back and forth rapport and the animation is amazing. For each Disney movie there is always an animation that I fall in love with and re-watch over and over. In Beauty and the Beast it was something big like the transformation scene. In Frozen it was something small like the way Anna's skirt moved as she sang ""For the First Time in Forever."" Zootopia's amazing animation was actually something so small that I think it would go unnoticed: I loved the way Nick's nose would crinkle up when ever he got angry. I have never seen a Fox get angry, but I've seen a scary dog a time or two and that animation was spot on and lovely.
I would definitely say this movie is worth the watch. The whole family can enjoy it, and the lessons learned can last a lifetime.",1471305600,,1119,4.333333333333333

it was a glorified old story line. Seen it a million times... it just uses a different twist. Animals rule! not! It's not really that interesting if you ask me.
It takes advantage of everyone's appreciation of animated animal flicks. It's just not a good sell for me. I think the money could be better spent. And this movie definitely isn't worth the $5 to $6 tag....",1471219200,,594,4.085470085470085

7619681,5,B01B2CX0LU,"My 3 year old son absolutely LOVES this movie! This was the first film he sat through without losing his interest. We even had to go to see it in theatre twice... that's how much he liked it! We bought it for him before we gave birth to his little brother so that he could watch his favorite movie and his grandma and grandpa's house. Now he watches it all the time.
This movie is very family friendly... there really isn't anything inappropriate in it in terms of language. The only things that some parents might have an issue with are the few scenes of cartoon violence... there's one scene where the main character hits another one in the face... this actually happens a couple times in the movie, once during a scene where the characters are young and a bully attacks her, and another where the main character is training in a police academy and she is practicing in a boxing ring. There is also a scene at the beginning where the main character is in a play and has fake ""blood"" coming out of her in the form of ribbons and squeezing a ketchup bottle. There isn't any suggestive language at all.. you hear ""shut up"" once or twice. The last thing I'd say is Zootopia's celebrity performer ""Gazelle"" has an outfit that is similar to something that the person who does her voice would wear (Gazelle is voiced by Shakira... google her if you don't know who she is.. or just google zootopia gazelle, you'll see what I mean).
Like I said, it's a cute movie, funny at many times. Not many kids movies make me laugh out loud, but this one does. I really enjoy it, even after seeing it 100000000 times in the past two months.",1470960000,7,1622,4.392026578073089

7619693,5,B01B2CX0LU,"I get asked on occasion why do I keep watching animated films built for kids when mine are well past the target age.  Well, its for films like this.  Not only is it beautiful to watch, but it is witty, clever and has an excellent message or two for the little onesand adults.

In a small rural town, Judy Hopps (Jennifer Goodwin) is a young bunny who yearns to be a police officer when she grows up.  Encouraged to remain close to her parents (Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake) and become carrot farmers like them, Judy is determined to become a cop.  Years later she gets her chance and if she passes the tests would become the first rabbit to join the police force.  Shes shuttled to the metropolis of Zootopia and graduates at the top of her class.

Most of the cops are large animals, certainly none as small as a rabbit.  Zootopia is a diverse community where predators and prey have learned to live together.  The police chief (Idris Elba) assigns Judy to meter maid duties much to her disappointment.  When Judy sees a wily fox named Nick (Jason Bateman) pulling off a scam, she confronts him and with some help arrests him.  He is soon released and Chief Bogo is not happy, asking for her badge for disobeying orders.  He gives her a second chance if she can find a missing otter.  She recruits Nick, because of his resources which might come in handy.

The unlikely pair become friends and provide some interesting and even legitimate detective work.  It turns out they not only find the otter, but 14 other predators who have also gone missing over the past few weeks.  It turns out, someone is experimenting with a drug than returns predators to their evolutionary killer instinct.  (Note: some of these violent scenes might scare the real little ones, thus the PG rating).  So who is behind all of this and why?  Is it the Chief or Mayor Lionheart (J. K. Simmons) or someone else?  Leave it to Judy and Nick to find out.  This is another great Disney film, joining other stalwarts like Frozen and Big Hero 6 of late.  It is a terrific film for the whole familyor even a single, old guy like me.  Highly recommended.

The Blu ray transfer is gorgeous to look at.  It has a 2.39:1 aspect ratio and comes in 1080p video resolution.  As with many modern animated films, the movie is flush with color, striking every hue on the palette.  Excellent detail permeates the film.  You can see the lettering on the badges, fine hair on tails and faces with great clarity.  Excellent black levels are evident in the night time settings.  A top notch demo-worthy presentation.  The audio is also near perfection.  It includes a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track which delivers excellent surround in nearly every scene.  Many of the heavy animals like elephants and rhinos deliver thunderous footfalls that will even activate your LFE channel.  The dialog is clear and easy to place.  Subtitles are available in French, Spanish and English SDH.  Here are the extras:
*Candid conversations with filmmakers and artists behind Zootopia
*Alternate opening
*Never-before-seen characters and deleted scenes
*A sneak peek at some of the hidden Easter Eggs that make reference to Disney Animation's most beloved films and characters.",1470873600,2,3220,4.707885304659499

7619696,3,B01B2CX0LU,"The good:  The film starts out being quite clever and funny.  I kept thinking, ""Wow. I'm impressed!  I wasn't expecting this movie to be this good!  I'm actually laughing!""

The bad:  About half way through the film, though, there was a distinct change in my feelings about the movie.  Suddenly, I'm thinking, ""Why is the pace of this movie so darn hyper?""  and ""Why do they need to stick CELL PHONES into the plot so much?  Is that really necessary?  I watch movies to get AWAY from cell phones and computer screens, yet every animal in this darn movie seems ADDICTED to a cell phone!""  I get it...they're trying to appeal to ""tweens"".....funny...they used to be able to do that WITHOUT sticking cell phones and social media and pop culture into EVERYTHING.  It just seems so...cheap and commercial.  Actually, my teen-aged daughter agreed. (Imagine that)!  And like I said...TOO HYPER!  The beginning was clever and cute...what is WRONG with clever and cute?  Why can't it stay that way?  Oh well.  I won't say the movie was awful or anything (hence the 3 stars)...and if you have a young child, I'm sure he or she will be entertained.  My husband liked it...my daughter and I didn't so much.  If you find it cheap, though, give it a whirl....just remember, you've been warned about the cell phones!",1470873600,,1301,4.697777777777778

It has plenty of tidbits along side the main story to entertain the adults of the family.  BIts that will go over the heads of kids.  Best of all, is the moral of the tale.

7619714,4,B01B2CX0LU,"Another soon to be Disney classic to add to the list. I purchased this on a whim to watch with my younger siblings that adored past Disney staples like Toy Story, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo. I was not disappointing with this animated feature. It has plenty of family friendly comedy and adventure. As a young adult this actually had me on the edge of my seat as the movie has an underlying adult themes. The segregation of carnivores and herbivores was a major conflict in this movie and definitely worth the whimsical exploration that this movie offered. I like when children movies and shows offer life lessons to their young audience. It is a great way to show children that you shouldn't treat other people differently based on the fact they are not like you. You just have to take the time to get to know them better.",1470787200,,827,4.557046979865772

My husband and I, along with our kid love this movie. They did a wonderful job of putting enough in it to keep adults entertained without making it inappropriate for children. One of my favorite scenes was the DMV. The kids think it is just funny but adults will understand the meaning and how true it is. Also, the night howlers producer Doug was great, and his two sidekicks. I won't give it away for anyone that hasn't seen it. If you haven't you need to.

Now my kids can recite every single line in the move at 3 and 5 years old - so can I.  I have watched it literally 12 times in a car ride to south Carolina and back.  My 5 year old loves Gideon Gray when he was a little fox and constantly say ""cry little baby bunny cry"" in a twang voice 75 times  a day. My 3 year old screams ""insubordination"" all day long.

7619957,5,B01B2CX0LU,"This show was so adorable. Very entertaining for the whole family! Disney at it's best!!!!!

It's about a spunky country bunny who feels she has to prove herself and becomes a cop in the big city. She was bullied as a kid and that inspired her goal... and through hard work she reached her goal only to be bullied again by the ones she worked with. She teams up with a sly fox who she was prejudice about (she was bullied as a kid by a fox) only to become best friends with him, but only after outsmarting him after he outsmarted her. There are many side characters that just make this movie so funny and entertaining.

I loved the celebrity voices they did a wonderful job. And the singers and soundtrack are amazing. The plot keeps your interest and makes for a very lovable movie. And the animation as always is top notch. There are not many kids movies that I really enjoy anymore. Many of them are cheesy to keep the kids interest but lose mine...But Zootopia is one of my favorite films of the year, if you haven't seen it, give it a chance it's not your typical kids film which is what I like, I just wish more of them were like this. My kids loved it and so did I!",1470614400,,1172,4.204444444444444

I really loved the movie. The CG was vivid, story was fun, and the topic was super-educational for all.

We do live in Zootopia, but so blind, we never even realize how blind we all have become.

Our Founding Fathers must have wept if they had known the future voters wouldn't have enough leisure time for pondering about the ways to ""make our world better.""

Well, excuse us; we're living our busy lives, and no time for pondering like the Founding Fathers did. Thus, here this fun animation story is for us telling us the way in a very fun, non-stressful way :)",1470614400,,640,4.444444444444445

7620085,5,B01B2CX0LU,"LOVE THIS !!!!  One my of FAVORITE Movies !! and yeah, I'm an adult that loved cartoons.  The way that I review varies with each item.  Some have so many great things that it is easy to go on and on about all of the positive things.  Others only have enough to state that they are bad.  If a review is too long people stop reading it so what is the point.  My Stars also depend on how I I like/dislike the product on my own personal level. I may also list a product as 3 stars even though I didn't like it as it may be a good product in itself for someone else.  Just because it didn't work exactly the way I wanted it to doesn't mean that it is a bad product all around.  I hope that makes sense.  I also may list something as a 5 star only to come back after a a time to update how the product is and lower the stars.  Some products seem great at first and then the more you use it the less they work, break or just all around didn't perform to my satisfaction. If my review helped you make your decision I am glad to have helped.  You can click on the yes it was helpful button but in no way am I saying that you have to.  I don't do that often myself unless I feel they really helped. Make sure to ask questions if you have any to people who have make reviews !

While prey and predator live seemingly harmoniously in Zootopia, the little guy always keeps their eyes open...There was enough humor in it to make me laugh but not enough to hold my attention for a whole movie. My kids enjoyed it; even though for about a week after, my son  (3) kept saying he wanted to watch ""dumb bunny"" and I had no idea what he was talking about...Of all things in the movie he picked to name it, ""dumb bunny"", as quoted by Hops herself, was the phrase. They watched it a few times and still ask for it, but would prefer Inside Out, MegaMind, Incredibles, etc, instead. All in all a decent rental but nothing that knocked my socks off.",1469923200,,885,4.267857142857143

7620173,5,B01B2CX0LU,"This is hands-down one of the best animated features I've seen, recent or otherwise. I just love it. First of all, it has a great message for kids: dream big, don't be afraid to fail and don't let anyone tell you you can't do something. As a mom, I really loved it - especially the ""don't be afraid to fail"" part. Great animation, catchy little song, and - best of all - it's every bit as entertaining for parents as for the kids. Maybe even moreso!  I won't give it away, I'll just say it's very inventive and kept me chuckling all the way through. It's still the one I secretly hope our daughter will ask for on movie night, even though we've probably seen it ten times already:) Bateman and Goodwin are perfect, great characters that were beautifully voiced all around, every one of them.

I enjoyed how the story developed. It was a mystery! I was looking for clues!

I enjoyed the character development. . The flashbacks that gave me a better understanding why Judy and Nick were who they were.

I laughed.  I cringed.  I held my breath.  I shed a couple of tears. I smiled.

And, I was impressed how well it showed how prejudices affect us.  Not by preaching at me in strong terms, but with a subtle message that did not override the story.  Well done!",1469664000,,723,4.416666666666667

7620285,5,B01B2CX0LU,An intelligent movie with 'nods' to other classics eg. The Godfather and several other clever scenes which means that it appeals to both adults and children - though maybe not very young children as there are some scary bits. The serious issues such as discrimination / assumptions about other groups are handled in a non strident and thoughtful way  Highly recommended! I enjoyed it (I'm over 60) as did my 30 year old daughter.,1469664000,,429,4.797297297297297

My older kids were bored, and my younger kids were ... well... bored - but for different reasons. Older kids thought it was too ""weird"" and just not interesting, and the younger ones didn't get the humor (which was meant for older watchers) and so it held no appeal.

Bought it for our kids, ages 5 and 7, for family vacation trip.  Downloaded to tablets.
The response was 'ho-hum'.  It held their attention for the first viewing, but that was all.  Most of these types of films, e.g. Tangled, Monsters, Snow White, etc. they watch over-and-over-and-over agin.

Not this film.  Just did not have the 'magic' for our kids.  Kids are not even interested in the merchandising. (never happened to our kids before) Usually they want all the cooler cups/fuzzy animals/stickers/et al.
This is one for rental or wait for Netflix/Amazon.",1469404800,,678,5.155963302752293

There are a couple of Easter Egg nods to shows like Breaking Bad that are cool for adults to recognize. It gives a chuckle, even though the plot is a bit predictable.

7620539,5,B01B2CX0LU,"Many animated flicks are just too cheesy for me, but I liked this one. It's does a lot of gentle ribbing of political correctness, without being mean about it. There are lots of jokes that you won't notice the first time through, so make sure you watch it at least twice.

The package has both DVD and Blu-Ray, which is nice if you have kids and would like to have a copy which they might not treat well.

The scene with the sloths in the DMV is the funniest animated scene I've seen since the heyday of Bugs Bunny. It's inspired, and takes advantage of everyone's frustration with standing in line to be served by a slow-moving bureaucrat, while not being too heavy handed about it.

Watch carefully - lots of things you think are throw-away lines end up being important in the end. That's the mark of a well-crafted movie.",1469318400,,824,4.443708609271523

7620588,5,B01B2CX0LU,"A friend of mine who does not have children, saw this movie and loved it so much that she decided to order a copy and have it sent to me. I had no idea what to expect. The title made me worry it would have something to do with animals breaking out of a zoo or be something like the Madagascar movies (my kids love those, but me, not so much). It is nothing like that.

This movie has great characters and a good bit of humor for adults to appreciate while not making the kids uncomfortable. It has a lot of good lessons in it too. It's nice to watch as entertainment the whole way through and then have discussion with the kids afterwards. You can follow your dreams even if the odds are against you. Don't judge others based on their outside. Our differences should be celebrated. We are not defined by the past. Even the bully can grow up to be a good guy. It is a little heavy handed in delivering the message in some parts, but then it moves forward and all is enjoyable again.

The DMV, the nudists, and the result of the car chase at the end were the biggest LOL moments for me.

Also, I am not a huge fan of pop music, but the song at the end got my 4-year-old and 1.5-year-old dancing with all their heart and I thoroughly enjoyed watching them.

This ranks pretty high on my mental list of the best animated movies for the whole family. I'd definitely recommend it.",1469318400,,1374,4.193181818181818

7620717,3,B01B2CX0LU,"I purchased this to watch with my granddaughter.  However, my wife read the Amazon reviews and advised against it.  We decided to watch it first and she was correct.  There are innuendos and scenes some kids would find it difficult to watch.  It abounds in political correctness in that the hero, a very small, female bunny rabbit, is the star of the police force.  Of course PC demands she be smarter than all her male counterparts and this stereotype is constantly driven home to the point one can predict the ending.  However, the movie was still entertaining and the graphics as good as any.  The humor is often fun and the fox as a foil works predictably well.  After all, not every male can be an idiot.

This is an adult, or at least at the minimum, an early teen movie.  Despite the frequent PC messages, it is still fun to watch.",1469145600,4,838,4.453947368421052

A few parts that little viewers might find scary (spoiler ---- a bully scene, some scary domestic-gone-wild animal scenes) but an overall wonderful story about going for your dreams, fighting for what you believe in, not judging a book by it's cover (by the bunny being small, and the fox being trustworthy), friendship, loyalty, and family.

So much so, that my daughter wanted to rent it when it was available so that my husband and 14 year old daughter could watch it too.  My 14 year old reluctantly agreed to watch a cartoon movie with the family and I think she may have enjoyed it the most!! While this is marketed as a  ""kids"" movie, parents and older kids will find much to laugh about as Zootopia has many references and nods to current culture.  There is a story and plot line which is fun to follow for the older kids and adults, yet easy enough to follow for the younger ones.

7620743,5,B01B2CX0LU,"I will admit, when my friend first asked me to watch this movie with her in theaters, I was very doubtful that I would like it. I hasn't seen the previews for it yet and was thinking the whole time, I really don't want to see a movie with animals in a zoo (which is what I assumed was about). I know that disney has produced some great films, I just didn't think this would be one of them.

Let me tell you, within 10 minutes of watching this film, I was totally sold. First of all, the graphics are great and secondly the storyline was drastically different than what I thought it would be. I was instantly captured by the fact that people told Judy she couldn't follow her dreams and why was Nick such a schemer? The more and more I watched, I became attached to their friendship! I love how this is so relatable to real life and how it touched on the fact that just because society says you're suppose to be scared of someone or just because you're different, you cannot find common ground, that it is all a bunch of lies. I think it is such a refreshing message and great themes that work for kids and adults alike. I personally want Judy and Nick to end up together, but that's just me.

I think this is a solid disney movie that will keep you entertained and while you know it will have a good ending, sometimes it is nice to just have a movie that isn't trying to be so deep, you cannot enjoy yourself. Sometimes being a little more predictable and innocent is maybe what we all need every once in awhile from all the things that happen in our daily lives.

I would recommend this to adults and children alike. A great movie to stay in and watch!",1469059200,,1653,4.208201892744479

7620795,5,B01B2CX0LU,"This is a funny, well written movie with great character development, many clever twists and a positive message.

As far as I can determine, most of the movies' detractors violently disagree with the movie's overall premises that:
- People who aren't like each other need to get along, and
- Using hate and fear to create divisions between groups of people for personal power is wrong.

Since I personally agree with those premises, I thought the message was totally on-target.

MANY sight gags occur in the background while your attention is drawn to the foreground.  Watch it in HD or better if you can.  There are also many gags buried in the dialog. Idris Elba's role as the Police captain is hilarious.  Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are spot-on throughout.",1468972800,,767,4.861538461538461

7620839,5,B01B2CX0LU,"I can't really say much that has not already been said about Zootopia other than that I still have not grown tired of watching it even after the fifth time. The film perfectly balances out the comedy with its important elements and introduces a new and exciting universe filled with deep and interesting characters. This includes one of the best female and feminist characters in a major motion picture (who wasn't even going for feministshe's just a 21st-century woman)

I want to see a sequel that continues Nick and Judy's story as well as TV series and books that explore other characters in Zootopia as well as the wider world in which they live. While nothing could ever match the Star Wars Galaxy in terms of potential for an infinite number of stories, Zootopia is still in a class of its own. Twenty years from now I want to see this as a true franchise. For now, I am happy that the hard work of so many of the people who worked for many years turned out to be one of the best films Walt Disney has ever produced.",1468886400,,1023,4.412698412698413

7620848,5,B01B2CX0LU,"Zootopia is perhaps the best example in recent years of what can be done in an animated film if you have very talented and very bright film makers and $150 million to work with.  It also runs counter to my usual stance that the more cooks in the kitchen the lessor, more watered down is the final result.  We have three directors here and an astonishing 9 writers (including the three directors doing double duty).  But the thing instead of a big fat mess comes out at the end as a wonderful, witty, exciting children's film and a subtle, measured social critique for adults.  No wonder this excellent, exciting movie took in a stupendous one billion 22 million dollars at the box office.  Say what you will, the public does not plunk down a billion bucks on a stinker.
  The credit must go in large matter to the directors-Byron Howard (Tangled), Rich Moore (Wreck it Ralph) and Jarad Bush.  They managed to hold this gigantic effort together.  Maybe it just took three guys to direct a film of this scale.  The stellar cast helps too.  Actors lending their voices in large or small roles include Jason Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin as the leads, Nick Wilde and Judy Hops.  Idris Elba, Tommy Chong (very good as Yax the hipppy Yak), Oscar winner J.K. Simmons, Octavia Spencer and Kristen Bell.  Shakira provides the singing voice of pop princess Gazelle.
  The story is one of deep American tradition.  A young bunny has a dream and works with vigor and dedication for years to achieve that dream.  Sounds like Horatio Alger, doesn't it?  In this case, the little bunny, Judy Hops, wants to be a police woman.  An idea that seems laughable to the elephants, rinos, buffalo and other large beasts currently on the force.  Along the way we get lessons in 'species' profiling and the per-judgement of others.  These lessons are so deftly done as to not be offensive, which is a difficult needle to thread.  Too often elsewhere we have found films undone by self righteous preaching but not here.  The writers take the care and the time to show how these sins ill-effect specific persons and that makes the difference for me.
  The very name of the big city to which country rabbit Judy Hops travels to make her way in the world, Zootopia, is a play on the Greek concept of the perfect city, Utopia.  Utopia translates to 'Nowhere' as we know.  Judy Hop's notion of a perfect city, Zootopia, is also imperfect.  Not to give any thing away but the good guy, bad guy stereotype is also turned upside down by the clever writers.
  This is among the great films of all time.",1468886400,,2566,4.5881057268722465

7620897,5,B01B2CX0LU,"It was a very good movie. Unlike most movies today, it had a very strong moral and was not afraid to give the facts of today's illusion of perfection. Racial inequality, racial profiling, government corruption, and narrow-mindedness are all discovered and overcome in this movie. It's a nice change of pace than the regular ""evil guy tries to kill good guy but dies by good guy and everyone lives happily ever after."" That's not to mention to amazing physics, animation, and graphics. The fur looks very real as does the water and gravity works when it should and not just when it's plot relevant.
I would recommend this to any child or adult. 5/5",1468800000,,647,4.684210526315789

7620920,5,B01B2CX0LU,"I have long been a fan of Disney, and though their early efforts at non-Pixar CGI-animated films were somewhat hit-or-miss (""Chicken Little,"" ""Dinosaur,"" ""Bolt""), their recent output has been nothing short of fantastic.  I love films like ""Tangled"" and ""Big Hero 6,"" and while ""Frozen"" wore out its welcome in a hurry, it's still enjoyable once you get over the hype.  So I had high hopes for ""Zootopia,"" even if it looked like little more than a kid-friendly buddy-cop movie with animals in place of people.

While it does fall into the usual cliches at times, ""Zootopia"" is a wonderful film, with gorgeous animation and a powerful, timely story about prejudice, determination, and following your dreams.

""Zootopia"" takes place in a world without humans, where animals have evolved into semi-anthropomorphic sentient creatures with their own civilization, albeit one adapted to handle creatures of every shape and size.  Judy, a young bunny, dreams of becoming a police officer despite the objections of her parents, and soon is off to the big city of Zootopia to join the police force... only to find herself relegated to giving out parking tickets.  When animals begin disappearing under mysterious circumstances, she begs the chief to give her a chance, and she sets out to find one of the missing creatures herself.  Her mission leads to an unlikely partnership with Nick, a con-fox who sees her as a joke... until the two of them uncover a sinister conspiracy regarding the disappearances, one that will shake Zootopia to its foundations and lead Judy to question everything she knows.  Can a naive but determined rabbit-cop and a cynical fox save Zootopia's citizens and restore peace to the city?

The animation in this film is gorgeous, with a colorful and imaginative city-scape interspersed with lush wilderness areas.  The creatures are also well-animated, just anthropomorphic enough to have some human mannerisms but still clearly animals, with skin and hair rendered lushly and without the ""fake"" or ""stiff"" look often seen in early or poorer animation.  The colors are vibrant without being garish, and the film experiments with a lot of lighting and atmospheric elements (rain, snow, dim corridors, storms) to create a variety of moods, which I liked.

The voice cast does a superb job in this film.  In my mind a film works best when you can lose yourself in it enough to not go ""hey, it's that guy!"" and can simply appreciate characters as characters rather than actors or voices.  The only moment I had in the film was hearing Chief Bogo open his mouth and hearing Idris Elba come out, and even then I think his voice fit perfectly for the character.

The story itself is a powerful one, and rather timely -- a story about racism and how it divides us, and how the solution to prejudice is not to replace one prejudice with another.  Given that this film hit theaters and DVD the same year as some nasty real-world events that I won't go into right now, it's a message we desperately need.  The film is a reminder that we need to look past surface appearance and past origins, and appreciate people for who they are as a person rather than how they look or where they come from.  Though the racism allegory is only part of the message -- there's also a strong ""follow your dreams"" message, one that encourages the viewer not to give up on their dreams, even if everything seems stacked against them.  Judy in particular is one of the best female role models I've seen in a film since ""Pacific Rim's"" Mako Mori -- a girl focused on a dream that, for once, doesn't revolve around a love interest, and who has personality beyond being the token girl in the cast.  Go Disney!

The film is quite funny and even warm-hearted, though there are a few moments that come across as shockingly mean-spirited.  While some of these moments play into the plot (such as a few dark moments from both Nick and Judy's childhoods), a few come across as jarring and unnecessary, such as a child flat-out saying ""my mommy says she wishes you were dead.""  Was this really necessary?  It's a minor quibble in an otherwise decent movie, but still, I'm sure there's more than one parent out there that would balk at showing that particular scene to their children.

Also a minor quibble, but... where are all the reptiles, amphibians, and birds?  There are more kinds of animals out there besides mammals, but they don't seem to exist in this film.  Is this world entirely mammal-centric, or did the filmmakers simply decide to leave out other races?  Perhaps the sequel will address this...

A delightful film with a powerful and resonant message, this is another great entry in Disney's recent output.  Probably best for ages 8 and up due to some frightening scenes and (bloodless) violence.",1468800000,,4788,4.8178484107579465

Too bad the plot and the characters didn't really have much depth. And too bad also that the best scenes were pulled from other films -- the Godfather, G.I. Jane, some others that I recognized but couldn't place.  The sloth joke wasn't even funny, it was just painful and awkward to sit through. Part of me thinks that this was too kid-oriented, but in reality, the subject matter was not suitable for children, and the underlying messages were pretty dark. The end relies on a cliched reconcilliation (the feels forced and fake) and then an author's saving throw.

Not really sure what they were going for with this film -- I think it probably suffered from too many cooks.",1468713600,,828,4.625850340136054

We knew almost nothing about it, but the trailers we'd seen individually had got us interested enough, so we just went ahead and watched it, not expecting much of anything. Just a few minutes in and both my friend and I were hooked. By the end, we were completely glad we'd gone to see it. I almost never feel like rewatching movies (or watching them for a first time, honestly), yet I've rewatched 3 times now. It was funny, had beautiful visuals, a great message, nice storytelling, was a length that didn't feel too long or too short, and had lovely character development and relationship dynamics.

7621037,5,B01B2CX0LU,"5 Stars.  Byron Howard [Bolt (2008) and Tangled (2010)] and Rich Moore [Wreck-It Ralph (2012) and director for a number of animated TV shows like The Simpsons and Futurama] team up and bring us a stellar buddy cop movie in the form of animals. Using her brain, the overachieving Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) is able to overcome the tasks made for larger animals. She becomes the first rabbit cop in the big city of Zootopia, which is a far cry from the farm where she grew up. To her dismay she becomes a traffic cop, and she learns her first big lesson when she helps out a fox, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), only to realize that he hustled her. She ends up being at the right moment and time and takes on one of the many missing person cases in Zootopia. Given only 48hrs, she hustles Nick into helping her. They become fast friends and discover why people are going missing. Of course, its not all is as it seems, and there are few bumps in the road. There are also some notable actors to help the cast along; Idris Elba, Tommy Chong, and J.K. Simmons. The fun animal humor aside, like the sloths at the DMV, the movie is structured around the classic buddy cop movie, like 48hrs (1982). (Check out my review of 48hrs here). It has the cop and con artist and they have only 48 hours. The movie though is a little more quirky and plotted like Eddie Murphys other buddy cop fair, Beverly Hills Cop (1984). Its also an underdog story, where a small rabbit tries to prove that she can do a job thats mainly done by lions, rhinos, and larger animals. Its political as one of the main conflicts is the notion of predators vs. prey. Zootopia is a city where animals all live in harmony, but like race and gender in todays society its not all what it seems. Its also refreshing to have a female heroin thats not a princess. Not as action packed as the Academy Award winning Big Hero 6 (2014), but Disney still continues to take pages from the Pixar playbook. Theyve created a touching story that deals with larger issues like prejudice and stereotypes. Being fun for all the family, its no wonder that it was a box-office hit and the 2nd highest grossing Disney movie outside of Frozen (2013). Its definitely worth checking out of children and adults of all ages.",1468627200,8,2257,4.43855421686747

7621044,3,B01B2CX0LU,"Genre: Computer animated animal adventure
Stars: 3

Pros:
-Animation was good
-No bad voice acting (I always hate the one character that doesn't sound right)
-Social message played many sides (Don't let anyone tell you there is a simple translation socially of this movie)

Cons:
-Not cute (I went in thinking this would be cute)
-Story-line was too intense for the trailers I saw (bait and switch)

Summary, This movie got serious and dark 32 minutes into it and never really got out of it.  Some of the references (Frozen and Glue) were pretty good but it was not really a movie for kids.  It had some interesting social commentary that I could see would take many different interpretations, but the ""Big"" issue was extremely formulaic (like I have see it done in every odd number Disney/Pixar/Dreamworks/etc  movie this exact same way) and it knocked the movie flat.  In the end I wondered ""Who was this movie made for?"" and the only answer I could come up with was Hyper-political-cartoon-loving-social-activist...I guess we really have gotten to the point where we will watch anything.

Not recommended but it won't kill you to watch it (once).",1468627200,,1149,4.88659793814433

7621146,2,B01B2CX0LU,"I rented Zootopia for my 3 1/2 year old daughter thinking it would be a nice change of pace from her current favorites (Frozen -- which never seems to get old, Alice in Wonderland and Song of the Sea).  It had a promising start, interesting premise; the animal kingdom sans humans allowing the animals to walk in human shoes, literally.  The characters were compelling-- a teeny-tiny female bunny dreams of becoming a cop despite being, a) a female, and b) dramatically smaller and less physically strong than the other animals and through wit and determination she achieves her goal---a good solid start. Then the sweet little super smart and spunky bunny actually accomplishes her goal, gets to the city and.... up to here it's still feeling like a kids movie, but it gets increasingly serious. By the time the movie has clocked 20 minutes the story line has turned into a borderline adult crime drama only animated.  It gets darker and scarier as the movie continues. By the time we're half way through the movie my daughter has asked me 3 times if we can watch something else or turn it off. The first two times I reminded her that the one scene was scary, but that the scary part was about to be over, by the third time I was in agreement with her.  What started out as a fun make-believe romp hard turned into a movie length animated episode of NYPD blue w/ animals playing all the characters.  It was beautifully animated and had a promising start but was not nearly fun or funny enough to hold the attention of either a child or adult audience.",1468540800,,1552,4.568345323741007

7621149,4,B01B2CX0LU,"Watched it with my 21 yr old son.  We enjoyed it.  It is not for small children as it has two very shocking scenes.  Both at the beginning of the movie.  One was blood spurting from ketchup bottle in a very realistic death scene and then there was the animal nudist colony ... yes I know animals are nude anyway but they did make it seem like a lot more than that.  Really Disney, those two scenes we could have done without!
But for most of the movie, it was very entertaining.  Definitely teen and up age suitability.",1468540800,,519,4.244897959183674

Zootopia has a lovely message of inclusiveness, as well as ""Real change starts with you...and with me"". All of that may sound a little trite, but in the context of the film, it was a lovely message, one that I needed to hear, and one we ALL need to heed. Zootopia is a great movie.

7621289,4,B01B2CX0LU,"This is a high quality animation film just like all Disney films are and it has some really cute characters and beautiful landscapes and music.  However I was disappointed that it was so much like an animated cop show and strove for such political correctness in the conversations.  It did not feel like classic Disney to me, it felt contrived at times.  That is why I can only give it 4 stars. I think the scene with the sloths is probably the best one in the entire movie!!",1468540800,,475,4.375

7621308,5,B01B2CX0LU,"I think this is my third favorite Pixar, after WALL-E and The Incredibles.  The animation is perfect, the characters are interesting, the story is creative, and there are just the right number of adult references to keep the big folks happy.  Keep an eye open for the shot-by-shot Breaking Bad reference!  This is one of the few Pixar movies where I'd really like to see a sequel, I am very fond of the characters and would like to spend more time with them.

Buy the version with the bonus features, it doesn't cost any more and has lots of great back stories.  Enjoy!",1468540800,,569,4.485436893203883

7621429,4,B01B2CX0LU,"4 Stars. Byron Howard [Bolt (2008) and Tangled (2010)] and Rich Moore [Wreck-It Ralph (2012) and director for a number of animated TV shows like The Simpsons and Futurama] team up and bring us a stellar buddy cop movie in the form of animals.  Using her brain, the overachieving Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) is able to overcome the tasks made for larger animals. She becomes the first rabbit cop in the big city of Zootopia, which is a far cry from the farm where she grew up. To her dismay she becomes a traffic cop, and she learns her first big lesson when she helps out a fox, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), only to realize that he hustled her. She ends up being at the right moment and time and takes on one of the many missing person cases in Zootopia. Given only 48hrs, she hustles Nick into helping her. They become fast friends and discover why people are going missing. Of course, its not all is as it seems, and there are few bumps in the road. There are also some notable actors to help the cast along; Idris Elba, Tommy Chong, and J.K. Simmons. The fun animal humor aside, like the sloths at the DMV, the movie is structured around the classic buddy cop movie, like 48hrs (1982). (Check out my review of 48hrs here). It has the cop and con artist and they have only 48 hours. The movie though is a little more quirky and plotted like Eddie Murphys other buddy cop fair, Beverly Hills Cop (1984). Its also an underdog story, where a small rabbit tries to prove that she can do a job thats mainly done by lions, rhinos, and larger animals. Its political as one of the main conflicts is the notion of predators vs. prey. Zootopia is a city where animals all live in harmony, but like race and gender in todays society its not all what it seems. Its also refreshing to have a female heroin thats not a princess. Not as action packed as the Academy Award winning Big Hero 6 (2014), but Disney still continues to take pages from the Pixar playbook. Theyve created a touching story that deals with larger issues like prejudice and stereotypes. Being fun for all the family, its no wonder that it was a box-office hit and the 2nd highest grossing Disney movie outside of Frozen (2013). Its definitely worth checking out of children and adults of all ages.",1468454400,,2257,4.43855421686747
