I have been searching the net for this for weeks. Brooke Allsion did a good job but yours was more than memorable.  My daughter is learning the song.  We have been looking for the music or karoke version...obviously to no avail/

1645914,5,B00005QAP7,"Hello everyone... my name is Lauren Kinkade, and I was the singer you heard on the end credit song ""Say Goodbye"".  Thank you all for your kind words!!  ""Say Goodbye"" is a great song, and hopefully someday, it will be released.  But as of right now, the only place you will find it is on the DVD or VHS.
Thanks again everyone!",1033344000,14,325,4.209677419354839
1645915,3,B00005QAP7,"The cast is really wonderful -- especially Melanie Griffith and Penelope Ann Miller.  But Patrick Swayze hitting the road for a 2000 mile road trip with a very unstable ex-girlfriend (Griffith) to see the son he never had was so forced and almost laughable the way it was handled.  To up and leave his wife (Miller) stranded at a restaurant that way was not at all believeable.  That's the fault of the script, not the actors.  It just wasn't thought out enough.  There's a really touching scene in the airplane between Miller and Steven Bauer (one of Griffith's real-life exs) that was award worthy.  Unfortunately, this movie would never have made 20 bucks had it been released in theatres.  You're better off with a DVD.  And yes, the song is really, really beautiful.  Wish I could find this on CD.",1019779200,5,802,4.671428571428572
1645916,4,B00005QAP7,"Don't expect a lot from this DVD, it offers just two buttons for you to touch: ""View trailer"" and ""Play movie"". No scene access, no special features. Yea, that's sad. But the film itself makes up to what's missing on the DVD. Melanie Griffith gives a superb performance as a schizophrenic ex-girlfriend and distressed mother. You'll love the nostalgic scene of her and Patrick Swayze, from different corners of the world, watching ""The Hustler"" on TV and getting lost in their memories. And the fabulous musical score is definitely some ""bonus material"" to this romantic drama -- especially the last song (""Say Goodbye"", written by Serge Colbert, Mark Portman & Alan Rich and performed by Lauren Kinkade). That melody, along with Griffith's childlike smile, will surely capture your heart.",1017619200,13,789,5.124031007751938
1645917,5,B00005QAP7,"I loved this movie.  Any movie that can make me laugh and cry is excellent in my book!
If anyone can help me, I am trying also to find out how to find the last song: Say Goodbye.  I watched the credits 5 times trying to figure out who the artist was but couldn't read it!
Excellent acting !",1012521600,,290,3.8983050847457625
1645918,2,B00005QAP7,"The movie seemed to move to quickly without having a chance to really know the characters. Big parts of information were left out until the end and it was hard to feel the emotion needed to really get in touch with the film. The acting seemed too artificial probably because the characters had not really gotten to play opposite one another very often except for Melanie's and Patrick's characters. It just didn't allow your feelings to build and grow. It just went from one conflict to another, until it just seemed to far-fetched. I really do like all the actors, Melanie Griffith, Patrick Swayze, even the young boy who played their son, loved him in Sweet Jane! Anyways, they just couldn't get this picture to be more than 2 stas for me, I wish it could have been more, since they had such talented actors!

1645945,5,B00005QAP7,A stellar movie by both actors that leads to the beginning of Ben's (Swayze) start in life with Lulu (Griffith) and ends with a fantastic scene of them meeting their child for the 1st time in 16 years.

So he goes to see her and she tells him that they had a son. So after the shock wears off. they go to fine him. His wife gets jealous and flies to where ever they went. She tells him that ""She came, because if her marriage to him was going to fall apart, she wanted to be there when it happened."". So all three of them go looking for this boy of where he lives. They find him and he wants to know ""Why now?"" and he is alittle bit rebellious. Then they go there separate ways and Patrick writes a book on this and he sends  copy to Melanie. I got a bit confused with this. because one minute it made you think that he was leaving his wife. Sometimes Melanie acted like she had some mental problems in this movie, almost like she was a psycho.",1396656000,,871,4.034682080924855

1645979,4,B00005QAP7,"A later release for Diamond P Sports, this video still provides a thrill! Bob Frey hosts the tape, but rarely chimes in as the video clips speak for themselves.

This tape is mostly comprised of clips from the NHRA (top fuel, funny car, pro stock, & pro stock bike), but dirt sprint cars, high-powered speed boats, and swamp buggies are featured as well.

1645982,5,B00005QAP7,"This is an excellent movie, with a good soundtrack. It leaves you torn between wishing that Patrick Swayze would run off with his first love, and also hoping that he'll patch up his troubled marriage. His ability as an actor was breathtaking because he was allowing us to see how truly in love his still was with his old flame yet truly committed to his wife, despite the imperfections. You could really feel his emotions in his performance. That's why I bought the DVD, even though it's a tearjerker.",1261958400,,501,4.640449438202247

I have been trying to find the song ""Say Goodbye"" from this movie. I can't find it. I am not sure but looking at the credits I think the singer of this song is Laurn Kincade..something like that. Nothing shows up in my Amazon search..

1645984,4,B00005QAP7,"I have to admit I have never seen or heard of this movie when it first came out.....I was in my kitchen washing dishes this weekend where i get just one channel in the kitchen....And this was on...It was in the middle of the film,and I had to watch to the end...

My only problem would be the portrayal of the birth mother..I am a a birthmother married to the birth father...The media, movies and tv constantly portray us in a bad light...But looking past that the feelings and emotionals where right on in this movie...I was crying so hard at the end...My daughter came in and held me...

My son has expressed the same emotions as the young boy. It was so great I have to buy and watch with my husband......The rollercoster ride is so true....The feelings in a reunion as so great..The greatest fear and love you could ever experience...",1168214400,2,838,4.470588235294118
1646015,4,B00005QAP7,"Tearful and melodramatic plot that it focuses in the attempts of a mother in search of her son, sixteen years after she was born. His biological father never knew she was pregnant and because of the fact they were simple lovers, he married with a therapist and suddenly, she reappears -coming from san Francisco to Chicago - in his life in search of his support to find him.

Uneven and even predictable script where Patrick Swayze shines with intensity.",1153785600,3,454,4.746835443037975
1646016,4,B00005QAP7,"Where this film isn't a masterpiece by any means, it is certainly worth the time. Melanie Griffith shines in her role as Lulu and Joseph Gordon-Levitt stands out yet again in the role of Martin. Unfortunately, his time is much too brief in the film, as I think he's probably the most underrated actor today. He's extremely believable in his role and he showed us exactly how one would act in the situation his character was in.

Give the film a shot, it's worth the time- forget some of the characters Swayze has played in the past and look at him for the character he's playing now. Watch Melanie become Lulu... And lastly, you'll believe Gordon-Levitt is Martin in the awkward situation he's been thrown into.

Acting is an A, film is a B.",1129507200,2,741,4.522388059701493
1646017,4,B00005QAP7,"A good storyline.  Melanie Griffith is believable as LuLu.  Penelope Ann Miller's character, Clare, needed to be developed a bit more.  Patrick Swayze is just darned okay by me.

1646019,4,B00005QAP7,"When I first saw this movie for rent, I initially pitied Melanie Griffith as seemingly her movies are now at the ""straight-to-video"" status.  However, being an admitted fan of the lady, I rented it and was pleasantly surprised.  Yes, the production is not great, but the acting by Griffith and Penelope Ann Miller is very good.  (Swayze seemed to have been trying too hard.)

An interesting aside is that Griffith's character in SOMETHING WILD, an excellent film, was also named Lulu.  Therefore, I think of it as a sort of continuation of her story...",1105228800,3,552,4.829787234042553
1646020,4,B00005QAP7,"The production of this DVD is quite cheap. You find only trailer and the moive, not even subtitles. Yet, the story is quite touchy. It may spare you a tear at the end of the film. Both Patrick Swayze and Melanie Griffith gives their great performing. Overall the movie is very heartwarming, much better than I expected.",1085097600,11,319,4.614035087719298
1646021,5,B00005QAP7,"This DVD of the cable film from STARZ, Forever Lulu, received terrible reviews but I think it is an extraordinary story of two people, Lulu (Melanie Griffith) and Ben (Patrick Swayze) who shared a summer romance and tragically experience the descent of Lulu (Melanie Griffith) into mental illness.  Sixteen years later, escaping from a halfway mental health home, Lulu sneaks away to see Ben and to his surprise tells him about a son he does not know he has.  They drive to Wisconsin to see the boy while Ben's wife, Helen (Penelope Ann Miller), threatened by this intrusion into their marriage and unresolved feelings over the death of their young son, follows them to Wisconsin and after an emotional meeting of the three, each struggles to resolve their conflicting feelings and unsettling switches of roles. The three all travel to see the son who initially rejects his new found parents but comes to understand why their relationship happened and why they could not be a family. Finally, Ben and Lulu realize they will always be in love with each other but can only remain a memory.  Wonderful performances and a real examination of the discrimination of those with mental illness but the power of Griffith to overcome the stigma, ""(to son after he apologizes for calling his mother crazy) I am crazy, it makes it easier that way.""  This film, while not based on a strong script, works on many levels making you feel the pathos of the relationship between these characters stumbling to deal with their feelings and the circumstances of their lives.  The score is worth the price of the DVD, (""Say Goodbye"", written by Serge Colbert, Mark Portman & Alan Rich and performed by Lauren Kinkade). Get out a box of Kleenix if you like to drain your sinuses.",1069977600,18,1756,4.801324503311259

7949916,4,B00005QAP7,"Patrick Swayze (R.I.P) does a fantastic performance in this movie. Kind of reminds me of ""Bird On A Wire"".

Ben Clifton (Swayze) reunites with his old flame Lulu (Melanie Griffith) after she runs away from the hospital. Lulu has an mental illness. She is able to track down her old flame and informs him they had a son 15 years ago. You see, flashbacks from their times together and some of the difficulties they have endured together.

Ben is married to Claire (Penelope Ann Miller) which sadly lost their child of 5 to cancer. Both Lulu and Ben hit the road to track down their son to see him. Only Claire meets them there.

Joseph Gordon Levitt plays Martin, their son.

Very well acted and comedy as well emotional.
