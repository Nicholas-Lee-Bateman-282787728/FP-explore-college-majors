7210806,3,B00YB41F4Q,"Based on a true story. Habitual offender Robert Stewart (Leeshon Alexander) was placed in the same cell as Zahid Mubarek (Aymen Hamdouchi). Robert is a psychotic racist who talks to himself. The results weren't good. The film has some flashbacks to an abused childhood, but it is mostly Robert talking to himself. The film was interesting for a while, except there are only so many conversations I can watch a person have with themselves before I get bored, and this film definitely crossed the line. Did I mention Robert talks to himself?

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1432771200,7,573,4.846938775510204
8718072,2,B00YB41F4Q,we're told this is a true story.  so what !  that doesn't make this a good movie. and who's truth is it.  it is an ugly movie. that's my truth.,1517184000,,143,3.7
8718073,1,B00YB41F4Q,Holy s*** this movie is freaking terrible.  So weird.  Alternating POV and dialogue coming from nowhere.  This is actually an interesting story that was destroyed by some one trying to make an artsy fartsy film.  Super mad I payed money to watch this garbage and wasted a portion of my life enduring this train wreck of a film.  Boo!,1448496000,3,333,4.576271186440678
8718074,5,B00YB41F4Q,Unexpected. I can't believe it is a true story.,1448150400,,47,4.333333333333333

8718076,3,B00YB41F4Q,Very dark movie. Thought provoking though.,1446940800,,42,6.166666666666667
8718077,4,B00YB41F4Q,"Pretty good psychological thriller. It was slow in some parts, but it was very disturbing that nobody did anything. This was preventable. His roommate just didn't understand the terminology that he needed to convey to the guards to get the sociopath or psychopath out of the room. He was talking about himself in the third person!!!  That is a big red flag.",1441843200,,357,4.758064516129032

8718079,4,B00YB41F4Q,"Based on real events this film starts out with Robert Stewart being discovered in his cell after he has murdered his cell mate Zahid Mubarek . The film then traces the events that led up to this murder. In doing so it appears to have drawn heavily on the findings of the inquiry into the events at Feltham Young Offender Institute during the year 2000.

Stewart is played by Leeshon Alexander who also wrote this and he puts in a very commendable performance. The back story includes unvarnished criticisms of the Prison Service too and an attempt to understand why he did this terrible and unprovoked act.

In terms of presentation this is a very `staged' performance with few locations and obvious sets, but this is done for artistic impact and I felt actually worked really well. This is not an easy watch though as the material being covered is one that is alien to most people; it is though a very worthwhile piece of movie making that will appeal to those who like real life dramas and don't mind starting with the ending - especially one that is essentially an unhappy one.",1437868800,3,1080,4.590673575129534
8718080,3,B00YB41F4Q,"It is a movie that will make you think. If you have ever been inside a prison or lived in one, then this is sa must-see and you can easily understand the movie. When a non-violent criminal has to live with the violent, and/or lifetimers, you will either become violent or risk the chance of ending up as the poor boy did in this movie. The majority of prisoners, whether US or the UK is for non-violent crimes, such as stealing and for drug-related crimes. You should NEVER mix the non-violent offenders with the lifers; or else bad things will continue to happen. Then there is the innocent victims who were found guilty due to innacurate information.",1437177600,,652,4.581196581196581
8718081,5,B00YB41F4Q,This is one of the most interesting events that I had read about many years ago. It was so well brought together in this film. I can't believe this actually happened. I would highly recommend to anyone who knows about the story and is interested. Even if you don't know about what happened this film is awesome.,1433462400,,311,4.473684210526316
