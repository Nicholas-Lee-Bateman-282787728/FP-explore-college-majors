2701062,4,B000LAZDOW,"Adapted from a book about the evolution of movies based on more and better ways to kill, this cable doc has grisly highlights, behind-the-scenes stories, and some fairly thoughtful explanations for why murders are so fascinating to watch from writers, directors and fans. The history starts with two seminal 1960 films: the underrated British film Peeping Tom from director Michael Powell and the far-more-successful Psycho  from American visual genius Alfred Hitchcock. Then it leapfrogs into and out of three general eras of slasher films. The first era begins with 1978's Halloween, with a masked killer pig-sticking teenagers in a quiet suburban neighborhood. It peters out in the early 1980s, as gratuitous masked-murderer films piggyback on Halloween's cliches.

A new burst of creativity arises with 1984's A Nightmare on Elm Street, dumped by its first studio because people didn't want to see movies about dreams, according to writer-director Wes Craven. Writer-directors had to pull out the punches in gore as movie fans had seen it all in the first wave. This era died about the time Reagan left office.

We are in the third era, according to documentarians. Horror films and slasher films in particular have been going strong since films such as Scream laughed at the genre and films such as Saw showed some of the most awful, realistic gore imaginable.

Going to Pieces never gets into academic or psychological discussions for why gore appeals. It lets the makers of gore and its fans expound their theories: Gore succeeds at times of great societal fear (Vietnam, nuclear war, serial killers). Gore shows us a part of humanity--the ephemeral nature of the human body, and our very human need to see violence (the horrors of the Roman Colosseum are brought up briefly). Everyone poo-poohs film critics' theory that slasher films denigrate women; after all, aren't women usually the victorious heroines these days? And what's wrong with sex in horror films?, asks a feminist-director.

Ultimately, the film is an homage to the fans. It shares stories and opinions that might not have been gleaned in director's cut commentaries, and it ends with shout-outs to the fans who made it happen. Those who can't stomach gore should avoid this--it's sometimes a greatest-hits of hacking.",1174176000,17,2292,5.16711590296496
2701063,5,B000LAZDOW,"Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of Slasher Films in an amazing Documentary that goes behind the story, scenes, sets, and scandal that came and went with all the previous Slasher Films of the past. This Documentary doesn't go as far as Nosfaratu, but From as Early as Wes Craven's Most creative and scary film, ""The Last House on the Left"" to more recent slasher films like ""Hostel"". For a 90 minute documentary, it does not bore to hear how many Slasher films tried to mimic the very first and very creative films before them, like ""Friday the 13th"", and how many underwent controversy to try to get recognized, some for reasonable ways, and others that tried to get shock value by having commericals that advertised such films. If you are Squemish, the various films that are shown might bother you, as every film tries to show off a few of the death Scenes in their movies.

If you are a fan of the Slasher film, be it a very close follower of the genre, or a new beginner to the series, it's good to know why the roots of Horror once began, and it's very apparent and clear, as long as there are viewers, People that can write scripts, and actors, Horror Films are here to stay.",1167782400,3,1184,4.406392694063927

2701066,4,B000LAZDOW,"Going to Pieces (2006) is an enjoyable feature about the history of slasher films. As with many adaptations, the book offers more analysis and insight especially regarding the pre-history of the slasher. There are many slasher film clips throughout and John Carpenter is the main focus. Wes Craven, Tom Savini, Joseph Stefano, Jeff Katz, Rob Zombie and others are interviewed. Some of the biggest franchises (notably Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street) aren't really given their due. Fortunately Freddy and Jason have their own retrospective documentaries. While it does have some flaws it is still one of the better horror documentaries out there right now. I prefer the book because it is much more comprehensive and complete. This documentary is especially light on info after the mid 1980's and giallo films. The book makes it clear that the slasher rose in 1978 and fell by 1986. The reality is that the slasher was huge for a short time only. Those of us who lived through it still have many fond memories of the era.

Going to Pieces misses the mark in some areas. It is too short for its content. It glosses over or ignores important slasher films. It jumps around and has too many missing pieces to be comprehensive. It wasn't made by the fans or for the fans. Originally I did not think it was as great as it could have been. I must admit I felt this DVD didn't do the slasher justice but it is hard to cover hundreds of films in a 88-minute documentary anyway. However, I have since watched about 25 other horror documentaries and must admit that Going to Pieces is one of the better ones. This DVD seems to go out of print at times so grab a copy if you can.

Special Features: Filmmaker commentary, A Message from author Adam Rockoff, Bonus interviews, Trivia game, Trailers

Horror Docs: GTP is the best of the slasher horror documentaries. It tends to be much more ""on message"" than American Nightmare or Nightmares in Red, White and Blue so enjoy the ride. They all tend to remarkably similar in tone and content. It is nowhere near as good as Never Sleep Again or Crystal Lake Memories but does fill in some gaps because of the sheer volume of slashers that were produced.

Horror Film Books: Freaks consider Crystal Lake Memories and Going to Pieces as must-own items for their collection. The slasher gets much more respect in print.",1351123200,,2361,4.668269230769231

WTF?! why do I have to buy the same spoon fed lies? and then ""corporate America"" ? huh if your a film maker and your dealing with a studio that makes you part of ""Corporate America"" too. I don't care what John Carpenter thinks(didn't he get away with Murder? by his connection with The Hogan's Heroes guy?)the documentary should keep it's opinion not FACTS to itself. other than that.......

2701069,5,B000LAZDOW,"GOING TO PIECES is a documentary based on Adam Rockoff's text of the same title. While it would be extremely difficult to cover all of the many titles included in the original book, the film version does an amazing job at tackling as much material as possible in a short amount of time. What it also offers and improves upon are the lengthy on-screen interviews with the actors, directors, and film critics involved in each of these films. That isn't to say that the book is devoid of these interviews, but many of them were reduced to a few short lines to fit into the context of the paragraph. The film adapts the same basic framework constructed by Rockoff to introduce truncated pieces of information from the book as introductions into these interviews, and then allows the filmmakers to elaborate on each topic as it pertained to their specific films and careers. Interviewees include Wes Craven, Tom Savini, Tony Timpone of Fangoria Magazine, Amy Holden Jones, Betsy Palmer, the late Stan Winston, and an impressive slew of others. I never grow tired of hearing these Horror greats discuss their motivations, struggles, and socio-political influences, and any true fan who's interest falls further than the films themselves will truly enjoy the feature. And what would a documentary on Slashers be without a ton of awesomely bloody clips, either? GOING TO PIECES delivers all of the best scenes from films ranging from Mario Bava's BAY OF BLOOD, to PIECES, to THE PROWLER, MY BLOODY VALENTINE, and many more. It serves as an excellent introduction to these films, but viewer beware, there be spoilers afoot! This is a must-see, must-own for any Slasher fan, period. Buy the book, buy the DVD, then make some popcorn and enjoy!

2701070,4,B000LAZDOW,"""Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film"" chronicles just that: the prestigious and respectable beginnings that quickly gave way to the cheap and lazy knock-offs that saturated and diluted the genre. Whether the films were attempting to create  luminary icons such as Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger or cashing in on even the most trivial of holidays, they enjoyed their fair bit of success, made on a shoe-string budget and backed by major studios who treated them like red-headed step-children. The films were gory, gratuitous, often over the top and almost always a pleasure for genre fans, which of course means they were chastised by critics and the MPAA did all they could to neuter them.

Featuring interviews with legendary directors such as John Carpenter and Wes Craven, as well as special effects heroes like Tom Savini and the late Stan Winston, ""Going to Pieces"" does a fair job of assessing the sub-genre as a whole while shedding some light on some more obscure fare that got overshadowed by the blockbusters that defined the era. It recalls a time when special effects were practical and suspense was key. You didn't need a star or a pretty face, just a relatable character and an unrelenting madman. Even the lesser films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slumber-Party-Massacre/dp/6305976414/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slumber Party Massacre</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepaway-Camp/dp/6305841985/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepaway Camp</a>&nbsp;were enjoyable despite their lack of originality, and the documentary acknowledges that. Sometimes it digs deeper, questioning the mindset of the parents who rallied against the biggest offenders, as well as big time critics like Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, who strip away much of their credibility in failing to realize the purpose of these films, and that is to viscerally entertain its audience, thus providing the ultimate escapism.

""Going to Pieces"" is nothing if not thorough. It leaves virtually no slasher film untouched and treats its subject with the utmost integrity. It manages to capture all of the nostalgia fans associate with these films, but at the same time, recognizes the downfalls of the genre and doesn't view everything at hand with rose-tinted glasses. Even still, if you remember the golden age of the slasher film and remember what it was like to be truly disgusted and yet entertained at the same time, ""Going To Pieces"" will go a long way in unearthing those old feelings as well as providing a substantial education in the genre. It's rare that these films are treated with respect and discussed in-depth, therefore, this is one documentary you won't want to overlook.",1258588800,5,2789,5.619952494061757
2701071,5,B000LAZDOW,"Here is an inside look at the history of the much malgined genre with such directors and stars like Rob Zombie, John Carpenter, Wes Craven, Tom Savini, Sean S. Cunningham, Paul Lynch (""Prom Night"" director), Betsy Palmer (""Friday The 13th 1980"" fame), Felissa Rose (""Sleepaway Camp"" fame) and more all discuss the history of the slasher genre that started well with Alfred Hitchcock's famed ""Psycho"" to the glorious 70's/80's slasher pics like ""Halloween"", ""Friday The 13th"", ""Prom Night"", ""Sleepaway Camp"", ""The Burning"", ""Maniac"", ""Pieces"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Black Christmas"", ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" etc. to the postmodern classics like ""Scream"", ""Saw"", ""Hostel"" and ""House of 1000 Corpses/Devil's Rejects"". This one shows backgrounds on these films, their successes, some of their controversies including a clip of Siskle and Ebert debating on the violence in these movies and of course how they created iconic characters such as Freddy, Jason, Michael, Jigsaw, Leatherface and others even on the rise of obscure actors to big stars.

This DVD has some fine extras as it has trailer, audio commentary, a message from author Adam Rockoff before you watch the movie, bonus interviews, and Trivia game to test your slasher movie knowledge.",1252368000,2,1254,5.365482233502538
2701072,3,B000LAZDOW,"I had this show on dvr for a long time, it was a great film. I recently purchased the film on dvd and boy what a mess this film is! Everything is scattered and hard to follow. They should have started off with Pyscho and then went thru the 70's, starting with the slasher film Black Christmas. Halloween is an excellent film and most consider it the first slasher film, which is fine but Black Christmas cannot be ignored. They show lots of good clips but like I said, the story is all over the place and makes no sense. The end of the documentary was like every other documentary ive seen-starts strong and ends quickly. The 90's brought the death of many horror icons-Pinhead (who was omitted from the film for no reason), Freddy, Jason, Myers, and Leatherface. Then its revived for Scream and the genere is forever ruined. Now we have rappers and tv stars who are hot at the moment starring in horror films, pg-13 horror films that come out on dvd unrated, straight to dvd horror films that are sometimes good and most often bad. Friday The 13th is the most ripped off movie but there are some good movies based on it. I love horror but this is not the movie you want to see if you want a soild look at films.

2701076,5,B000LAZDOW,"I recently got this movie. And I had seen it about a year ago I couldn't remember any nudity being shown. So in light of it being the halloween season I was looking forward to showing this to my kids in a sort of educational review of the genre. And I couldn't find any mention to content - other than what I knew was going to be in there, gore.

Well although they did cut out most sexual content they left about 6 female frontal shots in. Most of it is pretty brief, except one.

Don't get me wrong, the sexual content is probably one of the main reasons as a teen I started watching horror movies! But for what I was wanting the movie for -helping spread the love of horror- I needed something without nudity or very brief nudity.

I guess the main problem is that there is no mention of this content ANYWHERE on the web. So I'm adding it here so no one else is left clueless.

But then again, how many parents have their Disney/Nickelodeon watching kids sit down and watch clips of some of the greatest horror movies ever made days before halloween? probably not many.",1225324800,,1072,4.292079207920792
2701077,2,B000LAZDOW,"Going to Pieces had great promise but alas vastly disappointing.
This is a quasi ""documentary"" and more like a glorified
entertainment tonight type show doing a special on slasher films.
If you're looking for history and a sense of ""connecting the dots""
between films and their respective time-lines..you won't find it here.

Case in point,""Psycho"" and ""Peeping Tom"" [both 1960] get about a 60 second mention...fast fwd to 1978!?! Let's skip the entire Italian giallo period...minus a brief [yet again]mention of Mario Bava and let's not even acknowledge ""Black Christmas"" [1974]or ""Schizo"" [1976] both of these films are forerunners to the genre and yet they're completely ignored.

Although ""going to pieces"" boasts some great clips and some decent interviews, it's all so quick and clearly catering to the
""attention span zero"" generation. Finally,I can accept the inclusion of neo-slasher films like ""Scream"" & ""I Know What you did Last Summer"". However,why are films such as ""SAW"" and ""Hostel"" that are definitely NOT slasher films shown..let alone discussed..so unbelievably irritating!

I was truly looking forward to seeing this documentary as I grew up during the ""slasher n stalker"" craze and saw many of them in the theatre...for considerably less than what I paid for this DVD, mind you.

2701079,3,B000LAZDOW,"Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film (Director unknown, 2006)

IMDB, thou hast failed me! I neglected to note the name of the director of this doco when I watched it, and it's not listed at IMDb. Mea culpa. Sorry. On with the show.

Going to Pieces is great, great, great, if you're a slasher film neophyte who wants to get interested in the genre. Now, this is not necessarily a nonexistent niche market, especially with so many youngsters who have been attracted to the genre with newer variations on it (Final Destination being the obvious example), all of whom were not yet born, or in diapers, when most of the films noted here were made. (I was only six, myself, when Black Christmas, the first true North American slasher flick, hit theaters in 1974.)  The problem is, the rest of us who would normally be attracted to it have seen all the movies, and know all the backstories. If you're an established fan, most of the stuff you get from Tom Savini, John Carpenter, etc. you'll probably have gotten from other documentaries from the subject, if not from your obsessive Fangoria reading when you were a teenager. That said, it does provide an interesting trip down memory lane to some flicks you might have forgotten about (Pieces and Prom Night are definitely in that category for me, I'll have to watch them again soon). A lot of great clips, a lot of fun (and, a warning, a lot of spoilers). Could have had more original substance, though. ** ",1189987200,8,1471,4.581749049429658
2701080,3,B000LAZDOW,"Being a fan of horror movies, slasher films included, I popped in GOING TO PIECES: THE RISE & FALL OF THE SLASHER FILM one night in the hopes of getting a comprehensive view of one of my fave sub-genres. Stupid teenagers and boogeymen, here I come!

The result? A full 45 minute genre romp through the years 1979-1981, and then another 45 minutes spent on everything else. A tad unbalanced.

Focusing on the birth of the slasher film, the directors hone in on the Granddaddy and Golden Child of all slasher flicks: PSYCHO and HALLOWEEN, respectively. Then they use HALLOWEEN as a launching pad to review the glut of slasher flicks that followed its release, unloading a torrent of obscure titles that you've probably forgotten about. Factor in copious interviews with the original directors and other knowledgeable horror critics, and the first half of GOING TO PIECES is a real treat for the hardcore genre fan.

The movie's biggest flaw? They don't dedicate nearly enough time to the flicks that followed the original boom of the early `80's. The deepest we get after 1981 is an analysis of ELM STREET and how it revitalized the genre. They touch on SCREAM and SAW at one point, but otherwise it's pretty anemic. Perhaps if they had trimmed down some of the interviews they could have dedicated more time to 1982-2006.

Needless to say, when the film concluded I was hungry for more documentary on the other titles in the slasher library. Thus, I'd recommend GOING TO PIECES for what it's worth: An excellent trip down memory lane to the years 1979-1981. The first half is sirloin steak. Just be prepared for the fluffy cotton candy of the second half.",1179792000,3,1654,4.7526132404181185

I mean, not only did I not see this particular slasher film, I do not remember hearing anything about it let alone the fact that it is clearly an antecedent to ""The Crying Game.""  I am not even sure if I have even heard of that particular film before, although titles like ""Sleepaway Camp,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slumber-Party-Massacre/dp/6305976414/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slumber Party Massacre</a>,"" and others tend to meld together in your mind over the years.  But after watching ""Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film,"" I am going to have to track that puppy down, and I imagine other fans of this horror genre will also see a title or two that they have missed along the way that they will want to track down as well after watching this 2006 documentary.

The documentary is based on Adam Rockoff's book, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Going-to-Pieces-The-Rise-and-Fall-of-the-Slasher-Film-1978-to-1986/dp/0786412275/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, 1978 to 1986</a>,"" and while that particular time frame is not explicitly mentioned in the film version it explains why it essentially begins with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween/dp/6305546789/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween</a>"" and ends with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/April-Fool-s-Day/dp/B000069I05/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">April Fool's Day</a>.""  At the start we go back to the birth of the Grand Guignol theatre and how a pair of 1960s films, Michael Powell's ""Peeping Tom"" and Alfred Hitchock's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Psycho/dp/0783225849/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Psycho</a>"" laid the foundation for the slasher film.  But there is no effort to connect the dots until John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" bursts on the scene 18 years later and it was not until I saw the book's title that I felt better about this gap.  The same thing applies at the end, when the rebirth of the genre with ""Silence of the Lambs"" giving horror a new sense of legitimacy in the movies and the success of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scream/dp/630521610X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scream</a>"" quickly turning to the extremely violent but commercially successful films like ""Hostel,"" ""Saw,"" and ""Wolf's Creek.""  Again, there the link is not established from the past to the present either, which is why the true scope of this documentary is all about the glory days of the slasher films (the name just does not make sense in describing the current crop of ultra-horror films).

The fun here are the clips of memorable moments from these films, with attention being paid to not only obvious biggies like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th/dp/B00001MXXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th</a>"" but also one of my personal favorites in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Bloody-Valentine/dp/B000069I04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Bloody Valentine</a>,"" the controversial ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silent-Night-Deadly-Night/dp/B0000AYLJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silent Night Deadly Night</a>,"" and pretty much anything they could get a clip from to show, which is not everything, but most of the movies that come to mind for this genre and several that do not.  In terms of the talking heads you will find that in addition to big name directors like Carpenter and Wes Craven there are also lesser names such as Amy Holden-Jones (""Slumber Party Massacre"") and current hot shots like Rob Zombie (I recognize more of the movies than I did the directors).  Makeup and special effects guru Tom Savini shows up a lot as a talking head and actress Betsy Palmer relishes her notoriety as Mrs. Vorhees, but one of my favorites ended up being Jeff Katz, the director of development at New Line Cinema, who talks about these films while walking through an alley somewhere (I thought for sure he was Rockoff).  Memories trump analysis, but there is a nice argument made for how Jamie Leigh Curtis was pivotal to the success of ""Halloween"" that jump started the genre, a look at how the slasher flick formula developed and then ossified, and the strange way in which the promotion of the tongue-in-cheek ""April Fool's Day"" put the genre into hibernation for a decade.

Overall, ""Going to Pieces"" is not a comprehensive documentary on the subject and I have no doubt fans will find a lot more information in Rockoff's book.  But the book does not have the movie clips that this documentary can offer and the net result is more than a nostalgic walk down memory lane (Remember when Michael Myers was the first villain to keep getting up?  Remember the last time you saw a horror film where that did NOT happen?).  Just have one of your favorite slasher flicks from this period on hand to watch afterwards, because ""Going to Pieces"" is just going to whet your appetite and it will take a while to get your hands on the films covered here that you have never seen.  For extras on the DVD there are some more interviews with the likes of Stan Winston and a trailer for the documentary.  Adam Rockoff includes a ""message,"" but you have to read it.  There are a pair of Slasher film trivia games, regular and advanced, that should prove rather challenging (You should already know ""How many couselors and campers did Jason kill in 'Friday the 13th',"" but can you handle it when they ask the same question about his mom?).",1177718400,3,5925,5.974025974025974
