I now get a picture of the proud Spanish culture and history.  It is a superior production through and through. The natural acting draws in the viewer immediately. The cast is the perfect blend of personalities that make for an interesting viewing experience. The production values and story-lines are unpredictable, thoughtful, cool, and interesting. This series is entertaining for those who like that sort of thing and intellectual for those of us who go that route. It is one of the best programs I have ever seen in this genre and I am over 60. Make sure the work is subtitled if you do not speak Spanish. Get some Spanish wine and enjoy the show. It's a good production to take you away from life right now and get lost in Spanish history. I would like to visit Spain now and see the history represented in this production... yep it's just that good.",1522972800,2,989,4.5251396648044695
8760574,1,B01FBR0628,"As usual one sided story when it comes to expose the truth. It could be good to pay history a tribute by
incorporating to these series the atrocities commtited by the Reds on men like Ramiro de Maetzu, Jos A. Primo
de Rivera, Ramiro Ledesma Ramos, Onsimo Redondo  and hundreds more, who opposed the surrender of the Republic to Stalin's Russia,
But crypto communism domains in the Spanish courts of these days.",1510185600,,410,4.694444444444445
