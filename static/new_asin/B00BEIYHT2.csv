5584819,4,B00BEIYHT2,"This is a great, action-packed movie.  My heart started pounding 5 minutes into the movie and continued through-out the next 1.5 hours.  Sure, some of scenes may be unbelievable -- in reality one man couldn't have taken care of the situation, but it sure made for a good movie. Some of the language was R-rated for children.  The audience in the movie theater was clapping when it was over. Melissa Leo as Secretary of Defense portrayed a tough American woman -- I knew a woman wouldn't break unless ordered to.  I will definitely buy it for my collection when it is released in DVD.",1363996800,13,583,4.576923076923077

5584821,4,B00BEIYHT2,"If you went into this movie expecting a Oscar type performance, then that is on you. This movie is pure escapism, and if you take it in as that you will be pleased. Is it full of ideas from a plethora of other action movies....sure. Hollywood has run out of ideas, this movie is like you took the following movies / shows, put them in a blender, this would be the result...West Wing, 24, Independence Day, Die Hard. All that said, I found it too be worth the trip, my only wish is that it would have been available in Imax. I just wish that Banning would have had a partner in his romp thru the White House, it was just a little to ""Jack Bauer"" esqe.",1363910400,7,650,4.125984251968504

5584958,5,B00BEIYHT2,"I hunkered down to watch this on TV while a Nor'easter raged outside. Well, I found myself riveted to the screen. I was engaged with the film from the very beginning. It boasts a great cast, and they delivered. The storyline was engaging from the get go. A heart wrenching death after a rescue goes awry, an unfairly tarnished secret service agent, whose career is in a tailspin, and a terrorist attack on one of our most revered institutions all serve to keep the viewer fully engaged. I was entertained and on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.

While the special effects are spectacular, as with all action movies, and there is plenty of action here,  the viewer needs to suspend disbelief. If one does so, one will be royally entertained. There is a great deal of carnage, and our terrorist is pretty wily, but the film's hero, played with equal amounts of charming vulnerability and bravado by the hunky  Gerald Butler, is the star of this show, though Morgan Freeman certainly gives him a run for his money, as does the chunky Rick Yune, who plays the terrorist mastermind.

So kick back, relax, and watch this film. It will definitely keep you riveted and on the edge of your seat. I loved it!",1519948800,,1208,4.552995391705069

Secondly, you don't turn the fleet, nor prep for evac of our troops in S.Korea ... You call up all guard and reserve forces, place ALL active duty commands on DEFCON 4 status.  Contact China & Russia, and advise 'em if they want a piece of the action we'll be more than happy to oblige.  Advise N.Korea to withdraw all their forces from the border of the DMZ, and give them 48 hours to comply.  Comply or not, next step is to turn N.Korea in to a charcoal briquet (ie: NUKE 'EM TO HELL!).

5585126,3,B00BEIYHT2,"This movie is interesting and gives us an interesting (albeit not very convincing) premise that well-tested and top-notch American protocol fails when military aircraft are hijacked and enemy soldiers infiltrate the civilian populace. For one thing, it does not explain (SPOILERS AHEAD) how the Koreans acquired a US Air Force AC-130, which apparently has infinite chaff and flare, is able to avoid eight anti-aircraft missiles fired in quick succession, and single handedly take out all the external personnel guarding the White House. Not only that, it seems that Washington DC airspace is only defended by a single SAM site and a handful of F-22s, even though Joint Base Andrews is a mere minutes away and is home to two different US Air Force fighter wings. It takes hours for the US Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, Secret Service, and law enforcement to respond to a threat that is literally composed of less than 30 North Koreans in the middle of DC, assaulting the White House. Like I said, the movie isn't very convincing and is realistically implausible and very over the top, almost to the point where it feels like I am watching a video game play out, but it's pretty cool to watch and I'd say I enjoyed it for the action/explosions/guns aspect. I'd give it a 7/10 but Amazon only gives me out of five.",1514160000,,1312,4.784140969162996

5586341,2,B00BEIYHT2,"Since when is the life of our president, or anyone else for that matter, worth more than America itself? If the terrorists kill our president, we'll all boo-hoo the moment, then we'd go elect another. Big deal.

In Olympus Has Fallen, Asian terrorists were unknowingly invited to the White House. When the attack began outside on the lawn, the American president and his secret service, against protocol, brought his guests into the president's underground safety bunker. That's exactly where the Asian terrorists wanted to be. Oh, brother! Our government, national security and military looked like a bunch of clueless buffoons who were outmaneuvered, outgunned and outwitted at every turn. The standing president (Freeman) is faced with obeying terrorist demands which will save the president's life, but sign America's death warrant. Pah-leeze! This movie rates a zero on the believable scale. I give it two-stars for the acting.

If you love violence and high-tech weapons that rip people apart and splatter blood and gore all over the place, this movie is for you. It's all action, brutality and tension. Unfortunately the plot is as old as dust... so if you enjoy a plausible story line, as I do, avoid this movie. I give it two stars because of the decent acting.",1482364800,,1270,5.042857142857143

5586583,4,B00BEIYHT2,"*Writing as the husband, refer to profile photo*

Things I've observed from the movie ""Olympus Has Fallen"":

1. this is within the variant of Die Hard, seriously.
2. As to #1, this is why this movie series will have at least 4 made films, because Hollywood.
3. If you totally loved this movie and its sequel, London Has Fallen, there's a chance you may have voted for Trump.

Now with that said, as homage to the classic 1980s ""shoot em up"" with a dash of Michael Bay (but less lens flare and and swooped in angle shots), this is actually quite exciting for a movie. Far fetched, but exciting.

I had actually watched this movie at the request of my wife (Chinese, naturalized US citizen) who wanted to bring the family together (my parents et al.) for a classic bonding of popcorn drinks, and a cozy fireplace. Towards the end of the movie, an immediate family of mine who shall remain anonymous, but the pseudonym shall be ""dad"", states ""honest question, how many of you Chinese hate America?""

Both she and I rather flabbergasted, she ignored the question, but paused and stated ""There are also Americans that hate Chinese"". Talk about, ""He that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone at her""-esque moment.

And yes, this person whose pseudonym is ""dad"", voted for Trump. This is why we can't have nice things in the house and live on the other side of the U.S., except for those blurred holiday moments.",1480118400,,1423,4.582677165354331
5586584,4,B00BEIYHT2,"I saw this movie when it came out and decided to purchase the DVD recently for a plane trip I was going to take.  I forgot how great this action movie is and if you are a Gerard Butler fan, this does not disappoint. I think one of the best overall themes of the movie is the action and how great it is that Gerard's character does not waste time talking to his targets before her terminates them. More realistic given the fast pace action and his character's skill set. Of course, there was another movie that is very similar and even takes place at the White House, but this is much better in my opinion.  Worth the DVD price to own and watch repeatedly.",1480118400,3,655,4.232

I don't get why he told the bad guy that he's coming for him and that he should use the last bullet for himself instead of having a knife plunged in his head. He should've just shut the communication down and just got on with going after him.
I enjoyed the brief scenes with Ashley Judd and Aaron Eckart. Aaron brought humanity to the president. The kid that plays the son, Sparkplug, was a delight.
I enjoyed it because although it's implausible, I hope, I was engaged in the overall story.

5588434,5,B00BEIYHT2,"Let me begin by saying that the entire premise of this film is ridiculous because surely the Secret Service is a hell of a lot better prepared to defend the White House against an attack than demonstrated in the film.  And why were there no female agents that I could see?  Just lots of silly dudes in black suits all lining up to get killed instead of fighting inside the WH commando style.  That being said, the film is non-stop, edge of your seat action, and my poor a-fib afflicted heart was racing during the entire film. I have been utterly in love with Gerard Butler ever since ""Phantom of the Opera"" (S-E-X-Y!!!!!), and enjoyed his engaging mix of tenderness and savagery in this film.  He does it SO well.  So if you want to see a rip-roaring good action-packed film that will keep you rooting for the good guys and wishing you could personally smash the bad-ass villain in his face right through your screen, then this is the film for you.  If you want reality, skip this movie.  If you want to watch the hunky Butler in action, just turn the sound off and enjoy.",1468800000,3,1073,4.416243654822335

5588788,2,B00BEIYHT2,"Olympus Has Fallen is one of the worst movies ever.
The story is only possible if a multitude of idiotic screw ups ALL occur.
1. Unidentified aircraft cruises into DC w/o ID and early prevention.
2. Unidentified aircraft opens fire, likely without sophisticated aiming systems, and takes down 2 fighter planes within seconds.
3. Unidentified aircraft opens fire, likely without sophisticated aiming systems, and pretty much takes out the whole security team on the roof.
4. A huge crew of terrorists 1) get pass customs, 2) none get picked up by CIA/FBI/NSA or what have you, 3) get access to heavy artillery w/o being caught by aforementioned agencies, 4) modify vehicles without notice near DC.
5. After the aircraft guns down the units on top, the large crew of terrorists with heavy artillery guns down the remaining armed forces in the White House who 1) have no heavy artillery, and 2) keep coming out like idiots to be gunned down.
6. POTUS asks his security team to allow not one but all members of the foreign entourage to enter the bunker with him, and no officer on the security team suspects there could foul play and rejects the order while an incursion of unknown nature takes place.
7. Acting president negotiates with terrorists instead of obliterating the whole White House to secure the Cerberus.
8. Acting president negotiates with terrorists and tells troops and fleets near DMZ to pull out, risking the security of the Pacific Rim for a few people that cannot perform their duties and can be replaced. I mean considering the severity of the situation, why would anyone in charge do such a thing?
9. Army general sends in SEAL when told a next gen weapon is deployed against his team.
10. Army general asks only agent in the situation to get out, risking all intel and operatives on premise. Wait, maybe this general is a spy?
11. POTUS orders subordinates to give out critical codes that could not only jeopardize the defense system of the United States but contaminate US soil via nuclear explosion. And NO ONE except the terrorists realized this idea. WOW!
12. Army allows unidentified group of people (cause they were all masked) to board a chopper W/O IDing any one of them.
13. Near ending, when former super hero agent and POTUS kill all terrorists and have contact with outside via satellite phone walks out, NO ONE rushes into the White House to save them. All this idiocy for a dramatic scene.
OK, the action is reasonable. THE MOVIE IS STUPID.

Nothing in the movie is even remotely possible. The movie is quite silly and insulting at the same time. Just say no to this movie. This movie insults our government, military, and police and Americans as a whole making everyone looking incompetant and brainless without any guts to stand up to aggression. I would hate to think of someone from another country watching this and saying, ""Are the Americans really that stupid?"".  Its a movie that tried to make u want to run out and join the special forces,secret service, green berets and whatever and save the world single handidly just like Gerard ""Die Hard"" Butler did. Instead it makes u feel like u just wasted your hard earned money on a bad anti North Korea propaganda show from CNN.

5589419,1,B00BEIYHT2,"I know logic is supposed to go out the window in a movie like this, but this one really strains credibility.  Apparently many (a thousand?  two thousand?) well-armed terrorists are waiting in London for the right moment to strike at the command of a arms dealer whose family was killed in a U.S. attack (at least I think that is what went on).  When the U.S. goes to London to attend the funeral of the British P.M., they strike.

Somehow the terrorists know enough about the President's movements, even when he's trying to escape after the multiple attacks begin.  It's always seems strange that the terrorists know enough to always be in striking distance, even though they are never even to kill him, even though only one of his bodyguards is with him.  I know terrorists with virtual magic powers are a regular part of these movies, but it gets tiresome.  I suppose 12-year-old boys will enjoy this movie.  I might have even enjoyed it when I was 12.  But it's a terrible movie.",1463184000,,982,4.597701149425287

5590177,5,B00BEIYHT2,"Rated R for blowing stuff up and a few people getting shot in the head. I much prefer this sort of R versus the flicks with nonstop cussing and sex at every turn.

This is a classic action movie.  Good script, great actors and actresses and great acting.  If you like the 80s action movies with today's CGI then grab the popcorn and prepare for a treat.",1458086400,,353,4.2388059701492535

5590296,4,B00BEIYHT2,Butler plays a Treasury agent banned to desk work after being kicked off the president's Secret Service detail.  While at his desk he witnesses an air attack on the White House and rushes there to try to help.  The president and others are held hostage in a bunker under the White House after all the guards are killed.  Butler is the only one left that has a chance to save the president and goes up against 30 bad guys.  There were no surprises for me as this type of story has been told many times but I still enjoyed the movie.  This one definitely isn't for the kiddies as there is almost nonstop graphic shootings and strong language.,1458000000,3,640,4.389830508474576

5590948,5,B00BEIYHT2,"Because London Has Fallen (the sequel) is coming out on March 4th, I re-watched the DVD of Olympus Has Fallen.  My opinion that it was a Five-Star film of pure entertainment held true.  I saw this movie and White House is Down at the theater when both films came out in 2013.

Everyone has their favorite of the two films.  Mine, of course, is Olympus Has Fallen, and I'll tell you why.

The first reason is Ashley Judd, who has a very short role in the beginning as the President's wife.  She is so talented and beautiful in those first ten minutes that you literally fall in love with her yourself and understand why everything else follows.  When she plays a short, supporting role, Ashley conveys a certain magic on screen that is utterly captivating

The second treason is Gerard Butler who somehow manages to steal every movie he's in.  Butler is the perfect ""every man"".  He's able to project humor, drama, and action without any effort.  He's also the type of actor that most men would like to have as a friend, while the ladies find themselves attracted to him for other reasons.  He certainly sold me on being a Secret Service agent, who just happened to be ex-Special Forces.  The fight scenes are showcased with great aplomb and display Butler's hand-to-hand combat skills to the fullest extent.  I almost expected Butler to say, ""Yippy ki ya"" to the main villain,  who's played by Rick Yune

The third reason is the rest of the main cast with Aaron Eckhart, Angela Bassatt, Morgan Freeman, Rick Yune, Raha Mitchell, and Robert Forster.  They all bring their characters to the forefront of each scene, creating a realness to their roles and helping to move the film along.

The fourth reason is Antoine Fuqua, who directed the film.  I haven't seen a movie of his that I haven't enjoyed like Training Day and Tears of the Sun to name a few.  He makes the impossible happen, and you're immediately swept up into the urgency of the situation with a roller-coaster type ride until the final scene is viewed in all of its majestic glory.

This is not only a film worth seeing, but you will want to own it as well.

Now, if only London Has Fallen is half as good as this one, I'll be a happy camper.",1456704000,5,2206,4.517676767676767

5591025,5,B00BEIYHT2,One of the better terrorist movies. I have no idea why they keep showing White House Down on the pay channels instead of this. I had to buy the movie just to show my family. After the few moments of necessary set up and beginning drama the action just keeps on going all the way to the end. It's all so realistic with how it begins it's actually kind of scary. Props to the actors and writers for keeping it entertaining. It's not perfect but I felt this movie is much more watchable than White House Down. (Side note: I'm only comparing because both movies came out at the same time but for some reason this is the one that's harder to find? Even the critics thought it was better. /shrug/),1455926400,,691,4.282442748091603

It still requires the viewer to suspend disbelief to enjoy but not to the extent that many action films do (unless you work for the Secret Service and the movie is too absurd to watch).  What they got right was just how screwed the Secret Service, military, and law enforcement would be if bad guys assaulted the White House with hundreds of attackers and a massive arsenal of modern weapons.  I would not want to work in any of the local hospitals after an AC-130 gunship expended all it's ordinance over DC.

I'm a Gerard Butler fan and really enjoyed how he took care of the entire situation.  This was very similar to White House Down in the fact that apparently there is more than one way to take possession of the White House.  This movie was an exciting ride and included a system that could destroy all of our nuclear warheads in their silos (which I hope is not really possible).

5591807,4,B00BEIYHT2,"This movie is straight up non-stop action! I'm not kidding every other scene in this film is an action scene, but that's not bad considering that terrorists taking over the White House and Gerard Butler has to stop them is the entire premise of the film.

Gerard Butler carries his character really good as the hero of what he does. Kill the bad guys in the White House, and I won't give away the details here. With Morgan Freeman and a cast of other characters playing important roles this is non-stop, gritty and grueling man movie.

5591906,3,B00BEIYHT2,"Barely worth 3 stars.  Pretty formulaic.  Nothing new.  An absolute ton of graphic violence.  About 500 uses of the F word and/or variations of same.  Ridiculous weapons and tactics technology employed by the bad guys including but not limited to a huge US military gun system installed inside the White House on an elevator that ran to the roof!  How they ever got that in there is a total mystery.  Morgan Freeman has just an inch or two shy of a cameo appearance to get a name brand actor in the cast.  Last, the US military guys involved are pretty much made to look incompetent or worse.  With just a little effort you should be able to find much better movies to watch that this one.",1443398400,4,689,4.404761904761905

5592738,5,B00BEIYHT2,"I purchased this movie some time ago and I LIKE IT!  It is an action movie that is not of the usual type that is being put out at this time.  I don't believe that I'm even putting out a REAL SPOILER ALERT if I mention that the White House - The President - and good acting with good action are involved.  The action is bloody but it is realistic too.  While I don't think I would bring my young kids/children to the movie, I did like the storyline anyway.  I love Morgan Freeman more now too.

Also, if you want to see another movie that involves the same story elements as this one - I would suggest the movie ""WhiteHouseDown"".  And the description could be the same.  In fact I'm going save some time and copy the text to that review too!  What a cheat!",1432166400,,755,4.116438356164384

From there: Cheesy in many ways, the 'satellite' images are just want people have said - Google Images.  CGI in almost every scene in opening 20-30 minutes.  Also the North Korean/Korean Terrorists is OK, but when the current events (last 30 years) of the rise of Islamic Terrorists - it would have been more plausible if it were not N Korean.

Disgraced former Presidential guard Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) finds himself trapped inside the White House in the wake of a terrorist attack; using his inside knowledge, Banning works with national security to rescue the President (Aaron Eckhart) from his kidnappers.

What did I think?

This is what Die Hard 5 SHOULD have been. In fact, they even steal a few scenes from the original Die Hard pretty unashamedly. Which is apt as really this is basically a big-budget version of an 80s action flick. Silly, flimsy at bits, predictable and with a few plot holes, it would be easy to bag the film but to be quite honest its just a lot of unpretentious fun.",1429401600,,675,4.703389830508475

5593134,5,B00BEIYHT2,"The reason this is such a terrific action movie and a lot of fun to watch is GERARD BUTLER.  He has this incredible ability to totally dissolve himself into whatever character he plays on screen.  Here, he is a one-man army and it is so much fun watching him take down his opponents one-by-one with such lethal force.  He is terrifyingly competent as Mike Banning.  HE doesn't just make threats -- he follows through on them.  I LOVED  the ""interrogation"" sequence between him and his two captured terrorists -- laughing with them right up to the point where he kills them.  (NOTE TO SELF:  BE SURE TO SPEAK ENGLISH AROUND MIKE BANNING!!!  SAVE YOURSELF SOME PAIN -- LOL)!  My favorite scenes, however, were his fatherly interactions with the President's young son -- especially where he ""coaches"" him on how to climb up this chimney-like enclosure in the White House.  It was very tender and endearing to watch him give the young lad his Secret Service badge before sending him on his way.

I also love Morgan Freeman and Aaron Eckhart, and if their performances seem lackluster here, I'm afraid it is the fault of the writers who gave them so little to work with.  These two powerhouse actors were grossly underused in their roles here and given little opportunity to shine.  They definitely deserved better.  Rick Yune makes for a very good, believable  opponent for Gerard Butler, but . . . lets be honest here -- you put those two in a room together to fight it out to the death and you KNOW Gerard Butler is going to be the last man standing.

From beginning to end, this is one of the best action movies EVER -- IF . .  you can suspend logic and reason.  For instance, why give three people different cerberus codes, if the President can just order people to give up their codes.  It kinda' defeats the purpose.  Secondly, what kind of wimpy naval commander WOULD EVER give up his code to a terrorist.  Thirdly, how is it possible that NO ONE figured out till ""after the fact"" that the incomplete entering of all three codes could be used to cause a nationwide nuclear holocaust in our own country???  It defies logic.  Still . . .

The whole movie is a winning non-stop thrill ride.  Buy the movie and get on board the adrenaline train!",1423785600,4,2244,4.5475

Even though it's piled up with clich after clich, it still blasts its way throughout with much heart and soul attached! Typical action cast supported with witty dialogue we've all heard many times before.....""OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN"" is just an outstanding popcorn/action film for mature audiences!

5593304,3,B00BEIYHT2,"When the White House,known as a Secret Service Code: ""Olympus"" in the movie, is captured by a terrorist mastermind and the President is kidnapped, disgraced former Presidential guard Mike Banning finds himself trapped within the building. As U.S. national security team scrambles to respond, they are forced to rely on Banning's inside knowledge to help retake the White House, save the President and avert an even bigger crisis. After the events, the U.S. begins to heal from the attack, and Banning once again becomes head of the Presidential Detail.

The movie has impressive special effects and action scenes that includes knocking off the top of the Washington Monument and blowing up one of the wings of the White House. Director Fuqua has a great eye for action and stages the initial attack on the nation's capital with some breath- taking special effects. If you go in with an extremely specific set of expectations about what you want from an action thriller, it is likely to leave you satisfied. Unfortunately,it can't overcome a predictable plot and lack of interesting characters. Also,it is predictable and has plot elements assembled from other movies with the main template being Under Siege, plus the attitude from Die Hard and a blow-things-to-hell ambiance from any Michael Bay movie. And most of all,it is an action film that only strives to be as loud, violent, and patriotic as possible. Watch it if you want these types of films.",1420588800,,1452,5.024896265560166

5593311,5,B00BEIYHT2,"Everything you could ask for. Action, impossible odds, unlikely heroes. Morgan Freeman. Gerard Butler former Secret Service and President  Aaron Eckhart bring great chemistry to the mix of their not so sympatico personalities. If your boss fired you, would you be so quick to save his life? This movie must have made the Department Of Homeland Security crazy as it reveals holes in security they would never dream of. When comparing Olympus to White House Down, this film blows up more stuff but has a less personal feel to it than the latter. White House Down has a little more character appeal due mainly to outstanding performances by Jamie Foxx, Channing Tatum and Maggie Gyllenhaal so I give it the advantage, but it's only a slight one. I thought Morgan Freeman was a little under used here.",1420329600,,797,4.817518248175182

He is not a good actor, whereas Gerard Butler is a great choice for the main character. Morgan Freeman is terrific, too. The writers gave Angela Bassett some of the stupidest lines I've heard in years...""Now they have our nukes?!"" What a lame remark when the missiles will blow up in the silos....totally off the mark. I wasn't crazy about Butler's wife either....she gave a pretty mediocre performance...not very credible. On the other hand, the fight scenes were dramatic and pretty spectacular. I question whether or not the C130 machine guns could have such pinpoint accuracy on the White House roof, but, hey, that's Hollywood! All in all, I liked the movie very much.

5593594,2,B00BEIYHT2,"Spectacle: 5
Acting: 3
Story: 1

The action scenes are well done. The visuals are beautiful and devastating. The fighting science well done.

The story, though, is awful: Illogical, inconsistent, and in some places so dumb the viewer would chuckle with embarrassment.

A North Korean terrorist with no state-support is able to fly an airplane that can shoot down F15s and bring an armory that easily outdoes the American military might. A president that tells his advisors to divulge a nuclear code because he will not give his - unless they catch his kid. A coding system that can blow up the missiles even before they left their silos. A code breaking genius that surprises the Pentagon by breaking the last of 3 code like it was the 1981 ""war game"" movie. An attack by Navy seals that isn't stopped by actors that look like they read an unbelievably dumb script. A hero that's fired from the white house because of ice-on-the-road accident. Hundreds of terrorists but only one has a (bogus) motivation.

Above all, a movie that's trying to be so politically correct that they invent a terrorist that couldn't exist so that no one is offended. Ouch....",1416182400,,1154,4.78391959798995
5593595,5,B00BEIYHT2,"Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors. This movie was good and flawed at the same time. Number one, there is no way on earth the White House could be overtaken by terrorists. Number  two, the president would not have the top cabinet members with him in the bunker.

5593686,4,B00BEIYHT2,"A senerio in which this could very well happen in real life if it is not closely monitored. Olympus Has Fallen has upped the suspense factor as well as the action. With a very strong cast and crew, this movie sells it really well. Aaron Eckhart did a ""decent"" job playing the President. Personally, I think that Morgan Freeman should've been President for this film and Aaron should have been the Secretary of Treasure. Besides, Morgan has played President (President Beck in Deep Impact) before and he's just more believable as the President to me. Gerard Butler does a great job as Mike Banning and he's always played the warrior type and he brings this movie to a head by taking on the bad guys pound for pound and picks them off one by one.

5594043,2,B00BEIYHT2,"On occasion, Hollywood cranks out two such simliar movies that you wonder if market research has taken over, like a hive brain.  (Pixar and Dreamworks unleashing ""A Bug's Life"" and ""Antz"" seemingly within seconds of each other remains the gold standard.)  Hollywood thought that terrorists attacks on the White House were such an important artistic message that it cranked out ""White House Down,"" complete with the Jamie Foxx and Channing Tatum action figures, and ""Olympus Has Fallen,"" which is among the most craven exercises in bombast I've ever seen.

I want to be fair - this is not a one-star review.  A well-spoiled opening scene creates a surprising bit of tension for the First Family and their favorite pet, Secret Service Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler, a game action hero).  Following the incident in which Manning saves the life of President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart, further indication that a lot of great actors were wasted here), Manning is nevertheless demoted to a desk job with the U.S. Treasury.  The demotion is understandable, but you can hear the Good Man Will Earn Redemption plot wheels creaking mighty early.

President Asher has a nice moment with his son, Connor (Finley Jacobsen) cut short by the arrival of the South Korean Prime Minister for a diplomatic session.  The ensuing action scene provides the high-water mark for the movie.  A gunship, piloted by robotic Koreans, leads the first wave of an awesome attack on the White House.  (For any Big Brothers reading this, I am speaking solely about how the attack is portrayed on film, not that an attack on the White House is awesome.  It would be bad.)  Blasting aside U.S. fighter jets, gunmen defending the White House, and random tourists, the gunship is truly terrifying before it finally brought down on the South Lawn, decaptiating the Washington Monument in the process.

President Asher and the other VIPs have been whisked away to the Presidential Bunker and everyone is fine.  Incident over, right?

Wrong.  As I wrote above, this was Phase I.

Manning has run to the White House from Treasury to protect the place and arrives in time to see two Koreans dressed as civilians move ominously toward the White House fence.  He blasts one, but the other blows himself up, blasting a hole in the fence in the process.  Another wave of Korean terrorists stream onto the White House grounds, blowing away the outmanned Secret Service (and in the process capitalizing on the relaxed culture of ""conceal and carry"" gun laws so adored by Republcans - I'm just saying there are counterarguments).

Within minutes, the terrorists have seized the White House and, thanks to a scummy bit of turn-coatery, the Bunker.  Terrorist demands ensue, basically dictating that the U.S. turn its back on its commitment in Asia and opening the door to World War III

Agent Manning gets involved (turns out he's John Rambo's slightly-less efficient little brother) and becomes an avenging angel of American justice.  He wins, and so do we.

Words cannot describe how, excluding the virtuoso attack scene, this is a paint-by-numbers affair that squanders talent.  Morgan Freeman has never looked more ill-used as a timid (timid!  Morgan Freeman is not timid!) Speaker of the House.  His high-water mark occurs when he orders coffee - but leading the country, not so much.  Angela Basset looks great (of course) and sounds like the steely woman you want to see in a crisis, but she basically gets to spout Manning's resume and listen to his updates on the phone.  Dylan McDermott has some nice moments, but his character's motivation make no sense.  Melissa Leo of ""Treme"" fame gets to chew the scenery a bit, but her character's fate surprises nobody.

Our villains invoke a plot with a stereotypical doomsday clock scenario that allows the ticking of an inanimate object to provide the tension that the script fails to deliver.  Should the terrorists succeed in their effort, the consequences would be so dire that the real movie would be about the aftermath, not the event itself.  Plus, this is a Hollywood Rock-em-Sock-em summer movie - the terrorists won't win.  The question is how much collateral damage they will inflict and to whom.

Perhaps the most aggravating aspect of the movie is its borderline-racist treatment of the Korean terrorists.  Please understand me - I DO NOT CRY 'RACISM' AT MOVIES!  I DEFENDED JAR JAR BINKS WHEN HE WAS CALLED AN INTERGALACTIC BUTTERFLY MCQUEEN!  But ""OHF"" treats the Korean terrorists as having the emotional range of spiders.  Americans fighting for the flag shout, scream, and . . . communicate.  The Koreans are denied the humanity of communication. Take the two Korean pilots who fly the initial attack - they do not say a word, not when attacking, not when under attack, NOT EVEN WHEN FLYING UPSIDE DOWN INTO THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN!!!  They accept their fate with stoic silence.  This is the same for virtually all the terrorists.  The lead terrorist, Kang (Rick Yune) manages to look steely, smug and angry all at once, and his dialogue is so manipulatively villainous that Snidely Whiplash would be impressed.

I like the choice of Koreans as villains - it's a nice break from using the British or the Germans as safe stand-ins - but give these bad guys something to do.  When director Antoine Fuqua watched ""Die Hard"" to prep for this movie, he should have noticed the small but very effective moments even the most minor villains had.  Our Korean friends deserved better villainy.",1407715200,,5508,4.9380434782608695

5594281,4,B00BEIYHT2,"Gerard Butler is an ex CIA agent who happens to be near the White House when terrorists take it over. Its up to him to save the day. Its Die Hard in the White House pretty much and Butler is just as bad ass as Bruce Willis and almost as funny. Its incredibly violent and over the top and just completely ridiculous. None of this would ever happen. Like, they would never take the president to the same bunker as guests from other countries. Those people would go to a different safe room. Still, as unbelievable as the plot is, it sure was a fun movie. It was a roller-coaster ride from beginning to end. Aaron Eckert plays the president and he is pretty tough too. If fact everyone is tough in it, even the female secretary of state who really takes a beating from the terrorists. A lot of people take a good beating on both sides. The White House takes a good beating too. Good beatings all around! You may be surprised by a few twists and details in this, but the general story is pretty easy to predict and follow. I don't think that will get in the way of enjoying it. Just turn your brain off and enjoy the ride.",1404345600,,1118,4.228971962616822

I thought Gerard Butler was totally badass.  The president was cool too!  The special effects were great and the bad guys WERE NOT STUPID.  Everyone did some good acting and kicked butt.  I also saw White House Down.  This was such a better take on the White House hostage movie genre.  Olympus was a serious movie and it was seriously a lot of fun!",1402444800,10,496,4.362637362637362
5594396,4,B00BEIYHT2,"I enjoy action movies like this. This movie at the beginning had me wandering how some of these mistakes were made and if it were really possible, but after putting possible plot holes out of my mind, it was actually and average to good movie.",1402272000,,243,4.4222222222222225
5594397,3,B00BEIYHT2,I was hesitant to get a movie that was so unreal and especially with another movie (white house down) coming out the same year. Have no worries this is a very entertaining movie and escape from realism and MUCH better than White House down (saw on starz).,1402185600,2,255,4.446808510638298
5594398,1,B00BEIYHT2,"OK, I say this as a lifelong devotee of '70s/'80s slasher flicks (and I saw them first-run, and collect them to this day), and veteran watcher of hundreds of action thrillers:  This movie is the first in my lifetime that ever literally turned my stomach due to its gore and violence.  I was near to retching and had to turn it off.

Which is a shame, because the plot and acting are no worse than typical films of this genre and it could've been an entertaining Sunday afternoon flick.  Don't bother.  The violence and human agony & suffering are nearly pornographic in nature; I clicked it off thinking the actors and the writers/director should be ashamed of themselves.

The same scenes could've been portrayed in a much more nuanced, much less nauseating way -- how many people do we need to see begging for their lives before being shot execution style before their friends, or brutally kicked to death with coworkers watching?  Even the repetitive bursts of gunfire in the first and seemingly interminable big eruption of violence were viscerally disturbing and not in a good way.  That's not storytelling, that's beating people over the head with mindless special effects, just because you can.

I really can't imagine what sort of brain -- or lack therof -- this movie appeals to.",1402185600,4,1288,4.791855203619909
5594399,5,B00BEIYHT2,I think this is a excellent movie.  It has non stop action and Gearard Butler does a great job portraying his role  and is very believable!!  Also Freeman and Eckhart are great in the roles they played.  It is a compelling movie and I would recommend it.,1402099200,2,254,4.340425531914893

5594401,1,B00BEIYHT2,"I guess there  are some folks around who really like this sort of stuff, or at least find in it an amusing ""escapism.""  IMHO, it's nothing but unbridled terror from end to end.  The early scenes, up to and including the limo accident, have no importance in the scheme of things.  Eventually, it is somehow important for the President and his aides to meet with some big guys from North Korea.  During their first ""sitdown,"" all hell breaks loose in a sort of ""War of the Worlds"" scenario with an attack on the White House.  This is devastating, as it becomes clear that our guys are losing.  ...but what's the point of all this?  We DON'T KNOW !!  It's just that the nastiest people on earth have decided to get angry and even the score. .......The remainder of this film is outrageous, contrived action to accommodate the antics of one man, supported by a helpless governing group, who battles against at least a platoon of ""highly trained and well armed"" bandits.  It's all quite absurd.  Sadly, it has become the sort of mindless terror which is absorbing for many of our children.  MINDLESS TRASH !",1401926400,10,1102,4.5948717948717945

I like the gatling guns in the cargo plane scene; most people I know thought that was impossible fantasy. Try searching the web and you'll find it's real.

5594468,4,B00BEIYHT2,"I used Olympus Has Fallen in a history class to show how the chain of command of our government works.  As a story, this is something a little different than most and that makes it interesting.

Originally I had no burning desire to watch this movie but when I was told about how the various cabinet members were interwoven in the storyline, I became intrigued enough to show it to my 11th grade students.  The language is a bit more than one might hope for a school movie, but because of the side stories and chain of command issues, the pros outweighed the cons.

As a story, it was better than I had either anticipated or hoped.",1400112000,,631,4.367521367521367

The good guy is a super good guy and he wins in the end.  He has a foul mouth and a healthy disrespect for the powers that be and you absolutely love him for it. It's quite bloody but the special effects are great and Gerard Butler is his usual charming and disarming self.  Melissa Leo is in-your-face defiant.  It's not only the men of Olympus who are brave.  Rick Yune (the villain) is so convincing that you hate him immediately. If you want a film that's exciting, entertaining and devoid of ambiguity, this is it.

5594514,4,B00BEIYHT2,"Bought this on a whim not expecting much and was pleasantly surprised.  Plot is formulaic along the lines of Die Hard (one man against a bunch of bad guys) but in this case it works great.  Special effects are good, but the sound track is demo quality if you have some serious sub woofers in your home system.  Everything that can be blown up is in rather spectacular fashion!  Definitely worth adding to your collection.",1399852800,,421,4.573333333333333
5594515,1,B00BEIYHT2,This movie has got to be the stupidest of all action films I've ever seen.  No wonder the collective national IQ drops per generation while violence increases.,1399680000,12,159,4.888888888888889
5594516,4,B00BEIYHT2,"Not a long review, and little specifics since I don't want to ruin the surprise, since half the fun of an action movie like this is the suspense of what will happen.  I love Olympus Has Fallen (hereafter ""OHF"")!  It was a lot of fun, well-thought out, simple, not full of overacting or one-liners, and seemingly-accurate enough you actually hope it is not that accurate!  It was like watching a Tom Clancy novel acted out, with how the White House gets taken over, first by a major attack then by a simultaneous series of smaller but equally effective attacks.  The initial attack reminded me of the end of Clancy's Debt of Honor on the scale of how it happens.  And once that initial attack occurs, it reminded me of 24 where the terrorists take over the White House with actual soldiers.

So, from above, you can glean that this movie, as others have pointed out, is not particularly ""original,"" and yet it at the same time has not been done specifically like this before.  And few movies are ""original"" these days anyway, and this one doesn't pretend to be.  Regardless, it is thrilling and makes your blood boil as an American when the initial attack occurs.  OHF was like from the days when Hollywood pumped out action movies, whereas these days any one of those would be a rare big-budget A-lister movie.  It was like a Steven Seagal or Die Hard flick, only on a grander scale since it is the WHITE HOUSE.

Since OHF came out around the same time as White House Down, I will say I was not nearly as much a fan of that movie.  This movie the actors are much more muted in their performances, WHD the actors you just think of as being actors.

Bottom-line: fun, straightforward, well-worth a rent, and buying depending on the price.  After having rented before, I bought it new through a 3rd party seller on here for under $10 total (after shipping), since while I really like it I don't think it is worth paying anything over $14 to keep, I would say.",1399680000,,1956,4.488700564971752

Well, I guess I should say it ""was.""  White House Down came out right after this movie was made.  Olympus Has Fallen is rated R for bloody violence and language where White House Down is just the opposite.  The stories are different in why the White House is being attacked, but if I had to choose one over the other then I would definitely go with Olympus Has Fallen because it's not a cutesie PG-13 movie like White House Down and Gerard Butler is a better actor to watch instead of Channing Tatum.",1399334400,2,644,4.565217391304348

SPOILERS...SPOILERS...SPOILERS....although morgan (speaker of the house assumes the presidency, if we should misplace our original president and vice president) is merely acting acting president, the original is such a wuss he surrenders icbm codes that are designed to either defuse them in flight ( no other way, and in reality, very likely no way at all), or detonate them here.  naturally butler saves him (and his cute, spunky boy); would have been more realistic to gun him down on sight.  i could see from light years that this was  going to be a vapid ripoff of the terrorists splitting the planet theme (which they are; you should know, you elected them), so i surrendered myself to it (library disc) sheerly for the sake of the action, which is actually quite abundant, however impossible.  butler is still doing supercommandoes as well as usual.  could  evil asians actually storm the white house?  no.  then again, even the vastly overrated al quaeda could probably have flown flown an airliner through it, while bush was.reading ""billy the goat"", instead of concentrating his attention on our laughable airport security, and defence above the skies of new york and dc.  way to GO, george!  should have been as lynched as his pretend counterpart, for pure dereliction as commander in chief; naturally, he was  instantly voted war time powers instead (that would be your legislators, again).  ciao,",1398211200,,1646,5.116104868913857

5594697,4,B00BEIYHT2,"Directed by Antoinne Fuqua, Produced by Gerard Butler/Alan Seigel/Mark Gill. Starring Gerard Butler/Aaron Eckhart/Morgan Freeman/Angela Bassett/Rick Yune. Music by Trevor Morris. Released by Film District

Storyline: US President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart), is captured by a Korean terrorist group, in vengeance of USAs deployment of its armed forces in the Korean seas. The group leader Kangs (Rick Yune), an orphan due to US military actions in South Korea, organizes his forces to take control of the White House and its defense systems to force US to withdraw its forces from Korean seas and also activate Cerebrus, a US army nuclear missile self detonating software, in order to turn the entire land of USA into a mere radioactive wasteland forever.
Kangs plot is rendered void through the brave efforts of Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), a US secret service agent and former Army Ranger. He cleverly enters the White House and eliminates all of Kangs group members and saves the President from sure death. He also successfully deactivates the self detonating timer, in the last second, only to save the entire nation from a permanent catastrophe.

Positives: An action packed movie where we get to see the latest weapons of the world in full action. The audience will be awe-struck by the sheer military power of USA and the brains behind to control the same. The great pleasure one gets in seeing the White House destroyed by some foreign terrorists, through, computer aided graphical representation of the building and its surroundings, in note worthy. One must watch this film to gauge the potential of computerized presentation of such massive structures like White House on big screen. Its really awesome to watch how one gets to feel as if the White House is really destroyed.

Negatives: Is the most protected building of the world so vulnerable to a terrorist attack, despite the latest technology available to detect surface-borne threats? Then where is the real security in this world? One among the many rescue operation movies of Hollywood, with a tinge of one man attempt to save the country, highlighted once again.

From the beginning it is one unrealistic scenario after another; a presidential motorcade driving in a blizzard crashes and kills the presidents wife, then Koreans infiltrate the White House as guests of the president and with the help of a plane with a machine gun all manage to take over the White House! WOW! How likely is that! Then they take over the Pentagon computers and threaten to destroy America and take over the world! Phew!

5594750,5,B00BEIYHT2,"Unfortunetly, this is not a film for the Academy Awards, though it's body count was on par with that of The Departed.  It's an action flick and settles comfortably into that role.  But while it was settling itself down, it became something a bit more than an action film.  I don't know what to call that, but it's not your standard action flick.  Of course, casting Morgan Freeman in your movie is rarely a mistake.  I've seen Gerad Butler in a few films and he's done a good job over the course of his career, including his performance here.  While I have trouble believing that the President of the United States would be put in half the dangerous situations he finds himself in this movie, I saw Mr. Butler genuinely wanting to see to his safety.  On that note, I am not completely sold by Aaron Eckhart's performance...he often seemed too calm for situations where a normal human being, even the President, might not be so calm.  Did I miss the scene where he got the power of super calmness...I just remember the film starting with him getting his butt kicked in a friendly boxing session with Mr. Butler (that was boxing, right?)  As for Ashley Jud, I am a big fan and feel cheated by how little she was in the film...bring her back in a flashback or something...come on!  But again, this action film does manage to go above and beyond the standard action films that are out there.  I do wonder if codenaming the White House ""Olympus"" in real life wouldn't offend people...you know, Mount Olympus and all that.  Enjoy.",1394064000,,1524,4.542124542124542

5594805,3,B00BEIYHT2,"OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN is like the TV Series 24 on some serious steroids and a BIG budget.  It also lacks compelling characters and a decent script.  But nonetheless, it has its moments and overall the moments I enjoyed slightly outweighed the dreadful.

It started poorly.  We meet the president (Aaron Eckhart) as he boxes with his #1 Secret Service guy/friend (Gerard Butler).  In one little scene, their relationship is established and we also learn that the script will feature one clich after another.  The camaraderie that feels forced.  The tough-as-nails president who can handle himself in a fight.  The toughened secret service guy with a heart of gold.  It all felt stale.  Then we meet the first lady (Ashley Judd), and the dialogue goes from bad to insipid.  Eckhart has a number of skills as an actor, but hes often struggled to be the soft, romantic type.  He struggles mightily (not helped by his stupid lines of dialogue) and Judd isn't much help.  They also have a young son (who you know right away will be in serious jeopardy soon), who happens to be great buddies with Butler.

Then the first family is shown leaving Camp David, and some events occur that I hadnt seen coming.  I expected something bad to happen, but the actual event caught me off guard, and was actually more effective that it had a right to be.  So I sat up and started paying some attention.

Soon thereafter, the White House is attacked by well-armed, well-equipped Korean terrorists and their assault on the nations home is brutal, bloody, thorough and alarming.  It features huge piles of bullet and explosive ripped bodies, terrible special effects, an ineffectual military response and results in Butler being the only good-guy left standing in the White House.  The sequence is effective in that as an American, I find the destruction of our national heritage disturbing on a gut level.  The thoroughness of the attack is relentless and awful to contemplate.  But the scene, to be honest, would have been better if some of the special effects, particularly of the aircraft used, had been better.  The initial air assault is really hard to believe, made more so by the third-rate CGI.

When the movie is a bit more down to earth, and dwells more on small fights and even some fisticuffsits more gritty and believable.  And Butler, who has struggled in one bad movie after another since 300, is actually a decent action hero.  He can toss off quips if he needs to, but the movie gives him fewwhich is good.  The film tries hard not to feel like a DIE HARD rip-offwhich is why it feels more like a 24 rip-off.

I don't want to say too much more about the plot specifics.  Most of the turns you will probably see coming (including who the traitors include), but there are a few that I didn't see coming.  Thats always nice when watching a movie like this.

On the other hand, the characters are all woe-fully underdeveloped.  Weve got some good actors given very little to do.  These kinds of films often feature politicians and military-guys in situation rooms, doing essentially nothing.  Usually we get some big names to populate these roles, earning nice paychecks for minimal effort. But for some reason, this group of Angela Bassett, Robert Forster and Morgan Freeman is particularly bland.  Yes, Morgan Freeman is BLAND.  Only once, when yelling at some flunky, does he get to shine.  What a waste!  The female characters are REALLY bland, including Bassett, Radha Mitchell, and the usually stellar Melissa Leo as the Secretary of Defense (although her last scene is a bit of a nail-biter, her CHARACTER is still a cypher).  Eckhart is pretty blandwe get no sense of what kind of president he might be.  Hes the generic president.  Oh, and notice I haven't mentioned the villains?  Id already forgotten themthey are so vague and not scary.

At the end of the film, as things are calming down, two characters walk out of the White House together.  All around them lay dead bodiesthe secret service and police who were massacred.  Blood and debris are everywhere.  Smoke billows from the wreckage of the east wing.  In the foreground is the wreckage of a black hawk, which still contains its dead crew.  The two characters look at each other and survey their surroundings.  And then they make a joke.  It was offensively inappropriate, and it belonged in a different movie.  This is not a very jokey movie.  (See WHITE HOUSE DOWN for that.)  It plays mostly with a straight face, and its violence is very R rated.  I tell you all this, not so much to share my outrage at the insensitivity of this scenebut so you understand that the film is playing this story straight.  The plot is outrageous, and requires a significant amount of incompetence on the part of American law-enforcement and the military to buybut the film does at least have enough ambition to try to horrify us with contemplating what an event like this might mean.  Thus, I give the film 3 full starsrather than the 2 or 2.5 it might have received otherwise.",1393632000,,5021,4.728950403690888

This movie started me thinking about possibilities, our government, our view of what's right and what's wrong.  You can't help be become involved with what's happening on the screen. Fear, anger, frustration, confusion, they're all there waiting for you.  Could this possible happen?

5594867,2,B00BEIYHT2,"[First off if you have any hope of this movie being any form of excellence based on that ""Training Day"" reference: DON'T!!!  ""Training Day"" was a taut and superb thriller and likening ""Olympus Has Fallen"" to ""Training Day"" is almost profane.  Now on to the review proper.]

Did I really not like this film?  I can't quite say that, and I can't quite say that it's okay either.  This film was almost painfully routine, like the screenwriter was a first timer who based his script on all of the action-adventure movies that he watched and loved as a kid only to see how many of the stale plot devices he could try to warm up (oh, look, I'm doing it too by being sexist and ascribing the script to being written by a man; let me try that again...).

This film was almost painfully routine, like the screenwriter was a first timer who based her script on all of the action-adventure movies that she watched and loved as a kid only to see how many of the stale plot devices she could try to warm up.  [Did you see what I did there?  Yeah?  Well, if you thought that was great then maybe you'll get a blast out of this movie and find it highly original versus derivative.  If you didn't like what I did then you probably get the point that I'm making about this film being hackneyed, only what I did here was more original than what you'll be watching in this film.]

Here I'm going on about this being a derivative movie.  Most movies are derivative but we don't care as long as they feel fresh or package the plot in an exciting way.  OHF fails on these accounts as well, though at least it's not totally boring as far as action movies go.  If you're a fan of seeing the plot unfold well before it unfolds, lots of fake CGI blood spatter, and explosions you still might like this movie.  The stars are certainly likable...just not so much in this movie.

The best part of this movie is when the POTUS' carpool envoy suffers an icy accident.  That moment, early on in the film was legitimately emotionally compelling, and then that was about it.",1392249600,,2040,4.354497354497354

5594871,1,B00BEIYHT2,"I found little about this film entertaining or even redemptive. Its essentially an over-top shoot-em-up flick with moments of such over-the-top violence that I began to wonder why in the world I was watching it. The plot is essentially like that of the original Die Hard film. Instead of a multi-national corporation, the victims are the White House, and the hostages include the President, the Secretary State and the Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon.

The movie parallels the original Die Hard not just in terms of plot but also in many scenes. In the original Die Hard, the baddies were Germans. In this offering they are North Koreans. The baddies infiltrate the White House using such state of the art equipment and finesse that anyone in charge of some kind of military operation would be highly envious. In about the time it takes to order a hamburger and shake from your favorite fast food restaurant, the North Koreans have brought the White House to its knees and are holding the top brass hostage. And why? They want the US's nuclear launch codes to start World War III.

Gerard Butler plays Mike Banning, a sort of John McClaine-like Secret Service Agent who just happened to be removed from the White House when all the fun begins. He then infiltrates the battered White House, moving among the Oval Office and other areas which appear like the remnants of a place long since abandoned centuries earlier. The film is mostly about him, in true John McClaine-like fashion, trying to free the hostages and doing to the baddies what was done to the White House. His contact is the Speaker of the House, played by Morgan Freeman, and other members of the government who were luckily not at the White House when it became the equivalent of a building in a Post-Apocalyptic world. In a particularly vicious scene, the Secretary of Defense, played by Mellissa Leo, is beaten to a pulp by the baddies.

Overall a horrid movie with so much gratuitous violence that some scenes I just didn't want to watch. If you like pure shoot-em-up where no less then 679 people get killed or hurt, this is certainly the film for you. The original Die Hard film certainly had violence, but it also had plot, pacing, and a certain amount of character development. There are even moments of humor. This film is humorless, character-less, and has no sense of pace or timing. Just lots and lots of violence.",1392076800,,2409,4.7173396674584325

5594943,3,B00BEIYHT2,"'Olympus Has Fallen' begins with former Special Forces and current Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gergard Butler) assigned to Presidential Detail when things go horribly wrong. He is close friends with President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart), First Lady Margaret (Ashley Judd) and their son Connor (Finley Jacobsen), which makes it all the more wrenching when a freak accident on Christmas causes the President's car to swerve off a bridge. Only the President and his son survive.  Banning's failure to save the First Lady haunts his conscience and his career.

Eighteen months later, Banning has been transferred to the Treasury Department, just a working schlub pushing papers like the rest of us. But it's a good thing he's near the White House, because during a visit by South Korean Prime Minister Lee Tae-Woo (Keong Sim), North Korea conducts an all-out assault on the White House grounds, while treasonous agents assigned to the Prime Minister attack from within. As garbage trucks laden with chain guns open fire, helicopters enter White House airspace while destroying their fighter escorts, and every failsafe fails, 'Olympus Has Fallen' gleefully just keeps upping the destruction in the hope you don't notice how ridiculous it all is.

What ensues is a series of tense standoffs as the unknown agent working behind enemy lines -- Banning -- singlehandedly takes out the bad guys while redeeming himself in the eyes of the President. He starts out with nothing but his bare hands, but slowly makes his way up the villain food chain until he's foiling a plot that could threaten the security of the entire U.S. And oh yeah, there's a gun-wielding robot called Hydra 6 that shows up on the White House roof at one point.

It's hard to be too angry at ""Olympus Has Fallen,"" because it just follows in the tradition of average Joe vs. sophisticated villains.  We've only seen poor imitations of this anti-hero since Bruce Willis' ""Die Hard"" debuted -- which are now parodied by Willis himself in later sequels.  Thing is, Willis' John McClane was only part of the formula.  You need the usual ingredients: brilliant bad guys with multi-layered schemes, bumbling authorities who are unprepared, and victims caught in the crossfire that are more important than they might at first appear.  But most importantly the film must take itself deadly seriously.  Part of the fun of ""Die Hard"" is feeling that the odds are so against McClane, despite the fact that we know he's going to succeed anyway.

Butler can't quite pull off Willis' level of rough charisma, and the film isn't willing to torture Banning more than the flashback to loss of the First Lady.  The plot is patently absurd (from the Cerberus protocols to the gunship robot, none of it makes a lick of sense), but it is executed with such relentless verve that you can't help but admire director Antoine Fuqua's enthusiasm.  That doesn't make this a good film, merely an entertaining one. If you're looking for a good old American good vs. Axis of Evil showdown, ""Olympus Has Fallen"" will do nicely.",1391299200,,3068,4.95906432748538

5595000,1,B00BEIYHT2,"Based on the ideas of the writers for this movie, Olympus (a.k.a. the White House) should have fallen long ago. Even a relatively solid director, in Antoine Fuqua, can completely miss the mark with a script like this. Although it's completely his fault for taking it.

Given a smaller budget than maybe they were expecting, the film is FILLED with B-movie computer generated effects. So limited is this movie that they couldn't afford (or were too lazy) to even pay for a car to spin out on a bridge. They had to computer generate entire sequences and it's so poor that it completely detracts from the film.

The devil's in the details and this movie misses every single detail possible. From the cheesy lines that stopped being clever in the 90's (""alpha team, back them up"") to the cliche computer controls/screens that belong in Atari video games, this film has everything you need to be insulted by it. Movies like the Dark Knight make you feel the action. If there is a car in the script that is supposed to flip, they show you a real car flipping through the air. It makes it easy for the viewer to relate because you can sense it's realism. If a scene looks fake, you are immediately taken out of the movie because you're smart and you can see that it's just CGI. When a movie misses some details like not having their actors use seemingly real military dialogue or they slip on some CGI in one spot, it's forgivable. Olympus Has Fallen trips and falls flat on it's face every single scene and it's frustrating and annoying.

Some examples:
- Radar/location tracking (like Google Maps) is a computer generated image. So when they are looking at their helicopters on their computers, why would it show the bullets. It looked like Atari. Ugh.
- So we're saying that the ONLY thing stopping the Koreans (northern and southern) from going to war is the US Military and the 7th fleet? Not the US Allies or trade embargoes or political negotiations? Koreans must feel insulted...
- An entire car spin out scene is CGI. How expensive is it to spin out a car??
- Every plane is CGI, and REALLY poorly too.
- This movie should give us a reason how the USA, especially a post 9-11 USA, would let a C130 just fly around Washington. Pretty sure that thing would be down quicker than you can say ""Boeing"".
- Where did all the air support go? They shoot down the C130 and then they were like...""well, we could take out the terrorists on the lawn with a single fly by but...I kind of wanted to go get some single drip coffee. kthxbai!""
- The Presidency is huge, not only as a symbol of freedom, but also as the leader of a world superpower. Even knowing that, the President's life is not worth all of the United States and South Korea. Pretty sure if 363 million lives were at stake, even the President himself would say, ""take the terrorists down, no matter what the cost"".
- TERRIBLE acting. I like Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, and Angela Bassett but surround them with REALLY TERRIBLE actors and give them a bad script and even they will fail. Not that Gerard Butler's ever going to win an Oscar.
- Of course it comes down to 2 or 3 seconds left before the WORLD ENDS.
- How did the terrorists get such an advanced weapon (the Hydra). What's funny is that someone in the movie asks, How did they get that?! No one answers that person because the writers were like...I dunno, just put it in.
- haha...fans of The Fast and the Furious (2001) will recognize Johnny Tran is the bad guy! hahaha

5595033,4,B00BEIYHT2,"You know what drives me to watching certain movies?
The actors.
I will watch any movie that my favorite actors play in. Even if they are some of the s****iest ones. (I'm looking to you, The Forger. And you too, Josh Hutcherson, for playing in it).

But in this movies case? Yeah, you guessed it. Gerard Butler.

Oh, lord. I'd swear my allegiance to a Scottish man if I ever get the chance.

I love almost everything he plays in (minus that one Dracula flick) and he always brings the action. And shoulders. Christ that man has some sexy shoulders.

So Gerard's character is going through some stuff from his past that affected his job. His job of protecting the president and the first family (in this case the two-faced guy from The Dark Knight, Aaron Eckhart).

Anyways, some crazy people invade the White House and this detail unsettled me the most. The fact that a group of random people are thinking this up scares the pants off me.(yes, I know this is a movie, but still!). The most protected house in the United States is under seize in minutes.

So there is a lot of explosions and shots fired and bomb detonations and betrayal and Gerard Butlers gruff voice. And Morgan Freeman. Hells yes. Mr. Freeman, you are fantastic.

Not a bad movie. If you're looking for something else too the same effect, White House Down was okay.",1389830400,,1333,4.552301255230126

5595103,4,B00BEIYHT2,"Olympus Has Fallen is the latest big budget action film from revolutionary Director, Antoine Fuqua. The film has a ton of stars and some great effects, but unfortunately it is very similar to a popular action classic. All is well in Washington, as the President prepares to meet with a delegation from South Korea. All of a sudden the capital is attacked and the White House is taken with some very important people still inside. The task of getting them out alive falls to one man, Secret Service Agent, Mike Banning (Gerard Butler). If you took the cast of the original Die Hard and had them re-shoot the movie, scene by scene, at the White House, you'd have Olympus Has Fallen. Normally I find Fuqua's take on the action genre, refreshing and original, but you wouldn't know it by watching this film. It is freaky how similar this film was to Die Hard, they even have some of the same twist, goals, types of terrorist, all that's missing is a short fat cop and a hand radio. Don't get me wrong, I did find the movie entertaining and Gerard Butler has really stepped up and taken the reigns as the lead you want in your action film. The effects are terrific and unlike Die Hard, this film has a ton of big named stars in it, that really do give the film some teeth. Olympus Has Fallen was a great idea, with a ton of stars, and the right Director. The film made a ton of money and gave us action junkies the edge of your seat entertainment we crave. If you saw Die Hard though, you're going to find many of the scenes familiar to the point of being ridiculous.",1389139200,2,1562,4.371134020618556

Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Dylan McDermott, Angela Bassett and Ashley Judd all portray their characters flawlessly and like the great professionals they are... I never saw Rick Yune before, but he is the other powerhouse performance as our utterly ruthless villain and deserves as much credit as Gerard Butler in making this one damn exciting and clever scenario.

SPOILER ALERT!

So, it wasn't my first choice of movies for the evening but being a fan of Gerard Butler and Morgan Freeman I thought how bad could it really be? Let me just keep it simple.
Pros:
- Continued action where the good guy gets his butt kicked too (without the unrealistic no flinch punch bs)
- Good all around cast
- Excellent pick for a villain!!
- Butler yet again delivers excellent sarcasm
Cons:
- Too many impossible/ improbable scenes
- Unrealistic protocol on our military/ government's behalf
- Too many cliches

Worse, it uses a ridiculous series of completely unrealistic events (terrorists flying a C-130 into restricted airspace, then shooting down a pair of US fighters who have flown so close to them that the fighter pilots could have snapped a portrait of the terrorist pilots with their cell phones, then a mass of terrorists on foot and in heavy vehicles descending on the White House with both US military and police running directly into their gunfire...and that is just the beginning of the absurd story line).

One thing that sets this movie really apart from White House Down is the swearing and it's a lot more bloody and violent. On the other hand, that makes it a little more realistic.

When the sequel (London Has Fallen) hits the theaters (probably not for a couple of years, though) I'll be sure to remember and go to see it.",1388188800,2,487,4.236559139784946

5595275,1,B00BEIYHT2,"This might as well have been a SciFi/Fantasy flick. The plot is nonsensical and very poorly thought out. I don't know if they did any research while writing this dumpster fire of a movie but I have to assume they were fresh out of google. Or maybe solely use Bing?

Pros:
-Lots of heads get stabbed. Like way more than you'd think could get stabbed. (Literally, heads are stabbed with knives.)

Cons:
-CGI was so bad. I don't know who funded this truck stop toilet of a movie but boy did they get ripped off (of didn't pay enough) for the CGI.
-The plot holes, oh the plot holes! I think this is how it went down. ""Sire, the focus group was wondering why it would take so long to get troops to the White House while it's under attack."" ""We'll just say that it takes them 15 minutes to respond...""
-The dialogue is a cliche' and predictable as can be for a summer action flick.
- It's a really bad movie.

(spoiler alerts)The Secret Service would not driven that close of that fast in a blizzard. (I don't want to really give the CGI too much crap but that whole scene looks like a cut scene from a video game.)

Common sense tells me that they wouldn't have let an unidentified and unresponsive AC-130 anywhere near DC. That would have shot down above the bay well before it was near land. BTW there are Surface to Air missiles all the DC Metro area. They wouldn't need to scramble jets, it would have just been shot down.

Common sense also tells me that the Secret Service would have followed protocol when getting the president to the bunker. They would have taken zero guests with them down where the classified nuclear code/system is kept and the only place it can be controlled. Also, the president wouldn't give in and tell the old man (Joint Chief?) and frail lady (Sec State) to give up their codes. And if he would have why did he let her get the s*** kicked out of her first? She should have serious internal damage from that beating and then the Panzy in Chief just gives the code up??

One last thing, once Morgan Freeman was acting Commander in Chief, nobody would give two s***s about the terrorists threats to harm Two-Face. That's the whole point of the Presidential Succession, so that someone is always in charge. Seal Teams would have moved in and the movie could have been over in about 35 mins.

5595276,1,B00BEIYHT2,"I'm not an expert in military tactics but this movie makes me feel brilliant.  Not a single action that was taken by the US government would ever actually happen.
The plot was flawed in the opening 2 minutes of the movie.  Our Air Force didn't try to intercept an unknown aircraft until it was just minutes from the White House? Not a chance. The Secret Service would break protocol when bringing the President into the bunker? Not a chance.  The acting was awful and script predictable and lame.
I'm a sucker for intense action movies and I was ready to turn this off when the White House was taken.  Don't waste your time or money.",1388188800,3,633,4.478260869565218

5595328,5,B00BEIYHT2,"A friend of mine told me that was a good movie but I didn't realize how good it actually was until I got it. It's almost believable in how the terrorists take over the White House, given the technology that is actually available allowed them the ability to plan and time everything and the ability of terrorists and traitors to infiltrate themselves into just about every aspect of society.

It's pretty formulaic for the genre of this type of movie - the good guys think they're too good and secure in what they do, the bad guys prove them wrong and have their initial triumph and approach pulling off their nefarious. then the good guys prevail. The acting is well done and the dialog doesn't break down into a lot of the clich's so prevalent in so many good guy/bad guy flicks out today. There's plenty of action and if you like shooting, fighting, blood splatter and violence there is enough to keep you happy, but not so much that it's over the top and gratuitous.

As far as the quality of the video it is sharp and clear, and the sound was great on my 5.1 surround system. I enjoyed this movie and will probably watch it again before it gets relegated to the lower ""watch again at a later date"" shelves of my video library.",1387497600,4,1230,4.41409691629956

5595371,5,B00BEIYHT2,All I will say is that this movie is way better than White House Down. Gerard Butler has become the ultimate action movie hero with this one.

5595451,3,B00BEIYHT2,"This movie has serious issues which nearly ruined it. Eckhart was a rotten choice for president. His abrasive expressions & behavior ruined any potential for the audience to warm up or sympathize with his predicament. Frankly, his constant sour, raging face did not compel the audience to hope for his rescue & no one would have mourned his loss. Genuine terrorists would have shot him for his abrasive demeanor alone. His hateful expressions of a violent abusive AH just made you want to kick him where it would hurt most.  It increased his expendability. He did not fit this role & would have been better cast as a secret service agent.

Melissa Leo as Sec of Defense wasn't any better. We were hoping for her early demise just to gain relief from her ridiculous, bad, over acting. Flailing around like wounded duck, wailing the pledge as they dragged her across the room. Her lines were the worst written. Whomever chose the actors for this cast should never work in the film industry again. They certainly did not know how to best match actors with roles. Eckhart probably would have been great as a SS agent or even the traitor agent but never a victim. Nor as a respectable leader of the country. Leo probably would have been fine as a cabinet member who was behind the scenes & not a hostage. She plays a rotten hostage as did Eckhart.

Morgan Freeman had his usual compelling warmth, composure & charisma needed for the role of a president or speaker. Butler as Banning also did an excellent job in his role as an unstoppable Rambo agent. Butler & Freeman carried the entire movie, along with the supporting role played by Bassett. Without them, the movie would have been a miserable failure.

The script also had several glaring issues so far apart from reality, it nearly ruined the movie. First was the President ordering his cabinet to give up their codes. No self respecting leader of the country would endanger entire nations & millions of people to save the lives of one or two cabinet secretaries. They are expected to die rather than give up those codes as is the President or any other leader. Even at the cost of their own families lives like on Failsafe. Giving up those codes as depicted was preposterously absurd. It was also equally absurd that any leader or country would kowtow to pulling troops or fleets or allow any other major risk to the country or Global security for the sake of one man. Even if that man was president. He is expendable & replaceable & never worth millions of lives or national security. The only way a concept like this would work is if there was a danger to an entire major city of millions. But even they would be expandable to save hundreds of millions more who would be endangered by complying with terrorist demands. A country cannot in reality, ever give into terrorist demands. Hesitating to send trained teams in to take down the terrorist for fear of harm to one man, even a President; while the codes for nukes were being activated, was simply unbelievable. He would be replaceable in the face of a catastrophic disaster. That office changes hands every 4 to 8 years as it is. How could anyone write such a weak depiction of such an event.

It is also absurd to think we would have any critical system which does not have a secondary access point & more than one way to override, abort & change the codes. Anytime someone becomes a hostage, ALL codes, logins & user access would be immediately changed & locked out to prevent anyone from forcing access to those codes. No critical system would be isolated to a single access point which cannot be overridden. Much less a ridiculously prolonged abort code. Even a hardened bunker has com lines & power lines & data lines whether hard wired, sat, wireless to connect to external systems which could be disabled at the connection points under emergency conditions. Password code breaker software would never work because most of these systems will lock out after 3 bad attempts & require a major reset before any further attempts would be accepted. Just like your bank. So the mere aspect of someone running code breaker Software to access a password in the defense system is utterly laughable.

A truly poor job of scriptwriting & directing.

Some final pet peeves were the first lady saying it was ok for her son to wear a baseball hat with his tuxedo. I would expect the first family to know basic etiquette of never wearing a hat indoors & not portraying poor taste. And finally, having the first family attending a billionaire's party fundraiser on Christmas eve & transporting them in dangerous weather conditions was simply unbelievable that anyone would write such an absurd scenario. No self respecting presidential family would spend their Christmas eve at some party fundraiser on Christmas eve, nor would their security detail drive them in such weather.

I would only expect such unrealistic writing & directing from a Total novice. There was also a total lack of storyline research into the security systems & design of the white house such as we saw on White House Down. Even with Butler & Freeman's excellent performances, the writing & directing nearly ruined it such as having Butler repeatedly wandering the same halls near the front door & never getting near the Peoc or basement until the finale. Or having Morgan Freeman giving into the terrorists & pulling troops & fleets for the sake of one man even if he was president. The concept is utterly ridiculous.

Their only saving grace was the popularity of Freeman & the excellence of Butler's performance.",1386806400,,5584,4.7366255144032925

The action was excellent but the reason for the 1 star is that you are FORCED to watch several advertisements before viewing the film. You are NOT allowed to forward to the movie.

5595521,3,B00BEIYHT2,"If you're looking for a simple action flick with the basic good guy vs. bad guys and their evil mastermind, this is not a bad choice. Think Die Hard set in the Whitehouse. The plot is nothing we haven't already seen and done better before, but it has some entertaining moments. If you're intent on finding plot-holes, this movie has giant ones that won't be hard to pick at. However, the action is done well, and the actors do as much as they can given the unimaginative script and shallow characters. If you're looking for fine performances out of Aaron Eckhart and Ashley Judd, don't. Judd's role is merely a cameo and Eckhart's role could've been given to any number of lesser known actors and pulled off just as well.

Overall, it's a decent time-killer that has some fun moments, but you'll forget about it pretty soon after it's over.",1386201600,,840,4.6

I mean, I'm not watching these things thinking I'm going to see Casablanca-level moviemaking.  But when I find myself so disgusted at the screenplay that the action can't bring me back, that's pretty sad.  If they weren't playing it so seriously, I would swear this movie was a satire because everyone in charge of anything made insane decisions.  The third time I saw someone deliberately bypass a safety protocol that endangered the entire country, I couldn't take it any more.

5595529,1,B00BEIYHT2,"Just how stupid can it get?  The movie starts by panning over a lush pine forest with steep rocky mountains leading us into Camp David...which is in the Appalachian mountains about 8 miles (as the crow flies) from me and I can tell you there are no mountains or pine forests even marginally resembling what is shown....not even close.  First and foremost, the president would have been removed from camp long before a blizzard, and would NEVER take a car through snow back to DC.  Then there are no bridges like that anywhere along the entire route.  Then we get to the fake plane with side guns that can pop out and shoot jets out of the sky without anyone actually aiming them....they just magically are on target.

It just gets worse and worse, and nothing that happens has even a remote possibility of happening the way it's portrayed.  The writers also seemed to have forgotten that there is a military base less than 2 miles away and more than a few anti-aircraft missiles and batteries that won't get taken down by the magical plane guns.  I'm sorry, but I couldn't get past the first half hour of this absolute crap-fest of a film.",1386028800,8,1139,4.553921568627451

Unlike the other movie, which seems to have a political aspect, this movie does not. This doesn't save the movie though, because the means by which the terrorists gain the White House is so improbable as to defy belief. Only a group of fools would charge machine guns, or stand up to fire on advancing enemies. It's as if the writers wanted the White House to fall, but didn't give any thought to a realistic process by which this might happen.

5595577,5,B00BEIYHT2,"I watched this movie because I was bored one day and let me tell you, it blew me away. I wasn't sure what to expect, to be honest the only reason I even considered watching it was because it was about Gerard Butler shooting things. I can't remember the last time I had that much fun watching a movie. Where do I begin? This movie is campy and cliche and classic all at the same time. This movie is the true embodiment of what a modern day 80's action movie should be. It's got ridiculous action, an egregious body count, and a plot that is so absurd it makes you laugh as it makes fun of it owns ridiculousness. It's got the has-been good guy that was the best of the best but ended up going into disgrace because of a mistake he made in the past. It's got said hero being in the wrong place at the right time. It's got North Koreans (AKA modern day Russians) and the senseless slaughter of civilians. It's got an appropriate amount of explosions and gunfire. It's got a caricature of the American military that thinks it can solve every problem with more firepower. It's got cheesy one-liners and a bad guy who isn't afraid to hit a woman. This movie has it all. This movie is such a delightful 80's action movie I actually feel it was done a disservice by being made in 2013. Watch it and have some fun, you won't be disappointed.",1385769600,2,1332,4.2687747035573125

5595588,4,B00BEIYHT2,"I would categorize Olympus Has Fallen as a well-done B action movie. The story line, acting and directing are all well-done, and there are enough action scenes to create an entertaining movie. Interestingly, both Aaron Eckhart and Morgon Freeman get top billing in the advertisements, but they have rather limited on screen time, especially Freeman. That was the one disappointment for me, since he is such a terrific actor. The story line is kind of like Die Hard goes to the White House. It's not particularly complex or thought provoking; more cotton candy for the mind. But sometimes you just want to sit back and enjoy the fireworks without thinking much.",1385769600,,660,4.954954954954955

I think this movie is better than any Die Hard or Arnold movie. The action, cinematography, plot, continuity, and surprises never let up and never falter. This movie is a 'work of art '. Perhaps some of the invasion scenarios are far-fetched... perhaps! I hope we never test them in reality. Some reviews preferred a movie like Air Force One over this!... that is ridiculous. This movie is far better. I really cannot fins any fault with this film. Maybe I would have preferred a little more of the hero and his wife's relationship... maybe? My personal favorite, slightly offbeat, slightly humorous moment in the film comes right at the end. The hero has to enter a password into the computer to shut down the program that was initiated by the bad guys. Just like James Bond defusing the bomb in Goldfinger and many movies since. Someone is reading him the letters and numbers over a phone line as he types them in. There are only seconds to spare. It is tense. They tell him to enter 'hashtag '. He says  'what!!!??? '.

Inprobable story, but entertaining, until the really lame ending.

2. The president ""orders"" the others to give up their codes thinking he will hold out now that his son is safe, but the enemies figure out his code anyway, and without having to leverage his son. Callous as it may sound, a President must be prepared to sacrifice his family to save the world from a nuclear holocaust. Other ""code holders"" would not be given them if, under duress, the President could order them to give them up to save themselves.
3. The old ""enter the abort code with 3 seconds left before Armageddon""  strikes again.

5595828,3,B00BEIYHT2,"Olympus Has Fallen offers a veritable orgy of death and destruction, as a massive gang of amazingly coordinated North Korean terrorists lay siege to the White House and take the President (Aaron Eckhart) and many of his staff and cabinet members hostage.

Gerard Butler plays a Secret Service agent whos been sidelined since a tragedy befell the Presidents family 18 months earlier while they were under his care. Turns out that single-handedly rescuing the President from a bunch of crazed, bloodthirsty terrorists may just be the opportunity hes been looking for both to get back in the Commander-in-Chiefs good graces and to prove to himself that he still has what it takes to be a good agent (so what if half of Washington D.C. needs to be sacrificed to make the point? Its all just collateral damage anyway, right?). Morgan Freeman steps into the breach in his customary reassuring-presence-in-a-time-of-crisis role, this time as the Speaker of the House who assumes the position of president while the Prez and Vice Prez are otherwise occupied. But Dylan McDermott, as a traitorous Secret Service agent, seems to be stuck in a bit of a career rut of late, what with this role and his current portrayal of yet another kidnapper-bent-on-killing-the-president in the TV series Hostages.

Director Antoine Fuqua certainly knows how to crank up the energy, but even the most diehard action film fan may have some trouble stomaching the astonishingly high body count in this one. At the very least, you might find yourself reaching for some earplugs long about the half hour mark just to find some respite from all the noise.

The initial invasion scenes are admittedly very exciting, but the static hostage drama - with its tough guy bravado and seemingly endless cat-and-mouse tour of the White House - that ensues eventually becomes wearying.

If you like movies in which the fate of the world rests in the hands of a single man getting to the launch codes in time - served with a heaping helping of good old-fashioned American jingoism on the side - then Olympus Has Fallen may be just the meal you ordered.

The story is of a disgraced Secret Service agent saving the day as North Korean terrorists manage to penetrate security, capture the President and top staff members, and take control of the White House. The Executive Mansion is all but destroyed as our hero takes on the terrorists in his single handed rescue of hostages and kicking the butts of the terrorists! While it is predictable, the action never stops nor falters, and the script throws a few real surprises at the audience. I expected this to be less than it turned out to be, and I was pleasantly surprised. Poor Morgan Freeman...in two films he is President of the United States, and in both, the White House and the District of Columbia are trashed. Aaron Eckhart is the hostage President and is entertaining though predictable. And the star, Gerard Butler, kicks butt as well as he did in The 300 movie as King of Sparta!  As a Secret Service agent, he ought to be wearing the cape and  with a big ""S"" on the chest! WOW! DC police, White House police, military aides to officials, trained body guards, Navy SEALS,  Marines, Army,  and Air Force personnel, dozens of Secret Service agents (as well as uncounted people in the streets of Washington) are wiped out by the North Korean bad guys, but our guy saves the day!

Equally shocking is that highly regarded talent like Morgan Freeman would lend their collective talents to this drivel.

Once the action gets going, it never stops, and the destruction is endless, the gun play fast and brutal. Be aware this is not a date movie: the body count is bloody and high, and the hero, played by Gerard Butler, is as ruthless as the bad guys, administering head shots to those he wounds. The plot concerns a Korean terror group seizing the White House, ostensibly to blackmail the U.S. into withdrawing from Korea so the North can conquer the South. But that may not be the real motive; the leader of the group may be up to something far more ambitious and deadly. It is all pretty silly, but extravagantly staged. Much as I enjoyed it, it is a little disconcerting to see the director of ""Training Day"" and ""Tears of the Sun"" reduced to directing an expensively staged B movie.",1384214400,,1001,4.629213483146067

5595956,2,B00BEIYHT2,"WARNING:  SPOILERS.  Don't read if you're going to watch, just skip this review.

I was actually looking forward to this movie, despite some weak reviews; I thought perhaps it just hadn't stacked up against the other, terrorists-attack-the-White-House movie in 2012/3.  But within minutes of starting it, I literally started to laugh, and told my S.O. that ""OMG, it's 'Under Siege!'  It's 'Under Siege' exactly,"", and so it was.  I actually got to the point of pausing the movie, and saying, ""next will be that scene where Steven Segal (sp?) tells the guy at the Pentagon/Ops Center where to put it,"" or ""next they'll deploy the Seals against the guy's advice, and they'll all die,"" and sure enough, I was correct, all the way through.

Literally, at some point in 2011, somebody involved in this film was up late at night, watched ""Under Siege"" and thought...""y'know, I could make that movie, set at the White House.""  Because it's almost a direct copy, line-for-line, plot element by plot element.  From the inner traitor (Gary Busey in US), to the heads (of this/that/next thing) gathered around the conference table with the speaker phone (Situation Room), to the gloating terrorist (Tommy Lee Jones in the original), to the disparaging, ""he's only attached to treasury now, he USED TO BE a SS agent"" (Busey talking about Seagal in the original)...I mean, it's practically a verbatim lift from the Seagal movie, which, even though I can't abide that actor, at least was *somewhat* original the first time around. The fact that I was able to know EXACTLY what was coming, scene-by-scene (they even had the hero knocked off the top of the WH by a helicopter/Seagal gets knocked off the Carrier by a helicopter; the dialogue between the hero and the Situation Room--you'll have to courts-martial me/fire me later bit) was almost funny, it was so blatant.  I'm shocked to see people calling it a Die Hard ripoff, (although arguably, you could say that US was a Die Hard ripoff), because let's face it, at least Die Hard was good, and it had some funny moments.  No funny moments here, BTW.  What this has that U.S. did not have is a scene showing how the hero ended up being ""disgraced"" (Segal/Seal/now Chef didn't have that; it was revealed in later dialogue).

So:  if you've seen Under Siege, you've seen this movie. I mean, you've REALLY seen this movie.  I gave it two stars for the budget, but I would have rated it one star for the egregiously blatant line-by-line, er, ""homage"" to Under Siege.  I know that Hollywood is out of ideas--hell, they're remaking Terminator, for the love of heaven---but unless somebody paid somebody else to use the original Under Siege script (like ""Barb Wire"" for ""Casablanca""), then the producers here owe the Under Siege scriptwriters some dough.  Not kidding.  I couldn't even just try to relax and enjoy the film, because all I could see were the endless similarities.

(BTW:  if I had taken a beating, in order not to give out my uber-secret code for our last line of defense, I'd be pretty pissed off that the Prez waited until I was a bloody pulp to THEN say, ""oh, give it to them, that's an order.""  What a load of old bollocks.  If I'd been the Sec. Def or Sec. State, whatever it was she was playing, I'd have kicked the Prez in the gonads when I got back to my tied-up position.  Just, for what it's worth.  Seemed like a ridiculous plot element.  Give it, or don't; take the beating, or don't--why take the beating and THEN submissively tell the Prez, ""oh, okay,"" and spit it out?  Geeeeeeze.)

However, if you've never seen Under Siege, and you like big, blow-em-up movies, with big stars and bigger budgets, this might be your cuppa.  Best of luck, but don't say you haven't been warned.",1384128000,,3739,4.719568567026194

There is no way this movie makes any sense by any stretch of the imagination.  The one liners (""I'll stick my knife through your brain"") entertaining but the drama is make-believe at best and there for is better for a laugh than for gripping the edge of your seat.

Live CNN coverage outside the downed the gate of the Whitehouse as all the secret service and military lay dead on the lawn? Really???

5596034,3,B00BEIYHT2,"That's a pretty big tell that this movie is not actually about the Korean hate-on for America.  That's not who bombed Pearl Harbor after all.

You either like this movie or you hate it.  I have no problem with it.  It is awkward in some places despite the high production values to be expected from a Hollywood film.  Watching jets shoot pedestrians on the street is very informative but watching the agents get taken out in the White House is infuriating.

I'm pretty sure that Gerard Butler who strongly echoes Mel Gibson is not coincidentally taking out the terrorists with a head stab reminscent of The Walking Dead.  Koreans don't remind anyone of zombie cannibals, do they?

Accept OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN on its own implausible terms, and you'll be able to sit back and thoroughly enjoy this adrenalin-charged, edge-of-your-seat political thriller with total, mindless abandon. You may even find yourself (most likely against your better judgment) awarding it four charitable stars.

Possible Spoiler: The one glaring canker sore of the film that positively drove me nuts was the lame, if not altogether laughable (""I-must-have-lost-my-way"") explanation on the part of traitorous Dylan McDermott, as he lies dying in a sudden ""epiphanous"" state of self-introspection.

A half hour into the picture the movie turns into constant sequences of people getting shot and brutally killed repeatedly. If you like spraying blood and sudden bullet holes emerging with the blood spray behind them, then you will love this movie.
Other reviewers have mentioned Die Hard and there is no comparison.  The violence is oppressive and gross and did you really think Gerard Butler had any funny lines in this movie?  He is just not fun or lighthearted at all in this role. His gift is ""know""ing before everyone else does what's about to happen so he can keep from getting killed.  So it has that wierd clique in movies where the lead character can never get killed no matter how many people are dropping like flies around him.  Ridiculuous!",1383782400,,850,4.64

5596076,2,B00BEIYHT2,"What do you do when you have a good director and a terrible script? You make 'Olympus is Down'. This film is a B movie made on a big budget. It looks good, is edited with precision, has a good cast, things get blown up real good, and people die in many bloody ways. But don't think too much about the story  because you will discover so many plot holes that it almost make the film laughable. In fact, you WILL laugh if you realize what some of the impossibilities of the story are as you watch this well put together but ultimately bad film.  This will be even more so if you have any military knowledge. So if you can park your brain in neutral, you can probably enjoy this overblown action flick.
Morgan Freeman is wasted as part of the cast. He basically sleeps through his performance. And the too brief appearance of the very good Ashley Judd will have you wishing for more. Gerald Butler is a hoot as the major star playing a disgraced secret service agent channeling Die Hard's Bruce Willis and is a joy to watch as the focus of the film. The action is fast and furious if impossible to do in real life.

True, there are implausible elements in the film, as there are in other films of this genre, but they do not detract. Once we accept the notion that US leaders are willing to see millions die to save the US president's life and once we go along with the idea that one man can defeat a well-trained large army, we will be pulled into the drama and enjoy watching it.",1383782400,5,661,4.426229508196721

5596113,3,B00BEIYHT2,"Rather short review on this movie and its an OKAY.  I would rank this 4 to 5 star on the action because the taking of the White House was the best part of the movie - Action is the best PLUS.  I suspect some may say that most of the movie was not plausible.  However, I was okay with the theme up to the point of them making it into the White House.  I felt both sides made completely irrational decisions from both aspects  - seriously, it stood out so much that it detracted from the storyline/plot.  Just some general observations as not to give too much away.  I would say the actions where treasonous by the many of the captured staff and those put in-charge of the US by the terrorist event.  As for the terrorists, they would have 'never' left that bunker given the agenda/nuke plans - where did they plan to go in a couple of minutes?  The main character who saves the day, I just could not figure out why the terrorists did not sweep the building in the same manner they ripped through all of the top security in the first place.  Basically, while I enjoyed the movie for the military hardware and fight scene action, I ended up repeating to myself ... they have to try and make a story.  Worth watching, yes ... hope my review is not a spoiler, but I'm sure some heads will shake and say - no way, they would not make those choices.

I was interested in the ending, so I fast forwarded through most of the film.

Lots of requisite torture on both sides.  The bad guy even talked in that low hoarse whisper that tells you right away ""This is the bad guy"".  Unless it is Clint Eastwood, of course.

Also, I expected the White House simply to be blown up, but instead it was a full scale invasion / war that was very cool!  The Korean terrorists also added a little twist versus the standard Middle East or Euro bad guys we've seen in other movies.  As the movie moved to the second half though, it got a little dumb and started to mirror all the Die Hard movies.  You have a mastermind main bad guy, hostages, hero talking through a headset, hero taking out hostages, hero injured but still kicking butt.

That was just the start of it too.  Normally i'm pretty forgiving to action moives, but for some reason this was just made me go nuts with the plot holes.  The action itself was still good and some of the dialog was not bad either.",1383177600,2,590,4.4953271028037385

Even your flick ""Shooter"" was better than this garbage (despite Marky Mark's horrible southern accent). I understand we need to suspend our beliefs to enjoy a movie, e.g., a Whitehouse takeover, but at least make it easier to swallow. The first half of the film was fine - not great, just fine. But holy crap did it sink into a smelly vat o' sewage when (SPOILER ALERT), the Speaker of the House / acting President gave into the demands of the terrorists and ordered the withdrawal of US forces from the DMZ, we well as the withdrawal of the 7th Fleet from wherever the hell they were supposed to be. That's not good movie BS; that's just bad fiction. Also, what's with the use of digital/CGI blood? Didn't you see how silly it was in Rambo 4? If you're going to spend the money on this flick (actors, locations, equipment) at least spend the money on good bloody special effects. If you're going to blow up the Whitehouse in this ridiculous mess, at least go all the way and make it an alien invasion. No, wait, that was ""Independence Day."" Now that was a good summer blockbuster. I give ""Olympus..."" two stars; one for the weaponry and aircraft used and one star for the sound quality on the Blu Ray.",1383004800,,1344,4.489795918367347

Slow jumbo transport plane is more agile than fighter jets. Pentagon crew is reduced to an audience rather than participant in the action.  Chief of staff flip fops in his plan of action in the same scene and we are expected not to notice the contradiction.

I didn't expect some Rambo mentality script though with a film like this, especially with Morgan Freeman, I guess he's taking any film now. This movie is so ridiculously over-the-top violent with countless people getting shot in the head and mowing people down with automatic weapons, bombs, slitting throats, point blank shots to the head, you name it. It just ruined what had the potential of being a good movie. I guess if compared to a Tarantino film it's tame but that's not saying much.

1 - This is the greatest movie ever made.
2 - This is the worst movie ever made.

9 - Some people live angry, twisted lives.
10 - Some people inexplicably receive discs with the wrong region coding OH FOR PETE'S SAKE PEOPLE, YOU DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT SUCH THINGS IN THE MOVIE REVIEWS!!!

Otherwise, terrible and stupid storyline along with Insulting for this country and it's first line of defense.  OMG, according to this movie, the South Koreans must be the stupidest people on the continent of Asia. Funny, how Gerard Butler manages to do what other Secret Service personnel, military, policeman, and so many others fail to do; rescue the biggest coward known as the ""President.""  I disliked this movie so much I complained the entire time it was on; although I did enjoy Gerard Butler kicking butt and I enjoyed Morgan Freeman taking charge.

Its predictable yes but that's the way it always was with the oldschool classics, good guy kills bad guys!! A lone hero!! Great action scenes massive amounts of devastation and explosions and cool kills as Butler does his job as ex Special Forces turned presidential guard, if you love the original two die hard movies and under siege movies then this is a must, its oldschool in every way, great fun, very entertaining!!!!

5596533,5,B00BEIYHT2,Olympus has fallen is a hero film that allows the American mind wrap their American fervor around something. It was very popular at the theater too. People want hope and I think a movie that shows that we still have the right stuff is really what people want to see at the theater. Not this defeatist stuff that some directors are passing off as good entertainment. Its never good when America looks ineffectual and there is no way out this movie certainly showed that against all odds there was a way out.,1382227200,2,506,4.510869565217392

Once again, the main character is able to dodge 89 million rounds of automatic fire, assorted explosions, knives, brutal assassins and save the day.

5596711,4,B00BEIYHT2,"I can only wonder why this film didn't do better at the box office.  It was a really good action flick about an attack on the white house.  OK, so the plot was kind of silly, especially the part about the terrorists having the secret code to detonate all our nukes(which was really stupid-if you reset the launch codes when the President is compromised, wouldn't you also reset all the self-destruct codes?).  However, if you like a film with lots of things blowing up, you'll love this one.

5596726,5,B00BEIYHT2,A little over the top (like Bourne & Bond) But that's the point. Crank the home theater surround  sound sys.,1381708800,,108,4.4

5596793,1,B00BEIYHT2,"The entire plot of this movie is based on the existence of a ""self-destruct"" system for all of Americas nuclear warheads. Which apparently only takes 3 codes (from 3 top ranking officials, including the President) to activate.  The President and his team are taken hostage in order for a terrorist to get these codes.  Apparently, the terrorists also know a lot more about the top secret system than does the Pentagon Join Chief, because apparently you can do more than just self-destruct the missiles after they launch, you can self-destruct them while they are still in the hangars on US soil.  Which the President apparently also did not know, since he ordered his other two employees to divulge their codes to the terrorists (to avoid be killed, but of course if the terrorists were actually prepared to kill them, how would they get the codes?).  Then we find out that somehow this top-secret self destruct system can not only simultaneous destroy all of America's nuclear warheads still in the silos, but it can actually set off the nuclear warheads themselves, leading to total American nuclear annihilation.  So, I guess the government contractors just decided to implement a self-destruct system that has the convenience feature of being able to simultaneously detonate all of America's nuclear warheads on US soil?  Pathetic.",1381449600,3,1335,5.073059360730594

Butler spends his time creeping through the wreckage of the White House in an attempt to free the President and hostages in order to redeem his status in the eyes of both the Secret Service and President for his apparent failure to save the life of the Presidents wife during an ice storm at Camp David.

5596933,5,B00BEIYHT2,"When I first saw this movie it was called 'Die Hard'. It starred the small wise cracking Bruce Willis. He appeared again in 'Die Hard in an Airport'. We got the bigger but dumber Seven Segal next in 'Die Hard on a Battleship' followed by 'Die Hard on Train. Now we have Gerard Butler who is big and muscular in 'Die Hard in the White House'. He seems to be a composite of the best parts of the other  'Die Harders'.

Butler is a fine Die Harder. He still has most of the muscle mass he put on for that Greek cartoon movie he made. He seems athletic although he never actually does anything that is athletic. Segal was choreographed in a lot of action scenes in his Die Hard Movies but he was always very stiff and implausible. The odd thing was that he was - at least when he was young - pretty competent in martial arts. Butler is better.

What makes a good Die Harder? Apparently it's the ability to never be hit by machine gun fire. Butler in scene after scene runs through a hail storm of lead and is unscathed. Yet he makes it all seem plausible. He must be a great actor.

My only complaint would be that I rented the HD version from Amazon but my Comcast cable connection only delivered SD with four dots. I watch movies like this in my Home Theater where I have a 9 foot screen and a new 1080 projector. I can tell HD from SD. I realize that this isn't Amazon's fault but it is a consideration. The only way to assure a good picture is to rent a Blu-ray.",1381104000,4,1462,4.137323943661972

Obviously some things wouldn't happen this way in reality but the over-dramatization works for pure entertainment purposes. Perhaps it is escapist fare and overly violent, but the violence is true to the concept--a major terrorist action against a heavily defended target. Not much to do there to avoid violence, especially if the attackers come prepared with a strong force. Good character acting and well done action scenes. Captures the Secret Service's loyalty to their president, even under a determined attack by a professionally trained and ideologically committed force. Makes us, and probably the Whitehouse, think about how best to upgrade the physical defense of the Whitehouse in the modern era. A mildly corny spot, here and there, but overall very well done.

There are no stoplights strung across the streets! I know helicopters can fly faster than cars can drive -- it takes the military 15 minutes to get into the city from Andrews AFB with the helicopters pacing the convoy. Seriously? And who in their right mind thinks there is no military presence in our capitol? No one has body armor except Gerard Butler's character. The Secret Service people and DC police get slaughtered because they just walk into the line of fire, over and over again. Are you kidding me? And the security codes that Mike Banning (Butler) memorized 18 MONTHS before he got reassigned all miraculously still work. I'm a suburban housewife for crying out loud, and I know you change your security codes more often than that!

You watch a sci-fi like a Star Trek and you KNOW it is far from the truth but acceptable and entertaining. meanwhile,  group of terrorist managing all the resources required and man power without getting any attention remind you and taking over Whitehouse! And this is presented as it could happen! American president portrait as a wimp. I wonder Hollywood was having one of their liberal dreams again.  Anyway, movie over all was OK. Agent gets blame for something he had nothing to do with...Taking off president's security detail and works for treasury dept. North Korean terrorist managed to get many, many armed and dangerous mercenaries with explosives into Washington D.C. and attack Whitehouse to invade and take over under 11 minutes.  According to the movie it takes 15 minutes for our Armed forces to response.

5597186,5,B00BEIYHT2,Great movie!  Sure makes one think about what can happen in such a short time.  Hoping the bad guys don't see it and some of our Homeland Security takes a hard look at what could happen if we don't pay attention.  Gerard Butler plays a great part.,1380672000,,247,4.212765957446808
5597187,4,B00BEIYHT2,"It was a cold and rainy Saturday. After running around town all day me and my girlfriend decided to watch a movie. After jumping around we settled on this one. Overall, it was a good movie. I was pulled toward this option because I am a fan of Gerard Butler's work.

I will caution you, without giving away a swarm of spoilers, but if you are the type of person who wants to be very mentally involved in a movie, this might not be for you. I don't think it's any secret that the movie centers around a group of people attacking the white house. Unrealistic, yes. Entertaining, yes. However, the plot line is not very deep, nor is it a real whodunit. Regardless, the action packed scenes make up for the lack of intellectual stimulation. The writer and director show some real imagination and have put together a decent movie.",1380672000,,825,4.4635761589403975

5597192,1,B00BEIYHT2,"This is one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. I can believe that a US President would be at Camp David because that's what the place is used for, but I have to step out of the make believe from the motorcade on. Nothing from that point on is plausible in the slightest. I've have a favorite novel where a plane attacks a building in DC and though that's really unlikely anymore it was made somewhat believable in that story, but not this thing. I love the Die Hard movies but this is not one of them either. I'd compare it to the movie that my daughter told me not to watch and I did anyway but thankfully I can't remember the name of it (it did have Ashley Judd in it though & was why I was tempted - another lesson learned!). Hopefully I will forget this one too.",1380499200,,769,4.099337748344371

5597218,3,B00BEIYHT2,"This movie was exactly what I expected, a shoot-it-up terrorist movie reminiscent of Under Siege or Die Hard. But the main difference? It requires too much suspension of disbelief. For me at least, there are just too many moments where I was sitting there saying ""Why are they doing that?"" or ""Why are they NOT doing that?"" Essentially it portrays most of the Secret Service, specifically the agents protecting the President and the White House, as almost entirely incompetent under pressure; with the exception of the protagonist, of course, who wasn't even part of the detail when everything happened. And several scenes just made our military look stupid. It was irritating. But, as I said, this movie was mostly what I'd expected, and if they'd filled in a few gaping holes and a couple of unanswered questions I could of called it good, so I'm still giving it 3 stars. There are a handful of moments, even whole scenes that make it worth watching at least once; just don't expect much from the Secret Service and the military and you won't be disappointed... for the most part.",1380499200,,1082,4.791443850267379

After watching it, I bought it so I could watch it as often as needed. A great movie. This is in the same genre as the Die Hard and Bourne series movies. Totally captivating, keeps you on the edge of your seat and does not let up the suspense for one minute. There isn't one lackluster performance in this entire movie.

Gerard Butler was the ever macho good guy and the special effects on the destruction of the White House, etc. was outstanding.  Of course the hostages, like the President, didn't have much to do but sit there waiting for Butler to rescue them.  I just was amazed at where all those Korean's came from that swarmed the White House with rockets, guns, planes, etc.  I thought they would never stop coming across the lawns.  It didn't matter, the movie was great and I loved it.",1380412800,,617,4.415929203539823
5597269,3,B00BEIYHT2,"Looking for a way to be entertained for about two hours of mindless actioner fare with a somewhat unbelievable disgraced hero (Gerard Butler)?  Olympus Has Fallen will do the trick.  It's pretty outrageous in just about everything and pushes the boundaries of our credibility to the max, but still, it WILL entertain.  There is much to like here, and I even warmed to Butler as the hero after a time. Yes, there is WAY too much wave-the-flag, rah-rah America pandering here, and way too much paranoia exploited during these very real dark days of terrorism, but this is, at root, merely a kind of Die Hard in the White House movie, without the more compelling sass of Bruce Willis leading the charge.  The entire movie revolves around terrorists taking over the White House and the disgraced CIA dude secreted away in the innards of the White House trying to thwart their evil plot.  Will he succeed?  Of course he will.  We all know that within the first 5 minutes of so of the movie.  In action flicks like this, it's always about the 'how' and never about the 'if'.  And most of us know--more or less- even about the 'how' part of the equation; we are merely there to watch it again, just like we've done in other films of this sort that we've already seen dozens of times.

Still, there are some scenes within Olympus that are somewhat rattling to see.  I won't tell you what they are other than to say they are icons of American society. I will watch Olympus again some day; perhaps soon.  It was worth an hour or so of my time in spite of it's simplistic paranoiac approach.  It is, in the end, an action movie and I am a sucker for a good action movie and this one, while primarily derivative and not too unique or genuine, was interesting enough for me that I even enjoyed watching it at times.",1380412800,,1802,4.4573170731707314

I would hope the SS is prepared for this type of scenario - this is too believable and its really a thought provoking moment to think a foreign country could possibly do this.  It is my hope someone in some useful position in the government would try to train our security personnel to prevent this - the House is expendable, the Senate is expendable - they don't serve a useful purpose anyway.

The movie was utterly believable and truly interesting and engrossing---where does the President go when the White House is under attack? Now we know!

The beginning is awful and slow and should have been woven in, IMHO.

It's extremely violent---extremely. I normally do not like this fare, but I watched it despite the violence (I could have done with half as much) because the premise was so good.",1379894400,,544,4.587628865979381

What are the chances of the entire White House security and all military personnel who get into the building all get killed within minutes, but one lucky hero fights on and completes mission impossible? In one word, none. This individual hero-worship feels very much a cultural thing, it doesn't care much for team spirit, discipline, sacrifice, fighting for a common cause. You always MUST find one single hero. Not good.

This thread carries on a bit when it comes to the willingness of the Pentagon to risk the whole country just to save the President. Seriously? Talk about putting the cart before the horse. The president is supposed to serve and sacrifice for his country, not the other way around. Very easily replaced.

Out of all the silly stuff that goes on in these movies, the most baffling one was how the President orders his two team members to give their captors the ""code"" they're looking for. Just to save those two individuals' lives. That's ridiculous, and if that's how those people really do their job, then I sure wouldn't wanna live in that country.

Strangely enough, the movie did engage me all through, and I never even thought about quitting on it. It's a busy movie. Just doesn't make much sense.",1379635200,,1281,4.7309417040358746

5597728,2,B00BEIYHT2,"You can almost see the filmmakers saying, ""Let's see if they'll buy this pablum...""

Apparently there's enough folks now believing every new Orange Alert Level fear blast straight out of Orwell for a film this badly written to succeed, but it does defy all logic how that can be possible. The plot here is beyond pathetic, and far beyond remotely believable.

The President of the USA travels with this little protection?
The White House is this porous and easy to break into?
Secret Service agents are this lame and moronic and unprofessional?
Best of all, North Korean terrorists are this expert and well-funded and able to breach DC airspace and then the White House etc in minutes?

Pull the other one.
Wait, you already pulled three!

I like Butler and Eckhard in most of their movies and they save this from being a total dumper, but they must have been paid a fortune along with VisaVoiceTM to make OHF. The dialogue is so weak, the premise so ridiculous and the plot so laughable that I couldn't believe this was made by the same guy who did the fabulous Training Day. Fuqua really hits a new nadir here.

But if you're willing to accept that this is a truly stupid film in most every way, the action is passable enough to be entertaining. The problem is, this film takes itself very seriously, and wants us to as well, and often feels like propaganda for the Endless War On Freedom, or terror, or whatever they're calling it lately. As long as we all feel Fear, all day every day, and will accept whatever police state we need to Save Us!

From the expert North Korean terrorists??!!
They can barely find enough to eat for their leaders there, let alone the civilians, who we should be helping with our military money, and the billions wasted on making chumpass flicks like this.

The more I think about this joke of a movie the worse it gets. Mainly because, unlike its infinitely superior predecessor Die Hard, Olympus has zero sense of humor, and plays all its moronic plot straight as a plastic arrow. Independent movies are bound to get more and more popular if Hollywood keeps spending fortunes on idiotic trash like OHF.

Watch Die Hard for the tenth time long before you even consider renting this. This makes the worst of the Die Hards seem like genius, and the first Die Hard truly does look like the finest film ever made up against this fake, hokey tripe.",1379462400,,2376,4.60047281323877
5597729,5,B00BEIYHT2,"This movie is, for the most part, a story that almost could happen in the world we live in now. That is what makes it sooooo scary!",1379462400,,131,3.888888888888889
5597730,3,B00BEIYHT2,"Director Antoine Fuqua (""Shooter"") digs deeply into his bag of American jingoism and flaunts it proudly in this action thriller.  With what appears to be a 13 minute cakewalk, a band of 50 or 60 North Koreans manage to take out hundreds of civilians by air while at the same time infiltrating the White House, arguably the most protected building in the world.  The ensuing gun violence goes on for many minutes and quite frankly, is nauseating.  I suspect the secret service wasn't too happy with this film or perhaps were just laughing hysterically.

As preposterous as the premise is, once the story shifts to former presidential ""body man"" Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) things get more interesting.  Years earlier, Banning was assigned to protect President Asher (a grimacing Aaron Eckhart) and his family.  Ater tragedy struck during a snow storm, Banning took a desk job at the Treasury Department.  By coincidence he becomes involved in the battle at the White House and manages to get inside.  The prez and much of his senior staff get to the underground bunker but once again, somehow those North Korean evil-doers manage to have the sophistication to get past the security and put even more bullets into more people's heads.  They have some inside help of course from both South Korea and the White House.  You can pick out the traitors just by watching their faces.  Terrible acting.

Rick Yune is pretty good as Kang, the NK's Kang leader (sorry, I couldn't help myself).  Hell, he seems to have more knowledge of American history, especially surrounding the White House, than the vast majority of Americans.  And he speaks perfect English.  Banning once inside, works with acting president/Speaker of the House Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) and the national security team to free Asher before Kang tortures certain security codes from him.  This all works well as the indefatigable and unbeatable Banning disposes of Kang's gang one at a time.  We know where this is all headed of course and the final scenes include a speech exuding a ""why can't we all get along"" mantra.  This is a by-the-numbers action flick with a dumb premise, excessive violence but a gritty performance by Butler makes it almost worthwhile.

This Blu ray disc comes in 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  While the display may not be of demo quality it is quite acceptable.  Scenes are clear with good contrast.  Colors are generally good although I did notice one scene in low light that seemed uneven.  None of this is a big deal but might be noticeable to some viewers.  The audio includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and it is excellent.  There were several scenes of heavy cross-fire and I felt like I was in the middle ducking bullets.  During the scenes involving heavy dialog, everything felt very normal yet immersive.  Subtitles include Spanish and English SDH. Here are the extras:

5597930,5,B00BEIYHT2,"The previews promised a thrilling movie, but I was attracted to the fact Morgan Freeman, Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart were in leading roles. Those actors never disappoint.
A singular historic event just days before watching this movie, made it an up close and personal experience.
The President of the U.S. came to town, our small city of Auburn in upstate New York. Auburn is home to William H. Seward and Harriet Tubman, so we have a strong sense of history and great pride for it. I spent five hours strolling around observing the security preparations made for the President's stay at the Holiday Inn, just one block from my apartment.
I was amazed at the extent of preparations prepared by a vast staff of security personnel.
I overheard many conversations (grumbling) about the perceived expense of security and disruption of our regular routines, both business and personal.
Having witnessed this security first-hand, it was chilling to see (in this movie) the even more extensive security in Washington fail, as terrorists invaded, occupied and destroyed the White House. It was sobering to consider that this could be possible, given the sophisticated technology and weaponry available.
Auburn's Mr. Seward was attacked and nearly killed the night of President Lincoln's assassination. The assassin of President McKinley was executed by electric chair in Auburn's prison, one block past the Holiday Inn where our current President slept under protection of Secret Service, State and City Police and County Sheriff Dept. All this security was effective; the President arrived and departed safely and without incident.
This movie, Olympus Has Fallen, depicts the horror of security breached and defeated and the heroic efforts of courageous men to vanquish the invaders.
I would have thoroughly enjoyed this movie on it's own merit, with pulse-pounding action and heart-stopping drama.
And I would have seen it as an entertaining fiction.
But the President came to town and I witnessed the entourage of security protecting him. I saw (and photographed) the snipers on the roof of the Holiday Inn and the ""suits"" mingling in the crowd. I saw the blockades, police tape and orange cones defining secured areas.
I watched this movie just a few days later and that experience made the tension of the plot ever more real than it might otherwise have done.

From the moment the attack starts you really have to work hard to ignore how ridiculous the set up is, it starts with a tooled up Hercules taking out two F-22's with side facing miniguns with what amounts to an aerial sucker punch. It just gets sillier from that point on.

Ok, so it's not a thriller, it's a silly action film, I don't mind that. On this score it does deliver. There's some fun sequences and good moves, but nothing more than that. The characters are one dimensional and the story predictable. Surprisingly for a film with this level of budget some of the CG work for the initial attack is poor, although once the action is in the White House it's not so obvious.

The action just about lifts the film from poor to average, but to be honest, you're better off watching something else.",1379116800,2,1052,4.521052631578947

5598075,4,B00BEIYHT2,"This movie is entertaining and keeps you energized.  Gerard Butler is a good actor, I like other movies that he is in.  While I don't believe some terrorists could get as far as these did it does show us in a heroic light.  Those who defend the White House are portrayed very well.  There are other aspects of the movie that are good but I won't spoil the movie for others who haven't seen it.  I do recommend watching it.",1379116800,,422,4.225
5598076,3,B00BEIYHT2,"Olympus has Fallen(released April/13)stars,among others,Gerard Butler as Mike Banning,Aaron Eckhart as President Benjamin Asher,Morgan Freeman as Speaker Allan Trumbull,Angela Bassett as Lynne Jacobs,Rick Yune as Kang Yeonsak,and Dylan McDermott as Dave Forbes. This film has so many plot holes and inconsistencies that you could fly an Apache helicopter through it and still have room for the 7th fleet trailing behind it!
The story involves Butler as a member of the secret service assigned to protect the president. On the way to a function around Xmas time out of Camp David,during a violent snow storm,the lead vehicle in the presidents motorcade gets hit by a branch. The resulting swerving on the icy roads of all vehicles sends one over a bridge and into the river. The presidents own car perches precariously on the bridges edge,ready to follow suit. Butler races to the car and manages to pull the president out,leaving the first lady trapped in her seat belt,as the car plunges into the river below.
Many months later Butler is sitting behind a desk doing other assigned duties at the agency. Into this scenario comes a radical North Korean group who are posing as employees of a delegation from South Korea visiting the president. As they meet a Hercules transport plane is inbound to the White House. It is intercepted over Washington by two Air Force jets,but they are easily taken down. Before any other response from the Air Force can be mustered the plane is circling the White House and tearing everyone and everything to pieces. Simultaneously,in the White House bunker far below the surface,the North Koreans in the delegation have killed their cohorts and have now taken the president and his team hostages. Also an outside and unseen group of Koreans has started attacking the White House from the outside and eventually make their way inside to take over the White House.
Butler has seen the commotion from afar and has raced to the White House in time to join in the fire fight but not save many of his former colleagues. He gets inside and inadvertently becomes the eyes and ears of the officials in the Pentagon. Besides taking out as many hostiles as he can,his first major piece of business,once he has contacted the Pentagon,is to retrieve the presidents son,in hiding,and spirit him out of the White House into the safety of the military outside. From here it is a piecemeal battle all the way to get to the president himself. The man who leads these terrorists has a goal to obtain the Cerberus codes. These are codes which when inserted into the national defense computer,can arm or disarm the U.S.'s ICBM missiles. In this case,when he finally extracts the codes by force,he activates the missiles IN their silos and intends to blow them up where they stand. In addition he has gotten the Pentagon to OK the removal of U.S.troops from the DMZ between North and South Korea,and removal of the 7th Fleet in the region. He also creates a diversion aimed at fooling the Pentagon and outside world that the president has perished in a helicopter crash.
Butler sees the crash but doesn't believe it true. He goes into the belly of the White House and finds that the terrorist leader is still alive and has the president. In the scuffle the president is shot but Butler finally kills the terrorist. The film ends as the president,now well,gives a heart warming speech about the U.S.,its belief system and the usual God bless America stuff;with a happy Butler now back serving the president as before.
As my title says,this is a mind-less film. Mind less,not only in plot holes,but in the all important believability factor. If one cannot suspend disbelief long enough to buy what is going on on the screen,then the film will ultimately fail. And this falls into that category. It had plenty of potential but it just couldn't follow through. I will list some of the more obvious mistakes. The first faux paux is the plunge the presidents wife takes in the car into the river,played by Ashley Judd. After it goes over everyone is just sitting there in stunned disbelief. No cries of ""Get down there"" or""Send for divers"",or no one going down and into the river to even try to save the first lady. The secret service will give their lives to protect the president and his family. Not here. The second faux paux is the Hercules transport plane the Koreans commandeer and fly over Washington. There is no way that plane would have been able to get close enough to landfall let alone over the city before it was intercepted. This thing was well over the city before jets showed up. Once the first two planes were shot down by the transport,the second pair showed up in a flash. Funny that. The third item is how long it took the military to respond to the crisis. The Koreans said they took the White House in 13 minutes and the military showed up in 15. Now you are going to have me believe that in a situation like this the military would move like a snail and get there in an EXTREMELY tardy 15 long minutes? C'mon. The fourth item is the secret service agents and others defending the White House during the battle on the front lawn. In very unorthodox fashion,they are all standing there on the front steps like bowling pins,in a big group,like lambs to the slaughter. Not how the secret service or any military like group are trained.
I could go on but I think you get the point. The only thing this film has going for it,fortunately,is Butler. I like Butler,and he again is ""in the zone"",for he and he alone makes you get behind his character. When he is roaming the interior of the White house looking for targets,you are with him and rooting for him,and the resultant action is good stuff to watch. This is the film's most appealing point. Otherwise,as I said,the situations all leading up to putting Butler where he ultimately gets to, are too far fetched for the thinking person to buy.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras. This is a definite trend,as I'm sure many of you are seeing. The more the powers that be want you to switch over to Blu Ray,the less extras they put on DVDs. I for one,am resisting switching. I mean how clear does ones picture have to get for gosh sakes? DVD is just fine for me thank you very much.
All in all a disappointing film with a great cast. Butler does his best to save the day,and once we are over the totally unbelievable circumstances that get him to the meat of the film,he turns it into a decent action film...for a time. But it is the lack of suspension of disbelief for the first and most important part of this film,that drags it down.",1379116800,,6673,4.670348343245539

The head terrorist bragged that they took over the White House and were with the President in the bunker where they could launch nuclear missiles within 13 minutes. Very scary thought!

Flashes of 911 and the Boston attack go through your head. We deal with this kind of stuff so rarely (thank God!) that we waste precious moments going ""WTH?""

5598199,5,B00BEIYHT2,"Hollywood has seemed more interested in making films that appear patriotic but at the same time take cheap shots at this country at the same time. It is rare that instead they do what movie makers did in the past by celebrating the spirit of this country. RED DAWN was an example of that. Now they've come out with a movie that will stir the soul of all American's watching.

OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN stars Gerard Butler as Mike Banning, a secret service agent in charge of the security of President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart). Banning has a special place in the hearts of the first family including young son Conner (Finley Jacobson). As the film opens an accident on an icy bridge results in the death of the first lady (Ashley Judd) as Banning rescues the President.

Time goes by and Banning is now assigned to the Treasury Department and a desk job. While the President holds no grudge Mike's presence is a reminder of what happened. Waiting for a chance to return to the field, Mike stays in touch with his boss Lynn Jacobs (Angela Bassett). Through no fault of his own, that chance will soon become available.

Early in the day when the ambassador from North Korea comes to the White House for a meeting, an attack is launched on the building. A low flying military plane shoots down citizens left and right as well as guards and soldiers all over the White House grounds before it is hit and crashes through the Washington Monument. With bodies lying all around a land force then crashes the fence, plants a blockade at the entrances and begins an assault on the building and those protecting it.

Having run to the White House once he was aware of what was going on, Banning makes his way through bad guys taking them out as he heads to the front doors. But these bad guys are on top of things and with RPGs and heavy artillery take out most of the agents in charge of protecting the building. Soon the White House falls before help can arrive. But they don't know that Banning has made his way inside.

As all of this goes on outside the President, his entourage and the Koreans head to the bunker in the basement. It is here that the Korean ambassador is killed by his team, a group of terrorists led by Kang (Rick Yune) who now takes the American's hostage and then contacts those now in charge led by Speaker of the House Trumbull (Morgan Freeman). His demands are for the 7th Fleet to remove themselves from Asian waters and for troops on the demilitarized zone in Korea to begin withdrawal.

All the while Banning continues to make his way through the building in search of Connor. With his access to codes and knowledge of the building he establishes contact with Trumbull and the assembled team trying to bring this crisis to an end. Banning is their only hope and the only person inside who can give them information. But can he rescue Connor, the President and stop the annihilation that Kang has in store for the world?

This is a picture that pulls no punches and turns the non-stop, palm sweating action up to eleven. There is never a time in this movie when you stop and wish you had the remote in hand with your finger on the fast forward button. Even the second time around this movie rocks with enough mind blowing excitement to please the most jades action film fan.

Butler shows why he's so good in roles like this. He offers the sophisticated look of an agent when needed but brings on the tough guy heroics in such a believable fashion that you can't help but root for him from the get go. This is the type of hero that everyone would hope was around and guarding the President. If you were forced to choose between Banning and Jack Bauer you'd be hard pressed to decide who you wanted next to you.

Scenes of the Washington Monument and the White House being bombed or blown apart will wrench your heart as will the sight of the United States flag being tossed to the ground, shot to pieces. There is no way not to recall the events of 9/11 while watching this film and it makes you consider the fact that there are and most likely always will be enemies of this country waiting for the chance to do us harm. Let's just hope that if they were to attempt something like this that there are plenty of real life heroes out there to stop them cold in their tracks.

5598208,4,B00BEIYHT2,"First, let me say that I truly enjoyed this movie. It was fun, fast paced, and overall filled with some fun twists and turns. The characters are interesting, and decently developed (i.e. they won't win character development awards but they are believable in the movie's context).

The film features a low-frequency heavy DTS-MA audio track, with solid explosions, 360 range of bullet fire, and generally clear dialogue (a bit low on the volume scale for my tastes but with ""night mode"" on my receiver, it brought this a bit more in line). The movie was fun and kept me interested, whether as I was ducking under my coffee table with the sound of a bullet flying by or my breathing slowing as the character sneaks.

The video was good, presented in a well saturated 1080P. It was generally a dark movie though filled with some bright moments. For this reason it may be best to watch the movie in a dark room or at night so that the textures in the darkness aren't washed out by sunlight on the TV.

Overall, while enjoyable this movie isn't something I would go back to. The movie was good, and features a Die Hard-esque plot (one man vs. incredible odds) which is predictable once you get a quarter of the way into the movie. The characters are fun and they had my interest, but I never found myself truly ""routing"" for any characters. I couldn't get behind them fully as I never felt I understood the villains motives. The plot just kind of drops the motive on you and keeps going without any build up or solid explanation.

While the plot had it's weaknesses, it was fun, enjoyable and a fresh action romp that will keep those looking for a fun action movie without too much depth satisfied.",1378944000,3,1693,4.540983606557377

5598255,4,B00BEIYHT2,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

The role of lonely action-hero is one that is constantly up for grabs. Sure, you have your Die Hards and your Bournes, but that doesn't stop Hollywood from churning out a few other strays in between sequels to those series. It should be noted, though, that Olympus Has Fallen isn't a full-on ripoff, but it's very easy to draw similarities between this film and the two previously mentioned franchises. Die Hard, in particular, due to the fact that you have your macho lead (Gerard Butler) who makes it his responsibility to save the day when things take a turn for the worse.

Mike Banning (Butler) is an ex-U.S. Army Ranger and former Secret Service agent. After a terrible crash that led to the death of the first lady (Ashley Judd), Banning transfers to the Treasury Department. At this time, President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) is having a political meeting with South Korean Prime Minister Lee Tae-Woo (Keong Sim). Disguised as a South Korean ministerial aide, Kang Yeonsak (Rick Yune) has set-up a plan of attack on the White House. Driven by the repercussions of past wars, Kang wishes to leave America just as broken and desolate as Korea. Using his skill-set, Banning makes his way into the White House in hopes of saving the president, his son, and the country.

In my opinion, there were two things that really stood out while watching this movie; the action sequences and the film's ability to keep you on your toes. The film, surprisingly, clocks out at around two hours, but there is rarely a dull moment. Even in the beginning of the film, which is usually set-up to gain an understanding of the characters, the writers hit you with a big set piece around ten minutes in. From that point on the film becomes an adrenaline rush as you go from firefight to firefight, fistfight to knife fight, rinse and repeat. It's the nonstop action that kept me engaged throughout majority of the story.

With that said, though, there are also two big negatives that stood out to me as well; the film's generic nature and the extremely dated visual effects. Because this is an action flick it's hard to feel worried about the well-being of Banning, the president, or the country. We know he's going to come out on top and we know the country isn't going to end up in ruins. Part of me wishes that, just once, we get a movie that goes against the grain. One where the antagonist comes out on top, showing that not every hero prevails in the end. I know it's a stretch, but it is something I would like to see at some point.

Then there were the visual effects. I had a similar complaint with the latest Die Hard film, but Olympus Has Fallen definitely has it worse. Because there's a lot of action done outside, as well as inside, there's bound to be a lot of special effects throughout majority of the movie. They're obviously not going to shoot down a bunch of helicopters just to make it authentic and they're also not going to run a plane through the Washington Monument. I understand that, but if the budget isn't large enough to make it look good then it isn't something that should be kept in the film. Most of the big set pieces looked like CGI that was ripped from a ten year old movie.

Performance wise you get what you can expect from an action-flick. There's not a terrible amount of emotion in any of the characters' dialogue so don't expect to be blown away by any of the performances. With that said, though, both Butler and Yune played their roles well. Butler is (almost) always enjoyable in films like these and Yune was able to be both intimidating and terribly menacing at the same time. Eckhart was ok, but it definitely wasn't the performance of his career. For the most part, he didn't have much dialogue and his character was annoyingly spineless. And while it was nice to see Morgan Freeman as the Speaker of the House Allan Trumbull, he didn't get enough screen-time to make much of an impact.

Overall Score: 7/10 - Olympus Has Fallen succeeds in being a mindless action flick, but it fails to be anything more than that. The story isn't overly interesting and it can become predictable at times. Then there's the dated visual effects and emotionless acting which don't do much to add to the overall enjoyment of the film. Still, it's enjoyable for what it is. The action sequences are unique and it's a fun adrenaline rush. If you have some time to kill then I would recommend giving it a shot, but it isn't something you should go out of your way to see.",1378857600,,4540,4.583743842364532

A coordinated assault using an AC-130 gunship to cause confusion and kill as many of the White House guards as possible and an organized and well trained assault team with heavy weapons was very realistic. From the flare dispensers on the AC-130 to spoof the infrared guided missiles fired from the White House to the heavy machine guns in the garbage trucks it was a very realistic scenario. The only ""iffy"" aspect was the South Korean intelligence service being so thoroughly infiltrated by North Korean agents and into the South Korean Presidents entourage. That and the fact that the US President insisted on taking them all down to his bunker.

5598394,4,B00BEIYHT2,"Well conceived story and believable characterizations throughout.
Just remember that this is an action film not ""War and Peace"". The supporting side stories do add to the flow of the story and can hold the audiences' attention.
As far as impact is concerned, consider that our National People's House (AKA the White House), has been actually burned (by the British in the War of1812), crushed in ""Armageddon"", blown up in ""Independence Day"", and now partially in need of renovation here in ""Olympus Has Fallen""; so if watching this type of poetic license via story line and CGI causes you angst go watch one of the ""007"" series movies.
Unfortunately, the number of bloody shootings in this movie stretch the already frayed barrier of gun violence in movies (not to mention the helicopter crash into the East Wing and the Puff-the-Magic-Dragon gunship violence), so I would suggest that you be very selective in who watches the movie in your house. Little ones who may just now be learning moral values and rules could be very confused; unless of course playing ""Grand Theft Auto"" is the norm in your house.
In many ways this movie stands alone among the Action Film genera based on its numerous story lines; you know, protecting little children, nasty North Korean rogues left over from one of those afore mentioned ""007"" movies, and the convoluted resuscitation plot line of a shamed Secret Service Agent (at least Gerard Butler is not portrayed in a party in a hotel in Columbia). A special note is called for here in that it is a known fact that Butler can portray the most believable ""down-in-the-mouth"" look of any actor currently working (Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart were as better). There is, however, one huge grain of salt required to accept the part of the story that has Puff appearing over the Potomac river without having been dealt with earlier by the USAF or that there are numerous ""battle-worthy"" ground vehicles (including garbage trucks), that appear in front of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave without so much as an earlier ""by-or-leave"" from the half-dozen police and military agencies that have actual control of the couple of square miles around that address. So, there are a number of story holes (ahem, large enough to drive said trucks through), but once personal credulity has been dealt with then the story flows on.
All in all a violent bit of fluff that can assist in popcorn sales and, pending the required suspensions mentioned above, one can smile when the bad guys (and girls), bite the dust.

Maybe I have spent too much time in DC, but the other silly part of this is an AC-130 Spectre getting over the White House to strafe and rocket security forces without being shot out of the sky by a USAF F-16 from Andrews.  It's a movie and you can imagine anything.  George Lucas talked about the idea he learned from Kurosawa about an exquisite reality even for a science fiction, but this whole thing was just a tired summer action movie recycling old ideas, saved only by a great cast including one of my favorite actors, Aaron Eckhart.  Glad I could see it on Amazon and not pay the ridiculously high prices to see it as  a theater.",1378512000,,843,4.30379746835443
5598554,1,B00BEIYHT2,"(Spoilers from first 30 minutes)

I couldn't make it through more than 30 minutes of this amazingly bad movie.  I normally don't have a problem with suspending disbelief in a film, but this one was so totally unbelievable that it was unwatchable.  In the first 30 minutes we have:

1.  A Presidential convoy where the cars are following so close that when the one in front slams on its brakes, the rest bang into each other in a chain reaction.
2.  A C-130 that manages to fly all the way to the White House with bad guys aboard and the USAF can't manage to divert it or shoot it down.  Instead it shoots down the AF Fighters.
3.  So many bad guys smuggled into the US with high tech weapons that all the security in the White House can't manage to stop them.  Instead all of the WH security guys run out onto the lawn with their pistols drawn and get cut down by automatic weapons.  Nobody thinks to stand behind something for cover.
4.  Our hero, of course, never gets shot, can run behind the bad guys shooting them and no one turns around and shoots him.
5.  When the President is taken hostage inside his ultra-secure emergency bunker (don't ask), the entire US military 'stands down' because, gasp, the Prez is a hostage.

That's when I turned this waste of time off.  First, how did the baddies get all of this weaponry, trained insurgents, hardware, etc. into the country and set up this well-planned assault without anyone (CIA, FBI, NSA, etc.) getting a whisper?  Second, sorry folks, the President is NOT the government.  We have protocols about this.  If the President is no longer able to function as Chief Executive, for any reason, the VP becomes Chief Executive (oh, and Commander-in-Chief) and life moves on.  The entire military of the Unites States does NOT 'stand-down' because some terrorist took the President hostage.  More likely, whatever government is deemed responsible (and an attack this well coordinated and involving this much high-tech hardware has to have government backing) is told, ""Knock this off right now of y'all, as a country, is about to become one big steaming pile of radioactive waste.

Thankfully I didn't make it to the torture and abuse scenes that evidently came later.

Just too stupid for words.  I would have given it 0 stars, but Amazon won't allow it.",1378512000,3,2305,4.667493796526054

The possible spoiler is here;  Morgan Freeman's character, as Speaker of the House, is closed minded. His character has flaws just like any of us. He also has more than just a few actions and lines which may be seen as hurtful and negative toward the USA. Point in case, his attitude toward the massive population of the USA when compared to a handful of political types (the POTUS and his staff) is .. well, sadly accurate but very possible. I know, he is merely acting and he is very good. His role (and character) is very convincing. Well done!

But I was slightly annoyed that the Secret Service (as depicted in the movie) didn't pick up on some basic security concerns that I (with hardly any knowledge on the subject at all) peeped out using basic common sense.  I won't mention them all because then I would basically give away everything about the movie.  But: in an emergency, I would never send all three ""human keys"" to a major security system into the same bunker.  Also I wouldn't place a White House visitor (no matter their rank) into the same bunker as essential US officials.

So while what I witnessed in the film was jaw dropping at times, I kept reminding myself, ""This would never happen this way.""  And therefore couldn't really connect with the plot.

5599165,4,B00BEIYHT2,"It's Labor Day weekend and looking on Amazon Prime for a decent movie to watch over the weekend I ran across ""Olympus has Fallen"". I heard about it coming out but didn't know what it was about in detail or if it was good or not. But with a promising cast including Gerard Butler and Morgan Freeman, I had to give it a shot. Olympus Has Fallen is a movie about a terrorist attack on the white house. A former secret service agent who works in D.C. happens to be around when the white house goes under attack. He springs into action, killing terrorist, saving lives, and tearing it up throughout the white house. The rest of the plot, I'll leave to the viewer to learn the final story and events without spoiling it.

I rented it and watched it in one sitting. Bottom line - REALLY enjoyed this movie. Is it over the top? Yes. Is it completely ridiculous and unrealistic? Yes. Does any of that matter? Not really. This is a true, rock-em, sock-em, action flick with Gerard Butler's high energy driving it. I have to say the action really outweighed any downfalls/flops in the storyline. I really enjoyed it and usually I pick at movies like this. Honestly the only real thing besides the unrealistic side of the movie is the CGI. Some areas of the CGI were very budget-y and looked like clips out of a video game and not genuine elements. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I highly recommend it. A good date night movie or something to watch on your own one night. It's fun and entertaining and had me glued to the television from beginning to end. It's above average but I can't give it any more credit than that for a weak story and ridiculous action scenes. I did thoroughly enjoy it though and recommend to audiences.

There's a bunch of these coming out/came out in the past couple of years and this is actually a decent one because it knows what it is: Big, dumb, ugly.  There's very little plot development, it goes straight into action mode after about 15 minutes in.  It's an action movie, that's how it should be and the action is well done.

The problem is that this movie feels overly long, the characters are paper thin (won't care about them), and the motivation for the terrorists (and traitor) are too implausible (even for this kind of movie).  Solid 4 stars for this popcorn flick, slightly offensive to military personnel though (because of the boffed navy seal assault).",1377907200,,730,4.761904761904762

I dug it.  No extended, sappy Hollywood dialogue about how I'm going to kill someone, just a bullet to the head.",1377907200,,378,4.463768115942029

5599250,4,B00BEIYHT2,"I was surprised @ how good this movie was. There were SO many parts that had the 'been there, done that' feeling. But with the leading star's charisma (Morgan Freeman/Gerald Butler) it was actually a good 'been there, done that' so you were forced to forgive them, and easily!
Plenty of battles, gun shots, and shot 'em ups. Lots-a blood, thrown in, also. The bad guy was superb, superbly evil enough to play against your hero to have you rooting, almost aloud for that hero. The ending was a surprise, although that too may've been in another movie,('Been there, done that' AGAIN??) I am not quite sure....
Unfortunately, not good enough to ever watch over.... so I would only give it a four star rating.",1377907200,,705,4.648

This movie, treated the President the center of power, so the fairy tale begins, Then, for a commander who sends young soldiers out to die for his visions, the President is unwilling to die, as is his staff, for the 'Cause' and easily gives up the Codes to our ballistic missiles.. The US government is designed, so that if the President is lost, no harm comes to the country, so in reality, the nuclear arsenal would never be allowed to fall into terrorist hands. The President would be written off, and the country would continue not dealing with terrorists.  I am a Vet, and I know that our military is the best trained in the world...this movie shows only incompetence on the part of the President and the military, and is an insult to the people of the United States...It's the worst movie I have seen in a long time!",1377907200,,963,4.410112359550562

This movie had me sitting on the edge of my seat throughout the entire two glorious hours of action scene after action scene. It was an intense, action-packed, adrenaline-fueled amusement park ride of awesome. It was the kind of movie that when the credits start rolling, you're so energized that you want to start doing fist pumps and chase your toddler around the house for a few hours.

Over the years and the easy accessibility of Netflix, we've become super selective on which movies we add to our permanent movie collection - buying perhaps only one or two movies per year. We hate rewatching films, and yet the decision to purchase this film was a no-brainer. This is a movie that I will be happy to watch over and over again.

Butler does a great job as the hero who is able to manipulate and seek revenge on the terrorists inside the White House. I felt like I was watching an updated version of Die Hard. (this is what Die Hard 5 should've been). A very hip and manly movie for a summers night. My wife enjoyed it as well. I found it similar to an old Chuck Norris movie called Invasion USA.

This was very well written and the best of the best playing out their scenes with a hero and a very believable one, Gerard Butler.
Morgan Freeman at the helm when the impossible happens and a great supporting cast that did and said what they believed and were horrified at the same time.
Angela Bassett was the true and rock steady woman that believed in what she knew and believed that they could be saved and
made major decisions when the men around her did not have a clue or a solution when the ""gates of hell"" had been opened.

I watched the movie after reading the reviews. Knowing a little about a movie is worse than knowing nothing.  So I'll try not to add spoilers.

Non-stop action; an excellent cast from the hostage President Aaron Eckhart, who plays his role stoic and patriotic to the Acting President Speaker of the House Morgan Freeman, called upon to make beyond difficult decisions to bad guy Rick Yune, slimeball extraordinaire, make this an action film you don't want to miss.

How surprised I was to actually find this movie interesting and while it was predictable, even in the times we live in, some of the scenes were shocking.  No one wants to see the White House destroyed or the Washington Monument cut in half.  I believe I enjoyed this movie because it ended right.  I would have given it five stars, but I save my five star rating for movies like To Kill A Mockingbird which are few and far between.",1377648000,,547,4.221153846153846
5599699,5,B00BEIYHT2,"So this is how it works in the social media age: everybody gets together and decides they either ""like"" or ""don't like"" and when everybody sees what everybody else comments, they jump on it and write comments or reviews trying to hit the note everyone else is sounding off on. Few people go out on a limb to challenge it. And here, it really deserves to be challenged because this truly is a good movie. It's a great cast with a good solid plot and it is well done.

It's a classic action plot: there is major situation at the White House involving the President being in jeopardy, and events concerning the secret service with some of them being tortured to keep their secrets, and the lives of millions of people hanging in the balance. The absorbing tension needed to carry the film off is there. Finley Jacobsen, a child actor who plays the President's son, Connor, does a great job and it is a very likable role in which he is both victim and hero, hiding in secret places throughout the White House. There is quite a wonderful cast with a number of major characters that keep it moving and interesting, including a Secret Service member who is devoted to the President and just can't be kept down, played by Gerald Butler. The supporting cast was truly noteworthy, Melissa Leo and Angela Bassett as major female political players whose mettle is truly being tested do a wonderful job. Morgan Freeman is superbly cast in his role as Speaker Trumbull who steps up and acts as President, facing the most difficult decisions anyone could imagine confronting, racing against the clock, and following his gut instincts admirably.

Many movies today go out of their way to be far-fetched and different, and viewers fall for them and give them good reviews while cutting down good, solid movies like this that don't try to reinvent the wheel. This is a winning film, on the order of classic action movie making. If you feel like you haven't seen a good action movie in a long time because the genre has gotten out of control, tries too hard, and is insanely and ridiculously graphic and bloody, this will be a refreshing reminder of how things used to be. If you are the jaded type that has seen it all, is overstimulated by it all, and now needs to be wowed with outrageously graphic and loud, bloody and outlandish scenes and bizarre plot lines just to stay awake, then you'll be like many people who sadly did not appreciate this flick.",1377648000,,2437,4.6

Looking at the cover one would think Morgan Freeman was the main character but he actually is not.  Mr. Butler is the main star and he does a good job with his character.  The plot is not new but it is a new twist and the use of the C130 Gunship was pretty cool.  As usual, there has to be a disloyal greedy betrayer who tries to redeem himself but fails to do so and it is pretty unexpected in this movie until he is revealed.  They do a good job hiding him in plain sight till the right time.  There are guts and blood everywhere when this is over and the good guy wins once again but I like the movie.  I recommend it to anyone liking action adventure quasi-military movies where the Secret Service and FBI top dogs look pretty inadequate and the guys down lower in rank, the grunts, if you will, turn out to be the better men.",1377561600,,969,4.063157894736842

5599859,4,B00BEIYHT2,"If you are one of the 10's of people who've never seen Die Hard, then you will find this movie new and exhilarating.  For everyone else, it's pretty much a carbon copy of D.H., with a setting change...that of course being the White House instead of Nakatome (sp?) Plaza.  Gerard Butler does a fantastic job.  He acts well, fight choreographs are well done, and he adds the necessary grittiness to make it somewhat believable.  Yes, we all know this can't and never will happen; however, if it did, I certainly wouldn't trade any other for Butler's character.  He did seem to know a little too much of operations, procedures, hidden fail-safes, etc., but then again he was head of Secret Service - so who am I to judge what they know and don't?  Morgan Freeman was...well...Morgan Freeman.  A superb actor in almost any given movie in which it's not done as a favor.  I kept waiting for him to say he missed his friend Andy DuFresne, but that's just me I suppose.  I can't really say much negative about the film except for the fact that it was a rehash as previously mentioned...like Fast and Furious was Point Break with cars instead of surfboards.  So, do I want my money back.  No.  There was a lot of action, explosions, gun-fighting, hand-to-hand combat, etc.  Would I rent it again?  Probably not, but then again rare films are they that warrant re-rentals in my opinion.  Short summary:  Great action, predictable plot, great choreographed combat scenes, and they definitely entered the ABACABB code for blood (for my fellow Mortal Kombat 1 fans - you know who you are!).",1377561600,,1578,4.683636363636364

Sure there are some ridiculous Darwinian terrorist assumptions about our idiocy preparing for assaults the size of a 56 Buick, but hey I watch SciFi so I'm use to stretches of imagination.  So sweep aside your disbelief and pretend it's a Super Hero movie and anything is possible.  I bought the Amazon Instant version and the picture quality is good as long as your internet connection is up and Amazon isn't having streaming issues.

For people that care about action that is ""reasonably"" plausible and details like showing them reloading etc. this movie does a good job.  Some of it was obviously unrealistic like decisions made by the acting president and that lowered the enjoyability a bit for me - but it was in line with this type of action movie.

A top Secret Service agent moved from his position as the President' s protection for something that wasn't his fault, and in fact something he did right. Later, an emergency situation requires him to come back to the President' s aid. The attack on the White House is both hard to believe and yet, at the same time, looks like it could actually work. It's scary to think that it could be pulled off. But, then, the President in this movie violated protocol to put himself into danger. Hopefully it'll never happen in real life.

It's a good movie, I really enjoyed it and recommend it. The only really bad part, as far as seeming real, is at the very end and I won't describe it because it would be a spoiler.",1377475200,,736,4.411764705882353

Now I'll get to the point, Like most of you I've seen the commercials, seen Morgan Freeman, Gerard Butler, Ashley Judd, Aaron Eckhart and thought this is a all-star cast, this is going to be a great movie.. WRONG, the acting is horrible and NOT believable but that could be due to the fact that I already know whats going to happen next because THIS MOVIE HAS BEEN MADE OVER A HUNDRED TIMES!!!!!!!!

Its like they didn't even make an attempt, the special effects are cheesy but if you can get passed all of that this would have been a good movie when the script was first wrote but unfortunately 30 years later it's already been done LOTS of times

If your dumb enough to buy this movie then may God have mercy on your soul because you will regret it... throwing money like that away on a movie you probably already own..

5599914,5,B00BEIYHT2,"Olympus has Fallen stars Gerard Butler in perhaps his best movie role since 300. Also stars Aaron Eckhardt as the a president and Morgan Freeman as the Speaker of the House who becomes the acting president. The White House is taken over by terrorists, and even though there were technical aspects of the film that were erroneous, the special effects and most of the weapons shown were spot on.

Gerard did a spectacular job of playing ex-special forces Secret Services agent Mike Banning, who used to be the president's top man. But because of a car accident a year and a half earlier that took the president's wife, Mike now works for the Treasury Dept.  Then the White House comes under attack from visiting dignitaries from North Korea.  Mike manages to get inside and in a plot that is similar to Die Hard, Mike single handedly takes out all of the terrorists and saves both the president's son and the Commander in Chief.

I highly recommend this movie, it was not too over the top and even though it was a ""Die Hard in the White House""  It was still one of the best action movies to come out in a long time.",1377388800,,1113,4.463054187192118

The first 90 mi uses are full of plot holes, but mainly the ignorable kind. But it just gets worse as it goes, and the last 30 minutes aren't particularly good in the action department, plus the plot goes way off the rails. There is absolutely no reason not send the army in at the end, but they never do, and its just silly watching Gerard Butler go it alone at that point. Plus, despite repeatedly saying ""we don't negotiate with terrorists"", the government immediately gives in to every single terrorist demand.

Took some doing but I found the link to Amazon Customer service. Pleaded my case and they upgraded the purchase to HD for the same price as Vudu. Basically... its 5 bucks more.

5600022,5,B00BEIYHT2,"Gerard Butler, Morgan Freeman, and Aaron Eckhart star in this edge-of-your-seat thriller.

As the movie begins, the President (Eckhart) is spending time at Camp David during the Christmas holidays preparing for a fund-raiser.  Among the others there is secret service agent Mike Banning (Butler).  While the group is en route, a terrible accident occurs which claims the life of the first lady (Ashley Judd).  Mike manages to save the President, however.  Despite his split-second decision to save the President, Banning is released from his duties.

Fast forward 18 months.  Mike is now working in the Treasury department.  A mysterious C-130 gunship is spotted flying over Washington D.C.  Soon, it starts shooting up everyone and everything in sight.  Fighters are scrambled and the White House's missile system is activated, but to no avail.  Eventually the plane is brought down but not before dozens of North Korean terrorists have stormed the White House, kidnapped the President and vital members of his cabinet, and locked themselves in the Presidential bunker 120 feet below the surface.

Witnessing these activities from the Treasury department, Mike makes his way over to the White House.  Finding most of the secret service agents on duty dead, Mike make his way inside, determined to do whatever he can to stop the terrorists.  In the meantime, the Speaker of the House (Freeman) has taken control of the government.  Now begins a cat-and-mouse game between the Speaker, Banning, and the terrorist leader (Rick Yune).  Who will win?

This is an excellent movie.  The plot is exciting and the acting, especially by Butler and Freeman is first-rate.  There's lots of exciting action, and the special effects are really good.  If you like fast-paced action thrillers, then be sure to watch ""Olympus Has Fallen"".  Highly recommended.",1377388800,,1843,5.221843003412969

As commander in chief he should be held to the highest standards. He not only did it once but twice. I don't see him as heroic at all. If he is an example of a civilian leader without a military  back ground than I think Robert Heinland got it right in ""Starship Trooper""--if you want to vote or hold public office you need to have served your country in a military type of service (think C.

But I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Eckhart, Freeman, Bassett--all of the actors did a great job.  Not predictable.  This movie left me feeling proud.  I rarely write reviews--but after glancing at so many negative reviews I felt compelled to write a good one.  The people who didn't like this film probably think that Blue Jasmine is a great idea.

This movie is all about action and gore and about virtually nothing else that can be associated with a good movie. The story is understandable yet nonsensical. The characters have no depth. The CGI is notably lacking. And, most damning, the movie severely lacks drama.

And it just gets dumber and dumber from there.  Yes, a lot of heart pumping action and cool scenes.  But laughably dumb.

5600109,1,B00BEIYHT2,"First, I was very (unpleasantly) surprised by the amount of gratuitous violence in this film.  I don't know how many people I had to see graphically get shot, cut, stabbed, etc. which really changed the entire audience and point of the film, shifting it from what ""could have been"" a good story had the script been worked on more.  I expected more of a Harrison Ford sort of government suspense film.

Sadly, this film apparently decided to use very graphic killings on screen, over and over, to try to keep the audience's interest (for me it had the opposite effect).  I barely finished it and held out for the intriguing sounding plot - the film they should have made - that elaborated on the idea of secret passageways inside the White House that only the secret agent that coincidentally knew like the back of his hand could use to his advantage - not just once, but in many clever ways, as the premise of the story.

That didn't happen.  I won't even go into the plot holes (story lines completely dropped) or the ridiculous premise and what turns out to be a seemingly pointless motive after dropping one that might have made a little sense.  I felt sorry for Angela Basset (who seems to be typecast as a D.C. high ranking official in many films); her superb acting (I think she tried her best) was limited by the ridiculous plot and how much she could look upset in the ""war room.""  Morgan Freeman's character was also flattened by the dumb story (he's also a great actor) - again, with entire plot point dropped, the history between the characters and mention of some prior bad blood between the politicians didn't play into the story at all (so why bring it up in some foreshadowing way?)  Lastly, no commander in chief would ever (spoiler alert) give away countries or nuclear weapons codes to save the life of one person, even the President.

Gerard Butler did kick some butt, which is why it didn't get negative stars.  I wanted more glib one liners though like the one about ""I liked your friend, he seemed like a funny guy."" Finally, the secret service agent that ""went bad"" suddenly has a moment in the tunnel and turns it all around?  They didn't explain that at all.

Skip it.  Hollywood, you can do better.  Give these actors something to work with.",1377302400,,2267,4.562962962962963
5600110,4,B00BEIYHT2,"I rented this the other night and was not expecting much. However, it provided a easy to follow plot that had you engaged with the characters and action throughout. I read some of the critic and ""formal"" reviews and I have quit putting so much weight on them. They seem to believe that every movie they watch or rent should have some incredibly new storyline or be a work of art. Unfortunately, if this were the case then such movies would then garner similar reviews they provide the movies they do with negative reviews because it's ""another knockoff"" or the ""same story"". Sometimes I don't want an intentionally thought provoking movie and I don't think most people who rent this are looking for that. If like me, you are simply bored and want decent entertainment this is not a bad choice. I was entertained, found there to be plenty of action and thought the cast did well. Will it win awards? No... but if you want a medium length film, that offers simple action-based entertainment that movies along at a great pace with decent acting, effects providing for an overall enjoyable experience you will likely find this enjoyable experience.",1377302400,,1144,4.7537688442211055

Near the end of the movie there is a bit of a jump for one scene to another that is hard to follow, and a statement is made by one of the main characters concerning the status of the President that does not go with what you just learned in the movie.

There are so many movies out there that are just not worth a second look, but not this movie!! I am going to buy it and put it in my collection, so that we can watch it whenever we want. The only part of the movie that I didn't like is, I felt like the movie made the President look weak. However everything else about the movie was GREAT!!!

The movie had the vague plot line of Segal's Under Siege movie where there was the lone ""nobody"" who saves the day, the one good guy who is really a bad guy who aids the enemy, etc., but if you put that out of your mind you are still entertained.  It was a rather unique, although highly unlikely, scenario of a terrorist group gaining control of the White House and President, but overall the director and cast pulled it off rather nicely.  I didn't laugh too much at the super human killing skills of Gerard Butler and didn't fall asleep like I have done with a lot of other movies of this genre.  Overall, it was worth the $4.99 it costs to watch.  Enjoy!",1377129600,,728,4.323529411764706

Perhaps you'll think of WWII, perhaps the Korean Conflict, or Vietnam or for those younger, the attacks on 9-11. When you do that, you'll realize that we have a long way to go. So maybe this movie will help motivate you to do something you might not have done.

So, as when you get on the roller coaster, and they strap you in, and pull back the bar, you are in for a ride.

I love Morgan Freeman and Gerard Butler (atleast in some Butler films, i.e. Atilla, Phantom of The Opera), but I digress. I sat squirming in my seat most of the time.  I hate foul language and there was certainly alot of shooting and blood.  The part that really gripped me however, is that this same scenario or something similar COULD HAPPEN PEOPLE.

And if non-stop 2 hours of killing is your cup of poison then this film has that and more. The frightening aspect of viewing this film is the current focus on security leaks, the failure of misplaced intervention in other country's wars, the concern about China's and North Korea's and Russia's response to US actions over the Snowden matter, and the continued random appearing terror attacks throughout the world and terrorist-like attacks here at home that add a degree of credibility to what in previous years would seem like an absurd story. It is food for thought - or for tweeting...

When the White House (aka ""Olympus"" according to Secret Service Code) is captured by a Korean terrorist mastermind (Rick Yune) with his cast of thousand assistants and the President (Aaron Eckhart) is kidnapped, disgraced former Presidential guard Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), who still reels with the guilt of not having saved the President's wife (Ashley Judd) in a tragic car accident, finds himself trapped within the building. As our national security team scrambles to respond, they are forced to rely on Banning's inside knowledge to help retake the White House, save the President and avert an even bigger disaster. The White House staff who escape into hiding to observe the derring-do include Morgan Freeman as the Speaker of the House cum interim President, Secret Service Director Angela Basset, General Clegg as portrayed by Robert Forster, and traitor par excellence Forbes (Dylan McDermott) and the others in the cast include Radha Mitchell as Banning's wife and Finley Jacobsen as his young son Connor and Melissa Leo as the tortured Secretary of Defense Ruth McMillan.

Where the story (written by Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedkt) falls apart is the failure of security and military measures designed to protect the Whit House during such situations. Hopefully in reality it is not that crude and mismanaged!  Not a bad action film (it keeps you watching closely for 2 hours) but a bit to phony in its patriotic ending.

I agree with others who have said that this story made them mad. It made me angry, too. In Olympus, the White House has been attacked and overrun by North Korean terrorists. The President, Vice President and Secretary of Defense are being held hostage in a commend bunker underneath the White House. So, under the Constitution, with the Prez and VP being incapacitated, the Speaker of the House becomes acting President. The elected president is now expendable. He's no longer in charge of anything. So far so good, except that the acting President then proceeds to agree to every one of the terrorists demands in order to save the now expendable ex-President.

Pull American troops out of South Korea? No problem!

Recall the 7th fleet? Your word is my command, Mr. Terrorist!

Naturally, as soon as the acting President does these things, the two Koreas mobilize their respective militaries. War is imminent.

Give me a fracking break! It would never happen in a million years.

For at least the last 40 years, the #1 operating principle of the U.S. government with regards to terrorists has been: we do not negotiate with terrorists. End of story. ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is a summer blockbuster, and as such can be expected to ask a certain amount of suspension of disbelief from the audience. But it is going too far to expect us to sit back and accept that any Commander in Chief would disregard a core principle of policy and put world peace in grave danger, for any reason, much less to save one expendable man.",1376956800,,1533,4.769811320754717

Nevertheless, I rented the movie. You would not believe how much of the original Die Hard is in here. I just don't want to take space enumerating. You could actually find the parallels on the Internet. But let's put this aside and look at the content.
Terrorists took white house and had President and top aids captive. You would  not believe how easy it is to do. They request codes to blow all nuclear missiles in their present locations. Three codes required. So president gives secretary of state and secretary of defense (was it?) permission to give up the codes, since he, the president, will definitely not give up codes and it is useless otherwise. Wow. Has he not seen ""Under siege 2""?
Who in right mind would do it? Next. Terrorists demand US military to stand down, or they kill president and the cabinet members (who they kill anyway, I mean not the president, of course). And acting president (speaker of the house) agrees.
They demand to withdraw the seventh fleet, and get out of South Korea - or else they will kill the president and guess what -  acting president caves in. Hell, why won't they demand acting cabinet to blow USA and save themselves a trouble of figuring out how to do it on their own?!

C'mon...it's a bit of explosive patriotic popcorn poppin' fluff that any 'murican gun owner can sit perched at the edge of ones ez-chair, sweat glistening upon furrowed brow whilst racking the slide and dry-firing a favored pistola...and for the rest, it's just a bit of visual propaganda to remind us all how much we need our government to protect not only ourselves but the rest of the ""free-world"" from the evils about us.

I mean did anyone else notice how the Washington monument fell? Kinda reminds me EXACTLY of...Hmm...one wonders.

I mean look at what can happen if government isn't given all powers to protect us all. Disillusioned and angry traitors are all about us..I mean remember back in the day when 'Murica was 'perfect' and was the envy of the universe and now with all the globalization, wall street bankers..and stuff.. look at what we have become, some have lost their faith and might do treasonous things and make pacts with our enemies and plot against us. No..no..I didn't mean to imply that we actually somewhat resemble a near militarized police state cloaked under a thin veneer of 'rights for all' democracy even with the guvment sweeping up all our private info, squeezing our civil liberties as tightly as they can muster while having secret laws, secret courts, secret prisons, secret secret...Nooooo...

Watch this movie with that tattered flag, partial destruction of the white house, smashed phallic totem and those foreign TERRORISTS with their wiley tricks and ways to infiltrate the highest levels of government, all the way into the white-house with sharp implements, explosives, firearms-a-plenty and an endless supply of ammo and tactical gear, not to mention their stellar ability to mount Gatling guns on rooftops, in armored trash trucks and get a cargo plane gun ship to fly so close to the capital before it gets challenged and then subsequently is able to shoot a pair of the most technologically advanced fighter jets out of the sky. Dem terrorists sure are clever and sure are scary.

No..just a good 'poppin' corn movie that like minded patriotic types can gather about and shower admiration, pride and praise at their honorable savvy, resourceful and kickass hero's. Who..by the way... Saved the day with GUNS...LOTS and LOTS and LOTS of GUNS..which a fellow generally cannot have in 'the district'..cos guns are dangerous and do not save lives...as we saw from the positive results of their negotiating skills. As we all know and readily collectively believe and tried fighting like hell earlier this year to assert, its absurd to believe ""to stop a bad guy with a gun, you need a good guy with a gun""..I sure hope nobody misread anything there in the movie because the 'gunplay' was just for emotional effect and excitement, probalbly why the last fight scene was with knives which also are outlawed for personal carry btw..so don't you all be going out buying OTF flick-blades longer than 2"" now.. guns BAD, guns BAD!! In real life this would have been resolved over earl grey tea and billiards.. Sheesh...all the critical reviews here..

I must say, I quite liked it. Gerard went back to the gym and buffed up. Pres has a cute kid, Ashley Judd is still fetching, Cole Hauser is still a square-jawed stone cold bad-ass, Morgan Freeman is still lower-cased 'god'. We got a chance to see how advanced and hi-tech the operational command is, weaponry our armed forces have at their disposal (notice the hard core arms were ours), No AK-47's to be seen anywhere, all NATO type small arms..gotta love the MP5's, who doesnt.. Great stuff.

4-stars..take one star away for that finger waggingly unnecessary ""making the monument get hit by a plane and fall like the North tower"" heart-string tugger...""- ""yes..give homeland security more power to protect us..dam our civil liberties..stop and frisk, infringement of 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 8th amendments are directly under threat of being weakened, circumvented or disregarded..all in the name of national security. This movie reminds us that this ""war on terror"" continues on and we need to remain vigilant and patriotic, give them all the power and authority to protect the homeland at all costs, even it it includes giving up our own liberties.

It's a fluff-piece that because it's so exciting, so ra-ra-ra, so ""my chest swells with pride"", so ""How dare those bastards take down our flag and throw it off the roof..bastards!""

The premise is Die Hardish with very little variation, no new tricks or even explosions. Here's the kicker though for me, the plan evidently revolves around the (SPOILER ALERT) so read no further ..... the Pres inviting the North Korean Prime Minister into the bunker....so if that hadn't happened I am not sure how this could have worked. Of course I was paying so little attention I am not sure whether they clarified North or South... Exclude that major flaw and I could go on to list many, many more that makes absolutely no sense as plot points. I am so disappointed though as Antoine Fuqua is a director I do like....I am a fan of The Shooter with Mark Wahlberg and had hoped this would be as entertaining as that movie but it is so far from that....I gave this a three star only because I suspect if you don't know a lot about the White House, the Air Force, air defense systems, the roles of government, the South and North Koreans, or security and you are a fan of either one of the three main actors then you might actually want to see this dud of a movie.

5600925,3,B00BEIYHT2,"With the story set almost entirely in the White House, and with decent acting and a creative story-line, you haven't seen this exact movie before.  Yes, the Die-Hard movies have exhausted the one-man-against-a-phalanx-of-fanatical-terrorists angles, but not in and around the White House.  Yes, the premises about an unidentified aircraft getting so close to the Capitol, about the strengths and limitations of ""the bunker"", about the conveniently located secret passages that were ignored by security planners, about the Secret Service's best defensive stance (pouring out the front door of the White House like ants from a stirred up nest, firing small weapons in the open at heavily armed terrorists) all stretch credibility beyond the breaking point.

5600927,2,B00BEIYHT2,"I purchased this movie thinking that the combination of Gerard Butler, Morgan Freeman, and other famous actors would make this potentially a better version of Die Hard 2.  Alas, it wasn't; not even close in fact.  In order to enjoy this movie, you'd have to suspend the law of physics, common sense, military tactics, and just good plot lines.  I guess that's okay if you just want to vege out, watch a movie full of nothing but fight scenes, and senseless violence.  But if you want something more than that; or are not able to suspend reality or your IQ for the length of the movie; I'd recommend not watching this one.  There are some great actors in this movie and there was the potential for some great acting moments but alas none of that came through as the plot was too simple, too straightforward, and the directing did not get the most of the all-star cast.  In the end you are left with a movie about a bunch of North Korean terrorists who capitalize on a full lobotomy of the protection and military services protecting the White House to capture the President so that he can cause a nuclear Armageddon in the US while letting the South Koreans get overrun by the North Koreans.  Of course, they are foiled when they too experience a lobotomy after taking the White House and are now incapable of stopping the Butler from retaking the White House, saving the president, his son, the Secretary of Defense, and getting to kiss the girl at the end.  All in all, bad movie with terrible plot not centered in reality (don't get me started on the military aspect of the attack on the White House).  Lastly, I really have to take issue with some of the villain choices in Hollywood nowadays.  I know there is fear about North Korea lobbing missiles at us and most of Asia but seriously the odds of them invading the US, attacking the White House, or any other attack on the US are slim to none.  One cannot feel that these directors are feeding into racism around Asians and playing to the stereotypes of that ethnicity.",1376784000,,2025,4.52054794520548
5600928,4,B00BEIYHT2,"Wow.  I rented this because, out of so many summer movies, this seemed the most original.  I would like to say first that it was very well filmed, with excellent performances all round, but is rated R for a reason!  The amount of swearing was almost distracting at times.  Still, the scenes of this film stood out due to the heightened tension, suspense, action, and emotional resonance.  We viewers can feel for Mike Banner and his wife, as well as Pres. Asher and his son.
If you are looking for a proper action movie, you have found it.  Patriotism and determination have never been stronger, despite the never-ending hails of bullets from the enemy.  The special effects were astounding and lent credence rather than comedy to the film.  The President and villains were very well cast, and Gerard Butler did a superb job as the tough hero.  There was only one thing that stuck with me from the beginning of the movie--why wasn't Jeremy Renner cast in Butler's role?  I couldn't help but wish it was Renner onscreen, since the role of Mike Banner seemed right up his alley.
Still, I did not let my presuppositions ruin my viewing experience, and I highly recommend this film to people who enjoy seeing madness and mayhem dispensed on America...and see the American spirit prevail to the end.",1376784000,,1294,4.711111111111111

Sure the idea is a little far fetched but the special effects were decent and the action was very intense.

They did that with good acting, good visual effects and with total disregard for honesty. In other words, they plainly stole the book, changed a few things and sold the movie. I understand that shady practices permeate the movie industry, but this one was too much. Besides all that, it was very difficult to ignore the obvious stupidity of the officials portrayed. The president was a pansy, acting like a child. He didn't suck his thumb, but almost did. And, worst, they script him delivering a patriotic speech at the end of the movie. It will turn your stomach. If that is our government behaviour under terrorist attack, we should move to another country. Fortunately Gerard Butler saves the day. I'm sure real life Secret Service agents are pretty much like his character. He makes the movie watchable. Morgan Freeman does a creditable job as Speaker of the House. His best scene is when he berates a general. That was great. The rest of he cast performs well trying to survive a script lacking in believability. The terrorists are the best and one feels happy to see them dying. Hollywood: learn from Vince Flynn and pay attention to this: we, the United States of America, do not deal with terrorists under any circumstances, we do not cave to their demands, we do not negotiate with them and, most of all, we will fight them to the death if necessary.

5600982,2,B00BEIYHT2,"I know lately we have seen a couple of isolated failures in our national security intelligence but this movie asks you to just overlook many things like a cargo plane being stolen from I presume a relatively close military base without triggering ANY heightened state of alertness (especially after 9/11). Why is it that NOT A SINGLE AGENCY has a clue that this has happened and notified all concerned interests? Also, there are usually weeks or months of planning and preparation before a dignitary from another nation is brought to the White House. How the hell did a small platoon of heavily armed Asians get that close to the White House without being spotted by secret service? And were there no bomb-sniffing dogs within 100 miles of DC? And how did a known terrorist just waltz in posing as security? Then after the platoon effortlessly mows down ALL of the White House security all of a sudden they can't take down ONE guy who is trapped inside the White House and is badly out-manned and out-gunned? There are many more issues for sure but I could go on forever. A thought occurred to me while writing this review. Maybe real life has more interesting plot lines than what an out of touch Hollywood writer can come up with. Most of us real world people are no longer impressed by these unrealistic scenarios. Why not just make a movie with real life scenarios? Maybe if the out of touch Hollyweirdos would pull their collective heads out of their a....butts and come back to reality then we could actually have an interesting movie to watch.",1376784000,4,1550,4.681318681318682

5601026,4,B00BEIYHT2,"For the most part, this movie is worth the rental.

 Plot: Although the plot is predictable, it is in most every type movie like this. It is pretty rare if this type movie alters the game plan. So, the big question is...how well does the movie deliver til the end and this movie does a pretty good job.

 Acting: Well done from all involved. A lot of top rated actors are in this movie. Biggest positive surprise was Melissia Leo who plays the Secetary of Defense, Ruth McMillan. She does an excellect job. Biggest negative surprise was Aaron Eckhard. Although I am an Eckhart fan, I don't think he had enough to do in this movie and overacted his part. Gerard Butler pretty much has the same role in most of his movies.....kick butt and swoon the ladies.

 Writing: They didn't waste a lot of time/money on scripts. However, I didn't expect great writing. I expected to see Butler beat up some bad guys and save the world all by himself. He does.

 Family friendly: This movie is intense. Lots of fighting, gun fights, stabbings, beatings, etc. A few of the gun shot deaths were fairly graphic. The ""F"" word is used a lot along with a few other cuss words. With that being said, this movie is a lot less offensive than many others I have seen. Nothing sexually explicit. Just fighting and cussing.

 Computer generated imagery: Appropriate for a movie of this calibur. Some of the gunfire special effects were pretty neat. One shot of the White House was obviously a minature model. So, decent special effects.

 Overall: Of the movies I have watched lately, this one is at the top of the list. It is not a thinking man's movie. It's an action packed thriller and on that part, it delivers pretty well. So, 4 stars.",1376784000,,1716,4.517799352750809
5601027,3,B00BEIYHT2,"A good film to see on a movie night. Lots of action, heavy body count, and great premise. However, there are certain character actions that are too unbelievable. If such a situation would occur, I find it hard to believe the govt would fall on it's knee to save the President or anyone else given the stakes involved. So, that alone makes the plot very difficult to swallow.

The film reminded me very much of Die Hard: the fallen Outsider turned to be Hero whose working on the inside to take down the bad guys one by one. I do have to say, it does work for this drama.

The Acting President (Morgan Friedman) doesn't seem to grasp the bigger picture and seems to go with ""the needs of the one outway the needs of the many"". Very unrealistic for a would-be Acting President. Isn't his responsibility to protect the country even if it entails the unfortunate loss of life - regardless of who's life that is?

At least the villains weren't the stereotypical radical Islamists this time. Time to reintroduce Asian villains I guess - at least they didn't speak English with very bad Asian accents. Like in Die Hard, we don't get to know a lot about the terrorists.

Overall, it was a decent action packed and suspenseful film, if not a bit contrived. A good film to pick on a Saturday night.",1376784000,3,1288,4.468085106382978

Angela basett's favorite refrain the entire movie is ""OH, my God!"" total deadpan. Gerard butler's nurse wife delivers her lines as if she's nurse betty in a giggly sing song voice. As if the white house and earth are no where near total annihilation! Bizarre. Gerard delivers a solid performance. but there's no way he can carry the entire film. Bottom line save your cash.

5601083,2,B00BEIYHT2,"The writers are the failure point in this movie.  I think the actors/characters were more than capable of delivering a better movie, but the plot they were handed was horribly implausible, probably written in crayon.  Blame the writers, I do.

Throughout the whole movie, every view minutes I'd sit and think... ""Nope"" each time ANOTHER implausible plot point and decision would be reached.  Just too many to list.  I kept thinking,""just how stupid do you think your viewer is?""... until I saw the next scene and realized just how stupid these writers think the viewer is.

*** SLIGHT SPOILER ***
What is humorous (to my twisted sense of humor) is how the writers chose to wrap the movie action up in a last scene that brilliantly showed their incompetence and lack of fundamental understanding of, well, everything!  In this scene, after all the drama is wrapped up, the hero reports in to central command that the all bad guys are dead, the president is alive and has a gunshot wound...  do the hundreds of military on site rush the White House to secure it?  Nope.  Do medical teams rush to the white house to save the president?  Nope.  Does anyone do anything?!  Nope. Instead, the hero and the president (again, with a serious bullet wound) have to walk up from the bunker, through the white house, and onto the steps at the front and THEN all the geared up special services guys come to get them... all so the writers can have the glorious scene of the wounded president walking out into sunlight.

In lot of ways the move ""The Core"" is more believable than this movie.
I also read some reviews taking about Red Dawn,  well the 2012 remake is pretty bad.  Yes these movies have special effects, but where is the content that makes movie great.

5601087,4,B00BEIYHT2,This movie was like a video game campaign.  It has one guy who essentially works his way through the white house.  It has stop and go action almost like he was playing chapters of a campaign.  It reminded me of a call of duty mission where you have to retake the white house.  The beginning with the AC130 I could easily believe but other than that it was too easy to take out all the security guarding the white house.  I guess they wouldn't have much of a movie if that part took too long though.  There are some good scenes when someone acts heroically.  This is not a comedy and takes a more serious action plot than others.  If you are in it for the action then this is your movie but if you like a little something else mixed in it might not be as great to you.

It's a rip off of films (far better ones), like Patriot Games, Die Hard 1,2,3, In the Line of Fire...the list could go on. The script just about passes without us noticing the well-worn dialogue cliches. The acting requires the actors to turn up, and they do; Morgan Freeman does stoic, wise & immovable like no other, Butler knows what he is and Ekhart probably wishes he was in more films like Erin Brockovich and The Dark Knight. There is NOTHING surprising in this film only a formulaic brand of blood, explosions and dead bodies neatly capped off  with the typical American Flag ripped to shreds before being raised anew and revitalized.

""Give us the code."" -- ""NO!""

5601116,1,B00BEIYHT2,"In a nutshell, the movie is 99% predictable, the plot so simple a 2 year old could figure it out, and I bet Tom Clancy is laughing his sides out.
Here is the basic formula for its failure:

1) The bad guys are the only ones capable of hitting the side of a barn when they shoot their weapons.

2) The Police are a bunch of cannon fodder, and mindless drones.

3) The Secret Service agents all dress and act cool, but with the exception of 2 agents, cannot hit the side of a barn, cannot fight, and are pretty much unskilled labor.

4) The U.S. Army looks cool...that's about it.

5) U.S. Air Force jets have the war fighting  capability of a WWI bi-plane.

6) A C-130 with expensive fireworks and a bunch of cool machine guns can defeat almost everything.

7) Washington DC's Air Defenses consist of 2 missile launchers that can only fire 2 shots each, have limited radar with a range of about 1 mile.

8) The White House has no defenses, except for a wrought iron fence that can be taken out with a firecracker.

9) The FAA, Norad, FBI, CIA, NSA, and pretty much any government security, military, or law enforcement entity is unable to realize that a C-130 flying into restricted air space is suspicious, until it gets really close to the White House. What would have happened if the bad guys used a private jet? I bet no one would have noticed.....but, when your storyline is so poor as in this movie, heck...might as well use a B1 Bomber...no one will notice until its too late!

10) The bad guys are so smart, all they had to do was distract 99% of Law Enforcement, Secret Service, and all branches of the military and pretty much 99% of Washington DC's population, so that they all LOOK UP at the C-130, pointing their pistols at it, while an army of Garbage Trucks invade the capital with bad guys and their superior weapons hidden inside as they descend on the White House! LOL!

11) As previously mentioned, the Secret Service is portrayed as a bunch of vision impaired sloths, can you imagine how funny it was after an hour of seeing that, when the House Speaker is informed he is the acting president and under ""Secret Service Protection"", at which...two cool and tough looking agents step next to the Speaker of the House quite snappy and professionally....ummm I bet Morgan Freeman felt VERY SAFE!

12) The big group of VIP's in the Operation's Center do a really good job of holding their heads in their hands, and exchanging looks of complete surprise and dumbfoundness, over EVERYTHING the bad guys do...apparently, the plot is not 99% predictable to them.

13) No ambulance can reach the White House even after all the bad guys are dead...

14) Snipers can only look cool and use their scopes to look at the bad guys....and the bad guys are so confident in the dumbness of the snipers, military, secret service, etc, that they just kind of casually walk around talking.

15) The bad guys are smart enough to figure out where the Hero was hiding, but not smart enough to follow him.

16) The Hero is the only guy that can fight, shoot, and think.

17) The Joint Chief of Staff...an Army General is in total shock over how America's Nuclear weapons are secured. He even says ""What the heck is that?!?"" When looking at the pretty map showing where are nukes are.

18) No one knows what to do except the Speaker of the House Morgan Freeman, who's first command is to ""Secure our Nukes""!

19) There is a super secret U.S. weapon system that can defend against any type of air borne threat...too bad no one uses it or has it except the bad guys, and no one knows how they got it...apparently, it was too good to defend the White House with it or better yet all of Washington DC.

That's all I can think of for now...if you are looking for a good Tom Clancy type movie this is NOT it....in fact, any of the Rambo movies provide more of a intellectual challenge...in fact, the First Rambo movie - 'First Blood' is frankly 1000 times better than this movie.",1376697600,32,3965,4.45643153526971

5601143,5,B00BEIYHT2,"""Olympus Has Fallen"" is definitely worth your time viewing--maybe even three times! The casting is excellent, the story is sufficiently believable, and the location is great.

So, I'll start with location. Shreveport, LA has become a film mecca. This must be Gerard Butler's third or fourth film here, this one his co-production (or with several producers). Butler plays Mike Banning, a Secret Service man who loses the president's wife early in the story and is ostracized to the Treasury Department, not his fault, but because of bad memories. This position leaves Banning in a situation to save the day, so to speak. I've seen Butler in all his movies and think this is his second best role (after ""300""). His face is showing age, a good thing in this film because it makes him experienced. Anyway, when he walks down a street, I recognized my hometown's streets and trees. That makes for a fun movie, looking for local places.

Many previous reviewers compared ""Olympus Has Fallen"" with the ""Die Hard"" series. I suppose the comparison can be made--the lone police official miked in to outside support and becoming an inevitable hero. Butler has a number of heroic, bold lines comparable to Willis's lines. Yeah, I must agree, the comparison is legit.

Aaron Eckhert plays the president well enough, with good ol' Morgan Freeman as acting president. However, the most significant aspect of the film is the plot by a Korean terrorist group to take over the White House (Olympus has fallen). Since ads reveal all this, I have not. My vote for best actor of the film is Rick Yune, the Korean leader.

My biggest problem with the movie is the love story between Banning and his wife. There was no spark there at all. I found it a bit disturbing. Apparently, this was a couple at their plodding point, so I'm not sure why it was included.

If you're a Butler fan, a follower of political intrigue and evil plots, love a good action flick, ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is a wise use of your time and money.",1376697600,2,1995,4.721264367816092

5601150,5,B00BEIYHT2,"What to say. You couldn't ask for a better action movie with a great cast. Sure the whole plot was a bit absurd, I have more faith in our military and the response teams to protect the president and the white house than was shown in the opening siege. I know for a fact that a bogey c130 would never had made it into dc causing the damage it did before being taking down, regardless if it had USAF markings on it. They would not have asked the plane to turn around, it would have been shot down immediately. .... You can't make this movie out to be some political statement or look for deep thought about the characters or society. It was non stop action thriller in a hypothetical situation, one that would never happen but fun to watch. Now bein said, the acting president would never had ordered the 7th fleet to withdrawal to save the lives of the president and his cabinet, nor would he have withdrawn the troops from the dmz. If such a Cerberus device exist those people would have died before giving up a secret code. True they are only human and humans are fallible, but I like to think that as a proud American each one would have died before givin up the first two codes, and the president would have let them die to save the country and the world. So yeah this movie takes some giant leaps into the insane and absurd, but not everyone in our government is a snowden traitor; and its still enjoyable. What I did believe is the strength and character Butler's character portrayed, our boys are trained well and can kick ass all over the world. The fight scenes were epic. Yes it was bloody but it couldn't be any other way in this scenario. Will I watch this movie again, hoora, yes I will with the surround sound up louder.  Would loved to have seen in the credits America's response with full scale invasion of North Korea, or more so nuclear devastation of its insane ass leaders. Im sure all the terrorist and mullahs out there loved the first half of the movie,its like their wet dream, but GOD BLESS AMERICA cause Gerard saves the day.

overall. great ""ACTION"" movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat.",1376697600,,2122,4.383248730964467
5601151,4,B00BEIYHT2,"First of all this is an action movie, it is not going to win any awards for screenplay or acting despite the amount of talent on the screen and the pro acting that talent always brings with it. Got that out of the way, on to the actual movie.

The plot, real and scary as they try to make it, is just far fetched and even a little silly. I cannot say why without giving things away, even if it is an action flick there are still some pretty cool twists here and there you may or may not see coming.

The plot and the way the White House is taken is pure fantasy, if you can just get that in your head now you can enjoy the movie. Not cheesy, but just not realistic either. If you are military minded at all you will know some of the things that happen in this movie just won't take place in real life. Now that's out of the way, we can enjoy this well done action flick.

It is all about the actors and the characters here and what drives them. This isn't some silly one man army hero doing things for truth, justice, and the America way. Banning (Gerard Butler) really cares about the people he is protecting and the sanctity of what the White House is, and what he does during his heroics are real enough with some great fights scenes. The character development overall is very well done for a action movie of this type. Again the main thing that makes the movie tick is you believe why Banning is doing what he does, and you will see why when you watch it.

Bottom line, if you are looking for a cool action flick and don't mind putting aside your Jane's Defense Weekly magazine for a couple hours to watch it, you should enjoy this movie.",1376697600,,1642,4.154088050314465

Upon further review and watch action, action, action again, I came to the conclusion, this was not about an attack on the White HOuse, but a propaganda film for the projection of brownie power.  Who came out on top?  The Speaker of the House, a brownie.  They want Americans to believe, that only they have the power to save us.  This is what Hitler did prior to WWII, convincing the populous he was the savior and to follow his storm troopers to victory.

The fact that only 2 jets intercepted a C130 in restricted airspace was hard to believe and then only 2 more jets were sent out when the first two were shot down was hard to believe but I held my breath and just accepted the story line on that.  Then there was the ground assault where trained agents had a shoot out with the terrorists and the trained agents just stood out in the open and shot at the terrorists...why that is the most dysfunctional way to firefight I have seen.  Those agents should have been in the prone position, shooting, since it was clear they had no ground cover but instead they just stood and shot bullets.

5601239,2,B00BEIYHT2,"Die Hard meets Air Force One in this logically-challenged raid on the White House that sees 60 minutes of Aaron Eckhart in handcuffs and every Asian stuntman in Hollywood getting stabbed or shot at by the only Scotsman in the Secret Service. Olympus Has Fallen is bad almost from the first frame, delivering Michael Bay-quality set ups with a score so over the top with military beats and heroic drums that it makes Independence Day look like Top Gun on the Fourth of July. I enjoyed counting the foreshadowing moments through the entire first act almost as much as the drinking game I'd invented where you have to take a shot every time somebody talks in exposition (you'd actually need a serious liver to take on this challenge).

Plot-wise, there really isn't one beyond the North Koreans invading the White House. They take out the entire US Air Force of two jets with machine guns while every police officer and Secret Service agent forgets their training and runs out into a hail of bullets to get killed as fast as possible. Gerard Butler meanwhile performs a recreation of Clint Eastward from In The Line of Fire without the wit and jazz while Dylan McDermott actually plays the same character from the same film, but this time he's a traitor.

It's really hard to care much about what happens partly because of the non-existent characterization but also because the CGI is some of the worst in living memory and distracted me every time it appeared. Seeing as you can get pictures of the White House online, it's amazing that none of the shots in the film look anything like the main building itself, and there are video games with better CG shots than this. It's also somewhat tragic watching some great actors literally paying their rent and snoozing their performances throughout the flick.

If you're looking for some brainless entertainment for a weekend evening, this unfortunately isn't it. There's plenty of brainless but the whole experience is so bad I'd much rather watch the good films it rips off badly.",1376611200,5,2025,4.796561604584527

2. Are the Secret Service really in EVERY room at Camp David and the White House?

3. Only 2 fighter jets sent out when a gigantic plane flies towards the White House?

4. Not one of the Secret Service agents appears to be wearing a bullet proof vest. Instead they are all just carrying hand guns and get taken out very quickly. On the other hand the terrorists are all SWAT style and much better organized.

5. The White House is the most protected building in the world and yet it takes the military 15 minutes to show up?

I am not going to attempt to address the 1-star ratings here. If you read my reviews you know that I am a harsh critic that gives honest, fair assessments so that my fellow AMAZON shoppers can rely on my reviews for sure-footed guidance.

Rather, I will tell you that this movie delivered far more than I expected from it. And frankly, I expected a lot with a cast that includes Freeman, Butler, Basset, Judd, Hauser, McDermott, Yune, and Eckhart.

PARTIAL SPOILER ALERT!  It is a war movie more than anything, but not the typical war movie. The plot is fairly straight-forward, but this is not a mystery thriller. Some complained that it is predictable, aren't 99% of movies? We know the good guy will win and ride off into the sunset 99% of the time. This is one of those movies in which the good guy wins. I never expect the hero to be killed, so it is beyond me why that offended some viewers. But haters must hate I suppose.

If you are looking for a very high-tension, suspenseful action movie with a tremendous amount of gunfire, explosions and hand-to-hand combat, this is the perfect movie for you. Did you see that M-word?  Yeah, it is a M O V I E!  So watch it without over thinking ""Gee would that really happen?""  Really?  Would a giant gorilla climb the Empire State Building and do battle with biplanes? Would a millionaire bachelor and his young legal ward dawn capes, masks, and tights, and set about fighting crime in Gotham City? You get the idea.

Just relax and enjoy this great action movie.

This coming from a person that is forced to stream a LOT of B movies from another service that starts with N.

On a positive note, the fight scenes and action however are excellent. Very well choreographed, so if you want to turn your brain off and watch, feel free!

Is the story unbelievable to me?  No, not really, just the exectution of the idea is really poor, with stupid assumptions.

This movie is treated like the old tried and true hostage negotiation movie.

The characters are captured, the people negotating with the capturers are torn between the decisions they are forced to make about the demands the terrorists make, and the safety of thier colleugues and friends, and what the stakes may be if they do what the bad guys ask....

However, in this movie, we are talking about the President, and Madam sectretary, and all of the responsibility they hold.

The stakes are, let someone harm the president, and his cabinet members, or most assuradley let the entire United States and all of North American be completely vulnerable to nuclear attack, let an entire country be invaded and destroyed almost instantly by recalling an entire naval fleet out of an area of strategic interest to an enemy in a matter of hours, and removing border troops.

One would think it should be an easy decision for the people in power protecting the nation to make.

One man and two cabinet members, or the possibly 313 million people perish???

One man and two of his cabinet members, or an entire country gets invaded upsetting the balance of an entire hemephere of the world?

Oh that's a toughy....

Oh yeah, sorry folks, this is a fleet of HUGE, heavy naval ships.  It takes DAYS to recall a navel fleet out of an area, not um hours....  It would take DAYS for the fleet not to be a threat to the aggressor nation.

Sorry, but even the president is supposed to be placed less important than the population of the United States, and our country....

The SECOND that the president was comprimissed, you had better hope that the people that power falls to, do what is in YOURS, and your families best interest, and quickly.

I just can't believe that there aren't people in power that could make these calls immediatly, so I just can't put myself in the story.

It just is too silly.

I didn't stream this here, I paid a dollar to rent it overnight and I wished I hadn't.

Except (according to the writers of this movie) when it does. There is lots of great action, and a heroic kid. Heroic kid, YAWN. I suppose on blu-ray with the volume turned all the way down....Hey!

I thought maybe there would be some more character development or more on the relationships between the characters, but instead the movie ended with none of that.
I did, however, watch this whole movie, and it was mildly entertaining.

If you like movies that are full of action, lots and lots of shooting at people, and an action packed plot, but not much else than that, then this movie will be great for you!

5601449,3,B00BEIYHT2,"I must say I love the action, the special effects, stuff blowing up, and most of the story line.  This movie only gets 3 stars from me because there are several things that I don't think would happen in real life.  There is one common theme throughout the entire movie that I think is realistic--that our government and military SOMETIMES are so pompous and arrogant that they sacrifice themselves and others rather than to swallow their pride and do the right thing, whatever that right thing is.  Of course, that's just my opinion.  I didn't think any one actor stood out as being fantastic.  I am a Butler fan, tho, for his role in GAMER.  I thot he did a great job there.  Anyway, this movie is worth watching once, at least.  I really think this movie was a recycling of an old idea (see below), and was engineered to get a bunch of older actors some work.

SCROLL DOWN FOR SPOILER

*** partial SPOILER ***

First, let me say I'm not Secret Service or ever intend to be, so I don't know the exact protocol, but I don't think the President, his wife, his son, and his most trusted Secret Service would go out in a wicked snowstorm like they did at the beginning of the movie.  Next, I find it hard to believe that our President would take Koreans into the bunker at the White House.  Most likely, they would go to an area separate from the President and his family and high-end officials.  Next, I doubt the President would tell Admiral what's-his-name to give out his Cerebrus code.  The same goes for his Secretary of Defense (or whatever she was).  The pompousness on the part of the President was that he said, ""oh, they'll never get my code"", so you 2 can go ahead and give him your code.  Total BS, in my opinion.  We do not (or should not) negotiate with terrorists.  They are never to be trusted, duh...  Their intent was to kill off all or most of the hostages, anyway.  Also, that the General sent in 5 or 6 SEAL teams to their deaths was really stupid.  He's got a guy on the inside who is telling him to hold on for a few minutes while the situation gets checked out.  Most people in their right mind would not sacrifice several teams of the most highly trained operators just because of pride and arrogance, but SOMETIMES they might.  This movie reminds me a lot of Steven Seagal's Under Seige, except that was a battleship with Tomahawks on it.  Great movie, btw, from about 20 years ago, lol.  So, this is just a recycling of old ideas for people in the next ""generation"" who never watched Under Seige or anything like it.  Also, to remove 25,000+ troops and the 7th Fleet from a ""peace-keeping"" duty most likely would not happen.  I'm thinking the President or Speaker would not risk the lives of those people we were there to protect, but you never know...  I am aware that people in positions of authority sometimes have to make tough decisions that turn out to be bad decisions.  I just felt like a lot of people were making bad decision after bad decision in this movie.  That's Hollywood for ya, lol.  I watched it, tho, and I would watch it again somtime when in the mood.",1376438400,10,3098,4.399647887323944
5601450,3,B00BEIYHT2,"Gerard Butler shoots and stabs everything that moves.  The premise is entertaining enough and the action is relentless!  There are a couple of quick passes in the script to try adding character depth but only just.  I like Gerard Butler but he's give a pretty one dimensional character to play.  It made me think of 'Die Hard' in the white house... which could have been the pitch to the studio.  The thing Die Hard had going for it was a way snappier script lots of action but leavened with some really funny lines... ""yippie-ki-ya-mutherf..."" that offset the serious action.  So, what I'm saying is... if you think of Die Hard and take out all the fun parts, turn up the knob on the action to 11 then you have Olympus Has Fallen.",1376438400,3,731,4.5

Sure it makes for a more exciting action film, but the ethical consequence would be appalling in real life.

Its story line is a little light, and yes there times when people are dying and then they magically get up and can run/fight full speed again. Basically if you saw the trailer and know what you are getting in to, you will like this movie.

A speaker of the House so hapless that he gives up a country to war to ""save"" the President ? A General , who when faced with advanced weaponry of our own manufacture, is so uninformed that he send in the Seals as cannon fodder ? A rogue agent who when faced with death experiences a deathbed conversion and says "" I lost my way"" ?
The oh so predictable script, the endless stream of cliche's, the poor CGI effects. Whoever wrote and directed this effort is not familiar with America, our customs and our culture. Or perhaps they were just in a hurry to put out a quick shoot em up. Butlers acting and handling of the action scenes was fine. The rest of the movie.... meh.",1376352000,3,949,4.337078651685394

I had to pause the movie at least 30 times ranting about how beyond stupid it was.

SPOILERS (warning, I don't know technical terms):

1. A military grade airplane enters DC airspace without authorization and the US fighter planes that intercept keep warning and warning and warning and warning and warning and warning that if the plane doesn't turn back it will be shot down until the unknown plane shoots them down.
2. When said plane shoots up DC, people stand in the middle of the street and watch until they get shot.
3. The White House is under attack and the Secret Service guys run into the lawn instead of running for cover. They also keep flooding out the front doors getting picked off in rapid succession like rats abandoning a sinking ship and yet they keep running out. Also, no SS or police are wearing bullet proof vests.
4. The White House, which is described in the movie as the most secure building in the world, is easily taken over by terrorists. In the meantime, the military takes it's time getting there. The entire White House is taken over before they bother to show up.
5. The only person who has managed to kill any of the terrorists is the hero of the movie because apparently he is the only trained SS officer. The rest are ripe for the picking.

And the movie's concept of a system above the nuclear launching system that cannot be changed and only requires three passcodes known by three people is ridiculous. You don't build the highest level of control around your entire nuclear arsenal with single-factor authentication.  Three required passcodes is redundant single-layer authentication, not multi-layer authentication as the current nuclear launching system already is. This movie is nothing more than progressive liberal Hollywood's attempt to incite terrorism-mania and justify the current suspension of civil liberties.

Sure It's unreal in terms of the plausibility of the plot but we watch movies to be entertained (at least I do). It really is Die Hard in the White House but with more close combat scenarios and brain teasers. Gerard Butler really made it feel as if he is the perfectly trained Secret Service Agent to do the job. My only gripe with the movie was the CGI for the opening aerial attack scene. They dropped the ball on that which is why I rate it a 4.5. However the movie is chilling, thrilling, and got good comedic feel to an action movie which is Why I really liked it.

5601674,4,B00BEIYHT2,"100x better than white house down. One of the best action sequences I have ever seen is the initial assault.

This movie could just have easily been a die-hard movie. It has a fanatic terrorist,several goons, a hostage standoff, an obvious twist. There however is no offbeat sidekick to the main star, like a die hard movie would have.

It very much an action movie. Limited on character development, and with several plot elements that are a bit obvious. But you are not watching for Shakespeare are you? No you want explosions, fighting, and bad guys getting taken out. This movie has all that. After the first 20 minutes or so, there is some kind of fight every 5 minutes or so for the remainder of the movie. Pretty cool sequences.

The initial assault sequence is one of the best live action sequences I have seen. On par with a D-day assault in saving private Ryan. Really an amazing action scene.

Anyway, if you like action movies this one is top of the line. The only thing it is missing to make it 5 star is a sidekick, all great action hero's should have a sidekick of some kind.",1375833600,,1090,4.4623115577889445

Are we Brits or are we Americans according to this movie?!?!? By that I mean geez, all the SS cats here stand right in the line of fire. Stand there. And the plane in the beginning? Sorry. I don't buy it living more than 15 seconds, I don't care how many decoy rounds it throws. Puleeze.

That flying antique absolutely would not be flying that long. If it did in a real situation? I'd move to another country. No joke.

Now. All that said, it's a good piece, with the emotional elements as well as current events in the story line - particularly with the very very bad guys we are looking straight in the eyes, right now. Right darn now.

There are certainly parts that we should pay attention to and heck, enjoy in this movie - the vehicles involved, the allowed random visitors in particularly sensitive government areas...all these and more should be limited, or at best, any access eliminated in real life. This is my opinion, of value to only me, by the way. Now, onward. Our USA is not as safe as it was once upon a time, and this is a good - but thankfully a not entirely accurately reflected depiction of what we COULD deal with.

If it were the real deal? Not good. That type scenario is deflected daily, for real.

So, I give this terrifically action-packed movie a reluctant 3 star review - and again, wish it were 5. However. If that were the case....well, we'd simply be telling those northern bad guys what the heck to do, step by step, in Panavision Technicolor, no less, now wouldn't we? Ahhh, media today.

5601677,4,B00BEIYHT2,"There's kind of a modern trend in the past several years of action films becoming something else. Superheroes, science fiction (and I'm talking Transformers not District 9) or apocalyptic action seem to be dominating the scene. Nothing wrong with these films, but the glory days of the films that made the stars of the Expendables famous, pure action films, are gone. Die Hard, Air Force One, Commando, these films aren't really made as much anymore.

Which is why I'm glad this movie is made. And it's also made well. It's a 70 million dollar action flick, and in this day and age, that's cheap. It's not an attempt to start or continue a franchise, it's just a straightforward self-contained and while contrived, ORIGINAL, film. Terrorists take over the White House, John McClane stand-in Gerard Butler takes them out. Spectacle, visual, and violence ensue. And the film thankfully doesn't pull it's punches. It's hard hitting, violent, and exactly what we needed to fill in that gap.

It's a solid film. The acting is fine, the characters don't make retarded decisions left and right. It's not the greatest movie ever but it's exactly what it wants to be. Worst part of the movie is some scenes are pretty poorly lit and it's hard to see what's going on. Otherwise, crack a beer, kick back, and watch some asses get kicked.

I wrote a review on how bad this move actually is and Amazon deleted the review.

I do not know if they will post this at all but, if they do post it, please know this movie is one of the most ridiculous and one of the saddest piece of movie making I have ever seen.  I am a movie buff but, I am sick of these non-American movies trying to get us use to the White House or the Capital Building, or Washington D.C. Being attacked.  Myself and many people I know and many people they know are sickened by movies like this.

This is one of the most ridiculous and  unrealistic movies I have ever seen period.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.

If you have had this problem with Amazon, please comment on this review.

It wasn't too over the top as most action flicks these days devolve into. It was a little unbelievable in that 1. North Koreans being capable of said operation and 2. said events actually happening at the White House. The White house is the most secure building in the entire world. It would have been more believable if they had decended on the Penatgon while the president was visiting it, but Cest' La Vie. The lead was believable and the President was likable. Even the crochety lead agent who utters ""Olympus has Fallen"" as he died was not over the top. I can just about imagine a lead Secret Service agent doing the same. I would have given it more stars but I felt it was a little short and there was just not enough Morgan Freeman.",1375056000,3,908,4.315789473684211

5601713,4,B00BEIYHT2,"I admit it, I got sucked into 'Olympus Has Fallen' from the first, fairly nail-biting scene.  The film's come under a lot of criticism both for its ""anti-Asian sentiment"" (bull-crap, the bad guys here are North Korean, giving the Middle Easterners a break for once ... and let's face it, lately the North Koreans haven't been so friendly in real life either.  The other critique comes from the supposedly unbelievable plotting, starting with no less than Gerard Butler's character singlehandedly fighting an army of armed professional killers ... but to me, for films like this a suspension of belief is mandatory; you have to just set logic aside and enjoy from the gut.  This film is like 'Die Hard at the White House' and it grabs and holds you for its entire two-hour run.

Gerard Butler plays Mike Banning, bodyguard to no less than the President of the United States (Aaron Eckhart) ... until a tragedy not of Banning's making gets Mike relegated to a desk job at the Treasury a year later.  But when the White House itself comes under siege by a veritable army that strikes by air, land and even from within, as the body count grows way into double digits it comes down to Banning and his inside knowledge of both the White House and President to make his way into the captured 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, making his way down to the underground bunker where the President remains captive.

Films speak best to me when the plot or characters are so real that I become engaged in what's going to happen next.  With 'Olympus Has Fallen' if you're seeking deep plot or characterization then BOY are you watching the wrong film.  But once in awhile, much as you like filet mignon, a fat hamburger piled high with toppings just yells comfort food - and that's what this film did for me.  PURE propaganda, mindless action/violence, and an adrenaline-charged homage to America are what you have hear, and damnit but it's just sort of a blast to watch.  Also very involving; at times, the more they destroyed and desecrated the White House, as an American it was such a violation, I found myself fairly itching to tear into the screen and rip the faces off the bad guys for destroying such an iconic symbol of the USA.  It was an unnerving feeling, but I ran with it, jazzing up my adrenaline even more for a film that's brainless and silly and as far-fetched as Kim Kardashian getting a Master's degree ... but damnit, still so freaking engaging from start to finish.",1374883200,2,2464,4.654377880184332

Entertainment, and I enjoyed it!  The North Koreans found a way to take over the White House in 15 seconds flat, and in the process, leave a lot of bodies behind.  To make matters worse, they start shooting at civilians from planes.  The plan here was to reduce the United States to another Korea.  In walks Gerard Butler, former agent, who, singlehandedly, take back the House and leave the enemies bodies behind like fodder.  It was really action packed and on a lazy afternoon with nothing on cable, this was a real action movie that served it purpose.  WAY TO GO, GERARD!!!",1374624000,11,724,4.6299212598425195
5601715,1,B00BEIYHT2,"The plot behind this movie has been released by Hollywood hundreds, if not thousands of times already.  If you've seen Steven Seagal in Under Siege, then you've seen this movie.  Same plot, just substitute ship Captain with president and SEAL with Special Forces, and you have the exact same movie.  The main difference is that this one has tons of really horrible CGI, so it's actually worse.  Apparently North Korea is the boogie man of this decade, so you have to throw them in the mix.  No one remotely connected to this movie bothered to do any research into what a Special Forces soldier does; not the writer, director, producer or anyone else.

There's not any sense in writing more about this movie, but there is one parting thought that should be made.  If you want a believable plot or realism to any degree then this movie is not for you.

5601718,1,B00BEIYHT2,"This film shows all of the hallmark features of american propaganda. The plot unfolds like this - innocent USA attacked yet again by blood thirsty 'terrorists', brave American super soldier (Gerard Butler is actually Scottish and read law at Glasgow university!) takes on an army of bad guys and kills them all, saves the good ol' US president, stops nuclear desolation, saves the day and goes back to his mundane desk job. Oh phooey!. Oh dear!. Come on Hollywood, why do you keep on banging the same propagandist drum?. I am getting so fed up and even offended by the Hollywood propaganda machine. These guys never tire of demonising foreign people. First the Russians, then the Arabs and Islam for over three decades might I add, then the Hispanics, then the Chinese, Japanese and now the Koreans!. Even Brits are always portrayed as villains!. Have you ever noticed that?!. I would not be at all surprised if the Koreans found this film hurtful (even offensive, and I cant say I blame them).

However, there is a question I want Hollywood to answer. I understand that a lot of Americans will not like what I have to say (but you guys need to learn to accept constructive criticism!). Why is it that Hollywood NEVER makes films about REAL LIFE TERRORISTS?. If one looks at historical fact, then it is eye wateringly clear that America and Israel have been very, very naughty indeed. Do you need some convincing?. Okay then, let us not forget one of the most heinous act of brutality and terrorism ever committed in recorded history when america nuked Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Sadly, tens of thousands of innocent Japanese civilians (men, women and children) were killed in the actual explosion and subsequent nuclear fallout. Millions more were made refugees. Let us also not forget the american owned union carbide atrocity in Bhopal, India in December 1984 in which the chemical leak killed over 100,000 people and left tens of thousands more crippled for life. To this day, usa has refused to pay a single cent out of the $2 billion compensation rightfully owed to the victims. Let us also not forget american 'war of terror' in the middle east, where journalists and eye witnesses have reported that american soldiers regularly partake in 'weekend rape rallies' in Iraq and Afghanistan (teenage girls especially are singled out). Let us not forget numerous eye witness reports (and I know this from dialogue with Afghani and Iraqi refugees, as I do charity work and help homeless people) that it is the American soldiers that are behind the whole 'suicide car bombing' fiasco in Iraq and Afghanistan whereby american soldiers stop taxi drivers at checkpoints, take them away for 'interview' whilst their colleagues plant explosives in the taxi. The innocent victim is released, drives back into town and the americans who are following him, detonate the explosives and then call it 'Arab suicide bombers'. I find it very interesting that 'suicide bombing' only took root once the americans illegally invaded Iraq and Afghanistan ('suicide bombing' was unheard of when Saddam Hussein was in power!).

Let us also not forget Zionist terrorism, which is funded directly by usa. All of the wmd's in Israel are 'donated' by america. In fact, for four decades, Israel has refused to sign the 'non proliferation treaty' (endorsed by the UN), as Israel refuses to declare the extent of it's biological, nuclear and chemical arsenal. Indeed, Israel has the largest stockpile of wmd's in the world!. Let us also not forget Israeli terrorism and the use of banned weapons the likes of 'white phosphorus bombs', which is banned by UN convention as a lethal chemical weapon, yet usa flaunts UN law and supplies these banned weapons to israel, which in turn uses these deadly weapons with impunity to murder innocent Palestinian civilians (especially children).

So then why is it that the racist, hate preaching, movie machine that is Hollywood, does not make REAL films about REAL LIFE TERRORISTS?. Why is it that the hollywood movie machine propagates racism, discrimination and demonisation of ethnic groups?. Just read 'Reel bad Arabs, how hollywood vilifies a people' by Jack Shaheen and also 'Why do people hate America?' by Merryl Wynn Davies and you will know what I mean. I understand a lot of americans are going to be very offended by my review and no doubt I will receive a lot of abusive and racist emails (which proves my assertion further) but you know what?. This sort of review needs to be posted. Do you think I am just going to blindly accept silly, racist propaganda or do you think I am going to sit down and look at all of the historical and political facts and then make up my mind?. I will let you make up your own minds (and the points I have raised is something you guys should seriously think about).

What really bothers me is the social effect of racist Hollywood propaganda and brain washing. How many uneducated americans, are convinced by these racist and fraudulent films?. How many americans go out in the streets and openly abuse and even attack innocent muslim men, women and children?. I have read many online news reports of this happening yet there has been no documented psychological study into this particular area (unlike the well documented studies of pornography and violence or violent video games/movies and violence). This is something worth looking into.

It is high time the Zionist controlled movie machine (hollywood) stopped making racist films or be held legally accountable for the vast amount of racist filth it has been churning out for the last several decades. So Hollywood, stop making racist films as it is not only very disrespectful and offensive but it is most probably encouraging violence against ethnic minorities.",1373760000,,5773,4.929085303186023

5601742,5,B00BEIYHT2,"This is one really good movie. What if the White House was in real danger? What if the President faced a more dangerous threat than war? Enter the movie entitled: Olympus Has Fallen

Olympus Has Fallen has a very strong cast that consists of Aaron Eckhart as President Asher, Gerard Butler as Mike Banning, the beautiful Angela Basset as Lynne Jacobs, Morgan Freeman as Speaker Alan Trumbull, and Rick Yune as the main antagonist, Kang Yeonsak.

To describe the story: It starts off with President Asher and Mike Banning who are having a bit of friendly sparring match; thus it is pretty obvious early on that the President and Mike has close ties with each other. However, while on the road one night the unthinkable happens, and things take an unexpected turn.

Now fast forward a year and 6 months later, Mike no longer has the close ties he once had with the President, but he still works at the treasury department. I will stop there because I do not want to write the movie detail by detail. I will say that while the President is in a meeting with North Koreans, a hostage crisis occurs directly within the White House. Thus, we are given a high octane, thrill made for eyes type of movie.

I admired everything about Olympus Has Fallen. Aaron Eckhart's previous film Battle LA was not the best, but he makes up for it in this one. The story is addictive, the acting is top notch, and for a movie of its genre, Olympus Has Fallen Shines.

In short, Olympus Has Fallen is Daringly bold and gloriously victorious. Feel free to agree or disagree, but on a scale of 1-10 Olympus Has Fallen gets a score of

I love movies involving politics and presidents (even if they are fake like Air Force One or the American President), and this one seemed exciting. While the plot and idea seem exciting the movie felt flat and even a little boring in parts. There was no real character development and it was hard to care about the hostages or even Banning doing what he was doing. The main problem I had with this is that it felt like a remake of Die Hard, without the wit or excitement. I could have just been my expectations but I was very disappointed in this movie.

Some scenes were engrossing. For example, the scene where the propelled plane used flares to distract the missiles was realistic and thrilling.

The attackers executed many thrilling distractions to ambush the security guards of the White house. What an exciting scene it was! These twists were new to me. I had never seen anything like them.

Then it turned into Die Hard in the White House. There's only one man against the bad guys. And he killed them all! It's predictable and farfetched but it's still enjoyable.

The relationship between Gerald and his wife was touching but it's too brief to make an impact.

According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this film:

Production Budget: $70 million
Domestic:  $98,925,640
+ Foreign:  $62,100,000
= Worldwide:  $161,025,640

So, in North America, its gross was around $98 million. Worldwide, its gross was approximately $161 million. That's huge. It's more than twice its production cost.

 In short, it's worth watching once because of the special effects, action and twists.",1372723200,6,1239,5.233502538071066
5601746,2,B00BEIYHT2,"The anxiety level in Hollywood must be through the roof. Why? Because everyone is obviously too terrified to create fresh, original and interesting movies. That's called creative and financial cowardice.

The movie in question, Olympus Has Fallen, is a preposterous, low-budget, reheated version of any Die Hard movie you care to name. We have been here many times before. Again, zero originality due to writers and producers being scared to death. Not only does the poorly written script contain enough plot holes to drive a truck through, there are a number of outright errors and contradictions. That's just pure laziness, people. The race to the bottom continues.

There are only two reasons to watch this movie: the presence of Ashley Judd, who lends an air of maximum class to any film she appears in, however briefly, and the incomparable Morgan Freeman, who makes any film worth watching for his unfailingly masterful performance.

Bottom line: Judd, gets a star, Freeman, also gets a star. The movie: zero stars.",1372636800,3,1021,5.1017964071856285

Just like Zero Dark Thirty, this film justifies torture.  There is a scene where two N. Koreans are captured and, somehow, with the use of torture one of them spills the beans instantly.  Sure.  People who are willing to die for their cause are so easy to break.  The CIA must love this film.

But don't worry.  Torture also works for the bad guys.  There are these Cerebrus codes or something that American leaders are just willing to give up so easily.  A minute of torture and they are ready to sacrifice the nation's defense systems and sing like canaries.

If that is not enough, there are over the top patriotic performances too.  One example is that there is this part where this woman is being dragged by her feet to her possible death.  Guess what she does?  She recites the Pledge of Allegiance.  Oh really?  This is the same woman that showed how great her allegiance was to her country by giving up her Cerebrus code so easily.

The film gets points for featuring one hell of an intense and prolonged siege sequence, it also goes back to basics by keeping things simple, some might see that as a liability but I personally found it refreshing and a nice throw back to the 80's and 90's style of things, Chuck Norris, Steven Segal, Bruce Willis, Arnie and Sly Stallone would have been right at home in this.

When this movie was coming out, it seemed like they were really selling the fact that Ashley Judd was in it...and she was only in the first 5 minutes of the movie! Maybe they were trying to entice people to see it, LOL.  I would've seen it just based on Morgan Freeman, Gerard Butler and Angela Bassett being in it.  I'm not too familiar with Aaron Eckert but he was good too; all the people were.  Definitely worth the time to watch, you won't regret it!!

This movie really is a fast paced, non-stop action, on the edge of your seat sort of movie.  At the end of the movie, you realize your heart is racing and you've been holding your breath through most of it.  There really is no dull moment in the movie.  Some parts I did cringe at but that's just me,(i.e. the beating of the defense secretary, which was relevant to the story and showed that women can be tough too).  My favorite scene is when Mike Banning has caught two of the terrorists, and has them tied up so he can make them talk. Absolutely love that scene (thank you, Butler)! If you liked the Die Hard series, you will definitely like this film.  I also think this is one of Gerard Butler's better roles;  I enjoyed most of his movies but (not to insult Mr. Butler), some of the last few movies he has done kind of made me wonder what happened to his career.  The guy is a good actor but he needs the right roles and playing Mike Banning was definitely the right role for him.  I hope he keeps it up by continuing to pick well written scripts.

One thing about this movie is that it does show that Americans can be tough/strong and can work together; which is very nice to see in a movie for a change.  One of the first things people may notice will be the toughness and obviously, the patriotic pride - though, some of them, not all....won't give away anything :-)  By the end of this movie, people were clapping.  My mom is an Air Force brat and grew up on bases around the world during the 50's & 60's, and is a supporter of soldiers and their families, she was really appreciative of Olympus Has Fallen and loved the fact that it showed strong Americans and that we won't take things sitting down; she has complained often that movies depict us as weak or dumb.  At the end of the movie (the 1st time we saw it), she looked at me with a huge grin and she had tears in her eyes, she said, ""That was SO cool!!""  She wanted to buy another ticket and see it again, but my heart was pounding too much at the time for me to sit through it again the same day, LOL.  She said she wished she had a way of telling Mr. Butler that this was great and would love to give him a ""BIG Thank You"" for doing Olympus Has Fallen.

The time-tested action movie format based on the premise of a gang of terrorists vs. one-man army in an isolated space (the most successful being the first ""Die Hard"") will never die out.

In ""Olympus Has Fallen"" Gerard Butler plays Mike Banning, a former presidential security officer, and he is the only guard alive inside the White House taken over by terrorists, with the US president taken as hostage. Directed by Antoine Fuqua of ""Training Day"" fame, ""Olympus Has Fallen"" remains tense and absorbing for the most part, though some of the special effects leave much to be desired.

This is from Millennium Films, a studio behind action films like ""The Expendables."" They know how to make entertaining action movies without spending too much money on effects, and that one of the keys for success is the cast. ""Olympus Has Fallen"" boasts an impressive cast including Angela Bassett, Aaron Eckhart, Robert Forster, Cole Hauser, Ashley Judd, Melissa Leo, Dylan McDermott, Radha Mitchell and Rick Yune.

There are countless plot holes that you have to ignore (where did the C-130 come from?). But maybe we should not be talking about the real world.

Imagine, opening credits, a vibrant American flag flies across the screen -- You can almost smell the amber waves of grain! Pan the camera down to two men boxing in the ring. ""Mr. President, you're needed upstairs!"". The perfect strong-jawed POTUS stops mid rope-a-dope to handle some official business.

Fast forward, Terrorist wrecking that ass in Washtington DC. Take prime cabinet members hostage. Going to get executed? Star singing the pledge of allegiance in protest! Oh yeah! A red white and blue tear rolled down my cheek!

Now Gerard Butler is back to show these starving commies what freedom is all about. Gruff one liners delivered with all the seriousness and testosterone deserved. Definitely worthy of their place in the likes of Cobra or Commando. So we are missing the 1980's steroid abuse that made these stars bigger than life. What we aren't missing is straight up democracy-loving patriotism delivered by the barrel of a gun.

What's that? The North Koreans have somehow stolen a secret weapon. How'd they get it?!?!?! Prophetically, Morgan Freeman (once again as the thoughtful and reluctant black president; is this movie a prequel to Deep Impact? Its better if you imagine it is) exclaims, ""It doesn't matter!

Enjoyed it although I'm not sure seeing it on the big screen was such a good idea--because the action (shooting and whatnot) was so prevalent throughout, it was hard on the ears, to be frank. The ending was predictable though--but one of relief, nevertheless. I thought the script writers could have added something before the close concerning Gerard Butler's role in saving the President, his son and others, about half of the structure of the Whitehouse and the American people (and possibly the entire world, too), having singlehandedly achieved what he did. Yet, given the enormity of what he did -- no rewards, no accolades (except perhaps being able to rejoin the President's detail which might have been implied at the end of the very last scene?)

5601821,4,B00BEIYHT2,"Olympus Has Fallen is the first of two films this year that has a plot centered on the White House being assaulted. Purely set up as an all-out action film it succeeds by setting a chaotic and dire stage and never letting off the gas. It's more Die Hard than A Good Day to Die Hard was.

Gerard Butler stars as a former Secret Service agent who finds himself in the midst of the takeover and as the only person in a position to put an end to it. A rogue North Korean faction takes control of the White House and with it the President hostage putting the group's leader in a position of leverage to make demands that would allow North Korea to invade South Korea and ultimately bring down the United States by another means.

While the CGI shows flaws in certain instances it was still believable enough. The scope of the set pieces was more notable. What really established Olympus as more than just a bland action movie was the intensity of the scenes and the gravity of the events taking place that was reflected through them.

The takeover sequence was not just visually powerful but creatively planned out. There were many moving parts to it which made it seem at least semi-plausible. The close-combat scenes were visceral with some brutal kills. While its no The Raid: Redemption in that sense it was a much harder ""R"" than anticipated.

Aaron Eckhart plays the President and if he comes across as a tad weak it's probably because of movies like Air Force One where the POTUS refuses to give an inch and fights back no matter the circumstances. Eckhart's performance considers the personal loss he has gone through and seeing others face death right in front of him - leaving the fighting to those who are trained for it. Morgan Freeman is the Speaker of the House and assumes the role as President during the situation. He's pretty much what one would expect from Freeman in such a leadership role, though refreshingly he didn't have all the answers either.

Olympus Has Fallen is an action film that feels as though it could have belonged in the 80s or 90s. It's a non-stop adrenaline ride that racks up a high body count within a high concept plot and it works to a surprising extent.",1369267200,42,2193,4.541772151898734

I'm just looking for a fun time at the movies so I usually go into a movie like this hoping for some good action and some mindless entertainment.

Olympus Has Fallen does not disappoint when it comes to non-stop, crazy action.  There are a billion bullets flying in this movie and plenty of stuff blowing up.  This is a pure summer action movie.  There is no love story or huge character development.  This is just an all out war. Gerard Butler is the typical, unstoppable, calm-cool-and-collected tough guy, and does a good job of portraying that character.  The lead bad guy was great also.

One of the all time great Action Films.  Olympus Has Fallen is breathtaking stuff from one of the most gifted action directors in generations, and it is a testament to American bad- a*s heroes the way they used to be and should be.  In a day and age where Hollywood seems to revel in America hating and America bashing as easily as one can tie their shoes (which is disgraceful in this author's opinion), Olympus Has Fallen makes you feel those red white and blue goose bumps again.

Antoine Fuqua directs with a masterful eye and generates some of the most exciting action you will ever see put on screen.  Gerard Butler is magnificent as Secret Service Agent Banning. The plot has been explained excellently in other reviews, and although their are some plot holes, the action is so unreal that the movie merits 5 stars from me.  America and the world needs a whole lot more Antoine Fuquas, and Gerard Butlers, and great action films like this where good is good, and evil is evil, and there is no nonsensical moral relativism, like most of what permeates and passes for deep thinking nowadays in filmaking.

Olympus Has Fallen (2013) - Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Ashley Judd, Morgan Freeman, Dylan McDermott, Angela Bassett, Robert Forster, Cole Hauser, Finley Jacobsen, Melissa Leo, Radha Mitchell, Rick Yune

Premise: When a North Korean terrorist group launch an all out assault on the White House, a disgraced Secret Service Agent, Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), must rise to the occasion to rescue the President (Aaron Eckhart) from his captor before the Mad Man gains access to a secret nuclear program called ""Cerberus"".

Thoughts: Olympus Has Fallen is one of 2013's two ""Die Hard In The White House"" entries (the other being the upcoming White House Down). Unfortunately, it sets the bar quite low. While Gerard Butler gives a really enjoyable performance in an action hero role, his choice of vehicle was questionable. Without giving too much away, the internal logic of the film is FUBAR'd from the word ""Go."" The characters behave not as characters but what is most convenient to the plot - instead of providing us with competent villains, the writers gave us stupid ones. Additionally, their actions - as terrorists - do not make sense. The biggest offender of the internal logic problem, however, is the president in regards to scenes where his staff is tortured - if you watch the movie you will instantly catch on to what I am referring (hint: if you can't stand seeing your staff get put through the ringer, what do you think a terrorist is going to do to get you to comply to his plan? Genius.) While the direction, overall, is solid - the main detractors here are story choice and visuals: the key determinants in why would want to pay to see this movie.

Should you buy this movie? Absolutely not. For one thing, the film looks cheap. In their race to beat ""White House Down"" to the market, the producers cut corners which is obvious in any scene involving CGI (and the fact that White House looks absolutely nothing like the real White House - to the point where it is more of a distraction). The Story is a mess and characters show up at random places when it makes no logical sense for them to be on the scene (Banning's Girlfriend in the final scene of the film).

Should you rent this movie? Yea, if you're the kind of person who enjoys mindless entertainment (not saying that in a bad way - after all, I did watch and enjoy the film for what it was) then this is definitely worth a one off rental. It's enjoyable to see Gerard Butler return to the genre that made him famous but it lacks all the merits it needs for ownership. It's a solid action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.",1367020800,4,2878,4.60233918128655
5601854,5,B00BEIYHT2,"And, to top it off, a top-grade ensemble cast (Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, Dylan McDermott, Rick Yune, Cole Hauser, Ashley Judd, and, behind the camera, TRAINING DAY director Antoine Fuqua!) bringing this newer version of Die Hard to life!

Olympus Has Fallen stars Gerard Butler as Mike Banning, a disgraced ex-Secret Service guard for President Benjamin Asher (Eckhart), his wife Margaret (Judd), and his son Connor (Finley Jacobsen). Banning, once a man with high prestige in Washington, is now working with the Treasury Department in the nation's capital. Not to say that that's not an honor, but...certainly a step down from being the President's most trusted guard.

The reason for Banning having to take a step down in his career? A limousine accident Banning was in with the first lady...an accident that claimed the first lady's life and left the President single and the ""first kid"" without a mother.

Now, eighteen months have passed, and a civil war is being fought in Korea, American troops fighting the war in Korea's Peninsula. The war is necessary, but nobody likes war, do they (well, almost nobody!)? This leads to President Asher having a meeting with South Korea's prime minister, Lee Tae-Woo (Keong Sim).

The result proves to be disastrous when a North Korean terrorist named Kang Yeonsak (Yune), disguised as a South Korean ministerial aide, takes complete control over the White House, holding President Asher and all of his cabinet hostage. At the very last minute, House Speaker Martin Trumbull (Freeman) must become the (acting) President and make many stressful decisions...all of which he isn't prepared to make! And, from inside the White House, there is only one hope for survival: Mike Banning himself.

What you have here, folks, is a film that mirrors Die Hard in many, many ways...yet follows its own path. Gerard Butler makes John McClane into his very own character (Mike Banning), and powerfully shifts from suspense into humor, and from humor into suspense! Freeman, with his Academy Award-winning and nominated talent, who ""makes acting look so easy,"" as a friend of mine likes to say-takes the drama of Olympus Has Fallen and creates into complete reality. Freeman knows the film's situation; he understand's the film's situation; and from there on out,he brings the film to life. You can really feel his character's pressure and stress, as you can with all of the characters, really. Butler and Freeman certainly steal the show, but Olympus Has Fallen couldn't have been made without the other acclaimed actors standing next to them. The film stands out as powerful action, drama, and comedy-all at the same time-thanks to these actors and to Antoine Fuqua as well!

There are some people who may say that Olympus Has Fallen is ""too unrealistic,"" and other people who say that it's inappropriate subject matter given what America has been through in the last twelve years. Below I leave my feedback in response to these two criticisms (which I've actually heard come from peoples' mouths):

Olympus Has Fallen is, like Die Hard, a film with a story and a sequence of events that actually could happen. However, in real life; things would not be as straightforward as they appaer to be in the film; rather; it would take a few days/nights for everything to be resolved. It certainly would be interesting to see it as it really would happen, but wouldn't that make us rebut our argument of disturbance? Plus, would we really want to see a film that took that long to come to a conclusion?

As for the ""argument of disturbance,"" I will say this: even in the midst of the drama and the action (entertaining action that could be seen as disturbing at the same time); there is GREAT comedy, the same comedy that made us fall in love with both Die Hard and its hero of John McClane. And, to top it all off; the ending is not only very happy, but also very glorious in the glorification of America and her power!:-)

Highly recommended!

5601855,3,B00BEIYHT2,"It's late afternoon in Washington DC, terrorists have taken the White House, and the body count is rising by the second.  Olympus Has Fallen certainly has an attention-grabbing premise, but more often than not fails to deliver on its potential.

The film opens at the presidential retreat Camp David, where we are introduced to Mike Banning, a Secret Service agent and personal friend to the president's family.  While Olympus Has Fallen allows us to take a few minutes to get to know its cast, Director Antoine Fuqua's style lets no moment linger, and the film quickly propels into high gear.  While leaving Camp David, there is a major car accident that Banning fails to prevent, leading to the death of the First Lady, and his expulsion from the Secret Service.

A year and a half later, Banning is now working at a desk job, which everyone in Hollywood knows is the least fulfilling avenue of work anyone could possibly choose.  He's clearly defeated and still depressed over his past failure, but his chance for redemption comes from an unlikely source - a full-scale terrorist attack on the most heavily defended building in the world.  In what is undoubtedly the film's best scene, terrorists both in the air and on the ground manage to breach the White House's defenses and hold the president hostage in his bunker, with Banning managing to trap himself inside the building as well.

From here on out, it's a fairly typical Die Hard scenario - one man against everyone else in the building.  It sounds like it would work, it ought to work, but it unfortunately doesn't.  Where Die Hard's John McClane would more often than not barely escape an encounter with a bad guy without all his bones broken, Banning much more closely resembles a straight-up super soldier.  Any encounter with terrorists inevitably ends in their being beaten within seconds, which robs the film of a lot of its potential tension.  Frankly, the entire film loses tension simply because of how trigger-happy it is.  Rarely has a major film featured so many on-screen deaths, both of civilians and political figures.  After two straight hours of such wanton violence, it completely loses its impact.

The acting is good, with several big names doing a great job, but the casting ultimately feels like the film is playing it safe.  Morgan Freeman plays Speaker of the House Allen Trumbull with a beleaguered demeanor that you would expect of someone forced to take the office of president during such a crisis.  Ultimately, though, it's basically the role we've come to expect of Freeman - no surprises here.  Aaron Eckhart plays the president, and again, it's a fairly predictable performance for anyone who remembers Eckhart as Harvey Dent in The Dark Knight.  Only Gerald Butler, who plays Banning, adds any sort of nuance to his role, and that's frequently just due to how convincing he is as a man seeking redemption for past failures.

While Olympus Has Fallen is frequently fun, it often feels like a missed opportunity.  Despite its undoubtedly large budget, its A-list cast, and iconic location, it rarely rises to any higher level than ""average"".",1366588800,22,3134,4.8977272727272725
5601856,5,B00BEIYHT2,"I decided to check out this film because my husband had a high interest in seeing it (he did enjoy the film). ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is a thriller type movie that touches on a somber ""what if"" scenario as it pertains to the White House.  Aaron Eckhart, Gerald Butler, Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, and Ashley Judd are some of the well-known actors/actresses appearing in this film. ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is good for those who like action/thriller movies.",1366502400,9,453,4.883116883116883
5601857,4,B00BEIYHT2,"Antoine Fuqua's Olympus Has Fallen is probably the wildest ride you'll take since the last time you rode Space Mountain, the Cyclone or even Kingda Ka*.  Watching this action adventure is the equivalent of a turn on one of the world's scariest roller coasters with a release of adrenaline and dopamine that makes us feel frightened, shocked,  giddy and intensely alive.  Whenever I get off a rollercoaster, I want to get right back on. I felt the same way after I saw this movie.

We've all heard the term ""edge-of-your-seat"" thriller. If you've never actually been on the edge of your seat while watching a movie and thought that was just so much hyperbole, that is exactly the place from which you will watch most of this movie. If you've seen a trailer or clip, you know that the relative calm with which the movie opens, a picture of a happy family that just happens to include the President of the United States (Aaron Eckhart), won't last. It's like the clickety-clacking of that rollercoaster slowly making its way up to the first peak and then BAM!  We get a brief respite while we and the characters on screen recover. When the action starts again, it really starts and seldom lets up for the next hour and a half.

Director Antoine Fuqua's pacing and the talented cast keep us from looking too closely for the zippers up the backs of the monsters. The plot moves so fast and the actors sell it so well, that we don't have time to look for holes. (And I'm not saying I didn't see any, but when you're biting your nails and dodging bullets you don't have a moment to think about whether or not  ""that would really happen"".)If you think the sight of the Washington Monument moments after a plane hits it looks familiar, it's supposed to. It evokes one of the defining moments of our country's recent history for a reason. It's designed to deliberately stir our patriotism precisely so that when the shooting stops, you understand the journey that the people who inhabit the United States on screen under President Asher (Aaron Eckhart, looking extremely Presidential I may add),  have just taken.  It neatly sidesteps jingoism by giving the bad guy (Rick Yune as Kang) a cause, but does not delve too deeply into his back story except to let us know that however just that cause may or may not be and how cool, calculated and brilliant he may appear, he took the train to Crazy Town long ago.

It avoids predictability by resolving one subplot in particular quickly, without dragging it out into clich and also by not treating the hostages as ""damsels-in-distress"" waiting to be saved, but as tough patriots determined to go down swinging if that is their fate. Again, I have to stress the brilliant casting. Without an actress of Oscar winner Melissa Leo's caliber, we might not buy a female Secretary of Defense or what she undergoes in that bunker. The same could be said of Angela Bassett's Director of the Secret Service. Her part was originally written for a man, since there had never been a female director. She is completely plausible and despite the fact that we never learn a single thing about her background, with Bassett's performance we can understand how tough Lynn Jacobs would have to be, to even be considered for the job.

Gerard Butler is more than credible as both Agent Mike Banning, the head of the President's protection detail, mentor and guardian of the President's son, as well as Agent-in-Exile Mike Banning, with visible, barely contained anxiety stemming from his role in the death of the First Lady and the desire to get back ""in"". Butler does ""damaged hero"" very well and this movie lets him play to those strengths. We absolutely buy him as an ex-special forces commando able to thin the enemy's numbers single-handedly. We especially buy his banter. The many one-liners he gets off are hilarious and speak volumes about the man and how he handles himself under pressure. Credit the writers, Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt, as well as Butler himself, from whom many of those lines originated.

Do I even have to tell you that Morgan Freeman was completely believable as the Speaker of the House who becomes the Acting President? We've seen him in charge before and we always believe him. In fact, there are factions in this country who think he's so good at acting like the president that they think he should run for the real job. (Mr. Freeman, I've read, takes that as a compliment to his abilities, but has no plans to run.) Freeman's very casting is almost a spoiler.  How could everything not turn out okay on his watch?

I don't want to spoil anything, for instance there are more than a few of those one liners of Banning's that I'd love to quote, but I will refrain. (In some ways I think there have been too many clips of the film released. I will say this, it's all about context.) I can tell you that the fight scenes you may have seen, as well as the battles and carnage, are but the tip of the iceberg. I am serious when I tell you this movie doesn't let up until the last two minutes of screen time. I can also tell you that the audience I saw the movie with (all 3x so far) laughed, whooped and gasped at appropriate times and then erupted into cheers and applause when the bad guy finally bought it.

There will be people for whom this movie will be too much. Too much noise, too much blood, too much suspended disbelief, just too much. (For me there was a little too much kettle drum in the score.) This is a hard-R action movie. Lots of s*** gets blowed up and the F-word is carpet bombed.  It won't please everyone, nor should it. Those that like this sort of thing will love it. My first response to a friend after I saw the movie? ""However good you THINK Olympus Has Fallen will be-multiply that by 10"". The only nit I'll pick was that I think there was probably originally more to Mike Banning's relationship with his wife that didn't make the final cut. Radha Mitchell is very good in her limited screen time and both she and Butler do convey a sense of the state of their relationship with very little, but I do believe we were denied a love scene.

5601859,4,B00BEIYHT2,"This movie is fantastic for these people:

- You like the film concept of a foreign government capturing the President inside the White House, with a single hero (as in Die Hard) who tries to save the day (and the world) - against all odds.

- You're looking for an exciting, heart pounding, non-stop action flick.

- You like movies with lots of explosions, surprises, and situations that look really impossible.

- You don't care if there are some things about this film that are a bit clich&eacute;. They can work in films. And you're just looking for some entertainment anyway.

- You're okay with a character theme that's been done before. There's some time taken to show you the woundedness of Gerard Butler's character, and some of what makes him tick. It's not a new theme. You've seen this before. But you're ok with that.

This movie is not for you if:

- You can't stand clich&eacute;'s in movies.
- You're looking for really deep characters and relationships.
- You can't stand seeing anything in a movie that's been done before.
- You want something completely unique, and utterly original.

So for me I really enjoyed it. It was full of suspense with some twists I didn't see coming. Once the twists came I realized I'd seen some of them before in other movies, but who cares. It still worked. I was on the edge of my seat almost the entire time, and it was a fun afternoon worth the price of admission.

I also recommend seeing it on the big screen to get the full effect.",1365984000,222,1487,4.518656716417911
5601880,1,B00BEIYHT2,"This movie was so bad that it infuriated me. The base plot it the White House is under siege and Gerald Butler must single handed save it.
//SPOILERS//
The most annoying part is that not a single thing that happens is realistic or plausible. First when they are driving on the bridge, yes it is icey, but they are only going 30, yet somehow, a car going 30 manages to smash through a concrete guard rail. Then, the presidents limo is hanging over the edge rocking. Rather than jumping on the trunk and sitting there for counter balance they try and hold onto the back to keep it balanced. Butler saves the president, but the first lady falls with the car. Why couldn't someone else have pulled her out the other side whilst he was pulling out the president. They had like four guys per car in this five or six car line.
So then he gets fired, but ends up working for the treasury so they can keep him just down the road. So then this plane comes flying into the capital. Two fighters pull along side it and tell it that it is in restricted air space. They give it a bunch of chances to land despite it refusing to identify itself. And it magically manages to shot both of them down. I see no way a plane could get anywhere near there after 9/11. Or how a bomber could out maneuver interceptors. It shoots down like four. And has magical flares that can fool smart missiles from the planes. But that was just the distraction. Then all these Koreans who were hiding in plane clothes attack the White House while everyone is distracted. Butler is the only one who survives the Gatling gun attacks and makes it inside.
Then we get to where the senior government betrays the people. They are being held hostage by the Korean diplomats who came to visit. Rather than die to save the people, they give up their codes to detonate all the us nuclear missiles. But, they only get two. And despite the fact that it would take the best password cracker(that 25 gpu one) over a week to crack one of those passwords, they crack the third in less than an hour. So much for three tries on a password.
Then, Butler manages to kill all the bad guys and stop they system by himself, big surprise!
Finally, there is the fact that when you see the map of nuclear weapons in the US, there is like one dot for Montana.
It feels like they made this movie entirely to make people angry against the Koreans. And stir up patriotism. Don't waste your time or money.",1365897600,13,2437,4.3464912280701755

I have read where this was the low budget version of the two White House movies coming out this year.  Well, the pyrotechnic budget certainly wasn't low.  Maybe they saved money on the actors.
I recommend this movie for fans of vintage David Drake novels, Bruce Willis movies, and others who just want an adrenaline ride!

The movie is about North Korean terrorist who not only infiltrate the South Korean security team but use the opportunity to infiltrate the White House as well and take the President and his cabinet hostage.

Every action movie has a hero and with all of the action most audiences would only be able to follow one hero.  Also, while the action was a little over the top it holds your attention.

5601884,3,B00BEIYHT2,"Beware the dreaded North Korean's are coming. I see Hollywood who Hollywood has chosen for its bad guy in the early part of the decade, that being North Korea. Hollywood always does this and from the late 1990's to most of the 2000's it was Muslims and terrorists. In the early 1980 to mid-1980's it was communists along with the growing war on drugs that took over in the late 1980's to the mid-1990's. Yes every half decade to decade Hollywood finds the hot issue of the day in the United States and makes films about them and rightly so. Many times it works, but for the films to be good they have to make the films somewhat believable and that is what Hollywood faces with North Korea. Yes North Korea is a totalitarian nation that treats its people horribly, has one of the largest armies in the world and has nuclear weapons but Hollywood seems to want to overestimate its capabilities. Like in the terrible remake of Red Dawn they actually had North Korea invading the United States that's beyond ridiculous. Heck even in the 1980's when the USSR was still around it couldn't have invaded the US. By the early to mid-1970's the USSR was declining fast. They didn't have the man power, resources or money for that type of invasion. Still that was far more plausible than North Korea invading the US even with the even more ridiculous reason Red Dawn gave us. As of right now there is no nation that could single handily invade the United States. Heck Mexico with all its drug cartels has a better chance of invading the United States than I think any other nation in the world.

In Olympus Has Fallen the plot of how the North Korean's get into and manage to take the White House is ridiculous, but is far more plausible than what happened in Red Dawn. As we all saw with 9/11 and other terrorist attacks it is possible to get around defenses with a small number of men and wreak havoc. In that the plot is somewhat believable and plausible, but it's still unbelievable about how they go about it. Once you get past the ridiculousness of the concept Olympus has fallen is an enjoyable action film. The film follows Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) as he goes from being President Benjamin Asher's (Aaron Eckhart) head agent guarding him to a desk job after an accident that kills the president's wife played by Ashley Judd, who if blink won't even realize is in the film. The president no longer wants to see Mike and has bigger problems of his own as just like today is causing trouble and the president is set to meet the Prime Minister of South Korea when all hell breaks loose. The President along with the Prime Minister is rushed into the bunker while Mike fights his way into the White House to rescue the president and his son.

While the plot is definitely the major problem with the film the action was well done from the beginning when the North Korean's invade the White House the action is intense. Also make no mistake the film is rated R, and it is a hard R rating with women being beaten, men being tortured and killed, killing of civilian, lots of blood and much more. The riveting action harkens back the action films of the 1980's and films like Die Hard and Rambo.

Olympus has fallen is without question Gerard Butler's film. The actor hasn't had a great career since his break out role in 300 with the like of Gamer and Playing for Keeps, but he's shines here with his limited back story and dialog. You believe he is an ex-Ranger and Secret Service Agent, and like 300 and even with the bad Gamer film he's shown he knows how to do action. Unfortunately besides Butler the supporting cast is limited. There are of course bright spots with Cole Hauser whose shown he is a solid supporting character along with Rick Yune who is excellent as Kang Yeonsak the main baddy of the film. He brings much need drama and terror to the film. Kang blows away that incompetent Captain from Red Dawn out of the water. Those are the three real bright spots. As I said Ashley Judd is like ghost if you blind you'll miss her. Aaron Eckhart just wasn't that great of film president. He did a decent job, but I want my movie presidents to be like Harrison Ford in Air Force One. Morgan Freeman just seemed like he was sleep walking through the film.

I've enjoyed director Antoine Fuqua's films since I first saw the much underrated Replacement Killers. He's proven he knows how to do intense action and drama and continues that here. Is this his best film plot and character wise? The answer is a definite no, but Olympus Has Fallen is one of his best action films bring together the outrageous with the intense putting together one of the better action films of the year.

Olympus Has Fallen has continued 2013 trend of lackluster to bad films and is certainly no means a great, or really good film. What Olympus Has Fallen is a really good action film with an unbelievable script, decent acting and good directing? Can Roland Emmerich's White House Down top the grandiose scale and ridiculousness of Olympus Has Fallen? There is no question the answer is yes, but will it be a better film I doubt it. In all honest if you are looking for anything more than an entertaining good time with some good action I'd skip Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down.",1365206400,2,5283,4.510438413361169
5601885,5,B00BEIYHT2,"I wasn't really sure what to expect when I went to this movie. The decent action flicks of yesterday have been replaced by superheroes shooting space aliens or super gory, gross movies that are so hardcore they turn me off before I ever get past the trailer. But this movie takes you back to the really cool action thrillers of yesteryear and frankly, I was riveted throughout.

The action is non stop and the acting is superb, especially for this type of movie. I had never seen Gerard Butler in a movie before but from now on, he is on my watch list. His portrayal of Mike Banning is gritty and down to earth, never over the top. Aaron Eckhart does a very good job with the rather thankless role of the Hostage In Chief. He, too, never stoops to caricature; just a man faced with a horrifying situation. Morgan Freeman and Angela Bassett are solid and realistic as the Speaker of the House and the Director of the Secret Service. Rick Yune is a absolute chiller of a villain.

Yes, the movie is bloody - but not as bad as some. The violence is brutal and dirty but crucial to the plot. Maybe some of the story is cliched but I haven't seen this type of movie for a long time.

5601887,3,B00BEIYHT2,"I will not go into much detail about things that happen, but there may be some information on things that do.

Ok, I was to first say that this was a cool movie.  I actually felt like I was watching something on the news, as it was happening.  I have never felt like that when watching a movie.  It was exciting, frightening and interesting.  It moved at a speed that was easy to follow and really drew you in.  I will buy this when it comes out.  Seems like a cool movie to watch at night while feeling safe at home.

The movie is about a president who is taken hostage.  The hostages want to get something from him and others there it order to gain access to something that could destroy parts of the world.  The terrorist are VERY well trained and have high grade military weapons.  They are very well set up and have planned and set up what they are doing.  They end up taking over the White House!  Once inside they give their list of demands.  Will they get what they desire, or will they be stopped in time to save millions?  You will have to watch to find out.

That is really it.  I did not want to give to much away.  Now, if I liked it so much and am going to buy it, why the 3 out of 5?  I will tell you why.  The movie was SO far fetched that it made it kind of hard to REALLY get into.  I was sitting there and thought to myself, this could never happen.  But, the interesting thing is I only go that feeling once.  The rest of the time I felt like I was watching something that was or had actually happened.  You have to let your mind loose it's reality.  It makes it really fun.

Here is what I think was wrong with the movie.  Firstly, the tragic thing that happens in the beginning of the movie.  I do not really see the point.  I guess I understand that they had to set up another character.  But it seems they could have done it a different way.  The thing that happened was just done and that was it.  Second, it just so happens that ALL the people the terrorist needed to complete their mission were in the white house.  Kind of a lucky break, no?  Third, the president was sitting there telling the others needed to give the terrorist what they wanted because he would never give it to them.  He did not want them to be killed by the terrorist.  Does that make sense?  First, unless the president was an idiotic child, he would easily understand that while a few may die, millions would be saved.  What kind of idiot would say just give them the information?  If they were killed, the terrorist would need more time to complete their mission.  Thus buying the Government more time.  Then, after the people gave the information, why would the man in charge, who was one of the most wanted terrorist in the world not kill them?  He didn't care about honor or respect.  Why would he let them live?  The president would have to know this.  Yet he said ""just give them the things they want.""  Didn't really make sense.  Next, how could these people get into all of these military computers?  I understand there are hackers and they can do a lot.  But the Government never realized their data was being broken into?  Then, after it was, they did nothing to stop it?  Come on, crazy.  Next, they send teams in first to try and stop the terrorist.  Would they really just have them run up to the white house or land their chopper right on the front lawn?  Seems they would have to strategize.  Another thing is this, these people had all these things they were doing with computers and tech, could the government not just send out an EMP?  Does that not disable all the electronic items?  Seems that would have stopped them right there.  This has went on for a while, so I will end it two more things.  This guy is one of the most wanted terrorist in the world.  Yet, he just walked around in D.C. and is able to get into the White House?  Nobody realized who he was?  Do they not have computers for those kinds of things?  FINALLY, the terrorist are flying a large plane in D.C., it is right over the white house.  Come on, it would be stopped before he got close to the place.  That is what I was saying earlier, these people have such high tech, top quality items.  Yet the Government had no idea they existed.  As my mom and I were leaving, I told her I actually felt like I was watching an anime.

So there it is, the movie was cool.  I was sitting there and was totally into it.  But after you see it, you will more than likely feel the same way I did.  Like you had just watched a cartoon or played a fps.  If you like action movies, give this a chance.  You will probably enjoy it.",1364947200,3,4604,4.185354691075515
5601888,4,B00BEIYHT2,"High-adrenaline, fast-paced intense action, a victimizing, threatening enemy, and a strong, heroic lead character - Olympus Has Fallen succeeds where A Good Day to Die Hard miserably, miserably failed. On the other hand, it can also be said that Olympus Has Fallen succeeds where the original Die Hard also succeeded. However one wants to look at it, if you like any form of Die Hard, you are sure to like Olympus Has Fallen.

While the title may lead one to suspect that this is an epic Greek battle of the gods, this ""Olympus"" refers to the ""most heavily secured building in the world,"" the White House. Yet within thirteen minutes, a grisly surprise attack by North Korea causes this ""Olympus"" to fall and fall hard! Disgraced presidential security operative, Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) finds himself in serious John McClane territory as he becomes the only eyes and ears that Speaker of the House and acting president Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) has on a hostage situation that includes President Asher (Aaron Eckart), Secretary of Defence McMillan (Melissa Leo), Vice President Rodriguez, and South Korean Prime Minister Lee (Keong Sim).

Butler plays this role well. He's tough but also sympathetic. Director Antoine Fuqua keeps the action fresh, moving, and increasingly relentless. He also keeps it dark, and not just figuratively. Much of the film takes place in a darkened White House at night, which results in some confusing and disorienting action scenes from time to time. Butler's main objective is to infiltrate the presidential bunker where North Korean terrorist Kang (Rick Yune) menacingly tortures and executes hostages until his demands for the US to withdraw all resistive forces from Korean territory are met. Kang is an excellent villain and Yune plays his part to a cold and ominous effect.

Olympus's greatest advantage is its pacing and relentless action. There is little character development, barring a short prologue at the beginning that reveals the rift between President Asher and Banning; thus, the characters are hardly memorable. Instead, it is shooting, killing, stabbing, kicking, and punching and lots of it. The film isn't lazy about its action though, and it is for this reason that it is successful in rising above average action fare. It is doubtful, we will see Olympus Falls Again, but for a one and done ""kicking ass and taking names"" kind of movie, this one feels like Die Hard on a ""Good Day.""

5601889,4,B00BEIYHT2,"Antoine Fuqua has been one of those directors that shined bright and early with a movie like ""Training Day"" that was nominated for Oscars and acknowledgements, and then he sort of went into mediocre land. Now with ""Olympus has Fallen"" many are saying that he has finally done something worth watching again. Here's my opinion on that matter.

""Olympus has Fallen"" immediately inserts you into the lives of Secret Service Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) and President of the United States Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart). Immediately you see that Fuqua has achieved a realistic portrayal of life with the American President in an age of random shootings, terrorists and thriving dictator leadership. Banning has his work cut out for him. Fuqua has done his homework and the behind the scenes with the President feel works fantasically.

As if the screenwriter made adjustments to this movie just two weeks ago (impossible), we find the President preparing for a vital war-avoiding meeting with the South Koreans at the White House. Little do they know that the North Koreans have planned an aggressive and brazen attack on the White House and they come fast and hard.

In a way, ""Olympus has Fallen"" is a lot of what we've seen before in action movies, but never have we seen such a shocking attack on our nations most precious house. Many will say that this attack is unrealistic and impossible, but as we've all seen in recent years, the impossible and shocking shows up on our news on a weekly/monthly basis. Anyway, if you erase all those preconceived notions, you should be able to just sit back and enjoy a pretty intense action film.

There are lots of twists and double-crosses in ""Olympus has Fallen"" and it adds to the tension. Although the personal connection we feel to the characters is the movies best asset. ""Olympus"" is no ""Die Hard"", but it is a better film then all of its predecessors. Some of the effects in ""Olympus"" are less than great, but when a good story is being told, effects can be forgiven. Butler is effective as a former Army Ranger. In fact, this may be Butler's saving grace after receiving poor review after poor review for his previous films.

""Olympus has Fallen"" is a good action film that mostly takes place inside the White House and makes the most out of every antiquities destruction. It is certainly a fun trip to the movies that will have you glued to the screen the entire time. There is never a dull moment and while a lot of it just missed going into the stratosphere, it is still a consistently good movie.",1364774400,4,2555,4.7325842696629215
5601950,4,B00BEIYHT2,"Behold the unbelievable scenario of Gerard Butler versus like 60 North Korean black ops terrorists and Butler wins.  A satisfying movie for guys who like movies with explosions, throat punches, machine guns and knife fights.  It's like one super-long action sequence.

Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler; Machine Gun Preacher, Gamer) was transferred from the Secret Service after an accident resulted in the death of President Asher's (Aaron Eckhart) wife.  He's bored of his new desk job and misses being by his friend the president's side.  But the president cannot bear the memory of his wife's death.

During a meeting in the White House, the South Korean Prime Minister's chief of security Kang  goes rogue.  He is actually a long dark-ops North Korean terrorist with sinister plans for the United States. Rick Yune (The Man with the Iron Fists, Ninja Assassin) really owns the role of Kang and his ""no foolin' around"" hard line of terrorism.

Kang's White House takeover gives audiences a lot of continuous, intense action.  There are suicide bombers, huge guns, rapid fire guns, a kamikaze air assault, missile strikes, missile decoys, smoke bombs, explosions, creative road blocks, terrorists in tourists' clothing and insider double-crosses--it drew a lot of laughs, smiles and ""ooohs"" from the action movie fans in the audience.  The White House lawn was painted red as somehow Banning snuck his way into the White House before Kang's men had complete control.

Making his entrance, Banning watched in horror as secret service agents, responding to the sound of loads of gunfire, recklessly ran out into the open through the front door and were mowed down by Gatling guns.  For the sake of an impressive body count, the writers seemed to have decided that secret service men an White House security details are rather poorly trained and have no concept of using cover or evasive maneuvers when under fire.  This was a blaring flaw and it came with a lot of ""OMG, REALLY!?!""  But it also made it fun.

With the president and vice president held hostage, House Speaker Turnbull (Morgan Freeman) assumes the pressures of acting president.  As Turnbull weighs Kang's threats with global security, Banning starts wading his way through the White House halls and BRUTALLY picking off Kang's elite trained operatives.  The hand-to-hand combat isn't quite what I'd prefer, filmed very close up, sometimes shaky, and with choppy one-cut-per-move editing.  But hey, this isn't a martial arts movie.  It's a series of super-long action sequences kind of movie.  And the hard hitting action sequences are quite pleasing to this action junkie!

Supporting actors include Angela Bassett as Banning's boss, Melissa Leo as the Defense Secretary and Radha Mitchell as Banning's wife.  Everyone did a fine job.  My biggest complaint wouldn't be with the acting, but the writing in the early scenes when we have the president's healthy happy family routine shoved down our throats.  Too many rainbows and not enough ""real.""  But, again, this movie is largely a continuous IV drip of action.  So I'll let it slide.

Director Antoine Fuqua (Shooter, King Arthur, Training Day) must have anticipated how bad A Good Day to Die Hard was going to be and decided to give us ""Die Hard in the White House"" starring Gerard Butler to make up for it.  In fact, this movie was stunningly similar to the awesomely epic Die Hard and Live Free or Die Hard.  Let me count the ways...  1) The calm, cool, collected Kang looked so sleek in his vest outfit, not unlike the dashing and dapper, cardiganed Timothy Olyphant.  2) Like the Maggie Q to Olyphant, Kang also had a tough Asian computer whiz at his side who could hold her own in a fight.  3)  Like Willis' John MacClane, Butler takes a beating in this movie and his bruises and blood don't magically disappear between scenes as he takes heavy doses of punishment.  4) Like MacClane in Die Hard, Banning is the only line of communication with the outside, it takes a while for Kang to realize he's even there, Kang and Banning exchange some smack talk and threats, a bad guy pretends to be a good guy to try to kill Banning, and when the acting president and his panel don't listen to Banning bad stuff happens.  5) Banning and his wife are also having some problems--classic MacClane!  Basically, this movie was Die Hard with a North Korean Timothy Olyphant and Maggie Q in the White House.

Is this a bad thing?  Hell, no!  I enjoyed it.  It was a fun.  Although it was loaded with faults, the faults sort of contributed to the fun.",1364688000,8,4561,4.87012987012987

In agreement with previous reviews this movie is not for children, or for those who can be skittish with violent, action movies. Olympus Has Fallen is extremely violent, extremely loud and contains strong language and themes. Not for the weak of heart.

My goodness, soooo much killing and blood.

Gerald Butler is the save the world guy who relies entirely on moving through shadows swiftly while the main plot is meagre, I wonder why they even bothered wasting so much money on this.

The action is so-so, the acting is terrible, I sometimes could not believe the dialogue, there is a dialogue where a traitor is trying to justify his stance, his dialogues during that one minute of speech are so bad, I wonder if Peter Griffin wrote them himself.

Gerald Butler's stocks have really gone down in my opinion.

I regret watching this at the theater but the imdb rating is what fooled me. So I'm here to tell you that rewatching District 9 or even Cloverfield is a much better option in all seriousness than watching Olympus has fallen.

This particular director did films like ""training day"" , ""brooklyn's finest"" but he's also done ""King Arthur"" so it will be safe to say this is the worst film he's done. I think he may just killed Aaron Eckhart's career for good. I hope 2013 has much more in store for me.

There's plenty of action and explosion for those who like that kind of thing, but the script creaks with cliches.  Morgan Freeman just looks embarrassed as a White House mandarin who becomes an interim President, while Aaron Eckhart as the captured President grimaces when and where appropriate.

No. But don't we go to the movies to see the good guy face impossible odds and win?  I mean, what's the fun if it's too easy?

5602010,2,B00BEIYHT2,"""Olympus has fallen! Olympus has fallen!"" Well, so has any chance remaining for Gerard Butler to be a serious action star. Seriously, it's time Butler find himself a new gimmick (or at least a new agent) because this guy has been riding off the success of ""300"" for the past 7 years of his career (that's right- ""300"" came out 7 years ago) with one mediocre action flick after another-- and ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is no exception.

 This film tells the story of Special Forces operative Michael Banning (Butler) who works as a member of the US President's personal detail. After a horrible accident results in the death of the first lady (Ashley Judd), Banning is removed from the detail and placed in a government desk job. Haunted and guilt-ridden from the accident, Banning is suddenly forced back into action when the White House is attacked by North Korean terrorists and the President (Aaron Eckhart, ""The Dark Knight"") is taken hostage. Racing against time and an increasingly violent terrorist leader (Rick Yune ""The Fast and The Furious), Banning must use his special skills to save the President-and the nation.

  The action film is probably the easiest genre to sell to audiences-as long as it has these three things: a big-name cast, an impressive CGI sequence and some well-choreographed fight scenes. This film is certainly not lacking in any of these. So why doesn't it work? Well, it's because there are two kinds of action films. The first kind uses these elements alongside a solid script and decent actors to deliver a fun and entertaining experience for the audience (Die Hard, Jurassic Park). The second kind of action film simply takes these three elements and uses them to distract the audience from realizing that there is no script or story. This film is, without a doubt, the latter.

  With the exception of the first five minutes, every scene of this film is dedicated to impressing the audience with how big its budget is and how great its cast.  The film does have an amazing cast, from Eckhart (who everyone knows as Two-Face from ""The Dark Knight"") to Morgan Freeman as Speaker of the House. The problem is that everyone in this film was obviously cast to sell theatre tickets because none of them are given anything to do other than occasionally deliver a cheesy line or just look distressed at the camera. How they got Freeman to be in this movie is a mystery because he doesn't do anything other than just look around with a solemn look on his face. Either he was promised 50% of the film's profits or he was being held hostage himself.

  The acting in this film, or lack thereof, is another issue entirely. The actors in the film must have known that they were only here for marketing reasons because every performance feels phoned-in and uninspired. Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart are especially painful to watch here because both of these men have proven themselves to be good actors. However, whatever talent any of these actors may have is wasted here because this script doesn't give these characters any depth for the actors to draw from.

  The real problem with this film is that it is built on a premise that is so implausible to begin with that the whole film seems like a waste of effort. This movie makes attacking the White House look like a walk in the park, not to mention that it makes every aspect of the US defense system look completely inept. In order to enjoy this movie, you have to believe that not only is the White House security force made up of fifteen guys on the roof, but that the CIA doesn't perform background checks on people who they allow in a room with the President. The entire movie is made up this kind of absurdity to the point where it becomes flat-out silly.

  While this is the very definition of a bad action film, there are some redeeming qualities that, at the very least, make the film watchable. There is a CGI sequence in the first fifteen minutes of the film that is truly jaw-dropping, even though it's tragic that it's attached to this movie. There are also some solid performances from Angela Bassett (""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"") and Melissa Leo (""The Fighter""). Basset especially does the best she can with the throw-away role she is given. Also, the first five minutes, while still whopping with cheese, is the only part of this film that depicts any kind of emotion and it does make you anxious about where the film is going to go from there.

  While this film did have potential, what few good aspects it does have are not enough to save it from being, even at its best moments, just plain mediocre. ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is a failed effort at what could have been a really fun Die Hard-like experience that had more going for it than a great action sequence and some unintentional humor. Wait for the DVD or better yet, watch the CGI sequence on YouTube because other than that, there is nothing fun or memorable about this film.",1364256000,5,4931,4.6513233601841195

The film lacked a good narrative flow and that is where the John Refoua's editing should have come into play and made the film more cohesive. It should have tightened up the story and most importantly it would have made this film look more believable for this genre. Director Antoine Fuqua falls far short of his brilliant SHOOTER, which was a real tour de force. Gerard Butler is likeable and Aaron Eckhart looks very presidential, but they can't save this film. Angela Bassett's character stands out, but this film makes Morgan Freeman and Robert Forster look like bumbling idiots. What a shame for these two brilliant actors. Derek R.

Because, after all, ""Olympus"" IS that kind of movie - it is EXACTLY what you think it is...a rollicking, smash-mouth, loud and body-strewn extravaganza, albeit without any real jaw-clenching suspense.

Why?  Well, you've seen it before.  It's really the same kind of movie: great special effects, lots of action...which is both its asset and its problem. It's fun, it's Big Budget, it's exciting...and it's pretty predictable.

Gerard Butler plays Mike Banning, a superb Secret Service agent who had the bad luck of being the right guy for the right job when it came to protecting the President Asher (Aaron Eckhart), making the right decision, and acting precisely as he should - and for it he was bounced off the Presidential personal protection detail.  It's a tough break, one he relives constantly - a la Clint Eastwood's character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-The-Line-Of-Fire/dp/B000I8JF3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In The Line Of Fire</a>&nbsp;-  but here he is, pushing bureaucratic pens across bureaucratic forms, and despising his bureaucratic job.  He yearns for the chance to get into the action again, especially when he runs into his old friends on the Presidential squad.

But Change is coming with capital C in the form of a Korean madman and his eminently well prepared squad of miscreants.  And when they do come, they come with EVERYTHING.

As I've said before, what follows is a derivative trope - and Bruce Willis, Steven Seagal and others have done it before, and with better scripts.  But we can now add Gerard Butler to the list; he's confident and effective in the role of a brawny AND brainy patriotic hero.

As an adventure flick, I think ""Olympus"" does an equitable job, and director Antoine Fuqua (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Training-Day/dp/B0014DW3OS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Training Day</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Arthur/dp/B003QSGFG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Arthur</a>) deserves accolades: the special effects are spectacular, and seamless.  If you live near D.C., as I do, you can see that the White House used here is being stood in for by another building -- ?? but the effects are still handled masterfully.

For the most part the acting is solid, too: Morgan Freeman is, as always, perfect as Speaker of the House Allan Trumbull, the man who is reluctantly forced into the role of Acting President once the President and Vice-President are taken hostage.  There should be some kind of anointed position for Freeman within our national framework, as he seems somehow to always embody the personage of calm and assurance we need in times of crisis.

As for the other roles, Cole Houser is getting good work lately in secondary parts - here he plays Agent Roma - who appears to head the Secret Service detail - and I look forward to seeing him play a lead role in the not-too-distant future.  And, while Eckhart has the face of a President, the part written for him was highly faulted; he makes decisions (granted, under stress) that I hope NO President would EVER make. He seemed less formidable than I have seen him before, most notably in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-Los-Angeles-Blu-ray/dp/B004ULEEY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle: Los Angeles [Blu-ray</a>].

The only problem with the movie, I felt, was the script, which did not try awfully hard to escape the genre.  One can point over and over to scenes which seemed almost word-for-word rewrites of other films in the genre, and they made the movie rather predictable.  One scene was lifted right from the first ""Die Hard,"" in which Butler seems to have been taken in by a traitor's well-acted subterfuge. Therefore, I knew exactly how and when Butler would figure it all out.

There are other problems, too: Banning has been outside the White House detail for 18 months, yet he knows all the codes. And some early scenes were far too ""chummy"" between Banning, the President, and their son.  It seemed too, well, cliched.

Still, ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is exactly the right kind of movie for its audience.  If you want a fun, action-packed spectacular that delivers what it promises, this is the movie for you.  In fact, I feel ""Olympus"" does much better than its recent counterpart&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Good-Day-to-Die-Hard/dp/B00BUAEYVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Good Day to Die Hard</a>, a formula-driven sequel that seemed stale and tired in comparison.  Not so here: ""Olympus"" is a bright and exciting adventure film that is gratifying and rousing, the kind of patriotic rabble-rouser that doesn't flinch from delivering the goods.

Speaking of which, the night I saw the movie there were sitting near me people of several different ethnicities, and I was happy to hear them enjoying the movie right alongside me.  I thought that spoke volumes of what the White House represents, and that the American people are a varied but grateful population.  This was as reassuring as the movie itself, and it did my heart good to experience it.",1364169600,2,5615,5.82762836185819
5602014,2,B00BEIYHT2,"Without question, the action film is the most repetitive style of film in Hollywood.  Each one looks just like the last, only with different leads, a different setting, and the same old helpless hostage in need of rescue.  Still, the action film is considered to be one of, if not the most entertaining genre - because if it was good the first time, then it has to be good the next hundred times, right?  Well, since action films are all roughly the same, these movies are broke down into subcategories, starting with whom you'd enjoy as the lead.  When we think action stars, we instantly include Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, and possibly relative newcomer, Jason Statham.  Aside from that group of actors, Hollywood is essentially a revolving door of actors trying to play the part of the action star, using Matt Damon, Jeremy Renner, Liam Neeson, etc.  Who's in the revolving door this time?  It's no other than Mr. 300 himself, Gerard Butler - starring in Olympus Has Fallen.

Directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Shooter), Olympus Has Fallen stars Gerard Butler as U.S. Secret Service agent, Mike Banning.  Assigned to protect U.S. President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart), Banning saves the president's life from a limousine accident on an icy bridge, but is unable to save the first lady (Ashley Judd).  Skipping ahead a months later, Banning has been removed from the president's detail as the president attempts to move on after the death of his wife.  At the same time, the South Korean Prime Minister and his delegation comes to Washington D.C. to meet with President Asher.  However, a member of the Korean delegation is secretly a North Korean terrorist, named Kang (Rick Yune).  Kang organizes an assault on the White House (code named Olympus), starting with an air assault, followed by a ground takeover of the White House premises, leading to the eventual capture of the president.  With the entire White House security detail neutralized, agent Banning is the only one left alive inside the White House to rescue the president and avert a nuclear war.  Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, and Dylan McDermott also star in supporting roles.

First off, let it be known that Olympus Has Fallen is an action-packed extravaganza that will feed nearly all of your entertainment desires before all is said and done.  Aside from that, this film will offer you absolutely nothing.  But, he just said it was an extravaganza!?  Yes, there's plenty of senseless killing and explosions to easily pass the two hour run-time, yet the problem is you'll already know what's going to happen in the end after the first 20 minutes.  The film depicts the North Koreans as the villains, so was there ever a moment where you'd believe that the President of the United States would be assassinated by a North Korean?  It's bad enough the Koreans desecrates the Washington Monument in the film (and why films need to keep doing that is beyond comprehension), but they also annihilate more than half of the White House.  Aliens are allowed to destroy it (Independence Day), not the North Koreans.

The acting in Olympus is hardly even worth mentioning, since it feels like there might only be about 3 minutes of combined dialogue throughout the film.  Gerard Butler portrays an adequate Secret Service agent with his mysterious eyes and amble butt-kicking ability, but it's not like he brought anything spectacular to this role.  In fact, if they used Steven Segal in the lead role, the film could have been called ""Under Siege 3,"" or if they used Harrison Ford as the president instead of Aaron Eckhardt (who gets a free pass in this film because he was in the much beloved Dark Knight), it could have been called ""Air Force One Part II"" (yeah, I know it wasn't on Air Force One this time, but hopefully you get the point).

Overall, Olympus Has Fallen is exactly what it looks like from the trailers and the 15 second TV spots.  It's an action-packed film with a delusional premise, massive predictability disorder, and a plot line that resembles 99.9% of every other action film made over the course of human history.  If you're an action junkie and you have no problem watching the White House get blown to hell, this film is for you.

One final thought - it makes you wonder what President Obama thinks about a film like this...

5602016,5,B00BEIYHT2,"I was surprised how much I liked this film. It's very entertaining suspenseful and brutal. Probably the best action film of the year so far. It is very similar to 'Die Hard' but it's still a great movie on its own. Gerard Butler stars as a former Secret Service agent named Mike Banning. When President Asher is taken hostage during a meeting by the North Koreans, Mike sneaks into the White House and tries to save the President by any means necessary. I highly recommend OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN!!!",1364083200,12,494,4.625
5602017,5,B00BEIYHT2,"I have to say first that Gerard Butler is my favorite actor.  If I just watched him breathe for 2 hours, I would probably be satisfied.  Olympus Has Fallen, however, is one of his best movies in my opinion.  It is action filled, quite graphically violent, but also witty in places and on-the-edge-of-your-seat suspenseful.  I went to see it the day it premiered and then again the following day.  I have to say that I enjoyed it more the second time I saw it b/c there were so many things I missed the first time around.  Maybe I was concentrating too much on looking at Gerry the first time.  I plan to buy the DVD and add to my Gerard Butler collection.  I liked it that much.",1364083200,9,678,4.283464566929134
5602018,3,B00BEIYHT2,"WAIT UNTIL THIS MOVIE COME OUT ON DVD - SAVE YOUR MONEY.

Went to the theater last night to watch this movie and the movie has too much fantasy and fiction. It is really for entertainment, of course! Save your money until this movie comes out on DVD. The movie depends too much in G. Butler to save the country.
This movie should have been produced to be more real. First of all, once a unidentified plane invades the restricted air space in the WH, a squadron of fighters has the order or mission to bring down the object or plane  to matter what. Second, the WH has so many defenses around that a threat would be detected right away. Third, since 9-11 there is so much intelligence around that things like this will be difficult to accomplish...
Third, USA does not negotiate with terrorist whatsoever! The US secretary of Defense, etc. will never compromise the launch code or whatever to save his/her life, etc.
Anyway, the producers could have made the movie little bit more real...For example, a real confrontation with the US national Guard or army.",1364083200,5,1056,4.611702127659575
5602019,1,B00BEIYHT2,"Totally implausible story. Even worse acting. The whole first act of the movie was unneeded. It did not add anything to the story. It just made the movie longer. All through the movie I kept thinking Is this Die Hard? one officer against huge odds taking down a terrorist organization? At least Bruce Willis had Yippee ki-yay. Gerard Butler got nothing. His acting was even worse. Not that hes that great of an actor anyway.

What makes the movie bad:
1. Ashley Judd and Radha Mitchell ... few mins of screen time. Totally wasted talent.
2. Unexplained weird tension between Butler's character and his wife at the start of second act.
3. Gerard Butler's character knows all the secret combinations to all the safes in White house. Not only that he also knows how to control the white house's video surveillance system and has no problem locking out a well trained computer hacker.
4. The whole traitor guy story and his reasons for doing it. Some of the worst writing/dialogue ever. Total garbage.
5. President urging his high command to just give the terrorists codes that could activate ALL THE NUKES in the US. His reasoning ... he will never give out his!! And heres another example of crappy storytelling ... the terrorists didn't even need his code .. they just 'guessed' it
6. The super secret white house defense system? ... terrorists hacked it in less than an hour and then used it to take out 6 choppers full of navy seals. Yeah same hackers that couldn't get the video system working once Butler's character locked them out. Another piece of great writing.

I can go on but I need to go to bed and I have wasted enough time on this movie.

So basically skip this one at the theater and rent it from a vending machine when you have couple hours to kill.",1364083200,29,1764,4.575949367088608
