5690311,3,B00C3MOUQI,"Im a huge fan of the show & have purchased all the available seasons from Amazon (what's the hold up? 22 seasons in & only 11 available) season 11 was a good season, picture & sound good but the 1st I've purchased that has a problem, the 2nd disc freezes 1/2 way thru & when it does unfreeze it's 3/4's the way over, I already threw out return papers & don't like having to return items anyways so my loss, if not for the freezing I'd give 5 stars, love reliving past seasons",1370908800,4,475,4.118279569892473
5690312,5,B00C3MOUQI,I love this season of The Amazing Race. I particularly like Dustin and Candice. I like watching how the teams navigate thru other countries.,1370476800,,140,4.875
5690313,5,B00C3MOUQI,"Great show!!!! I only wonder why cbs.com doesn't sell the DVD""s on their website??? Oh well, Love the show. Bring more out to sell",1370390400,,130,4.458333333333333
5690314,5,B00C3MOUQI,"I was late getting to The Amazing Race and have been catching up for the last year on previous seasons.  I was happy to see some old teams show up again in this season and unhappy to see others.  What is it with Rob and Amber anyway?  On Survivor several times and now twice on The Amazing Race.  Cannot they get regular jobs???  At any rate, this season is just as fun and just as competitive as those seasons with new competitors.  One team I was cheering for did something really nasty toward the end only to discover karma does have quite a (lasting) kick.  Definitely a season that will keep you on the edge of your seat.",1368921600,,626,4.254237288135593
5690315,5,B00C3MOUQI,"What's with all the low reviews? My All Stars Edition came packaged perfectly and works great, however, it is a full screen release. I would never buy these normally, but it's all stars! It's like a must buy if you can't afford to buy all of em'. Plus I LOVE Charla and Mirna. LOL. 5 Stars.",1368662400,,290,4.196428571428571
5690316,1,B00C3MOUQI,we have a deaf member in our family and we are very disappointed that the new TAR sets do not have closed captions like the other TAR sets do. Please add closed captions to subsequent releases or we will not buy them.,1368057600,2,217,4.190476190476191
5690317,1,B00C3MOUQI,"In past MOD released that comes with closed captioned, over season 2-6, 8-9, 1 and 7 are from Paramount, so now 10-11 didn't not?! Are you Freaking Kidding?!",1367971200,,157,4.642857142857143
5690318,5,B00C3MOUQI,"I had a good time watching this as an introduction for family members to The Amazing Race. It has memorable characters, and the competitiveness really made for more drama and better t.v. than a normal season. I would definitely recommend this season!",1389139200,,250,4.976190476190476
5690319,5,B00C3MOUQI,loved seeing some favorite teams again-interesting to see the contrast with their original seasons as to how the teams interacted,1386288000,,129,5.5
5690320,1,B00C3MOUQI,"I gave this a one star rating because the quality of the DVDs for this set were unbelievably bad not for the show itself. When I initially ordered this set, I had ordered it along with Seasons 6, 8, 9 and 10 - seasons 6, 8 and 9 were in perfect condition but this set as well as season 10 arrived with discs 1 and 2 badly scratched in both sets. So Amazon sent me a replacement for both sets and were nice enough to not have me ship the defective ones back. However, once again, discs 1 and 2 in both sets were badly scratched. Again, Amazon sent me another replacement for both sets but yet again both sets arrived with the same result - discs 1 and 2 badly scratched in both sets. After all this, Amazon refunded me my money for both sets which is great and all but I really wanted to add Seasons 10 and 11 to my collection.

What bothers me most with this is the fact that discs 1 and 2 arrived badly scratched every single time but yet the other seasons of Amazing Race I have purchased from Amazon were in perfect condition. Learn from my mistake, do not buy this set or season 10!",1383609600,3,1086,4.098591549295775
5690321,5,B00C3MOUQI,Amazing Race is one of my favorite shows. It allows one to travel the world while sitting at home enjoying the competition.,1381708800,,123,4.636363636363637
5690322,5,B00C3MOUQI,"I have watched amazing races since season 1, LOVE LOVE LOVE them, I was hoping for extras on the dvd, But other than that, they are great.

Thank You,

5690323,5,B00C3MOUQI,"It was so much fun to see former teams race again.  I'm a latecomer to the show & did not watch the show regularly until season 17.  Now I am trying to catch up.  Where are seasons 12, 13, 15, and 16?  Amazon Instant Video has seasons 14 and 17-22.

My only complaint is that disk 3 was defective and kept freezing.  Amazon replaced the set next-day and with no hassle at all.  Keep up the good work Amazon, and more seasons on DVDs please.",1376179200,2,440,4.105882352941176
5690324,5,B00C3MOUQI,"If you are a fan of the Amazing Race, you don't want to miss a single season.  Although the basic idea behind the show is the same season to season, there are always new twists and turns..... and you really never can predict how teams will react and interact.",1373932800,,259,4.285714285714286
5690325,5,B00C3MOUQI,I really enjoy the Amazing Race. Every Season gets better and Better. On my travels I love seeing the same places that the racers have been.,1373587200,,140,4.423076923076923

5690327,5,B00C3MOUQI,"Best reality show ever (check their awards).  Our kids follow each race, we have made it a family affair, and we are using it to have them learn more about places in the world they want to visit.",1371427200,,195,4.131578947368421

8577155,5,B00C3MOUQI,"This season is the first ""all-stars' race. Except for one team that previously won the race, the rest are hardly all-stars. But the competition is as exciting as usual and most of the various tasks are interesting. I have watched almost every Amazing ace season and this is one worth seeing for yourself.",1420848000,,304,4.754716981132075
8577156,5,B00C3MOUQI,Another winner. Watched twice already and will probably watch again.,1417996800,,68,5.9
