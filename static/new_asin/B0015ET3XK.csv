3144275,5,B0015ET3XK,"I chose to review this product as it is the closest thing to being able to review all the pixar movies without reviewing each individual one. I love all of them. The only one that I kind of thought could have been a little better was WALL-E. It was a fine movie for adults, but it does not catch my son's attention fast enough to make him want to watch it. He loves the rest of the movies, and can't get enough of them. His favorite ones are Cars, Monster Inc., and Ratatouille. Pixar movies seem to be all he wants to watch everyday. I haven't seen UP yet, but from what I have heard, I am looking forward to seeing it. The thing I really like about these movies, is that they a very kid friendly, and you don't have to worry about your kids seeing or hearing things that they shouldn't, unlike a lot of the Dreamworks cartoons. The other nice thing about these movies is that they are enjoyable for adults to watch with your kids. They are not corny like most cartoons out there today. I would recommend any these films to anyone who likes to watch movies with there kids, or just likes to watch movies to take themselves back to their childhood.

So if don't own any of this films, and would like to, this set is a great place to start. The only one it doesn't have in it is WALL-E.",1244160000,,1285,4.181451612903226
3144276,5,B0015ET3XK,"Seriously, if you are a huge Pixar fan like I am, then this movie collection is well worth it.

I took it out and looked at the disc (first time ever played) and it looked smudged but it wasn't dirty, it was actually ingrained into the disc in a spot. We had to skip through a few scenes to watch the movie, very disappointing.
If it wasn't for that, the set has been great so far (we're about 3/4 through the movies, haven't touched any of the numerous bonus disc). Nice collection of movies, lots of bonus discs.

Instead, I want to say a few words about this specific collection. Amazon has many of the details wrong in their description (though they have changed some of them recently). I ordered this from Amazon a few days ago so can tell you exactly what you are getting.

Even though the product specs say the films are 4:3, they are not. Each of the films is available in widescreen and a few are available in both widescreen and fullscreen. So widescreen snobs like me have nothing to worry about--you'll get the full 16:9 experience. Also, the set comes with 14 DVDs, not 8 as Amazon first stated. There are two discs for most of the films with one for a couple of them. In most cases the second DVD is full of the standard extras.

So here is what you're getting: all of the Pixar films up through Ratatouille. They are all widescreen (with a few having the option to watch in fullscreen) and all have at least some extras. The package comes in a nice ""accordian style"" case where each of the fourteen ""pages"" holds one of the DVDs.

And this appears not to have any new special materials to make it worth buying if you are someone like me.  But if you are not, this is a great collection.  It contains the first eight (and as of writing this review only eight) Pixar films.  All of which have received Oscar recognition.

The following are the films included:

Toy Story - Special Oscar Recipient and nominated for three Oscars (writing, music and song) - What do your toys do when you are not around? - Starring Tom Hanks as cowboy Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear

A Bug's Life - Oscar Nominee (Music) - Flik's village is ravaged every year by the Grasshoppers and he goes off to find warrior bugs to help defend it but all he finds is a circus troop.  Many people have said that this film was inspired by Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai.  Voices include Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey and Phyliss Diller

Toy Story 2 - Oscar Nominee (Song) - This time around, Woody is stolen by a toy collector.  It's Buzz Lightyear (and Gang) to the rescue.  But does Woody want to be rescued.  Featuring Joan Cusack as Jessie, the Yodeling Cowgirl and Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head.

Monster's Inc. - Oscar Winner (song) and nominated (Animated Film, Score and Sound Editing) - Monsters are sent to scare children through magic doors but what happens when a child finds it way to the monster's world.  Can love beat hate?  Featuring Billy Crystal and John Goodman

For the Incredibles it is raise a family but will they return to their superhero life when the world is threatened by an old nemisis?  Featuring the voices of Holly Hunter, Craig T Nelson and Samuel L Jackson

Cars - Oscar Nominee (Animated Film and Song) - This is the best of the group.  This film actually is a study about professional athletes who become egomaniacs with their success.  Lightning McQueen is the newest superstar on the Piston Cup circuit and he is full of himself.  His ego gets in his way during the final race of the season and causes a three way tie for the coveted Piston Cup.  On his way to the raceoff he get lost in Radiator Springs, a sleepy little town that has gotten all but vanished when the freeway passed it by.  Lightning finds the true meaning of life and friendship.  Featuring the voices of Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Katherine Helmond and Owen Wilson. (The film has a Pixar retrospective of John Ratzenberger that is wonderful)

Ratatouille - Oscar Winner Best Animated Film and nominated for Screenplay, Score, Sound Mixing and Sound Editing - What happens when the world's greatest chef is a field rat?  He goes to Paris and teams up with the inept son a his favorite chef.  This is a great farce and a new step for the Pixar franchise. Featuring the voices of Peter O'Toole, Ian Holm and perennials Brad Garret and John Ratzenberger

Once again this is a great collect but is just a compilation of the previously released dvd's.  It would have been nice to include the shorts and Pixar documentaries plus something new.  But this will make a nice present for expectant mothers or toddlers who may not have the films yet.",1217030400,,3667,4.582181259600614

8258204,5,B0015ET3XK,"Ok so I have seen every single pixar film ever made. This set I have been wanting forever but with money being tight, I could never get my hands on it. Now it is between 6-900$$$? Are you kidding me? No one is ever going to buy a dvd set for that price unless they are rich & shameless. If it ever goes back down to maybe 150/175 then yeah I will go ahead & buy it but as of right now, that's just insane.",1399766400,,405,3.776470588235294
8258205,5,B0015ET3XK,We have definitely got our money worth from these videos.  The best part for us has been that most of the movies have two different formats (wide-screen and box ratio) on two separate DVDs.  We keep one copy in the house and the other copy in the car so we always have some entertainment available for the kids if needed.  Great quality and easy to keep them organized with the included multi-page storage binder.,1390262400,,413,4.554054054054054
8258206,3,B0015ET3XK,"The Disney-Pixar Ultimate Movie Collection (2008) includes eight of Pixar's full length films on DVD: Toy Story / Toy Story 2 / Finding Nemo / The Incredibles / A Bug's Life / Monsters, Inc. / Cars / Ratatouille. Each of the films is available in widescreen and a few are available in both widescreen and fullscreen. There are two discs for all the films except two. The second DVD is full of the standard extras. There is over 8 hours of extras in total. It ranks as the most complete Pixar collection to date. Some fans may prefer enjoying these films on Blu-ray (sold individually). The release of stand-alone Blu-rays for this set has made it less attractive. In the unreleased Blu-ray Pixar Collection there are six Disney/Pixar blockbusters: A Bugs Life, Cars, Pixar Shorts Vol. 1, Ratatouille, Wall*E and Monsters, Inc. 3 films, Finding Nemo, Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are not included in the Blu-ray collection. Eventually the Blu-ray set will get a broad US release so you can upgrade if you have been waiting for the collection.",1377302400,,1038,4.740331491712707
8258207,3,B0015ET3XK,"I love that you get 8 movies for $100. Not only are you getting the 8 different movies, but for 6 of the 8, there are 2 discs (bonus features), an unexpected surprise. As I only just got it in the mail today, and I am still at work, I haven't viewed the condition of any of them on the television. I am disappointed how the casing is already broken. You can tell that each dvd is in it's own holding case, like a cd case where there is more than one cd, not an actual dvd box. Anyways, the last dvd case, on the bottom left hand side, by the seam, is totally broken and in a couple sharp pieces. Probably not much bigger than 2 inches, but it still sharp, and broken. For being new, why is it cracked and falling apart already? I don't want my kid to cut himself on it when he gets or puts away a movie.
If you have a big CD case with sleeves that you put your dvds in, then I wouldn't be worried about this. But I don't, and was looking forward to having this box set collection sitting in with all my other collections. But, probably won't be for very long. Not very durable. Will need to find another case to put these in",1334016000,,1124,4.0
8258208,5,B0015ET3XK,"Since I have (or will) review each of these movies separately, I thought the best way to review this box set is by ranking the films by the number of times my children have watched the films (2 boys, now aged 2 and 4.5, I've had the set for one year).  I've also given a rating out of 5 stars based on my own opinion.

1. Cars (4 stars) - BY FAR the most popular with my boys.  Hotshot racecar Lightning McQueen gets lost while being transported across country, and ends up in desert-rural Radiator Springs where life is considerably slower than he's used to.  The opening race scene is amazingly good.  At 2 hours, perhaps a little long for one sitting.

2. Toy Story 2 (5 stars) - Woody the Cowboy is kidnapped by a collector who intends to sell him to a toy museum in Japan, and it's up to Buzz and others to rescue him.  Features a memorable visit to a Toys R Us-like store complete with a Barbie tour guide and a complete wall-full of Buzz Lightyears.

3. Ratatouille (4 stars) - a surprisingly engaging story about a rat who can cook.  He helps a young sous-chef make something of himself.  The ""climax"" with the food critic (and the eponymous dish of food) are surprisingly moving.  Oddly, the quality of the computer animation makes the rats creepier than, say, the mice/rats in Disney's Great Mouse Detective or The Rescuers.

4. The Incredibles (5 stars) - Forced into retirement amid lawsuits and public relation disasters, Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl are try to raise kids (also with super powers) like a normal family.  Craving adventure like the old days, Mr. Incredible gets drawn into a sinister plot and it's up to the rest of the family to rescue him.  Great fun all the way through.

5. Finding Nemo (3 stars) - visually spectacular story of a father Clown Fish's attempt to find and rescue his son, captured by a diver and put into a dentist's aquarium.  Unfortunately, it often feels like a string of action set pieces which makes it less enjoyable for an adult on repeated viewings.

6. Toy Story (5 stars) - the film that started it all: Sheriff Woody is replaced as Andy's favourite toy by upstart (and delusional) Buzz Lightyear.  But when they get lost they must  work together to find their way back to Andy's house.  Great fun and stands up very well on repeated viewings.

All 6 of the above have, at some point, been my elder son's favourite.  The final two are rarely (if ever) requested by either of my boys.

7. A Bug's Life (3 stars) - somewhat contrived second effort from Pixar, probably the least re-watchable film in this set.  Cars and toys lend themselves especially well to computer animation.  These bugs look blocky and generic, and the story is predictable animated adventure fare (and therefore a little dull).

8. Monster's Inc. (? stars) - I have never seen this film all the way through, because my boys simply do not watch it!  Perhaps that tells you everything you need to know about the film.

It's too bad this box set is no longer available - it was $75-ish when I bought it, and I've certainly got my money's worth.  All these films (except Bug's Life, and possibly Monster's Inc) are very rewatchable and can be enjoyed over and over, which is good because we all know how kids like to rewatch the same things over and over.....  6 of the 8 films are the 2-disc special editions (Cars and Ratatouille are not), so there's also lots of extras for the adult animation fan to enjoy after the kids have gone to bed.",1263427200,,3468,4.511217948717949
