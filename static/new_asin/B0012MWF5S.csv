8246871,4,B0012MWF5S,"This is a warm and funny film starring the ""New York City!"" coot guy from the TV commercials for Pace Pecante sauce. He's a lonesome mountain man into whose camp wanders a lost little girl (Trudy Barr). Turns out she's separated from her twin sister whose tormented father tied up with evil gunslinger Blacksly (Rex Cutter, Battlestar Galactica) and there's chases and shootouts as the Coot tries to rejoin the twins while outwitting both the evil father and enraged gunslinger. The twins wind up helping him and there is a very funny shoot out at the end of this funny, charming Western.  This film was made, released to good reviews (Three stars at Chicago Tribune) and then lost in a dispute between the studios LA lawyer and their backers so it is a very obscure item to find and well worth a look. Kids will love it.",1447113600,,821,4.585034013605442
