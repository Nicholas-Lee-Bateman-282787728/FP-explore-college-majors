7981346,3,B00008AOWN,"We've come to the final entry in The Cartoon Adventures of Larry-Boy.  The Good, the Bad, and the Eggly ends things on an average note, which isn't that surprising since most of these videos have been average.

As always, this offshoot from VeggieTales is hand drawn and centers around the alter ego of the show's regular host, Larry the Cucumber.  In this world, Larry is a rich millionaire who moonlights as Larry-Boy.  He always works at the local newspaper, the Daily Bumble, as the janitor to keep a pulse on what is happening so he can stop crime better.

Trouble is afoot in the town of Bumblyburg yet again.  This time around, Larry-Boy's rivals Greta Von Gruesome and Awful Alvin (and Lampy) have teamed up to steal a ray gun.  But it's not just any ray gun.  This one turns any inanimate object into over-easy eggs.

Naturally, Larry-Boy is on the case.  But fellow superhero Dark Crow is also in town, and both of them are trying to capture the villains by themselves.  Will that work, or do they need to team up to save the day?

Obviously, the theme of this one is working together.  And I can't complain about the theme at all since teamwork is important in all aspects of life.

However, once again the video isn't up to Big Ideas standards.  Yes, there are some fun jokes.  I loved watching Alvin (and Lampy) doing victory dances of evil.  Some of the things that got turned into eggs were pretty funny.  Heck, the scene where they are trying to explain to Larry-Boy what would and wouldn't turn into eggs was also great.

Yet I found the story all too predictable.  You can pretty much plot the entire story out from the summary I've given you.  Normally, a half hour with VeggieTales flies by.  Here, it doesn't.

There's the usual 8 minute short on the end to bring the story to a full half hour.  This time around, the short actually centers on two minor characters we've only seen from the superhero class before.  They proceed to destroy a fair until Larry-Boy shows up and convinces them to work together to restore things.  Again, there were some amusing bits, it overall it wasn't that funny.

These might be good for a very young audience, but they don't show the care and creativity that the original VeggieTales series has.  Only the most die-hard fan needs to see The Good, the Bad, and the Eggly.",1432080000,,2326,4.539759036144578
7981347,1,B00008AOWN,"Larry boy... The good, the bad, and the eggly has no mention of God nor any bible verses that kids should know. It appears to be just a feel good movie. Not good. The other larry boy and veggie tales do have them. I just don't know why this one has none.",1409788800,,254,3.9038461538461537

7981349,5,B00008AOWN,"My kids (3 & 5) love these animated Larry Boy cartoons. They watch them over and over and over and... you get the idea. I think they love them even more than the computer generated ones that Big Idea has made-- maybe because the animated ones are simply sillier. Also, I think my kids are a bit more removed from any ""scary"" villains because it is more cartoonish. Also, who couldn't love the character Lampy? Oh, and the Looney Tune-like shorts are simply classics! Anyway, a big thumbs up from my kids!",1329350400,,504,4.489130434782608
7981350,3,B00008AOWN,My 2 year old doesn't really care for this one.  He is used to seeing the computer animation so my only thought is the cartoon aspect doesn't appeal to him.,1327449600,,156,4.2
7981351,5,B00008AOWN,Another great video from Veggie Tales!  Stuff I don't mind my kids watching!  It teaches and entertains.,1174521600,,104,5.0588235294117645
