3528006,1,B001DB6J46,"This movie is nothing more than supposition and ignores one, stark reality.  Why would the United States benefit from 'keeping Africa down?'  The reality is, nothing.  Africa doesn't really offer anything to the world.  The Western World pours BILLIONS into that continent with little to no return.  So why bother?  The problem with this 'documentary' is that it heavily relies on the America is Evil mentallity in order to 'prove' a point... and it never does.  Nothing but a bunch of loons raving about how they have the facts... just like the loons who have all the facts about UFOs and Bigfoot.

Secondly, has the United States done horrible things?  Sure... what nation hasn't?  That's the problem with this steaming pile; they forget that through ALL of human history that nations do wrong.  The end.  But to lay all blame (which this film tries to do) on the United States and the Western World is the height of stupidity and ignorance.",1388102400,,943,4.788819875776397
3528007,5,B001DB6J46,very good documentsary on African exploitation. the world has never cared about Africa or it's peoples. this tells that story.,1370995200,,126,5.35
3528008,5,B001DB6J46,"Irrespective of your color or race, watching this documentary will serve as an eye opener on how America has steadily committed genocide and looting of the people of Africa and their resources for several decades.

America installed several African presidents so as to dictate the economy of several nations while also igniting wars and riots in order to De-populate those same nations.

Real live interviews, footage as well as confidential recordings provides a solid evidence of the evil that goes on in the American government.",1332374400,2,531,5.235294117647059
3528009,5,B001DB6J46,"I have suggested this film to many people who found it jaw dropping. This depicts a grim reality of blood on the USA's hands, but you really need to see it for yourself.
There is no just cause the the 20,000,000 (and counting) who have perished.
This is a harsh reality check, unless you are racist- you may not care how many people have been murdered and brutally tortured for your diamonds +
I find it devastating.",1307145600,3,416,4.415584415584416

8292544,5,B001DB6J46,"Terrific film, a must-see wakeup call for americans. I had a group of friends over to watch it and all were impressed.",1426377600,,118,4.409090909090909

8292548,5,B001DB6J46,"Yes, it seems one sided to the western population; but, it was all true. Patrice was murdered and the US had its hands deep in it. It's no secret that the majority of weapons these countries get their hands on are purchased from agents of the U.S.  After all, we trained the people who flew planes into our own trade center. And, it is no secret, that every single time the U.S. has aided a non-white or non-caucasian country they have ended up in horrific war and a dismal economic state. This film was on point and I don't think it's an attack on whites or individual Americans, I believe the attempt was made to show that America may, and has ulterior motives.",1408838400,,663,4.390243902439025
8292549,5,B001DB6J46,"Superb and MOST NEEDED revelations as to what the U.S. and other countries do to Africa - routinely over MANY decades - and directly, purposefully, and predictably - causing unimaginable suffering and mass numbers of dead!!!  Nixon is nailed, on tape, as a major promoter of our SICK, shocking, heartless actions!  I was never so well informed about what was really happening... Apocalypse Africa: Made in America, connects more dots than ever - Great work!!!",1392336000,,459,5.1066666666666665
8292550,5,B001DB6J46,"A magnificent documentary film about how racist U.S. Presidents (ie.- for example - LBJ and Nixon), the CIA, foreign corporations (like Firestone), numerous other Presidents (like Reagan), as well as other nations (like Holland, Portugal, many others) --- have continued policies and actions that fostered genocidal results ALL OVER AFRICA - and as stated by a policy called NSSM 200 - this actually was done ON PURPOSE!!!  Displaying dirty secrets and often unimaginably horrible events - the film for the most part starts with 1957 - and basically shows that it is still happening through today.",1390608000,,597,5.21875
8292551,5,B001DB6J46,"The picture becomes so clear.  After watching this I now have taken off my rose colored glasses and I can see that the government is capable of anything. The powers that be and the webs go so deep that the government can do literally ANYTHING they want, without repercussion.  Before watching this movie, I saw a review calling it anti-American. But with FBI records, presidential voice recordings and facts, it is truth.  I don't see it being anti-American, I see it being what it is, the depth that ANY nation would go to to stay on top.  Pitting one country against another is no exception to the game.",1390435200,3,605,4.574074074074074
