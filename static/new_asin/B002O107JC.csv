8375769,3,B002O107JC,"This programs shows pre-colonial martial arts, weapons, land surfboards, etc.  Further, we learn things about Kamehameha.  He did some things that 21st-century viewers might find uncivilized.  The work does mention Western contact, but says little about it.  There is a way in which this is multy-culty: the narrator shows respect for a non-European culture and learns from and stands in support of a group of men of color.  Still, the work is a bit hawkish.  The vibe is: ""Three cheers for fighting and wars and weapons worldwide!""  The narrator, although probably credentialed, has a surfer-dude voice that may irritate some.  I think people who enjoy this may want to see the show where Henry Rollins discusses ""the warrior gene.""",1428537600,,733,5.100840336134453
