8202830,5,B000RWN8WI,"I have been cooking old Italian recipes from my family for a long time. Everyday Italian helped me expand, and gave me ideas for foods I already make, but to make them taste better. Giada keeps the recipes pretty traditional but the simplistic things we would never think of to make it taste better (like cracked pepper vs table pepper) she does in her recipes and just amazing! The food is healthy, and cheaper than eating out, yet you feel like you are eating out every time you cook these recipes! Giada is the biggest inspiration for making food fun for cooking/baking/grilling. I would recommend these shows to anyone.

The seller I purchased from was very quick with shipping, and the item looked like it came off of a new bookstore shelf in top condition. Item arrived as described and I would trust this seller for future items.",1288742400,4,836,4.648648648648648
