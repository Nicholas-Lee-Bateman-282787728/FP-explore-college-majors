8684899,3,B00OU4MT6U,"I found this in the $5 bin at Walmart, and I bought it mainly to see the original 1959 version of House on Haunted Hill. Out of 13 movies in this collection, only two are actually worth buying. Thankfully I got lucky and House on Haunted Hill was one of them, but the rest have dreadful audio and picture quality, making them all but unwatchable.

You definitely get what you pay for in this set. Pay close attention to the dates. Most of these are B-movies from the 70s and 80s, and they look as though the film negatives have been sitting on a dusty shelf for the last 30 years. Now don't get me wrong - I love cheesy B-movies, and I have a particular fondness for just about anything that came out of the 80s. My critique isn't about the movies themselves. It's just that these films look and sound *really* bad. I don't know how a movie can be grainy, blurry, and streaky all at the same time, but most of these manage it.

There are no subtitles, and the audio on most sounds as though you're listening to them underwater. I normally watch my tv at a volume of about 20, but I had these cranked up to 40 and still found myself straining to understand what the characters were saying. Two of the movies are dubbed over, making it even harder to understand because I couldn't watch lips for clues.

For $5 I certainly don't expect digitally re-mastered movies or anything, but I was still disappointed at how bad these looked and sounded. In their present condition they aren't worth releasing to dvd, and I'm surprised Mill Creek even bothered. At least 6 of them aren't even watchable, and the rest aren't worth my time to try to sit through - with TWO exceptions: The Screaming Skull and House on Haunted Hill. Both are black and white movies from the late 50s, and the audio is excellent on both. House on Haunted Hill has a decent picture, and the picture on The Screaming Skull is so crystal clear that it almost looks like a Blu-ray disc (go figure, right?).

If you're expecting a gold mine of ""classic"" horror movies, then you're probably going to be disappointed. Buy a frozen pizza instead - it'll be far more enjoyable. But if you're looking for decent copies of House on Haunted Hill (in the ORIGINAL black & white) and/or The Screaming Skull, then this set is definitely worth buying. After all, $5 for a double feature is still a great price.",1430092800,2,2360,4.443418013856813

8684901,5,B00OU4MT6U,"At Death's Door 13 film multi-pack is anather Multi-pack by Mill Creek Entertainment.  This is another one of those ""Take it or leave it"" type of Multipacks.  As many already know, I WILL TAKE IT!!!!!  While half of these I already have and/or already have seen,  that leaves 6 to 7 films I haven't watched already.  Like Carnage, Cathy's Curse, Funeral Home (It won a ""Genie"" Award in Canada), & Lurkers.  So I am eager to watch these & the other ones I haven't seen before.
  Like I have said before, I love my cheese!  & Mill Creek does deliver.  By the way, Mill Creek Entertainment over the last 2 to 3 years has REALLY made headway into ditsibuting some very excellent other items as well.  Like very popular TV Shows for example.  Some EXCELLENT documentarys (I have some of these), etc.  So they are not just about cranking out Multi-Packs of low budget, public domain films.  So for all you Ladies & Gentlemen who just think that's all Mill Creek does, crank out multi-packs of bad, low budgett, public domain films, think again!
(Yes that was a serious plug for Mill Creek Entertainment's other excellent selection of Movies, Quality TV Shows, & Documentaries)",1422835200,6,1170,4.671568627450981
8684902,3,B00OU4MT6U,"Yes, this type of horror collection will find it's way into the $5 bin at Walmart and if you already own a few of them, then you've probably have seen most of the films in this set. Most of these movies are in the public domain, except for a few that are from Crown International Pictures, Inc., so the picture quality of the films aren't exactly the best.

A major highlight in this set is the underrated 1980 horror flick Funeral Home (93 mins; Rated R) about a young woman spending the summer at her grandmother's to help turn the farmhouse into a bed & breakfast, but then a few of the guests turn up dead. The young woman starts to investigate the strange sounds coming from the basement and discovers a family secret. Despite an R rating, the film's violence isn't very bloody compared to other horror movies from that era.

The weird Luckers (1988; 94 mins; Rated R) is about a woman who has been tormented ever since her mother killed her father when she was a just a young girl. She starts having strange dreams and starts to believe that something from the supernatural world is coming to get her. This has some of the worst acting I have ever seen and despite the slow pacing, I actually liked it.

One of my favorite low-rated horror films is on this set - Don't Look In The Basement (1973; 90 mins; Rated R). The film centers on a nurse arriving at a mental hospital in the middle of nowhere just as the patients start dying off! It is a crazy film!

There are two classic films on the set: House On Haunted Hill (1959; 75 mins; NR) and The Terror (1963; 80 mins; NR), as well as Carnage (1983; 92 mins; Rated R), Cathy's Curse (1977; 82 mins; Rated R); The Ghost (1963; 96 mins; NR); Legacy Of Blood (1971; 83 minutes; Rated R); The Murder Mansion (1972; 84 minutes; NR); Tormented (1960; 75 minutes; NR); The Screaming Skull (1958; 68 minutes; Not Rated); and Terror Creature From The Grave (1965; 82 mins; NR).

Like I already said, some of the films don't have the best picture quality as Mill Creek Entertainment used whatever copies that were given to them. I know that some horror fans will be upset over this, but it doesn't bother me at all. The retail for the DVD set is under 10 dollars, so you shouldn't complain too much, as you are getting 13 movies for a cheap price. Overall, I have enjoyed watching a handful of these old horror films on the At Death's Door: 13 Fright-Filled Films DVD set!
