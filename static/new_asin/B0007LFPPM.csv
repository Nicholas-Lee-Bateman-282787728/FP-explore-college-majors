8048269,5,B0007LFPPM,"the only bad thing of this movie was how short it was,only an hour and 1/2. But in that short time u love the actors and the chemistry that they have with eachother. Funny scenes btwn Damian and Marcos, who has this way of telling a joke with a dead-serious face. Joaquin was the best and the cute love story he had with Laura. Not going to lie didn't get all the jokes the first time, but the second time everything was heard and understood. Its true this movie is a must see. Mariano excellent and gorgeous actor.",1241568000,2,515,4.26530612244898

8048271,5,B0007LFPPM,"One of the greatest movies ever produced that captures reality the way it truly is.  From misunderstandings between couples, to arguments with your best friends and family... No Sabe, No Contesta has it all. It is funny, sad and the characters' thoughts and theories are just amazing.",1171670400,4,284,5.042553191489362
8048272,5,B0007LFPPM,I first saw No Sabe No Contesta on one of the Spanish Movie stations on Cable and I just loved it. So many parts of it made me laugh and it's a fabulously made movie... It's quite complex but the love story in it is so cute and I just love how innocent the love in it is when it starts out. It's hard to find movies now a days where the people spend so much casual time together at first being shy before they end up in bed together. It was a well made movie.,1129939200,10,459,3.7916666666666665
