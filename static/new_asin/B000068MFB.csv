1725321,5,B000068MFB,"Well what can I say, as a UK viewer the show is the best yet, using animals as Zords again is great, better that just trains and cars, Saban has done everything they can to bring the show up to date.  Why complain these actors are true martial artists, who know what they are doing; teanagers or adults it doesn't matter the show is the best yet, the music and the opening are great.  Saban and disney together make a great team I think.",1038787200,4,437,4.190476190476191
1725322,3,B000068MFB,"Disappointing opening video for Power Rangers Wild Force, but it does show promise. Time will tell on how better the show will become.",1032307200,4,134,4.869565217391305
1725323,4,B000068MFB,"Now this really is more like it! After the disappointing Lion Heart video, we finally get to see what Power Rangers Wild Force can really do. What we've basically got here is four episodes edited together. Throughout the story we are introduced to new zords, about one per episode. All of this is great fun, although personally I feel bad for the old zords that get rejected for the new zords. That's right! The old zords don't get destroyed or anything. This has happened several times in Mighty Morph'n Power Rangers, Power Rangers In Space and Power Rangers Lost Galaxy to name just a few. Here, the old zords just get put aside so that the new zords can form a new combination. You see the thing is, some zords clash with each other. For instance, imagine a lion with giant bear arms. Might be a bit of a strain on the lion. Get the idea? Also, the theme song of Power Rangers Wild Force is nowhere near as catchy as Power Rangers Time Force, however if you happen to have Dolby Surround which I do, it is great to hear the roar of the wild animals. Add this to your collection, and then wait for the next Power Rangers Wild Force videos!",1032220800,6,1142,4.366197183098592

1725333,3,B000068MFB,"Ok....this season, in my opinion, only had three bright spots, hence the three stars. Something was just off about this season. Here is what I did like
1. Jindrax and Toxica: their friendship helped carry this series...fun to watch...
2. The team up with Time Force: I really liked the time force season....I was happy to see them again..
3. Forever Red: the anniversary episode....dope reunion
I was really into the finale but when it got to part 2, I just thought that was a cheap time saver..... Master Org is really the only villain besides ivan ooze to give the rangers a real challenge.....",1461628800,,596,4.685714285714286

1725335,5,B000068MFB,"Over the years, the Power Rangers have gone through several incarnations that include dinosaurs, space colonies and even a faction from the future. But this team, which uses animals instead of dinosaurs is probably my most favorite.

This team of Rangers' villains are probably the most sinister. Led by the villainous Master Org, the Orgs are awaken after a long sleep to conquer the world through pollution and causing mayhem. Another great thing on these villains is that the villain generals all resemble the parts of a face. And they have Master Org in his final form resemble all three of his generals.

And I also liked seeing all the Red Rangers from years gone by coming together against an old enemy in the Machine Empire (the Zeo Rangers' enemy).

Out of all the earliest seasons of Rangers, this one has probably the best storyline, two team up episodes (with Time Force and the Red Rangers), the vilest of villains and the greatest of Zords who bond with the Rangers.",1461369600,2,980,4.752941176470588
1725336,3,B000068MFB,"The 10th season of Power Rangers with a neat animal theme. While this is not my favorite season it does have some neat concepts. This season has probably the best villain storyline with the Orgs. Plus this season has 2 of the best team-up episodes of the entire franchise (including the now infamous ""Forever Red"" episode. But like I said it's not the best in my opinion. Some of the sagas are a little mediocre, the writing and acting isn't great, and in the realms of the goofy at times (even for this show).",1453680000,2,510,4.4361702127659575
1725337,4,B000068MFB,"This season had 3 different writing teams 4 different sets producers While Disney Inc. Shifted production from Saban co. Some episodes was awful some showed Disney's potential for the Power Rangers franchise, 9th best season overall. Ninja Storm & Dino Thunder are much better showed Disney was just cutting teeth on this season",1453507200,,328,5.2075471698113205
1725338,5,B000068MFB,Finally Power Rangers Wild Force is being released on dvd. I remember when this season was being aired new in 2002. Disney does an excellent job having their first shot at Power Rangers (even if they only worked on the 2nd half of the season.) Once again one of the best seasons of Power Rangers ever. Don't miss this chance to add it to your collection. Coming spring 2016!,1453161600,,374,4.434782608695652
