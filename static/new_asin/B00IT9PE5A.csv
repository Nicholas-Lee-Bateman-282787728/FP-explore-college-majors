I was amazed to see maturity beyond their young years as these children articulate how they feel from their personal accounts. As a military wife and mother, this was a powerful reminder to tune into their feelings and validate their individual needs to express themselves in various ways.  This DVD would be a valuable tool to pass on to teachers, coaches, friends etc to help shed insight into what may be going on beneath the surface of so many military youth around us! Thank you Professor child for helping giving our military kids a voice to be heard!",1397433600,2,726,4.62015503875969
