Too bad though, the modern-day ""politically correct"" Disney corporation didn't leave the full name intact as in  the 1957 release of the film: ""Johnny Tremain and the Sons of  Liberty"".",962582400,4,342,4.683333333333334
858301,4,6304400810,"This is an enjoyable Disney rendition of the causes of the American Resolution.  No, it may not be faithful to the novel, and some of the historical events may not ring true to how they actually happened, however  I am sure Disney did not intend them to be.  This movie was made in 1957,  the same time frame that Davey Crockett played by Fess Parker was made,  America was caught up in patriotic fever and Disney was more than happy to  serve this up to the viewing public. I did enjoy this movie, and the  overall theme it was trying to portray, such as freedom from tyranny, the  rights of every man from the wealthy to the silversmiths apprentice. This  may not be a movie to analyze the Revolutionary War with, however it is a  great starting point to discuss the Revolution with young ones, and those  who do not know very much about the American Revolution.  An enjoyable film  that is recommended to those who like Disney and ""light history"".",959990400,25,950,4.485380116959064
858302,1,6304400810,"As a former teacher and a library specialist who works withchildren, I am frequently asked if it is OK to watch the movie""Johnny Tremain"" instead of reading the book. My answer is a resounding NO!  Unfortunatly by changing the ending of the film to a happy one, Disney totally destroys the overiding theme of the novel. Not killing off the character of ""Rab"" at the end of the movie makes the ""James Otis"" speech about why the revolution has to be fought become nothing more than the ranting of a lunatic member of the Boston Observers.(which many of them felt Otis was until the revolution actually started. The acting over all is good in the film,but recommending it to a student in lieu of reading the book is just not right.  I did like Walter Sande's Paul Revere and Jeff York's James Otis as well as Sebastian Cabot's merchant Lyte. I don't think that Hal Stalmaster conveyed much of Johnny's early arrogance though. I would really like to see someone like History Channel or A & E remake this film and really do it justice!  Thanks",956620800,31,1038,4.56989247311828

858556,5,6304400810,"I have not read the book, and apparently the movie deviated from the book.

The movie is a fictionalized account of the events early in the American Revolution - the Boston Tea Party, Lexington, Concord, etc.  It is fictionalized because Johnny Tremain was a fictional character placed into the real events and among the real people of the 1770's.  The basic reasons for the war and the early battles are depicted accurately.

The story is entertaining.  The movie is well acted and features character actors that made names for themselves in other movies and television shows.

The movie makes it easy to understand the connection between British efforts at gun control, the Paul Revere ride, Lexington and Concord.  The British went north from Boston to seize guns (and Sam Adams and John Hancock).  Paul Revere rode ahead to warn the colonists, who then gathered at Lexington.  The colonists stopped them at Concord and harassed them all the way back to Boston. The Battle of Bunker Hill was the British attempt to break out of Boston and end a siege (although this part was not depicted in the movie).  These events are usually depicted separately in history books and in schools. Placing them all in one story (especially the British attempt at gun control) promotes a better understanding of history and the causes and effects.",1510444800,3,1333,4.910714285714286
858557,5,6304400810,"Happy 60th Anniversary to Walt Disney's 1957 classic ""Johnny Tremain""!!!!

Based on the book of the same name by Esther Forbes, the story centres on a young boy named Johnny Tremain who lived in late 18th-century Boston, Massachusetts. The story takes place mostly in the city or Boston as Johnny is learning of what it's like to fight for American independence as rebellion builds up to the point of the beginning of the American Revolution.

So far, there has been only one film adaptation of Esther Forbes's book and that is the one made by the Walt Disney Company. The film, released on June 19, 1957, features Hal Stalmaster (likely his first acting role) in the role of Johnny Tremain and a whole cast of either menacing or endearing characters played by Luana Patten as Priscilla Lapham (Johnny's girlfriend) and Sebastian Cabot as Mr. Lyte.

The film also features historical figures who played their roles in the rebellion for American independence. These historical figures include: Samuel Adams (played by Rusty Lane), Dr. Joseph Warren (played by Walter Coy), Mr. James Otis (played by Jeff York), and Paul Revere (played by Walter Sande)

This is no doubt one of my all-time favorite movies; mainly because I'm a lover of American history (mostly on the American Revolution and the Civil War). Even Walt Disney himself was a lover of American history; which is why most of his live-action projects are centered on certain parts of American history (i.e. ""The Swamp Fox"", ""Davy Crockett"", etc.).

Being only 1 hour and 20 minutes long, the film is set up with a 21-month time-period which involves three historical events; going from the summer of 1773 to the spring of 1775. The three historical events that take place throughout the film are:

1. The Boston Tea Party (December 16, 1773).
2. Paul Revere's Ride (April 18/19, 1775).
3. The Battles of Lexington and Concord (April 19, 1775).

If there's one thing that I truly appreciate about ""Johnny Tremain"", it would be that it's not one of those history movies that rushes itself to get to the action segments quicker; like how most of today's modern TV shows on American history has been doing. Instead, ""Johnny Tremain"" takes it's time to introduce us to the setting and the characters and let us get to learn about them and what their part of the story will help lead the rebellion for American independence while at the same time, nicely pacing it all to an intense yet exciting climax where the Shot Heard Around The World is finally fired.

Sadly, I find this to be one of Disney's most underrated movies mainly because it's one of the kind that's not talked about a lot these days, which is sad because, to me, it's one of the best live-action films that Disney has ever made. I remember seeing the film for the first time back in elementary school and I hadn't even read the book before, even back then.

In conclusion, ""Johnny Tremain"" is a well-done well-structured American-Revolution movie with beautiful historical sets, great colonial costumes, a brilliant cast, catchy music (i.e. the theme song ""We're The Sons Of Liberty""), and amazingly well-crafted reenactments. It is an important part of Disney history and definitely a Disney Classic and I highly recommend it to anybody who is currently learning about American history; especially on the American Revolution.",1510272000,,3348,4.901060070671378

He balked at first, but by the time we were 10-15 minutes into the movie, he was totally into it and watched it enthusiastically to the end.  Since the hero is a young boy, and it hits the main episodes in Boston that led up to the ""shot hear 'round the world,"" I think it is a pretty good for kids to watch.",1502409600,,475,4.042553191489362

858747,5,6304400810,"Not realistic of the horror of the American Revolution like say, Mel Gibson's The Patriot, but that's the point: A show to get the idea of loving our country and freedoms with a little education about how they worked out the government system here (and how much they disagreed on it!)  without terrifying the children.  There IS shooting and death, but very 1950's Disney variety, but it didn't pretend like it wasn't really war.  The 3 and 5 year olds didn't pay rapt attention of course, but the rest of us did (ages 8 to adult). I do know the 3 and 5 year olds 'catch' a lot of information even if they don't sit and stare however especially as we discussed it.  Also hubby pointed out the change in warfare styles is displayed from marching into each other to ""guerrilla warfare"" was notable.  Also touches upon class warfare of sorts as well as traditional skills. Would make a great base for a unit study for homeschoolers, school teachers, or families who want to do something over the summer.  We bought it and we'll rewatch every Independence Day - at least until we can all The Patriot and others but we'll probably have grandkids by then anyway.  If you have ever seen Jimmy Stewart's Shop Around The Corner Keep your eye out for the young Shop messenger Rudy as one of the horse handlers here!

The acting is fine, the Sons of Liberty song is catchy (I can still sing most of it), and overall the movie does a great job of getting kids interested in history.

The main point in its favor is that it told the story of America's birth through the eyes of a young man, thus enabling its audience to identify with the protagonist in the movie.

This film, Johnny Tremain, is one of Disney's tributes to the founding of the country in the American Revolution. It focuses on Boston in the years immediately before the ""shot heard round the world"" as it involved the fictional character of Johnny Tremain, an apprentice silversmith, caught up in the events of the outbreak of war.

Johnny's story is the story of the outbreak of war for the sake of liberty - a concept that made a common man like Johnny the equal of the wealthy noble. James Otis, Sam Adams, Paul Revere and the other leading lights of the Boston ""Sons of Liberty"" make their appearances as Johnny's life parallels that of the rise of a new country founded on liberty and freedom. Events such as the Boston Tea Party and the Battles of Lexington and Concord are played out from the perspective of the young Bostonian.

The film isn't like movies of today with their special effects and gritty realism. No, this is a highly stylized, patriotic, perhaps simplistic account of events in a story focusing on the common man. There is an innocence in this film I find refreshing. The British leaders themselves are shown as men of honor doing their duty, dreading bloodshed with the colonists even as the Patriot leaders are men of conviction, willing to sacrifice their very lives for freedom and liberty.

I enjoyed this window to a simpler time when Americans loved their country and didn't look for reasons to fault it. I enjoyed this film and recommend it to those interested with five stars.",1437264000,12,1759,4.833887043189368

Quibble if you must about his faithless rendition, it's still a rousing good tale filled with excitement and plenty of action.  The history isn't exactly accurate, but then this is a fictionalized account so it really doesn't have to be text book precise.  The characters are all memorable.  I love that the British bad guys all have their very British accents while the Boston Brits have thoroughly Americanized accents before the fact.  Besides the issue of taxation without representation, they were also still under the strict rule of forced piety, no working on the Sabbath, it was a criminal offense.

Published during the Second World War it has never gone out of print since and rightly so. As source material it is perfectly suited to be given a movie adaption. And when the movie sticks to following the book it is rather entertaining in a 1950s Disney sort of way.

The first half hour is close enough to the book to entertain the fans. The character of Johnny has been changed from arrogant and cocky to pure and innocent in the best tradition of Disney films which can hardly come as a surprise but to expect anything else out of a kid's movie is to be let down. The second half hour loses the mood but keeps near the plot. The Boston Tea Party is entertaining although the singing after it is unforgivably Disney. But by the last half hour the book is thrown to the winds as we see the war first hand. Something about seeing laughing children dancing around the countryside as they shot at redcoats struck me as kind of disturbing for a Disney film. Obviously war was a great adventure that people could enjoy in a typical '50s fashion where nobody but the bad guys got hurt and everyone could share a nice drink afterward. Oh, and somebody who is supposed to die, whose death gives the entire book meaning, doesn't. That would be too dark for a Disney film.

Now if I thought that any of those additions were beneficial to the movie I couldn't really complain, but none of them worked. The first battle was alright but the psychotic murder kids having fun killing redcoats was just awful. The producers probably couldn't see why this might be considered 'creepy'. The acting from the lead is awful and he doesn't seem to have been in anything else afterward. The guy playing Rab seemed to bring a little of the distant charm described in the book but the script doesn't give him more than one or two moments. Walter Sande as Paul Revere was good as were a few of the founding fathers but nothing to write home about.

On the plus side the sets are marvelous. I've never seen colonial Boston come to life so well since (even the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Adams/dp/B001684L0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Adams</a>&nbsp;miniseries didn't really feel as lived in due to a slightly greater distance from its characters), largely due to an absence of Revolutionary War films. The Battle of Lexington is moderately well done rather obviously leaving open the question of who fired first. And the first half hour entertains. So in conclusion: good book, good sets, bad everything else. Remake anyone?",1407369600,,2850,5.137931034482759

859919,2,6304400810,"The key words to remember here are ""historical fiction,"" for that is what it most surely is.  God forbid that Disney would follow Forbe's great novel and kill off Rab at the end.  And whatever happened to Dove, Dusty, Isannah, and Miss Lavinia Lyte?  Even Mr. Tweedie has gone missing.  Disney's script writers certainly took liberties with the original text of Forbe's novel of the same name.  In the book, Johnny Tremain is a sharp-tongued teenager with a bad attitude, who puts down nearly anyone who walks or scrawls before him.  Disney has turned him into some precocious kid who is always asking questions when all of the other boys in this film just sit there in mute silence.  (They must be ""extras."")  And I cannot get that awful song ""We Are the Sons of Liberty"" out of my head.  Both the book and this movie leave the reader or viewer up in the air as to what happened next at its climax.  In the book Forbe's describes the destruction of life and property from the Battle of Lexington.  With Disney's version, it's about two teenage boys having fun shooting at British soldiers from behind trees with wonton disregard to the possibility of their own deaths ever occurring.  My suggestion: don't read the book and don't read about the origins of the American Revolution and you'll be just fine.  As my brother always said: ""It's a movie.""

I taught American History for 38 years in High School and though this is geared to 8th grade mentalities it is still a good quick lesson in the events of Boston and the times of Paul Revere, the Boston Tea Party and the Townshend Duties with a lightweight plot that can keep you interested.  This isn't a great film but a good one for a fairly accurate look at things in good old Boston at the time of the impending revolution.  Oddly enough there's no mention of the Boston Massacre.  Peter Ellenshaw designed the production and a lot of what you see on the screen is his wizardry as a matte artist.  He was incomparable, ultimately getting as Oscar for Mary Poppins.  You can get it for about $10.00 at Amazon.  I spent twice as much and got the deluxe edition with educational materials for the video.  You won't need them.

Samuel Adams had a bit part in the movie and the actor playing Doctor Warren was given his parts.  The Boston Tea Party is treated like a joke involving no danger at all.  There was no secrecy to the Sons of Liberty and very little to the Committee meetings and no threat of hanging or treason.  Alexander Hamilton wasn't in the movie at all.  Neither were Dove, Dusty, Madge, Dorcas, Lavinia Lyte, or many others.  The most glaring and strange difference was Johnny 's hand.

860252,4,6304400810,"When watching this film way back in 1956, and again many years later, I thoroughly enjoyed it because it fit very well with my historical interests, and there were not many good films about the Revolutionary War era out there.  Even nowadays, there are still very few that do the history of the war any real justice.  Mel Gibson's ""Patriot"" is an exception, and some good people who criticized that great film for its ""historical inconsistencies"" were themselves off base, for the most part.  However, and returning to Johnny Tremain, those who have similarly criticized this good film for some of the same reasons are missing the ""critique boat.""  The film is ""based on"" the book of the same name, and those who directed, produced, and acted in the movies brought it to the public for entertainment purposes and not for a bona fide history lesson.  I am a history professor who not only studied, wrote about, and performed in war, but who enjoys even fictional accounts of such struggles, and I do not become paranoid when war-based films depart from original scripts for the purpose of providing entertainment.  As it was written for this film, the story is excellent in many ways, though not necessarily a ""classic"" in the true sense, but it does provide a very touching story of the time, with some excellent actors demonstrating their considerable skills.",1383609600,4,1360,4.865800865800866

I remembered that occasionally it was shown on the Walt Disney Sunday movie

and there it was ""The Tree of Liberty""
I said ""there it is there is! it's the tree of liberty!!"" (I even remembered the song)

I did like that the kids could see the scenery, which was done pretty well for this movie, and get a better picture in their minds of what it was like to be there then.",1377475200,,405,3.8333333333333335
860256,5,6304400810,"This film was a product of the Cold War, and the lessons of rebelling in defense of liberty are strong. The characters are well developed, in the context of the story. I am especially impressed with its portrayal of James Otis, a founding member of the Sons of Liberty and the Massachusetts Committee of Correspondence. It was Otis who first wrote ""Taxation without representation is tyranny"". He was the victim of a head injury, which led to spells of violence and inhibited his conduct of business.

Mr. Otis is often overlooked in our views of the rebellion in Boston and its environs, in favor of Dr. Joseph Warren, Samuel Adams, and Paul Revere, but here he is given his due.  The story follows a young apprentice, with a kind, though strict, master, through his apprenticeship as a silversmith and as a patriot. You may also recognize Richard Beymer, who is probably best remembered as Tony in the film version of West Side Story.",1376784000,7,936,4.736196319018405

Has  fairly accurate reenactments of famous milestones of History.  Goes along with our US History books.  Seeing a movie that helps show the struggles our forefathers dealt with, and not just reading about it, brings it to home for this ""jaded"" generation in which everything comes so easily.  They are more apt to remember the information when it is visually and audible given...rather than just reading it on their own also.  The kids are the same age as the Johnny Tremain character and they were pretty honest about how they were not sure they could have been as brave as he was portrayed or lived as he did.

Though I recalled only fragments from back then, I knew I had to rent it again. So glad I did. This film is most definitely a period icon. Though some fan boards have rated it as classic-fiction, it most definitely is not. Brilliantly cast, produced, written, and directed it unfolds the American Revolution and Boston Tea Party quite colorfully.

Hal Stalmaster finely portrays the key character Johnny as an innocent youth caught up in middle of upending Colonial establishments vs. the British Parliament of 1774. Viewers will also recognize a familiar face from the classic West Side Story; Richard Beymer as Rab, a close friend of Johnny's, and one of the Liberty sanction leaders for the Revolution.

Is there dramatic license taken at times. Yep. But at the same time this is one of those movies that Disney, or anyone else, simply doesn't make any more. An unabashedly patriotic ode to the colonials who decided to shake off the shackles of a King and work to create a brand new nation.
The highlights for me were the recreations of the skirmish at Lexington Commons and the battle which began at Concord Bridge where the Minutemen, a bunch of merchants, farmers and ordinary folk took on what was then the most powerful military on the planet.

860560,5,6304400810,"Until recently, i had never even heard of this movie but saw it advertised and decided to purchase on the basis of my love for movies set in this period of American History.
What surprised me was some attention to detail often overlooked in most old War Of Independance movies, the Colonists and Rebels are portrayed as British subjects and Englishmen, fighting for their rights of Liberty and Freedom. In the movie, when The Sons Of Liberty meet to discuss their plans to revolt, you really get the feeling that this Revolution is being borne out of desperation to be heard by the King. This is of course historical fact, the Colonists repeatedly appealed courteously to King George, and as late as 1774-75,war could have been prevented.
But anyway apart from being a cracking good yarn, with wonderful cinematography and scenery, it's also a better representation of the people involved than Mel Gibsons Patriot film.
Sure its old fashioned and has that old style of moviemaking and characterisation which may seem amusing or cheesey to modern audiences, but for movie buffs with more versatile viewing modes, this movie should prove enjoyable.
Extras included are worth a look, Walt Disney himself talks about the causes of the Revolution and States that King George forgot that his subjects in America were freeborn Englishmen.
Not only that but he interestingly and accurately compares the Declaration of Independance to the 1215 Magna Carta, on which the basic rights of freedom and liberty for Englishmen were ratified, won and written down after a struggle with the Tyrant King John. It was this Ideaology which was adapted for the Independance Declaration, when British subjects once again rose to overthrow a Tyrant King, interesting stuff and more beneficial to any students of American History tham Mel Gibson's  fictional demonisation of the British wholesale.
Finally there are some colourful skirmishes which portray the early fights in the War, and show the harrassing guerilla tactics employed by the Continental Army. The only glaring innacuracy is a skirmish on a bridge which shows a British skirmish line break and run after sustaining just one volley of fire.
British troops were trained to sustain these sort of encounters by refilling their fallen ranks and a complete withdrawal would have been rare in this case and if so, commanded in an orderly fashion by firings covering volley, if it was felt a retreat necessary.
The sight of British troops high-tailing it and running would not have been something seen often in this war, or indeed in any war.
Apart from that, you just accept it for the entertainment value and enjoy it, a wonderful old fashioned adventure. I can never understand why Hollywood never exploited the Swashbuckling potential of this time period more often.",1337126400,,2804,5.06926406926407

I have recently returned to school and am currently taking an early American history class.  I got to thinking about this movie and how I've always had fond memories of it so I decided to see if I could find a copy.  Sometimes it's great to learn history through a movie and this is one of those movies.  Although classified as ""historical fiction"", it still imparts a lot of the facts surrounding the birth of our nation as a Republic.  I feel this movie is a must see for anyone wishing to revisit the events that shaped our nation.  It could especially benefit children of parents who are concerned about the quality of our current education system.  And, with a bit of sarcasm thrown in, it might do wonders for Janeane Garofalo who obviously is totally remiss about what the Boston Tea Party was truly about.  With the state of our country as it currently is in, it is more important now than ever that our children and young adults learn what it meant to our founding fathers to be an independent and free people.  Unfortunately, I feel a lot of what is being taught to our children today is actually designed to corrupt the ideals embraced in the concepts of morality, integrity, and values back when this nation was in just its' infancy.  The idea that people volunteered to represent their constituents' best interests and desires, without the sole purpose of becoming wealthy and/or all-powerful in the process, seems to have been lost over time.  Our founding fathers and early Statesmen served their fellow countrymen by listening to them and voting for what the majority wanted.  That's not the case in today's political arena. Today we are a government of a few ""select"" (oligarchy) with their own agenda; trying to force their beliefs, morals, and ideals on the people regardless of what the majority wants.

God deliver us from Preacher-Directors who use their director's chairs as pulpits.  All historical movies have some inaccuracies and most have many; even the acclaimed John Adams miniseries had several.  Even today's history textbooks are suspect.  The best way to learn history is to read the biographies of those who made it.  Read Washington, Jefferson, Adams, Franklin and others in their own words.  You can learn a lot about people and events by reading good biographies and autobiographies.

If you love America and want to share and pass on that legacy to your children, then I would recommend this movie to you.  There is an educational element, but I don't think that was ever the primary purpose of this picture.

As we grew older, a leftist segment of our generation accused the Disney group (then led by Walt himself) of trying to brainwash us with ""reactionary flag-waving values"", completely missing the fact that the characters in this story were radicals themselves. If some of us could theorize that Jesus was, why not a fictional young proto-militia soldier like Johnny Tremain? Johnny comes by his membership in the Sons Of Liberty in a peculiar way--he's an apprentice silversmith who receives a crippling on-the-job injury at a time when there was no such thing as Workman's Compensation or Disability. So his career is over when it barely just started. Fortunately Johnny's boss was involved in the emerging American Revolution, so since Johnny is no longer capable of becoming an artisan, he becomes a fighting man. Most people drawing a pension nowadays can't conceive of such ""safety nets"" as ""Comp"" not always being there. People who call themselves ""progressives"" don't realize just how far we've come and how lucky we are that real-life Johnny Tremains helped start this peculiar oft-unappreciated by its own citizens country we live in.

If you are a patriotic American at all, I think you will like this film. It includes the ""one if by land, two if by sea"" story, the Boston Tea Party, and Paul Revere's ride--all of major significance in the Revolutionary War.

Ultimately, the joy of this movie comes from the fact that our American forefathers were portrayed as patriots who would base their actions out of the principle of the matter rather than immediate convenience.

860834,4,6304400810,"I found it interesting reading many of the negative reviews of this movie. What people seem to forget is that this is a 1950's Disney movie.  It's not Braveheart.  Yes, I agree, it's not as good as the book, but many movies pale next to the books they're taken from.  There are 2 good things that should be recognized in these reviews.  1) In the 50's Disney chose to make movies about American History.  Today, the American Revolutionary period is all but forgotten in Hollywood and 2) the negative reviewers have made a very good point..the book is better.  Reading a book is a much better way to get the essence of a story vs. seeing the movie.  Keep reading!",1205712000,,662,4.466666666666667

(The main reason I bought it is that the Sons of Liberty song kept going through my head.)  In fact, I was entertained and pleased.  It's important to keep in mind that this was created as a two-part TV show in the 1950's, so the story is highly condensed and sanitized (for instance, a major character in the book has a better outcome in the movie).  Still, it makes a great companion to the book, and I can very well imagine a young person seeing this DVD and wanting to read the book and - - wonder of wonders - - maybe other books about the American Revolution.

860840,4,6304400810,"Jonathan Lyte Tremain is an apprentice silversmith in Boston in 1773.  Johnny's whole purpose in life is to try to become the best silversmith possible.  Johnny is quite diligent in becoming a good silversmith.  Barely perceptible to Johnny, at first, there are activities around Johnny that are leading to a confrontation between the colonies in America and English soldiers.  The confrontation will spark a battle that will eventually lead to the founding of the United States of America.

Johnny Tremain believes he can do more, if only his master Ephraim Lapham (character actor Will Wright, who appeared in nearly 200 films and television shows) would trust him.  While trying to prove his ability, Johnny accidentally burns his hand.  The skin on his fingers grows together and Johnny is no longer able to be an apprentice to Ephraim Lapham.

Johnny goes to a wealthy man, Jonathan Lyte, for assistance.  Johnny's mother told him that Mr. Lyte (Sebastian Cabot, ""Family Affair,"" ""Winnie the Pooh"" and dozens of other movie and television appearances) was a relative.  Of course Mr. Lyte considers Johnny a scam artist trying to blackmail him for money, and Mr. Lyte accuses Johnny of being a thief.  Famed attorney Josiah Quincy (Whit Bissell, famous character actor who appeared in more than 275 movies and television episodes) represents Johnny Tremain free of charge, and Johnny's life changes forever.

While Johnny is going through his travails, historic events are in progress around him.  Initially Johnny refuses to participate in these events because he believes that if he does his job and becomes a good silversmith then his life will be fine.  Johnny believes the people working against the Crown are foolish.  However, Johnny's tragic accident gives Johnny a new perspective.

Johnny finds work in a print shop that produces The Boston Observer, where Johnny gets a front seat to the events leading up to the American Revolution.  As Johnny becomes more enamored of the concept of liberty and has a greater appreciation for the meaning of liberty, he becomes more involved in the cause.  Johnny meets many of the important men leading the cause, including Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, and James Otis.  Eventually Dr. Joseph Warren frees the fingers of Johnny's hand and Johnny is able to participate more directly in the activities of the Sons of Liberty.

A shipment of tea has arrived in Boston with a tax imposed on England, a tax that the colonists did not approve.  After appealing to the governor of the colony, and losing, the colonists show their disapproval by dumping the tea into Boston harbor, the famed ""Boston Tea Party.""  The movie continues onward to the events at Lexington and Concord and concludes shortly thereafter.

This movie is a relatively sanitized version of the events leading to the American Revolution.  The characters are generally larger than life, and many of the grittier details are glossed over.  What remains is the story of a group of people who have the goal of gaining representation for the Colonies.  The movie does portray the Colonists as having pure motives and being paragons of virtue, and most of the English are relatively heartless with only profit as their goal.  Of course these are stereotypes and the truth was much more complex, but the simplicity of the movie reflects on the style of story-telling in the 1950's.

The movie does show people being shot, though in a relatively benign way; i.e., they fall over, though sometimes dramatically.  Because of these scenes, this Disney movie may not be suitable for very young family members, perhaps younger than 6 or 7 years old.  However, everyone else will find this reminder of the roots of American independence to be interesting and enjoyable.

Disney's American Revolution films, such as ""Dr. Syn Alias the Scarecrow,"" ""The Swamp Fox"" tv series, and ""Johnny Tremain"" are not only enjoyable feature films, they give the viewer a history lesson in the bargain.  Young Hal Stalmaster plays Johnny, who is the son of a rich aristocratic woman who dies, leaving her son a sterling silver cup with the engraving LYTE on it.  Johnny Lyte Tremain is secretly the heir to an English noble family of great wealth.  As the story unfolds, he's caught up in the early stages of the coming American Revolution, with the Boston Tea Party and the Ride of Paul Revere to be played out with great performances by all.  This movie was made for tv, however, plays as a theater release.  The dvd transfer has some glitches and the color is not as vibrant as it should be.  I taped this movie from the Disney channel and my vhs tape copy is more clear and the color has more depth.

860884,5,6304400810,"As a child, I would go to Colonial Williamsburg nearly every year on school breaks. I adored anything having to do with colonial history, and fell in love with Johnny Tremain (book first, then movie) instantly. Esther Forbes' classic novel tells the rousing tale of a haughty Boston silversmith's apprentice, Johnny Tremain, who, when maimed in an accident with molten silver, gives up his apprenticeship, hits all new lows as he is turned down for jobs because of his deformed hand, and is accused of theft by one of Boston's elite. He matures from boy to man as he joins up with the Sons of Liberty and participates in the planning of the American Revolution (along with some of colonial Boston's most brilliant minds).

Disney's 1957 film adaptation starring Hal Stalmaster was made for TV but also shown in theaters. The costumes, music, and sets are fairly convincing at portraying colonial Boston. The film, at 81 minutes, cuts out a lot of backstory regarding Johnny's inner process of maturation and changes a crucial plot point near the end (presumably to make the film more child-friendly), but generally remains faithful to the spirit of the original book. The transfer is generally very clean and crisp, amazing for a movie of this age.

Amazingly, we actually saw an old reel copy of Johnny Tremain in my fifth grade class ( this was in the early 1990s), and until now, the only copy I owned was a disintegrating VHS tape that'd I'd recorded from the Disney Channel. The DVD release features wonderful extras: Walt Disney talking about the making of the film, and the introductions that were played with each part (the original film was divided into two episodes), basically shameless marketing for other Disney films and a Liberty Square theme park experiment that never came to fruition, but fascinating nonetheless that these extras were saved and presented with the film. The only disappointment is that the excellent animated short ""Ben and Me,"" about a mouse who shares a home with Benjamin Franklin, wasn't included (it's referenced in the two segments, but has never been released to DVD).

A great little family film for history buffs and a real treat those who grew up on classic 1950's Disney live-action fare (Swamp Fox, Spin and Marty, Davy Crockett).",1134864000,13,2277,4.924479166666667

Along the way he carries himself in a responsible and honorable manner. So too are the British (mostly) depicted as honorable people.

When his master is offered a job that is too difficult for his aged skills, Johnny jumps at the opportunity to prove himself to the important customer, Mr. Lyte. But with the job, a deadline is also given, and to do the work in time, Johnny finds himself, along with his master's wife and daughter, breaking the law by working on a Sunday. While pouring molten silver under panicked conditions, Johnny is pushed into it and his right hand is badly burned.
  Time passes, and Johnny must unwrap his burned fingers and get back to the work he is bound to do, but upon discovering that his fingers have healed and grown together, making his hand somewhat useless, he is cast out into the street to find a new home. But no one will hire a boy with one good hand, when there are plenty to be had with two. Johnny soon finds himself desperate, and goes to the home of rich Mr. Lyte, to share his long kept secret, that he is actually named Jonathan Lyte Tremain. Johnny has never told anyone other than the silversmith's beautiful daughter, Cilla, that he was the unknown nephew of Mr. Lyte, but now he has no choice. But when he speaks to the man, he is accused of trying to con him, and Johnny soon finds himself the defendant in a trial that could send him to the gallows. Luckily, Johnny has befriended some important people in his search for work, such as the Patriots Josiah Quincy and Paul Revere, among others. They work to free Johnny, and with the help of Cilla's testimony, the boy soon finds himself cleared and working as a horse messenger boy for the local band of Patriots. A cause that Johnny once found rather trivial, becomes his new passion, and Johnny soon finds himself taking part in secret meetings, the Boston Tea Party, and some famous battles that kicked off the War for Independence.
  Johnny Tremain is a Disney classic from that very special time period at the studios. The film is inspirational, fun, and fit for all ages.

However, it had a message that my 10-year-old daughter could  understand.  The Revolutionary War was not about tea or soldiers or guns,  but about the principle that a small body of men completely absent from the  people they govern should have such absolute control over the lives of  large numbers of people.  Early in the movie Tremain feels the resistance  to the tea tax is much ado about nothing, then later realizes the larger  picture.  I get much the same reaction today from people as I point out the  unconstitutional laws being passed by our own lawmakers.  As long as people  in general have their microwave ovens and DVD players, they care not how  much the law of the land is mangled by the very people who swore to uphold  and protect it.
