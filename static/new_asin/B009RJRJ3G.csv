8543860,3,B009RJRJ3G,"CREATURE OF DESTRUCTION - an interesting movie, not bad for 70's sci-fi.  The actors were likable. FLYING SAUCER MYSTERY  is not a movie, but a short documentary containing old black & white footage and interviews with eyewitnesses, writers and scientists.  The scientists advanced their theories about UFOs and pros & cons were presented.  It's an interesting walk back in time.  UFO -TARGET EARTH is another 70's movie and a total waste of time.",1444089600,,447,5.068493150684931
