8714539,4,B00WXZWL8E,"Season 19 was excellent in all respects.  One of my friends was a team member as one of the teams in Season 19.  My only complaint, and it's a MINOR complaint is that the video quality could have been a little bit clearer in definition, and hopefully was corrected in the Blu-ray edition for a clearer display.",1518652800,,310,4.421052631578948
