4332345,4,B004DEVSM8,Bill Gaither videos are spiritually nurturing and this a must to my collection.,1416355200,,79,5.153846153846154
4332346,5,B004DEVSM8,"This Majesty DVD was filmed from aboard a cruise ship in Alaska. The scenery is breathtakingly beautiful. The Gaither Vocal Band here consists of Bill, Michael, Wes, Mark, and David. Other singers on this one are Russ Taff, The Isaacs, The Hoppers, Lynda Randle, Buddy Greene, Larnelle Harris, Jeff and Sheri Easter, among others. Gordon Mote on piano. They have a ventriloquist who performs a hysterically funny skit involving Bill Gaither, Mark Lowry, and Lynda Randle. What a blessing the people on this cruise ship experienced. It is fabulous.",1404864000,2,547,5.157303370786517
4332347,5,B004DEVSM8,Another great Southern Gospel DVD that my parents watch daily.  If we need an item we go to Amazon...the best site.,1402272000,,115,4.476190476190476
4332348,1,B004DEVSM8,"We are real fans of Gaither music and Homecoming DVDs, but this was a huge disappointment. It is advertised as the usual great singing on a ship cruise to Alaska with beautiful scenery. Actually the singing on an open deck with grey skys and a stationary ship is far inferior to those indoors with better camera work, sound, lighting, etc. Of course, the enthusiasm of the singers and the inspiration of the songs is present, but it just was a disappointment - the first we have ever had from Gaither.",1400198400,,501,4.5777777777777775
4332349,5,B004DEVSM8,I just love all ive received from Bill and Gloria Gaither!  I hope you will continue to get more of their DVD!,1377907200,,110,4.0
4332350,5,B004DEVSM8,"I have taken time to listen to all the tracks in this album and the other two I purchased (I do Believe and Majesty). I observed that Gaither Vocal Band is more than a musical band but a ministry that is geared towards delivering gospel messages with the contents of her songs. The songs relax  my soul and sometimes put me to sleep. The contents portray deep spiritual knowledge about the gospel of Christ. If there was anything more than 5 star that is the rating I would prefer to give.
May God continue to bless this wonderful Gaither Vocal Band.",1365811200,,550,4.445544554455446
4332351,5,B004DEVSM8,This is another one of those DVDs that I have lent to the elderly (like me).  We find a lot of inspiration from listening and watching DVDs like this.  The qualiy is excellent and I couldn't have asked for a quicker delivery.,1361664000,,225,4.333333333333333

4332354,5,B004DEVSM8,This is a classic Gaither gospel collection with a fantastic view of Alaska! I highly recommend it for personal worship music for for a church and Bible study session.,1356048000,,167,4.793103448275862
4332355,5,B004DEVSM8,"I bought this DVD for my mom as a special comfort gift.  (My dad passed away recently.)  As always, the Gaither's music goes straight to the heart and lifts you up.  She loved it and found great comfort in the wonderful hymns.  The scenery, the music, the jokes, all make for a lovely family DVD. One you can watch and enjoy over and over again.",1341792000,,345,4.2615384615384615
4332356,5,B004DEVSM8,"My family are great fans of the Gaither's.  It is hard to find a video that my folks don't already own, but I found this one.  It is wonderful, and it is such a blessing each time we watch it.",1325808000,,192,3.775

4332360,5,B004DEVSM8,"Don't really know where to start this review.  The title MAJESTY just about says it all - the scenery, the music, the sense of fellowshio, the testimonies - all of it is evident on this disc.  Wonderful music, talented voices, with the ""Sunday School Medley"" adding a bit of fun.  For the past 40 years, I have been privileged to be able to rejoice listening to the music of Bill and Gloria Gaither.

""Amen"", featuring Larnelle Harris, is wonderful.  ""Twelve Gates to the City"", featuring Buddy Greene, is a real toe-tapper.  Those two songs represent a bridge between reverence and ultimate joy!

During my life I have been able to visit 36 of our states, but never Alaska.  The glimpses shown on this DVD certainly attest to the Majesty of our Creator.  Thank you, Bill Gaither, for allowing viewers to come along on this cruise.",1315699200,4,831,4.675862068965517
4332361,5,B004DEVSM8,"My wife and I were looking forward to view this DVD and were certainly not disappointed.
We recommend this DVD.",1312329600,,111,4.6
4332362,5,B004DEVSM8,"Received my Majesty and Alaskan Homecoming DVD's today.  I have watched both of them and I have to say that I like Majesty better.  The flow of music and scenery is grand.  I love that there are some of the singers I don't normally see singing solos from the Gaither Homecoming Family.  David Pendleton is absolutely hilarious, Wes Hampton and Stephen Hill are awesome together.  Bill continues to amaze me at his ability to put together great dvds and I am so glad I am able to purchase them since I cant afford the cruises.  Keep them coming Bill.",1301529600,12,549,4.494949494949495
4332363,5,B004DEVSM8,"The picture, mostly from the deck of the ship, is awsome. As the towns and scenery pass by the gaither homecoming family is performing beautiful and meaningful music.
