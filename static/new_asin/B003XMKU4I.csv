4217396,3,B003XMKU4I,this is not a bad documentary...it is 12 hours long...and well worth $7.00. The narration and way it is all put together is very bland..but if interested in seeing footage and hearing information..you will get it in this documentary. It is something you would expect to see other people sleeping with their heads down on their desks in history class...but for interested students..it is still informative and interesting.,1326067200,23,421,5.205882352941177
4217397,5,B003XMKU4I,"I bought this for my husband and he enjoyed it.  It is quite long and very informative.  I have not watched it in its entirety yet, but I am not really a history buff.",1324166400,3,167,3.8823529411764706
4217398,4,B003XMKU4I,"Excellent, puts the reality of how a corrupt government can sway the people with lies, lies, and more lies, along with promises and government handouts. There are many 'home movies' taken by German citizens during Hitler's rise and fall. The warning 'history repeats itself' makes one shutter. This is a must for any history buff, and a great DVD for all those that enjoy freedom!",1311897600,3,380,4.861538461538461
4217399,4,B003XMKU4I,"Very good documentary - 12 hours of detailed information about Hitler. As a history teacher - it bothers me to see our American textbooks saying that America's refusal to join the league of Nations after WWI caused WWII - that is nothing but politically correct - revisionist history. This documentary points out how Germany, under Hitler, wanted to right the wrongs of 1918 - yes - it was the allies in Europe who cased WWII - because of their unjust treatment of Germany after WWI. An excellent buy for the true WWII enthusiast.

4217400,4,B003XMKU4I,"This documentary on Hitlers rise to power and the World War is very interesting and shows film footage that is very rare, some of it very graphic. To me this is one of the best films on Hitlers rise.",1308096000,4,199,4.128205128205129
4217401,1,B003XMKU4I,"I think it is a good guess that most of the money spent making this documentary (or rather series of three documentaries) was spent on the cover graphics, which I must confess caught my eye. This is a great example of deceptive packaging. And let me explain why.

First this is not a 12 hour series on Hitler as advertised.

Secondly there is no documentary in this package actually called Hitler: The Untold Story. The name of the six hour slog contained herein is Hitler: Myths, Anecdotes and Lies... which is a misnomer as well. (It is not listed in IMDb.)

There is also a three hour documentary misleadingly labeled ""The World at War: From Hitler to Hiroshima"", which again once you actually watch the DVD is called ""From Hitler to Hiroshima: The World at War"". This has nothing to do with the excellent Thames Television series from the 1970's entitled the ""World at War"" and is just labeled such to confuse the viewer. It is in fact one more tedious run through of the same material.

Next there is also a three hour documentary on the U-Boats. This might be worth the couple of dollars shelled out for this thing. (Warning if you pay more than five dollars for this package you're going to have a tough time getting your money's worth.)

Finally as to the Hitler documentary, which indeed is nearly six hours long... (And feels every minute of it.) If you've seen a couple of documentaries on Hitler you've seen it all before, except for perhaps 2%. I think approximately 70% of Triumph of the Will was cannibalized from a very poor quality print. And the rest is from predominantly obvious sources. Now I would be willing to forgive even that somewhat if they had any new slant on the subject. Some poor English historian is roped in with less than 6 minutes of talking head time amongst the 6 hours. Supposedly he narrates this whole shebang. But he doesn't. ( I wish he had.) Instead we get a very stilted individual talking with a strange American accent who can't pronounce certain words quite correctly. This could be the ""director"" Jose Delgado who is the ""write and director"" (sic).

By the way this is from Mill Creek and Octapixx???

Here's what this mess really looks like to me: With it's horrifying digital transition effects, it's constant and pointless musical score, it's untranslated Hitler speeches droning on through the background as random sound, it's fuzzy images; it all seems to have been crammed together on someone's old PC in about 1997 from preexisting source material (VHS?), without too much regard to content meshing with image. Yes I did glean a couple of shards I hadn't known about. But that's really no excuse. (Maybe I should do one of these.)

This wasn't the untold story. This was truly Hitler: the completely needlessly rehashed story.",1300147200,188,2783,4.723711340206186

to watch this documentary and decide for yourself. Certain things are
facts, like Hitler trying to get peace with Britain and America

4217501,1,B003XMKU4I,"THIS IS NOT ABOUT HOW MUCH THE ITEM COST OR NOT , THIS PROGRAM IS A TOTALY  Distortion of reality !
They took photographs and recorded material and edited it as they like contrary to all true reality !
if any of you want to deceive yourselves with that .. ! ?  its your problem.
They build and rewrite history on the photos and video they made here.
BUT THEY DID ENCLOSED A NICE DRAMATIC MUSIC SO YOU WILL BE ANIMATED FULL OF FEELINGS WHEN WATCHING THIS PROGRAM

this is a propaganda  joke program which made in order to confuse and re-educate millions of people from the new generation which don't know or learned the real facts and truth about the WWII HISTORY EVENTS !
in this propaganda program  - they paint everything and put hitler  and his worst henchmen killers - as almost innocent which suffer so much from the Russian and other .
they show you the suffer of the women's of Berlin after the war , but they don't give any explanation why the Russians did all that.
In fact - if we compare what the Germans did to the Russians and other population in the eastern front, Balkans, Latvia, Bella Russia, Ukraine, Yugoslavia, Croatia, Holland, France, Poland, Concentration and Deth camps  - what ever happened to the Germans after the war is nothing in compare of the HOROR which the Germans did !!!

they paint Leon Dagruill as a hero - will he was ambition  Collaborator !

they paint Mgda Goubels as a mother how care for her children - will she was Crazy schizophrenic, and she brutally kill'd her children.

they paint hitler and the nazi party as they were Open to freedom of religion so they accepted the muslims and Croatian and many
other to the SS DEVISIONS , but in fact - they did not like them at all and they desperately needed them to control the concord occupied zone in order to kill millions of people and govern the occupied countries ! so they used them.

they paint General Paulos as a traitor - But the truth is that he run out of any supply and could not fight any longer so he surrender !

they show you in this program that the Alias send many German soldiers back to Russia after the war and that most of them died - well the Germans during the war took from all Europe millions of civil populations and send them to hard death labor in Germany in them Factories, death camps, concentration camps, and there is no indication of that.

to my opinion - what ever the German suffer during or after the war ended - it cannot be compared to the sufferings that the Germans
did to all Europe during the war , and specially in the eastern front !
they paid, it came back to them, and to my opinion - they paid too little for all the atrocities they dune !  too little !

Hitler ordered everybody to suicide , he wanted to sacrifice all Germany, and he himself as far as many believe today, he and Eva Escape to Indonesia , to Sumbawa Island and hide under the name of: Dr Poch , and died there on 1970.
Hitler - What a great COWARD he was !

4217503,3,B003XMKU4I,There's a lot of footage that I have never seen before.

4217504,3,B003XMKU4I,"There is nothing in this entire DVD set that I have not seen elsewhere, so that knocks it down one star right there. The title of the DVD is flat-out untrue. In fact, I know many things about Hitler that this DVD missed.

The other star was lost because it is a very cheaply produced DVD. Some examples: the narrator over-pronounces his words, which gets tedious. It seems he's incapable of using any contractions, and it sounds like an android is telling the story. Also, he stubbornly mis-pronounces some words repeatedly, such as saying ROOS-evelt rather than the more commonly used ROSE-evelt. He incorrectly pronounces it exactly as it's spelled. A minor point, but an example of how annoying the narration is at times. The graphics are cheesy, as is the music. Ah, the music! Wildly inappropriate at times, such as romantic symphonic music or peppy jazz music while showing intense, violent combat footage. And, the sound effects were lacking at times too. While showing British ships launching anti-submarine hedgehogs, they used the sound from the Soviet Katyusha rockets, or ""Stalin's Organ."" And in another scene with combat troops going at it, I swear I heard a Wilhelm Scream in there. You can look it up on youtube if you don't know what that is.

This is a DVD that has definitely earned its place in the $5 bargain bin. If you can get it for $5 or less, you might as well, it's not completely awful. But there are much better WWII DVDs out there. I'm still waiting for the DVD release of ""Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,"" if that ever comes out on DVD.",1370736000,18,1569,4.640287769784172

You can call it a rehash just as you can call any newer film or book on events a rehash....but it was a good rehash that I am happy to have. There are always a lot of forgotten facts and details and I was reminded of many of those. It was not hard to imagine being in that period and that crazy mentality of the turmoil that the world was in and how the world handled it. The second world war was a very big and complicated event and I am glad to have seen it all again. There is no ""one book"", ""one dvd"", etc that is complete enough on such an event as to make another book or another dvd unimportant....Dont trust the negative reviews that tell us that more complete information is not necessary or important. I don't think that people can view this program and not get an overall understanding or enhanced view of this subject. This is a good program....dont listen to those who claim to be negative experts. I have owned it for some time and treated it as just a reminder of that period, so I wasn't in a hurry to see it...but once I started watching it, I found it very interesting.",1370563200,5,1295,4.246963562753036

4217509,4,B003XMKU4I,"The review that is ranked as most helpful on this product is entirely correct:  this is not professional level quality like some sets distributed by the History Channel.  Not everyone would find it engaging because of the presentation and narration.  However, concerning content/material, it is quite interesting because of the statistical and espionage information and some interesting stories, and is well-written.  The title ""Hitler:  The Untold Story"" and other title ""Hitler:  Anecdotes, Myths, and Lies"" are not at all what the documentaries are about.  The first documentary, which is very long, is a history of the European war, not of Hitler's life.  The second documentary covers the significant campaigns of the war and includes the Pacific.  The third documentary is about U-boats.  I have enjoyed learning a great deal more about World War II through the documentary set.  Whether this would appeal to someone else depends on how much one is interested in the subject matter and whether one has an encyclopedic knowledge of WWII already.  I don't think I understood the magnitude of the number of people involved in every single campaign until I went through the 2nd documentary.  It provided me a better understanding (a ""big picture"" sense) of the war even though I already knew the essential facts about it.  The 3rd documentary on U-boats was most interesting to me of all.

4217534,5,B003XMKU4I,"Lots of footage, but the narration is even better.  The quality is very good and plays well in both player and computer.",1355529600,,120,4.454545454545454
4217535,3,B003XMKU4I,"As other reviewers have noted, a lot of the info here is not new. If you have seen little previously on Hitler, you will enjoy it, however those that have studied Hitler and the war will find much of it tiresome.
My main criticism was with the first disc, which included much footage clearly intended to be archival footage but could not possibly be(eg the 'actual' explosion on 20/7/44 which nearly killed Hitler). A lot of the footage, while genuinely archival has been used out of place, such as vision at the Berghof, which it is implied was shot much later in the war than it was. Also, the segment on the holocaust was way to short considering the enormity of those events(acknowledged even in the segment titles as lasting 11 years).
A pet hate of mine was the constant mispronunciation of certain names such as Goering(Gooring), Goebels(Gobels), and in the U-Boat shows, Doenitz(made to sound like a policeman's favourite treat(Donutz).
Some of the shows were out of place, especially the Pacific campaign epiosodes, as it had nothing to do with Hitler, and was overly long. While the sacrifices of those involved in the fighting can never be understated, it seemed there was a segment on the battle for every single island in the Pacific.",1354924800,12,1247,4.804651162790698
4217536,3,B003XMKU4I,"The first disk was very interesting and contained minor propaganda.  It contained a lot of what appeared to be original footage.  The second disk is packed with propaganda, but had some interesting information and original footage.  I could only watch the second disk for about an hour the BS got so deep.",1354406400,,305,4.826923076923077
4217537,4,B003XMKU4I,"I was surprised at how good this DVD is. Three discs, several hours of interesting and informative history of Hitler and the Third Reich. Really enjoyed it and definitely recommend the DVD",1352505600,,188,4.90625
4217538,4,B003XMKU4I,"I DO LIKE HISTORY AND ALTHOUGH THIS IS JUST RECENT HISTORY (1935-1945), IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING OF MY LIFETIME.  I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CURIOUS ABOUT HITLER AND WHAT MADE HIM TICK.  I DO NOT THINK I KNOW HIM ANY BETTER, BUT I STILL HAVE A PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING HOW THIS MAN COULD GET AWAY WITH THE THINGS HE DID; BY A COUNTRY WHO WERE JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE.  THE GENERALS UNDER HIM HAD A LOT TO ANSWER FOR ALSO AND MOST ALL OF THEM DID PRISON TIME BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THEY SHOULD HAVE.  THIS MAN HAS BASICALLY GOTTEN AWAY WITH MURDER OF OVER 6 MILLION JEWS, NOT TO MENTION THE MILLIONS OF GERMAN SOLDIERS, AND THE ENEMY SOLDIERS.  HE WAS TOO MUCH OF A COWARD TO FACE HIS ACCUSERS OR THE WRATH OF THE JEWISH NATION, OR EVEN THE GERMAN PEOPLE.  THE MAKERS OF THIS DVD DESERVES A LOT OF CREDIT FOR THEY HANDLED A DIFFICULT SUBJECT WITH DIGNITY AND GRACE.  I HAVE BEEN INDEPENDANTLY STUDYING THE CIVIL WAR AND WWII, MAINLY THRU TAPES AND DVDs, AND A FEW BOOKS.  THIS IS ONE DVD THAT I WILL LOOK AT AGAIN AND AGAIN....YOU ALWAYS LEARN SOMETHING NEW WITH EACH VIEWING.",1348099200,3,1058,4.2288557213930345
4217539,5,B003XMKU4I,"This collection of 4 DVD's is the finest collection available anywhere. I have collected and viewed many, many DVD's and books written on Hitler, however, this is by far, the finest and most well researched compilation on this most troubled & disturbed man, which brings one to further question the many schools of thought and scholars, on this subject, as to so many of the older & well known theories, seem to no longer hold water, so to speak. ""Hitler"", the untold story, is just that and as you will see, truly and literally, the ""untold story,"" but not for long, as you view these 4 discs, the story unfolds as do the many new and interesting theories, brought out by this team of very talented, well schooled researchers, historians and filmmakers. The film is very very good and mostly b&w, yet there are segments of color, which I could not care less about. I am of the mindset that all film should be filmed in black & white, since the grain and shadows and lighting are so far superior to any color film. However, if you want to delve into the next step of history, on Hitler, the Third Reich & many of his henchmen, this is the singular and only logical collection on this subject, today.",1340236800,4,1199,4.504587155963303

8408318,3,B003XMKU4I,"This is a decent general overview of the war itself. It is not a slick production, and at times just seems to be a random selection of footage that doesn't always coincide with the narration, and sometimes suddenly jumps from one subject to another without first providing some background. Added sound effects sometimes are odd, such as songbirds chirping while soldiers crawl across high altitude rocky terrain. In a way it reminds me of some of the simple films that I watched in high school history in the late 1970s. The name and description implies this dvd is about Hitler. If that is what you are looking for, this is not the dvd to get. Of course, you can't discuss the European theatre without mentioning Hitler. This however is not the untold story of Hitler, but rather a general overview of the war, and some of the major campaigns.",1516838400,2,844,4.671140939597316
8408319,1,B003XMKU4I,"All we ever get in school is the officially sanctioned view of history. This long documentary follows suit. The truth is always fascinating. So the fact that this is boring in spite of the subject being a fascinating one, speaks volumes. There is a certain free you tube site that has a free documentary, ""Adolph Hitler, the Greatest Story Never Told"". I highly recommend that instead of this.",1511740800,,393,4.794117647058823

8408321,3,B003XMKU4I,"I wasn't expecting much for the price, but this isn't a real documentary. More like a lot of facts and old footage thrown together with a simple narration. Lots of dates. Feels like someone took all the info from the internet and put it together on four discs. I'm not extremely disappointed, but will definitely look for a better documentary to purchase next time.",1483056000,2,365,4.71875
