8603267,4,6305052077,"The overall recording quality of these videos is poor.  Our new vcr was unable to determine what speed to play these tapes.  They are recorded on slow play and kept skipping.  When we played them on our older vcr in which  we could manually adjust speed play they played fine; However, they were  very grainy.  If you are a true fan of Lucy you will enjoy the four  episodes and get a good laugh.  My eleven year old daughter loves the old  Lucy shows.  The price of these reflects the quality I suppose!",945993600,9,504,4.32258064516129
