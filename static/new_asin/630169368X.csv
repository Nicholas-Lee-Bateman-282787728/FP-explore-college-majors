7814280,5,630169368X,"This isn't just classic Morrison, it's quintessential Morrison. On stage with Georgie Fame, John Lee Hooker and Mose Allison, plus one of his best bands ever, although all of his bands are excellent. He was in his show band/revue phase, dressing like a gangster in dark suit and hat
but clearly a man in as much control of his life as possible for the spotlighted, enjoying the act of performing and interacting with his audience. Sadly, the vhs tape of the concert is an abbreviation of the full show; I believe the full concert is available as a 2-cd (bootleg?). If you like the filmed concert, you'll want to get the whole thing, even audio only.",1515369600,,649,4.603448275862069
7814281,4,630169368X,"It most certainly lived up to expectations, with bells on, but the cherry on the top would have been if I had seen a  DVD or BRD copy of the event, the old VHS tape ""picture"" and audio wise, had seen better days! It was like watching one of those twenties films;bathed in bromide!",1457740800,2,280,4.185185185185185

Who effin CARES that he had a cold? Not quite up to par for a Van show, but still head and shoulders above the typical musical release. And this setlist cover a great deal of what isn't covered elsewhere from a very interested period from The Man.",1389052800,5,411,4.421052631578948
7814285,5,630169368X,"It's hard to believe this concert was taped in 1989, at the Beacon Theater in New York, long time ago!  Van has never been known to age gracefully, but the voice, the high and low ranges, the sounds and mumbles he makes still mesmerize his audiences.  Many of the performances here feature his spiritual side with  Whenever God Shines His Light; Thank God for Self; I Will Be There; and When Will I Ever Learn to Live in God.  He touches lightly on Gloria, and extends Moondance/Fever.

Two influential guests include the  blues guitarist John Lee Hooker and jazz pianist, composer, and Mose Allison.  Allison has often called the ""William Faulkner of Jazz.""  In 1996, Morrison recorded&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tell-Me-Something-The-Songs-of-Mose-Allison/dp/B000004754/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tell Me Something: The Songs of Mose Allison</a>.

What is not listed as a track is the mesmerizing and unusual duet between sax player and Morrison, doing Common One.  The sax play will echo every line Morrison does.  Not only is it unique to listen, but that duet is very fun to  watch.

As usual the bluesy jazzy sound of the entire concert is a thrill.

Other songs include:  Raglan Road; Star of the county Down;  In the Garden;  Have I Told You Lately;  Cleaning Windown;  Orangefield;  Summertime in England;  It Serves Me Right To Suffer;  Booom Boom and She Moved Through the Fair.

I don't believe this concert is in DVD format.  I don't know why, but sit back and enjoy some rare treats by Morrison in stereo sound.  ....Rizzo",1250640000,6,2123,6.413427561837456
