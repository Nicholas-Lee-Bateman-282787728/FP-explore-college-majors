208848,3,6300142256,"I enjoy most all programs about the air war in Europe, China and the Pacific.  This DVD was interesting and I spent an enjoyable
hour or so watching it.  I think every youngster should have to watch programs like this so they will know how things were back in those days.",1330905600,,271,4.294117647058823
208849,5,6300142256,"The Battle of Britain is all I've seen so far, but what a powerful and moving piece of film-making! With direction credited to Frank Capra, it's small wonder that he hits the nail right on the head. These blurred glimpses of how Britain stood up to save civilization, by blunting and rebuffing the arrogant German war machine, brought the memories flooding back. This was no ""last stand"": it was the first and most crucial stand! Had Britain fallen, the dubious and dithering USA, which contained numerous pro-German sympathizers and was dragging its heels, might well have caved in to Hitler's ambitions, and we'd be looking at a very different world today. British steadiness and resolution, calm resilience, courage and resourcefulness, which used to be the measure of how mankind should conduct itself, has now been almost forgotten; incompetent hysteria and panic-stricken spin-doctoring has taken its place. But some of us still remember.

July 31. Now that I've watched the complementary disc, Divide and Conquer, I have to add another 5 stars. Ten stars in all, therefore. These discs may be a form of propaganda, but they don't talk down to their audience, like the garbage put out today. These accounts are far closer to way things really were, and the analysis of what was really happening, and the roles played by the participants is infinitely more accurate than the cruddy glorification of events after the American entry into WW2. These discs should be compulsary viewing in schools, if any truth about the years 1939-1945 is to be retained in folk memory. Wonderfully put together: real, documentary footage, crystalline analysis. Capra certainly knew what he was doing.",1184025600,19,1686,5.108695652173913
208850,4,6300142256,"Like all the ""Battlefield"" series, this video gives the historical background to the battle with discussion of the early defeat of Poland and the successful German operation in France.  The prelude to the battle is especially good in showing what the intentions and options were for the Germans at this point of the war.  Churchill's refusal to negotiate a peace tied Hitler's hands and forced him to try to attack Britain without the military means of acheiving a success.  Clearly, the one thing Germany had going for it was it's Luftwaffe.  However, the Luftwaffe had been designed as a strike force meant for supporting troops, not strategically bombing a people into submission.  With many aircraft suffering from a limited range, the numerical superiority of the Luftwaffe would in the end be inadequate to the task.

This video discusses the weapons, tactics and ultimate intent of the Wehrmacht.  The failure of the Luftwaffe to destroy Britain's radar facilities and fighter forces as well as the their losses in aircraft and experienced fighters had a lasting impact on the war.  The exposure of the weaknesses of the stuka dive bombers was also a bad portent of things to come for the Luftwaffe on the western front.",1117411200,5,1227,4.980392156862745
208851,5,6300142256,"""The Battle of Britain"" was the fourth part of Frank Capra's celebrated ""Why We Fight"" series. Made during World War II when Capra was a major in the U.S. Army Signal Corps, these documentaries are the supreme example of American propaganda during World War II (the term ""propaganda"" being used in the neutral sense that existed at the time, not the pejorative it received because of Josef Goebbels Ministry of Propaganda in Nazi Germany).
Originally the films were used to explain the government's policy to the troops that were hastily assembled after Pearl Harbor to be trained and sent overseas to fight. You have to remember that American had been an isolationist nation in the period between the two world wars and what Capra does that is so masterful is convince viewers that Americans were leaning towards supporting the English and entering the war before the Japanese attack made the matter moot. Eventually the ""Why We Fight"" series was shown to the public in theaters and today they remain a prime source of archival footage for the period.
""The Battle of Britain"" was released in 1943 and is one of the transitional volume in the series with regards to the war in Europe as the British make a desperate last stand against the Nazi Luftwaffe. This 54-minute black & white documentary is narrated by Walter Huston and starts with Hitler entering Paris and then looking across the English Channel at his next victim. Inspired by the speeches of Winston Churchill, the presence of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, and the fighter pilots of the Royal Air Force, the British simply refused to quit in the face of an onslaught of air attacks of the Blitz.
Writer Anthony Veiller (""Stage Door,"" ""The Killers"") worked as an uncredited director on ""The Battle of Britain"" along with Capra. ""The Battle of Britain"" is followed by ""The Battle of Russia,"" which Hitler betrays his Soviet allies and forces his army to fight a two front war. In 2000 the ""Why We Fight"" series was added to the Library of Congress National Film Registry.",1084838400,2,2038,4.825714285714286

208890,4,6300142256,"This black and white film uses material shot at the time, both by official sources and by Capra's team. The task that Capra had was to show the American soldier why he was fighting the Germans. The overall title of all the films that comprise ""Why We Fight"" didn't appear to be propaganda in the strictest sense but in a way they can be viewed that way with hindsight. Capra used interviews to get a personal feeling for what was happening in Britain at the time of the Nazi aerial bombardment. It's an interesting look at how film can be used to influence a nation as to the reason for war.",1430697600,,591,4.333333333333333

208918,4,6300142256,"Propaganda films are in a class unto themselves. If one forgets the purpose of these films then they seem to be of a lesser value. Churchill was the newly elected Prime Minister of Great Britain and it was his intent to gain US support. Roosevelt was reelected with a platform of nonintervention. Without the support from the people of the US, Great Britain had little chance of survival. This needs to be considered as an integral part of the review. The original footage is well selected 'bits and pieces'(from another review) and the narration is informative and reasonably accurate. Consider how you would have viewed this information at the time it was presented. Would it have evoked sympathy? If the answer is yes, then the film would have served it's purpose. From this perspective, the film accomplishes it's purpose.

7803071,2,6300142256,"Quite uninformative except perhaps as an illustration of  WW2 propaganda intended to show the US public that Britain was great ally deserving of full support..  It was amusing that the British were supposed to be using listening devices, waiting for the sound of aircraft engines, to warn of an incoming bomber force.  I suppose they wanted to try to hide the power of radar.  The Germans initially underestimated its value but they also had effective radar in 1943.  Surprisingly, they did show the innovative and very effective organization of RAF fighter response, a major factor in overcoming it's numerical disadvantage in 1940.  (Fighters were up and waiting for the German bombers).  This organization has been widely copied.",1477008000,,732,5.205128205128205

This is your typical rah-rah propaganda from the 1940's and not the original version of the colour film which came out years later!",1469923200,,299,4.2631578947368425
7803074,4,6300142256,"Very good if you have not previously seen the historic footage of RAF ""scrambles"" or the ""Blitz"" on London.  As was typical until recent years, too much credit was given in the narration to the Spitfires during the Battle of Britain and too little to the workhorse Hurricanes. (It was later, 1943-44, after the Luftwaffe deployed the Focke-Wulf 190 (""Butcher Bird"") that the Spitfires came into their own.)

Aside from this minor technical quibble, it does no harm to be reminded now and again how much the civilized world owes to the British people, who sacrificed so much to help save Liberty from the Nazis.",1469318400,2,610,4.8
7803075,3,6300142256,"The only real value in this lies in some historic B&W film of actual events in 1940, and an example of highly censored reporting during the conflict. For example, there's no mention of the use of radar, which was vital for British defence, but still secret at that time. Rather stilted acting, typical of the time.
