8205139,3,6302179629,"Jessye Norman was in excellent voice, but she seldom used it, except for a few selections.  She is quite the diva, with numerous walk-offs. I would say that most of this concert is pedestrian and dull, with little vocal color.  She does come alive with the spirituals, which are given with great force, spirit, and enthusiasm.  I wish that more of her program had been executed with this drive.",1366416000,,394,4.681159420289855
