8093308,2,B000BVNS9S,Got this because I saw the trailer for Black Rebels on a trailer compilation and the back story on the making of the film.  It's ok for the time it came out.  Not really though...lol,1420416000,,182,4.171428571428572

8093310,5,B000BVNS9S,"Joseph P. Mawra's stylish direction is once again very impressive in ""Murder in Mississipi"" (1965). His highly stylish camera work, is something i've never seen in a low budget exploitation film. After the famous olgas girls series, Mawra created a real film. A serious, profound and dramating film dealing with racism and corruption. The performances are great from most of the actors and the film is dramatic, dark and scary. The transfer could be a lot better. Mawra's films like this one, and ""Shanty Tramp"" (1967) need restoration to be appreciated by a wider audience! Murder In Mississipi is a redneck blaxploitation classic! Joseph P. Mawra is the most talented director i've seen, way better than the boring Joe Sarno or even Lee Frost!!",1383523200,,746,5.024193548387097

I'm not going to go into plot details because others can (and probably have) done that so I'm just giving the basic, ""I loved this DVD""! and leave it at that...BLACK REBELS was def my fav of the two films and Rita Moreno and Dyan Cannon never looked better!",1316217600,4,309,4.535714285714286
