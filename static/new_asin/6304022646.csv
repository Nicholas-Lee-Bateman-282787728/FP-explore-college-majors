This is also the last movie that stars Joel Hodgson introduces us to Mike Nelson. The movie itself is so bad that it's good with so many cringeworthy scenes starring Joe Don Baker, you'd think you're watching a horror movie. The movie is complete with a bad 70's porn music soundtrack and many stars from the era: Martin Balsam, Linda Evans, John Saxon, and the gentle giant, Merlin Olsen. Interestingly enough, the ""regular"" version gets a rating of ONE star on IMDb. I give it a 5 star rating with the mistie treatment.

The audio is horrible and the plot line leaves a little something to be desired, oh for instance let's say how John Saxon fits in any way into this movie and who is the kid that Mitchell gets into a shouting match with.  What about Mitchell's ""lady friend"" that just can't seem to stay out of trouble.  But with the guys by your side it does get a little better.

With the exception of Gypsy (extremely annoying), the cast has some good one liners: ""Mr Treveno has been hit again"" ; ""he just landed just short of the green""; ""fresh panties all around""; and  Tom Servo's obsession with Joe Don Baker's eating/farting.

761253,4,6304022646,"MST3K: Mitchell was the last Comedy Central era episode to feature Joel Robinson(Joel Hodgson). Although, he did make a guest appearance in a Sci-Fi Channel episode where Mike and the Robots were forced to watch Soultaker(1990). Joel and the Robots poked fun of the violent, gritty, action packed film Mitchell(1975) starring Joe Don Baker(Walking Tall, Goldeneye).
Joe Don Baker saw the MSTied version of Mitchell and didn't laugh! He's threatened to beat up people at Best Brains Inc.
Mitchell(1975) is packed with detective and action movie cliches. Joe Don Baker plays a police officer who must bring a crooked lawyer to justice. He must also spy on a crooked businessman(Martin Balsam) and deal with a call girl(Linda Evans). Hoyt Axton performed the film's theme song. Mike and the Robots watched Final Justice(1984) years later and made more insults toward Joe Don Baker! Final Justice was also a violent film filled with action movie cliches! The only extras on the Rhino DVD are a chapter menu and a 1975 movie trailer for Mitchell. Fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 consider Mitchell a ""classic"". Keep in mind that the MST3K version of Mitchell is shorter and it censors the R-rated scenes.",1307059200,2,1203,5.050251256281407

Now I understand why this episode is so revered, not a moment is wasted tearing this film to comic shreds and with so much energy it really adds to the enjoyment level. The best moment has to be when Mitchell gets into a shouting match with a 10 year old that is so ridiculous it didn't even need the S.O.L. Crew's commentary to get a laugh.

A truly enjoyable episode, but the most joy came from seeing Joel get rocketed off into space and the promise of Mike taking over as host.",1235347200,,627,4.305084745762712

This has become legendary in my circle of friends. Just calling out the name Mitchell causes a round of laughter and makes us pull out this movie for another viewing. I have owned the VHS copy of this episode for years and have watched it over and over again. So now that I am finally updating to DVD this is the first one I bought along with The Essentials (Manos, the Hands of Fate / Santa Claus Conquers the Martians)  Yes fans vary on weather Joel episodes are better then Mike episodes and some where sad or stopped watching when Joel left (not me).

One day, while they were airing Mitchell, I turned off the movie playing, turned on MST and made all the customers watch Sigi get out of his coroners car!!! Its only for a second, but it's him and he's briefly leaning over the corpse a few minutes later. Sigi passed away a few years ago, he was in his mid- nineties! Oh yeah...almost forgot to say..MITCHELL IS ONE OF THE GREATEST MST3K SHOWS IN ITS HISTORY!!!!",1218240000,,530,4.363636363636363
761258,5,6304022646,"I'm probably not going to say anything that most fans of MST3K haven't already said, but I'll try. ""Mitchell,"" for me, is the best razzing Joel and the 'Bots have ever done of a film. NOT the best film, mind you. :) Oh boy, do they lay waste to Joe Don Baker: his weight, his drinking, his stupidity---I mean in the movie, Joe Don---don't hurt me!; his bad acting. But the whole movie is enough of a stinker to provide plenty of fodder for the boys. This is the pivotal episode where Joel (after the movie) leaves the Satellite of Love for Earth, only to have Mike Nelson replace him (not shown here---just a ""Push the button, Frank"" from Dr. Forrester.

But the jokes are what make the show and they fly fast and furious:
""Hey, it's the chase scene's pace car!""
""Keep you eye on the sammich!""
""That cat Mitchell's a bad...(shut yo mouth!)...talkin' 'bout Mitchell!""
""He looks like one of the kids from Fame."" ""Which one?"" ""Any of 'em!""
""Hey, wasn't John Saxon in this movie?"" (his last scenes cut out due to time constraints)

The visual gags are gangbusters also, like Mitchell's hidden gun sliding down the front of his pants, leading Joel to say, ""What THE?!!""
Catching Mitchell with Baby Oil near his bed while carousing with Linda Evans and (Joel & the 'Bots) screaming in horror at the mere thought.

It just goes on & on. This MST3K is a must-own, both historically for Joel's passing of the torch to Mike and for flat-out hilarity that will leave you aching with laughter. Highly recommended.",1217721600,,1501,4.5724907063197024

761315,5,6304022646,"Actually, the full line is, ""Hey, that shower wasn't so bad, and I've been afraid of it all these years...""  It's what Crow says after Mitchell comes out of the bathroom in a robe.  Yes, the title character of this movie takes a lot of riffing at the hands of the Satellite of Love crew, and that's just one of the things that makes this particular episode a must-see.

Joe Don Baker stars as Mitchell, a loveable, beer-drinking cop who sleeps with hookers and does things his own way...yet has a terrible eating disorder.  Mitchell isn't an easy film to get through, but Joel, Tom, and Crow once again make the unbearable bearable via a constant flow of humorous remarks.  Tom says Mitchell ""likes to top off his beer drinking with another beer.  It's like dessert.""  And when Mitchell is getting roughed up by thugs, we hear, ""If they're not careful they'll end up with Mitchell's dinner all over them.""  Not to mention when Mitchell struggles to get up off the couch, some noises are made that aren't exactly flattering.

At least 75% of the comments in this episode are aimed directly at title character, and yet the character is so disgustingly likable that the comments never get old.

No review can do this episode justice.  Just go out and have a laugh at poor old Joe Don Baker's expense.  Hoyt Axton's ""My, My, Mitchell"" song will help you along the way.",1167436800,6,1364,4.590909090909091

I hadn't ever seen this one so I was pleasantly surprised when we sat down to watch it and laughed (hard) throughout the entire thing.  Gems such as ""Hey, the headlight fixed itself"" run through the whole movie.  I promise you won't be disappointed with this one if you are a MST3K fan.",1166400000,4,549,4.102803738317757
761317,5,6304022646,"If you've ever sat around with a group of friends and ripped on a bad movie then Mystery Science Theater 3000 is a show you can relate to. It became a ritual for a friend of mine and I when I was in college to come back late from a party and monopolize the dorm's TV room and watch this show at 2:00 in the morning. One of our favorite episodes was ""Mitchell"", which after viewing so many of the episodes has to be one of the funniest shows of the series. I'm sure a lot of it had to do with the fact that this was series creator Joel Hodgson's last episode; you could tell that they really pulled out all the stops with this one. Just the opening credits got ripped a new one for crying out loud...and they didn't slow down from there. ""Mitchell"" would be fodder for anyone that actually sits down to watch it, but Joel and the boys really destroy it. Whoever thought that Joe Don Baker would actually be a draw as an action star should be working at 7-11 now. He's fat, and Mitchell is an alcoholic, chain smoking (cigarillos no less), unintelligent, and unlikeable individual, all of which gives the occupants of the Satellite of Love ample material to work with. (I love that whenever Joe Don runs for any reason one of them wheezes and breathes heavy.) Even the theme song ""Mitchell"" gets blasted (""Oh Hoyt, how could you?""); I guess Mr. Axton was having a tough time financially to agree to write the theme song for the stinkfest called ""Mitchell"". (I mean, the guy did write ""The Pusher"", ""Snowblind Friend"" and ""Greenback Dollar"" after all, so we know he was capable of writing good music.) And of course, all the references to Mitchell's boozing are particularly funny when you're tipsy yourself. I still use these lines on a regular basis on friends and family, they just seem to come up sometimes. (Most recently when I gave a date a beer bottle and she said ""I'd like a glass"" and I remarked ""Sorry your majesty"". It's sad to actually be like Mitchell in some ways.) This stands as my favorite episode of MST3K, and after all these years it still cracks me up. Even if you aren't a fan of the show this one will make you laugh...it should have a guarantee.",1156291200,2,2168,4.395522388059701

761319,5,6304022646,"This is, perhaps, the greatest of any MST3K episode; and an excellent choice for the transition from Joel to Mike.  The best episode I had seen, until this, was ""The Girl in the Gold Boots,"" which is hilarious as well, but its nothing next to this.  Me, my girlfriend, and my best friend tried to watch this DVD several times after a night out drinking, but kept passing out before the credits finished rolling!  Finally, after three failed attempts, the fourth time I put it on was in the evening rather than late at night.  I don't know if we ever stopped laughing.  Still, we laugh.  My best friend, Leroy, keeps randomly spouting out the name, ""Mitchell,"" and we just can't help but laugh.  ""Shut your mouth!""

Sorry to ramble on...

Things not to be missed:

Mitchell's random shooting of a stranger on a golf course

Mitchell's repeated arrests of his dope-fiend girlfriend (Linda Evans, who must have been blackmailed into this treasure)

Mitchell's wardrobe (the butterfly shirt, if only they really made clothes like that)

The helecopter chase (involves the butterfly shirt)

THE SEX SCENE!!!

  1. The ""Love Theme From Mitchell"" is like a hillbilly song on 45rpm.

  2. The amorphous love blob

  3. Nothing like grabbing a Schlitz six-pack in the middle of sex (with his toes!!!)

  4. I guess the beer was excited

  5. Word on the street is You're a Jerk

""We've got to close the beaches!""

""Well, you're rich and white, I don't see a problem with it.""

""Speaking of logging it, I gotta find a bush around here.""

""An empty plate breaks my heart.""

""Hey, cut out that Rockford music!  I'm Mitchell!""

Nevertheless, it is also good on its own merit. The ""movie"" Mitchell is another one of those failed TV pilot shows that the MST3K crew seemed to like so much. It basically follows the adventures of anti-hero cop Joe Don Baker as Mitchell. It is pretty obvious why the series never took off. Mitchell's character is not very endearing, and the writing of the show was atrocious. However, this is the kind of stuff that Joel and the Bots excel at, and the show has some of their best work here. I thought that the in theater humor and writing was some of the best in season 5. The only weakness in my mind is the way they send off Joel. The host segments with Gypsy are pretty weak; she really can't carry a scene on her own. Overall, this is one worth getting. The only hang up that I have with the Rhino DVD version of this movie is that they did not include the ""un-msted"" version of the movie as they had on some of their other DVDs. No big deal, since it would probably be unwatchable without the MST treatment. Overall, I highly recommend this DVD.",1138579200,,1208,4.302631578947368

It was cute how Gypsy was trying hard to save her maker when she overheard that the Mads would kill him. But the movie is a snoozer. I prefered Mike's last episode with Diobolick. The in-between story is good, but they should have picked a much better movie.",1125705600,,542,4.313725490196078

Mitch stumbles through this plot in which he drinks over 80 beers and MEETS a prostitute...

761377,5,6304022646,"Joels swan song, and also a classic ep. in its own right.
what movie producer ever thought that a film that features a fat, bloated, drunken, slovenly, all around miserable and un-likable main character would be a GOOD idea?
Joe Don Baker IS ""Mitchell,"" a cop on the case of...well, aparently he starts out on some case involving Jon Saxon but then gets assigned to sit in front of some old mobsters house for weeks on end and then comes home and gets beat up by thugs for no apparent reason and then finds hooker Linda Evans in his house, sleeps with her without question ( a VERY disturbing scene, trust me) and yet arrests her for possesion of pot.
there's some talk of a heroin shipment, Mitchell shoots some guy in a park, then there's a boat chase and a big shoot out and your left wondering what ever happened to Jon Saxon and then Mitchell sleeps with and arrests the hooker again and its the end.
I get the feeling a lot of the reson this film plays so badly is that it was edited for content...the original trailer for the film on the DVD lists it as rated R, which means Comedy Central had to chop out some offending scenes...and yet they leave in the shot of Mitchell in bed with Linda Evans grabbing a six pack of Shlitz Beer off the end table next to a big bottle of Johnsons Baby Oil, which to me was far more repulsive than any graphic violence or language they may have had to edit.
the sketches of course revolve around the escape of Joel: Gypsy over hears the Mads discussing doing away with somebody after the experiment, assumes its Joel, and sets out to find a way to get him off the ship and to safety.
I won't spoil the whole thing for those who haven't seen it, but its a perfect transition as Joel leaves and is replaced by MST3K head writer Mike Nelson.

761378,5,6304022646,"It seems they saved the best for last--for Joel Hodgson that is. MITCHELL is the ultimate in the bad made-for-tv movie that doubled as a pilot that thankfully never took off. All of which makes perfect fuel for Joel and the 'bots to tear into. It seems there is no end to the laughs and to the bad taste. Joe Don Baker is an absolute slob, and the fat jokes are deserved--the PC be damned!
I also liked this episode for the spotlight on Gypsy's rescue of Joel in a crate of Hamdingers!
My favorite moment is the horrific scene where Joe Don Baker's revolver slowly, unbearably rolls down the inside of his pants' leg, like some demonic sex organ or, worse, a product of incontinence. The screams from Joel and the 'bots are perfectly suited for the bad joke.",1085443200,6,758,4.421428571428572
761379,5,6304022646,This is the episode that converted me over to MSTK3. They give poor Joe Don Baker hell but he deserves it for a funny turkey like this. Every time I need a laugh or feel bad this makes me laugh till i'm in tears. This is $20 bucks well spent. My only complaint with the DVD is that the original version of mitchell wasn't included.

761380,5,6304022646,"""Mitchell"" is a watershed episode in the history of the classic TV comedy, ""Mystery Science Theater 3000."" For those of you unfamiliar with this amazing program, it's a ninety-minute program featuring a silhouette of a man and two robots watching a really awful movie and providing wisecracking, culturally savvy, and bitingly satiric commentary. With sketches and songs inserted at movie breaks, ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" (or MST3K for short) is one of the most delightful and hysterical comedy shows ever created. And ""Mitchell,"" broadcast in the middle of the fifth season, is one of the big moments in the show's history; it marks the departure of the show's creator and host, Joel Robinson, and the introduction of Mike Nelson as the new host.
When first watching the episode, it's easy to overlook the movie and commentary and concentrate on the running subplot in the host segments about Joel escaping the ship. I won't spoil anything about it, but it's both funny and touching. Joel's farewell is a heartfelt moment and has a special place in the hearts of many MST3K fans who felt the show was never the same without him. (I personally like Mike a lot too, but there was a wonderful, laid-back `family' feeling to the Joel episodes).
But even if this episode were not a turning point in the show's history, it would probably still be considered one of the great episodes. ""Mitchell"" has become a classic movie for MST3K fans: an icky, cheap-looking, boring, incomprehensible cop ""thriller"" released to theaters in 1975. (And yes, despite the made-for-TV look, it really was in cinemas. I found old ads for it in the New York Times!)  The commentary from Joel and the `Bots on this one is hilarious. This is a very `character' driven episode, with Joel and the `Bots dismantling the film's cast of unappealing personas, principally the title character, a zero-hero police detective played by Joe Don Baker. Mitchell is a smelly, stupid, boozy loser who the film tries to present as a loner hero against the system as he tries to take down a heroin ring and bust a trade-union lawyer who shot a burglar in the back (no, the two plots have nothing to do with one another). The story makes pretty much no sense at all, with long scenes of dialogue containing strings of similar sounding names that don't mean a thing to the audience (Gallano, Mistretta, Deaney). There's hardly any action; mostly Mitchell sits outside drug dealer Martin Balsam's house and occasionally has dinner with him and irritates his butler Merlin Olsen. There's a car chase, but according to Crow, ""It makes `Driving Miss Daisy' look like `Bullitt'!"" John Saxon is in the movie someplace, although I can't tell you for the life of me what he does. And through it all slouches the unbelievably unappealing Joe Don Baker. The love scene between him and Linda Evans will turn even the strongest stomach. And for some reason, Hoyt Axton sings the theme song. (""HOYT, HOW COULD YOU?"")
Yessir, this one's a classic: great wisecracking for a wonderfully awful film, and a important moment in the show's history. The DVD contains no extras except for the original theatrical trailer for ""Mitchell"" (did ANYONE really want to see this film when it came out?), but this is a must-have for MST3K fans. Non-fans may want to experience a few Joel episodes before seeing this so they have a frame of reference for the story, but it's unquestionably one of the definitive episodes of the show.",1081900800,18,3463,4.859560067681895
761431,5,6304022646,"This was one of the first MST3K episodes I ever saw and it remains very dear to my heart and high on my list of all-time favorites. Joe Don Baker is a big fat turd in this movie and it's funny. That's pretty much how you sum it up. Highlights include the Mitchell theme song as sung by the robots, the ""wockachicka"" music, the 10 mph car chase, Mitchell's slutty girlfriend played by Linda Evans whom he beds and then throws in the slammer, and an endless string of fat jokes.

761432,5,6304022646,"""Mitchell"" is one of the best episodes of MST3K. The movie, an awful cop thriller starring a beefy Joe Don Baker, Martin Balsam, Merlin Olsen, Linda Evans, and John Saxon, is so bad that it is hard to imagine what they were thinking when they made it. By the way, this ended up being the last episode of the original host of the show.
The DVD is shown in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio. The intermission scenes look bright and sharp, slightly better than broadcast quality. The scenes of ""Mitchell"" look soft and scratchy, with rough sound. However, it still looks a bit better than my old video. As a special feature, the disc contains the original theatrical trailer for ""Mitchell,"" which contains the memorable tagline, ""He's brute force with a badge."" Interestingly, the trailer includes some scenes that were cut out of the MST3K version, such as a scene of a villain getting his hand crushed in a car door by Mitchell, and a short scene of Mitchell getting harassed by the chief. Unlike some other MST3K DVDs, the uncut version of the film is not included. It is, however, available on a hard-to-find bare-bones DVD from Brentwood.",1073088000,,1139,4.728643216080402
761433,4,6304022646,"Make a good movie, say ""Dirty Harry"", and a thousand bad imitations will follow. Mitchell is a rather dull and formulaic cop drama about yet another police officer who ""doesn't play by the rules"", but the gang at MST3K manage to provide entertainment where the movie fails. The host segments really shine and are cleverly scripted to remove Joel Hodgson as the host and insert head writer Mike Nelson as his replacement. Although fans of the show at the time (myself included) were most sad to see Hodgson leave his brainchild, it doesn't diminish the quality of the laughs scripted in this episode. Not the funniest MST3K episode ever, but definitely worth repeated viewing. Look for Linda Evans in the film, but you may wince when she's ""makin' it"" with Joe Don Baker!",1067558400,2,770,4.796992481203008
761434,2,6304022646,"Mitchell, like Manos: The Hands of Fate, is a classic example of how NOT to make a movie, this time in the cop thriller genre. Mitchell (Joe Don Baker) is a slob and a cop (makes me feel better about who our police picks to be on the force), who stumbles into a drug caper executed by lawyer John Saxon and millionaire Martin Balsam, who send a hooker (Linda Evans) to try and get Mitchell to stay away. Amatuerish direction, bad writing, and subpar acting doom this one. The MST3K version is hella funny, with the cracks on Joe Don and the movie itself (Joe Don hated the MST3K version so much, that he threatened to beat up any of the crew if he saw them. Whatsa matter, can't take a joke?). the host segments involve a Three's Company-like misunderstanding that has Gypsy believing that the Mads want to kill Joel, so throughout the episode she tries to come up with plans to free Joel. Memorable quotes: ""Mitchell, even his name says, 'is that a beer?'"", ""My, my, my, my apartment"", and ""MITCHELL!!!"". The only redeeming quality to this piece of crap is the title song by Hoyt Axton, who probably needed the paycheck. The song is just catchy, and I find myself humming it quite often. If the plot seems totally confusing, get the unMSTied version, as it clears up most of the confusion.
The DVD is a mixed bag: the host segments are crisp and clear, while the movie itself is scratched, dirty, and a bit faded, which is what MSTies, like myself, like. The supplement on this disc is the trailer for the feature, which makes this look like an enjoyable movie. Oh, Hoyt, how could you? (Even though the MST3K version is good, I will be rating based on the movie alone. MST3K gets 5 stars, while Mitchell gets 1).

761439,5,6304022646,"I'm one of those rare creatures,and that is a British MST 3K fan. Sadly,this wonderful series has only been viewed on British television in the past by tuning into the minority sci/fi cable channel at odd times of the day. Indeed, if i hadn't heard a recommendation on the radio from a disc jockey who travels frequently to the States,then i would never have been aware of this fantastic show. I managed to tape a dozen or so episodes a couple of years back and was delighted to see that selected movies were available to order on DVD.I promptly ordered every available MST 3K episode/set through Amazon and will continue to buy these movies when more are advertised, as the series is not available in my country. I viewed the Joe Don Baker ""classic"" Mitchell a couple of days ago and loved every second of it. Why this cop thriller never made a series is easy to see but if it had,then it would've very quickly established a world wide cult following. The dialogue is excruciatingly bad throughout and our ""hero"" Mitchell lumbers his way from one ridiculous scene to another. I'm pretty sure that Linda Evans who plays a prostitute and Mitchell's female entertainment, cringes every time she remembers her role. It makes her part in Dynasty look like Oscar winning material and i'll bet that it will never be included on her acting CV.The amusing comments by the team are well up to standard and will have all purchasers laughing out loud. My only reservation about the MST 3K series are the scenes away from the movie featuring an assortment of strange and usually unfunny characters who always seem to be an unnecessary distraction from the main attraction. In closing,i would fully recommend this episode to all those with an interest in the series and i will continue to preach the MST 3k gospel to the uninitiated in the UK.",1051056000,,1830,4.686335403726708

I thought that the commentary from Joel and the robots was funny, but I thought the actual movie was kind of slow. After a while I started losing interest, which has never happened while watching MST3K. I would not say that this movie is bad, but I guess I'm so used to seeing really bad movies being made fun of on this series that this one didn't seem to live up to the standards I now have. ""Mitchell"" seems more like a legitimate movie instead of the horrible B-movies I'm used to.
I would tell any MST3K fan to watch this film and form your own opinions. I would also suggest adding this film to your collection, regardless of what you think about the movie. You can never have too many MST3K episodes!",1050624000,,959,4.333333333333333

Mitchell is an example of how funny the crew can be, and as a long time fan of the series, (I hate to say this) but how much poor Mike J.

761516,5,6304022646,"Mitchell has got to be one of my very favorite movies.  The actual movie isn't too painful, and Joel and the bots make it great.  Starring Joe Don Baker as sloppy, alcoholic cop ""Mitchell"".  Crow riffs ""Joe Don Baker would be good playing Elvis: The Dying Days"".  Linda Evans plays a pot-smoking hooker.  Joel says, ""Linda Evans?  This was her pre-Yanni gig.""  Servo answers, ""Yeah, before her face was pulled taut!""  Mitchell spends most of the movie either sitting out side of someone's house, or following people around.  At one point, he gets into the lamest car chase scene ever.  It is truly painful to behold.  Some of the best lines are delivered during this scene, such as: ""Whoa, they're traveling at speeds of up to 25 mph!"" ""I've seen faster funeral processions!"" ""The vicious Mustang culls the weak ones from the herd."" ""Why does he keep downshifting his automatic?"" ""That shook up the beers pretty bad.""  There is also a hilarious host segment in which Tom and Crow are riding pogo sticks, singing the Bonanza song.  Anyway, the movie ends with a cheesy boat scene, which nevertheless has some funny lines, like: ""Mmmm, this sure is good booze!"" ""Ok I'm gonna start taking off my clothes, you'd better stop me!"" ""See ya later, CHUM!"" ""I guess it's one of those shots that's too expensive to show.""  All in all, this movie is a must have!",1032912000,,1351,4.669491525423729
761517,5,6304022646,"After watching the MST3K official movie, I was dying to get some more, so I more or less randomly rented ""The Beginning of the End"" and ""Mitchell"".
""The Beginning of the End,"" your typical giant arthropod movie, had some funny moments, such as afterwards when Mike uses a plastic grasshopper and some postcards to replicate the special effects: ""They're eating the Beatles!""  And when a grasshopper eats a deaf mute:  ""He's signing Aaaaaah!""  But generally it was slow-moving and not too funny.
Later I watched Mitchell, and was incredibly gratiated.  The movie, a 70's film about a police detective, breaks several Hollywood rules, most notably that a) the star of the movie should not first appear on screen slumped in the back of a police car, b) the star must be a moderately likeable person, and c) car chases generally exceed 25 mph.
It's easily the worst movie I've ever seen, unworthy to even be called B-grade.  70's hair and clothes abound (""Can you turn up the volume on that jacket?"" Tom quips), and the whole plot is revealed in the first few minutes of the film.  It features about as little suspense as is possible.
Ah-the chase scene!  In sluggish, ugly 70's cars, Mitchell dawdles after his opponent, both never exceeding the posted speed limits, and using their turn signals.  ""Next week: the Cloverleaf!""  says one of the robots.
Fortunately, Joel and his robot companions save us from dying of Mitchellation with their endless barrage of quips.  I don't want to give too much of it away, so I'll just give you a couple for the road:
Movie:  Mitchell, what would your mother say?
Crow:  She'd say he's not mine!  You can't prove it!
Tom, while a guy chases another guy on foot:  Hey, this is faster than that car chase we just watched.
My sister and I can no longer take the word Mitchell seriously.  I've pledged to name my firstborn after this movie.  A must-see for MST3K fans, and any lover of bad movies.",1028073600,,1928,4.6765578635014835
761518,5,6304022646,"After more than four years MST3k finally took on Joe Don Baker with Mitchell. Obviously a beefed up TV pilot, Mitchell has Joe Don as the only cop in his station who sees the relevance in clues Inspector Clousseau couldn't have missed (Mitchell: ""The gun collection was high up on the wall and the burglar only looks about five four."" Mitchell's boss: ""Well, what does that mean?"") He's also a fat, alcoholic, porn-reading slob. I really can't believe anyone thought the public could get behind a hero like this. He goes up against Martin Balsam (a long way from the foreman in 12 Angry Men) as a drug peddler whose house is being staked out. This means about two-thirds of the movie is just Mitchell sitting in his car watching the guy. The whole thing ends with a near shot-for-shot ripoff of Key Largo, and Mitchell returns to his house to find the hooker he's been sleeping with the whole time. After sleeping with her one more time (yuck!) he finds some pot in her coat and arrests her. Man, double standard zero tolerance is so funny, huh? Oh, and there's also a 25 MPH ""car chase"", and a truly surreal encounter with a little kid where both of them endlessly repeat the other. No riffs are needed here, Tom screaming his head off is enough. The host segments are great too, with Joel finally escaping the SOL in the aptly named escape pod Deus Ex Machina. Down in Deep 13, a temp worker named Mike Nelson helps the Mads out while they're being audited. I see big things in his future. I was surprised at one thing, though: Tom points out that John Saxon seems to disappear from the film, but one of the scenes that they cut from the show had him being killed! It's a lousy movie, but at least be fair to it. Still, if you're an MST3k fan you really can't afford not to have this episode in your library.",1026000000,2,1810,4.405970149253731
761519,5,6304022646,"All I can say is wow!  This is, in my opinion, the best MST3K episode of the Joel era.  No, the movie has nothing to do with ""science""-fiction and there's no real ""mystery"" to speak of, so it may not be the quintessential MST3K episode, but to me, it's one of the funniest.
I think one of the main reasons for that is that the movie really isn't that poorly done.  Yeah, it's boring, unoriginal and downright goofy at times, but it was not all that poorly made.  With many of the episodes, the writers could just sit there and point out continuity errors, editing foul-ups, flubbed lines, and many other things in succession for the whole movie.  With this one, they were forced to work a little harder and I think the jokes show that.
Really, the director seemed at least competent, the production design, while not spectacular, was at least not poor.  The acting, for the most part, was serviceable, especially from vets like Martin Balsam and John Saxon.
Really, it had many great elements for an MST3K movie:  1) slovenly, unlikeable ""hero"", 2) goofy, stereotypical villains (""I'm-a Italian you know""), 3) Merlin Olsen, 4) a guy who looks like Andy Kaufmann, and the list could go on.  Each one of these elements helped to allow for the MST3K writing team to just rip into the movie without remorse.  The fact the Mitchell as portrayed by Joe Don Baker was such a jerk, slob and lowlife meant that they didn't have to feel bad about pointing out those things.  They had carte blanche.
For many MST fans, this episode was the last one they can watch, as it is Joel's final appearance.  For other fans, the episodes got better and better as they went on, even with Mike replacing the beloved Joel.  I actually tend to like the Mike episodes better on the whole, but I have no problem watching episodes from season 3 through 7 (before they jumped to Sci-Fi channel, andlost Trace Beaulieu) interchangeably.  With that said, I think this is by far the best Joel episode, and on par with Mike greats like Red Zone Cuba (619), High School Big Shot (618), and Escape 2000 (705).
I think Joel's send off was appropriately done.  Many people may dispute that, but if he had to go, leaving on a box of hamdingers was a nice touch.",1023753600,2,2224,4.5275

While the movie in question might not be as inexplicably horrible as others that have been lambasted by Joel and the Bots, all of it's elements (cheesy dialogue, incomprehensible plot, ridiculous cops and robbers scenes, and of course, Joe Don Baker the fat slob hero) make for some great opportunities for the MST3K gang to do what they do best.  What do they do best?  Well they make offhand comments about the movie of course!  And they're HILARIOUS!!
Mitchell is some sort of story about a drug bust, and a misfit cop who is given the assignment.  At least I think so.  There's also some junk about Mitchell and a prostitute, and Mitchell's life as an unloved police officer.  But are plots important in these movies?  NO!!!  The lack of a plot just makes this funnier.
It is well that this should serve as Joel's final hurrah with MST3K, because it's a finely crafted episode, and I'm thankful we can own it on video.  So say goodbye to Joel, and say hello to Mike with the next episode, ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die.""

The wonderful movie for Joel's farewell episode is Mitchell, some kind of lame cop-action-thing with a stupid plot revolving around drugs and prostitutes and Joe Don Baker's hideous acting. Perfect ammunition for Joel & co. to unleash one of the finest barrages of jokes in the entire series! You can tell the writers had fun with this movie.

761564,5,6304022646,"He's Mitchell!  He's an out of shape detective who likes to take naps and shout at kids.  He's a cop who plays by his own rules except when his boss shouts at him in which case he meekly leaves the office (apparently even rouge cops have feelings).  He's a lady-killer who can't keep his gun in his waistband or his beer foam off his dates.  He's Mitchell!
MITCHELL is one of those films that you can see slowly going wrong.  The original script probably wasn't all that awful.  Then, likely, there were a few changes made to it by a committee of studio types.  Someone may have thought that the ending of KEY LARGO would be really great at the end of a Joe Don Baker feature.  Someone else might have decided to turn the Mitchell character into a bit of a slob.  The director may have thought to emphasize the sloppiness even more for amusement value.  All of these little problems add up to massive amounts of hilarity.  MST3k always works best when the film they are watching could be laughed at without the help of the bots and that's certainly the case.  There is a lot to make fun of here, from the illogic of the plot to the chase scenes that don't go above 20 miles per hour (the helpful car in the lead carefully puts its indicators on at each intersection, presumably, so that no one following gets lost).  And they don't miss a single opportunity.
If you've never seen an episode of MST3k, then MITCHELL is a great place to begin.  The film in question isn't as truly painful as some of the others that have been lampooned over the years (see MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE or THE INCREDIBLY STRANGE CREATURES WHO STOPPED LIVING AND BECAME MIXED-UP ZOMBIES if you dare), so you can ease into the flow of things without running, screaming, from your television set in horror.
(The DVD version of this episode comes with the original theatrical trailer for MITCHELL.  It's a hoot.  Unfortunately, unlike other MST3k DVD releases, the uncut version is not available as an extra.)",1011657600,,1981,4.507002801120448

Mitchell is great target material for the MST crew.  I would love to have been a fly on the wall while the writers were viewing this horrible 70's film.
Joe Don Baker as Mitchell! is a fat drunk bad cop.  There is supposed to be some mafia drug plot, but nobody cares.  When Mitchell shoots a man in the back as he's running away, the movie soundtrack switches to some wanky, carnival music.  It's inexplicable the directorial and editorial choices made on this movie.
Take for instance a 90 second scene that shows drunk Mitchell passed out on his sofa bed, he chucks a beer can and stumbles to the shower. end of scene????
Or the 20 lines of dialogue the script dedicates to soup.  SOUP!!
Linda Evans is a high priced call girl that Mitchell let's live in his cave/apartment until he finds she has pot and he busts her.  Talk about a double standard.
Then some kid on a skate board, who is supposed to be her son,  bothers Mitchell while he is sitting in his car on a stakeout?
Where did he come from?  (Mitchell sits in his car for half the movie, btw)

I'd love to know who greenlighted the original Mitchell production, because this is truly one awful movie. Joe Don Baker, Linda Evans, John Saxon, and Merlin Olsen must have had some contractual obligations... Murder, drugs, some sloppy lovin', and the slowest car chase in the world make this the ultimate cheesefest.
Sad that this was Joel's last episode, but they send him off with grace and dignity in a wonderful mock-up of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as well as a nod to traditional Greek theatre. Joel and the 'bots do some of their best work with the material, and several viewings are needed just to keep up with the zingers that get by.

When life gives you lemonade, a film like 'Mitchell' is enough to turn it back into lemons again. Joel and The Bots (J&TB) do a great job giving this turkey the riffing it deserves, but the episode is bittersweet, since it's Joel's final appearance on the Satellite of Love (save for a cameo in one of the Sci-Fi Channel episodes).

""Mitchell"" was a typical mid-70s detective TV movie (I suspect it was a failed pilot), complete w/ big Kojak-style American cars, painfully cheesy dialog, and gratuitous lapels.  It cries out for the MST3K treatment because it takes itself so seriously.
See:
-the world's slowest car chase!
-a menacing Merlin Olsen!
-a classic John Saxon villain nonperformance!
-Joe Don Baker + Linda Evans + a bottle of baby oil = the most disturbing scene ever committed to film!
-finally, sadly, Joel Hodgson's graceful exit from the series via a convenient box of hamdingers.
Rumor has it that Joe Don Baker was furious at the MST3K treatment of this meisterwerk.  I can understand it, I guess...he was sort of a 1970s quasiserious character actor.  JDB is truly a better actor when he satirizes his own slobby character, for example in ""Goldeneye"" and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"".

This is the full-tilt, 360-degree, last-second, game-winning  slam-dunk of an episode, a guaranteed laugh riot that I can still watch  again and again.
What hasn't been said about this movie?  Well, for one  thing, I don't know if any one has commented on how truly embarrassed  Martin Balsam looks throughout.  Every moment of his performance has the  feel of a tacit apology as he tries to make silk purses out of the  stockyards of sows' ears that he was handed by the screenwriters.  He did  it for the money, and lets the audience know it in scene after scene.  He  was a gifted actor, too often wasted in dreck like this.  Yet he comes off  infinitely better than the star of the show, one Joe Don Baker.  Understand  that if you limit Baker's screen time in most movies, as has been done by  smarter filmmakers than these, he's not nearly as repulsive as he is here.  But director Andrew McLaglen insists on having him in virtually every  scene, with lots of close-ups of Baker's beefy face to accentuate...exactly  what again?  This is pure white-sploitation, a 'Shaft' meets 'Dirty  Harry' without either of those films' energies or convictions.  Think about  it.  Who is Mitchell?  He's a tough supercop who can't stand the confining  rules of 'the system', and by the way, he's also an irresistible stud.  One  of those guys again?  Like the character, the movie is a wasteful thud, too  slow to be exciting, too cheap-looking to be flashy.
That's what  our boys exploit--the intrinsic weaknesses of the lame story and the truly  dreadful protagonist that isn't even likable as an anti-hero.
Meanwhile, the out-of-theater story kicks into gear immediately as Gypsy  (voiced by Jim Mallon) overhears Frank and Forrester (Frank Conniff and  Trace Beaulieu) discussing the elimination of a 'be-jumpsuited fool', whom  Gypsy assumes to be the beloved Joel Robinson (Joel Hodgson), friend and  human creator.  This scene is cleverly played as a parody of a scene in  ""2001"" as the scene cuts from Gypsy watching 'the Mads' to  close-ups of the duo having a their discussion, which the audience can tell  is actually about a temp Frank hired, Mike Nelson (played by Mike Nelson).  Gypsy leaps into action to figure out how to get Joel off the ship  (""Charter flight?  No.""), while Crow (Beaulieu) and Tom Servo  (Kevin Murphy) are oblivious as usual to Gypsy's problems.  Finally a  solution is reached, thanks to Mike--and the slow-witted Frank (Mike needs  the keys to a control panel to gain control of the ship's computers, so he  simply asks for them: ""Frank, can I borrow your keys?""  ""Okay.""  And when Frank wonders why Mike wanted the keys, Mike  says it's because he left his lights on.  And when Frank counters that he  doesn't own a car, Mike asks him why he lent him the keys in the first  place.  Which leaves Frank confused and apologetic.).  Joel escapes in the  aptly-named ""Deux Ex Machina"" hidden in a box of the Spam-like  Hamdingers, lands in the Australian Outback and never returns. (Except for  a marvelous appearance in Episode 1001, not available on video.)  Thankfully for their experiment and for the show, 'the Mads' decide to  bring the temp on to their staff full-time, whether he likes it or not.  Welcome aboard, Mike.

If you've been put off by MSTs as described in #1 above  (""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" comes to mind), please give it  another chance with Mitchell. You'll never look at Joe Don the same, even  if he does a cute cameo in ""Reality Bites"" as Winona Ryder's  father.",951091200,19,1056,4.409326424870466
761767,5,6304022646,"This is far and away my favorite MST episode. From Johnny Mathis robbing Saxon's house to Servo's ""3M"" narration, this tape requires at least three viewings to catch all the jokes your laughing will drown out!  The host segments are OK, but the real showcase here is...MITCHELL!  Chronicling the adventures of a slovenly, hygenically-challenged cop with a  love of ring-dings, steak and cheap beer, this movie is a total laugh-riot.  Joe Don Baker lurches through his role with all the grace of a hobo coming  off a four-day bender. His pudgy, porsine face looks like a mass of pizza  dough to which someone has affixed a pair of wax lips, and his ill-fitting,  overly loud wardrobe causes one to wonder if Mitchell hasn't been fishing  in the Salvation Army bin. Also worth mentioning is the scene in which  Mitchell beds Linda Evans. This sequence couldn't be more nauseating if the  producers had included coprophilia. One look at Evans running her fingers  around Baker's food-encrusted mouth, and you'll be woofing your groceries!  Basically, to understand this movie, you need only view the scene in which  Mitchell is lying in his filth-ridden bed in a beer-clouded haze, his giant  stomach sticking out like a medicine ball. Around him are crushed beer  cans, food wrappers and cigarette butts. No doubt the clammy stink of  skid-marked underpants, week-old pizza and decay hangs in the room. The MST  gang looks at this scene, and Crow remarks: ""Ladies and gentlemen, our  hero."" That says it all!",949276800,4,1506,4.956

761769,5,6304022646,"""Mitchell"" marks the last MST3K episode featuring Joel Robinson, who in this episode finds his way back to earth in an escape pod disguised in a crate maked ""Hamdingers"".
Additionally, this particular  episode marks one of the relatively few times the series took on a movie  genre other than sci-fi.  The results are hilarious, and it makes you  wonder why Best Brains, who produced the series, didn't consider lampooning  more godawful cop and detective movies.  The 70's were full of movies like  ""Mitchell"" that deserved the MST treatment just as much!
As  mentioned by numerous other reviewers, the ""baby oil"" scene is so  smarmy that Crow can't help but throw out the wisecracks...which definitely  makes an improvement!
One final note:  The MST3K Episode Guide mentions  that Joe Don Baker was furious over this particular episode and made some  threats to various cast members.  Whether true or not, it certainly adds to  the legend!",947203200,3,941,5.0588235294117645
761810,5,6304022646,"This is one of the best MST3K episodes around. This episode is #512. This episode is also the last episode for Joel Hodgson to star in. Even though he's going to leave they picked a GREAT movie for Joel's last show called  Mitchell.
Jon Don Baker is Mitchell, a not so bright, not so clean,  heavy drinking, lazy cop who doesn't play by the rules. He stumbles onto a  drug ring and begins conducting an investigation. The drug lords send him  hooker Linda Evans so he could stay off the case, but she falls for our fat  Joe Don Baker. But our hero doesn't quit, he stays on the investigation.  Overall our hero walks around and kills a few people, drinks a few beers,  eats some food, and so on.
Joel & his robot pals do a great job  MSTing this trash which makes this movie worth watching. They make many  jokes about Joe Don Baker that are just hilarious. The host segments are  also funny. This video should be bought right away for any MST3K fan to  enjoy as soon as possible. I think you'll like it VERY much!",946684800,2,1014,4.28421052631579

From the  opening waka jawaka jibes you know you're in for one hell of a treat. MST3K  was never funnier. This is also the only episode to feature both Joel  Robinson and Mike Nelson as hosts.

They ended up making fun of him even worse in the recent  episode Final Justuce. It's a really dull 70s cop movie with lots of action  and an annoying old fashoned 50s song that goes like: Ma Ma Ma Ma  Mitchell!! There's also the horrific baby oil sequince.

Besides one standout host segment, there's little if anything that's redeeming in this episode. I wonder if it would make so many favorite lists sans fans feeling sentimental because Joel leaves the show here. Separate that from all the other content and almost nothing worthwhile remains.

Too much reliance on criticizing the lead character with simplistic, exaggerated, unfunny barbs. No need for anyone to waste time with Mitchell when she or he could watch Mistie brilliance via Skydivers, Laserblast, Jack Frost, I Accuse My Parents, or Samson vs. The Vampire Women.
