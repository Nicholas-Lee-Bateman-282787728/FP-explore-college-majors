7120228,4,B00W57VDL6,"My kids really enjoy this show- even more so now that Dan's little brother Trek is the lead character. Upon receiving this DVD in the mail, my 3 boys proceeded to watch it every time we made an outing in the car (whether we were traveling 10 minutes or an hour, this DVD was playing in the back seat). Their favorite on this disc was the costume party episode where Trek keeps changing his mind about what dinosaur he wants to dress as for the event and finally settles on a combination costume! They watched it at least 3 times last week! I think part of their attraction to this show comes from the fact that the lead character is close to their age, so they can relate to him. Also, I don't know a whole lot of little guys who aren't fascinated to some extent by the concept of dinosaurs. If you're looking for a fun show that your kids will ask for again and again, try this one.
