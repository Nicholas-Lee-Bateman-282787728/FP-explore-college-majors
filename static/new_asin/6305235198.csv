995109,4,6305235198,I went out on a limb and bought Peking Opera Blues without having viewed it previously and wasn't disappointed.  The film is essential viewing for those interested in Hong Kong cinema or more agressively open action films.  The comedy and action are both played above high pitch.  My only complaint  about the DVD is the language problems on the subtitles.  You can get the  jist of the dialogue but it lacks the clearness of some better efforts;  namely Criterion's supurb The Killer and Hard Boiled.  Give Peking Opera  Blues a shot and keep an opened mind.,949276800,7,559,4.739583333333333
995110,5,6305235198,"As a college student at Brigham Young University, I have seen literally dozens upon dozens of international films, and this one ranks as near the very top--one of my favorites.  Action-packed and hilarious!  I have been  searching for it for over 5 years. . . and finally found someone who can  deliver.",942624000,4,303,4.769230769230769
995111,4,6305235198,"Hollywood likes to think it can make films with strong female characters. However, more often than not, these characters are masculinised and far from sympathetic. Peking Opera Blues shows Hollywood how it should be done.  Three strong roles for Brigitte Lin, Sally Yeh and Cherrie Chung and not at  the expense of excellent male characters such as Mark Cheng's. Also, the  feisty three retain all the charm and innocence that the Hollywood versions  lack. Tsui Hark creates a visual treat for all film fans and manages to  whip the audience into the frothy action. A superb mixture of action,  comedy and drama.",941673600,5,612,4.950980392156863
995112,5,6305235198,"Few directors in any contry can match Tsui Hark's creativity and virtuosity.  This was one of the first movies to attract international attention to Hong Kong cinema.  The story is about three women  revolutionaries in a 1920's China.  The film gracefully fuses comedy,  drama, and action.  A note to action fans: action sequences are  choreographed by Ching Siu Tung, the man who staged action sequences in  John Woo's ""The Killer.""  Tsui Hark also produced that movie.",933552000,3,470,5.078947368421052

7885811,4,6305235198,This is a really funny film. I would love to see the 3 friends that survive all the adventures they went through get a sequel.,1414800000,,126,4.08
7885812,4,6305235198,"We first saw Peking Opera Blues in the late 80s in grad school -- the U film club ran a HK movie festival every summer.  This was the first movie, the first year, and what a great start!  It hooked us on HK movies.  The story's a little creaky at times, and the subtitling is execrable, but the acting is good and the choreography and stunts fabulous.  Tsui Hark is an outstanding director.  BTW, I have seen complaints about the English subtitling elsewhere -- I think it is the same subtitling that was provided in the 80s, not something that was just slapped on a new release.  A lot of the HK movies from this time are as bad.  You will have no trouble understanding the story, even with some moments of puzzlement.  Well worth the money, especially in blu ray.",1356566400,2,765,4.375886524822695
7885813,5,6305235198,"This is one of Tsui Hark's best early films from the 1980s when he was just getting on a fantastic roll. Yes, this is cornball. Yes, it is unpolished with a capital U. However, it is the main film that started the incredible period classic action comedy format that Tsui Hark and Hong Kong does best. The other thing that makes this such an enjoyable movie is these three excellent actresses in a movie together. This is one of Brigitte Lin's best roles. It is also very rare for three women to all play strong lead roles with no male hero. This is simply wonderful. The action is paced fast, and the comedy sprinkled in nicely.
This movie is the sleeper of the century. It will be famous in a hundred years, but right now it is forgotten by many. I cant believe they let such a gem go OOP. There may be other versions still available. The Deltamac is an identical print to the rare Megastar Media Asia.",1310947200,5,903,4.349112426035503
7885814,3,6305235198,"""Peking Opera Blues"" gets three stars mainly due to a heightened excitement at the end, but lacking a strong introduction. There was something exciting about this film within the final thirty minutes, but this film had to be watched during the day. Evening viewings made me sleepy, thus forcing to re-watch the beginning four to five times. This was a challenging film, with intense action and sexual innuendo, it was groundbreaking for the late 80s, but it just didn't have a voice. I don't think I could watch this film again. It was exciting, just not excitable. Remember - there was a cross-dressing woman randomly placed, jackets can block a barrage of bullets, and jewels do not a plot make.",1242000000,,697,4.816666666666666
7885815,1,6305235198,"The Movie POB is one of the best (plot, direction, casting, acting)
My dvd player has NEVER given me subtitle problems in viewing over 200 dvds. This Fortune Star produced disc from RHStore has Cantonese, Mandarin, and English subtitle selections, the first two work, the English subtitles show nothing. They did show on my computer, but this is a less than standard disc.",1173312000,,372,4.920634920634921
7885816,5,6305235198,"A great film for any Hong Kong movie buff or newbie. How can you beat having three of Hong Kong's most beautiful leading ladies - Brigitte Lin, Cherie Chung, Sally Yeh in the same film? The Chinese opera scenes are beautifully costumed and shot. Tsui Hark is a genius!",1094601600,2,268,4.489795918367347
7885817,5,6305235198,"I saw this movie a long long time ago in Burbank, CA when the mall theater was having a week long HongKong Film Festival.  Like eating out, I wanted to try something new.  That's why I always tell my little kids, ""try it even if it seems a little different, a little strange, you might like it and it might become your favorite."" This goes for everything, food, travel, books and movies.  I  own the VHS version.  It is a little rough in quality so I am checking if there is a DVD version out there that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. The VHS alone cost $27 some odd dollars in 1994. So I am very happy that it is in DVD version. Now, the is simple to follow. The tile roof scene is incredible and the three leading ladies are simply beautiful.  I know Hong Kong Films are en vouge right now, but you must see this and own it because it is a classic and I agree, a quentesential of its genre.  You will not be dissappointed.  Just ignore the goofy English translation, it is part of the fun.",1050278400,7,991,4.098445595854923
7885818,5,6305235198,"First of all, the movie: I was very hesitant to see this movie, as it is relatively old (released around 1986, I think).  However, I've become a big fan of HK movies lately, and many critics consider this the quintessential Hong Kong movie.  The story centers around the escapades of three women (played by Brigitte Lin, Sally Yeh and Cherie Chung, all popular HK starlets), with plenty of action, comedy, espionage and political intrigue set in a Chinese opera house.  Although this was one of Tsui Hark's (considered by some the ""Spielberg of Hong Kong"") earliest works, this is still considered to be his best.  Very entertaining movie which, more than any other HK movie I won, is worthy of repeated viewing.  One of the few TRUE Hong Kong classics.  You won't be disappointed.
The DVD: not the best video quality around, but surprisingly good considered this is a 15-year old Hong Kong movie.  The sound is in 5.1 surround sound, and Cantonese and Mandarin audio are provided (with plenty of options for subtitles, including English).  Of course, the subtitles can be horrid at times, but you can follow the dialogue easily and they certainly will not detract from your enjoyment of the movie.  Trailers for this movie (and a couple others) are included.  Nice menus.
Highly recommended.  You COULD wait for a special edition, or a remastered version to come out, but I haven't heard of one in the works.  Plus, this is still a good quality disk that is worth the purchase.",982454400,15,1478,4.775590551181103
7885819,5,6305235198,"I used to love this one and consider it as a sentimental drama. It do has meaning something, in a hilarious, entertainment way. Now I own the DVD, play it over and over again. Finally I can read the hidden message. In it's multilayers there's a little bit of everything. It's feminism above all, IMHO.
It doesn't matter if you know nothing about Chinese history. Tsao Wan could be the most bewildered role to the audience, rebel without a cause. She should knew her action might lead to her father's collapse. Though dress like a man, she's fragile inside. Sheung Hung is a material girl care about only her own  profit, provide comic relief. She has justified herself by come to the rescue for Tsao Wan, still lovable. Pat Neil seems to be quite ordinary in comparison, actually toughest of the three leads. Helping uncle Fa escape shows her tenderness. Her wish to be an actress only got the blame everytime there're bad things happen. ( For ex. Troops wrecked the theater. ) Cause only male were allowed to perform on stage at that time. Then I found similar tradition in ancient Britain too. ( Shakespeare  In Love ) Women were under restraint by old culture. She grew  up in the troupe. She tried to prove her talent, how good she could be, seize every chance. But the first obstacle came from her father, how ironic. ( Well. "" It's the trend of time, and the father merely trying to protect her "" kind of speech. ) Though she has no ambition, was drawn into the revolute unwittingly. Sally Yeh was trained hard to perform her own acrobatics, without a stunt double. To make the character  convincible. She's at her best, never can be more gorgeous than this role. To see greedy warlords scramble for power and profit. How flexible the manager ( Wu-Ma ) is. There're diversity  characteristic in this hilarious film.
There're some outtakes in the trailer. The catchy ballad along with the soundtrack quite enjoyable. Those "" hide and seek ""
roar with laughter scenes. And the metaphor "" Life is dramatic "" theme. You can watch this film many times and still find things you missed before. My only criticism would be, if they spent more budget on shoot some substantial landscape, might persuade me it's in real Beijing. By the way, I think the English subtitle is O.K. but there's a pun joke it can't deliver well. While the warlord took Pat Neil to blackmail her father, he asked what's tonight's show? It was named "" Stubborn King "" the true meaning is "" force her to be my concubine "". Sorry force you to tolerate my poor English.",977702400,17,2538,4.581497797356828
