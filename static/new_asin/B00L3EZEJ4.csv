8663567,5,B00L3EZEJ4,"With every word and every note, Wayne Shorter digs deep into the essence, and somehow brings the viewer/listener to something essential in himself. It would be insufficient to call this a window into the creative process (although it certainly is that). It's a window into the heart and soul of a genuine human being through his words and music. And in Brian, John and Danilo, Wayne has found that rare perfect combination. No place here for the density of ego, these musicians fly as one, carrying us along with them on an exalting journey into the high art of improvisational discovery. Much gratitude is due the filmmaker for bringing this unique film into existence. A truly remarkable achievement in every respect.",1444608000,2,719,4.950413223140496

8663571,5,B00L3EZEJ4,"I was tired of wating for director Dorsay Alavi, who has been steadily working on the documentary for several years, to complete his film. This excellent film shows Wayne Shorter and group providing each other the freedom to reinvent and form music always again. Surprising insights into the essence of their music open up, as well as the realization that true Creator-Spirit goes far beyond pure virtuosity.

And to show what they were talking about, they added the bonus feature, a Paris 2012 concert of The Wayne Shorter Quartet. Excllent concert, great DVD.",1412035200,15,561,5.032258064516129
