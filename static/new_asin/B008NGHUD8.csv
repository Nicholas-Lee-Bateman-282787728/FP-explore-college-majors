8529122,5,B008NGHUD8,I love kettle ball workouts.  This one is great.,1439942400,,48,4.333333333333333
8529123,5,B008NGHUD8,"I just got into kettlebells:-)  My first experience is to the Kettle Worx Cardio DVD and RKS (Disc 1).

I enjoyed the Kettle Worx Cardio greatly.  I have injuries to back and neck and going through this program 2x, back to back in 2 days did not hurt me at all.  I saw results after the first day.  With this DVD there is a warm up with the Kettlebell that is brief, but quite easy for most people to do.  Then you go into some some of the typical kettlebell stuff with swings, pulls.  You also do a little running in place with your kettlebell and also mountain climbers and kettlebell pushups.  I got a nice sweat 12 minutes into the program and when I was done.  I enjoy sweating.  There's not much time in between different exercise to even break, which keeps your heart rate up.

There are 6 different sets of exercise sessions, one for each of the 6 weeks.

I find there's a lot of variety per session, I don't get bored and he doesn't repeat the same boring set back to back... you go onto another stage of exercises and then repeat the same set of exercises a 2nd time around... totally beats out the boredom.  By the time you hit the 2nd set, you're too tired to realize you had repeated those exercises before.  Smart move:-)

You get a whole body workout per 20 minute session.

I did not come out of this exercise feeling in pain and actually if done in the morning I get a lot of energy from working out to this.

THEN....
I bought the RKS set.  I've only did the first session of Disc 1.  Okay, RKS IS effective, however its a little bit boring, but the studio backdrop is so interesting and the way they have the timer off the side, you forget you're only doing one exercise for the entire 20 or 30 minutes.  The first is the swing... it gets more diverse as you progress the discs.  I did this, I was in pain during it as it aggrivated my back injury... its also so repetitive when I was done my elbows and knees ached.  However, the next day when I wore jeans, they sat high on the waist and my buns were sucked in!

After going through one RKS session, my 3rd day I was in too much sore muscle pain to enjoy my Kettle Worx DVD.

If you have injuries, fibromyalagia, etc., I would suggest Kettle Worx Cardio.  But if you've got no injuries good genes, etc. I would do the RKS.  I'm switching up between RKS and Kettle Worx.  I feel Kettle Worx will give you a longer/leaner look... while RKS helps to build strength.

UPDATE:

EXERCISE 2:  The second week of exercises is more intense than the first week but you're really focusing on your arms and midsection.  You're going to be doing more floor exercises like Figure 8. I found that to be fun, even though more intricate.  It was starting to resemble a bootcamp because there is also running around the kettlebell itself and jumping jacks involved (a little more high impact but you can opt not to do it but its suppose to spring up your metabolism if you do).  However, after doing it and being sooooo sweaty... I so enjoyed it:-)  Your heart will totally pound for about a good 30 minutes after the workout. To tell you the truth, I hate to see how Exercise (week) 3 is going to look like.",1379462400,,3161,4.265993265993266
