seen the story done better before...

8643574,4,B00INB7UO2,I watched this over a period of nights each a week apart and I couldn't wait for the next one. It is a very fantastic story and very well acted. I loved seeing the scenes in Africa and it opened my eyes up to what a beautiful place it is and the diverse lives that the people live there. This was a story that brought me to a place that I didn't know and maybe helped me to see what everyone is going through with disease all over the world.  Living here in the states we just assume that we are the only ones who go to foreign countries and try to help the people. It made me think about a lot of things that are going on in the world now. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a gripping story line.,1398211200,7,706,3.9027777777777777
8643575,5,B00INB7UO2,"As intriguing a title as KENNEDY'S BRAIN is, it really has the most tenuous connection to the three hour, two part mini-series that bears its name. Nonetheless, the mini-series is a first-rate adventure about a mother's need to know the fate of her son.

It has been theorized over the years, along with other conspiratorial thinking, that John F. Kennedy's brain (which was not buried with his other bodily remains) was in fact stored separately by Kennedy's brother, Bobby. The theory goes that the younger Kennedy didn't want the various medications the President was taking to come to light. Originally stored in a locker at the National Archives, some three years after JFK's assassination it was discovered the brain was missing. Like many aspects surrounding one of the more infamous events of the 1960s, we'll never know for sure.

Fortunately, the plot of KENNEDY'S BRAIN resolves a lot more satisfactorily than any conspiracy theories involving the Kennedy family.

Iris Berben, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Diane Lane, plays the central role of the mother. Distraught after the apparent suicide of her son, she undertakes a harrowing journey to find the real cause of her son's death. Her sleuthing takes her to South Africa where she discovers a conspiracy that involves AIDS research. Ms Berben is a Member of the Board of the German AIDS Foundation in real life, so it is safe to conclude the script appealed to her. Her committed performance suggests her passion for the subject matter far beyond the maternal instincts that motivates her character's actions.

There are some genuine surprises along the way and the revelation of the scandal her son was helping to uncover speaks to many issues: greed, prejudice, the need for power, some genuine desire to care for the AIDS-stricken, and the willingness to exploit Africans, where some of the highest percentages of AIDS patients are to be found.

The plot moves along at quite a clip and the exotic locales serve the story well. Just don't expect anything revealing about the Kennedys and enjoy the story for what it is.

KENNEDY'S BRAIN is an entertaining, involving way to spend three hours of your time.
