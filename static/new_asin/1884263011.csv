201894,3,1884263011,Well let me say that i never had a video of how to learn to play drums without tension until now wow he goes into detail about using one hand drumming and many more,1346025600,,164,3.8529411764705883
201895,5,1884263011,"In a word, You BET!  OK, two words, but that seems fitting as tiger Bill has this habbit of giving more than you expect.  I had not played in years.  Then I got frustrated at work, and pulled the kit back out and started to play again.  Then I got hit with a diagnosis of cancer, and thought I should get serious fast.  (I am remission so I have more time now!  LOL!).  You can learn licks and rudiments on your own or from a sheet of music.  But without techinque, you are no where.  Tiger Bill gives you the edge on technique.  The results are what ever you want them to be.  The more you practice, WITHOUT tension, the better and faster you will get and the easier it will be.  2 years ago, I started playing again.  Now I am doing gigs, and having a great time and the rest of the band is very happy with me and my playing.  So, if you are looking to build a solid foundation to build your drumming on, you can't go wrong with Tiger Bill!",1345939200,,942,4.021621621621621
201896,5,1884263011,I find Tiger Bill's info and techniques very helpful--I've only been drumming for four years but he opens up a clear path to solid technique and confidence.,1345939200,,156,4.814814814814815
201897,5,1884263011,"I have both volumes.  The material presented is something I find myself referencing over and over again and I have been playing drums for over 45 years.  Tiger Bill really knows how to clearly explain the techniques and exercises he demonstrates on the DVD's, and he uses great analogies.  I recommended this for all levels, beginner to pro.",1345939200,,341,4.844827586206897
201898,5,1884263011,"is Tension Free. And you can achieve this by purchasing TigerBill's DVD and working through the exercises like I did. What sets this DVD apart from the others is that Tigerbill periodically 'troubleshoots' problems you may encounter, for example, he says things like 'Ok, things that could go wrong..' and he proceeds to demonstrate how a beginner or novice might play the exercise, and then shows you how to fix the problem. This is the most valuable part of the DVD because it's like having a one to one drum lesson with Tigerbill himself! No other DVD does this... trust me.. I have a large collection..

Apart from the fantastic amount of information on this DVD, Tigerbill also demonstrates each exercise with full ease and control. This to me is very inspiring because he shows you what's possible when you play Tension Free. If you really want to advance and be the best you can be, look no further... TigerBill's Concepts of Tension Free Drumming has all the answers for you. GET IT NOW!",1345939200,,995,4.718390804597701
201899,4,1884263011,"Tigerbill has meticulously explained and demonstrated drumming hand techniques on this DVD. The information is invaluable and the video footage enables you to critically compare your own technique to Tigerbill's.  The DVD is so detailed in fact, that I would not recommend sitting down and watching it from beginning to end.  For those of us who are not blessed with perfect technique, the DVD is most beneficial by biting off small chunks of the material and mastering each stage bit by bit. The DVD format is much like having Tigebill in the same room. However, some of the content I found a little cheesy and the production is definitely not up to the standard of the Hudson Music DVD catalogue. Nevertheless, this product is a great buy for the beginning drummer and anyone wishing to perfect their technique.",1345939200,,813,4.884057971014493
201900,5,1884263011,"I have both Tiger Bill's Volume 1 and 2 Tension Free Drumming DVDs. There are many times when I will purchase a dvd and it is nice to watch, but not always real informative as to how one achieves the technique. This is where Tiger Bill's dvds really are unique. He has a really great approach to breaking down the different steps and techniques and making it really easy to comprehend. Not all players are great teachers. However, Tiger Bill seems to have the touch for both playing and teaching. He helps you to understand when to use wrist, fingers and arms and how they can be combined all without causing any tension. He is also able to clearly compare his techniques with some of the leading methods and show you how to get more out of those familiar methods by using his tension free technique. If you are on a budget, which clearly during these economic times would not be unheard of, make sure that you have budgeted for purchasing these two volumes. I think it will give you a new perspective on the mechanics behind the art of drumming.",1345939200,,1046,4.481675392670157
201901,5,1884263011,"Tiger Bill has done drumming a great service.  He has gone inside the process and captured its essence regarding the best way to play.  I don't think this is opinion, but rather well articulated fact.  Bill is using direct scientific and logical thinking to show exactly how to drum with negligible/zero tension while getting fantastic results.  I bought both DVDs and have enjoyed working with his principles to see my own playing improve.  When you're playing, it's sometimes hard to recognize that you are fighting with youR drums.  Bill's method shows how to 'harmonize' with your drums.  It's loaded with lots of little useful insights.  Here's one as an example.  If you are gripping the sticks loose enough to be tension free, they will naturally move around in your hands - away from the best pivot points for best results.  Bill demonstrates exactly how to reposition your sticks 'on the fly' while you are playing so that you can maintain great results.  These little tiny things have huge impact on your overall effectiveness as a drummer.  And best of all, you get to watch him doing it, so you can easily get similar results.  I've had the DVDs for over a year and expect to be working with them for some time to come.  These DVDs are more than worth their price.  Bill shows the way, but you'll have to do the work.  At least that work will be 'tension free'.  Highly recommended!",1345939200,,1394,4.670781893004115
201902,5,1884263011,"This was a great video. It was very informative and well made. The exercises really make you think about the tension that you have when you play. Using the techniques in this video enabled me to become aware as I tensed up in my playing. As a result, I have become 'looser' in my playing thus increasing my speed and durability while playing. Highly recommended cannot wait for the foot technique video.",1346112000,,403,4.611111111111111
201903,5,1884263011,"I have been working with this DVD for a few months now and have experienced substantial improvement in speed. But perhaps more importantly my endurance has risen dramatically by using the low tension approach. Regular practice is critical, but the method is surprisingly effective. I strongly recommend this video to beginning but also more established drummers like myself. Maybe you can teach an old dog new tricks.",1346112000,,417,5.2388059701492535
201904,5,1884263011,"Look no further, this is it.
Tiger Bill is the leading authority on hand technique. If you want to play as relaxed as can be be, buy the video. My speed and stamina have increased 20 fold. I play up tempos never ever worrying about getting tense. No matter what style you are into, this will make you play with  ease and power.",1346112000,,327,4.190476190476191
201905,5,1884263011,I found the material in this DVD to be a great foundations for improving speed by removing tension from my playing. The exercises are great and I often refer back to them. I especially like how tigerbill related drumming to martial arts.,1346112000,,237,4.666666666666667
201906,5,1884263011,I really enjoyed this dvd.  It has a lot of information and ideas that you may not of thought of before.  This dvd can easily help and improve on your abilities without a doubt.,1346025600,,177,4.176470588235294
201907,5,1884263011,"I purchased this DVD the day it came out and constantly refer back to it many times. Tiger Bill is the closest thing to studying with Joe Morello as you can get. As a former student of Joe's, both Tiger and I respect the art of proper hand technique. Bill has taken Joe's technique and put his own slant on it and expanded it and and improved it. Would make Joe really proud. If you work with this method and put in the time it will work for you. Highly recommend it to all level of players.",1346025600,,491,4.072164948453608
201908,5,1884263011,"I have been playing drums a long time and even after 20 years realized that I am often too tight when I play. For that matter, so are about 95 percent of the drummers I know and watch. I am very happy to have found Tiger Bill, because his method gets to the root of what we drummers need to and CAN do to play without tension and in so doing, get to take our own individual playing to the next level and beyond.

His personality and attitudes are so upbeat that it is contagious. He generously shares his wisdom and makes the view believe that anyone can improve if they work at it and follow Tiger Bill's great examples.

I highly recommend this DVD to any drummer who is committed to improving!",1346025600,,696,4.225563909774436
201909,5,1884263011,Tension free drumming has really helped me improve my over all hand speed by teaching me to stay loose thanks bill.,1346025600,,115,4.523809523809524
201910,5,1884263011,"The title alone should make you buy the book & DVD's. You can't go wrong with this DVD. There are a lot of DVD's out there on the subject of Hand Technique.
Jojo Mayer & the late, greats Jim Chapin & Joe Morello.
Tigerbill actually states he had lessons with Jim Chapin & Joe Morello who both were big advocates of the Moeller Technique which if you do a Google search you'll find out were students of George Lawrence Stone, Author of the famous ""Stick Control for the Modern Drummer"". It's clear that Tigerbill really knows his stuff & has had lessons with Drumming's Icons to bring us some great concepts.
I am sure that as time passes this will be a prerequisite for any drummer serious about their own personal improvement in the area of Technique.
Tigerbill has a new Tension-Free-Foot-Technique book and DVD which I can't wait to personally get a copy of.",1346025600,,861,4.561290322580645
201911,5,1884263011,"Tiger Bill is a thorough and thoughtful teacher. His DVD's have helped me so much. I am getting back to playing after a 20 year hiatus where performing an ultrasound career left me with severe elbow tendonitis. I bought Tiger Bill's method before I retired and the concepts made such sense to me.  Now after 6 months rest and some healing I am apply his techniques and I can see the light at the end of the tunnel!  I play relaxed, tension free and better than I did when I was playing professionally in NYC 25 years ago. All I can say is ""Thank You Tiger Bill"" and ""This Works""!",1346025600,,579,4.254545454545455
7800849,4,1884263011,very good dvd on hand technique.highly recommented,1477526400,,50,6.285714285714286
7800850,1,1884263011,"After watching Joe Morello on You tube I thought this would provide me with some more insight to some hand techniques previously untaught or unseen.  There are plenty of ""free"" instructions on Natural Drumming based on Stone, Gladstone and Moeller.

Pretty much, other than trying to understand what Bruce Lee had to to with drumming, this left me kind of short of any new tips or instructional information

I wouldn't recommend or buy again",1399852800,,441,4.9324324324324325
7800851,3,1884263011,Tension free is explained very well did love the technique ... thought it would have more practice routines in it than it does. If you buy his book that goes with the technique may be better or use the Stick Control by Stone while practicing technique,1398297600,,251,4.478260869565218
7800852,4,1884263011,"This is obviously from my particular point of view. I am 60 & have been drumming for 44 years. I started by buying a very cheap kit in 1969, I was 17. I lived in
West Somerset UK where there is no musical tradition as such and was not encouraged by anyone ie parents or school. It never occured to me to take lessons. They would have been almost impossible to find anyway. So I learned from records, the radio & my fellow musicians. I got good by being gifted, I could drum, and keeping an open mind. I travelled and played a lot. Never with a practice regime as such, I hardly ever practiced. So now I'm getting older I find that youthful vigour is waning & my technique, or lack of it, is holding me back. Also I'm finally developing the patience to practice effectively. In my search for tutoridge I came across Tiger Bill and his method. That'll do. It's helping me immensley & I'm enjoying the process. my hand & finger technique are increasingly supporting my creativity rather than hindering it. What more can a musician ask of tuition.  Excellent. P",1386979200,,1057,4.420512820512821
7800853,5,1884263011,"This is an extremely detailed, informative and essential video.

Just about the closest thing you can get to one on live lessons. Although some have objected to the overall presentation of this DVD, these lesson chapters are FIRST CLASS. Tiger's use of two camera angles is essential for thoroughly understanding.  The information is presented in a non rushed style, very relaxed and confident.  Don't pass these Tension Free Drumming Hand Technique, Vols 1 and 2 by!

This DVD goes into important detail that i have not seen elsewhere.  I have been in and out of drumming for many more decades than i care to mention, and in all those years some very important technique things have flown by me at light speed.  I am grateful that all this seminal information is in here for me to sit down and practice.  Gladstone, Stone and Moeller are very well covered.  Mixed and matched grips as well as fingers are included.  Tiger applies his experience here as long time student of Joe Morello and his understanding of the physics and martial arts.  TigerBill got his nickname from Joe himself.

Buy this video and keep it as reference and enjoy, no matter what material you go on to. Absolutely worth it.  I will comment on Vol 2. as well. TigerBill also has a Foot Technique video on the way. [...]  Much more material on this site and a fun forum as well.

Enjoy this great material!",1349654400,,1379,4.644628099173554
7800854,5,1884263011,"This DVD is an excellent demonstration of hand technique. Bill Meligari was a student of Joe Morello, and the core of this presentation consists of the techniques of George Lawrence Stone and Billy Gladstone as they were handed down to Morello (and from thence to Meligari). Some of the topics covered are hand holds, the fulcrum point, full strokes, half strokes, low strokes, control strokes, and basic finger technique. Bill gives specific exercises that can be used to develop speed and control (many of them from Stone's book Stick Control), and he also gives an example of various practice routines that one can use in order to efficiently cover all the techniques each week.

This material is similar to the material in Joe Morello's hand technique DVDs (both the old Hot Licks DVD as well as the more recent series of DVDs that Morello did with Danny Gottlieb) as well as some of the material on Jojo Mayer's hand technique DVD, Secret Weapons for the Modern Drummer. It's also similar to the concepts presented in Dom Famularo's book, It's Your Move. This shouldn't dissuade anyone from picking up this DVD however--Meligari's presentation is very well thought out and contains information not on those other DVDs, and a perspective that is unique. I highly recommend it.",1347235200,,1280,4.953488372093023
7800855,5,1884263011,"I purchased Tiger Bill's tension free drumming video to help facilitate a change in my drumming style. Well, the video delivered above my expectations. The tension free drumming technique is easy to learn. What is really amazing is that I was also able to connect with Bill for an online video lesson to ensure that I was executing the techniques correctly. I recommend this video and any of Tiger Bill's products to all drummers that are looking to expand their style, improve their dexterity, and play with increased speed and power. Great product!!",1346457600,,551,4.935483870967742

The concepts presented really help you play effortlessly and with greater speed, power and precision. It is definitely worth the effort,
even if it means to totally relearn and redevelop your habits. Highly recommend!!",1346371200,,343,5.254545454545455
7800857,5,1884263011,"This dvd offers the most detailed look into the ergonomics of drumming I have come across.  Not only does he thoroughly explain the techniques, but also gives a lot of detailed info about common mistakes so that you can trouble shoot and hopefully self correct.  I've been looking for something comparable for a long time and come up short until I found this.  It's a great overview of many coveted techniques and (I found it more detailed and thoroughly explained than Jim Chapin and Joe Morello's videos), and provides many useful techniques for easing and avoiding tension.",1346284800,,576,4.917525773195877

Buy it, use it and learn from it....  Bill does explain and demo the techniques in straight-forward ways with two shots to simultaneously see top and side.  Drumming is a continuum and this moves it far along..",1346112000,,396,4.7101449275362315
