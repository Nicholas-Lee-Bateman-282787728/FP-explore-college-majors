8349479,3,B0021UDX7Y,did not find this dvd stimulating or refreshing...thought gardiner was a bit bored with his guests....he has other dvds that are strange and weird.,1316044800,,147,5.166666666666667
8349480,5,B0021UDX7Y,"I have always been a big fan of the unknown, UFO's, secret societies, etc. This film really went into detail and touched home on a lot of very intriguing subjects. There was never a dull moment in this film and I would recommend anyone that has a soft spot for the unexplained of the past watch this film. Two thumbs up!",1308700800,,320,4.262295081967213
