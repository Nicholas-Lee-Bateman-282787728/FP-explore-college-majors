4572409,4,B00556DYQG,"This video is definitely not for the beginners but for the advanced violinists. Otherwise, you don't know what the master was talking about./",1359072000,2,141,5.173913043478261
4572410,5,B00556DYQG,"Heifetz was the greatest violinist of the 20th Century -- maybe of all time. This DVD also gives one a picture of a musician's life during his lifetime, and what it meant then to study with a master.",1353196800,,199,4.2631578947368425
4572411,5,B00556DYQG,The film captures the meticulous preparedness of his students and also Heifetz's efforts to make the presentation even more perfect. His playing some of the same selections as his students did shows the difference between excellent and absolutely perfect.,1352592000,,255,5.564102564102564
4572412,5,B00556DYQG,"We don't have this kind of musical teacher any more even though so many people have been trying so hard to imitate him, but people just don't get that the spirit can not be copied.",1331769600,,180,4.171428571428572
4572413,1,B00556DYQG,"A warning: I bought this DVD and looked forward to receive it. But: It is not made for norwegian DVD-system (Europeen PAL system). So I was very, very disappointed. Stupid there was no warning from Amazone when I bought it.",1328918400,,223,4.6
4572414,5,B00556DYQG,"Even before viewing this DVD, Heifetz was my favorite violinist of all time. His sound, his technical command, and his expressiveness (that's right - his expressiveness) are so captivating and inspiring. This DVD made all these feelings even more true for me, and then some. The recordings are beautifully treated and the film content is just priceless. I would go as far as to say that any violinist, or perhaps even any musician should own this DVD.",1326153600,5,451,4.87012987012987
4572415,5,B00556DYQG,"I got this as a Christmas present 20 years ago in VHS format...the tapes were 60 USD each (actually I think it was 60 for the first, 30 for the second tape if you bought both.  I loved them then, I love them now, and am glad they're out on DVD for a reasonable price.  If you're seriously considering a career as a violinist, as I was then in my second year of high school, this is an important thing for you to have in your library of recordings/DVDs.  It should be mentioned that this is not a disc of stand-alone master classes.  What was filmed were several regular class sessions of Heifetz's Violin Class at University of Southern California (USC), circa 1962, with the same students attending.

Jascha Heifetz performed - and in his later years, after he'd passed his prime as a concertizing artist, Jascha Heifetz taught.  And he loved teaching.  Most of his pupils were already very advanced by the time they reached ""The Heifetz Music Class"" (his term, not mine).  Each student played, and he guided them as they put the finishing touches on whatever they were playing.  He did so in a candid, yet usually caring way.  Usually.  Heifetz was not generally known as ""a nice guy.""  It goes completely without saying that he was one of the several greatest musicians to ever walk on Planet Earth, and he expected those pursuing the violin as a career to make the most of their talent.  They also had to learn a lot of music, from Bach on up through (then) present-day composers, within the short span of time they were in his class.  For more on all of this, please read Sherry Kloss' ""Heifetz Through My Eyes"" book.  It tells the whole story.  Ayke Agus' book ""Heifetz As I Knew Him"" should be read as well.

Of this compilation of class sessions, the most frequent performer is Erick Friedman, one of the greatest violinists this country has ever produced, playing Bach, Brahms, Paganini, Franck.  He was in his early 20s at the time - although his amazing technical and musical facility make him seem much older.  He recorded the Bach Double Concerto with Heifetz in 1961; he and Heifetz play the second and third movements on this series.  Also heard are Claire Hodgkins (1929-2011), founder of the Jascha Heifetz society and later his long-time (10+ years) teaching assistant at USC; Adam Han-Gorsky, who made his career in Europe as concertmaster of several major-league orchestras; Carol Sindell, then aged 13, who became one of the finest violin teachers on the west coast; Varoujon Kodjian (1935-1993), who became a conductor; and Robert Witte - not sure what ever happened to him but he certainly played well although Heifetz sure has a few suggestions for him about the last movement of the Tchaikovsky!  Brooks Smith, Heifetz's noble accompanist for the last 15 or so years of his performing career, was also hired as his class pianist, and occasionally Heifetz even gives him instruction or comments about playing too loudly!  Also heard are two Beethoven quartet movements, performed by various class members plus the great cellist Nathaniel Rosen, before he was famous.  And of course, the collector's item, an imitation of a student auditioning with the first movement of the (now) long-forgotten Concerto #4 of Henri Vieuxtemps.  I can't say more or I will spoil it.

In retrospect, it is amazing that Heifetz allowed these films to be made.  It probably wasn't an easy process.  He was an extraordinarily private person, and revealing trade secrets was something he wisely avoided.  He was encouraged by USC and others to publicize his class, but he didn't.

Heifetz was, and is, and always will be, misunderstood.  This master class series gives a rare glimpse into what his concert audiences and loyal radio and record listeners never saw.  We hear his wisdom, and occasionally his wit here...there was a real person behind the thousands of spellbinding performances and recordings.  And it's a royal treat, let me tell you, for those of us who know the man and his art.  That being said, I wouldn't recommend it to the general public.  Other reviews of this series, what few there are, have said the same thing, and I concur.  Listening to Erick Friedman having a lesson on the Bach G minor Sonata is fascinating to those of us who *know* that music and its technical requirements.  But it's probably not something can be fully appreciated by anyone other than a violinist or other classical string player.  However, if you are, and you want to get some further insight as to one Jascha Heifetz, virtuoso-come-teacher, waste not a moment more and purchase this item.",1312243200,42,4593,4.790343074968233
8457613,4,B00556DYQG,"Oy, Mr. Heifetz the greatest violinist arguably of all time, reveals his often bizarre antics in manipulation and strictness that has me at a loss for how his students ""survived"" their lessons. Thankfully I studied for a long time with Dorothy Delay who was the exact opposite in the way she treated her students which saved my career. ( Mr Heifetzs recording of Vieuxtemp 5 and Scotch Fantasy were what caused me to fall in love with the violin among a discography so rich it is almost unimaginable, so this is in no way a comment on him as a violinist)",1434672000,,554,4.4950495049504955

8457618,5,B00556DYQG,It is always great to see this master outside the concert settings.  It made him more human and easier for us to understand.,1385942400,,124,4.391304347826087
8457619,4,B00556DYQG,"Heifetz was a genius - there's no argument about it. However he was a horrible teacher, at least from this DVD. Very cold and unapproachable. This is a good DVD that shows rare glimpes into Heifetz' teaching style and expectations he had for students.",1384905600,,251,4.7272727272727275

8457621,5,B00556DYQG,"Have seen these before, in college, but they were on film and not avalible for home study.  If you do not learn something from this,  then you should not be playing the violin",1360454400,5,175,4.2727272727272725
8457622,5,B00556DYQG,This two-disc C.D. set is a rare treasure. All serious violin students would acquire valuable first-hand information from one of the 20th. century's greatest violinists by purchasing this excellent set.,1360368000,,202,5.766666666666667
