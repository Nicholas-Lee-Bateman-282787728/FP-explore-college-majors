the storyline was great & you'll just to get your own, I'll not spoil it for you.
As for that second MUSIC DISK, As an OLD TIMER, It's not my cup of tea.",1357344000,,308,3.828125
4212963,1,B003W39FY4,"Kiosk rating less than one means you rent it at a grocery store dispenser for a dollar for these reasons:
First, standard cheap lucite monitor panels with CGI effects to make the movie seem futuristic. Very colorful and way over done for the past 20 years.
Second, other special effects of which the budget allowed only a few such as the cartoonish Jetsons flying car and holographic floating reptile and blob.
Third, actors that can list as their primary acting accomplishment the skill to read a line and robotically stand at the same time thus adding to a list in their filmography of mostly TV series/movies.
Fourth, how many times can a story about a secret government project being usurped to some foreign higher bidder be told and so unimaginably.",1318809600,,754,4.8076923076923075

4212965,5,B003W39FY4,"The bonus soundtrack turned out to be as enjoyable and actually more used by my family, than the actual movie.  The movie was very family friendly, action-packed and story line was good- really everthing I anticipated it being.  The soundtrack included was something I wasn't expecting.  I love it!!!!!!!

4212969,4,B003W39FY4,"This movie comes with an added bonus CD of the soundtrack-music.

I have to comment on the SUPER-HD video quality of the special feature segments.

The movie, itself, was very entertaining. It's a Wal*Mart Production. The acting and
production was first class. No spoilers here, but the movie keeps you on the edge
of your seat... right to the end. When it DOES end, it makes you think that this'd be
a great TV-series.
The SFX and the 5.1 surround sound was FIRST CLASS!",1431734400,3,471,4.595238095238095

4212994,4,B003W39FY4,"Full of on-your-seat adventure, special effects, and an intriguing plot best describes The Jensen Project, one of the several Walmart movies released for families.

Claire, her husband Matt, and their son Brody become part of an effort by a secret research group known as the Jensen Project to save mankind from being implanted with nanobytes. What happens when Brody is implanted with a nanobyte? Will the team succeed in their mission before it's too late?

While not my favorite of the Walmart movies (my favorite is actually Tackling the Past, which I'll be reviewing later), The Jensen Project is fun family fare that will appeal to all ages, with the exception of the very young who will likely be scared by the nonstop action/adventure scenes. There are some lessons to be learned along the way:

Brody doesn't succeed very well at following this command. He lies to get out of school and sneaks off on a mission with a Jensen Project teenage apprentice. While the movie could have done a better job at reprimanding Brody for his disobedience, The Jensen Project did a great job at showing a true-to-life family struggling with managing busy workloads and in turn putting family on the back burner. It is this depiction of not making family a priority that shows the importance of showing the ones you love most how important they are to you.

There is nothing objectionable in The Jensen Project, and I would recommend it for your next family night for ages eight and above.

I have added this movie to my mom-approved movie listing to my wordpress blog.",1369008000,8,1562,4.813432835820896

8407248,5,B003W39FY4,"Very worth getting on Blu-Ray. I'm not the type who is crazy about overly whitewashed ""family"" films, but for whatever the reason this is a decent film. I was a Walmart employee for almost 10 years, and when these movies started coming out, well, most of us at one point or another had seen them. Of all the ""Walmart Family Movie Night"" releases, I actually enjoyed this one and chose to seek it out on Blu-Ray (our particular locale carried DVD only.) Ultimately, if you enjoy sci-fi and can approach a film with an open mind, this one can be bought for cheap, it is attention holding and enjoyable, and has some awesome special effects for the lover of 1080p HD.",1439164800,,664,4.4958677685950414

8407251,4,B003W39FY4,"Let me make this perfectly clear: This movie is awful. The writing is amateurish (way too much way too fast, and I'm not convinced most kids could follow this.), the directing is uninspired (and is very clearly trying to cover for it's low budget), and the acting is beyond wooden (not one person on screen looked like they cared). Not to mention, the so-called ""hero"" isn't much of a role model or even a likable person (he's your standard ""delinquent bad boy,"" but isn't exactly relatable and someone forgot to give him a ""redemption"" arc). If you're looking for a good movie to enjoy with your kids, don't waste your money on this junk (not when there are so many good movies out there far more deserving of your time).

However, as someone who grabbed this from the discount bin out of curiosity (and had almost no idea what it was), I was thoroughly entertained the whole time. Why? Because of the ""so bad it's good"" factor. Like I said, it's horribly made, and that leaves a lot to poke fun at. For example, there's a scene when the cast goes to their MIB-style ""headquarters"" which is a very-poorly disguised hotel (no doubt whichever hotel the director was staying at), and that's not even getting into the bizarre product placement (side note: there's a scene where a doctor removes a gummy worm from a sick child's nose. make of that what you will). It's really fun to riff on.

If you're a parent looking to get a present for your kids, this movie is mostly harmless (as many of the soccer mom reviews here have indicated), but still not recommended, unless you're fine laughing and making jokes at it (which, in my experience, can make for great family bonding). It's fun to riff on, and that's all it needs to be.

Side note: no english subtitles. I know most people won't care, but it can cause problems with people talking over the movie.",1433462400,2,1853,4.558558558558558
