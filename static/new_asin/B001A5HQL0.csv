8276118,3,B001A5HQL0,"A collection of ten stories revolving around an apartment building in Mexico City over a period of thirty years.  It was a little hard for me to follow everything going on but this is the type of film that needs to be seen more than once to appreciate it.  I found it interesting.

Warning though: not for everyone.  A number of attractive women and one man remove their clothing and some of them remove everything!  The best part for me is seeing the beautiful Elpidia Carillo in one of the stories.  Alas she's just in one chapter and we don't get to see all of the lovely Elpidia if you know what I mean.

All in all it's not bad.",1439856000,,633,4.225
8276119,4,B001A5HQL0,"""Ciudad de ciegos"" (""City of the Blind"" from 1991), was directed by Alberto Cort&eacute;s. The film unfolds through a series of vignettes that takes place (in chronological order), in an apartment that was located in the old-section of Mexico City (the Federal District). Spanning over four decades, it basically recounted the struggle of Mexico's transition to modernity, as seen through the eyes of the diverse characters that represented the various social-classes. The film has some very good things going for it; with a cast that includes the wonderful: Blanca Guerra, Gabriela Roel, and Roberto Sosa, among others not very well-known outside of Mexico. The sets, costumes, and art-direction, as well as the cinematography were all done quite well. Especially for a Mexican production of the early 90's (the Mexican film industry was then in a state of chaos). If you're new to Mexican Cinema (this film is part of the new-wave of Mexican films, which is still going strong), this is actually a good start. Just about anyone can relate to these people and their stories. The film depicted sex and nudity, with an openness that was free of the hang-ups and inhibitions that is frankly ""de rigueur"" in the ""Hollywood movies"". I also highly recommend: ""Violeta"" from 1997, which was also directed by Alberto Cort&eacute;s, and also features Blanca Guerra (playing a washed-up cabaret-performer in old Havana). Venevision did an excellent job on the restoration and transfer. NTSC, Spanish (English subtitles), 1.85:1 aspect ratio, 87 mins. NR (Not Rated), which is really the way all films should be released!

Love and Peace,
