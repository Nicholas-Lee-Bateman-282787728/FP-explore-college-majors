7908912,5,B00000G3LF,"I've seen the series on TV and wanted it for my collection of submarine movies. However the outside vendor sent ""Def Jam #9"" instead. Amazon did a great job refunding my money when the vendor wouldn't respond.

The documentary is great. According to my son, who has spent his career on boomers, it is a good reflection of life on a boomer. The historical information is great too. People who like submarines would really enjoy this set - if you can find it.",1183852800,,457,4.506024096385542
7908913,5,B00000G3LF,"This is from a video series that Discovery Channel did in 1993 on the submarine service. The 6 hour series is very informative for anyone wanting to know more about this little seen part of the U.S. Navy. From  comparisions of the submarines of other navies of the world, to interviews  with the crewmembers (and their families) from the fast-attack and Trident  sub communities, the cameras go where few are able to show the average  person what this life is really like. For those out there that think  ""Hunt for Red October"" and ""Crimson Tide"" are real, you  need to see this.",954028800,10,579,4.627450980392157
