7876467,4,6304703805,"This is a sweet and tender musical melodrama that though far from being a great film, brought a tear or two to my eyes, an occasional laugh, and of course, the delight of hearing the magnificent Miguel Aceves Mejia sing.
The plot begins with the story of a woman, well played by Marga Lopez, who falls in love with a two-timing rogue (Carlos Baledon, who is excellent), her ensuing heartbreak, and the good, loving man (Miguel), who stands by her through thick and thin.
This is real soap-opera stuff, with all its twists and turns, and a warning...don't read the description on the back of the video box ! It contains ""spoilers"" and goes as far as telling you the ending.  I'm glad I didn't read it until I had seen the film. The look and sound of this is somewhat old, but I found it to be 90 minutes that were entertaining and quite lovable.",981763200,2,844,4.410256410256411
