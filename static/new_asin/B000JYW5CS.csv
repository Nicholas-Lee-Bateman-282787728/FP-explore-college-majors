8153692,2,B000JYW5CS,"I can remember when the Grim Reaper was a frightening spectre, a dark, shrouded entity forever hovering over your shoulder just itching to swing his nasty scythe and claim your soul as soon as your hourglass ran out.  He always got his man (or woman) - always.  Until now, that is.  Maybe he's gotten too old for the job (especially given the explosive population growth of modern times), maybe his heart (if he actually ever had one) is no longer in it, or maybe he's joined a labor union because the Grim Reaper who stalks the landscape of this Lionsgate 2007 straight-to-DVD release is a total slacker.  Not only does he fail to claim the souls of several individuals fated to die right on schedule, he actually needs the help of a wormy human to round these lucky survivors up in one place so that he can complete his unfinished business.

Rachel (Cherish Lee) has her number come up one night as she is walking home from work (she's a stripper - but not a very good one, seeing as how she never takes her clothes off).  It's a simple case of death by taxi -- except, she doesn't die.  Some weird dude comes out of nowhere and tells her to stay in the light.  After some more weird stuff that doesn't make much sense, Rachel wakes up in some kind of asylum, knowing that the Grim Reaper is coming for her.  As it turns out, the handful of other patients there are also Death-escapees fearing the wrath of the Grim Reaper.  Eventually, Death shows up, starts killing the patients, and that's pretty much it - apart from Rachel's medical intern boyfriend trying to find her and eventually playing a key role in the film's extremely lame ending.

This isn't the worst horror/slasher film I've ever seen, but it's pretty darn bad.  The Grim Reaper's too slow to catch a sleeping tortoise, and he couldn't scare a three year old girl on Halloween - at midnight - in the cemetery.  The acting is bad all the way across the board, the script/dialogue stinks to high heaven, and no one seems to care that large portions of the movie are utter nonsense (especially the ending).  Grim Reaper is just a horribly inept movie from start to finish.",1182902400,12,2138,4.505181347150259
