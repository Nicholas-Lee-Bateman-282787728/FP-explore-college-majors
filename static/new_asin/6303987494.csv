778533,4,6303987494,Another great 12 episode serial from the late 1940's with plenty of action and suspense.

778534,4,6303987494,"Grumpy, snarky and quick to anger, Jack Holt growls and mumbles as he goes from one fightscene after another. Though he's clearly almost 50, he takes on 4 gangsters at a time...and LOOKS LIKE HE CAN DO IT! This guy's got that leathery Charles Bronson quality about him. You know...that ""He's old, but could still kill you"" charm that makes him outclass every opponant he encounters. The cliffhangers are good and the twists and turns almost always entertain. Evelyn Brent is a tough, spunky cop in her own right. Paired with Holt as his wife (not his moll), she plays her part with zest and energy. Tristram Coffin (what a great name) plays the badguys best henchman...and it's priceless when he enters a room and sees Holt trouncing half his minions with his bare hands. Poor Tris always seems to be on the verge of screaming ""Oh, what the hell, Holt? Knock it off!""

  Just for the record, Jack Holt HATED THIS PART and you can see it in his face some times. It's like he's thinking ""Just keep plugging away, boy. Just keep saying the lines and punching the clock. It's just a roll...and it'll be over soon."", but every so often he looks like he was having fun with it.",1270771200,10,1171,4.514150943396227

At one time, Jack Holt was one of the highest paid actors of the silent screen era, and why he was shows through here. When he is on screen, you watch. Also a true fact, The writer of a famous movie detective liked Jack Holt's acting so much he patterned his detective after Jack Holt. The writer's detective was none other than Dick Tracy.

778539,4,6303987494,"VCI continues to release top-notch serial fun and entertainment with HOLT OF THE SECRET SERVICE, a 15-episode Columbia chapterplay from 1941.

Jack Holt and Evelyn Brent comprise one of the most unusual tandems of heroes in serial history, long in the tooth but also plenty long on toughness. Masquerading as ""Nick Farrel"", escaped tough guy, and his wife, Holt and Brent infiltrate a gang of counterfeiters. The setting is surprisingly widespread for a chapterplay, as the action moves from the gang's hideout in a lost canyon to a gambling ship on the high seas to a small island country where the gang hopes to escape U.S. extradition. The main villain is a fellow named Arnold, but he hides behind the facade of one of his men, Quist, to shield himself from the Secret Service, and lets another one of his men, Valden (frequent serial henchman Tris Coffin), do most of his dirty work. The island nation has its own pocket dictator, who is also trying to rub out our boy Jack.

Jack Holt is, simply put, the toughest leading man in serial history, the type of guy who could swallow nails and crap thumbtacks. When he gets in a fistfight with four of Arnold's boys and beats the hell out of the entire quartet, you can believe it.

As this is a James Horne serial, some of you might wonder about the ""comedy"" content. There is little of the funny stuff that you'll find in such Horne classics as TERRY AND THE PIRATES or THE SPIDER RETURNS, unless you count the occasional ""undercranking"" that makes everybody look like they are rushing out of a burning house, or the fact that, unlike the Republic serials in which bands were used to keep the Fedoras on during fights, Columbia apparently just instructed their actors and stuntmen to crush their hats down tightly on their heads, making everybody resemble two-fisted Buster Keatons.

I give HOLT OF THE SECRET SERVICE a solid *** and recommend it highly. It's available on DVD from a cheap company, and you get what you pay for -- the VCI release is the one to get.",1107993600,15,2018,4.644257703081233

778764,5,6303987494,"""Holt of the Secret Service"" is a 15-chapter Columbia serial released in 1941, starring Jack Holt and directed by James W. Horne.  The screenplay was by Basil Dickey, George Plympton and Wyndham Gittens.

The plot involves an attempt by the Secret Service to bust a ring of counterfeiters by having agent Jack Holt infiltrate the gang, posing as an escaped convict named Nick Farrell and aided by his ""wife,"" another agent, Kay Drew (Evelyn Brent).  The counterfeiters have abducted a government engraver, John Severn (Ray Parsons) to make plates from which counterfeit bills can be made that are almost indistinguishable from the real thing.  The plan is to catch the head of the counterfeiting ring with the plates, but Holt's identity keeps getting discovered.

While lacking the polish and pacing of Republic's serials, the writers managed to keep things stirred up pretty well for 15 chapters, and unlike many Columbia serials directed by Horne, the attempts at humor don't overwhelm the plot.  The bad guys, while not especially bright, don't seem to be trying to win a prize for bungling.  Holt gets into a lot of spurious fist fights with his supposed partners to show how tough he is, but it isn't terribly disruptive, and there aren't any ""comic relief"" characters.  Evelyn Brent does some whining, but it is well-within her role and she gets directly involved in the action.  Our heroic pair gets support from Secret Service chief John W. Malloy (C. Montague Shaw) and agent Jim Layton (Edward Hearn).  John Ward, as 'Lucky' Arnold, leader of the counterfeiters, is decidedly low-key, but he is supposed to be in the background, and has his underling Quist (Ted Adams) act as the boss.  They operate a floating casino, outside the twelve-mile limit, aiding the exchange of bogus for real money.  The counterfeit is brought in from their land-based hideout by Ed Valdin (Tristram Coffin).  There is a rival gangster, 'Crimp' Evans (Joe McGuinn) and things really get confused in the later chapters when they head to an island run by a would-be dictator named Garrity (Stanley Blystone).  Well-known 'B' and serial-movie henchmen abound, including George Chesebro, Guy Kingsford, Pierce Lyden, George Magrill, Jack Perrin, Stanley Price, Constantine Romanoff, Buddy Roosevelt and Dale Van Sickel.  That the original plan of using the plates to catch the Big Boss evolves into the more-conventional ""who's got the plates?"" routine is a little unfortunate, but the chase maintains interest, at least in the usual serial-movie dose of one chapter at a time, with a day or more between them.  Lee Zahler's musical score provides good support, more insistent than pulse-pounding, but well matched to the methodical pursuit of the gang by the Secret Service.

VCI's edition, # 8411 is on two DVD's, the first of them double-layer, needed to properly fit all 15-chapters of the serial, which run a total of 280 minutes.  While sharp enough for normal viewing, a slight softness toward the edges of the screen suggests the film source was a 16mm reduction print, and made for television since ""Screen Gems"" titles replace the usual ones advertising the next chapter.  Knox Manning's spoken ""teasers"" for the following chapters have ""Next Week"" rather noisily spliced out of them.  The image has good gray scale and is well-framed, without cutting off any of the introductory text, and is clean enough during the chapters.  While not much of a problem the opening titles have a little ""white dirt"" from the negative.  VCI used a copy-protection scheme which on some monitors may cause a slight bending at the top of the screen, though it usually isn't noticed except in the titles.  The sound is good, with only low-level background noise, though a few chapters have a small amount of flutter and, as with many old Columbia serials, minor distortion, both noticed mostly in low frequency components of the main-title music.  The dialogue is clear, with no obvious artifacts from ""noise reduction"" techniques and free of glitches due to film splices.

The ""extras"" on the first disc are ""biographies"" of Jack Holt, Evelyn Brent, Tristram Coffin, and James W. Horne, and ""Classic Cliffhangers,"" which is an advertisement for other serials available from VCI, with brief excerpts from trailers superimposed with pictures of VCI's DVD packages.  Of far more interest, disc 2 has four full serial movie trailers for Columbia serials ""The Secret Code"" (1942), Superman"" (1948), ""The Great Adventures of Captain Kidd"" (1953) and ""The Vigilante"" (1947).

This is a good serial for Columbia, with restrained humor, for once, from director James W. Horne.  VCI has done an excellent job of transferring it to DVD and making it available at a reasonable price.",1331251200,3,4749,5.077220077220077
778765,3,6303987494,"Director James Horne has a reputation among serial fans for his tongue-in-cheek approach and his illogical fight scenes, and HOLT OF THE SECRET SERVICE is probably the best-known example of Horne's devil-may-care style. Something's always happening in this one, and it's such a crazy quilt of action scenes that both the locale and the supporting players actually change about two-thirds in, and certain characters and plot points are forgotten along the way. But most of the action is firmly in the hands of rock-jawed, two-fisted Jack Holt, who makes this serial worth seeing.

Holt, the grand old man of Columbia action features since the silent days, had clashed with studio head Harry Cohn, who promptly assigned Holt to this lowbrow serial adventure. Whatever Holt's private feelings were, he gives a professional performance as a Secret Service investigator on the trail of counterfeiters. Posing as an underworld type, he delivers dialogue with a cynical smirk or a disgusted sneer, and he has to be the toughest guy in serials. You'll lose count of the fistfights Holt has during the course of his mission; he usually has to subdue four guys at a time. One of the brawls has the panache of a Popeye the Sailor cartoon, with Holt chopping each guy down with one punch and piling them up on the floor like cordwood!

Holt was no youth at the time (age 52) and required a more mature, worldly vis-a-vis instead of the usual helpless heroine. Evelyn Brent, another former silent-film star, was ideally cast as Holt's associate agent. During much of the serial they pose as man and wife, constantly bickering and backtalking, which is a refreshing change for serial heroes (and Holt even has a drunk scene!).

The supporting cast is serviceable but undistinguished; Columbia serials often feature many of its resident character actors, but not this time. The young Tristram Coffin is the only bad guy of note until the two-thirds point, when the scene shifts to a remote island and serial stalwarts Stanley Blystone, George Chesebro, and Stanley Price take over the villainy. Another silent-era Columbia player, Walter McGrail, also steps in at this point.

All in all, par for Columbia and Horne, and fun to watch. This serial is in the public domain and is available from many sources, in variable quality.
