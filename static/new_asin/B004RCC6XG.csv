8438961,2,B004RCC6XG,"After a conversation with friends at a bar about how the meaning of life is the achievement of the next orgasm, Leo's girlfriend breaks up with him for his inability to satisfy her in bed and his unwillingness to see a psychiatrist to discern the cause of his impotence.  Yeah, the sharing of laughter, the intricate bonds of being in a relationship...these are meaningless to her.  It's orgasm or nothing.

At this point, anyone would be championing for Leo to be in a relationship with someone else.  Even a guy.  So, he goes online to indulge his curiosity, meets a man who (upon arriving at his apartment) only wants meaningless intercourse.  Not wanting a replay of his latest girlfriend, Leo wisely nixes the encounter.

It is at this juncture in the film that the iceberg is struck.  A former childhood schoolmate of Leo's is introduced.  Caro, a severely depressed young woman, with whom Leo (for no apparent reason or logic) enters into a pseudo relationship.  The film at this point is stolen from Leo.  The movie that was supposed to be about a young man struggling to accept his homosexuality becomes a film about a mentally ill young woman.

The script becomes mired in awful, mind-numbing pathos.  It's not for a cause of a bad performance by the actress portraying Caro; no, she nails it, but (per the flawed script) she's nailing a train wreck of a character.  One that sucks the life out of the entire film.

The only reason this film gets two stars is for the kiss Leo shares with Sebastian, which is one of the most beautiful and passionate ever captured on film.",1420416000,,1582,4.6606498194945845
8438962,1,B004RCC6XG,"This could have been a fantastic movie if it had been about Leo instead of about Caro, the unbelievably boring, neurotic girl he latches onto so he can fix her instead of living his own life.

As others have said, Martn Rodrguez is absolutely adorable as Leo. A movie about Leo, the equally adorable Seba (Gerardo Begrez), who bends over backwards (metaphorically) to be Leo's boyfriend, Leo's fascinating but barely seen brother, and Leo's wonderful psychotherapist would have been amazing. I even liked Leo's stoner roommate. But the writer-director chose to waste 80% of his film stock by focusing almost entirely on stupid, tiresome Caro instead, which was mind-numbingly dumb.

What a wasted opportunity! One out of five stars for the 20% of this movie that is NOT about Caro.",1418601600,2,781,5.0
8438963,5,B004RCC6XG,"I noticed no on had reviewed this and so I had to say a few words. I waited a long time to see this movie and I'm not disappointed. The actors did a lovely job. Seba & Leo were lovely together! The Caro storyline dragged a bit. I would have preferred to have more resolution in the end. Though I don't doubt the protagonist's orientation as one IMDB reviewer did. That was obvious by the story. Leo was more engaged w/Seba than with anyone else. I would've liked to seen them together at the end, though it's highly likely they were.",1381536000,,533,4.287128712871287

Ordering the calculator was easy. . . have the wrong recommended part on the web site created a delay in utilizing the machine!  This was a pain in the neck!,1380672000,,251,4.413043478260869
