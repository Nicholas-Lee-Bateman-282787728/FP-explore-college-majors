I like how this Tonique works more with the arms too, I need a good arm workout. The rest of the DVD is great, plus the music is very tempo and keep me interested in the workout as well. Not to say that the workout is boring or anything but it is nice to have great music along with a great workout.

This is a workout and dance combined. There are no very detailed moves or choreographed moves. You can do your own dance with a certain workout or follow exactly how she is doing.

I have never sweated so much in my life with Tonique and I am a VERY FIT person. I have done Insanity, Turbofire, Turbojam, Core Rhythms, Figure 8 Fitness, Denise Austin, Rockin Body, The Firm,  Belly Dancing workouts, Zumba, Tae Bo Bootcamp, and so many others, so as you can see I am very fit and love to work out. I would say if you are looking for a dvd to make you sweat and lose your breath, either go with Tonique (premier, fitness sculpt or born to move) or Tae Bo.. these are the best workout dvds there are, and THEY WORK!!

5 stars for all Tonique dvds.",1369612800,,1238,4.099173553719008
