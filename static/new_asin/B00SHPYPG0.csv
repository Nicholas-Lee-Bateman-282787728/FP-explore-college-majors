6987129,5,B00SHPYPG0,this movie or series is great lab top tv watching..I love it to death..,1464220800,6,71,4.142857142857143
6987130,5,B00SHPYPG0,"This set came from Germany and was as described by the vendor. The series is great and has some very interesting and quirky characters. Unfortunately, we have only one season and there will never be another, largely because of the untimely and sad death of Michael Clarke Duncan, who is key to the show and perhaps even more of a central figure than Geoff Stults (the actual ""finder"").

We purchased the UK set (it has, to the best of my knowledge, never been release for Region 1 (North America), which is region 2. I have a multi-region player to use for watching the show, so Region 2 are no problem.",1462838400,10,603,4.4818181818181815
6987131,1,B00SHPYPG0,"I really loved this show and was clearly disappointed when I wasn't able to watch the DVD because it appears my DVD player is not set for the right region which was Europe. Would've been nice if the sellers handled the cost of the return, which was almost as much as I paid for the DVD! Lord only knows when or if I'll get my refund back.",1457308800,5,338,4.059701492537314
6987132,1,B00SHPYPG0,The description was not clear to me and now I have a DVD that I cannot play on my DVD player. And it's no use returning it since I won't be refunded the shipping and since it came from the UK I would think most of the cost was for shipping.,1456704000,3,240,3.7254901960784315

6987167,5,B00SHPYPG0,"This is a wonderful show.  The characters are the type a person can really get to love.  Leo was my favorite character in the show.  Mark Clark Duncan was a fabulous actor and his portrayal of Leo was classic.  His death leaves a giant whole in the show and in the lives of his fans.  It also means we will never know what happens to Walt and the rest of the characters.  Most of the time when there is no tying up of loose ends, I am sorry I started the show.  This is not the case with here..  I am glad I watched it.  I will write my own ending and it will be a happy one.  Thank you to Walt, Leo and the rest of the gang for a job well done.",1488240000,,645,3.746268656716418
6987168,5,B00SHPYPG0,"Love and still miss this show. It was so special. Wasted $40 purchasing the non-us version. Thanks, Hart. What is the hangup? The fan base deserves the only season. C'mon, Man. HP",1486425600,,179,4.625

6987171,5,B00SHPYPG0,Great series! Shame they only did the one season.,1477008000,2,49,4.555555555555555
6987172,5,B00SHPYPG0,"I loved this TV series, which only lasted one season before one of the three main actors unfortunately passed away, ending the show.  Pisses me off that I can only get the DVD in Region 2 format, which won't play on US DVD players, but fortunately I bought a region-free DVD player for just such treasures and can still enjoy it.  Nonetheless, this overlooked gem really deserves a US release.  Seriously!",1476316800,15,405,4.676056338028169

6987174,1,B00SHPYPG0,This DVD could only play in Asia or Australia- I wasted 20 bucks.... It would cost $20 to mail it back. I felt ripped off twice!,1471392000,,128,3.9615384615384617

8698404,5,B00SHPYPG0,I missed this series when it was first on - I discovered it I think on the Bones DVD for Season 6 - the pilot was an episode of Bones.  The one and only season was better than most series that make it past one season.  It was actually cancelled before MC Duncan passed - too bad more viewers didn't find this series to keep it on the air longer.  It is available on iTunes.,1499644800,,373,3.9466666666666668
8698405,2,B00SHPYPG0,This DVD set came in on extra thick discs and would not play in our DVD player.,1496448000,,79,3.7058823529411766
