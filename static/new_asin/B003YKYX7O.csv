4230307,1,B003YKYX7O,I was horrified for a week after seeing this movie. Who ever thought of this movie has a sick sick mind! it was one of the most disturbing movies i have ever seen. Me and my boyfriend couldn't believe really had witnessed such a sight! don't waste your money or your precious eyes and imagination!,1277251200,8,297,4.418181818181818
4230308,4,B003YKYX7O,"Splice really seemed liked it would be a sleeper hit. The sci-fi horror film has an incredible cast, it's produced by Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth director Guillermo del Toro, and early reviews were extremely positive. The insinuated enjoyment factor and entertainment value for the film were already expected to be fairly high considering the people involved and critical response. Let's just say the film is probably a bit more eccentric than you may be expecting.

Right off the bat, you'll notice the similarities between Splice and Species since they both deal with a female creature that is a result of the splicing of human DNA with something inhuman. Trying to keep this creature in a contained environment cut off from the rest of the world is really only the first half of the film. The second half is pretty unfamiliar territory.

Not many films (or any really) have been able to leave me speechless after viewing them. Splice came pretty close. The film leaves you with this inconclusive sense of indecisiveness. The story piques your interest and is able to hold onto it throughout the duration of the film while the main cast gives nothing but strong performances, but the film's content in the latter half is what will make or break your opinion of it. Obviously I'm trying to avoid spoilers, but let's just say you'll never look at Adrien Brody the same way again after seeing him in this.

Splice's strongest assets are the the fact that it's fairly unpredictable and incredibly intriguing. Once it takes that left turn at Albuquerque, its ending is a bit predictable (and open-ended). The human interaction with the CG version of Dren when she first hatches is pretty impressive though. You may be able to tell that baby Dren is CG, but the performances from Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley make it believable. Be sure to see this in the theater, as well. The reaction this film gets from a packed movie theater audience is priceless. As a last word of advice, don't expect a bloodbath. There's one bloody scene in the whole film. The rest is pretty tame when it comes to gore. Whether you like it or hate it, most can probably agree that Splice is the most unusual horror film of 2010.",1276819200,4,2201,4.741514360313316
4230309,1,B003YKYX7O,"Hands down, this has to be one of the worst sci-fi/horror movies I have ever seen.

SPLICE casually dissects a fascinating and controversial element of science--genetic engineering.  It had a fairly large budget.  A top-notch acting crew.  It was co-produced by the awesome Guillermo Del Toro.  Plus it's been praised by critics and audiences alike.  There was no way for me to expect such a horrific disaster.  Seriously, there were so many serious developments in this film that I was constantly cracking up at inappropriate times.  Some just unbelievably silly stuff.  The filmmakers had high hopes here but really created a monster turd.

The problems with this film start from the onset and just metamorphosize from there.  Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley are never too convincing as the top-notch genetic scientists.  It's not really their fault though, as this script makes them out more like underground hobo science nerds.  They drive a ramshackle 70's Gremlin and live in a cruddy apartment.  I guess with the bad economy they were forced to take their jobs making minimum wage.

So these two drastically underpaid researchers have fun splicing and dicing around in the billion dollar lab they work at.  They make an incredible medical breakthrough as they create a new life form.  The wormy creatures they conjour up look like cute little Tremors babies.  These slimy little buggers are strangely interesting, but really amount to nothing more than a scientific stepping stone.
The two genius gene doctors realize they are on the edge of something so much more.  With visions of possible cures for Alzheimer's disease or cancer, they want to incorporate human DNA into their experiments.  Unfortunately their boss shuts down this plan real quick.  So not fair.
Well, this doesn't slow the mad scientists from their medical pursuits.  Heck, it's for the benefit of mankind.  Luckily the pharmaceutical company pays little attention to their work or the resources they use.  So they buckle down for the rest of the night and are able to create a new half-human life form named Dren.  Boo-yah!  Dren rapidly develops some breasts and a lethal stinger tail, causing all sorts of unexpected problems.

I really thought this story sped through all the scientific developments way too fast, making this questionable outcome even more implausible.  The making of Dren seemed way too easy.  Not to mention the fact that keeping this mutant baby a secret was way too far-fetched.  Still, at this point the story was holding my interest.  It was not until the couple smuggle their creation out of the lab that it reaches new levels of absurdity.
Dren's new home is in an abandoned farmhouse.  Instead of running more tests on this creature, both of the doctors become emotionally attached to their project.  Hugs, kisses, dressing it(her?)up, applying makeup, teaching Dren to slow dance...it gets so dang preposterous.

I don't want to give too much away, but the nonsense here gets even more shockingly bizarre and flat-out stupid.  So many ludicrous moments, this movie derails like a bad train wreck. I couldn't help but glare at the screen with utter disgust and disbelief.  SPLICE has a very interesting premise, as it juggles scientific discovery with ethics and consequences.  I also enjoy seeing the horror genre receive critical acclaim.

But I can't hop on this goofy, deranged bandwagon.  It violates a very serious genre of sci-fi horror with unforgivable missteps.  I'm telling you, it's bad, bad, BAD!  SPLICE has high aspirations but ends up being unintentionally funny.",1276387200,13,3584,5.078902229845626
4230310,4,B003YKYX7O,"I liked the movie SPLICE, but I'm not sure I would ever recommend it to anyone.  It's a horror movie that walks very tightly on the line between irredeemably silly and truly creepy.  For me, it fell on the creepy side just enough to make it a fun experience.  But based on some of the very low audience scores I've seen, it easily falls on the laughable side for many.

It tells the story of two scientists who are a couple (Adrien Brody & Sarah Polley) who work for a big conglomerate that seeks to develop a new source of animal protein, or something like that.  They are literally developing new life forms that look like giant slugs and apparently will make for truly outstanding sources of protein.  For reasons not entirely clear and/or credible...they add just a smidge of human DNA to the recipe (without permission from anyone , of course) and end up with a hybrid that starts out as a painfully ugly creature that looks like a lumpy slug with stump legs, but eventually grows into a slender, mostly human looking female (except for the wide side eyes) that has some characteristics that aren't entirely human, nor are they entirely safe.

Modest mayhem ensues in this film that is really yet another modern update of the Frankenstein story.  In fact, the two main characters are named Clive and Elsa...could that be Colin Clive, who played the original Dr. Frankenstein and Elsa Lancaster, who played the original Bride of Frankenstein?  Regardless, Clive and Elsa are two of the most irresponsible scientists to grace a movie.  Their experimentation is reckless in the extreme (and probably pointless too).  At first, Brody is horrified by the creature his partner as spawned, and wants to destroy it and pretend none of it happened...but love and fear of his partner stop him.  Gradually, roles reverse as the creature (named ""Dren""...which is ""nerd"" backwards) develops a personality along with a strong, dangerous will of its own.

If it all sounds silly...that's because it IS very silly on paper.  But for me, the film worked to an extent by embracing the ""wrongness"" of what these two scientists were doing.  I was filled with dread at nearly every turn by the casual disregard for scientific principles and the truly yucky looking creature.  The beast was ""wrong,""...just looking at it, you knew that a thing like this was never meant to exist.

As Dren grows up and learns to express itself in more recognizable ways...we do grow to take an interest in her well-being...but only up to a point, because she has a mean streak that's rather alarming too.  And she keeps changing throughout the movie, so you really have no idea what to expect next.  Dren is a pretty cool Frankenstein monster, as it turns out.

The film also works because of Sarah Polley.  As she did for the DAWN OF THE DEAD remake, Polley brings a serious, grounded approach to her acting.  She never once appears to acknowledge the far-fetched nature of that she's doing...but she tries to act her character as though she was a super-smart, egotistical but still flesh-and-blood person, not just some screenwriter's concoction.  Her character is given some silly things to do and say, but what Polley does is emphasize the believable parts of the script, embrace the character arc she is given, and she plows through the silly stuff, making it matter far less.  Brody is fine as well...although I wouldn't say he quite brings the same gravity to his portrayal.  Sarah Polley is used far too little in films...probably because she isn't a conventional ""Hollywood beauty.""  Instead, she comes across as a real person you might actually meet.  I find that refreshing.  The movie itself is shot in a color palette that is all winter colors, adding to the grimy nature of the proceedings.

The special effects are passable but not great.  The story has a conventional, even predictable ending scene that steals a lot of its impact.  But faults aside, I also found I could not look away from the compellingly icky SPLICE.",1276128000,4,4002,4.798540145985402
4230311,5,B003YKYX7O,"Vinceno Natali director of Cube & Cypher, and executive producer Guilermo Del Toro bring us an updated tale of Frankenstein.
The even more ""Modern Prometheus"" so to speak.
Starring Adrian Brody (The Jacket, King Kong, etc.) as Clive & Sarah Polly (Dawn of the Dead) as Elsa - 2 awful scientists & even worse parents.
Anywho; don't expect much in the way of horror, unless of course you're a parent, in which case expect lots!
It was certainly more sci-fi, which is fine by me.
The creature effects (both adorable at times, sexual at others, but always a wonder to behold) were phenomenal!!
The creme de la creme!!
Dare I say; the best I've seen since Carpenter's ""The Thing"".
But the gore was almost non-existent.
I would have liked to have seen more about the way Dren (nerd spelled backwards) hunted,
and more use of its abilities: like it's amphibious lungs, it's wings, it's scorpion-like tail, and its Kermit the frog eyes -
though I must admit, I did love it's evolution into each stage.
What started out as a worm, turned into a rabbit, turned into a child, turned into a rebellious blossoming teenage creature hell bent on sex & destruction - all at an accelerated rate.
Every instance it was on the brink of death it evolved into something even more marvelous.
Definitely akin to Frankenstein with the exception that Dr. Frankenstein never used a piece of himself in his creation,
well that and and the good doctor never got busy with his monster.
Can you imagine??
Adrian Brody what were you thinking?

Here's the skinny:
A couple (both unscientific scientists) with the worst parenting abilities ever,
(thank god they decided against having children)
in an effort to discover, I don't know what, a protein of some nature?
It's hard to tell because everything is referred to as combinations of numbers & letters,
Well they create two tumor-looking worm sacks,
cute worm sacks - the type you want to hug, and then drop on the floor & stomp.
But they get overly ambitious, and behind all their colleagues backs create a being with the genetic properties of multiple species,
(including Elsa's) named Dren.
But Dren keeps growing, & evolving eventually beyond their control,
and like any teenager, she becomes as rebellious as her parents.
So they have to move Dren into Elsa's childhood home...
an abandoned farmhouse,
a very uncontrolled environment, where they try to raise it as a child instead of an experiment.

To say the least, I loved this movie!!
It had its flaws (as does every flick),
It lagged in the middle, like a computer laden with internet porn,
but it was always a sight to behold even at the slow parts.
It's an absolute must-see for sci-fi horror fans.
It was like InAlienable except a zillion times better.
For fans - have no fear... there will almost certainly be a sequel.
Hooray for me!! Hooray for you!!

**WARNING**
If violence toward animals bothers you,
there is one scene where an animal of a certain cuddly variety is killed, rather quickly & violently.
And for those that hate rape... well there's some of that as well.

4230312,4,B003YKYX7O,"The study of Nature makes a man at last as remorseless as Nature.
- An excerpt from ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" by H.G. Wells

The problem is, lovers and genetic scientists Clive and Elsa (Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley) don't know this. At least, they don't know this at first. Just like Dr. Moreau, it's all in the name of scientific progress and the belief that it will somehow benefit humanity. Their methods are, initially, totally objective; by splicing together the DNA of various animals, they create entirely new hybrid species, hoping to extract a gene that would provide protein and other necessary components for the sick and dying. They succeed, although they would like to go one step further and experiment with human DNA. Their company, while successful, will not provide any more funding, for Clive and Elsa's other hybrids are developing quickly enough to be marketed as visionary products of scientific research.

Not content with being held back, Elsa secretly introduces some human DNA into an assortment of other genes. Clive is wary; not only are they breaking the rules of the company, they're also toying with a host of ethical issues. Elsa remains confident. After all, she doesn't want to bring the new species to term. She just wants to see if it can be done. The thing is, the new life form grows at an advanced rate and emerges before it can be terminated. It's a strange although not altogether unlikeable creature, a female with a bulbous head and spindly legs and a tail. Elsa takes a liking to her immediately and names her Dren, which is the reverse of ""nerd,"" in this case not a putdown but an acronym for the name of their genetic corporation. Clive thinks it was a gigantic mistake. Regardless, they have essentially become parents, and they do whatever they can to keep Dren safe from prying eyes.

The greatest achievement of ""Splice"" is that, up until the ending, director Vincenzo Natali was ambitious enough to make it be more than a mere thriller. It's an absorbing blend of science fiction and philosophy, forcing both the characters and the audience into a number of thought provoking moral quandaries. Like Wells' ""Dr. Moreau,"" it intelligently raises concern over the pursuit of scientific progress while at the same time begging the question of what distinguishes animals from humans, if indeed there is anything to distinguish. In a matter of months, Dren evolves from a child (Abigail Chu) into full maturity (Delphine Chaneac); although she becomes progressively more humanoid in appearance, she has very clear animalistic tendencies, some of which are quite dangerous. And yet, her emotional development is much the same as that of a human girl - curious about what her ""parents"" forbid, mindful of her changing appearance, and, most interestingly, becoming aware of her sexuality.

The film also presents us with a look at Clive and Elsa, who seem caught in that unendurable gray zone between cold analysis and emotional attachment. Elsa is especially fascinating, drawn to the methodical and objective nature of science but also harboring deep-seeded maternal instincts, in large part because her own mother didn't seem to possess any. Did she grow to love what started out as a cloning experiment, or did she deliberately create Dren for reasons other than scientific advancement? If it's the former, did she honestly believe anything different would happen? If it's the latter, what did she hope to get out of it emotionally and how did she think it would work? As for Clive, his reluctance belies a curious connection with Dren, one that may seem reprehensible but, given his relationship with Elsa, is also somehow justifiable.

Considering how compelling most of the movie is, it's a shame Natali opted for such a generic climax, the morally challenging aspects disregarded in favor of a routine monster-movie showdown. I can't help but wonder if there's an alternate ending strewn amongst the scraps on the cutting room floor, for it's hard to believe that a conclusion this manufactured was what the filmmakers had in mind. Up until then, we were actually being tested. We were actively engaging in a stimulating cinematic debate. I will admit that there's a satisfying air of mystery in the final shot, one that proves Wells' point: The study of Nature makes a man (or a woman) at last as remorseless as Nature. Still, the scene is hardly worthy of the events leading up to it, which are so well done that I simply can't look past them. In spite of the disappointing final act, ""Splice"" is an above average science fiction film, strong in character and tone, gripping in plot, and stimulating as a study of ethics.",1275609600,7,4675,4.920152091254753
4230313,4,B003YKYX7O,"The premise of Splice is pretty simple. Two scientists looking for a cure to mankind's most horrid diseases, mix human DNA in their splicing of animal genes. Instead of killing their creation, they decide to raise it. Then the you know what hits the fan. It's basically a better version of the the film Species. I know one features a really hot alien from space and this creature is created in the lab, but it has that same sexy vibe. You can tell the director, Vincenzo Natali, who also directed the cult favorite, Cube, really tried to make the audience feel uncomfortable with a few really twisted scenes. I was expecting something a little more shocking after reading some reviews, but perhaps watching Spartacus: Blood and Sand has left little room for surprise, at least for me.

The movie relies on three performances and they are all very good. Other than the fact I find Adrien Brody hard to look at, he and Sarah Polley play the roles so seriously, you can't help but believe every word they say. There are a few situations where they do typical dumb things, but the dialogue and acting were believable most of the time. The creature named Dren, which looks more human than animal and ages rapidly, is a fantastic design. The early stages of it's life are all done with CGI, which is the least convincing, but once it hits the teen years, Delphine Chanac, takes over and really breathes some life into the character. Dren has odd shaped hands, legs and feet, no hair, communicates by squeaking, sprouts wings at will, has a long tail with a sharp tip, and has eyes set as far apart as possible while still remaining on the front of her face. Oh, and her name is nerd spelled backwards.

The gore is really kept to a minimum. I thought there would be a little more red being thrown around than what you would see in a PG-13 movie. I won't spoil it, but there is a very weird sex scene and even a quick scene of rape towards the end, that got this film an R rating, along with the language. There was more violence and gore in Drag Me to Hell. I also didn't like the last 15 minutes that much. It felt a little rushed and turned into nothing more than a typical creature feature.

Splice is not a great horror film, but it's a pretty good one, that shouldn't be missed once it hits Blu-ray.

Turns out this cute little bugger is a genetic experiment to merge the DNA of, well...everything...into one wriggling rather repugnant mass ...because why not go for that whole preposterous tamale? Equal parts fish, insect, mammal, reptile, bird, uh plant? Etc. etc. The motivation for this approach is never made fully clear, beyond perhaps the old ""because we could"" as much as an irresponsible warm up act for what follows. So, this is what I'm in for, I thought. I was indeed in for it with almost no hype exposure or preconceived notions, seeing it freshly released in theaters. Splice may manage to reel you in if you are not too turned off by regular silly psuedo-scientific/morality platitudes. We span the absurd to the obscene, hovering over obligatory questions of immorality as most often ignored...ignorantly. If you can abide the flights of ridiculous, to get to the point, there does emerge one. If not particularly original, since the cultural appearance of Frankenstein anyway, but it takes a few fresh turns for suspenseful moments along the way. I'd say it's worth the trip, which had me scratching me scratching and shaking my head in equal measure. With an inventive take on a monster morality tale (with a tail) as it relates directly, personally, and literally to genetic tomfoolery. It's imaginative if occasionally fumbling on the themes it endeavors to present. The plainly inevitable and equally bizarre resulting monstrosity is worth getting to...if just to get there. In short, a bit of bio engineering paranoia that trades most of it's deeper meaningful impact for shocker style retelling of a well worn theme...mess around with mother nature too much and she might get...really weird.",1453939200,3,2012,5.155963302752293

4230381,4,B003YKYX7O,"Splice

 This is the most disturbing film I have seen since Eraserhead.  Splice is even more disturbing because it involves serious moral questions about science, society and the boundaries that allow us all to live in some reasonable semblance of harmony.  The boundaries of our social structures and the limits of science are horrifyingly breached repeatedly.  It turns out that we need the boundaries to define not just our space but who we are as sentient beings.  It is also brilliantly crafted as a suspense tale and produced to the highest standards of the Hollywood magic machine.  Like great literature, it is the more disturbing for the excellence of the effort.
 Low wattage actor Adrien Brody (The Pianist and more than twenty other films) will be a vaguely familiar face as might be his co-star Sarah Polley, an actress in some eighteen feature films.  The true leading actor is the ever evolving creature, a mixture of the DNA of the Pollely character and the DNA of various animals.  The two smashingly intelligent scientists grow the creature in a lab and then try to raise it in their home.  The creature turns out to be all too close to being human and all to close to being an extremely dangerous wild thing, a wild thing like no other on earth.
 The usual Frankenstein cravats, about science meddling where it shouldnt, hold in this case, and in spades.  There are additional taboos that are violated as well.  This is almost front page news in this brave new world that we inhabit.  Gene splicing will be here soon if it isn't already in some lab in North Korea.  Cloning is now old news.  Can gene splicing be far behind?
 Writer-Director Vincenzo Natali has carefully built a film that is tense and suspenseful from the beginning.  We await the certain doom of the husband and wife science geniuses but with each turn things get both more intense and ickier.  Icky as in Im not sure I wanted to see that.  His previous film was Cube, a Sci-fy psychological mystery from some years ago.  This is his first time with a big budget and he proved himself.
 This R rated film is not for the faint of heart, and not for youngsters at all.  There is nudity, disturbing violence and very adult subject matter.  Truly, our science has outstripped our ability as a culture to cope with the new techniques.  This film rates four saw blades and a dose of Dramamine.",1443484800,,2375,4.649038461538462

Also of note is what Jesus said that, as in the Days of Noah so it will be when Jesus returns. In other words, we may be on the verge of witnessing a rebirth of human hybrids.

The main characters, Clive & Elsa, create new species of animals by splicing DNA from various earth animals.  After successful splicing, they add human DNA and create a humanoid animal that they name Dren (Nerd spelled backwards).  At first Dren looks like a hybrid of frog and kangaroo, but as the days go by (it grows expediently) it begins to look more and more human.  At full growth it wants what all human adults want and there lies the problem since it should not exist to begin with.  In the end all I can say about this flick is that although the plot runs along the line of the movie ""Species"" it does a much better job at being disliked.  I enjoyed the movie ""Species"" (just the first one, sequels were okay) and this one seemed like it wanted to be in the same category, but failed miserably to deliver the nightmare the movie description says it should.

Poor Clive was helpless to Dren's feminine charms, leaving Elsa to figure out what to do with this strange creature of their creation.

Clive and Elsa seemed more like first-time pet owners than scientists in this wild romp on the dark side of bio-engineering, creating a mutant spliced from their own DNA.  Such genetic experiments do pose many ethical concerns, not least of all fidelity in this case, but this film blithely skirted by such issues and sought to make a thriller out of the story in the spirit of Dr. Moreau.

This film is shocking, controversial and will certainly put some viewers off with its themes of blasphemy, bestiality, incest and rape!

My complaints all are on the scriptwriter and producers. WHY? JUST WHY incest? Throwing in bestiality doesn't help.

The other reviewers are describing this film in three acts. I agree, it is a great way to describe the film.

First off: the actors are decent and the character designs/costumes were good.

Act One: Can science go too far? What if we splice human DNA? Can we cure humanity? These scientists are discreetly breaking ethical rules to achieve results. Some social commentary, but the story is building. Fascinating, good story, despite what others are complaining, I did like the special effects. Camera style....uh...reminded me a little of TV. Lighting and coloring made up for that.

Act Two: Sets up for the final act. The good thing about the scriptwriter is that he prepares the audience for what's coming...it's just hard to believe it when it happens in act three. Creature also becomes more human here.

Act Three: Bad choices are made by both humans and creature. Very bad choices. Scriptwriter went too far in my opinion. At least he sort of warns you...a little bit in act two...This is a little too raw and dark. At least the violence is there but not at Quintin Terrentino levels. I'll give them that. If that had been added on top of everything else, yeah, it would have been a splatter/shock film.

What if Dr. Frankenstein had created an androgynous creature that was at one moment a captivating and love-struck female, and at the next a hideous and vindictive monster?

Spoilers

Many issues and themes here. Using animals for scientific experiments, as though we somehow had the right to cause them suffering without any regard for them, and if you think of the Nazi's, experiments on humans as well. The concept that because science combines dna to 'create' something which is different somehow makes them 'owners' of the result. This goes to issues of animals and human beings being seen as property.

Also we see the dynamics of dysfunctional parents, the 'Mother' being VERY screwed up. The scene where she straps down her 'daughter' and cuts off part of her tail was sadistic and reminded me of child abuse.

When the creature was just, er, 'born', the disregard they gave her discomfort and pain was astounding, and by what right do they feel they can just kill her if they choose to?

After all, genetic manipulation does not mean that you have 'created' life, only manipulated elements to change some things.

Then we have the usual warnings against scientists who go to far and suffer the consequences.

And it was so sad when the creature was finally outside, ready to spread her wings and fly-but her 'Dad' pulled her back by saying he loved her. These 'parents' were not capable of looking out for her welfare. And what possible kind of life could she have?

Very interesting. I thought the ending didn't make sense-but they were maybe thinking about making a sequel.",1395878400,,1476,4.8063241106719365

4230507,5,B003YKYX7O,"Unlike most people who have seen this film, I had a different impression of this film. Most people were disappointed after they had seen this film, because the previews were misleading. The previews made it seem like it was going to be a horror science fiction film, where, in actuality, this film mostly focused on the experiment that two scientists played by Adrien Brody(Clive) and Sarah Polly(Elsa) did. The experiment had to do with splicing human DNA with this creature that they had made. As a result, a creature is born from this experiment which they name Dren ( Delphine Chaneac).
As far as the acting, I thought that Delphine Chaneac stole the show playing Dren. She really did a great job portraying Drens character. Adrien Brody comes in second when it comes to acting quality is this film, and Sarah Polly comes in third.
They did a superb job with the makeup and special effects with Drens character. They made the creature look extremely believable. The creatures body was well proportioned considering that it was made from an amphibian, insect, bird, fish, and human.
The context of this film certainly kept my interest. Although the beginning was a bit slow, it certainly picks up its pace later on. The film mostly focuses on the content of the experiment which takes a different turn for Clive and Elsa. They also touch a little bit on Clive and Elsas' relationship and their personalities. Therefore, there is a little bit of focus on psychology of the human behavior and condition. However, just when you think , you have it all figured out, the story takes a different turn. All I have to say is have an open mind and expect the unexpected.
Warning to all of the conservative viewers: This movie might be a bit disturbing for you.

So here's the deal..

Two scientist are wanting to help mankind through genetic manipulation, of course they work for an evil corporation that doesn't want any part of this, mainly because ""bad press""... But also one of the scientist on the team has other motives, which you will get to see unfold. I guess you'd call it a plot twist.
The corp head (I assume) tell's them that their lab is going to be re-tooled, and set up to find these genes, out of these.. mutated silk worms, that they have created.

Yadda Yadda.

Long story short, this is a movie made in America. If anything can go bad, its going to go bad, because apparently in America we love bad news?.. so right their is the rest of your movie.

It always amazes me, how technology and the awesome possibilities that exist... always get slathered over with crap and blood. I don't know what it is. I guess the directors who make these scifi movies, maybe its the investor that push on the stories? thinks that we don't want to see the awesome future that could possibly happen with all this tech..heck maybe they can't envision a better non cliche ending? Instead its ""bad bad bad ur creation gonna kill you"" or some such stuff. They're stuck in these ""Genres"".. oh its scifi, and horror... couldn't possibly be scfi and horror, yet turns out to be awesome?

If you see a new scifi movie come out of hollywood, 9 out of 10, you can just guess ""Hey this movie is going to end up in disaster and show us how horrible tech is"" and you'll be right. I've been watching scifi movies since I was a kid.. and I know their are a few movies that go a different direction but over all this cliche of ""tech and science is horrible and aliens are horrible and are going to kill you""... is a long lasting trend. (Glad Firefly and StarTrek exist..)

The movie over all has a pace that will keep you on your feet. Even if you have ADD... because things are just moving so quickly.. and the scenes jump about.  Watch it if you don't want to be bored. It's not gory.. or anything like that, the whole movie trys to keep you in ""Suspense""",1384560000,,2185,4.338235294117647

4230518,2,B003YKYX7O,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I decided to give this a view, only that it was going to be some kind of sci fi movie that had to do, by the obvious title, with genetic engineering.  Brody and Polley are two scientists at NERD (no it really is called that) who are working on an experiment having to do with genetics.  After literally splicing all sorts of DNA under microscopes and growing them in petri dishes, a new creature is made.  After their experiements with the two worm protoypes, Fred and Ginger, go horribly wrong, they end up with some other creature thing which Polley names Dren.  Attempting to keep her existence and her rapid growth a secret from others, she is hidden in an abandoned barn while Brody and Polley fight over the morality and legality of their creation.  It turns into kind of a humanoid thing with occasional wings and a stinger tail, and they're not quite sure what to do with it.  And, inevitably, things will go horribly wrong.

It's the same kind of Frankenstein story that's been around for the last two hundred years or so in literature as well as movies, the ending was predictable.  That one scene (and you'll know which one I'm talking about with Brody and Dren) is disturbing, but not quite as disturbing as those of Species I or II.

4230525,3,B003YKYX7O,"I thought it was unusual finding Adrien Brody in this sci-fi movie, and after watching it, I was certain he'd been miscast. His was the only familiar face; I think this was a Canadian production.  His character (Clive) and his girlfriend (Elsa), who is played pretty well by actress Sarah Polley are genetic engineers involved in splicing DNA. I don't remember the movie actually saying why they were doing this, but they manage to create two living creatures that resemble a moving armfull of humongously lumpy loaf of bread, one male and the other female.  Elsa spills it to the CEO about being able to harvest proteins from these creatures that will lead to cures for many previously incurable diseases.  This is a drug company they work for with a name I assume is an acronym, NERD. Secretly, Clive and Elsa are also working on creating some life form whose genetic structure doesn't take hold until Elsa quietly slips a sample of her own DNA into the mix. It works, and the little lump starts growing. Meanwhile the two main creatures, named Ginger and Fred have grown, bonded and all seems well, but it's not really noticed that Ginger is slowly turning into a male. During a company presentation of Ginger and Fred to a room filled with a lot of important people I assume, unbeknownst to anyone, Ginger has become completely male.  When the partition between the two is removed, a sharp fang extends out of their ""mouths"" and the two duke it out.  Instead of the audience seeing Fred and Ginger get it on (I guess), they use their fangs to rip each other to pieces.  Blood splashes everywhere and the violence of the fight causes the big glass case they're in to tip over toward the audience. The glass shatters and those who didn't have sense enough to get up and leave, which is all of them, are showered with blood and broken glass.

Clive and Elsa are obviously in major trouble for the fiasco.  But their own little experiment, spurred on by Elsa has produced a fast growing sort of human child with no hair, eyes on each side of her head, and instead of normal legs, she has chicken legs from the knees down.  I knew the legs were CG, but I couldn't figure out the eyes. They looked like normal human eyes and she had to turn her head one way or the other to see.  She also has a tail with a long, sharp hook which was initially kept covered up.  Clive's younger brother who also works at the drug company, is very nosey and very curious as to what Clive and Elsa are doing. He breaks into their lab, and is knocked down by Dren, which is Nerd spelled backwards. The younger brother whose name I don't recall tells Clive that Dren has to go because they have to vacate the premises, and only work in their regular lab.  As they argue about where to go, whose fault everything is, Elsa is comforting Dren (Delphine Chaneac) who is now fully grown.  She still owns the farm where she grew up, so Dren is taken there and housed in the barn. Dren shows remarkable intelligence, but is bored having to stay inside all the time.  She breaks through the glass on the roof, and as Elsa and Clive beg her to come down, Dren has moved to the edge of the roof and nearly falls off, but suddenly sprouts wings. The next time she gets out is after a fight with Elsa, who has been showing little patience with Dren's escapades. While Elsa is on the floor, Dren covers her and with her hooked tail, removes the chain around Elsa's neck that has the key.  It's a sunny day and when Dren steps out, she's all smiles at being free at last.  Elsa sneaks up behind her with a shovel, and clobbers her on the head, knocking her unconscious.

When Clive comes home and walks into the barn, he sees Dren stretched out naked on a table with her arms and feet tied down.  On the end of her tail is a bloody bandage; Elsa has cut it off because of the danger it poses. Clive wants to know what's going on, and Elsa, no longer the loving mother figure, tells him that Dren has become too dangerous. She leaves the barn, and Clive covers Dren up, who's obviously in pain and comforts her.

I don't want to spoil the ending, other than to say these scientists have a bad habit of not watching what they're doing, and they don't seem to learn from their mistakes. I don't know if I'd recommend this movie.  I liked it, but sometimes I'm very easy to please. After seeing Dren as a toddler, I wanted to see the extras included in the DVD.  As suspected, whenever the grown Dren was on screen, she was wearing blue screen stockings that extended over her knees. Blue and green screen are used whenever CG is involved. But nothing was ever said about the child who played Dren as a toddler.  If anyone knows, please tell me.",1370736000,,4704,4.401384083044983

4230528,4,B003YKYX7O,"The movies that get made are about 99% the same. I don't mean Star Wars == Fight Club, but Star Wars is very much a Samurai flick and Fight Club's twist has been so overdone for a while I dreaded watching thrillers. It all comes down to formula, and there are a few, which is probably more evident to me as I was just trying to find a generally known film to name against Star Wars that doesn't share the same features.

This is a film that doesn't operate solely on what you see, rather it is based on the characters' character. Their ego is played against their flaws and their identity against their desires. The two main characters are Clive and Elsa, both highly regarded scientists working on (or in fact beyond) the forefront of their field which is genetic engineering. For reasons that are never fully explained (though heavily implied) they create a genetic sequence including human DNA, which clearly is a taboo issue. Things play out as they must for this to get started and although you constantly expect at least Clive to do the right (necessary) thing, this is a 104 minute film, and because you saw the trailers, you know he's not going to.

The first hour of the movie is generally tense as you don't know how things are going to evolve and you are constantly expecting something to go terribly wrong and it does, but you'll have to watch it. This is all very skillfully done and if you've seen Natali's earlier movie Cube, it follows a very similar development arc.

After that hour a lot of things become quite clear, and then there is the finale, and that's an experience onto itself.

What makes Splice special are a few things:
1) The characters feel alive. I don't mean they are well acted (which they are) but rather that they have an existence outside the movie plot itself. This doesn't feel like it is a gimmick (and it should not be anyway) but works in well with the story.
2) The movie doesn't linger, instead it constantly progresses through what it is trying to convey. At no point do you feel it is spending time on something, rather it does what it needs to without outstaying its welcome.
3) It is topical without being preachy, it does make some statements about corporate motives and such, but as already mentioned it doesn't linger, and when it makes them, it is in the context of the story. As for the evils of genetic engineering, that doesn't float as a topic, rather it is about the human element in this.
4) At no point do you feel that science is being manipulated / simplified to fit the story, the way I find grating when IT is portrayed. That said, I don't know about genetic engineering and scientists might cringe, though what's shown on screen presents a good visual analogue for what is happening. Sure, it is simplified, but it doesn't feel dreadfully so. More importantly though, the science is part of the setting rather than the plot, and the story is about human factors more than science. It should be mentioned here, IF it were about cold, hard and unfeeling science, this probably would not play out as it does, but no one wants to see that movie.

So let's look at the flaws. The movie is not for everyone, there is nothing I can point to as being ""bad"", except some hollow statements about Dren's visual evolution, and the Elsa character being entirely unlikeable, some of it will make sense in the long run, but some facets are not explained especially one statement Clive makes which really left me hanging. My main problem is the ethics are too blatantly ignored. Essentially, the plot is just a little too convenient to get started, though once again without this there would be no film.

In conclusion, this is a creature horror flick, that feels intense pretty much all the way through. It works on a few levels, with things that are happening existing in a whole world rather than just the movie. There are no ""convenient"" surprises, and you will consider some of the facets for a while. If you can take the tension and want something that will give you something to think about, this is a movie to try.",1368835200,2,4071,4.539509536784741

Little do they expect that the growth of this thing would be much faster then they calculated, and something new is brought into the world.

They decide not to kill it, and raise it, without anyone knowing, and it almost becomes like a child to them, until it reaches an age where it just does not want to be locked indoors anymore and it's primal instincts begins to kick in, as well as it's hormones.

This is not the movie I thought it was going to be. When I saw the trailer, I thought it was going to be something like a genetic mutation that looks cute at first, till it goes nut-so. In ways, it is... but not in the way you expect judging from the trailer. It takes a while for any action or suspense to kick in, and by the end, I thought, this is not really what I expected, and that's kind of a disappointment. With the way this movie ended, it made me wonder why they just didn't hurry up and get to what this thing can do, and really play more on shining a spotlight on that, instead of it being over and done so quick with a predictable last 2 minutes of the film to lower the adrenalin so much you walk away yawing.

4230556,3,B003YKYX7O,"I rather liked most of this film, with the exception of last 10 minutes, which were very weak and disappointing.

I believe that it is hardly a SPOILER to say, that this film is basically about two genetists, Clive (Adrien Brody) and Elsa (Sarah Polley), colleagues, friends and lovers, who, after facing budget cuts decide to make an illegal experiment, by cloning a chimera made of a mixture of DNA from a human, animals and the DNA of a Genetically Modified Organism (GMO), a kind of huge worm, which they earlier (legally) created. The result of this illegal experiment will be a facinating quasi-human intelligent creature, a little girl, which with time, for reasons you have to discover yourself, they will call Dren (Delphine Chaneac). Some more limited SPOILERS ahead.

Maybe it is because I have myself two young children, but rather than the SciFi elements I immediately rather focused on the child they brought to the world and what would become of her. Because they are afraid of consequences and still not certain if they will allow Dren to even live, Clive and Elsa hide her - and therefore ipso facto they keep her prisoner. Therefore, as far as my personal perception is concerned, this film is mostly about a little girl who was denied her childhood and who suffers for a extended period continuous abuse from her ""parents"" - or maybe rather should we call them her ""abductors""?

This is a sad film and a sad story and although Clive and Elsa try to bring some light into Dren's life, she nevertheless still lives in a prison, locked and watched by her gaolers. Being different from humans, she grows fast and as she enters the adolescence, she finally starts to rebel - as all adolescents do. And because of what she is, she has tools to rebel as no other adolescents have...

This film is also a kind of study in double, mutual entrapment, because exactly as Dren is being kept under lock by her ""parents"", they are also stuck with her... Vincenzo Natali, who earlier made the quite impressive ""Cube"", leads this story very skillfully for almost the whole duration of the film and he rather intelligently describes Dren's late teens rebellion until a breaking point is reached and she severs her emotional links first with her ""mother"" and then, even more radically, with her ""father"". This liberation and coming of age (showed in a very Freudian scene between Dren and Clive) is quite beautifully symbolized by her deploying of wings... This final rebellion is also a punishment inflicted to both Clive and Elsa for their cowardly failure to provide the necessary love and care to the child they brought into this world...

Sadly, at that moment the director took the film in the completely wrong direction and as the result, what could be a very honest SciFi philosphical tale, crashed and exploded in flames. The last 10 minutes of the film are horribly bad and do not make the slightest sense, at least as far as my personal taste is concerned. This is the reason, why I think this film desserves only three stars.

But still, I do not regret that I watched it, as it has many touching moments and for most of its duration it is quite good. And it certainly touched me and made me think many times since about this little strange looking girl with a tail, living her sad, lonely existence locked in basements and barns.

4230561,3,B003YKYX7O,"There's not a breathtaking amount of originality to Splice, but it is an otherwise solid little sci-fi horror with no real lasting appeal. It's very similar to the incredibly stupid 1995 movie Species as well as having many shades of Guillermo Del Toro's Mimic (Del Toro served as producer on this film too) but plays it straight enough for it to be taken seriously in its own right.

Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley play scientists/lovers working for a pharmaceutical company hoping to find cures for various diseases by splicing human DNA with that of various other creatures. They eventually create Dren, a female born from a fake uterus who initially looks like a blind, hairless rabbit. She soon grows arms and eyes and resembles a little girl, quickly after that she looks like a young woman and is treated mostly as a human, mostly.

What bothered me about the film is that Dren is frequently treated pretty badly. She cannot talk, instead relying on squeaks and facial expressions, and should be treated like the newborn she actually is. But the pretty poor scientists who created her really ought to be charged with animal/human cruelty. If repeatedly slapping a bad dog with a newspaper creates an unstable animal...

Splice doesn't really have many tricks up its sleeve. Vincenzo Natali plays the dead/not dead card way too many times and never really lets us into the mind of Dren. When the movie isn't trying to be a horror its an interesting study of the would-be human development of Dren and the emotions she provokes from those around her. In the end, neither genre defines the film and, like Dren herself, it ends up being a hodge-podge of half-baked ideas.

----------------------------------------

**Brief Review**

I am a huge fan of science.  Saying that I do feel that there are things that should be left alone.  We are just not advanced enough to know the ramifications of all our actions.  As we are still children we should for the time being leave certain things alone.  Amoung these are messing with things that nature has already painstakingly engineered for us.

'Splice' is a classic tale of scientists going too far.

**Movie Details/Some Spoilers Ahead**

The movie centers around two genetic engineers, played by Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley.  They make designer animals.  Animals spliced together from plants, mammals, fish, etc.  They produce species never seen on this planet.  Why are they doing this?  The movie is kind of vague on this, (at least to me), something about harvesting unique proteins or something...

Well, Sarah Polley's character is not content just making weird animals and has a strong desire to make a human/animal hybrid.  Brody is apprehensive at first, but after some sensual coaxing by Polley he relents.  By the way, it's illegal to do this.

Things are BAD from the start.  The fetus matures in the artificial womb way too fast.  Upon it's violent birth it nearly kills Sarah Polley.  This creature has a wicked stinger that delivers a powerful poison.  Personally I think that would have been a fine time to throw this thing into the furnace, but they keep it alive for some reason.  It matures fast and keeps changing in appearance, becoming more and more human ""looking"" each day, but still a monster none-the-less.

This creature dubbed ""Dren"" is quite a fascinating creature.  She has wings, can breath under water, and has a long prehensile tail barbed with a powerful toxin delivering stinger.  She's a predator to say the least...

Long story short, the 2 doctors have to sneak her out to an abandoned farm house and try in desperation to contain her there.  Of course things never go as planned...

--Summing Up--

Premise wise this movie is quite good.  The special effects are top notch.  Dren looks quite real.  Dren while a monster, is nothing in comparison to what the doctors are capible of.  In the end you can't really hate Dren, she didn't ask to be made, and she's just being what she is.  The acting and dialogue are not the best.  Brody says f@#k way too many times and without any need.  I don't mind swearing, (and do it quite a bit myself...), but I like it to at least have some purpose behind it.  Don't have an intelligent doctor in a lab swearing like a sailor for no reason.  Polley, while a good actress, doesn't really shine in this feature.  The film also suffers from spells of boringness.

Shoud you buy this?  I did...used for 4.99.  I would not recommend paying a fortune for this, as this is a one time view, maybe twice.  You will not find yourself yourning to re-watch this.  It was on HBO, it will no doubt re-show on there again.  This is a Sci-Fi movie to say the least, with some horror elements thrown in, not for everyone.  Definitely not a date movie...

Well, that's my thoughts.  As always sorry for any spelling/grammer mistakes.  I went to public school...",1340323200,,3490,4.805743243243243

The CGI is very poor and the characters never develop any redeeming qualities.  The behavior is just unbelieveable, and I must admit it became so silly, I laughed at some scenes.

This movie fails on so many levels, you have to wonder why anyone would sign on to this after reading the script.  Academy Award Winner Adrien Brody needs to fire his agent and the female lead needs a better makeup artist. Splice is not easy on the eyes.

This movie was rough.  An alien sex scene and a brutal rape later, you're left wondering what else the writers will throw at you.  This is not a movie for children, the faint of heart, or anyone who wants to preserve their sense of innocence. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  I can honestly say, I had NO IDEA what I was getting myself into when I clicked ""Rent""--and no matter what I tell you, I can bet with a great amount of certainty, neither will you.",1338163200,16,1150,4.625615763546798

4230583,4,B003YKYX7O,"I found Splice to be much more than the 'Species' 'clone' some folk have dubbed it. At least in this film, we can empathize with the poor creature, Dren. I will agree that the acting of the scientist couple is a bit melodramatic and over-the-top... but in the film's defense, genius is often earmarked with strange behavior. In this light, the film shines as a modern day Frankenstein. And believe me when I say that coming from me, that is very high praise indeed.

But I can simply wax on the praise when it comes to these reviews. Often, I get slammed for being objective. But there's no objectivity needed in the second half of a BD review: the special features. Specifically, the lack thereof. There is a 35 minute 'spliced' together behind the scenes that doesn't follow any sort of index for contents - it's just kinda there. There first couple of minutes is actually filming the filming, an artsy-feeling thing that you pray isn't the whole feature. And it isn't. The highlights are Adrien Brody cutting up between takes and the girls who actually do the performance of Dren, especially the little girl that plays baby-Dren. Surprisingly, none of the Dren footage is 100% CGI. If we had more special features or even just a commentary track, this review would be a five-star opinion.

But as the director states - this is the monster movie he's never seen. And that is a spot-on synopsis, and it is at the end of the day the reason I enjoyed the film as much as I did.",1335312000,2,1476,4.545112781954887

They have brought forth this 'creature.'  Sort of a lab rat, only human DNA...all makes sense, and they do it so well, mostly because they don' *over* do it, the creature is about what I imagine would come about.

It can also be compared as a modern day ""Frankenstein"" where scientists mess with Mother Nature.

In general I liked the movie.  However the film creates this interesting creature but focuses too much on the external elements of that act rather than on how she/he might evolve.  Still, you have to like it for some technically excellent filmmaking and a different sort of thriller.

Splice is about a relationship-stupid couple who were played by the great Adrien Brody and the incredibly annoying Sarah Polley. They're both brilliant genetic researchers who were on the break of fame for creating two genetically spliced creatures named Ginger and Fred that were the products of DNA from a multitude of organisms. What a fricken great idea; an idea that is explored in many great novels, movies, videogames, etc., and the idea in Splice falls extremely short of great. Well, to complicate the story, Sarah Polley injects human DNA into the same sort of organic base that Fred and Ginger were created from . . . and of course the organism would turn out to be humanoid . . . At this point there's potential for a great Frankenstein-esque tale . . . But no, it just turns into a sick, demented, bestiality, incest tale with no climax, no imagination, and with no likeable characters.

4230595,5,B003YKYX7O,"This is a very clever film. The director Natali is taking up strands from Cronenberg (sorry for the puns) and running long miles with them to create something else. For one thing Natali focuses on the characters and their creation to explore the ramifications of genetic experiment. Right from the first appearance of the ""human"" clone it becomes a question of empathy and species identification (note that even when she has grown into a young woman and they have to transfer her to a farm, the male protagonist still calls her ""it,"" while the female protagonist calls her ""she."")

The way the film works the characters shows up in two important scenes, when the female geneticist turns on her creation, and the male geneticist (shall we say) dances with his. It's a wonderfully played plot.

Disturbing? Yes. And a perfect new wave science fiction thriller that balances scientific jargon with human emotions. Why can't more sci-fi films be this clever and humane?",1324857600,2,965,4.950617283950617
4230596,4,B003YKYX7O,"It's less of a discussion of ethics in genetics and more of a creature feature, but there's still something lingering underneath Splice's obscurities that makes it more unforgettable than most horror films - or films in general, for that matter.

This is largely due to it being the first of the year to bull rush through a mental barricade that designates one emotional response from another.  In comedic moments, you laugh; in moments of suspense, you tense up.  There are, however, some films that come along every so often and offer us a situation that is purely beyond definition and, therefore, a response deemed appropriate.  Generally, we would opt for the most socially acceptable outburst; that is, something involving laughter.  You know the feeling, and we've certainly all heard it:  That creeping, slithering set of nervous chuckles that are too half-hearted to be legitimate.

Splice is littered with those.  You laugh but, inside, something is scrambling for a more accurate interpretation of what you just witnessed.  There's nothing ironic, witty, or tongue-in-cheek about Splice, at all.  But you'll be desperate to settle for those kinds of scapegoats subsequent to seeing it.  The reality of it is a bit more disturbing, scaling all kinds of sexual and moral taboos in place of any real message.  It's a delicious mess that makes you feel dirty while walking out of the theatre.

There's something strikingly Cronenbergian about its scare factor, and that makes it strikingly unique in otherwise contemporary horror cinema, so much that it almost comes off as silly.  The implications unsettle more than what's occurring on the screen, although there certainly are some pretty off-putting depictions, here.

I had no reason to believe that this wouldn't be a divisive film in its appeal; that much I knew.  What I was ultimately wrong about was why it would be just that.  Anything can be disturbing with enough creativity.  Where Splice truly compels and revolts is its absurdly screwy take on parenthood.  Having no child of my own, I can't talk much more about this, but I'm convinced that the quivering undertones of this film will make some mothers and fathers queasy and, ultimately, offended.  Without speaking much more about the plot, the creature itself forms two very contrasted and conflicted relationships with both of its ""parents""; the nature of said relationships is telling of a terrific script that owns and understands its premise.  You can tell that the whole crew behind this film treated it well.

At risk of ruining it for some, this is a story of tragedy (but, really, with a concept like this, did you expect anything otherwise?).  Despite their intentions, the characters are purely amoral, at best.  You won't find any one individual to empathize with but, really, it feels like it couldn't have been any other way.

To be drawn into a film as obscure and nihilistic as this one, the performances need to be sharp.  Like, really sharp.  Fortunately, they are, to the extent where we may have found our next dynamite duo.  Brody and Polley are just about impeccable, taking a que from the film itself and turning their intentionally nuanced efforts into an art form; nothing is given to the audience, but their slick mix of what they say and what they DON'T say gives us enough to work with so that we know what's going to happen long before it actually occurs.  That is not to say that Splice isn't a film that uses shock value, but the trick is not to revel in it; rather, Brody and Polley take the responsibility of adding value to every scene by adding their own unique foundations to two characters that are already dynamic.  It goes a long way towards making the film unsettling, even if it is occasionally predictable.

However, all of this comes second to the simple fact that Splice is just a really good Sci Fi flick.  It's original without be pompous, and controversial without being alienating - well, mostly.  Given its source material, it's impossible to truly say if this is movie that's for you or not.  Just suck it up and give it a shot.",1324166400,,4102,4.863112391930835

""Struggled"" as in struggled to find the TV remote (which had slipped down the side of the settee) so that I could turn it off before I'd finished the film. I managed to sell the film at a car boot sale at a small profit, so all was not lost.

The story is hackneyed in the extreme - genetic scientists play god and suffer the consequences when their creation turns on them (I assume - I never stayed the course to discover what the consequences were). Mary Shelley did it two centuries ago and it seems like Hollywood has been churning this stuff out ever since. That's all you need to know about the plot. However, to stand out from the crowd, something like this really has to say something new and the best that our director could come up with is ""genetics"" and ""big pharma"". Yawn

Every scene seems to deliver yet another cliche - the protagonists (Brody and Polley) and their assistants are portrayed as stereotypical geeks/nerds, playing rock music in the lab and wearing jeans & tees (Gasp! How non-co nformist can you get?). The ""nerdy scientist"" thing is overdone to the point that their independent company is called N.E.R.D (do you see what they did there?) and they name their creation Dren (Nerd backwards - geddit? My sides were splitting). Then, when things go wrong in the lab, the ""corporation"" comes down on our heroes and bans rock music and jeans (Boo! Rotters!). And of course, the initial ""all going wrong"" bit early in the film is not only scientifically catastrophic, but it happens in front of an audience of investors (who end up covered in gouts of blood - ah the symbolism!).

Oh yes... the producer does like his symbolism: in fact he likes it so much that he uses it as an offensive weapon. So, the incubator that grows & gives birth to the Dren creature is a ""symbolic"" womb (complete with an insufficiently symbolic v@gin@ - I was surprised and relieved not to see symbolic pub1c hair) and Polley even assists the birth in good old ""James Herriot"" style. Tip to the producer - if you want to be symbolic, subtlety is your friend. Give the audience a chance to work it out for itself.

The acting ain't that great either. Aiden Brody (The Thin Red Line) is, I am led to believe, a good actor and I loved Sarah Polley in her (debut which makes this film all the more disappointing. Perhaps they realised early on that they had signed up to a dog and simply let it go after that. Who can tell?

You may have got the impression that I don't think much of this film. Well done! Honestly, I'm not that hard to please - I enjoyed Angelina Jolie's Tomb Raider films and I love the Resident Evil film franchise so clearly my tastes aren't that elevated.

The underlining theme is nothing new. This is Frankenstein told over --but you can forget about gothic villages and peasants with torches. SPLICE's creature finds life in a state-of-the-art Mega Corporate genetics lab. This hopelessly doomed experiment-gone-wrong is the creation of 2 curious and brilliant gene splice jockeys who can't fight the urge to throw a little bit of their own human DNA into the old chromasonal cauldron.

Things get sticky, hot and incredibly creepy. In the end, nothing good can come of messing around with the laws of creation. Especially in the last 15 minutes of this horror thriller.

This is slick and scary sci-fi story weaving. Its wonderfully first-rate musical score is an unexpected delight.  But I would hate to give anything away. Go ahead and buy this one.

4230602,1,B003YKYX7O,"I went to see this with my wife thinking a sci-fi flick and then some dinner would be a nice evening out.  Had I known the movie was going to go the way it did, I would have saved myself the agony of watching it by pouring gas on my feet and setting them on fire.  It would have been just as entertaining and nowhere near as painful.

Seriously, I've never had as many WTF moments in a movie as I did this one.  My wife and I left the theater shaking our heads and the only saving grace for me was that she was the one that picked this stinker of a movie, so I didn't have to listen to ANY bitching whatsoever about my poor movie choices.  In fact, Splice has become somewhat of an ""ace-in-the-hole"" for me when it comes to getting reamed over a movie she doesn't like.

The plot is standard to start, but then it gets a little twisted.  And by twisted, I mean depraved on a level that even a demon from hell would say ""That's f'ing creepy, man!"".  A plot overview is really unnecessary at this point and I'll probably try hypnosis to forget this degenerate film fest.  The moral of the story is: Don't stick your pee-pee in the science experiment.  Do not take kids to see this.  Do not take the elderly, faint of heart or anyone with at least a shred of dignity or moral fiber about them as it will stain their precious minds for the rest of their natural lives.

4230604,3,B003YKYX7O,"Splice(released June/10)stars Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody and was a Canadian/French co-production,filmed in and around Toronto. This Sci-Fi thriller is not quite as thrilling as I thought it would be. I don't know if its the length,the been there-done that moments in the plot,the lack of chemistry between the two stars or something else but it certainly lacks a serious punch.
The plot involves the two stars as geneticists working for a pharmaceutical company in R&D.The two create two live ""lumps"" and name them Fred and Ginger. However they want to push the envelope even farther,so Sarah injects some of her own DNA into a genetic soup and voila,Dren is born. At first it's a kind of cute though uncoordinated cat-like creature on long spindly legs but it soon is growing at an exponential rate. In order to keep their secret a secret,they take Dren to Sarah's parents abandoned farm where they keep her under wraps as she matures. With her physical growth comes mental growth and she continues to amaze and astonish Adrien and Sarah constantly. By accident they discover she is a water breather and after a fit of temper Dren takes to the roof and sprouts wings!
As time wears on Dren is developing feelings for Adrien who ends up sleeping with her. Sarah finds them together and storms out. At a conference of big wigs and backers,their company puts on a display of Fred and Ginger. When they put them together they inexplicably end up killing each other in a blood bath that spills into the audience. It turns out one of them transformed from a female into a male. The company is ruined unless the two can come up with a special cloning sequence they have been working on but so far to no avail. Sarah returns with a piece of Dren and successfully creates the sequence. In the meantime Dren is found in a comatose state back on the farm and she apparently ends up dying on them. Just after they bury her Adriens movie brother and their boss show up demanding to see the creature. As Sarah tosses the boss the shovel to go dig her up himself,something flies down a swoops him away. In a few moments it's  Adriens brother turn. Both go running into the woods to search for them but Adrien loses his light in a pond. As he is retrieving it he is pulled in,and after a few tense moments resurfaces,and is helped onto the ground unable to move. Suddenly the creature that was Dren is now rising from the pond,has wings and is now a male;and he's after some female companionship. The creature chases Sarah down and has intercourse with her. Adrien shows up to impale the creature with a strong branch but Dren pulls it out more being more than a little mad at Adrien. As the creature turns its attentions on him it gives Sarah a chance to gather her wits and hit Dren from behind. Just before she gives it the final blow,Dren kills Adrien with a swift flick of its tale.
The film ends as we see the head of the pharmaceutical company offering Sarah a lucrative contract for her continuing aid in R&D.We also see she's pregnant. Was it Adrien or Dren?
As I said at the start,I don't know what it is about this movie that just doesn't excite me as it should. The S/FX and make up are top notch involving DREN,the acting is solid but it lies somewhere between the lack of good scary moments and their timing when they do occur,to the lack of on screen chemistry between Polley and Brody. Plus the script is little on the ho-hum side too. Just nothing to sink your teeth into.
Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp and in its' original a/r of 1:78:1. Extras include the trailer,a teaser,a Fangoria mag interview with the director and a behind the scenes look at the set.
All in all this average to just above average flick plays well as far as the creature is concerned and the S/FXs and make up involved therein. But the movie overall doesn't have the scary impact it should and as a result when the ""tense"" moments come they play out more with a whimper than a bang.",1319846400,,3980,4.520110957004161
4230605,2,B003YKYX7O,"This attempts to be serious hard scifi, but there is something about the film as a whole that simply fails.  The script is all over the place.  On the one hand, it tries to be a kind of morality tale, raising questions about the ethics of scientists seeking their brand of truth.  You have a couple - the woman pushing ahead, the guy doubting and ultimately letting her do what she wants - who debate things in a wooden dialogue that doesn't go far enough.  Brody kind of yells out his concerns in certain situations, but doesn't hesitate to make love to the creature later.  The scientists do an illegal, dangerous experiment in secret, using the facilities of their company to pursue their own designs, with startling results.  On the other hand, they create a monster and it becomes a life-and-death struggle, etc.  Here it more or less fits into a formula:  fascination, revulsion, fear, then violence a la Frankenstein.  Oh, and an amoral corporation is bankrolling the whole thing.

It would have succeeded better if the chemistry between the stars - Brody and Polley - somehow played better on screen, but I just couldn't believe them - that they were in love, that they were geniuses, that they had some higher, if mistaken, purpose in mind.  Brody is much better than Polley, whom I had never seen before and think gives a mediocre and inconsistent performance.  This failure is the crux of the film's failure, in my view.

A lot of it is unbearably grotesque and ridiculously overdone.  There is one scene where these invented members of a new species square off and turn eachother into oozing pulp for incomprehensible reasons.  It is bad enough that it had to be so disgusting, but they did it (surprise!) at a demonstration in a shareholders' meeting, which just isn't believable.  A similar thing happens with the monster, of course, who also turns out to be based in human part on the DNA of the female scientist.

I think one of the best things in the film is the monster.  Her character is subtle and an evolving enigma, the effects are flawlessly realistic, at least in a visual sense.  I did find her perfection as an organism a bit much, but that is a problem only for the serious hard scifi buff.

Clive and Elsa are two scientists who splice DNA from different animals to make proteins for the medical industry.  When they secretly splice human DNA into the mix the result is a weird hybrid, who grows at an alarming rate and has unique characteristics that are at first intriguing and which quickly become more alarming.

The special effects in this film are reasonable and the plot, whilst predictable and clichd is entertaining enough.  The acting leaves a lot to be desired and I have seen Brody act a lot better than what he offers us in this film.

This film feels a bit flat to be honest.  It's not the worst film I've ever seen, but it doesn't offer anything new and it plods along without any real zest or flair.  It feels like it is a `sci-fi by-numbers' film and the director doesn't try to do anything new or original with the concept.

Never-the-less it is worth a viewing if you can catch it on TV for free or as part of a rental package.  It isn't quite as bad as some people have said, but it's not far off!

The eventual result is a pseudo-humanoid they name Dren, that ends up looking sort of like a 21-year old Telly Savalas, but with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, ostrich legs, and a tail.  A slew of other genetic surprises and advantages as well.  Don't worry though, because the two were implausibly able to keep this genetic monstrosity a secret from everyone else in the lab.  So no problem.  Wink, wink.

4230614,2,B003YKYX7O,"I think the people behind ""Splice"" were going for a tragic-Frankenstein-like tale, but missed the mark horribly. Going into the film, I had some expectation (not a lot...but some) that it would be a fun creature-feature type flick. I mean it had an Academy Award winner as its star, it had to be somewhat better than a SyFy Channel original movie...right?

Wrong!

""Splice"" tells the story of two genetic scientists (Adrian Brody & Sarah Polley)who've created a new life form by combining certain elements from a bunch of animals. These two ""animals"" which look like leather bags filled with bad cheese are producing an protien that helps fight diseases in animals. The scientists want to take the next step of adding human DNA into the mix. They are told no, and of course do it anyway. Soon a little hamster-chicken thing is running around the lab eating Tic Tac's. For some reason the hamster-chicken grows super-fast and the scientist begin raising it like a little girl, and before you know it blamm-o she's a young woman...with a poison filled stinger at the tip of her tail.

There were just so many mis-steps in ""Splice"" it's difficult to just pinpoint where the movie veers off-course, but my guess would be when you first meet the two scientists in the opening scenes with their meat-sack creations, and by the time you see the little chicken-hamster thing, you can't help but start chuckling. What kind of scientists are these guys, the certainly aren't very good evil scientists, and they are not likable, and to top it off the they drive around in a 1970's era AMC Gremlin! Just poor judgement all aound.

Also, on a side note. If you are making a horror film, at least try to make it somewhat scary. There is no tension, no suspense and no horror in ""Splice""...well except for Adrian Brody's love-makin' face which we get to see twice unfortunately. Just a horrible film, that at times is laughable, but not in a good way. I recommend ""Sharktopus"" or ""Dinocroc"" instead.

I'm stunned that two talented actors like Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley were in this dog of a movie. I love great science fiction and I'm willing to suspend a fair amount of disbelief to enjoy a nice film, but that simply wasn't possible in this case. The movie is silly and implausible from beginning to end and revolves around two brilliant scientists who make infinitely stupid, unethical decisions - one after the other. With bad CGI and gripping dialogue between Adrien and Sarah like, ""I don't even know who you are anymore"", this is a film to avoid. Dumb.",1310860800,3,681,4.544715447154472
4230616,1,B003YKYX7O,"This is one of those movies that you watch and it stays in your head...for far too long! I am kind of at a loss for words but will try to do a ""review"".

I didn't even remember hearing about this film. I don't know if it came out in the movies or on DVD but it should've never been created. I'll tell you that. They wasted millions on garbage. I caught it on Comcast On Demand so at least I didn't pay for it.

This movie is so bad it doesn't deserve a review but I'll give it a try. There is nothing good about this movie. Even the special effects sucked. The plot was nothing new and the entire film was a waste of time. Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley are scientists (yeah right) who ""splice"" together human DNA with a bunch of other stuff and creates this alien/human girl, snot-looking thing they name Dren. They keep her in the lab until she gets too big and noisy then move her to a secluded ranch in the middle of nowhere. By this time you've either turned off this movie or have fallen asleep. Unlucky for me I managed to stay awake through the entire thing and I will regret it for the rest of my life.

I don't know what the hell the producers, writer or director was thinking of. You can't even classify this film. At first it starts off looking like it would be Alien, with Dren going crazy and killing people. That doesn't happen. It suddenly switches into PBS Family Hour when they get to the farm. Sarah Polley has become obsessed with the creature and thinks it's her daughter. If that's not disgusting enough, Adrian Brody is lusting after the alien and we soon go from PBS Family Hour to alien porn! Yes, that's what you get from this film, a lot of bad writing, sickening scenes and alien pornography as if the film wasn't sleazy enough as it is.

Adrian Brody has sex with Dren and Dren (who has the ability to change from female to male) changes into a male and rapes Sarah Polley in the woods. Yes, that's right. We get alien sex from Adrian Brody and an alien rape in just a few scenes afterward. I almost threw up everything I ate.

Sigh. What can I say? Unless you don't have long to live and you don't give a hoot what you watch, hey what the heck? Might as well watch this. But if you got a life to live and one you enjoy, run from this like the plague. There is nothing good about this movie at all. I actually love Adrian Brody but after seeing him in this, not so sure. This is further proof that Brody's been hit by the Oscar Winner curse. He hasn't done anything beyond B-movie status since he won Best Actor and it's such a waste.

But hey, at least Dren was pretty. She was actually the best-looking one in the film. Neither Brody or Polley are beauties by all-means but they looked especially retched in this. Polley looked like a ghost and Brody like a phantom. Maybe this horrid movie affected their looks.

4230621,5,B003YKYX7O,"On the cutting edge of science, things are now becoming possible that used to be only the province of tales like Dr. Moreau and Frankenstein.  And in the highly authentic-feeling ""Splice"", the central question is, as it has been in many great tales from at least ""Frankenstein"" onward: with this power, will humanity be able to distinguish between the issues of ""what can and can't be done"" and ""what Should and Shouldn't"" be done?

  Two scientists, excellently played by Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody, are in the field of splicing genes from different species into one another to create new lifeforms.  Though there's a question right and there about ethics, at least the motivations are noble - trying to find cures from disease through new biochemicals, etc.  There's a striking but believable self-contradiction in the main characters right there: though they seem attached and even, at times, almost parental in their feelings toward these hybrids, they have no emotional or ethical objection against just how they use these creatures in pursuit of their goals, or in disposing of them when it comes to that.  It's when the pair goes against all guidelines and laws by adding human DNA into the mix that things get taken to a much higher level.

  The result of the human-animal splice is Dren, a strange little creature that in its infancy appears alternately comical and deadly.  The researchers are initially prepared to destroy the hybrid - they never intended to let it get past the stage of an early embryo, then destroy it there and research the remains.  But among Dren's wonderous physical properties is a phenomenally fast growth rate, and by its birth that growth rate is already spinning things out of control.  Finding themselves unable to kill a newborn hybrid with human DNA and some human characteristics, they hide Dren's existance from their peers and begin to study her.  They bond quickly with Dren, with Polley's character first assuming a distinctly mother-like role to the fast-growing Dren.  As Dren grows, she becomes extremely intelligent, and the bonds within the group start to take on very disturbing overtones.

  Like the Frankenstein creation, Dren - who contains not only human DNA but genes from a whole battery of creatures including scorpions, birds, amphibians, and heaven knows what else - is both the movie's ""monster"" and its victim.  The horror escalates - not in a ""the world's going to end tomorrow"" kind of way, but in a manner that sees everything going to hell in a handbasket within the main group of characters, and slowly starting to spiral out to those around them.  Among the movie's most potent fright weapons is the disturbingly plausible feeling it has - that eventually, somebody, somewhere, will go and do something like this, if for no other reason than to prove that they can.  And that the results might be just as unpredictable and ghastly as they are here.

  Great special effects and a plot that takes classic themes and moves them into even more twisted territory add to the whole.  Great movie, nine out of ten.",1307923200,12,3082,4.914893617021277

4230624,3,B003YKYX7O,"This movie is such a super-collided atomic mess that it is hard to rate ""Splice"" with just a single star for how endearingly awful it is; and for that reason, it's almost tempting to give it five stars for being such a stunning screw-up. Obviously, someone had high-hopes for ""Splice;"" by casting Oscar winner Adrian Brody and handing it to up and coming director Vincenzo Natali (best known for cult science-fiction classic ""The Cube""), ""Splice"" had a high concept and old fashioned B-Movie science fiction plot going for it. Brody and co-star Sarah Polley are the scientists who decide to ignore all the rules and go against those stuffy conventions that they get the scientific breakthrough they wanted. The bad news is: they get the scientific breakthrough they wanted.

Yes, that's right. These ever so hip scientists (Brody wanders the lab with ironic t-shirts, there's Anime artwork in the couple's apartment) are genius DNA specialists that somehow match human DNA with amphibians, scorpions, birds and who knows what else to create Dren, which happens to be Nerd spelled backward. Like most science fiction monsters, Dren grows at a ridiculously fast pace, has super-human intelligence, childlike behavior and not much by way of moral turpitude. Of course, Brody and Polley soon lose all scientific objectivity regarding Dren and fall in love with their little monster, and that's when things go horribly wrong.

While this might seem like boiler-plate science-fiction, ""Splice"" may be the first hipster Science Fiction movie. The best sci-fi/suspense/horror works when your monster somehow is an allegory for whatever the zeitgeist of the world is at the moment. ""Splice"" works that angle in that ""Dren"" begs us to consider what nasty creatures we may create if we start messing with Mother Nature, but soon starts going for new levels of irony. Before you know it, ""Splice"" is whipping questions of gender identity, circumcision, lust, love, parenting, rape and finally, the usual evil corporation profit mongers. With ever upping of the ante, as a viewer, you're left to wonder ""did they really just go there?"" The answer is yes, and the film just keeps on going. The final third of the movie is such a mess that you feel like you're watching the train wreck. It's not wretchedly bad (for that, you need ""Alien Vs Predator"" or ""Battlefield Earth""), but ""Splice"" - which borrows so much from the likes of ""Species,"" ""Alien,"" ""Prophecy"" and even ""Rosemary's Baby"" that you may feel a bit of deja vu - will still leave you stunned.",1302825600,3,2540,5.016587677725118

I watched and even rewatched the first part of the film but must admit that the science was a bit thin.  Of course, this is characteristic of all Science-Horror films.

This film is shocking, controversial and will certainly put some viewers off with its themes of blasphemy, bestiality, incest and rape!

4230630,4,B003YKYX7O,"Splice is a little gem from 2009 that is a great view of horror that is created purely by science. Yes that's right it's a science fiction and horror mash up which, when done well, is my favorite mixture of genre's. It's mainly a fun mix as a lot of what is focused on in science fiction is actually based in reality when it comes to being mixed with horror. While not a house hold name this is actually Vincenzo Natali's second foray into a film that mixes the two genres and as his last 1997 film that mixed the two, Cube, became a cult hit I have the distinct feeling that Splice will follow the same trend.

Gene splicing is not a new concept. It's a field that has been worked on for years and one that new breakthroughs are still occurring. Mixing genes to find ways to grow human organs is also not a new concept and the mixing of genes to create a new species has been written about for years. On the face of things, scientifically most of what is found is this film is not new. The creation of 'new' life by two scientists who aren't fully held in check by the company that they work for and who have their own ideas on how science should be done leads to a border line mad science feel mixed with the idea that what they are doing is right. Well that is at least the view that Elsa (Sarah Polley) believes and as her research partner partner, Clive (Adrien Brody,) is also her lover he will pretty much go along with anything she says.

What this leads to is not only a new species of life but one that has a mixture of human DNA in it. They of course cannot let the company that they work for know about their creation so have it hidden away in a corner of the lab. However when the creature they have created is fully 'born' they end up taking it out of the laboratory so as to not have it be found. It continues to grow into at first a child at the abandoned house Elsa grew up in and eventually into a young 'woman' that is self aware who they have named Dren (Delphine Chaneac.)

Self awareness is great but just like in an artificial intelligence it's a bad thing to have in a new species who not only wants to be able to be free but also starts to fall in love with Clive while beginning to resent Elsa. From science to the Oedipus complex to horror as Dren starts to at first be angry with Elsa to beginning to fight with her as she also falls in love with Clive. While all of this is happening we learn that the first two creatures they had created have gone from being in love to violently murdering each other. Foreshadowing? I think so! If you are a fan of mixing your horror and science I'd suggest at the very least renting this one immediately. I know it's going to be permanently added to my collection.",1301788800,,2729,4.1647727272727275
4230631,5,B003YKYX7O,"I wasn't expecting Splice to be as memorable as it was.  Absolutely *exciting* the entire time- that's the best way to describe my honest feelings.

The storyline is just terrific and done in a way that's neither confusing or overbearing.  It's about a man and his girlfriend (or wife, I forget) who are both scientists, and they spend quite a bit of time experimenting and creating creatures in their lab that are part human and part... something else.  As you can guess, this is totally illegal, so they have to constantly keep a low profile and hide their results during inspections and other times.

Well the results are that the creatures that form are anything but normal (without spoiling too much for you, my loyal readers, hehe).

What makes Splice a little different from most movies that fall in the same category is that you get to witness the creature start out as just a baby and watch it grow and develop with every new scene.  If you find these kind of films interesting, you will no doubt be sitting there and constantly guessing just what *will* the creature do next.  There's no telling.

The man and woman play the role of parenting the adorable creature (yes I admit, it WAS adorable).  They soon discover that it's female.  At first the thing jumps around all over the room making the man and woman VERY nervous that it might need to be put down immediately, but after some heavy convincing on the part of the girlfriend, the creature lives on.

I absolutely love the way the storyline rolls along.  Excellent writing because it keeps you wanting to know more.  You get to experience the creature go from a baby, to a teenager, and finally to an adult.  When it finally does become an adult (which happens extremely quickly, might I add) *this* is when things get interesting (and no, I won't be spoiling any key moments of storytelling- sorry!).

So no, this is most certainly NOT a storyline about some chaotic monster experiment that eventually takes out the entire world- this particular movie is about a creature that sticks around a distinct group of people that it seems to refers to as family, and it's really appealing to witness the creature try to communicate with the man and woman throughout the film, and how much information it's capable of absorbing and understanding.

One outstanding scene is when a presentation takes place inside an auditorium showing two baby creatures and their potential, and while locked inside the glass cage, something goes horribly wrong involving lots of blood and stabbing, resulting in everyone who attended the presentation to immediately take off running.  This scene was my favorite in the entire movie because the suspense was overwhelmingly superb.

Overall, yes.  Splice does everything right.  It's entertaining, suspenseful, and while I initially didn't care for the acting in the beginning, it eventually won me over as well.  Just a great suspense (or sci fi- whichever one you feel more comfortable referring to it as).",1301702400,2,2999,4.850687622789784

The later scene with the cat got me a little sad because it got stung/poisoned to death. Then there was a SLAP to the FACE and I thought Elsa was going to be killed next. But Dren let up and stole the key to get outside. She got shovel'd upside the head by Elsa. A few moments later we she her on a table because Elsa decided it was best to remove Dren's stinger. Later doing a sex scene with Clive, Dren's stinger grows back, just as Elsa walks in on both of them. Super awkward moment there! To me it felt humorous the movie had sex scenes with some kind of human/animal hybrid. I did think at some point Dren would learn to actually speak in complete sentences but I guess not.

Instead we viewed what seemed to be a nearly incoherent movie - and actually it was incoherent in parts - as well as at least one character who disappeared at the last moment, with no explanation.

The sex scenes? My spouse and I both felt disgusted by those and we aren't uptight about sex scenes in movies. These were just pitiful, violent and made no sense. Were they just thrown in there in hopes of attracting some extra suspense or attention? If so, the attention was the wrong kind. I felt sorry for the actors in this film.

4230646,2,B003YKYX7O,"At first sight, ""Splice"" (Dark Castle being its co-production company) belongs to the minor genre, namely a sci-fi film about brilliant (and often misguided) scientists doing some morally debatable experiments. As you know, the subject matter has been treated in films countless times since Dr. Frankenstein and his monster, but ""Splice"" directed by Vincenzo Natali (""Cube"") attempts to give some emotional depths to the overused topic. ""Splice"" is not just a sci-fi thriller. Well, the trouble is, whatever ""Splice"" wants to be, the film looks very silly.

Two maverick scientists Clive (Adrien Brody) and Elsa (Sarah Polley) hired by a pharmaceutical company that wants a new medicine have made a groundbreaking invention: a totally new life form. The genetically engineered ""creature"" (named ""Dren"") looks like a human with a long tail. Here is an opportunity for ethical debate or ""Species""-like campy horrors. Instead of them, Natali's ""Splice"" tries to focus the fragile relationships between the scientists and its subject, or something more disturbing.

So far, the film is not bad. The special effects are also decent. The problem is, in order to make its point the film ignores details that are essential to building up believable characters. It is painful watching characters (not just Clive and Elsa), who should be enough intelligent to discuss moral dilemma, making stupid decisions over and over again. Those scientists don't even know what they really want. The company is so sloppy in managing their ""properties"" on which they must have spent millions of dollars. So why should we take the film seriously?

It is even more painful watching talented actors playing unbelievable characters exchanging silly dialogs. But the greatest problem is that ""Splice"" is predictable and boring.

I finally had a chance to watch this movie and I will say that while I enjoyed it, there were moments in the movie that made it drag out.  The whole sex scene between Clive and Elsa, then Clive and Dren, and then of course Elsa and Dren were way to drawn out and really dragged the movie down.  A few simple seconds to show this would make sense, but to waste about 5 minutes on it was pointless.  I was wondering why they kept showing this, until the end where they actually showed that Elsa was pregnant.  The other problem with this was when Dren changed to a male and went on the attack; they only had this last about 10-15 minutes at the most.  I wish they took alot more time to show more of the attack scenes, and have this creature go crazy.

4230653,5,B003YKYX7O,"I grew up with a Sci-Fi imagination and read the genre to escape the realities of adolescence. I collect films in every genre but ""horror"" (which I consider thinly veiled ""snuff porn"" sold to an only-too-eager audience).

My response to ""Splice"" is unique. I had to shut my eyes through several difficult and uncomfortable moments. Also, I believe all the 1-star and 5-star reviews are accurate. However, it seems clear that the real difference in these two extremes is in how reviewers process their discomfort.

If you are in the habit of rejecting everything that makes you uncomfortable, you won't like the film inspite of the good acting, writing, direction, and production values. On the other hand, if you are intrigued by seeing things you never quite imagined, you will like the film but be unclear about why because it also made you uncomfortable.

As someone interested in science's impact on society, the most intriguing thing I can offer about this film is that it will take you somewhere inside yourself that a sci-fi flick doesn't often take you, and you will either hate the thing that took you there, or be intrigued by it.

Yes, this film uses easily-recognized devices to elicit this emotion or that. Yes, the acting and writing are way above average for the genre. Yes, this film is creepy... but, unlike lesser efforts, it is also restrained in this regard. Yes, it has ""sequel"" written all over it (which, if it has the same writer/director and female lead, would be a potentially good thing).

However, what I appreciated most about this movie was the flawed, human context in which scientists are scientists and do science. Their (and our) hubris underlying some of what they have done (atomic, chemical, and biological weapons), and what some of them are only too eager to do in the future (splice together human and non-human DNA) is breath-taking. And, of course, what scenario would be complete without one bright, ambitious moran saying to another, ""If we don't do it, someone with fewer moral scrupples will.""

Interestingly, this film also has an element of Biblical Eve in it. Just as in Richard Kelly's ""The Box,"" it is the woman (in the case of ""the Box,"" the women) who finds it impossible NOT to cross a recognized moral/ethical line, and is udderly determined to defy the significant male in her life in order to do so.

Literally. Figuratively. Storyline, photography, dialogue. The female lead actor is horrible. Adrian Brody is quite good, however.

IF I SEE ONE MORE ANIMAL ""die"" on film, whether staged or not, I will join PETA, hunt down the director(s) responsible, and never ever ever see any of their films again. I've seen enough animal death in my life to know it shouldn't be taken as lightly as it is, whether on film or not. The consciousness and intelligence of the helpless children and animals that suffer every day deserve more than that.

Its one redeeming quality is that, for the non-brain-dead who may watch it, it alerts us to the horrors of gene manipulation. This is playing God, playing with fire and gasoline, pure and simple.

We both found it to be a better movie than Species in part because throughout the movie, you couldn't help but wonder at just WHAT? genes were used to create the creature.

4230664,3,B003YKYX7O,"I didn't see any ads etc for this so it was all new to me upon first (and rather likely last) viewing. Unlike most reviewers here, the alien sex scenes didn't bother me a bit, but merely confirmed how irredeemably goofy this flick is.

In fact, I'd wager that we'll be seeing more human/alien sex scenes in the next few years, so you might want to acclimatize. We're getting more and more hints in the media that not only may there be life out there in the trillions of planets (gosh, what are the odds?!), but who knows? Maybe WE are already alien/simian hybrids! It would certainly offer one of the few viable explanations as to how we're the only species on earth that reliably destroys its environment over and over. Remember that speech by Mr. Smith in The Matrix about how humans are a cancer on this planet? He might be a lot too accurate.

In any case, to me the alien sex scene was a whole lot less disturbing than what we see on the news every night. My tax dollars killing hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians...now THAT is truly disturbing. Whereas this movie is fiction. Our actions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam and elsewhere are not. It's fascinating how we've been conditioned to regard massive violence and military massacres as no problem, but we can't even see a pair of breasts on tv without freaking out about morality...even alien breasts that don't really exist.

But beyond all that, Splice fails on so many fronts. The script misses endless chances to explore the ethics of interspecies gene splicing, the acting is weak at best (thought Sarah Polley had us hating her character pretty early on; she's very good at being annoying), and the pacing is mixed. Despite all that, we were entertained by it all, bad and good. It's shot pretty well, has a few amusing moments, and did hold our interest (even if it was just disbelief). Brody adds little, but Dren is quite entertaining...I like how she suddenly reveals whatever genetic accoutrements she needs, from wings to gills to a fully-loaded interstellar credit card (but only on the European dvd version).

Dren was what made this worth sitting through, for me, and the concept raises enough questions and few enough answers to really make one ponder what is Right and what is Wrong...and if there even is such a dichotomy anymore. In fact, the best part for me was the ending (big spoilers coming); it makes perfect sense (and gets us sequel-ready) that the non-Heroine gets pregnant by an alien with her own dna...that's a near perfect metaphor for modern life! We're so far up our own butts we have no idea what's ""right"" any more, and you can bet that we'll be seeing interspecies slicing any day.

In fact, it's almost a sure bet that the military is already doing it in their various black ops, and like I said it's also a fair bet that we are all carrying non-terrestrial dna around as well. We seem to give first use of all new tech to the military, so who knows how we'll first learn of it...a fake alien attack to promote a one-world government? Now there's a movie just waiting to be made. Or a ""reality"" already prepped for release..

All in all, I'd recommend Splice if you enjoy bouncing all sorts of concepts around in your head, and are willing to withstand weak acting and writing in exchange for the chance to ponder many imponderables. Because what was once imponderable is now quite within the realm of ""reality"", and despite Splice's many failings, it raises plenty of thoughts worth thinking. The blu-ray has a good transfer, btw, and its detail shows how good the cgi on Dren was, at least.

And to all you folks who were omg SO grossed out by the alien sex scene, let me ask you this: if you found out that the only way you could cure your child of a fatal disease was by someone, even you, having sex with an alien...might you not suddenly reconsider your moral stance? Stem cell research is but one step away from that, and one thing we've proven as a species is that when it all comes down to it, it ain't all for one and one for all, it's one for one. We're a mighty selfish bunch, and who knows what lines we'll cross to preserve our all-important personal dna...wherever it might be from.",1292112000,,4202,4.56498673740053

(Warner, 2010)
-----------------------------
This is a genuinely creepy, intentionally low-rent horror/sci-fi story involving genetic engineering and a hefty dose of dark humor and morbid camp. Like Larry Cohen's ""It's Alive"" (which is referenced early in the film), ""Splice"" parodies the conventions of child-rearing and parenthood, as two morally tonedeaf scientists create a new human hybrid and proceed to bicker endlessly about how to raise it. Meanwhile, their new ""daughter"" evolves and adapts rapidly - and starts to develop a taste for blood.  Meanwhile, of course, there's an evil corporation to contend with, and an inevitable experiment-on-the-run scenario... It's the ""Mommy Dearest""-meets-""Kramer-vs-Kramer"" bad-parenting psychological schtick that's the heart of this movie, and of its over-the-top humor. If you aren't into old-school so-bad-its-good, midnight movie camp-horror, this flick won't appeal to you... But I suspect there are more than a few viewers out there that will consider this a classic. (Axton)",1292025600,5,1039,5.926666666666667
4230666,3,B003YKYX7O,"Bottom-Line:  If nothing else Splice is solid Saturday afternoon entertainment.

Is Adrien Brody the next Cuba Gooding Jr.?  After Cuba won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in Jerry Maguire (1998), his star has faded into obscurity.  There have been some bright spots like Men of Honor (2000), but overall Cuba's career has careened into the ""straight-to-DVD"" genre.

And so it seems to be going with Adrien Brody.  After turning in a masterful performance in The Pianist (2002) and winning the Best Actor Oscar for same, Brody movie choices have been questionable.  Again there are bright spots like Cadillac Records (2008), but most of Brody's work after The Pianist has been forgettable.  Even his turn in King Kong (2005) opposite of Naomi Watts was, well, unremarkable.  Which brings us to Splice (2010), wherein he stars opposite Sarah Polley.  The movie itself is not terrible, but I have to wonder what Mr. Brody is doing in a movie that could very well have premiered on the SyFy Channel!

Story-Line

Written and directed by Vincenzo Natali, Splice centers on two scientist who also happen to be lovers: Clive Nicoli (Adrien Brody ~ The Pianist, King Kong, The Affair of the Necklace) and Elsa Kast (Sara Polley ~ Go, John Adams, The Secret Life of Words) as they experiment with gene and such.  The pair, who work for a budding startup company have been successful in splicing together genes to rudimentary create life.

But Elsa is impatient and wants to create a more viable life form, so without Clive's knowledge she creates Dren portrayed by French actress Delphine Chaneac.  When Clive discovers Elsa creation he wants to terminate it, but Elsa wants to keep it alive; she prevails and Dren starts to grown and manifest abilities heretofore unknown to humans, like the ability to breathe fully under water.  But then again Dren, a female isn't exactly human; she is a new spices spliced together with compatible genes...

My Thoughts
Let's face it Adrien Brody is not exactly leading man material.  His looks are a bit too unconventional for that slot in the Hollywood hit making machine.  When cast in the role of leading man in the past, the story has suffered; such is the case with Splice.  Mr. Brody and Ms. Polley had zero chemistry, and were not the least bit believable as a couple, let alone a pair of budding biologists.  Their one love making scene together was almost painful to watch.

While Ms. Polley is known for her rather emotive face and plays it well here, Mr. Brody played his role rather understated and, dare I state, emotionless.  He was just not that fun to watch, I felt nothing for his character, because I felt nothing from his character.

On the other hand I very much enjoyed Delphine Chaneac's performance as Dren (nerd spelled backwards in case you missed it), the life form that is really not sure what it is supposed to be, or do.  The actress has very engaging eyes and she used them to good stead in Splice.  Her performance is doubly laudable given she did not speak for most of the film. And I enjoyed Ms. Polley's performance as well.  The real interaction in this film takes place between Elsa and Dren that is where Splice shines.  In many ways Brody is just an afterthought and that is a shame because he is capable of so much more.

The premise behind Splice is timely; we live in an age where gene therapy and gene splicing is moving ahead at a pace where once again the science is getting ahead of morals. I enjoyed that aspect of the movie.  But also enjoyed some of the dark and unsettling paths Natali took the movie down.  Dren develops a closeness to Clive that can only lead once place, and Elsa has demons of her own that force her to turn on Dren...

If nothing else Splice is solid Saturday afternoon entertainment and the movie is most enjoyable when it embraces and revels in its science-experiment-gone-wrong (dark) horror persona.  Let's hope Adrien Brody's next movie is a little closer to The Pianist and far, far, away from Splice.",1292025600,2,4012,4.710186513629842

4230670,3,B003YKYX7O,"When I saw the preview for Splice, the first thing that came to my mind was that the movie looked like kind of a rip-off of that 1995 movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Species/dp/B000F9RB9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Species</a>&nbsp;that Natasha Henstridge walks around in half naked. And while there are indeed some major similarities between Splice and Species, I think that Splice Director Vincenzo Natali actually had another movie in mind when he wrote this movie.

Back in the early 1930s if you were to play God and try to create life how would you do it? We'll, you'd do some grave robbing and try to bring back the dead with a little lightening, right? How else? Because cloning and gene splicing in the 30s was a concept as distant as an iPhone. It's so much easier today. Just take some animal DNA and mix it with a little human DNA, throw it in a Petri dish, incubate, let sit then voil. It's alive....It's alive!!!

Splice's Dr. Frankensteins are Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley respectfully as Clive and Elsa. (Get it? Colin Clive played the original Dr. Frankenstein and Elsa Lanchester was 1935's Bride.) Clive and Elsa are geneticists and they create their own Frankenstein and call her Dren. Being only half human, Dren has some superior physical powers and--who knew?--introduce a little animal (or bird?) DNA to a human sample and you get a more intelligent being as well. So look out: a stronger, intelligent life form could be hazardous to your health.

I'm surprised that there are so many 1 star reviews for Splice on this page, because the movie isn't really that bad at all. Sure the movie deals with controversial topics, and Dren gets down and dirty with her makers in both a consenting (bestiality?) and non-consenting (rape) way. But questionable opinions and hard to watch sex scenes aside, I was entertained by Splice. There are times when you'll hear yourself saying, ""That would never happen,"" or ""No one would ever really do that,"" but the movie never gets boring.

Splice is certainly no Frankenstein classic, but it is a pretty good Sci-fi flick and I'd recommend it to any fan of the genre.",1291507200,49,2174,5.013850415512465

This would appeal to fans for the Cronenburg version of the fly, albeit without the gore factor.  Although there is one moment in the film with Adrian Brodie that is just crazy.

When a conflict with a sponsoring company bans some of their research, they continue, but hide their work.  In fact, they take their work home with them.  Big mistake.
Driven by their dangerous curiosity, a fast growing mutant, humanoid-like creature, Dren, is the result of their secret experiments.  Of course things get out of hand.

This promising film goes off the rails and loses whatever theme it set out to explore.

Too bad, there are lots of relevant issues here that resonate with daily headlines about the morality of harvesting embryonic cells.  Also, I thought the creature was not consistent in its appearance.

4230684,4,B003YKYX7O,"Splice is for the most part a fresh and original story idea for a horror film that sets itself apart from the many sequels and remakes to have come out in recent years. The film's premise and themes deal with tampering with nature and the fears and controversies behind biogenetic engineering. Similar themes to classic stories such as Frankenstein only with more recent technology and sciences. The film's premise is about two genetic engineers Clive(Adrien Brody) and Elsa(Sarah polley)combining the genes of many different animal species with a human to make a new type of hybrid species. The couple raise their creation named Dren as if were their own child. Dren grows at a rate much faster than normal species and first seems human in nature. However as she grows her animalistic traits start to kick in and she slowly turns on the couple.
This film starts out somewhat slow but picks up pace and moves along faster as it progresses. Splice also offers some shocking and controversial sequences that might be disturbing to some. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley give decent performances and are convincing enough in their roles. Actress Delphine Chaneac probably gives the best performance of the film. Being commited enough with the production to shave her hair off(similar to Natalie Portman in V For Vendetta) and convincingly uses non-verbal acting as her character Dren doesn't speak in any point of the movie. The special effects and makeup used in the movie are sufficient enough and the cgi baby dren or her added on limbs don't come across as fake as many films with cgi effects do.

4230689,4,B003YKYX7O,"Despite how the trailer may appear, SPLICE is not a fast-paced horror thriller. Sure, there are one or two jump moments, but overall its more of a slow-paced, character focused, classically inspired horror film. Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody both do a good job, staring as a scientific research couple whom secretly create a hybrid species in order to both further the advancement of the medical sciences and boost their egos. But as the hybrid grows, learns, and evolves, things become complicated for the couple. The majority of the film really focuses on these 3 characters and the relationships that develop between them. Splice is an interesting mix of Frankenstein/ Species/ and the Oedipus complex. This is defiantly the films strongpoint and the story makes for a good after-the-movie conversation. However Splice does suffer from some bad writing, primarily in questionable character decisions, but its not enough to completely ruin the viewing experience. The effects are quite good and the filmmakers did an excellent job of combining multiple visual techniques to bring the character of Dren to life. There is a little gore and some nudity, but not an overwhelming amount. Overall, Splice is refreshing and unlike what you typically find in Hollywood horror films these days. Although flawed, its still well worth checking out if your are a fan of classic horror/ sci-fi or you are just looking for a film that is a little different. 3 1/2 stars",1289347200,,1457,5.075
4230690,1,B003YKYX7O,"One reviewer noted that ""Splice"" has more in common with the films of David Cronenberg than anything Vincenzo Natali has been involved with.  That's an understatement.  This would be Vincenzo Natali taking direct cues from David Cronenberg and Piero Pasolini on a darker day and giving birth, no pun intended, to this disgusting piece of trash.

Adrien Brody plays Clive Nicoli--his character's appearance itself is enough to tell you ""not a quality movie"" (bleached red hair and corporate hipster wear, just not jiving with Brody's regular appearance)--a young scientist who believes that anything is okay to do in science, blaming those ""ignorant fascists"" (meaning Christians) who think that any caution in science is unacceptable.  Sarah Polley plays Elsa Kast, his live in girlfriend who feels the same way.

In short what happens is this: these two psychologically compromised people end up creating what looks like Sinead O Connor with a slice in the top of it's head.  As a baby it looks kind of appealing, and that's the cruel ruse of the movie: it wants to warm you up to the idea of this kind of ""science"", and then turn you on your head and stomach for ever having cherished the creature or the characters.  Let's just say that some disgusting things happen between the three (one count of incest, one count of rape), and the whole thing is like black bile.

The ""monster"" is really less a  monster and more a bizarre hybrid human pet that has all the emotions of a living breathing human being.  The scientists end up getting attached to their female creation and name her ""Dren"".

The plot itself isn't all that original, but does keep your attention after the first tedious 20 minutes of the film.  Splice has a basic story structure:  Scientist genetically creates a dangerous monster, with intentions of helping mankind.  Creation escapes the confines of a controlled environment and ends up killing almost everyone.  Kinda same story as Deep Blue Sea, but totally different movie.

You could compare this movie to Species, but its not as erotic nor as violent as Species.  I think the erotic element in this movie could have been stepped up a notch.  After all, having sex with a semi-attractive alien creature, is probably every person's deep down sexual fantasy, whether they want to admit it or not. In my opinion, the scenes where the scientists end up ""getting it on"" with their creation, could have shown more than just their facial expressions. I think Dren could have had more attractive legs, rather than frog legs, which would have made the erotic scenes more believable and appealing.

This movie has a tasteful amount of violence in it. Its not your typical gore, blood splattering, organs spewing horror flick, which puts a cheese factor into most horror movies today anyways.  More emphasis is put into character development and emotional turmoil, which most sci-fi horror movies fail to due, resulting in mind-numbing violence.

Though this is no great movie by any standard it is replete with the possibilities available for the subject. Here you have two romantically entwined gene scientists who grow a female something or other that lives and begins to mature. Now what? Looks like they didn't think that far ahead because things go so far that the situation begins to move under its own weight.

The first act is kind of a drag. They're setting up the story and it involves a lot of science with read-outs, graphics and such, and it doesn't make for a very inviting viewer experience. When the second act starts though things begin to heat up, and as good it is, it also hints at all sorts of things the script doesn't deal with. Such as the fact that they're nurturing an intelligent female being that is maturing rapidly with no hope of ever having a true loving, sexual counterpart. This is also a being that has to be, because of legal issues, hidden from the rest of the world. She will never be part of ""regular"" society. There is also the area of physiology. This being has been created. All sorts of things can go wrong. Do all her parts work in harmony? How will food react with her system? Does she have too many teeth or too few? Will she have a menstrual cycle? Some of these things they deal with a bit, but there is a well spring of items that go untapped.

The third act starts out pretty good but gets a bit too much at the climax. It could have been much worse though. I have to say that watching this movie made me more than a bit nervous. All the things roiling under the surface, but never brought forth, still made an impact on my nervous system.

Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley do well in there rolls but Delphine Chaneac, as the being Dren, was outstanding. Kudos must go to both the art department and special effects department for their realization of the character. She is someone who will not be forgotten once she's been seen.

  Boy was I wrong. So many people wrote that it was a film that only an ""intelligent viewer"" would ""get"" and, honestly, that was the attraction. Here are some examples of how ""smart"" and ""edgy"" this movie is: (Don't worry about SPOILERS - I couldn't finish it)
  This mutant creature is a combination of slug, frog, chicken (I think), fish, a bunch of other things that somehow contributed a venomous tail and an extremely hemispheric skull and these top-notch biochemical engineers deemed it necessary to dress it up in a little girls dress. There is no mention of reproductive organs but with this genetic gumbo I can't see why it would possess any sort of human understanding of gender.  Not just that they call it ""her"" but the li'l blue dress wasn't even appropriate for a human girl - unless she is having tea with her governess and Queen Victoria. I guess the director assumed I wouldn't understand that it was a female without a bunch of overblown frills and silk on its grey and embryonic flesh.
  Oh - and then there are these world-class, elite biochemical genetic engineers working at the magnus ultra of all gene-splicing facilities - However, this particular cutting-edge research facility is lit up with nightclubby moodlighting and the research fellows are all ultra-hipsters wearin' their goin'out clothes and their hair scruffed juuuuust right (for the lighting in the lab).  When Adrian Brody kicks up his feet and stretches out his skinny jeans while noshing on some take-out Chinese with chopsticks (Of course. Of course chopsticks: he's cool) and he's right in the lab next to the next genesis of Science, well, you know these are not your ordinary biochemical geneticists.  In fact:  If you are slightly smarter than a fifth-grader, you know that these are not scientists at all but actors embarrassed with the contract they got themselves into.
  Oh yea! - At one point the mutant ""child"" spells out a word using scrabble tiles.  ""She's making connections!"" the solitary female researcher exclaims.  To whom did she exclaim this? Nobody else was in the room.  She exclaimed it to me, the viewer, because, despite the fact that I just saw what she did, whoever made this movie figured that if I had been watching it this long then I'm probably too stupid to process basic information without on-screen explanations.
  Anyway, that's just a short sampling. This is one of the dumbest movies I've ever watched.  Combine the fashion-lighting of ""CSI"" with the incoherent pseudoscience of ""THe X-files"" and gear it for an MTV-level intellect and you've got ""Splice"".",1288828800,5,2880,4.925465838509317

The low score primarily reflects the fact that, at least for me, Splice fell well short of the film it could have been, not to mention a number of issues I encountered with the plot and characters.

Pacing. What can I say. This movie follows the worn-out trend of having the creature grow at hyper-accelerated rates so that the plot might progress in real time. I suppose it's widely accepted that to jump forward would be too awkward, so, it's just better to try and convince the audience that cellular activity at hyper speeds is completely plausible.

Let's see what else was problematic or just straight up dumb... blobs spontaneously changing sex, the blob fight magically creating the force to pry large metal screws from the floor and tip the enclosure onto the audience, I don't see how anyone could not roll their eyes at that... um, the creature Dren magically evolving from requiring air to breath, to requiring water, then inexplicably to both?

No precedent is ever made for it's sudden ability to grasp word association, or to be able to draw in crayon using a variety of line and shading techniques. Dren possesses fully-functional, bird-like wings with feathers, which magically vanish inside her like Wolverine's claws. It's absurd and, yes, I understand what they were trying to do; she's the product of DNA which has been combined from many different kinds of animals, and so she has wings from a bird, hooves from a deer, a tail from a kangaroo, which possesses a stinger like a scorpion. Her eyes are set wide like a moose, her tongue is long and tapered like a rat's, her arms are thin and boned like a dog's, and her nose is a recombinant of Michael Jackson. Yes, I understand all that, but it creates such logistical problems that I don't have time to delve into them with this review, not to mention all the problems with the bio-physiological characteristics and developments that we are expected to just accept.

Let's talk about the whole Adam and Eve allegory. Deciding to use the oldest archetype in history was the worst idea ever. As a result, the characters are fairly shallow and difficult to like. It didn't take very long before I couldn't have cared less what happened to Elsa. Clive was a little more admirable, but not by much and not for long. So, Adam and Eve, What happens? You've got a forbidden tree of knowledge in the form of recombinant human DNA. It's off-limits. The woman disregards the rules and laws and goes after it. She drags her fiance, Clive, into it as well. The guy, rather than standing up to her and doing what he knows is right, allows himself to become a part of it. So now, the Authority is bearing down on them and they are at risk of being caught, so they hide themselves away, in that old barn. Things go south. She gets impregnated by her, let's consider Dren as her personal ""Original Sin"", and now her offspring will, quite literally, inherit it. This movie's women are dumb, selfish, and without any moral bearings at all, just like Eve. Conversely, the movie's men are equally dumb, in allowing things to happen, even encouraging it. And then Clive gets all weird in the head and we have a near-beastiality to top it off. Ultimately, the woman's actions get her boss, her fiance, and his brother killed. The final encounter with Dren is awful. Not only has Dren magically changed sex, just like the blob creatures, but she/he/it is degenerated into a flying creature that snatches up people, flitting about in the most unnatural and impossible way, as all CG creations seem to inevitably behave.

Isn't this movie billed as being a scary thriller? Yet, there's almost nothing scary about it. Unnerving at times, disturbing even, but never scary and I wouldn't even call it all that thrilling. Any suspense in the film comes as the result of the unshared feelings between Clive and Elsa, not because of any real fear of the creature itself.

Vincenzo Natali requires us to suspend disbelief way too much for a premium, sci-fi thriller. If there's one major ingredient this movie is lacking in, it's plausibility. And, in my book, a lack of plausibility equals a lack of believability, equals a growing disenchantment with every scene.

I really wanted this one to be worth keeping in my collection, but there's absolutely no doubt it's going back to the MTC tomorrow.",1288569600,9,4478,4.7113665389527455

I have to say that when this film first came out other than the crazy looking female in it I wasn't to into it. But of course tha changed when I actually got the chance to see it and my opinion turned around. Don't get me wrong I always wanted to see it but it was not a priority. This film actually turned out to be much better than I thought it would be, in fact I thought it would be just average. I was pleasantly surprise as I thought it was a great flick. Add in that Guillermo Del Toro had a hand in this and you have the potential for a great movie.

Two scientists who are also together work at a company pushing the limits of DNA research; in fact they have created a new species by splicing animal genes together. When they put the new animals together [one male and one female] things go pretty good. But they want to take it a bit farther and add in human DNA to their next project. That of course gives birth to a humanoid like creature they name Dren, which of course is nerd backwards. Clive and Elsa {Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley} have different points of view on this new life form. Elsa views Dren as a daughter and wants to care for her while Clive wants the subject gone, but the views they each have change hands as Dren gets older.

I thought this was absolutely a brilliant film especially the first 's of the film, the ending kinda went down a bit but it was still good. But everything before that was brilliant because Dren really did come off as a human female child. Going threw all the emotions and changes a girl would in real life. It is in this that the relationship between the three elevates this movie in my eyes. Things do get a little crazy here but I was kinda into it mainly because it felt real to me, I thought it moved along pretty good.

Of course the ending of the film while good could have been better in my opinion and some scenes needed a boast. But I did like the performances here from our lead cast, now they did much better in the relationship scenes more so than the scientist scenes but oh well. Adrien Brody did a great job here as did Sarah Polley especially in anything that involved Dren. Of course it was great seeing my boy David Hewlett here even if he wasn't the star, Simona Maicanescu, and Brandon McGibbon were also good here. But it was Abigail Chu as child Dren and Delphine Chaneac as adult Dren that stole the show; they both did a great job.

Director Vincenzo Natali along with fellow writers Antoinette Terry Bryant and Doug Taylor did a great job here for the most part. The story is straight forward and not hard to follow at all but it is still compelling. Now to be honest it is Dren and the performances of the two that played her that really carried this film but all did a great job. There are flaws like with all things but I really liked this one for some reason. I think it is because I waited for the DVD release and had time to let hype die down. So I went into this with out any high expectations and I came out liking it.

I do recommend this film but hit up a rental first because some people will most likely not like this. In fact some people may hate some of the things that happen in this flick, I loved it. When you watch you will know what parts I am talking about, I am sure some already do know. Over all this was much better than I thought it would be.",1288310400,3,3357,4.156923076923077

As it turns out, I was quite surprised at how this movie played out. There were plenty of good icky bug moments. However, as the two scientists dug a deeper and deeper hole for themselves, it was a bit too obvious what would eventually happen. And the revelation about what was in the creature's DNA was not a big surprise either. Dren (the main icky bug) started kind of creepy but became cuddly and even pseudo-erotic as the movie progressed. There was a big clue to what would happen though, when the two blob icky bugs were put on display at a big company presentation. Anyway, suffice to say the icky bug didn't stay nice.

The ending was okay but not quite what I expected. Then again, it could have been much worse, so I'll give the movie points for that.

All in all, it was a flawed but halfway decent icky bug. Probably not for every fan, but I'd still recommend it.",1288224000,2,1073,4.25

4230708,2,B003YKYX7O,"this movie is a big disappointment partly because the science is bad, and partly because the fiction is bad. So these two young scientists who happen to also be lovers, played by Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley, head up a team trying to create new species by spicing together DNA code from unrelated species, with the ostensible aim of ""sequencing"" some DNA that could help cure millions of people from awful diseases, but, in reality because they just like creating monsters. Especially Elsa, the Sarah Polley character. Early on they create a pair of giant writhing maggot-creatures, whom Elsa, whilst filming them calls, ""cute"". The investors/board of directors are getting skeptical about the value of the project, so the geneticists put on a presentation for them, however the maggot-creatures go berserk. Not going to spoil that big surprise, though.

Meanwhile, an even bigger, yet clandestine project is being nursed to fruition by the mad scientists. Because this organism had human DNA spliced in it, it wasn't supposed to go ""that far"" (ethical considerations), but they, especially Elsa just can't resist just finding out ""what if...""  The humanish creature ends up to be a much bigger project than even Elsa planned, and, in the process, much about her maternal neurosis is revealed. Many of the scenes and sequences seem to borrow from better science fiction, all the way from ""Alien"", to ""Rosemary's Baby"", but this movie itself has no really satisfying horror or fiction. Sadly, besides the lack of interesting story, many things were poorly or not at all explained, or were explained in ways that made no sense at all.

So, why is it that we find ourselves delving into realms better left alone? SPLICE is an interesting and perhaps a more cerebral look at the us+them quandry. What is wrong with our species that we have an inate need to ""fix"" stuff? Often, this works to our general betterment.....then, there are the times we should have left well-enough alone!

I am a fan of scifi and the ""alien"" possibilities. In Splice the alien DNA is ours plus other Earthly genes. Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody make a believable couple of ambitious scientists desperately attempting to find a new protein and achieve auspicious merit in the genetics field. Having a corporate timeline nipping at their heels, Clive and Elsa go beyond the point of ethical acceptability and create a new human hybrid. Dren is a quasi-human being of dubious character within an ever-changing form.

Watching the interaction of the scientists attempting to cope with the fallout of their experiment is fascinating. At some point, we must confront ourselves and ask what we would do in this situation. Not only is there conflict between Elsa and Clive, but as things progress also between Dren and her creators. How are we to cope with the unknown? At what point do we pull the plug? What makes us human? What makes us inhuman? Ethics....when did they disappear in the race for glory and/or money?

Splice is not a slasher movie. It takes the scenario and runs with it to some places we would rather never go! This is a thinking person's storyline. If you are so inclined, it makes you ponder where the future of science is headed. Are we ready for the eventualities? Or, to misquote from ""Jurassic Park""...""Just because we can, doesn't mean we should!""

The special effects in this movie are well-done and create a believable creature(s). We can understand how Clive becomes drawn to Dren and how Elsa embraces her own intrinsic mothering instincts. As a creation in CG, Dren works. However, it is the character/personality of this creation which draws us into the plot, rather than the physicality, however appealing.

I advise those who watch SPLICE not to assume anything going in. Do not try to figure it out! Just let the characters and storyline take you to an unexpected place and enjoy the ride. This is a film where the journey is the prize, not the destination!

Finding this little treasure in the theatre, I will end up buying on dvd in the near future. Some ideas are well worth running with and this has given me food for thought. Would love to see a ""Re-Spliced"" as may be promised by the ending : ) Howz about it Sarah? Sequel please! : )

4230716,4,B003YKYX7O,"*May contain spoilers*

I'm still reeling from this movie.  What started out as an interesting plot and wonderful characters, took a deranged turn in the last 1/3 of the movie that I just couldn't stomach.  In fact, I think my first word to describe it was ""brutal"".

Two scientists, Elsa (Sarah Polley) and Clive (Adrien Brody) have done a great job splicing together different animal DNAs to create a creature that gives off healing proteins.  Inspired by their work, they want to take it to the next level and splice human DNA in as well.  The problem is the pharmaceutical company they work for would rather them synthesize the healing protein instead of continuing with their work.  In secret, they decide to continue on their own.

What they create is like no other creature.  She forms at a rapid pace and develops to be very humanoid.  But she is not all human, she also has a stinger, wings, and can breathe underwater.  Despite all these dangerous attributes, the two scientists begin to treat her as a child and care for her as she matures rapidly.  They name her Dren (Delphine Chaneac).

As Dren matures, several things start to go wrong.  They have to move her from the lab to a safer place, Elsa's deceased mother's farm.  Here Dren seems to turn a bit feral, eventually seducing and turning on the scientists as they try to figure out what to do with her.  However, they may just be too late as Dren proves to be very dangerous.

The characters in this film were interesting for the most part.  Clive is somewhat boring but considering he does some pretty wild stuff in this film at other times, I'll forgive him that.  Elsa I would have liked a little more background on.  It was clear the director wanted us to know her childhood was not very great, but he didn't really explain why it was important or what exactly happened.  The clues he gave were vague at best.  And the most important character of all, Dren was vastly complex and most of the time, pretty creepy.  It was amazing to see her develop and change and have her own unique personality.  The movie did a good job of making her seem human like, but still have different feelings and emotions that don't compare to a humans.  There are other side characters in the movie of course, but none play so big a role as to really take interest in.

The concept of the whole movie was great.  I'm sure the die hard scientist type people will find numerous flaws with the way the science was done, but not knowing much on that myself, it seemed believable to me.  They did a great job of showing these characters and the CGI was very well done.  There was a little bit of music in the movie but not enough to really make you notice it.

Now on to the stuff that I just did not care for.  This movie was rated R, which surprised me as there was some pretty deranged stuff in this film.  There are a couple sex scenes (no parts showing but you definitely know what they're doing), a rape scene and some graphic killings.  Aside from the squeamish factor, this isn't a movie for kids at all.  Normally stuff like this doesn't bother me, but for some reason, this movie just upped the disturbing level of these scenes and I didn't care for it at all.

An interesting movie and very well made.  Because its more my own hangups on some of the scenes that made me dislike the movie I'm rating it higher than I normally would with something that disturbed me so much.  I think that's the interesting aspect of the film though, its not often something I know to be fake gives me the ick factor.  This is a very unique take on sci-fi and most fans of the genre should love it, just be warned it is not for the squeamish.",1287446400,,3681,4.406528189910979
4230717,5,B003YKYX7O,"It cannot be said enough, whether in film or books, that experimenting with certain aspects of Mother Nature can produce catastrophic problems with unconscionable consequences. So enter ""Splice"" into that select pantheon of stories that provoke life-altering, ethical consideration with a loud, clanging warning.

I don't much care for Adrien Brody as an actor, didn't know Sarah Polley, but did recognize the Monster element from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein-Qualitas-Classics/dp/1897093519/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein (Qualitas Classics)</a>&nbsp;and was thus hooked. In fact, it's the tailed creature shown in promos which drew me to the film in the first place. You know humans have the physical structure to have had a tail at one point. That tail develops into an interesting part of the creature's anatomy, plus its bird-like physiognomy and its amphibious lungs. Evolution compacted into one beautiful creature.

Yet, every time, whether on the page or in celluloid, let someone experiment with the human element and see what you get. Every time. As one who had taught ""Frankenstein"" in high school English classes, I was pulled into viewing the film despite potential silliness often wrought in such films. Instead, I was absolutely mesmerized, so much so, that after the film ended--very open-ended, I might add--I watched again and picked up nuances I missed the first time.

So, what was so mesmerizing? The idea of splicing human DNA with animal DNA? Enter Dr. Moreau and his entourage of misshapened critters. How about re-animating a creature with component human parts? Yes, Mary Shelley told us about those problems and the pathos of the creature who merely craves acceptance and love. Or Robin Cook's half-human, half-monkey in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chromosome-6/dp/0425161242/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chromosome 6</a>&nbsp;with the brain to speak and think and feel, but physiognomy that required being locked out of sight. However, the Greeks warned us extensively about hubris--that pointedly selfish human element that permeates and poisons human history, both individually and collectively. All these problems merge and re-emerge in ""Splice.""

Elsa, half of this couple, both in the lab and in the bedroom, and Clive, her partner, have produced blobs with the potential of using the DNA proteins of future genetic experiments (new creatures with human DNA) to correct human ills, like MS, cancer, and the like. The pharmaceutical company that underwrites their expenses encourages them to do so. However, the grossly effective scene in which Fred and Ginger (the DNA ""monsters"") horrifies their scientific audience by engaging, not in paramour, but in vicious, to-the-death battle, sets up the second half of the story. Although this scene, protested by some as unnecessary, is, indeed, required because it provides important foreshadowing in horrific plot development to come. Unequivocably.

And so we have ""Splice,"" not simply an entertainment, but a violent commentary on going beyond, eating that denied fruit of the untouchable tree--and, of course, it is the woman who violates all protocol to create something new. Once she breaks the rules--all sorts of rules: common sense, ethical, scientific, religious--there is no going back, no undoing. Oh, yes, excuse me. Clive does try to kill their creation. Yet, once this new species lives, he will, inevitably, step beyond another boundary and taste completely this new fruit. Consequences? Just as in the biblical story: No more garden, no more eternal life, then just problems, problems, and more problems.

Remember&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fatal-Attraction-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00003CXA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fatal Attraction (Special Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;and all the dialog that resulted for weeks and weeks afterward? ""Splice"" is definitely one of those films.

(Note: Really surprising is how good the animation is. In fact, the creature early on looks so real that I kept looking for some clue as to technique, some little slip to show the creature was indeed not real. Nothing looks phony or tacky.

The preview of this movie would lead you to believe that you are in for some sort of Aliens type scifi thriller.

Both Adrian Brody's and Sarah Polley's characters take turns wanting to save or wanting to kill the creature they created. Then suddenly with little to no underlying reason Adrian Brody's character engages in one of the most pathetic, gratuitous, sex scenes ever filmed. After seeing that I think that his Oscar should be taken back by the academy. But the film makers don't stop there, no sir, from that point in the movie the creature dies (this happens every time it is about to mutate, you would think the molecular biologists would catch on to this) then changes from female to male and grotesquely rapes Sarah Polly's character. To top it all off the end scene shows Sarah Polly's character pregnant and signing a contract with the research company. Absolutely horrible. Imagine the story of Frankenstein, then imagine Doctor Frankenstein having sex with the monster, then the monster changes gender and rapes Dr. Frankensteins's assistant.

That's the premise of the movie... Frankenstein meets Ed Wood.

****MAJOR SPOILER BELOW...****

Not that you could spoil such a really predictable movie, but you've been told.

First for a couple of many story problems - Throughout the movie Clive keeps referring to some issue Elsa has with her dead mother but while this seems to be a important part of the movie and Elsa character development it is never reveled what these issues are or what her mother did, no back story, no flashback, nothing - we are left to guess what this big piece of the puzzle might be.

Now briefly on Fred and Ginger two flesh tone land living sea slug cucumber looking things that they designed and made/created - they had both male and female thing and they were all lovey dovey in the lab then later while they showed a big room full of scientist, investors and other in the need to know, Ginger had changed into a male and when they exposed Fred I and Fred II (formerly Ginger) to each other and you guessed it there was a big flesh-tone-land-living-sea-slug-cucumber looking thing fight in front of all these people and somehow these two small dog size creatures can in their struggle create enough force to bust several bolts loose from the floor holding there cage causing it to tip over and splatter enough blood on the members of the audience to fill a elephant. Which again predictably the audience flees as if King Kong broke free. Neither of these two noted great scientist can explain how this happened to the labs bosses - never mind the fact anyone with the Discovery Channel would know there are real lifeforms (fish, frogs, invertebrates) that can change there sex completely, but these two geniuses are clueless to this fact. OK. But not to worry it's not their fault it's the stock Shemp inept brother of Clive who didn't notice the sex change of this land living sea slug, Ginger.

I ask in this day and age how many high tech science labs are devoid of nearly all surveillance cameras? Zero that's how many... but yet Clive and Elsa can sneak Dren (the creature played by Delphine Chanac) out of the place unseen and unrecorded - OK I'll let that slide. I'll even let all of the massive damage to the lab and high tech equipment by Dren go unanswered by Clive and Elsa to the stereotypical money grubbing bosses. However, as the movies moves along Clive goes from wanting to kill Dren as he suddenly developed morals ethics completely absent before all the way to being seduced by Dren and having sex with her as Dren saw Elsa and Clive having sex earlier, but ever so predictably Else walks in while they are getting it on to which Clive goes back to their house to explain - well Elsa sets stewing and the argument last... oh about 30 seconds. On what planet do you get caught screwing around and the fight about it last 30 seconds? Better yet screwing around with some lab created potpourri of DNA? Yeah right! Elsa goes from the I want to be a mother, my clock is ticking to Mommy Dearest in 0.1 seconds and now wanting to kill Dren (perhaps this was Elsa's Mommy issues). Did I mention... Dren found a cat and loved the cat but Elsa takes the cat away stating we don't always get what we want (like a good movie) then feeling bad from her issues in unanswered childhood returns the cat to Dren, but Dren is mad at Elsa and kills the cat with her stinger tail and then try's to kill Elsa with her tail stinger thing and Elsa decides to cut it off only after completely stripping Dren nude for ever reason. Oh yeah the gratuitous nude shot of Dren's tiny breast. Well Dren who has gone through a few rapid metamorphoses already (eyes, legs, arms, aqua lung, wings  but not vocal cords go figure) is now seemingly sick and seemingly dies well with 30-40 minutes left in the movie you know it's not dead. So they bury her behind the barn they were hiding her in - suddenly evil male boss shows up wanting to see it - as Clive's predictably inept brother spills the beans and the boss claims it's the companies property - guess what Dren is not dead and has pulled a Ginger and changed into a male comes up out of the ground and gargoyle like flies from atop the barn and starts killing all the males there which is left unanswered for the rest of the movie - guess it was murder covered up by N.E.R.D. (the name of the lab). Well now Dren takes off and Clive and Elsa go hunting it in the forest and it's always a cliche foggy, smokey dark forest - Dren who has DNA from Elsa catches her in the forest and rapes her... see in movies - men are seduced and women are raped it's in the script in some sort of self incest violation and as you'd expect Clive shows up and tries to kill Dren who as you'd expect grew back it's stinger (duh) and kills Clive... well Elsa now grabs a big rock and smashes Dren's head in we think... you never see the dead Dren. So back at the lab other evil female boss offers Else a bunch of money to keep quite as some compound the lab was needing was created by Elsa from Dren's blood/fluid earlier that will save the lab from closure. Elsa signs the agreement and then stands up and you guessed it she is pregnant, but with who's seed Clive or Dren? Do I smell a Splice II? Yes I think I do and it's sure to be worse than the first.

****END SPOILER****

I left out a few parts so I don't completely ruin it for you but the major points are hit - needless to say that the movie is predictable from start to finish nothing really new here, but in all fairness we enjoyed the movie it was fun to watch, not scary, not really original (man plays God bad things happen plot line), lots of dead ends story lines, undeveloped characters and cliche's, but watchable at least once. Fortunately for me I rented it for only a $1.50 - if I had paid $10-$15 to see it in the theater I'd feel ripped off, so I'm giving it two stars... one for the special effects which were decent and one for not completely wasting my time by providing a few absurd laughs. It's nothing I'll be adding to my collection unless I find it really, really cheap. Watchable, just rent it before you decide to buy or skip it you'll not be missing much.",1286841600,3,7217,4.408102025506377
4230722,2,B003YKYX7O,"I didn't have high hopes for this one going into it. The previews made it look like another cliche Frankenstein's Monster type deal. However, after the first half hour or so I started to feel positive about it. The premise was interesting, the acting wasn't as cheesy as I thought it would be, and it definitely wasn't cliche.

Then something went wrong...so horribly, horribly wrong.

I think the writer/director wanted to break new ground so badly with this film that they went way into left field...so far in fact that you're left thinking...""What the heck?"" I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but let's just say there is one scene in particular that completely pulls you from the movie. Actually, it's more of a throw than a pull.

After this scene, there was very little the movie could do to redeem itself and to be honest...it didn't even try. I think the movie just kind of gave up on itself, kind of like an SNL skit which has an interesting catch but doesn't know how to end itself.

I don't know what else to really say about this movie. I'm still just thinking, ""What the heck?""",1286755200,19,1091,4.522842639593908
4230723,1,B003YKYX7O,"SPLICE is one of those films that should have been so good.  I wanted to like it so badly.  Sadly, the movie falls short of the mark not by mere inches but by giant chasms.  The plot is plodding and slow.  The cast do a fine job, but Adrien Brody is so underused in this film.  He comes off as a ""whipped"" man that has no spine until it is too late.  The creature itself is pitiful and exotic.  I will not give anything away, but as an audience we are asked to make absurd leaps in logic to follow a plot that jumps in silly directions.  It is like the film tries to do too much and never does anything very well.  Skip splice, it is not worth the time.  It is a fine idea poorly executed.",1286755200,3,689,3.927536231884058

The film rushed through as quickly as it could with no real point to make except the same warning that was given to Victor Frankenstein with a bizarre sexual twist..

4230727,4,B003YKYX7O,"I'm not sure why this movie is getting such bad reviews. It is a very interesting movie which touches on a lot of different subjects like science and right and wrong.

The acting of the main characters is great. There is character development throughout and the story is ever developing throughout.

 I thought the special effects were great. The chick who played ""Dren"" was talented in her mannerisms and over-all performance.

I can see why many people dislike this movie after a little over half way through it. Things start to happen which are odd, gross, sick, and just plain wrong. But those things are what keeps the movie going and hold the interest of the audience.

This weekend I watched 4 horror/thriller movies. The Human Centipede, Triangle, Nightmare on Elm Street (2010), and Splice. All were pretty decent movies, but Splice was my favorite out of the bunch.

It is at least worth a rent if you are a fan of the sci-fi horror genre.",1286668800,2,949,4.686746987951807
4230728,3,B003YKYX7O,"What is up with the 2 1/2 star rating (as of this writing)?  Are there really that many religious fanatics out there who are intelligent enough to write reviews on a computer but not intelligent enough to ""get it""?  The moral to the story is that science shouldn't mess with life, life isn't something that can be contained or controlled, and that there will be harsh consequences for doing so (or at least attempting to do so).  And in so trying to create/experiment with life, your morals and ethics will slowly begin to disintegrate.  What was once curiosity soon becomes obsession, and worse.

Anyway, yes, this movie can be predictable.  A lot of movies in the past have used this theme.  Species tends to be the one a lot compare this movie to, and rightly so.  The similarities are obvious, though the movie isn't a rip off.  This movie is an example of what Hollywood should be doing, not doing remakes or rehashes, but putting a spin on something familiar with a different story, and trying to make it stand out and be good on its own.  So how well would it compare to others of the past?  In my opinion, compared to Species, this movie is superior in every way.

That said, no it's not perfect, hence the 3 star rating.  For one thing I was never a fan of Sarah Polley, especially after seeing her replace Jodie Foster in Hannibal, and I'm not the only one who doesn't care for her acting here either.  On the other hand, she is supposed to play as a bitch character, but she did it better in that Nicholas Cage movie ""Next"" (which was also just an ok movie, at best).  Another reason why it's not so good is that you could pretty much tell what was going to happen in the movie before it happened.  And then the final 20 or so minutes of the movie change the pacing/mood too much in the movie.  The same thing could have been accomplished in a more closed out setting, without the running around, without the pointless deaths (save for one), while making it more effective than it was.  But acting, pacing, and foreshadowing aside, this movie did stand out from the average, but it's just a rental recommendation.

Now, as most of you know the story involves splicing genes, creating a creature that has human genes which grows into something that resembles a human along with other characteristics (see the cover), and how that creature deals with its rapidly changing life.  Hence to say we all know that things aren't going to turn out so well.  The two scientists who worked on it in private soon began to lose their sense of ethics as quickly as the creature matures, with Polley's character become abusive in a way similar to her past upbringing, and Brody's character becoming seduced by the creature, which results in the sex scene that gets everyone so riled up about this movie (plus a rape that happens near the end when the creature turns male [foreshadowed by the 2 scientist's earlier project] and has his [or its] way with Polley, who pretty much deserved it after all that's happened).  The thing is, audiences are supposed to be disturbed by the scene.  That was the director's goal!  And yet people bitch and moan about it as if it was like an adult having sex with a minor on screen.

Anyway, with that said, I give the movie 6/10, good to watch once, but then not to see it again.  I'd recommend it as a rental to anyone who's interested in a ""don't mess with nature"" or ""creature"" or ""ethically challenging"" movie for the night.

The plot was predictable and stupid (there is no way two so called scientists would abandon all logic and do the things they did) and the ending was supposed to be ominous, but was just shallow. By then, I didn't care what happened to Sarah Polley's character. She deserved whatever she got for being brain-dead and selfish throughout the film. But, I also didn't feel sorry for the creature because the director never spent enough time trying to get you to empathize with her. All of the characters were very weak.

As far as this movie being some sort of commentary on the struggles of being a parent and having to make tough choices for your children when you know they are ""different"" - that's just bull. There was no moral to this story.

It was just dumb and dumber. Don't waste your money!",1286582400,3,1020,4.562841530054645

However, I wasn't prepared for how DISTURBING this movie ended up being.  And the suspense that it advertised in the previews was, for the most part, nonexistent.  This movie was more liken to ""The Fly"" (which was a much better film) than any other movie I can think of.  Most of the movie involves the 2 scientists pushing beyond the ethical barriers in order to make a scientific discovery that would fund their research and secure their jobs by making their financier wealthy.  I mean, people want to demonize the pharmaceutical companies who spend millions of dollars in research and experimentation to create a drug that is a treatment or cure for incurable illnesses, but expect it to initially be cheap. Somebody has to pay for it, and the Pharmaceutical companies aren't in it for charity.  But, I digress since that is a different subject, but related to part of the story.  Overall the story for the first 2/3 of the movie wasn't great, but wasn't bad either.  However, the last 1/3 was just morally twisted and DEPRAVED on several levels.  I wished I could sponge away the images from my brain after watching it.  And the overall reaction of the audience after the movie was over was ""EEEWWWWWWW! That was really TWISTED!""

Although I'm a Christian man, I have always been a fan of horror movies as long as there done with at least a little good sence or taste. This discusting film left a bad taste in my mouth.

4230742,5,B003YKYX7O,"I offer up this explanation to those who have not yet seen SPLICE and are confused by mixed reviews. There are no spoilers, so confidently read on:

SPLICE has something that most horror/sci-fi movies lack: wit. In order to fully appreciate this movie you have to understand wit. It's not a stupid movie, it's a movie that is smarter than the average movie goer. Yes, the characters make nearly every wrong decision possible, and many of the scenes are humorous, but INTENTIONALLY so! The story is tongue-and-cheek and the actors, screenwriters, and director are in on it, but the audience, for whatever reason, has largely misinterpreted this movie as a serious drama that is played terribly wrong and is unintentionally funny. There are dramatic elements and serious parts, but the bizarre scenarios, in which the dramatic dialogue occurs, create surreal and humorous situations. Again, it's purposefully and intelligently humorous, i.e. witty.

SPLICE is a bizarre movie. It takes a twisted sense of humor to truly appreciate it. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley deliver deadpan performances, providing very analytical and matter-of-fact responses to outlandish and grotesque scenarios. They make every wrong decision possible, because -frankly- if they were to follow the ethical code of conduct for genetic engineers this movie would be 10 minutes long. It's not a realistic portrayal, but a cautionary fantasy. The only way this story can be told is humorously, and -despite what the majority says on internet chat rooms- it works!

I apologize if I sound defensive or condescending, but SPLICE is one of my favorite movies and it's been greatly misinterpreted, degraded, and disregarded. I think its mainstream release is partially to blame and it would have done better in limited run with word of mouth (i.e. Human Centipede). It's just not for everyone, and I am confident that this movie will reach cult status among a weird demographic. I joined the official SPLICE Facebook page and most of the comments have been about how terrible it is! WHAT??? It's supposed to be a fan club!

Cardboard cut outs will do a better acting job. I wish I had my money back, when this movie was over. The ending stinks.

  Welcome to the world of Splice, the horror comedy of the year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Let's face it: science fiction nerds have caught themselves drooling over screen-appealing female space aliens and monsters for years. It probably began when Captain Kirk first had sex with the green slave chick in Star Trek. Even people who never saw the scene have heard about that love-in.

  Later on, Natasha Henstridge came into the sci-fi circuit with her depiction of Sil, a sex-crazed alien/humanoid man-eater, in Species. Many believe that this movie first spawned the notion that if there was ever a good way to go out, it would be during sex...with a boney-looking alien straight from a painting by HR Giger.

  Then recently, countless fan-boys began re-watching Avatar in the hopes of catching Zoe Saldana bare a breast, since she seemed half-naked throughout the movie. Blue skin and four times the size of a human? Bah, who needs to be picky. This is a generation of fan-boys that watched the Snoo-Snoo episode of Futurama and thought, ""Hey, that probably wouldn't be too bad.""

  Which brings us to Splice.

  The movie starts out fairly well. Two bio-chemists, Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast (played by Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley), are in the midst of a huge scientific breakthrough: the merging of the genetic code of every single animal class, except human. They have created male and female versions of what look like giant bloody sponges that move around on their own and create some sort of protein that will be used in pharmaceuticals. The scientists, of course, want to go further, and add human DNA to the mix. The company says, ""No dice."" The scientists do it anyway, and create an ugly-looking gerbil with a wicked tail that, through nurturing and caring, evolves into Billy Corgan(played by Delphine Chanac) at an accelerated aging rate.
  The storyline is very thought-provoking, as Clive and Elsa struggle with the moralistic principles of using human DNA to create an organism, hopes for their future together, and some deep skeletons in the family history. You see the struggles of these people, both internally and externally, as their relationship with Billy Corgan (I mean, DREN) evolves.

  Sounds intense, right? Well, it is. Until Adrien Brody decides to have sex with it.

  Yes, in an apparent loss of judgement, Adrien Brody gets horny, and destroys any semblence of a serious movie by banging his creation, which is almost like his daughter, making it even more perverted. After that, I couldn't stop laughing whenever he came on-screen (mmph).

  Not only does he have sex with DREN, but he gets caught by his screen wife, Sarah Polley. Then he returns home and tries to explain his way out of cheating on her with their mutant spawn. AND IT WORKS!!!!

  From here on out the movie is pure comedy, as you can't help but giggle at Adrien Brody. It ends with DREN turning into a male, raping his mom Sarah Polley(who we learn used her own DNA to construct DREN), and getting pregnant.

  I don't know where I thought this movie was going to go when it was good, but it sure wasn't here.

  I give the movie 2 out of 5 Natasha Henstridge aliens. Everyone else seems to be giving this movie 4 out of 5. Everyone else seems to have mommy and daddy issues, so... there's that.",1283126400,11,3468,4.954861111111111
4230747,4,B003YKYX7O,"The best horror films don't merely provide lots of gore and bloodletting, but tap into the primal fears of human beings, as well as the darkest parts of human nature. ""Splice"" does just that.

Audience reactions seem to be mixed to ""Splice"", and it's easy to see why. ""Splice"" is really more of an art film that has more in common with David Cronenberg's films than mainstream horror fare like the ""Saw"" franchise. The film even stars Sarah Polley, an indie film fixture.

Polley plays Elsa, who, along with her husband and fellow geneticist Clive (Adrian Brody), create a human/animal hybrid in secret, who they later name Dren (""nerd"" spelled backwards, a cute way of the two embracing their science geek status). As in all horror films, playing with mother nature turns out to have disastrious consequences.

Although films have long been using this basic plot that goes all the way back to ""Frankenstein,"" what elevates ""Splice"" is its great script and acting. Elsa and Clive's relationship, which is both collaborative and competitive, facilitates the whole nightmare, as well as Elsa's tragic backstory as an abused, rural kid.

What steals the show, however, is Dren. The film manages to make the creature both childlike, animalistic, and freakishly sexual, which is not only disarming for the audience, but leads to the disturbing plot developments in the film's controversial last act.",1281484800,57,1394,5.074235807860262

I'm not exactly sure why I liked Splice, but I did. Even so, I won't be recommending it to anyone I don't know closely, because it's out there and isn't what most people will be expecting - especially based on its trailer.

If you're envisioning Species, you may be let down. If you're thinking Alien; you could be disappointed. It does however; lie somewhat in-between those two great films. And it's also sprinkled with a hint of the sort of family drama you'd find in The Jerry Springer show. I know - I just lost half of you there, didn't I? Still interested? Okay, keep reading.

Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley play Clive and Elsa; scientists as well as lovers. We quickly move on and accept that their employers are either blind to the fact, or don't seem to care that they are beyond fraternizing. A good deal of the film rests on the shoulders of the merit of their relationship, and their on-screen allure makes those portions believable as well as entertaining; mostly by Adrien Brody. He's such a likeable guy, and a terrific actor.

I'll admit Splice takes it's time getting to the point, but I was never bored with it. The - `two characters in a room for prolonged periods of time' approach was handled with care; and there is a very subtle hint of `what the hell is gonna happen?' - teasing those hairs on the back of our necks for the first 30 minutes or so.

After advisors shut down their project, Clive and Elsa secretly push forward with their experiment of splicing animal and human DNA. There must be some kind of strict Hollywood code in Sci-Fi movies, that forces the writers to script the purpose for DNA splicing to involve `the better of mankind', because it's seems like that's always the reason. It is here too.

If you're not asleep by the end of act one, you may enjoy seeing the creature Clive and Elsa have well... spliced. I've certainly never seen anything like it, and was astronomically impressed. A blend of some barely visible CGI and beautiful make-up effects and voila; an original movie monster at last! The actress they hire to play the thing soon named Dren (Delphine Chaneac), does an amazing job at making her convincing, interesting and somehow even slightly attractive.

If you think you can predict where this film is headed, you may be surprised. It is essentially three films in one; each act taking a sharp turn into something else. Several viewers will despise the third act entirely. While it wasn't my first choice of destinations for the film to take me to, I wouldn't say I had the worst time with it.",1280707200,121,2797,4.664634146341464
4230749,2,B003YKYX7O,"In many horror films people do stupid things, but this film takes the cake. IF there is a correct choice, a bad choice, and a really frick'n stupid choice, you can guess which one they will take.
I like films where it's fun, and stupid (crank, A-Team, or ZombieLand, for example), but I like at least one or two times in the film where people would do what a normal person would do.
Even ""Bad Santa"" fails to push you as far as this film does.

Choice: Make the hybrid, or not.... make it.
It attacked you. Kill it, or keep it..... keep it.
It attacks your friend. Kill it, or Keep it.... Have sex with it.
You've come to kill it, but it looks sick. Kill it, or try to nurse it to health..... nurse it.
It's dead. Chop it up for testing, burn it, or bury it in a shallow grave..... shallow grave.
Stab it with a giant stick, but it's not dead. Stab it again, or wait...... Wait for it to pull the stick out and kill you.
You smashed it's head with a rock, after it raped you, but it's still alive. Wait again, or keep smashing? .... wait just long enough for it to kill your friends, then smash.
It raped you. Have the baby? .... sure, why not.

Species was much more exciting, and intelligent...... I can't believe I wrote that...... i just called Species ""Intelligent""..... well.... compared to THIS film... it's ART.",1280188800,15,1319,4.293172690763052
4230750,4,B003YKYX7O,"Ahhh, how long has it been since you've seen a current horror film that really engaged your mind as well as your nerves? Not since The Descent, as far as I can remember, and it turns out this film has even more going on in the brains department. It's also genuinely creepy and funny, although truth be told, not as scary as some others. But who cares?

We begin with clever little animal skeletons that form into logos. After the credits, the camera literally is born, coming out through the birth canal to greet our two geneticists, Clive and Elsa [named after two actors from Bride of Frankenstein]. They have created these two living lumps of flesh from the DNA of various other animals, for the purpose of deriving new pharmaceuticals from them. They are big shot scientists, featured on the cover of Wired, and they want to take the next step and start using human DNA. But no--they get shut down in order to process the new products they've just made. In spite, Elsa makes a special splice of human and animal DNA and throws it in an incubator.

That night they talk about having a baby, and Elsa says she doesn't want to go through childbirth. In a matter of days their creation is ready to be born, and looks like gigantic sperm. In a few days it dies, but turns out it has spawned a cute little thing that's like a cross between a bunny and a naked mole rat. Elsa begins getting attached to it and treating it like a child almost immediately. Clive doesn't like the whole thing one bit, but is basically a giant wuss, while Elsa is domineering and emotionally manipulative. Soon Elsa is taking the protection off of Dren's [that's what they name her] poison-tipped tail, and treating her like her own special child. When someone else at the lab sees, they take her out and hide her in Elsa's mother's farm. Not long after this it is noted that Clive and Elsa haven't done the deed in quite some time.

Now if you want to see this movie, which you should, I would advise you to skip the spoilers until you do. Especially because there's lots of crazy insane sexual stuff coming up, and it might be fun to be taken by surprise.

SPOILERS > > >
So they come to show the first two creatures to investors, when suddenly the creatures fight each other to [literal] bloody pulp! THAT was a surprise, and it gets a big shocked laugh when the whole front row gets spattered in blood. Uh-oh, funding for their projects is a thing of the past, unless they can figure out what went wrong. You see, it would seem that after the two beasties had sex, one of them switched sexes, and the female became male. So it's back to work for Clive and Elsa--but they have a big problem at home to worry about.

Dren is now a full-grown young woman, and wants to go outside. She's also developed an appetite for flesh, which Elsa sees and yet denies. Polley does an excellent job of portraying Elsa as an extremely damaged woman with a large capacity for self-delusion, while still remaining understandable and human. She also starts morphing into her own difficult mother, taking away the cat Dren has adopted, trying to bond while teaching Dren how to apply makeup[!], and jealous over finding a number of drawings of Clive--but not her. Dren, it seems, is becoming quite attracted to Clive, and you'll recall which couple hasn't had sex in quite a while. Oh, and by the way, Clive suddenly realizes that the human DNA Elsa used to create Dren was her own.

Now here come serious spoilers, which normally I wouldn't include, but we need them to discuss the whole subtext happening here. Nevertheless, you may want to skip past the spoilers at this point and come back after you've seen the movie.

Clive comes home, Elsa is gone, and Dren comes on to him, hard. He tries to resist, but ultimately gives in--and you KNOW who walks in at that very moment. This, and the Jerry Springer confrontation that follows had a large portion of my movie audience laughing uproariously for quite a while, which I didn't mind, as they were just enjoying and getting into the movie. But here comes a significant line, when Clive tells Elsa she should have thought thrice about adding her own DNA given ""what she knows about her family history."" We have also earlier heard Elsa describe her mother as ""crazy"" and learned that she has SERIOUS issues about coming back to her childhood home, where many awful things happened. She chops off Dren's stinger, and takes it into the lab, where she synthesizes the necessary protein [for their funding] in a snap. Soon after, Dren dies. They bury her. Then, she digs her way out of the grave--and is now MALE.

There follows a final battle, during which the now-male Dren rapes Elsa and kills Clive before being killed herself. There is a final scene back in the pharma office, where we learn that Dren's body has led to a number of discoveries, and Elsa signs an agreement for what we are to assume is giga-dollars in exchange for having DREN'S BABY, that she is now pregnant with. The last image of the film is the company representative and now owner of Elsa's baby, who is styled in a rather traditionally mannish way, standing at a window embracing the pregnant Elsa, both of them looking very much like an expecting couple.

There are a number of subtle clues that part of Elsa's troubled youth and problems with childbirth stem from her having a child via incest that died. This explains Clive's comment about how she should have known the issues that stem from combining similar DNA ""given her family history."" So Dren has her DNA, say 50%, and when Dren switches sexes and impregnantes Elsa, the resulting child would have near-total incestuous DNA. As my friend said ""Dren becomes Elsa's own father."" This is continued by the last image, where the company representative is shown in the manner of the father... and who is, in some thematic way, the father. So the whole movie becomes this giant mobius strip of incestuous offspring generating even more of themselves, and a statement that in this age of genetic engineering the question of who is the actual parent of these offspring becomes very murky. Not to mention the even more relevant idea of responsibility: if there are a number of parties providing funding or encouraging troubling research or actually doing the work, which one is ultimately responsible for the result? And if everyone is... it kind of means no one is.
< < < SPOILERS END

Not like we don't have enough issues going on here with all the thorny issues of parental responsibility and boundaries, Oedipal attraction, maternal passive-aggression and family mental illness. This is one of those movies that is exciting and maintains interest because of its ideas and how it expertly establishes a set of concepts, then continually throws wrenches into its ideological mechanisms.

That it has so many ideas is exactly the problem it faces at the end, when its climax can only come off as a bit rote. But I think this is because the whole movie that has come before has been packed with so many ideas and interesting character points that the last few minutes, with its need to wrap the whole story up in an action-packed way, can't really hope to live up to. Not to mention that the film introduces a major thematic element right at the very end that, given the needs to wrap up the story, can't be given the time the new development deserves. But these are quibbles.

Overall the movie is quite fine, moves quickly, is intelligently written and directed, wonderfully acted, has stunning special effects [the creature seems quite fleshy, real and THERE in a way that brings back the old ""How did they do that?"" wonder], and yeah, it's one of the better things, of any genre, I've seen in quite a while.",1279843200,9,7747,4.613933236574746
4230751,3,B003YKYX7O,"This movie is not for the faint-hearted movie-goer. For those looking for something original with a dash of sci-fi horror and sexuality, this is the movie of the year. It's terrifying conclusion and other moments manage to cover up some of the more lax parts in the plotline, but they are sometimes still recognizable. Nonetheless it pulls the coup-de-gras for making you feel awkward in brand new ways you wouldn't want to revisit without good reason.",1279756800,,452,4.9605263157894735
4230752,4,B003YKYX7O,"Like it's title, Splice has elements of many science fiction horror stories: Frankenstein, The Island of Dr. Moreau, The Fly & Species. Two genetic scientists played by likable leads Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley play with fire and create an animal/human hybrid, but are unprepared for the consequences wrought by the female creature born of their lapse in ethics.

It won't end well.

  Very much in the Cronenberg venereal horror mold, this movie likes to push shock buttons by combining weird science, sex and horror. It's certainly not for everyone, and some will be offended, but those who have a taste for such things will be rewarded by it's bold and perverse choices.

  Splice is not without some flaws. Neither lead characters is very sympathetic and one doesn't quite buy them as scientists - the actual science seems glossed over and simplified. There are lapses in plausibility, especially regarding the ability to keep their creation hidden within the lab where they work. The writing is somewhat uneven: underwritten is some places and overwrought in others. On the whole, it feels somewhat rushed.

  But Splice has so much going for it - it's strange themes of science versus human compulsion and dysfunctional parenthood - it's ability to be not just frightening, but provide twists which end up being deeply unsettling - that it's definitely worth the time. For all it's creepy, exploitative shock tactics - at it's heart, Splice is really just a good old-fashioned monster movie.",1279238400,5,1499,5.056910569105691
4230753,4,B003YKYX7O,"Adrien Brody is one of those actors that can go either way for me. He stands alone as one of the best if you are judging him from his performance in the Pianist. Alternatively, he is starring in the upcoming Predators, which has not been released at the time of ts writing but is fairly reasonable to assume will not be critically well received. Splice stands somewhere in the middle, not award-winning material but something which is virtually guaranteed a cult following. Brody plays a scientist who specializes in splicing DNA, who along with his partner and lover, played by Sarah Polley, fresh off their success with two blob like creatures named Fred and Ginger, decide to splice human DNA with that of a variety of animals. Well, it's really her idea but Adrien Brody's lax, nervous character does not choose to stop her.

The result is a sack of gelatinous material, an egg sack bearing a creature which the pair names Dren (nerd backwards, get it?). Dren is at first something resembling a weasel, and despite Brody's character Clivr's multiple protests of keeping it alive, Polley's character convinces him that the creature will age remarkably quickly and that it will be dead soon enough.when zdren is tee height of a five year old, they put her in a dress and the audience begins to empathize with her as a mostly human character, relatable in a bizarre way.

  As Dren matures the scientists encounter problems with her breathing, her size, her behavior among a whole host of others. Eventually an almost fully mature Dren is moved to an abandoned barn owned by Polley's family. Here is where the film finds it's voice as we watch this alien mature and begin to question her position in the world. The character is tragic because the question begins to emerge: is it right to make a life purely for science?

  The flaws if Splice are twofold, Sarah Polley turns in an at best mediocre performance with occasionally ridiculous motivations. Brody carries the film, despite the fact that the lack of assertiveness his character practically exudes is sickening. Finally, the film takes a needlessly violent turn in the last fifteen minutes that steps too far from the subtle base established for the majority of the film. And without spoiling anything, there is a stupidly gory scene in the middle of the film not involving Dren at all.

  Within the picture this film paints, it's flaws are minimal at best. It carries a fairly high recommendation from me if you can stomach blood and playing with the laws of nature.",1277683200,20,2529,4.793103448275862
4230754,3,B003YKYX7O,"I hope there is a director's cut of Splice.  I really, really, REALLY hope with the DVD it will be like 2007's I Am Legend and have on a bonus disc the film's original ending.  Why do I say this?  Well, I haven't researched much, but Warner Brothers once again - just as in I Am Legend - has a decent sci-fi movie that ends on a low-note.  I'll put it this way: up until the final 15 minutes I thought Splice was one of the best science-fiction films I'd ever seen.

Just about everything in Splice works up until it reaches a generic, action climax.  Great acting from the cast and a sympathetic creature make the film a compelling sci-fi drama.  One of the best I've ever seen.  An easy 5/5 movie....until suddenly some executive seems to have decided the film needed to transform into a horror creature-feature in the last fifteen minutes.  It becomes so generic and predictable in these last 15 minutes and....terrible.  I can't see any explanation for this other than Warner Brothers repeating I Am Legend.

Dren (the creature) was NOT a monster.  She was a fascinating individual creature that I could feel sympathy for.  The way Clive (Adrien Brody) and Elsa (Sarah Polley) interact with Dren is very powerful.  You can tell that the characters come to love Dren and that Dren cares about them, making for a tragic, yet powerful ending to the film...until the before mentioned last 15 minutes appears which almost completely ruins this drama.

Now, seeing as the film will be released on DVD/Blu-Ray I'm hoping to see an addition with ""Controversial Original Ending!""  (by controversial they of course mean the GOOD ENDING).  I will re-evaluate the film at such a time as an alternate cut is released.  I refuse to believe that Guillermo del Toro, the writer of Pan's Labyrinth (who is the executive producer of Splice and someone who praised the script) could have supported a script that shoots itself in the foot in the ways that Splice manages to in its final 15 minutes.

When Splice is released on DVD/Blu-Ray please, please, PLEASE hold out for a cut with the ""original ending"".  It may save you some money to buy a single-disc theatrical cut but please do NOT support WB's altering movies to make them ""more marketable"".  Splice is a great sci-fi movie that is destroyed by a lackluster ending that is entirely inappropriate given the dramatic nature of the rest of the film.  Tell Warner Brothers, and other companies that we want movies to have the endings that work FOR that particular movie.  Splice was NOT intended to be a horror movie and as such WB/producers shouldn't have attempted to transform it into one with 15 minutes of sub-par creature-feature footage that destroys the poignant beauty of the rest of the film.",1277510400,4,2742,4.714285714285714
