4107328,4,B003BQ1HPC,"I almost didn't buy this since I dislike 4:3 on my 120"" 16x9 screen, but fortunately Amazon's description is wrong. Hopefully they'll get that corrected.

I agree with Hawks' review of the performance. All here are having a great time. Nice to see mature, top-notch musicians having fun on stage, not just ringing the cash register.  Chickenfoot works a a band, with no whiff of it being a one-off side project.  Hope they can continue with this line up for more releases.

Picture quality on blu-ray is excellent. Fine detail is well rendered. Editing / production is good. No rapid-fire scene changes, good camera time on all four artists, not just vocal and guitar like some dvds. Occasional lip-sync issues on the blu-ray, but I've seen much worse.

My only gripe is unconventional and inconsistent audio mixing. The mix appears to be a studio reconstruction recorded from the sound board feed rather than a concert mic'd soundtrack. The vocal, bass and drums are spread across the front/center channels, guitar in all channels, with the guitar emphasized and delayed in the back channels for a surround effect rather than a typical concert band-in-front, audience-in-back approach. Most of the time you hear Joe more from the rear channels than the front, even with the delay. The crowd sounds are often stronger in the front(!) channels than the rear. Sounds OK, but odd since it's a sound field you'll never hear at a concert. (It's almost as if Joe was playing at the opposite end of the venue with the crowd in the middle.) I've got 50+ dvd/blu-ray concert discs and never have heard this kind of mix. Not necessarily bad, but it is unusual.

Also, the instrument balance is occasionally uneven. On one track, Michael's bass is audible on the DTS mix, but disappears on the 5.1 Dolby Digital mix. Kickdrum is excessive on some tracks, normal on others.

Overall, I'm delighted to see Chickenfoot on blu-ray - I wish other established artists could get more blu-ray releases (e.g.: Bruce Hornsby-Three Nights on the Town), but often get dvd only. I'm grateful that they spent the money they did on this production, given the market.

Let's all hope for more blu-rays like this!",1273795200,3,2185,4.870619946091645
4107329,5,B003BQ1HPC,"I received this yesterday and already watched the concert twice and the documentary once.  For $11.99 this blu ray is an incredible value.  Well worth it just for the documentary alone!  The concert is the best...energetic, entertaining, and LOUD!  Satch (or Smoke as Sammy calls him) is great to watch...especially in a band setting, he is in great form throughout.  Mike ignites the bass as always, Chad Smith pounds the skids to death...and Sammy, well Sammy just gets better and better.  It was also great to see most of the studio album performed...seriously Down the Drain just jams, Smoke smokes live on this track!  All-in-all a great concert, and an especially great value for $11.99, not to be missed.",1273363200,3,711,4.92436974789916
4107330,5,B003BQ1HPC,"I own quite a few blu-ray concert videos and this one is my new favorite. Elements from most everyones favorite bands collide for one heck of a rock band. The documentary segment on the dvd is hilarious. I haven't even bought the cd yet but now I'll be sure to go get it. The interview with Michael Anthony almost made me choke on my popcorn! Too funny. Chad just pummels the skins and a few bandmates, and Joe sounds like he's finally in a real rock band, Michael is the greatest back up singer, and Sammy is still an amazing front man that still sounds like he did in the 70s with Montrose. This is a ""must buy"" for anyone who is a fan of ANY of these guys! What are you waiting for?!?!?!?",1273190400,6,691,4.164179104477612
4107331,5,B003BQ1HPC,"Picked this up yestereday and I was literally blown away.  Just absolutely fantastic.  The Sound was incredible and the camera work and angles provided for the concert were amazing.  IMO it was the best Concert DVD I have ever seen.  Seeing this in HD....Sa-weet.

I am a Huge 'Foot fan, so I am bound to be biased about the group itself, but the production of the concert was breathtaking.

Any disappointments?  One:  ""Running Out"", was not included in the concert.  My one negative is related to what was NOT included rather than what was shown.

The boys were simply electric on stage and I have NEVER seen a band performing live, that looks like they are having this much fun and the times of their lives, as Sammy, Joe, Michael and Chad were.  They displayed the energy and enthusiasm of kids in their early 20's.  Nothing forced or robotic or scripted about the concert.  Simply emotional energy.

The Behind the Scenes piece was equally amazing.  And I DEFY anyone here, to hold back any amount of laughter when they see Chad do his impression of Sammy........ Aerobizing, to ""Get It Up"".

I literally thought I was going to wet my pants.

An absolute MUST HAVE for anyone who is a 'Foot fan.

4107332,5,B003BQ1HPC,"Van Halen alumni Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony, Red Hot Chili Pepper Chad Smith and guitar god Joe Satriani - collectively known as Chickenfoot - released their self-titled debut album last year and now comes their first live DVD. Shot in HD with 16 cameras in Phoenix, AZ at The Dodge Theater on September 23rd, 2009, Get Your Buzz On Live is an absolute must see! The 13-song set features all but one of the songs from their CD (`Runnin' Out' is missing) as well as `Bitten By The Wolf' - a track exclusive to the vinyl version. Treating the fans to something special, `Down The Drain' is returned to its original jam session format and Hagar straps on the guitar for `Future In The Past'. The `Foot also rock out Sammy's old Montrose classic `Bad Motor Scooter', in addition to The Who's `My Generation' - which ends with Smith smashing his drum kit to pieces in true Keith Moon style. The light show is superb, the performance is punchy and energetic; rock `n roll doesn't get any more genuine than this. Perhaps the most remarkable part of the concert is how much fun these four are having on stage. The smiles on their faces are proof positive of the enjoyment Chickenfoot generates. Then comes the hour-long bonus documentary. In a word: hilarious. Chad takes to the streets, conducting rogue interviews with the unsuspecting public. Sammy drives a Smart Car to visit former Grateful Dead singer Bob Weir at home. Michael and Adam Carolla of The Man Show share chicken wings while Spinal Tap's Nigel Tufnel interrogates Satriani. Add to that footage of Chickenfoot visiting and performing at The Rock `N Roll Hall Of Fame in Cleveland, OH as well as clips from a gig in Atlanta, GA and a photo gallery. Topping it all off is a 16-page black and white booklet. Much more than just a souvenir from the show, Get Your Buzz On Live truly brings home the magic.",1272758400,42,1865,4.620481927710843

I'm not wsaying I would have given them a free pass if the DVD ended up being a disappointment. I'm saying I really wanted it to be GOOD, and it IS.

I had seen the clips for ""Down The Drain"" and ""Bad Motor Scooter / My Generation"" on YouTube and decided I needed to get a copy of the full DVD.

It LOOKS great, it SOUNDS great. These guys seem to genuinely enjoy playing together...their enthusiasm, coupled with great lighting and camera angles, makes it fun to watch as well as listen. Really no need to analyze it beyond that...if you like hard melodic rock and have followed the individual careers of the band members, you will absolutely get your money's worth here.",1377302400,,846,4.314465408805032

Excellent camera shots show the excitment and energy of this performance. Satrioni plays great. Hagar screams his well-known Daltry style. Chad ponds the skins. Anthony appears to be having the time of his life...
The sound quality and song selection are excellent. They even end on a WHO classic (MY GENERATION) that Chad's original band (Toby Redd) used to perform at all the rock clubs in the Detroit area way back in the 70's (before I was even born). Rock on, Chickenfoot!",1336608000,,641,4.889908256880734

4107362,5,B003BQ1HPC,"I've had this DVD now for around 6 months and have watched it probably 5 times or more.  Having seen the Foot in Denver in 2009, I knew what the show was like and just wanted to be able to see it again and again.  If you're a fan of great, fun rock & roll you'll like this a lot!  You can tell these guys are just having a great time playing together, and Sammy is always a great front man.  Satriani's riffs sound awesome on CD and it's even more fun to watch on video.  The whole band just meshes really well.  I only wish they'd created this band 10 years ago so I could hope for more music from this band.  I've been a fan of all these guys, and the other bands they were or are in as well.  So I guess that should be taken into consideration.  In short, the video is great.  Pretty much just like the concert was in Denver, which is what I was hoping for.  There are a few ""additions"" to the set list in the video though. Sammy plays a song or two from his Montrose days, and there's an extra cover song on the DVD that wasn't played in Denver.  All sounded great though.  Can't wait for the next CD and tour!",1311724800,2,1114,3.963963963963964
4107363,3,B003BQ1HPC,"Pretty much everything everyone said here is true - this is a raw/unchained performance complete with Sammy's swagger and Satch's skillz with a pristine image on blu ray, the problem is more or less what hinders the cd, the songs just aren't very good. Not really even sure WHY you'd put out a concert disc when you only have ONE album out.. They could have at least tapped ONE song from each members old groups, and they do include a couple of non Foot tunes but they don't amount to much. Understand I am a RABID fan coincidentally of both Sammy and Satch and I can see they have a sort of odd couple chemistry but again it all comes down to the SONGS. Thankfully Satch has seen fit to give me his best work yet with Wormholes and I'll just have to wait for another Foot album to see if they can't craft songs with a bit more hook.. but as it stands this is a purchase I made with few regrets but also little replay value.",1305072000,8,924,4.196629213483146
4107364,5,B003BQ1HPC,"I caught an edited (shortened) version of this DVD on the Palladia channel on cable the other night and after watching it I really wished I had caught these guys live on the tour.  The songs are tight yet a lot of fun.  I am not a huge fan of Chad (hate the Chili Peppers, at least the last 10-12 years of them), but I may be converted.  Sammy - what can you say - legend.  Joe - amazing to watch him play.  Michael is just pure fun too.

I think this DVD really shows what amazing musician's these guys are, not only as a band but as individuals.  Joe just shreds and it is fun to watch him in these environment vs. his solo stuff.

Highly recommend. I am thinking of picking up the DVD as the cable version cuts out about half the songs.",1304553600,,739,4.013698630136986

This is such a step forward unlike firing your only back up singer/bass player and replacing him with your 16 year old for the tour.
This band is firing on all cylinders and not that I've ever been a big Michael Anthony fan, but he does a really good job.
Better drummer, and better vocals make this a really good band.  Better vibe, and better singing make this big fun.
Chickenfoot is a good band of seasoned professionals playing what they are comfortable with: good music.
Sammy is a great front man, and at 62 hasn't lost anything weight notwithstanding.

This DVD captures Chickenfoot in all their rock glory with awesome playing from all the guys and alot of great interplay between real musicians. The picture is sharp, the sound is crystal clear, and the editing is excellent. Great views of all the band and their playing styles and excellent lighting throughout the show round out the package. Joe Satriani and Chad Smith are a perfect match in the band situation - both intense performers. Sammy's vocals are melodic and fun. Mike's bass playing is solid and his backing vocals are absolute gold. The bonus footage is hilarious with lots of backstage interviews and a cool roaming microphone by Chad Smith! I thought their album was awesome and gave it the full 5 stars and now I'm giving the full 5 stars to the equally brilliant companion DVD.

I've got over 130 quality concert (standard) dvd and blu-ray and despite this not having a true HD or master audio hd sound-it is still impressive and worthy of a 5 star review for the sheer joy of the energy in the show, culminating with drummer Chad Smith's tearing up his drum set ala Keith Moon on the encore of My Generation. 90 minute set is as much as you need to get your BUZZ on!!!

4107380,5,B003BQ1HPC,"The quality of the video is very good, as it should be with a blu-ray.  But, if you're buying the blu-ray mainly to get the uncompressed, superior sound, save your money and buy the DVD instead.  I just assumed (my bad) that it would have HD sound on a music blu-ray and should have read the review better.  Don't really understand the point of not putting out the blu-ray version with upgraded sound.  Still giving it four stars though, because it still sounds good and looks fantastic.  The band puts on a great show and Sammy still rocks!  It would have been interesting if they had thrown in more of the old Van Halen, Sammy, or Satch songs, but we've all seen those on other DVDs.  Good purchase, especially for the price, but I was hoping for more on my first foray into a concert blu-ray.

UPDATE TO MY REVIEW:  I apologize for an incorrect comment on the HD sound.  The blu-ray menu and the box do not state DTS-HD, but if you look at what is streaming from the blu-ray if you set the sound to ""DTS 5.1"", you're actually getting DTS-HD MA 6.1.  I know blu-rays are still fairly new, but you think someone could have spent 5 minutes to changing the text on the menu to the correct thing instead of obviously just using the menus from the DVD!  Changing the rating to 5 stars.",1275350400,,1282,4.340336134453781

4107382,5,B003BQ1HPC,"This was a great DVD - from music to video. One of the things that stands out is the quality of the video shoot. I have purchased other concert DVD's in the last year (like Kansas) and the frenetic camera work made me sick, especially the fly-in's. This DVD focuses on Satch when he's soloing, and is just well directed. I watched the Foot streamed not long ago and Sammy was quite high. Not as much fun. This video is professional throughout. Michael Anthony is just jamming and singing his heart out too.",1273881600,,506,4.451612903225806
