8277921,5,B001AJT2UO,"As a big time enthusiast of interval training, I picked up this DVD which is now the second DVD that I own from this series.  I found that it wasn't as demanding as the Time Trials DVD that I own, but it was still a good workout.  It is more about training your body/system for MTB, which has hills, drops, heart rate is up, down, etc.

It may be a little old now, but overall if you take this video and actually use it, and were to increase your resistance as you get better.... it will make you stronger.",1258761600,,506,4.090909090909091
