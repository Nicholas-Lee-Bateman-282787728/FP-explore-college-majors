1656828,5,B00005RIXI,"I love the 1st program on this dvd...the instructor sounds so nice and encouraging..and when her assistant folds all the over to the ground in a stretch  you can tell she's amazed but says we may not go as far as him but that's ok...those words and the look on her face really made me enjoy the workout and stick with yoga. I haven't done the 2nd program (I like the 1st one too much!) but this one is a little different than some of the other yoga workouts...it's almost like just stretching. I like to do this one after I walk or I'm already warmed up. you start seated and do some twists to each side and really hold them a long time. then stretch each leg one at a time and to the side, forward bend with both legs out, cat and a very long downdog (feels like it goes on forever..had to work up to this and still don't always hold it the whole time) and some lunges with other  leg on the floor...overall a very nice stretch and no standing poses other than downdog, and you get to it from your knees in cat pose.",1090713600,16,1017,4.105527638190955
1656829,4,B00005RIXI,"I have never practiced yoga before.  This is my first yoga video I have ever purchased, so I don't come from an extensive and knowledgeable background.  However, I have been reading various yoga books and found this DVD well worth the price (I bought it used for only $9).
  The video at first seems cheesy, but get you get over that pretty quickly if you have an open mind.  The instruction is clear and the yoga concepts behind the movements are very well explained.
  Overall, the DVD is very short, but I find it a great way to squeeze in a stretching routine in a busy day.
  I would recommend this DVD to those who are looking for basic hip, hamstring, rib, shoulder, and lower back flexibility (this is what the DVD focuses on).  If you are looking for a more complete full body stretch routine this is not the video for you (unless of course you want to supplement this with other DVD's).",1073520000,34,896,4.408536585365853
1656830,4,B00005RIXI,"There are 2 workout sessions that are maybe 15-20 min each. I think the instructions were good, quality was good. If you are looking for a longer workout, look elsewhere but if you are want a basic stretch workout you can squeeze into your day this may be for you. The poses are basic to intermediate - this is more stretching style yoga rather than strengthening or power yoga. I enjoyed the 2 sessions but wish they were longer.",1054166400,32,430,4.455696202531645
1656831,4,B00005RIXI,"I am in my mid-thirties and am finding I am losing some of my flexiblity. This video is easy-to-follow, and after one week, I find myself more flexible than before. Yoga Zone workouts are a great value, as the other reviewer stated. For your money, this is the way to go.",1052611200,30,271,4.333333333333333
1656832,4,B00005RIXI,"I am new to the world of Yoga and I have slight scoliosis (abnormal curvature of the spine). While I have no trouble with things like the cobra and cat stretch, I do have trouble sitting up straight - I either hunch forward or arch back when I sit. After trying the video, I can feel an increase in my general flexibility and find myself, throughout the day, reminding myself to sit up straight so my body can better utilize my oxygen and I just plain look better. I look thinner, too, when I don't slouch (slouching allows your stomach to ""bunch"" or ""pooch.""). I don't consider this to be a workout, though. I recommend it for either waking up or end-of-the day stretch, right before you curl up with a good book and cup of hot tea. The technicalities of the video - scenery, instructors, shooting angles, etc. - I found to be nondescript and average - which is probably good for a workout DVD. I pay attention to what I'm doing, not wishing I had some Barbie Doll's flat stomach or the cool workout suit she's wearing.",1052265600,61,1020,4.402116402116402
1656892,3,B00005RIXI,"I think this DVD is okay, but one to rent occasionally from your local library rather than purchase. The instructor barely pauses to take a breath the entire program. Her tone and cadence plus a rather stimulating music background make for an agitating routine rather than relaxed enough to ensure there are no injuries during this routine. Its pushing it a bit for beginners esp as the student or person beside the instructor is terribly flexible. His positions are for the very advanced.",1337040000,,489,4.903614457831325
1656893,5,B00005RIXI,"This dvd was great!  I have gotten very stiff over the last decade and was having trouble with flexibility.  When I did the stretches on this dvd, it really helped.  I became more flexible and no longer feel the stiffness.  I felt a HUGE difference in only a week.  I would definitely recommend this dvd for anyone who is very stiff and wants more flexiblity.",1260921600,,359,4.461538461538462
1656894,5,B00005RIXI,"I've been using stretching videos since the late 80's. Remember Kathy Ireland? I'm 50 and still make stretching a regular part of my exercise routine. I especially like this one. As with all the Y.Z. DVD's the cueing is excellent. The first session is very gentle and is a good lead into the second if you have time to do both. In the second Douglas uses bound chair to stretch rather than strengthen and teaches how to benefit the most from Warrior II. And to hear him say ""Beauuutiful, Suzanne."" just adds to the upbeat tone of this video on the beach in sunny Jamaica.",1245801600,,571,4.447619047619048
1656895,2,B00005RIXI,"This DVD is too easy for me, even if i'm a beginner.
I'm fairly young - 30 - but i need something more challenging.
It's also pretty short, The 2 sessions must last about 40minutes total.
I would have expected at least 1h of yoga.",1226793600,,230,4.133333333333334
1656896,3,B00005RIXI,"Don't buy this DVD if you are looking for a full workout.  This doesn't make you sweat or even get into any real yoga techniques.  The DVD consists of two 10-minute segments, which touch very briefly on some basic stretching principles.  None of the poses are even held long enough for you to get any real benefit from them, if this is your sole source for guidance.  I use this DVD after doing other workout routines to complete my cooldown and stretching.  I find most exercise videos do not provide adequate stretching at the end of the workout.  So I throw this in and get a little extra stretching for my muscles.  It helps to chill me out and cool me down after tough cardio or aerobics.  That is all this DVD is good for.  I don't even see how it could improve your overall flexibility in the long run, given its short duration.  But hey, doing something is better than doing nothing.  And maybe these 10-minute bites will entice you into investing in a more in-depth DVD.",1203552000,,979,4.443820224719101
1656897,5,B00005RIXI,I know nothing about yoga and just finished this workout for the first time.  The first session is great with simple instructions and nothing too difficult.  It went by so quick that I finished both sessions thinking it was still the first one split into two smaller sessions.  I am excited to continue improving with this DVD so that I can move on to slightly more advanced ones.,1179187200,,380,4.5588235294117645
1656898,4,B00005RIXI,"I must be flexible, because I found the exercises very easy to do.  The format is easy to follow, and they explain the stretches very well.  I've never done yoga before, and wanted to increase my flexablility but found these too easy.  Next time I'll try the next step up.  All in all, this was a great dvd.",1175299200,,307,4.241379310344827
1656899,4,B00005RIXI,"Like many others, I liked the first 20 minute segment better than the second.  Though the second is very good, I wish it were a smoother transition from the first....perhaps more complicated stretches; stretching and oppositional points poses seems like a funny combination.  However, if you take each for what it is, they are both really nice.  I do the first 20 minute segment very often.  I have found that it is easy enough that my kids will often join in and it becomes a fun family activity.",1171411200,,497,4.613636363636363
1656900,2,B00005RIXI,"This doesn't really do anything for me...

Maybe if you haven't ever worked out before it may be a good beginning for you to start.",1168473600,,131,4.24
1656901,4,B00005RIXI,"I have taken yoga in the past and am familiar with it but hadn't

done any yoga in over 2 years.  I enjoyed the scenic film location and the background music.  I liked the fact that there's a beginner's session and an intermediate session.  Some of the positions were difficult for me to do since I'm a little overweight and out-of-shape, but it will give me something to work toward.",1156809600,,384,4.442857142857143
1656960,3,B00005RIXI,"i actually really love this dvd but i somewhat agree with the reviewer who said the instructor's voice is tense and unpleasant. i much prefer alan fingers' dvds, his voice is much more conducive to the yoga mood. but this instructor's voice has grown on me--it's kind of perky and upbeat, which is not great for yoga but i like it for a morning routine. for a total beginner i'd definitely recommend alan fingers' dvds over this one, because his instructions are much more thorough for breathing etc. but his tend to be hour-long workouts and i don't always have time for that, and i like this one because it's two 20-minute workouts and i can do one in the morning before work. the briefness coupled with her perky attitude is nice for a morning routine. it's not perfect yoga form and you don't get the meditative experience that is an alan fingers dvd, but it works for me to keep my hand in yoga a bit each day.",1146441600,3,915,4.420118343195266
1656961,2,B00005RIXI,"To let you know where I am coming from, I am out of shape and fat. I wanted a primer to increase flexibility before trying ""exercise."" I would have thought that a video which had both stretching and flexibility in the title would have systematically and progressively worked on each major group of muscles - this one doesn't. Session one has breathing instructions while session two doesn't. As a beginner, it helps to be reminded to breathe. Rodney Yee's videos seem to be better at involving the whole body and the exercises flow together.",1142726400,5,541,4.76595744680851
1656962,4,B00005RIXI,"I hemmed and hawed about buying this Yoga Zone DVD for a while, I had the chance to try it out and decided to pick it up.  I wouldn't say it is the best Yoga Zone DVD but a good one for those needing to increase flexibility in the hips and hamstrings, which are my problem areas.  Like most of the other Yoga Zones, there are 2-20 minute segments and both are filmed at the Grand Lidos San Souci resort in Jamaica.  These 2 are filmed on the beach so the scenery is especially nice.

Session 1 is led by Jean Kerner, who I have seen in other videos but assisting.  She is joined by Douglas Stewart who does a nice job demonstrating the poses, he is quite flexible too.  You start out in a seated straddle stretch, but add a twist to each side, I personally thought this felt a bit uncomfortable so I might try modifying it next time and do a seated spinal twist instead.  Next is triangle stretch where you will stretch forward over your leg first and then stretch to the side, this is repeated on the other leg before moving to another seated straddle stretch.  This time you will put your hands in front and aim towards moving your chest to the floor, Douglas does this one easily.  Following this you will do cat pose, then move into downward facing dog, low lunge and side lunge on one leg then the other, side stretch while on the knees, then you will do a toe stretch which I have never seen before.  Finishing out this session you will do a seated forward bend and before ending in a cross legged seat.

Session 2 is led by Douglas, he is joined by Suzanne.  The focus here is principle of opposition, 2 points moving away from one another.  You will start out in a seated position with legs extended in front of you, then you will lie on your back with your arms extended over your head and legs extended in the air.  You will lower one leg to the floor and raise it back up, then the other leg, repeated once for each side.  Then you will move into table pose with the option of going into reverse plank, this is held for a while and it the toughest pose you will see in either session, kind of felt as if it didn't belong there.  Next you will do a seated side lean stretch, then you will move into cat pose before moving into incline plank then downward facing dog.  Following this you will stand and move into a forward bend, then you will move into warrior 2 on one side, then bound chair pose.  Bound chair is a shallow chair pose but you have your arms extended out in front of you but trying to keep the shoulders back, a lot harder than it looks.  You will repeat warrior 2 on the other side and bound chair once again.

Next is a seated straddle stretch, Douglas calls it ""sitting fan"" pose.  Here you will add a side stretch to each side before putting your hands in front and aiming to get your chest to the floor.  Suzanne demonstrates this one nicely.  You will finish out in a seated forward bend before moving into a cross legged seat.

Overall I liked these two programs, I thought Jean and Douglas did a decent job for the most part.  I think the cueing could have been a little better in segment 2, but the routines themselves I can see being very beneficial for me and I will use this DVD a lot.  I give this one 4 stars.",1142640000,24,3249,4.2
1656963,5,B00005RIXI,"I am a very inflexable person and this is a great way for me to start to gain flexibility. The video is step by step, no rush, very explainatory so you can correct yourself and also you do not feel bad if you are unable to do as well as the instructor.

Hope this has helped.",1141689600,2,275,3.9107142857142856
1656964,4,B00005RIXI,"Love this yoga workout, the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I felt like it needed more stretching for the neck/shoulder areas that are so tight on most people over 30. Also a couple of the stretches seemed to be more painful than helpful, maybe I was doing them wrong? Otherwise it's a good video over-all and I am still doing almost all of the poses. I have been doing yoga for over 8 months. I must say I love yoga, it has helped me work out 95% of my back problems. I hardly ever have back pain now and am so much stronger. I love being flexible and feeling the relaxing effects of the yoga. My frequent migraines are now almost non-existant. (I do 20 minutes of cardio per day so that or yoga may be the ""cure"", not sure-probably both!)",1137801600,3,757,4.156462585034014
1656965,3,B00005RIXI,"The poses and pace of this dvd worked for me, but I find I avoid using this dvd, and choose others because of the sound.  I personally find the first instructor's voice tense and unpleasant, though her instructions are clear and useful.  Her tone sets a mood that is not condusive to yoga for me.  If I use it, I turn the sound off.",1127001600,6,332,4.15625
1656966,5,B00005RIXI,"You know, it is a wonderful democratic privilege that we can put up our opinions about products.

I would like to point out, that al bingham has nothing to do with the yoga-zone ''stretching for flexibility''.

Why on earth do you need to rip on somebody, tattle-tale on chattiness, and sling dirt?

Damn, be nice already. People have feelings. Maybe actually listen, and learn from Mr. Bingham's ''vapid'' chattiness.",1123977600,,418,5.028985507246377
1656967,3,B00005RIXI,"Both instructors on this video were way too ""chatty"" and detail explicit, which I feel cut into the 20 minute time one has to work out with this video.  I have worked out to Yoga Zone videos for over five years and thoroughly enjoy the instruction.  However, another Yoga Zone instructor who is also too ""chatty"" and takes away from actual workout time is Al Bingham.",1122940800,2,367,4.545454545454546
1656968,3,B00005RIXI,"This DVD has 2 20-minute sessions which I normally do together for one long workout.  I enjoy session 1 with Jean much more than session 2 with Douglas.  Jean gives clear instructions and is very easy to follow.  She demonstrates the modified poses herself. You get a good workout for your entire body and end the session feeling stretched, energized, and relaxed.

Session 2 with Douglas is more like being in a class as he is constantly informing you of what principle you are working.  If you are new to yoga or not as flexible, extending your feet up towards the ceiling and holding them will be very difficult.  Also, Table and Reverse Plank poses were done without much instruction and held awhile.  While you are trying to do these poses, Douglas continues to tell you about the principle of opposition - very annoying!  Session 2 left me with the feeling that Douglas was trying to prove to Yoga Zone that he can teach and knows his material.  He was much too technical for my liking.

Session 1 is relaxing while session 2 was not.  To be fair, I have done this tape several times but still find Douglas to be annoying and his poses difficult.  This tape was still worth the money because session 1 gave me what I was searching for - relaxation and stretching.",1122336000,15,1269,4.541850220264317
1656969,5,B00005RIXI,"This tape was the first Yoga Zone Tape I ever tried and since then have aquired quite a few of their programs.

 I typically like a more intense vinyasa/power type yoga practice but there are some days that I just don't have the energy and I'm glad I have this tape in my collection.

 I think this program is suitable for either beginners or someone like myself who has been doing yoga daily for over 8 years. With 2-20 minute routines, each being self contained (though you certainly could do them back to back) it is an excellent value.

 The instructors are very easy to follow, the pace is very relaxed and it has soothing music and scenery as well.

 Other gentle yoga programs I'd recommend are Suzanne Deason's ""Stress Relief Yoga For Beginners"" (20 minutes), Rainbeau Mars Sacred Yoga ""Beginners"" as well as ""Pure Tranquility"" from the same four tape set.

 I would also recommend any of the programs in the ""Yoga Zone Basics"" set which all have 2-20 minute programs as well as Yoga Zone's ""Sunrise and Sunset"" which is a bit more intense but not overwhelming.

 For a longer gentle program check out Total Yoga ""Earth"" which is a gentle flow style of yoga (modified Sun Salutations).",1118188800,4,1193,4.628571428571429
