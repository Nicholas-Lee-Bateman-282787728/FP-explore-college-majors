2889242,5,B000SQFC1I,"This is my all-time favorite tv show ever!  I can watch Girlfriends all day long, and I am so happy that season 2 will be out nest month.  It's a shame that with all the success of the show, its DVD box-sets are being put out slowly, but we all know why that is.  If it was based on white characters, all the seasons would be on DVD already.  That's the way it works, unfortunately.  Girlfriends is a great show based on positive and successful black women plus William :-) The women have grown so much in so many different ways, and we all can relate to at least one, if not all of the characters.  We should support black shows like this, and let's hope that there will be more in the future.",1189900800,,694,4.141791044776119
2889243,5,B000SQFC1I,"I am so thrilled that Girlfriends Season 2 is being released. This is my favorite show. I love the entire cast, and I look forward to having Season 2 in my possession.

2889244,5,B000SQFC1I,"Girlfriends - The Second Season is chop full of great episodes. The whole gang is here, Joan, Maya, Toni, and Lynn. When I first watched this show, I was instantly hooked, the writing is comical, hilarious, and very frank. And how good is Tracee Ellis Ross? She is an amazing actress, she is too under-rated. I am so glad Girlfriends got picked up for an 8th season. This is one show that will not leave you disappointed, you will fall in love with every character, they are so different from one another and extremely special. Don't wait, purchase your copy of Girlfriends - The Second Season today. Enjoy!",1187308800,6,607,4.62962962962963
2889245,5,B000SQFC1I,"I love this show. It is my favorite. I'm so glad season 2 is finally being released -- although I'm still a little upset that Paramount is dragging its feet with each season. (By the way, season 7 is available on itunes, ironically.) I miss the girls in the beginning stages of the show. It's interesting to see how each character has evolved. Mya and Lynn have changed the most, I think.",1187308800,4,388,4.402777777777778

2889291,5,B000SQFC1I,Because everything met my expectations and I had no problems. All of my purchases have been satisfactory. I'm very pleased.,1392422400,,123,5.2
2889292,4,B000SQFC1I,"The second season was completely full of drama including moments that were very touching that it brought me to tears and sobs lol... However, the drama remains continuous in this season and right now I'm watching the third and forth season. After I am done I will also review on them. I know this is a somewhat old show but I love the humor and the sisterhood of the Girlfriends. Nowadays we don't have those qualities in our sitcoms, it's mostly rivalry.  Great show, MUST BUY!!",1365292800,,479,4.569767441860465
2889293,2,B000SQFC1I,Season One was primary reason I bought the second and the third but this season sucks! The scriptwriters did a horrible job. It is like they were following the outline of that terrible tv show FRIENDS.,1364169600,,201,4.611111111111111
2889294,4,B000SQFC1I,"WOW!
I placed my order between 12 and 2 pm.
i received my package the next morning at 10 am.
I don't know how they did it but i am very happy with my product. i will request more items from this shipper in the near future!
the dvd was in excellent condition brand new with no scratches or skips.
the story line for this season though hehe... lets just say it was a continuation to a previous good season.
season 3 here i come :-)
5 stars for the merchant and 3 and a half stars for the actual talent of the writers",1362528000,,514,3.951923076923077
2889295,5,B000SQFC1I,This was a show i was never interested in until i saw my wife watching season one. I then became addicted to the humor and surprisingly bought season two for her. Looking forward to purchase season three when some extra cash gets in,1362441600,,232,4.4186046511627906

2889297,4,B000SQFC1I,Love the show girlfriends now I can watch it over and over. The show is funny and very entertaining. I think it would also make a good gift for any sassy diva,1355529600,,158,3.96875
2889318,5,B000SQFC1I,I love Girlfriends. I plan on getting each season. Def one of my most favorite shows. I can not complain.,1355097600,,105,4.3
2889319,5,B000SQFC1I,"I didn't watch this show regularly when it was on the air but fell in love with it when BET aired a marathon but I missed some episodes so decided to buy it. This season has many strong storylines:

*Joan & Toni's friendship problems culminating in one of the best shows of the season: TRICK OR TRUTH;
*Maya's flirtation with a charming stranger jeopardizes her marriage;
*William & Yvonne's relationship issues;
*Lynne returns from the islands with Vosco and for once LYNNE is the responsible WORKING woman;
*Toni opens her own real estate office &
*Joan dates a younger man

I love the chemistry between Tracee Ellis Ross, Jill Marie Jones, Golden Brooks, Persia White and Reggie Hayes and can't believe none of them, the show writers nor the show itself garnered any Emmies or major awards other than NAACP Image Awards.  Tracee & Jill Marie especially outdid themselves this season!

The disc also has 2 really interesting extras - one details the making of the TRICK OR TRUTH episode and another which I especially enjoyed details how the actors were selected in addition to Mara Brock Akil speaking about the creation of the show.

I'm sad that I didn't support this show fully while it aired but am so very grateful that the entire series is available on dvd so that I can enjoy watching it at my own pace without commercials.",1343260800,2,1333,4.703862660944206
2889320,5,B000SQFC1I,"I couldn't ask for more, I like the series of Girlfriends.  I will order the other series for days it is nothing to watch on television.",1319241600,,136,4.230769230769231
2889321,5,B000SQFC1I,"The first season was great, but season two is amazing. The stories and humor are definitely a step-up from last season. Also, the storyline with Joan and Tony not talking was really good. The conclusion, the heartbreaking scene at the church, was some good tv. So, not only is there humor, but heart. And thats what makes Girlfriends work so well.",1258243200,,347,4.704918032786885
2889322,5,B000SQFC1I,"I've always been a huge fan of Girlfriends... 2nd season is very well written. I'm always supporting the ""sisterhood"" lol",1232668800,,121,5.1
2889323,5,B000SQFC1I,"Well, you have to have this DVD. The picture quality is gorgeous, I saw colors I had not seen in Joan's living area before. The images really pop.",1213315200,,146,4.25
2889324,5,B000SQFC1I,"OMG!!! The second season to me is better than the first! It just keeps getting better! One reason why I say the second season is better than the first season is b/c Joan does not talk to the camera!! I love this show! Girlfriends bring everyday situations and conversations to the to the camera. And if you are listening to them carefully, you could learn a thing or two...If you have loved Girlfriends from the start, then you will enjoy EVERY episode that they make! Keep it up!",1204502400,2,480,4.465909090909091
2889325,5,B000SQFC1I,The show is all about what friendship is about. My favorite epidsode is when Tony gets up in church and stand up and Joan comes behind her. That was a very powerful moment. I almost cried because we all be there at some point in our life. I can relate to that particular moment. No one is perfect and I'm not trying to live a perfect life. I just want to live right and be happy. That was a great moment for t.v. Everyone should be proud about how that came to life. THANK YOU! I can't wait to watch season 3.,1202169600,,509,4.0
2889326,5,B000SQFC1I,"This second season is just as funny as the first. However it seems also a bit more serious and, at certain times were faced with quite emotional situations. I think it's a great buy and I'm glad I did it.",1200614400,,204,4.125
2889327,5,B000SQFC1I,"When this finally was released, I scooped up my copy and the next day, watched all episodes in one hit.  I love this show and this season is no let down.
It has some great story lines here and some moments that make you cry (in Trick or Truth at the church).  I love Sister Sistah, Joans Birthday Suit and X Does Not Mark The Spot.  The other really great episode is Can't Stan Ya where Maya's 'friend' Stan threatens to tell her husband about their relationship.  He ends up in their house when Maya comes home one night and makes for a terrific storyline.
The two things I really like about this show is firstly the comedy and having so many laughs throughout the series, but also the fact that these girls fight and have issues with each other, but ultimately they are always there for each other when things are bad.  When Joan was given X at a nightclub, the first thing she did was to get her date (who gave her the drug without her knowledge) to phone her girls.  If you don't have friends like these, this show hooks you in to their lives and if you do have friends like these then you related really well.  I cannot wait for the other seasons to come out and fully give this 5 stars because it's so fantastic.",1195344000,4,1218,4.246753246753247
2889348,5,B000SQFC1I,If you are a girlfriend's fan you will definetely enjoy this season. Even if you aren't the women in the show are very real and likable. I really enjoyed this season and you will to!!,1194739200,3,183,4.257142857142857
2889349,5,B000SQFC1I,"This show is just awesome. I missed the first few seasons due to work obligations and to be able to catch up on my own time and laugh everytime is a joy. I recommend this collection to all the other ""Girlfriends"" fans out there. Can't wait to get Season 3. Anybody know when we can expect it?",1194652800,4,292,4.140350877192983
2889350,5,B000SQFC1I,"Girlfriends...The Second Season, is outstanding. These four smart, sexy, and beautiful Black woman are truly outstanding in their hit TV comedy series. They are sophisticated and stylish, yet down to earth as they demonstrate over and over again that their friendship is unconditional. Their talent shows as they prove that life, love, romance, and comedy can share the same space at the same time.",1194566400,4,398,5.234375
2889351,4,B000SQFC1I,The second season was fantastic. I think Joan is the most lovable/hatable character- can't get enough of her. The other girlfriends and William all have excellent chemistry. Please hurry with season 3 and 4 and 5!!!!!!,1194480000,3,218,5.083333333333333

2889353,5,B000SQFC1I,I'm a huge fan of the show! Very excited to see that this season has extras like interviews from the cast and commentary. This was a great season! The actors got more comfortable with their characters and they tackled a lot of important issues.  I just with they had bloopers! Everybody likes to see bloopers! So hopefully season 3 will.  Highly recommned for any fan of Girlfriends or anyone looking to pick up a new show!!!,1194393600,4,425,4.578947368421052

2889355,5,B000SQFC1I,"Season 2 is so good, I watch the whole season as soon as my boyfriend brought it for me on the day it came out.  I love this show, it is very similar to living single.  It's a good posivite show for African American's.  You should buy this, it's so worth the money!!!!",1192060800,,268,4.018867924528302
