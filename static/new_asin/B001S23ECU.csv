8339316,5,B001S23ECU,"This film of King Lear will appeal only to the rare few who know the lines of Shakespeare by heart, therefore needing no subtitles (there are none). That said, and not understanding Hungarian, I have been watching Lear as if for the first time. This is not a definitive performance of the play: a definitive Lear is simply impossible. But it is a performance by Slavic actors who respect theater craft, the life's work of developing classical actors, and 19th Century ""greatness on stage."" These are the leading actors of Hungary showing how a culture builds its national theater from talented youth to almost great leading players -- Shakespeare being the pinnacle of theater, Lear being the Himalayan peak of Shakespearean Tragedy. Buy this film, if you can find it, and study it; learn subliminally from it. Any contemporary actor who wants to see living tradition well practiced within a national stage tradition featuring ""highest culture"" will enjoy it, and will marvel how simply good theater can make up for production pizzaz. After all, what is the Heath in Lear if not a bleak bare staging of old boards set up in an open-air octagon?",1276041600,,1144,4.871794871794871
