7687810,4,B01CP7ERPO,"This is a gorgeous movie to look at but watching the trailer you may expect a lot more action or historical events than its has. Not to say that is a bad movie,but the core of it is the romantic relationship between the main characters and the difficulties it creates for them. If you are happy with that and you enjoy Indian movies you would not be disappointed watching this movie.",1460851200,6,383,4.408450704225352
7687811,5,B01CP7ERPO,"This movie is gorgeous.  I watched this film 5 times in the theatre - the most I've seen of any film on the big screen.  First time to drink in the beauty of the film and read the subtitles/know the story (I don't understand Hindi).  Second, third, fourth and fifth times I completely ignored the subtitles and drank in the visual beauty of each session.  One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen on the big screen.  The colourful costumes, the intricate sets - all breathtakingly heavenly and almost beyond imaginative comprehension until seen.  Sanjay Leela Bhansali has really done an exceptional job with his dream project and I hope makes India very proud. Ranveer Singh is great as the warrior. Deepika and Priyanka are both gorgeous actresses, made even more GORGEOUS-ER (if there's such thing!).  One could only imagine what it would have looked like with SLB's original intended cast, but for me this Singh/Padukone/Chopra cast is perfectly cast.  Though the title suggests it could be more about Deepika's character (Mastani), Priyanka is equally fabulous as Bajirao's first wife (Kashi).  Kashi is strong in her own dignified way and certainly doesn't act second fiddle to Mastani. The supporting cast is excellent too.

I christened/watched this new blu-ray on my neighbour's 40""+ inch flat screen.  The picture quality is gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous - what can I say?  Nothing will beat the memory of watching it on big screen theatre, but this HD blu-ray release is still vividly beautiful and I'm so glad to own it now in it's high definition.

Now just a few negative points about Eros release:
1 - predictably like nearly all Eros releases, the same white opaque 'Eros' watermark that 'graces' (or more likely rudely mini-interrupts) the beginning and end of each song item.  I'm looking forward to getting the German Rapid-Eye BD release in next few months that will most likely NOT have that watermark (but most likely have non removable German subtitles when selecting Hindi language option - but that's another story!)
2 - the (one) scene with a certain tiger has a written disclaimer at the bottom right hand corner about it being filmed abroad - have no idea why!
3 - bonus SD disc would probably be appreciated by people who understand Hindi more because bonus disc doesn't have subtitles, but even then I wasn't too keen on the 'deleted scenes' and 'making of...' bonus.

Otherwise I highly recommend this BD to all who loved this film.  This is one of the few BD's I own that I can watch over and over and over...",1459123200,23,2546,4.831797235023042

7687816,4,B01CP7ERPO,"Beautiful movie, but first, Mastani was a home-wrecker. Second the reasons Hindus hated muslims during that time may have something to do with the muslim invasion and the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Hindu women, children (including babies) and men.

I am a fan of Bhansali anyway and I especially love Ranvir and Deepika, both together and individually. Their chemistry is very apparent and while I'm not a fan of Priyanka, she performs very well in this movie. The songs are beautiful and a joy to watch. There are a few over the top moments (aren't there always), but they don't take away from the movie.

7687866,5,B01CP7ERPO,"Bajirao Mastani narrates the star-crossed love affair of Peshwa Bajirao and princess Mastani.
And who better than Sanjay Leela Bhansali, who to his repertoire has directed fantastic movies like Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, Devdas, Black, Saawariya, Guzaarish and Ram-Leela, to pull of directing a movie of this scale and grandeur.

In the principal roles, Bajirao Mastani stars Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra who bring across their immense talent. Together they have given their respective roles the depth of emotions and the right amounts of simmering anger needed for us to believe in and understand the emotional conflicts between Bajirao, Mastani and Kashibai. So much so on the face of a blatant extra marital affair, it becomes difficult to blame and point fingers at the adulterer, the scorned wife or the other woman.

The songs add doses of vibrance to the storytelling. The songs Moha rang do laal, Deewani mastani and Pinga were beautifully choreographed, the first two rendered beautifully by Deepika and the last track by both Deepika and Priyanka. The fervor of Malhari and Gajanana were almost palpable.

And woven amidst valiant displays of valor, bloody battlefields, grand celebrations, is the tender and emotional love story of Bajirao and Mastani which definitely is the USP of the movie. All in all, Bajirao Mastani was an absolute treat to watch!",1463443200,,1384,5.197309417040358
7687867,3,B01CP7ERPO,"As a Maharashtrian, I have been very disappointed with the liberties taken with history in this film. Deepika was very poor as an actor in this movie. Her role was very complex and through most of the film, she showed no emotions on her face. The blank look on her face took away from the nuances that were inherent in this love triangle.",1462233600,,338,4.380952380952381
7687868,4,B01CP7ERPO,"I was almost certain that this movie would never get made. Sanjay Leela Bhansali's dream project has been in the making for 15 years and had to suffer from many setbacks and hurdles. The challenge was to make a movie that people would enjoy even though they are not familiar with Maratha History but Bhansali succeeds in making a gorgeous film that celebrates the love of Bajirao and Mastani with beautiful backgrounds, set pieces and elaborate costumes. It is eye candy and stays with you for a while. In this tale of forbidden love in a time when social customs were governed by religious norms, these two lovers find love but they are suffocated because they want so  much more of life. Bajirao is a fierce warrior but yet he is vulnerable and human, he falls for Mastani but still yearns for the acceptance of his wife Kashibai. He loves Mastani but is unable to have her accepted by his family or his Bramhin society. Obviously Bhanslali meddles with history and still manages to make a film that is very watchable. The dialogues are poetic and convey a richness that is missing today.
While Bajirao romances Mastani, it is Kashibai who steals the show. As Kashibai, Priyanka is just amazing. Ranveer Singh is probably in a role that very well could be one of his most memorable, this kid can act for sure - whether it's his Marathi accent or his swagger, he is a winner.
Deepika has the titular role but does not have the chops and charm for such a complex role.
Bajirao is a epic film that I am glad got made and I urge you to find the biggest screen to enjoy it.

7687870,5,B01CP7ERPO,"As far as Indian cinema goes, this is the GOLD STANDARD; I purchased this item based on the preview alone and was absolutely enthralled with the film. Everything from the casting of the three main leads, the musical score, dance sequences, costumes, sets, and most importantly story line are all spot on. Visually stunning and beautifully directed, ""Bajirao Mastani"" is a feast for the eyes as well as the senses--emotionally powerful and universal in its focus on how love can be both devastating and liberating all at once, you will find yourself--much like Bajirao, Mastani, and Kashi--torn as to which is the greater force: love or obligations to ones' family/country/religion. Kashi is by far the most sympathetic and complex of the ill-fated trio, as her first appearance(s) on the screen paint her as the devoted yet slightly naive wife of Bajirao. As the film progresses and the drama played out by the characters unfolds, we see her character develop in terms of losing her naivety and becoming emotionally cold and hardened. Yet there is another layer, a layer which sees her warring with her unconditional love for her husband, her uneasy sympathy towards Mastani, and the unbearable pressures of such a socially-crippling situation weighing on her shoulders. The song ""Pinga"" showcases this love/hate relationship perfectly, as Kashi ultimately accepts that the situation--while far from simply disappearing and going away--is here to stay, and that her husband's happiness is all that really matters/drives her own existence, even if it does mean admitting that his heart belongs to another woman. The final sequences are the most emotionally-gripping, and Bhansali executes his trademark star-crossed lover's ending (i.e. ""Devdas"" and ""Ram-Leela"") in some of the most cinematically gorgeous shots I have ever seen. Throughout the film you will see homages to films such as ""Hero,"" ""Curse of the Golden Flower,"" and others which frame shots in such a way as to create an unusual and hyper-sensitive sense of (un) reality. Musically it is a gem, with Shreya Ghoshal lending her ethereal and plaintive voice to the title tracks which take you through the whole gammut of invigorating highs and crushing lows associated with love and loss. If you are a fan of Indian cinema, this is a must-have for your collection.",1462060800,6,2325,5.1697612732095495

The whole film is without substance, just pretty costumes, meaningless scenes when you do not understand, why people do what they do. Fighting scenes are just laughable. Also the jumps in the timeline without explanation are quite confusing. I was really disappointed.

7687880,5,B01CP7ERPO,"I previously saw Bajiro Mastani in the theater and  liked it so well that I wanted to view it again. The film has gorgeous cinematography and incredible costuming. It has a fairytale like quality; although it is historically based. The scene between Bajirao and Kashi ; on their first night together  ( I assume) is a masterpiece of lush, sensual filming. The relationship between Bajiro and the women in his life is problematic, at best. He comes across as being selfish; not able to choose between Kashi and Mastani; his soul mate. In the end; his decision destroys them all. I started out; not liking Bajirao very much, but the scenes where he goes to Mastani and helps her to deliver their child; reveals new depth and complexity to his character. I like the way that this film leads you to believe certain things about the characters, and then reveals new scenes that change your opinions. There is prejudice between some of  the Moslim and Hindu characters in the film. Although Mastani was brave and passionate and devoted; Kashi was my favorite person in the movie. I loved the playful scene where she put on Bajirao's helmet. My heart just broke, for her and what she endured. There is just a lot of complex elements in this movie. It is not a typical Bollywood movie. It is an adventure",1461283200,9,1296,4.650655021834061

8753660,5,B01CP7ERPO,"It has great detail from scenery to the costumes, visually breath taking. CGI was good. Great music.  Although I was watching with English subtitles, the actors had great dialogue and I felt they really played off each other well.  A lot of emotion and feeling.  What song and dance was in this felt natural.  A scene would lead seamlessly into the dance and or song and then out of it, not too much of it, not like a Broadway or Bollywood musical.  I would love to see this on a very big screen.",1525651200,,496,4.290322580645161
