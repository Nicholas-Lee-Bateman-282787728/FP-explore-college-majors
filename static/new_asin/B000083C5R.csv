1826365,1,B000083C5R,"I bought this thing on the reviews given here. Other than a look at a low budget(so low that everybody must have worked for nothing) try to copy Night of the Living Dead this thing has no merit. The commentary is a hash of cutism. This thing ought not to be sold without qualifications that it is a first try at direct to DVD that fails miserably. If you can watch this,and enjoy it,then you have no fear of ever buying or watching a bad movie. A lot of slasher,zombie films today are like this. All you get is a very attractive DVD box. Ed Wood's films are much more creative and enjoyable. In fact it would be a treat to have someone making these movies who had the talent and enthusiasm that he had. A waste of money.",1084406400,2,720,4.18705035971223
1826366,4,B000083C5R,"Loved it!
Biohazardous is one of the best low budgeted filcks I've seen in some time. The FX kicked ass and the bad guy is awsome, what a creepy dude!
I say check it out ASAP!!!",1064966400,2,177,3.9444444444444446
1826367,3,B000083C5R,"Movie starts on a typical day in a suburbain town where protesters protest against GENTECH who is doing very naughty things with BIOHAZARDOUS stuff. Then some teenagers get together and party and get drunk near the GENTECH lab. But then some idiot gets electricuted and the rest of the pre-pubscent kids seek medical help for him by taking him in the GENTECH lab (DUR DEE DUR). While this is going on, some pigs are investigating GENTECH and then they all find themselves battling zombies and some guy who runs or owns the GENTECH lab and an angry fat mega-zombie. OR whatever. WHAT WILL YOU DO?:(
Ever watch Soap Operas? Or that dumb show Save By The Bell??? Imagine those shows look and cinematography mixed with a zombie flesh eating film. That is what you'll get. The film is good but the texture of the film is way too fruity and plain and not dark and gruesome so that's why this film didn't really tickle my hoo hoo dilly all that much.  The gore was good, and yes there are zombies in this film that eat flesh for once, story was eeh.. but a good indepentent film none the less.

1826368,3,B000083C5R,There really isn't much to say. It was kind of slow but the zombies looked great. The characters over acted but the blood was plentiful. This is no classic but its good enough for a watch. Just remember Low Budget and SOV when watching and if you can get past that this is a great movie.,1061596800,,287,4.142857142857143
1826369,5,B000083C5R,"Low budget zombie movies are a dime a dozen, but BIOHAZARDOUS really surprised the hell out of me. I watch a lot of independent horror and was very surprised by the story, acting and overall look of this no-budget zombie fest.
Not for your lovers of mainstream horror flicks, but if your into low budget stuff, you'll love it. FX are above par and brains fly a plenty.
Best zombie flick I've seen in a long time.
DVD: Sounds is a bit off, but the commentary is fairly entertaining. The thing that impressed me most is the cinematography in it. Very much like ""Creepshow"" or ""Susperia"". If your a budding DV filmmaker, pick this up (for if nothing more) than a study of  how to shoot a decent DV movie.",1050624000,4,701,4.392307692307693
1826370,4,B000083C5R,"Biohazardous is a cool flick to check out. It has a good storyline, and its got enough zombies to appease someone for one sitting. The blood and effects were awesome, especially the gutting scene. For fans of low budget horror, its more watchable than some other ""zombie"" films. Plus side, the director's commentary is great!",1049932800,2,325,4.927272727272728
1826371,1,B000083C5R,"When I bought this, I knew about the low budget going into it(cause I never heard of it before). So I didn't expect some computer animation or some Hollywood actor. All I was interested in was a good storyline with decent acting to satisfy a little survivol horror bug inside of me and I didn't even get that(in other words it failed miserably even for low budget). The main plot is nothing more then a ... off of R.E. in that some chemical spill in some facility turns everyone into flesh eating zombies. Even the title of the film is a R.E. .. off, in Japan R.E. is 'Biohazard'. The stage is set in a corporate office building that the director tried very hard to make it look like a high tech government research lab. I have to admit that the makeup for the zombies were half decent, they even included a scene where the dead munches on a helpless victim(hog intestines, cooked of course). At first I rubbed my eyes, then I couldn't help but to notice seeing the same group of zombies attacking our heros no matter where they went inside the building. Oh yeah, expect a 'magical gun' too...you know, the one that constantly shoots without ever running out of ammunition(Steven Seigal flicks all of a sudden rushes through my head). Anyways, there are way too many holes in the story, and talk about 'over acting'. If there was ever an award for that I garuntee one or two of the actors in this film would win it. The main boss is nothing more then a guy with a mask on which is the top secret experiment of the whole deal(I swore thats what the Tyrant was in R.E. too, go figure). There is even a swat team that comes to the rescue, gee I wonder whatever happened to them, oh well if it wasn't important for the director it shouldn't be important to me also. Hey they even drove in some Hummers, that was awesome. The local car rental must of had a rent sale that weekend. My bottom line for Bio-hazardous is, poor acting, copied storyline, and not alot of scare in it. Get it 'only' if your a survivol horror freak like me and gotta have all of the titles. You have been warned.",1049760000,3,2082,4.341025641025641
1826372,2,B000083C5R,"I love love low budget horror, but this movie didn't cut it.  The gore was substandard without an ending.  Too many zombie movies carry on instead of having a conclusion.
There were parts where I didn't know if the zombies were eating intestines or a bloody whoopey cushion.  The plot of being trapped in a building with zombies had been overdone.  There was nothing original to add to the zombie genre.  I was dissapointed.  I really wanted to like it, but just couldn't.",1048982400,,472,4.626506024096385

There was plenty of gore, however it could not make up for the poor acting and the frustrating sound quality.

1826484,3,B000083C5R,"I found it to be enjoyable. It obviously has it's flaws: Shot on video, low budget, average performances. However, this movie is still fun and why do people compare to crap like Resident Evil? Paul W.S. Anderson's film adaptation of the video game was laughable at best and this was a movie with a huge budget and CGI effects to boot.'

The only difference is there's a lab but wasn't there a lab in ""Day of the Dead"" where guys where experimenting with people and zombies?

The film doesn't also have the type of characters Resident Evil does: The group is made of a couple of slackers, a couple of inept cops, some young girls, and a couple of scientific geeks. Usually this interaction provides laughs. The gore was poor but I wasn't expecting much there. The movie at least had a sense of direction of what they wanted to do but just didn't have the resources to do it. I've seen far worse (Day of the Dead 2: Contagium).

This is the type of flick that you'd get a couple of beers and watch it for your friends for laughs.",1190592000,,1027,4.366492146596858
1826485,5,B000083C5R,"this is a pretty good ""B"" rated movie. Obviously they didn't have a huge buget, and it was shot in video so it has that porn movie kind of look to it. Acting wasn't too bad except for the head bad guy who was really stunk. Special effects were better than I expected and allot better than a whole bunch of ""B""s that I've seen (and I've seen allot) Plot pretty much was the same as Resident Evil, people trapped in a lab with a bunch of zombies chasing them around, trying to get a free lunch.

Didn't like choice of harsh music.  While the acting wasn't as terrible as others I've seen, the direction and script sucked big time.  Effects weren't very good either.  Short description of this movie would be, ""Bad horror porn"".

After watching it through to the end, I don't remember a single scene that was worth sitting through an hour and a half for. I don't mind slow movies but this one was excruciatingly painful. The story takes place at Gentech Industries, a fictional company in Hillsdale, N.J. that reanimates the dead for the purpose of creating super soldiers. This crack team of scientists use corpses dressed in military uniform and bring them back to life just prior to injecting them with a protein concoction, that turns them into super zombies. During a demonstration, one of the zombies break free while it's strapped to a gurney, then the havoc begins. This isn't your typical zombie that dies from a gunshot wound to the head; these can't be stopped unless they're completely destroyed. The script, acting and the sound were horrible. The same zombies seemed to reappear throughout the entire movie, making it seem the budget was so low the producers couldn't afford to pay for more zombies. Even if you're a die hard zombie fan, this movie is hard to watch.",1448755200,,1106,4.765625
7978950,2,B000083C5R,"Between 2 and 3 stars. I didn't ""like it"", but I may watch again in the future.

The bad: Not scary, not many zombies in first half, actors weren't great, they took a long time to get action started. The ""action"" was very slow zombies.

The good: The actors didn't try to look stupid, like in Zombie Farm. The actors weren't Hollywood level, but they tried. The executive of Gentech was  corny, but the actors tried. The plot wasn't insanely stupid.

A zombie growled at 23 minutes in, you saw some and 35 minutes in and 42 minutes and beyond. When zombie movies aren't constant action, the plot had better be damned interesting and it wasn't. Night of the Living Dead was a legend, and they had a zombie feeding at less than 7 minutes in. With this one 35-42 minutes before much of anything happens.

I don't like it, but it's better than Zombie Farm.

They didn't ever seem to get an air strike, even though the cleanup team failed.

I was an extra in some cheap zombie movie as a kid. They paid minimum wage and we were dressed as Zombie soldiers in the snow. Not sure if that movie ever made it (which means it probably didn't make it). It was before VHS, so if Hollywood didn't like it, it just didn't sell - There was no direct market for VHS skipping movie theaters. We extras were cheap, so I like zombie movies with lots of zombies. At that price, there's no reason not to have them. This had a bunch, but they were slow and not scary at all.",1446940800,,1451,4.293040293040293
