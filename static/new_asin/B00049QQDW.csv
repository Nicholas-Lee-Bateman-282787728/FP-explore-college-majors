8036087,4,B00049QQDW,"Great introduction to American Government with credible commentators who introduced and added great comment on each major event.  Good video quality, not great but the organization of topics lacks a little.  However, a great addition for a teacher of government.",1365724800,2,262,5.525
8036088,4,B00049QQDW,I'm a high school government teacher and I purchased this set for my classroom. These DVDs cover pretty much all of the topics our curriculum requires for the three branches of government. Its not necessarily in-depth but thorough over-view of each branch. I often used it to introduce topics to students. Must have set for a classroom teacher!,1335916800,4,344,4.948275862068965
8036089,2,B00049QQDW,"This set of tapes was very disappointing. The makers of these films need to sit down with a typical middle schooler or have some experienced teachers provide them some guidance. The producers clearly do not have a grasp of what engages a teenager (adults would be bored too). In the tapes, talking heads dominate . Many sections look like a slide show with text superimposed. The background music is positively awful and the narration is monotonous. Suggestions: Use clips from CSPAN with Congressmen going after it. Use more Senators, justices and Administrative workers and let them explain what they do. Find some entertaining personality to guide the viewer through the show and interview people instead of using a narrator's voice-over. Use anecdotes. Loosen up. Have some fun. Inject some humor. I would agree that the tapes are fairly informative but if you are a teacher be forewarned: your students will lose interest very quickly.",1134691200,38,940,5.1103896103896105
8036090,4,B00049QQDW,"This boxed provides an excellent introduction to understanding the workings and traditions of the three branches of American government. The videos cover the Presidency, Congress and the Supreme Court in an informative manner combining history, contemporary commentary and academic experts providing analysis and interesting insights. For an English student of American politics these videos made an ideal introduction to understanding the different arrangements and idiosyncracies of the US political system. This collection is not entertainment but good solid educational presentation and is well worth the money I paid.",990144000,12,622,6.079545454545454
