I remember doing but the ""Hands In Your Face"" drill is one of the most creative I have ever seen.

How do you practice in your driveway by yourself and have someone knock the ball away and learn how to recover, square up and shoot? It's all here and this is the DVD your son or daughter or even you want to see. One of the most creative programs I've ever seen! I learned about this DVD after buying some of Marty Schupak's soccer programs. Those worked well with my team and with my 11 year old son loving basketball like I did, DRIVEWAY BASKETBALL DRILLS was a perfect fit! The video has great production values and will help any youth player who strives to better his or her hoop game!",1245974400,5,666,4.336
8049483,5,B0007ODIHG,"Did you ever practice basketball by yourself as a kid in your driveway?
Did you shovel snow in the winter just so you could play one on one with your friend for hours at a time?
Remember drawing a circle with a piece of chalk and shooting within that spot?
How about HORSE, OUT, 5-3-1? And for today's youth, ""Knockout""!
All these and more are in this basketball gem. Ideas are aplenty for youth basketball players
looking to improve their game by themselves or with their friends.
The creativity is amazing. Ball handling, jumping,shooting plus more.
View it on your TV, computer or i-phone. You'll look at it over and over
just like my son and I keep doing. Great video production is also a plus.
If you don't think that basketball is the most popular sport in the world today, you have to
