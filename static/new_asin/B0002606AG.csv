8381747,3,B0002606AG,"Ok I practice capoeira since 4 years now, but indeed I was disappointed to spend this amount of money for a dvd like this. It's worth it just if you're a beginner. Not advanced.

PROS: - list of capoeira toques in music section (But where are pandeiro??Atabaque??)

- good stretching advice

- good tips and explanation, though keeps it simple

- some good ideas to excercise

CONS:

- too few excercices for an advanced video

- poor roda section

- its a dvd copy (purple layer), the price is high

- just a few combos

my verdict: A WELL, SLOWLY EXPLAINED MOVIE FOR BEGINNERS/INTERMEDIATE. Not advanced at all",1122940800,3,612,4.583333333333333
8381748,5,B0002606AG,I own Capoeira and Capoeira 2 and they where awesome. Capoeira 3 is no exception and  has the best capoeira combination techniques I have seen. Prof. Eduardo Ferreira and his group are the real deal. I have learned a tremendous amount from this DVD and highly recommend it just as your other customers have recommended the other two DVD's in the series.,1096675200,,353,4.693548387096774
