4620468,4,B00596WEVI,"I rented this last week and I must say I really enjoyed it.  I put it on the same scale as other recent JCVD films such as Until Death and Universal Soldier Regenerated.  The co-star aspect I thinked worked very well and the story was pretty solid.  Its much better than Assassains with Stallone and Bandaras back in the 90's.  I liked the fact that JCVD has no name in the movie and that he gives no reason why he does what he does.  He's a hitman, period.  Good action movie.",1316563200,,477,4.186813186813187
4620469,5,B00596WEVI,"""This is what he does best, and he is the best.""  A corrupt Interpol officer makes that observation about Roland Flint, the character depicted by Scott Adkins in the riveting ""Assassination Games.""  The accolade truly applies to the film's star Jean-Claude Van Damme, who has translated his experience as a global superstar into becoming a superior actor in the action films genre'.  ""Assassination Games"" is another example that the original ""Muscles from Brussels"" has evolved into a creative force behind fast-paced movies that are both character-driven and visually stylish without resorting to CGI tricks or the usual action movie cliches'.  JCVD depicts Vincent Brazil, who becomes a reluctant partner with Flint in a cat-and-mouse game against both Interpol and relentless members of a European mob.  Brazil's relationship with an unlikely girl-next-door named October provides the dramatic anchor for a tense mix of tragedy and revenge.  When October kisses Vincent on the cheek for his kindness toward her,  Van Damme depicts the hitman's resistance to affection with a truthful emotion that is both telling and heartbreaking.  It is just one of many moments, both quiet and explosive, in ""Assassination Games"" that demonstrate JCVD's superiority as an actor in action films today.",1316304000,5,1290,5.415
4620470,5,B00596WEVI,"Through the films ""Ninja"" and the second and third ""Undisputed"" films-I've gotten to know and become a fan of Scott Adkins.  I checked out ""Assasination Games"" more for Adkins than Van Damme but I gotta say, that despite his heyday being long over-I really enjoyed seeing the old guy in a new light with this film.  Jean Claude plays a really different character than what we're used to here and makes an absolute pro job of it.  The film itself is very competent and several levels above what we've come to expect from straight to DVD fare.  The action is good and the story is really sharp and well written.  As the movie goes along and you sort of start to see where it's heading- you can't help but enjoy the ride.  Both Adkins and Van Damme's characters are very relatable and three dimensional though their motives are very different.  The two really play well off of each other, and I'd love to see them reunite in a sequel.  This is really a good action/suspense flick.",1316131200,2,977,4.511363636363637
4620471,3,B00596WEVI,"In a quote on the back of the DVD case, Black Belt Magazine names this ""the best Jean-Claude Van Damme movie and the best Scott Adkins movie. Ever."" Now, I put a lot of stock in that publication, but I really can't imagine where the writer's priorities were on the day he reviewed this movie. ""Assassination Games"" is a good DTV thriller but a thoroughly disappointing martial arts action film - a definite step down from Van Damme's previous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Universal-Soldier-Regeneration/dp/B002U6CJCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Universal Soldier: Regeneration</a>&nbsp;and Adkins' jaw-dropping&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-III-Redemption/dp/B003FXXNH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed III: Redemption</a>. Were it not for the movie's adherence to style and sound production values, I'd say for certain that it's disappointing enough to break Van Damme's recent revivalist streak.

The story: two ace assassins - one calloused by the cutthroat lifestyle but still going strong (Van Damme), one left vengeful but vulnerable after his occupation took its toll on his family (Adkins) - must form a shaky alliance to take down a vicious crime lord (Ivan Kaye,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Green-Green-Grass/dp/B000GUK1XU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Green Green Grass</a>), unaware that they're playing into a deadly set-up by crooked cops.

I must admit, the movie has many good things going for it. ""Assassination Games"" succeeds as one of the few movies made in Romania to actually look good: the cinematography and art direction are sound, bereft of the usual grey bleakness lesser films capture in the same setting. The writing is superior for a DTV flick: were I judging this as an intrigue thriller, I'd give it a higher score, and unlike in a lot of low-budget flicks, many interesting things that are referenced early in the movie end up making a meaningful comeback later down the road (e.g. the smart gun, the Van Damme character's relationship to the church). The acting is surprisingly good: Van Damme continues to channel the dark energy he first expressed in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JCVD/dp/B001PWY4NG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JCVD</a>&nbsp;and Scott proves that he doesn't need to be doing a Russian accent to appear intense - both of them proving themselves to be capable dramatic players in a time when a lot of viewers are expecting this. Stylistically and dramatically, this film succeeds.

Then you remember that you're actually supposed to be watching an action movie, and at once it seems barren. Of the entire 101-minute running time, I counted barely 7 minutes given over to actual adrenaline-pumping scenes. Of these, there are only two real fights among a meager smattering five-second beat-'em-ups, and only one of them is actually worth noting. The Van Damme/Adkins rematch makes no improvement over their earlier scuffle in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shepherd-Border-Patrol/dp/B0011VIO46/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shepherd: Border Patrol</a>. Scott has a few cool moves throughout the movie, including a painful-looking flying dropkick, but none of these come up in his over-edited brawl with Jean-Claude which once again does not take advantage of the capacities of its performers. I do believe that director Ernie Barbarash (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cube-Zero/dp/B0006Z2LH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cube Zero</a>) was aware of the significance of having these two starring in the same movie, but it seems as though he was too caught up in trying to make the film seem legitimate to capitalize on the actual action aspect of his action movie.

I think there are enough fans out there of both of the main stars who'll like this one enough to keep it from being a pitfall in either of their careers, but I declare myself let down. My cinematic opus of Van Damme/Adkins martial artistry is apparently never to be, leaving me more than a bit disheartened. May these two do better on separate paths.",1315872000,4,4253,6.166947723440135
4620472,4,B00596WEVI,"Having resigned myself to accepting the Van Damme heyday was over and the remainder of his career would be limited to less than average DTV releases, along comes Assassination Games to revive my crestfallen heart and
prove low budget action does not have to be mindless, derivitive, and action-less abhorrations of film where the producer's only goal was to create a 90 minute timeline that could be packaged and labeled as a 'movie.'

While many are quick to categorize this film as standard action fare, nothing about it is standard: the dialogue, while just a notch above average, is coherent and well paced; the direction is competent; and the supporting players can actually act, entertaining you when the leads aren't on screen.  I disagree with the reviewer who stated the lead villain (Polo Yakur, played by Ivan Kaye), was nothing more than a 'typical' heavy, because Kaye - while admittedly serving a narrow spectrum in the film - did inflect subtleties to make the character seem a grieving human being rather than just another over the top villain strutting around for the sake of malevolence.

It's true there isn't much fighting in this movie, but the fighting that is present serves purpose rather than being a fight scene dropped into the storyline simply to satisfy machismo.  Because this movie works, you don't pine for more fighting or action, you want to see what happens to the characters.  You become transfixed on the action but are satisfied with an even bigger bang when you learn where the action is leading.  It's a mix that we rarely see in any DTV release nowadays, and I'm surprised this film was not given wider distribution in theaters.

As a Jean-Claude Van Damme film, I'm happy to say it is, beyond doubt, the best he has done in a long time.  While The Shepard was watchable despite its predictable flaws, even die hard fans must admit to disappointment during a long dry spell of DTV crap where the only saving grace was Van Damme himself, lost amidst amateurish, no-talent schlock.  With this single film, his heinous mistakes of the past - Derailed, Until Death, etc - are forgotten and forgiven.  As a Scott Adkins film, it shows how good an actor he can be, thank goodness, something desperately needed in this genre  when the action hero isn't kicking somebody around.  As a team, the two performed well together and, I daresay, I'd be happy to see those two characters together again in a sequel. By the end of the film they have bonded and earned respect from each other, which is just the beginning for far more.",1315353600,22,2558,4.762443438914027
4620473,3,B00596WEVI,"Caught this at a theater nearby and I have to say that I did enjoy this. It wasn't great or even ""really good"" but it was better than most of JCVD's other dtv movies(excluding US3 and Replicant)...and better than some of his later theatrical movies(Street Fighter,Double Team,Knock Off, Unisol:The Return). I think putting it on the same level as Wake of Death is pretty fair. I actually may have liked this a little more since it didn't feature the dopey MTV edits that WOD had. The acting was pretty solid all around for the most part. JC's son, Kris' character(Schell) was extremely pointless in my opinion...not to mention he sucked in it. Felt like he was reading his lines the entire movie. I really liked JC and Adkin's chemistry together. They played off each other really well but I was left wanting to see more of them sharing the screen. There were a few aspects I didn't care for but I don't want to spoil anything. Production wise, the movie looks pretty good considering the budget. It's well directed and shot. Good music score too. However, I actually feel like it would have made for a better at home experience than a theatrical one. The sepia tone actually looked a little blurred on the big screen during some of the wide shots...and I did find myself craving a little color. Close ups looked good though. All in all, it was a pretty good movie. This gives me hope for The Butcher. If Ernie Barbarash had a little more money to work with, he'd do a hell of a job. 3.25/5",1315267200,7,1490,4.522222222222222
4620474,3,B00596WEVI,"The movie comes at you fast with a lot of major plot points in the beginning.

The film opens with a Ukrainian wedding scene. Waiters are getting patted down. One waiter (Jean-Claude Van Damme), skilled in knives, cuts the throat of the big boss and escapes to his secret apartment...meanwhile another assassin, Flint lives in seclusion caring for his comatose wife (Bianca Van Varenberg).

Also going on is a quick scene involving Interpol corruption scandal and an investigation. Seems the Interpol is selling guns that they seize back to the criminals. They are afraid that Flint(Scott Adkins) can take them down, so they order his assassination. In order to flush him out they release a crime boss named Polo (Ivan Kaye) from prison, who had gang raped and beat Flint's wife comatose. In addition to Flint, Jean-Claude Van Damme, who gets paid in diamonds, is also summoned to do the Polo assassination. Polo is hunting the man (Van-Damme) who killed his brother in the first scene, but doesn't know who performed the deed.

Now if this wasn't enough, Van Damme is distracted by his new neighbors, a prostitute (Marija Karan) and a pimp who beats her. Van Damme doesn't want Flint to kill Polo or else he loses his fee, so he goes after Flint too. Flint realizes Interpol set him up by freeing Polo, so he wants to kill them too. Got all that?

Unlikely alliances form to narrow down the factions. Outside of Van Damme, the acting was acceptable. While the plot sounds complex, it really isn't that hard to follow, unless you have problems following Steven Seagal movies. It takes a while to build up all the factions and reasons for wanting to kill each other, but once it does things move rather quickly.

F-bomb (with Ukrainian accent), violence against women (its a Van Damme film), brief nudity, torture.",1313280000,,1813,4.798076923076923

4620476,4,B00596WEVI,"Assassination Games opens with a demonstration of the smooth proficiency of hitman Vincent Brazil (Jean-Claude Van Damme) as he attacks with his primary weapons of choice - anything with a blade. The tone of the movie is then set for the dealings of those in this dark business and the cold, callous exteriors these professional killers display. But they are human after all, so expect to find that they do have a heart thought it may generally stay deeply buried.

Roland Flint (Scott Adkins) prefers to make his hits with his considerable arsensal of firearms. Brazil and Flint are brought together when they each go after the same target but for very different reasons. Soon they become the targets for hits and forge a necessary but uncomfortable union. Can they or should they trust each other? Hitmen like to work alone.

Van Damme and up-and-comer Adkins deliver a few good fight scenes but emphasis is on their weapons and their relationship as they take on mobsters and dirty government officials. While the plot is not unique, Assassination Games has moments when it stands solidly on it's on feet. A very good supporting cast elevates this to a movie that has been shown in limited theatrical release and lands high on the heap of strait to DVD action films. If action is what you're after plus a few grisly surprises, Assassination Games will not disappoint.",1312329600,8,1370,4.85042735042735

Brazil enters his apartment and goes into his secret room. Elsewhere three men talk about a loose end. They plan to remove this problem. One stranger visits a small town, he tells about Polo. A man visits a store to collect his pay and learn about a new job offer. There is a flashback to an earlier assault. The man remembers it and decides to take the job. Another man waits with a rifle. A van drives by, an arrow hits the wrong man. Another man fires with his rifle but misses! Another failed attempt. Brazil saves a young woman. [Is this bait for a trap?]

A man invades a guarded estate, then finds a rival. They make a deal. Flint meets the armorer and negotiates for information. There is a surprise! Polo has a picture of his hunter. The Boss is threatened in his own home! Polo seeks information and gets a surprise! They are looking for Flint too. Is the price right? People choose their death when they choose their life. Polo questions a captive to get information. Then a deal is made. City Hall at 9 am is the rendezvous. But a neighbor talks to Polo! Be careful is always good advice. But things go wrong, very wrong. Where is Flint? Flint is tortured to make tell where the money is. But these bad guys get a surprise! More bodies fall, and Flint is rescued. The line was cut. Theres another body.

Flint gets a call on his video phone, a threat. They surrender. Can twelve million buy a life? The fight starts, then the shooting. Please forgive me! yells Polo. Is it too late? Is it over? No, more bodies fall. Now the revenge is complete. Can Flints wife be cured? Its expensive. A man visits a church. Will he change?

This is a simple story complicated by corruption among officials. Was it based on true events of Interpol corruption? There is little news about European activities in the local newspapers nowadays.

Assassination Games, very decently filmed, goes wrong early.

This film itself is a study in cinematography, presenting sepia backgrounds, colour saturated foregrounds.  Brilliant filming. We might view films for plotting as well as for technique.  Assassination Games, which plays off an earlier film, Assassins (1995), with Stallone and Bandera in the USA, presents to me technical film making brilliance.  Also see Six Bullets, another JC van Damme Romanian film.  High studies in filming technique.

The film works like the Stallone/Banderas actioner ""Assassins."" That film was enjoyable, but it's 130-minute runtime brought it down. ""Assassination Games"" is thirty minutes shorter, and actually seems to cram in more action in an hour and a half than ""Assassins"" did. To call ""Games"" superior may seem like an odd thing for one to say, but between Van Damme's carefully fine-tuned presence and Adkins' usual charisma, it's hard to deny the difference between those two and Stallone and Antonio Banderas is quite noticeable. The movie also looks polished and well-edited, especially for a film that did not go to theaters. Van Damme looks good and Adkins is someone to root for. Adkins' career is certainly moving up, and he's someone to watch for. Van Damme is a classic, and in this one he shows he can still literally kick bad-guy butt!",1359676800,2,1054,5.0285714285714285

The quality of this action film is better than most of the stuff being pumped out these days.  Good cinematography, surprisingly good subtle performances (especially from JCVD), lots of action, bad guys, corruption, and revenge.  All the right ingredients for some good entertainment.

4620525,4,B00596WEVI,"I'm glad to say that this isn't a Van Damme movie but a movie with Van Dame in it. Ever since I saw him in JCVD, and realized he could actually act, I was hoping he would be in better projects. Lo and behold, here it is.

Here's the scoop. Van Damme is a hit man for hire. Scott Adkins is a hit man retired to take care of his comatose wife, who was put into the coma by a really bad guy. Van Damme takes a contract on said bad guy for big bucks. Adkins wants in on the hit for revenge. The two form an uncomfortable alliance to do the job. There's a bit more but why spoil.

This is a cool, if derivative story. Some of the plot points you've seen before. What's happening here is the fact that it's all rather un-sensational. The fights are neat and tough. No jumping around with impossible kicks and such. The Van Damme character is quiet and reserved. He handles his hits like a professional (with one grave exception), gets paid and pursues the things he likes. He's a bit anal retentive but it doesn't get in the way of things. The Adkins character is also quiet. He lives off in the country and spends much of his time taking care of his wife. Both men are assured in their abilities to perform. No strutting or posturing. Just get the job done and get out.

This is shot and cut well. The performances are decent and it's directed well. It's not great art but it is good craft. If you like a mature, tight action flick you could do a lot worse.",1332547200,,1452,4.141843971631205
4620526,4,B00596WEVI,"I bought this movie not sure exactly what to expect.  JCVD had gotten away from his body being his primary weapon to a gun being his primary weapon over the years (Until Death, Wake of Death, etc).  While JCVD is always in good shape, I think watching a 50-something kick butt on younger enemies would be hard to believe...even if he could actually do it.  It was smart of him to get more away from what made him famous to something else.  In this movie, JCVD's main weapon of choice was knives.  I would like to see JCVD evolve even more into other types of roles.  It seems that as he's moved away from the one-on-one physical contact, he's moved into more shocking, gory and bloody violence.  I thought the drill scene in Wake of Death was quite shocking when I first saw it.  There were a couple of deleted scenes in Assassination Games (they were included on the DVD) that were pretty gory.  You don't need to show the gore to get the point across.  After the making of the movie, JCVD, I hoped to see JCVD do other types of movies besides action movies.  Why can't he be in a drama with a central part of the movie being a relationship with a woman?  Why is it always action movies, with very limited female relationships incorporated?  And of late, it seems that his dialogue in his movies is cut way back.  He has an accent, so what?  I've seen his older movies like Kickboxer and Bloodsport, and he does a lot more talking in those movies than he's been allowed to do since he became a bigger star.  He was not impossible to understand in those older movies, so why can't he have a more speaking presence on screen now?  I think that JCVD could have wider appeal if he would widen the types of movies that he does.  As long as he relegates himself to just action movies, he will only appeal to the action movie fan base.  And with his age, and direct to DVD movies, he's just going to be viewed as one of those ""used to wases,"" with no access to a wider fan base.  I'd love to see JCVD's re-emergence into mainstream movies again.  But he needs to expand into other movie genres if he wants that to happen.  I'll know he's back when I see him on Jay Leno or David Letterman.  He may accomplish this with his appearance in the Expendables II, but that star will quickly fade.  It's just a movie FULL of ""used to wases,"" and it will have a very brief life as the first one did.  It will not be what shoots him back into mainstream movies for good.  It will just be a movie to reminisce about the good ol' days, and those days are long gone!

I liked Scott Adkins in this movie.  I thought the teaming-up of his character with JCVD's character was good.  It was interesting.  I would recommend this movie to any JCVD or Scott Adkins fan.  And even if you're not a fan of either of these guys, the movie is entertaining enough to hold your interest.  I thought JCVD's son, Kristofer, was a very weak character in the movie. He was not believable in the role he was playing.  He was supposed to be playing a crooked cop, and he just didn't have the screen presence for that type of heavy.  JCVD's daughter, Bianca, had a very limited speaking role in the film.  She spent her on-screen time in an unresponsive coma.  It's nice that JCVD can give his kids acting opportunities, though.

All in all, I thought the movie was a good addition to the other 35+ JCVD movies that I own.  Not at the top of the heap (TimeCop, In Hell, Until Death, Maximum Risk, Wake of Death, Nowhere to Run, Universal Soldier, etc.), but nowhere near the bottom of the heap (Hard Corps, Derailed, Street Fighter, The Order) either.  It sits comfortably in the middle in my humble opinion.",1324425600,,3668,4.32258064516129

This movie is MUCH better than the vast majority of Jean Claude's early works...even those with a legitimate budget. Van Damme has aged incredibly well for a man with a known history of self abusive tendencies...it appears as if Jean Claude might remember filming this little gem of a movie.
The co-star, whose name I immediately forgot, tried desperately to steal this movie..it almost seemed like JCVD was used as a launch device for whatisnames career..didn't work. I only remember Van Damme's role....whatever, I am wool gathering now.
Good film and a joy to watch. I highly recommend the movie and ask that everyone continue to provide Jean Claude with enough vice money to make his life liveable for him. He always pays you back with interest.

4620530,4,B00596WEVI,"I enjoyed ""Assassination Games.""  No one should watch a Jean Claude Van Damme film expecting Marlon Brando or a classic story.  But as an action film, this holds up well.  Van Damme is again the strong silent type with his good looks translating well as he ages a bit.  Scott Adkins makes the greatest impression in the film, looking good as he hangs tortured and suspended from the ceiling, pained by his wife's death and fierce at exacting revenge.  I see he was in ""Borne Ultimatum""; and I'll have to watch it again to spot him.  Marija Karan does a nice job as October, the prostitute with no options who causes Van Damme to enter the church as the film concludes.  I'd seen her earlier this year as a Russian tennis player on the cable TV series ""Covert Affairs.""  She does a nice job.  Ivan Kaye as the major bad guy Polo Yakur who is released from a Romanian prison to be a sitting duck with competing assassins gives a good performance, albeit one with little range demanded of him.  Director Ernie Barbarash is moving on from Van Damme to a Dolph Lungren project called ""The Package.""  It must pay the bills.  ""Assassination Games"" is surprising good, given that you want to sit back and enjoy the action.  Enjoy!",1322265600,,1222,4.525114155251141
4620531,5,B00596WEVI,Jean-Claude Van Damme and Scott Adkins both played excellent roles as money for hire and out for revenge respectively. The plot was very well written and a lot of action to go along with it.,1321488000,,190,4.457142857142857
4620532,4,B00596WEVI,"I was way-stoked about this one.  I mean, c'mon.  Scott Adkins (Ninja, Undisputed II) and Van Damme (The Quest, Bloodsport)?  I'm there!  Hell, I was there yesterday.

 The opener is Van Damme disguised in some hideous sideburns performing a clever assassination of some Euro-mob father-of-the-bride.  Well done, and already more promising than most of Van Damme's work in the past decade.  Thankfully, the sideburns do not endure throughout the movie.  What does is some surprisingly decent camera work, abrupt but good combat work, and not so surprisingly mediocre acting.  Van Damme has a hitman-chic, secret bachelor pad, a cute turtle, and a violin collection.

Then we cut to Scott Adkins, who is sponge-bathing the catatonic wife in a bedroom the size of a quadriplex.  Oh, yeah, he's also a hitman.  These guys both agree to do the same job, end up planning on doing it at the same time, and it gets botched.  They fight.  They make up.  They work together.  To give the stars some flavor, some concepts were clearly borrowed from other movies.  Adkins pulls some a la-The Professional vanishing acts while Van Damme has a rather Transporter-ish unwelcomed female guest (who also smacks of an older, emotion-evoking Natalia Portman from The Professional).  These are over embellishments, of course.

Some interesting things stuck out in this movie.  1  The filmmakers really tried to make this good--for a straight-to-DVD action flick they did, but I won't dare suggest it should've been in theaters.  2  Time is a strong element.  I think they were going for a subtle motif, but it is way in your face.  3  Neither hitman needs the money.  They kill to fill some other void.  4) Van Damme hasn't been working out nearly as much as Adkins.
In the end, this was a solid straight-to-DVD action flick that made me want to re-watch Double Impact and Undisputed II where they each shined brightest.",1320278400,,1901,4.908517350157728
4620533,4,B00596WEVI,"this was a fairly good movie
seems like martial art movies are dying out
nothing from Steven Seagal in a long time
did find one by Chuck Norris I hadn't seen",1318291200,,157,4.096774193548387
4620534,4,B00596WEVI,"For a movie plagued with pre production problems such as this one,where Van Damme`s proposed co-star Steven Seagal dropped out and the story`s premise was re-written,it is a wonder the film came out as well as it did. Starring along with Van Damme is Scott Rudin(X men Origins:Wolverine) and Van Damme`s two siblings,son Kristopher as one of the two corrupt Interpol agents and his daughter Bianca who plays Rudin`s bed ridden wife Anna Flint. Again Van Damme and company have picked a good solid group of actors and behind-the-camera crew so that the results are quite good.
The plot involves the head of Interpol,under investigation for selling and profiting through illegal arms sales. There is an open end he wants closed,in the form of an assassin for hire named Roland Flint. Flint took the proceeds from a sale gone bad and went into hiding after his wife was brutally raped(and left in a coma)and Flint himself almost killed,by a local Romanian thug by the name of Polo. Simultaneously we have another assassin for hire in the picture and his name is Vincent Brazil(Van Damme).Brazil`s oft used contact for jobs gives him the assignment of coincidentally killing Polo. At the same time Flint is also given the job by an old Interpol contact,but does not know who his target is or that there is another involved. Flint`s job is in actuality a ruse by the head of Interpol and two agents in on his corruption scheme,to snuff out Flint so they can get rid of their loose end once and for all.
The moment of truth arrives as Polo is set up above and across of the assassination location. Out walks Polo,Flint lines his shot and fires but hits the roof of a small truck as it rounds the corner and into his line of fire. The driver is none other than Brazil who,distracted by Flint`s shot,misses and kills Polo`s only brother instead,speeding off. Frustrated Polo comes downstairs,gun in hand and walks towards the startled crowd. As he lifts his weapon to fire the two Interpol agents in a car near the scene,fire knocking the gun out of his hand. This creates enough of a diversion to enable Flint to escape. Polo is of course bent on revenge and finding out who killed his brother,Flint is more enraged than ever because his target is his old nemesis and he missed,Brazil is mad because of the interloper who cost him a kill and Interpol STILL wants Flint silenced.
Brazil catches up to Flint and they briefly have a Mexican stand off in a warehouse. They hash out their differences and decide to work together to bring Polo down. However Polo is not standing still and has his men searching for any clues to Brazil and his whereabouts and distributing pictures of him all over town. Eventually it is a disgruntled neighbour of Brazil`s that discloses his whereabouts. Also Brazil`s jobs contact has offered him a substantial remuneration if he turns his new `partner`(Flint) in. All he has to do is get him to a location and the rest will be done by the ``employer``.Brazil at this point has no idea of the Interpol connection(the ``employer``in this case),Polo`s involvement with them or with Flint`s history with either. Polo`s appearance is the ruse to again lure Flint out and Flint is captured with little struggle as Brazil looks coldly on,another job done.
Flint is taken to a remote warehouse and tortured for info on the whereabouts of the money he took from them long ago. Brazil has had time to think and approaches his jobs man once again and asks for the location of the warehouse. Brazil has now absorbed enough information to determine the connections and that he was set up and in turn set up his ``partner`` and does not like it. He rescues Flint and they kill the interrogating Interpol agents. Next on the list is Polo himself,but he is seemingly one step ahead and he has found Flint`s home and is with his comatose wife,threatening to kill her altogether this time. This brings Flint and Brazil back to Flint`s home and together unarmed,they are forced to walk into Polo`s clutches. Polo is delighted at the thought of being able to take care of two birds with one stone but he hasn`t counted on the resourcefulness of the pair. Flint had previously installed a high powered remote controlled rifle outside his home and with the touch of a remote laying on the table(which Polo thought was nothing but a phone),it gives them the distraction they both need to get the upper hand and bring control to their situation. Polo is the last alive,defiant to the end and Brazil leaves him with Flint as he steps outside for air. When Flint rejoins Brazil,Brazil says there is one more thing left to do;actually one thing each. Flint takes down the head of Interpol and Brazil takes out the disgruntled neighbour who squealed to Polo about where he lived. The film ends as we see Flint talking to a medical specialist about an important operation for his wife and as Brazil lights a candle in a church for a dead friend and leaves.
Both Brazil and Flint are characters that are fleshed out very nicely,and as a result two people we can easily identify with. Flint`s life as a hired gun,was totally shattered since the day he,and especially his wife was attacked and she was put into a permanent bed ridden state;and his face and mannerisms show it. He lives day to day in a protective mode;a loving husband dutifully looking after his partner. Brazil on the other hand is a hired gun like Flint,but the years of killing and torment show in his well worn face. He is a methodical man as we see when he first comes home and straightens little items up in his apartment as he goes through it. He has no personal life and is very much the loner. With these characters fleshed out as they are and expanded on wonderfully by Van Damme and Rudin,there is no where to go but up. The two,though similar are very different,but they blend together well when the rubber hits the road. Polo,played with great menace and panache by Ivan Kaye,is also a welcome protagonist for the two along with the Interpol chief. To give the movie an even better dynamic the entire movie was filmed in a filtered or sepia-like colour tone. Nice.
Technically speaking the movie looks clear and crisp and is in its original a/r of 1:85:1. Extras include the trailer,previews and some deleted scenes.
Another nice vehicle for Van Damme who has Scott Rudin along for the ride this time, and who comes up to the challenge with extra to spare. The entire cast is as solid as the writing/plot. Recommended.",1317859200,,6488,4.677165354330708
4620535,4,B00596WEVI,"In the past things were too busy, business too hectic to write reviews, but with today's economy... (shrug)

I mention it because several years ago I wanted to review a shockingly good Jean-Claude Van Damme flick. Believe me, it sounded crazy even as I was saying it. But the truth is - given the right vehicle and direction the man *can* act. But again, time passed, and now I'd have to look up the film's title and rewatch it in order to stand by that statement.

However, the other night I screened a more recent film project and I have to say: It makes me wonder what his career would look like today, and how we would view him (not as a punchline to many a joke) had he done more work along these lines. This movie is very decent bordering on pretty good. He plays to his strengths, having maintained the prerequisite six-pack body and solid physical presence, but deftly avoids falling back into the old routine of kicking and punching his way thru a script.

Not sure if he himself recognized it or he listened to someone he trusts, but the world of martial arts, as in all things, progressed. Those mile-high kicks and incredible flexibility shots have long since fallen out of favor, and quite frankly look ludicrous in today's action films where kinetic energy is mixed with new school ground-n-pound and old school Japanese jiu jitsu.

Gone is the complete focus on the martial arts, gone too are his looks. The years have taken their toll and it honestly looks pretty good on him. He finally has the rugged element to match his physical ability, a world weariness similar to the transition Sam Shepard went through. And like the acclaimed writer/actor, gained depth through attrition what they couldn't muster as younger performers. They earned cred by living through hard times. Some in the craft find their ""voice"" by going through Life, and if they're very fortunate, it will lead to a second turn on the carousel. If not, oblivion, and hopefully a smooth transition back to being a regular person.

In this production Jean-Claude portrays Vincent, a supremely competent mechanic who promptly executes his work, returns home and quietly prepares for his next assignment. That's it. With the exception of a tiny turtle who fears him and a collection of violins, that's the entirety of his existence.

And that's about to change.

He's offered a new lucrative contract. However, it's one that his business agent points out is extremely dangerous, even for a man with his skills. But the pay is double his normal fee, so there's no hesitation, he agrees to take on the assignment. Kept from him is the reason why this target has been selected for death. He's a criminal overlord who is being used as bait for yet another assassin. Said other contractor has a blood vendetta against the crime boss for beating and gang raping his wife into a permanent vegetative state. So when he learns that the scum that was responsible is to be set free from prison, it draws him out of his seclusion.

Vincent doesn't realize that the job is not the real reason he's been hired. His actual purpose: A stalking horse. That doesn't become clear until the two assassins choose the exact same moment to take out the mob boss. Unfortunately, each hitter interferes with the other's kill shot. Realizing what happened, they switch their focus and decide to use their abilities against each other.

Their meeting is bone-crushing and lead-laden. Each is a professional and each refuses to give up. Bloodied and sore, they begin to develop respect for the other's ability. Pausing the battle to seek out enlightenment, they do the unexpected and begin to exchange information. It's finally clear that they've both been set-up and perhaps they need to stop trying to kill each other and reassess the situation; figure out who's really pulling the strings and who is the true target.

My only complaints were minor. The emotional accoutrements - the turtle and violins - were a bit of a copout, attempting to humanize Vincent's character. On one hand I appreciate that many of these individuals need some other element, some diversion not associated with the job. But on the other hand, I wonder why the need for these oft-used tropes? I often wonder how realistic this aspect is given it's been boilerplate script for hitmen in films for at least the past fifty years. Is it a truth that filmmakers have captured? Or a contrivance that has worked its way into the group consciousness of creators the world over? At least the James Bond villain&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scaramanga/dp/B00004RG63/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scaramanga</a>&nbsp;(Christopher Lee) did the job to enjoy a lavish lifestyle, ditto the scene-stealing performance by Richard Jenkins in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Absolute-Power/dp/0790731959/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Absolute Power</a>'.

4620536,4,B00596WEVI,"Surprisingly good first, because Jean-Claude even though he is a major character plays a more subtle low-key role which actually works and is a noticeable improvement over several of his past decade or so film attempts. Second, Adkins also subtle quiet assassin performance seemed to fit well with Jean-Claude. Third, the script had a nice flow with a few creative twists and, of course, the usual mayhem. Fourth, the directing was quite good in that it allowed the story to quietly unfold without a lot of visual or auditory noise to mask any inadequacies in the acting, story or setting.

The only real negative is that too many of the elements or sub-plots were borrowed from the truckloads of other similar movies of the past. The hiding ex-operative; the assassin for hire with secret arsenals and quirky abodes; the back room middle man; CIA or similar organizations with some ethically questionable dealings and coverups; adversaries that switch allegiances and team up.

8462790,3,B00596WEVI,I know for a fact that Scott Adkins is the younger version of Van Damme and is great in martial arts fast paced fighting  but in this movie its like the fight scenes were just all out lazy. He left himself so vulnerable to the bad guys and gets his ass kicked. Vam Damme did not do much either but remain as a quiet loner. . I expected more from these  two playing together. And the ending was also disappointing.,1508198400,,413,4.15
