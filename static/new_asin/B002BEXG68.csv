3893657,5,B002BEXG68,"i ordered this movie a couple yrs ago & love it. on quiet days when i want to watch a movie this is the one i go to. this movie goes to show that you NEVER know where you'll find love or who you'll find love with & shows that where you think there's love there may not be & also goes to show your heritage IS a part of you whether you like it or not. her co-star Brad Johnson still has what it takes to make a woman swoon. this movie along with these others are great for a day of quiet movie watching; Fullfillment w/Cheryl Ladd,Morning Glory w/Christopher Reeve,Tho none go with me w/Cheryl Ladd,The Magic of Ordinary Days w/Skeet Ulrich all great little movie's.
i'm not too fond of Farah but this is one of her best along with The Burning Bed.

8361161,5,B002BEXG68,"Farrah at her best. Her character is so real. This film reminds me of some people who I grew up with in rural America. Even though I am from a city environment, I spent my summers in a small rural farm visiting my grandparents. These actors did an amazing job of re-creating this type of town. Bravo!

8361163,5,B002BEXG68,Farrah was excellent so was the plot of the movie you will enjoy the story she make you feel all that is going on.  She is good with the saving the family farm from being sold she plays a range of being a running wild woman to being a settled down home town little woman set on the goal of being a success at farming with pigs that seem to something you would never guess she could do.  really well acted.  cast was picked good for their roles.  You really hate her sister. We miss you Farrah,1332374400,3,492,4.041237113402062
