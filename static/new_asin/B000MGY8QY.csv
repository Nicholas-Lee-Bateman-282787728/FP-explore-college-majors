8188809,5,B000MGY8QY,"I received this VHS tape recently and only a week after I ordered it, it came to my doorstep (I think. I wasn't home @ the time). I grew up with this show when it was on in America and all these years later I still think it's awesome! ^_^

My review for the way it came 2 me: A+. It was in an envelope packet with bubblewrap around the inside. It also came with a thank you note 4 buying it from the people! Wasn't expecting that @ all! :)

The tape itself: A+. It wasn't torn or damaged at all! The box was a LITTLE damaged, but I don't care about that.

The only problem I have with this tape (plus the others) is how they like to put episodes that are one tape onto another. To me, it just wastes room where they could have put an episode that they HADN'T put there at! The last 2 episodes on here are already on 2 other tapes: tape 1 and one titled, ""A Magical Adventure"" which I got on Ebay.

If anyone hasn't seen this show yet, I don't care if it's 4 kids or not I recommended you see it A.S.A.P! It's as much for adults as it is for children. Also, this is the original Canadian version. Not edited to suit the 'perfect family audience' which is what it seems people are ding with shows now-a-days. >_<

I think my favorite episode on this tape is, ""Lassie Go Home"". It's a cute episode. :)

Anyway, if your not too paranoid on what your children watch, I recommend this tape. Really the series. :) Happy shopping!",1248998400,,1422,4.078853046594982
