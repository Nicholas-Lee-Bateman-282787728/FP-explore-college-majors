8085965,5,B000BF0CRA,"This is the story about a extra ordinary man. About a man who was not afraid to do the right thing. About a lawyer who
did the right thing and made this country a better place to live. Justice Marshall did something wonderful for all people.
He taught us by example that's it's a good thing to fight and use your head to fight with. He fought with the most powerful
weapon we have. Our minds. Justice Marshall made it possible for us to get to know each other. This biography should
be required to be seen in schools all over America, starting in grade 1.",1399766400,,555,4.245283018867925
8085966,5,B000BF0CRA,"This DVD gives  an informative portrait of Justice Thurgood Marshall's extraordinary life.
It depicts the life of a man of conviction for equal justice under the law.  It also includes information on key influences in his life:  father/mother; Charles Hamilton Houston; Howard Law School.
Justice Thurgood Marshall was a drum major for justice.  He helped to emancipate America's legal system from shame. He helped America to become legally a more humane nation.

A companion DVD to watch is ""The Road to Brown"" ... biography of Charles Hamilton Houston.
Also, the DVD's:  ""Simple Justice"" and ""With All Deliberate Speed""
Book:  Simple Justice : The History of Brown v. Board of Education and Black America's Struggle for Equality ... by Richard Kluger

In my opinion, this DVD should be standard viewing and discussion in all American public schools.",1392940800,,851,5.205882352941177
8085967,4,B000BF0CRA,"This is a very important peice of History for our younger generation, who knows nothing of our first ever african american chief justice on the Supreme Court. Many younger person are aware of the renaming of BWI airport in his honor but they are not old enough to remember the civil rights cases and battle which he fought before becoming a chief justice on the supreme court. The biography is short in length, but gives you a look into his upbringing, and how he worked his way to beoming an accomplished attorney and then being appointed to the court. Also, the excerpts from various other biographies done by the History Channel and other specials helped to bring things together.",1270598400,3,683,4.7478991596638656
8085968,5,B000BF0CRA,"This is a wonderful, entertaining, and informative video about Thurgood Marshall. I am a graduate student and presented the video to other graduate students in a Diversity class that I was co-teaching. The video spurred thoughtful discussion and critical thinking... I highly recommend it!",1260489600,2,289,5.590909090909091
8085969,4,B000BF0CRA,"If you are a fan of African-American history and know the importance of Justice Marshall, then not much is new here.  However, this documentary would be great for those unfamiliar with him, especially African-American young students.  Not only did he help to end legalized segregation, but he had many wonderful qualities.  He was a great speaker, an awesome writer, a hard worker, and devoted family man, and much more.  He was the valedictorian of his law class and had judicial experience, so conservatives cannot maintain that yap-yap that he ""wasn't qualified.""  This documentary reiterates what a hero he should be to many.

According to Rachel Moran, most interracial couples are made of one person of color and one white person.  Interracial couples composed of two people of color do not get enough coverage in the United States.  Many people have forgotten that P. Diddy was with J. Lo.  Many people do not know that Carlos Santana's wife is African American.  So this documentary shows Justice Marshall's Asian-American wife, but never lists her ethnicity.  (Was she Thai-American?)  It never mentions if they had difficulties living as a Black-Asian couple.  The couple's sons are interviewed and they have visible Asian features.  I wonder if the documentary makers assumed that Asianness speaks for itself here.  Still, this is an avenue that they should have explored, especially in light of the celebration of multiculturalism and mixed-race families, yet they did not.

This documentary includes interviews from Blacks and whites, women and men.  It turns out that Juan Williams wrote Marshall's biography.  I had only known of him as a journalist.  I am impressed that he could complete such a difficult task, unrelated to his typical work.

This documentary only says, ""Justice Marshall wished he could have seen another Democratic President"" and then it mentions that he died a few days after President Clinton's inauguration.  However, what really happened is that Marshall wished he could have retired under a Democratic presidency, so that another progressive or person of color could be named as his replacement.  I had always heard that Marshall was emphatically irked that Clarence Thomas got his seat.  So this idea that he died with everything to his satisfaction is false.  Again, the Biography series waters down progressive politics, probably to appease Middle Americans and their embrace of the Right.  I found this spin in the documentary very cowardice.

Do see this work if you get the chance.",1146528000,8,2528,5.1802469135802465
