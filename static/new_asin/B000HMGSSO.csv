There is some educational value but just tid bits. It is fun seeing how close Dave Salmari can get to the lions and the felines reactions at times but its surely no Marlin Perkins or David Attenborough.",1236211200,,342,4.716666666666667
8214255,5,B000HMGSSO,"This first aired on the discovery channel. I was absolutely riveted to the screen. You have never seen anything so incredible as this show! It was intense, terrifying, and would leave your mouth hanging open. You just keep asking yourself how something like this could have been caught on camera. Trust me on this one. It is not to be missed.",1182297600,,342,4.622950819672131
