8319843,4,B001LRTTAS,"This grew on me as I watched it, and lingered in my mind afterwards.  It takes a mosaic look at a day and night in the lives of a bunch of Quebecois teens.

This was made on what looks like $5, shot on often grainy video.  The film is softer and gentler, with more of a sense of humor than Kids to which it is often compared, due to both its subject matter and its rough edged, semi-improvisational style.  But by covering more characters over its short running time we don't really get to know any of these kids very well, or identify much with them personally.  Its effect is more of accumulation than of specific dramatic moments.  And there are times when the film can feel like its dealing in (often comic) caricature or stereotypes, rather than specific, real human beings.  Yet, by the end I felt a wistful sadness at the trials and tribulations of adolescence - so universal in the end - no matter how much the surface time or location changes.",1455148800,,952,4.405714285714286
