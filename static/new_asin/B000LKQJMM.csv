8161995,1,B000LKQJMM,"I just purchased the new Film Detective Restored Version of Divorce His, Divorce Hers, billed as the full 180 minute project. The Amazon listing says that this is 180 minutes long, so does the box copy and the DVD itself. However, the disc runs only 1 hour and 14 minutes. I will be returning my copy for a refund.",1480377600,4,314,4.338983050847458

8161998,3,B000LKQJMM,"DIVORCE HIS / HERS was the last of eleven pictures the legendary team of Taylor and Burton starred in. Months after it aired, the two were themselves divorced (for the first time). Their Oct. '75 remarriage didn't survive nine months.

DIVORCE HIS (TV-USA/UK-1977) - Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, Carrie Nye, Barry Foster
First 77-minute half of a two-night television movie event shows the disintegration of a long-time marriage through progressive flashbacks. This version of the story is the husband's perspective.

DIVORCE HERS (same as above)
Conclusion of the story reuses many sequences from the first part, but now they're viewed through the wife's eyes. Thus for example, a conversation the husband was having that got interrupted by the wife, one we were privy to originally, is now seen from afar, as she, and we, enter his view. Love the concept, but it somehow doesn't totally work.",1301702400,3,899,5.1506849315068495
