5370402,5,B009WS9GF6,"Good Lord, this was chilling.  Thought about this movie for weeks after watching it, it was very intense.  A must see.",1388102400,,118,4.571428571428571
5370403,4,B009WS9GF6,I have met Charlie. And i was just a little girl when this happened in my hometown. Amazing how he and his family have turned this around and are still healing but have come a long way.,1386892800,2,185,4.027027027027027
5370404,2,B009WS9GF6,"I took a couple of drama classes in college, mostly to fulfill some liberal arts requirements, and one of the things that I remember most:  every film needs at least one sympathetic character that the audience can root for.  The creators of this film seemed to forget this very basic-and-necessary requirement, as they took a story that should have been quite riveting and turned it into an almost unwatchable scratch-your-head fest.

I didn't much like Dennis Rader, aka ""BTK.""  Not much explanation is required there.  I didn't much like the reporters for the local television station covering the trial and sentencing of Mr. Rader; those reporters, when they didn't realize they were being filmed by the ""I Survived BTK"" film crew, stood around chuckling.  Later, when they know they're on camera, they're once again all serious.  (I have to admit, I've always strongly disliked reporters.  They seem so fake to me that it, well, makes me want to puke.)  I didn't much like the protestor gal outside of the trial from a local church, who used an odd non sequitur to somehow compare the evil deeds of Mr. Rader to abortion.  I didn't much like another guy outside the trial, arguing that cameras should be put up everywhere to ""eradicate an environment where people like Dennis Rader can prosper.""  Personally, I don't know how cameras on the streets could have stopped Mr. Rader; he tended to kill people inside of their own homes.  But whatever on a very odd ""argument.""

But most of all -- and yes, I really almost hate to admit it -- I didn't have much feeling for the surviving family members of Mr. Rader's first murders.  Let's just say this:  this film would have meant a lot more to me if one of them had, say, become the CEO of some big corporation or something, but none of them seemed to go down that path.  But they seemed to bring up some conspiracy theory where one man couldn't have killed the whole family in the manner that happened; and while I would normally agree, I'm not sure that the survivors were paying attention to Mr. Rader's crimes.  Mr. Rader had a way of eliminating a lot of people quickly; he was surely ""efficient"" at his crimes.

I saw nothing but great reviews about this film, fives across the board, and I thought, ""Wow.  This is gonna be a good one!""  Boy, was I wrong.  This would be a big pass on a film that is still searching for that lone protagonist that I can root for, someone that I would call a ""true survivor.""",1370476800,,2463,4.577625570776256
5370405,5,B009WS9GF6,"Gritty, personal storytelling reveals the true cost of murder to individuals and families who survive. The film did not dwell on the horrific crimes, but rather the intimate stories of those left behind by the tragedies. A thought-provoking and unflinching portrayal which sidesteps the overhyped drama ubiquitous in the true crime genre.",1367280000,4,338,5.519230769230769
5370406,5,B009WS9GF6,"No words to describe the horror.  I am with the subject on this, there has to be more to the case than just one man.  Especially at the start of the killings.",1367107200,,158,3.90625
5370407,5,B009WS9GF6,"There were moments that I wished I could've reached into the tube and pulverized BTK with my own hands!  This is an unimaginable, sleep-walking, kind a nightmare that just doesn't allow you to wake-up and put out of your mind. It really broke my heart to hear Charlie Otero, and even made me cry at times. Scary.",1365120000,,312,4.473684210526316
5370408,5,B009WS9GF6,"On January 15th, 1974 the town of Wichita, KS was turned upside down when four members of the Otero family were found brutally slain inside their humble home.  This murder would be the first committed by Dennis Radar, whose twisted fantasies would claim six more victims over a span of seventeen years.  The town of Wichita would come to remember the killer's sadistic calling card inscribed B.T.K. (for Bind, Torture, Kill), but what about the victims?

This film follows one of the survivors from that first crime, Charlie Otero, to see how his life was affected by that fateful day.  We see how he relives that horrible moment, how he seeks to step out from the shadow cast by the monster, and other unfortunate events that plague his life.

It's refreshing to see one man's quest to overcome the event that's defined his life.  We spend a lot of time with Charlie as he talks about his theories behind the case, his life after the event, how he gets by day to day, and how he hopes to be an inspiration to victims everywhere by NOT being a victim.  We also join Charlie in a moment that shocked the Nation, when Dennis Radar was finally captured.

It's a shocking case, with some graphic crime scene photos taken within the Otero home, but it reinforces the idea that these evil men are nothing but monsters who don't deserve the macabre fame they enjoy.

I highly recommend this film for those who want to hear a different side of the story: the survivor's.",1361404800,6,1462,4.57088122605364

8544748,1,B009WS9GF6,I really don't know where to start so I won't say much.  I can't really tell what the message is.  It seems to be a self-serving rational for the life of Otero.  I feel bad for the surviving members of the family.  But years after the fact he needs to grow up and stop being a bully and angry man.  I agree with the other reviewers about the music and lack of fluidity.  Save your money.,1517097600,,387,4.026315789473684

8544752,5,B009WS9GF6,I really liked this movie. It's not the deepest movie but I was really interested in what he had to say about this just from a crime victim perspective and how something that happened in his youth affected his life all the way to that day.,1472256000,,239,4.217391304347826
8544753,1,B009WS9GF6,"This is really about a single survivor, not so much about BTK and how they caught him. Wasn't so obvious when I rented it.",1471219200,,122,4.125
8544754,5,B009WS9GF6,"Sad, but documentary was amazing.",1463097600,,33,5.8
8544755,3,B009WS9GF6,"It's a decent documentary, but the sound track is AWFUL. It's so distracting and makes no sense in connection with the film. Charlie Otero is pretty hard to like, which makes it a struggle to truly and fairly sympathize with him to the degree you should. Also, the film is scattered. Is it about the BTK murders? Is it about Charlie Otero's life since them? Is it about his many girlfriends and exes and their lives? Is it about superstition and voodoo? What's the purpose of it? I don't think it had a solid direction in mind as it was being filmed. It doesn't feel led.

I don't know. If you're interested in the BTK murders than you should watch. Otherwise, there are better BTK documentaries out there, for sure.",1453161600,2,716,4.507692307692308
8544756,5,B009WS9GF6,"Good film originally titled ""Feast of the Assumption"" which was shown in Wichita, KS in the historic Orpheum Theatre when it first came out.  Charlie Otero tells us how he fought to get his life back after his parents and two siblings were murdered by BTK (Dennis Rader).  This film features documentary by Charlie Otero as well as Danny and Carmen Otero and Steven Relford, who was the son of Shirley Vian, another BTK victim.",1426204800,2,427,4.68
