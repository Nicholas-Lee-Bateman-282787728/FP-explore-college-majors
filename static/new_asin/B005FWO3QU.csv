8470743,1,B005FWO3QU,"I found this item to be quite disappointing.  The problem was not with the tape quality or delivery.  It was with the content.  I expected to see the women's finals match between Petra Kvitova and Maria Sharapova and this showed only about 2 minutes of the match.  I think that the cover for the item is misleading.  It gives one the idea that both men's and women's matches are covered comprehensively, and they simply are not.  Very disappointing item.",1441929600,,454,4.6835443037974684

8470745,5,B005FWO3QU,"Great dvd for fans of the game and the players. Several hours of tennis excitement with the likes of Jocovich,Nadal, and Maria Sharapova (who loses her match,but still moves the fans). Nadal loses to his greatest opponent apart from Roger Fedderer--Novach Jocovich-- in a thriller on the Centre Court grass. Worth a peek.",1393718400,,321,5.0754716981132075
