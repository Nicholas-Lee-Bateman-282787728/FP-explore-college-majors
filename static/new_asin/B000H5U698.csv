8136568,4,B000H5U698,"I love these CRYPT OF TERROR double features! In this one we get LAND OF THE MINOTAUR and TERROR. MINOTAUR is about a cult of modern day minotaur worshippers (!) that abducts and sacrifices wayward hippies who happen to stumble upon their secret lair. Led by the eeevil Baron Corofax (Peter Cushing), the cultists pretty much own the tiny greek town they practice in. A priest (Donald Pleasence) attempts to get to the bottom of the disappearances, and finds himself caught up in the horrible goings-on. Now, this is no classic, and has some long stretches of tedium, but it's not a bad film. How can you hate a movie that opens w/ human sacrifice?? In TERROR, the two remaining members of a cursed family are threatened with extinction. It seems that their ancestors burned a woman as a witch, and she didn't like the idea very much. This makes for some fairly interesting stuff, as we get an impalement,  a floating automobile, and a naked performance artist, among other things. Together, these movies are a terrific saturday afternoon time-killer...",1210550400,5,1053,4.85
8136569,1,B000H5U698,"Man, the films on this DVD released by Bci / Eclipse were nothing short of a bad grindhouse experience. The only reason I bought it was to see Cushing and Pleasance. I thought seeing them together in one flick would be amazing. Boy was I wrong.

Another thing, BCI did nothing to clean these prints up. Minotaur had a couple of annoying digital artefacts: grain, scratches, missing frames, washed out colors, and low res video. Audio was also of poor quality.

I guess I can't blame them since they probably knew in advance that this movie sucked and they didn't want it to cut into their profit.

Terror was a little more engaging but that's not saying much.

Luckily for you and me, there's a morning after where we can look forward to something better.",1187913600,6,755,4.57037037037037
