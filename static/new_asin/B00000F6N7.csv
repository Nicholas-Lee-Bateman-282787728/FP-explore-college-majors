Being a fan of Planet of the Apes I wanted to see this failed TV show. Over 12 hours of apness was filmed for an overseas Television series, but I don't know if it aired. Word is it was condensed down to this movie and released as one mess of a film. The make up is laughable and the acting is just the same. If you can find it for $10 bucks it's worth a look. I laugh every time... Hell. I like it. I last saw it on YouTube in 2012. Don't pay a lot for this as they are proubly dubbed copies or burned illegally on DVD. Look else where ...but see this movie. It's fun.",1414454400,,721,3.8133333333333335
7908236,4,B00000F6N7,"TIME OF THE APES is a bizarre, weird entry in the B~Movie category. Truly a PLANET OF THE APES inspired film, it briskly sets itself apart stamping the Japanese Style of filmmaking all over it! Crazy Ape makeup, frightened Japanese Girl, Spunky Children and Space Saucer included for that extra dash of SciFi fun! Get the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version on DVD. It is without a doubt one of the all time BEST of the WORST full-color B-Movies ever.",1405468800,,452,4.6625
7908237,4,B00000F6N7,"Dubbed talking apes in military uniforms, and lots of them.  Now you don't see that every day.  Japanese apes too, that can barely move their mouths when they talk.  Hilarious.  I love it.

The apes alone make the film extremely fun to watch.  Just like a Godzilla movie.  There's a particularly tall ape with catfish whiskers that's the funniest one of them all.  Gosh he's ugly.  Everyone calls him, ""Your Excellency,"" and he rides around in a beat-up old car.  Ha ha.

This movie was originally a TV series, and here it's repackaged and squeezed into a few hours, so the plot (what there is of it) is quite brisk.  Still, its put together way better than the Fugitive Alien movie.  We see a Japanese woman and two kids fiddling around in a lab and getting caught in some cryogenic chambers.  They wake up from their frozen state thousands of years later, to a time when Japanese apes have taken over, and still live in houses walled with paper.  The woman and kids try escaping from the hostile militant apes and meet another human fellow named Godo.  This bunch stumbles into some universal computer area (left out of the MST3K Season 3 version, unfortunately) and weird stuff happens.  The woman and kids go back to their original time where doctors offer lame explanations as to what made the time travel possible.  Godo himself ends up stranded in a desert somewhere.  Ha ha.

This movie is great with or without the MST3K crew, but I was saddened that MST3K had to cut some good stuff out.  If you happen to see this tape in a store for cheap, check it out for a good laugh.",1156032000,2,1582,4.5
7908238,2,B00000F6N7,"Actually this film aint too bad I must say compared to other  movies shown on the show. The Ape costumes and effecs are really  watchable, but the story has no merit.

However if your a fan of the Planet of the Apes movies then  this will be for you.

A family trying to get cryongenically frozen gets sent back  in time in the future when it was ruled by apes. Like I said  the makeup ape stuff is good, I was scared when I watched it,  its definitely in some cases better than that Tim Burton  garbage remake but its not a classic.

The family escapes the apes and makes friends with some of the simians out there before making plans to go back into time.  Not bad , Joel Hodgson , though and the robots do have their way
with this one.",1110672000,,738,4.090909090909091
7908239,4,B00000F6N7,"Wow, this movie is a lot better than I'd been led to believe. Aside from the ""humans captured by talking apes"" angle, it doesn't have much in common with Planet of the Apes. No primitive humans, the apes have a technological society, there's even a flying saucer. The camera work is very unusual and exciting. A lot has to be skipped over because it's a TV series turned into a movie, but you can fill in the blanks with your imagination. Of course, it has cute Japanese ladies, which right there makes it better than Planet of the Apes. It's not worth forty bucks, though.",1003190400,2,573,4.466666666666667
7908240,1,B00000F6N7,"Horrifyingly bad...
The plot seems to revolve around the story of disjointed characters that go nowhere and do nothing save getting in deep trouble every 30 seconds whereupon they escape to go about getting into trouble. Plus...how does freezing someone send them into a past that never existed? Yeah...really...bad...",975974400,3,318,5.510204081632653
