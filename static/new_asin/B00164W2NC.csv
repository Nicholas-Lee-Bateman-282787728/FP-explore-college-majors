8326125,5,B00164W2NC,"My 14 year old son's interest in soccer, let alone desire for ""extra training with Dad"" has decreased significantly in the past year. After all, he is a teenager. His interest in cone drills and similar has flat-lined.  Nevertheless, these short, fun <10 minute Aerobic soccer drills hold his interest. A few days a week have made a HUGE difference in my son's foot skills.

My son is a left defensive back and his confidence on the ball in games has increased significantly. He has greater poise, does not panic, he no longer has to always look down at the ball and is now looking for and making better passes to his midfielders.

You won't see improvement overnight, but over several weeks will yield surprisingly great results. Once you get to a certain level, this is a great video to come back to after a layoff to simply sharpen up skills. Living here in the Midwest this is a great pre-Spring drill because he don't need allot of space.",1461542400,,943,4.568047337278107

8326128,1,B00164W2NC,"This is not exactly what I am looking for. I am for a soccer training video, but this one looks more like a comedy show. The title is misleading.",1388361600,,145,4.0344827586206895
8326129,5,B00164W2NC,"My son used this 2-3 times per week for several months when he was 7 years old and still occasionally goes through a workout now at age 12.  At first he was frustrated and could not do the moves to the music during the workout.  After a 4 or 5 attempts at the video, you could start to see definite improvement.  After a month, the skills and the rhythm were evident when he played the game.

The challenge is not on the player, but the parent to be patient, supportive and persistent.  I would say 2-3 time per week for 3 weeks would make the young player self sufficient to practice this on their own.  Parents need to keep the player motivated.  Try establishing a reward system and video taping the first couple of attempts.  You won't believe the difference in these workouts and in the style over the ball during games.

Note: some of the form demonstrated is not technically correct (see the scissors).  But if you want your player to develop touch, rhythm and a feather light plant foot - this video will enable you to get you player there.

I've tried this with several kids that I've coached, most parents don't deliver on getting their kids to do the workout on a regular basis.  It's no surprise that a dvd left in it's case doesn't lead to greatness.  2-3 times per week, for several months does the trick.",1387324800,,1319,4.423236514522822
8326130,2,B00164W2NC,I could only get through about 15 minutes of this video before I could stand listening to the guy. Don't waste your time. Any of the Marty Schupak videos are the way to go.,1379635200,,172,4.088235294117647
8326131,5,B00164W2NC,"My kids love this.  I love coaching and playing soccer.  I use the techniques is this video a lot during my warmup foot skills / circle drills.
The moves are simple and effective.  I have over 100 soccer videos and this is one of my favorite.  U-Soccer is also very good.",1361491200,3,271,4.254901960784314
8326132,5,B00164W2NC,"This is one of best training dvd I have ever had.  It is fun, simple, but useful. It is great for individuals when team/club is at off season or on season.  Thanks",1218585600,5,163,4.0625
