8119248,3,B000F9RM1Q,"This is a Great DVD Set but is Missing London, French Riviera, Austria, & Italy and should only be purchased as a supplement to the original series ""Europe to the Max with Rudy Maxa"" or ""Best of Europe with Rudy Maxa""! Unfortunately there is no ultimate box set for Rudy Maxa on Europe as there is for Rick Steves'. Unfortunately the title of this dvd set suggests that this is the ultimate & newest set of the series and all you would need. However that is not the case. If you were to only buy this box set, you would be essentially missing out on the best of Europe! While this set shows more of France, touches on Spain, touches on Greece it should only be bought as a supplement if you have the original series. I recommend the more complete ultimate set of ""Rick Steves' Europe: All 80 Shows 2000-2009"" that is 13 DVD's long and doesn't miss anything. Otherwise, you will have to put together your own ultimate Maxa set with 2 box sets: ""Europe to the Max with Rudy Maxa"" & ""Europe to the Max with Rudy Maxa - Return Trip"".  Unfortunately there will be some overlap between the sets and it still won't be as thorough as Rick Steves' set.",1265587200,9,1143,4.341121495327103

These dvds have a lot of very useful tips. They show almost all of the cities we'll be visiting.",1214179200,3,273,4.42
8119250,5,B000F9RM1Q,"Great set of CDs on numerous places to visit in Europe. We feel Rudy Maxa takes you to some of the best places so you can plan your on tour of Europe. The CDs are are very good quality with many in HD. We would order again. These programs used to be shown on VOOM Netword under the Equator channel. Dish took VOOM off the air a few weeks ago. While we not able to watch all the previous segments on TV, that doen't matter since we can watch what we want when we want to. Rudy presents his travels in an interestign format, not too much history and not too much tourist stuff--just good information.",1212192000,6,598,4.163793103448276
8119251,5,B000F9RM1Q,"As far as I know of, the two main travel-guide videos are Rick Steves's and Rudy Maxa's.  Rick Steves seems to be the more popular of the two since his shows are more frequently shown on the PBS channels (at least in the DC area).  But in my opinion, Rudy Maxa's videos are much better.  First, although both are very informative, Maxa's writing and dialog seems to be better and more eloquently presented...he's almost poetic.  His narratives are clear, substantive, and colorful--like how it should be.  His portrayals also include splashes of historical facts or cultural trivia that not only make vacation spots more intriguing, they also provide the viewer with a better understanding of the people and their customs.  Second, Rudy Maxa's videos seem to be more vibrant and richer in color than Rick Steves's--blues skies are bluer and green pastures are greener.  I'm not sure if there is a varying type of filming quality, but for some reason, Rick Steves's DVDs have a dullish hue to them, even when he films under the sunniest conditions.  Third, it seems that Rudy Maxa's videos were made with a larger budget than Rick Steves's.  From what I can remember, all of Maxa's videos were always filmed on sunny days--displaying vacation spots at their best-conditioned visuals.  I remember seeing Rick Steves visiting the Swiss Alps in rainy weather--absolutely not optimal for such magnificent panoramic views.  Also, Rick Steves filmed Austria's Hallstatt--probably the most scenic Alpine town--in cloudy weather.  Finally and perhaps most importantly, Rudy Maxa's videos use ""proper"" soundtracks to complement his visual displays.  If you have ever done theater or film production, you know that the sound is almost just as important as the visual.  Maxa's use of classical music or traditional cultural music from the visited country creates an effect that unites your visual and auditory senses and produces a mood that carries you as if you were there.  Rick Steves uses some classical music, but too often utilizes...I'm not sure how to depict it, but I'll describe it as ""cheesy"" electronic keyboard music that when you see and hear it together, you say to yourself ""hmmm...something's not right.""  It's even evident in his opening credits.  Again, it seems that Rudy Maxa's budget was higher and his producers seemed to have strived for perfection to showcase vacation spots at their best rather than filming with a limited budget in mind.

If you are planning to travel, I recommend viewing both Rick Steves's videos and Rudy Maxa's videos--both will provide you with very good information and great ideas of what to do.  But, whereas Rick Steve's videos will make you say ""That would be nice to see"", Rudy Maxa's will make you exclaim... ""I have to go there!""

Regarding this box set, this series and Rudy Maxa's other box set--""Europe to the Max with Rudy Maxa""--are sensational.  From what I can tell, the shows are exactly the same as his ""Smart Travel"" series.  Each box has 6 DVDs and each DVD contains 4 or 5 ""half-hour"" shows, plus other extras such as ""Rudy's Travel Tips"".

This box set has the following DVDs and their descriptions are as follows (I'm copying verbatim from his website):
