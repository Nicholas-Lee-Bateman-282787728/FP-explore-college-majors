2162400,2,B00062IZY0,"Beware, Grossman plays the songs on this dvd, but never shows you how to play them. The tab is so different from the way he plays the songs that you have to learn them by ear. Inaccurate tab seem to be the norm with Grossman's material. It's really too bad, because he's a great guitar player. I would love to sit down with Grossman and make him play these songs using the tab provided.  Come on Stefan, buck up and proofread your material before you put it on the market.",1107907200,9,472,4.2444444444444445

This bloke knows how to teach and at no time acts superior. A master of his art for sure...yet he never talks down to you.",1393891200,3,263,4.739130434782608
8037409,5,B00062IZY0,It is an excellent DVD with many wonderful performances I had never seen before.  It is an excellent instructional tool for learning blues guitar riffs and style.,1389052800,,162,5.0
8037410,5,B00062IZY0,"All content in these ""Blues Guitar"" sets is top notch and the instruction is concise and well thought out. A++",1381708800,2,110,4.55
8037411,5,B00062IZY0,"The guitar lessons from Stefan Grossman have improved over time; just as technology has improved.

This 2 DVD lesson is an improvement from the original release with terrific camera angles, close ups and the gifted teaching we have become used to from Stefan Grossman.  This, along with the Blues Series (1-3) is another must for acoustic blues.  This particular DVD lesson goes well with Country Blues in Open Tunings as these songs work with or without the slide.",1301270400,6,465,4.935897435897436
8037412,5,B00062IZY0,"Bottleneck Blues Guitar has been completely revised from the earlier version.  Be sure to buy the revised two disc lesson.

The new lesson is a great overview of a variety of bottleneck styles and techniques. Stefan breaks the lessons into two discs, open G and open D tunings.  The lessons are fantastic and he does a great job of putting actual footage and recordings in the discs.

The DVDs contain a great collection of classic bottleneck slide songs and the split screen teaching is very helpful.",1298246400,8,501,4.790697674418604
8037413,5,B00062IZY0,"Stefan Grossman has been devoted to blues guitar in every form since the early sixties and has probably delved more deeply into the form than just about anybody on the planet. He and Rory Block pretty much make up the dynamic duo of this form and are close friends from what I understand. As for this DVD, I love it. It is more toward the beginner side of a technique study but would serve any player who wants to clean up his slide act and get some insider views of older blues players. Stefan definitely has what could be called great ""bedside manner"" when it comes to teaching via this DVD. He is utterly friendly, clear, precise, simple in his approach and very charming to boot. I have sat many times just to watch him play the songs he teaches in the DVD. It's just a basic demonstration of some old standard blues songs, but they are so well done, so rich, so full of style and good sound that I love this DVD just as a way to absorb the very goodness of the blues. He has inspired me to dust off both of my wonderful slide guitars, one in open G, the other open E, soon to be dropped to D, and play. I highly recommend this good basic slide guitar lesson as an entry point into the style, and for the sheer enjoyment of watching and listening to a genuine master of the art.

8037414,5,B00062IZY0,"This is a fantastic product. Stefan Grossman is such a valuable resource, and provides good material for learning complete slide guitar songs. The tunes are broken down well, and the tab is very helpful. Those who whine about the tab, don't seem to realize that tab can only take you so far. Learn the tab, and watch Stefan Grossman play the song. With patience and practice you will get it.",1281398400,,391,4.6
8037415,4,B00062IZY0,"This is a decent DVD, and worth buying.  There are pros and cons to the thing, so here they go:

PROS:

- Good tunes.  Several of these songs are standards in the blues world, furthermore, Stefan's arrangements are quite good.  They provide a solid version that is fun to play, cool to hear, and not too difficult to learn.

- There are tunes in both Open G and D

- The tunes gradually get more difficult, so you do build on the skills you learn.  Some folks may not like this, but I actually think it's cool...it feels like a real class.

- The main influence in these tunes is Fred McDowell.  Brozman seems very grounded in RJ, but Grossman seems most influenced by McDowell and Willie McTell.  This is apparent in the inclusion of several tunes covered by McDowell and McTell and his use of alternating thumb-bass in several tunes, which is a a great skill to add to your slide playing.  Now, that doesn't mean all these tunes are from McDowell's and McTell's repertoire, but it does mean that even when it's not stated, their influence is apparent.  I really dig both of those artists, so this is cool with me.

- The footage of the old blues guys is really nice, however, in this youtube age, it's not terribly exciting.  All of the video footage (and more) can currently be found online for free these days.

- Grossman is always pleasant and engaging in all of his videos.

CONS:

- The tabs are wrong...quite often.  This debate has gone on several times on Grossman's own message board.  Mr. King appears to be the only person convinced of their complete accuracy.  Even Stefan has posted to say that some of the tabs do not match what he plays.  Yet Mr. King continues to personally insult anyone who disagrees with him...I'm not yet sure if he also believes Stefan can't read tablature since Mr. Grossman himself has admitted to some mistakes in the tabs.  The good news?  The tabs are ""mostly"" accurate, and even when they are off, the key elements to the song are usually correct.  Furthermore, these arrangements are played numerous times and are of an intermediate level, so you CAN figure them out, even if the tab is wrong.  I agree with Mr. King that Stefan does do a pretty good job of teaching the tunes (or at least the basic elements of the tunes) in fairly good detail.  Furthermore, it honestly might make you a better player to start figuring them out by ear, and if you can't quite get Stefan's version down, then you can certainly nail down your own version with a little practice.  My advice is to be prepared to use your ""replay"" button on your DVD player a lot, but to also be aware that with some patience and effort, you will be able to learn these songs.

- Frustrating camera work.  There is no split screen on these and often the camera misses LOTS of stuff, especially on the right hand.

- Grossman never mentions that you can also play by damping with your fretting hand to prevent extraneous overtones.  This is a basic skill that you can choose to use or not use.  Depending on the tune you're playing, the sound you are going for, and even the type of guitar you are playing, you may or may not want to dampen the strings.  However, if this is sold as a beginners DVD, and if Stefan is going to go into basics such as how to hold a slide, then this SHOULD at least be mentioned.

My advice?  Start with Brozman's beginner DVD.  He simply lays out the basics better.  I spent about eight months arduously going over that Brozman DVD, and even thought about just giving the whole thing up before a proverbial ""light"" went off and I somehow managed to put all the skills together enough to not sound half-bad.  (As an aside, the tabs for Broz's DVD aren't all that accurate either, but they are sufficient to learn the ideas he's putting down).  Because the first Broz DVD focuses mostly on technique, I wanted my next purchase to have more of a focus on repertoire, so I picked up the Grossman DVD, and I have been satisfied with it as a next-step in building some repertoire before I head back to Brozman-land for his Vol. 2.  I suppose I should clarify this review and say that Stefan does give plenty of good information on technique, licks, general advice on playing this stuff, etc... in this DVD, but in my opinion it works best as a repertoire builder for someone who already has some experience playing bottleneck blues.",1173052800,6,4368,4.471554993678888
8037416,5,B00062IZY0,"I don't know whether these other reviewers are so unfamiliar with video study they don't understand how to read tab for slide guitar or what their problems are, but Grossman's Bottleneck Blues Guitar is the best starting point I've found to learn this very entertaining style of blues guitar playing. I started studying this video three years ago. Since then I've also studied Bob Brozman's 3 DVD set, and Rory Block's The Guitar of Robert Johnson DVD. Both are terrific but would have been too advanced for me had I not had the foundation Stefan Grossman offers in this video. I don't know what the reveiwer means when he says he never shows you how to play the songs. He can't play them for you. He shows you how to hold the slide and how to maneuver it on the frets to get the right sound. This video also does not dumb down the material. He teaches good blues songs which once you master them you can take to open mics and play proudly. No 'Polly Wally Doodle,' here. The tab is completely accurate. I've used it for three years and go back to this every few months and I can tell you with absolute certainty that this tab is 100% correct. It is not hard to learn to read tab although tab for slide is a bit trickier than regular tab because slide doesn't have an exact stopping point. You have to use your ears. I can only guess that these other reviewers thought they were going to learn something without having to practice it. If you put the time into working with this video you will develop skill playing slide guitar very quickly. You have to put the time in every day. Neither this video nor any other can teach you anything if you don't go over the material and play it often. That said, I have done the research and there is no better starting point for Bottleneck Blues Guitar than Stefan Grossman's video.",1141084800,3,1821,4.406528189910979
8037417,2,B00062IZY0,"I agree with Shemp Newberg's review.  I have other Stefan Grossman DVDs, which I've raved about.  I got this one to begin learning bottleneck.  The tab is not what he's playing (or rather, he plays 80% plus embellishments), so you can't duplicate his songs unless you can play by ear.  Very disappointed.  Guess I'll seek another intro to bottleneck.  On a positive note, there are terrific historical clips of bottleneck legends, if you like that stuff (which I do).",1129420800,4,467,4.848101265822785
