3659553,1,B001JQTV90,"I was mildly excited to see this movie when I rented it.  As a vampire and overall horror movie fan, I believed this would be an enjoyable vampire horror fest type of B movie.  Boy was I in for a surprise.  The movie is about a vampire who falls for a human, then decides he wants to be cured of vampyrism so he can share his life with this woman. Well, this woman and the vampire have absolutely no chemistry, making me wonder why a vampire would want to give up immortality and sex with one of his sexier vampire friends to be with this much older looking girl.

As for the vampires, if you like a bunch of people with fangs on standing around growling like jaguars and not really doing anything, this movie is for you.  They can't fight, jump, or move.  They just stand there with their arms up like if they're trying to climb an imaginary wall.  Then there are the fight scenes, which are not very well choreographed, having people stand around waiting to get hit while the vampire performs a roundhouse kick that takes about 2 hours to connect.

The acting is horrible, and my first warning came early, when the heroine's dad is punched by her drunk fiancee.  He gets punched and falls down the steps without a hint of concern from his daughter and wife, who just stand there.  There's also the poor man's ""antonio banderas"" who you will recognize if you see this film.  Oh yeah, there's a little person who comes out dressed as an undertaker, I could keep going and going...

Just when I thought things could not possibly get worse, there was the ""space scene"".  I could not believe what I was watching... I told my wife about this scene and she was so bewildered that I had to show her. All of a sudden you see the planet Earth and the heads of various dead characters floating around in space all pissed off because they will be stuck there for eternity or something like that.

Anyway, if you feel like a good laugh and have 2 hours to spend, or if you're stoned and want to laugh hysterically, this movie is for you.  If you want to see a good movie, avoid at all costs.  Why anyone would greenlight an attrocious movie like this is beyond me.  The only good thing about it were some of the locations.",1240963200,18,2211,4.340632603406326
3659554,1,B001JQTV90,"This movie was horrendous.  I could not believe how horrible the acting was, how predictable the plot was and how down right dumb the movie was.  I say was..as I'm destroying my copy rather than try to sell it to someone else.  I wouldn't want to put someone else through the pain.  The vampires in it were idiotic..there was absolutely NO character development.  Someone in a different review mentioned how it should not be compared to Underworld because of the difference in budgets.  Well, the difference in budgets is not the problem. The writing, acting, directing and producing are the problem.  I don't care about the special effects..but come on...this was ridiculous.  Vampires that sound like lions and stand around roaring.  There was no chemistry between the love interests..oh how I could go on.  It just plain bit...excuse the pun.  I would rate it negative 5 stars if I could, as it actually took away from my intelligence rather than being enjoyable or showing me something new.

Don't buy.  But if you must see this...please please rent it.  You'll thank yourself in a couple hours..if you make it that far.",1233619200,6,1124,4.847368421052631
3659555,4,B001JQTV90,"The opera scene with the opera singer was a wonderful opening for this film.  I am not a big vampire fan, but I thought parts of the movie were well done and entertaining.  I enjoyed some of the costumes and locations used for scenes.",1233273600,3,234,4.295454545454546
3659556,3,B001JQTV90,This was fun!  Vampire movies are pretty predictable - but this is creepy and scary just the same.  The opera singer is fabulous.,1233273600,2,129,4.565217391304348
3659557,5,B001JQTV90,I really enjoyed this bloody movie!!  It was riviting and suspenseful and a thriller.  The opening scene is so intense  and just keeps getting better.,1233273600,2,150,4.92
3659558,4,B001JQTV90,"This is a vampire movie with the interesting twist of the illuminati pulling the strings. Daniel Goddard is excellent (and hot). It might be vampire-light for some vampire fans, but it is all the more watchable for less hard core fans of the genre.",1232755200,,248,4.659090909090909
3659559,1,B001JQTV90,"There's nothing new here. A vampire craves to return to humanity so he can be with a new-found love, and view the sunrise.

The vampires are pathetic. They stand around the vampire hunters for a few moments hissing, bearing their fangs, theatening you with their hands as if they're going to claw you, but they don't have claws. All with enough time so a hunter can take aim with his weapon and take one of them out.

Even charging at one with a long pointed stick is enough. You don't even need to get the vampire in the heart.",1232236800,,528,4.3232323232323235
3659560,1,B001JQTV90,"Seriously....everyone featured in the film, their careers are basically over.  The acting was so bad it was comical.  The only one that did a halfway reasonable job was the one midget who has been in a whole bunch of similar films (example, Bordello of Blood).  This is the type of movie that would be made fun of on Mystery Science Theatre 3000.",1232236800,2,346,4.548387096774194
3659561,1,B001JQTV90,"Atrocious.  This is one of the few films I'd bother reviewing, if only to help someone else avoid it.  Just don't bother.",1231718400,,121,4.454545454545454
3659562,5,B001JQTV90,"Seeing this movie and it's elements provides insight to a smooth transition and it was very good. A horror movie that has an interesting plot and some good visuals. The actual cinematography of the film is well done. It uses excellent shot transitions like wipes, disolves and fades in the right abundance without overdoing it. It also presents emotional and intellectual responses by using the correct tempo and shot length. The implied world of the story, or diegesis, and the non-diegetic aspects out side of the diegisis are excellent to give it cohesiveness.  The syuzhut is well organized into the fabula and stands behind the events depicted. This is not Underworld made for 60 million dollars and I don't have time to give a course in filmmaking but take it from me, teaching film for 20 years and working with some of the most prestigious actors in film, this film has cinematic integrity in many areas. A nice piece of work.",1227484800,4,934,4.801242236024844
8313593,2,B001JQTV90,"""I would like to be your knight in shining armor,"" the vampire says, ""but I don't want to take advantage of your situation because of your emotional vulnerability."" Yes, this is a Twilight for non-tweens (its release was around the start of that Kristen Stewart saga), but without, well, without most of the things you either loved or hated about Twilight. For me, the absence of werewolves was the saving grace for this B-movie.

After you watch your first 100 or so vampire films, you start to see a pattern. Namely, this genre has more than its fair share of stinkers... you almost have to grade on a curve when comparing to other genres. I can empathize with reviewers who consider 1 star too generous for this movie, but I can also empathize with a $525,000 budget in tandem with an overly-ambitious plot.

Really the title is ""Immortally Yours,"" since ""Kiss of the Vampire"" is actually a Hammer film from decades ago. Immortally Yours was shot in Ohio, and about the best thing you can say about that is folks in the Buckeye State welcomed the movie with open arms, granting access to places like the Dayton Masonic Center. It's apparently a cheap state to shoot in, as described in the following New York Times piece, which discusses ""Immortally Yours"":
http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/20/us/20vampire.html

The Kiwi-born actress ""Kat Hawks"" (not quite her birth name) both wrote the script and portrayed one of the central characters in Immortally Yours, and the results leave you with the impression that she's an individual who marches to the beat of her own drum. The reason Immortally Yours doesn't deserve less than 2 stars is because it does things I have never seen done in a vamp film, and I value deviation above most other qualities. She did go a little overboard tho: teleportation, astrophysics, and a dwarf thrown in for good measure (not a friend of Bilbo, I'm just talking about an actor with dwarfism).

To sum up the shortcomings of this sub-million dollar production, I'll be lazy and quote something exactly true from the Film Critics United website:
""Scenes went on way too long, actors seemed to be standing around waiting for their cues, the camera lingered far too long on actors doing absolutely nothing and as many plot points that were in the movie, there were more that were introduced that went absolutely nowhere.""",1429228800,,2350,4.882205513784461
8313594,4,B001JQTV90,I RECEIVED THE ITEM IN VERY GOOD CONDITION AND PLAYS VERY WELL.,1415059200,,63,4.333333333333333
8313595,1,B001JQTV90,"Absolutely awful.  The acting is terrible, like someone filmed the first-time rehearsal of a high school play.  Apparently the director was on vacation during the filming, as everyone seems to be making it up as they go along.  The special effects are bad, the filming is bad, there's really nothing good to be said about this movie.  Avoid, avoid, avoid!",1407196800,,355,4.866666666666666
8313596,1,B001JQTV90,Shot in my hometown but this movie is kind of poorly constructed.  Gary Daniels does a good job though.,1405123200,,103,4.421052631578948
8313597,5,B001JQTV90,"Fantastic blood & gore ,Twilight,The Vampire Diaries, & The Originals can all ""Suck it"".The Actors are handsomes & The Actresses are very Hot & Sexy. The Action Scenes were ""Off the Hook"".",1396396800,,188,4.90625
8313598,2,B001JQTV90,"Kiss of the Vampire looked tempting, and it opened with hope. It seemed they spent well on locations, camera equipment, and actors. If only they'd have also spent for a decent script, and maybe some editing. Not the worst vampire flick I've seen, but within kissing distance of the worst.",1357344000,,288,4.78
8313599,1,B001JQTV90,"It was awful. I expected it to be. The only reason I paid money for it is because I was born and raised in the town it was filmed in. (Hamilton, Ohio)",1296172800,,150,3.71875
8313600,1,B001JQTV90,"The plot really didn't make all that much sense to me.  I watched half of it and really didn't get it.  Really cheesy too.  Don't really think there was nudity in it, but I only watched half of it.",1276473600,,197,4.0
8313601,1,B001JQTV90,"If you like bad movies, this ones for you. I bought this movie for the simple fact that it was filmed in my hometown. It was cool seeing places that I know but this has to be one of the worst vampire movies I've seen. The special effects aren't good, and the acting isn't either. They even used one of the cities politicians in a role. Don't waste your money.",1255737600,,359,4.142857142857143
8313602,1,B001JQTV90,"Please don't waste your time, the first 5 minutes are the only good part in the movie, the rest is like the 1st black and white dracula.... boring",1244246400,,146,4.25
