8675875,4,B00N2ZBVXK,"I know it will sound hyperbolic, but I consider Michel Legrand's music some of the most gorgeous ever composed, particularly the scores for ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" and ""The Young Girls of Rochefort,"" the ultra-charming films of Jacques Demy. Appropriately, both are represented in this June 2014 concert with Legrand at the piano, and in fact, there are quite a few selections from ""Rochefort.""

The music-making is thoroughly enjoyable. As usual, Legrand's melodies are absolutely beautiful. I never tire of them, whether they're played straight or jazzed up. And the bass, guitar and drum combo playing with Legrand does them full justice.

The vocalist, Natalie Dessay, is perhaps more of an acquired taste. A former world-renowned coloratura soprano -- she retired from opera in 2013 -- she has since shifted to pop and its more forgiving lower keys. Her voice is still settling into its new groove, and some might find it a bit thin. Personally, I greatly enjoyed her sincere interpretations (she was considered a particularly good singing actress on the opera stage), but a friend who viewed this with me found her unpleasant on the ears.

Now let me rhapsodize about the picture quality, something I rarely do. It's exceptional. The colors are stunning throughout the concert. Just look at those changing hues as the sun sets and the Versailles lights are switched on. The level of detail in the image is also breathtaking. The Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound is excellent. In total, technically this is a nearly perfect disc, despite editing that is too frantic.

The biggest drawback is that, although the disc is being marketed to the U.S., no subtitles are included, in English or any other language. For those of us who, unfortunately, aren't (yet) fluent in French, Legrand's patter between numbers and the song lyrics will go right past. But music is an international language, and Legrand's melodies communicate like no other.

I think anyone who responds to Legrand's music should have this Blu-ray in their collection, along with the DVD of a Brussels concert from nine years earlier:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michel-Legrand-Live-in-Brussels-Celebrated-Film-Scores-Jazz-Tunes-and-Chansons/dp/B000I2IUMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michel Legrand: Live in Brussels Celebrated Film Scores, Jazz Tunes and Chansons</a>. There are other Legrand DVDs available, but to my knowledge these are the only two with surround sound, which I consider crucial for full enjoyment.",1423440000,,2537,5.579220779220779
8675876,3,B00N2ZBVXK,"Just a note for those unfamiliar with this Blu-Ray release: The front and back of the box is in English, the table of contents on the Blu-Ray menu is in English, the disk is 100 percent playable in America and other English-speaking countries, but more or less the entire concert (with the exception of two or three songs, ten minutes in all, out of more than an hour and a half of introductions, comments by the performers, and songs being sung by the performers) is in French, with no subtltles provided. (And no real help from the booklet, which is minimalist and more or less only consists of a listing of the French titles of the French material being presented in French.) Weird and unexpected. Weird that Erato (the releaser) would not have added Engish subtitles or supertitles as a courtesy for English-speaking viewers (or titles in other languages for viewers from other countries); but the fact is that they didn't. And unexpected in this day and age of international releases. My French is passable, though just barely, so this didn't affect me personally so much, but I think my mother or my father or many friends and other people I know, including my Boston University students, would be very disappointed if they purchased this, thinking they could follow along in English (or German or Italian or Spanish) and know what was being said and sung.",1416960000,4,1362,4.77542372881356
