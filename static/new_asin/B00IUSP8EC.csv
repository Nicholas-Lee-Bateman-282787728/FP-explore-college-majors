8645564,5,B00IUSP8EC,"Mary Pickford's silent 1917 Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm really had us laughing. It was a different story-line from the Shirley Temple's Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, but it was still a well told story. They had humorous poetry instead of the music that filled Shirley Temple's version. There were some shocking parts, but I guess not for a 1917 dated movie. This movie was an enjoyable one.",1469750400,3,387,4.878787878787879
