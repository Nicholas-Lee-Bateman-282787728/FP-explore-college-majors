8567843,5,B0001WDE50,"Runnin At Midnite is a must see for all parents and their teen children. This film is based on street reality.  It is about boys who have lost hope and turn to a midnight basketball league to have a safe place to be when darkness falls.
Written, co-produced and directed by Pablo Toledo, it exposes the raw truth about our youth that most of us know little about. This independent film won national and international awards, an amazing film!",1257638400,,441,4.582278481012659
