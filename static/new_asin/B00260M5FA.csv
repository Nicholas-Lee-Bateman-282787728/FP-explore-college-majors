3850321,5,B00260M5FA,"The second season of the Discovery Channel's ""Storm Chasers"" covers the 2008 storm chasing season.  Meteorologist Josh Wurman in the Doppler on Wheels (DOW), IMAX filmmaker Sean Casey in the Tornado Intercept Vehicle (TIV), PhD candidate Reed Timmer, and a scout team of chasers go all over Tornado Alley in search of twisters.

The series shows the way the TIV is put together, and the DOW and TIV are both improved for 2008.  However, the teams are sometimes plagued by mechanical failures, by conflicts on where to go to find the most powerful storms, and of course by the life-threatening danger inherent in storm chasing.  The teams do have some successful moments, however, in their efforts to capture data and pictures that will help meteorologists better understand these killer storms.",1263513600,,794,5.084615384615384
3850322,4,B00260M5FA,"The delivery was timely and in good condition, as I have come to expect with any Amazon supplier.
I had trouble finding this product and was looking for it to give as a gift.  It was a relief to finally find it on Amazon.  However, after it was ordered I found that the same product was available for about half the price from a different source, and that season 1 and 2 could be purchased for what I paid for just season 2.
I wrote this off to experience and my neglect in not shopping a bit more before purchasing.",1254355200,2,516,4.15

3850355,4,B00260M5FA,"While I like this series, it focuses more on the Chasers and their troubles both with the equipment and each other as they seek out tornadoes on the Great Plains. This season showcases Sean Casey, Reed Timmer and Josh Wurman and their teams. Wurman and Casey are at odds over the agreement that they must stick together on the chase. However, Casey is anxious to chase against Wurman's cautions and temporarily tries to hook up with Timmer's team. Egos clash as Wurman feels others are not in the Chase for the science while Sean thinks Josh is too cautious by half. In the meantime, equipment is breaking down and that helps to put everyone on edge. Yes, we see the storms and they are quite spectacular, but they are mirrored on the ground when the chasers get together...",1403308800,,774,4.615942028985507

3850379,5,B00260M5FA,"I was so excited when Discovery launched this show in 2007. It was so relieving that someone had finally made a proper TV Series about storms and tornadoes. Season 1 was good but only had 4 episodes. Great stuff but way too short. Series 2 has 8 episodes while both Sean Casey and Josh Wurman have new state of the art vehicles for the 2008 season. And while this season continues to follow Sean and Josh, it also picks up stormchaser Reed Timmer and his TornadoVideos.net team. The addition of Reed is fantastic because ever since he's been on the show, he and his team have provided for some of the most exciting episodes and have gotten some of the best footage of tornadoes. This is one of the few TV Series where I can say I enjoyed every single episode on the DVD set. Seasons 3 and 4 of Stormchasers are very good but quite expensive and season 1, while affordable, only has 4 episodes. Season 2 has 8 episodes and is very reasonably priced so for fans of the show this is a good DVD set to start with.",1313884800,,1009,4.287958115183246
3850380,5,B00260M5FA,"I have always been fascinated by tornadoes and have seen every documentary I could find.  But Storm Chasers goes far beyond the average tornado documentary.  The footage is amazing, and the presentation is anything but dry. The series follows different groups of storm chasers throughout the season, showing not only severe weather, but their struggles, victories and the rivalries between them.  Definitely popcorn worthy entertainment.  Season two is probably my favorite of the four so far.",1302307200,3,493,5.447368421052632
3850381,5,B00260M5FA,"My 12 year old daughter thinks Storm Chasers ROCKS!! She has watched each episode multiple times and can now give me a play by play of each episode and each storm as it is coming up.  Great video of Midwest storms!  Cast is great too and make the video entertaining.  If you love tornadoes, you will love this series.  Episode 8 has the biggest tornado they filmed.",1301529600,5,365,4.402985074626866
