The next morning they called the PeaceJam Foundation to see how they could start a PeaceJam Club at their school.",1078099200,2,273,4.808510638297872
5722013,5,B0001BP922,"PeaceJam, the DVD, portrays the vivid words and insights of Nobel Laureates as seen through the eyes of five youth.  I recommend incorporating the PeaceJam book and DVD into high school and college curricula and extracurricular programs as a means of embedding academics in the real world, engaging students in service, and creating a generation of young people who have the skills to realize world peace on a global and local level. The DVD has scenes not available on the VHS version.

5722014,5,B0001BP922,"I found this movie deeply moving and inspiring. I had that ""head of the sand"" experience.  Our youth are struggling and what a brilliant idea to connect them with the worlds' greatest role models -- Nobel Peace Laureates.  The five youth in this movie are worth getting to know.",1078099200,2,278,4.653061224489796
5722015,5,B0001BP922,"The stories told by survivors of the Columbine shootings made me cry, (yes, yes, I admit it) and so did the stories of how other youth broke the cycle of violence in their own communities. I also learned ways in which I can help the at-risk youth I serve to ""identify themselves as people who can produce greatness in the world.""
Adults that are helping young people to overcome conflicts of ethnicity, gender, racism, drug abouse, violence and academic failure, should definatly watch this movie. I think you will be both moved and inspired.
I had not heard of PeaceJam before seeing this video, but I'll definatly tell my fellow teachers about it now. Everyone should see this movie and become inspired to create peace in their community.",1078099200,,740,4.7890625
5722016,5,B0001BP922,"I had the opportunity to watch the PeaceJam film at the Newport Beach Film Festival, and I really loved it.  The most interesting part of the movie was the inside look at Columbine High School on the day of the shootings, and the great way the young people who were there talked about it.  It gave me a lot more insight into what happened that day.  And overall, the movie was really inspirational.",1078099200,,398,4.424657534246576
5722017,5,B0001BP922,"Everyone who works with kids should see this video, appropriate for families, church groups, youth groups, social workers, high school students and more... This movie will make you cry, laugh, and think.
All that view it will see, through the lives of five youth how greatness in the world is possible--no matter your race, gender, ethnicity, or economic background. The five youth featured overcame violence, poverty, homelessness and more as the result of their participation in PeaceJam.
The movie shows how everyone can be involved in this program that teaches youth through a literacy based program to be leaders for social change and peace.
High school kids will like the music, the fast pace created by the editing, and the stories shared by the youth in the movie. Buy it for yourself, buy it for a friend, by it for your school, and I believe, the impact of this movie will be far reaching and long lasting.
Two thumbs up!",1074556800,,931,4.825
8581631,5,B0001BP922,PeaceJam follows the lives of five teenagers growing up in growing up in Colorado and how violence and discrimination effected their lives.  The amazing stories that are shared provide an intimate look at the youth of America.,1080518400,,226,5.108108108108108
8581632,5,B0001BP922,"On the cover, there's a quote from Michael Moore (Bowling for Columbine) that says this is a film every American should see.  After seeing it, I think he is entirely correct.  American youth live a culture where things like conflict resolution, gender identity issues, gang violence and drug/alcohol abuse are rarely addressed.  Instances such as the Columbine High School tragedy scream the desperate need for America to broach these topics with its youth.  PeaceJam is tackling this task head on by bringing American kids face-to-face with such distinguished world leaders as The Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.",1079481600,,621,5.3061224489795915
8581633,5,B0001BP922,"This has everything stated above and more! If you're looking for information on conflict resolution, anger management, gender identity issues, gang-related violence, drug addiction, alcohol abuse, or just the hardships of being a teenager in this new millenium, then this is for you. These kids have had unbelievable experiences ranging from horrific to enlightening, like meeting the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Like Michael Moore's Bowling For Columbine, this includes the shooting survivor Richard Castaldo, who shares even more of his story through PeaceJam.
I hope you too can purchase this and really enjoy the effect that it has on your life.",1079308800,,661,5.427184466019417

A must SEE for all generations young and old. The film restores faith in the human race,todays peacejammers are perhapsthe next world leaders! God bless you peacejammers!",1079308800,,311,5.36734693877551
8581636,5,B0001BP922,"An inspiring, moving, eye opening look into what 2 people can do when their minds are set and determined to create an organization that could change the world.  PeaceJam is so obviously a life altering experience for everyone involved.  An honest, raw glimpse into various youths lives, you will at once see the positive impact this brilliant organization has.  Your hearts will break then soar watching the progress that these kids make through the discovery of PeaceJam and what had led them there in their very rough life journey.  Such a rare opportunity for youth to interact with various Nobel Peace Laureates and the effect it has on them is just amazing.  I highly recommend sharing this film with people of all ages.  The simple way the film was documented only adds to the reality of the stories these kids have to tell.  The thought running through my head most as viewing this film was, imagine if all youth around the world were able to have the PeaceJam experience and have people tell them they can do ""it"" how different our society would be today.  A must view film!!!",1078963200,6,1084,4.698412698412699
8581637,5,B0001BP922,"I first saw the PEACEJAM documentary at the Taos Talking Pictures Festival last April. I was amazed at all the five teenage subjects went through - I started high school in 1971, and PeaceJam clearly lets us know that times have indeed changed - for the worse. Three of five in PEACEJAM were at Columbine High School on April 20, 1999, and their memories of that horrible day weren't adequately covered in Michael Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine,"" as good as that film was. PEACEJAM digs deeper into the psyches of Richard, Shannon and Shelby, and it was alomost surreal watching the footage of Richard Castaldo meeting His Holiness the Dalai Lama for the very first time.
I had no idea that a youth education program like PeaceJam not only exists, but is in its 8th year. Apparently the program deals with conflict resolution, religious tolerance, sexual identity issues, ethnicity, racism, anti-nuclear proliferation, gang-related violence, feminist issues, democracy building, indigenous issues, drug abuse, sectarian violence, alcohol abuse, violence in the home, and service learning. That the inventors of PeaceJam have managed to round up 12 Nobel Peace Prize winners like Rigoberta Menchu, Jody Williams and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, Jose Ramos-Horta, Sir Joseph Rotblat, Betty Williams, Mairead Corrigan Maguire, Aung San Suu Kyi, Adolfo Perez Esquivel, Dr. Oscar Arias, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu for youth to study speaks loudly and clearly for the objectives of PeaceJam and its documentary and companion book.
PEACEJAM clearly illustrates the need for compassion in world desecrated by violence toward gay and transgender folks, violence against indigenous peoples, violence toward women, and... so much more. I recommend PEACEJAM to every school teacher, youth counselor, teenager, parent and government official alike. I see that Michael Moore said, ""This film should be seen by every American citizen."" I couldn't agree more!",1078963200,7,1960,5.4295081967213115
8581638,4,B0001BP922,I'd heard about this organization and assumed the DVD would be like watching a big lecture. Not so. Watching it with my two daughters we were all amazed how moving and entertaining it was. Hardly a hard sell it really gets to you when you hear the kids tell their stories. And just when  you get nice and relaxed they spring Columbine on you in an up close and personal way like I've never seen before. My kids and I were wiped out and inspired by film's end. SEE THIS NOW.,1078790400,2,473,4.197802197802198
8581639,5,B0001BP922,"I loved this film.  It was very refreshing to see something so real, honest, and inspirational.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has ever fealt (or is currently feeling) that there is no hope in this world.  You will change your mind by the end of this documentary!",1078272000,2,277,4.5
