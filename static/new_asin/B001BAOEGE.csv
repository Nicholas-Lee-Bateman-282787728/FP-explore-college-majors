8619561,5,B001BAOEGE,"I have to say out of all the prior kranked videos this is the best.  Outstanding video footage of extreme mountain, techical and street biking.  The switch to high def recording was a good move concidering all prior videos were 480I.  I also have to add that every song has excellent taste and quite a wide selection of genre that goes perfectly with all scenes: punk, rock, 4X4, breaks and tri-hop.  This DVD is perfect for the biker enthusiest and video watching gu-ru.",1230163200,,471,4.63855421686747
