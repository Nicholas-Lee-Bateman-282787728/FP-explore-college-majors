1389108,5,B0000524ES,"""Selma, Lord, Selma"" fills an important niche by telling a story of the Civil Rights Movement in a manner that is accessible to upper elementary students (and older). The characters and situations are believable, and the story is told from the perspecive of a young--almost 12 years old--African-American girl who got involved after writing a report on Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.
While this film portrays the harshness of the situation, including two deaths, it is not graphic or gratutitous. I personally appreciated the way the non-violent Civil Rights movement of Rev. King and his followers was based on their Christian beliefs. The film is not preachy, but the religious context of the movement is realistically portrayed.
As the school librarian, I will be recommending this video to teachers in our elementary school as an option for the Martin Luther King holiday.",1018224000,74,874,5.161971830985915
1389109,5,B0000524ES,"I had watched this movie in school during my history class, we were studying the civil rights movement. And I think that this movie did a great job showing and describing the event. I think that this movie is very inspirational, and it would make you will grateful for what you have.  This movie is from the view of an African American little school girl who wanted to take part in the civil rights marches in her community. She was a very brave girl who was very determined to reach the goal of freedom. Other characters in the movie were also very great and very good with their role like  the young Reverend in the movie named Jonathon.",990057600,25,639,4.406779661016949
1389110,5,B0000524ES,"I watch many of the Disney Channels original movies but this was one of their best. I found myself tapping my foot to the beat of the rythem of the song ""Turn Me Round"". The movie is about Selma, Alabama in 1965. Martin Luther King is leading the different marches and the police are beating and killing people. You find yourself a bit teary-eyed at the end of this movie.",986947200,8,372,4.328571428571428
1389111,4,B0000524ES,"I first had the privlage of watching Selma, Lord, Selma in Febuary 2000 in my 6th grade social studies/language/history class with Mrs. Shelle Franklin as my teacher. I just want to say it is a very emotional movie even though I was a 12 year old boy in a room full of my peers I was still a bit teary-eyed. Here's how bad I was... I memorized the words to ""Turn Me 'Round"" a foot-tapping freedom song sang by Shyanne in the film. Also for those who have seen the movie and did not know the young white preacher Johnathan is played by Mckenzie Astin who played Andy on the 1984-1988 seasons of The Facts Of Life. And the shool teacher is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's real life daughter.  Well, hope you watch and enjoy the movie. It truly is a Disney Masterpiece.",981849600,11,762,4.291666666666667

Even though Rachel did not march on that courageous second attempt to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge, I am sure she walked with her friend in spirit. Racism's ugly face was well reprsented, especially with young Jonathan's murder. But nothing was to stop Dr. King's army from defying its opposition to crossing the bridge and marching all the way from Selma to Montgomery. I was especially moved at the end when Sheyann's father presented her with a pair of walking shoes for himself, showing he would be walking beside her on the next freedom march. This movie shows the beginnings of the Civil Rights Movement and 2009's Presidential election shows us its progress. Another Disney movie to show more on this is Disney's Ruby Bridges, a girl even younger than Sheyann. These two girls would show the world courage does not just belong to grownups.",1242345600,2,973,4.695906432748538

1389436,5,B0000524ES,Selma Lord Selma is a great video especially since we have just elected a new president. Everyone should watch this just to see how far we in america have come and what it took to get where we are today. Thanks,1226966400,2,210,4.146341463414634
1389437,5,B0000524ES,"I had this movie a long time ago, and I played it until the tape snapped one day.  Jurnee Smollett as the lead character, Sheyann Webb, is an amazing actress whose maturity beyond her years is noteworthy.  She has incredible range, better than even some of the adult actors and actresses we see today.  You really believe that she wants justice and equality when she marches with Dr. King and those in her community.  I must warn any who haven't seen it, however, it is heart-wrenching as you see the faces of inequality and oppression and violence who make every attempt to thwart justice and have everything remain the way it is.  Ultimately, it is a story of triumph, hope, belief, and faith.",1212451200,5,695,4.617886178861789

I have found that it is a wonderful way to allow the children to see, first hand, what the movement was all about.  The movie allows students to get a real sense of the fear people had to overcome in order to make a change in our society.  This movie is a great supplemental teaching tool!",1205798400,10,382,4.205479452054795
1389439,4,B0000524ES,"This film is a remarkable re-creation of troubled times in Selma, Alabama. Filmed on location in and around Brown Chapel, I believe that some of the interiors were actually shot in the West and Webb apartments near the Chapel. The energy, sincerity and also the violence of this troubled period is well represented. The acting of Jurnee Smollet as the young girl who becomes involved in the movement and Mackenzie Astin as the martyred seminary student Jonathan Daniels is tremendously appealing. The smaller roles are perfectly cast.
The few weaknesses stem from the usual abrupt cuts and fade outs associated with television movie-making.",1201737600,3,640,5.223300970873787

1389442,5,B0000524ES,"""Selma, Lord, Selma"" is generally accurate.  However, in the movie, Jonathan Daniels, the white priest from New Hampshire, shows up in Selma much earlier than he did in reality, and the story of this black movement is told through a white character.  In reality, Daniels came to Selma after ""Bloody Sunday.""  Great movie, but stuck in the conventions of 1999 where there had to be a main white character, in my opinion.
Disney makes the two main role girls several years older than they were in reality -- maybe because the audience wouldn't like a girl barely 9 years old repeatedly cutting school to attend meetings and marches, maybe to fit the ages of the actors?
There is some natural telescoping and consolidation of the complicated events to fit them into a 90-minute movie, e.g. two marches instead of the real three.
The movie shows a flashback of Jimmie Lee Jackson's 1965 death as if it occurred in daytime, with Jonathan Daniels present.  Daniels wasn't at Jackson's death, in reality.  Then the movie shows a newspaper clipping accurately reporting that Jackson died at night.  The deputy sheriff who shot Jackson pled guilty to manslaughter in 2010 and served six months in jail.
Yes, there does have to be a sort of omnipresent narrator, but the role of ominpresent narrator would have been served by the two girls, Sheyann Webb and Rachel West, who wrote the book ""Selma, Lord, Selma.""
The movie changes the name of some characters.  The real-life Sheriff Clark is ""Sheriff Potts"" in the movie.  The real-life Amelia Boynton is ""Mrs. Blythe"" in the movie.
The role of the girls' teacher, ""Miss Bright"" in the movie, is played by the real-life daughter of Dr. King, Yolanda King.
Strangely, the death of Jonathan Daniels is changed in the movie.  The movie shows a KKK member walking up to Daniels, after Daniels was released from jail, and shooting Daniels on the street with a pistol.
In reality, Daniels had just been released from jail when a man with a shotgun confronted them and pointed the shotgun at a teenager.  Daniels pushed the teenager down, saving her life, and Daniels was shot and killed with the shotgun.
It is a very moving and worthwhile movie.",1052179200,27,2179,4.802139037433155
