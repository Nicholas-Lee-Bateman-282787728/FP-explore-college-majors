1845731,3,B00008G85H,"This is the Platinum release which was released in 2002, and was the first run of this movie on DVD.  I have both the Platinum & the Brentwood versions of this DVD, and have noticed some differences in the two.  First off, the Platinum  release is packaged nicely.  It comes in a clear jewel case, and the artwork is a little nicer than the Brentwood version.  The Brentwood version is just in a regular keepcase.  As far as picture quality goes, the Platinum version has a clear, more defined picture.  Both the Platinum and the Brentwood versions have utilized the same master film, but the Platinum version is more defined and crisp.  The picture on the Brentwood version is darker, and grainier looking.  For the sound, there is no difference in the 2 versions.  It's OK at the beginning, but by the 30 minute mark, the sound starts sounding muffled, and not very clear.  Towards the end of the movie, there is a popping sound that occurs a few times.  This is not a movie where you would crank the volume, or even listen to the soundtrack through a stereo system.  The popping is quite loud, and may damage your speakers if the volume is turned high.  Like many made-for-TV movies, the colour and film quality are not that great, but out of the 2 versions, the Platinum version is the one to get if you are a big fan of this movie.",1092009600,14,1336,4.444444444444445

7983542,4,B00008G85H,Great movie. It teaches and warns all kids out there that the streets are rough. And there's help available. It's also a lesson for parents as well. Parents and their children should watch it together.,1382918400,,201,4.771428571428571
7983543,2,B00008G85H,"DVD quick arrival appreciated.  When viewing the DVD, I was surprised at the poor quality.  There was ""snow"" or black dots/spots in the scenes and even a ""slash"" in one of the frames.  It looked like something I could have copied from theTV myself - not expected from so called professionals.",1357603200,,292,4.686274509803922
7983544,3,B00008G85H,I should have just kept my old VHS copy.  The quality is just like that-taped from TV.  I wasted some money.  Live & learn.,1276646400,,123,4.041666666666667
7983545,3,B00008G85H,"David Soul&Louis Gossett Jr play in a Buddy,Buddy film that sets to clean up the streets. Clifton Davis plays a Pimp in this film.  I use to watch this film back in the day on tv. I haven't seen this film in ages,but I remember it just like yesterday. this was a cool film for the time period. Linda Purl did pretty good as well in this film.",1170806400,,342,4.029411764705882
7983546,5,B00008G85H,"David Soul was terrific in this movie, not a surprise though - he's a wonderful actor. Also, a young Linda Purl was great as the teen runaway. It is a sobering account of a teen runaway who turns to prostitution. It's also a good film for parents to watch with teens. Back in the 70's it was a made for tv movie, which doesn't lessen the impact of the movie.",1130112000,8,358,4.128571428571429
