5295687,5,B009A68ESA,Great to see the BBC relasing these old favorites. The quality is excellent and the value is good. Keep it up.,1351555200,,110,4.285714285714286
5295688,5,B009A68ESA,"Here's some more of what you want to know, at least this is what I always look for, the EPISODES contained.  Don't know why Amazon consistently either does not list them or if they do they get it wrong. The good news here is that in addition to the regular '93 season episodes they do include the Dec. '93 Special, ""Welcome To Earth"".  This one, like all other LOSW specials are never played on PBS, so being able to see the specials on these U.S. LOSW releases is a major plus!  I have to tell you, that this episode is extremely funny, an excellent example to show anyone who is not familiar with the series what it's all about.  All the best characters are here all doing what you hope and expect they will do.  This episode does not disappoint.  So, with that tidbit out of the way, here are the episodes in this release, enjoy Summer Winers:

Welcome to Earth
The trio join Darren's friend in expecting a visitation from outer space (or maybe even Huddersfield)

How To Clear Your Pipes
Now Foggy's on about Compo and Clegg being out of shape again, and he ends up putting them through an exhaustive training course that leaves them trapped inside sewer pipes. Howard's latest subterfuge has him publicizing the bicycle race he and Marina are ""participating"" in, but he does it a little too well this time.

Where There's Smoke, There's Barbecue
The trio gets a gas grill from Auntie Wainwright, but its alarming potency brings an explosive touch to their barbecue. Howard is busy making improvements on his love-nest. Will it inflame Marina's passions, or just inflame Marina? And how did Howard end up with a wooden leg?

The Black Widow
Too much home brew at a funeral tea leaves Compo and Foggy having to rescue Clegg from the arms of an amorous widow.

Have You Got A Light Mate?
Smiler is selling security lights. Howard is determined to buy Marina a china shepherdess-if he can persuade Clegg to visit Auntie Wainwright's.

Stop That Bath
The trio finds they are involved in yet another of Howard's schemes to get a present to Marina-this time a cast iron bath!

Springing Smiler
Smiler is sick of living in misery with Nora Batty and will hand over 50 quid to anyone who will help him move out and live in misery someplace else. Foggy has a plan to get Smiler thrown out, but will Compo murder Smiler before they can put it into action?

Concerto For Solo Bicycle
Foggy comes up with the crazy idea of bicycle safety underwear after he collides with Compo riding his old bike.

There Are Gypsies At The Bottom Of Our Garden
Dewhirst's ""Nature Tours"" are launched by Foggy after he believes he's discovered the nesting place of a giant woodpecker.

Aladdin Gets On Your Wick
After seeing a man on a sailboard, Foggy has the idea of inventing a three-man version.",1350518400,33,2774,4.573737373737374
5295689,4,B009A68ESA,"The character and story line are great.  Fans of ""Last of the Summer Wine"" won't be disappointed.  In my opinion, the only negative thing is the sound track.  The sound varies- up and down, sometimes hollow sounding, reverberatres/echoes- and the laugh track is very loud to the point of sometimes drowning out the narrative and being annoying in it loudness.  Maybe I received a faulty recording.  I suppose the only way to find out is to buy another copy, or if someone has the same experience and notes it with a review.",1350172800,9,523,4.641304347826087
5295690,5,B009A68ESA,You would love this series even if you don't like British Comedies.  Roy Clarke does a wonderful job with these characters and gives you the feeling they are a demented part of your family.,1441670400,,189,4.5588235294117645

5295692,5,B009A68ESA,"My wife and I love to watch LOSW at 10;30 pm over our local PBS station so I knew what I was ordering. It certainly ends our day on a pleasant note. Although new to me, these episodes were more of the clean silly humor that British television gives for the most part. This longest running series by the the BBC is hardly ever disappointing.",1436572800,,340,4.246153846153846

5295707,5,B009A68ESA,"I always look forward to watching Last of the Summer Wine on PBS every weekend.  Would like to have the complete set, but, it only comes in Region 2.",1388102400,,149,4.137931034482759
5295708,5,B009A68ESA,"This is a gift for me, which I will not be permitted to open until January. I have many more of this series, and hope to get even more, as it is superior entertainment and fun.",1387584000,,176,3.9166666666666665
5295709,5,B009A68ESA,Great series to collect.  The Last of the Summer Wine is an excellent comedy the only way the Brits can do it.  Lasted so long.  No wonder.  Especially the Compo years.,1384214400,,168,4.32258064516129
5295710,5,B009A68ESA,Very watchable sitcom. We watch these episodes over and over. The entire series from beginning to end is very pleasant. Many of the actors have since passed so no reunion is possible. Wish they were still making more episodes with the new and remaining group. Just fun to watch.,1381536000,,278,4.6938775510204085
5295711,5,B009A68ESA,"Great series, BBC knows how to make a good comedy,remember when they were first shown on TV.back in the sixties.",1376092800,,112,4.65
5295712,5,B009A68ESA,My hubby and I have every dvd of this show that has come out so far.  We watch it on television every day and can't wait for the new ones to arrive so we can watch them all one after the other.  Our favorite character is Compo and Nora Batty but we love all the characters.  They are so much fun to watch.,1373846400,,305,3.8095238095238093
5295713,5,B009A68ESA,"If the vintage 1993 LOSW had no other episodes, the special Welcome to Earth makes this DVD set well worth five stars...and its price. With John Cleese in a cameo appearance, and a scene of our three protagonists on a bicycle flying through the air, with the moon shining in the background (an unselfconscious director's nod to Spielberg's ET), this splendid episode is pure pleasure and has become a must-see over and again for us.

The remainder of the episodes are rather stock LOSW, though The Black Widow has charms, reminiscent  of earlier, more innocent episodes,  and There Are Gypsies At The Bottom Of Our Garden has laugh-out-loud funny moments!

The sound track on this set leaves a little to be desired, voices sometimes fading in and out, but this is a problem I frequently find on DVDs of many British shows. I just remember to keep remote in hand, finger poised over that volume control!

This is perhaps not the DVD collection to begin watching Last of the Summer Wine, but it's a must for all seasoned Summer Wine viewers.",1373068800,,1039,4.718232044198895
5295714,5,B009A68ESA,"Not the LOTSW series, but me having to give a great review to each and every one of the annual series that I have in my collection.  For me, the BBC does not produce them fast enough.  I have a multi-region DVD player and am very tempted to start buying DVDs from Region 2 or whatever region England is in.  Can not get enough of these silly old people and their immature antics.",1371686400,,379,4.164383561643835
5295715,5,B009A68ESA,Its good to be young  even when your not. I want to be there with them and experiencing the same horse play by old timers. .,1371513600,,124,3.769230769230769
5295716,5,B009A68ESA,This series appeals to me & I like the characters. This year was a good one for Last of the Summer Wine.,1370995200,,104,3.772727272727273
5295717,5,B009A68ESA,"One of Britain most favorite comedies for over 30 yrs. and mine too.  Peter Sallis is my favorite character as Norman Clegg with his philosophical turn of mind.  I also learned a new language, ""British English"" and slang.",1370736000,,221,4.7894736842105265
5295718,5,B009A68ESA,"The longest running comedy show on the planet.  Leave it to the Brits to come up with well written scripts that are extremely funny without being insipid or inane.  It's much like the Little Rascals at the other end of life, after they've all retired.  I can't imagine why the entire series is not already available on DVD.",1370390400,,323,4.5344827586206895
5295719,5,B009A68ESA,Love this show. Watch these with my grandkids and love this series.  Wish I had all of them in my library.,1367798400,,106,4.0476190476190474
5295720,5,B009A68ESA,"How could anyone not love Foggy cooking up stupid ideas for Compo and Cleggie to do.  Then there is Howard and his love life.  Everyone knows a Howard and all men have met a Marina one time or another.  And just like Clegg, we are all scared to death of her.",1367193600,,258,4.019607843137255
5295721,5,B009A68ESA,we will soon own all the tapes. We could watch these all the time. This British humor keeps us laughing over and over,1367107200,,117,4.130434782608695
5295722,5,B009A68ESA,"Bought this as a gift, and to have a collection of this series beginning with vintage 1985.  My husband enjoys the shows very much, especially ""Foggy"".",1366761600,,151,4.8076923076923075
5295723,4,B009A68ESA,"Warm and funny, with beautiful countryside and friendships.  My only criticism is the lack of episode names on discs and the box they came in had flimsy inserts.

As for the series, I highly recommend it to anyone who likes shows you can watch over and over again and enjoy!",1365379200,2,274,4.46
5295724,5,B009A68ESA,This is a great comedic series....how does a writer stay so consistent over the many years?  I enjoy watching them over and over!,1364774400,,129,4.608695652173913
