1196266,5,B000006QGL,My husband is a huge Audie Murphy fan and watches his movies continuously (like to drive me crazy sometimes!). He had a lot of knowlegde of Mr. Murphy of both his movie and military career and so I thought this would be a great gift to add to his collection.  The movie is based mostly on Mr. Murphys courageous military career. He loved it. Im certain we will watch it over and over again!:-)  :-(,1168473600,24,398,4.293333333333333

1196270,5,B000006QGL,"This is a fine Overview of a great American Military hero.  If one knows nothing about Audie Murphy, this is well worth viewing.  Obviously it is impossible to compact one life into one hour.  However, this is a great way to become familiar with Audie Murphy.  If one wishes to read further, please consider the BOOK, ""To Hell and Back"".",1480464000,,337,4.566666666666666

1196279,4,B000006QGL,"Not bad, but I've seen a lot of better Audie Murphy stories.  This one is shorter than I thought it would be, and it didn't focus enough on what I think are the most interesting aspects of his life (childhood, friendships during WW2, exploits during WW2, and interesting facts about his interactions with some of the people he regularly worked with on set.)",1448323200,3,357,4.666666666666667

1196284,5,B000006QGL,"Hadn't seen the tribute to Audie Murphy in many years.  Quality of the film is good and the story is extremely interesting.  I do take exception to one thing, however.  The outer case description describes his ""drug addiction.""  That really bothers me because anyone who knew Audie understand his only ""addiction"" was to sleeping pills which he used in excess in attempt to deal with his PTSD.  The film itself correctly acknowledges the sleeping pills.  I just find that cover description very inaccurate and disrespectful.

But I do highly recommend this DVD.  More people, especially the younger generation, should know the name Audie Murphy.",1438387200,9,645,5.134615384615385

1196301,5,B000006QGL,This was just as I expected. I purchased this for my grandchildren after we had visited Mr. Murphy's gravesite at Arlington. I wanted them to know the MAN.  It met all my expectations. I had seen it but I wanted it as a part of my inventory for my grandchildren to have as a part of American History.,1399852800,3,300,4.172413793103448

1196303,5,B000006QGL,VERY GOOD HISTORY OF ONE OF THR GREATEST AMERICAN HERO OF ALL TIME. A COMPLETE LIST OF HIS MEDALS AND HOW HE EARNED THEM WOULD HAVE IMPROVED THE BOOK,1369353600,,149,4.172413793103448

1196308,5,B000006QGL,I viewed this because a friend just became inducted into the Audie Murphy club.  I found it quite interesting that I knew nothing about him but his name prior to viewing the video.  It is appropriate for classroom use and can be viewed by students from 5th grade on without concern for inappropriate content.  I have written a viewing guide for the video and it can be found on the teacherspayteachers website if you are interested.,1349222400,2,432,4.657894736842105
1196309,5,B000006QGL,He was the real deal.  Have your kids watch this.  They need this kind of role model.  He was one for my generation,1339200000,2,115,3.9130434782608696
1196310,5,B000006QGL,"I wish they had this back in the 50's when I was growing up.  I was 8 when I first saw To Hell and Back and from then on Audie Murphy was on top of my list of hero's like Charles Bronson, John Wayne, Henry Fonda and Errol Flynn.  Like Bronson, Audie was not only a real combat hero of WWII, but the ultimate real life hero.  To bad the generation of today don't have people they can look up to like Audie, but only those a...hole rap crap and anti American hollywood figures of today.  Old Hollywood were true Americans and even most of the famous actors served in WWII.  Even the actresses like Bette Davis and Joan Crawford did their part to help the troops.",1328745600,9,660,4.165354330708661
1196311,5,B000006QGL,As a history major I was disappointed that I fell in love with Audie Murphy as an actor and not because of his actions as a World War II soldier. It wasn't until much later that I learned that he was a WOrld War II Hero. His love for his country and duty should be known even today.  You should be able to ask students who Audie Murphy was and they should be able to identify him as a WWII vet and hero.  I would tell anyone that knows his for his acting ability that they should get this DVD and watch.,1308700800,2,503,3.9215686274509802
1196312,5,B000006QGL,"Audie Murphy was the most decorated soldier during World War II.  He was a Texas boy and raised in poverty.  He had difficulty getting accepted into the Military because of his young age and small stature.  His older sister gave permission for him to enlist.  He was accepted into the army at age 17 after being turned down by the other branches. He was a crack shot, due to his hunting game to feed his family.  He received the Congressional Medal of Honor just before his 19th birthday, due to his actions on the battlefield.  There is a museum with pictures and all his medals at Greenville TX.  It is truly inspiring.  He was in his 40's, when he died in a plane crash.  He suffered from PTSD all his life from the horrors he saw during the war and slept with a gun under his pillow.  My only complaint was the video  was a little too short.  The biography was inspiring and well worth the money.  I would highly recommend this important piece of history.",1306800000,16,959,4.380681818181818
1196313,4,B000006QGL,"As a retired military member, I have to admire all that Audie Murphy did for his country and for his comrades.  This is a well put together documentary, with lots of video and still photos, which reminds you that war, for the combat veteran, goes well beyond the battlefield.
The documentary goes into Murphy's life after the war, and it touches your heart to think the war truly never left him.  Murphy's sister is interviewed, and the movie does a great job of showing the life of this American Hero.  It left me feeling very sad for Audie, as he gave so much, and suffered a great deal.",1299715200,9,589,4.435185185185185
1196314,5,B000006QGL,"This is a great biography of a hero I grew up watching. Learning of his youth and hardships bolsters my belief that we can do anything we set out to do, no matter what the adversity. He was a true hero.",1292371200,,202,3.951219512195122
1196315,5,B000006QGL,"Many times in my life I have felt the need to describe a real war hero. Usually Audie Murphy is my example. With the two DVD's (This one and the movie, 'To Hell And Back') I no longer have to just describe the actions of a true hero, now I can pop the DVD in and let 'em watch!",1283817600,,277,3.711864406779661
1196316,5,B000006QGL,"A real war hero,what a humble man. Audie Murphy,i remember watching his movies, when i was younger. There's just something about Audie...he's a very captivating man. The Biography was very interesting,,nothing like other peoples life stories, they can be quiet boring. Do youself a favour buy or watch this dvd, you won't be disappointed.",1271808000,12,338,5.277777777777778
1196317,1,B000006QGL,"This was probably the worse book I have ever read, much less purchased. I have always been a big fan of Audie Murphy and he certainly seems to have earned the rewards he got from being a war heroe. However, the book was just terrible. Are you interested in hearing a couple of guys sitting in a fox hole and speaking like 5 year olds. Then, this is the book for you. It wasn't the one for me.",1270512000,,392,4.038461538461538
