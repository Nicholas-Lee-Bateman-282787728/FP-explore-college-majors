8155209,5,B000K9C65S,"I enjoyed each video of this 6 part series (by 2011). This is a revealing of many of the origions of soul/hip-hop music that has gone 'back to Egypt' with their anti-Christian agenda. Since 'hip-hop' is now a declared religion with its own New testament (KRS-1), it is important that the Word is exalted without the help of this kind of expression in our churches and youth groups. This video goes to the roots (before rapping) and exposes the calling of Egypt to let you choose which side you're on and how to help others.",1303603200,,523,4.515789473684211
8155210,5,B000K9C65S,"This message really changed my life. Not only have my eyes opened to the things that I used to do, but my sense of awareness is more keen than ever...all glory be to God. I mean, there are things out there that shocked me when I learned of the demonic roots behind them. Talk about discernment! I recommend that everyone takes a look at what's being pumped into our world. This is a spiritual war ladies and gentleman...and don't you ever forget it!",1281571200,9,449,4.421686746987952
8155211,5,B000K9C65S,"I think this series is a must watch for every person no matter what your religious or non-religious persuasion happens to be.  This video series is a rude awakening into the very nature and source of evil (Satan), and how Satan is using music to lead countless people astray, especially in this end-time generation .  This video series is a must see for every teenager.  I had the opportunity to experience this event live at a local church, and was simply amazed by the truth that was shared.  [...]  Finally I have no affiliation with this church other than being a part of the body of Christ so my comments are totally nuetral. May God Bless You.",1239235200,5,649,4.512820512820513
8155212,5,B000K9C65S,"I happened on to part1 of ""The Truth Behind Hip-Hop"" by chance, and I have never regretted investing in this series. I must admit to being hesitant to learn the truth about some of the people I admired like Jay-Z and Erykah Badu and Jill Scott, but even as the Bible says ""the truth shall set you free.""",1207958400,3,303,4.241379310344827
8155213,5,B000K9C65S,This dvd gives a very clear consised straight forward look at what exactly is going on in today's world. It is worth a look see. I would highly recomend  this and other dvd's from the series to anyone who really just wants to know what's going on in today's cultural mindset.,1183939200,5,275,4.392156862745098
8155214,5,B000K9C65S,"I have watched the 1st three series of The Truth Behind Hip Hop, and it has opened my eyes. I have been a Christian for some time, and I must say I definately never gave it any thought as to what I was listening to, or watching, how it effected my children. It not only opens your eyes to the truth of hip hop, but of everything in this World.",1174348800,5,343,3.914285714285714
