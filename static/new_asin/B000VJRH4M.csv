8219067,2,B000VJRH4M,"This movie advertises itself as an Egyptian Home Alone-type movie, which in some ways it is, but the quality is poor. The pictures and sound aren't great and the acting is very bad. A lot of inexplicable stuff happens and the movie kind of wanders around a bit. Look elsewhere if you want a decent Egyptian movie.",1235779200,,313,4.508771929824562
