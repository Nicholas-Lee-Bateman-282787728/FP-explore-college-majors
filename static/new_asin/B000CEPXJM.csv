You'll then see EXAMPLES of their elaborate, beautiful fair isle sweaters and other items you can knit using their SURPRISINGLY SIMPLE TO MAKE DESIGNS. The patterns are also shown in different colorways, enabling you to see how simple color changes (using the same pattern) can produce vastly different sweaters, shawls, hats, socks, etc! For actual patterns and detailed illustrations, you should buy their book ""Fair Isle Sweaters Simplified""*.

A LARGE PART OF THE VIDEO shows Ann B. DEMONSTRATING how to use their SIMPLIFIED TWO-HANDED TECHNIQUE and other tips and finishing techniques. She explains things clearly and in just the right time, not too slow and not too fast! Eugene B. demonstrates how a dye as simple as kool-aid can be used to color their soft, lanolin rich wool. The whole video is PRESENTED IN A FRIENDLY AND VISUALLY APPEALING manner. How anyone can watch this video and just think ""promotional"" is beyond me and will be beyond you too when you see this beautifully produced video with members and friends of the Bourgeois Family.

*I originally bought the book first (as a NEW KNITTER at that), then the video shortly after it was produced. I still have the book, which is excellent also by the way, but have since lost the video. I paid full price for it at the time. Imagine my surprise when I found the same video here for WAAAAY LESS! I paid more for the shipping than I did the video itself (YAY)! I love it when ""it"" happens like that...!

If you don't know how to knit with two hands at the same time, you should learn! Once you do, you will never again feel limited by knitting pattern or any knitting style, ever!!! This video will help point the way...  :)",1294358400,6,1868,4.720858895705521
8098176,3,B000CEPXJM,"When I was on Philosopher's Wool website and saw the little video clip I thought that was just a taste of what the DVD would teach so I was impressed.  When I received my DVD (through their website), I was very disappointed.  The website video clip is almost all of the fair isle taught on the DVD, could there be only four or five fair isle techniques?  The rest of the DVD is selling their products and showing the sweaters you could knit with their kits (most not up close so as to see the pattern).  Maybe buying the DVD used would be worth it, I paid full price and I would not buy this DVD if I had it to do over, I'd buy a book.",1277078400,2,635,3.9763779527559056
