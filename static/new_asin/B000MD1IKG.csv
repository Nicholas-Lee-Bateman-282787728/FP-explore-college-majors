I would say this is the only best thriller film I've ever seen in bollywood. The story is just superb. Although the acting was fantastic, some portions were severly overacted. Especially the sequence after the climax. But all in all, this is the kind of stuff we need to see from these modern contemporary filmmakers.  Manoj Bajpai is an actor who lets himself get absorbed by the character and the story. That's exactly what an actor should do. He is so good as a performer, his role written with such conviction. And as for Urmilla, well those of you who have seen her previous films already know that she cannot be praised enough. She is a strong performer in every genre.",1349308800,,927,4.646341463414634

The story is that of a woman at home alone during a big rainstorm.  A man comes to the door, some kind of businessman or something, & is looking for someone that apparently does not live there, but the woman tells him he's got the wrong house.  But the man will not leave, & comes back, time after time, to knock on the door & bother the woman.  The woman is of course quite disturbed by this considering that there's a killer loose in the area, it's been on the news & she's in fear of her life.  But somehow, in a weak moment, the man gets in.

She's quite concerned because he's overly friendly & talkative, and he's beginning to scare her with his line of conversation.  She does offer him food & drink, and then she notices that somehow her cat has been killed, and she thinks she's next, and in attempting to flee the house, she runs into another man at the door, who claims to be a police officer (undercover).  So now she's in the house with these two men, one of whom has a gun, both of whom don't trust each other, and she's not too sure about either of them herself.

Tension builds as the men go at each other, and the woman gets control of the gun...and it turns out that the ""police officer"" is not what he seems at all.  But then again, really, neither is anyone else.

This is a bit overacted, I thought, for the first half of the film, but that isn't so much a factor later in the film, and what's really going on caught me very much by surprise.  Quite an enjoyable suspense thriller, really, with an excellent ""twist"", and worth a look if you like Indian thrillers.",1249516800,,1744,4.235649546827794
