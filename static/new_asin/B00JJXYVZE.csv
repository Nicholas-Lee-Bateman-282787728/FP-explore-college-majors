6365304,4,B00JJXYVZE,"Charming comedy, the way the French know how to make. Entertaining, funny, excellent actors. If you like French literature, Moliere in particular, (and even if you don't) you'll enjoy it. It even has a few unexpected twists that make it even better.",1414108800,,249,4.9523809523809526
6365305,5,B00JJXYVZE,"The plot in this French `comedy' is simple, but the execution is far from straightforward.  Gauthier Valence (Lambert Wilson -`Of Gods and Men') is a successful actor. He is the star of a french TV show where he plays a frontier brain surgeon. He wants to do some serious `luvvy' type acting and wants to put on `The Misanthrope' by Moliere.  However, he wants a star that has lost some shine but still has enough 'pull' to guarantee success.

Serge Tanneur (played by the wonderful Fabrice Luchini) is a retired actor; he lives like a recluse in a house his uncle left him and shuns the limelight. Gauthier approaches him to play second fiddle to him in his production, but he also has a hook; and that is they will alternate the two main roles each night. Both roles are a `stretch' as you say in thespo world, and they are also at odds emotionally. Against his initial wishes, Serge agrees to do some rehearsals before he agrees to be in the play. What follows is a story of triumphs, torments, tantrums and acting lessons to a newly qualified porn star.

This film is a gentle comedy; I found little to laugh at, it is more amusing and sometimes charming, but also has teeth. However, the central performances are things to be behold as there is just so much going on and the delivery of both the leads is glorious. All of the supporting players are fine, but you really don't notice them too much (apart from the porn star lady) as Luchini and Wilson take up the whole stage. This is a play about ego and art and the two main men must have brought a lot of themselves to these roles. I absolutely loved it and after writing this I am going to watch it again - one to keep.",1413072000,2,1677,4.365384615384615
6365306,1,B00JJXYVZE,"This is a continuous complaint with Amazon movies and I've sent feedback, but I expect it goes against the movie rather than the fact that Amazon ""hides"" the preview trailer behind their ""Other movies customers rented..."" banner so you cannot read the subtitles or see the bottom half of the screen! Why should I take a chance on renting a movie if the trailer is messed up on every foreign movie I attempt to view?",1410307200,,415,4.546666666666667
6365307,5,B00JJXYVZE,It is a refreshing movie for people that like plays and those that want to observe  unexpected behaviors of people that we think we know. A moment that I found delightful was a when this Italian woman offers a ride and sing to  this famous actor and she is so alive and enticing that he is carried into this happy moment and sings with her.,1409443200,,340,4.2153846153846155
6365308,3,B00JJXYVZE,"Good interpretation but to really enjoy it you have to read Moliere's ""The Misanthrope"" first.",1409011200,,94,5.333333333333333

8651569,5,B00JJXYVZE,"Excellent flick~love Fench films...was not boring, rather clever plot.  The two leads well matched and professional.  The area of France where this is set is also beautiful.  Visually moving as a whole, this film.",1470182400,,213,5.205882352941177
8651570,2,B00JJXYVZE,"For the French, Moliere is the equivalent of Shakespeare.  What can I say?  Their literary judgment is definitely skewed.

So the idea for this movie obviously was to cram tidbits of Moliere's text into a modern scenario.  The result would be ipso facto ""literate,"" and hence something adored by the French public.

It worked.  The pretentious French public loved it--since to feel otherwise would mean that you didn't appreciate Moliere.

Americans, having no pre-conceived notion of Moliere's presumed genius, will probably wonder what this movie's about.  Seems to be nothing more than a series of arguments between two middle-aged men.

Alas, that's all it is.  Don't waste your time.",1466467200,,688,5.229357798165138

8651574,2,B00JJXYVZE,"I really wanted to like this film as foreign films are among my faves.  But, honestly, I had to push myself through it.  I agree with one of the reviewers that it's better to read the book first (The Misanthrope) in order to enjoy the movie more.",1433030400,,246,4.212765957446808
8651575,4,B00JJXYVZE,"As a Francophile, I found this film to be a lovely combination of humor, drama, French countryside, and the beautiful rhyming verses of Moliere. There are some laugh-out-loud moments, but most of the time is taken up by the actors rehearsing their lines and reflecting all too well in their behavior towards each other the ego, mistrust, and dislike for others that The Misanthrope is about. It shows how little humanity has changed since Moliere's time. Clever, sweet in places, and with a realistic ending.",1427068800,,508,4.988235294117647
