8255091,5,B0014CKCEW,"A wonderful and delightful series based on a toy and a book series from the 80's .  Teddy Ruxpin will be hailed as a classic and beloved memory among children of the 80's and is back to share with a whole new generation .  Being the second release on DVD filled with 20 beautifully animated full color cartoons , with story arcs that connect to each other .  Teddy Ruxpin , Grubby and Newton Gimmick embark on one amazing adventure after another .  Battling wits with the ever green and horrible canon shot Tweeg who tries to make the cut with MAVO ( monsters and villains organization ) and impress the supreme ruler Quilor and his mummy Ellenor .  The gang finds themselves learning with Leota the wood sprite , and helping they're dear friend the Wooly Whatsit .  We see beautiful sites such as rainbow falls and return to the Kingdom of King Nogbert and see more of Prince Aaron and Princess Aruzia.
There is so much to love about his series and despite some of the lacking video quality and the audio fuzz this show holds up against the test of time.  The only down fall to this set of DVD's is that there are no bonus features to be found on any disc .
The Complete Series has been released in three sets of 2 disc containing all 65 episodes .  Mysteries of the Hard To Find City is packed with great episodes and many memorable songs .
If your looking for an old show teaches children great lessons in friendship don't pass up this gem to share with your child . Boys and Girls of all ages will love reliving every moment of this with you just as you did as a kid .",1393200000,,1572,4.251677852348993

8255095,5,B0014CKCEW,"Mill Creek brings twenty more episodes of the classic cartoon - and despite wear on the film and audio - the cartoons still have an innocence which brings out their charm. As I expected, the overall arc for the series deepens, villains like Quellor and Mrs. Maggotheart get nastier, as the three heroes solve the mysteries of the six crystals discovered the last DVD set.

It is nice to see Mill Creek fulfill their promise - I wonder if the previous company knew how precious the memories of Teddy are to those who met him in the 1980's?",1214265600,4,538,4.489795918367347
