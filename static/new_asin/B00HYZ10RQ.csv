6243420,5,B00HYZ10RQ,I love this series. I'm hooked John Nettles is great. I love the scenery & the story lines are great. The stories have murder but it is done in such a tasteful way. No one else could play Barnaby like Nettles. I will continue to buy this series. I have all three of the box sets & can't wait for the next-if it takes too long I will just buy them separately. I like all of the actors that have played his partners-they each bring their own spice to the show. I am a fan for life.,1289347200,11,479,3.948453608247423
6243421,5,B00HYZ10RQ,I wish they would broadcast these shows regularly on U.S. television.  Lots of fun and usually interesting mysteries.,1288656000,6,117,5.5
6243422,5,B00HYZ10RQ,"Rampant murder, mystifyingly delicious, & in ways comparable to Poirot and Foyle's War. DCI Barnaby (John Nettles) has investigated fictional Midsomer County's murder abundance since 1997. 'Village Case Files' set offers 16 feature-length stories. Killing chaos is Midsomer normal. But filming done in rural hamlets just outside London are sweetly picturesque--enough to create a desire for tea with scones. Bloody good murder mystery, buttery good scones by Barnaby's loving wife Joyce (Jane Wymark) who helps lighten the stories with homespun gentleness. There is even some comedy mixed into each episode. My wife and I can't get enough of Midsomer Murders. It was this show that made us chronic British crime mystery fans.

Guest stars (every big UK star wants to be a guest now) make this a fresh dynamic series each time. Multiple murders per episode is a trademark, started at the very beginning, by the writers/producers to make Midsomer Murders unique.  Acceptable language, little or no swearing, but plenty of good family murder mystery where the murder is almost never seen, just the moments up to the kill, and then of course the body; all lend itself to older kids and family viewing. All the delightful settings, sets, scenic environments are enticing, making murder mystery a pleasure. The set is comparable to ""Foyles War: Series 1-5 Dunkirk to VE-Day"" (see my review).

A Midsomer Murder is like a travelogue, but better, and the longer the series runs, the better that gets. You'll want to set yourself down in a town green, at a location like Badger's Wood, and sip tea in quality china, just waiting on a few body parts to drop from the sky. This series was based on books by novelist Caroline Graham, but have gone beyond those book without loosing the flavor in the continuing filming of this series.

Also you may want to get ""Midsomer Murder: Barnaby's Casebook"" & the earlier set, ""Midsomer Murders - The Early Cases Collection."" Buying them in the sets lets you catch up with the newer show releases.

6243423,4,B00HYZ10RQ,"Imagine Saint Mary Mead. Squared. Then add some extra blood and mayhem.

That about describes the setting of ""Midsomer Murders,"" a morbidly witty British mystery series based on Caroline Graham's novels. And ""Midsomer Murders: The Village Case Files"" brings together the the next round of sixteen cases in this cozy, dark little county, drawing from the ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth sets.

First, Barbaby (John Nettles) and Scott (John Hopkins) come to investigate a baffling round of crimes -- murders involving a town split by a spiritualist church, a valuable orchid and an erotic diary, a local regatta, a famed racing horse, a town seemingly blessed with psychic powers, a man killed with flying wine bottles, a naked body in a relish factory, and a famed composer's greatest masterpiece and soap opera life.

Then when Scott goes on a permanent sick leave, Barnaby gets a new sidekick: Ben Jones (Jason Hughes). He arrives just in time for a couple to be garroted in front of a haunted house, the death of a dead festival queen, blackmail, an obese aristocrat with a very suspicious family, a traditional battle of the sexes, a murder on supermarket land, a chorale whose tenor is killed, and a notorious murder case that Barnaby starts to second-guess.

Miss Marple would feel right at home in Midsomer County -- it's a pleasant, sunshiney place, full of pleasant small businesses, farmers and aristocrats. Every episode is set in the various villages in this county, which is picturesque, lush, and full of farms, cute little English villages, opulent manorhouses, and little cottages.

So of course, there are gruesome murders, plotting and tawdry secrets hidden in every corner, not to mention a healthy dose of torture, fraud, blackmail and theft. Every now and then they have a dud episode (the contrived ""House in the Woods""). But the writers keep a funny edge in the stories, such as Barnaby trying to avoid buying a boat, and some clever dialogue (an aged monk reading an R-rated diary out loud).

John Nettles is absolutely wonderful as the kindly, middle-aged cop with a brain like stainless steel, and his nice sedate family is a relief from all the Midsomer mayhem. Hopkins just doesn't gel well as Scott, and it doesn't take long for him to get unceremoniously written out. That turns out to be a good thing, because Hughes is a much more likable sidekick, being both sensible and a little unnerved by all the weirdness.

""Midsomer Murders: The Village Case Files"" is a big, solidly-written chunk of British coziness, with murder and scandal in every episode, and some new transitions for the homicide division.",1283644800,39,2637,4.965986394557823

6243434,5,B00HYZ10RQ,"As a long time Midsomer Murders fan, I had been looking for a good British series. The entireity of the series is exceptionally good and entertaining. New characters are introduced, and it did not take long to welcome them. In fact, Every well known English actor has appeared at least once in this series. It made the last of the series a little more exciting. I was given this series from a pal in the UK

John Nettles is Barnaby and Daniel Casey is his DS. Barnaby is thinking if retiring. He is young with city experience and wonders if country life will suit him. However, he is more than willing to give it a try. Badgers Drift is the scene, and there seem to be more murders than necessary. The mysteries and murders continue. We meet some of the families of all involved.  All of the episodes are well done and entertaining. And the last episode, well..wait and see.

6243544,5,B00HYZ10RQ,"If you're a television mystery lover, you're going to love this show. The lead actor, Nettles, is engaging without being overly dramatic. He's a solid actor with masculinity and poise. He's got that solid fatherly quality which exudes confidence, an occasional smirk, and a quick sleuth's mind. The supporting cast is very solid as well.

Each story is set in a small village somewhere in Midsomer county, England, and is unwound is a very well created manner. The producers are mature and skilled at storytelling. Hints are given, and you'll usually have a good chance to ferret out whodunnit... if you're a skilled tv murder detective yourself. They're not easy though. I'm still surprised most of the time!

This is a classic television story type, the likes of which American television seems to have forgotten how to produce. So, we turn to the British, who, thankfully not only have mastered the craft, but still value the creation of series like this one.

This show is more mature than Murder She Wrote, smarter than Banacek, not as transparent as Columbo (which I still love), and of the quality of the Agatha Christie series, while remaining set in our modern period, easy to understand and connect with, and easy to enjoy.

You ought to enjoy these shows a lot. A good purchase, Ultimately re-watchable as well. A+",1409356800,4,1325,4.875555555555556

6243591,4,B00HYZ10RQ,"Imagine Saint Mary Mead. Squared. Then add some extra blood and mayhem.

That about describes the setting of ""Midsomer Murders,"" a morbidly witty British mystery series based on Caroline Graham's novels. And ""Midsomer Murders: The Village Case Files"" brings together the the next round of sixteen cases in this cozy, dark little county, drawing from the ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth sets.

First, Barbaby (John Nettles) and Scott (John Hopkins) come to investigate a baffling round of crimes -- murders involving a town split by a spiritualist church, a valuable orchid and an erotic diary, a local regatta, a famed racing horse, a town seemingly blessed with psychic powers, a man killed with flying wine bottles, a naked body in a relish factory, and a famed composer's greatest masterpiece and soap opera life.

Then when Scott goes on a permanent sick leave, Barnaby gets a new sidekick: Ben Jones (Jason Hughes). He arrives just in time for a couple to be garroted in front of a haunted house, the death of a dead festival queen, blackmail, an obese aristocrat with a very suspicious family, a traditional battle of the sexes, a murder on supermarket land, a chorale whose tenor is killed, and a notorious murder case that Barnaby starts to second-guess.

Miss Marple would feel right at home in Midsomer County -- it's a pleasant, sunshiney place, full of pleasant small businesses, farmers and aristocrats. Every episode is set in the various villages in this county, which is picturesque, lush, and full of farms, cute little English villages, opulent manorhouses, and little cottages.

So of course, there are gruesome murders, plotting and tawdry secrets hidden in every corner, not to mention a healthy dose of torture, fraud, blackmail and theft. Every now and then they have a dud episode (the contrived ""House in the Woods""). But the writers keep a funny edge in the stories, such as Barnaby trying to avoid buying a boat, and some clever dialogue (an aged monk reading an R-rated diary out loud).

John Nettles is absolutely wonderful as the kindly, middle-aged cop with a brain like stainless steel, and his nice sedate family is a relief from all the Midsomer mayhem. Hopkins just doesn't gel well as Scott, and it doesn't take long for him to get unceremoniously written out. That turns out to be a good thing, because Hughes is a much more likable sidekick, being both sensible and a little unnerved by all the weirdness.

""Midsomer Murders: The Village Case Files"" is a big, solidly-written chunk of British coziness, with murder and scandal in every episode, and some new transitions for the homicide division.",1391472000,5,2637,4.965986394557823

Soon I will have all 20 of the Midsomer Murder series with John Nettles as the main Character.,1370390400,,257,4.733333333333333

And this has some really nice secondary character development.  I want to know more about Jones and his personal life and it looks like that may come.  I always feel kinda sad when I've finished with the set.  Then, I go to Amazon and get the next one.

I have DVD sets 1-12 and it is such a joy to watch John Nettles with Daniel Casey. What a team! His second investigator thankfully didn't last more than one season- he was painful to watch. Ben Jones was a good choice for replacement. Can't wait for them to box the remaining John Nettles in his final years and purchase those. Watch these over and over- thoroughly enjoyable!",1319241600,,533,4.448979591836735
6243630,5,B00HYZ10RQ,"Yipping in wooded darkness, foxes run amuck in Midsomer County, announcing the eminent demise of one of the unfortunate denizens. This is dangerous territory, whose high body count has ""been remarked upon."" The forests are lovely and menacing, the animals of uncertain temperament.

A standout is Andrew Payne's ""Country Matters,"" where Englishwomen are domineering and enterprising: watch for the superb Clare Holeman (seen before in a fine early case), of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Mystery-Complete-Inspector-Lewis/dp/B0056031NW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece Mystery: Complete Inspector Lewis</a>&nbsp;and ""Inspector Morse"" series, and the whip-welding Juliet Aubrey, before she became a scary paleontologist in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Primeval-Volume-1-Series-1-and-2/dp/B001D2WUGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Primeval: Volume 1 (Series 1 and 2)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Primeval-Vol-2-Series-3/dp/B002D1XKB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Primeval, Vol. 2 (Series 3)</a>. New incarnations of the infamous Rainbirds are featured in ""Dead Letters,"" and Nettles' favorite creative macabre murder in ""Hidden Depths,"" via a catapult and bottles of Chateau Lafite. These are the Full Monty, no narrative is missing. What a treat! This collection reveals a Midsomer not seen on American television. When aired here, Midsomer's plots were abbreviated to accommodate room for commercials. Now, we get the well-seasoned bangers & mash of Barnaby's acerbic personality, and earthy English slang from his Sergeants. We relate to Barnaby's disdain for the insufferable clothing-clerk in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midsomer-Murders-The-Early-Cases-Collection/dp/B0011B9W38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midsomer Murders: The Early Cases Collection</a>, preferring the excellent Marks 'n Sparks too (decade-old slacks from there still look good). We finally understand why this series is such an international hit of great duration. Beware especially the residents of Badger's Drift, rife with hidden agendas, and well upholstered, over-chintzed women bearing tea. Settle down for a virtual escape to a bucolic English countryside strewn with mayhem. This long haul is best accompanied by plenty of goodies, as Midsomer delights in torturing its susceptible audience by lingering on tea-trays laden with countless delicacies, and scrumptious looking roasts with taters 'n gravy, sausages, pudding, well, you get the picture.

A note on the fine packaging: I'd been worried about ordering this repackaging of the previous boxed sets, due to vociferous complaints by several reviewers here. They led me to believe that the packaging consisted of cardboard envelopes for the disks or worse, like ""Avatar."" Don't worry. The packaging is good, consisting of multiple plastic holders for the disks within a box. This common storage for longer series works just fine; no problem whatsoever.

6243631,4,B00HYZ10RQ,I do love the Mid Sommer Mysteries and have 8 of the series including Barnaby's Case Book and Village Case Files.  I have enjoyed every one.  The only problem I have is that I have to be very careful in ordering as the same episodes are in different series and as expensive as they are I don't want to pay for them twice.  Wonder if something can be done about that.,1314835200,,366,4.126760563380282

(OK, so I went a bit out of order). Although John Nettles as DCI Barnaby can be a maddeningly inconsiderate and thoughtless husband, he is SPOT ON when it comes to solving murders. These stories give Agatha Christie a true run for her money, and she is my MOST FAVORITE mystery novelist. If you've never seen the show, like I hadn't, get the first series, well, first. After that I went on a shopping spree and now have Barnaby's Casebook, Village Case Files and soon to come, the Early Cases. Can't wait. Do yourself, and your brain, a favor.

6243637,4,B00HYZ10RQ,"The third box set in the Midsomer Murders catalog continues the formula of fairly gruesome crimes in the tranquil English countryside. I find this set to be a little more uneven than the earlier sets in the series; some of the stories are very good, while others stretch credulity a little too far in the search for originality. However, John Nettles always makes a very watchable and empathetic main character; Tom Barnaby is by no means perfect, but that only adds to his charm.

As always, the list of guest stars is impressive. In fact, I have a theory that the biggest name among the guest stars is usually the murderer! It's not foolproof, but I have managed to impress my wife a couple of times by picking the guilty party when the evidence seemed to point in another direction (it helps that I was raised in England, because actors who are popular there are not always as well-known here in the USA). The settings are very picturesque, with many old cottages and beautiful manor houses surrounded by lovely countryside.

This is one of the best of English mystery series and it's no wonder that it has enjoyed such a long and successful run.",1297641600,3,1149,4.627450980392157

DCI Barnaby and his Sergeants are different from many of the other great British detective series in that they seem like real people with everyday lives and families.
