651674,5,6303467199,"I watched this movie when I was little. When I found it on here, I was so happy and excited. But when I got it in the mail, there was a huge scratch on it. It wouldn't play on any of my devices. I'm giving it five stars cuz it's such a great movie. The condition doesn't even deserve a star",1406505600,,290,3.7704918032786887

651681,3,6303467199,"""Tiny, the Seventh Brother,"" this movie's predecessor, is, as I mentioned in my review of that product, a sweet, funny movie for all ages. This one is not.

First, the plot. Dr. Owl has been captured by poachers and it's up to the rest of the forest animals to rescue him. This is a pretty scary plot device, and there is at least one very clear picture of a gun going off.

Second, there is a possible error. The poachers is ""Seventh Brother"" are not terribly bright, and are only hunting for food. These poachers are semi-intelligent criminals, and the leader is truly evil.

Third, I have a bone to pick. Cody, who was my favorite of Tiny's rabbit friends, has grown quite a bit and is nearly as big as his mother. Not that I believe there is anything wrong with him growing, but I feel like a mom when they discover that their child has grown up too fast - kind of ""I miss his sweet little baby self.""

On the bright side, there is no foul languages or suggestive humor, and the rabbits' personalities remain intact. There are also a few hilarious scenes.  However, the whole thing left me with a kind of ""that's it?"" feeling.

Compared to most of the other garbage floating around out there, it's a 3-star movie or maybe even a 4. Compared to the first one, it's probably a 1 or a 2. Sad.

I'll leave the choice to you. If you want a sequel that measures up to the original, this is not the place to look. If you want a cute, funny, albeit pretty scary, movie that stands on its own, I can see where this would work - but even then why not just get ""Seventh Brother"" instead?",1122163200,5,1580,4.264214046822742
651682,4,6303467199,"Set in the wild frontier days, this movie is about two teenage boys on the cusp of adulthood who get lost in the wilderness together, and thier story of survival and friendship.  One is a Cree native american who is angry and confused after his schooling with a white school where they tried to beat the indian out of him.  The other boy is an orphan, who has grown up in an upper class boarding school, but must leave to live with his uncle, who is a fur trapper and canoe builder, when his trust fund runs out.  After his former life, he disgreards the spirituality of the native americans as silly superstition.
This story is about finding courage and friendship in times of trouble and hardship.  A good family movie, it contains lessons about listening to elders, peer presure, and being open to the ways of unfamilliar cultures.  A good movie for life lessons and discussion with your children.
This was also adapted from a book, and I belive I must find this book and read it now!",1035417600,3,987,4.4916201117318435

7847552,5,6303467199,"No doubt, this movie is absolutely perfect for kids. I remember watching it back when I was about six years old whenever we went to granma's house. Sometimes I'd watch it multiple times a day. Of course, I never new about The Seventh Brother until about 15 years after the last time I watched this movie (I know, it's sad) so I have some catching up to do. Still love this movie to death, though and I will be showing it to my little brothers and my kids later on.",1461283200,,464,4.166666666666667
