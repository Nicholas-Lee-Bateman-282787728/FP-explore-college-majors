It does have a good story and it was entertaining PLUS that little bonus of the best actor ever starring in it :) Also, watching his wife perform with him was a very neat thing to see.",1361923200,5,260,4.117647058823529

8524053,4,B0081LCRJW,Best print I've ever found for this movie. These PRC produced Michael Shayne films with Hugh Beaumont are awful but it is fun watching him get beat up constantly. Now I wish the other 4 films in this series were available. I have them but the quality is brutal. The first in the series is almost unwatchable it is so bad.,1470096000,,321,4.278688524590164

8524055,2,B0081LCRJW,"Lloyd Nolan had a solid run as Michael Shayne in seven B-movies for Fox in the early forties. Then in 1946-47, a second series of Shayne films were made starring Hugh Beaumont (Leave it to Beaver) as Shayne. Blonde for a Day was the third film.

In Blonde for a Day, Shayne heads back to his hometown from San Francisco when his old reporter pal Tim Rourke is put in hospital and out of commission while investigating racketeers. Shayne has to unravel the truth behind the shootings and the rackets.

The film has two things going for it. First, its based on a story by Brett Halliday and its easy to tell they kept to Hallidays plot, which is far more than you could say for most of the Fox Shayne films. The basics of the mystery are good and make the movie better than it would be otherwise. Beaumont is a competent leading man, while by no means a first choice for Shayne, he puts in a serviceable performance.

The rest of the film is fairly awful. It lacks the stylishness of the Nolan pictures and its poorly made in its own right. The beginning is hard to watch as its dominated by stock footage, bad acting, and a dreadful soundtrack plays over every scene. The other actors performances remain almost universally bad with dated routines (even by 1946 standards) being poorly executed.

This is the only Beaumont Shayne film to be released and as such, it is a bit of curiosity. Given the quality of the film, the best way to satisfy curiosity is with a $1.99 digital rental. Its just not worth buying the DVD unless you're a collector.",1449792000,,1545,4.468085106382978
8524056,4,B0081LCRJW,I love these old 1940s gum shoe movies. Hugh Beaumont is good as Michael Shane but if you've ever seen Lloyd Nolan in the part of Michael Shane you have seen the best. I think Mr. Nolan starred in only one of this series the movie was entitled THE MAN WHO WOULD NOT DIE costarring Marjorie Reynolds. He really made it a fun movie while people were getting killed left and right. The subject movie is pretty good but always wanted more from Mr. Nolan.,1439596800,,450,4.305882352941176
8524057,5,B0081LCRJW,"A superior low-budget mystery featuring Hugh Beaumont (yes, the Beaver's Dad) as PI Mike Shayne.  OK story.  Good cast.  Script moves the story along.  Has some punch to it.",1436745600,,173,4.862068965517241

8524060,3,B0081LCRJW,"Hugh  Beaumont plays a generic detective in this movie. If you have seen Lloyd Nolan in other Michael Shayne movies, then you will be disappointed in this one. One of the reasons for being a fan of a particular detective (Sherlock Holmes, Michael Shayne, Philo Vance) is that each has his or her (Hildegarde Withers, Miss Marple) own style which you particularly like.  This guy is no Michael Shayne. Otherwise, this movie is comparable to a decent Perry Mason. It seems in the late forties, all private detectives were hated by the police and harassed by them, which diidn't seem to be true in the thirties - Philo Vance, Hildegarde Withers. We seemed to have lost a great deal in the intervening WWII as far as mood, attitude, respect for authority and belief systems. That's why I like the thirties better.",1387411200,5,809,4.7304964539007095
8524061,5,B0081LCRJW,This is one of six Michael Shane Detective movies done in the 1940s - I love the genra and Hugh Beaumont does an okay job as Michael Shane - the other five movies starred Lloyd Nolan as the central character. - SBJ,1377043200,5,214,4.119047619047619
