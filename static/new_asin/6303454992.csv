7847256,5,6303454992,"I purchased this for a 5 year old girl. She loves the Olsen twins. She does not know the video is from the mid 1990s, so I guess that says how timeless these videos are! She loves the singing and the silly story lines. I originally bought the VHS tape, and have now purchased the series on amazon instant video. You can purchase one episode, or the whole series. The video is about 30 minutes long. It is just the right lenght to hold the little ones attention. I am happy with this purchase.",1353801600,,492,4.24468085106383
7847257,3,6303454992,"I don't expect MK & A videos to be deeply educational or fabulously PC, but I do expect them to be nice. The song BUTT OUT, sung to their younger sister, caused me to fast forward this video and then to tell my children we weren't going to watch it again. Other than that, it's the same as any of the other videos in terms of quality, storyline, etc.",1088035200,,350,4.086956521739131
