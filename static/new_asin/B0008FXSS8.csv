8056035,3,B0008FXSS8,"Britten s way down on my list of favorite composers, but works of American composers should be seen and listened to.  I sort of forced myself to see it in its entirety, but I am glad I did.",1484438400,,189,3.973684210526316
8056036,5,B0008FXSS8,"This well-regarded English National Opera production of Britten's chamber opera is here presented by Kultur in the handicapped form. Firstly, no subtitles! That practically means a lot of words won't be understood, at least for me.(*) Secondly, the sound track is encoded in the heavily compressed Dolby Digital format (mp3 quality). Unfortunately, Kultur has the exclusive right for (Northern) American distributions, which excludes any commercial competition.

Fortunately, for those who are not satisfied with this presentation there is an alternative DVD of the *same* performance by Arthaus:

Even though the above Arthaus DVD can only be commercially distributed in the Europe, it shouldn't stop any Britten/Opera enthusiast from ordering online. While it is still not perfect, it is far more acceptable with the following benefits:

1. The Arthaus DVD is in NTSC and Region 0 (all regions), not in PAL as claimed by Amazon.
2. The sound track, while still no high fidelity, is encoded in (uncompressed) LPCM (CD quality).
3. Most importantly, subtitles are available in English, French, German and Spanish!

The asking price of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Arthaus-DVD/dp/B000CIWXQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Arthaus DVD</a>&nbsp;at Amazon is a bit high, but budget-conscious shoppers can find better prices at UK's retail sites, e.g. Amazon's own UK site.

A few dollars saved on this Kultur version is in my opinion not worth the trade-off.

8056037,5,B0008FXSS8,"I finally discover a DVDed performance of a Britten opera that I truly appreciate, and two previous reviewers have dinged it. Oh well, de gustibus, said the farmer as he kissed his sow.

One of the negative reviewers complains that the staging is sparse. Okay, it's sparse. But who cares? It's not really an opera in any usual sense. It's an oratorio, in the strictest baroque sense, of a drama to be sung at the altar in the oratory -- the prayer space -- of a religious edifice. In fact, it's very close in structure to the so-called Jesuit Operas that were composed for ""missionary' performance in the New World in the 17th C. It has a narrator in lieu of an evangelist, and then in the second act two narrators who conclude the oratory with a genuine Christian sermon. As a non-Christian, I suppose I could have done without the sermon's message, but the music that carries it is spellbinding, among the best Britten ever composed. Sparse? Indeed the music itself is spare and precise, most of it, only to be suddenly elevated into passions: rage and despair at some points, delight and mirth at others. The duet of the two maids, while they arrange flowers unknowing of their mistress's grief, is gorgeous, and the scattering of flowers on the stage is visual support enough. The miltary uniforms of the male characters are acceptably relevant to the drama, as are the ""samurai"" paper screens against which characters are sometimes seen in silhouette. I can't imagine that more costuming and more props would do anything but distract from the pure impact of this work.

In the end, after all, it's the music that matters, and this is very very fine music. I've not said that often about other productions of Britten's operas. I've griped repeatedly about the ""unsingability"" of his vocal scores, of the absence of ""music"" in his music. Now I get it! Britten's vocal lines are hard to sing, and the vast majority of singers simply mess them up! Get the pitches wrong. Lose the intervals! Groan and growl their notes because they think no one will hear their confusion! Okay okay, that might be an unfair overstatement, but I've heard ""The Rape of Lucretia"" in live performance and I KNOW the singers were not matching the tonal accuracy of the cast in this production. Sing the right notes, and sing then with rich timbres, and wow! it's MUSIC!

It's also very fine theater -- concise, emotionally gripping, verbally effective. The reviewer who complains about the absence of ""subtitles"" has a point; if British English isn't your home dialect, you will find it hard to catch all the words. I had an advantage, having heard the work before, but I also lost a phrase here and there. The affective clarity of the music, nevertheless, should be enough to carry any listener through. The only other production of a Britten opera that approaches this one in musical excellence is ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" with David Daniels.",1328486400,4,2926,4.767258382642998
8056038,2,B0008FXSS8,"I strongly second the previous reviewer's strong objection to the lack of surtitles.

Very few words were understandable even if the singers are singing in English.  This was especially so with the female singers.  The packaging contains only the titles of a few arias or scenes;  no summary of the story is available.  The names of the singers are given on the outside package but not their roles.  It appears that this DVD is designed only for those who know this obscure opera well.  The production is again bareboned and in modern dress.  Without aid from the producers, who and what is going on is mostly unclear.  It's good that there is a DVD available for this opera, but it is largely unsatisfactory for anyone other than a Britten expert.",1144886400,13,748,4.6923076923076925
8056039,4,B0008FXSS8,"This is one of Britten`s starkest scores, not the ""fluidity"" of Grimes or the sensuality of Venice. But, great music.

As this is largely a static plot, no much movement goes on stage.

The staging is very restrained, with distinct japanese influences.

The singing and acting are very good, so why only 4 stars? ENO gets the full 5, but Kultur, alas... The rransfers are good, but not more. Why in the name of G do they not include  subtitles? It`s essential, even for an opera sung in English. So, for the future PLEASE!",1124668800,27,522,4.5212765957446805
