4595231,5,B0057FGCMS,"My 3 yr old is Mickey obsessed and watches it on disney every weekend.  We saw the Mickey Space, and of course he had to have it.

4595232,4,B0057FGCMS,"This DVD features a few great Mickey Mouse Clubhouse episodes (one that has never been seen yet on air) and is perfect for any Mickey fan.  My boys love that they can watch Mickey and the gang anytime they want and now anywhere since it comes with a Digital Copy (meaning you can load the disc on your iPad, iPod or mobile device very quickly and easily!)  The episodes are space-themed and there is 70 minutes full of fun plus bonus features!  You can also use the Mickey Mote with this DVD for more fun!",1321401600,,505,4.294736842105263

4595245,1,B0057FGCMS,"Ok, my son loves Mickey, especially Mickey Mouse Funhouse.  We purchased several of the DVDs as Christmas gifts.

Much to our surprise, there is no easy way to put the content the DVDs on his Android tablet.... it will only allow you to copy the product to I-devices (must use iTunes), or devices with windows media player installed.  He is turning 3 soon, and I just can't justify purchasing anything other than an inexpensive tablet.  This thing comes with a onetime use download code and some copy protection hocus-pocus that does funky crap to you computer and storage devices.....

I understand why Disney wants to protect their intellectual property, but, they need to remember that the people purchasing the DVDs are trying to do it the right way or they would have just downloaded it via some pirate site in the first place.....so my advice to any Android customers is don't buy this DVD.  I know my saying this will have little or no effect on the empire that is Disney, but, if I save one other person some grief, it will be worth it.",1419724800,3,1044,4.616216216216216

4595252,5,B0057FGCMS,"My three year olds enjoy watching Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. However this is the one they ask to watch repeatedly. They act out scenes when playing together. It also peaked their interest in outer space. I just wish there was more than one additional episode on the dvd as some of the other Clubhouse DVDs have 4 episodes, this just has two.",1407715200,,338,4.557377049180328

Normally he is glued to the screen from start to finish for anything Mickey Mouse related he watches; however, this one he walked away from and never came back.  It really was a bit boring.  What can I say?  Sorry Mickey!  We still love you...just not this episode.",1402963200,,476,4.488372093023256

Despite reading many reviews in which customers complained that this particular DVD didn't work int heir player, I purchased this anyways as it is my son's favorite episode. We have a Panasonic Blu-ray/DVD player that is only a couple of years old - I figured this DVD would work. No such luck - we had the same problem as half of the people who purchased this item. I will be returning this and intend on complaining to Disney about selling a defective product. Also, Amazon should be ashamed for continuing to sell this DVD, as they obviously know it is defective and only works for some people. There is absolutely no reason that it shouldn't work for newer DVD players.

DO NOT BUY. Chances are more than likely that it won't work for you.",1392940800,6,815,4.54421768707483

Even if the DVD isn't on Fast Play and I have it set to go to the Main Menu, the movie won't play when I select to either have the movie play from the beginning or try to have it start on a different chapter.

I had one copy of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse: Space Adventure--when that didn't work I returned it for a different one. The second one did exactly the same thing. The only explanation is there's something wrong with the coding on the DVD.

We watch a lot of different Disney DVDs and other Mickey Mouse Clubhouse DVDs. This is the first one I've had a problem with.",1347494400,,775,4.258503401360544
4595290,2,B0057FGCMS,"Son just received this as a gift, but it would not play on his DVD player. On further exploration it appears to be an issue with the portable DVD player.

Very frustrating.

Obviously, if you don't care about the ability to play on a portable player, you would rate this higher, but that is a pretty big deal for us. I see from another review that this is a common problem with this DVD, so it is going back unfortunately.",1338249600,,753,5.491379310344827
