Don't believe what you see in this video for Gospel Truth, there are a lot of things being said about them that is not true . . .if Evangeline Griego was so concern about the Brothers being a cult then why is she making money off of this video . . .? The brothers are New Monastic Friars, evangelical believers in the Way of Christ/Yeshua, they are mendicants, and live with what they can carry to the Glory of God, Hodos . . .Mark 16:15 the Great Commision is not the Great Suggestion, Repent for your sins are many . . .Romans 10:9-10  p.s. Allot of people dumpster dive, but no one calls them garbage eaters . . .Brother Jim is just running a church, most churches have Pastors over them . . .also a lot of the brothers are married, yes there are things that set the Brothers  apart from other Confessing Christians, they are New Monastic's and have a different calling then most Confessing Christians . . .Yeshua was the one that said to give everything up . . .it's what we call mendicant living, New Monastic Friars are
 men and women living a intentional lifestyle for Yeshua . . .the brothers are not a Cult, but you just might be . . .
Brother Roberts died last year . . .he was a righteous man . . .you need to repent and make Jesus the Lord of your lifes. . .in Yeshua's name!",1466640000,,1657,4.20125786163522
8642976,3,B00IKCP906,Hard to get info on this cult so this is a great documentary.  It's not particularly interesting unless you know a bit about the cult.,1456012800,,134,4.36

8642978,5,B00IKCP906,"I have been in similar cults (NOT this one) and left those cults. This is an excellent, deeply touching DVD film about a destructive false cult similar to the cults I was in and left. It is NOT ""hate speech"" at all. My heart goes out to the desperate parents and family members and to the ex-members of this cult, and for those trapped in it's clutches. As a Believer in Jesus Christ, I have to say that this cult, like many like it, TWISTS and DISTORTS Jesus' words to alienate the cult members from their loving and caring family members! I believe all church groups should watch this DVD so they can see the difference between a pseudo-Christian cult and true Christianity. This cult does NOT represent true Christianity, and like many cults like it, they separate themselves from other Christians to an extreme. They say you ""lose your salvation"" if you leave the cult, which is a LIE. Non-Christians should also see this DVD, for general education on destructive cults.",1454976000,2,974,4.6686046511627906

This was not just entertaining, it was an informed, emotional documentary with depth, and clarity about what cults do, and the effect they have on individuals in American society.",1400284800,6,312,5.019230769230769
