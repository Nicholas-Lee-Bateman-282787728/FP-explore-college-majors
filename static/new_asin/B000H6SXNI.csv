2629489,5,B000H6SXNI,"I've bought many highlight DVDs from NFL films and rarely has it lived up to my expectations.  This is without a doubt the best NFL highlight DVD I've ever bought.  Each section deals with a different subject.  My personal favorite is ""Intimidators"" which deals with the meanest, baddest, hardest hitting players of all time making some of the meanest, baddest, hardest hits of all time.  For a real treat watch Bednarik take Gifford's head off in slow mo.

As a BALTIMORE Colt fan it was great to see the bits on Mackey, Moore, Unitas, etc.  The clip of Mackey running over 10 guys on the way to the end zone is included here and I've only seen that on 1 other DVD.  The clips of Sayers are priceless but all the great running backs are here.  There's also a great part where they ask players to name the best play of their careers and then show those plays in slow mo.  If there is an NFL films worthy of 5 stars this is it.",1174694400,62,926,4.275862068965517

2629610,2,B000H6SXNI,"It was produced in 2006, this should have been in HD. It's probably worth $5 I paid, but I should have read more closely that it's just in 4:3 aspect. It's like watching the NFL on an old recorded VHS.",1313712000,,201,4.05

2629612,4,B000H6SXNI,"The DVD was very interesting, but is missing some key players and information.  Also, I expected a bonus feature or something where you could examine statistics and player bios.  That was not present.

However, if you are looking to start an NFL Films collection you should certainly get this DVD.  Only steer clear if you have multiple others as it will be a repeat of a lot of information/highlights",1271289600,,401,4.768115942028985
2629623,4,B000H6SXNI,"Even though I bought this item a few months back it is still a nice, inspirational and motivational DVD to watch. I am so happy that they showed Barry Sanders who was my inspiration as a teenager. And how can anyone forget that graceful catch by Lynn Swann. This DVD brings you in categories of hall of famers from the past and the players who would be inducted in the future. Although I enjoyed the Greatest Superbowl DVD a little more, this DVD is a must for all NFL fans. The only disappointment some people may have is not seeing current stars like Peyton Manning and Tom Brady on this DVD.",1270771200,2,594,4.36036036036036

2629625,4,B000H6SXNI,"For fans of the current National Football League, which is now far and away the most popular professional sporting league in American history, it is often difficult to imagine a time when not every game (or any game) was on TV, and not every second was scrutinized by round-the-clock media coverage.  This DVD takes fans back to a simpler time and gives a nice little history lesson on some of the players, coaches, and personalities that paved the way for the success the league enjoys today.

Though technically out to document the ""greatest NFL players and coaches"", this DVD in all actuality focuses primarily on players from the 1950s, 60s, and 70s (or even earlier) and gives them their ""fair due"" in an age when fans often times don't care about the rich history of the game.  Though I knew most of the names, it was still interesting to put a face to them, see them in action and hear their thoughts about playing the game they loved.  Names like Red Grange, Jim Brown, Otto Graham, and Gale Sayers may not resonate with young fans, but this program shows how truly important they were in terms of popularizing televised football.

Usually, it is only baseball that gets a good reputation for having a rich, vibrant history dating back many, many years, but this show proves that football has an interesting past of its own.  Thus, I would recommend this DVD to any football-lovers out there.  Older fans will become awash in nostalgia, while younger viewers will be treated to a history lesson about the game they currently obsess over.",1264550400,14,1545,4.721189591078067

2629628,4,B000H6SXNI,I purchased this video for my 11 year old son who is totally obsessed with football. He absolutely loves it. He was introduced to some veteran NFL players and coaches and he got a big kick out of seeing how far football has evolved over the years. This is a must have for any football fan!,1230422400,,289,4.178571428571429
2629629,5,B000H6SXNI,"Most of these turn out to be disappointing but not so with this one. It was done very well and will not let you down. Buy it, you will be glad you did. Buy two, give one to a friend.",1230076800,,182,3.575
2629630,5,B000H6SXNI,"Wow.  If you like football and want to learn a lot, get this DVD.  It is long and will provide you with a great education on the early days of the NFL.  Most of the players and coaches I either saw or knew of; some I had never heard of.  The old films were neat and added a lot.  This is a must for true diehard NFL fans.
