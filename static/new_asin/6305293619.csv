1007947,5,6305293619,"I've been trying to get my hands on this movie for a long time. My teacher told me that he saw it 23 years ago and loved the training scenes. I didn't know which Master Killer it was though so I ended up buying ""36 Chambers"", ""The Master Killer Trilogy"", and ""Return to 36 Chambers"" before finally getting it right. IT WAS WORTH IT.

The quality is surprisingly good, Chia Hui Liu is at his best, and the storyline isn't the typical revenge story you've seen a thousand times (well not entirely anyway).

What I love about this movie is that it shows the protagonist overcoming real mental and physical obstacles along the martial way with great dedication and patience thus bettering himself and contributing to the art. Fantastic.",1147910400,4,732,4.666666666666667
1007948,5,6305293619,"Firstly, this is the ""36th Chamber of Shaolin"", now for the rest.

There is something noble about fighting with bare hands or with olden day weapons (like the sword, spear, bow and arrow etc.). It is that the actual human spirit is involved in their mastery (as opposed to children sporting a gun in a threatening way). The movie talks about this human endeavour, how discipline can take man to higher realms of self mastery.

Firstly it is clear that the mind is most important for martial arts (if you see the old man pushing the hero of the movie from many meters away). Secondly, the movie talks about bringing archaic knowledge to all sections of society for its enrichment, like starting a 36th Chamber.

I watched this movie in my school when I was in my 8th or 9th standard. There was an aura of greatness in the protagonist which I never forgot. I still see greatness in the movie, I would want to watch it many times. It reminds me that human endeavour and discipline would make us great men, nobility and faith would make us Shaolins, or Devas (gods) as my upringing would have me to believe.",1144627200,3,1103,4.505

1008019,5,6305293619,"Considered one of the finest martial arts films ever made, Shaolin Master Killer stars popular old school kung fu badass Chia Hui (Gordon) Liu as San Te, a young man who becomes involved in the struggle against the malevolent Manchus, seditious anti-Ching patriots. Steered by Ho Kuang-han, the Manchus have surreptitiously set up a headquarters in Canton. When his family is murdered for being linked with rebels, San Tse narrowly escapes and eventually makes his way to the Shaolin monastery. Here he requests to stay and learn the fighting techniques of the Shaolin, and after brief discussion among the elders, he is allowed to remain.

 The better part of the film is dedicated to the painstaking and exhaustive training San Te undergoes. San Te hones his skills over several years, and the tasks he must complete are within an arduous, and sometimes torturous, series of thirty-five distinct chambers (or phases) of instruction - ordeals intended to develop strength and agility. San Te?s initial failures are amusing (such as attempting in vain to balance on bound wooden logs in the water while also trying to eat lunch from a bowl), but when he finally begins to grasp the Shaolin techniques, he progresses past the other pupils and becomes the greatest student the temple has ever seen. Though there are only thirty-five chambers, Liu's character argues for the creation of a new one. This ""36th chamber"" in the temple would teach Shaolin kung fu to the general population so that they might effectively fight the Manchus. This idea doesn?t go over at all, and San Te is sent back into the world as a beggar monk. However, San Te has already learned what he needs in order to whip some severe amounts of Manchu ass.

 Shaolin Master Killer is the epitome of the classic post-Bruce Lee kung fu flick. While background story concerns revenge, the true focus of the film is San Te?s training at the Shaolin temple. These sequences were under the direction of Lau Kar Leung (who also directed Jackie Chan in Drunken Master 2), and their scope and perfection take martial arts filmmaking to new heights. The training scenes not only serve the purpose of furthering the story, but also allow the viewer to learn about and care for the protagonist before the climactic showdown. There aren't as many fights as one might expect from a Shaw Brothers film, but this does not detract from the overall story in the least. As a matter of fact, the occasionally languorous pace helps to enhance the mood of the film as a whole.

 Gordon Liu was a mainstay for more than a decade at legendary Shaw Brothers studio in Hong Kong. His first major role was in director Chang Cheh's Shaolin Martial Arts. The success of Shaolin Master Killer (the original title was 36th Chamber of Shaolin) propelled him to stardom. Liu can be seen in the high-profile role of Pai Mei in Kill Bill: Vol. 2, and in Kill Bill: Vol. 1 as the gangster Johnny Mo - dual roles in the same film showing the esteem Quentin Tarantino holds for this veteran actor.

 Shaolin Master Killer is dubbed in that oft-maligned and mocked kung fu movie manner (the lips don?t match the mouth), but most of the translation seems to be precise. The choreography is superlative and demonstrates why Liu is inarguably one of cinema?s greatest martial arts stars. Better than Bruce Lee? Well, that?s a fan-boy debate for another time and place. Shaolin Master Killer is definitely not-to-be-missed by kung fu, cult film, and action flick aficionados for any reason.",1090540800,29,3516,4.82890365448505

Boy, I was truely inspired by this film as a child, leading the way for my pre-training in White Tiger. I set up head bags, long poles, and held my head still while watching tennis. While working, I carried things arms length and even tried to jump over floating things by running atop them. I have yet to see another flick that shows off the skills of such an artist as Mr Liu. His fight scene with master yul-ya, using 3 sec staff, is incredible to slow down and watch. I cant even tell you how many times I did this with the night group fight. there are no cuts, special effects, or fast blurred scenes, only coreagraphed moves that no one less than Mr Liu could perform...dont believe me?..try it!",1082592000,2,861,4.421383647798742
1008022,5,6305293619,"Ever wondered how you can become a master @ The Shaolin Temple?
This film shows wonderful training sequences.  They were so interesting, I found myself eagerly awaiting to see the next chamber, and what San Te would learn next.  You really root for him through the movie.  One of the coolest things about Hong Kong cinema is that they show how the hero has learned from the training.  While fighting, San Te will use what he has learned to win.  Something that American cinema has yet to pick up on(At least with hand to hand combat).
The action:  Due to the fact that it was done by Lau Kar Liang(Lau something), means artistic bliss.  The Lau brothers then went on to do Shaolin Drunken Monk, Warrior From Shaolin, and Fists And Guts.  These films are a continuation of the character San Te.  Although, sadly, they are not up to par with the energy of the film ""Master Killer"" as a whole, the action of these other three San Te movies is just a little more enjoyable, and there's more of it.
Like other reviews have stated, this is a movie for non-kung fu fans as well.  For me, this is a favorite, and if dust shall gather on top of the case of this DVD, it won't be there for long.... Peace.",1070755200,2,1195,4.342342342342342

Master Killer has an excellent story and the fighting sequences are enthrawling.  However, the main reason I love this movie is because of the training scenes within the Shaolin Temple.  It was the aspect of the movie that captivated me when I first saw it years ago.  Gorden Liu is the perfect fit for the role.  Purchase this film if you don't have it.  You won't be upset.",1054252800,,621,4.356521739130435
1008069,5,6305293619,"In the UK this goes under the title '36 Chambers of Shaolin' which is a pretty good description of the film. A young man flees his local village after the Manchu take over, and stows away into the Shaolin Temple. The monks take pity on him and he slowly begins a rigorous training programme at the different chambers of the temple- each one designed to strengthen individual parts of the body.
The film excels in showing us his dedicated training as he progresses through these chambers, learning to fight like a Shaolin monk.
He asks for a new chamber to be created - a '36th Chamber' whereby he can train outsiders in the skills of Shaolin kung fu but is banned from the Temple for the idea. He inevitably goes back to his own village to seek vengeance on those that killed his family.
The film is both absorbing and exciting and also endlessly watchable. It's a great shame that it's not available on DVD either in the US or UK, but it's a definite must-have for any kung fu fan, seasoned or otherwise.",1050537600,4,1005,4.467391304347826
1008070,4,6305293619,"This is a great old school kung-fu flick. It's a little slow at the beginning (hence my 4 stars instead of 5) but by the halfway point you just can't take your eyes off the tv. Excellent training sequences, some of the best I've ever seen anywhere. And by the end of the movie, Gordon Liu is a solid fighter. His kung-fu is excellent and there is some good history in the shaolin training methods. There could have been a little more in the fight scene department, but definetly a classic for the training scenes alone. The fight scenes are great, it's just that they are a little short. Gordon Liu has become one of my favorite martial artists and if you really want to see him shine, pick up: ""Fists of the White Lotus"" and ""Shaolin Challenges Ninja"" 5 stars each and 2 of the best kung-fu movies ever.

This movie started all the Shaolin monk training movies. You see how this hard headed boy grows up to be a well disciplined Shaolin monk. Even adding a chamber to the Shaolin Temple. This was actually the second movie I got in my collection. If you have not seen this one rent it. But I suggest you buy it for it is a very entertaining movie.,1005177600,,468,4.329545454545454
1008072,5,6305293619,"Amazing film.  One of the few I've seen that shows the training required to be a Shaolin Master.  Incredible storyline, maybe cliche, but captivating, nonetheless.  Amazing fight scenes, and it was really cool to see how training exercises, that were seemingly unrelated to fighting, tied into the Shaolin style.

1008073,4,6305293619,"A word about my rating:  the film easily merits four stars (and not five only because it stumbles a bit at the end), but the video is disappointing and the sound occasionally exasperating.  The DVD quality deserves three stars -- at best.  Since these faults are present in the 25-year-old source, however, and are not the fault of Crash Cinema, I decided they should not detract from the final rating.
This is probably the best Shaw Bros. film, and even now is ranked in the Top Five for many gong fu aficionados.  The cliches are all there, but this is the one that created them:  revenge motivation, extensive training scenes, the student's epiphany leading to martial arts mastery, and final reckoning.  Master Killer ranges from entertaining to riveting, and it should appeal to any open-minded filmgoer (willing to put up with washed-out colors and occasional crackle in the sound).
I've enjoyed other Shaw Bros. movies from the '70s, fare like Chinese Super Ninjas and Kid With the Golden Arm.  I've enjoyed those despite their faults, however, and to an extent because of them.  Master Killer, on the other hand, features a well-developed story (based on historical figures), credible acting, fast-paced but believable action, and a general level of sophistication that surprised me on my first viewing.  I highly recommend it -- not only to gong fu movie devotees, but to any movie fan looking for an enjoyable action film from a time when such movies still featured characters and story.",994204800,,1497,4.956

1008143,4,6305293619,"Dude, I was so stoked when I saw this was available on DVD!  I remember staying up late in the mid-eighties to catch this flick on Kung-Fu Theater.  The original title was ""Master Killer"".  Why they decided to add ""Shaolin"" to the DVD release title is beyond me.  I wasn't even sure it was the same movie when I ordered it, but when I saw the opening credits I knew I had struck gold!  It was a stand out then and still is today.  All of the fighting sequences are awesome, and the training sequences will probably never be matched.  The acting, directing, cinematography, and fight choreography are all first rate.  This Kung-Fu movie has it all!  I don't understand why Gordon Liu is not widely recognized as one of the greats.  His speed and skill are as impressive as anyone around today.  I'm really looking forward to more of his movies being released on DVD.  Don't expect high-flying Hong Kong action; this is strictly old school Shaolin ass-kicking action.  The down side: I would have given this DVD 5 stars except for one thing:  Damage to the original print used to make this DVD is pretty bad in some places; with dirt and ""hair"" on the frames, and some of the night scenes a little too dark because of the age of the print.  It does not interfere with the action sequences, and was only really distracting two times throughout the entire film.  The owner of the distribution rights to this movie needs do it justice and have it digitally remastered frame by frame.  A classic like this should be cleaned up and released as beautiful as the day it graced the screen.  The sound for the dailogue is a little too soft in a few places, but overall it's okey and the musical score is very good.  The punching and kicking sounds don't suffer one bit. The ""bonus feature"" interview with an actual 34th generation Shaolin monk was boring and totally worthless- skip streight to the movie.  I HIGHLY recomend this DVD for any Kung Fu movie lover.  You won't be disappointed.  With a running time of an hour and 55 minutes this Kung-Fu masterpiece is worth every penny.",984528000,36,2073,4.53099730458221

The story line is a bit hokey but the martial arts fighting scenes more than make up for it.  The training scenes at the Shaolin temple in the 35 Chambers are amazing.  Liu truly does a fantastic job.  However, the final fight between Liu and the Manchu general is rather short especially the ending.  The transfer is not good but you can deal with it.  The sound is the real atrocity here, at times you really can't hear anything the characters are saying and even when you can the track is so low that you have to blast your tv.

The scenes in the Shaolin Temple alone are more than worth  the price of the video.  The training methods, although dramatized, give a  feel for the steadfastness of Shaolin training, and display the creativity  of the monks in developing unique training methods.
The traditional one  man against an army, can be forgiven as a stylistic tool of the Chinese  cinema, but the scenes are beutifully staged and the choreography for the  duels within Shaolin are some of the best ever seen.

Liu flees to the Shaolin Temple, where he becomes a monk, adopts the name ""San Te"", and learns the secrets of Shaolin kung-fu (because the dubbing is weak, the character's pre-Shaolin name is difficult to make out). This is when the movie shines! The training sequences, though dramatized at times, are the most amazing ever caught on film and highlight the excruciating pain the monks endure. Seven years later, San Te leaves the Temple and returns to his old village to take revenge on the Manchus.

Unlike many HK martial arts films, this one does not have ""wire-fu"" and ridiculous side antics and comedy that distract from the plot. The fighting sequences are fast, hard, and clean- pure old school heaven! The story and dialogue are simple; the dubbing could use improvement, but one should understand most of the words. Pay close attention to the skills San Te learns at Shaolin, and then seeing them applied when San Te battles the Manchus! When you se this, you really appreciate the attention to detail that the makers of the film put forth.

Overall, a gem of a movie. They don't make them like this anymore!!",1318982400,,1485,4.912350597609562
