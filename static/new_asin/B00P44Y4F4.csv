6787464,5,B00P44Y4F4,"As a fan of Nick Cave, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's an interesting peek inside (what he wants to show as) his life. I think it's a great addition to any Nick Cave collection. It's also a fascinating look inside the creative process. Loaded with thought-provoking quotes, and more humor than one might expect. I think the movie itself is a niche or cult market item more than a mass-appeal item.

The DVD set includes cut scenes and outtakes, some of which are quite funny. The DVD liner notes include a copy of part of Nick Cave's personal journal. (I'm not sure why the listings for this DVD don't include that information.)",1422144000,5,634,4.610619469026549

6787466,5,B00P44Y4F4,"This is a great film. Even if you are not a Nick Cave fan. You can gain much insight of a musical genius. Some of the best parts are the scenes with the unlikely duo of Nick and Kylie Minogue. Notice: A three disc version of this exists with outtakes,commentary,and performances. It is a numbered limited edition from the Nick Cave website.",1421366400,2,340,4.5

6787468,5,B00P44Y4F4,"Nick Cave goes through his most recent of 20,000 Days on Earth... he fictionalizes his 20,001st for us the voyeur wondering what his life is like.  And it's glorious.  He is just want you anticipate.  An artist, a father, a husband.... it's all there on the screen for you to see what he and the filmmakers want us to see.  Note the first few minutes of the film go through some of the highlights of his earlier triumphs... worth seeing and hitting the pause button for.  We saw this in the theater upon it's release and couldn't wait for the dvd.",1419724800,3,547,4.376237623762377

6787470,2,B00P44Y4F4,"I'm finding it bizarre, with the release of this film, that it's a foregone conclusion, if you like Nick Cave, you'll love this documentary. I understand the universal drooling from critics, tracing to their endless pursuit of what's-hot-and-what's-not, but there are plenty others who actually listen to Nick Cave's music intensely and often, finding this documentary weirdly conventional, over-produced, sterile, and violative of any biographical trace of punk from the balladeer's past. From the ten-point lighting kit at the mock psychotherapy session, to the jib floating the camera around those armchairs, to the awkward conversations that were conceptually improvised but fundamentally staged, this film is the equivalent of a corporate video for an annual shareholder's meeting, or a broadcast network reality television show egging for market share. Will someone else speak up too, please? Nick Cave is one of the great multi-disciplinary artists of our time, and his extraordinary talents are scurrying around the festival circuit for this film at the expense of what he could be creating quietly at home: a new album, a new screenplay, a new film score, a new novel.",1418515200,10,1177,5.4021739130434785
6787471,5,B00P44Y4F4,"I am obsessed with Nick Cave, and this movie met every expectation.  Even if you're not a Nick Cave fan, it's a brilliant movie that delves into the mind of an amazingly creative person.  See it!",1418169600,9,195,4.388888888888889
6787472,5,B00P44Y4F4,"I was lucky enough to see Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds live... this film is a beautiful glimpse into the process of songwriting, myth and memory.  If you are a fan, this is a must own!",1417219200,6,183,3.945945945945946
6787473,5,B00P44Y4F4,"This is not your typical cut and paste, by the numbers music documentary.  In fact, it's not really much of a documentary at all, though it has documentary elements, as stated in the description. It's more like a painting.  It's an artistic interpretation of Nick Cave, filled with his philosophy of his own existence.  You don't have to be Nick Cave fan to like this, but it helps.  A lot of the film has to do with building on the mythology of an artist rather than a bland biographical portrait.  Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard use a number of techniques to build on this idea.  Nick Cave's excellent voice overs are laced with the grandiose drama of his own mythology.  If you have read Cave's narrative stories or heard his excellent lecture ""The Secret Life of the Love Song,"" Cave's voice overs are in the same vein.  Also of note are how Pollard and Forsyth frame the picture.  The beginning is a montage of Cave's performances on old TVs, while the film is also interspersed with long takes of Cave walking, driving, as well as close ups and cut aways usually reserved for straight narrative works.  It creates a dramatic feel.  Cave's writing also says a lot about process and, for a writer, can be quite inspiring.

The blu ray will be a treat for fans.  There are more performances included, including some new takes on Your Funeral My Trial and Stranger than Kindness.  There's also an anecdote about a Nick Cave statue which Cave was going to have in his hometown.  The deleted scenes are all great, but also a testament to how great the filmmakers are, as the editing is part of what made this film so good.  There's a reason many of the scenes were cut, but they are still entertaining on their own.

I'll also add that this film is endlessly quotable.  Cave has a lot to say about the craft of writing.",1416700800,15,1818,4.507645259938838

6787477,1,B00P44Y4F4,"In the directors commentary bonus footage the director says that the film was based on what they knew they didn't want to film. That about sums up the many problems of this mess of a film. Where do I begin? The interviewer come across as so self-important that it is almost laughable; and the director focuses more on him, than Cave himself! Shots throughout the film are dark and incoherent.  A potentially insightful portion of the film where they go through old photographs of Caves past is wasted. You can barely make out the photos as they are projected on a wall and shot at severe angles, and there is no real exploration, just cursory comments by Cave. There are many staged scenes of Cave driving a car while talking to people and you learn nothing about him or the people hes talking to: I was anticipating some interesting insights about the Bad Seeds Blixa Bargeld  after Cave said his musicality blew him a away and there was nothing, nothing about the music the created, or anything about Barfeld. There is very little of Caves music in the film. At the end they play the entirety of Jubilee Street. That few minutes says more about the man and his music than the whole rest of the film. I don't understand why the makers of this documentary didn't get that; its about the music.",1426464000,3,1293,4.545064377682404

6787482,5,B00P44Y4F4,"I must admit I am a big Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds fan.  I saw this in the movie theater and then bought the DVD so yes I liked it a lot.  If you are a big fan just get it.  This review is for others who might be interested who aren't huge fans.  If you have never heard of Nick Cave you should probably listen to some of his music and see if you like it or can at least tolerate it first before you watch it.  Nick Cave is very polarizing.  In the theater two people walked out half way through but the other 50 or so people stayed to the last credit.  The movie is an unusual documentary with several staged scenes that put Nick Cave in situations he has to ad lib his real thoughts and feelings.  Some great insight as to what makes him tick and how he goes about writing and composing songs and music.  He has some nice moments ""in his black Jag"" with a former band member, a female singer he was on top of the pops with and an actor friend.  I would have liked to have seen Mick Harvey included.  His interactions with Warren Ellis are very nice to see.  The two have worked to together so much in the past few years that they have had more lunches together then with their wives.  Time is spent on some of the recording sessions for their latest album and then we get to see a few songs performed live in rehearsal as well as live in concert.  There is a brief scene where he is eating pizza with his kids and you would not be surprised they are watch Scarface and that very famous bit that everyone repeats.  Even though the scenes are simple the lighting and cinematography are excellent.  I also like the way it is edited.  The movie has a good pace and moves on just before you think it might be spending too much time on one scene.  The last song performed is Jubilee Street which I though was OK on the album but much better live.  The song builds rapidly and you can see Nick Cave jump about and do what he does that makes him one of the best live performers around but what makes it even better is that almost seamlessly his image flashes back and forth through time to other live performances all the way back to when he was in the the Birthday Party.  By now I have the volume up to ten and am ready to rock out for a very long time but alas to movie has to come to an end.  There are some bonus scenes on the DVD and you will be happy to know there is a great new live performance of Where the Wild Roses Grow with Kylie Minogue.  So far this movie has won 5 awards and is nominated for many more.  If I have convinced you to go see it then go ahead.  You will not be disappointed.",1422316800,7,2599,4.011673151750973

This creation is poetry, music, life, love, remorse, hope, angst, humor and ennui.  It's Nick Cave -- or perhaps Nick Cave as he would have us see him, I suppose.
