8285258,5,B001BYDKVU,"Not much to say, except that I love this series. How clever to have these episodes to fall back on when I am done with gritty, gruesome, and depressing.",1410220800,,152,4.275862068965517
8285259,5,B001BYDKVU,"My wife and I just love Summer Wine. It belongs in that rare category where it can be watched by ALL the family without it causing offense due to profanity or sexual innuendo, and it's humor is timeless as it suspends belief and is pure escapism with the silly but hilarious escapades of its colorful characters. One of the finest comedy series ever made that we never tire of watching. The scenery of Holmfirth is just lovely too.",1397260800,,431,4.538461538461538

8285261,5,B001BYDKVU,"Have not watched the entire series.  Have watched Last of the Summer wine wil in England and We thouroughly enjoyed it.  There is no real plot, jsut some elderly men living and dreaming.  Excellent series.  Would recomment it to anyone who understands English humor",1333843200,,265,4.954545454545454
