7158250,5,B00X4TV9RC,"Finally, Selina is at the ""The Buck Stops Here"" desk. For her first big speech there are issues with the teleprompter, leading to some presidential bebop... heads will roll. A strong season premiere that leads to a strong season: Jonah is sexually harassed, the First Daughter has a public image problem, Selina picks a Veep of her own, and the gang does time at the airport in Tehran.

Providing more than one LOL per minute (lol/m), Veep is essentially the only serial comedy worth my time. Some folks appear to be wondering how much mileage can be had from this scenario before it gets old, but people probably wondered the same thing about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-West-Wing/dp/B000HC2LI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The West Wing</a>. Veep has as many seasons ahead of it as Julia Louis-Dreyfus is willing to do.

7158271,5,B00X4TV9RC,"An explosive Season!  Powerful drama not seen since Watergate.  Like the New England Patriots, VEEP, has had in its past a weak Season -- that being Season 2.  But also like the Patriots, after watching all of Season 4, one gets the feeling that VEEP is in the makings of a DYNASTY.  There are not many programs in the media that bring tears to one's eyes these days -- at least for their excellence.  One does cry at the conclusion of VEEP's 4th Season.  It has a triumph of humanity about it.  We are fortunate that Season 5 is just being released now on DVD and that Season 6 is on the verge of being broadcast in a month or so.",1487721600,,631,4.1652892561983474

I think she knows this and it shows. The fact that I can never pick my favorite line or episode says it all. However, Mike's line of something like ""it's like math prison and. They r raping me with numbers"", Kevin Dunn's line of ""who givesafuckistan""  comes to mind. Also, the intern's testimony was as almost too funny.  Gary is the best for Serena.

With the stakes for Selina and her team higher than ever before, she must still run for election, and over the course of the seasons 10 episodes they will grapple with how to make her seem presidential.

7158398,5,B00X4TV9RC,"hello,
  well, this is the last season of veep that is on amazon and until season 5 shows up soon, we will get our dreyfus comedy elsewhere.  this season started off with safe for work scenes.  but as the season moved along. back came the nsfw language and short inenudos.  it ended up with a bang, so no spoiler alert here.  well played by all of the actors and if real politics is anywhere near the hearing scenes, what a useless waste of taxpayers money on trivial stuff... so far, this series gets a 5 star just for the laughs.",1465862400,,531,4.26
7158399,5,B00X4TV9RC,"Smart, satirical and silly all wrapped into one fast-paced package, with a capable cast who play their roles to the hilt.  There is so much rapid-fire, humor-laced dialogue that I find I need to watch each episode twice in a row to be able to process every bit of it fully.  And it is always just as entertaining, if not more so, upon second viewing.

This season covers former veep Selina Meyer's (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) eight-month term as first woman president.  In addition to being in campaign mode seeking a first full term, these ten episodes have her and her staff engaged in non-stop damage control due to gaffes and burgeoning ethics scandals.  Members of her staff are scapegoated, and the hilarious ""Testimony"" episode has them all appearing as witnesses before a Senate investigating committee.

Watch for campaign manager Amy's (Anna Chlumsky) epic meltdown scene, the intensity-level of which may have hit a record high for an American sitcom.  And while mentioning the exceptional, I know we have never seen any supporting guest actor (Patton Oswalt, in this case) with such a ""hands-on"" approach, shall we say, as the new veep's top aide.

If there is one minor annoyance I have with the dialogue (no, it's not all the potty-mouthed stuff, which by many accounts is realistic), it's that it is occasionally contorted for the sake of overly clever wordplay, at which moments we are clearly hearing the writers' voices more than the characters'.

High-quality TV; high-quality two-disc DVD set (but with no audio commentaries this season; a few deleted scenes per episode, but that's it).",1465776000,,1601,5.011320754716981

7158423,5,B00X4TV9RC,"VEEP: The Complete Fourth Season opens with Selina Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) having ascended to the presidency of the United States. The first episode of the season, Joint Session, features Selina making her first major speech to Congress, with her staff trying to make sense of what her message is. Meanwhile, Gary (Tony Hale) is concerned about his limited access to Selina. Jonah (Timothy Simons) is wary of the new vice presidents Chief of Staff and Amy (Anna Chlumsky) has a meeting with ruthless political operative Bill Ericsson (Diedrich Bader).

Other episodes deal with a state dinner for the Israeli prime minister as Gary gets carried away planning it; a data breach at the White House; Amy being annoyed by the presidents new adviser, whos helping Catherine with her First Daughter speech; an awkward pancake fundraiser breakfast; a bout of the flu that sidelines Selina; and a key bill thats headed for failure.

The writing seems to get better every season, with jokes both broad and subtle and a terrific ensemble that make VEEP one of the funniest shows on TV. In addition to being hilarious, it neatly skewers Beltway politics, private and public faces of politicians, and the never-ending series of deals and meetings  some vital, others trivial  that occupy Selina and her staff.

The sole bonus feature on the 2-disc Blu-ray release is a series of deleted scenes.",1460851200,,1386,5.034934497816594

7158495,5,B00X4TV9RC,"Veep is now approaching the level of Curb Your Enthusiasm in terms of being so funny that it's physically painful. And like Larry David, JL Dreyfus is showing herself willing to make her character intensely unlikable in the service of high comedy. The relationship with her daughter is truly painful to watch (in a comedic genius type of way). If you haven't seen them - the BBC shows In The Loop and The Thick of It are produced by the same team - with the same idea - hilariously corrupt and rude politicos - but in the UK. In fact, the actress who plays Amy is in one of them.",1443139200,2,579,4.2727272727272725

7158526,5,B00X4TV9RC,"Julia L-D does my favorite season of VEEP so far here. She is President this season but it will only be for a very short while as she is up for reelection very shortly. Her staff, as usual, is always on the edge of disaster in handling both her presidency and her reelection campaign. Her most competent staff member is her secretary.

Every season there has been a surprise guest star. This season it is Hugh Laurie from ""House."" He comes in about half way through until the end and is terrific. Many viewers don't know he spent most of his acting life as a comedic actor before he got ""House."" So he is up to handling the quicksilver comedy of Julia L-D.

I first became a fan of Julia's on SEINFELD. There was nothing inept about her character on that show. However, she got to really go to town on the characteristics of shallow and self absorbed. No one will ever forget her yelling at the ""Soup Nazi"", ""Next!"" as she finally got the upper hand with him.

Thus, VEEP always falls to her as to whether it will make it or not as a tv show. She is VEEP. Her medium has always been tv. She has done movies and been ok but they never seem to work out long range for her like tv does. Lucille Ball had a similar history in films vs. tv as did Mary Tyler Moore. TV is definitely more tolerant of the aging woman and all three comic actors have richly benefitted from that perspective.

As for her staff, Gary is my next favorite. He is the one most devoted to her. He has such huge screw up potential, which he realizes regularly. He and Selina even square off for a heck of a fight this season. But they back down after a sharp exchange because no one else is as devoted to either of them.

I also watched the English series upon which this was based. They are very different even though they are both political satires about the ineptness of politicians always trying to satisfy their fickle voters.  I like both series and recommend both series.",1438560000,,1946,4.30327868852459
7158527,4,B00X4TV9RC,"Very good and entertaining, although I'm disappointed that their liberal bias is starting to show up, specially those silly potshots at Fox News. It's also interesting that the characters will interview with CNN and MSNBC, but never Fox. That's not realistic, even Obama and Hillary Clinton have been interviewed by Bill O'Reilly, and if you were running for president, you would want his audience, he is #1 in cable news after all. But I guess the writers can't help themselves.

I do look forward to season 5, even if it will have no basis in reality since (SPOILER ALERT) no election in American history has ever ended up with a tie. The VP becoming president and the president losing his job? That's the cliffhanger they gave us in the last episode.",1438473600,,753,4.748091603053435

In this season Selina has become president (the real president resigned) and she and her bumbling crew of staffers, family and hangers-on inhabit the West Wing with predictable results.  Hugh Laurie joins the cast as the new veep and does his usual fine job.  This season follows Selina's run for re-election to keep the job as president.  The twist at the end of the final show actually made me laugh out loud.  Great show!",1438214400,6,538,4.621052631578947
