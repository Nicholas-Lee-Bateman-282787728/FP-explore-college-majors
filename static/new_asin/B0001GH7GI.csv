1998558,3,B0001GH7GI,"This is not really a movie.

It is a repackaged TV sitcom from the mid 70s called ""Dusty's Trail"".  4 episodes strung together without a laugh track.

This may make it difficult to watch for most people, because the laugh track helps a mediocre sitcom like this one.  That's why it was invented in 1949.

It is pretty bad but it does feature Bob Denver still doing his mugging for the camera a la Gilligan and Maynard G. Krebs.

Plenty of physical comedy.  Pretty cornball but entertaining in a nostalgic sort of way.

Rated G.  Tame enough for children and Christians.

There are several of these with different box art...don't know if they are the same 4 episodes in the different boxes that are for sale today on Amazon.",1279756800,3,723,4.534883720930233

1998562,1,B0001GH7GI,"The movie called THE WACKIEST WAGON TRAIN IN THE WEST is actually a clumsily edited together collection of four episodes of Bob Denver's 1970s TV show, ""Dusty's Trail"".  The creators of this DVD were obviously trying to cash in on the popularity of Gilligan's Island.  The back cover mentions the word ""Gilligan"" no less than five times.  This is not a surprise, given that ""Dusty's Trail"" itself simply took the premise and characters of ""Gilligan's Island"" and transplanted them into the Old West.

Instead of seven modern castaways, we have seven Nineteenth Century prospectors taking a less-than-direct route from St. Louis to California.  The characters themselves have a precise isomorphic relationship to their ""Gilligan's Island"" counterparts.  Bob Denver plays Dusty, who's clumsy, fumbling, and always managing to get everyone into trouble.  Forrest Tucker (""F-Troop"") is the replacement Skipper, called the Wagonmaster, who's in charge of the party.  There's a smart guy, a rich guy (and his wife) and a simple small-town girl.  The replacement Ginger is either a saloon girl or a prostitute, depending on how charitable you're feeling.

If that's not enough for you, the Skipper keeps referring to Gilligan...  Sorry, I mean the Wagonmaster keeps referring to Dusty as his ""little pal"" instead of his ""little buddy"".

Growing up, I watched as much Nick At Nite as the next fellow.  But until I bought this DVD, I'd never even heard of ""Dusty's Trail"" before.

Odd - I thought - since Bob Denver and Forrest Tucker are well-known classic TV stars.

Then, later, not odd at all - I thought - because the episodes on this DVD are absolutely terrible.

The comparisons made to ""Gilligan's Island"" by the DVD company and by commentators on the Internet are all perfectly valid.  But they may leave a false impression on the reader.  You see, ""Gilligan's Island"" was funny.  It was silly.  It was stupid.  It was corny.  It was predictable.  But at least it made you laugh, even if you were laughing at the banality of the material.  But WACKIEST WAGONTRAIN has none of this going for it.

Now let's move on the the film itself.  When producers edit together episodes of a TV show into a feature-length production, it's interesting to note what will be used as a central theme to pull these disparate stories together.  When the Ben Murphy classic RIDING WITH DEATH was edited together from two episodes of the short-lived ""Gemini Man"", the producers based the movie around two guest-starring appearances by Jim Stafford as Buffalo Bill.  Sure it was goofy.  Sure it required an awkwardly dubbed voice over to explain why a character's facial hair suddenly changes halfway through the movie.  But at least it was somewhat coherent.

The four episodes of ""Dusty's Trail"" here have absolutely nothing to do with one another, which makes one wonder why they bothered removing the opening and closing credits from in between them.

Still, in the pursuit of ill-advised thoroughness, I'll offer a quick summary of each episode.

Act I: Let There Be Bob Denver.

The movie opens with the TV show's theme music.  The theme song tells the story of who these people are, and how they got to where they are.  Think the ""Gillian's Island"" theme, only not as catchy.

The initial epoch involves Dusty accidentally rescuing a young Native American boy from a bear.  After this genuine act of kindness, the movie spends the next half an hour or so insulting Native Americans.

Actually, it's probably not as insulting as it could possibly have been.  Although that may just be that the sight of white guys in red paint tapping their hands against their mouths, making ""Wooo-oooo-oooo!"" noises and dancing around other white guys who are tied to oversized wooden posts is something we've become deadened to in our pop culture.

Act II: Dusty Falls Off A Horse, Ad Nauseum

This second work involves Dusty finding a horse, not realizing it belongs to someone else and then being sentenced to death for the crime.  Sadly, this does not result in the death of Dusty.  Instead the plot revolves around Dusty falling off a horse, falling off a horse, falling off a horse and falling off a horse.

I'm not kidding about that.  A major subplot involves Dusty ""breaking in"" the horse.  The scenes go on and on.  You can picture it already, can't you?  If your mind's eye reveals endless footage of a stunt double wildly bouncing up and down on a real bronco with quick close-up inserts of Bob Denver on a mechanical deer, then you can safely fast-forward through this episode without missing anything.

Act III: Full Mental Drag-act

The travelers are ambushed by two dangerous bandits who demand some quality time with the second rate Ginger and the third rate Mary Ann.  Naturally they're fooled by seeing Bob Denver and Forrest Tucker in drag.  It will come as no surprise when later in the episode, these two Einsteins surrender to an army composed primarily of Bob Denver, cooking utensils and baking flour.

Act IV: Let This Be Your Last Episode!

(It was at this point that I fell into complete despair.  You see, I knew that this was a half-hour show and that the DVD box listed the running time at an hour and a half.  So I figured after three episodes I'd come to the end.  You have no idea how far down I sank into my chair when the closing credits failed to scroll upon my screen and I realized I had one more segment to endure.)

The travelers wander into an apparent ghost-town, only to get trapped inside by gun-tooting outlaws.  After some excrusiately long-winded sequences involving a donkey, explosives and disguises (unfortunately, not all at the same time), the movie shudders to a conclusion.

I don't think it's possible to describe how unbelievably tedious this movie is.  I attempted to watch this movie a second time to help writing this review, but I just couldn't get through without liberal use of the fast-forward button.  I now know why this Bob Denver vehicle rarely sees the light of day.  And, now, I'm just a little bit deader inside.",1158624000,6,6052,4.825875486381323
1998563,5,B0001GH7GI,"This unfortunate short lived 70's TV series,starring Bob Denver was much better than his other TV series ""Gilligans Island"".The late great Bob Denver also did another short lived series""The Good Guys"" 1968-70 with Herb Edelman.

8012285,2,B0001GH7GI,"RELEASED IN 1976, ""The Wackiest Wagon Train in the West"" is a compilation of four episodes of the Dusty's Trail TV series that ran for one season in 1973-1974. Producer Sherwood Schwartz tried to duplicate his success with Gilligans Island by transplanting a similar group of seven people into the wild west: The wagon master (Forrest Tucker), his little pal subordinate (Bob Denver), an educated lawyer (Bill Cort), a saloon showgirl (Jeannine Riley), a winsome schoolmarm (Lori Saunders) and a filthy rich older couple (Ivor Francis & Lynn Wood). These seven are lost in the West, separated from their wagon train, and experience various misadventures.

While the characters are different enough for the show to work, the parallels are uncomfortably too close; moreover, the writings nowhere near as good, and the show just lacks the magic of Gilligans Island. Its basically a pale imitation. Nevertheless, its worthwhile for Bob Denver fans; there are a few genuine laughs and Jeannine Riley is alluring as the showgirl (I prefer her to Ginger).

The episodes from Dustys Trail, as featured in this movie, are in order: ""Tomahawk Territory,"" ""Horse of Another Color,"" ""There is Nothing Like a Dame,"" and ""The Not So Magnificent Seven."" FYI: Only ONE of these episodes is included in The Almost Complete First (And Only) Season DVD set, which means youll have to purchase the set AND this flick if you want all the episodes.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 36 minutes. I incidentally viewed the Catcom DVD and the video quality is horrible (speaking as someone whos easy to please in that department).

The best thing about the movie was when the words came up on the screen, The End. I was SO happy it was over. After watching it, I went over to imdb & read more on the movie. I should've known but didn't that The Wackiest Wagon Train In The West was just a bunch of TV episodes strung together to make a movie. I should've gave up on it the 1st time but for some reason I gave it a 2nd chance. Fool me once, Shame on me, Fool me twice, Shame on me again",1423785600,,574,3.7131147540983607

8012294,3,B0001GH7GI,"We have this ""movie"" in a 2004 packaging (from Westlake Entertainment Group), which has a different presentation cover than the one shown here.  Many of the write-ups, including some of the DVD jackets, such as the one we have), claim this ""movie"" to be an editing of 3 episodes taken from the show ""Dusty's Trail"".  However, a careful study of the changes and plot shifts reveal it to be from 4 EPISODES, not 3.  These shows, were initially edited for their original TV network airings to run approximately 21-23 minutes, leaving time for commercials, in a full 30-minute time slot.  When all of the commercials and credits are edited out, and only one set of (newer) opening and closing credits are added, the listed 88 minutes running time for the ""movie"" works out to about 21-22 minutes per sequence, which is clearly evident in the 4 distinct changes in the story lines.  Specifically, the four episodes, in order, as used within this ""movie"", are: ""Tomahawk Territory"" (Episode 8), ""Horse Of Another Color"" (Episode 3), ""There Is Nothing Like A Dame"" (Episode 2), and ""The Not So Magnificant Seven"" (Episode 1).  We hope this helps clear up any confusion on the matter...

For the record, the show ""Dusty's Trail"" ran for only 1 season, with 26 total episodes, from 11 September 1973 through 12 March 1974.

Now, as for this DVD ""movie"" itself, we have to say that while the show surely had its own funny moments, and was clearly similar to ""Gilligan's Island"", the ""movie"" could have been helped very much by the insertion of a ""laugh track"", which would have helped the humor and ""nudged"" the viewers into laughing along.  As funny as the ""movie"" COULD have been, it needed a laugh track!
