3708503,5,B001N2PRZW,"In this trying time in our country, I found this movie to be very refreshing.  We were able to feel a surge of emotions throughout the film, and end up happy.  What a nice diversion from our daily lives and the stock market.  Everyone should treat themselves to this great escape for a couple of hours.",1236038400,4,302,4.357142857142857

3708505,5,B001N2PRZW,I was lucky enough to catch this at the Cinequest Film Festival last year.  This is one of the sweetest independent films that I've seen.  The characters are well drawn and stick with you long after the lights come up.  John Ratzenberger shines in his sad and grumpy performance as Art and Shelly Cole is absolutely captivating in every scene that she's in.  A warm and often humorous first time film from writer/director Chris Ford and I anxiously await what this storyteller has on deck for his next movie.,1235952000,6,508,4.674157303370786
3708506,5,B001N2PRZW,"I can only add to the positive reveiws posted; First rate indie film all around. John Ratzenberger is perfect as a small town barber on the ropes and Shelley Cole responds in kind as his new partner to make this a very enjoyable experience, straddling that fine line between comedy and drama quite nicely. Supporting cast deserve mention as well.",1234915200,3,346,4.783333333333333
3708507,5,B001N2PRZW,"With all the huge blockbusters cranked out by the major studios filling the multiplexes each weekend with big budget action pictures - or duds which depend on blockbuster names - it's films like this little gem which only get exposure at small regional film festivals, and by word of mouth on DVD. Actually you have probably only found this listing and review if someone recommended it to you and I'm here to give just one more recommendation that you don't miss this film.

There are no big stars here - unless you were a huge fan of TV's ""Cheers"" and remember John Ratzenger as Cliff, the mailman. (I was not so I didn't have a character image of Ratzenger in my mind before viewing this film.) He is perfect for the role of the barber who is struggling to make a living in suburban Reno, Nevada. He is matched is his talent by Shelly Cole, as the young woman who made some made ""life"" decisions and now wants to get her life in order.

Writer Director Chris Cole is practically never mentioned in the publicity for this film but without him there would be no ""Village Barbershop"". Hos background was in commercials and this project is his first screenplay and film and yet you'd never know that. The script is tight and the film is the right length. His directorial skills shine on ""little images"" like the Chinese fortune cookie messages mounted around a mirror in one frame. (You'll remember that image days after viewing the film.)

I don't even want to discus the plot here because it will only distract from the surprises. This is a ""small film"" and is best enjoyed without too much advance plot hints.

The DVD comes with some bonus features - which are creative but short. One is a 2-minute history of the occupation of ""barbering"". The other is a 2-minute history of Reno, Nevada, where Cole lives and where the film was shot. Not much, but a nice touch.

The print is excellent and the songs on the soundtrack provide just the right amount of atmosphere.

Do yourself a favor and give this film a chance. Then tell your friends and they'll tell their friends. Hopefully Cole will get enough recognition to go back to paper and camera and make another film. I, for one, can hardly wait!

The neighbors, Brian and Erik, were a riot.  Shelly Cole's character, Gloria, is a great addition to the film, a true sunshine daydream.  If you would like a great Saturday night at home.

Well done and heartwarming in spots but actually a vehicle for subtle propagandizing in favor of Planned Parenthood, the largest killer of babies in the country. If you go to pro life sites like priestsforlife dot org and read stories by former abortionists and their employees, about  what it is actually like to work in an abortion mill such as Planned Parenthood, you will see how completely unrealistic this movie is. Abortion providers are nowhere near as openminded and helpful as the doctor in this movie. Tearing babies limb from limb day in and day out, day after day, for years, ruins a person spiritually, so they can't act so kind, relaxed, unassuming and empowering (""you have options!"")  like the doctor in the movie. I know this from personal experience.

Abortion clinics don't stay in business unless they push abortions on the women who go there. For example: ""I was deceived because I was not told the truth about what an abortion means to the life of an unborn baby. I was not told that at 10 weeks (which is when I had my abortion) my child was already fully formed. I was made to believe that I was doing something that was as natural as going to the dentist for a teeth cleaning.""
 From lovematters dot com.

Anyone who tries to keep the truth from getting out about what abortion does to its providers, and to a woman and her child, is contributing to the heartache.",1361836800,4,1399,4.620967741935484

This film, which is set in Reno, Nevada, is peopled by quirky characters, led by the village barber (John Ratzenberger) and his sassy sidekick (Shelly Cole). Forced by finances to hire another barber after the death of his partner, cranky, old-school widower Ratzenberger hires the wisecracking Cole only to do his books, citing his preference for a male barber for the all male clientele. Cole earns her chair when a newly hired male barber, attempting to shave a client, nearly cuts his throat. Cole steps in and deftly shaves the client, finishing with a warm towel chin-coddling. Woven through the developing friendship between Ratzenberger and Cole are Cole's two-timing boyfriend, the shop's slimy landlord, a topless barmaid, and Ratzenberger's stoner neighbors whose electricity for non-stop gnarly partying is pirated from Ratzenberger via a l-o-n-g extension cord. The worthy soundtrack mirrors the eccentric vibe of the movie. When the closing credits rolled, my smile-o-meter was topped off, and I felt uplifted.

Very cleverly written, good setting, good story, good actors.  It was filmed in Reno, NV and Napa, CA.  Very good!

Review of the DVD:  I purchased it through Amazon.com  from ""IMPRINT MUSIC"", Sacramento, CA.  The DVD track was full of glitches, skips and sometimes couldn't hear a part of or all of a word or sentence.  BAD COPY!
I say, ""you get what you pay for"" and that was definitely the case.  What puzzles me is it was rated very highly by Amazon.com.  Don't let these guys slip through again.  They should ALWAYS review their product before sending it out to a customer.  Poor business practice.

3708584,5,B001N2PRZW,"I just loved this movie. John Ratzenberger is wonderful, going beyond his usual roles. His character is grumpy and petty much of the time (and deliciously foul-mouthed), but so sympathetic and moving. Shelley Cole's Gloria has exactly the right mix of smart and sexy, practical and hot-headed. The characters are completely believable. I grew up in Reno and appreciated the role the city was given. The movie's pace is perfect; I love having space to breathe and the director's help in noticing quiet details. Chris Ford is now on my radar and I will be eagerly awaiting more of his work.",1238630400,3,588,4.8316831683168315
3708585,3,B001N2PRZW,"The Village Barbershop is a nice surprise.  A heartwarming mix of loneliness with humor, this film takes place in old Reno.  A barber who feels he has lost everything comes in contact with a young woman who has never had much of anything.  She is full of spunk and determination, however, and eventually the barber gives in to her ideas for his dying barbershop.  Hilarious scenes with the barber's college age renters next door.  The unusual friendship that develops between the barber and the young woman brings each of them to better lives.  The writer, director and producer, Chris Ford, has a winner with his first movie.

""The Village Barbershop"" is a modest, unassuming little indie comedy set in the unusual locale of Reno, Nevada.

Art Leroldi (the wonderful John Ratzenberger) is the cantankerous old-school barber whose business has fallen onto such hard times that he is at risk of losing the establishment that he and his recently deceased partner have run for many years.  Against his better judgment, he hires a free-spirited young woman (the endearing Shelly Cole) to serve as both his accountant and fellow haircutter at the shop.  At first, both Art and his conservative customers have a hard time adjusting to this frightening new-world-order of gender equality, but through her expertise with the scissors and the force of her personality, Gloria eventually manages to win them over to her side.

Given this undeniably slight storyline, it's obvious that this movie was never going to exactly set the world on fire - but within the admittedly humble parameters that he's set for himself, writer/director Chris Ford has succeeded in creating a sweet and amusing regional comedy filled with sparkling performances and generous dollops of local color.  Ratzenberger and Cole have charm and likeability to spare, and their scenes together are played with understated warmth and humor.  Their performances alone compensate for the occasional overindulgence in indie-brand quirkiness and feel-good sentimentality.

A minor film but an enjoyable one.",1238198400,4,1443,5.410714285714286

With the current glut of downer movies, what a relief to invest my time in a wonderful piece of entertainment with plenty of substance & heart. And a feeling of hope & satisfaction, with a good helping of humor in the mix. Chris Ford worked magic with this film. And what a treat to see John Ratzenberger show his stuff! There's much more to his talent than a bar stool & Pixar voices. And I certainly hope we see much more of Shelly Cole in the future. Great movie!
