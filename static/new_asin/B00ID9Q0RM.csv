These are also not proper shorts, as most of them have little to no story.  These are more like animation tests than anything.

The first short, Global Astroliner had pretty good art, very reminiscent of a Gorillaz video or Tank Girl comic.  It also wasn't much longer than a music video would be.  The music was decent, and it had the idea for a story but then seems to have forgotten about it and wandered away.

The second short, Glass Eye had a little more story than the previous entry, but I didn't care for the art.  It also didn't really go anywhere.

The third short, Kung Fu Love is probably the only one of the four actually worth watching.  In my opinion the art on this one was the best among them, it had pretty good music, a story (admittedly full of holes, but at least it had something), and was entertaining.  It still felt more like a quick promo for something more substantial than a real short though.

The final short, Joe and Marilyn had good music, CGI animation that wasn't too bad, and what appeared to be the start of a story.  This short also felt more like the intro of a longer work than a standalone.

The final estimation is don't expect much.  I paid $5 for this collection and it wasn't even worth that much.",1405728000,,1367,4.369047619047619
8641124,3,B00ID9Q0RM,"First off, this is only 30 minutes, not 60 minutes.  Secondly, this should not be viewed as short stories.  Think of it as animation art.  There are some semblances of stories here, but the point is to appreciate the art above all else.  Also, the music it pretty good.  Glass Eye and Kung Fu Love are the best.  I could watch those two over and over.",1399075200,,351,4.242424242424242
