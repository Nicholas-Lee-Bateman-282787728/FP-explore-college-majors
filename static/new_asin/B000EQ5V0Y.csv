2528091,3,B000EQ5V0Y,"I guess for kids just starting to play ball, this might be a good starting point.  My grandson is 11 and has been playing since he was 5 and has played on select teams for the past two years.  This is a good reminder for him to review before big games or tournaments, but I think for most kids that have played a year or two and/or have had some decent coaching, it might be a bit too fundamental.  It will get used for him to review from time to time when his hitting suffers a bit and we will use it for his younger brother.

I am going to give this series one more try with the Fundamentals of Defense.",1260835200,,605,3.975206611570248
2528092,4,B000EQ5V0Y,"This DVD gives a good ideas for some good hitting drills.
It could have been better.
Maybe not as realistic as I would have liked,
I don't always have access to a beautiful field like Cal.

8112900,5,B000EQ5V0Y,Cal and his brother make hitting fun while learning the fundamentals. He uses various player examples with each lesson. There's no one way to do things. Great drills. Makes me want to go the field right away to implement what I learned. Pumps me up. It's always nice to see a Hall of Famer like Cal be a regular person and able to teach clearly how he mastered the game. You and your brother are great Cal. The back and forth is a riot. I respected Cal Ripken Jr. when as I was young now he's one of my heroes. Bill is awesome too. High baseball IQ. I can definitely see why he's on MLB Network. He knows his baseball.,1504051200,,618,4.158333333333333

8112906,4,B000EQ5V0Y,"My son has limited experience playing baseball but loves the game. This DVD provided the basics of hitting in a clear and concise video. The demonstrations and examples were very helpful. The emphasis is on providing the ""standard"" skills but not neglecting the outliers. My son immediately grabbed his bat and went out for some practice right after he watched it

  Any instructional video that encourages that level of enthusiasm is welcome in our house. My only quibbles are minor. The script/acting is a bit stiff (hey they're athletes not movie stars), the scenes where they're perched on stools is distracting and some of their kid demonstrations ran a little long.

  Is it worth the money?  Yes, but only if your kid(s) follow viewing with action and practice.",1305331200,,768,4.953125
8112907,1,B000EQ5V0Y,"I have nothing against the Ripkens. Cal was a decent hitter. However, if you are trying to learn the correct way to swing a baseball bat and generate top bat speed, go to batspeed dot com. Jack Mankin is the master of hitting. Check it out before you purchase this and ruin your kid's swing.",1295913600,,291,4.3090909090909095
8112908,5,B000EQ5V0Y,It can be a little too much about Cal...but ego has to be striked...he is an obvious giant.  Otherwise...recommend BOTH players & coaches have a look to improve your team's and individual performance.,1285977600,,200,5.0606060606060606
