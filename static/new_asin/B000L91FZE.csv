2700842,5,B000L91FZE,"I recall seeing a few scenes of The Drowning Pool many years ago on network television, and after a happy reunion with Newman's classic ""Harper,"" decided to buy The Drowning Pool, after reading some good comments about it on Amazon.com.

Set in pre-Katrina New Orleans, Drowning Pool is a rich stew of intrigue, great cast performances and classic MacDonald twists and turns within a dangerously dysfunctional family. Paul Newman completely inhabits Lew Harper's character, the settings are alternately grand and deliciously seedy, and the cinematography is excellent.

Sure, the cars are big and old (one of the subtle joys of The Drowning Pool is watching the constant parade of 70's era gas guzzlers) but the drama, wit, and characterization make this film feel fresh.

My DVD copy looked great, sounded good (I do miss Harper's classic Johnny Mandel score but the instrumental version of ""Killing Me Softly"" provided some moody satisfaction), and included both a trailer and a short ""making of"" documentary. I'm definitely going to watch this one again.",1214438400,16,1057,5.205882352941177
2700843,5,B000L91FZE,"This is a 1975 movie that Paul Newman reprised his role as Private Detective Lew Harper. He is hired by a former flame in New Orleans to investigate who is harassing her.  There exists a substantial web of deceit and you don't know the ""real"" criminal until the end.  I like this movie alot because of the storyline, excellent cast, location, and the lack of real nasty violence that exists in today's movies.  This is a very original film you won't find much on cable.",1203984000,14,469,4.4941176470588236
2700844,3,B000L91FZE,"Harper returns and he's transported to New Orleans with his 60s cool traded in for 70s cynicism.  There's great location shooting throughout.  It's interesting, but it's doesn't have the resonance of Night Moves or The Long Goodbye.  This seems like a warm up for The Color of Money where Paul would go deeper with the same idea.  (Is he  the only star to revisit a role decades apart where it wasn't just a stunt?)  There are also shades of Long Hot Summer with Joanne and Tony Franciosa breaking out their Southern drawls, and when Harper finds a suicide near the end  it echoes The Hustler.",1189296000,8,593,4.59047619047619
2700845,5,B000L91FZE,"""The Drowning Pool"" the re-creation of the novel by RossMacDonald, who wrote the classic mystery tale of all time, ""The List Adrian Messenger"" gets its due reward on the silver screen fromm performances by Paul Newman and his wife,Joanne Woodward.

A very youngMelany Griffith place the enfant terrible' in this film, not bad for a kid breaking into the movie game.  But the chief action focuses on Newman and he does not disappoint.  Cool, vulnerable, tough, resourceful, caring and himself as Harper, a role he dons and plays, in my opinion, as well as anybody living or dead could have done it.",1181520000,12,597,4.833333333333333

2700855,2,B000L91FZE,Other than a voluptuous 18 year old Melanie Griffin oozing sex and playing the underage tart this slow moving boat ride through the bayou is a snooze fest. that even a heavily tanned and overly made up Paul Newman could not make work. Good luck trying to keep up when you fall asleep watching it.

2700864,5,B000L91FZE,One of Newman's best and hands down the best movie about Louisiana I have seen. Movies like this one are getting harder to find. Don't expect Netflix to have them for you when you want them. And not that I am an expert but nothing turns me off more that an incorrectly done regional dialect. Anthony Franciosa's Cajun is spot on perfect and he is as good as Newman scene for scene. And Melanie Griffith is one reason why I miss the 1970s so much.,1464739200,2,446,4.258823529411765

2700866,4,B000L91FZE,"Pretty good.  Paul Newman is actually very good as Lew Archer.  The movie follows the book's plot for the most part, but not completely true to the Ross McDonald novel.

2700869,4,B000L91FZE,"This is follow up to ""Harper"" and Paul Newman reprises his role as a private detective loosely based on Ross MacDonald's Lew Archer. Newman is fine, but MacDonald does not play well on the screen, because the tangled pasts that give depth to his work can't be captured on film. We are left with inconsequential references to the past, wisecracks and unsavory characters headed by a one dimensional villain. This uncompromising breed does coalesce into a watchable, but not memorable movie.",1444608000,4,489,5.049382716049383

She was wonderful and very beautiful. Melanie Griffith was really good, too. I enjoyed seeing her as such a youngster. The New Orleans setting was great. I stayed glued to the television while I played this movie. I am loving catching up on movies that I have missed in years gone by. The water scene was amazing. I just enjoyed the entire movie.

2700877,3,B000L91FZE,"A sequel to the 1966 film ""Harper"", and released in 1975, this film hasn't aged well.  Paul Newman is good, and it's a kick to see Melanie Griffith all of 18 years old playing Schuyler Devereaux, but the pace of the movie is very slow by contemporary standards.

For those of us of a certain age, it's amazing to think we ever drove the lumbering sedans of the mid 1970's that roam the streets and the bayous of New Orleans in this movie.  There's also some interesting plot points involving oil off the coast, and the resulting corruption of the police as money was shovelled around to secure drilling rights.

Recommended if you're a die-hard Paul Newman fan, otherwise, I'd skip it.",1430265600,3,685,4.590163934426229

2700890,4,B000L91FZE,"Paul Newman returns as private eye Lew Harper in Director Stuart Rosenberg's 'THE DROWNING POOL'-1975, a darker, nastier sequel with a superior supporting cast of characters.  Newman's own wife Joanne Woodward plays Iris , a socialite who hires Harper to come down to the affluent suburbs of New Orleans to investigate ,what else?, a philandering husband played by Richard Derr.  Naturally, he gets more than he bargained for as the screenplay by Tracy Keenan Wynn, Lorenzo Semple Jr. and future Director Walter Hill gets Harper woven into corrupt cops played by Tony Franciosa and Richard Jaeckl , a sultry Lolita played by a young Melanie Griffith, a sleazy grounds keeper played by Andy Robinson, a venerable old millionairess played by Coral Browne, and a Donald Trump-like oil magnate played by Murray Hamilton. Mix them all in this cajun stew and you have the gist of the story climaxing in a tense situation in the title pool at the end. With nice photography by Gordon Willis and a jazzy score by Michael Small, the film moves slowly but stick with it for the climax, its worth it.  Warner releases it in a nice 2.35 transfer and should appeal to fans of the original and detective hounds.",1330214400,3,1197,4.829268292682927

OK,so this 1976 sequel is not quite as good as the original but Harper still grabs your interest to the closing credits. Paul Newman is Harper who is a little older and a little wiser. His real wife,Joanne Woodard,is in the film and you can see real attraction in the scenes they do together. Rounding out the cast are Anthony Franciosa,Richard Jaeckel,Gail Strickland,Linda Haynes,and a very young Melanie Griffith. Harper is on the case so make it a movie night and watch THE DROWNING POOL for the water,the girls,the guns,and so much more!",1265155200,,625,4.796296296296297
2700893,5,B000L91FZE,"I liked Newman so don't expect my review to be unbiased. The plot is based around Harper being a few years older but basically the same style PI you came to like in Harper. He is smart and has a drive to finish a case; even if he ends up in trouble. You get a mix of Joanne Woodward, Melanie Griffin (as a teen), Tony Franciosa (doing a very good job acting)and a stellar supporting caste.  There are allot of twists and turns, allot of dialog, one shoot out - it's Newman as Harper not Jason Bourne!

8160364,3,B000L91FZE,"When this was first released at the cinema, many (including this writer) felt ""The Drowning Pool"" was inferior to the initial Lew Archer film: titled alternatively as ""Harper"" (see separate review) or ""The Moving Target"".  The passage of time has, however, been kinder to ""The Drowning Pool"" than it has been to ""Harper"". Both films show their age, and are quite dated. but in the 10 years since the release of Harper in 1966, Newman had toned down his acting affectations a little, and it is much to the good. He is still insouciant and affected, but it works better in this film. The cast is also better this time round. Joanne Woodward works well with husband Newman, and Murray Hamilton turns in one of his excellent trade-mark sleazy bad guy performances. Tony Franciosa was never a particularly likeable performer on screen, but he is quite good in this, while Richard Jaeckel reproduces the type of performance he gave so many times in other productions for both cinema and TV.  The plot is suitably, but not overly, complicated, and the setting in New Orleans provides for some good visuals. Not a classic detective/private eye thriller by any means, but eminently watchable, and should provide enjoyment to fans of the genre.",1525046400,,1234,4.871428571428571

I would have loved to see Harper, Drowning Pool and Twilight in a box set, as they work wonderfully as a trilogy. Taken together you get Newman as detective in three distinct phases of his life: brash and a bit of a punk in Harper; older, mellower and more likeable in Drowning Pool; and in retirement in Twilight. Benton and Russo also gave us Newman in Nobody's Fool, which is also excellent and long overdue for blu-ray release. And while we're on the subject, why isn't Jack Nicholson's sadly underappreciated sequel to Chinatown, The Two Jakes, available on blu-ray?",1521936000,,789,4.766423357664234

8160371,4,B000L91FZE,"""Harper"" helped to establish neo-noir and William Goldman's script of Ross MacDonald's 1949 Archer novel The Moving Target  novel updated the setting to the mid-60's. The sequel film (which it took nearly a decade to put into play) directed by Stuart Rosenberg and written by Tracy Keenan Wynn, Lorenz Semple Jr., and Walter Hill from the novel of the same name is one of those rare examples where the sequel not only equals the original but is better than it.

Harper (Newman) gets pulled into an investigation by a former girlfriend Iris (Joanne Woodward) in Lousiana. Harper doesn't quite know what he's taken on when Iris' daughter (a teenage Melanie Griffith) tries to sedcue him in his hotel room and the case that Iris wants him to work on, involves Harper preventing Iris' husband (Murray Hamilton) from finding out she has been cheating on him. The plot grows increasingly complex and Harper has a hard time--ahem--keeping his head above water.

Warner Archives has done a fine job restorting this classic film. It's a pity that Newman didn't play Harper more often as he does a terrific job playing the world weary Harper (the character's name was changed to Harper because the producer of the previous film discovered that, while he purchased the rights to the novel, he didn't purchase the rights to the character. Newman suggested that the character's name start with an H as his films with an H in them had done well and writer of the 1966 film William Goldman complied). The audio sounds quite good with a strong mono presence. The film looks strong with a very nice restoration.

Sadly, this film doesn't have any commentary tracks (Goldman did the commentary track on the previous film which was carried over from the DVD) but it does include the original trailer as well as the brief promotional featurette produced for TV back in 1975. It doesn't provide much insight into the production of the film but it's nice to see it included.

""The Drowning Pool"" makes me wish that we had gotten the other Harper film that was cancelled in the late 60's. The screenplay was completed for it and a director chosen but it never made it to preproduction for a variety of reasons. Enjoy ""The Drowning Pool"" but make sure to bring a life preserver.",1520208000,2,2254,4.769230769230769
