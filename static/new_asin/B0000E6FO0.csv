8002074,2,B0000E6FO0,"The guy in this DVD, John McCarthy, can't even do clean string sweeping in the DVD. I think this DVD is a joke. All he showed in the DVD is some basic metal riff and some simple sweeping at slow speed (the sweeping he did doesn't even sound clean lol). I bought this DVD because I got free gift certificate from amazon.com. I wouldn't recommand this to you because you can find better ""Advanced metal"" licks/[...] ......

Bottom line, this dvd is not worth more than 10 bucks.",1227916800,2,476,4.409090909090909

8002076,5,B0000E6FO0,"This dvd is great! I wanted to learn something new on guitar but most videos are either chessy vague,or not my style. This dvd is for metal but is pretty universal, I really recommend it if you want to learn something new, and it's entertaining. I also suggest the other dvd's they have, and John Petrucci Rock Discipline dvd.",1167782400,2,326,4.5423728813559325

My friend, whom I recommended this DVD to, won second place in a contest out of 10 people.  My skill level increased immensely and I plan to continue to buy Rock House Method Products.  ""Advanced Metal"" was the best instructional guitar DVD I have ever purchased.",1139529600,9,376,4.651515151515151
