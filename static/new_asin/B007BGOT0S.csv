8513811,3,B007BGOT0S,"I can already play lead parts with a slide. I wanted to learn more about open G tuning.  I was hoping for instruction that would show how to play rhythm parts while singing or alternate chords with the lead fills,  Also hoping to pick up several turnarounds in open tuning.  Not much of any of that.
The written materials for download were general scales and things that relate to standard tuning, but not even any box diagrams of any chords to play in open tuning.",1427328000,,465,4.447058823529412
