8370653,5,B002I2PI28,"A wonderfully calming, soothing and charming little story collection for babies and toddlers. My son loves the characters and I can tell that the carefully measured timing of the simple animation and music combined with the the calm storytelling is good for capturing the attention of his very rambunctious spirit. In other words, this DVD calms him down and gets his undivided attention! It's very nice for parents too; I really enjoy the relaxing sounds and images of this series in contrast to some of the more chaotic, upbeat and loud cartoons out there on TV. I highly recommend this and other first word stories.",1438128000,,618,4.895238095238096
8370654,5,B002I2PI28,"This is the 4th Be Smart DVD I have purchased for my toddler granddaughter.  The first DVD, Get Dressed captivated our then 16 month old granddaughter, ""Miss J"".  The 4 characters, Iggy, the Piggy, Larry, the Lion, Edward the dog and Dede, the bird introduce little ones to the words, reasons and activities involved in the activities of getting dressed. The same delightful music adds to the experience of introducing small children to day to day activities.  The DVD Nighttime tells simple stories of the 4 characters preparing for bed.  Other DVDs include Pets and House.  Today our granddaughter is 33 months old and still selects these DVDs as her favorites when she visits.  Often, her 5 year old brother even stops to listen to the stories and asks questions about the stories.
I highly recommend these stories to adults who desire entertaining stories that are free of over stimulation and and barely disguised sales vehicles for cartoon character based DVDs.",1411257600,,967,4.975155279503106
8370655,5,B002I2PI28,"These So Smart! series are awesome. No, it doesn't make your child smarter and if you are smart enough yourself, that is not the purpose of these DVDs. However my child loves all of them. They have simple stories, great art and music that helps a child calm down. As a teacher I see great benefit in teaching children basic understanding of their little world. Of course playing, building blocks and using their imagination doesn't replace this, but I believe that would have never been the designers intention and most parents are smart enough to get that and look beyond marketing.",1328054400,2,583,4.782178217821782
8370656,5,B002I2PI28,"Before buying these, we watched the free ones On-Demand. My son, who doesn't really like watching TV, LOVED these. We only had access to the ones for younger kids, but thought we'd try a few of these First Word Stories since he enjoyed the others so much. He not only LOVES these, but it definitely encouraged him to talk more. Before we ordered these DVDs, he would only say a few words here and there or just use signs. A few months later, he's talking up a storm!

We are happy with this series, if nothing else to have something ""nice"" for our son to watch.",1307404800,2,561,4.2924528301886795
8370657,1,B002I2PI28,"I'm amazed that people haven't wised up to the deceptive marketing practices used in the titles of videos like Baby Einstein and So Smart! There are no data to support these videos making kids 'smarter' or more like Einstein. Unfortunately, many parents read the title and subconsciously (or not so subconsciously) decide that if the video is called this, it must make kids smarter. Think about it - would you be equally inclined to buy this video if it was called ""Ketchup sandwich?"" I would venture a guess that most consumers wouldn't.

Our local PBS station carries a lot of them. These videos are slow-moving and simple - which is fine for small children. They're probably no better than most other cartoons for pure (and questionable) entertainment purposes IF your child likes them (which our kids don't). However, don't buy them thinking you're doing something good for your kids. Reading, drawing, building with blocks - those are mind-building activities for little minds. Watching TV is not and should not be considered good for children no matter how the stuff put on the screen is marketed. Instead, I hope that consumers exercise a little consumer activism and stop buying things that may trick well-meaning parents into thinking they're doing something good for their children.",1305417600,,1292,5.065727699530516

My son is 2 years old and hardly ever watched any of the other baby videos/dvds or shows on TV -- not even Sesame Street (and he LOVES Elmo and Cookie Monster).  When I started this dvd, he was instantly engaged.  The music and characters are very inviting.  My son likes that he is hearing the words for things that he normally encounters in his day/evening routine; and I like that he hears and sees things and animals that are commonly found in our neighborhood.  There are pauses between each piece of every segment of the stories so that I can reinforce words that have been introduced and I can show my son other things in the scene that are interesting.  The characters say hi and bye as if they are talking right to him - and he loves that!  I like that the dvd is divided into several segments, so we can stop watching after one story ends and then watch the next one later.  I'm going to use some of the ideas from the Printable Activities section to enhance his learning.  I highly recommend this dvd!  We have the ""Outside"" dvd, too, and my son likes it also!",1266278400,2,1077,4.318407960199005
