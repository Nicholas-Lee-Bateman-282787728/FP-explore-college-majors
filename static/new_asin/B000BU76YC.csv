2441350,4,B000BU76YC,"Seeing that Midnight Clear had won awards for many independent film contests, I gave in and am glad I did. The film was brought to life through the amazing editing and directing of the movie along with the ability to correlate such a great acting staff. The ability to bring raw human feeling out the way Midnight Clear does makes it a film that is not merely a ""feel-good"" story to entertain, but one that shows the goodness in people underneath life's pains.",1207612800,6,460,4.554216867469879

2441353,5,B000BU76YC,"By far the best Christmas movie I have seen in years and one of the best movies I have seen in a long time!  I wish they made more movies like this!

Simply told, and beautifully understated.  A wonderfully told tale about five strangers whose paths cross one Christmas Eve and impact one another's lives in sometimes simple, yet rather astounding ways.

Not your usual Hollywood-type Christmas film where everyone is smiling and a happy ending can be found around every corner.  No, this film is about real people, with real problems, in the real world, where things don't always necessarily end happily ever after.  And, during the course of the film, we're never quite sure just what the outcome is going to be.

Honest, sincere, real, totally believeable.  I could readily and easily identify with each and every character.  The performances are top-notch and are played to perfection.  Every performance comes across as being completely genuine.

I love the look and feel to this movie.  Visually stunning, it's hard to believe this was shot on such a low budget and in something like only 18 days!

Touching and deeply moving! The movie never feels forced or manipulative. And the ending is just right!  (I just loved the character of Mitch).  A most rewarding viewing experience indeed!  My praise and highest compliments to all involved.

I highly recommend this movie and will be looking forward to the next feature to come from Jenkins Entertainment!",1198972800,53,1460,4.918032786885246
2441354,4,B000BU76YC,"MIDNIGHT CLEAR is an easily overlooked film: the cover of the DVD is bleak, the description of the story sounds a bit corny, and the promotion of the film has been scant. But what is not expected for those viewers able to overcome the above negative aspects is a well-made little series of interlocking vignettes that poignantly address the impact of random acts of kindness in a world grown calloused.  It is touching in the best sense of the word and well worth watching even beyond the Christmas season.

The unnamed town gradually opens windows to some fairly sad people: an elderly woman Eva (K Callan) talks with her doctor on the telephone about her meds and we note that she may be facing the thought of suicide in her desolate life; a sweet woman Mary (Mary Thornton) and her young son Jacob (Dominic Scott Kay) visit their brain damaged husband/father in a rest home (the man was critically injured in an auto accident one year ago); a lonely many Kirk (Kirk B.R. Woller) stands in his isolated convenience store without patrons; a longtime drunk and lonely ex-husband Lefty (Stephen Baldwin) is fired from his menial job, despite a recent promotion, because of his consistent tardiness; Mitch (Mitchell Jarvis) works with kids for a church to assuage his guilt for having survived the auto accident that devastated Mar's husband's life, reluctantly agreeing to his pastor (Richard Fancy) to take his youth group caroling to the shut-ins on Christmas Eve.

Each of these characters influences the others by a seeming random act of kindness: Kirk helps Mary and Jacob with their broken car, Eva is given a meals on wheels by a church lady (Victoria Jackson), Mitch and his carolers provide some needed money by means of a token gift that will allow Lefty and Eva to attend Christmas Eve Service, and Eva's 'meals on wheels' ends up providing midnight food for Kirk and Mary and Jacob. Writer Wes Halula and director Dallas Jenkins carve a story that, though at times suggests it may become cloying, is genuinely touching. The cast, especially Baldwin and Callan, is excellent, and each of the characters is well developed, leaving the viewer with a sense of a morality tale we sorely need.  Instead of a big booming Hollywood finish, the film simply tapers off with suggestions of the importance of selfless acts that can make a difference.  It is well worth watching, especially now, and especially during the Christmas season.  Grady Harp, December 07",1198713600,83,2462,4.863961813842482
2441355,4,B000BU76YC,"I had the good fortune to have been at the premier in Tampa, December 16th. My wife, daughter and I met and had cordial conversation with Mr. J.Jenkins and his son Dallas.  Stephen Baldwin was there also, all to promote the film in a benefit for the Tampa Crisis Center.  No this isn't ""Over the River and Through the Woods...."" fare, but is well worth watching, and although some of the pauses and reflection periods during the film seem pervasive, the pace mirrors the empty frustrating and frequently depressing day to day experiences those in crisis must feel.  I will remember that evening for a long time.  Although placed at Christmas time, the events portrayed are 24/365.  Thank you Jerry and Dallas Jenkins for making this film.",1198713600,11,738,4.7795275590551185

2441358,3,B000BU76YC,"Midnight Clear is truly a bleak Christmas that parrellels what is happening in today's society

A recently homeless and jobless loser named lefty, an ill  senior citizen estranged from her family, a mother of one son dealing with her husband's brain damage from an accident, a gas station owner stuck in a job and location he hates, and a youth pastor feeling irrelevant face depression and loneliness on Christmas Eve. As they cross paths and experience random and minor acts of kindness, their lives are changed forever

This film, based on a story by Jerry (Left Behind books) Jenkins
is not a happy Disney-like motion picture. So if you want that, this film isn't for you. I know this is a small film. The DVD  has heart and pulls on your heartstrings, but it is bleak and very depressing for a Christmas movie

However this is a great showcase for actor Stephen Baldwin. His character range goes from simple depression to rage to fear.

The ending of this DVD  is weak at best, because there is little resolved at the end of this film. I felt empty with little cinematic payoff

2441359,5,B000BU76YC,"Only 20 minutes long, this aptly titled film left me simultaneously dumbfounded and in awe.  Alone, sitting in his rundown car parked in the desert on Christmas Eve, Stephen Baldwin's character, sweating, swigs from a bottle, puts a gun to his chin, yet he stops short.  Nearby, and also alone, an elderly woman prepares a suicidal brew in her kitchen.  That's all I'll reveal about the storyline, though, as part of the beauty of this movie is seeing how its pieces come together.  Midnight Clear is about huge things (existence, relationship) and the small (a smile, a song)--at the same time, even the hugeness of the small.  It's heavy, yet full of hope.  The movie's brevity and thought-provoking aspects make it an ideal discussion-starter for a small group or get together, although before the talking starts prepare to be found speechless for a ponderous wow moment.  Baldwin's performance, by the way, is mesmerizing.",1161129600,11,926,5.0130718954248366

2441362,5,B000BU76YC,"Wonderful acting, realistic plot, with depth and characters rarely seen in Christmas films -- ultimately uplifting message that what WE do for (and TO) each other *matters.*  An extremely original film that brings ""the reason for the season"" down home, out front and in your face.

If you're looking for your typical saccharine Christmas tale, keep looking. NOT a lalala ""church can fix it ALL"" film either.  Probably NOT the best Christmas film to watch when you are at your very lowest, since the movie sets up some criss-crossed misfortune that takes most of the film to begin to tie together.

HOWEVER,  if you need a bit of perspective if you're otherwise tempted to host the world's most sincerely serious pity party, this could shake your world.  If your own faith in how much one little act of kindness really matters is on wobbly footing, this is a must watch.  Oh - and Merry Christmas.

2441375,5,B000BU76YC,"Really good movie showing the need to do, think the right thing even though there is no reason you feel to do so. It's about having faith beyond yourself and your circumstances no matter what they are. It's about enjoying the little moments here and there that we find even though we would have hoped for a different moment. It's about humans in their humanity and how sometimes in the oddest of circumstances people can touch each other lives and uplift them in some way and come together. It's about how you think goodness goes unnoticed and sometimes Gods grace is more there than we know or expect. It's about just getting up and getting through the day and meeting an unexpected friend to talk to even though the encounter is brief it's about being together, helping each other and sharing a moment of feeling that we are all together here. It's about how an innocent encounter with either a child or some carolers trying to bring joy to people who are used to having not many care for or about them and how that innocence and intention of Gods grace can change dire circumstances to joy and gratitude. Sure it's not the norm but it CAN happen and on Christmas Eve is more likely to happen. It's about people who are pretty degenerate actually going and doing something different than they would ever be able to accomplish and maybe even recovering from alcoholism and the attendant ills that accompany it such as job loss, stealing, lying,etc. This movie is about quiet miracles that not many would notice. It's about not feeling always lonely or misunderstood or abandoned by everyone; so this is really a movie about kindness and compassion, fourth and fifth chances and finding someone to talk to who can legitimately understand what you are saying which really is rare",1496016000,3,1778,4.701923076923077

I needed to be encouraged and this was exactly what I needed!  Seeing the hand of the Lord on random situations that weren't so random - seeing how He takes the bad and turns it into good (beauty for ashes) reminded me that ""all things work together for the good to those who love the Lord and are called according to His purpose"".

It is about several troubled people/families who are experiencing loss, generally disgruntled or fiercely angry and ill.  It is a movie that has a good conclusion, which kind of surprised me, since it concentrates on portraying fairly bleak and raw life situations, which can be a ""downer"" especially if you don't get to the conclusion.  It was the need to see the conclusion and hoping it worked out which drove me to watch it all the way through the first time. If you are sensitive to deep emotional problems especially someone considering their angered reactions and a suicidal situation, use caution in watching.  I feel it necessary to add that it all works out in the end with some truly uplifting clarity.  However, I don't plan to watch it again.",1482710400,,876,4.662337662337662

Stephen Baldwin's acting in this film is - and I don't say this lightly - the most outstanding performance I have ever witnessed by an actor.  Anywhere, anytime.  I have always respected Mr. Baldwin for his moral lifestyle, but had no idea of the debth of his acting ability.  Throughout the movie, the character he plays is unlikable -  bordering on dispicable. I cringed each time he appeared.  Then as the film unfolded - as I got to know the other characters and their stories, I began to appreciate the strong performances of the entire cast.  Stephen Baldwin is brilliant, finding redemption and peace at the end.  We all need to experience what this quiet gem has to offer, both the strong, rich performances and the redeeming message within.",1482364800,,925,4.73125

If you are looking for a sappy/campy Hallmark family movie with a fast, predictable plot and clean resolution, this is not the one. This is a movie about life and how it doesn't always turn out the way we wish it had. Life is messy. People get in traffic accidents, thy lose their way in their personal lives, they get stuck in dead-end jobs and grow old without family to surround them. This is a more slowly-paced movie about how people can come to the brink of despair and still find their way out again, fill the spiritual tank and get life moving. This is not a movie in which Christians are portrayed as perfect people who gather together to praise, but about how they come together flawed and in need to find clarity and peace together. Actors all used wonderful restraint.",1481068800,37,830,4.467105263157895

2441585,1,B000BU76YC,"I love faith-based movies. Typically, the budget is lower so one might expect a lower standard of acting, directing, and editing. I was shocked that Stephen Baldwin's portrayal of an alcoholic father down-on-his-luck was so bloody awful! Driving his beat-up car down the road, all while taking slugs of whisky and playing with his new-found gun? That's not irresponsible--it's stupid. Then we see him talking on the phone to his ex-wife and she's the complete opposite of him: faith messages in the house, a Christmas tree in the background, perfect hair, etc... The plot is like Swiss cheese, holes everywhere! The only characters that didn't feel like they were reading their lines off cue cards was the grieving wife and the gas station owner.

Presumably in an effort to avoid being overly preachy, the script is practically devoid of any actual mention of God, Jesus or the Holy Spirit, even though the story is all about God working in and through the lives of the characters. ""Gospel threads"" are woven throughout the story, but the failure to actually have the characters talk about it is indeed peculiar.

  I think some people expected more from this movie cause they have watched a lot of fairy tales.  I prefer Real Life, and Real Lessons; which is what this movie portrays.  I could see people I know in these characters. I understood that the carolers delayed the actions of a woman, which made the time table work out just right !

A MIDNIGHT CLEAR: The time: December, 1944. The place: The Ardennes Forest separating France and Germany. The surviving half of a 12-man Allied intelligence squad is ordered to occupy an abandoned chateau and keep an eye out for German activity. What they find is a small squad Germans who seem to believe in turning off the war every once in a while, notably for a temporary truce to celebrate Christmasand to surrender. The catch: If it looks like they gave up too easily, their Vaterland families might suffer the consequences of their cowardice. They suggest staging a mock skirmish then all heading back to American lines. I think we got a chance to make something good come out of this, the American instigator urges his companions, if we just use our heads. But all thats required for a tragic accident is a single head thats not screwed on quite right...

Discussion: The horror of war is a clich, but few films have conveyed the more subtle horrors of war as well as this original entry. The movie starts with a screama scream that echoes silently throughout the entire somber story as a pervasive sense of anguish and anxiety, of isolation and despair. The imagery enhances these emotions, surrounding us in dark, foreboding forest or stark white snow, the only respite from which is the dim flicker of a fireplace.

Although punctuated by graphic violence, these few scenes contrast well with the playful segments in which the Germans toy with the confused soldiers in an attempt to set up a tentative truce. War is hell is a clich as well, but this movie makes the metaphor literal, transforming the odd encounter from an anti-war statement into a religious allegory. From the Christmas setting to anointing a sacrificed companion (a failed divinity student) to pouring his blood into the grail of a canteen as part of a plan to finesse their way from behind enemy lines, the latter third of this somber and sobering film is rife with Christian symbolism. In this vision of war, there are no heroesand few survivors. Aspects of A Midnight Clear might begin in clich, but the finished film is as far from clich as is possible.",1422576000,,2392,4.690476190476191

As a rule, I avoid movies I suspect will be saccharine or too church-centric, because I always feel smothered by the sincerity of it all.  MIDNIGHT CLEAR was almost overlooked because of my prejudice!  While perhaps not quite 5-star writing, the fine cast does a great job elevating what's there.  We were quite pleasantly surprised at the honest emotion and stakes of the story; I even teared up in a couple places because the various plots played so real.  It was kind of slow getting started, though, and it's not a good film if you're in a loud or distracting place.  The stories build, and you know they have to all intersect, and you expect there to be a showy ending with everyone hugging and crying--well, you'll be disappointed if that's what you need.

When you are badgered, bullied and shunned the strength of helping others goes away.  I have lost my faith, however I have seen much evil.  I used to do mission work in our Country in our community.  Over the years I have experienced much abuse even from faith believers in God from all religion.  I want to tell those that has kept going to help others those little things that you have done whether you believe it or not has tremendous outcomes and at times a domino positive affect.  Thank you for being there and helping.  It does makes a difference.  This movie is a great movie to see.  We do not know just how things fall in place many times right at the moment of a deadly outcome.  Like in this movie the mom was saved from committing suicide.  Things works in mysterious ways and I have to admit throughout the years there are things I cannot explain that changed my course that brought a safer positive outcome, when I was in danger.

2441816,2,B000BU76YC,"I'm sorry but this one simply didn't work for me.  Not that the acting was bad (it wasn't), not that there was nothing likable in it (there were a few things), but it was just too negative.  Two potential suicides in one movie and the same family were too much for me.  And the guy was just too much of a jerk -- his boss gave him a raise so he could convince the court that he should be allowed see his children, despite the separation with his wife.  He shows up late for work and drunk, mistreats the wife and then expects to be able to get visitation rights.  I won't go into the other rotten things he does.
  There is a nice storyline with a man who runs a gas station and goes out of his way to help a woman and her daughter when their car breaks down.  There are some carolers from the local church who go around visiting homes, singing and even leaving gifts for the poor folks.  Pleasant, but not enough to save the rest of this thing.
  True, some people don't do what they should but I've never seen anyone that bad before; it simply becomes (to me, anyway) unbelievable.  There are many good Christmas movies, not a few of them about some who's been driven to despair, lost their way, but are at least reasonably nice -- I'll watch them instead.",1417046400,,1258,4.2175732217573225

It's a bit like real life -- they don't just skip to the big climactic whatever -- you see the ""everyday"" moments in several characters lives... people dealing with hardships (the disability of a loved one, divorce, loneliness, broken dreams)... and how their individual paths cross.  It has ""pay it forward"" aspects and random acts of kindness -- all that remind you that every little kind thing you do has the potential to impact someone else's life in a positive way -- sometimes even in a life-saving way.  The end of the movie redeems the slow-moving-ness of it -- and knowing that helped me to stick with the movie till the end.  And I'm glad I watched it!

2441854,5,B000BU76YC,"I think some of the negative reviews wanted a happy, Hollywood ending.  This movie is acted supremely well.  Stephen Baldwin isn't Stephen Baldwin...he's ""Lefty"", a pitiable wretch that reminds me of several people I've known over the years.

The characters are believable, accurate, and uncomfortable.  They remind you of people you know.  I'm sure that makes some people very uncomfortable to think that people around them, people they talk to, people they work with...might be really screwed up and hopeless.  People who are justifiably angry that they have been abandoned by their ""friends"".  Or maybe the characters remind them too much of themselves.

This is a story of hope.  It's well written.  It makes you question your assumptions. It makes you think about the conversation you have with people every day walking down the street.  It will make you uncomfortable.  That's the point.  In a dying world...NO ONE SHOULD BE COMFORTABLE.

Midnight clear SHOULD make you ask ""how do you help people who don't want help?""  How do you save people who don't want saved.  Why even try?  If they want to give up...why not just let them?  Every man for himself, right?

If this review makes you curious...watch Midnight Clear.  You may not like it...but it will make you think.  It may even give you hope.  And hope is becoming a rare commodity these days.  Just saying ""hope"" isn't enough.  Hope has to come from somewhere.",1389398400,2,1423,4.9071729957805905

I have to say that the beginning was slow and stopped watching it weeks before because I didn't think it was going to be any good. But today for some reason I was compelled to watch. And boy, am I glad I did.

For some this movie may seem a bit slow, but you have to just sit back and relax and let it seep into your soul. About real people and real events that happen to them on a lonely Christmas Eve. it shows just how significant each and every one of us are, even if we do not believe it ourselves. Lefty is the prime example because he thinks that he is no good since he was a child, and keeps the nickname with him into adulthood.

But Lefty is wrong. He finds out along with the rest of the characters in the movie that they are a very important part in the human race, just by being themselves. Hats off to Stephen Baldwin. I did not know who he was at first but thought, hey I've seen him before. Great job acting from whole cast. It seemed like you were really there watching these people.

2441890,5,B000BU76YC,"According to the commentary on this film, Jerry B. Jenkins, he of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Left-Behind/dp/1414334907/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Left Behind</a>&nbsp;fame and the father of director Dallas Jenkins, got the idea for a short story when he read a statistic that the number of suicides is higher at Christmas than at any other time of the year. That statistic is false, according to Snopes, but there are, of course, people who are depressed at Christmastime. This film is about some of those people.

Stephen Baldwin, in a superbly understated performance, plays Lefty, a down-on-his-luck man who loses his job on the morning of Christmas Eve. Living in his car, having trouble with visitation rights for his children, he wanders about somewhat aimlessly, and depression oozes from his performance in a way that seems completely real. He is, we soon learn, a man who has reached the bottom. His story is not the only one, though.

K Callan plays Eva, an elderly woman, is preparing to end her life. Her family has abandoned her, and she is getting what few affairs she has in order: putting out an entire bag of cat food for (apparently) a stray cat, closing out her checking account (with less than $10 in it), and so forth. Kirk B.R. Woller plays a man who owns a convenience store and opens on Christmas Eve because the competitors in the area are closed. When his few customers wish him a merry Christmas, he responds, ""Yep."" Then there is Mary Thornton Brown's character, Mary, a mother of a young boy. Her husband has been hospitalized after an accident and is suffering mental and emotional issues that make him essentially inaccessible to her. Finally, there is the young pastor who seems to be questioning his effectiveness with the youth group, which goes through the motioning of caroling for elderly parishioners who seem to have no interest in attending the Christmas Eve service. These characters' lives overlap as their stories intertwine.

As a Christmas film, ""Midnight Clear"" (based, parenthetically, on a short film with the same title) is different from most. If you add the number of scenes at a mall, the number of mentions of Santa, and the number of young, attractive people who realize they've been in love with each other for a while, you get 0. Nor, somewhat surprisingly to me, is there any preaching. Given the provenance of this film, I expected a tendentious film. That's not at all what I got. ""Midnight Clear"" is instead a compelling character study with superb acting all around. It is a moving story about the importance of simple human connections. This is not a Christmas movie for children, but it is a powerful story for adults.",1351728000,9,2729,5.046563192904657
2441891,4,B000BU76YC,"Midnight Clear is poignant and painful. It will kick you hard, if you are a thinking person. The plot line is straightforward, yes, but I will tell your viewers this: Never before nor since have I seen a group of movie goers remain silent and shell-shocked in their seats for probably five minutes as the closing credits rolled down the screen. I watched this movie in that very theater, and everyone simply sat there, stunned. Including me. That, in and of itself, speaks volumes for this movie.

I guess some people just get it, and other people just don't.

The hopelessness and lack of joy turns into hope and joy when people do the right thing and do little random acts of kindness, even when it doesn't seem like it makes any difference.  Amazingly both in this movie and in real life, just a little kindness often goes a long way to change hardened hearts and sad, lonely people.  The movie works because it truly demonstrates that there is still a lot of hope, even for those who seem to lost all hope.  Superb casting, especially Stephen Baldwin.  Truly uplifting, even though not a bright and cheery movie.  I got a lump in my throat at the end.  It's not a dramatic ending; just a quiet and pleasant ending.  Sometimes it is nice to have everything all wrapped up in a nice pleasant package at the end of a movie.  You won't get there here, but the movie wouldn't work well if it was done that way.  Instead, you just kind of instinctively know that the people who had lost their way, are going to be okay now.

The cast, headed by Stephen Baldwin, all deliver first rate wonderful performances in this bleak though hopeful Christmas tale. Five people, all in different stages of depression and despair, find themselves facing a Christmas eve full of regrets, sad anniversaries and feeling unable to cope. Each is touched by some random, some deliberate acts of kindness and each finds themselves transformed in unexpected ways. Telling or hinting at the plot does not do justice to the true authentic humanity of this film. For it says in a very quiet subtle way, it is kindness that gets us through the worst times and helps us when much seems hopeless.
What a terrific holiday film that revels in the small moments in life and in the observation that it is those small moments that makes going on worthwhile. A smart, keenly observed film that should be required vieiwing any holiday season! First rate cast and writing enhanced by a sensitive director - what a joy!

2441909,4,B000BU76YC,"""Midnight Clear"" is a first feature by director Dallas Jenkins.  It is an excellent piece about human relationships and personal isolation.  Stephen Baldwin who was in ""Fred Claus"" has the lead.  As the loser Lefty who has lost his family, his job & his home, he consoles himself with a bottle and thinks about ending it with a gun.  Baldwin's performance is tightly controlled.  It's so underplayed that it almost fails to appear.  In the DVD extra, director Jenkins seems a bit star struck with an actor with as many credits as Baldwin; but it seems that Baldwin perhaps was a victim of lack of direction in the part.  The rest of the supporting players are marvelous.  Faline England plays Lefty's wife Heather in a couple brief cameos.  Perhaps the strongest performance is by K Callan who appears to be doing her first work in 10 years in the film.  Her first film was 1970's ""Joe"" followed by many credits including 1979's ""The Onion Field.""  As Lefty's mother Eva, she is losing her health & her memory while her family has abandoned her.  Her transformation when Lefty arrives on her doorstep is endearing.  Victoria Jackson from TV's ""Saturday Night Live"" from 1986-1992 cameos as the meals on wheels lady who brings Eva food.  Mary Thornton who was in an independent film titled ""Solitude"" in 2002 does an excellent job as Mary, a woman whose husband has suffered brain damage from a car accident, and who finds herself stranded at a filling station on New Year's Eve.  Thornton's performance is incredibly layered as she works with grief, attempted bravery, and loneliness.  Her son Jacob is played well by Dominic Scott Key who was in ""Minority Report.""  They wind up at Mr. K's filling station played by Kirk B.R. Woller who was in Clint Eastwood's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flags-of-Our-Fathers-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000M4RG42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flags of Our Fathers (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and 2003's version of ""The Hulk.""  Playing a character named Kirk, Woller shows amazing sensitivity, loneliness and the ability to love when he helps Mary with her car on this Christmas Eve night.  It's another stunning performance in the film.  Mitchell Jarvis -- in the only film credit I could find for him -- plays the youth pastor Mitch who was Mary's husband's best friend and mourns his loss.  Jarvis does an excellent job with the doubts that he can effectively serve God as he takes kids out for some passionless Christmas caroling.  Richard Fancy who was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shopgirl/dp/B000EDWKX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shopgirl</a>&nbsp;and ""Being John Malcovich"" plays the pastor Mark who keeps encouraging his young youth pastor.  The film concludes appropriately for me as people show up in church searching for hope and finding it by being needed by others.  This film won the ""Best First Feature Film"" award at San Jose's Cinequest Film Festival.  It is well worth viewing.  Enjoy!",1217203200,3,3029,5.405117270788913

It is slow but please to do not hit the stop button, I guarantee
you will enjoy this wonderful movie. PG-13",1211328000,,167,3.9411764705882355
2441911,5,B000BU76YC,"I know that people will think that this is some religious movie pushing an agenda. It is definately NOT. Stephen Baldwin would have been nominated for an Oscar if this movie was perceived to be anything other than a ""Born Again Christian"" movie. That's too bad. It is anything but. It is a bleak, yet inspirational film about the end of hope, yet at the same time shows the beginning of hope, all without any ""agenda"" of any kind. Mr. Baldwin truly does give the performance of his career. Oh, and I am NOT a religious person. Please, rent it. And don't be ashamed to do so for fear of being labeled.",1210896000,9,600,4.366071428571429
2441912,3,B000BU76YC,"""Midnight Clear"" was directed by Dallas Jenkins, son of Jerry B Jenkins, who also produced and wrote the story the film is based on. I'm not a fan of Jenkins Sr and expected a rather preachy Christian film. I was wrong, almost.

Stephen Baldwin gives a suprisingly good performance as divorced, unemployed and homless Lefty, and K Callan is even better as the lonely widow Eve. The rest of the cast is a mixed bunch. The story is about loneliness and kindness and some scenes are very good, others weaker. The ending, while optimistic, is especially weak. It didn't feel true to the rest of the movie and this keeps me from giving it a higher rating. Not all problems are solved by going to church.

Overall, this is a pretty good movie, certainly much better than I expected. It's a rare example of a Christian themed movie that is not preachy and can be enjoyed by both Christian and non-Christians.",1208736000,29,901,4.590062111801243

8092719,2,B000BU76YC,"I was hoping for a family friendly movie for our movie night. Given Jerry Jenkins as the man behind the story, I thought this would be safe. However, my 11 year olds begged to turn it off after we saw two characters actively trying to commit suicide, and then we had to field questions as to why a car in a dark parking lot would be moving while it looked unoccupied (clearly a couple having sex in it). So yeah. Thanks a bunch for that memory, director. We finished the movie, as I was sure the nose dive of a script would pull up at the end and make it all worth it. It wasn't.",1515196800,,579,4.043478260869565

8092721,5,B000BU76YC,"A rare Christmas movie that shows real people facing real problems and not a drop of schmaltz. So refreshing! An old woman faces loneliness, a young mother grieves her husband, and a divorcing father loses his job, all on Christmas Eve. We see the small ways people alleviate the pain of others, just enough to make life feel worth it and to get us through another tough holiday season. This is real life and i love it. If you're a realist with the stomach to see the world as it is, and you don't need more Xmas fairy tales with fake plot lines, this is your movie. Its defi mine!",1513728000,,581,4.290909090909091

8092723,5,B000BU76YC,"Tired of those sappy Hallmark style Christmas movies where you know how it ends by watching the first five minutes?  Well, this movie is different. It's an impacting Christmas movie in which  you're not sure how it's going to turn out until the last scene. Stephen Baldwin is excellent as he plays a drunk, depressed out of work man on Christmas Eve. His life intertwines with several others bringing it to a conclusion that leaves you thinking about the impact we each have on other's lives. This is a movie we watch each Christmas and recommend it to our friends and family. It's one you won't forget.",1512691200,4,603,4.626168224299065
8092724,3,B000BU76YC,"This move was ok for me.  My husband, on the other hand, watched about 40% of it and decided that it was a waste of his time and walked away.  It definitely isn't a feel-good, Christmas movie that I thought all Christmas movies are supposed to be.  It did, however, get me thinking that this movie was probably more realistic to some people than the feel-good Christmas movies are.  I screened this movie to see if it would be appropriate for the kids (teenagers), but I don't think I'd want them to see it.",1512432000,,507,4.361702127659575
