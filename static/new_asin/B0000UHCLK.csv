8003203,3,B0000UHCLK,"I'm not sure anyone who wants to buy this movie is seriously looking for a well written script, but in case you want to know more of the ""web of deceit and betrayal"" as advertised on the back cover of the video tape, here's the plot. Rachel Taylor, played by Jodie Fisher, is the beautiful and neglected wife of a lawyer whose successful career is getting on a fast track. As Tom Taylor's busy schedule leaves Rachel so bored, she begins a torrid affair with Rick Simms, a boxing-contender-turned-sexy-bartender, while Tom is also having an affair with a buxom blondie named Laura (played by Kristi Scott of the ""Bikini Carwash Company"" series). Before long, Rachel discovers that Tom hired Rick to seduce her so he could get grounds for a divorce, so she sets out to turn the tables on him...
Although ""Intimate Obsession"" is viewed by some tough critics as a bottom shelf erotic thriller (obviously due to poor acting and directing), I think the cinematography is pretty good and the curvy Jodie Fisher deserves some credit as a real eye candy. Anyway, she would go on with her career, and apart from some minor roles opposite Lisa Boyle and Shannon Tweed, she does get another leading role in ""Body of Influence 2"" a few years later. Good for her.",1055289600,13,1250,4.660633484162896
