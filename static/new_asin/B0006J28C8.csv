Besides the fact that the camera quality was poor, it made me dizzy with all the camera movements. I would not recommend this be watched by anyone, because this movie shows that parents do not understand. In today's society, parents are becoming more exposed to the gay/lesbian situation and are more in tune with it. I personally have never seen such a poor display of a movie and would not recommend anyone waste their money on such a movie. I think there should be a ""000"" star category, in which, this movie earned it.",1111795200,4,605,4.509090909090909

2189654,3,B0006J28C8,"BLUE CITRUS HEARTS as conceived, written, produced, directed, etc by Morgan Jon Fox is one of those films that has a core of honesty and passion for the message that makes you want to love it.  Apparently filmed on a digital camera with no accoutrements available to the other Indie film makers, Fox makes the most of a no-budget situation and perseveres in making a statement about gay crises in high school kids who must fight for their identity in an inhospitable world - this time Memphis, TN serving as the Anyplace, USA.

Sam (Joshua Peter Laurenzi) is a quiet teenager who lives with grotesquely ignorant parents (Lee Ann Roberts and Mark Pergolizzi - both pushing the borders of credibility) who wants to take guitar lessons and have a car but is refused both by grounded parents who feel he is a loser.  Julien (Paul Foster) is a quiet guy who daydreams,  and spends his idle hours in coffee shops, but differs from Sam in that his single mother (Emily Fry) is a loving, caring, present person.  They both attend a high school that  seems in the rank and file of most, both have girlfriends (I think the better of the two may be Alex Booth, but the credits are minimal), and both feel something is missing in their lives.  Sam and Julien struggle through this film, trying to communicate with themselves, with friends and finally with each other - discovering what they fear most, that they are gay.

Yes, this is a tale universal and yes, Fox manages some good effects superimposing his poetry over the picture screen, poetry that is better than the script thoughts.  The problem here is not the story telling, fragmented as that is, but in the actual product of the film. The soundtrack is so loud that it drowns the dialogue.  And that is not only the very raw 'music track': the ambient sound of trains and cars and just plain noise is enough to make many folks just stop watching out of frustration at not hearing the storyline.

Fox has gathered some credible non-professional folks to enact this journey - some even with evident talent that may take them beyond this particular project.  For a first film by a wannabe filmmaker this is a brave and in some ways successful attempt.  Hopefully next time around Fox can  clean up the distractions and focus more on production techniques that would move his talent into the public arena.

2189655,5,B0006J28C8,"With some movies the modest ambition is to entertain. Others seek to expose and enlighten. It is the latter category into which ""Blue Citrus Hearts"" fits -- a simple film about life in America told with passion and elegance.

Sam and Julian are two boys who, within the high school caste system, fall somewhere between the nerds and the losers. Sam has an abusive father and a cold-hearted mother; Julian's parent is a single mom who nonetheless provides him with an abundance of love. Both have girlfriends and neither has a job. Sam writes in a journal he will not let anyone see and hopes to take guitar lessons. Julian haunts coffee shops and daydreams.

Yet both have come to realize something is missing from their lives, and this sense of loss is diminished only when they are together. Will either have the courage to admit their love for one another, or the strength to overcome the consequences of that love in a disapproving world?

The genius of ""Blue Citrus Hearts"" is that the filmmakers used every aspect of the storytelling to support the gritty and unpolished nature of the story itself. The film was shot with a digital camera using ambient lighting. The sound is choppy and harsh. Camera angles and shots lack the slick sophistication of a Hollywood production. The script speaks in a language we all know and speak ourselves. Acting is dead-on.

It is a skillful intersection of cinema verite and 21st century technology.

""Blue Citrus Hearts"" makes another important statement, too -- that in 2005 it is still not OK to be gay. It may be fashionable to accept and even embrace homosexuality in television and movies, but in the day-to-day grind of modern American life, gay men and women are still shunned, still legislated against and still murdered because of their sexual orientation. The misery Sam and Julian experience in coming to terms with their sexuality brings this struggle into the blessed light of day where it can be revealed for what it is: a pox on compassion.

""Blue Citrus Hearts"" tells a story that is being lived by millions of loving and decent people in America. I hope it will say to the parents, neighbors and co-workers of gay men and women everywhere that we are human beings who seek only one thing from this all-too brief life: happiness.

It's not a polished Hollywood offering.  The surface is rough and evokes a homemade documentary--with sound and lighting problems, real-looking people, and uneven acting.

If you're figuring out whether to rent or buy this movie, I give the helpful advice that if the word ""angst"" doesn't make you run off screaming, covered in a film of panic sweat, then maybe you will enjoy this movie. As for me, I am still in the process of repenting the sin of bringing this monstrosity home and making my roommate watch it with me.",1106092800,5,628,4.285714285714286

an unassuming film of extraordinary power. Bold, delicate, yet resilient Blue Citrus Hearts is an exquisite, wildflower of a film. Set in Memphis, far from the pulsing coastal cities, and with alarming realism, the film's ensemble, non-professional cast expertly gives us a multi-layered story of first love, enduring friendship and survival of ""outsiders"" in the south. An emotional, yet fitting soundtrack by indie-rockers Loggia adds to the beauty of this story of adolescent angst, sexual exploration, and true love. This film will remind even the most jaded why we love film.

2189670,5,B0006J28C8,"Morgan Jon Fox puts so much love into this movie. The way the story unfolds is disarming and gently takes you to a place where you can feel and understand the innocent love as it develops between Julian and Sam. It portrays their awakening to the terrifying realization that they are gay and it projects the feelings of loneliness and rejection that still, to this day, too frequently accompany coming out in America.

Julian and Sam were fortunate in that they had each other and came to terms with being gay when they were still in high school. I was in denial until I was 30 and in and out of empty relationships with girls because I always felt that something was missing. Then I met a man not unlike Julian who opened my eyes and stayed by me while I struggled for 2 years to accept a part of me that I cannot change. After 30 years we are still together.  Watching the story of these two boys in Blue Citrus Hearts made me cry. It was my story. I was Sam.

This is a film that can be shared with family, friends and even clergy with the hope that it might open their eyes and help them to understand what it is like to be gay. It breaks away from the bromidic gay film theme of sex crazed party boys with one eye constantly on the door looking for something better to come in. It shows what 40 million gay people in this country already know. No one chooses to be gay.",1447459200,,1374,4.196969696969697

The main characters were very believable in their roles.  I had a friend whose father could have been the model for the abusive father here. He beat up and threw his 14 year old son out of the house on a January afternoon in Chicago with nothing more than a tee shirt and a pair of jeans.  I could feel the emotions in the two young men here as well as the young ladies playing their friends at school.

And though a soul mate may not yet be found, a blue citrus seed still survives, protecting within a kernel of what we call hope. ""Where there is life, there is hope,"" Stephen Hawking may think into existence with his miraculous mechanical voice box.  But those of us, the bearers of blue citrus love, we know that the Cambridge don has got it backwards and that ""Where there is hope, there is life"" is the only mantra that keeps alive the blue citrus seed until someday its fruit, love, will ripen.

I also agree that both of the stars were neither photogenic nor charismatic.  Nevertheless, a lot of the scenes throughout the movie really hit home because they were so true to life.  My life, I mean.  And what really did it for me is that the ending totally made me cry because it was so perfect.  I came away from this film feeling really good.  I am glad that I stumbled upon it.

But honestly, it seemed definitely real. I've seen some people say that the acting was poor, but honestly, I believe it was spot on. It actually looked like someone just following these characters around in a real life event, no acting involved. That to me means great acting.

2189686,4,B0006J28C8,"Friendship struggles as each of the boys develop at different rates for desires, fears, and needs with each other and for those in their social and family groups.  Fear of discovery of their secret love, even though it is only expressed verbally and tentatively at first, causes stress fractures in the relationship and yet allows free development once the secret is outed.
Tiptoeing around their love expression verbally helps build their actions and feelings to misunderstandings and confused rejection. But as all good movies try to do, things magically resolve from major issues to ""it does not matter now we have each other"".  The story shows realistic relationship challenges between different characters that flare and wane as hormones rage and over-react to everyday interactions among friends.  Difficult subjects, such as suicide, gossip, homophobia, and social interactions of teens are handled in a realistic and respectful manner.  The closing credits and commentary are appropriate in their message if a bit unusual in the method.",1412812800,,1044,5.386503067484663
2189687,2,B0006J28C8,"Cheaply made, but admirable for its true and honest telling of a modern gay teen coming of age story, this movie suffers only from lack of professional polish.  The story shows the development of the relationship between the two boys from early friendship through a romantic connection.  Once the boys come to terms with their mutual attraction to each other (and it doesn't come easily), the movie is over.  I would have liked to have seen the film explore how the romantic relationship worked once it was established--that would have been more interesting than all the angst leading up to it.  The two actors playing the teens are interesting for not being the typical Hollywood pretty boy casting.  They are genuinely awkward and outcast and the director creates a very real sense of their isolation and feeling of the misfit.  There is a nice moment when one boy breaks down in front of his Drama teacher. The scene is played well, but it is too bad that the teacher character wasn't developed to be more integral to the story.",1408838400,2,1031,4.731843575418995

The writing is arguably poor. However, something about the low production quality and mundaneness of a lot of the dialog made it feel more ""real"" to me. For me, this movie had the feel of a home movie, almost, someone just taking a camera around and capturing scenes from the life of a gay high school student in Tennessee struggling with his home life and learning to express his feelings.

It doesn't have the polish or drama of a more professional film, but I enjoyed the window on this ""normal"" student's life. I always felt like I avoided ""drama"" through high school as I lived my closeted purposefully asexual life and didn't know I was just putting it off. For me, seeing a ""real"" life like this that maybe come just a little closer to ""normal"" in the aspect of recognizing one's sexual orientation and growing into it was refreshing and enjoyable. I thought it was a cute story that held me interested through it.

I am a gay man, and if you are anything like me, you are constantly in search of that ellusive thing called Good Gay Cinema.  LGBT movies are a fairly small genre and not often watched by people outside of the LGBT community. Because of this much of what gets made is low budget and of poor quality.  I have suffered through many a poorly written, acted, or filmed movie for the sake of solidarity, lending support, and seeing something to which I can actually relate.  Much of what gets made is a fantasy or all about sex or streamlined and sanitized to make them ""palatable"" for a larger audience. This Is Not One Of Those Films!

This may well be the truest film about a teen coming to terms with his sexuality that I have ever seen.  Shot in a very realistic style, this little film has a lot to say.  It doesn't say it however; it flat out shows you.  This is definitly ""slice of life"" at its best.  The acting is superb for it genre, and I have absolutely no trouble believing that every shot and scene included in this film was intentional.  If your looking for a film to watch, this is the real deal.

You might think it starts too slow at first or be put off by the camera work before you realize that it is 100 percent intentional instead of being the product of amateurs.  Don't let it fool you.  This movie is a work of art with a very organic flow.  Give yourself about ten minutes to get the idea and feel of the film, and you will find yourself watching with ease and appreciation.

Many are always looking for that film that they can share with a straight friend or family member in order to spread a little understanding.  This is a film to consider for that purpose.",1326499200,7,1747,4.277439024390244
2189707,2,B0006J28C8,"Blue Citrus Hearts - 2  *'s

This movie really took some time to ""get off the ground""; the beginning was very slow moving, ""unfocused"", the situations were ""oh hum"" ""too real"", it wasn't ""Edgy"" enough and the supporting actors were lacking in skill. However, as the film progressed, the film maker's style became clearer, the characters became ""more real"" and more importantly more interesting. By the end of the film I could truly empathize with the lead character - he really did a great job of convey his emotional pain as did the director in moving this story forward and painting a picture of ""realism"". I felt the film could have used a bit tighter editing (some of the classroom scenes seemed a bit disconnected), there was an apparent lacking in skill with some of the actors and the ending was a bit unbelievable for me (I really did not feel these characters shared a ""physical"" attraction and the ""jump"" seemed a bit unbelievable). This film had a very ""real world"", ""unpolished"" feel to it; the dialogue felt unscripted, the situations real and the character's story believable - it is not a typical ""Polished"", ""Hollywood"" Drama and was clearly produced on a ""no budget"", however it's believability and realism was masterfully crafted...",1207094400,5,1250,4.8915094339622645
2189708,2,B0006J28C8,"Blue Citrus Hearts was one of those films you buy out of curiosity because Amazon associates it with a lot of the films that you like and enjoy.  I'm a huge indie fan and this sounded sweet and had some positive critical review behind it, so I took the chance.  I can't say that I'm upset that I saw it, but honestly it hasn't really changed me in any way as good cinema ought to.

First, the good: Paul Foster as Julien is wonderful.  He's charming, interesting, beautiful, and lights up every scene that he's in.  I would be very excited to see him in something that displayed his talents better.  Lee Ann Roberts as Sam's mother and Helen Bowman as Sam's grandmother were both very good and made the most of their few moments on the screen.  I have nothing against the ""two boys fall in love and it's tough"" script; it's pretty much what one expects from a low-budget indie.  It's a very rough effort that tries hard but the writer clearly needs more life and experience to really grab hold of an issue and do something revelatory with it.

And then, the bad: The camera-work is pretty much unforgivable.  I completely understand that it's a budgetless indie, but the cinematography in BCH is a step below what you see people doing with their cell phones and posting on YouTube these days.  The shaking, the awkward angles, and the crappy lighting all made the film very difficult to watch.  If there's something worse than what they did with the camera, then it's the audio mix.  The ambient sound made parts of the film un-hearable and some elements were so loud that you just wanted to press 'stop.'  I have probably never encountered a movie ever that I so wanted to stop watching on account of the audio.  The soundtrack was horrific; it sounded like they went down skid row and had all the drugged-out buskers sing into a microphone whatever they could make up at that moment and decided to call that the movie's musical score.  Alex Booth as Arielle and Suzie Cyanide as the local tranny were grating and terrible.  Cyanide in particular spent chunks of his time staring right at the camera as if reading his few lines off a cue card - it was very uncomfortable to watch.

But the real problem here is a complete lack of direction.  Several times through the film, the actors are just kind of sitting there looking at people behind the 4th wall spitting out dialogue that they seem to be improvising as they go.  They don't understand what's supposed to be happening at that moment in time, they're not telling us any part of a story, and that is entirely the fault of the Director.  If someone had effectively been able to get the actors to understand what they were supposed to be doing and feeling throughout the script, this movie would have been much improved.

I don't know what to say about the star, Joshua Peter Laurenzi.  He's not a good actor, but he's not unwatchable.  Again, it seems the Director just told him, ""hey, you're full of angst and unhappy"" and then started filming him as he did whatever he wanted to do.

All the badness aside though, there's something endearing about watching such rawness.  We were all teenagers and a lot of the issues are familiar.  The film just tries way to hard to be the most indie indie-film ever when it would have done much better to actually create something less painful to look at with some sense that the characters themselves believed that they were not just actors.  If this were made by junior high school students (and make no mistake, it looks as though it was), then I'd say ""good job, kids.""  As an effort by adults; however, it just didn't win me over despite the charming Paul Foster and some not-terrible motivating ideas.  If it's showing on cable some time, see it.  I can't recommend it as a purchase though.",1206576000,4,3790,4.537555228276878
2189709,1,B0006J28C8,"Ok I know it was low budget but the acting was terrible, almost laughable and the most annoying was the music which is loud and obnoxious.

2189710,5,B0006J28C8,"Caveat:  Anyone needing a blockbuster with a budget and great effects need look elsewhere.  What this is a slowly paced, heartfelt, honest little movie that has, if one allows it to, the power to move you profoundly.  There is a sometimes arthouse pretentiousness that is not inappropriate here, which in fact reveals the deceptively simple story as the myriad of complex emotional issues that as the film's base.

The story of two teenage boys in Memphis - from extraordinarily opposite homes, finding their way through friendship and sexuality while dealing with the complexities of highschool, teenage romance, angst, fitting in, the desire for popularity and the odd desire of wanting to be misunderstood and alone.

Joshua Peter Laurenzi (Sam) and Paul Foster (Julian) are outstanding as the ""heros"" of the story; unremarkable, ordinary boys learning to cope with emotions they fear and possibly can't understand.

Director Jon Fox strikes the right balance, lights the film beautifully, at times allowing primary colors to wash over the entire screen.  Another nice touch is having the poetry to flow across the screen (I'm assuming Sam's) adding a rich layer of emotion to an already overwhelming experience.

I've read many negative criticisms here (and elsewhere) so I suppose this is one of those no-budget indies that speaks strongly to some while others can't seem to find its remarkable heart.  A beautiful experience for those willing to look past its obvious limitations.",1160784000,19,1486,5.236286919831223
2189711,5,B0006J28C8,"Well I saw this movie for the sole purpose of Jason Booth's role in it - so of course I had to be all creepy like and buy the thing and watch it.  Well it was a little boring, and frankly I would have never gotten through it without the promise of Booth making an appearnce.  However, I came to appreciate the film.  It isn't as bad as some of the people have reviewed it to be, but it sure as hell wasn't cheated out national recognition.

If you cant, thats ok, i found that part hard myself. it has a message. don't get me wrong. But they expressed it differently. The credits were of better quality than the film and they needed to get sum more 'beautiful' people. More people would enjoy it if they had a piece of eyecandy to stare at the whole time to help them keep track of the plot. Which wasn't very in depth.",1133049600,5,680,4.159090909090909

Plus, it really makes you think.  It's one of those movies that just gets better and better the more you mull over it.  I highly recommend it.",1131062400,5,453,4.475609756097561

The best part of this movie was the poetry that was shown. The very ending credits were nice and i hate to knock the film because I think the message was important but man this movie was horrible.

The film ended a bit too quickly but I am going to give this 5 stars anyhow. Please, before you watch this, do not judge the film by the low budget.
