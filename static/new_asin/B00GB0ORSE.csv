6069025,5,B00GB0ORSE,"A must have movie. An interesting twist setting the time in a parallel universe. Great story, great animation. Hollywood really needs to open their eyes. Foreign companies are light years ahead in good animation. There is no reason why hollywood cannot come out with good animation. They just don't want to. If they would just start to make them like this one, then there would be a whole new audience flocking to the screens to see them. I have nothing against the Disney type animation. But come on. For us steam punk alternate realms/universe, fantasy, sci-fi lovers of good animation, america, get off you butt and start competing with the Chinese, the Japanese, and everyone else. Watch this movie and learn from it. I have already watched it several times and refered it to my facebook people. Excellent movie. A must have take on an original sci-fi classic.",1396656000,,864,4.844594594594595
6069026,5,B00GB0ORSE,i loved this movie when i first saw it the story moved along nicely the battle action was beyond epic. I can say i will never tire of this movie it has become one of my all time favorite movies hope their is a sequel coming soon.,1396569600,,229,3.893617021276596
6069027,4,B00GB0ORSE,"I really looked forward to seeing this mainly because it brings so many talented people from the TV series of Highlander back together and that made it a lot of fun.  Having said that, I am also a fan of great animation and this movie did not disappoint.  The story line is an interesting twist on a beloved classic, uniting humanity in a greater world of peace, which is a little cliche but entertaining none the less.  The musical score is worth mentioning with remixes of a couple of popular songs by the Moody Blues.  There did seem to be something missing, possibly in the character development, and I felt there was a little too much melting flesh.  Perhaps the time spent on that could have been put to better use.  In light of the graphic and disturbing death scenes, as well as language not appropriate for all ages, (hence the PG-13 rating), I would not recommend this movie for younger audiences.  As an adult fan of science fiction however, its worth a watch.",1396569600,,971,4.545977011494253
6069028,5,B00GB0ORSE,"Beautiful background,  definitely an eye catcher. Always action going on somewhere. Fast paced film that will keep you on the edge of your seat till the end. And awesome music throughout.",1396569600,,187,5.032258064516129
6069029,5,B00GB0ORSE,"This should not be just an underground classic in the making. I'd say it's a stellar sequel to War of the Worlds. Yes, steam punk like we haven't seen yet, this is something that Hollywood only wished they could make. it proves that true innovation and entertainment can only be found in small studios. the story is engaging. In many ways it's a classic war picture, an invasion piece and a steam fantasy all in one. The mech designs are fantastic, The characters are all genuine and sympathetic. The is the type of heroism one finds in the old black and white films. Plus plenty of action and alien bad guys to keep the piece moving. Appropriate for younger viewers as well as fans of classic sci fi. Let's get the word out about what a gem this thing is. Spread the love, internet!",1396569600,14,783,4.444444444444445
6069030,5,B00GB0ORSE,"What I found so cool about this film, was the depth of detail shown in every scene. The 'look' of this film makes it the best done example of American style animation that it's ever been my pleasure to watch.
 The story and characters are aimed at a teen audience, but if you enjoy mecha mayhem done in a steam punk style, which literally takes up at least half the film, this show will draw you in.  The action sequences are so full bodied, well orchestrated, and just darn good that you can't look away.

And no 'spoilers', but 'Teddies' brief speech at the end sets things up for a sequel perfectly!",1396310400,3,602,4.357142857142857
6069031,3,B00GB0ORSE,"This is a well sorted out movie, and I am an animation fan.  The plot meshes time, historical figures, and stereotypes together (particularly stereotypes of cultures and race).  But if you look at this as an alternate universe, a mirror image of our planet where outcomes were different from ours, then it actually works.  This is a good look at what would have happened if Mars attacked earlier (say, during the early growth of the industrial revolution - WW I), and then managed a second attack 15 years later.  What would our weapons of war look like and how would they work during that time (thus the ""Steam-punk"" feel).",1394841600,2,624,4.697247706422019

6069033,5,B00GB0ORSE,I loved this movie it is the best animated film i've seen this year. The story moves right along nicely the action is plenty I love the idea of an alternet 1914 in were the humans have rebuilt there world using the aliens technology and the humans having their own tripods to fight the returning invaders. i also want to say that this is one of the best alien invasion movies i've seen in a long time. I don't want to give to much away but if you are a fan of alien invasion movies or anime then this is one not to be missed.,1394582400,12,525,4.0095238095238095
6069059,4,B00GB0ORSE,The movie is an alternative twist on ww1 events and characters. The main focus is battling and defeating a second Martian invasion. The men are drawn beefier and more heroic but that adds to there appeal. The 3D and 2D animation flows together very well. The mix of steam and gas powered vehicles are interesting as well a mix of that time period including the 1940's and 50's technology. It's a very good heroic type of movie with lots of action and a nice twist to the classical war of the worlds music. Worth having and to watch several times.,1484870400,,546,4.47

It's not as great as lets say 'battle for terra' which was higher budget and you have to buy a 3d blu ray from Germany to get that one sadly anyway.  This one is available right now for you to own.  This is of course based on H.G. wells classic 'war of the worlds' , of which screen version the 1953 one remains the best imo.  They did a good job animating this and they filmed in native 3d so what's not to like if you are 3d lover?  It reminds me of 'gog' which is a 1953 3d film that will be released in march of 2016 on 3d  blu ray.  SO if you want some good animated sci fi in 3d ., then you can't go wrong with this one.

6069087,3,B00GB0ORSE,"Caution, spoilers!

First and foremost, I thought this movie was just....okay. It didn't blow me away, but for the hour and a half run time, I was able to enjoy it for what it was, a steampunk adventure. I have to say, seeing that it was essentially a Highlander TV series cast reunion for the principal characters certainly helped to get me to watch. That being said, this movie did have some issues that kept a potentially great concept from being great and reduced it to only 'okay'. First, the pacing. I understand that there is time constraints when it comes to films, but any real individual conflict by the principal characters was resolved in quite literally a few seconds. When Adrian Paul's character backs out of helping out his IRA brother get weapons to kill the English, it was literally resolved in a few seconds, with the brother saying ""You're dead to me."" and that was it. It was, quite simply, an entire sub-plot that was completely unnecessary and only served to add as filler to the script to make it a bit longer. The movie would have done much better if they'd removed that sub-plot altogether so they could have focused more on proper character development. The same could be said with the Captain's fear of freezing in actual battle, since he had never been in combat before. Well, it's no surprise that he does just that and freezes at the first sight of the Martians, but he is over that in just a few scant seconds and suddenly he's the hardened warrior his squad needs. Now, this particular part isn't too bad because it eats up very little screen time, but it started and ended so fast I wonder why they even bothered with it. Beyond that, there were a few things about the battle with the Martians that confused me. For instance, were the Martian tripods vulnerable to conventional weapons? In every encounter, the soldiers would open fire with your typical machine gun attack first and it really seemed to be completely ineffectual against the tripods. Why, then, would they even bother with conventional firearms at all when it came to tripod combat? Why not focus the weapon technology on missiles and heat-rays, which were actually effective? It's just something that bothered me during every combat scene.

On a whole, the movie was reasonably enjoyable, even if it felt a bit rushed and perhaps not fully ironed out in terms of plot and character.",1423267200,3,2384,4.7009569377990434

Excellent animation.  Great plot.  Good voice acting.

Truly a fun film, and I recommend it for sci fi and steampunk fans.",1410652800,2,395,4.571428571428571
6069114,4,B00GB0ORSE,"This well-animated feature film, if it's not considered a modern classic of the steampunk genre by those who are of it, probably should be. It does an excellent job of giving alternative history as well. How many films do you know which have Teddy Roosevelt, Professor Tesla, and the Red Baron all fighting on the same side? The voice-acting is top-notch too.

This is not a children's film though by traditional, pre-video-game standards - while the images of human (and alien) death, and of certain other human realities such as eroticism, are not played to the hilt as some filmmakers might have made them, what *is there is highly realistic (e.g., humans consumed, flesh and bone, to vapor within seconds). It really hurts to see the best efforts of Earth overmatched (although not hopelessly so) by the next-generation Martian war machines - which is a tribute to the writers as striking that dramatic balance is not at all easy to do.",1410480000,,940,4.838509316770186

If you like your plots simplistic and your characters 2 dimensional, which is fine, then this might work for you.  If you're looking for engaging characters, plot intricacies and unexpected twists ... not so much. I was hoping for more, so this felt like a video game more than a movie.

I love animated movies especially movies made from graphic novels. I especially love anime. I even like live action movies translated from graphic novels or comic books when they are well made. But this was depressingly bad, and anyone that says different has low expectations or has not seen many good anime films. The plot was promising, but it was not well written. Editing was terrible. It felt like the storyline jumped around so much. The animation is nothing spectacular. The characters were predictable, lifeless, and I could have cared less if they lived or died. I though maybe it is just me, but after searching options on other sites, a great many anime fans share my opinion. For the life of me, I can not figure out why so many people on Amazon like this movie. I found myself wanting to turn it off several times but hoped it would get better.......but it never did.

6069146,2,B00GB0ORSE,"About 20 to 30 minutes in i shut this film off and gave 2 instead of 1 stars because i don't know if it got better or not.  The beginning of this film was very cliche in my opinion which instantly turned the lead character into a souless clone that i wasn't interested in.  In certain parts the animation was so bad i felt like i was wathcing one those cheap bible cartoons for toddlers (which is great for youngsters) but with a very slow story.  There were a couple parts where it looked like they slipped in some cgi to liven things up but it came out looking horribly dated.  If your looking for an anime don't pick this go with fist of the northstar, vampire hunter d, ninja scroll, wicked city, akira, or one of the other classics, even titan A.E. and FF spirits within make this look like A epic fail.

After the War of 1899 the surviving earthlings used the Martian technology to their advantage and develop into a Steam-punk alternate earth. By 1914 the world has gotten back to ""normal"" in fighting each other again only to find out, They're back. I find the movie very entertaining with great animation and good story. The only thing that was weak were some the characters but still worth to get if you liked War of the Worlds. Actually, I hope they do a prequel to the original H.G.

6069150,5,B00GB0ORSE,"I love the story and the animation style and all of that.  Loved loved lobed ....what I saw of it...My problem is I have NEVER seen the end of the movie because the DVD's are crap.  I am in possession of my 3rd copy and still right towards the end the dvd just hoses up.  One did go as far as the War in New York and it looking like they won at great cost.  I even got a new player and tried using my lap top.  So, buy it and support the cast who are some of my favorite people in the world but realize you are taking a chance and will be ok not knowing how it ends exactly.  If you were going to design a little private hell for some one...this would be mine.  I know budget can always be a big issue with independent projects but they should chance the manufacturer of these.

6069151,3,B00GB0ORSE,"Just finished watching ""War Of The Worlds - Goliath"" released by Tripod Entertainment.
This version of H.G. Well's classic ""War Of The Worlds"" takes place about 15 years after the events described in the novel and extrapolates a steam-punk version of an Earth that has reversed engineered Martian technology in order to build a global army that is capable of defeating the Martians the next time they invade Earth. [No mention of the Martian attempt to conquer Venus is mentioned in this movie.]
Perhaps one of the better sequels to the War Of The Worlds, I'm still torn about this movie. Lush animation aside, I couldn't keep from wondering if this wasn't an attempt at launch an animated series that never got off the ground.
The ""Goliath"" referred to in this movie's title, is a manned mech suit, complete with steam power, missiles, and death rays that is brought into action when the Second Martian Invasion Attempt brings World War 1 to a crashing halt.
Real life historical characters have minor, but significant roles in this movie. Yes, humanity wins again, with a hint that the sequel will have Earth invading Mars.
Recommended, but the original George Pal movie is far superior.

6069153,1,B00GB0ORSE,"The animation on this films is amazing and the voice acting is also great. However, the story is subpar left me really disappointed.

Nothing can really save a subpar story not even the best action and animation which this film has in spades. In a parallel universe aliens have attacked earth(War of the Worlds) the earth survives because the aliens aren't immune to common earth bacteria.  Fast forward a few years and the joint world forces are gearing up for when the aliens return. WWI comes about and the United World Army is disbanded and soldiers are ordered to return to their home countries. However, the very next day Aliens decide to invade the earth again. No suspense or build up just the very next day. The story continues on with no suspense or development of the plot. Just an endless string of events happening and random one liners. This film has Jim Byrnes, Peter Wingfield and Adam Baldwin to name a few. To subject them to one liners and dialogue that sound like  it came from a 90's cartoon plot. This story had a great idea Steampunk vs. Aliens. However, it lacked the ability to keep some sophistication in its story telling. This could have been an A+ movie if the storytelling was done right. It does have some great animation and voice acting.",1399507200,3,1270,4.635555555555555

6069158,5,B00GB0ORSE,Superb animation and a driven story that never lets up and builds on Wells WOTW and takes it to the next level. The story is set 15 years after the original attack and the Earth is under attack from a second wave of Martians who are more powerful and immune to the biological effects that killed them off in the original story. The action is thick and fast and the heat rays are on full power as giant manned machines battle against alien tripods. The Red Baron even puts in an appearance as a daredevil flyer. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves Manga or the latest batch of DC/Marvel animated movies.,1398556800,5,616,4.412280701754386
6069169,5,B00GB0ORSE,"I will admit to being a huge fan of cartoons/animated films. I will also admit that the artwork has to be good. the story needs to be good. the characters need to be well defined. I'm happy to say all the requirements have been met in this film. This film has that steampunk type of feel and takes place in a parallel universe at a much earlier date the 1930's and 40's. The scenes are al very grand in scale and those bad Martians are back to try a takeover. I loved the multi-cultural characters, English, Irish, American, Canadian and Malayan. That is the prime crew. There is a back story with the Irishman, why it was necessary, I'm not sure, possible test of loyalty? Great battle scenes and very well done. so if you love a good 'toon go for it.",1398470400,,752,4.302816901408451
6069170,5,B00GB0ORSE,"War of the Worlds: Goliath is  nice take on a seemingly popular story. David Abramowitz's screenplay is witty funny, and powerful.

There is a treat for anyone who watched Highlander the Series with cast members from the show providing the voices. An entertaining must see for sure.",1398124800,,369,4.765625
6069171,3,B00GB0ORSE,"A rather odd effort,this Malaysian production is directed and voiced by Americans. I found the dieselpunk aesthetic pleasing - everything that was not human was well designed. The characters however, were mostly bland, with the men herculean and bombastic, the women negligible. The plot meandered frequently and pacing dragged, with a lot of WTF moments and drawn out battles in a monotonous war. In fact I found myself wondering if I should finish the movie midway, despite the novelty of a 3D, non-Disney animation... though like the movie, the 3D often lacked much depth.

I realize that, as opposed to well known superheros or an anime with 12 episodes, a single movie with unknown characters needs to cram a lot into 2 hours... But Goliath really wasted a lot of potential.

At this point, I do have to give massive kudos to the initial opening sepia credits sequence, which was fantastically done and probably raised my hopes for the movie way too high. It recalled the art of Shaun Tan and conveyed the emerging Martian threat wordlessly in a very suspenseful way. If not for this brief segment, I'd have knocked the movie down a star.",1397865600,3,1143,4.826530612244898

6069173,4,B00GB0ORSE,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle creator and head Heavy Metal magazine produced this movie animated in Malaysia which brings a new light on H.G. Wells' story. Joe Pearson directed this steampunk sequal to the original book, whose previous works include the Highlander anime movie, Skeleton Warriors, Duck Tales, and Rocko's Modern Life. with this being his first big directing job. Even though it's a Malaysian production, this has a definitive anime look to it, specifically from titles like Fullmetal Alchemist and Steamboy.

Set in 1914 on the eve of WWI, the nations of the world have united some of their best forces to create an anti-Martian army called ARES using reverse-engineered Mars tech to create their own tripods named the Goliath. Despite the fact that the Great War is about to begin, the troops of ARES instead dedicate themselves to stopping the oncoming Martian invasion which they find out is on its way from the Red Planet. A young Theodore Rooselvelt, Nikola Tesla, and the infamous Red Baron lead ARES, but the movie mainly focuses on the crew of the Goliath itself who have their work cut out for them while being torn apart from loyalties to their own families and conflicting nations. The Martians strategically attack three locations around America, but it all turns out to be a ruse as they focus the bulk of their forces on New York City. ARES brings their remaining tripods to the Big Apple for an all-out counterattack against the aliens, even though their own battle zeppelins aren't a total match for the Martian mothership.

This dieselpunk saga acts as great follow up to the original War Of The Worlds book, but also takes some inspiration from the 1950s movie by the way people are wasted by the heat rays. This has a decent voice cast, with Cowboy Bebop's Beau Billingslea, and pretty much the entire cast of Highlander: The Series. There were several independent studios behind this, but it is for the most part a high quality production. It had a limited theatrical run in 3-D, although its hard to see where that comes into play when watching it at home. This is a good addition for your average anime fan, but pretty much a must for any steampunk fanatic!",1397520000,2,2193,4.814323607427056
