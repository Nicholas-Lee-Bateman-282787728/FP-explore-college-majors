5766108,5,B00D09AYJK,"The cast of characters in this series is fantastic and the storyline that weaves everything together reminds me a little of Larry David's Curb your Enthusiasm. This series should be categorized as a ""dark comedy"" given that it does seem to have a drama feeling to it at times. If you liked season 1, then you will definitely like season 2.",1389225600,2,339,4.573770491803279
5766109,5,B00D09AYJK,As a fan of Season 1 my husband and I appreciate the witty dialogue and ridiculous legal backdrop.  They show reminds me somewhat of Boston Legal with much more flawed characters.,1384300800,2,179,4.774193548387097
5766110,4,B00D09AYJK,"I enjoy shows from other countries, and have been watching quite a bit of Australian shows.
I am crushing on Richard Roxburgh. I had not seen him in anything before this show. His character is the lawyer equivalent of Hugh Laurie in House. A jerky, unfaithful, addict, somehow charming and clever lawyer.
I found all the actors very good. The guest spots and semi regulars who come and go all do a great job. As with all Australian shows I discovered they have no qualms about showing naked sex, lots of sex and swearing the likes we do not hear in America on network TV. Also some of these episodes had some out there topics they featured that I found a bit much. This show is most definitely rated R. I guess they are making a US version with Greg Kinnear. I wish they would bring these shows over to us, vs. these remakes they Americanize. Half the charm and what I find interesting is what other countries watch and their legal system and government. I am sick of seeing what Hollywood forces down our throats about our country.",1381708800,2,1032,4.465608465608466
5766111,4,B00D09AYJK,"The premise of this series is initially dubious. How a brilliant attorney would end up living the Cleaver Greene lifestyle isn't easy to fathom at first.

Give it a chance. By S1:E3, you'll buy in. By S2:E4 you'll know the creators of this show have really achieved something special.

The writing is top notch. The series cast, led by Richard Roxburgh is, across the board, wonderful. The guest stars, many, very well known, are all exceptional. Buy it.",1378857600,,454,4.8076923076923075
5766112,5,B00D09AYJK,"What a terrific well-written, well acted, witty show this one is. Richard Roxburgh is absolutely fantastic as Cleaver Green the irascible attorney.",1377475200,,147,5.7272727272727275

5766117,5,B00D09AYJK,"Crass with Aussie law humor class.
SUBTITLES added to the newer Acorn/RLJ released DVD.
Quote: Greene is a pathetic, alcoholic, drug-addled excuse of a man, a tragic example of everything gone wrong in the legal profession. Richard Roxburgh plays the character to perfection. Other cast characters also step up their neurotic behavior for Series 2; proving all those millions of lawyer jokes are truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth.
Greene defends the lowest low-life. It makes for truly odd-often humorous law drama. Britain deported convicts to Australia and this series finds and prosecutes them. Something to offend every viewer, with humor. Some good acting of people going rogue, and some notable guest stars too.
Greene is the Rake/R or barrister; and the v in the titles is a bit off, as the following name is not the opponent but barrister Greenes client of the episode. Great performances also playing Missy by Adrienne Pickering, Danielle Cormack (Wentworths Bea), Potter by Matt Day, Barney by Russell Dykstra, Sec Nicole by Kate Box, Wendy by Caroline Brazier, and this seasons new Attny Gen by Damien Garvey.

SDH Subtitles for each 58 min episode plus bonus. All episodes have a case related to the title, plus numerous ongoing character subplots. Expect diabolical duplicity.
[1] R v Mohammed ==Man strolls to Sydney Parliament then detonates. Why does his wife need barrister Green? Back seat limo affair with a politician (Toni Collette Emma In Her Shoes) gets hot for Green. Also guest starring Craig Hall (A Place to Call Home Dr Blake Mysteries) and Rhondda Findleton (Anzac Girls)
[2] R v Fenton ==AttnyGen Cal sabotages Greenes life; retaliation for his wifes affair. A case of retired teacher & high profile event crasher (Garry McDonald Mother & Son) goes to court as terrorism. QC is played by Deborah Kennedy (Doris in A Place to Call Home).
[3] R v Wooldridge & Anor ==Missys book, a call-girls life, gets folk guessing characters true names. Greene has dating & gambling issues (Robyn Malcolm). Look for Warwick Young (A Place to Call Home)
[4] R v Floyd ==Missys fianc Floyd needs Greene to take his treason case based on his internet leak website.
[5] R v Turner ==Missys a writeror murderess? Can/should Green leak the truth?
[6] R v Alford ==Greenes accused case is over cutting a privateand were not talking military. Lawyers Scarlet and Potter also have a crisis.
[7] Greene v Hole ==Potter/Scarlet a front-page affair photo-op. Other issues linger on.
[8] R v Greene ==Missy posts bail for Greene. Its a manslaughter upgrade & perhaps some jail time can save Greene from the gambling shark Kirsty. Yes there is a season 3; and 4; but Im waiting for the higher quality, subtitles added, Acorn release.",1498262400,,2746,4.969565217391304

5766120,5,B00D09AYJK,"Richard Roxburgh is great in his portrayl of Australian criminal defense attorney.  It's comedic, but more than a comedy as he brilliantly maneuvers the c j system.  Unfortunately, he can't maneuver his own life successfully, but this just displays a more than two dimensional character.",1481155200,,287,5.355555555555555

5766123,5,B00D09AYJK,"So glad we invested in this series.  It's ""something completely different"" in comedy and thoroughly enjoyable. The performance of the entire ensemble group, especially Roxburgh, was brilliant, as was the writing.  Will be watching this again over the years, for sure.",1453420800,,267,5.487804878048781

5766125,1,B00D09AYJK,"The show is great, no question there. The product however is another story. This applies to both Season 2 and 3: I agree with other reviews about the low quality of the video. Furthermore, it should be plain illegal to sell a DVD without any subtitles, especially since they exist (Netflix). Amazon, I know it is not your fault nor your responsibility, but you are in a great position and would have the power to boycott companies who insult and disrespect customers in that way. I cannot believe that there's not been any class action lawsuit from groups helping the people with hearing difficulties. At the very least Amazon and/or the seller should be responsible to post a big warning when no subtitles are available.",1430179200,,721,4.776

5766129,5,B00D09AYJK,"The Aussies have a real winner with clever Cleaver Greene;  great scenarios in this 2012 series hold one's attention throughout.  I especially enjoy the dialogue;  the Antipodeans (and British) have a knack for using the language.  Yes, there's some course language, nudity, sex and violence but it's not over done;  I find most American TV much more offensive than this.  The first (2010) and third (2014) series are equally as good;  certainly hope there are more.",1425772800,4,466,5.052631578947368

5766136,5,B00D09AYJK,"As I commented about season I, this Australian series is slightly different, but just as much fun as its American clone.  I'm glad to see that myFox is reintroducing the American version after they cancelled it a few months ago.  A new episode airs Friday, June 27, 2014 at 9:00pm.  In the NYC area, that's channel 5.1.

UPDATE: Contrary to what the local paper listed, the June 27th episode wasn't new. It was the episode that discloses tax attorney's (aka ""Harry Freaking Potter's"") love interest.",1403740800,,499,4.8352941176470585

5766140,5,B00D09AYJK,"Most entertaining series.  Riveting, bawdy and heavy doses of comedy, even though the themes involve very serious legal and personal matters.  Don't miss it.",1398816000,,157,5.5
5766141,5,B00D09AYJK,"too bad the american version can not live up to the down under version, plus you gotta love the accents",1398816000,,103,4.2
5766142,5,B00D09AYJK,"Like Rumpole of the Bailey, where John Mortimer had a dig at the establishment, so does Rake take a pot shot at the corruption in the State of New South Wales political system, and corporations and the law. For example, a retired English School teacher gets himself invited to Corporate meetings and speaks in their own language. The board think he is one of them, but he is sending up their inablity to speak and write in simple English terms. Of course Roxburgh is a brilliant actor, who is charming and gets himself in and out of trouble. It is extremely funny, but in a droll, dry and sophiscated manner. If you are Australian you will understand where the writers of the scripts got their ideas from. There is now a Royal commission into the NSW Labour(Democrat) Unions, but it has forced the Liberal Premier(republican) to resign. Also,a liberal federal  politican who was advisor to the former liberal Prime Minister has been dragged before the commission. Rake was written before this happened.

One episode touches on Islam, the clothes women wear and bombing. The story shows the prejudices faced by persons who belong to the faith and wear their particular clothes . The Muslim Woman is married to a very stupid Australian Anglo-Saxon, who has converted to her faith. Through humour it penetrates the prejudices more then any lecture can do. Naturally, there are more than two stories going on at the same time, as John Mortimer found very useful to do in his Rumpole series.

There is a episode where the writers have a dig at intelligence agents, when the body has been found of an activist like Ascange and Snowden. It makes fun of them. The ending is surprising. It is very funny , but it asks questions of us. For through humour, you can make a point. Also, there is a send up of the criminal classes. In Melbourne there was in the late 1990's through to 2000's gang warfare. This era has been made into a Mini series for commercial TV. This series is made for the ABC, which is like the BBC, England,or PBS, USA.

Other Australian TV series and films you may enjoy is Crownies, Wildside and The Circuit, about a magistrate who has to deal with Aborgines in the outback of West Australia, Broome etc. This is the state where I live. The films Lantana. and the Dish. Also, there is the great Mini series Cloudstreet, about two battling families, set during the 2nd World War and early 1950's. Based on the book by Tim Winton, a West Australian like me, who set the story in the city of Perth where I live. I actually demonstrated with Tim; we were trying to stop a construction taking place at Coral Bay. It's up  the West coast. However, Cloudstreet is one of Australia's most beloved books and films. You will see the Swan River, the suburbs of Claremont,  the University of Western Australia, and the city of Fremantle. All the places I visit. But they have kept alive their historical hertiage. Cheers All.",1398211200,3,2925,4.637065637065637
5766143,5,B00D09AYJK,This is well written and wonderfully entertaining.  I only wish it were still a series. Original. Clever and funny. Great,1393459200,,121,5.05

8588159,5,B00D09AYJK,"After watching the first series at least three times, we are now re-repeating watching series 2.  Roxburgh is really a fine artist and its impossible not to enjoy and like the character he plays.  He does so with great subtlety, aplomb and polish.  The character itself (Cleaver Greene) lacks all the aplomb, subtlety and polish one could possibly find in a character like Greene, but Roxburgh somehow endears the viewer to this character.  The character of Greene has a high, full throttle life libido and is completely unwilling and unreservedly pedal to the metal, full steam ahead without much care for consequences for himself or those closest to him.  The supporting cast is truly fantastic.  There isn't one weak cast member and without this stellar cast, the series may not be a potent as it is. Its fantastic and too bad we can't find anything like it here in the US.  So far, the story lines are good and as yet have not strayed into the ridiculous as we've seen (sadly) with the Dr. Blake series.",1513728000,3,1007,4.6875

8588163,1,B00D09AYJK,"This could be a superb show if it weren't so smarmily left-wing. It makes a few crudely telegraphed gestures at some kind of political even-handedness, but the sides are chosen and they're obvious, annoying, and undermine the show's strengths. A pity.",1499472000,,251,5.146341463414634
8588164,5,B00D09AYJK,"Rake, Series 2. In this production, which has been compared to the American television series BETTER CALL SAUL,  Richard Roxborough (MOULIN ROUGE, VAN HELSING)  turns in a champion performance. In a Silver Logie award-winning role,  as brilliant but self-destructive Sydney barrister Cleaver Greene (in Australia, as in the U.K., this means a lawyer allowed to practice in court). This top-rated, award-winning, legal dramatic comedy from Australia first aired on the Australian Broadcasting Corporations ABC1 in 2010, has aired for four seasons.  The criminal barrister Greene, a champion anti-hero, is many things to many people: an outrage, a mate, a wit, an unreliable ex-husband or friend or father, a tax cheat, a champion of lost causes, a gambling, cocaine, alcohol addict. His specialty: defending the indefensible. In the first season alone, from bigamists to cannibals to practitioners of bestiality.  In this season, alleged terrorists, psychotic teenage murderers, suicide bombers, hackers, traitors. So youve got to say, no matter what else, in this fresh, irreverent, darkly comic Australian courtroom dramedy, some pretty unusual cases reach the court.  The Guardian(UK) called it ""Scathing legal drama...teeming with sex, violence, and smart dialogue.""

As ever, in Series 2, Cleaver is on a constant search for higher highs, faster rushes, while achieving lower lows, attracting dangerous female liaisons, sworn enemies. He runs up huge gambling debts, makes enemies of gangsters and politicians alike. Makes a bitter opponent of the State of New South Wales powerful new Attorney General Cal McGregor,( Damian Garvey, JACK IRISH) when the barrister is videoed having sex with the Attorney Generals wife, AKA the States Premier, played by guest star Toni Collette ( MURIELS WEDDING, THE UNITED STATES OF TARA). Cleavers #1 lover, former prostitute Melissa (Missy) Partridge, (Adrienne Pickering, THE REEF) causes a national scandal by publishing a tell-all of her years in the oldest profession. Greenes partner/assistants wife Scarlet, played by Danielle Cormack, (WENTWORTH) cant forgive him for the harm the barrister has done to her and her marriage.  In addition to Collette, other guest stars this series include Don Hany (SERANGOON ROAD, JANET KING SERIES 3), Maeve Dermody (AND THEN THERE WERE NONE), Stephen Curry (CLOUD STREET) Martin Henderson, (GREYS ANATOMY).

Mind you, you would probably not want your daughter to marry Cleaver, or to go anywhere near him, in fact; nor would any sensible woman.  Yet women do  like Cleaver  we do so like bad boys. And, to be fair, he does have looks, charm, brains, a sense of humor, and, heaven knows, experience.  And it must be said that, despite his rakes lifestyle, his wit and charm have won him  many cases, lovers and friends over the years.
The box set, of which I received an advance copy from Acorn TV in return for an honest review, consists of three discs totaling approximately 462 minutes, with subtitles, thank goodness, for those of us not familiar with Oz-speak.  The series also contains bloopers, 5 Minutes with Cleaver Greene, (5 mins.), a behind-the scenes featurette (17 minutes).  Mind you, it also contains violence, strong language, nudity, drug use, and sexual situations: don't tell me you're surprised.  And bear it in mind, family viewers: best for mature viewers only.  Well, Mama and Poppa might not approve of this guy, and I doubt youd actually want him in your life, but he sure is entertaining.  And here I must make an admission: I enjoyed the first series, but was a bit blinded by just how strenuously Cleaver pursues anti-hero status. Was blinded to the brilliance of the writing, the sheer hilarity of many scenes. This prodiction is astoundingly entertaining, worthy of binge-watching if anything ever was.  We cant get enough of it in this house: even a recently visiting friend to whom I showed it begged me to send it on to her when I could. Dont deprive yourself.",1499472000,2,3977,5.2037617554858935
