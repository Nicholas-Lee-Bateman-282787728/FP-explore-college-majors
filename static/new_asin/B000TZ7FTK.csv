2912042,5,B000TZ7FTK,"This is one of the best shows on television.  I'm so excited to finally be able to own it and watch it again and again.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus is amazing as the star and so much fun to watch.  And the supporting cast is wonderful, especially the meanie moms, Tricia O'Kelley and Alex Kapp Horner.  It's a DVD you should buy to remind yourself what great television is and that the sitcom isn't dead, it just hasn't been done well for many years...until now.",1194480000,16,455,4.445783132530121

2912072,1,B000TZ7FTK,"hello,
  as funny as seinfeld was at the time, the jokes and innuendos were right on track.  this christine show had terrible jokes and the scenarios were not up to par with the quality of seinfeld.  the characters did not compare to the cast of seinfeld.  so, after watching the original seinfeld series back when it was on regular tv and for a binge months sessions this year, this christine show was a total let down.  the laugh track was awful, and the sound was not coordinated with the mouth movement.  at first it was slightly off, but as the show continued, it was off by at least two seconds and that is a lot.  the first episode was 21 minutes, but someone put in 8 more rewind minutes of repeats making this show 29 minutes...plus the worst voice/lip sync in the world.  was it worth it?  it was, but only to let us know that we did not want to see the rest of this christine series...despite critics reviews.  we know what we saw and did not like it.",1465862400,,962,4.288888888888889

2912093,2,B000TZ7FTK,"I really expected more. Really worn out story plots, cliched characters and an environment that I couldn't relate to at all. JLD looks great and her wardrobe is smart. The ex-husband, Richard, is a mope and the other characters are all over the top. There is nothing subtle about the gags or the characters, they all seem just too-too. It's blunt force comedy with finessed actors and I don't think it works.
Basically you have the adventures of a neurotic, narcissistic, fast talking, quick thinking, divorced woman who is coping really well with divorced life and she's shown at work and school and on dates. There just isn't anything interesting about it. Seinfeld was a rapid fire comedy that worked well because it was cast and shot in an environment that many people can relate to or want to relate to. There is nothing here that I can or want to relate to. JLD is wound tighter than a golf ball and that comes across as abrasive rather than edgy. Maybe they will find their groove but this first season is just Okay.",1426636800,,1023,4.595628415300546

2912105,5,B000TZ7FTK,"I found this show in it's second season when it first aired, and then real life got in the way so I would miss episodes, but I did try to catch it when it was on. It's very underrated and funny and it's nice to see two exes who don't hate each other or take the demise of their marrage out on each other. Plus the entire cast has brilliant comedic timing.

I could write walls of text about how much I love this show, but I'm going to keep it short and sweet. It's funny, it's got a good cast, and while old Christine does some of the stupid and embaressing stuff of sitcom tropes of old, the show has serious charm and the cast stands out. Julia and Clark have great chemistry.",1414195200,,678,4.059701492537314

2912109,5,B000TZ7FTK,"I loved this show when it aired, and was so surprised it was cancelled. The writing is superb and every show is funnier than the last. The cast has such great chemistry and their comedic timing is perfection.  The only error I found is that in the episode: Richie Has Two Mommies he supposedly meets new Christine for the first time, which is wrong, as in the previous episode Long Day's Journey, Richie is at the movies with his father and New Christine while Old Christine is at the restaurant alone. Just noticed that while watching this DVD and wondered if the episodes were in the wrong order, but evidently not. Thankfully this DVD had no issues with skipping, but the case came damaged.",1406332800,,693,4.588709677419355

Julia Louis-Dreyfuss is a funny lady in most everything she has done, and she has some wonderful co-stars that compliment each other.

2912126,2,B000TZ7FTK,The jokes are worthless and cliched and so is the humor.

I mean, sure, there's canned laughter (which is what I love about The Office - zero fake audience laughs), but for some reason it just worked in this show.  JLD is fantastic, and honestly, there wasn't a single bad character in the show.  We love Matthew and really grew to know this entire cast.  If you haven't watched it, grab Season 1 DVD or catch the syndicated shows now on Lifetime (and one other channel).  Her character is so relatable and you just feel for her and what she's going through.  I laugh out loud on every episode and that's a rarity for me with sitcoms.

Added to the mix are Christine's womanizing brother Matthew (Hamish Linklater), who lives with her, and acerbic best friend Barb (Wanda Sykes).

Season 1 includes such classic episodes as the pilot, where Christine meets the ""meanie moms"" at Ritchie's new private school; ""The Other F Word,"" where Christine crusades for diversity at Ritchie's homogenous school only to make a shocking discovery; and ""Long Day's Journey into Stan,"" which introduces the infamous recurring ""Sad Dad.""

I've never purchased an entire tv series' DVDs before but Christine's a keeper & I plan to collect each season. In season 1, you're introduced to each of the characters, a huge handful of hilarious flaws Christine lives with on a daily basis, and you'll probably find something in each episode that makes you realize you might be a little more like Old Christine than you'd like to admit... I enjoy the performances of every single cast member of this show, immensely - from Julia's (old Christine) amazing talent for scripted and physical comedy, to Hamish's (Matthew) low-key wit that is the perfect compliment to Christine's frenzied insanity.

I kept watching it and I discovered that it is a very, very funny show.

And a few ones are truly inspired (restaurant set, an immigration lawyer working for poor people looking for their American Dream, you need to see it to understand how great a moment that is).  But that's it by now.  I watched half of this first season' episodes and ""How I Met Your Mother"" is not.  However, the relationship between the characters seem (for once) adult-like, and for those people in their forties the subject matter of the series is going to be pretty relevant (hey, 3 stars is good!).",1215129600,4,590,4.528301886792453
2912161,4,B000TZ7FTK,"It pays to watch your first installment of ""The New Adventures of Old Christine"" with near-zero expectations. I have never been a major fan of Julia Louis Dreyfus, but that's only because I have never considered her a comic genius on the scale of say, Bea Arthur or Betty White. She was great on ""Seinfeld"", which of course is an icon of a show, but she has finally won my respect and adoration with ""Old Christine"", a show that could have sunk, but didn't.

Credit the writers for the shows' success. For all Dreyfus' comic timing and slapstick tendencies, she is often overlooked as a great deliverer of dialog, and this first season has a wondrous combination of one-liners as well as your typical American sitcom storylines. They don't always work, and mostly are either over-the-top or gleefully ludicrous, but they are always watchable. Some of the storylines did seem contrived, and you often have to admit that nothing like this could ever happen in real life (some of the situational comedy here is even more unbelievable than the most fantastical segments on ""Seinfeld""), but its all very, very riveting.

""Old Christine"", as you know by now, follows, Christine Campbell as a divorced mom who lives with her son and no-good brother. She is great friends with her ex-husband, and over the course of the first season we are introduced to ""New Christine"", who is her ex-husbands' sweet new girlfriend. The casting here is pitch perfect. The show pretty much follows this middle-class mom as she juggles work and family life, but its the huge supporting cast that make this successful - really, this show deserves some sort of ensemble cast award, because never since ""The Cosby Show"" have I seen a sitcom where every side-character actually adds value to the entire brand.

The best thing about this show is actually its' best actor : Hamish Linklater. I have been a huge underground fan of this mans' work for almost eight years now, and it was ""Christine"" that finally brought him into the spotlight. I must say that in the scenes with Julia Louis Dreyfus, its always Linklater that walks away with the best lines and indeed the loving attention of the camera - this man is just luminous on screen, and his rendition of the gangly younger brother with an eye for the ladies is quite something. He isn't yet my most favorite actor of all time (I'd have to see him in more stuff to judge his versatility for myself), but he's pretty much at the top. If you are at all interested in discovering a fresh new talent, then Hamish Linklater should do the trick for you.

Despite its' great knack for one-liners and the 'new story each week' syndrome, ""Old Christine"" manages to succeed by throwing some real surprises our way. The 'Meanie Moms' who were initially my favorite thing about the show, quickly became my second-favorite thing once Hamish Linklater got into the skin of his character, but they storylines with Julia became more and more far-fetched each week. One character who seemed sort of out of place was Wanda Sykes, as Julia's best friend Barb - you will have to watch Season Two to truly appreciate her characters' relevance in the show, but in the first season she's more of a 'guest star' than anything else.

Finally, while ""Old Christine"" will need at least another three or four solid seasons to prove its' status as ""Classic Television"", its already a staple for me. The success of a show, to me, is in its' ability to hold up to repeat viewing. The ONLY show that has done that for me so far, is ""The Golden Girls"", and to some extent, ""Mama's Family"". This show somewhat succeeds in that department - but there are clearly some episodes in this first season that I would never want to watch again - some of them aren't exactly memorable. But then again, there are some episodes (especially the Pilot, Episodes 6, 8, 11 and the Season Finale) which are definitely essential viewing.

Be aware that this first season only contains 13 episodes. This actually WAS the first season, and the number of episodes nearly doubled for the Second Season. Each episode runs between 21-25 minutes.

Obviously, since I'm a huge supporter of this show and the career of its star Hamish Linklater, I'm a little biased. Still, since I'm one of the few people drawn to ""Old Christine"" NOT due to the presence of Julia Louis Dreyfus, I believe its quite a recommendation that I've fallen for it so hard. This is indeed the way a sitcom should look like, in this day and age, and it has its solid share of dark humor, 'inappropriate' jokes, slapstick comedy, practical jokes, and hilarious storylines. I can't think of a better comedy on television in the last few years, so I recommend that you buy this gem and discover a sparkling new treasure.

Four and a Half Stars.",1211760000,2,4779,4.70131421744325
2912162,5,B000TZ7FTK,Highly recommend.  I can't remember the last show that made me laugh out loud like this one does.  I hope there is more seasons to come.,1208822400,,136,4.1923076923076925
2912163,5,B000TZ7FTK,"My love for the comedic, clumsy Christine Campbell has overcome my love for the sarcastic Elaine Benes.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus portrays Christine Campbell to a T, making me forget all about Elaine's witticisms.  For every rung on the ladder Christine climbs, she falls down two more.  Christine isn't the ""straight"" character with a lot of goofy sidekicks.  SHE is the main attraction herself and is not to be missed.  Her friends and family merely augment her wackiness.  The addition of Wanda Sykes only makes Christine's antics more hilarious, and when they're together, they become modern day Lucy and Ethel.

On the rare occasions that CBS actually puts new episodes of ""Christine"" on the air (hello, full season, anyone?), I am there.  And I will continue to buy her DVDs for as long as they make them (which, sadly, I doubt will be for long with greedy, CSI-loving, reality show-doting CBS execs in charge).

In the meantime, please purchase a copy of ""The New Adventures of Old Christine"" and show your support!  You won't regret it!  It won't hurt your wallet -- only your sides from laughing too hard!",1208822400,,1109,4.877005347593583

2912165,5,B000TZ7FTK,"I was so happy to recieve the first season on DVD! The New Adventures of Old Christine is such a great show, much due to the outstanding and absolutely fearless acting of Julia Louis-Dreyfus in the lead. She is also surrounded by a very talanted cast and the writing is fresh (even though as many have pointed out, the format is traditional sitcom). The best thing with owning this DVD is of course being able to watch the episodes over and over again, but there is also an interesting interview feature, where mainly Julia Louis-Dreyfus and the series creator Kari Lizer share their thoughts, but also the rest of the cast, director Andy Ackerman and others comment on writing, acting, directing etc. And then there's a blooper part. This is fun to watch, but I have seen funnier blooper features from other series. This can probably be explained by the fact that this was the very first season of the show and that there were only 13 episodes. Still fun, though! Some previously un-aired scenes are also included and constitues an extra treat.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus certainly deserved the Emmy she got for her performance during this season. I especially love ep. 5 ""I'll show you mine"", which features Christine's relationship with Burton and shows how Julia Louis-Dreyfus acts supremely both comedically and dramatically, and ep. 13 ""A fair to remember"" which displays the same thing and also captures very well the tension in her relationship with the ex-husband Richard. But it is hard to pick favourites. I love all episodes and enjoy also storylines featuring Barb, Matthew, new Christine and the meanie moms. Another favourite episode of mine this season is ep. 10 ""No fault divorce"" where the neurotic character of Christine is illustrated delightfully. Before I start picking every episode of this season as my favourite I'll conclude by recommending this DVD for purchase for anyone who loves intelligently written and well-performed sitcoms. And if you don't love Julia Louis-Dreyfus already, you will after wathching this.",1203465600,3,2035,5.0385756676557865

 6  THE OTHER F WORD - Christine takes it upon herself to diversify Ritchie's white white school.
 7  LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO STAN - Solo and so low.  After she breaks up with Burton, Christine discovers dining out alone is no treat.
 8  TEACH YOUR CHILDREN WELL - Four hundred dollas a guest!?  Christine rebels against extravagant children's birthday parties.
 9  RITCHIE HAS TWO MOMMIES - ...But only one of them is nuts!  Christine freaks when New Christine shows up at Parents' Night.
10  NO FAULT DIVORCE - Why did Christine and Richard get divorced?  Maybe for a reason Christine never knew about.
11  EXILE ON LAME STREET - Afraid of what Ritchie will be exposed to at a Rolling Stones concert, Christine tries to crash the event.
12  SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS ARE PORTUGUESE - Working women of the world, unite.  Christine is thrilled to meet another working mom at Ritchie's school.
13  A FAIR TO REMEMBER - Christine's hopes of rekindling her romance with Burton are dashed when she learns he has a new girlfriend ... named Christine.
