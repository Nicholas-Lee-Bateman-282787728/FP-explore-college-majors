8096099,4,B000C6XI06,"Ok early 60's Spanish-French-Italian made, English-dubbed Early California western adventure.  After the US government takes control of California Zorro has to come out of hiding to fight murderous soldiers and an evil colonel.  Only the new governor is a decent sort.  I ordered a DVD-R and the quality is only OK.  The picture is framed all around by black bands, the color is adequate and the film needs re-mastering.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1467590400,,456,5.026666666666666
8096100,3,B000C6XI06,"Another rehash of the basic Zorro story.  This Italian/Spanish production has been edited and dubbed into English, along with being shown in full screen on the DVD.  The quality is decent and very watchable.  I have not been able to locate any other editions, so this will have to do.  Platinum Disc Edition.",1453334400,,308,4.754716981132075

1962's ZORRO THE AVENGER (or LA VENGANZA DEL ZORRO) is a piece of Italian/Spanish produced cinema, and, going by the heavily edited version I just saw, is a waste of everyone's time. Of course, should the original picture show up, I might revise my opinion. But I doubt it. But, anyway, in this hybrid Spaghetti western/swashbuckler, Frank Latimore stars as Don Jos&eacute; de la Torre, a dandified nobleman who, under the guise of El Zorro, fights for justice in Old California.

Here's the plot: With California having recently joined the Union, American troops are now quite a common sight. But, with rampant abuse of power perpetrated by the dastardly (and expressionless) Colonel Clarence, these U.S. soldiers are mistrusted and regarded by most of the old community as ""Yankee invaders."" Of course, it also doesn't help that several of these lowly soldiers actually are the villainous sort. Zorro enters the picture when he attempts to help an old friend who's framed for the crimes of burgling a mission and murdering a priest. Zorro goes on to discover that it's all part of a conspiracy to prevent amicable relations between the citizens of Old California and the Union. Of course, it all culminates in a sword fight.

As mentioned, Zorro is played by Frank Latimore. Some background: Latimore was an American actor who, early in his acting career, had roles in several Hollywood films. But he made his bones when he relocated overseas in 1949 and became heavily involved with European cinema. During that time, Latimore was known primarily for taking on swashbuckling parts. Which is when he was offered Zorro, at which point he should've turned up his nose and walked away. He didn't, and this waste of celluloid came into being.

At an hour and 16 minutes, this film must've been heavily butchered. The editing is disjointed, the dubbing sucks. Maybe ZORRO THE AVENGER improves when seen in its original version. But if it does, it can't be by much. The story, with its creaky pace and formulaic plotting, just isn't interesting. And this Zorro differs from the other Zorros I've seen onscreen, and not in a good way.

This Zorro, first of all, chooses to not wear a cape, which automatically loses him about 20 points for dash and style. His mask covers everything below his eyes, just like one of them old Wild West stick-em-up bandits. And his costume boasts a string tie on a white collared shirt (white shirts, by the way, are not recommended for skulking). As Don Jose de la Torre, he also has a tendency to way too often lose his facade of foppishness. And, unlike the iconic Zorro, this version doesn't hesitate to employ firearms. Too, for someone of his dynamic fighting prowess, he's got no business being disarmed, not to mention getting snuck on (and by a girl!). Latimore does his best, but, in the pantheon of actors who've played Zorro, he ends up somewhere near the bottom. He really needed to tone down the performance a bit. Or, to put it another way, as Zorro was carving his Z's, I was snoring my own (Ok, Zorro never actually uses his sword to carve out a ""Z"" - yet one more way this Zorro poorly differs from the rest). I did, however, enjoy Zorro's smirking, purposeful unmasking of his identity to an opponent moments before he dispatched him. That was a bit cruel of Zorro, but it was a nice touch.

Word to the wise, don't confuse ZORRO THE AVENGER with 1959's ZORRO, THE AVENGER, which stars Guy Williams and collects 6 episodes from the excellent Disney series and had a sequence in which Don Diego's father is imprisoned (the product description on my dvd case suggests that plot line, but it never happens in the Italian film). ZORRO THE AVENGER instead offers up a hero who doesn't inspire and adventure which doesn't rouse or entertain. There are three lovely women here, but our hero doesn't do anything about it, thereby rendering him fully useless. After this poor effort, someone had the gall to churn out a sequel shortly after, titled L'OMBRA DI ZORRO (THE SHADOW OF ZORRO). Trust me, if you must see an Italian produced Zorro flick, try out the Alain Delon version. That one's pretty good.",1196467200,3,4310,4.778523489932886
