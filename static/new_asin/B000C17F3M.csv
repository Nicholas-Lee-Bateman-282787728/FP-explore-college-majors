It's not as good seeing it on a TV, even if you've got a huge screen it's not an IMAX, but it's still easily one of the greatest films ever made. The sheer mind-boggling effort of just making the footage is almost inconceivable to me, what these people went through was staggering. It's beautiful, it's compelling and you should damn well watch it.",1327190400,2,475,4.348314606741573
