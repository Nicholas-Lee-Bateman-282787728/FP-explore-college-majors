2736162,4,B00005Y40Z,"Towards his final years, Horror icon Boris Karloff always said to interviewers that he would never stop acting and would die in harness which ,unfortunately, would be the case. Before that would happen, he did have the fortune of acting with two young film makers who would utilize him in the best of his final roles, Director Peter Bogdanovich's 'TARGETS'-1968 and Director Michael Reeve's 'THE SORCERERS'-1967.  The 23 year old Reeves was cutting his teeth in film production and his persistence and love of film would have him complete the foreign 'CASTLE OF THE LIVING DEAD'- 1964 and proceed to his first feature 'THE SHE BEAST'-1965 with actress Barbara Steele.  Producer Tony Tenser at Tigon Films was always looking for independent film makers looking for backing.  American Producer Patrick Curtis who was married to Raquel Welch at that time had two scripts which he wanted Reeves to direct.  Putting those scripts on hold , Curtis and Reeves came up with the basic plot of 'THE SORCERERS' co authored with Tom Baker and through an acquaintance, it came across Tenser's desk. Karloff was no slouch to this type of script having mind swapped decades back in Britain with Director Robert Stevenson's excellent 'THE MAN WHO CHANGED HIS MIND'-1936.  Reeves had Karloff in mind for this film and they got along wonderfully .  The film emerges as a chilling prospect of the older generation wishing for eternal youth which theme would eventually peak in Director Bernard McEveety's chilling masterpiece 'THE BROTHERHOOD OF SATAN'- 1970.  It also stars Catherine Lacey in a scene stealing performance and Reeves's friend Ian Ogilvy who would appear in all three of Reeves films. You will also glimpse a 17 year old Susan George in her first feature appearance as a doomed girl friend of Ogilvy's.  Appearing as a sixties time capsule with its rock music and psychedelic lighting, the film shows Director Reeves honing his craft which would come to fruition in his masterpiece 'WITCHFINDER GENERAL' aka 'THE CONQUEROR WORM'- 1968 and who got Horror icon Vincent Price to emote one of his greatest performances. With brilliant editing by David Woodward and superb photography by John Mantell, Reeves orchestrates his mind swap plot with a snap-crackle-pop pace making it more tragic that Reeves's life was cut off too soon due to a drug overdose just before he was to direct 'THE OBLONG BOX'.  The film has been rarely seen having been released on VHS by Allied Artists back in the eighties in a horrible transfer and badly cut (surprisingly , there is no nudity in the film and has some minor gore scenes).  Warner Archive has released it in its first DVD transfer in the United States in its proper 1.85 ratio but no negative clean up which makes the film look more cutting edge than ever.  Unfortunately, their are no extras, it would have been nice to see a feature on Director Reeves or even an original trailer but it's not to be.  Warner, however, deserves kudos for giving Karloff fans a glimpse of one of his final performances even through the pain he must have been feeling in his scenes (you can see him wincing as he sits in a chair or walks across a room).  He was a real trooper and a brilliant artist who along with Director Michael Reeves created a unique be-careful-what-you- wish-for thriller.",1363392000,10,3313,4.8736654804270465
2736163,3,B00005Y40Z,"A decent presentation of an older Karloff film,  The director best known for ""Witchfinder General"" (aka The Conqueror Worm) delivers an interesting tale of an older couple playing mind control with the younger generation.  Very dated along with the sound that is less less than to be desired.  This is probably the best copy available and such a title would probably not command a remastering.  Probably for Michael Reeves (the director) and Karloff fans only.  This is not as impressive as Reeves' final film as mentioned.",1358726400,,523,5.034883720930233
2736164,4,B00005Y40Z,"I hadn't seen this movie in at least 20 years, and was very pleasantly surprised at how well it held up.  It's very well engineered to take best advantage of its performers' strengths, and Reeves has some nice, subtle directorial touches that tell the story well.  (For example, look at the framing, editing, and body language in the scene where the elderly couple discuss how to handle their 'discovery'; Karloff, slightly off center with his hand to his face as if to physically block out his onscreen spouse, her squarely center frame and leaning forward eagerly.)  A neglected minor gem of 60s genre cinema that hopefully now get some overdue attention.  The burn on demand DVD won't be confused with the latest hi def big budget Hollywood output, but looks quite nice given the age of the material.",1356998400,2,803,4.797101449275362
2736165,4,B00005Y40Z,"I first saw this movie at a drive-in back in 1971 along with several other features which I don't recall. Having been a Boris Karloff fan since the age of 8, I had to see it and I remember being struck at the time by how old he looked (he was 79 then and had been dead for 2 years by the time I saw it) and by how cool it would be if you really could experience other people's sensations (the principal plot device of this film). It was only much later that I realized that THE SORCERERS was made by Michael Reeves the same man responsible for WITCHFINDER GENERAL.

Just how familiar Reeves was with Karloff's ""Mad Doctor"" films, I don't know (there are definite echoes of 1936's THE MAN WHO CHANGED HIS MIND), but THE SORCERERS is certainly an interesting and appropriate update on that theme. An elderly hypnotist and his wife (the ""sorcerers"" of the title) develop a system of advanced hypnosis that enable them to not only control a young man (Ian Ogilvy) but to feel what he feels. Things ultimately veer out of control as the embittered wife wants to experience more and more sensations including murder (a young Susan George is the victim) which leads to tragedy for everyone concerned.

The Swinging 60s setting (the film was made in 1967) is dated to be sure but fascinating nonetheless. Karloff is his usual fine self even at the age of 79 and crippled by arthritis but it is Catherine Lacey as his wife who gives a truly remarkable performance. She reportedly hated her role just as Vincent Price hated his in WITCHFINDER GENERAL yet Reeves proved himself right in the end as both performances are among their best. A truly fine example of what can be done on a meager budget with a multi-layered screenplay and a good role for Boris at the end of his career. This is the American Allied Artists release. Thanks to Warner Archive for finally making it available on Region One for the American market.",1350086400,7,1911,4.520231213872832
2736166,1,B00005Y40Z,"To this date April 23rd, 2008 my great wish is still that one day someone will release She Beast, The Ghost, Castle of the Living Dead AKA Crypt of Terror, The Sorcerers and The Long Hair of Death in their correct aspect ratios and with a decent crisp transfer with audible sound for region 1 sales. The Movie gets 4 stars from me personally.",1208908800,3,342,4.359375

8169245,4,B00005Y40Z,Lot's of reviews (mixed) of the content-just want to comment on quality of the Warner Archives release. Of course it is DVD-R (burned) but nice silk-screening on the disc & packaging art-work is quite nice. The print (16x9 enhanced) had no restoration so has some extreme instances of dirt & occasional scratches but not through-out the film (in fact for a film from 1967 it looks pretty darn good). No breaks or jump-cuts & the sound is OK (not home-theater stereo quality but I did not find any obnoxious hissing or out of balance sound effects). Worth the price to complete your Michael Reeves collection (I didn't think I'd EVER get to see this film so I'm happy).,1408406400,3,668,4.669491525423729
8169246,4,B00005Y40Z,"this has quite often been described as Karloff's last great movie. It was quite a creep show, although a bit hampered by the incredibly low budget. Karloff rarely played a truly evil character and he is again the nice guy here. Great bit part by Susan George and some interesting action and fighting scenes made more graphic by the lack of special effects. Director Reeves really hit his peak with Witchfinder General.",1393372800,,418,4.819444444444445
8169247,5,B00005Y40Z,"Michael Reeves The Sorcerers (1967), starring Boris Karloff, became a barely noticeable cult film in a cinematically innovative era. A few prominent, hip critics took note of Reeves, and, in some quarters, predictions were made that he could become a horror director of the caliber of James Whale, Tod Browning, Jacques Tourneur, or Terence Fisher.

Reeves had only made one previous film, the low budget The She Beast (1966) starring horror icon Barbara Steele, but it was imitative of Mario Bavas work and received scant notice. In contrast, The Sorcerers was stylish, quirky, and unique, although it was also low budget and barely made a profit. Still, it resulted in Reeves being given a larger bankroll to work with in his third film: the critical and box office hit Witchfinder General (1968) starring Vincent Price.

Reeves death of a drug overdose at twenty-five, shortly before the release of Witchfinder General, affected that films reputation. Reeves was hailed as a tragic auteur in the James Dean mold. Since then, Witchfinder General has long been lauded as one of Prices finest films. Its was considerably helped by the actor/star himself, who listed it as one of his two personal favorites, along with Theater of Blood (1973). Having a historical subject, Witchfinder General defies its period, is highly esteemed, frequently revived, and has been readily available throughout the video age.

In light of Witchfunder General s reputation, The Sorcerers was considered a lesser, obscure effort, partly because it seemed more dated and did not have a vital star to promote it (Karloff died a mere week before Reeves). Nor did the actors fans promote it. Instead, of Karloffs late films, they waxed sentimental about Peter Bogdanovichs Targets (1968), feeling that film was a truer coda for the King of Horror. It was only this year that The Sorcerers was finally made available on DVD as part of the Warner Archive collection.

The aged and poverty stricken Professor Marcus Monserrat (Karloff) is a long publicly disgraced hypnotist who invents a machine (cue sci-fi mumbo jumbo) which allows him and his wife Estelle (the delightfully vile Catherine Lacey) to project their consciousness into the minds of others. The Monserrats live in a dilapidated London flat during the swinging 60s (cue sex, drugs, and rock n roll), and Estelle is corrupted from bitterness due to her husbands fall from grace. The couple find a willing guinea pig for their gizmo in stud Michael (Ian Ogilvy). Michael, bored with sex, drugs, and rock n roll, agrees to be strapped into the Professors mind-altering gizmo (cue psychedelia). Although clearly a product of the 60s, The Sorcerers is imbued with a stylish, compact, contemporary impudence that transcends mere period novelty.

Once the couple psyche into Mikes experiences, Estelle begins making up for lost years. She quickly becomes addicted to the experience, which causes her to become increasingly imbalanced. After she forces Mike into hedonism, theft, and murder, a battle of wills between Estelle and her husband leads into Being John Malkovich (1999) and Scanners (1981) territory.

The Sorcerers stands out as a respite from Karloffs humiliating last years. Although seriously ill, the actor gives an admirably subdued performance that rises to a crescendo in the final showdown with his wife. As good as Karloff and Ogilvy are, it is Lacey who steals the film.

The lower budget trappings actually enhance the grittiness of a film that seems to be saying something about the jaded nihilism of the I, me, mine culture (well, at least it noticed it).",1383868800,4,3610,5.129251700680272
8169248,4,B00005Y40Z,"Boris Karloff stars as a disgraced Professor Marcus Montserrat in this very interesting tale of mind control. This film is the rarest of the only 3 films directed by Michael Reeves before his apparent suicide at only 24 in 1969. Karloff and his wife, excellently played by Catherine Lacy, are an elderly poor couple who lure a bored Mod Londoner, who is looking for some extra kicks, to their apartment where they administer experiments in mind control. The youth's name is Michael Roscoe, and is well-played by Ian Ogilvy. The couple have invented a machine that can control other's actions and then transfer the sensations back to the couple. The Professor's intentions are good but his maniacal wife has other ideas. She uses her superior will power to overcome her husbands and subsequently starts with speeding on a motorcycle. She then utilizes Michael to steal an expensive fur coat which then leads to controlling Michael to actually commit murder. As I already mentioned, Karloff had intended to use the machine for the benefit of all, but his wife Estelle, who is deranged and intrigued by the machine's deviant potential, has more sinister ideas in mind. The film can certainly be taken as a cautionary, as well as a cynical take on the dangers of youthful hedonism. The story takes place in 60's Mod London, with mini-skirts, groovy underground dancing clubs and 60's bands. Actually, this dated the film, but to me, in a good way. When one thinks about it, the premise of controlling someone else's mind and then sharing their sensations is actually quite fascinating to me. Overall, the acting is quite good, the direction and the cinematography is excellent, and the editing is very good. As noted, the film is in color, with the transfer being very good. The running time is 87 minutes. It is in Widescreen,16x9 1.78:1. It is indeed good news to finally have this released on dvd. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! SMRZ!!",1382400000,3,1924,4.904907975460123
8169249,4,B00005Y40Z,How long do you think this can last? Well for an older Boris it will be infinity as he turns you on as Professor Montserret. The plot was good within a Swingin' London as a backdrop. Catherine Lacey put on a show of power as his wife. Nice pairing of actors. Enjoyed the movie,1374278400,,276,4.12962962962963
8169250,3,B00005Y40Z,"This film had many aspects to it and seem to promise much until it went way over the top. Boris Karloff (looking like all of his 79 years by 1960s standards) plays a superhypnotist named Marcus. His wife Estelle who looks even older, played by Catherine Lacey, is his partner in mind control.
A young man (Ian Ogilvy, THE SAINT, etc.) is coaxed into allowing himself to participate in a hypnotic experiment that will allow Boris and Catherine (Boris & Natasha?) to control him even from afar and live vicariously through him after decades of deprivation.

Things take a horrific turn when Boris's frustrated wife gains the upper hand (mind) and is able to make Ogilvy do murderous things. That's how she gets her kicks. Boris, however, wanted his scientific discovery available to the general old age public so that it (they) could once again experience those positive things that they once enjoyed in their youthful past. By today's standards, what the ""elderly"" are able to do in their ""Golden Years"" makes this movie's premise almost laughable. The two can feel every sensation experienced by Ogilvy (except when he practically chain smokes! - which probably would have killed B&C outright or eventually overwhelmed them). They can ""feel"" murder but not smoking.

How Boris got the funds to build all of his ""scientific equipment"", which looks appropriately enough like something out of an earlier Universal ""Frankenstein"" movie, is never explained. It certainly must have cost a bundle. If the couple had spent it instead on having a good time, they never would have had to build it in the first place. Oh! Wait...I nearly forgot that this was a movie.

Some of the basic problems of this movie, which should at least get some credit for contrasting how the old saw themselves at that time compared to the young, has to do with basic behavioral situations. Supposedly, one would not murder someone even under a hypnotic spell if it was not in his nature. Therefore, it's a puzzlement over how easy it was to get Ogilvy to do it.  What possessed Catherine to act in the specific way that she did? Wouldn't Boris for all his knowledge and insight have caught on long before, after knowing her for at least 50 years?! Evidently, she wanted power more than enjoyment; in which case, she should have married someone else. While her performance was indeed ""mesmerising"", it was also frustrating for the viewer who begins to feel like Boris while his wife goes about her merry murdering. And didn't the neighbors hear anything when all the equipment was functioning or when Catherine destroyed it all? Or, are we to assume that nothing but deaf old people surrounded them.

If you really want to enjoy Boris in his later years, watch some of the various horror movie parodies by Vincent Price and Peter Lorre.",1372982400,,2806,4.8375
