7363795,5,B013FA0EQ6,"Fascinating to hear why a number of atheists, agnostics, and many Protestants converted to Catholicism.  It also included why fallen away Catholics returned to the Catholic Church.  Excellent for people lookiing for peace and/or tend to get their opinions of what the Catholic Church is like from the media and learn why their conceptions are changed to positive ones.",1446249600,16,368,5.220338983050848
7363796,5,B013FA0EQ6,"I downloaded this documentary and watched it at the first opportunity.  There is nothing like conversion stories to remind cradle Catholics how blessed were are to be members of the Church.  I cried at several points in this film, and I am not a crier.  It was just so touching to hear people share how they came to realize that the Catholic Church teaches the truth with an authority that can be traced back to Jesus Himself.  These stories feature people from a wide range of backgrounds, from the ""spiritual but not religious"" woman, to the atheists, to the men who had been raised Catholic but left the Church because they had never really understood what the Church was.  If you are wondering why anyone would become Catholic, this video is worth watching.  If you want a chance to have your Catholic faith renewed and your gratitude for the Church increased, this video is worth watching.  Highly recommended.",1446163200,17,915,4.753164556962025

7363801,2,B013FA0EQ6,"More troubled by this film than convinced. There are numerous problems with the presentation. I felt the participants were indeed honest in their beliefs, but I differ with the version of the Catholic faith presented here.

 I will mention two issues I had with this. One, all the participants seemed to have totally put their rational minds on a shelf somewhere and decided that doubt was completely NOT a part, and an important part, of their faith journeys.

My second complaint was this. Given a recent Pew research poll which set the ethnic make up of the Catholic Church at roughly 59% white and 34% Hispanic, with about 6% Asian and African, the absence of people of color bothered me most. I totally get the participants zeal in wanting to affirm their ""new lives"", but honesty and clarity in presentation is quite important. These are intelligent people presented here. But the lack of ""Convinced"" people of color does not do justice to the almost 1/2 the population of the Catholic Church.",1525737600,,999,4.830409356725146

7363816,5,B013FA0EQ6,"For anyone seeking to understand why those outside of Catholicism convert, this documentary by Donald Johnson is a must-see. Although each person's story is unique, the driving factor is the discovery of objective Truth. CONVINCED is a great resource for reaching out to those outside the Church. These are real people, with a real desire to know God in His fullness. Among them are scholars, authors, clergy and lay people. Their stories are engaging and compelling. CONVINCED is a must for your video library.",1505088000,,511,5.095238095238095
7363817,4,B013FA0EQ6,"Well, I'm a cradle Catholic who, apart from an abortive stint with the OCA and Antiochian Orthodox, has been going to mass all my life. Most of the people in this film are converts from fervent evangelical Protestantism or staunch atheism, who naturally find being Catholic exponentially better than their former way of being. Because it clearly is. Engaging in apologetics with Protestants or listening to the likes of Richard Dawkins talk about religion is like taking an aesthetic and spiritual bat to my head and heart these days. It's just too inane, too thuddingly ponderous and dull, I just can't do it anymore.

It's nice to see their passion here, to hear them express their love and enthusiasm for the Church. These are people who are reactive. They met the Faith and engaged it, and because they were honest and recognized Christ they were changed. After all these years a well-delivered conversion tale still moves me.  There's a place for these sorts of testimonies, we should hear more of them. Why is this thing we call the Church meaningful? Who is this Christ we speak so much of? Tell us. Tell us of him. Tell us why you come, why you care. These are love stories, and they touch me.

Because let's face it, so much of American Catholic culture is inert. So much of it is mediocre and tame, tepid and suburbanized. The lame brained iconoclasm and babbitry of mainstream culture have made so much of the Church anodyne, to the point that it feels a bit of prison and penance to me these days, having to move through it. Gnosticism, nominalism and hedonism are killing us; and too few even know what ails us, or care to seek a cure.

These people know what the Church is, the Spirit she is animated by, the Messiah she proclaims. They know that to know Christ is mysterious joy. They communicate that here, and I thank them. I got to praying while watching this, and some of the torpor I've been feeling lately lifted..

Because the Faith isn't a bunch of rules to obey, an ideology toprofess or political platform to impose on others. In fact, it is the antithesis of those things. As one of the people here say, Christ entered into hell and broke death's bonds. Evil could not withstand Love, darkness could not overcome the Light.

To be Christian can't be reduced to professing a creed, embracing a moral code or associating with the right correct thinking people. The Church isn't a political party. It is life in Christ. It is the Cross. It is entering into the life of Love himself.

That so many people never understand this is a bizarre mystery. That the Church too often fails to communicate it is a profound tragedy. That so many people today are ignorant, jaded and indifferent to this great Joy is the misery of our age.

This film is a light on a basket. It gave me heart, some cheer. I'm glad I saw it, glad that I am in communion with such beautiful people. If you like me need some encouragement, you may find it here. If you are interested in the Faith, these are stories you would benefit hearing.",1504656000,2,3032,4.560661764705882

7363826,5,B013FA0EQ6,"This was well put together on how agnostics, atheist, protestants, and even catholics found a renewed interest and truth of their understanding of the catholic church. In some ways it is a powerful telling of apologetics, but obvious towards a catholic tilt. To cover all the arguments of why these people featured were convinced would take a lot more time, and so it highlights really the tip of an iceburg of deep traditions, theology, and teachings. Really 2000 year history of convincing evidence is hard to cover in an hour and half. Never mind a lot of mis-information propagated by other christian denominations or conspiracy theorists about world domination.

What this movie does is tells the story of little miracles and simple truths these people found in the search for an answer.",1496620800,,792,5.0

7363839,4,B013FA0EQ6,"I've watched this numerous times and find it very powerful.  However, it does not address the Catholic Church's utter discounting of women (as inferior helpmates to men, or the fact that early church fathers tossed out supposed ""gnostic"" texts that attested to Jesus's esteem for women, as disciples and as human beings, for example).  Unbelievable to me that other matters of ancient prejudice and ignorance should be judiciously counterbalanced by church doctrine yet matters involving women are allowed to stand (misogyny is alive and well, 2000+ years later).  A researcher, I conducted an informal survey of my own and found, by calling around to different Catholic parishes that the majority of women (and many men too, such as priests) think the Church errs in not ordaining women.  Women, many of whom toil long and hard in service to their parishes, wait patiently for Rome to recognize them. The fact that these matters are not even addressed in the film, discussed by intelligent people, especially women, in considering the validity of Catholicism I find hard to believe.  In such matters the Anglican/Episcopal Church has a much more progressive/inclusive policy.

I say this because I wrestle with it (along with attitudes towards homosexuality).  I'm very attracted to Mother Mary and the saints, as well as the liturgy/sacraments, the idea of confession, SO much about Catholicism appeals to me, sigh- the attitude towards women is one rather large stumbling block worthy of mention.  But aside from this glaring oversight, the film is otherwise excellent.

Note: Please don't click ""not helpful"" because you don't agree with my opinions, or because the acceptance of Church doctrine, after the fact, is second-nature to you now, a given.  This film is targeted towards non-Catholics wanting to learn more about the Catholic faith, seekers.  My central point, a valid one, is that most people (educated women in particular), when considering Catholicism would seek justification for church doctrines that proscribe different roles for women than men, or at the very least clarification of the rationale behind those that profoundly impact women's lives (e.g., no birth control).  The film features intelligent, educated women who never allude to such matters, which I don't believe for a moment that they wouldn't consider, grapple with.  Any thinking person would.  I'm sure they DID, but the filmmakers left it out, not wanting to open that particular can of worms.  Such matters are important to me and the purpose of my review is to let others with the same concerns know of the oversight.  As I stated, the film is otherwise superb in covering other important issues, e.g., apostolic succession, salvation by good works, honoring Mary, relativism vs. Church and Biblical authority, etc.",1486425600,,2807,5.232142857142857
7363840,3,B013FA0EQ6,"I watched this movie to gain better understanding into a Catholic friend. To that end, the movie was a great success. It does not set out to make a convert of you, but lays out the case that others found compelling. I was raised as a Jew and did not find myself even slightly tempted (and there were things some of the converts said that I found a bit unsettling), but I enjoyed the movie and thought it was well done.",1484784000,8,418,4.172839506172839

It was a wonderful confirmation for me that Catholicism is the true Church started by Christ, and it contains the fullness of the truth.  I was shocked at the people's misconceptions about Catholicism before they began a personal quest to understand it more completely.  It made me realize that I need to try harder to share my Catholic faith more with my non-Catholic brothers and sisters.  What a gift the Catholic Church is.

With so much garbage being shovelled out into theaters by the movie industry it was nice to experience this film in the theater and to witness the stories of people from all different walks of life!  I honestly was moved by the stories shared and the beautiful use of Christian art interwoven throughout the movie.  For anyone who has wondered why anyone would become Catholic, this is a great film to begin to find an answer to that question!  I highly recommend this for Catholics who want to be reminded about the great story we have to share about the life we have with Christ in the Church and for those who are not Catholic, that they may hear the stories of those who had legitimate questions and 'problems' with the Catholic Church who found answers and a deeper walk with Christ through the journey!",1465689600,4,1031,4.516129032258065

7363875,3,B013FA0EQ6,"On the one hand 'Convinced' presents a positive approach to telling the stories of why some people have converted to Catholicism. The people that were interviewed have interesting stories and the ""experts"" interviewed present a good, although predictable, foundation. The documentary is well presented and produced.

However, my biggest problem with the video is no where does anyone address all the issues facing the Catholic church. No one interviewed answered questions such as ""How do you justify in your mind the fact the Catholic church covered up years and years of child abuse?"" Or ""how do you justify the Catholic church's claim of papal infallibility?"" or ""How do you justify in your mind the controversy surrounding Vatican 2?' or ""What were your thoughts when the Vatican changed the rules governing sainthood to give a fast path to certain preferred individuals?""

There are many more questions that could have been asked, but instead, the documentary presents a completely one sided view of the Catholic church and completely ignores the dark side of the church they claim was created by Jesus.

This documentary is worthy, but keep in mind it is a very prejudiced view.",1458604800,9,1184,5.124352331606218

7363889,1,B013FA0EQ6,"Most of the Convinced video is testimonies from former Protestants who became dismayed by the great number of Protestant sects and their lack of agreement with each other.  I can see how a committed Christian who longed for authority would be attracted to the Catholic Church's antiquity and its apostolic lineage to the earliest Christians.  Jennifer Fulwiler made a good point about the Bible not offering clear directions, and someone else noted that while it's enticing to believe that the Holy Spirit can guide the Christian, when 5 Christians each disagree with each other about what the Bible says, this indicates that it's probably a mistake to exclusively rely on personal inspiration to understand God's will.

And therefore, what a wonderful thing to discover that there's a Church that goes back to the days of Jesus, and tells us precisely how to interpret the Bible and how to live, so at to please God and to attain salvation.

Much could be written about why this simple solution is too simple by half.  Trading Biblical fundamentalism (the Bible as the infallible word of God) for Church fundamentalism (what my Church says about the Bible is the infallible word of God) might be a positive step in the direction of not following one's own whims.  But then again, bowing to antiquity and clerical authority isn't quite the same thing as having arrived at the abode of Truth, as human interpretation is still involved.

The fact that the Church is older than all the other Christian sects is one thing, but a thing that has nothing whatever to do with whether it's true that Jesus rose from the dead, Protestant scholar N.T. Wright notwithstanding.  To put it more plainly and precisely, there is no proof -- no Truth-- to any Catholic claim in the resurrection or any other alleged miracle.  Claims of such events are always based on faith, not on solid evidence. And actually, it's not really just bowing, but unquestioned allegiance to every jot and tittle of the vast sea of Catholic Church teachings is what's being sold here.  One thing never heard on this or any similar Catholic evangelization media is someone expressing doubt or disbelief in even the tiniest fragment of the Catholic catechism.  For these people (many of them professional Catholics on the extreme fringe of orthodoxy who say they believe the account of Adam and Eve is actual history and that taking a yoga class is dabbling in Satanism), it's all or nothing, full belief in everything the Church teaches, or willful heresy.

The producers of this video did their darnedest to suggest otherwise, which is why I give the video just one star.  If someone was an atheist but later found strong appeal in the concept of God, that's fine.  But it doesn't mean that their conviction is based on anything but faith.  It doesn't prove that the RCC is ""Truth"" in all ways, while all other religions and points of view are objectively False.

So I didn't feel the video was quite honest in its presentation.  Rather, I felt it was a one sided and therefore somewhat deceptive effort to showcase the testimonies of certain Catholics in order to win converts.

The grande finale in this effort comes near the end of the video, where one convert tells a story about how in 1987 his and a friend's prayers for the intercession of Mary resulted in a miraculous cure of an 18 month old baby from extensive 3rd degree burns.  It's quite a compelling and heartfelt story and I have little doubt that the testimony is sincere.

However, as it's presented on the video, I see some problems with this miraculous story.

I did a google search to find 3rd party corroboration and more info on this miraculous healing, but all I could find was an article by the author in the National Catholic Register that told a different account of the event.  For one thing, he and his friend Sherry weren't the only people praying for the baby (as his testimony on the video seems to indicate), but he tells us that hundreds of people were praying.

But much more striking to me than that omission was that the video account strongly implies that the instant he and his friend say their prayer for the baby results in the baby's miraculous healing, a healing that confounded all medical knowledge and physician opinion and brought from the brink of death or at least certain disfigurement to robust health -- overnight!

The NCR account tells a much different story:  there, he says a full two weeks pass before he hears the news that the baby is healed.

As there's a break in the filming of the account, it appears that the producers of the video choose to edit this person's testimony so that it appeared to the viewers that a simple prayer to Mary had resulted in a miraculous overnight healing.  Or perhaps, the person telling the story changed his account?  We don't know,  but whoever is responsible for editing the story likelhy saw that collapsing the number of people praying from 100 to 2 and the time involved for the healing from 2 weeks (or longer?) to overnight made for a much more powerful testimony on an apparent miracle.

One would  think that after all the recent bad press about deceptive editing from Catholic activists, more care would be taken to avoid even the appearance of embroidering someone's testimony.  But for whatever reason, someone felt that there was little reason to let facts get in the way of telling a better tale.  This shows a lack of respect to the video's viewers.

There are other problems with the story about the miracle baby.  As far as I could discover from searching the net, there seems to be no 3rd party corroboration of the alleged miraculous event.  We're told the baby's name is ""Sarah""....Sarah who? We're not told.  Searching for this Sarah on the net produced no results.  Likewise, we're not told the name of the nurse involved in the story, and we're not told the name of any the doctors involved.  Are miraculous events so commonplace at this hospital that they go without even the barest mention by the medical staff?  There are likewise no results from Harbor View Medical Center or any medical authority regarding a miraculous or unusual 'spontaneous"" cure of an 18 month old baby from 90% 3rd degree burns in 1987.  I can't even find mention from any of the 100 Christians who were praying for ""Sarah's"" recovery.  This story about the baby apparently has no 3rd party references whatsoever (if they do exist, someone please post where we can find them).

So what's presented to the viewer is a story (with dramatic music in the background, and tears from the teller), clearly meant to be a reliable account of a genuine miracle resulting from prayers to Mary, is actually a story that has been significantly changed from a year ago, with key elements edited to make the story more dramatic, but upon examination, no corroboration from medical professionals can be found to verify any part of the story.

The story of the miracle baby ends with a question:  ""what do you say about something like that""?  I'd say this is a deceptive account of an alleged miracle, and would caution anyone to be convinced the story is true.",1452384000,2,7149,4.7382875605815835

I was never a full blown atheist but from section three on, it was like I was speaking through other people. I'm not sure if this would make any headway with a Protestant who is squarely set against the Catholic Church (as I once was), but for a new convert like myself, I can't say enough good things about it.

The only negatives had to do with a few audio issues. In one scene a cell phone goes off and in another the wind interferes with the microphone. Those should have probably been reshot instead of leaving them in, but overall it didn't take away from the message at all.
