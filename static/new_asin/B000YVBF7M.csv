8306541,5,B000YVBF7M,This was a fun step aerobics workout. It's not too long clocking in at a little under 40 minutes. Jules has great energy and teaches the combos well. I get a great workout with this in a short time.,1234137600,,198,4.102564102564102
8306542,1,B000YVBF7M,"Either I didn't see it, or there wasn't enough information regarding the level of the coriography of the step routine.  I've been doing step aerobics for years now, but this video was WAY too difficult.  The routines were just way too complicated to get just by doing it along with her.  It would have been nice to have a part at the beginning that taught the steps before she launched into this most difficult routine.  The pilates part was good, though.",1216512000,6,455,4.580246913580247
