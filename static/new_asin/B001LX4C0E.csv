3691642,5,B001LX4C0E,"This was the first Bible story I bought from the series. My children (8,6, and 3) loved it. they watched it so much they could even recite every word said. It has helped me teach the children about out faith in a way that i could never have done myself. I even watch it sometimes and it helps me with the specifics of names and places and times in the Bible. its a must have for very home. We all love this DVD and I have currently placed an order for 5more.",1387411200,4,458,3.989130434782609
3691643,5,B001LX4C0E,I loved this cartoon especially watching it as an adult. I like the fact that even a child can understand the meaning. The concept is simple but entertaining!,1384992000,,158,4.678571428571429
3691644,5,B001LX4C0E,It was Biblically based and the kids and I all found it interesting.  It was long enough to get some meat out of it.,1382745600,,116,3.8333333333333335

3691646,4,B001LX4C0E,The DVD arrived ontime. The picture quality is good and the entire family enjoyed watching. My 11yo found it easy to follow & link to the actual bible story.,1373155200,,157,4.448275862068965
3691647,5,B001LX4C0E,I was looking for DVD's about the Bible and was glad to find this one.  I can use it with the children ministry at church.,1369699200,3,122,3.88
3691648,3,B001LX4C0E,"I showed portions of this to my Sunday school class.  It is mostly Biblical, so I actually would read through the Bible, then show a portion and ask them to raise their hands if they noticed items that weren't in the Bible or weren't correct.  It does take a fair bit of artistic license and was alarmed they used the words ""Damn brother"" in one of the sections--I fast forwarded that portion.  All that being said, I am glad I purchased it and if properly reviewed and used, can be an additional part of your lesson.",1369526400,6,517,4.364583333333333
3691649,4,B001LX4C0E,"I love this product nicely presented for kids. My kids and I enjoy watching it, over and over this a great satisfaction for the mind",1367452800,6,132,4.32
3691650,4,B001LX4C0E,"This is a great video for kids when you're trying to explain Bible stories that may be too complex for young minds.  This is especially true of the books of the prophets, which are hard for even some adults to understand.",1343520000,9,221,4.390243902439025
3691651,4,B001LX4C0E,Great video for helping children to understand some of the stories adults take for granted because they can read them in the Bible for themselves.  These videos present a view that today's children can understand because they live in a world where information is more often being presented elecronically.,1317513600,3,304,5.204081632653061

3691653,5,B001LX4C0E,"I bought the entire collection of both the Old Testament Bible Stories for Children, and the New Testament series as well. Although the Japanese-based animation is the same in both series, the flow of the storytelling and the music soundtrack is much better in the Old Testament series (although I must admit that on some of the DVDs, the story could have been shortened by 5 minutes or so). Both series are geared towards children, and it is the reason why the violence and attempted rape scenes were removed but still referred to, so that the view understands the context of the story. This is a great series for children to watch and learn about the Old Testament. It is a useful teaching tool for parents, especially if each DVD is purchased for $5 or less.",1437264000,,761,4.602941176470588

3691658,4,B001LX4C0E,"The section we showed was on Isaiah. It needed a bit more introduction than it had, especially for children . I showed it to adults who were not familiar with the old Testament, and included a bot more background. The adults  enjoyed it.",1418947200,,237,4.511627906976744
3691659,5,B001LX4C0E,I really enjoyed this Bible story DVD. I  think this version is better than the Bible story DVD's that have an introduction by Charleton Heston. In those DVD's he just talks on and on and I think kids would loose interest before they get to the story. This DVD goes right into the story and I think would hold childrens attention.,1393200000,3,330,4.409836065573771

3691661,5,B001LX4C0E,"The first story i bought from the ""Under Gods Rainbow series was THE PROPHETS.

8319968,5,B001LX4C0E,Good Stories for teaching kids. My kids love these movies and they learn from the stories. Helps them to visualize the Bible. I highly recommend this series is the most accurate I have found and is neutral on Christian religions.,1483747200,,229,4.75

8319973,3,B001LX4C0E,It's not well done. There are lots of inaccuracies and the odd anti-Judeo-Christian jab thrown in and then. The only reason I rate it so high is that 1. It's usable and 2. It is the ONLY movie out there that covers the subject matter. At All. Why is that? Why can't there be a DECENT animation out there about Isaiah and other Bible prophets? I really should only rate one star if not for those factors. I nearly threw it away.,1456531200,,427,4.219512195121951
