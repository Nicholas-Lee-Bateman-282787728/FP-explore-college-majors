8168838,3,B000MGBSN0,"Beware!  My version was in Italian only.  No English soundtrack option.  English subtitles only.

Only one other reviewer mentions this.  It is NOT part of the product description.  This should really have been more explicit.

I really liked the film, as a Gialo fan, and particularly wished to hear the great Michael Rennie in his original voice.  Alas, I didn't even get to hear him in English.

Still rates a THREE on the strength of the film.",1495756800,2,446,4.688311688311688
8168839,4,B000MGBSN0,A fantastic example of the Giallo.,1469836800,,34,4.833333333333333
8168840,4,B000MGBSN0,"Prolific yeoman Italian director,  Antonio Margheriti (Anthony Dawson in American versions), perfectly channels Mario Bava in this 1968 giallo with. cinematography taking center stage. Reminds me most of The Girl Who Know Too Much in its breezy style. Fine performances overall and a surprise appearance by Michael Rennie who played Klaatu in The Day the Earth Stood Still. Despite the tawdry title and cliched ""teen girl boarding school"" setting, the film manages to stay well above grindhouse fare. Good production values, fine direction, well-acted, and a tight script.  This one's an overlooked sleeper from this era.",1469404800,,621,5.458333333333333

8168844,1,B000MGBSN0,"I usually love my 1960's movies. Not this one. it is Italian with English Sub-titles which I'm usually ok with but these flew by fast and there was no choice of set-up for English. Again Fine. Story bad, acting worse, characterization typical overall insipidly dull and boring. Some of the girls were getting killed at a school for girls....I didn't care, not a sympathetic character in the bunch. You have been warned.",1414800000,2,419,4.833333333333333
8168845,4,B000MGBSN0,More fun than scary. High quality production late 60s crime giallo. Although the kill scenes aren't that great the plot is kind of fun.,1370736000,,135,4.666666666666667
8168846,3,B000MGBSN0,"This flick from 1968 is a decent giallo thriller.  In which a black gloved killer is on the loose at a girlschool.  The violence in this  would be comparable to any movie that came before. Although there is nudity, which a American movie would have never allowed, and of course Mario bava helped write the story.  But his movies were even  a few years earlier just  a little more explicit in their violence.  The story is a decent
giallo story that takes place in a girlsschool.  If you like murder mysteries from europe and giallo thrillers and don't the  expect wild frenzied
action and sleazier nudity of giallos from 1970 onward,  then you will like this flick. . This movie reminded me a good mystery flick from Alfred Hitchcock. And it has the excellent Michael Rennie as the lead dectective.  And the flick even has a cool 1960's rock song theme.  This is just a fun flick and it reminded me of how much I loved those british
mysteries like miss marple etc because they tell a good story, and have good acting in them as well.",1228694400,11,1033,4.46524064171123
8168847,4,B000MGBSN0,"In the DVD's delightfully lurid cover art, a shadowy killer strangles a young blonde whose aroused breasts poke through her underwear. An ancient city burns red in the distance. The text promises ""a macabre tale of murder at an all-girls school."" In fact, it's fun tale of murder at an all-girls school. This Italian whodunnit from 1968 is more Agatha Christy than Mario Bava (who wrote some of the story). Charming performances from the young cast, especially the British actress Sally Smith as a Nancy Drew wannabe. Michael Rennie wanders through as an inspector. In Italian, first time in the States in an uncut version. ""Naked You Die"" is the translation of the Italian title. In the States, AIP hacked 15 minutes out of the film and dubbed it ""The Young, the Evil and the Savage,"" which pretty much sums up nothing. Worth seeing for the opening nude bathtube slaying alone.",1176076800,33,878,4.821192052980132
