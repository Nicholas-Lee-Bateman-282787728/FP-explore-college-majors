8666261,4,B00LJYKXNA,"Oh Mal-soon is a grumpy Korean grandma of 70+, living with her son and his family, who's come to feel she is little more than a burden to them.  One night, at a bus stop, she spies a small photo studio across the street and decides to get her portrait taken, the photographer promising to make her look ""fifty years younger.""  Assuming he's just flirting, Oh Mal gets her photo done and leaves the studio - not realizing, until she's on a bus and openly hit on by some young guys, that somehow she's reverted back to the age of 20!  She rushes back to the studio in a panic, but it's no longer there ... so with no other choice, Oh Mal not only finds herself embracing the idea of being young again (no aches and pains!  no false teeth!), fate also sends her on the path of a long-ago dream she'd never fulfilled in her youth.  The film is funny, sweet, and quite touching, as granny gets a second chance to both learn and teach how to embrace life while you have it.  A wonderful, uplifting film.

I am hoping they bring this movie to the US.  I would go to the theater to see it and would certainly purchase the Blue Ray if it becomes available.",1416873600,2,306,4.206896551724138
