8390103,3,B0036MF464,If you are interested in Swedish culture this film is for you.  A bit obscure and I admit it took me two viewings topick up on what was going on.  Alex Skarsgard fans (me) love it,1416355200,,179,3.9444444444444446
8390104,5,B0036MF464,"If you are a true Alexander Skarsgard fan, and have purchased a region 2 DVD player, as I have, you will enjoy this video immensely. It shows a younger Alex in a role much different from his more serious endeavors that have been released in the U.S. It is very entertaining and once again showcases the talent of this versatile actor. I laughed my ass off at certain scenes.",1338249600,3,374,4.434782608695652
