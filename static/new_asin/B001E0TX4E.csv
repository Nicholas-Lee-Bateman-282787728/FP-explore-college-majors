8330343,3,B001E0TX4E,"If you are thinking this video is about HOW to play video games, you would be wrong.  Yes, it's very interesting, with lots of good information, but it does not explain the actual hands-on play.  It seems to be short clips strung together, from videojug's website. Part of it explains what the different consoles are and how to hook them up. The other part is a talking head (though interesting) explaining the difference in game styles; first person shooter, RPG, etc.  All very interesting.
I thought from the title, it would show a beginner in-game footage and explain how games basically work, how you move from place to place, the controls, etc. I realize each game and console is different, but there could have still been a general tutorial on how a ""usual"" game is played, switching weapons mechanics, moving through the levels, what to look for and how to keep on track, etc.

Also, during some parts of the video, there are long gaps between the segments.  I thought the video was over after waiting about two minutes on a black screen.  I was just about to turn it off, thinking it was done, when another segment started.

I found the general information about games interesting but would not recommend this video at $19.99 if you are looking for actual gaming help.",1225411200,2,1277,4.699551569506727
