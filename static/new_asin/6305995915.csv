7899026,5,6305995915,"Denise Austin - Hit the Spot: Easy Toning is forty-nine minutes long and was released in 1996. The video is broken down into four different segments and beginners will have no problem with this video. The may have a little trouble with the first segment, but after a few times they should catch right on. People who are intermediate and up may want something more challenging. Unlike my other review on Denise's videos, I can't say she does ten push-up and then fifteen sit-ups. This is all stretching and makes it somewhat harder to comment on, but here's goes nothing.

A.M. Rev-Up 9 minutes

All the stretching is done standing up and Denise recommends this be done in the morning. Denise begins this stretch with arms flowing side to in a fluid motion. During the arm flowing stretch, done at different times, Denise goes into an isometric stretch. Next are four sun salutations; two slow and two fast. She does some other movements as well but I have a hard time describing then.

P.M. Stretch-10 minutes

These stretches are all done on the floor. Denise starts off with a few deep breathes then does some neck stretches. Half spinal twists and a series of leg, back, and arm stretches are done.

Sports Stretch- 11 minutes

A towel is needed for the Sports Stretch segment. Denise, along with two assistants, starts the Sports Stretch holding the towel at both ends and with her arm straight up starts stretching to the right, the to the back to the left, and finally to the front. Now with the towel and arms straight out in front of her, she twists side to side. Then Denise stretches the quadriceps by standing on her right leg and holding her left foot up; then the she switches legs. After doing a series of arm stretches she comes to the floor for Runner's Lunge, Cat & Camel, and Downward Dog. Back in a standing position, Denise finishes the Sports Stretch with loosing up the toes, a backward and forward swim with the arms, and a couple of deep breaths.

Mind Body Relaxer-10 minutes

Denise starts the Mind Body Relaxer standing up and starts with a neck relaxation stretch and arm stretches. After that she starts on a series of leg balancing stances. She then goes into a tai chi stretch. After that then it is on to the floor and lying on your back, begins a series of breathing movements.

There were some moves that I left out in some of the segments because she did not name them and I did not want to go into a lot of detail on how to do it. Denise Austin - Hit the Spot: Easy Toning gets an AAAAA+++++.",1256083200,,2528,4.490196078431373
