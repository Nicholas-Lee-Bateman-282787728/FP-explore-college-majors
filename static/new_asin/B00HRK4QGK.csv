But now there have been a series of 4 of these 2 disc sets released on ""Edition Filmmuseum"".  You can order them directly from their website, if you can't find a reasonable price elsewhere.

As for these two films, my thoughts from my film journal...

American Dreams: Lost and Found.  Powerful experimental 50 minute film that seems like it would be more at home on a museum wall than anywhere else.  There are three elements to the film.  A series of images of Hank Aaron baseball cards (and some other Hank Aaron memorabilia), intercut occasionally with a number.  We quickly come to realize that the cards are from each year in Aarons career, and the growing number the total home runs he had accumulated that year.  Over that are played important sound bites from that particular year that defined and crystallized that moment in America.  A song, and a speaker.  The speakers range from Joseph McCarthy to Martin Luther King to Patty Hurst, but each brings a shudder of recognition and pull you back to a moment, if you are old enough to have been alive when the words were spoken.  The third element, running along the bottom of the screen, not unlike the CNN news ticker, but in handwritten script, are diary entries.  We start the film not knowing who they are by or what their significance is, but it quickly becomes clear that they are disturbing and the product of a person unhinged.  Ultimately it all comes clear and by the end the film is a powerful and sad look at America in during the years of Aarons career which spanned the late 50s to the early 70s.  This is one experimental film that works on both an intellectual and a visceral level.  The viewer is placed in the fascinating, if frustrating position of having to choose which element to pay attention to at any given moment.  Theres simply too much going on to fully take it all in.  In that sense, everyone is likely to have a very different experience of the film. (Along with the almost uncontrollable urge to use the remote control to freeze or go back, which would sort of undermine Bennings whole construct, but could be argued to create a new one with value of its own -- that said, I resisted the temptation, deciding that I would get more from the film by experiencing it as Benning intended, and then re-watching it at a later date to see where my focus took me this time.)

Landscape Suicide (1987) - Occasionally haunting, but often frustrating examination of murder. Benning takes two very different murder cases  a teen girl who kills another in upper-class suburban California, and a middle aged man in frosty, working class Texas who has shot a woman in a store where he is buying a gun  perhaps by accident  although his past conceals worse crimes.  The film is split into two halves, one for each killing.  Were driven around the respective towns, shown the key sites in the crimes, and then have actors re-enact.  In the case of Bernadette Protti what we see is her interrogation by the police.  In the case of Ed Gein his testimony on the witness stand.  In neither case is there an attempt at realism.  The only person seen is the one portraying the killer, and the set is basically a neutral space.  The interrogators are never seen, and are all played by the same off camera voice.  And both actors give very low key, not very lifelike performances.  They feel intentionally amateurish, as if the film is making a point that we are not seeing reality, only a report of what was said.  In the end, while I appreciated how Benning avoided the clichd traps of typical documentaries examining a crime, and takes pains to make it clear he is less interested in the guilt of these people than in how their environment formed them, Im not sure this approach ultimately informs us all that well, either emotionally or intellectually.  I would see it again, though",1398211200,,3999,4.618980169971671
