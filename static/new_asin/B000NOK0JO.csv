2776196,1,B000NOK0JO,"Like one of the previous reviewers stated, this looks like a good buy from the outside due to the really nice packaging and the very good movie selection.  My wife and I were really looking forward to some of the movies featured on this set, especially ""Life With Father"".  Oh what a terrible disappointment it was to see such TERRIBLE quality audio and video.  We only made it through half the movie because it was so disheartening.  The audio is horrible.  Many of the lines spoken are unintelligible.  The video quality was so bad it was not watchable.  We took it back and left it at the store we bought it from because of the 'copyright laws that prohibit DVDs that are opened from being returned'.  It was HORRIBLE!  Avoid this DVD.  Purchase the movies individually if you can find them.",1221782400,60,794,4.567375886524823
2776197,1,B000NOK0JO,"The quality is about what you would expect of someone video taping old movies  with a video camera on a tripod from a TV screen. The sound is out of sync, making the movies very nearly unwatchable. Most of the real gems here can be bought on Amazon seperately used for $5 or so. Don't waste a PENNY on this, it's not the SERENADE you think!",1215475200,33,340,4.151515151515151
2776198,1,B000NOK0JO,Bought this set for my mom for Christmas.  The quality is atrocious -- both sound and picture quality.  Do not waste your money.  I'm seriously thinking of returning and getting my mom something else.  I can't believe people can live with themselves putting crap like this in a box and selling to unsuspecting victims.,1198540800,21,318,4.833333333333333
2776199,1,B000NOK0JO,"I am a classic movie fan and saw this collection as a way to get several very good movies for my library.  It was on sale at Sam's for about 15 bucks, so I thought,""5 dvds with 10 full-length films-GREAT!""  I found out that it was not what I hoped at all. While it does include some good classic titles like ""Life with Father"", ""Meet John Doe"", and ""The Little Princess"", it is ruined by the fact that the sound quality is VERY POOR!  and since it does not have an option of subtitles, it is very difficult to even understand what is happening.  The sound also goes loud and soft a lot.  The picture quality is not great.  I realize that these old movies, especially black and whites are kinda dark anyway, but this was exceptionally poor quality. There are no special features on any of the discs either.  The shiny metal tin to hold the collection in is a nice touch, but it seems to be falsely giving the idea that there is a real ""treasure"" inside.  This collection is NO TREASURE!",1193961600,46,985,4.315217391304348

8180214,4,B000NOK0JO,"These movies are all great. Each one stars at least one amazing actor from the Golden Age of Hollywood. Two of the scripts were Ernest Hemingway novels. It only misses getting a fifth star because some of the prints have not been well-cleaned up. ""Snows of Kilimanjaro"" is a dark print and has rough sound quality. ""The Little Princess"" is also a dark print. It's hard to understand parts of ""Father's Little Dividend"" and ""Life With Father."" Still, the movies are wonderful and this set is a good sampler. The set makes a nice introduction to screenwriters, directors and actors of the mid-20th century.",1420588800,,604,4.8173076923076925
8180215,1,B000NOK0JO,Unwatchable due to the sound quality. Could not hear the dialogue on the disks. Visual was poor but better than the sound.,1386720000,,122,4.590909090909091
8180216,1,B000NOK0JO,"I agree with all the other reviews. I also received this as a gift. What a joke! I've seen home movies
that had better quality than this! Amazon should take this item off their site. Don't buy!",1381622400,,193,4.243243243243243
8180217,1,B000NOK0JO,"Fortunately I only picked up this box of DVDs at the library, so I didn't have to waste my money.  I was excited to see such a great looking collection, but what a disappointment. I actually trudged through most of the movies, since I love the stories, but it was painful.  At first I thought I had just forgotten how bad other prints of the movies looked, but after a while it was clear that they couldn't have been that bad. ""Farewell to Arms"" was just about unwatchable, and ""The Little Princess"" wasn't much better, and so on for the others.  What a pity.",1350345600,2,559,4.355769230769231
8180218,1,B000NOK0JO,I bought this movie from Target and I wish I had checked the reviews on Amazon before I purchased it. I am so unhappy. I saw part of Life with Father on Turner Classic Movies and the sound a picture quality were sooooo much better. Avoid buying this movie ANYWHERE!,1320451200,5,265,4.32
8180219,1,B000NOK0JO,A family member bought this collection for me as a gift.  What a waste of her hard-earned money!  These DVDs are atrocious copies--terrible audio and video quality.  Who allows this kind of crap to be sold to unsuspecting customers?,1281139200,19,232,4.897435897435898
