7832184,4,6302806232,"Dr. Derrick Ruseel is the sleazy director at a local mental institution. He regularly lusts after his most beautiful female patients but one day his lust for one female patient goes too far. One night he kidnaps a patient from her room and straps her to a bed in the examination room where he proceeds to rape her while she helplessly screams for rescue.

The next morning, she commits suicide by jumping from the roof of the sanitarium, too emotionally wrecked from her traumatizing experience to go on. Dr. Russel writes off her suicide as a result of her depression she was battling. 10 years go by until a female patient by the name of Sandy Ramirez, checks herself in to the sanitarium, causing Dr. Russel's lustful ways to make a return.

Dr. Russel abducts Sandy from her room and rapes her the same way he raped his other female patient, 10 years before. The sex-crazed doctor intends to kill Sandy, making it look like a suicide by giving her a lethal overdose injection of some sort. Sandy is injected and dies--or at least so Dr. Russel thinks. With the assistance of one his equally sadistic aids, Dr. Russel has him dispose of Sandy's body by burying it somewhere in the field of sanitarium.

The only problem is, the body mysteriously vanishes the next day without a trace. When the doctor begins seeing visions and illusions of Sandy around the grounds, he begins to question his own sanity and wonders if the young woman is even really dead.

Overall: Recently got to catch this on television and it wasn't bad. It's low budget so don't expect any fancy camera quality. The movie constantly switches between fast-paced and slow-paced action but it still manages to come off across as somewhat enjoyable and keeps you watching until the end. It's not a complete thriller either, meaning that that it's not all thrills. That are some comical moments here and there that might make you laugh if you have a sense of humor. Most of the acting tends to ride the fine line between average and below average, depending on who the character is. Overall, I'd recommend giving this a watch...only if you have nothing else to do. Since it supposedly is nowhere on DVD or VHS in the US, you can probably find it on Youtube or perhaps TV if you search hard enough",1425686400,,2265,4.626865671641791

Directed by Charles Winkler bring a Clever, Something Dumb, Entertaining Comic Thriller works thanks to the Fun Performance by McDowell. Written by Emerson Bixby and the Director from a Story by Bixby brings some memorable moments in this Movie, which is Strangely Funny. Although, the Story doesn`t Quite Work at times and the Camera Angels are at times-Unnecessary for this to Work, But the Acting is quite Good. Priscilla Pointer and Irwin Keyes are in Good Supporting Roles. Disturbed isn`t the Greatest Black Comedy Ever Told but It`s Quite Different, when the Movie wants to. Clint Howard and Filmmaker-Adam Rifkin are in Small Roles as the Mental Patients. Grade:B+.",1020211200,3,1344,5.058558558558558

Unsophisticates may have been puzzled by the subtle sociological gradience masked by the director's latent  subtrefuge of exploitative cinema. However, thoughful observers must  ratiocinate that this is in fact, if not in deed, the pentultimate work of  an auture at the height of his powers. The incalcuable sentience and  sensitivity required to cobble such bifurcated meaning in mere celluloid is  awesome on the scale of apotheosis. ""Disturbed"" is unquestionably  the greatest film since ""Madmen Of Manduras"".",952560000,3,618,5.591397849462366
7832187,1,6302806232,"The director got himself one of those two-for-one labotomies at K-Mart, he rewrote the script, and turned this film into a comedy that wasn't funny and a thriller that wasn't scary. McDowell tried, but then so did the  navigator on the Titanic. Thumbs down...",931564800,3,259,4.886363636363637
