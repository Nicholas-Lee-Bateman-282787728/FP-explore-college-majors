7359896,5,B0130MKDRO,A beautifully rendered look at the Perma-Culture movement that is one of the great eco-causes of the 21st century.  I loved it. No lectures or finger wagging....and damn fine film-making.  Every student of the Environment should see it.,1439251200,7,236,5.184210526315789
7359897,5,B0130MKDRO,"There's a quote I love by Bill Mollison, the Co-Founder of Permaculture ""The greatest change we need to make is from consumption to production, even if on a small scale, in our own gardens. If only 10% of us do this, there is enough for everyone.

Permaculture, which comes from Permanent Agriculture is a wonderful system of feeding ourselves and others. Industrial Agriculture has hurt our soil via erosion, our health via process foods, and our society via overuse of oil, water etc.  Permaculture is way of sustainably growing food that can feed the world.

This movie is excellent and has a number of interview with farmers and teachers from all over the United States. There are large farms like Mark Shepard's New Forest Farm and smaller community farms some even in the cities. Permaculture will work anywhere from the suburbs to the city to the forest.

I've been using Permaculture techniques in my home garden and orchard for a number of years now and they are wonderful. I live in the West and we are having a drought but using these techniques has let me grow more with less water. It's an organic method as well. It's a system of producing food that's better for us, plants, animals and the environment.  This is a GREAT movie and highly recommended.",1438905600,10,1264,4.7272727272727275

7359899,5,B0130MKDRO,I love documentaries and permaculture. This is my new favorite movie. I've already watched it a few times. We are buying nine acres and I can't wait to see it transform into a permaculture farm.,1452038400,3,194,4.571428571428571

I've shared this video with several friends and they are always very happy to hear this message of hope and regeneration, using concepts we can all begin to incorporate into our daily life!  This has made an excellent gift!",1449014400,,271,5.136363636363637

7359904,5,B0130MKDRO,"The DVD proved to be very interesting,especially to my husband, according to him, it shows that an increasing number of people are becoming aware that Agri-business is depleting the soil resources of the earth and are beginning to take action to prevent this from happening. A great DVD, the best he's seen on this subject.",1444348800,3,323,4.890909090909091

7359907,5,B0130MKDRO,"I am so grateful that someone with rich cinematic vision and artful taste like Costa Boutsikaris has honored the field of permaculture design by creating this beautiful documentary. Film is a unique medium in its ability to convey (through dialogue, visual cues, and a unique soundtrack) a solid and representative glimpse into otherwise complex subjects and issues. Permaculture design is like that, in that it can be difficult to summarize the far-reaching implications of its design framework into not just agricultural systems but in all sectors of life. In addition to the explanations that I offer up in conversation and writing, I am overjoyed to have this film to share with others. Thank you so much to everyone who contributed to making this fantastic film!",1441497600,5,767,5.144
7359908,5,B0130MKDRO,"Amazing movie!!  It's got several different interviews with people in different ""habitats"": Suburbs, rural, cities, etc. and it show's what is not only possible but amazingly fruitful and so pretty!!
I loved the children playing in some of the gardens-it's SO important for children to have connection to their food and land, but I think my favorite part was Mark Shepard's large scale place. It really is inspiring and gives hope that over worked corn fields, or any land, can become beautiful and hugely productive...
I really am truly blown away by how clear and well done this movie is!!
Definitely recommend it for anyone from suburban and city dwellers to permaculture students and teachers!!",1441065600,3,698,5.069565217391304
