8165344,5,B000LXGXZ2,"Another reviewer states that both of these films are fully restored and re-mastered. They are not. Fortunately, Alpha came up with some pretty good prints this time around, though perfectionists may still complain about a few scratches, splices and less than pristine quality. I'm very pleased with how good these movies look.

KID COURAGEOUS (1935) has Steele, an all-round athletic college type being thrown onto a boxcar heading west by his all-business father (Lafe McKee). Steele's hog-tied and is set free by fellow boxcar stowaway Kit Gard who befriends Bob in his quest to find his father's missing mine engineer. This makes no sense since Bob earlier pleaded with dad Lafe to let him go west to investigate the disappearance instead of sitting around the office all day conducting business.
Anyway, Bob and Kit get to the bottom of things after the usual mistaken identity stuff and several very good Steele scenes involving an excellent brawl in which runty Bob hurls his opponent around with apparent ease and a swordfight duel in which Bob once again proves his mettle and athletic skill.
This is quite an enjoyable B-Western, easy going and lots of fun with Bob Steele at the peak of his cowboy stardom, the charming smile and twinkle in his eye honed to perfection.
And Bob's real life father, Robert North Bradbury directed this gem.

The second here, NEAR THE RAINBOW'S END (1930) is the real treat of this double feature. It's Bob Steele's first talking picture and it's in really good shape. Once again Lafe McKee is Bob's father, so this can also be considered a father-son double bill!
This time it's the cattle vs sheep stuff with Al Ferguson turning in a really nasty performance as the low-down snake behind murdering Loise Lorraine's kindly father. This one is directed by prolific veteran J.P. McGowan and it moves right along for a very early outdoor sound feature.

So what we have here is a pretty good time on the Western frontier circa 1930s. Two excellent Bob Steele features, slam-bang action-packed! A very good example of this kind of stuff. And they are both in nice shape and very watchable.
It's coming across a real bargain like this that keeps me coming back to the ALPHA product, although sometimes their product leaves a lot to be desired. But, hey, they are the leading source for B-Western entertainment out there with the largest catalog to be offered...and they're CHEAP! So, yeah, you get what you pay for, but sometimes you come up with something really great.",1377302400,,2507,4.880281690140845
8165345,4,B000LXGXZ2,"Poverty Row Pictures presents ""KID COURAGEOUS/NEAR THE RAINBOW'S END"" (1930/1935) (109 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Bob Steele was an American actor --- He was born Robert Adrian Bradbury in 1907 in Portland, Oregon, into a vaudeville family --- Bob's career began to take off for good in 1927, when he was hired by production company Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) to star in a series of Westerns. Bob--who was rechristened Bob Steele at FBO--soon made a name for himself, and in the late 1920s, 1930s and 1940s starred in B-Westerns for almost every minor film studio, including Monogram, Supreme, Tiffany, Syndicate, Republic (including several films of the Three Mesquiteers series) and Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC) (including the initial films of their ""Billy the Kid"" series)

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, that ""new medium"" television had many hours to fill and few dollars to fill them --- They re-discovered the B-Western, still a popular mainstay of Saturday afternoon matinees and many cowboy stars thrilled a new audience --- Taking advantage of this rebirth in popularity, publishers brought to the marketplace comic books featuring these western heroes of ""Bob Steele"" Westerns --- These bimonthly issues were copyrighted in February and April of 1950 by Fawcet Publications --- His career which included nearly 200 feature films, serials and TV appearances --- Steele in his twilight years at the age 59 when he got the part of the cantankerous ""Trooper Duffy"", in the western comedy series ""F Troop"" (1965), who at the drop of a hat would give his rendition of fighting ""shoulder to shoulder with Davy Crockett at the Alamo"" --- Steele retired from the screen in 1973 --- Bob's long career, spanning more than 50 years came to an end in 1988 when he passed away.
