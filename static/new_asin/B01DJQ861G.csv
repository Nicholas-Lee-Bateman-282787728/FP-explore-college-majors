Anyway! Denny Miller is great and looks great. The worst thing, many scenes taken from ""King Solomon mines"", yes the one with Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr.",1471392000,,304,4.648148148148148

7713185,3,B01DJQ861G,"As a longtime fan of the Tarzan films, I was happy to learn that this rarely-seen MGM production from 1959 was getting a DVD release. The film itself was an attempt to reboot the character independent of the long-running film series that began with the Johnny Weismuller film of the same name in 1932. This film hit theaters the same year as Paramount's ""Tarzan's Greatest Adventure,"" starring Gordon Scott.

Tarzan the Ape Man is a game attempt at recapturing what made the earlier film, and the character, so popular. Although it's ultimately no more faithful to Edgar Rice Burroughs' original stories than most film versions, it does a largely-credible job of updating the story for the time. Color had only come to the official series a couple of years earlier, so seeing Tarzan's jungle exploits in vivid Technicolor definitely brought new life to the character. Unfortunately, MGM's budget (around $680,000 according to the IMDB) meant that a lot of corner were cut. The use of animal stock footage in a Tarzan picture had been around since the 1930's, but Tarzan the Ape Man takes things a step further by recycling recognizable footage from previous Tarzan films. The character's trademark yell is even dubbed from the Weismuller films. Even if you accept all those things, the use of BLACK AND WHITE footage from Tarzan the Ape Man (1932) and Tarzan and His Mate (1934), mixed in with the color footage of the new film, is really difficult to overlook.

As the new Tarzan, Denny Miller looks the part, but simply lacks the charisma or gravitas of other actors who've inhabited the role. Joann Barnes as Jane Parker comes off slightly better, but honestly, no one here really stands out. Director Joseph Newman tries to keep things moving; and taken purely as a b-budget adventure title, the film isn't that bad.

Warner does its typical serviceable no-frills job with the DVD. I did notice the colors shifting just a bit in a few scenes, but it was over very quickly. Considering this is a minor film that even many hardcore Tarzan fans don't really embrace, it seems unlikely we'll ever see any further restoration of the source material. A good clean print of the film's theatrical trailer is also included.

I'd recommend this one only for hardcore Tarzan fans who want to complete their collections. For the casual viewer, just stick with Weismuller.",1468454400,2,2363,4.885286783042394

7713187,2,B01DJQ861G,"Tarzan, the Ape Man from 1959 is really not good.  Runtime is 84 min.  Lot of footage is re-used from other Tarzan films.",1465171200,2,121,4.217391304347826
8756037,1,B01DJQ861G,"O, the importance of the comma. In this corner we have that all-time classic jungle adventure from 1932, TARZAN THE APE MAN, that starred Johnny Weissmuller and the delectable Maureen O'Sullivan. And over there stinking up the joint is the 1959 MGM cheapie TARZAN, THE APE MAN. Best not get the two confused.

One crap thing about these jungle-themed movies is that there are only so many diverse plots you can toss in. Greedy white hunter. Primitive tribesmen. Savage beasts. A search for lost treasures or lost cities. In this one, Jane Parker (Joanna Barnes), an English colonel's prim and proper daughter, travels to Africa to visit her father whom she hadn't seen in years. She's accompanied by a shady big bwana, Mr. Holt (Cesare Danova), mostly because the story requires a baddie, and he's it.

All three - plus some throwaway natives - embark on a grueling expedition for the fabled elephants' graveyard, visions of a vast field of ivory translating to fabulous wealth. When Jane is separated from the group, she runs into a wild ape-man.

I wouldn't be surprised if those goofballs from Mystery Science Theater 3000 had already gotten a hold of this skunk. The Tarzan film franchise is often a hit or miss. Very few are classics, and most of those are early Weismullers. Never has the comma been more ashamed to be associated with a movie title. TARZAN, THE APE MAN is the worst, and that's factoring in that rubbish 2003 television series and the 1981 p00fest with Bo Derek.

Given, the movie didn't get much in the way of budget. The production crew had no recourse but to lift footage from KING SOLOMON'S MINES (1950) and previous Tarzan movies, specifically, TARZAN THE APE MAN (1932) and TARZAN AND HIS MATE (1934). There's even one shot when you can clearly see it's Weissmuller battling a crocodile. It's crazy that they thought they could marry the old black and white Tarzan footage with their current Technicolor footage thru the magic of tinting.

MGM, what happened? You used to put out the best Tarzan movies. There's just a lot of ridiculous on the screen. Denny Miller, bless his soul, was a UCLA basketball player that had no business playing the lord of the jungle. He's freakin' blond, and a blond Tarzan is a fail. And Joanna Barnes is probably the least enticing, least beddable Jane ever put to the silver screen. It's like being with Mary Poppins if Mary Poppins had minimal sex appeal. And I'm sorry, but Jane's spontaneous decision to run off with Tarzan at the end of the movie instead of staying with Holt and becoming rich off ivory just isn't convincing. Speaking of Holt, what the hell happened? For most of the movie, he's portrayed as a heel, but then he becomes this stand-up guy? I don't buy it. Although, I guess he can afford to be the nice guy since he doesn't have to share the ivory with Jane.

On the positive, I liked the score a lot. But you have to admit Shorty Rogers's jazzy score sounds jarringly out of place.

What's more cringy? The laughable back-projection work in the underwater scene that was supposed to evoke the sensual underwater scene from TARZAN AND HIS MATE? Or Denny Miller tussling with a large stuffed animal? Much of the third act is shot so murkily, it's hard to make anything out, thus depriving us of things to make fun of.",1537574400,,3299,4.687392055267703
8756038,3,B01DJQ861G,"This film copied ideas that were in former Tarzan films. It even seemed to me that part of an elephant raid of a native village contained film from a prior black and white Tarzan film. There was nothing new in this 1959 film. It is about an English colonel who brings his daughter Jane into the jungle looking for the elephant burial ground so that he and his friend can sell the ivory and become rich. Tarzan saves Jane when she is attacked by an elephant and the two fall in love. The blacks in the film are portrayed as very simple folk, very child-like, not at all thoughtful. Tarzan in this film does not speak English. He utters the famed Tarzan cry frequently in this film, more than any other I've see, when he swings from tree to tree and when he calls animals to help him, which he does twice in this film. The acting in the film is not outstanding.",1521158400,,859,4.276073619631902

8756040,1,B01DJQ861G,"Might be the worst modern (post 1930) Tarzan movie ever made--and that's saying something.  Certainly qualifies ""worst"" since 1950, as it was made in '59, decades after Johnny Weissmuller hung up his loin-cloth, and after the first 3 of 6 much superior Gordon Scott Tarzan movies had already been made.  No excuse for this.  How cheap and sleazy?  Well, the used vintage black and white elephant stampede footage and tinted it (it was a night, see, and...aww, never mind.)
Even as a young teen in the movie theatre back then I was turned off.

I suppose he was okay but definitely my very biggest problem was Joanna Barnes as Jane....who thought that up? Horrifyingly bad. She just annoyed me and then we have Cesare Danova as her would be suitor and of course the greedy killer of the bunch was just...MEH? The story is the intrepid band head down river to look for the elephant's grave yard to steal the ivory from dead animals, Charming, as an animal lover I was offended but it is a movie. Very bad effects even for the time, stock animal footage which I guess needed for additional time.",1475712000,,782,4.326530612244898
