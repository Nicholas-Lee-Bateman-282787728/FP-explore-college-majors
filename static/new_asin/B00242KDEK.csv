Although this disc is widely distributed by large reputable company's, the quality looks like its been pirated. Enclosed are poor quality B&W's (for the most part), shaky video like it was filmed with a hand-held camcorder at a theater and very forgettable films or versions of them. What surprises me the most though is how reputable companies allowed this poor quality product to get into their distribution chain.

3843186,1,B00242KDEK,"Just because it has Elizabeth Taylor on the cover and lists a few great stars and all those great film titles...don't expect this compilation to be anything but misleading in its content. The word ""Classic"" is bandied about these days and applied to anything that is old.  Old does not mean Classic...not at all.  What makes these films classic are the stars who originated the roles...but you won't find many of those here.  Not one seller lists the stars along side the respective films they were in!  Why not? First and foremost is the company that manufactured this Hodge-podgy collection.  You can't find them listed anywhere online anywhere and they haven't given their sellers/merchandisers any of the pertinent info on this collection.  They don't want you to know before you purchase this set that The Call of The Wild doesn't have Clark Gable or Loretta Young in it, nor do they wish to draw attention to their version of Jane Eyre!  If you're looking for Orson Welles stop right where you are and look elsewhere.  The same too with several others.  They are TV playhouse productions or made for TV films and many have a shaky, grainy Kine-scope type quality about them. No...this is not a collection for the true Classic film lover. A manufacturer that would list them properly would be proud to do so if they truly were the real films of distinction...but they're not and no low price can make them that palatable that I would buy or be fooled by this merchandising mess.

3843188,2,B00242KDEK,"I was disappointed when I started watching this.  Yes, it has a couple of outstanding movies;  Snows of Kilimanjaro,l Jane Eyre, Jungle Book.  But when I saw the Titles A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court and A Tale of Two Cities, I was thinking Bing Crosby and Leslie Howard.  These were TV episodes, and were not well done.  And there are far more TV than movies.  The '50s era car commercials were fun though.",1375488000,6,420,4.533333333333333

3843191,5,B00242KDEK,"Bought this for Sean Connery starring in a very grainy Macbeth in his early years.

This flick alone is worth the price. The four discs are a treasure trove of great film making from yesteryear.

It is a bargain. Cyrano De Bergerac in there too with Ferrer, the best ever version.",1358899200,4,280,4.470588235294118
3843192,4,B00242KDEK,"A couple of the movies had some viewing problems due to age, however I still enjoyed these classics. Great price. Would reccomend.",1358380800,3,130,4.954545454545454
3843193,5,B00242KDEK,"I'll start by saying that ... if you don't have the eight films in this collection which are truly theatrical cinema releases, for the price being asked, this is a very good deal.  Seven of the presentations are, however, TV adaptations and a mixed bag.

Regarding the 'real' movies, 'Of Human Bondage' and 'Cyrano De Bergerac' are the outstanding entries and alone worth the price of the collection.  These films are all from an era of movie making that seems to have slipped away ... with none of the mechanical monsters and computer generated effects that pass for acting these days.  No, these are films produced to showcase human 'stars' in an age when just their appearance on the BIG screen could cause the audience to catch their breath.  The beautiful Elizabeth Taylor, Ava Gardner, Vivien Leigh and Susan Hayward are here but also some 'stars', once big (but not so generally familiar now) such as Kay Francis and Wendell Corey.

As to the TV adaptations, mainly black and white, kinescope copies they are also of some interest, if your expectations aren't too high.  They feature 'Hollywood' personalities venturing into the foreign territory of television and in roles they might not get to essay in 'real movies'. Chuck Connors trading in his six-guns for a trip off-shore in 'The Sea Wolf' and Sean Connery as 'Macbeth' (just one year before he forever became '007'), come to mind.  There are 'live' performances from the days of TV when broadcasting 'live' was a hectic affair, because of the logistics, with somewhat flimsy productions.  But there are 'stars' here too ... George Scott, Boris Karloff, etc.

Once again, the price of this collection makes it worth the investment and lots of fun to watch.  The quality of the prints vary but are mostly okay.",1353456000,16,1773,4.857142857142857
3843194,5,B00242KDEK,There are so many films and tv specials in this collection that I absolutely love and others I had no idea existed! But needless to say they all made for a wonderful viewing experience.  I love seeing book adaptations and this collection is full of them.  Can't beat this price either!,1335139200,2,285,4.568627450980392
3843195,5,B00242KDEK,"This is a marvelous collection of film and television that begs to be owned by any cinephile.  I find all of these works hold a strong position in film/television history.  All are well worth multiple viewings.  The Snows of Kilimanjaro was a highlight for me with absolute brilliant leads, Gregory Peck and Ana Gardner, in a film about one reflecting on life as death nears.  Then of course there is the much lighter Jungle Book, directed by Zoltan Korda, starring the absolutely fabulous Sabu.  It's an endearing film that, though light in tone, carries some real weight in it's subtext.  It's a great film for the family.  True cinephiles will undoubtedly appreciate Of Human Bondage, the tale of a sensitive and club-footed Philip Carey who enrolls in medical school and falls in love with illiterate waitress Mildred Rogers. She rejects him, runs off with a salesman and returns unmarried and pregnant. Philip gets her an apartment and they become engaged, but complications and dramatic action quickly follow in this unique drama/romance.  Elizabeth Taylor fans will delight in the film, The Last Time I Saw Paris, of which I believe to be one of her stand out roles.  There's something in this collection for everyone.",1335139200,7,1225,4.965686274509804
3843196,3,B00242KDEK,"This collection includes many movies available on budget sale DVDs, such as ""The Last Time I Saw Paris"", ""The Snows Of Kilamanjaro"", and ""The Jungle Book""; it also includes a few movies that are sold at more retail price, such as ""Anna Karenina"", ""Of Human Bondage"", and ""Little Men"".  The rest of the material are 1950s teleplays or made-for-TV versions of literary classics: ""Huck Finn"", ""A Connecticut Yankee"", ""Legend Of The Sea Wolf"", ""Call Of The Wild"", etc.  It's interesting to see some of the TV teleplays with their original commercials.

This collection is definitely worth the discount price for which it is sold; but be aware that in order to get so many of these literary classics on two discs the quality is compromised.  It is recommended for students of Western literature and of film/theatre, so that one can see how these great books were translated onto the big or small screen.",1313884800,9,898,4.849673202614379
3843197,5,B00242KDEK,"This is an inexpensive set of public domain movies and tv shows.  The movies are widely available in sets like this.  I haven't watched them all yet,but I have spot checked them; they all play, and  the ones I have watched feature decent prints considering they are in public domain.  It also has 3 very early tv series dramatizations, featuring Boris Karloff, John Carradine, Wendell Corey and Thomas Mitchell which are fun as well.  The reason I bought this  was a  version of Macbeth starring Sean Connery from the early 60's.  It appears to have been made for BBC,  probably shortly before James Bond came into his life and is certainly an abbreviated script.  The camera work is not good at all, odd framing to start with,  and a rather murky print as well, (it compares closely with kinescope from U. S. television), but it's fascinating to watch Connery tackle the role.  He is a young actor here and in his physical prime,  if not at the top of his range as an actor.  It would really have been interesting to see what he would have made of this role had he done the Polanski version 10 years later. All in all,  if you are not interested in the television productions, lower the rating to 4 stars for ok prints of some widely available,  but good movies. If you interested in something you may never find anywhere else, go for this.  It's well worth having in my opinion.",1309910400,27,1380,4.5
3843198,3,B00242KDEK,"First, the box image here is more accurate. This really should be called ""Great Literature Cinema"" since that's clearly its theme. But by the time I picked up a copy (same UPC), it was two double-sided discs instead of four, and it was Great Cinema.

It seems that TGG always feels free to mix classic TV episodes and TV movies in with their cinematic sets. Six of the fifteen shows here were strictly small-screen.

Then again, there really are some good movies in this bunch. Here's the list, along with their 1-10 ratings from the users of IMDB, an Amazon company:

The Snows of Kilimanjaro, 1952 (6.3)
Anna Karenina, 1948 (6.5)

3843199,3,B00242KDEK,"I bought 15 classics for $5. During Of Humnan Bondage, the dvd would ""freeze"" while the soundtrack played, then the film would run silently for a minute. Afterward the film coninued. This happened about every10 t0 15 minutes. Was it annoying? Of course. Did it ruin the film? Um. No. Did I mention I bought 15 classics for $5?",1290902400,13,326,4.5423728813559325

8350233,2,B00242KDEK,"Buying this compilation is like getting a huge portion of lousy food. The quality is horrendous. Looks like they were bootlegged from a television broadcast, in 4x3 format. Ive seen the Last Time I saw Paris on Turner Classic and it was a beautiful print. I bumped it from one star to 2 because you're getting 15 movies for about $.50 each. So if you don't care at all about quality and only care about the story than maybe its the right purchase for you. I should have taken a pass.",1524355200,3,483,4.318681318681318
8350234,3,B00242KDEK,"A so-so collection of classics that probably will be in the ""desperate to find something new to watch"" in my large film collection.",1516838400,2,131,4.739130434782608
8350235,3,B00242KDEK,"I have watched 1/3 of the titles. As others have mentioned, this is not a 15 movie collection. It is a collection of movies and TV shows typically adapting a literary classic. They use the term ""cinema"" to mean actors and actresses who have been in movies and not that every title is a movie.

Content: Of the five titles I have watched, I generally have enjoyed the stories. None of them so far have been really strong or memorable such that I would watch them again but they were enjoyable enough for a single viewing. Most of them would be a 6 or 7 out of 10.

Video: This is where the set is really weak. My stand alone DVD player hooked up to my TV won't play it. I tried it on my computer using VLC and found the video on both sides of Disc 1 is improperly formatted. The sides are scrunched in like it was formatted for use on a cell phone held vertically! I had to have VLC force it to 4:3 aspect ratio in order to view it properly. I have NEVER experienced this on a commercial DVD before. Beyond this technical problem, the title's video quality ranges from poor to average. All of these appear to be prints many generations old. Video can be fuzzy and during dark scenes it can be hard to tell what is going on. ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro,"" a color movie, is unappealing and the video problems contributed to me losing interest and not finishing the movie, something that is uncommon for me.

Audio: Since this set uses old prints, the audio can be fuzzy; however, I have always been able to tell what is being said.

Prior to starting this set I watched  ""Fabulous Forties - 50 Movie Pack"" (ASIN B0086IMNRQ) over a few year period and enjoyed it much more. I was technically able to watch the movies on my DVD player hooked up to my TV. All the titles were movies. The stories were generally a 6 or 7 with a few being a solid 8. A few movies were missing a good 20 minutes, such as Meet John Doe. The video quality was generally a step above this set. However, we never watched about 3-5 movies in that set due to the audio being so poor we couldn't understand what people were saying.

In short, if you're debating between an inexpensive collection of classic titles you'll have more enjoyment and value from ""Fabulous Forties - 50 Movie Pack"" than ""Great Cinema: 15 Classic Films.""",1512864000,,2294,4.323255813953488
