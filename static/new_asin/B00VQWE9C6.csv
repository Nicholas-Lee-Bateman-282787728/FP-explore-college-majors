8710993,1,B00VQWE9C6,"This is a terrible film, if you can even call it that. This is a poorly filmed video scrapbook of a family running a very poorly done home haunt. Do not waste your time or money renting this. This shouldn't even be allowed on Amazon.",1482537600,3,233,4.2
8710994,1,B00VQWE9C6,I do. I don't like the whole level of scariness. I do like how it is based on Halloween.,1478563200,,88,3.6842105263157894
8710995,1,B00VQWE9C6,"As soon as I saw a family photo slideshow on my screen and the bad 80's documentary music started .. I knew I had made a mistake.
This looks like it was made on an iPhone and that is being generous. I'm glad that they are doing something great for their neighborhood on Halloween but I could barely make out half of the very dark video footage and the interviews were a bit pointless.
 I am a big fan of Halloween and love a great yard haunt but this was poorly executed in every possible way.
This was only a $2 rental but if I had purchased this to own, I would be a very unhappy camper right now.
I could barely see this being an candidate as a free movie on Prime. How this made it on Amazon as a rental -baffling.
 I am a huge fan of all things Halloween and every year I have a pretty decent yard haunt.  Id love to find another documentary more along the lines of American Scream but no luck yet.",1464652800,2,903,4.033519553072626
