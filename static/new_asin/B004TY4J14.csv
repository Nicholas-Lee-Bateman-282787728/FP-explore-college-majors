8441100,5,B004TY4J14,"I grew up watching this show in Spanish and great news: All episodes contain both the original Spanish dub (Latino) and its original English. The episodes look gorgeous and restored, with much better picture quality than I remember on TV.

A DVD set that is almost perfect. A must-have for any fan of the series, fans of the great Don Adams, or anybody who wants to enjoy a good laugh.",1357603200,3,385,4.5
