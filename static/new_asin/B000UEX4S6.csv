8213104,5,B000UEX4S6,"Note: this version is region 2 only.  You will need a region free or region 2 (Europe) player.

Complex, very funny, sad, very French look at love and sexual dynamics, with terrific acting all around.

Gerard Depardieu plays a man who truly loves his wife, but can't understand her or her depression.
So he decides to get her a lover to cheer her up. But it doesn't work, and now two men are bewitched and
befuddled by the sad, repressed Solange.

Ultimately only a love affair with a 13 year old boy - who in many ways is the most mature character in
the film - gives her joy.

Transgressive, uncomfortable, surreal and tweaking both sides of the war of the sexes equally; men are fools
who can only look at women through a narrow prism, and women are complex and weird to the point of
absurdity, this is a film that makes me laugh and cringe (in a good way) in equal measure.",1457654400,,877,4.323170731707317
8213105,1,B000UEX4S6,"I purchased a copy of this DVD from an Amazon affiliated seller. It was in PAL format although the specs indicated
""All Regions"". It wouldn't play at all on my system. It only works in England. The other version with the blue cover is ""USA Region 1"" but it's G rated (?) and only in French. I can't understand why Amazon USA sells DVDs in both foreign and American formats. It's confusing and misleading.",1331424000,,404,4.472972972972973
