I still laught when I think of old boy who has to ride a bike to meet up with the rest of the gang.  Add to that that he can't see worth dang it.  It's hilarous.",1276819200,9,264,3.7454545454545456

2071895,4,B00029NLLY,"Willie Nelson to me makes a great western movie star for he has the deep

2071896,4,B00029NLLY,"I was the Location Manager for this movie which was filmed at Old Tucson Studios in Tucson, Arizona. It didn't win any awards but it was a fun movie with all the country western stars. We had mucho fun with Willie and all the rest. They were kidding and telling tale tales when off camera. Burt Kennedy has always been a favorite Director of mine and I enjoy working for him. You will have fun with this flick and I promise you will watch it over and over.

2071897,4,B00029NLLY,"This is not the greatest western movie ever, but if you like a little humor and you like Willie Nelson, this is a fun movie. Lots of action and while perhaps predictable, it's fun watching Willie and a lot of good old-time supporting actors. I enjoyed it a lot.",1218931200,,261,4.346938775510204
2071898,1,B00029NLLY,"This movie is not an western action. There only 2 shooting scenes in the whole movie. They looked childish. It's not a western comedy either. There are only a couple of funny scenes. Neither it's a drama. It briefly depicted the triangle love among Willie, the Texas Ranger who chased him, and a lady. The portray was too short to make this film a love story.

The acting is bad too. It's not worth the money.",1199318400,3,409,4.381578947368421

2071900,1,B00029NLLY,This is a very bad movie--D movie--the acting is terrible--plot is poor--what is Richard Widmark doing in a movie this bad at the end of his career?  I guess he needed the money.  Willie Nelson was pretty bad-he should stick to his singing.  This movie is so mickey mouse I barely sat thru it and I traded it in soon after I bought it.  Avoid this one at all costs.!!!!!!!!!!!,1147737600,11,376,4.328571428571428
2071901,4,B00029NLLY,"I do love a good western, and this was a pretty good western.  Although Willie Nelson is not as good an actor as he is a singer, Shaun Cassidy is HOT HOT HOT in this movie.  The first part of the movie is pretty amusing with quite a few old favorite actors, quite a few of whom I believe have since passed on, but it is a pretty good way to spend an hour and a half. With Richard Widmark, Stuart Whitman, Dub Taylor and my all-time favorite western actor, Jack Elam, I really enjoyed this movie.",1130630400,38,495,4.092783505154639

2071971,3,B00029NLLY,"Hey it was made for TV. It looks like it was released on video. Its a sappy old timers win the day over the bad guys. Willie Nelson does a fine job of acting. Shaun Cassidy even looks good. The cast of older western actors is just a neat bonus. The music is annoying because it was made for TV. This may sound a little weird, but I wish Willie would buy out this masterpiece and put some of his music around it. I could think of about 10 of his songs that would have worked with the movie. Sadly as a native Texan I was disappointed this thing was made every where but Texas. It also uses the term territory and Texas in the same sentences. Hey TVland Texas was a sovereign republic (sniff) then a US State. At least they had the right flag in a scene. Also every geographical mention in this movie is dead wrong. Waco is not near Del Rio. This movie is a great movie to introduce small kids to western and safe action films. Worth a free stream off of any streaming service.",1412553600,,975,4.136842105263158

2072016,4,B00029NLLY,"Once Upon a Texas Train

 Near the start of this movie there is a prison scene, where a prisoner is being released. The head administrator and the warden are shown in very sharp looking clothing. However, there is no way one would expect to see such very well dressed individuals working in ome miserable jail. Hence there is a bit of loss in credibility at the start.
 However, this movie is cast as a spoof on westerns, but it is not as good a spoof as:
* The Cheyenne Social Club;
* The Great Scout and Cathouse Thursday;
* The Hallelujah Trail and
* Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
 In spite of these two shortcomings this is a rather interesting movie. One of the major pluses in this movie is to see some of the old characters that were originally seen in such classics as:
* The Over the Hill Gang, and
* The Over the Hill Gang Rides Again.
 The plot features an attempted train robbery 20 years ago. The robbers are caught by the Texas Rangers and shipped off to jail. The head robber (Willie Nelson) is now being released for good behavior. But the minute he is released he, and his brother (Dub Taylor) pull off bank robbery. And they plan to go after the train robbery they bungled 20 years ago. Nelson's aged gang includes:
* former ""Gun-smoke"" deputy, Ken Curtis and
* western character actors, Royal Deno and Gene Evans
 The head of the Texas Rangers (Richard Widmark), who sent Nelson to jail prepares to chase him again. The now somewhat aged Rangers include:
* former ""Rifleman"", Chuck Conners;
* past ""Cimarrin Strip"" marshal, Stuart Whitman and
* former ""Dakota's"" deputy jack Elam.
 This plot is made even more complicated when one learns that Angie Dickinson originally intended to wed the character played by Willie Nelson, but marries the character played by Richard Widmark, when Nelson goes to jail. Despite this complexity, the question on credibility and the lower ranking of it as a spoof, this movie is worth ones time and money. On balance it gets four stars.",1322265600,2,1993,4.597183098591549
2072017,5,B00029NLLY,"They really knew ""funny"" in the '80s! My sisters and I watched this movie and couldn't stop laughing.
Shaun Cassidy is absolutely wonderful. Lots of people think he was a poor actor and was ""in over his head"". . . so not true! He portrays Cotton, a young outlaw gang, perfectly. And you gotta love the trench coat.
I also read some reviews (not necessarily on this site) when people said Willie Nelson should stick to singing or whatever. I thought he was good. He plays a guy who (kinda) wants to be good, but he just can't help it, like it's a bad habit or something.
So many old actors!
The old man on the bike was just too funny. Especially that shot when he's riding down a hill against the sunset and three of his buddies are behind him on horseback.
This is a great movie, a classic, and will always have a place in my home.",1299715200,12,831,4.232704402515723

2072021,4,B00029NLLY,"As is true of so many westerns, this movie is entertaining -- but so wrong.  Scenes involving saguaro can't be filmed in Texas.  Texas was never a U.S. territory; it went from Mexican to independent republic to U.S. state.  And the Brazos doesn't flow through a desert.
  On the other hand, the plot is a jovial little tale.  The story progresses slowly, but has a few twists which keep it entertaining.  And the climactic gunfight near the movie's end  is actually more easily believed than most gun battles in movies.",1279929600,,519,4.688888888888889

I watched many of these actors in different westerns as I was growing up and it was great to see them again.  They were much older in this movie and it was interesting to see them set in a comedy movie, as most of them did serious westerns back in the day.  Jack Elam stole the show in this movie, for me.  His comedic timing is still there, and he can say so much with just a look or a gesture.  The movie was just plain fun to watch.
