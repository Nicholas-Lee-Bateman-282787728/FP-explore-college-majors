Avoid at all costs, the first red flag went off when I saw the way they heralded Billy Zane as the film's superstar on the opening credits, nothing against him, I like his work, but...",1381017600,,296,4.2105263157894735
8501932,1,B006OI0FD4,"There are tons of movies that are shipped out direct to DVD. Some of them are decent films and on occasion you get one where you wonder what folks in Hollywood were thinking when they release some piece of crap and yet release a great movie direct to DVD. And there are movies like MERCENARIES which make you forget about why direct to DVD but how did this movie ever get made to begin with?

The story is fairly simple. The US has an ambassador in the Balkans who's been captured by a ruthless general starting a coup of the country. They need to send in a team to rescue him but if it's an American team the political fall out will be disastrous. Instead, they decide to send in a team of mercenaries.

The team consists of several ex-military types led by Andy Marlow. And this is where things begin to go all wrong. First off the team looks like their uniforms were just purchased from the factory. Even outfits bought at army surplus stores look more worn than these do. Nicely creased, not a speck of dirt and it remains that way through most of the picture. The second thing is that there is no discipline among this team. While Andy is the man in charge, when a group of civilians are about to be killed the entire team ignores his plea to stick to the mission to help them. Mercs as depicted in most films follow orders, stick to plans and get the job done. Here they do what they want, make as much noise as possible while attempting to avoid detection and don't do one thing that would keep the enemy from knowing exactly where they are.

As members of the team are knocked off one at a time, they do rescue the ambassador and his lovely assistant who seems as familiar with weapons as the mercs are. Good thing since their numbers dwindle with each passing minute.

I'd love to say this film had some redeeming quality to it but there isn't a thing that I liked about it. The acting was amateurish at best, the script was terrible and the story lame. Then to cap it off the sets were amazingly bad. The movie looks like it was filmed in some Appalachian forest reserve rather than the Balkans.

Forget whether this movie is worth adding to your collection it's not even worth a rental no matter how low the price. As a matter of fact it's not worth wasting your time to watch if it was free. Pass this one by.",1336953600,,2321,4.302059496567506
8501933,2,B006OI0FD4,"There's about 20 minutes of a good movie here, and the rest is routine, slowly paced and poorly cast. Weakest of all is the guy in the lead, Robert Fucilla, who just doesn't have the emotional weight or grit for this role. In fact, it seems as if his best scenes are the ones where he's not talking. Most of the film involves guys running around in the woods, shooting at each other. The body count is high and the blood spews are plentiful. If only they'd made us care about the people involved.",1332115200,,496,4.287234042553192
8501934,2,B006OI0FD4,"""No Andy...they are wrong."" After a military coup occurs in the Balkins the U.S. ambassador is in trouble. An ex S.A.S. serviceman is picked by Colonel Tourida (Zane) to lead a rescue mission. I have to admit that I like war movies, but like the new batch of western movies lately they seem to be either really good or really bad. It seems that some people assume that if you put a guy in cameo with a gun in a movie people will flock to it regardless of plot. I am not one of those people. To me just because it's a war movie doesn't automatically make it good. This one was very slow and didn't seem to have a point. I lost interest quickly and started to forget what I saw. By the end I was just glad it was over. But on the other hand not everyone thinks like me and many will like this. I just couldn't get into it. Overall, compared to the recent war movies like ""Beneath Hill 60"" and ""Age Of Heroes"" this is not nearly as good. I give it a C-.",1328054400,2,950,4.031746031746032
