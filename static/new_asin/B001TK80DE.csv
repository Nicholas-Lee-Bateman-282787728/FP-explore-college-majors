3791525,3,B001TK80DE,"I think NFL Films has lost the idea of Follies, these recent videos (3 & 4) are just film of bad plays or stupid mistakes, not funny misques by the best in the game.  Still a enjoyable rewatchable show.",1334534400,,202,4.17948717948718
3791526,3,B001TK80DE,"NFL Networks puts out some great productions.  This one is funny but it seems to have the same scenes as quite a few of their other DVD's they've put out.  If you don't already have a large NFL DVD collection, then this one is definitely a good buy.  If you've already got some of the other's produced around this time frame, then you may get more of the same thing you've already got.  It's still pretty funny to watch though and I'm glad I bought it.",1325376000,2,452,4.22093023255814

3791529,4,B001TK80DE,"There's more than just stumbles and falls on this video, but still another fun video in the series.  My young boys get a kick out of watching them, but especially enjoy the first two in the Greatest Follies Series.  There's a couple of stories that are repeats from Vol. 3 which was disappointing.",1262908800,9,297,4.584905660377358
