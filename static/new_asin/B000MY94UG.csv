8173547,5,B000MY94UG,What can I say about Broken Oath that has not been said already this movie whether you watch it in dubbed or the subbed edition this movie is pure quality to the very end. It just sad that they do not make'em like this anymore especially with a female lead. I personal love movies with a strong and intelligent female leads that can kick just as much a#! as their male counterparts and I am a guy I wonder sometime what happen to movies like theses. Great film and a true classic through and through.,1367539200,,500,4.273684210526316
8173548,3,B000MY94UG,"A lovely film that rates 4 or 5 stars, given good video and audio. This English-only version, unfortunately, has merely decent video, and the dubbing is pretty bad. Go for Chinese with subtitles, and you'll find it much more fun.",1287619200,,229,4.75
8173549,3,B000MY94UG,Definitely worth collecting. An old school chop sockey. Low on sense and plot. Good picture but not remastered. Not Ms Mao's best work but not the worst movie she's ever been in either. Do not buy this movie to see Sammo Hung though he's barely in it near the end of the movie in his typical bad guy-henchman role.,1201651200,2,314,4.338983050847458
