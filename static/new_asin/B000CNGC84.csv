8099709,5,B000CNGC84,"Zbigniew Rybczynski is a legendary figure within the field of experimental video.  This DVD contains two of his more compelling works:  A twenty-five minute virtuoso piece of video compositing called ""Steps"", and a twenty-seven minute contemplative film for the Oxberry Animation Stand called, ""The Fourth Dimension"".

""Steps"" is a work for video that utilizes the famous ""Odessa Steps"" sequence from the 1925 silent film ""Battleship Potemkin"", to help serve as a catalyst for interesting ruminations on indifference to human suffering.

The ""Odessa Steps"" sequence consists of ""ruthless soldiers marching down a seemingly endless flight of stairs in a rhythmic, machine-like fashion, while slaughtering a crowd of innocents as they attempt to flee"".  Rybczynski uses special-effects techniques to transport this haunting vision of the Russian revolution into contemporary American times.  He accomplishes this within an imaginary theme park setting, in which American tourists casually witness and intermingle with, the emotionally charged ""Odessa Steps"" footage.

The second piece on this disc, ""The Fourth Dimension"", apparently takes place outside of any historical context.  It's romantic sensibility, of a divine creator seeking to join two creatures together, works to provide a welcome contrast to the emotional intensity found within ""Steps"".

In ""The Fourth Dimension"", a man and woman, mutually inspired by the writings of a mysterious illuminated manuscript, meet and enter into an extended courtship ritual.  During the course of the film, the level of intimacy between the pair gradually increases. The soundtrack by musician Michal Urbaniak helps to provide us with an inspired peek into their spiritual progress towards union.

Special-effects techniques are integral to both works presented here. However, they do not function to provide ""excitement"", as with many current films within the popular cinema.  Rybczynski's effects are used as integral extensions to the evolving art of film and video methodology.  His vision for these new media may be best described as creating a kind of ""surrealistic classicism"".

One can imagine that the destiny of these innovative works will be as perplexing as Rybczynski's vision suggests we might expect...",1143072000,13,2263,5.6765578635014835
