7991394,5,B00009MEDP,"This DVD is of Kylie's very first tour ""Disco In Dream Tour/The Hitman Roadshow"" in 1989. Origanlly released on VHS in 1990, but only in PAL format. So of course living in the states, I've waited 13 years for this DVD to be released in 2003 in NTSC format, a first for me to view this nostalgic piece. Like my title of this review states, this DVD is the first of everything for Kylie. Very first tour, very first concert video release, before the big budgets, before the big productions, before the big extravagant stages, and before the larger ensemble of dancers. This is a ""so must have"" for any Kylie fan just because of that. Yes, the performances are dubbed with the studio mix but only on the singing part, the interaction parts with the crowd is live. You can tell because the singing part is louder than the non-singing parts in each performance. Like another reviewer stated, this was done because of the poor audio when released on video. It wasn't even a distraction throughout the whole show. My only complaint was wanting more, LOL. But am glad at least this was an hours worth of great old Kylie material. For another great nostalgic Kylie DVD, make sure to get ""Live In Dublin"", Kylie's 4th tour ""Let's Get To It Tour"" in 1991. This was another release that was only in PAL format back in 1992, so for us US fans, it took another 19 years for a release in NTSC format in 2011, check out my review on that for more.",1336521600,3,1431,4.424242424242424

7991396,4,B00009MEDP,Kylie is just so young and full of energy! This DVD will probably only appeal to her die hard fans since it's almost from 20 years ago! but it is lots of fun! It's only 80 minutes but it's her first tour ever so if you don't have this one then your Kylie collection isn't complete! I love her! she is just fantastic!,1212364800,2,316,4.031746031746032

7991398,4,B00009MEDP,"I am a huge Kylie fan and this completed my Kylie DVD collection(apart from Showgirl, which I ordered and am waiting for amazon to ship). This DVD was filmed during Kylie's first tour, the Enjoy yourself tour. The DVD isn't the best but fans will appreciate the chance to see a more goofy Kylie than the more polished, more reserved Kylie that we see now. We see Kylie playing a trick on her manager, feeding Japanese fish, rehearsing for the tour, and just being silly with her dancers.

I just have to say that Kylie isn't lip-synching like some other reviewers on here have claimed. She sang everything live on tour and for some reason they dubbed her live tracks over. I'm surprised people think that she's lip-synching because every once a while Kylie will say ""Hey!"" or ""Right up the back"" and the sound changes. So believe me that Kylie did not lip-synch.

Seeing the DVD is funny since it has become dated with the costumes, dancing, and hair but it's still great. Casual Kylie fans may not appreciate this DVD as much has die-hard Kylie fans but your Kylie collection isn't complete without On the go-Live in Japan.",1133481600,2,1124,4.615
7991399,3,B00009MEDP,"well as a huge fan id give this 3 just for being kylie but the sound as people say is not the best! what most people need to know though is that kylie actually sang this tour totally live (like she always does), and there was a live show version on australian tv many years ago, but when they brought it out on vhs- they dubbed over it with the studio vocals! they also used footage from many different shows, even abit from london ! would love to find the proper live version, but this is cool anyway! she sings i should be so lucky live though, but as you can hear- the actual sound system used in the arena sounds crap and dosnt show just how good kylie can belt out hits live (as in ""on a night like this 2001"", ""kyliefever2002"" or ""body language live 2003"") good nostalgic factor though and cool old footage backstage! cant wait to get the awsome ""showgirl"" on dvd later in 2005!",1115769600,7,884,4.236686390532545
7991400,2,B00009MEDP,"I would recommend this DVD only for those loyal fans looking to complete their collections.  The most important ""flaw"" about this concert is that it is lip-synched.  And, as another reviewer pointed out, sometimes she forgets to.  The sound quality is mediocre, as is the level of audience enthusiasm.  On top of that, Kylie doesn't have anywhere near the energy or polish onstage that she has today.  The choreography is very basic and not very inventive.  The show just isn't very fun to watch.  I would highly recommend purchasing her other 3 concert DVDs before this one.  They are much more reprsentative of the modern day Kylie Minogue experience.",1095206400,6,653,4.926605504587156
