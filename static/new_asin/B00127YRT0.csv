I have seen this phenomenal guitarist in concert several times and never tire of his performances.  His musicianship is unrivaled.  I listen to his CD's regularly, in fact I have one playing right now!!!!  As a guitarist, I truly appreciate seeing his technique and relaxed showmanship even if it is always a humbling experience. He makes the complex seem easy.  I know because I try to do this stuff. Each note is clear and resonant. He confidently and perfectly applies dynamics that accentuate tunes with personality. His repertoire is amazing in variation and depth.  Any six and twelve string guitar, if sentient, would be honored to be an instrument of his craftsmanship. As a bonus Richard will get you to easily laugh at his frequently weird stories of his life as a touring musician.  What more could you ask for.... awesome fingerstyle guitar playing and therapeutic humor....well maybe....being an actual member of the audience perhaps?",1325635200,,1104,5.032967032967033
