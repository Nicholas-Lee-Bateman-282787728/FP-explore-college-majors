8603940,3,B001OTZO0C,"It's an ABC Afternoon Special with sour, dour, yet pretty teenage girls dropping pills, swigging booze, and generally doing the randy, delinquent things (i.e. theft, bullying, etc.) that our American brats excel at...especially in Florida (you know who you are).  Anyway, the lead character has a little turn of heart somewhere in the middle, doesn't want to take the rap for something she didn't do, informs on her friends, and well, Danish chicks don't take to that snitch doggin'-out behavior, which leads to our enlightened heroine headed for a catfight showdown.  Needless to say this being Scandinavia, tragedy serves as the bow on this charcoal gray package, and I'm not just talking a couple days' detention.  It's all done rather professionally with just enough shaky-cam to give it MTV cred.  Gather round the kids and tell them this is how they'll end up if they don't learn to read subtitled movies.",1285545600,2,911,5.013245033112582
