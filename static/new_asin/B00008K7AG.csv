1850335,5,B00008K7AG,For me and anyone who grew up in the 60's loved this type of movies the James Coburn Flint and the Dean Martin Matt Helm series are also enjoyable. As a previous reviewer points out the 2 hottest 60's babes Elke Sommer & Sylva Koscina were never select for a Bond film. What their loss is our gain in this movie the only negative no extras of any sort (duh).,1280016000,3,358,4.128571428571429
1850336,4,B00008K7AG,"Deadlier Than The Male is one of the dozens of films to come out during the James Bond craze of the 1960s. It's good tongue in cheek fun,but it doesn't go over the top like the Derek Flint films or Matt Helm movies do. Though in some spots you get the feeling you've walked into an episode of the Avengers. Not that that's a bad thing. There are some purists who don't care for this movie because they say the character Richard Johnson portrays in it isn't really Bulldog Drummond. That's like someone saying that they don't like Kiss Me Deadly because Ralph Meeker isn't really Mike Hammer. You can still enjoy the movie. Johnson is a little bit more Pierce Bronson than Sean Connery,but he's an effective hero. And Nigel Green is all you could want from a villian in this type of film. Also good are the beautiful Elke Sommer and Sylva Koscina as two bitchy and bickering assassins. Also along for the ride is Milton Reid,a British pro wrestler who made a second career of playing villians in gladiator movies and spy films. He was considered for the role of Oddjob in Goldfinger and has a judo match with Johnson in this film. Overall this is a good,entertaining movie. Not quite Goldfinger. But not bad.",1265328000,4,1207,4.541284403669724
1850337,3,B00008K7AG,"Lite 60""s farce with a nod to Bond. Elke Sommer and Sylva Koscina look great and should have been Bond babes. Dvd quality is good, but why the high price? Should be in the $14.99 range. O.K. diversion if you don""t mind the high price.",1247961600,2,234,4.222222222222222
1850338,5,B00008K7AG,"My opinion of Bond films has dropped immensely over the years - they simply don't wear very well. The absurdity of Bond walking around in plain view with thousands of expert assassins unable to kill him (apparently those experts are too nearsighted, or something). And then the absurd Bond dilemmas cooked up by evil geniuses who apparently can't figure out how to kill the Bond fellow, despite possessing every weapon known to man - you catch my drift - Bond's films are so ludicrously illogical that they are almost stupidly funny. This brings us to ""Deadlier ..."", which has the stuff we are actually looking for in these films , with no pretense. Sommer and Koscina are a whole lot more pleasant to look at than any of the dozen or so James Bonds, and Richard Johnson is up to the task as well. I don't own a single Bond film, but
wouldn't do without ""Deadlier ...""",1235520000,5,869,4.54140127388535
1850339,4,B00008K7AG,"Jumping on the Bond wagon, producer Sydney Box decided to take on one of 007's antecedents and update him to the swinging sixties. Thus Sapper's square jawed, colonial defender of the Empire, Bulldog Drummond, became international insurance investigator Hugh Drummond, played with suave charm by one time Bond candidate Richard Johnson. The other shrewd move by the producers was to avoid the over spoofing of Bond's world that the other rivals had laden themselves with and instead devise a film that balanced the right amount of tongue in cheek thrill with a neatly structured script, above average production values, a cool theme song by Scott Walker, and a cracking finale worthy of a Bond caper itself.

Elke Sommer breezes across like a force ten hurricane as the film's titular assassin, working for the world class villain Carl Peterson, portrayed with the right blend of light and dark by Nigel Greene. The film's climatic showdown between hero and nemesis, in which Drummond traps Peterson on his own giant chess set and crushes him with the robotic pieces, is a memorable piece of imagery that helped lift the film above the bigger budgeted hackwork of Matt Helm or Derek Flint.

A hit in its time, Johnson returned as Drummond three years later in an uninspired follow up that, with its use of ""fembots"" and a younger Peterson back from the dead without explanation, strayed too much into the territory of the other Bond spoofs and was deservedly buried.

Deadlier Than the Male, after decades of neglect, now appears to be re emerging as a cult film, thanks in part to Quentin Tarentino naming it as one of his favourite movies. This led to a newly restored printed being screened at Cannes and is now finally on DVD, complete with its sequel.",1229558400,6,1756,4.866220735785953
1850340,3,B00008K7AG,"The James Bond craze of the 1960s sent studios scurrying to secure the rights to other literary secret agents and detectives, and alter them to fit the successful 007 formula. Novelist H. C. McNeile's creation ""Bulldog Drummond"" was showcased in numerous mystery films in the '20s and '30s; for this 1966 spy movie, however, the urbane sleuth was reconfigured into a carbon copy of Bond.

Like the Bond films, there's a strong (and welcome) emphasis on female villainy, represented here in the shape-make that shapes-of blonde Elke Sommer and brunette Sylvia Koscina. They're stunning and, as such, the primary reasons to sit through this run-of-the-mill rehash of the kind of spy movie clichs that Mike Myers has made a cottage industry out of satirizing.",1133136000,8,756,5.096774193548387
1850341,1,B00008K7AG,"This is one of several movies that cashed in on the Bond craze.  This particular one is the worst of the copies.  The low budget limits the exotic location shots and make the story very slow and dragging.  There are none of the artistic photographic angles and effects common in the Bond films.  It is about an insurance investigator who is looking into organized crime.  The plot is totally devoid of any imagination or surprises.  The one unusual feature is that some of the gratuitous violence is done by women who appear to be bored with their violent work.  The women and their clothes were very flashy by standards of 40 years ago, but will have no romantic effects on healthy men of today.  Notice how the women piled their hair on top of their head and then wrapped a turban around it.",1093996800,5,793,4.496503496503497
1850342,3,B00008K7AG,"Though I thought this film was pleasant enough, it ultimately was neither campy enough or action packed enough to ever get me too excited.
The plot feels second rate, the hero as played by Richard Johnson is about as bland as you get and any attempts at campy humor were too subtle to ever make me laugh.
All but serious student of 60's pop culture are probably going to feel a little disappointed after purchasing this film.  It isn't nearly as good or fun as the cover illustration makes it seem.",1060560000,9,498,4.472527472527473
1850343,5,B00008K7AG,"If you like James Bond, get this movie.
Yes, this is the best of all the Bond knock-offs produced in the mid-to-late Sixties, and there were a lot of them!  Unlike spoofs like Modesty Blaise and Casino Royale, Deadlier Than the Male is actually a good movie in its own right.  The production values are higher than most other sub-Bond spy films of the period (although nowhere near as high as those of Mr. Bond himself), the acting is good, the action is good, and the script is witty.  Elke Sommer (at her absolute hottest!) steals the show as a voluptious assassin, but Richard Johnson makes a darn good hero, too.  His character's relationship with his nephew is quite well-done, and a scene where the nephew brings a lady back to his uncle's apartment is a comedic hightlight (somewhat reminiscent of The Pink Panther).  The murders are all very creative (think Avengers) and rather violent for the time period.  The setpieces are great, especially the climax where hero Bulldog Drummond faces the villain (an amazing Nigel Green) on a giant chessboard filled with oversize pieces.  If you like Sixties James Bond movies, or the Pink Panther movies, or TV shows like The Avengers, you'll like Deadlier Than the Male.  (The Walker Brothers theme song is amazing, too, on par with many of the great Bond themes!)  All in all, a great Bond-style action-comedy.  Deadlier Than the Male is to Thunderball as XXX is to Die Another Day (only both those sixties movies are better to their 2002 counterparts).  Bond in everything but name.  (And budget.)
I'm so glad this movie is finally on DVD!  As far as I know, it had never been officially released even on VHS before, so all I'd seen previously was a poor-quality bootleg.  The dvd offers no features, and the print is a bit scratchy at times, but the widescreen transfer looks nice and it's infinitely superior to the bootlegs!  I'd like to see the sequel, Some Girls Do, released as well, though it's nowhere near as good as this one.",1054684800,50,1987,4.702312138728324

1850353,4,B00008K7AG,I just finished watching the movie Deadlier than the Male. I really enjoyed it. It is a good spin on the action movies of the sixties. The story moves briskly and the 2 female leads are attractive and deliver fine performances. This is not Bond or a made up agent it is Bulldog Drummond a well documented and oftened filmed character in British literature. the movie grabs you right from the opening scene where 2 lovely ladies come out of the water with spear guns. You know they are there for trouble. I recommend it to anyone in on Bond films or the sixties action films. You will find it quite enjoyable.,1302566400,3,608,4.4375
7985169,4,B00008K7AG,"Very good. Better than most 60s spy movies, which I love in general. This was hard to find and kind of expensive at first offering. I waited until a seller with a lower price appeared and BOOM, I bought it.",1478390400,,206,4.175
7985170,2,B00008K7AG,"Turning 1930's detective Bulldog Drummond into a budget James Bond in the 1960's might have seemed like a good idea at the time but it's kind of hard to take if you happen to be a fan of the character or the many old movies made about him.  This has nothing to do with the original series in which Bulldog Drummond was a rich British gentleman with a helpful butler who keeps stumbling into trouble, solving crimes and foiling spies, much to the annoyance of Scotland Yard which feels that crime solving should be left to the professionals.

This version of Bulldog Drummond is a James Bond wannabe all the way.  The character is (apparently) an insurance investigator, not the most promising profession for a James Bond knock-off.  Drummond tries to track down a pair of beautiful female assassins who murdered his friend and also an oil tycoon, blowing up his plane in the opening sequence.  The problem is that any idiot should be able to figure out who at least one of the killers is--she comes to an oil company promising that in exchange for a million pounds opposition to a merger will be eliminated within six months--then the man who opposes the merger is killed.  When the board of said oil company splits on whether to make good on the million pound contract or not and she suggests that they vote again the next day and that very evening the most strident opposition to making the payment falls to his death.  You don't need to be a master detective to connect the dots with the killings--shouldn't solving a mystery involve there actually being one?  What is there for Drummond to even investigate?

But this Drummond is less an amateur sleuth than a low-grade James Bond, bedding various women with his irresistible charm, narrowly avoiding frequent attempts on his life, adept at judo and never breaking a sweat.  Deadlier Than The Male's mastermind villain isn't very interesting, either.  Rather than trying to take over the world he's simply someone trying to turn assassination into a lucrative business--and doing virtually nothing to cover his tracks.

The script is by Hammer Studios writer Jimmy Sangster, who is operating pretty far outside of his wheelhouse here.  He doesn't give director Ralph Thomas much to work with in terms of action or intrigue, which makes this pretty uneventful as James Bond wannabe's go.  Lead Richard Johnson is a complete stiff who seems to have been hired because he looks like he lost the audition to actually play James Bond.  Despite its mediocrity on every level, Deadlier Than the Male was apparently successful enough to justify a sequel, a movie called Some Girls Do which was the swan song for the series.

I'm guessing people who aren't fans of classic Bulldog Drummond will find this easier to take than it was for me, but I still don't see how anyone could actually sit through this without being bored silly.  Then again, I was never a fan of James Bond knock-offs so it might just be that I'm not the best audience for this one.",1468108800,,2997,4.732692307692307
7985171,3,B00008K7AG,"Claims are this is a great James Bond spoof. Not much played for laughs here at all. It's pretty much a straight spy flick only more industrial espionage than an evil genius trying to topple governments. Although Elke Sommer and Sylva Koscina are smokin' hot '60s babes in this, they are not in the movie enough. Most of the story is just plain silly especially the voice command computer controlled gigantic chess board.

7985175,5,B00008K7AG,"007 spewed a cottage industry of inspired spy flics, and this is one of the best. Although not technically a spy, Richard Johnson's resurrection of the iconic ""Bulldog"" Drummond , as an insurance investigator for a large corporation, definitely drifts into James Bond territory. He's suave, sophisticated and a definite ladies' man, while being a guy who has no problem taking care of himself amongst various baddies and henchmen. With equal parts of suspense and humour, DTTM delivers the goods in a dozen different ways-including a fantastic set piece at the end of the film, hinted at by the title of my review. I won't say anymore, because if this is your first time watching it, you're definitely in for a treat! One last thing-I've watched this over and over a number of times, and I've come to the conclusion that star Richard Johnson would've made a perfect James Bond-certainly equal to Sean Connery as he appeared in the role at the time.",1427241600,,948,4.822085889570552
7985176,3,B00008K7AG,"The Secret Agent genre found its heyday during 60s. Ian Fleming's success spread across many mediums and a wide variety of talents - novels, magazines, newspaper strips, comics, and of course, television; where UNCLE and IMF became commonplace acronyms and a pair of steampunk agents roamed the Wild West.

And in 1966 saw the return of Hugh ""Bulldog"" Drummond to public audiences. A lightweight rendition of James Bond - if 007 were an insurance agent. <g>

Riding the coattails of its superior counterpart, I found myself engaged following the adventures of the top field investigator for Phoenician Oil, the current employer of our man Drummond.

The story opens with an airborne assassination.

A lethal female contractor bombs a passenger jet and parachutes herself to safety; the death of innocents merely to eliminate a single person reveals the ruthless tactics she and her employer are willing to engage in order to advance their agenda.*

For unknown reasons, Irma and her equally beautiful partner Penelope, are quietly murdering influential oil businessmen across Europe. But when the growing body count includes the death of a friend, Bulldog is hot on the trail of the nefarious nogoodniks, whose long-range plans are global domination - naturally.

Infused with funny one-liner quips given these productions, including one highlighted by sultry Elke Sommer who gleefully tosses a paralyzed victim off a building and dryly comments to her partner in crime, ""Well, I've had men fall for me before - but never like this"", immediately followed by the jazzy trumpet riff made so famous by Cubby Broccoli.

Speaking of the late producer, this movie is notable because lead Richard Johnson was one of the finalists for the role that eventually went to Sean Connery. While it's clear that the Scottish actor was the far superior choice, it's not too much of a stretch to see R.J. as a debonair British gentleman with a quick wit and crack shot aim.

Thankfully, this wasn't as campy as the notorious ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Goldfoot/dp/B008FYZHPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Goldfoot</a>"" films.

Entertaining enough to keep one's attention for the duration of the flick.

Movie Notes:

- *A frighteningly realistic destruction of a passenger plane by a lone female assassin was later filmed for the first season of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24/dp/B00J2G1Z2U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24</a>"".

- Features what was then the must-have garish display of wealth for the 1%: A ridiculous remote-controlled  chess board made up of life-sized pieces.

Personal Note:

- This production struck a chord with me and one of the most fascinating ""up yours"" in cinema history --- after losing the role of 007 due to contractual issues with NBC Studios, Pierce Brosnan's portrayal of a cold war warrior in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fourth-Protocol/dp/B004OB2EYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fourth Protocol</a>"" was an amazing tour-de-force blend of revenge mixed with pointed accusation designed specifically to silence detractors and invalidate the past.",1426636800,,3666,6.272908366533865
7985177,5,B00008K7AG,"Definitely watch ""Deadlier Than the Male."" You'll be in for a real treat. But if you want to own a copy, save your money, and hold out for/demand a superior-quality disc that this film very much deserves. Here's why:

FIVE STARS for an delightfully deft, light, and deceptively clever romp - a thinking man's/woman's take-off on the iconic Bond series.

This inventive, stylishly playful satire features the distinguished, classically-trained, brilliantly versatile Richard Johnson* in the lead. Johnson portrays Drummond effortlessly: with debonaire, masculine charm, sexy intelligence, and perfectly wry humor. His Drummond is sophisticated but sporty, classy but not stuffy, and exudes a charismatic charge/threat that's understated but in no way effete. Not unlike Bond, he moves (and thinks) with sharp, cool grace. But unlike Bond's animalistic, devil-may-care image, Johnson's Drummond has just the right stroke of irony and warmth to keep him interesting. Then there's Nigel Green as a Brit baddie who's more credibly calculating than cartoonish. And Elke Sommer and Sylvia Koscina play the psychopathic sirens who wield their harpoons as perfectly (and lusciously) as their comic timing!

Plus, the relationship between Drummond and his (U.S. American) nephew is refreshing, something rarely seen in movies - a central element that grounds the movie's hijinks (and certain moments of legitimately disturbing violence by the duo of female assassins) with a human, but no less humorous, touch. Then there's Zia Mohyeddin as a young oil heir, and Lee Montague as an erstwhile con-man gone clean, who give brief but memorably likable portrayals against stale stereotype. Convincing, smart, fun performances all around - and the same for the movie's script and direction.

And what's a Bond-style caper without some martial arts, right? In this one, Drummond first appears on screen practicing judo, then karate throughout. But, at one point, he also slips in a clever move that's rarely seen in mainstream Western movies - voila! What fun it might have been, then, to see Johnson's Drummond and Elke Sommer's psycho-killer-vixen go at it, martial-arts style, one-on-one!

As other reviewers have already noted, this movie is a welcome pleasure of 1960s fun. But it's impressive precisely because its style enhances, rather than diminishes, its approach. As a result, it achieves the incredible: it doesn't feel dated. To that end, it certainly helps that ""Deadlier"" is more on the lines of credible fantasy-entertainment, versus cheesy, over-the-top, gatchet-ladden ridiculousness. And its sexy (but not sexist), light-brush treatment is consistent throughout. Delightfully, the movie doesn't take itself seriously, yet in its most unflashy moments, it quietly does (when and where it most counts). These elements make ""Deadlier"" strikingly appealing, and it shows. It's stood the test of time, and gets even better with age. All in all, a bona fide cult classic. A real winner!

However...

ONLY HALF A STAR FOR THE BAD QUALITY OF THIS DVD (by Hen's Tooth Video). I've seen a clean, pristine, digital print of this movie elsewhere. Because of that comparison, I can say that this DVD is not up to standard, and certainly not acceptable for the price of $20. The color is badly off (example: flesh tones are red). The picture resolution is grainy, like a bootleg copy of a bad print. The picture contrast is too strong (example: where color details should be clear, you instead see vague/shadowy/silhouette darkness). The main menu even smacks of a cheap, bootleg product. No special features on the disc, either.

Evidently, no care was taken in the digital transfer of this film to disc, which is a real shame. Because this is one of those truly rare gems of pop-culture cinema: a stylish yet intelligent, classy, and thoroughly unpretentious pleasure to watch. It not only offers a sly interpretation of the Bond 'mythos' and 'mystique', but stands entirely on its own merits. (I agree with other positive reviews here that ""Deadlier"" is even better than many of the Bond movies.)

For these reasons, this movie is not only of its time, but still delivers nearly 50 years later. And is far superior to most of the pablum and swill that pass for movie entertainment (or 'actors') today. (I wish the same could be said of this movie's sequel, ""Some Girls Do,"" which is outright dreadful, and painfully dated in ways that ""Deadlier"" successfully avoids.)

* Johnson is a true actor's actor - one of jaw-dropping dexterity and range, unusually thoughtful intelligence, and exceptional nuance and restraint. Devoted to his craft, his performances are marked by naturalness over histrionics or hollow mechanics, grandstanding ego, or pretense. Over a phenomenally impressive 70-year career, to date, he has remained more interested in a passionate yet humble fidelity to the diverse, interesting, often intriguing characters he portrays (and the variety of projects he feels fortunate to be a part of) rather than in stardom or fame. From Shakespeare on stage, to classic Greek tragedies and period pieces, to cult horror and independent/foreign films, he's racked up a dizzyingly wide array of roles. His gifts are in a very elite class, yet few in the U.S. are familiar with him or his lesser-known roles. (He's mostly known for his role in the psychological horror classic ""The Haunting."" That is, the original 1963 version directed by Robert Wise.) Very, very few actors come anywhere close to Johnson's incredibly nimble, distinctive talent. If you appreciate subtlety, depth, and keen intelligence, seek out his most interesting other work. You'll be blown away.

For those who don't know the history of the Bond franchise, Richard Johnson was, according to various sources, among the choices (if not the first choice) of Terence Young, the director of ""Dr. No,"" to assume the role of Bond. To this viewer, Johnson was the most convincing, compelling 'Bond-who-almost-was'. And I say this as a fan of Connery's Bond (who's suave yet brutally dangerous and sociopathic - as real spies tend to be). Johnson himself has been gracious in openly acknowledging, without regret, that Connery ultimately was the right (and rightly subversive) choice to play the part and for the good of the franchise at its start. The fun for this viewer is in appreciating the distinct contrasts between Johnson's Drummond and Connery's Bond on screen, relative to how author Ian Fleming originally conceived the Bond character, and how various directors, screenwriters, and other actors have presented the Bond image differently and at its best.",1426464000,4,6631,5.252124645892351
