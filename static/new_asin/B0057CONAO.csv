8460505,4,B0057CONAO,"Good video, but a bit advanced for beginners. I love his books so was hoping more for a lesson and techniques video.  Viewer must already know chords though most are pretty basic.  Ill be revisiting the easier tunes and Im sure given time will be able to play along with most. Production is a bit lacking...would have preferred more close up on positions of hands etc.  Mr. Beloff is a highly likable character, or at least appears to be.",1386374400,,438,4.518987341772152
8460506,4,B0057CONAO,The video assumes you already have played some and know your cords.  I enjoy it and is still a little challenging which helps to push me.  It still is fun.  I would buy another when I am ready.  Came quickly and very pleased.,1364428800,,225,4.162790697674419
8460507,4,B0057CONAO,"I loved this DVD.  Jim doesn't teach a whole lot, merely gives a few pointers that are REALLY, REALLY helpful. He also plays the songs in a manner that a rookie can at least partly follow along and moreso as the rookie's technique improves.  It's one thing to learn on your own.  It's another to make the songs sound right and Jim's DVD helps with the latter.  As he's playing, the chord changes flash on the screen so you don't have to try and read them on the sheet music while watching him.

I get the impression from the DVD that Jim is one of the most likeable personalities in the ukulele world.  And that is saying a lot in the ukulele world!

The DVD comes with a PDF that contains melodies (sheet music) and chords for all the songs that he plays.  Those songs are also included in his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Daily-Ukulele-365-Songs-for-Better-Living-DAILY-UKULELE-Paperback/dp/B008LBBP2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Daily Ukulele: 365 Songs for Better Living  [DAILY UKULELE] [Paperback</a>] book.

I gave only 4 stars because the backdrop used in the DVD could be a whole lot better.  It is essentially a black curtain, looks like a home produced DVD.",1359158400,,1539,6.074074074074074
