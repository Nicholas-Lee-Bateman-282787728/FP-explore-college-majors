471115,4,6302479487,"When a deaf-mute homeless man is accused of murdering a federal worker in Washington DC, the public defender assigned to the case assumes he is guilty--until she begins to receive tips about the case from the most unlikely of sources: a member of the jury seated for the trial.  Any one even remotely conversant with the law will find the story so full of loopholes that it is more than a little ridiculous, but it scarcely matters: the cast carries it off in fine style, playing the script with exceptional precision and poise and generating plenty of suspense along the way. Cher is particularly noteworth as the public defender assigned to the case.  Cher?  Playing a Washington D.C. attorney?  It's hardly typecasting, but once more Cher demonstrates the depth of her talent: not only is she extremely effective, she is completely believable. The same might be said for both Liam Neeson, who plays the deaf-mute on trial, and Dennis Quaid, who plays the smarmy juror who begins to put two and two together; SUSPECT is clearly Cher's picture, but her co-stars are every bit as good as she.
Although it has its share of courtroom pyrotechnics and suspenseful moments, SUSPECT is a surprisingly low-key and all the more successful for it. When all is said and done we like the characters as people, believe in them, and are glad we met them.  While it will never compete with the likes of Hitchcock, SUSPECT is a good, solid, and very unpretentious courtroom thriller excuted with a great deal of style.  Those whose tastes run in that direction will be very pleased indeed. Recommended.",1015286400,19,1588,4.819852941176471
471116,4,6302479487,"This movie has Cher playing a public defender who assigned a case against Liam Nesson. During the course of the trial ,she get involved with one of the jurors(Dennis Quaid,Any Given Sunday).Quaid is a lobbyist who has  connections to the big policticans in Washington D.C. Eventually both Quaid  and Cher discover who the really killer is. The movie is very suspeseful  and mushy as Quaid and Cher fall in love a little. This movie also co-stars  John Mahoney(Frasier,Betrayed) and Joe Montegna(Baby's Day Out) as a judge  and a public defender for the country! Now if the studio would please put  this movie on DVD I'll be happy to replace my VHS tape for the superior DVD  format!",955843200,4,682,4.777777777777778
471117,4,6302479487,"An original tale of corruption within the justice system. Cher defendsa vagrant, played by Liam Neeson, accused of murdering a legal secretary who worked for a supreme court justice, who had committed suicide. Randy Quaid  plays a reluctant juror with dubious moral ethics, whose interest in the case  takes 2nd place to his interest in the public defender. I liked the chemistry between these two. It was almost palpable. I also liked the cold, forbiding  photography, depicting the Capital as a harsh, forbidding and uncaring place. Not the greatest mystery thriller, but certainly watchable,especially with Cher in a starring role, and not a sparkle of glitter or naked skin.",938476800,8,678,5.201834862385321
471158,5,6302479487,"This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again. And I do watch it often when I just need good background to whatever I'm doing. I like courtroom dramas. Sort of a movie length Law and Order except that the attorney is in danger. Not really violent. The mystery is a good one. I also put ""Presido"" in that category though it isn't a courtroom drama. Also Cher and Dennis Quaid along with Liam Neeson are fun. Spoiler alert: Fraiser's dad makes a great villain.",1521331200,,473,4.325842696629214

She's brilliant (when isn't she?) and the writing was actually very good too, I didn't see the twists coming at all. A little gem I'd not heard about, but one I'm glad I took the time to watch.

471178,2,6302479487,"Cliched and silly, Suspect has Cher's mesmerizing performance to recommend it. It's not enough to save the film, but it yields some fairly solid scenes between her and co-stars, Liam Neeson and Dennis Quaid. The plot starts off solid but then devolves into dreck. By the end you'll be left saying ""oh please"" - words, effectively to describe any Blu-ray marked as a 30th anniversary edition that offer virtually no extra features and a 1080p transfer that is only marginally appealing. Bottom line: Suspect is highly suspect as an entertainment. Cher gets top marks. But even she cannot save this turkey.",1512864000,,604,4.99009900990099

Love the simmering attraction after Cher realizes Quaid really wants to help her.  She's so gorgeous. It's also refreshing to see a film about a public defender as opposed to a prosecutor.  Since we live in such an authoritarian classist pro-kkkop society, it's unusual to see films about the working class in a positive light. Man, that  is a young Liam Neeson playing the deaf mute guy! I don't see how anybody can walk around in a courthouse after hours, though, including the attorneys but this film is pre-9/11, when a lot more fake paranoia and authoritarianism got underway.

471360,1,6302479487,A very good movie... The movie is NOT the problem... There is only one listing for the English versions of this movie... That listing says ANAMORPHIC 1.85... The 4x3 versions are included under this listing... The 4x3 version is cropped from the 1.85 version... I have the 1.85 version as a low quality AVIi file...  That is why I know that Amazon needs listings for the 4x3 version and the 1.85 version...  With this need comes the fact that ALL sellers of this product would then put their offering under the CORRECT listing...  Amazon reviews have a basic problem... All DVD (no matter which version) reviews are under all listings... This make the reviews often WORTHLESS...,1451433600,,678,4.827586206896552

471452,4,6302479487,"Anyone who thinks that the United States legal justice system is fair and balanced has been watching too many movies. The poor and the marginalized get convicted and the rich and elite drive away from the courthouse. It's largely a matter of the size of the pocketbook. And it's still amazing how many innocent people are locked away with almost no hope of getting out. ""Suspect"" is how about a how a homeless man (Liam Neesom) and his public defender (Cher) find themselves in a case that has much larger ramifications than a simple matter of did a homeless person murder the victim for $9.

The aspect that makes this movie a gem is the fine acting: Cher as the overworked and underpaid public defender, Liam Neeson as the deaf/mute defendant in one of his first major roles, Dennis Quaid as a sexy lobbyist (often messing around with congresswomen to get votes for his industry) turned juror turned amateur sleuth, and John Mahoney as the stoic judge at the trial. A lot of it is pure fantasy but the moments in the courtroom are actually very much like a real courtroom in its obsessiveness with procedure and protocol.

The story begins with the suicide of a prominent Supreme Court Justice and the subsequent murder of his assistant who has been slashed to death. When police investigate the surrounding area, they find a homeless man sporting a knife and in possession of the victim's wallet which contained a king's ransom: $9. Cher is appointed to take the case, and Quaid ends up becoming one of the jurors. Because of the suicide at the beginning of the film, Judge Helms (Mahoney) becomes one of the people on the US President's short list to fill the Supreme Court vacancy. Helms requests to preside over the murder case to free up his later schedule in order that he be considered for the vacancy.

Several scenes take us into the bowels of the homeless of Washington DC. We see a lot of lawyers, a lot of law libraries and a lot of knives. Every homeless person appears to wield a knife. Cher with the unlawful help of Quaid (lawyers and jurors in the same trial are not supposed to commiserate, let alone team up) stumbles upon some evidence that makes the case much more complex. A thoroughly enjoyable courtroom drama with enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat, and an interesting commentary on the justice system and how it handles the poor and the homeless. Unfortunately, public defenders are probably not as successful as Cher appears to be.",1431043200,,2476,4.661327231121281

A woman receives an envelope for Christmas from a man. Afterwards this man uses his shotgun. Later a group of swimmers find the body of that woman! The police find that woman's wallet in the possession of a homeless man living in a storm drain. Case solved? Carl Wayne Anderson is arrested. Miss Kathleen Riley is his Public Defender. They start off on the wrong foot. The accused is ""deaf and dumb""! Two politicians discuss a farm bill in Washington. Its not easy for Miss Riley to converse with her client. He describes ""Michael"" who found the body. Can she find this man with a private investigator? Miss Riley examines the jurors. Mr. Sanger is a lobbyist. The private investigator finds the man described, but he escapes. The trial goes on.

The Prosecutor does his job against Anderson. [Why was nobody around at this parking lot?] Anderson suffered from contracting meningitis at a VA hospital and became handicapped. The pathologist waffles on a point of evidence. Is the judge biased against Riley? Juror Sanger talks to a Parking Lot attendant. Then he talks to a homeless woman about an identification pin. [Would such actions get him into trouble in the real world even if he was not a juror?] There is drama from a sudden attack at the Union railway station. [Believable at a busy public place?] Anderson writes he is ""innocent"". Riley and Sanger meet again. The Judge threatens Riley over meeting Sanger. Sanger has an idea where that pin came from. They find the body of another murder victim. Will this affect the trial? They find the lock for that key in a Justice Department locker. [Could strangers gain access to this building?]

Riley and Sanger meet in a library. The trial judge arrives. They use a computer with a light pen to let Anderson testify in court. This brings out his past actions. In the rainy night someone breaks into a car in a parking lot and takes a tape cassette. [Would someone really put a confession on a tape cassette?] A fire alarm goes off in a building. Riley goes to a courthouse for research. Who is following her? Kathleen marks his arm. The next day there are conflicts in the courtroom! Will the guilty person be identified as ""red handed""? Will the defendant be cleared when Riley accuses the real murderer? [Do you find this ending believable?]

It is a good story except for a plot that could have had a better ending. The 1963 novel ""The Seventh Juror"" had a similar plot. A better writer and script would create a better story. This was made just after the ""Contragate"" scandal when the Reagan-Bush administration was enabling drug smuggling into the USA. The details are in the book ""Compromised"" by Terry Reed. Who was the Governor of Arkansas then? Senators approve all Federal judges. Can this power be used to affect trials?",1356912000,,2807,4.722448979591837

471584,4,6302479487,"One of my favorite roles in Cher's career as a top-actress in the 1980s, pulls off being a lonely, middle-aged, defense attorney of a homeless-deaf-military veteran (Liam Neeson) who is accused of murder.  Dennis Quaid also is a DC lobbyist who tries to skip out on another jury duty but finds himself more intrigued to help the innocent go free. Based off of a few things I've read in the past not many hardcore Cher fans wasn't too keen on this film because it wasn't in her element, but for me, it was quite surprising and showed her range as an actress.  This also is the first time I ever seen of Liam Neeson and Dennis Quaid and they both do very good jobs in their roles.

The only hard thing to believe in this is that a juror (Dennis Quaid) would bother himself to poke around as he did.

However given his ego and intelligence and high observation skills - and an interest in (Cher) I could go along with his sleuthing and fairly reckless behavior for the sake of the movie.

471621,4,6302479487,"Given prime time news headlines of today, it is no stretch to imagine as fact the politics and corruption within the legal system that this movie touches against.

Some of it does come off as far fetched - with regards to the juror (Dennis Quaid) and his relationship with the public defender (Cher) who got stuck with what appeared to be a lost cause in defending the homeless man (Liam Neeson) who had been in the wrong place at the worst possible time. Also, the fact that once the jury was ordered ""sequestered"" after their forbidden contact was observed, Quaid still had no problem being out and about conducting his own detective work which I consider an impossibility.

But a few weaknesses can be forgiven; because it definitely was a story disclosing the vulnerability of the powerless when accused that could certainly happen; through ""rush to judgement"" without due process if for no other reason. And I had no trouble at all believing that informed people can be ""eliminated"" should they become a liability to those that consider themselves ""above the law"" - even as they they profess to uphold it.

Liam Neeson turns in a good performance as the ""suspect"". It's a better than average movie and I enjoyed it.  And anyway, IMO, Dennis Quaid in his heyday is good enough, no matter what else happens in the movie!",1310256000,,1323,4.739130434782608

There are lots of people with dubious agendas, one of whom is a lobbyist played by Dennis Quaid.  There are also lots of other suspects.  If you guess the `Baddie` in this film, you will be doing well.

471623,5,6302479487,"I remember seeing this movie when it came out in 1987. I loved it! It was one of my first times seeing a movie actually filmed mostly in my hometown. Seeing the locations had me wanting to go visit them personally. Yes, the movie had that much of an effect on me!

DC has changed in the now 30 years since the movie was shot. The Justice Department facade shown in the movie is sans the current 21st century barricades, for example. But the flavor of the city has not changed. All of the locations I recognize still to this day.

The actors were great. Peter Yates succesfully integrated all the speaking parts along with those of the extras to create an exciting melenge that bolsters this picture. The cast had a real chemistry together. I'm glad to have seen it again after some 15 years (Now Eight). I rediscovered it on a VHS tape I'd dubbed from Showtime in 1995. I thoroughly enjoyed it and all the other movies it contained. Suspect is a movie I really enjoyed and I plan to purchase it on DVD as soon as I can. I wish they had it on widescreen, however.

Kathleen Riley is an overworked, underpaid public defender that stumbles upon a case that has conspiracy written all over it. With the illegal help of a juror she is able to chase down leads that otherwise would never have come to her. By the end of the story she escapes a killer while discovering who the murderer of Kathleen Quinn was.

My questions are: Who was the defense attorney who was part of the conspiracy? The presiding judge committed suicide when the truth was discovered. The prosecutor at the time would become a judge and then murderer. Who was the defense attorney at the time and who was the defendant? One more query. Who murdered the homeless guy? These are things that have egged at me for years. Buy this DVD. I've added a few extra paragraphs since my first review of the film in 2010. This time I saw it on DVD. It's a great one!

They don't show blood and guts to make this a great movie- they tell a story. Its very hard in today's immediate gratification world to find movies that tell stories without giving the plot away in the first 30 minutes.

Cher and Liam have good chemistry...I enjoy legal thrillers and movies that are still enjoyable even after I know the ending....

a Supreme Court Justice Takes his own life.
A woman is found dead, a victim of a grisly murde A homeless Vietnam vet stands accused.
Kathleen Riley (Cher) is an overworked Washington D.C. public defender who needs a vacation. Instead, she is assigned another case. But this is no ordinary crime, with no ordinary criminal.

Lobbyist Eddie Sanger (Dennis Quaid) gets saddled with jury duty just when a critical bill is coming up for vote. While on jury duty, Eddie discovers evidence critical to Kathleen's case and contacts her outside the courtroom... a real violation of the law.

Bizarre evidence leads Kathleen on a dangerous trail from Washington's seamy underbelly to the highest levels of government. And the closer she gets to the answer, the more her life is in danger.

Back at the time it was made it was fresh enough to warrant your full attention, but now you may find yourself distracted. Cher plays a decent lawyer, Neeson does okay as a homeless veteran, and Quaid is a reasonably good lobbyist. However; no role is a stand out. You will feel like it is a TV movie you have seen before. By all means rent it. You may not have seen that many of this type law thriller movies. But if you are a fan of Grisham and other law movies, you may find it familiar. I wasn't disappointed in it, but I felt I knew what would happen next the whole time. And I was right. Cher is an attorney for Liam Neeson, a homeless Viet Nam veteran, that is accused of murdering a young woman. Dennis Quaid is a milk lobbyist that is on the jury for Neeson's trial. Things get out of hand when Quaid starts to investigate what really happened and feeds the information to Cher. Illegal? Yes but after all this is a Hollywood movie about the law, not the real law.

I like Dennis Quaid, and he complimented Cher's character. Were some of the antics in the movie unrealistic? Such as Quaid visiting the homeless people in the middle of the night?

471664,1,6302479487,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen! It is more or less  bad copy of the masterpiece To Kill A Mockingbird. The original has deeply meaningful script and stunning performances. Suspect is shallow. It is a great example of how not to make movies. The plot is variation of To Kill A Mockingbird's story. They've changed the lawyer's sex - it is now female and the defendant is a white, not a black man. Cher's  pathetic imitation of Gregory Peck's brilliant performance makes the whole court process in Suspect  a farce. She even asks her client fetch an object, to prove he is innocent. Didn't Gregory Pack do the same?  Yes, he did it.  I understand how difficult it must be to make an original film these days. Everything original is implemented and exploited to death. Some repetition is inevitable and in fact necessary. But copying great ideas and making bad movies is ridiculous. There is still room for originality but it is probably hard work. So the makers of Suspect chose an easy solution: steal the plot of a masterpiece, modernize it, have couple of  popular names in the cast and you have a movie! Wrong, simply wrong!

Film is one of the greatest achievements of human intelligence. It is also a tremendous opportunity for talented people with vision to express themselves and  make a difference. Shame on these who don't possess what it takes and abuse it.

471666,4,6302479487,"For a while, Cher was a big box-office attraction the way actresses like Julia Roberts and Reese Witherspoon are today.  She made a string of very successful and well-loved films during her brief moment as an A-list actress, and while this one is definitely first-rate, it is possibly the most underappreciated.

For starters, the cast does a spectacular job with what could have been a disastrous movie.  Cher is amazing as always, Liam Neeson is great, and even Dennis Quaid, in an earlier role, is pretty good.  The interraction between the characters is what makes the movie so good, mystery story notwithstanding.  There are some pretty fast-paced moments which can be very exciting, and the ending is surprising, but if you think about it, makes plenty of sense.

The thing that makes the film flawed the most is what should be the foundation of the film:  the mystery.  Quaid's character is a juror of a trial, and out of nowhere, he becomes some busybody who starts looking for evidence himself, and partnering with the defense lawyer, Kathleen Riley.  It seems hard to believe that a juror would care so much that they take their own time to find evidence, and it's even harder to believe that a lawyer would willingly agree to the setup.  It's also very hard to follow the case, unless you're big onto mystery stories, which I usually am not.

In general, the film falters from trying to be a film for Cher fans and a film for mystery fans.  If you are one or the other, you will enjoy it, but you will not love it.",1136246400,3,1525,4.607407407407408
471667,4,6302479487,"Admittedly, SUSPECT asks the audience to suspend a lot of belief in its tale of a homeless man wrongly accused of murdering a young government clerical worker.  But director Peter Yates and the talented cast more than make up for the plot mechanisms and legal liberties taken, crafting a tense and involving thriller.  Cher plays the dedicated public defender who takes on the homeless man's case.  Liam Neeson in one of his early roles plays Carl, the deaf and dumb accused with a tight passion and volatile flair that makes him very sympathetic.  Dennis Quaid as the lobbyist who finds himself on the jury does well with his role, but it's hard to believe a juror would get so involved and risk not only a mistrial but possibly a disbarment for legal eagle Cher.  Quaid and Cher's rapport is so tight, though, we can forgive the writer for this implausible scenario.  John Mahoney is excellent as the stiff upper lipped judge who begins to suspect that Cher and Quaid may be working together.  Joe Mantegna as the prosecuting attorney brings a haughty, but commendable, self righteousness to his role.  There are some suspenseful moments and the movie is very enjoyable.  Cher is quite convincing as a lawyer and looks extremely lovely to boot!  Quaid's youthful energy works well for him, and he evinces the immense amount of talent that would come to serve him in his future roles.

When a brutal murder is commited against a Justice Department file clerk, and a homeless man who is deaf and cannot speak is accused of the crime, and Kathleen gets the case. Dennis Quaid plays dairy farm lobbyist Eddie, who is a juror who helps Kathleen with finding evidence. This part of the movie is a little hard to swallow, but the performances make up for it. It's terribly unlikely a juror would become romantically involved with a defense lawyer as well. However the movie was fine otherwise, and one of the last scenes where an unknown assailant chases Kathleen down the hallways of the court house, is quite suspenseful and thrilling. Cher is very believable in this part. Overall, a great flick to rent, very suspenseful and has a surprise twist at the end.",1064275200,33,844,4.7482993197278915
471671,4,6302479487,"This one will hopefully be restocked soon for Cher die-hards who'll find this suspenseful who-dun-it a worthy view. As Washington, D.C. public defender Kathleen Riley, Cher gets appointed by the court to defend a homeless deaf-mute (Lian Neeson, in one of his first substantial roles) accused in the brutal murder of a Justice Department file clerk. Setting out with a presumed guilt for her client, Ms. Riley comes to believe in her client's innocence and sets out to prove it. On the trial jury is dairy farm lobbyist Dennis Quaid who takes a judically improper and unethical active role in proving the defendant's innocence after he develops the hots for the defense counsel. Of course, the likelihood of a juror getting it on with the defense lawyer during trial is ludicrous and, in real life, would probably get both charged criminally and the lawyer disbarred. But the credible acting of the leads helps us to overlook that unlikely scenario and focus instead on who really done it. Anyone with any background knowledge of law, procedure and ethics might wonder about some of the judicial rulings handed down by the trial judge, but they figure significantly in the who and why of who really done it. Cher, by the time she made the film, was firmly established as a leading lady, and she demonstrates here that she can carry the responsibility. ""Suspect,"" despite its unlikely premise, is nonetheless a compelling view, and the solution (and, yes, the defendant is innocent) is a stunner!",1043971200,6,1495,4.936507936507937
471672,3,6302479487,"Scenario: Cher as a disheartened lawyer defends deaf and mute tramp Neeson in a murder case, using Quaid, a member of the jury, to lead a behind-closed-doors investigation to suggest that the murder may go further up than anyone expected.  So what you're in for is pretty much definitely going to be completely contrived, but not necessarily complete tripe.  This is in main part due to some very good performances from the three central characters.  Cher is surprisingly unglamorous and convincing as the tough cookie lawyer, whilst her sexual chemistry with Quaid is wholly believably.  Quaid himself enjoys himself immensely in a role of unflappable lobbyist, and Neeson shows surprising depth for a character that after all has no dialogue.  One scene in particular where he is outright accused of not only murder, but uselessness and an inability to adapt to normal society is one to which he reacts to in a not only believably outraged fashion but also in an equally believably emotional way.
With such good performances then it seems a shame that Suspect so often falls into clich, in particular in the `twist' at the end that reveals the real perpetrator of the crime.  Not only is it entirely unbelievably but it also seems tagged on the end, especially given the seemingly last minute decision to have Cher act as your typical scream queen (albeit wearing a suit and high heels) as we find her running down a corridor followed by an ominous shadowy figure whose face we don't get to see.  Even the detective work seems distinctly fishy, with Quaid having no problems walking through the slums in the middle of the night, nor Cher breaking into a car.  That said though, the chemistry between the leads does jumpstart things a fair few times, not least in the court scenes, where their sparring provides the best entertainment of the entire film.  Still, for a movie that starts off with a central topic of Neeson's murder case, it strays far too often away from the subject and into the `forbidden romance' territory.
Whilst Suspect isn't bad (certainly doing nothing to damage the actors' reputations), it's not on par with the far superior Jagged Edge, or the later Primal Fear.  Still, for basic solid entertainment, you could certainly do worse.",1042070400,8,2259,4.890052356020942

The needle on  the plausibility meter never got moved off the zero peg. It quivered a few times but each time the director attempted to bring this movie back into the real world, it crashed back to zero. Cher's performance is about as good as she can muster, which is very little. Liam Neeson didn't add much but then again, he plays a deaf & dumb character and couldn't add much.
The writing was horrible and painfully predictable.
