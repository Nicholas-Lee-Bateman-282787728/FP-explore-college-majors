8744845,5,B019DKQ0C4,"It Happened In Flatbush is a very fun and very entertaining baseball comedy from 1942. The beautiful Carole Landis stars as, a socialite who inherits a baseball team but knows nothing about sports. Lloyd Nolan, a washed up baseball player, returns to Brooklyn to manage the team. At first he clashes with Landis but eventually (of course ;-) he falls in love with her. Can they work together to save the team and win the big game? Miss Landis gives an excellent performance and gets to wear some really beautiful gowns. She was one of Fox's most promised starlets but sadly she took her own life in 1948. It Happened In Flatbush got very good reviews and was a modest hit when it came out in 1942. The talented cast also includes William Frawley, Scotty Beckett, and Sara Allgood. It was directed by Ray McCarey who also worked with Carole on 1941s Cadet Girl. If you're a fan of fun baseball movies or just want to see the lovely Carole Landis you'll enjoy this film.",1450915200,3,968,4.537142857142857
8744846,3,B019DKQ0C4,"It's a mild entertainer from Twentieth Century-Fox released in 1942 about a washed-up baseballer who becomes manager to a struggling Brooklyn baseball club. Seven years before, shortstop Frank ""Butterfingers"" Maguire (Lloyd Nolan) was booed out of the city for botching a play that cost Brooklyn the pennant. Except the team owner, old Mrs. McAvoy (Sara Allgood), hadn't quite forgotten him and his potential. Today, with the sorry team's manager having just quit, she tracks Maguire down and talks him into taking the gig.

But Brooklynites are a rabid bunch, and they haven't forgiven Maguire his immortal goof. Can our guy live down the stigma? Can he whip into shape a motley baseballing crew? There's dissension within the ranks. There's that one doubting newspaperman (Robert Armstrong) and his world-weary pessimism and his scathing columns. There are the baseball-indifferent heirs to the McAvoy fortune, specifically Manhattan society girl Kathryn Baker (Carole Landis) whom Maguire goes all out to convince to not sell the team. But ""that Baker dame"" is a tough nut to crack, and Maguire's silver tongue has to work overtime.

It Happened in Flatbush (a.k.a. ""Dem Lovely Bums"") can't have been as riveting a watch as the real-life, hard-luck Brooklyn Dodgers back in the day. But there's enjoyment here, especially for baseball buffs. This movie mostly plays for laughs and so it won't resonate as strongly as do other old-timey baseball pictures like, say, Pride of the Yankees (1942), The Stratton Story (1949), and The Winning Team (1953). Tonally, It Happened in Flatbush falls more in line with It Happens Every Spring (1949), Angels in the Outfield (1951), and The Kid from Left Field (1953), these four films being mighty generous with the yucks.

I'm more used to seeing Lloyd Nolan in unchuckly roles. I mostly know him for his private eye (Michael Shayne) stuff. So I had that neat frisson of watching an actor trying out something unfamiliar to him. Nolan does okay with the comic beats and, seems to me, shows off a passable Brooklyn accent. He certainly has that brash Brooklyn posturing down pat. He shines, too, in the few dramatic moments. No, it ain't all goofy antics going down in this movie. (By the way, the sequence in which an incensed fan rushes the field to clock the umpire? That really happened.) Nolan, assuming the fictitious counterpart to Leo Durocher, endures a ton of crap from not only the fans and the media but from his baseball players, as well. So, yeah, check this movie out if you get a chance. It's not bad, and Lloyd Nolan is good. He's got this easy chemistry with Carole Landis, who really is too beautiful and elegant for this sort of movie, but, by gosh, there's a warmth about her that just makes her character click.",1435881600,4,2774,4.93576017130621
