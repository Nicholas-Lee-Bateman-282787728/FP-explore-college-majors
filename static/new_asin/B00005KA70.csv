1617804,5,B00005KA70,"When I first encountered Ultraviolet I was afraid it was going to be another shoot-em-up vampire-killer flick, but was pleasantly surprised to see that the vampire premise was just an excuse to pump some blood into the dead genre of the Cold War drama. I couldn't help but notice parallels between UV and the great BBC Cold War epics like Jean LeCarre's 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' and 'Smiley's People' (ESPECIALLY the bridge scene at the end).
You probably will not like Ultraviolet if you are not a fan of sci-fi, horror or British programming.  Some viewers may find the episodes involving pedophilia and abortion to be in poor taste.
Interesting plot, great score, good (British) acting",998438400,5,694,4.982758620689655
1617805,5,B00005KA70,"This is an outstanding 6 part series. It does deal with vampires as is clearly apparent from the excellent opening credits but the entire concept has been updated to a fully scientific and modern basis on both sides of the conflict. Treatment of the story in this fashion as well as the quality of the acting talent attracted helped the audience to take a show about vampires seriously and attracted a large audience in the UK when it first screened as a result. It bares little resemblance to Buffy the Vampire Slayer (though more so to the main theme of Season 4 of BTVS, when the US government finally takes an interest in the increasingly bizarre things that go on in Sunnydale) but I enjoy both that show and this one for different reasons, don't compare the two as each has different merits. At the time of writing this review, this is supported by the fact that the people who buy these tapes are still buying the Buffy (also an excellent show but a different style of show) boxed video sets in the UK even a year or more after this set was released there.
 Episode 1: Habeus Corpus is the best episode.
 After an informant turns up dead and his partner Jack (Stephen Moyer) goes missing the night before his wedding, Michael (Jack Davenport) starts investigating his disappearance. This leads to the startling discovery that vampires exist and a secret government organisation is battling them in a shadow war that the public is (mercifully) unaware of. Unwittingly, he finds himself drawn into the conflict as both sides try to use him to gain an advantage over the other side. After an intriguing opening that draws you in, some thrilling action follows and a very explosive finish.
 Episode 2: In Nomine Patris
 This episode further demonstrates that the battle between the government and the undead is fully grounded in the present day as the team investigates a financial operation that has come to their attention quite by chance and leads to the discovery of some of the plans of their enemy to fight them, both financially and scientifically. Michael also has to deal with the persistent enquiries of his partner's fianc about his disappearance. She won't accept the explanation of the police, another theme that runs through the course of the series and fits well with Michael's personal conflicts over what he now knows about what is going on. Both sides are utilising the latest in available technology and not a crucifix in sight. A suitably explosive climax that even outdoes the one in the first episode.
 Episode 3: Sub Judice
 A solicitor is saved by an unseen assailant who murders both her attackers. Given the nature of the event and the complete lack of video evidence despite extensive security cameras, the squad is called in. Not a bad episode by any means, in fact it has what is probably the most dramatic and emotional scene in the entire series. The main problem is that it has nothing to do with the overall 'big picture' of the show, which is the ongoing battle between the two sides. In fact, you could actually skip from the end of episode 2 to the start of 5 and not even notice
 Episode 4: Mea Culpa
 A stabbing in a school ultimately leads to a discovery of a weapon being developed by the vampires to control the populace. Unfortunately, it takes most of the episode to get to this point and most of the episode is mired in investigating child abuse. The weakest in the series and even though a little more relevant that the previous episode on the ongoing theme, you could also miss it and not notice.
 Episode 5: Terra Incognita
 After episodes 3 and 4 lost some intensity and drifted off the main theme to varying degrees, the show is back to its brilliant best with this episode. After a man who has arrived from Brazil is found to have a mysterious bleeding disorder, it leads to the discovery of further experimentation and some mysterious containers in the plane's cargo. The best scene in the whole show has one of the team trapped in a warehouse and facing seemingly imminent death. For steadily mounting tension, drama and emotion, you cannot do much better than this episode.
 Episode 6: Persona Non Grata
 Revelations unfold about what the vampires' ultimate goals are. Things finally come to head as both sides converge on Michael, as he may be the key for both sides to achieve victory. Not surprisingly, he is under a lot of pressure from both sides due to his conflicting beliefs and loyalties that are unavoidably in direct opposition. The conclusion is very dramatic and answers a lot of the questions asked but still leaves things open for another series. Unfortunately, to date there has been no news about that so far, though a pilot for an American version of the show has been made with an airdate yet to be determined. With the airwaves currently cluttered with vaguely similar themes (though mostly involving the supernatural in some fashion), it probably means there may not be room for a full blown series of Ultraviolet in any form in the US at this time. As more time passes since this series first screened, a British follow up to this excellent UK series also seems less likely.
 Overall, this has been the best show on television for a long time. Using a measured approach and skillful writing so typical of the best British thrillers, they have taken a theme and made it something you will take just as seriously as any other police drama or thriller. The casting has been excellent, with the involvement of such well known veteran talents as Susannah Harker and the Australian actor Philip Quast, a good performance from Idris Elba as well as up and coming actor Jack Davenport.
 It is a show that you cannot afford to miss.",997660800,12,5701,4.688
1617806,5,B00005KA70,"Ultraviolet is a slick creepy thriller that ventures far from the vampire genre. Fangs, wooden stakes,garlic cloves,crucifixes are not the centerpiece of the weapons used against the ""leeches"", as one character calls them.{Though all are employed,ingeniously}. The vampires present themselves as a persecuted minority, trying to live in harmony, hunted by the church and its associates. The hunters are a hemotologist, a Gulf war veteran, a London Cop and a priest,all of whom have their reasons{which unfurl brillaintly}. Only the priest never loses sight of what is at stake, for the eternal life offered is rather seductive. The story is multilayered,with political, financial, enviornmental, racial and religious overtones. The ultimate question is are they looking for peaceful co-existence{by creating synthetic blood} or is there something more sinister. This series succeeds on so many levels. The four leads{Jack davenport,Susannah Harker, Idris Elba and Philip Quast} are absolutely on target,each inhabiting their character to the degree that by the 6th episode{two discs], you feel something for these folks. Much of the violence is implied, with very few of the blody scenes usually accompanying this genre. Channel 4 has lived up to its usual brillaint standards. This is cool,creepy and very ,very good. The title refers to a comment made by the priest to the cop early on. It sums up the series well. RExcellent, and damned good fun!!!!!!!",997315200,12,1455,5.442477876106195
1617807,5,B00005KA70,"First caught part of this on Scifi Channel; later got OK copies of the series from friend in the UK. Finally I can get complete, high quality copy of the whole six episode series. And it is one terrific series-- dark and moody, suspenseful and intelligent, driven by character and a sharp updating of the vampire mythos. If you like British styled drama (Touching Evil, for example) or X-files, you will love this series. I only wish more episodes had been done.",993945600,12,462,4.646341463414634
1617808,5,B00005KA70,"Not only has the treatment of vampirism been elevated to a kind of scientific plausibility, it has been done so in a style that is absolutely captivating.  I have watched this three times through (all five hours of it) and I will certainly watch it several times again.  There is so much complexity that every time I see it, I find whole new threads and subplots to interest me.
The writing is brilliant and the acting is so convincing that you find yourself taken into a world that you otherwise would not have accepted for a second.  Moreover, the depth of emotions evoked by this story will often catch you off-guard, and in several cases, put a lump in your throat.  If the understated scene with Susannah Harker vainly trying to pump life back into the rape victim doesn't deeply move you, nothing ever will.
This is story-telling at its very best!",992822400,10,853,4.592105263157895
1617809,5,B00005KA70,"I got an advance copy of Ultraviolet DVD and watched all 6 hours over the course of 2 nights. Right off the bat it was very obvious that Ultraviolet is a British production - rather than beating you over the head in the first 15 mins, they give you credit for having a brain and piece things together in a way that really draws you in. The film/series runs 6 hours and the writer/director Joe Ahearne really understands how to set a pace to keep you engaged while moving the story along.
Ultraviolet takes a wonderfully fresh and inventive approach towards vampires. I genuinely enjoyed the infusion of technology in relation to vampires -  If vampires don't have any reflection, how can they talk over a phone?  I also really liked the philosophical approach it took to the subject of vampires: Are vampires really bad? Should they be killed because they are who they are?
In the early years of the X-Files I was certainly a fan, but the show really lost me over the years, after watching Ultraviolet I realized why. Rather than hyping up some big conspiracy and never doing anything about it, Ultraviolet creates a complex world where everything isn't black and white but there are very specific 'rules'. Rather than myopically focusing on the world it creates Ultraviolet concentrates on really telling complete stories about the people in that world.
Ultraviolet was well acted, well directed and thoroughly enjoyable. I can't remember the last time I spent 6 hours watching something and was more than willing to see more. If Ultraviolet ever became a regular series I'd certainly be a faithful watcher!",992390400,39,1608,4.822463768115942
1617810,3,B00005KA70,"Episode one:
I thought they only took those who wanted to cross the line, so why is Jack Davenport so reluctant to get his neck bitten? He is miscast and mumbles all the way through this episode making a convoluted story even harder to follow, let alone swallow.
Episode two:
Eerie bit at the end ruined by a silly gas explosion. The music is great and sticks to you like glue. The ghost of Robert Vaughn stalks this 'government department' to risible effect. What, no Illya?
Episode three:
Couldn't follow the financial plot of the last one? Here Jack is joined by a whole bunch of mumbling people. The director is at fault here. Naturalism is just style if we can't hear the dialogue. Very plodding episode. A tree catches fire in a brief but doomed attempt to liven things up.
Episode Four:
Director Ahearne didn't want to do the usual cops and robbers, so why is the series so like 'Prime Suspect'? Taking the element of dread away from Vampires is counter-productive. Child abuse is tastlessly exploited yet again. More sci-fi mumbo jumbo. I've got a thing for Kirsty, though. How could the vampires resist her the whole series?
Episode Five:
This is what gets the three stars. A bona fide TV classic. The coffins. The old ticking bomb routine. The way the music builds up. Cracking performance from the guy who plays Vaughn (he stole the series from under Davenport). Great ending with cracked mirror. Corny stuff, but it works. But a long time coming. Why didn't the Guard disarm Vaughn when he clobbered him? If Vaughn had a gun, why was he worried? Anyway, he could have flipped the coffins on their back, or put one on top of the other, then he would have had only two to kill. A subtle 'love' scene with Harker (hired for her surname?) Is another highlight.
Episode six:
The juggling of naturalism with sci-fi tosh always threatened to collapse the series like a pack of cards and in the end it does. When the head honcho starts rambling on about nuclear winter and world domination you expect that Sgt Major from Monty Python to show up saying: ""Now, stop. This was a nice little show about vampires but now it's getting very silly."" Ahearne realises this with the line: ""What's this, visiting hours?"" The bit where a vamp tells Kirsty to get a life and jumps into the Thames could be directed at us for watching this twaddle. It was fun but I'm too old. Young people may love it and the money is probably worth it. Committed performances keep it afloat but ultimately series like this aren't green-lighted often because they are so hard to pull off.",991180800,5,2562,4.596069868995633
1617811,5,B00005KA70,"This movie is a very British take on the concept of vampires.  One of the first things you may notice is that it doesn't use the word ""vampire"" at all during this series, instead calling them ""Leaches"" when they use a name at all.  This movie also is possessed of a humanity and intelligence that is often lacking in other vampire sagas.  This movie will force you to think, so if you would prefer to sit back and passively enjoy a film, then this may not be right for you.  However, if you want to be engrossed in a soulful, intelligent, well-written, and well-acted drama, then please do yourself the great favour of purchasing this movie.  You'll be glad you did.",990662400,4,666,4.471074380165289
1617812,5,B00005KA70,"This excellent British mini-series has brought the vampire myth bang up to date.  We all know from the old movies we've seen that vampires don't cast a reflection in a mirror.... nowadays it's a little more complicated.  They can't use the phone without a voice synthesiser, and how do you track them running through a busy subway station when they don't show up on CCTV cameras?  Although they are called ""Leeches"" rather than vampires, we all know what we're talking about.  Leeches can be detected with ultraviolet light (hence the title), and modern weapons have been developed to fight them, including machine guns with ultraviolet sights firing carbon bullets and garlic gas grenades.  Policeman Michael Coleman is recruited into the secretive organisation formed to combat the leeches, but he's very much an outsider, and those around him all have their own hidden agendas.  He is about to be best man at his friends wedding when the friend disappears, and the next time Coleman sees him, he's been through a few changes..... I'm a big Buffy fan, but this series tackles the whole vampire-hunting scenario in a more adult and thoughtful way, and puts forward some interesting ideas about how vampires might have adapted to the modern world, and how we might combat them. The individual episodes are self-contained while still moving the arc of the whole story forward, and are guaranteed to have you on the edge of your seat.....this is some of the most gripping tv I have seen in a long time.  British viewers will recognise Jack Davenport (Coleman) from the BBC2 series ""This Life"", and Susannah Harker (Angela Marsh) from the excellent BBC adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Predjudice""",990230400,17,1700,4.985865724381625
1617833,3,B00005KA70,"A quick opening statement: if I could give 3.5 stars for this one, I would.

This show must have looked very, very strange to its original audience. As it is, this series still feels a bit alien and outlandish 15 years later (at the time of this review). ""Buffy"" fans might be jarred by this one because this show is deathly serious. In fact, never mind serious, it's approaching being noir.

There is little banter, there are precious few moments spent on idle witticisms, and its purpose isn't to cheer people up. While the characters are distinctly complicated, the show has a uniquely cold feeling (perhaps it's all an intricate metaphor or a mirror to the undead nature of vampires?). That being said, the writing actually has some very high points. It's not a ""bloodbath"" show. Yes, it has moments of ""yuck"" and cringing and general visual grimness (more so at the beginning), but it's hardly gore material; it's entirely too smart for that. This isn't campy. It's a workable drama that happens to have vampire/sci-fi tendencies. The characterizations are excellent and were planned very methodically, so there aren't really any moments in which the storyline becomes laughable because it goes too far (unlike many other shows).

Philip Quast is very noteworthy in this one, and the show simply wouldn't have worked without his character (or his face) in it. He rapidly becomes endearing and is a warmly welcome presence by the last episode, immediately a born leader and a father figure. His attention to detail becomes more and more layered with each successive episode, and it's really something to behold. The rest of the cast is generally enjoyable, but I think it's Quast who cements it all together.

So why do I give it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5? Personal tastes, nothing else. I'm not entrenched in horror shows and perhaps I would understand this show better if I had the stomach for other similar fare (I appreciate the high caliber of writing/scripting in this series, but can't see myself watching it multiple times in a month). Again, the show has a rather ""cold"" and sobering feeling that you will either like or you won't. It might just be the conspiracy elements generating some of this vibe (which is a shame because this show doesn't quite stand on its own feet without the conspiracy bits).

The big trick with ""Ultraviolet"" is that it doesn't wrap up neatly by the ending. The ending is acceptably viable (if not mildly cliched), but it feels like there was a second season (or a follow-up series?) partially in the works and was subsequently shelved. There's a hint of these 6 episodes being a bit ""out in the cold,"" as it were. What we might have here is a genuine case of a *miniseries* rather than a more traditional TV show format. It flows fine from one episode to the next, but the progression it makes in the course of one episode is startlingly dense (which is to say that film buffs averse to TV shows might love it and ""junk food"" TV show consumers will hate it and think the pacing is positively glacial).

It's not flashy - and it certainly looks dated now in some ways - but it's really not bad if you appreciate complex writing and even more complex characters.",1380585600,2,3203,4.690391459074733
1617834,5,B00005KA70,"Ultraviolet ran for six episodes at the tail end of 1998 and rapidly picked up enormous critical acclaim. Unfortunately, various factors combined to mean that a planned sequel series never went into production. The series was the brainchild of Joe Ahearne, who wrote and directed all the episodes (the exhaustion brought about by which, and C4's request he do the same for the second season, is apparently the key reason why it never happened). Ahearne had formally worked on the acclaimed BBC-2 series This Life and more recently has directed several episodes of the new Doctor Who.

Ultraviolet is a modern take on the vampire myth. As it was airing at the same time as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the writer clearly wanted to take a different approach (borrowing a fair bit from The X-Files as well). Ultraviolet is more realistic than Buffy, delving more into science of how vampires might work and showing in some cases greater fidelity to the myth (for example, vampires do not appear on camera as mirrors are part of the camera's focusing mechanism, whilst in Buffy they do) and taking it to new levels: these vampires cannot appear in any form of electronic recording, and cannot use phones either. Also, to avoid certain connotations of the word they never once use the term 'vampire' in the whole series, instead using the phrase 'Code 5' (which is rendered as 'Code V') or the nickname 'leech'. Ultraviolet does have a wry sense of humour, however, especially in the use of carbon bullets and ultraviolet-emitting detection gear (which replicates the effects of sunlight) to replicate more traditional vampire-killing weapons.

The story follows Detective Sergeant Michael Colefield of the London Metropolitan Police Force (played by Jack Davenport, better-known these days for his turn as Captain/Commodore Norrington in the Pirates of the Carribbean trilogy). When his best friend and fellow policeman vanishes without a trace on the eve of his wedding, Colefield discovers his friend was leading a shady double-life that was being investigated by a organisation that the government refuses to acknowledge exists. This organisation is soon, almost reluctantly, forced to recruit Colefield into their ranks once he uncovers evidence of the existence of the 'leeches'. He is integrated into a team led by Father Pearse Harman (the Catholic Church co-funds the war against the leeches alongside national governments; played by Philip Quast), Dr. Angela March (Susannah Harker) and Vaughn Rice (Idris Elba, best-known for his role as Stringer Bell in The Wire), but intriguingly he doesn't fully trust his new team-members and they remain wary of him until quite late in the series. This is mostly because Colefield has a hopeless crush on his friend's jilted fiancee, Kirsty and continues to have contact with her, which the rest of the team suspects is a weakness the leeches will employ against him. However, when it is discovered that Harman has cancer, the leeches also find that they have a temptation they can use against him...

Even though there was supposed to be a sequel, as a mini-series Ultraviolet works extremely well, with events starting at one point and coming full circle as the series proceeds. The notion of science versus faith is explored intelligently in the series: crucifixes and other symbols of faith are treated as placebos and only have an impact on those vampires who themselves are superstitious. The vampires themselves employ technology for their own ends, able to drive around with with use of UV-resistant glass and use vocoders to make phone calls, whilst the longer-lived specimens are able to manipulate the stock market over decades to make immense fortunes. The central theme of the series is also compelling: the vampires and those opposed to them have endured an uneasy truce over the centuries because the vampires want to protect their food supply and enjoy being the elite; they have no wish to turn the whole human race into vampires, for example. The truce is now over because humanity is getting perilously close to the point where it will destroy itself, and the vampires need to save us from ourselves...but whilst this may sound great the suggestion is that their preferred mode of existence for 'normals' is in immense battery farms. At the same time, the world governments are scared of going public for fear of causing a panic and the creation of a state of intolerance, surveillence and fear. As one character says, they walk the line between living on a Bernard Matthews farm or in Iran-writ-large. These themes, even more timely now than when the show was first transmitted, are explored intelligently and in-depth.

This is a great series and no mistake, well-written, excellently acted (Davenport's finest hour by far; Quast is just fantastic as the multi-layered Harman) with moments of moral doubt, character drama and occasional moments of bad-ass action (Vaughn gets two of the most spectacular vampire kills in screen history), whilst the revelation of the vampire's final plan for humanity in the last episode is spine-chilling.

Criticisms? Frankly, no, not really. When the episode aired with the paedophile case I was a bit bemused and pondered if the show was just trying to be 'edgy' for the sake of it. However, it ended with an absolutely monumental and somewhat disturbing twist that was just brilliant and exceedingly logical given the parameters of the show. Of course, the biggest criticism is that we never got a second season, but that may be for the best. The conclusion to the series would seem to make any further continuation of the story a bit too black-and-white, whilst it's the moral ambiguity of the two sides that makes Ultraviolet so interesting.

Ultraviolet (*****) is absolutely recommended as being probably the finest exploration and use of the vampire in modern fiction I have come across.",1366243200,,5893,5.076367389060888
1617835,5,B00005KA70,"This was the first TV series I ever bought on DVD as I so loved it when it was shown on TV. Ultraviolet is a miniseries which follows the well meaning English cop Michael. Right before Michael's best friend and partner, Jack is to marry his long time friend Krisy he disappears. Michael suspect that Jack's disappearance is not due to cold feet over the wedding, a suspicion which is strengthened when a strange group of people start poking around. This group turns out to be a surviving branch of the inquisition who dedicate itself to hunting vampires. reluctantly Michael agree to work with the vampire hunters to find out about the sinister plot which claimed Jack and which threaten all of humanity.

Ultraviolet plays a little like X-Files, this group of vampire hunters are a government agency, they are formal and professional. At the same time the series deals well with emotional issues, all from the grief of having to kill a family member who is now a vampire to how to deal with serious illness. Ultraviolet have six episodes and there is an overarching plot which spends the entire series. One thing I can complain about is that while the story is generally very good the ending is a bit rushed, I think that had the series been eight instead of six episodes it would have been even better. That being said the storylines in Ultraviolet is solid and I have personally seen this series several times and I never seam to tire of it.

The vampires in Ultraviolet is done in an interesting way, they are both very traditional but are made new and fresh by a very scientific focus. Perhaps the most striking quality of the Ultraviolet vampires is that they are immortal, completely and utterly. Yes when they are for example staked they turn to dust (and not in the Buffy way, they explode, violently, one of the characters actually use a vampire death to blast his way out of a locked room in one scene.) however that dust can be reanimated so not only do the hunters need to kill the vampires, they need to keep their ashes safe as well.

The actors of Ultraviolet do a very good job and the characters they portray is multi faceted and interesting. The visuals are striking and considering that the series was made in 1998 the special effects are nice. The music of Ultraviolet is both fitting and fetching, all in all Ultraviolet scores high all over when it comes to it's technical quality.

I warmly recommend Ultraviolet, if you like vampire stories, horror stories or just mystery and crime stories then this is a good choice. The series is well written, dark and different. The series should have been a few episodes longer but other than that I have no complaints and all I can say is that Ultraviolet is a very, very good TV series.",1324944000,,2752,4.59877800407332

1617841,5,B00005KA70,"Brit drama rocks:  get this one for your permanent collection.  The reviewer who called this British show ""smart, stylish and gripping"" was bang on -- I loved Ultraviolet when I saw it a decade ago on cable in the U.S. and have been looking for a recording of it ever since (but now it's on DVD -- hooray!).  Contrary to popular remembrance, Ultraviolet was NOT a regular TV series -- it was an excellent six-part mini-series.  As in many Brit dramas, most of the characters are between a rock and a hard place; the story is certainly grim, yet the characters struggle not just to do the right thing, but also with what exactly the right thing might be, which isn't always clear.  And the threat of infection, accidental or intentional, is real for those on the front line.  The best thing besides the wonderful casting, writing and acting is the combination of modern vampire tales with a scientific/detective bent.  Susannah Harker is a no-nonsense, intriguing, if endangered, scientist fighting the clock to analyze the infection and grope for a cure or vaccine against it.  Jack Davenport is a weary, serious, disillusioned cop who partners with her to attempt to forestall disaster.  Very, very credible storyline.

Ultraviolet was on at about the same time as Forever Knight, the original vamp-as-detective show, which had in its last-season episodes a story arc about vampires succumbing to a new, unidentified plague -- and only drinking the blood of an AIDS victim cures them (but of course, only nasty Lacroix figures it out and saves his lonesome self).  Again, the twist of vampirism as a kind of infection in itself, one that can be researched, investigated and potentially identified but that is also prey to other competing, mutating viruses/bacteria, is fascinating.  Even vampires, it seems, aren't at the top of the food chain: microbes are -- viruses, bacteria, prions, what have you.  Scary stuff!!

The only thing I've seen since Ultraviolet that was as compelling, mind-bending and frightening was Torchwood's season 3 mini-series, Children of Earth.  And both were SO well done.  I highly recommend Ultraviolet as the thinking person's vampire tale.  It'll keep you on the edge of your seat.  BTW, one has to wonder whether the writer(s) of the awful 2006 comic-book-film with Milla Jovovich stole not just the name but also the idea of vampirism as infection from this Brit show.

1617842,5,B00005KA70,"I just finished this series, and like many first-time watchers, I'm sure, was left wishing Ultraviolet had run for far longer than six episodes.

This is excellent stuff: intelligent writing; wonderfully developed, imperfect characters; a well-executed, high-concept premise; sharp, twisty plot lines touching on contentious issues; fine cinematography and a moody score; all brought together by strong acting.  I read recently that Joe Ahearn, the producer/director/writer didn't go beyond season 1 because he did virtually everything on the first 6 episodes, and it basically consumed his life.  That dedication and singleness of purpose shows throughout Ultraviolet, which is beautifully realized and highly recommended.",1261180800,,723,6.0
1617863,5,B00005KA70,"I first watched ULTRAVIOLET about 2 years ago expecting something completely different from what I saw (X-Files maybe?). Being a horror maniac, I found UV tepid and drawn-out. I soon forgot about it. In the meantime, I got addicted to british cop shows (Prime Suspect, Frost, Rebus, etc.), and returned to UV last week. Well, I actually paid attention this time and watched, amazed at what I seem to have missed the first time around! Watching all of those dark police procedurals certainly helped, especially in mood and atmosphere. ULTRAVIOLET is a smart, bleak series about two warring factions (humans and leeches) trying to gain species supremacy. Filled w/ social commentary, UV twists the vampire story into a tale of survival and desperation. The characters are intelligent and strong, the pacing is perfect, and the storyline never falters. Jack Davenport (Pirates Of The Carribean 1-3) is quite believable as Michael, the latest recruit in the war. Susannah Harker (is that a great name or what?!) is fantastic in a Scully sort of way. Idris Elba plays his tough, ex-military role with a stern ease. The leeches (or Code Vs) themselves are mostly unseen, adding to the mystery and tension. This isn't a hollywood production. There are only a few explosions, absolutely no karate-vampire fights, and not one black leather  outfit. Nope, this one requires a bit more than just a heartbeat from its audience. With only six episodes, my only complaint was that no more were ever made. Super stuff!...",1257724800,,1506,5.024
1617864,4,B00005KA70,"ULTRAVIOLET is a very cool, very well done British cop show where the cops are an elite squad of government agents working under the radar and above the law, and the criminals are vampires.

This is no teenage vampire romance story.  These vampires are not sleek or hip or objects of desire at all.  They are secretive, incredibly well-funded and intimately involved in medical science and they supposedly ""only take those who want to cross over.""  Although the doctor/detective begs to differ.  These vampires or leeches as they are called, operate on a very sophisticated level; they are heavily invested in medical research to further their ""evolution"" and to conquer all blood diseases that currently infect their blood supply such as AIDS, leukemia and sickle cell anemia.  Still, they're vulnerable to the same spiritual and natural weapons of the vampire such as sunlight, the Holy Bible (they haven't evolved beyond the power of God yet) and a shaft through the heart.  But they aren't sensationalized like the typical American teen heart throb vampire.

The British are very cool and dead serious in their portrayal of the war between vampire and man.  This show will appeal to lovers of forensic science (like CSI), detective shows and of course fans of the vampire genre will want to give this one a look, too.  There are only 6 episodes, and the character development of the main four characters is nuanced intentionally to add to the mystery.  I can't wait to see the Big Reveal of the final episode.

I highly recommend ULTRAVIOLET.",1248480000,2,1546,4.926640926640927

1617884,4,B00005KA70,"Interested in a thoughtful, sophisticated horror/suspense tale? This six-part mini-series will not dissapoint even the most hardcore genre fan.

First of all, don't read anything more about the plot. It's a good tale that works best with no knowledge at all of what it is about or what is going on. There are many terrific surprises and each carefully plotted episode builds upon the other and concludes in a satisfying end. Each episode has a slow, stately pace that adds to the spiderweb of intrique. There are more than a few unsettling ideas in here that are testament to a crafty writer.

There are a couple of flaws. For one, the actors are so serious and grave that they seem bland compared to the USA's wisecracking, action heroes. There's little chemistry between the detectives, not because they are poor actors or the dialogue is weak, but because they are acting serious. Our heroes have had their personal lives sucked dry by the vamps -- they have no life or passions beyond hunting them. But it's a different take from most detective shows that take the easy approach and therefore fill the show with sarcastic buddy movie banter that doesn't fit the overall tone of the show. Some may take this Brit approach as boring. I prefer the term ""realistic"" and applaud the decision. However, I must admit that I only liked the characters the second time I saw the series and had time to look deeper at them. The first time I even had several of the characters confused, since they aren't as distinct as cliched characters from other series.

Also, some complain that it is only 6 episodes. However, each episode has so many ideas and dialogue that they individually feel more like movies (so they feel long). Also, the end is throughly done, plotted and concludes the whole series nicely. After it is over, it feels like a full meal compared to other TV series that feel cotton-candy like. Yes, I wish for a sequel. But it ends nicely and doesn't require one.

The lack of DVD extras is infuriating, especially considering that you want to know more about the inventive minds who came up with such a devious plot.

When you do see it, you'll see why BBC shows are often a class above their Yankee cousins. While inspired by the ""X-Files"", it expands upon it with a dour, somber mood and populates the cast with nuanced and divided characters. Better yet, the dialogue and unsettling moral dilemnas really make it a standout in the entire genre. I'm a huge ""Buffy"" fan and appreciate Whedon's postmodern winking, action-packed update of the genre. This is a different twist: grim, political, and psychological. It's well worth the buy.

FYI -- Don't judge this by the cover. The box cover seems like an ""X-Files"" knockoff, when this is not the case. The characters are very unlike Mulder of Scully.",1167609600,10,2806,4.7280163599182

It is obvious that the writers have given the issues some thought and the motivations of the ""vampires"" are more intelligently thought out. Perhaps it is a pity that we don't get to learn more about the hierarchy and organisation of the vampires other than some hints. This is strongly suggested by their organised and coordinated efforts, and willingness to act on their own initiative to pursue common goals.

In other words, these were intelligent vampires who are able to transcend their individual needs for their greater good. Which is an interesting idea but which raises my skepticism. Like I said, maybe it would have helped if there were more explanation, but as the story is told from the perspective of the humans, there is no premise for that to happen within 6 episodes.

As for the execution of the story, I thought the acting was not very credible. I didn't get the sense that there was any chemistry at all between the actors. Bland.",1160438400,5,1082,4.714285714285714

1617891,5,B00005KA70,"Ultaviolet was one of those rare TV wonders that seems to have it all: intelligent writting, good acting, great editing, and a good soundtrack. However, as a rule of thumb, it was too good to last in the UK. An X-Files-look-alike about Vampires where the word Vampire is never mentioned and yet you never miss it?... that's GREAT writting, because the story is so compelling, and the characters so richly developed (in many ways, they had more development in one season than Mulder and Scully in years) that you end every episode with a provocative thought or question that leads you promptly to the next chapter. However, the series was not supported by the network (no suprises there) and got cancelled. The final chapter, well... it's bittersweet at best, because leaves you with many questions. But then again, that's what good television does, after all.

The DVD's are bare-bones-basic. But the image and sound quality is as good as it gets. My advise here would be: buy it and watch it slowly. Digest the show. Replay scenes and see every episode several times so you get the subtle layers in the plot. I'm sure that you'll enjoy it, and will leave you asking for more.",1146355200,3,1176,4.736585365853658

I mean, with a tv show this great, you'd think the responce would have the studio screaming for a second and third season.  I can understand the director/writer not wanting to do a second season in GB, but ... Hey people, step up, hand the ball off to someone who can run with it. If you can't find one locally, bring one over from one of your colonies (the one located to our North would be a good choise).

This was VERY well done for a Brit show.  I mean, the last horror story that had any teeth in it was the ""28 days"" thingy. (And, hey, I kept thinking THAT had something to do with the mense's all the way to the end.  Shoulda picked a different number.)

Story-line is better than fine; its Gr-rr-rate.  The Music is fine.  FX is fine.  Unknown actors that can really act fine.  Directed fine.  In fact, everything was fine enough for it to have gotten a Globe if it were done in U.S.  I read of rummors of it being picked up to be done for the U.S. market - Fox, I think.  Then I catch the name being used for some SCIFI ""Kill Bill"" knock off. Go figure.

Anyway, the DVD stands on its own; every episode up to high standards to keep you wanting to see the next one, even with an excellent to superior plot twist at the end.  It's just such a good plot line, its disappointing it didn't have a least 2 more seasons, that's all.  I mean, it's kinda like listening half-way through an Alan Parsons album.

Would I recommend getting this DVD?  Absolutly.  Am I still pissed about them not doing another season?  Yeah, but that's tempered a little after watching the DVD a few times.

My wife is from Ireland, and while we were over there getting married in 2002, I first saw this series.  It was aired in its entirety and my father-in-law and I shared mass quantities of Guiness and Jameson Whisky while enjoying this program.

The premise is rather simple. Vampires (referred to primarily as ""leeches"" in the series) exist and have existed, governments have countered this threat with secret agencies designed to fight it. These agencies only recruit people that may have already been affected by the leeches. The series primarily follows one man, as he is brought into that world because of a friend.

It is an original way of dealing with the vampire fiction. Over several episodes, you rarely see the vampires, and mainly deal with the fallout from their actions. You almost never see the same vampire in multiple episodes.

Throughout the mini-series clues are dropped, and the mystery is not resolved until the final part of the final episode. Still, even at the conclusion, there remains a conflict. I was hoping to see a continuation.",1124409600,3,938,5.038709677419355

1617902,3,B00005KA70,"I'd been hearing people rave about this series for ages, so when it became available on DVD, I snapped it up. I can see what drew some of the rave reactions, but the series did leave me rather unsatisfied.  The basic premise of the series, the central pin of the mystery of the Code V (as the vampires are called) depended on... a gimmick.  A never-explained gimmick, which made a gaping flaw in a series that was taking a more scientific approach to vampires.

(This is a very common stumbling block in stories where the creator wants to steer away from the mysticism of the vampire legends.  To date, IMO, no-one's really succeeded at that.)

The good:

The score.  Moody, bluesy, and never overpowers the action on-screen.

The actors:  the central cast (with one exception) all had good chemistry together, and it was a treat to see a show where the 'buddy element' wasn't hammered into the viewer's head.  These aren't 'best buds.'  They're not drones or fanatics.  They're people who've been through terrible things, pitting their intelligence and skills against an enemy who's way ahead of them.

The plots: Hoo, boy.  Ultraviolet tackles some pretty controversial topics.  Great change from the usual fare.

The bad:

There isn't much in the way of resolution.  So much is left hanging.

The gimmick:  These vampires can't be seen by machines--no recordings, photos, etc.  Vampirism is a type of virus.  Yet it's never explained just how a virus manages to make one's clothes invisible to machines, or voices unable to be captured on audio equipment.  Or why the 'active ingredient in garlic' has an unspecified effect, or why one needs special ammo to shoot one.

In short, the 'new' mode of vampire looks surface-cool, but it doesn't hold up under a closer look.  If you can set that aside, you'll enjoy UV.  There's almost nothing in the way of extras on the two-disc set, so if you can't suspend disbelief, don't shell out for what will become very expensive drink coasters.",1115078400,11,1986,4.8017751479289945
1617938,5,B00005KA70,"Every now and then a book or a show about vampires comes along and cuts with a sharp knife through the grotesque mass of cliches the vampire industry's mythos has become.  We are treated, finally, to a phantasmagoria that does not insult our intelligence but makes harsh demands on our perceptive capacities and our capacity for sensitivity and sophistication.  It rewards us, in turn, with something that stirs up the unsettled debris at the bottom of our souls and ignites our cognitive powers at white hot intensity.
""Ultraviolet"" is not for children and it is doubly not for children masquerading as adults.  It plays games with the mind that remind me of the superior gamesmanship of Patrick McGoohan's sublime series ""The Prisoner"".  A covert agency working in the British government and allied with forces in the Catholic Church is dedicated to hunting down and destroying vampires but the strange plots it uncovers show that the vampires are not mere street thugs or the charismatic pseudo-erotic devil-deities we behold in so much fiction or film today.  The vampires are Up To Something and the brief glimpses we get of that Something convey a preternatural chill that will disturb both our hearts and minds.
Gone are the raving lunatics and dope-fiend-like cariactures we've come to expect.  The vampires, when we encounter them, are truly bearers of something uncanny and alien, worthy of the best forays into the diabolic sublime in high european art.  They are handled with a marvellous degree of understatement that quietly emphasizes their non-human nature.  We are left doubting, through most of the series, who the real bad guys are.  Is the humanity the vampires seek to convey real or is a mask over something so non-human that cosmic dread can be the only response?
""Ultraviolet"" is a profoundly mature and maturing work of art.  There are two sides to every story and Joe Ahearne, the creator and director, manages to find at least three until all sides resolve in a terrifying climax where all the philosophical and psychological reveries in the series are crowned with existential thunder.
Good and evil are fierecely opposed in this work but we must pass through a thousand ambiguities and confusions until we come to the end.
A great and stimulating work of art.  But sunglasses are not included. You'll have to bring your own.  If you so choose.",1114214400,10,2372,4.962121212121212

This is a really intelligent treatment of the vampire myth -- very philosophical (well, in the background -- NOT BORING!)

I find the most fascinating question it asks is:  if the Code Vs (code fives) only ""convert"" people who are willing (and don't kill when they feed), what does that do to the whole ethical dilemma of wiping them out?

(OK, the less fascinating question that isn't addressed  is: Fine, they don't reflect in mirrors or on video or photographs --but why don't their clothes?  But forget that for the purposes of making it a really neat crime show.)

This is very well written; well acted; exciting and a thought-provoking premise -- and it doesn't surprise me at all that Fox-TV couldn't replicate it (I speak as a Firefly fan.)",1103328000,6,776,4.576642335766423
1617942,5,B00005KA70,"For fellow Yanks who haven't been enamored of British imports because they're strange or cheaply produced--try this one. Pound sterling was spent on this production, and it shows. The plot employs a clinical, realistic approach to vampires (so, goth-fans might be disappointed) in which a London police inspector finds himself drawn into a mysterious agency with a mysterious mandate. The show is moody in tone, with strong characterizations, crisp and pleasing visuals, and a sublimely beautiful soundtrack. This was a real surprise for me, and I have a Britisher named James (who mostly enjoys American dramas) to thank for directing me to it.",1103068800,6,645,5.271844660194175
1617943,5,B00005KA70,"For those who have not seen this movie, it is well worth the buy.  Set in modern day London, a cop's partner is ""turned"" on the eve of his wedding.  As he investigates his partner's failure to show and disappearance, he learns that vampires (or ""leeches"" as they are usually called -- the word vampire is never used) are real.  He is then co-opted into a special government branch -- run by an ex Priest, a medical scientist, and a special forces operative -- that is hunting the vampires.

Are the vampires evil?  Does religion really have anything to with them?  Is the cross's effect on vampires merely psychosomatic or is there real power there? Is the special branch just a modern day version of the inquisition, oppressing the innocent?

It is to the show's credit that you do not really know the answers to all of these questions until the last episode, though clues are sprinkled about throughout.

This is the best vampire story I've ever encountered (book, movie, or series).  Although shown occasionally on the Sci Fi channel, owning the DVD is well worth the price to see it for the first time.

For those who have seen the series on t.v., the DVD is still worthwhile.  Though there is not much in the way of extras, the DVD version seemed much easier to understand (and not just because I had seen it before).  The sound quality is very good.  On the t.v. version the conversation was sometimes hard to follow because of the English accents.  Not so with the DVD.  Being able to follow the conversations more closely added a lot to my viewing pleasure.

1617945,5,B00005KA70,"Let's face it -- the Brits know how to do a few things better than us Yanks: drink tea, print tabloids and produce compelling TV shows come to mind.  ""Ultraviolet"" falls into the last category, and for those of you who don't mind blending genres, this show is well worth the price of admission.
""Ultraviolet"" is part mystery, part sci-fi thriller and part horror show mixed into one story spread over six episodes.  The main character, Michael (played by Jack Davenport, also of ""Coupling"" fame), is a London police detective leading a fairly normal life in the beginning of the Episode One.  When his partner Jack disappears on the night before Jack's wedding, however, Michael investigates and quickly becomes possessed of a knowledge that few others have: the world is infested by a small but active vampire colony.  Interestingly, the word ""vampire"" is never used in the series; ""leech"" is apparently the preferred term.  However, these leeches suck blood from their victims' necks, have superhuman strength, cannot be recorded by any modern technology, can be killed by exposure to sunlight, and will live forever if not destroyed.  In other words, if it quacks like a duck... While continuing his investigation into Jack's disappearance, Michael is reluctantly recruited into a special police/paramilitary unit whose sole function is to neutralize the leeches and keep humanity safe from enslavement and/or extermination.
I'm not going to provide an episode guide; other reviewers below have done that.  Instead, I'm going to tell you why you should watch this show.  First,  Writer/Director Joe Ahearne does a masterful job of buliding suspense.  The action is seen through Michael's eyes for the most part, and Ahearne uses the classic ""less is more"" style to make this show really creepy.  For example, you hardly ever see the leeches; instead, you see the effects on the people with whom the leeches have had contact.  It creates a very tense atmosphere of ""they're out there somewhere, we just don't know where.""  (See the movie ""Alien"" if you don't know what I'm talking about.)  Further, Michael's new colleagues are almost as threatening as the leeches. It is several episodes before Michael learns much about them and even then they are so maniacal about doing their job, you never quite get to a spot where you completely trust them.  The viewer knows, as does Michael, that Michael would be shot down immediately if he ever ever becomes a leech, bonds of loyalty or friendship (such as they are) notwithstanding.
Second, the cinematography is excellent.  Much like early seasons of the ""X-Files"", most of the scenes in ""Ultraviolet"" are shot either in very low light or at night, setting a dark mood for the whole series.  I won't ruin it for you, but there is a scene in Episode Five (Terra Incognita) involving one of Michael's colleagues being trapped inside a warehouse with several leech coffins that are time-coded to open right at sundown.  Michael and the cavalry are ten minutes away; the coffins are set to open in four minutes.  The sun sets in the blood red sky as this seconds tick off and.... well, as another reviewer says, this might be the best scene in the whole series.
Third, and although there is plenty of action, the characters develop more through good dialogue than through good marksmanship.  It's really hard to find a show that is as well written as this one, where what the characters say has real meaning to the story, as opposed to just being filler material until the next chase scene.  It is so well done, in fact, that you will be sorely disappointed when the end of Episode Six rolls around because you really want to know what happens next to all of these people.  You feel cheated, like there should be more.  And that, my friends, is the mark of a good TV show.
So go ahead and hit that 1-click ordering button; you'll be glad you did.",1086048000,9,3890,4.842900302114804
1617946,5,B00005KA70,"This British show does what nothing else seems to have accomplished:  it built a supernatural thriller/melodrama that honors both its horror and intrigue elements and origins.  The writing is top-notch, the performances first-rate and the cinematography is very, very solid.  Though only six episodes, this show left me breathless the first time I saw it, and I've yet to get a bad review when screening it for horror-loving friends.  This is highly, HIGHLY recommended for fans of horror, intrigue, melodrama and anyone who thinks that horror shows are unavoidably lame.",1084147200,5,571,5.311111111111111
1617947,5,B00005KA70,"This is the BBC being very, very cool. And nobody does cool like they do. The whole series is deliciously ambiguous. There's no answer about weather vampires here are good or bad, weather they change and see people as nothing but food or remain mostly human, with human intrests. Is everything they do deliberate and designed to decieve, or do they feel? Everything they do can have two meanings; one human and one completely alien. This lack of answer creates a tension and an alienness in this series that drives it, makes it amazing. I loved it. Plus I liked the whole nifty toys and ideas. But I won't spoil it, you'll have to be surprised adn delighted for yourself.",1078012800,2,671,4.6
1617974,5,B00005KA70,"One of the most fun viewing experiences I've had in recent days is watching one episode of this series each night over the period of a week. The idea of likening vampires to multiple minorities is brilliant - the gay, the HIV+, the ill, the deaf, the disabled - because it keeps the protagonists morally ambiguous. Is what they're doing right? That's for you to decide. The whole thing is terribly scary, more so because it's rationalised by science. My biggest complaint is that the bloody thing ends just as it's getting more interesting than ever before!
The characters are mostly well-drawn, headed by Jack Davenport (""Coupling,"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean"") although I found the female characters rather lacking. Susannah Harker's character is every bitchy, cold scientist with a past that I've ever seen (and I've seen a fair few). I think it's quite a mistake to have put her on the front cover as a sort of Scully to Jack Davenport's Mulder; they're barely seen together in the show! My personal favorite character was Philip Quast's fallen, tortured priest, the leader of the team. I ultimately wanted to know a lot more about him than the others.
Of course, ""Ultraviolet"" isn't perfect - a few plot revelations are completely telegraphed, and the show changes its stance on some of the finer details of the vampire legend more than once - but it's still very good. In fact, I don't understand at all why they could only make six episodes out of it. Unlike most miniseries, there's easily enough unanswered questions to make a full British season of 13 episodes, or maybe even two.
The DVD's quite good quality - the video looks quite crisp to me and the occasional bright colors (especially the blue of the labs) are very clear. I was also quite pleased by the 5.1 mix (which I believe the R2 release does not have?) - not usually the sort of thing I notice, but for a British series, the music is astonishingly full and pleasant. In fact, it sometimes overpowers the dialogue, especially in episodes one and two - and made me distinctly wish for a subtitle track. The text extras are a bit lacking (and hard to find - they're accessed via the ""V"" chapter selection of each episode, and then the ""Code V Area"" button), but the two-part audio interview with writer/director Joe Ahearne is very good. Quite a nice little set of an astonishingly good show.",1076889600,6,2362,4.707729468599034

Suffice it to say it is an wonderful piece of work. The central idea, of people having to do things they find appalling in order to save the world is not often explored these days. These people are wounded or worse, cut off from humanity, and yet they press on. Excellently written and acted, it doesn't get bogged down in how wonderful vampires are (thank you Ms. Rice), but rather deals with the real human issues of fighting a *possibly* inhuman enemy.

The microscope, lab, and morgue (where the Code ""V's"" are held after they are destroyed) all provide a new interest to an old story.

1617979,5,B00005KA70,"The other reviews pretty much say enough about this great British series. The only unfortunate thing is the fact that 6 episodes leaves you still hungry for more. This series is different from most vampire flicks because it relies on the characters and the plot heavily. The viewer gradually learns about each character and their pasts. The story starts ""open"" and ends ""open"", and you feel like you were fed only a fraction of the story's potential: that's what makes it so REAL. Despite the lack of heavy special effects, the acting is great (particularly the main 4 crusaders) and the story is gripping, interesting and solid, each story with its own twist and its own controversy. I couldn't stop watching. Do not, however, expect too much (a few isolated moments) of the usual ""fangs and blood"" combo. This is closer to a british ""X-Files"", with style, wit and lots of character. As a matter of fact, I don't even recall hearing the word ""vampire"" mentioned by any of the main characters.

As I watched this DVD, I really found myself, intrigued by the vampires and wanted to know more about them. They seemed much more intelligent than your average...""Run at the good guy, fists waving in the air..."" type villians. In fact, in one episode, a vampire actually shows compassion, in others, a vampire was show to donate millions of dollars to charities... To protect their food-supply, of course.

The mini-series format definitely seems the best way for this type of story to be done although it is disappointing that there have been no further mini-series.  The series does a great job of building tension and presenting moral dillemas for the main characters.  The lines between good and evil are blurred pretty well until the ending, in which the traditional vampire-bad human-good roles are re-established, but the premise that no-one is really immune from being turned is an interesting one.

This British ""miniseries"" (6 episodes) gives an updated twist to the old Vampire myths.  For example, if a vampire can't be seen in a mirror, it stands to reason that he can't be seen on videotape.  Hmmmm....  Provides a surveillance challenge!!  Very inventive twists make Ultraviolet fascinating to watch!
However, it's not just the unique updating of the myth that makes this series a good watch.  The story development is excellent, and the characters are very well played.  Probably most familiar to US audiences will be Susannah Harker in a very different role from her portrayal of Jane in the BBC/A&E production of ""Pride and Prejudice"".  She is excellent as the doctor in the group, focusing on the medical aspects of the vampire challenge.
Very different in style from the US shows ""Kindred: The Embraced"" (available on DVD) and ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"", Ultraviolet is more focused on the psychological than blood and guts.  ""Kindred"" and ""Buffy"" are action fare, ""Ultraviolet"" is psychological fare.

Further, I dislike horror fiction and Ann Rice's take on vampires.  With all that said, you might wonder why I liked this.  The answer is simple: A great story.
I like the concept of a vampire underground, organized and thoughtful, a sinister threat, not just a blood thirsty killing machine.  The characters are brilliant and the tension between them is spectacular.  The plots incorporate interesting ideas, updated for the modern era:  Vampires cannot be seen in mirrors, so today that also means, they can't be seen on cameras.  The greatest little suggestion in the series is that vampires often seek people in their 30's to convince to join them.  Why?  Because they realize their youth is slipping away and don't want to get older.  Brilliant.  (With that said, all the vampires now must be baby boomers.)

Finally, for Xmas, I gave in, and let me tell you I was more than pleasantly surprised.  I was blown away.  ULTRAVIOLET is a six-episode miniseries (hint: it's left open enough for a follow-up, should the creative folk wish to do so) that did something very few miniseries do: it makes you think.  I don't care what the others have written, but I do want to point out my fundamentals: (a) Episode 1 is the rudimentary, just-a-bit-formulaic set-up for what's to follow; (b) Episode 2, 3, and 4 introduce some of the more interesting elements that, honestly, force the viewer to keep up with ideas; (c) Episode 5 is, without a doubt, one of the finest hours of TV I've ever seen produced; and (d) Episode 6 is a commendable finish to a job well done.

I won't waste time summing up the entire storyline -- you can read that elsewhere. But what I will tell you is that the things that stood out to me are two-fold. One, this is the first vampire story I've seen where the vampires don't spend the whole show trying to kick people's butts. No offense, Buffy, but it's nice to see vampires in something other than leather jackets... The ""leeches"" are crafty, manipulative, and even political in nature. Just like real people. The second great thing about this is that the special effects don't try to hit you over the head. The first thing I noticed was that the effects are just perfect. When a vampire gets staked or carbon-bullet riddled, he doesn't have some ridiculous fake-looking transformation. They pulled off what they could with the budget they had and didn't try to overdo it. The result is a smart, sophisticated series aimed at almost every viewer. Another thing that hooked me is the great lines. ""Our free range days are over..."" <Sigh> I love that line. Everything above, combined with a new look at traditionally-accepted vampire mythos, makes Ultraviolet an entrancing option. Too bad it's only six episodes.

1618012,5,B00005KA70,"this DVD was recommended to me by amazon.com itself, and i must congratulate the system that brought this to my attention. any viewer will be quietly devastated that there are only 6 episodes of this series about a building war against vampires and humans. the concept itself has no shock value - we've seen the vampire myth done to death (so to speak) - but what will nab you is the brilliance of the characters, the actors, and the storyline. this is not comic book X-files fodder, with its glitzy special effects. this is drama, and literate drama at that. the interweaving of the characters tales and fates is remarkable for TV. but don't panic if you're the kind who shies away from drama. this isn't heavy. there's chills and spills aplenty for those who like their suspense and a few layers of depth for those who like more meat to their vampire stories. at its core, it is a drama about war, built up around the concept of vampires, and because it uses this myth as its backbone and not it's front cover, it's hard to imagine anyone (even those who don't like vampire stories) won't become involved.
other reviews have said this is strictly for sci-fi/horror fans and i disagree. the four characters - scientist, warrior, cleric and cop - beautifully represent humanity and its struggle to be human. who can't identify with that?",999475200,19,1337,4.669491525423729

I did not recognize any of the actors featured on the cover art and I am not an X-FILES fan (a program that I feel has become much too insular), but the synopsis on the ULTRAVIOLET box intrigued me and I decided to buy it blind. While watching the first episode I felt that the lead had been sorely miscast and that some of the British accents were too thick. By the riveting conclusion of the sixth episode, I was totally hooked by this show, wanting more but grateful for its elegant brevity. ULTRAVIOLET is THE SOPRANOS of sci-fi/horror/fantasy television. Like the popular American gangster series, it elevates its genre to include surprising narrative techniques that enhance the shrewd philosophical nature of the otherwise purely escapist fantasy. The female leads are all terrific, serving as sexy, intelligent, appealing characters whose complicity helps to substantiate this scary world of the supernatural. Colette Brown lights up the screen, taking a typically distracting character and making her interesting, sympathetic and compellingly attractive. The terrific acting is not merely the domain of the women, as Idris Elba demonstrates with his brave portrayal of an eerily fascistic crime fighter who is unafraid of getting blood on his expensive suit. Lead Jack Davenport proves to be a canny choice for a character who is convincingly inept yet ruthlessly resourceful. By the end, I found no fault with the show at all. ULTRAVIOLET offers us a contemporary England not seen in THE ORIGINAL AVENGERS or FAWLTY TOWERS or even Guy Ritchie's gripping gangster pictures. Creator Joe Ahearne is clearly a romantic who knows the nuts and bolts of breathing new life into the lungs of a tired genre and, in the process, raises clever questions about our real world with its unique variety of [people].

There is the Region 1 release, without meaningful extras, and the Region 2 release (""Collectors Edition""), with plenty of extras, or bonus/special features. Obviously the Region 2 release is preferable, *if* you are set up to watch Region 2 discs (for a discussion of this topic, read Wikipedia: DVD_region_code

Here's what you get on the Region 2 discs:

 Featurette: Creating Ultraviolet

 Featurette: Casting Ultraviolet

 Directing Ultraviolet with Joe Ahearne

 Ultraviolet tech

 Audio commentaries

 Deleted scenes

 TV spots, trailers & stills gallery

Hope this helps.",1436313600,,698,5.631067961165049
