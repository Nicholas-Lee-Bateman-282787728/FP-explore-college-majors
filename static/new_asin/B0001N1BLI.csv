8323882,3,B0001N1BLI,"This is a great purchase IF you don't have ""The Archie's"". This appears on ""The Archie's"". Also, sadly this only has two episodes on it. The first one is ""Pot Luck"". The girls have a chili fest using a pot Sabrina finds in her attic. The pot has a magical mind of its own. The other episode is ""TV Witch-Watchers"". Hilda gets fed up with all the terrible things on TV and decides to take things into her own hands with comical results. The entire time of both movies gives this tape a running time of 25 minutes. But if you are The Archie's and Sabrina: The Teenage Witch fan and have not seen these two episodes then this is a great find. Hope that helps.",1429574400,2,656,4.214285714285714
