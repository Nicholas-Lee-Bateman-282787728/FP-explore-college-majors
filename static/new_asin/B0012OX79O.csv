By reading the amazon reviews you'll notice a huge disparity from the star ratings. They're mostly 1 star reviews and 4-5 star reviews.

You may also find his responses to other reviewers. I'd like to accurately provide this information so that viewers can make for themselves an accurate decision.

my original review-----If you have a camera and a means for distribution you can make a DVD movie! That's the message behind this ""not-ready for youtube"" montage.

And no, this is not a comedy.  Inaudible audio, grainy un-lit scenes, angry ranting, uncut tripod shots lasting over 10 minutes and merciless long scenes of babbling make this thing more comparable to a parking ramp surveillance tape than a movie.

3092975,1,B0012OX79O,"In this movie, DJ Galloway is a failed out of work reporter (after having a mental breakdown) in Miami that rushes home in order to save his career by writing a breaking news story on the bigfoot sightings in his home town of Indian Camp Mountain in the Carolinas. However, the sightings are his friends that are concerned about him and want DJ to come home so they can all help him get better.

Ok, that's the good part. The bad is... well... everything else. The acting is absolutely 100% non-professionals. We're talking, these are people that director and lead actor 'Bubba' Cromer found on the street or was related too. Dialogue is even worse, editting is dismal, lighting is non-existant, camera shots are pathetic with evidently only one camera available and it seems to be a camcorder from about 6-12 feet away in every scene. This entire movie consists of horribly 'sighting' interviews between reporter DJ (Cromer) and the local yokels. There is no flow to the movie and everything is out of sequence or makes no sense. Most annoying of all, is when anyone is talking to DJ (or DJ to them for that matter) they will inevitably mention Sheriff Big Jake and point out, without fail, EVERY SINGLE TIME that he is DJ's father, yes even DJ himself does this. The best acting in this movie is actually by his buddies sitting around discussing how to get DJ to come home. Second would be the 'news anchor' seen on the tv in a blatantly non-Miami bar.

Overall, I want my money back. It's 72 minutes of bad camera work, lousy dialogue, unacceptable lighting, junior high editting, and abysmal acting; even for an independent film this is bad. The ""extras"" disc is nothing more than different camera angles of the exact same interviews and maybe 3 deleted scene interviews which were actually better than the scenes used. The budget for this entire production was probably around $12 so with the $19 I bought it for, I guess that means it was a success. Final advice: avoid at any cost. It's not even bad enough to be funny.",1206662400,6,2026,4.64066852367688
3092976,3,B0012OX79O,"This independent film/docudrama, which won top honors at The New York International Film Festival for best Narrative Feature, takes us to  Indian Camp Mountain in Transylvania County, North Carolina, where D.J. Galloway, a former journalist with the Miami Herald (played by Cromer) is telling a story of his father, the local Sheriff, Big Jake Galloway (played by J. Lewis Cromer , James' father) and shows that a Sasquatch or Bigfoot has been killing local livestock and animals. A few local residents play themselves, and there are also actors from the area playing various roles. The acting is not the best in the world, but it is very interesting and entertaining. D.J. seems to be falling apart, getting drunk on a regular basis, depressed and in need of serious psychological help. A group of gentlemen who are either friends of D.J. or people who know him are seen on a patio talking about the situation, and one of them says he might put on his gorilla suit and start scaring people wearing it. Local news reports begin surfacing of more sightings and activity in the small community, and a flashback reveals how D.J. got involved with writing the story which pretty much killed his career as a journalist. The Sheriff discusses a possible killing by the Bigfoot, as well as an alleged sexual harassment by a Bigfoot on a local lady. D.J. interviews several witnesses of the creature, more killings occur, and it leads to...well, I won't give that away. That is Disc 1; Disc 2 is basically alternative views of different scenes in the movie, as well as a few unused scenes.

Living in the area and being familiar with some of the folks in it might make me a bit biased but I am certain that even if the location and faces were unfamiliar, I would find it hysterical.

The ""lead actor"" spends most of his time grimacing in bizarre fashion, half ""fearful"" and half idiiotic, with a strong dose of stupid thrown in for flavor.

If you're looking for a serious look at the subject, this is not it.  If you're looking for a movie that is so bad that it will occasionally make you laugh out loud, and maybe even curse at the screen, then this one is for you.",1411257600,,532,4.520833333333333

8247080,2,B0012OX79O,"If you like turkey movies, ultra-independent films or off-off-off Hollywood productions, you will probably love ""The Long Way Home: A Bigfoot Story"". If you are more partial to normal entertainment, you probably won't...

A successful reporter living in Miami returns to his home county in backwoods North Carolina to investigate Bigfoot sightings. The creature is scarier than usual, stealing chicken, attacking people with the intention of feasting on their fresh carcasses, even sexually assaulting females (of our species, presumably). At first, it seems that the Bigfoot sightings are hoaxes perpetrated by a group of locals, but then it turns out that their gorilla suit was destroyed weeks earlier... Ooops! Brace yourself for some further plot twists. I didn't know they had gay bars in the Tar Heel State, LOL.

But no, it's not a good movie. Not really. All the actors are amateurs from the area where the film was shot, the director and the lead actor are the same person (Bubba Cromer), the dialogue is lousy, and the dancing transvestite doesn't look very convincing either. Even the low-budget classic ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" feels far above this production. A long way home indeed! I'm surprised they actually showed this on UFOTV, but then, maybe they are running out of James Fox documentaries?

""The Long Way Home"" is really only worth one star, but since *somebody* with a penchant for turkeys or a strange sense of humour might actually find it funny, I'm willing to give it two for the effort. Personally, though, I prefer Bobo to Bubba...",1365033600,2,1564,5.030888030888031
8247081,1,B0012OX79O,"This has to be the dumbest and most retarded piece of wasted time ever offered in the movie industry.  I was extremely disappointed.  I am sorry I wasted my money on this one.  It will for sure be back on ebay - if I can do more than give it away.  It is put together in such an awkward way with such a terrible narrator/director that by the end of the first 15 minutes the viewer is well nigh a psychotic breakdown.  This is just stupid accentuated by ridiculous in a steamy vat of manure.  It's not funny, it's not interesting, and I would rather watch Teletubbies - its much more entertaining.  Gets my vote for the worst movie ever and should not be sold for money - ought to pay us to watch it.",1232409600,10,699,4.133333333333334
8247082,5,B0012OX79O,"I read all the discussion here. Then I found the webpage on myspace and read the multiple newspaper articles/reviews. You know what? The vast majority--roughly 90% in my estimate--think this movie is quite substantial if not exceptional. Suffice it to say I bought it to see for myself. Well I agree with the negative critics on a couple things:
1. The production and lighting is sub-par; and,
2. The ""actors"" are clearly not professional nor even experienced for that matter.
HOWEVER,
these weaknesses are the exact qualities that give this film it's gritty charm.
Let's remember folks, it's not a slick Hollywood Production nor does it hold itself out as one.
So, in conclusion, I am giving it 5 stars for it's one-of-a-kind cult clasic qualities and it's salt-of-the-earth, absolute charm as well as to offset what looks to be a couple of ""amazon career naysayers"" whose apparent attempts to sabotage this movie just might have the reverse effect.
It is well-worth the $26.00 and then some.
