8125872,1,B000FS2W4O,"There are quite a few inaccuracies. The phlogiston theory e.g. is an obsolete theory of heat and combustion and has nothing to do with the classical theory of elements (earth, fire, water, air) as stated in the DVDs; the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference, according to Einstein, not in all non-inertial frames of reference as stated in the DVDs, etc...  Most theories are not presented as what they are/were, but mixed in with their consequences, e.g. Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism is mixed with later inferences drawn from the theory, notably about the properties of light...same for Max Planck's paper on the problem of the black body, etc. ALL the experiments are glossed over quickly and cannot be properly understood by the target audience unless a parent trained in physics pauses the DVD and further explains them.  With a little more animation, it would have been easy to explain them though. The famous Michelson-Morley experiment, critical for special relativity, is never even mentioned.  The DVDs are outdated: most TVs or monitors today no longer use cathodic ray tubes; the particle accelerators mentioned are old ones (LHC not mentioned), etc.  The narration (that's virtually all there is) is monotonous; viewers are NOT excited by the tremendous scientific odyssey of the past centuries. 135 minutes --yes, at most 30 (thirty) minutes per DVD-- are not worth the 5 (five) DVDs with quite uninteresting bonus material.  Quite frankly, this is a rip-off.",1358640000,2,1507,5.134693877551021
8125873,5,B000FS2W4O,"This series is an excellent overview of the major turning points in the development of physical sciences (covering chemistry, physics, astronomy, and geology).  While highly condensed, the coverage is adequate as a review for high school level students, or preview/intro for middle school students.

Definitely worth having in your teaching library of supplementary videos!",1224288000,8,373,5.888888888888889
