7841387,5,6303236561,"This is a film made by a man who knows he is dying, and wants to leave something of himself behind for prosperity.  He gives us a real take on life - one that is hard to come by except from the viewpoint of one who really has started to appreciate the value of life, because he knows it will be taken away from him soon.  He discovers and starts to understand the value of love, beyond his sexual activities, in particular through his girlfriend who has her own deep emotional problems. This film is full of real life characters and real life scenes, to such an extent I have not seen in any other film.",1060300800,8,603,4.189655172413793
7841388,5,6303236561,"i completely agreee with the other reviewers. this is a life giving film that intrigues me every time i watch it. why? because it is real life. no apologies, no sermons, no backing away. i am deeply sorry that mr collard  is not around to enlighten us some more. the film is rough, tough and  gritty, but so is life. i treasure this film among my favorites. this was  his life and whether we love it, hate it or just accept it, he brings his  life (right or wrong)to us in a film that cannot be more truthful or more  sincerely portrayed as he has done. i admire his humanity.",952992000,14,576,4.2

It is a big loss for all movie fans around the world that the  person who made this movie is no longer here to make another one.  This one  is a keeper, buy and keep it forever.",951782400,7,332,3.9696969696969697
