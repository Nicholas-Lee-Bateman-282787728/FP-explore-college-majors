7828807,4,6302665329,I bought this movie because it was filmed near where I used to live and was curious. It was lovely to see the scenery I recognised as the story unfolded. I had read the book and the screenplay was pretty true to the original which was also very pleasing. The actors suited their parts admirably and I found the film very entertaining and thought provoking in many ways. So good to see a good story brought to life by tasteful cinematography. Even the one armed part played by Donald Sutherland was believable. Julie Christie was just right as the frustrated artist and there were no weak characters in my estimation. Well done all!!,1381363200,2,632,4.601769911504425

7828809,5,6302665329,"This 1992 movie is a lovely adaptation starring Julie Christie as a widowed artist and Donald Sutherland as a maimed and disaffected restorer of train stations.  They had previously been paired in the 1973&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Don-t-Look-Now/dp/B000069I0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Don't Look Now</a>.

Set on the breathtaking beautiful Irish coast, the chemistry between the two leads in this odd little love story is palpable and deeply affecting.  A charming jitterbug dance scene set at a church jumble (rummage) sale makes both Sutherland and the viewer fall in love with the middle aged Ms. Christie.  The IRA is the villain here andin my opinion the plot line runs kind of thin but it is a haunting movie nontheless.  Christie is always wonderous and this ranks right up there with Klute in leading man performances by Sutherland.",1177027200,7,892,5.778625954198473
7828810,4,6302665329,"After a lengthy absence from films, Julie Christie returned to make this adaptation of the book by Jennifer Johnston. Julie plays Helen, picking up the pieces of her life after the death of her husband in an IRA involved shooting. She moves to a small coastal town in Ireland to raise her teenage son away from the battlefields of the North Ireland cities. There she meets a disfigured war veteran who bemuses most of the villagers with his intentions of getting the local railway station back in working order after years out of service. Shaken out of her comfortable shell of isolation she begins to have feelings for this man despite herself, while the political strife that claimed her husband creeps back into her life. Another amazing performance by Christie. She's beautiful and sad, nearly heartbreaking every moment of the film. She is reunited with her 'Don't Look Now' co-star Sutherland and they have much of the same chemistry from that previous pairing. Overall, a very good film, but most highly recommended for fans of Sutherland or Christie(which I certainly am).",1019779200,31,1080,4.972375690607735
