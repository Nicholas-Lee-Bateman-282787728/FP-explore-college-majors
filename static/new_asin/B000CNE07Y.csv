2467432,5,B000CNE07Y,"We rented this movie because of the location - Venice. We enjoyed viewing it as a family.

The plot has been summarized already: Brothers Prop & Bo lost their mother three months earlier.  Six year old Bo (for Boniface) is living with his unpleasant aunt and uncle and Prop (""Prosper"") is an orphanage.  They escape together to Venice, the place they would have moved with their mother if not for her untimely death.  They meet up with a team of orphans who live in an abandoned theater and support themselves with petty crime.

Prop is tempted to steal some cough medicine to help Bo but then replaces the bottle.  He is reticent to take part in any sort of thievery.  Little Bo reasons that if these other children have helped him, he'll help them in return regardless of whether the activity is objectionable.

The adults are cariacatures, as one typically finds in movies made for kids.  Vanessa Redgrave shines as an empathetic adult who becomes involved in their adventure.  The children are appealing characters, unlike your standard Disney brats.

I was concerned that this movie may glorify crime but I don't think that it did. The scene toward the end with a magical merry-go-round may spook younger children a little.  I'd definitely sit with them through it.

For me, the beautiful scenes in Venice took center stage with an enjoyable story tagging along.",1143331200,6,1367,4.815450643776824

2467445,1,B000CNE07Y,"..because it is bloody awful.

I just watched The Thief Lord with my children, and we were terribly disappointed.  It's a confusing, implausible, poorly directed, very poorly acted mess of a movie.  The setting, in Venice, is beautiful, and the young members of the cast are generally good looking (which, I have to confess, held the interest of our 12-year old) but those are the only points in its favor.

I'm not familiar with the book (which seems to be widely loved) so I couldn't make sense of the plot about a band of runaways, living secretly in Venice, who discover a magic roundabout.  I still have no idea why ALL the characters in the movie appear to be English, even the street newspaper vendor - we are in Italy after all.

The director does a poor job of pacing the movie, and fails to create any sense of magic or drama.  He handles the actors very badly indeed (perhaps his being a German working with an English cast didn't help) allowing the adults to ham it up outrageously, while leaving the childrens' perfomances flat and uninteresting.  Alexie Sayle, as the gang's fence, is a particularly culpable ham; Rollo Weeks, whose performance as the Thief Lord Scipio is supposed to anchor the film, is dreadfully wooden, completely missing the charisma essential to the role.

This is one of the few movies that I've watched with my children where I can think of nothing to recommend it.  Even the special effects at the end are so low-budget and unconvincing that they reminded me of a mid-1980s episode of Doctor Who.

You'd be better off spending your time and money elsewhere.  If you're determined to watch a movie adaptation of a Cornelia Funke book, Inkheart is much, much more enjoyable.",1293580800,,1712,4.708053691275167

Once i found out there was a movie i knew that i had to get it. This movie is excellent because it is a fantasy, mystery, and adventure movie!

But I and my family were disappointed by the shallow, disjointed storytelling involved.  A good movie should also be true in how it presents a story so that consequences follow on actions.  But here, everything works out fine in spite of characters doing them the wrong way.  If nothing else, Scipio should have aged 20-30 years at least for riding the Merry-Go-Round rather than just a few years and all his problems being solved.  My advice is to buy Disney's ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" or ""Oliver"".  Either is a much better movie for children and families.",1239580800,,700,4.596774193548387

Its production quality is first rate, but the values in it are horrible from a traditional values point of view.  The Thief Lord is a son of a wealthy family that steals.  In a way, he is a fifteen year old Robin Hood.  It isn't made clear what he does with the money, except that he seems to support a bunch or orphans and runaway kids.  There is a bit of fantasy in the story as a magical merry-go-around turns kids into adults and adults into kids.  If parents show this movie to their kids, there is much to discuss.  I sometimes say that nobody is completely useless; they can always be used as a bad example.  I'd say the same about this movie - it isn't completely useless, parents can point out all these kids are doing wrong or immorally.  However, there are so many great movies with good traditional values that it seems pointless to waste time on one such as this.

It's not an Academy Winner, but I really liked it. I originally looked this movie up from Rollo Weeks (Scipio) because I saw him in the Little Vampire, but I found a better actor in this: Aaron Johnson (Prosper). He really deserves recognition for this film. He was better than I had expected because I'd only seen him in a cameo role in Shanghai Nights (Charlie Chapmin) a few years before, but I was very impressed with his talent.

The movie in general is a good one and is enjoyable for the family and for all ages.

Grade: B+",1165190400,,675,4.384
2467458,4,B000CNE07Y,"""The Thief Lord"" is a tale of Lost Boys. It begins telling about a pair of orphans, Prosper and Boniface, who are separated at their mother's death by a contemptible Aunt and Uncle who want to keep the 'cute little one,' aptly named Boniface.

Prosper, escapes from the orphanage he's been consigned to and retrieves his little brother.  From there, they escape to Venice where their mother always wanted them to live.

There, they fall into the hands of the Thief Lord---a young man who's the head of a 'family' of homeless children.  In trying to make a fortune for themselves so they don't have to steal anymore, they end up stealing the stone wing from a lion that's part of a mythical merry-go-round.

Meanwhile, the identities of the Thief Lord's crew slowly reveal themselves.  This is a fascinating story of character and often wisdom beyond years.  I rented this movie, but I'm planning on purchasing it with my next order.",1165190400,,932,4.751552795031056
2467459,4,B000CNE07Y,"The Thief Lord was released in my country a couple of months ago and for some reason it immediately caught my attention. A German family adventure/fantasy movie with English language and with English actors - all of that seemed quite unusual and therefore interesting to me. At the same time I never heard of Cornelia Funke's novel of the same name so I didn't know exactly what to expect from it.

I watched Thief Lord today and actually I liked it. It was really fascinating to watch something fresh and different from typical and often annoying Hollywood family stuff. For young ones Thief Lord is an enjoyable family adventure with talented young cast against the background of one of the most beautiful cities in the whole world, Venice. For grown-ups besides that it's a story of bitter loneliness and sometimes misunderstanding which unite most of the characters. Two brothers fifteen years old Prosper and much younger Bo after death of their parents are separated. The younger goes to the old childless relatives and Prosper has been sent to an orphanage. But brothers can't live without each other and for six years old Bo Prosper is the only person who cares about him and loves him so much. Desperate, they run away. They have nowhere to go in the whole world and they are heading to Venice, the city that their mother loved so much. But the city is not welcome to runaways with no money and only unexpected help of a mysterious boy, who called himself Thief Lord and saves them from more troubles. Bo and Prosper join him and his team of orphans who find a refuge in a deserted movie theater. Soon our heroes learn that ancient city is full of surprises and what's is more that strange magical things can happen there. They become involved into rather unexpected events and lives of different characters collide in Venice. We meet a lonely wife and husband, who also heading to Venice, trying to find a runaway child, who was merely a way to suppress their own loneliness, a lonely detective, who was hired to find Bo and some other characters. However, finally for many of our heroes salvation from their troubles will come in a rather unexpected way for each other.

But the loneliest and most suffering from that is mysterious Thief Lord himself who is trying to keep his secrets inside of him. This key character is playing by Rollo Weeks, who looks very good in his rather complicated part. Both Aaron Johnson (Prosper) and Jasper Harris also left very positive impression from their acting, self-reliance and naturalness. Adult characters sometimes look cartoonish but it's really important that they never collapse into stylish clich&eacute;s so typical for Hollywood family entertainment. Even if because of limited running time sometimes the movie doesn't have enough room to development of some characters we know enough about them to feel sympathy or antipathy to them, which is very important for such a film. The acting among adult cast was also not bad with most memorable and likable performance from Jim Carter as Victor.

Thief Lord In the beginning the movie is fast paced and probably a little too short but mostly it's exciting well-filmed film with interesting and original story. The soundtrack one it's own looked very good and it's a very good addition to visual part even if sometimes the music is abstracted from what we saw on screen. And let me to say that visuals for such low-budgeted production were also not too bad. If you are looking for a good non-American family adventure film on English language as an alternative for Hollywood production featuring talented cast, probably you would be unable to find better choice than Thief Lord. Also it's worth to notice that the movie mostly successfully avoids typical and clich&eacute;d for American family films crude humor and language.

I know possibly I'm too generous and surely Thief Lord is not a flawless masterpiece but I rated it 9 out of 10. Unfortunately such enjoyable and beautifully shot family movies so rarely appear in our movie theaters or video stores.

And the last one thing that I almost forgot. I liked very much title song ""Orphan skies"". It was pretty good one.",1159574400,6,4178,4.84593837535014
2467460,2,B000CNE07Y,"I admit to holding high expectations of this film based on the wonderful writings by author Cornelia Funke.  Unfortunatly, this is simply a case where the book transcends the movie.  I found that Funke's literary sense is barely recognizable in this film.  The screenplay, or directing, lacks focus and ambles its way through Funke's delightful story.  I credit the actors for their decent performances, and the setting in modern-day Venice is especially beautiful.  Still, the entire film appeares flat compared to Funke's rich and visual text.  My hope is that Inkheart, Funke's next book-turned-movie, captures the magic and mastery of her prose.  If so, it's a must-see for anyone who really wants to see a book come to life.",1155859200,2,729,5.07563025210084
2467461,3,B000CNE07Y,"I thoroughly enjoyed Corneilia Funke's book, for which this movie is based, and was quite surprised when one of my cousins showed me that it had been made into a film.  The book is charming and very entertaining and from what I've read, Ms. Funke is the third most popular children's writer in Europe.

The story follows two young orphans, Boniface (Bo) and Prosper, his older brother.  Prosper leaves the orphange he had been placed in and rescues Bo from the cluthches of their dreadful uncle and aunt.  Immediately they run off to Venice, a magical city that their dead mother often told them about.  Once there, they encounter a group of young thieves lead by Scipio, the charasmatic Thief Lord, who acts as a sort of paternal figure to the motley crew, who live in a dilapidated theater.

With a bumbling, yet kindly detective on their trail via their aunt and uncle, Bo and Prosper find sanctuary with their new friends and are drawn up in a mystery involving a strange item that the Thief Lord has been hired to retrieve.  An old man and his sister need the object, a huge wooden wing, to complete a magical merry-go-round that supposedly can make the young older or the older young again.  Will the Thief Lord be able to obtain the item?  Will the group of young bandits make away with the huge fortune promised for its retrieval?  And does the merry-go-round really work?  All parts of Funke's entertaining work of children's literature.

For me, the movie just didn't have the magical quality of the book.  Not that this is a bad film and I think children will enjoy it----I still think it could have been given a better treatment for the big screen.  That said, I think people who enjoyed the book may still enjoy the film version as well.  My recommendation, however, is stick with the book.  Nothing beats your own imagination and interruptation of a writer's vision!",1154822400,,1880,4.651515151515151
2467462,4,B000CNE07Y,"Released theatrically in Europe but not here, this film based on the beautifully conceived and written novel by Cornelia Funke makes a lovely film. Many of its high points have already been noted in the positive reviews here. As in the book, the film does manage to highlight the relationships between the children for the deep, trusting bonds that they are, especially and most touchingly, that between the brothers, Bo and Prosper. Each child is terrifically portrayed, from the elusive Scipio to the ""Hedgehog"" and Mosca, a wonderful, welcome and much-needed person of color. Mosca gets his own chance to shine and his personal odyssey becomes a charming and heartbreaking short film of its own. The story of Scipio, so carefully and lovingly told in the book, does get short shrift and at times the film seems so rushed. My son (11) and I read the book breathlessly together and then he read it again on his own. He voiced the same disappointments as I in the pace of the film.

Vanessa Redgrave has a touching cameo as the old beloved sister who tells the magical story of the ""merry go round"" (it feels likes she wants to say ""carousel""!).

The story, in the book and successfully in the film, is a truly original one, and comparisons to Harry Potter seem a stretch and unfair (to both authors and their books). The Thief Lord needs no comparisons, it stands on its own and certainly stands up under repeated watchings (for both my son and I). It isn't the masterpiece that the book is but it is well-made and obviously carefully done with a marvelous sense of its own success. One addition that was annoying and superfluous was the hooking up of Prosper with the orphan girl, Hornet. The book did well without such pandering and the film would have too. Barbarosa's character is played for laughs and done well. The ""Conte"" and his sister's transformations are done with the right amount of mystery and fun and Scipio becomes even more handsome with his. The magic is handled well, I thought, without too much fuss and decent effects.",1152662400,6,2041,4.714285714285714
2467463,5,B000CNE07Y,"This is an enchanting film and our whole family enjoyed it very much! It's a shame that it wasn't promoted very much - I didn't even know about it until I came across it at the rental store. I will definitely recommend it to everyone I know. We watched a rental DVD but now I'm buying it to add to our library.

Although my children (ages 9 and 11) have read other Cornelia Funke books, none of us had read this one. As they say, the book may be better (it usually is), but the movie was fun and engrossing and well worth watching.",1151884800,,531,4.105769230769231
2467464,3,B000CNE07Y,"My friend and I really loved Cornelia Funke's book, The Thief Lord, that's why when I told her that I had bought a copy of its DVD, we got really excited. I had to finish the book in a rush because we really wanted to see the film version.

At first, I have to say that the film was following the book, including the lines thrown by the characters. But then, if you have read the book, you would know that Prosper and Bo met Hornet before they met Scipio. Some parts of the film were also different from that of the book... like when Victor approached Prosper at the cake shop. In the book, Victor didn't say anything. He just looked at Prosper as if he'd seen a ghost. And Barbarossa had a red beard! Scipio also had long hair that he tied in a ponytail. Bo was not really six... in the book, it said that he was five years old. And Prosper was twelve, not fifteen. Actually, there were a LOT of missing parts... and I don't like the way that some scenes were altered. Actually, a LOT of scenes were altered. And some scenes were not included in the book. In short, what I'm saying is that the film producers were not really successful in making a good adaptation of Cornelia Funke's book. If I were Cornelia, I would surely feel upset! You don't want anybody changing the flow of your story, do you? I mean, this film was supposed to be based on a BOOK. Who gives anyone the right to change what's written there?

Though I didn't like the film as much as I liked the book, the cinematography was really nice. The actors too, did a great job portraying their roles. Prosper and Hornet had chemistry, too.

If you loved this film, trust me... you would love the book even MORE. And I'm sure (VERY sure, in fact) that after you've read the book, you will fully understand why I'm saying all these.",1149811200,4,1796,4.276470588235294

This is a delightful story, full of fun, fancy and fantasy but with substance.  It appeals to both the younger-- my 8 year old granddaughter loved it-- and the older set-- her 70 year old grandfather did too, as did my wife and all of us who watched this delightful tale.",1149552000,4,530,4.568421052631579
2467466,4,B000CNE07Y,"Up until the day that I saw ""The Thief Lord"" on the DVD shelf, I was entirely unfamiliar with it and the book it's based on.  It was a wonderful surprise.  It follows the lives of two young boys named Prosper and Boniface who trek off to Venice in order to remain together after losing their mother.  She always told them how magical Venice was, and their expectations were high.  Instead, they are left to fend for themselves on the street until they meet the Thief Lord.  He's sort of a cross between Robin Hood and Peter Pan, though his intentions aren't to stay young forever.

The Thief Lord houses a small band of orphans in an old theater, and Prosper and Bo join them.  They gain the trust of the group when Prosper haggles with a local antiques dealer and garners a large sum of money for the group.  As the story rolls along, Bo and Prosper's relatives hire a private eye to seek them out.  They also run into a nice photographer who ends up helping them quite a bit during their adventures.  Eventually, the duo uncover some wild information about the Thief Lord, hunt for a magical wing, and help there fellow orphans along the way.  It's all done in a wonderful and child-like fashion.  The magic of Venice is slowly revealed and results in quite a grand climax.  The antiques dealer adds a nice bit of comic relief, especially near the end of the film.

In closing, give ""The Thief Lord"" a chance.  It doesn't have the same budget as many other modern ""family friendly"" films, but it is a much better film overall.  It's getting a lot of comparison to the ""Harry Potter"" flicks, but I believe that it stands apart from that film and really doesn't have much in common with it other than the English accents.  I highly recommend it, especially if you have children, but I even recommend it to adults who simply enjoy magical tales.",1148947200,23,1844,4.473053892215569
2467467,5,B000CNE07Y,"To tell you the truth, this is probably the best movie I've seen all year, and probably will be with in the top two or three. Plus, it's a movie the whole family can enjoy, since kids of all ages can watch it.

I rented this movie from blockbuster, and now I'm bugging my mother to buy me it so I can watch it over, and over, and over, and never have to return it.

Alright, so here's the deal, the movie's plot was based on 'The Thief Lord' a book that was written by Cornella Funke. As many say, the book is better then the movie. But darn, did this get close.

Both the movie and the book were full of action, adventure, secrets, and mysteries that had to be uncovered as the plot progressed.

Plot: Prosper (played by Aaron Johnson), age 15 , and his little brother Bo (played by Jasper Harris), age six and a quarter, ran away to Venice after their mother died to escape their aunt and uncle who weren't exactly the nicist people in the world. Once they step foot into Venice, misery seems to follow them everywhere. First off, they have little food and only a few cents left in money, and then Bo comes down with a cough, plus they have no shelter. But all of that changed when Scipio (Played by Rollo Weeks.), also known as the Thief Lord.

Sorry, I can't tell you anymore of the plot, ^_~ No need for me to spoil it for you.

Actors/Actresses: They casted the cast very well, Bo was adorable and did look like a little angel, while both Scipio and Prosper were very cute, while the dective did seem to always change faces with his numerous fake-hair peices, then Hornet and the others were equally good at their ability to act.

Music: The music was wonderful, it really did bring the movie to life. I really did enjoy the ending song, it really did fit the movie well.

Lighting: Wonderfully done, well thought out, and well planned. Of course, the majority of the movie took place at night, which is (I think) hard to do since it's usually pitch black, but even then you could still see the actor's and actress's faces with out putting a blinding spot light on them.

Animation/Special Affects: I think for the budget that this movie had, they did very well. Clearly, this wasn't like the Harry Potter movies where they had alot of cash to film it, but still it was well done.

Pros:

Good actors/actresses

Good animation for the budget

Intense plot that kept you wondering what would happen next.

Music was wonderful

The actors/actresses carried their roles well.

Kept close to the books original plot.

Cons:

Never going to be a second one. :(

I wish they had it a little bit longer to fit in a few mor thigns, but not everything can happen.

Over all: I give it five stars. ^_~

Oh, one last thing, I suggest that you rent the movie before you actually buy it maybe. For some people who like alot of violence, this movie doesn't have to much of it. But, if you enjoyed the book go ahead and get it, you won't be disappointed.

Hope you found this review helpful! ^_^

It perfectly showed how all the characters came to play their own parts. their personalities are all so different, and the movie portrays each and every one of them. I think the actors were amazing, not to mention how cute Rollo Weeks and Aaron Jhonson were.

I really don't understand how it didn't get into theaters!",1145577600,,359,4.698412698412699
2467469,5,B000CNE07Y,"This was an amazing movie! I think it followed the book very well. Besides that point, it had beautiful shots of Venice, and it was also very adventerous. The movie had great acting and amazing visuals. It also explained the bond between the kids very nicely. I'll have to say thumbs up for the thief lord.(it rocks your socks off)And I guess it's just to darn good for the theatres!",1145491200,6,383,4.485714285714286
2467470,5,B000CNE07Y,"My friend and I were at a movie rental place when my friend's dad found this movie among many popular ones. My friend and I were utterly surprised. Having read the book and loved it, i was apprehensive to get it since it never came out in the theaters. But we decided, since the book was so amazing, to try it out.

I am glad i did. The movie followed the plot precisly and i found myself laughing and sitting at the edge of my seat. The characters were exactly how i pictured them although at times they were dry. The movie theater they lived in was better then i imagined it and i was blown away by the scenery of venice.

Overall, i found it very refreshing, having followed the book and bringing my favorite story to life.",1145145600,11,726,4.215827338129497
2467471,5,B000CNE07Y,I loved the book and the movie was actually better than I expected.  OK it wasn't exactly like the book but they very rarely are.  Over all it pretty closely followed the story.  It would have been a very long movie if it were to add every little detail. I thought the casting was great and the scenary was beautiful. It's a fun kids movie that adults will enjoy as well.,1144627200,,371,4.197183098591549
2467472,2,B000CNE07Y,"I was kind of disappointed. Even though distributor Fox decided not to release the movie theatrically in the US, I still kind of hoped that the movie would be great. But it's just not. When I was watching the movie, I couldn't help but notice that they basically crammed as many big events from the book in as possible, but left out the main point of the book, which was these orphan kids living together in a movie theater, and how they've all become like a family. The movie just kind of misses this point completely, instead choosing to go from one big event to another and barely giving these characters any time to sit down and simply chat with eachother, letalone actually develop.

The movie alters the timeline a bit; Prosper and Bo had been living with the Thief Lord and the other homeless kids for a while when the book started. In the movie, they basically just moved in, so they just meet the thief lord and the other kids at the start of the movie. So over the course of the movie, there is really no great friendship between them. It seems like they're more like acquaintances than people who become life-long friends with these street kids.

Without the developed friendship between these characters, there's just no...importance to anything. Nothing seems to be at stake. When the big plot twist is revealed, it's a big ""so what?"" to those who haven't read the book; you didn't get to know these characters or the Thief Lord enough to really care.

Without all the character development, this movie just flies...QUICKLY. The big plot twist that happens about half way through the book, (You know it if you read the book,) happens only 30 minutes into the movie. Just to give you an idea of how quickly this goes by.

Other flaws in the movie are flaws carried over from the book which are made somewhat worse. One complaint that I had about the book was that these characters were just too law-abiding for street kids. But the movie takes this even further; in a movie about street kids, NOTHING, not a single thing, is stolen in this movie. And yes, for those who read the book, in the movie, they don't keep the fake money. Also, what happens to Barbarino seemed kind of farfetched in the book, but in the movie, all realism is COMPLETELY lost regarding this plot point. Similarly, the book's first half was excellent, while the 2nd half was kind of a step down...the movie, unfortunately, basically rushes through the first half to get to the 2nd half, which means there's about 20 minutes at the start of this movie that are really great...then it just kind of loses steam.

Overall, I was really disappointed with this. What we have here is a movie that speeds through the book's big events but forgets the main themes of the book and leaves these characters kind of in the dark. Hornet is reduced almost to a cameo, Mosca's character bares almost no resemblance to the character in the book, Riccio's thievery is never mentioned, Scipio isn't nearly as arrogant and stubborn as he should be....yet Prosper and Bo's relationship, (the 2 brothers who are the main characters) actually ends up working well. The acting was good all around, and of course Venice makes for some cool scenery. The movie also does a good job (a great job, actually) of picking up the pacing near the end. (The movie ends shortly after the Isola Segreta scenes, yet almost everything is included.) Victor and Ida were perfectly cast, as was Barbarosa, (although his beard isn't red in the movie...) But, of course, the movie ends on a happy note whereas the book's ending was, I thought, supposed to be kind of bittersweet.

What we have here is a movie for the younger kids, basically. It takes the chase scenes and the good scenery from the book and kind of throws it together, but (possibly in an effort to keep up the pacing to appeal to a younger audience,) the character development is completely lost. Younger kids will love it; it's simple enough to understand and probably fast enough so they won't get bored. But older viewers who haven't read the book may be put off by how shallow it ends up being, and those who have read the book may be disappointed by how simplified the story was and how character-less these characters are.",1144022400,4,4238,4.614058355437666
2467473,2,B000CNE07Y,"I really enjoyed the book so I was excited to see it was made into a movie. Unfortunately, the movie is not near as good as the book.

2467474,3,B000CNE07Y,"Since a lot of movies aren't set in the lush Venice landscape, THE THIEF LORD is commended for its use of the canals and gorgeous buildings.  The story based on a popular children's books is somewhat like OLIVER with a 16 year old Fagin.

Two orphaned brothers escape the grasping clutches of their nasty relatives and head for Venice, where they are taken in by a gang of young thieves, headed by the charismatic Thief Lord, Scippio.  Meanwhile a private eye has been hired to find the boys, and the quest for a mysterious wing lures the boys into a lucrative theft.

It's all far-fetched but engaging, and the young cast tries hard.  The warmth and love between the two brothers is refreshing and the adults are game, including a cameo by Vanessa Redgrave.",1143763200,11,758,4.626865671641791
