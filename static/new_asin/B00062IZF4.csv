The box says it does, but it is in fact an older film called ""Stampede"" with Charles Starrett.  Considering the fact that I bought it for the Cameron/Storm movie...I must say I was very much NOT pleased.  So if that's the film you're buying the set for...it isn't on there!",1227830400,,396,4.628571428571429

8037312,4,B00062IZF4,"TOUGH GUYS OF THE WEST features all the big cowboy stars of the 1930s and 40s, plus many other well-known actors. These mostly hour-length oaters were often screened back then as half of a Saturday afternoon matinee. If you've never seen in action Hoot Gibson, Ken Maynard, Buck Jones or Bob Steele (other than in his F-Troop! role of Trooper Duffy), this fine DVD box set will afford you just that opportunity. With ten double-sided discs containing twenty still well-loved westerns, TOUGH GUYS is a great way to start your ""classic westerns"" library off on the right hoof.

8037313,5,B00062IZF4,"Tough Guys of the West is a collection of 20 Westerns that have only one thing in common: they are all public domain and as such it is possible for them to be presented in highly affordable collections. I paid $23.99 for my set and that comes down to less than $1.25  per movie. The way that movie tickets cost nowadays, you really cannot complain about this collection.

This deal is even better when you consider that many of the movies in this collection are available as individual movie DVD's at prices of $5 and higher. Many of the movies in this collection are presented in better condition than they are from other DVD companies.

Additionally, some of these movies are of such quality and/or proven audience appeal you just have to wonder just why the movie studios did not renew their copyrights. Chief among these are Santa Fe Trail starring both  Errol Flynn & Ronald Reagan, Angel and the Badman starring John Wayne and Abilene Town starring Randolph Scott.

All in all, a great deal for the money.",1180396800,4,1011,4.625698324022347

8037316,5,B00062IZF4,"This is a review of the ""Tough Guys of the West"" 20 movie DVD collection issed by Brentwood Home Video.

What you have here is a very good collection of 20 B-Westerns.  The films transfers range from very good or excellent to very poor.  But, overall these are all watchable and are generally in fairly decent quality overall considering the age and nature of public domain films.

The film transfers for most are at least adequate and generally as good as or better than the typical low-end type of public domain product available out there. But, as I noted there are exceptions, however, and some films are in much better shape than others, but there are only maybe three or four films that I would call very poor transfers (still watchable, but in poor quality), most of the rest of the films here are such that you can generally enjoy the movie itself without being overly distracted by the scratches, fuzziness, splices, etc.

Some of the films that rank in the lower end of the quality range here include: Aces and Eights, Arizona Gunfighter, Gangster's Den, and Frontier Fury.  These four films are pretty fuzzy looking - you can watch them o.k., but if you happen to really, really like any of those and were considering buying this collection just for those four films, you should look elsewhere for better copies.

On the other hand, ""Abilene Town"" is in much, much better quality here than I have seen in some other collections and ""Hittin' the Trail"", ""Stampede"" and ""The Painted Desert"" are also in very good condition here - these are all very good to excellent in terms of picture quality most of the time.  Probably as good as it gets for these great old films.

The Roy Rogers film, ""Nevada City"" is a sharp picture, but it is washed out looking - you can compensate somewhat by increasing the contrast and still get a decent result.

In addition, please note that the Roan Group has issued a much, much better quality DVD version of the Roy Rogers film ""Billy the Kid Returns"" than what you find here in this collection.  Also, if you are looking for a near perfect quality DVD of ""Angel and the Bad Man"" you need to get the one issued by Good Times which is much better than the film transfer of that film included in this collection.  In both cases those two films are certainly very watchable in this collection, I'm just letting you know that if you want perfect copies of those two films and are willing to pay the extra money to get them, significantly better film transfers can be found elsewhere.  The ones on this collection are certainly watchable and enjoyable, just not perfect.

Here is a list of the movies included in this set:

Abilene Town - Randolph Scott
Aces and Eights - Tim McCoy
Angel and the Badman - John Wayne
The Arizona Gunfighter - Bob Steele
Cavalcade of the West - Hoot Gibson
Dawn on the Great Divide - Buck Jones
