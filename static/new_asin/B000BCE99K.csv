With all the disappointing remakes Hollywood has churned out and keeps on churning, this one's got it goin' on. Made with righteous visual flare by Tony Scott, it features my NEW favorite Denzel Washington performance.

Tony Scott has always been an entertaining director. But here he creates a totally new kind of filmic style--packing the screen with stunning visuals, kinetic action, all the while mixing medias to provide the viewer with story information through subtitles, voice overs, music choices, etc.

I received this DVD for Christmas and watched it twice by new years. Now I'm pissed I missed Tony Scott's DOMINO in the theaters--but I guess that's what DVD's are for. If you have not seen MOF, for sure check it.",1136160000,,739,4.943548387096774
