If your only interested in self defense, you will want to study JKD after seeing this DVD. I suggest you try Sifu Strongs 4 DVD set. All 4 are JKD at a higher level.

8005125,5,B00011HJ70,"Patrick Strong does a fantastic job of breaking down and explaining the priciples that make Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do such a unique fighting style. Learning how to develop speed and power in a very small distance, is the key to becoming a dangerous ""inside fighter."" This DVD will teach you the drills and forms you need to develop the ability to do just that. I definately recomend this DVD to any Martial Artist interested in becoming  more efficient and effective in combat.",1131321600,,476,4.734939759036145
