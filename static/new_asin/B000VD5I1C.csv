2936438,5,B000VD5I1C,"I like how this video was put together. It seems to be a great introduction to Human Evolution. It explains some of the roles that Geologists, archaeologists and paleoanthro-pologists have contributed to evidence of human evolution. They have skeletons that looked something like apes but walked upright like us. The video explains how they determine the age of the fossils, and these creatures that lived millions of years ago etc. It examines the development of fossils which gives us insight into human adaptation and evolution.

They even examine the ""fossils throat region"" of these upright walking creatures and reconstruct it based on anatomy which may show they evolved into what we have today, that allowed us to speak this way.",1221868800,26,737,5.141666666666667
2936439,5,B000VD5I1C,"I used this in my anthropology class for high school juniors and seniors and they were very interested in it, asked questions and received a better grasp of the material.",1202428800,7,170,4.7
8218125,5,B000VD5I1C,Hubby liked it!,1505001600,,15,4.333333333333333
8218126,4,B000VD5I1C,I liked the straightforward presentation of information.  The usual overly-dramatic presentations of other DVDs distract from the facts.,1416873600,,136,6.555555555555555
8218127,4,B000VD5I1C,"Not great quality audio, but solid facts.  I watch it often.",1416873600,,60,4.454545454545454
8218128,1,B000VD5I1C,very low on entertainment value. dry and stale.  boring interviews with anthropologists.  don't show you students they will die from boredom! waste of money!,1358467200,,157,5.5
8218129,4,B000VD5I1C,"This is not the type of documentary you find on the discovery channel that tries to both inform and entertain at the same time.
If you want cgi special effects, look somewhere else. This 3 part series tells what we know (or think we know) about early man.
It`s strictly information. They make no attempt to entertain anyone.
This, part 3 of the series, has focus on the middle and upper paleolithic.
Great for high school science classes or anyone who is truely interested in what is known about early man without a lot of fluff
thrown in.",1267920000,3,539,4.510204081632653
8218130,4,B000VD5I1C,"This is not the type of documentary that you see on the history channel that tries to both inform and entertain at the same time.
There are no CGI special effects, no attempt at showing you a day in the life of a prehistoric man, and very little in the way of
speculation. When they say ""Just the Facts"", that`s exactly what they mean. Just what we know (or think we know) about early man.
Great for high school science classes or anyone truely interested in early man.",1267920000,7,469,4.340909090909091
8218131,4,B000VD5I1C,"First of all you should understand that this is intended as an introduction to human evolution. It`s not the type of documentary
that you see on the history channel. Those are intended to both inform and entertain. This is strictly for information, they make
no effort to entertain anyone. There are no flashy CGI special effects. It simply tells what we know (or think we know) about
early man and human evolution. There is little in the way of speculation and no attempt at drama.
Great for high school classes or anyone who is interested in what is known about early man.",1267920000,14,574,4.637254901960785
8218132,5,B000VD5I1C,"The first DVD on Just The Facts, Prehistoric Man deals with the begiining of Human Evolution.  And in doing so the DVD starts off explaining how we think we know the things we do.  They talk about how fossils are found, how we know their age, how to look at and understand what the fossils are telling us, and so on.  When did man first start to walk?  When did man start to evolution a voice?  When did man start making tools?  Building fires?  Using the TV remote?  Eh, never mind that last part.  You get the idea.  This DVD is a must for the series - if you can only buy one out of all three of the DVDs, I would strongly suggest this one.",1262044800,18,643,4.031746031746032
8218133,5,B000VD5I1C,"This DVD is about the first members of the genus Homo and their spread from Africa to Europe and Asia.  It asks how did they survive?  Did culture start with them?  How about fire?  Stone tools? Language?  How did they compete with vultures, hyenas, and big cats for food and shelter?
Lots to enjoy, with no TV adds in the way.  50 minutes of pure bliss for those of us who love human evolution, history, and fossils!",1262044800,5,417,4.35064935064935
8218134,5,B000VD5I1C,"I like just the facts.  No cartoons, no explosions, no half-naked cavemen fighting off cave bears.  Well, that is cool, but I want just the facts, to examine, to explore, to think about.  Let me decide what I think about Neanderthals and let me decide what I think about Homo sapiens.  A great DVD - even if it seems kind of old and feels like a 1980's video.  In other words it feels a tad cheap but maybe that's because there is no flash just facts.  The scientists in the DVD show you the stone tools, they show you the fossils, they explain the views points, the theories, they talk about the changing environments and they don't talk down to you.  Sit back, get some tea and enjoy.  Thinking IS good for you.",1261440000,6,713,4.30827067669173
