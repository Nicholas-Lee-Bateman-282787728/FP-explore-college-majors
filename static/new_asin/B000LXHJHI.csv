2717579,4,B000LXHJHI,"I remember watching ""A Bit of A Do"" many years ago.  It is a dry comedy, with some great classic moments.  I am not sure if it has aged perfectley but I still found it funny.  Each episode is set around a ""party"" of ""do"" with the same characters.  Stephanie Cole is great.  David Jason is always great.  ""Neville"" is my fav character.  Got to go now, I need to go to ""a bit of a do"" !",1311379200,5,384,3.8461538461538463
2717580,1,B000LXHJHI,"The first episode was OK. But the second and third were tired retreads of the same material.  I gave up watching this series after the third episode.
I have found many Britcom gems, but this one was one of the few duds.  A sad waste of David Jason's talent!  If you like his comedic style, get the ""Fools and Horses"" series.",1285372800,5,324,4.278688524590164
2717581,5,B000LXHJHI,I bought this set because I love British TV and this is one of many sets I have bought and love everything I have got. I love all the cast in this set they have done a wonderful job and some of the cast are in other sets that I own. Would love to see more sets like this I can watch it over and over.,1283990400,7,300,3.5606060606060606
2717582,5,B000LXHJHI,"A DO = social affair. The 'Do's' encourage other affairs! Snobbery meets uncouthness. The battle of the lower social classes. Hormones at all age levels compete with social over-drinking. The actors/actresses perform their stereotype British roles so well it becomes a series of hilarious class faux pas, adultery, and clumsiness. it takes only about 2-3 episodes to fall in love with these eclectic characters.

A favorite quote from the series: The young groom says, ""The mind boggles."", and that is a fitting caption for the entire series. It's a really fun series of ""DO's' happening at the local pub called ""The Angel."" Some great watercolor characterizations of cast for opening credits. No subtitles but does have some extra interviews and cast filmographies. Great British-style comedy.

Ted (David Jason-'The Darling Buds of May') is superb.
Liz (Nicola Pagett-'Scoop') is naughty, beautiful, and perfect in the role.
Betty (Stephanie Cole-'Doc martin', 'Lillie') drinks lots, acts well.
Laurence (Paul Chapman-'As Time goes By', '2 ep Midsomer Murders') always good.
Neville (Michael Jayston-'2 ep of Foyle's War') is a hit. So many more stars.

Episode details avoiding spoilers:
1 THE WHITE WEDDING-a nuptial 'DO' due to pregnancy that only the bride/groom know about. Groom's mom, Lix, makes a pass at bride's father, Ted. She calls herself 'a flame with sexual hunger.' Ted drools. A lawyer mourns.

2 THE DENTISTS' DINNER DANCE- In-laws invite Ted/Rita to 'A Bit of a DO,' The working class pair arrives overdressed. Liz renews the winks & kiss blowing at Ted. Recent widower, Solicitor Badger, is yet grief stricken. A secret revealed.

3 THE ANGLING CLUB CHRISTMAS PARTY-Ted returns social niceties and invites Lawrence and all to his own Christmas 'DO'. Widower Neville, arrives costumed as Henry the VIII. Ted's a phony champ in more ways than one.

4 THE CHARITY HORSE-RACING EVENING-A fund raiser for theatre brings our relationship-challenged extended family to yet another 'DO.' It's TV horse-betting for charity. You can bet on another complicated evening with pairs and issues as mixed as the bets. Tongues wag along-side horse wagers. Jenny/Paul bring baby Thomas.

5 THE CROWNING OF MISS FROZEN CHICKEN (UK)-Honoring frozen hens with a skimpy clad buxom queen is the most normal thing that takes place at this 'DO.' Blackmail runs as rampant as attempts of reunification among adulterizing couples. There's even corruption among judges at the 'fowl' beauty pageant.

6 THE REGISTRY OFFICE WEDDING-Carol arrives, the 3rd place chicken queen, liaison of Paul, who broke up with wife Jenny, who is to marry Elvis, philosophical looser bro of Paul, who's mom shows up with a boyfriend about their age. All meet at the wedding of Neville to--well, that's a surprise. Confusion is life-as-normal for this 'DO' loving group.

7 THE CHURCH WEDDING-Young Gerry, greets guests coming to his wedding--even his intended's ex. The wedding is necessarily suspended do to a missing participant. The reception/food/the 'DO' carries on-in a fashion.

8 THE CHRISTENING-The 1st of babies conceived in this odd group of people is christened. Hopefully NONE of the children (or those yet unborn) at this service will take interest later in their genealogy. The christening 'DO' is a result of NOT enough previous 'DON'Ts'.

9 THE GRAND OPENING OF SILLITOE'S-Newly sobered Sillitoes are opening a non-alcoholic health food complex & restaurant by throwing a 'DO.' They invited all their friends--the bulk are mostly enemies between each other. Lots of talk between non-speaking relationships.

10 THE FAREWELL PARTY-Ted throws his own glittering sophisticated farewell 'DO'--as relations between the relations' relation grow. Will anyone ever find love outside of this dysfunctional small community? But there's the occasional merry mingle too.

11 THE INAUGURATION OF THE OUTER INNER RELIEF RING ROAD-The road launch, of course involves a 'DO' attended by Counselor Rita Simcock, the day after her son was jailed. Ring road supporters and opposition attend causing plenty of 'ring' fights.

12 THE FUNERAL-'DO' = wake. Of course it is in memory of one of the extended family clan. The bereaved spouse keeps a brave upbeat appearance, almost. A serious occasion, almost.

13 THE CIVIL WEDDING-2 weddings on the same day. 2 'DO's' on the same day--at the same location. To many past issues together in one place. 2 classes clash and pass the champagne.

A LOL series.",1273363200,21,4480,5.279887482419128
2717583,5,B000LXHJHI,"This is classic British drama at its best. Takes you back in time to the land of enchantment and British pomp and pagentry. Aristocraticly beautiful with excellent screenplay and beautiful cinematography depicting the beautiful English countryside. Ohhh, it just totally takes your breath away. And, the lead characters are just absolutely marvellous. I grew up on this back in the day when I was a college student in London in the 90s'. I just couldn't get enough of it. Splendidly beautiful. Brilliant...!!!",1207526400,2,509,5.219512195121951
8165201,5,B000LXHJHI,David Jason is just superb! Very much in the vein of 'them and us' and taking the proverbial micky out of everything. Not to be missed.,1513036800,,135,4.230769230769231

8165204,5,B000LXHJHI,"These sketches of family-life events over several years are terrific & have you laughing out loud.  Even though it is an old series, the life themes are always current.  You'll love the outcome so stick with the whole series.  What I loved best, is all the story telling & detail is in the 'conversations',,,,not action packed.",1463184000,2,327,4.803571428571429

8165206,1,B000LXHJHI,"I watch this complete series, that I bought and it was a BIG DUD! episode after episode was that same old thing whether an affair at the office, an affair at a wedding or whatever. The entire thing was BORING! I thought it would get better but really it was crap. Am going to give it away probably to the local library. Its not worth buying. It was not funny, it was a boring drama.  bob susanville, calif.",1448668800,2,406,4.205128205128205

8165209,5,B000LXHJHI,"If you are following any of my movie reviews, you know I enjoy older movies. These show a slightly different view of what is now. This one has laughs for yourself and for the situations the characters get into. There are consequences for actions that effect others beside ourselves.",1377475200,2,282,4.775510204081633
8165210,2,B000LXHJHI,"I often buy Britcoms sight-unseen and loved David Jason in Fools and Horses, and Open All Hours.  This was a bit of a let down.  Interesting, but not funny.  Amusing maybe?  I haven't laughed yet although I see the humor in human fickleness.",1350000000,3,241,4.534883720930233
