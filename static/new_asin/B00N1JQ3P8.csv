6606481,5,B00N1JQ3P8,"Stylish editing, and an amazing pace, keeps one on the edge of their seat throughout the lean runtime of this fun little actioner. Lead Katharine Isabelle has proved time and time again that she is an amazing actress, and here she gets to play a fairly different character than what she's mostly known for (big time horror). Christopher Lloyd gets a fun role to sink his teeth in to as the lead baddie, and is menacing enough to feel like  legitimate threat, but not so much to make an ending twist not work. The hallucinations throughout are well done, visually speaking, and the way they tie back into everything else is clever. Seriously worth the price! Pick up as soon as possible.",1423094400,2,686,4.622950819672131
6606482,5,B00N1JQ3P8,This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Sadly it will probably never get the recognition it deserves. It's so well written and filmed that you don't even realize the time has passed while you are watching it. 88 is a rollercoaster ride of emotions and intensity.

6606487,4,B00N1JQ3P8,"A woman named Gwen (Katherine Isabelle from American Mary and Ginger Snaps) suffers a psychotic break after the death of her boyfriend that results in disassociation and her assumption of an the alternate identity named Flamingo.  88 cuts back and forth between separate narrative lines involving Gwen and her pure Id alter-ego Flamingo--and since that apparently wasn't confusing enough the movie also completely scrambles the chronology of its scenes, resulting in a film that is sometimes almost impossible to follow.

The fancy narrative sleight of hand ultimately boils down to Gwen retreating from a truth that's too horrible for her to process and her creation of an alternate reality that gives her someone she can blame.  Without Katherine Isabelle's lead performance to ground the film 88 might have been an incomprehensible mess not worth the time and effort to untangle but Isabelle, who is on-screen for nearly every moment of the film, provides a mesmerizing through-line for the viewer keeping 88 highly watchable even when it threatens to ultimately make no sense.

Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future) is cast against type as the principle heavy and is surprisingly effective.  Screenwriter Tim Doiron, director April Mullen and Lloyd all previously collaborated on the far less interesting horror comedy Dead Before Dawn.  88 is a big step forward in terms of ambition but it's ultimately Katherine Isabelle's film--she provides the humanity behind 88's puzzle pieces narrative which culminates in a final shot that could have simply been clever bookending but is transformed by Isabelle into a frozen moment in time that is genuinely shattering.

In the end 88 is a slick and enjoyable ride that rewards viewers who have the patience to stick with it.  It also provides further proof that in the world of cult films Katherine Isabelle is truly a star.",1420761600,12,1872,5.175496688741722
6606488,5,B00N1JQ3P8,"88 is a smart original Canadian film, words I never thought I would never put in the same sentence. The opening of the film defines ""Fugue State"" which is a type of amnesia which creates a separate personality, normally triggered by a traumatic event. Gwen (Katharine Isabelle) has had such an event as her boyfriend has been killed in front of her. She turns into the cold heartless, no filter Flamingo. Flamingo is a killer while Gwen is not. She attempts to unravel what has happened and believes Cyrus (Christopher Lloyd) killed him.

Flamingo in her new personality doesn't recognize people Gwen knows and Gwen doesn't know people that Flamingo has met. The film is filled with flashbacks. The number ""88"" is used for everybody's address, but is a reference to the script as to how it loops back and creates a double infinity symbol for the two personality plot line. The time spent as each personality is evenly done. The soundtrack is 180 degrees different between the two personalities. And something I didn't figure out to late was there was a rather lame trigger song ""Come Be With Me Love"" that would jolt Gwen out of her tough girl Fugue State and back into herself.

However, this is not a film for everyone. The flashbacks are at times confusing. The soundtrack is original and could have been better. It swings from a grindhouse film to an indie drama at the drop of a hat.

6606555,1,B00N1JQ3P8,"I've always said that previews can be deceiving, because it's the job of the people who make them, to make any film look good, even something as bad as 88. The story itself had promise, featuring a young woman named Gwen (Katharine Isabelle), who wakes up on the side of the road with amnesia and a gun. In those first five minutes, the film looks decent enough, but it's pretty much all downhill from there. The film is centered on Gwen and utilizes flashbacks, to show her life before the amnesia, and what cased the amnesia, but they don't stop there, as they go from the present to flashbacks on just about every character you meet. If that wasn't confusing enough, that's when the flash forwards begin and once that happen, I was completely lost. Every thing in this movie flashes at the speed of light. and it is impossible to know what the hell is going on! The casting for this film also seemed like a bad joke, as you've got a star, who seems to be a reject from the real housewives of the trailer park, being chased by Christopher Lloyd. At nearly 80 years old, the man who brought Doc Brown to life, is one of the bad ass gangsters this girl works for, is afraid of, is in love with, who knows? And that's the point, no one know because no one can follow this movie! 88 is just one bad trip, that's all over the place and features a cast that is way to old to be believable. I don't say it often, but there is absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie and you should most certainly avoid it!",1434326400,6,1506,4.306338028169014

6606569,4,B00N1JQ3P8,"The closed captioning is delayed by about 6 seconds for this movie, which is very irritating.  I tried viewing on a Fire Stick (rebooted it as well), a PS3 and on my computer, all with the same 6 second (or so) delay.  Other movies are not having this problem, so I assume it's a problem with the movie. I went to too many rock concerts in my youth and can't hear the upper range well anymore, so CC really helps my enjoyment of a movie. Hopefully Amazon can fix this, I couldn't find any other way of alerting Amazon to this problem.  I'm leery of buying any more movies from Amazon.  For example, it's cheaper to buy the blue-ray version of Everly than buy the Amazon video version, and I'm pretty sure the blue-ray will have proper subtitle synchronization.

I enjoyed the movie and giving it the 4 star rating I think it deserves.  For all of it's confusion, it is ultimately a fairly simple story. There is decent intrigue and the acting is fine, but there are a few scenes that just missed their mark. I can look past those, but be warned about the subtitles.",1429574400,,1065,4.380710659898477
6606570,5,B00N1JQ3P8,"I remember a few years back, turn of the century when a clever young man named Christopher Nolan appeared on the movie scene with a movie called Memento that he'd cooked up with his brother in which all sorts of audience expectations went down in flames in order that a bold, challenging and rewarding narrative might rise up phoenix-like from the ashes. Not long after, Nolan was given the chance to basically define cultural escapism for a decade and a half.

Now it's time for a new generation, and one Lucy Mullen has thrown her hat into the ring with a piece every bit as challenging and rewarding as Memento ever was, and blessed with the unique talent of American Mary herself Katherine Isabelle in what might be the role of her career, but her career is young.

88 is not a good film.  It showed up in the recommended section of my Netflix list, which makes me wonder just what I've watched to suggest sending it my way.  I suppose on the surface I could see a connection between my usual preference toward (weaker) thematic choices and the endorsement here, but one hopes my taste is not so poor as to have this be my baseline.

88's narrative is told out of sequence.  Like the music of System of a Down, its telling is kinetic, a garble of sights, ideas, and sounds thrown together and left until ripe, all this missing the strange ingredient which somehow makes System work where it should otherwise fail: harmony.  It wants to echo films like Memento, using the disorienting quality of its story as a hook to keep the audience engaged, though unlike Memento, the writing and directing are not nearly strong enough to fuel the effort.  The frantic cinematography echoes Natural Born Killers minus Stone's competency, leaving viewers with little to no breadcrumbs from the outset to follow this mess of a trail to its Witch House conclusion.  I stayed only to see if all these aberrant ends came together in a logical bow, and they do, mostly, but the moment where everything clicks only acts as a sigh of relief the experience is finally over, rather than one of happy resolution.  Like the bruise you cannot seem to stop pushing, 88 is a poor decision I remained hypnotized by through stubbornness alone.

The use of a mental breakdown as plot device - or fugue state, used here - is not wholly uncommon, nor nearly curious enough for me to have to suspend my disbelief so drastically.  88's difficulty and stumble, however, is not the separate trajectories its looking to merge as it reaches its climax, but rather, again, the presentation it chooses in which to serve these courses.  Like Gwen, the main character, we are left disoriented from the start as our (and her) journey begins, a choice I would traditionally support as a means of immersion, though without any compass ten, twenty, thirty minutes in with which to orient myself, I became less concerned by the escalating nature of Gwen's situation, and more frustrated by its muddy delivery.  Nothing here is satisfying.  Even now, having finished, 88 is not good enough to warrant a second viewing to see if there are clues enough for those in-the-know to pick out within the cacophony.

Christopher Lloyd is in this.  I'm not sure why.",1425859200,,2501,4.863207547169812
6606577,4,B00N1JQ3P8,"I guess I would say this falls into the ""Rubber Reality"" genre of films. Not a perfect fit perhaps but close enough to let the viewer know he/she is in for a wild ride.

Here's the scoop. Gwen (Katherine Isabelle) has seen her boyfriend gunned down by her boss/mentor Cyrus (Christopher Lloyd). Now she's on a revenge spree killing everyone associated with the deed. But what is really happening and what is she just imagining?

The movie starts with a definition of the term 'fugue state' so the viewer is forewarned that not all is as it seems. From there it's off to the races. The scenes are really weird in that the viewer has a difficult time determining what is actually going on. I'm guessing that repeated viewing (while taking prodigious notes) would help clarify things. In some scenes Gwen is a hard hitting, self assured, in your face rough neck. In others she's a frightened, trying to save her butt kind of gal. Isabelle is in, essentially, every scene so her acting is key to understanding the character. I'm guessing this all adds up at some level. A big question is: Should a viewer have to work this hard to enjoy a movie? Some, of course say yes. Others may need the movie to come to them.

There is good use of leitmotif. Gumballs and milk come to mind immediately. Katherine Isabelle does a decent job, though, in some scenes, she played more a type than an actual character. Chris Lloyd did well as a 'heavy.' Not a role I'm used to seeing him in. The sound design was pretty cool. Now and then a high-pitched whine would appear. I'm guessing this is to signify her fugue state.

As I mentioned, this is not everyone's cup of tea. It's not a relaxing kind of flick and demands much from the viewer. It's 88 minute (get it? 88?) running time won't tax your couch time. But for those willing to give it their attention, there are rewards to be had.",1423785600,4,1869,4.472140762463343
6606578,3,B00N1JQ3P8,"There's not a lot here you haven't seen before but it's worth a view. The film speeds along and doesn't overstay its welcome. Drop this in between a couple of similar films (Memento, Fight Club, Inception, Jacob's Ladder,etc.) and it makes for a good late nite or weekend triple feature.

Worth a rental.",1423440000,,304,4.735849056603773
