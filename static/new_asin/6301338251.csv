Nevertheless, I still prefer Sills in this role to anyone else.  It is true that she is at the end of her career here, but she looks great and still sounds pretty good also.",1436918400,,341,4.296875
7812043,5,6301338251,"This New York City Opera performance of Massenet's Manon was filmed live at Lincoln Center on October 18, 1977. This production is available only on VHS since it has not been made into a DVD. Hopefully, VAI (Video Artists International) will put it on DVD very soon. Beverly Sills has long been hailed as the greatest interpretor of Manon. No one has surpassed her in this role to the day, not even sopranos who have taken on the role in current years- Angela Gheorgiu and Renee Fleming. Sills first sang the role in 1969 at the NYC Opera with tenor Placido Domingo as Des Grieux. One critic wrote after this performance that Beverly Sills as Manon was as much a New York City icon as the Statue of Liberty. She recorded the role with tenor Nicolai Gedda, for which she won a Grammy and Edison Award. In this production, tenor Henry Price stars as Des Grieux, a terrific performance when compared to the weak and lackluster Alfredo in the Traviata he sang with Sills at the Wolf Trap Festival. Richard Fredericks in the baritone role of Lescaut is remarkable, providing bravura, wit, charm and even humor. For fans of Samuel Ramey, this is a must have seeing how he makes an appearance as the Conte Des Grieux the Father. His bass voice is unsurpassed and he is younger and in better voice in this 1977 performance. Samuel Ramey was undiscovered then but he is now a superstar in the opera world, having conquered the bass repertoire with his many Devil roles- Mephistophele, Faust, Damnation of Faust, villains in the Tales Of Hoffman and even Don Giovanni.

The story of Manon is about a French country girl whose passionate and wordly longings make her uncle Lescaut put her into a convent. But she escapes with her newfound love Des Grieux to his apartment in Paris. She is forced to betray him by Lescaut her uncle who offers her a life of pleasure, wealth and luxury among the aristocracy. Des Grieux becomes a priest in St. Sulpice while Manon rules in the gilded world of the social elite. But she secretly pines for Des Grieux and decides to win him back. The St. Sulpice scene is incredible to watch, very intense and emotional as the lovers are reunited. The finale is tragic and heartbreaking as Manon is put to jail for a crime of theft, a set up by the jealous Frenchman sung by Nico Castel. She dies in front of Des Grieux. No one could do the role of Manon like Beverly Sills. Along with her Queen Elizabeth in Roberto Devereux and even her Cleopatra in Julius Caesar this performance will be one of her lasting triumphs.",1092614400,8,2537,4.56359649122807
