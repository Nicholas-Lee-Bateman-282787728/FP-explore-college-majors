8174105,5,B000N2HD5U,"I would rate the entire series overall as being a 5/5. I don't even like anime very much but this was one of the few exceptions. This series is smart, thought-provoking, exciting, and well-written. The characters have so much depth and even the main characters who you are supposed to root for are flawed which makes them interesting. I think the world needs more science fiction like Ergo Proxy -- less focus on gratuitous explosions and alien battles, and more focus on thought-provoking scenarios that question the repercussions of our advancing technology.

I will say that this series was also pretty confusing at times. They tend to do this thing where something happens that you just don't understand, and you are not sure if you are supposed to know what is going on or not (usually it turns out you are not SUPPOSED to know at the time, but it is explained later on). So I will say, don't let the confusion turn you off. Everything is explained and wrapped up neatly.

Overall, I did not want this series to end!",1399420800,,1021,4.6353591160221
8174106,4,B000N2HD5U,"a solid story, interesting characters although the voice acting is a little forced and wooden, it's still entertaining.  not overly violent but does have adult subject matter within it",1357084800,,184,5.344827586206897
8174107,5,B000N2HD5U,"I waited to review any of these until I had a chance to watch the series all the way through.  If you think you 'get it' before you finish the set, I would be very surprised if you turned out to be correct.

Anyone who likes everything spelled out 100% will have a hard time with this series. This is a solid continuation of the story that seems to focus on the backstory of the security chief more than anything else.  It is interesting to see what has been happening in Romdo since Re-L and Vincent left.

I do not believe these discs stand on their own, so feeling terribly lost should be expected if you have not watched them from #1-3 before starting  this one. If you've made it this far, I encourage you to keep going -- the story keeps getting more odd, but there is resolution.

As far as extras on the disc, don't expect too much -- basically the episodes, 'clean' opening animations and some trailers.  I am not big into that kind of thing anyway.",1240012800,,958,4.288888888888889
8174108,4,B000N2HD5U,What else is there to say. If you're up to 4. You'll buy 5. For the rest. Go back and buy 1 and judge for yourself.,1188259200,,115,3.4615384615384617
8174109,4,B000N2HD5U,"Terra Incognita is the fifth volume of the anime Ergo Proxy.  Throughout their journey, Re-L, Vincent, and Pino have encountered many hardships and had to deal with each others differing motives and desires. All the while traveling towards Vincent's home city of Mosk in order to try and bring back his lost memories. This volume sets the stage for what will most likely be a very revealing Volume 6, but doesn't give you too much info in advance.

Perhaps the most intriguing episode is the first on the disc (Terra Incognita) in which Daedalus and Raul (the Chief of Security) are thrust back into prominent roles that seem to be critical in the stories future evolution. The final episode on the disc (Episode 20) is perhaps the biggest enigma however as motives, desires, and dreams had by Vincent and Re-L become entangled in a way that can be very tough to follow. In a way similar to the episode on the previous volume involving the Dopplegangers, there is a lot of jumping around and while the finer details can be a bit tough to follow, the basic point is still made well and provides a great cliffhanger before the next volume.

There is one other similarity to the previous volume that volume 5 has. The fact that the third episode on it seems rather out of place. Whereas the game show episode from volume 4 gave you a lot of insight and backstory into the domed cities and the worlds decaying, this episode really gives no new insight into the story plot. It truly does feel like it is just a filler. It surrounds Pino alone in a city called Smile Land which is run by a hand sketched animator (who looks a lot like Walt Disney) named Will B. Good, or The Creator as he likes to call himself. I put a lot of thought into the purpose of the episode and it really serves no direct purpose into the story of Re-L, Vincent, and even Pino. If you can find one, please leave me a comment, I'd love to hear some ideas.

Overall, volume 5 sets the stage for what should be a revealing volume 6 (which may even be the last one since most anime are around 24-26 episodes). While there wasn't a whole lot of information directly revealed, there is a lot that can be inferred and hypothesized from this disc. In the end, that works out to be one of the strengths of the volume because it really does make you want to see how everything plays out. In the end it is quite good and continues the series outstanding production quality and story.",1185062400,3,2442,4.432071269487751
