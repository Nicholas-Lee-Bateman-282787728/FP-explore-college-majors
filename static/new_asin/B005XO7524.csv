4903412,5,B005XO7524,"This series is just fancy flash cards with a little animation, however the rote memorization WORKS!  Maybe it's because these DVDs are pretty much the only TV my 2 year old twins have ever watched, I'm not sure, but they LOVE these DVDs.  My kids are 25 months old and can recognize all their letters (upper and lower), can sing the ABC song, recognize all their colors, as well as numbers and shapes (those are the only dvds we've tackled in the last 6 months; like I said, they don't watch it often).  They get very into the characters -- they love ""singing"" Yellow like the character, doing karate moves like the letter K, and blowing kisses like the letter L.  I've been working with them forever on their numbers and counting, but with only some progress.  After watching Meet the Numbers just two times they can count to ten AND actually count items (up to 10).  The only thing I can think to improve upon is that the language choices are spanish and english -- I wish they had it in French, too.",1328313600,3,1002,4.418478260869565
4903413,5,B005XO7524,"My daughter was 16 months old when we purchased the DVDs  (letters, numbers, shapes, colors and the sight words 1, 2 3) at that time.  It's amazing what she can do and able to recognize them wherever we go. The Meet the Sight words 1, 2 and 3 DVD's are AMAZINGLY done that she's able to read them if you give her a book to read (she's not even 3 yet). She's into phonics (blends and digraphs) at the moment and hoping that my 11 months old son would do the same thing :). He started saying some of the letters already! I would definitely recommend this product. It's CLEVERLY DONE!!!",1328054400,2,583,4.243243243243243

4903416,4,B005XO7524,The only thing I did like was that the letters video shows an uppercase and lower case and the typewriter looking letter. So kods super young are learning 3 a's and I imagine that can be confusing. Love the rest of it.,1525910400,,218,4.214285714285714

They were amazed at her level when she started.  She still to this day reads grades above her level and I attest it to this series.

She likes it so much that if she wakes up in the middle of the night we're able to put it on to occupy her for us to get another hour of sleep!

She is not talking as early as her siblings, so I knew she needed something that would have her sound out letters in order to form together words. So we popped the video into the DVD player and she was instantly into watching it. It started off with showing the ""A"" and saying the letter. My granddaughter immediately yelled out ""A"". She stayed with it through the whole video of the alphabet sounding off the letters. She was so happy to have something that helped her to form the sound of the letter. I bet she will be speaking more words and sentences in a short amount of time. My daughter gave me a high five as we were so happy that it was teaching her to form the sound. If she has trouble with forming the sound, I would place her hand to my mouth so she could get a feel of how to form it. We are very happy with the purchase.",1514246400,4,1277,5.65625

4903459,5,B005XO7524,"I can not recommend this Preschool Prep video series enough. We purchased these videos last year on a recommendation from a friend. We started playing these videos in the background for our 18 month old foster son while he was playing, eating or doing other activities. He is a very high energy child that has a very short attention span. Even though he did not seem to be paying attention to the videos most of the time we soon noticed a significant increase in letter, number, color and shape recognition within just a couple of months.
He now knows all of his letters (upper and lower case), numbers, colors, shapes,  the letter sounds and phonics. He also knows all of the sight words that Preschool prep teaches on their videos. I have been so impressed with how well these videos have worked for our child that I have gifted it to mulitiple friends for their children. We actually have several of our bilingual friends that have used this series for the Spanish version of learning their letters, numbers, shapes and colors.
 I also just purchased the Preschool Prep Math series. So far he has not been as interested in those videos but I know that his interests change all the time depending on his maturity level and understanding. I am planning on randomly introducing them until I see that he has an increased interest in mathematics.
For $40 you cant beat the price for all of the amazing foundational pre-K information this gives to your child.
By far the best money we have spent for our soon to be adopted son.",1512086400,2,1524,4.619926199261992

I only ever did one video per day, but always sat with him and said the sounds, letter names, colors, etc with him and gave examples. By 18 months old, he knew all of his letter sounds and letter names! This program is incredible! My daughter is almost 14 months, and already knows the sounds for s, t, k, p, and some others!

4903477,5,B005XO7524,This is an excellent learning tool. I have three toddlers at home. Two year old twins and s three year old. I put a dvd in the car and each morning on our way to daycare they watch during the 20 minute drive. We started with colors then shapes then numbers then letters. After thru have it down we start something new. We have just started sight words. I also have the apps on my phone and iPad and we practice during the evening and they love it. The daycare has said they are well ahead of many of the other toddlers especially my girls who are two. This system really works and it's great to have the apps with the same images and themes.,1509494400,,641,4.136
4903478,4,B005XO7524,"These DVD's have my 3yo identifying letters of the alphabet and independently sounding out the phonetic beginning of words. The animation and story lines are extremely simple - so simple I thought they wouldn't keep his attention. But they do. And the repetition of each sound is good.  However, having taught my first 5 children to read, there are a few small drawbacks I feel;

1. The uppercase letter is introduced with the lower case letter which I believe is confusing when first learning to read.

2. Similarly, both the hard and soft sounds are introduced at the same time, which I believe is also confusing for the child. For instance, my son will identify the letter 'C' as sssss. Which is fine for 'cent' and 'celebration' but not for 'cat' and 'came' and 'come' and 'cone' etc. In my experience it is better to teach them that 'C' is for cat at first.

Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend these DVD's to friends and family.",1509408000,2,960,4.5964912280701755

4903480,5,B005XO7524,"Ok I'm reviewing after having this a couple weeks because I only see the benefits mounting up with future prolonged use. My son is 17 months old and doesn't like to talk much other than a few signs and a few words. I have only started him on the Meet The Letters and Colors DVD, usually once a day of one or the other because I like to severely limit screen time. Within the first week he was saying around 6 of the letters. He started noticing letters on things around the house and on my shirt. He started going up to every letter/word and saying ""what's this?"" I'd try to get him to say the letter and then he'd say it and use a different word like he gets that the letter is for words. They show a mountain for the letter M so I was saying ""M, Mountain"" and he's repeat back ""M, Mama"" or ""N, Nana"" all on his own. This week he has also started saying words more. I'm thinking because he's been focusing on the letters.

One complaint so far is that there is a vowel song that follows the alphabet on the Meet The Letters DVD, yet you can't go straight to it from the menu. You have to watch it all the way through again. I think this was an oversight because on the Colors DVD they have the extra songs accessible through the menu screen.  I don't know if any of the other DVDs have the same issue as we've only seen the Colors and Letters DVD so far.

Overall a great purchase and highly recommend this product. We're considering homeschooling and while I've been anxious about teaching him how to read and all the basics I'm feeling less apprehensive because of how easily he's grasping stuff on his own from just watching this DVD a few times.",1509321600,9,1650,4.215189873417722

It was far better than plopping them in front of spongbob. Now, on the other hand, it was very repetitive, which is great for children, but annoying for adults.

At 2.5 years, she's very verbal, knows all of the basic colors, can say a few colors in Spanish, can count up to ten solidly but counts up to 20 on occasion, knew all of the upper case letters at 2 years old and has many of the lower case ones down, knows all of her shapes and ""octagon"" was one of her first words (and could correctly identify a stop sign and a window in a nearby church as octagons), and is now working on the sounds that letters make.

These videos have made learning just that. My boys still watch them here and there they are 11,8,6 but now on the Spanish setting. I love that they are now starting to pick up a language that I would not normally be able to teach them. preschool prep also now offers a math set of movies which are also just as great as this set.

But it teaches the way kids learn, through repetition. The upper level ones: phonics, digraphs, sight words, are much less painful and teach in a variety of ways.

Bottom line: they work. They teach the way kids learn and they keep the kids interested. My kids have enjoyed these and have noticeably benefited from them.",1498694400,9,612,4.464285714285714

The shapes and colors videos we could do without, as they are too simple for my children, but I could see them as being useful if you had younger children just starting to learn the basics.

He never plays on my phone- except for getting a haircut. The shows he watches on tv are clifford and berenstain bears. They are very calm and full lessons...these dvds are calm...not crazy or overstimulating...I think if children are less stimulated when young then they won't be so hard to please...I am hoping that is the case at least.,1498521600,4,503,4.793103448275862

This might be the only gift I buy a brand new baby.  Why?  Because my daughter bought this for her brand new son and it works.  He wasn't even a year old and he was reading!  READING words, not reading books but reading, nonetheless.  At 14 months, we have him on video calling out any letter or number you point to whether it is a Capital letter or a small letter.  The boy can't even speak sentences but he can read out alphabet letters, numbers, and small words.  Let me also mention colors.  He knows his colors!  He may say, ""whack"" instead of black, and he says, ""Purpa"" for purple, but that's more than I knew at 14 months.  He also amazes people when he stands in front of signs and starts calling out the letters or reading short words.

Best of all, the child LOVES these DVD's and it appears he loves learning, too!

NPR had a news story about how active the brain of a newborn is and it's best to get them started early in learning.  We've had these DVD's playing in the background since the grandson was born.

Early learning in life = Success in the rest of your life.

I love this and often get them for gifts to my expecting friends for their children and they all use them and love it.

The best thing is it's not like leapfrog or Sesame Street which all 3 of my kids like. Because there is no other dialogue or entertainment going on. It's strictly learning. It's constantly repeating what they are suppose to be learning that moment. One word, number or color at a time.

The sooner you start your child the better they'll pay attention.  But every child's attention span is different.

We honestly didn't expect much, but figured at least they're educational, so why not? Our son just turned 17 months old, and has watched at least one DVD a day since we got them, and his little face still lights up whenever we put one on. He LOVES them. He can identify and say all the letters, sight words, and numbers, and about 90% of the colors. He also has a vocabulary of close to 100 words, which I personally believe is directly related to learning the alphabet so early. He is an incredibly active child (like, seriously, he NEVER stops unless he's sleeping, lol), but these DVDs never cease to focus his attention. I know they recommend viewing in short segments, but we've never had to do that because of how into them he is. He can easily sit and watch an entire DVD (or two), without ever getting bored or distracted. The series is worth it's weight in gold for that reason alone, as it helps us get things done around the house, or grab a few minutes of much-needed downtime from chasing him around all day.

My oldest daughter learned so well by me sitting down with her and writing each out.  These dvds prob wouldnt phase her.  If your child  is a visual learner, it's a great way to do it.

I absolutely love these videos and so does my son. He loves to learn new things, so he stands and claps and interacts whenever I put his preschool prep videos on.

I really like that they stick to mostly colorful characters which easily hold a child's attention. The videos are great reinforcements for the at home learning setup also. My son who is 14 months now is very good with recognizing the first 7 letters of the alphabet as well as a few other letters, their respective phonics and words that correspond with those letters. Since we alternate between the basic videos every week he does not see the same movie every day even though we practice the skills, so in my eyes, that is awesome progress. Currently we are watching the meet the colors video and he is learning new words rapidly (his favorites being blue and purple lol). These videos are definitely a gem and I'd recommend them to any parent, whether for using them as supplementary material like myself or as an overall at home learning tool. Also there is a bonus to the meet the letters, shapes, colors and numbers... They all come with the Spanish version also, on the same DVD! Yay for bilingual babies and children!!!",1456358400,3,1404,4.484375

4903666,5,B005XO7524,"Amazeballs.  Just buy this. As a former teacher, I was looking for something that just gave a very repetitive practice of letters and sounds (yet engaging).  This is exactly the tool for that. He does have a few toys and books that reinforce concepts; but I showed my 2 1/2 year-old the letters video about six or seven times before he knew the whole alphabet- uppercase and lowercase.  And we are not  extraordinarily, intellectually gifted people or anything lol!

 My opinion on the people who review it and say it is boring: that's not totally untrue. It's a little monotonous, yeah. But your child's interest in this product will depend on two things:  whether or not your child is even interested in learning the alphabet or not (most important),  and how much other kind of noneducational TV shows they watch during the day.  This TV show would definitely seem boring compared to superhero shows obviously,  as there is no plot. My suggestion: buy it anyway and show it to them five minutes at a time if they aren't too interested. Or wait until they are interested, better yet!! No need to cram it down their throats!;) I totally support early literacy education, but we have to remember to let them be kids too, right?:)  I think this product lets them do both.",1452816000,2,1270,4.675675675675675

This is not the most entertaining animation ur going to see... There's no story line like the cartoons on Disney Channel and nickelodeon...or the leap frog dvd. BUT... The key to this DVD is repetition.  I started my daughter on this at 6 months old by just playing it over and over again.  She is 20 months old now and knows her colors, shapes,  all her letters and how to count to 20. She's learning her sight words now and catching on quick. The trick is not giving up and being consistent.  I play this DVD everyday in the morning and put it on repeat.  I leave it on for a couple hours and even though my daughter might be off playing with her toys after the first 30 minutes... she still hears it in the background and looks up and at it every now and then while playing. Next thing you know your child is looking up at the TV calling out numbers and letters all by his or herself. Yes... Its boring but who cares if your child will learn from it.  I don't really recommend starting your child at 3 years old with this DVD though.",1450310400,6,1152,4.228310502283105

4903689,5,B005XO7524,"Yes- my twin boys were reading by 2 years old - thanks to preschool prep. I started playing the disks when they were 6 months old - while they were chilling in their bouncy... I really didn't do much else other than phonics videos and reading stories to them at bedtime (both parents work full time)

So you can imagine our pediatrician's shock when Quinn read phonetically her medical chart, and then a book about Cookie Monster.

Now, twins are 5.

Quinn reads at a 3rd grade level - devouring science books, loves physics and all things human body.

Parker reads at a first grade level - and we now know he has mild autism.

And since he can read - he has been able quickly learn and catch up from his delays largely as we have been able to communicate with words ....  and will be attending a mainstream k-8th Catholic school this year.

Take advantage of the time your child is absorbing and not running around.

Once they are mobile - interests change..., you only have the playpen / bouncy time for a small window.

Preschool prep was an excellent tool to give our kids a great phonics foundation.

We used the letters, numbers, shapes and colors DVDs most frequently.",1449187200,,1175,4.5

Began learning sight words at 2yrs, & was reading, yes reading before 3 yrs old! He now can sound out anything & will sit & read for hours. He is at the same or maybe even higher reading level just turning 4yrs as my 2nd grader. It REALLY depends on the kid, some kids will do great with this, some like my older ones will just get there when they are ready. The videos are annoying for adults to hear over and over but every child I've seen loves them. My daughter who wasn't interested much did learn all her sight words through these videos and is usually ahead in her classes; just didn't latch onto it & read as early as my son.

4903698,5,B005XO7524,"This review doesn't cover digraphs and blends.  We were given a set of CD (I believe 7-8) which covered, letters, shapes, numbers, colors, and sight words.  Some kids can start as early as 15 months, but I found that 20 months seemed to be the point where everything kicks in really quickly.  Yes, this is boring for an adult, but you need to consistently show the DVDs to your kids over a span of a few months.  I would start with numbers since there is only 10 of them. I started with the alphabets and it took a little longer, but how cool is it for you to have your one year old point out a letter to you.  For some people, starting at 2 or 3 years of age may be better.  Every kid is different, so you need to make the determination yourself.  Once you learn the letters, numbers, shapes and colors, then move on to sight words and phonics. The sight words are key to reading.  Most toddler and preschool books contain a ton of sight words, so just have your kids read the sight words while you read the rest of it.  Read a lot of books to your kids and they will soon start reading themselves.  This whole process will take a few years, so be patient.  I still pop in some phonics and bending DVDs to help support reading.",1445299200,2,1228,4.182978723404255
4903709,5,B005XO7524,"I'm ordering the whole set based on ""Meet the Colors"". Yes, it is boring. But my 2-year old grandson, who is very curious, active and knows where we keep everything he wants, even if he doesn't know the word for it yet; was absolutely hypnotized by ""Meet the Colors"". Every time he comes to our house, he wants to watch it. Of course you need to understand that the educational philosophy is to help kids develop longer attention spans. Our entertainment media is focused on grabbing people's attention rather than letting them have a moment's thought. My wife, who has a master's degree in education and is an experienced elementary school teacher (who let each child learn at his or her own pace and loved standardized testing as a measure of progress - maybe not the new testing.) approves of these DVDs. I suspect the reason I find it relatively more difficult to teach many millenials how to use MS Access Database Design is because they are raised in a world that doesn't much reward the kind of patience that leads to insight and understanding. They are just not very interested. They would all rather pay some big name company to solve their problems for them so they end up with a staff of five doing a database project that could be done by just one person! All because they can't judge for themselves and figure the boss won't fire them if they hire a famous company, even it screws up. Marketeers rejoice!",1445299200,,1417,4.604743083003952

He knows every letter of the alphabet as well as site words shapes, colors etc.  He does not want to watch anything else (OK maybe an occasional Mickey).  He is now writing many words and can spell several words like his name C-L-A-Y-T-O-N.  My daughter took him this past week to the doctor to get his flu shot and also an exam.  The doctor was amazed by all he could do.  He told my daughter that he only sees one or two children a year that excel like this.  He also told her that he  can probably start kindergarten at 4.

Yes, they repeat the things over and over and over in different voices.
Yes, I would think compared to Mickey Mouse or TMNT they would hate these.
But my kids ask to watch these OVER those shows. (hey, easy win for me!)
My 6 year old recently started having issues in school with writing his letters backwards, so I busted out meet the letters again and bam... his letters are improving after about a week of watching these before bedtime.

At about 6 months he would actually watch the DVDs and it was about 1 hour a day (usually less) when I went back to work these DVDs kept his attention so well they could babysit him while I got ready for work. Now he's at the point at 16 months he can say all the letters and their sounds. He counts to 10 and can say all the sight words. He is so good with his vocabulary that he can pretty much say any word we say (2 syllables ) or less. Our daycare teacher is so impressed with him she has purchased the DVDs for the other kids.

4903739,5,B005XO7524,"I have been having my son watch this since he was about 1. He didn't seem very interested in the beginning since he has a very short attention span. But, I didn't give up. I figured, even if he isn't sitting and watching it, he could still benefit from it as background noise while he played. My son is now 22 months old and has been loving this series over the past couple of months. He now sits and gets lost in it and I even hear him yelling his letters and colors!! He recently started talking and I love that several of his beginner words were colors. We actually were just playing the letters and colors to start. We would alternate the DVD's each day and just let them play on repeat all day. Now that he has been starting to show us that the dvd's are working we have recently introduced shapes and numbers. He's not as into them yet, but I know he will get there. I actually love that when I ask him to go pick out a movie to watch he goes and picks out one of these. I strongley suggest that parents not be so quick to throw these in the ""waste of money"" pile. Give it time. Repetition is key in helping children learn. Just because this seems boring to you doesn't mean it is to them. If your child is used to watching cartoons all the time this is going to throw them for a loop. Also, I suggest to have them start watching these earlier rather than later. Start molding that little brain early on. I also have a 8 month old son who watches these dvd's with his older brother. He loves them as well. I wish I would've started around that age with my older son, but didn't get the series until late. I really urge parents to not give up on this series as well as urge parents to get this. I believe it is worth every penny!!!",1439251200,3,1736,4.108823529411764

This set should be gifted to every new parent when they leave the hospital with their newborn.  My daughter was not allowed any computer devices, phones, or tv until she was 2.  At that point, the tv playing this dvd set was all she was allowed and knew --- and she LOVED it!  By 2.5 years old she knew the entire alphabet and all the sounds of the letters.  Between three to four she learned all the sight words and also learned the phonics and how to read well beyond her age.  Currently she is four and she can read books. Yes books. I'm not referring to the simple Bob books. I'm referring to a sentences filled with something like the following:

1) Working hard is important because it allows parents a way to provide a nice life for kids.
2) It's time for a bath.
3) Do you like to have fun and play hard?
4) What time do you want me to pick you up?
5) How fast can you drive?
6) What time is it?
7) When should we go to grandmas?

Some of the words above are sight words.  Others are not.  I could go on and on about these discs....

Because of these dvds and the phonics training provided (along with the talking letters factory and talking words factory from leap frog) my daughter is absolutely able to take a challenging word, decompose the word into sounds, and figure out what is the word. I am literally amazed and her spoken vocabulary has grown immensely because of these dvds.  They are worth every penny and I want to say thank you to the creators.  PS -- Can you please make something for math for preschoolers?

Finally, be sure to use the flashcards from the menu of the dvd.  It's a way to quickly test your kid to ensure he\she understands the material.  Spend 1 hour per day with your kid using nothing but these dvds and the leap frog word factory, letter factory, and word caper dvds.

4903755,5,B005XO7524,"Dear Preschool Prep Company,
 I have been working on writing a letter to your company for some time now, and finally as my sons first year of school (Pre-K) is coming to an end, I just wanted to let your staff and producers know that I give a very significant amount of credit to your Meet the Letters, Meet the Shapes, Meet the Colors and Meet the Numbers DVD series. Your DVD set has had a profound impact on Jacobs early learning. He was more than prepared when he started Pre-K. In fact he was already reading fluidly could spell, and write his name.
I first introduced your DVD set to him around 15-16 months which is when he first started reading. Jacob gained letter recognition within 1 to 2 weeks. His dad and I were amazed to hear him begin reading by reading names of electronics in our home. At 16 months Jacob read our television brand Samsung, and NetFlix! We were baffled by it initially, but then he just took off from there, and read everything he saw.
Jacob can:
 Decode words
 Knows all his sight words, shapes, colors
 Text message thoughtfully
 Email
 Draft word documents in Microsoft Office
 Can create slides on Power Point
In addition, he has the most inquisitive mind of any child his age I have ever encountered. This year (2015) his teacher Ms. Rhonda Joseph advised me at Parent Teachers conference, that Jacob is on a 5th grade reading level!; and has to get separate instruction from the rest of the class, because he is so advanced.
When people meet Jacob, and stumble across just how bright he is they all ask me what did I do with him? Outside of being the very educationally pro-active Mom that I am, I always credit the foundation of letters, and Jacobs love of reading to your program. I will continue to recommend it because I know how beneficial it has been for our little super star.
It is my hope that you share our story with your constituents and as a tool for any parents who may be on the fence in deciding whether to purchase your product or not.

Please check out the link below to hear Jacob reading in person on YouTube!

Now at 3 years, they are obsessed with them and spelling sight words, making their own diagraphs and blends up with their puzzle letters and can pick out sight words while reading a book.  Both of my kids are RIVETED to the screen and they are opposite temperaments and preferences.  Now, if your child is already watching full movies and more advanced cartoons, then they might think these are boring.

If you start early (around 9-12 months), the kids learn and absorb this information if it's on in the background as they're playing. Now he is always excited to watch these videos and picks which one he wants to watch - sometimes he sits still and makes it through the whole video and sometimes he starts playing and will glance at it occasionally.

He learned all his colors in under a month- so we moved on to the shapes and he devoured those as well!  He has just turned two years old and we have made it through all the Sight Words, which he has completely memorized; we have just started the Phonics DVD's.  My favorite part about this set is that I can let him watch ""TV"" and then we go read a book together and he KNOWS words I've never even taught him.  It's nice to have him beg for something that I don't have to feel so guilty about him watching.  And now that we've started the Phonics DVD's I am even more impressed with the content- it is a perfect step-up approach to reading for young toddlers.  I think he might have been bored, like other reviewers have complained, if we waited until he was three to start the series or let him watch different TV programs that were overstimulating at a young age.

I have found Little Champion Reader DVDs to not only be educational but more entertaining as well.  They teach sight words, phonics, alphabet and more.  My baby loves watching Little Champion Reader and I know that he is learning a lot more than Preschool Prep.

My 18month old can recognize and identify colors,shapes, most numbers (1-10) and some letters. Playing them in the car....and a a few times a week while I do chores has put my daughter ahead of the game when school comes around. Couldn't be more happy with results. Use with my daycare children as well, similar results across the age groups. Sight words help the older that are in school...while teaching recognition to the younger ones.

4903780,5,B005XO7524,"So far, so good.  My 2.5 year old twins don't love it like Dora or Umizoomi, nor should they, it is boring and repetitive just like all the reviews say.  Except babies and toddlers don't learn like we do, they don't have to sit and stare at a screen and take notes because at that age their brains are sponges like none other. Studies have shown they can learn just as much from a video while playing in a room full of toys as they can while staring at the screen.  Repetition is the best way to shove the most knowledge into that sponge. My kids may stare at the letters dancing around on the screen for a minute and then go back to playing then repeat the whole scenario again and again... but they know more now in this short time from these videos than I've been able to force into their heads in the last couple months!  So if you're looking to for something super entertaining for the kids (with familiar characters and plots to keep your mind busy) then turn on Nick Jr. or Disney or another Bubble Guppies DVD and sit back and ignore your kids... but don't blame these videos. Just play one video daily for a week and then quiz your kids before you make assumptions.",1421539200,20,1174,4.274774774774775

Although they seem repetitive parents and adults have to understand that they are kids and the easiest way to learn is with repetitiveness.
My daughter also loves the DVD's and claps when I put them on.

You are a product of your environment and if you show no interest in the DVD's or lack of excitement when you put them on so will your child. So as weird as I may sound, clap, jump up and down, be interactive and show interest and you'll see your kid will too!

We've made it an every morning routine to watch one DVD a few times. Of course she walks away and plays with her toys, but when her favorite color, number or shape come on she gets excited ad comes right back.

I care for my niece's baby three or more days a week.  At age 16 month, I bought this item and play the Letters DVD continuously.  When I forget to turn it on, he reminds me!  At first, I did not think he was paying attention until his favorite ABC Song played at the end and he would watch, dance and clap.  At 18 months, he has recognized and clearly said several letters before they were pronounced for the first time.  Even though you do not realize it, they are paying attention!

My family were amazed that he was asking the question, ""WHY?""  I was too.  Then, I realized, he was saying, ""Y!""  YEAH!!!!",1404604800,2,907,4.359281437125748

I couldn't tell you why my son loves to watch these because honestly they feel like torture for me, but again they are not targeted towards adults, and the clear benefit they have on my son's education far outweighs my feelings.  I discovered this series by running across it on YouTube.  If you want to know if this is the right series for your little one, just take a trip over to YouTube, and start watching some of the sample clips/songs.

Recently, we were visiting with a friend that has a son similar in age to our 22 month old (at the time).  The other boy recognized and could say most of the letters in the alphabet and his numbers as well.  We asked the mom how she did it, and she recommended this DVD set.
We really thought about this, because we don't like the idea of much/any TV for kids or using it in lieu of parenting/teaching.  After reading reviews and doing some research we did decide to buy the set.
We are continually amazed with this.
First of all, the series emphasizes that it should only be used in short spans and not long periods of time.  This timing is built-in to the DVD chapters to help manage it.
Within a week of watching one of these chapters (15-20 min each) about once a day (though we missed a couple of days) our son was saying and recognizing letters.  He was 22 months at the time.
He is now 2 years old, and watches one of these segments most days.  He loves it and is constantly learning.
Now, a few of the DVDs go into more advanced things for Pre-K and Kindergarten, such as phonics, letter combinations, vowels, etc.  We found that our 6 year old daughter who just finished kindergarten occasionally watches these with our son, and what she sees helps to reiterate the things she learned in kindergarten.

We think this was a great purchase.",1372636800,10,1458,4.394052044609666

I really don't mind that she wants to watch ""letter sounds"" before learning the names of the letters in ""meet the letters"", because her Montessori school emphasizes that children learn the sound first anyway (They see a ""c"" and instead of calling it ""c"" make the ""cka"" sound).. works just fine.

Amazing!  Of course, we practice the concepts with toys like alphabet puzzles and we look at signs and numbers when we're out and about as well.  (As a side note, our daughter did not watch any other videos or TV until she was 16 months old.)

At first, I thought my little one would only recognize the specific animated character as the ""letter of the alphabet"" but she is able to translate the concept to different situations (different fonts from different books we read, etc.).  I'd rather her watch this over Baby Einstein DVDs any day!  (We have some of those too but my daughter didn't really like them.)

As other reviewers have stated, these are probably not the best DVDs for an older child who is used to watching other kids' shows that have a lot of fast paced action in them.  However, I think these are great for the 1-3 year old range.

And it has only been about a month! They already knew most of the alphabet, numbers, and shapes, but now seem more confident when telling me which letter, number or shape they see..kind of funny how they prefer to watch these DVDs instead of Mickey Mouse or SpongeBob! Can't be mad about that ;)Even my husband commented on how useful they are since he is from another country and is trying to learn better English...they really do help!

They've demonstrated student growth and achievement with this supplemental device.  This is an exceptional tool for students with special needs.  I was working with a student that had difficulty with identifying alphabet letters.  With additional practice, reinforcement, interventions, and Preschool Prep, she has moved from only recognizing a few letters of the alphabet to recognizing 19/26 alphabet letters.",1366243200,5,576,5.975609756097561

Now she watches then on my way to/from work. These videos seem to calm her- they are mesmerizing. It gives me the peace I need to start or end my day with calmness. I love the educational value in this product & wish I would have purchased it a year ago. If you look on the preschool prep website, you will see how many awards this series has received also.

4903877,5,B005XO7524,"We started my 3 1/2 years old daughter and 1 1/2 years old son on these videos since the Feb. 15, 2012.  Within 3 weeks my daughters knew all her alphabets, by flash cards, out of order.  By 3 1/2 weeks she learned the first 16 sight words.  She learned the second set of sight words a week after that.  And yes the 3rd set of sight words the week after.  I am ashamed to say that my wife and I didn't do much.  This was from grandma showing them the videos 5 days a week.  My daughter cried the first week because she rather watch Dora and Caillou, but through it all she watched the only thing that was on.  After the 2 month we decided to just run the alphabet letters by my son and to our amazement he knew them too.  We then decide to try the sight words and believe it or not he knows a lot of them too.  We can not explain in words how happy we are about this program.  Best program I've ever used and witness the results.  I would pay 500-1000 for it, knowing how well it works. Thanks to the mom and dad and their daughter whom we met on the plane to Hawaii, who introduced the video to us. THANK YOU SO SO MUCH!!!!",1335916800,3,1124,3.9466666666666668

So, I have a 2-year-old and a 10-month-old and in typical mom fashion, I was stressing myself out with mom guilt over whether I was spending enough ""educational"" time with my oldest now.  Sure, he is talking and can operate a DVD player or do a puzzle, but what about those specific things he's supposed to know like colors, counting, etc?  I was doing the best I could but still worried that I wasn't doing ""enough"" when I tried and got interrupted for a nursing session with the baby.

I started the search for some actual, REAL educational DVDs that I could let him watch while I wasn't physically able to sit down and focus with him.  We had tried Sesame Street, Baby Einstein, etc. and I just felt like although those shows were somewhat about learning, they were still 90% just for entertainment.

I read the reviews on this set and took a chance.  All I can say is - WOW.  It's exactly what I wanted.  The videos are simple, but varied enough that it keeps my toddler's attention.  There is REPETITION, which is amazing because they need to hear the word ""yellow"" multiple times in different settings for the meaning to really sink in.  He's not quite 2 1/2, and so far we have only been watching the numbers and colors videos.  He actually enjoys watching them while
I am sitting down to feed his little bro, and he now knows all his colors.  He loves pointing them out to me in a store and looking things up based on color in his books.

We're going to focus on numbers now.  He already is counting 1, 2... and can recognize by sight others like 5 and 10.  My plan is to continue numbers and introduce shapes... then on to letters and sight words!

If you're like me and you stress about your kids getting ahead and being prepared to learn as much as they can, this is a phenomenal set.  I don't want my kids being addicted to TV so we usually only watch it while the babe is sleeping or if mama just needs a dang minute... but it works so well in a short time.

Five stars so far for sure!",1527379200,,2022,4.298941798941799
