2554219,4,B000F7CDY4,"The script and actors of this film were all amazing {considering the fact that most sci-fi thrillers are bad}.

The story begins with the birth of the minotaur its parents the queen of Minos and the bull god. As the beast grew so did its hunger and it killed the prince of Minos. To avoid letting the people knowing what happend they put a tax on the villages surrounding Minos- 8 youths must be sacrificed to the minotaur.

Theo the shephard adn 7 other youths go to Minos Theo only wanting to save his love Ffion finds that she is dead and he must kill the bull.

So the deaths of the movie were graphic except the 2nd death horrible cgi.

If u want to buy this movie make sure you get fullscreen :}",1154649600,4,701,4.208955223880597
2554220,3,B000F7CDY4,"If you know what the greek myth this is loosely based is about, you'll know what this is about. However, the hero Thesus is renamed Theo, and he doesn't get any string, weapons, or help from the Gods. What he does get, however, is flammable gas and a troop of imbiciles who pretty much just stand around shouting waiting for the Minotaur to come kill them.

 The CGI and puppetry used for the monster are pretty good, and the creature gets a good amount of screentime. However, it doesn't show up until the 50 minute point. Up until then, its just people talking about it every once in a while, a rather stupid fist fight, and various other ridiculous-ness.

 The acting is pretty good, but some of the charactars are rather bland. However, there is some unintentional comedy here and the wires holding some one up when their climbing a wall or something are on two occasions clearly visible.

 The DVD features include deleted scenes, trailers, an audio-commentary, and an effects montage.

 Overall, MINOTAUR is worth a weekend rental, but nothing more.",1151712000,3,1055,4.758241758241758
2554221,4,B000F7CDY4,"This film is getting a bad rep. simply because it premiered on the Sci-Fi Channel. Sci-Fi has become notorious for its shlocky $1 million dollar productions and wooden acting, and ""fans"" turn their nose up at anything they offer. Thankfully this isn't one of those films. With a budget of $7 million and high caliber actors (Tony Todd, Tom Hardy, Rutger Hauer, and Ingrid Pitt), and a fairly tight and enjoyable script, this was always intended as a theatrical feature. Unfortunately distributors Lionsgate felt that Americans wouldn't know anything of the Greek myth, and they dumped it on Sci-Fi. Ingrid was very good in her cameo role, but sadly her death scene was cut on the TV broadcast. Hopefully it features somewhere on the DVD. I urge everyone with an interest in Ingrid Pitt, the Minotaur legend, or Greek myths to give the film a try.",1151625600,,846,4.801369863013699
2554222,2,B000F7CDY4,"Minotaur initally grabbed my attention. The movie was set in a remote village, and the characters, setting and acting had me hooked. I really liked the film until the youths were taken away to be sacrificed.

Once at the ""evil kingdom"" and by the minotaur pit, the movie fell apart. The movie became cheesey, with near endless scenes of the evil bad guy sniffing gas from a skull. Yawn. Enough already. Bad acting. Over acting. No care for the characters. Etc.

I thought this movie had a lot of potential with the setting and theme, but sadly it flopped. I've seen worse movies, but that doesn't mean I would recommend Minotaur. If you are looking for something off the shelf that you haven't heard of, but that is good sci-fi, try the Triangle, Firefly or Serenity.

The Scifi has put out many, many quality movies, but sadly this is not one of them. One more comment: one reviewer compared Minotaur to Aliens. That is like comparing the Godfather to Ishtar, Gigli, Battlefield Earth, or Pee Wee's Big Adventure. I encourage you to watch both and judge for yourself.

Total Score (out of 100) = 21

10 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.
3 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?
3 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?
4 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?
1 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?
0 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?",1151366400,3,1559,4.553571428571429

The CGI is just great, it probably amounts up to a big-budget movie. Great job scifi.",1146700800,4,374,4.597014925373134
2554224,3,B000F7CDY4,"Theseus is pretty much a forgotten figure when it comes to Hollywood movies based on Greek mythology. You are more likely to find Theseus in a television series, especially if Hercules is the main character, or in a production of Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream."" There is a 1961 Italian film, ""Teseo contro il minotauro,"" but that is just another forgotten ""sword and sandals"" beefcake film. Theseus is considered the greatest hero in Athenian history and while someday his story will be given the same treatment the Perseus (""Clash of the Titans""), Achilles (""Troy""), Odysseus (""The Odyssey""), and even Jason (""Jason and the Argonauts"") have received, I am here to tell you that ""Minotaur"" is not that film. In the final analysis, this is not so much a bad film as one that is just not good.

First of all, if you were expecting this to be the story of Theseus, the young prince of Athens, who slew the Minotaur in the Labyrinth that Daedalus built for King Minos beneath his palace on the island of Crete, you are going to be sadly mistaken. First time screenwriters Nick Green and Stephen McDool set the story in the Iron Age, which means it smacks more of Robert E. Howard and the Hyborian Age of Conan the Barbarian than it does of the poet Homer and the Golden Age of Greece. So we are talking dark stone rather than white marble, or even the colorful frescoes from the Minoan palace at Knossos. Historically the Iron Age refers to the Dark Ages of Greece, which came after the dominance of the Mycenaeans, which extended beyond the High Minoan period that ended with Knossos being destroyed (specifically, iron tools are in use in Greece after 1050 BCE, while the Mycenaean take over of Knossos was four hundred years earlier).

Instead of Theseus, prince of Athens, we have Theo (Tom Hardy), the son of Cyrnan (Rutger Hauer), the ruler of the mud huts of Thena. Instead of King Minos we have Deucalion (Tony Todd), and instead of Ariadne or Phaedra, we have Raphaella (Michelle Van Der Water), Morna (Maime McCoy), and Didi (Lucy Brown). So, Theo also has a princess of sorts that is willing to betray her people to help him, but he also brings along his own future bride sort just to up the romantic elements on this one. Not that there is any time for that because what happens in this 2005 film is that it is explained that every three years Thena needs to send eight youths to be virgin sacrifices to the Minotaur and the next thing we know Theo and seven others have been captured and dumped into the Labyrinth to die, couple by couple.

This is where ""Minotaur"" clearly becomes a splatter flick. After all, the Minotaur has these giant curved horns and those are obviously perfect weapons for impaling the young men and women who are running around screaming (actually standing still and saying harsh things can find you skewered just as well). This means we are in standard splatter flick territory, with pretty looking young people running around trying not to get killed and failing miserably. The Labyrinth is not really a maze but rather your standard underground cavern system. More importantly, in terms of indicating we are clearly no longer in the realm of classical mythology, the Minotaur is just a monster bull, with big teeth and flayed skin, rather than a man with a bull's head. This despite a prologue running on about how the people wanted their god to be made flesh and had the queen of Minos breed with the deity to give birth to the Minotaur.

Consequently, ""Minotaur"" is so far removed from the mythology that continuing to complain that nothing is right is pointless since the myth of Theseus was reduced to a single sentence and then turned into a series of gory deaths. Instead I want to know how this monster bull keeps sneaking up on his victims. There is also an unnecessary modern touch in having the whole idea of sacrificing young people to the Minotaur be big lie intended to cover up the failure of the Minos government to create an acceptable god (just creating the monster makes the story work without adding political deception into the mix). But even by its own logic, this movie fails because whether the horns go through the body or the body falls on the horns, there are really not that many different ways of impaling young people. Final Note: Ingrid Pitt, who is fondly remembered from several Hammer films (she was the title character in ""Countess Dracula"") as well as being in ""Where Eagles Dare,"" has a brief appearance early on as the soothsayer, and the fact that we do not recognize her is sad on at least two levels.",1145750400,30,4588,4.660493827160494

It's like most of the people in it were being forced to act at gunpoint, and the other half were picked up straight out of high school drama (except, of course, that they were all too old for high school; more on that in a moment). The writing is 100% atrocious. The main characters are a group of ""youths"" taken as a sacrifice from their village to feed the Minotaur, a beast worshipped by the kingdom of the bull. I say ""youths"" because almost all of them appear to be in their mid to late twenties. I'm not completely certain what counts as a ""youth"" in this culture. Tom Hardy, who has proven himself to be a remarkable and wonderful actor, appears to be in this movie under duress. The writing, pacing, and monster design are all disappointing. I only watched it because it was free and I figured it couldn't be THAT bad. I was wrong. I regret all of the life choices that have brought me to this point.

The king, Deucalion, (Tony Todd) decrees eight children must be sacrificed to the minotaur every five years because a prince was killed in the city.  The king's men come and pick the 8.
Theo (Tom Hardy), son of the town's leader, Cyman, (Rutger Hauer) replaces one of the chosen because his girlfriend Didi (Lucy Brown).

The king, who believes himself to be a god also has a thing for his sister, Raphealla (Michelle Van Der Water) and wants her to ""receive his seed"".  He is upset when the sister has the hots for one of the potential sacrifices and spurns his advances.

Raphealla goes down the pit to find Theo and become a potential fodder for the Minotaur.  This displeases her brother greatly.  He also descends to try to find his sister.

2554395,3,B000F7CDY4,"Spoiler Alert/ read amazon's product description to know what the movie is about. Only read my review for the film's pros and cons.
Okay, there are a few pros and cons to this film
Pros:
(1) The costumes, sets (including the maze), and props were very realistic looking/ believable. The audience will not watch this and say ""oh that looks so fake."" Excluding some moments of the CG minotaur.
(2) The acting was done well/ believable for the most part. I can't honestly say that there was one actor that I felt like he/she was acting. Everybody came across realistic enough for such a film (can't blame the actors for the aquard story/pacing).
(3) On some level this movie resembled the bare-bones of the authentic minotaur story (beast in the labrynth, and so on)
(4) There was no sex in this film (I put this in both pros and cons depending on your tastes), however there was a bewitched girls kissing girls scene. Also, hints of insists (the priest/ruler wanted his queen/sister to conceive his child), and so on.

Cons:
(1) Okay, I'll be honest with you, I was expecting to see a half -bull/ half -man minotaur. However, this is not what I got. At the beginning of the movie it is implied (by narrator and maze carvings) that the minotaur was created by the union of a human woman, and a real bull. Even the baby minotaur had the appearance (the little I could see of it) of the legendary half and half creature. However, the adult minotaur looked more like a deformed/ dying / eye-less bull. Also, it moved like a real bull by running on all fours (did not have hands). The adult minotaur did not have any human qualities to it's appearance. Personally, I lost interest in the film the moment I saw the adult minotaur. Initially, I felt the hype of, ""how was the director going to create this legendary half-man half-bull monster?"" However, I was disappointed in the creature's over all design/look ( just a giant/deformed bull). It's not that it wasn't creepy looking, but it was disappointing on some level/ lacked the true minotaur legend charm/flavor.
(2) There was no sex in the film (I put this in both pros and cons depending on your tastes), however there was a bewitched girls kissing girls scene. Also, hints of insists (the priest/ruler wanted his queen/sister to conceive his child), and so on.
(3) The main villain (I believe his name is Tony Todd/ dude who played Candy Man in the Candy Man horror movies) was a little too out there for my taste. Personally, I like the Candy Man actor (He is a good actor), and for the most part, was good in this film. However, the director made him a little too dramatic, so I couldn't take the character seriously. For example, he wore black eyeliner, and at times wore, what looked like a black leather skirt (I know it was not suppose to be a skirt). Also, on his one hand he had long black fingernails. Even some of his dialoug was over the top (especially when he made the occasional  hissing sounds/ raised his long nails up to the sky, while speaking dramatically). In my opinion, this does not make a scary villain.
(4) This movie pulls you in, then spits you out, then pulls you in, and spits you out. It is hard to stay focused/interested in the entire film. The over the top/ ridiculous, ""I'll find my girlfriend,"" love story did not work. Neither did the secondary love story of, ""I always loved you, but you never looked my way.""
(5) Also, if you are a true fan of the original legend of the minotaur, you will be disappointed with this film. The movie, as I had previously written, has the bare-bones of the original minotaur story. The movie's story/ character changes could have worked, if it weren't for, what I feel, were all the cons listed above.

It is an okay film, but nothing amazing, or even scary. At times I got a little creept out, but the creeps didn't last for long. This movie might work for those who want to experience the monster movie/horror genre for the first time (horror virgins). It may be scary for those who are not use to the horror genre, however for the pros, like myself, you won't think twice about this film after it ends.",1405555200,2,4124,4.525469168900805

2554416,2,B000F7CDY4,"For being a 2005 release, this film relies far, far too heavily upon the imagination of the viewer, and is a safe film for anybody to watch in any company unless they are given nightmares by their own conjuring because of how limited the special effects were.  Lame film.  I am unimpressed, and even though I recently viewed this film, I don't recall nudity to qualify an ""R"" rating.  This apparently was unabashedly aimed at preteens, and marketed with a little employment of exaggeration.  The premise is a group of teenage village youths who are thrown into a maze-like dungeon where a Minotaur kills and eats whatever it finds.  Ultimately the palace priest and priestess fight amongst themselves and give the new batch of incoming village youths an opportunity to overthrow the palace and destroy the beast.  The producers had the sets, they had the costumes, and they had a good enough script.  What happened?  Why did I find this movie so lame?  Was it the fact that they might as well have left it PG rated??  I'm not sure.  But I sure would like to see what was cut out by the editor, because there has to be some footage somewhere that might merit watching this film.  I didn't get to see the scrap footage thrown away, so I have to base my 2 stars on what I got to see by watching the released version.  Good grief this movie sucks.  And now you know why there aren't very many reviews of this film.  Most people who bought it, would rather stay silent than admit it.  Too bad they didn't spend money on actresses and actors.  The story might have worked with the right people in it.  It has all the acting ability of porn, but without the porn.",1289260800,2,1656,4.463333333333333
2554417,4,B000F7CDY4,"A city worships the visage of the bull until they decide to birth a living god for themselves. so they take a female and feed her to the desires of their self-made god, and out comes a beast that hungers and that needs. In order to sate their creation, people are forced into the lair of the beast in order to make sure it stays happy and doesn't have to turn to Hot Pockets. It also has a sadism to it, and this is reflected in the chase it gives as it takes its hatred out on the people that come in little chains of food. One person decides to challenge this, however, and enters the maze of the minotaur in order to both find his missing loved one and to slay the beast. And so the horror begins.

First and foremost, if you watched this on television you have negated a lot of the movie. It becomes nothing but a chopped up variant of itself, and it will make you want to turn the channel. Next, forget for a second that there is a legend with a minotaur attached to it and that people know the name of the hero involved. Instead, look at this as a movie that embelishes and rewrites a things that never happened in the first place, and that makes a horrific thing live in a maze and consume people. Then envision the people and their fates and what great theatre that would make. That is how i see the city itself, with the fear it inflicts above reflected in the depths below. After that is done, imagine a thing that would be so horrid that you would be willing to take people and feed it whenever it hungers, knowing that it may get out of its maze and that it may come out and hunt yyour people.
The concept is a terrible affair.

While many people thought this movie was horrible, I liked it for a number of reasons. I left the knoowledge of the tales of yore at the doorstep, and I thought about the thing below. It was a horrible thing, too, and it had a stalking tendency that amounted to playing with its food. And why not - it is bigger than the bitten, more terrifying than anything people have ever seen, and it is tightly controlled by the sect that worships it to stay in power. This means that it would have amazing authority and that the name of the beast itself would evoke shutters in children and their older counterparts alike. Love is a strong thing, however, and love sends a person to challenge these assumptions about the thing that will not die. In this he assumes that it was born of man and that it can die as man, and so he enters the maze. And the drama that he saw above becomes a nightmare that he wasn't prepared for below.

If you like B-movies and can overlook certaain things, then this might be your thing. I personally liked it quite a bit and do not understand all the negative reactions to it. I could IF people watched the cut versions, but the thing in the DVD was horrific to me. The writers went with a monster-god, too, and did challenge the old stories with a new tale. Still, it worked for me and it might work for you as well. Just keep an open mind, enjoy the blood and the agony, and think of the place you are entering. It would be terrible and then some, to say the least.",1257552000,8,3129,4.185737976782753

2554420,1,B000F7CDY4,"Upon finishing this movie, 2 questions come to mind:  1)WHY did they bother to make this??  and 2)HOW did the 2 idiots that wrote this moronic screenplay get any employment in the film industry??  For starters, why did they not make this closer to the legend and set it in ancient Greece instead of ""the iron age""?  I mean, ""Theo"" from the village of ""Thena"", sheesh!  I know people today aren't as educated as they should be, but the writers display an absolute contempt for their audience that is unforgiveable.  And did they think we would care about a bunch of annoying, 25 yr old ""teenagers"" who are apparently too mentally challenged to shut the hell up after the first one or two get killed because they wouldn't, well, shut the hell up?  Did they think we were stupid enough to believe that?  Not half as stupid as the writers who couldn't come up with anything better.  And the saddest part is that this flick doesn't even have enough heart to be unintentionally funny.  One would think the director would have fired the writers or at least tried to improve on the script, but, no.  Apparently, the director had also suffered from oxygen deprivation in his youth.

Some have mentioned that this is a bigger budget cut above the typical sci-fi network production.  Unfortunately, though they threw more money at it, they used the same, no-vision incompetents that make all their other pathetic movies, so they might as well have flushed that money down the toilet.  Too bad, because the FX work on the monster was actually pretty decent.  Interesting take on the minotaur, too (instead of a human body with a bull's head, it is a quadruped bull with deformed human-like features).  Saying that this one is better than Sci-Fi's other movies is no compliment at all.  There should be a law that all of their DVDs should be prominently marked as such.  I have never seen even a halfway good movie come out of them.  Not one.  Every Sci-Fi channel movie is some dumbed down, retarded teen-filled mess trying to reach grade B status and failing miserably. WHY do they insist on making more??  I can't find anyone stupid enough to like them.  This movie didn't even make a good beer and chips flick, it was too frustrating.  What a waste of Rutger Hauer, Tony Todd, and Ingrid Pitt.  Rent at your own risk, but don't say you weren't warned.  And don't even think of buying it, if you value your self respect.  Fifteen thumbs down.

Update, jan 2008:  Please read the comments to my review in order to get the perspective of one of the screenwriters of this film.  Upon reading Mr. Green's comments, I was going to delete this review, but I've decided to leave it just so people can read what one of the scriptwriters has to say, and so people can catch a glimpse of how this movie business sadly works all too often.

It's a mystery how anyone could greenlight such a bad, incoherent screenplay. It starts out okay but goes downhill very quickly and after less than half an hour you're just hoping the movie will end soon.

The chieftain (a cameo by Rutger Hauer) is allowed to keep his young son (Tom Hardy) from being chosen because he is next in line for the kingdom, but when son's fiancee is whisked away for sacrifice and he is told by a leper woman (Ingrid Pitt) that she is alive, son decides to sneak in and kill the dreaded beast.  Once taken to Minos, Candyman himself (Tony Todd) appears, snorting gas from some kind of seashell and acting like some kind of god himself.  Needless to say, all of the son's friends and he are dropped in for food for the minotaur and most of the movie is spent with the characters trying to elude the monster, but not smart enough to stop yapping or screaming to avoid it.
