601091,5,6303191967,"This movie was very representative of the scuffling life of jazz musicians. It also shows the bond that musicians form over playing together years and years. The singing by Kathy Baker is actually done by Sue Raney, a wonderful vocalist in LA. Jeff Goldblum's playing ( which looks pretty real)is done by Bob Cooper also a wonderful LA musician and husband of June Christy..both now deceased.) Chuck Findlay was the horn player for Forest Whittaker's character, alive and well and blowing hard in LA. Jack Sheldon still plays many nights a week in LA and he plays Norman in this movie. It has captured the rhythm of
this life in a way that many other films have not and Lennie Niehaus big band charts are superb. They also allow the musicians to play so you feel the music as much as track the story. All this great music is still being played in LA, New York, Chicago, whereever, people just need to get out and support it and the musicians that are making it happen.
Highly recommend this for jazz fans and those just curious about what it takes.",1262390400,4,1048,4.550264550264551
601092,5,6303191967,"One of my favorites because it feels authentic and the ending has a nice twist. The film is not only about the jazz scene and the obsessive creative urge, but about friendship. Recommened by this jazz musician. I'd love to see this released on DVD... I'd buy it in a heartbeat. Excellent performances by Goldblum and Whitaker!",1180310400,,326,4.7368421052631575
601093,5,6303191967,"Life is lush. You're born... You play... You eat... You play... You drink... You play some more... then you die. What else is there. Enjoy the New York jazz scene. Enjoy the fine performances by Goldblum, Whittaker, and Kathy Baker. Mostly just enjoy the music; That's what this whole ball of wax is about. The End.",1115856000,5,315,4.642857142857143
601094,3,6303191967,"It was a little too kenny g-ish and impotent. A sign of the times, I  suppose.  The party was definitely, to me, a poor climax.  I would have  expected a more impromptu gathering where the players played, and there was  a bit more wildness. As is, the movie is, as Goldblum explains to his about  to depart wife, an affirmation, that ""we're hip.""  And in that  sense, it's a bit lame.  Goldblum and Whitaker were both excellent, perhaps  the best acting I've ever seen from either of them. They carry the movie  beyond the somewhat one-dimensional dialogue (yeah, and we'll play!) and  music that was okay, but not as good as the music in Mo Better Blues,  another movie about a trumpeter.  The scene when Goldblum's wife is  supposed to be singing?? Trash. In fact, the wife more often than not,  annoys me.  But the scenes showing the two leads playing their instruments  are great. Furhtermore, Forrest Whitaker had the talent, throughout the  movie, to actually take the film ""to the end.""",961718400,9,993,4.6686046511627906
601095,5,6303191967,"This movie has some great comedy lines, as well as thought-provoking drama.  It focuses on the relationships of Al and Buddy, two musicians, and Al's wife.  I've watched it many times; every time I watch it, I get  something new out of it.  Highly recommended for anyone who likes comedy,  music, New York, or movies about relationships.

Warning:  there are 2 versions on VHS.  One is a 'censored' version, which has the swear words overdubbed, and a few scenes changed or edited.  Not as strong as the original, unedited version.

Update 2014:  Now available on DVD, in the original (uncensored) form.  Made in Korea, and the Korean subtitles play by default, but they are easily turned off.  Great movie.",925776000,11,707,4.840336134453781

7841319,5,6303191967,"You will love this DVD regardless of the type of music you play. But if you are a jazz musicians you will go wild over it.  This DVD captures the life of two NYC jazz musicians who are at the top of their game, and play many gigs throughout the city.  Jeff's character is the playboy musician who is a cynic but is a dear friend to Forest Whittaker's character.  The music in this DVD alone is worth the purchase, the arrangements of the big band.
I highly recommend this DVD, a must have for any musician to include in their library!!

The import arrived in a timely manner through Amazon prime and though the subtitles were at the bottom of the screen, I didn't find them invasive at all.",1387238400,3,690,4.2846153846153845

7841322,5,6303191967,"LUSH LIFE (1993) is a made-for-tv, Showtime, movie I did not know before seeing it on Flix, a Showtime channel, in 2009.  As a longtime jazz fan I was blown away by the music composed, orchestrated and conducted by Lennie Niehaus.  If you too are a jazz fan give it a shot and hope that someday the soundtrack music will appear on CD.
  The film stars Jeff Goldblum (his tenor sax played by Bob Cooper), Forest Whitaker (his trumpet by Chuck Findley), and Kathy Baker, with Tracey Needham, Lois Chiles, Zack Norman, Don Cheadle, and Alex Desert.  The music played: Misterioso (the famous Monk composition); Cherokee (Ray Noble); Walkin' (Richard Carpenter); Up Jumped Spring (Freddie Hubbard, sung by Sue Raney); All the Things You Are (Kern-Hammerstein II, sung by Ernie Andrews); I'm Old-Fashioned (Kern-Mercer, sung by Sue Raney).  Among the musicans is Bill Watrous.",1305590400,6,870,5.006944444444445
