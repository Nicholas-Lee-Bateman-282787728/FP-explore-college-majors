6780872,5,B00P1NG32A,If you are following this series you will want to add this one to you collection. History certainly isn't what I was taught in school. If you love a good mystery get this one....,1421884800,,178,4.264705882352941

6780875,5,B00P1NG32A,loved it,1421366400,,8,3.5
6780876,4,B00P1NG32A,"I rated this only 4 stars instead of 5 as there are several episodes on this DVD (marked ""special"" edition) which are episodes that have information from previous episodes (various seasons). I'm not sure if these are ""rerun"" episodes or they took info from several episodes and made one ""new special"" episode. Anyway, to me (because of that), these are not 12 new episodes (maybe only 6 or 7 new episodes - I lost count). However, if you have never seen Ancient Aliens before then it's good there are some ""repeat"" information (episodes).  (A couple of those have some really interesting information.)

I love Ancient Aliens. They provide ""an"" explanation, not necessarily ""thee"" explanation, and they ask MORE questions. Very interesting. Were the ancients MORE technologically advanced than we are today? (because there are SO MANY things in the ancient world - like buildings & monuments - we can NOT duplicate today)  So how did they do it when they supposedly only had ""primitive"" tools), or did they have ""help"" from ""someplace else""?

This DVD set has 3 DVD's; English Subtitles for the hearing impaired but no extras.",1421280000,24,1125,4.968085106382978

6780906,5,B00P1NG32A,"Love all the Ancient Aliens!  Whilst they do not go deeply enough into their theories and topics they certainly give you enough food for thought and it is then up to you, if your interest is piqued, to go away and research further.  Whilst there are the odd statements made which do not sit easily with me, I keep an open mind and research to see if these anomalies arise in any other areas and what may or may not substantiate them.  Certainly the more I look into ancient civilisations etc., the more it becomes very obvious that we live in a society which is incredibly short sighted and apathetic; we don't seem to question much of what we are told by authority any longer.  Blind acceptance of touted beliefs is not healthy, for anyone, and it really does pay to question, everything!  It is uncomfortable to learn the truth sometimes but I'd rather make my own mind up and listen to those willing to go out on a limb for what they spend their lives researching and uncovering that which is withheld by mainstream history and archaeology.  Just use your common sense and keep an open mind.",1456876800,,1094,4.5

6780908,4,B00P1NG32A,"has finished watching ""Ancient Aliens - Season 6 - Volume 2"" released by History.
""Ancient Aliens"" never disappoints when it comes to a pleasant way to waste about an hour on amusing and nonsensical speculations.  In this second half of the series sixth season, we are told - trying hard to keep a straight face here - that ancient aliens have a connection to insects and are responsible for humanity's love of comic books and superhero movies.  Oh yes, and ancient aliens are actually Reptilians, and are responsible for genetic experimentation among early humans.  Oh yes, aliens may reveal themselves now that the God Particle has been discovered.
Now, I know that all press and television face time is supposed to be good for an academic and/or scientist, but it's a bit mind-boggling to wonder if the scientists who actually give interviews for the hard science sections of ""Ancient Aliens"" really know what they're getting into and letting themselves in for.
""Ancient Aliens"" is definitely NO ""In Search Of,""  Yet ""Ancient Aliens"" is trying to ramp up its game with high powered interactive graphics on the menu bar.
Great Amusing Fun!

6780913,4,B00P1NG32A,"Ancient Aliens season 6 (in two parts) Prometheus Entertainment and A&E Channel  DVD

Between volume 1 and volume 2 of season six, this comprises about 16 full hours of listening to wacky theories.  Will these ancient aliens NEVER go away?  And why do I keep watching it?

Well, first its in my nature to be interested in the curious and bizarre, sort of apart from the question of whether or not its true.  Even if I don't believe something, if others do then I cant help but wonder why.  And heres a couple more arguments in defense of the series:  Suppose 99% of the ideas presented are wrong, but 1% are right to some degree.  Even one percent of the ideas, if true, would entail substantial revision to conventional views of the world and history.  Reason 3:  Even if the theories presented are 100% wrong, there are also interesting FACTS presented.  Youll see a lot of scenery youll never get to visit in person, youll learn some obscure details about history that you didn't know before, and see some objects that youll never get the chance to examine in person.  In short, inevitably there is SOME educational value in it.

Yes, the series is in some respects running out of big new ideas.  In season six they re-visit several topics that were already presented in 1 through 5.  However when they do, they usually cover the topic in a little more depth than the first time around.  There are many examples, from the the statues of Easter island to the story of Nicholas Tesla.  Speaking of which, one of the most striking images [to me] the narrator doesnt even comment on.  The narrator is speaking of Teslas experiments in the 1920s and 1930s on death rays [something like particle-plasma beams or controlled lightning bolts] but briefly an image is presented of a front page of the New York Times.  The reason the Times page is presented is an article about Teslas research at the top-left.  ButWHATS THAT on the top right?  Assassination of Archduke Ferdinand on a visit to Sarajevo?  That wasn't the 1920s or 1930s, that was the trigger for World War One!  I had to back-track and freeze-frame.  Sure enough, that was the edition of the NYT announcing Ferdinands assassination, which in the end led to The Great War.  In the very same paper there was also a front-page article about Tesla, a reclusive and eccentric genius of the early 20th century.

In short this series is like caramel corn with nuts.  Logically I know its probably not good for me, but it also happens to be irresistible.  This is too subjective to try to grade.",1445644800,2,2546,4.620535714285714

We own and have watched the entire series and this volume does have about 4 episodes in particular that seem to have material which overlaps heavily with other episodes in earlier volumes. I am also not crazy about the splitting seasons into volumes 1 & 2 to get more $ out of us--think 'Hunger Games'.

I have seen the same parts over and over in the previous shows. 1st show had a few new parts, and then you can see the same over and over in the same show in part 1 of season 6 part 2. They have run out of material and put a new cover on the DVD and took parts from seasons 1 thru 6 (part 1) and cut the film and used tape to make 1 tape (DVD) Do not waste your money.

6780977,5,B00P1NG32A,"Some may call Ancient Aliens far-fetched but no one can accuse it of not being well thought out and entertaining. I find it interesting how the show can take pretty much any subject and somehow tie it in to the ""Ancient Alien Theory"".

Here we have the remaining 12 episodes of Season 6. The episodes are new but between the retreading of themes from past seasons and recycled footage some of the episodes give you a feeling of deju vu. For instance, Aliens & Superheroes is a retread of Aliens, Gods and Heroes from Season 3. It takes old footage and mixes it with some new scenes in order to create a ""new"" episode. I also noticed this practice with some of the episodes in 'In Search Of Aliens: Season One'.

You would think that with all the recycled footage the show uses it would be saving enough money and wouldn't have to resort to splitting up the seasons into two volumes in order to obviously increase profits. The remaining 12 episodes of Season 6 are evenly spread across three dvds and are as follows...

Disc One:
01 The Shamans
02 Aliens and Insects
03 Aliens Breeders
04 Aliens Transports

Disc Two:
05 Mysterious Structures
06 Mysterious Devices
07 Faces of the Gods
08 The Reptilians

Disc Three:
09 The Tesla Experiment
10 The God Particle
11 Alien Encounters
12 Aliens & Superheroes

Video: The episodes are presented in a solid 1:78 anamorphic widescreen transfer.

Audio: The only audio track on this set is English 5.1 Dolby Digital. It is clear sounding and I have no complaints

Subtitles: There are English SDH and Spanish subtitles.

Extras: None",1424649600,19,1574,4.653429602888087

6780981,5,B00P1NG32A,"I am a fan of this series and there is a lot to like about the content of the Season 6 Volume 2 set; however if you already have every season in your library then 4 of the shows on this set will be familiar to you.  I had initially hoped they were re-cut versions of the shows from earlier seasons in a ""What the Bleep Do You Know"" type of format but that does not appear to be the case.  Those 4 seem to be exactly the same as the originals. Once I realized that a few minutes into #'s 4, 5, 6 & 7, I skipped them and haven't gone back to see if their insertion at that point in season 6 adds more to the content of volume 2 or whether they are simply filler.  Since the 3 disc volume 2 is the same price as the 2 disc volume 1 set this is not a concern, merely somewhat disappointing.",1424131200,2,786,3.8098159509202456

6780991,2,B00P1NG32A,"It seems that this series is running out of NEW subjects to cover since a lot of subjects in this volume 6-2 have been featured before with maybe here and there a different commentator giving his/her input on the subject featured. The BLU-RAY editions in my opinion are not much sharper in most cases than previously covered scenes on earlier DVD's, probably because most of it is from older footage that does not have much to give in terms of improvement.  You can not improve much on what is not there so it seems.

I think THE HISTOTY CHANNEL has resorted to MILKING this series, which has started already in previous volumes, and I will probably hold off on giving out more money on this series for awhile till really  something new comes up !.",1423353600,8,748,4.525925925925926
