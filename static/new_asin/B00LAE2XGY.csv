6478597,5,B00LAE2XGY,I've watched this video about 10 times already.  Does this say it?  My favorite is the Ocean section.  I'm waiting for more from Mr. Schwartzberg!,1423612800,,146,4.76
6478598,5,B00LAE2XGY,"Beautiful filming and music. Fills up our WHOLE big HD screen would buy more under this producer, check out on Netflix etc",1422489600,,122,4.590909090909091
6478599,5,B00LAE2XGY,"The first time I watched it on Netflix and I looked at it on Amazon and thought it was priced for just one what a mistake it is for all four.
I do not know how anyone could rate under five star.
I just love it

6478600,5,B00LAE2XGY,"I intend to watch this over and over and over for the rest of my life. I will never tire of it. Absolutely amazing visually and I also really enjoy the music. I believe one can get closer to God by appreciating His work and this definitely does that for me. My wife and I often put this on in the background while we are working on projects and hear the other say ""Holy Cow!"" or ""WOW!!!!"" and we stop and look at the screen to be amazed at the beauty. A lot of the scenes are time lapsed which allows for patterns and movements in nature to be revealed that you could never see with just your eye. Breathtaking. One of my favorite things ever.",1422144000,3,643,4.111111111111111
6478601,4,B00LAE2XGY,Incredible footage. The only flaw I see is that the music could be so much better. But I would buy it again and again.,1419206400,2,118,3.9583333333333335
6478602,5,B00LAE2XGY,"Just like the other guy said, I've waited a long time to find something this awesome. I have seen others like it of course, but this one really shines. Not only are the visuals great, but I couldn't believe my ears! The soundtrack is my most favorite piano player Ludovico Einaudi! I feel like it's too good to be true, except that it is true!",1416873600,2,343,4.292307692307692

6478604,5,B00LAE2XGY,"I have waited a long long time for a piece of cinematography like this.  This is not a movie; it is a glorious piece of visual artistry.  This is of the caliber of David Fortney (Earthscapes, Timeless, Canyonlands) and Jan Nickman (Canyon Dreams, Desert Visions) , but done with high resolution digital imagery.  Simply superb photography, taking full advantage of the medium.  It is relatively simple to shoot pretty pictures of pretty landscapes, but Mr. Schwartzberg does it with style, beautifully rich colors, and an eye for composing the scene that leaves the viewer mesmerized.  You probably know Mr. Schwartzberg's work from previous offerings and didn't even know it; he filmed Wings of Life for DisneyNature. He also released an early work called Chasing the Light, which was also excellent, but these films were getting him warmed up for what he has accomplished here (in my humble opinion).  I have always been partial to desert landscapes, and the scenes in this work are absolutely exceptional. Mr. Schwartzberg has mastered the technique of timelapse photography, which he exploits beautifully in his waterfall scenes.  The price tag for this piece of art will scare some people off, and that is a shame, because the Blu-ray is worth every penny.  Absolutely not to be missed.",1406592000,16,1291,5.056603773584905
6478605,5,B00LAE2XGY,Breathtakingly beautiful!  Music complements visual beauty!  Very relaxing way to connect with nature's stunning beauty!,1498176000,,120,6.933333333333334

6478609,2,B00LAE2XGY,"VERY DISSAPPOINTED I BOUGHT THIS VIDEO AS A GIFT, BASED ON THE ""FLOWERS"" VIDEO I SAW ON NETFLIX.  BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT I GOT.  THEY CHANGED THE MUSIC TO SOME SYNCRONIZATION AND THE ORIGINAL FULL ORCHESTRATION WAS NOT THERE.  I FEEL LIKE I WASTED ALMOST 27.00 BECAUSE I DID NOT GET WHAT I EXPECTED.  NOT TO SAY THE VIDEO ISNT GOOD, THIS MANS WORK IS AMAZING, IT WAS PERSONAL FOR ME.  I WROTE TO THEM AND ASKED IF I COULD HAVE A VIDEO JUST OF THE FLOWERS ORIGINAL RENDITION AND THEY DIDNT EVEN RESPOND.",1485993600,5,500,4.221052631578948
6478610,4,B00LAE2XGY,"Purchased as a gift for my parents after seeing these on Netflix. As everyone else mentions, the video is wonderful but the music isn't the same as shown on Netflix, which is a real bummer.",1485734400,3,189,4.428571428571429

I HIGHLY recommend this DVD!  A MUST HAVE for everyone's DVD libraryin this very stressful world we live in!",1484352000,,260,5.972972972972973
6478612,2,B00LAE2XGY,"The music on the DVD is NOT....I repeat NOT the same as the score on the Netflix version. For this, I am heartbroken and very disappointed. My husband, who tried to buy me a very meaningful Christmas gift, now feels like he let me down because he didn't know the music was different on the DVD. The scenery is still beautiful, but I am disappointed in the DVD version's music.",1483920000,3,376,4.385714285714286

6478614,5,B00LAE2XGY,"Kind of bummed it comes in a paper case instead of an actual DVD plastic case. Also it's just one disc with all four categories. I really can't complain though, it's beautiful.",1483315200,,176,4.53125
6478615,2,B00LAE2XGY,"I love the videos, discovered them on Netflix and bought a set for my Mother. BUT, the music in the 'Majestic Nature' version is not the same as on Netflix. That was 50% of the reason I loved the videos: I discovered the gorgeous piano music of Ludivoci Einaudi, which was so well suited to the videos. Just be aware as this change of music is not listed anywhere!",1482192000,8,364,4.2898550724637685

6478618,4,B00LAE2XGY,"This film which I first saw on PBS is filled with photographic beauty, time lapse photography which is extremely succesful with the unfolding of flowers, and movement of butterflies, birds, etc.  A musical accompaniment  allows one to truly bathe in this wondrous world of visual gifts.",1470700800,,286,5.195652173913044
6478619,5,B00LAE2XGY,Yeah this is on Netflix and they have more segments than what is on this disc but the resolution and color saturation on this disc makes those unwatchable now. I thought at first the music on Netflix was better but now I think the change of music on this disc was the right choice. It is much more relaxing and fits the visuals better. And FYI this is a burned disc not a commercially produced one. Not a big deal but I feel like that should be up front in the description not a surprise upon delivery. Lovely art and Recommended,1469577600,,529,4.247524752475248
6478620,5,B00LAE2XGY,"I loved this Blu-ray. It was an amazing video journey with scenes that were great eye candy. Very nice, and very relaxing to watch. Highly recommend.",1469491200,,149,4.769230769230769

6478624,5,B00LAE2XGY,"The images in every segment on this blu-Ray are simply magnificent!  So very relaxing, and visually interesting.  The time passed so quickly while I was watching it.  I love all four parts!  This would make an excellent gift for anyone who appreciates nature.  The under water photography in ""Oceans"" is just fabulous, but the caves in ""Deserts"" is equally so.  Highly recommended.  I'm extremely satisfied with this purchase.",1466121600,,426,5.176470588235294
6478625,4,B00LAE2XGY,"It is a beautiful DVD. The only thing I would have liked better, is if the timing of the changing scenes would have been a little slower. It seemed that the scenes moved too fast  to be really  serene.",1464307200,,201,4.128205128205129
6478626,5,B00LAE2XGY,"These are the best nature films I have every seen! The photography is a masterpiece of nature's beauty! I have seen them on Netflix many
times and felt relaxed and serene while watching them.  Sometimes, there would be technical problems with Netflix so I had to have these
films for my own to watch anytime without disruption!  The music is different than on Netflix, which was a perfect match of nature and music.
However, after watching the DVD several times, I also like this music as well.  This DVD is good for relaxation and can also help to gently
fall asleep.  I want to thank Louie Schwartzberg for these magnificent films!  A serene escape from a hectic world!",1463529600,2,671,4.6525423728813555
6478627,5,B00LAE2XGY,"Bought this DVD as I found the individual movies on netflix and they are a perfect calming and relaxing thing to help wind me and the kids down before bed. My daughter watches the ocean one in her room to fall asleep to every night and we were having issues with our internet and could not  get our netflix to work! And we went 3 very sleepless nights as this really is part of her routine now. So I was thrilled to find a Dvd and ordered it right away! And since we recieved it life couldn't be better!! I now have the option to play the oceans on repeat where on netflix it ends and does not continue into anything. I also can bring it with me when we are out of town and do not have to worry if hotels or relatives have reliable internet. The dvd is working great and I have had no issues with skipping or freezing. Great Dvd for relaxing, I dimmed down all the lights and backlights on her tv so it works great to keep her calm and in bed with the background music and the gentle waves to lull her into sleep. The other 3 have the tendencies to be a bit brighter on the screen but we still watch these if we are just wanting to have the tv on but no obnoxious movies or tv shows. I also turn this on when doing my yoga practices and it really truly lets you get into a relaxed state of mind.  Really a great buy and enjoy every minute of this Dvd.",1458518400,6,1351,3.981549815498155

6478629,5,B00LAE2XGY,"I purchased this DVD after seeing the Flowers title on Netflix. I have a 3 year old Autistic boy with serious sleep issues but when I have this on for him to watch when I put him to bed, he nearly instantly mellows out and can fall asleep. He's absolutly mesmerized by the time lapsed flowers opening and closing. When we're around flowers be they faux or real he'll go up to them and gently open and close their petals... rediculously adorable!!! Bonus that the accompanying musical score doesn't have any harsh tone/pitch transitions as he has some auditory sensory issues. Thank you Mr. Schwartzberg for this visual expression of the beauty you see in nature!!",1458259200,2,663,4.724137931034483

I personally dig the music on the Netflix version better but the disc version is still ok.,1434240000,28,275,4.2075471698113205
