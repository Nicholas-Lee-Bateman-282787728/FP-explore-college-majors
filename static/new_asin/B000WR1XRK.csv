2990423,5,B000WR1XRK,"Every bit of this faux documentary takes itself seriously, leaving you wondering if dragons might be real after all. Don't show it to your gullible friends, they could be very confused.",1358121600,,185,5.0
2990424,4,B000WR1XRK,"Our family watched this program when it first aired on the Discovery Channel and enjoyed it. When a Dragon's World-A Fantasy Made Real, You Too Will Believe was offered for sale we bought a copy. We bought The Best of Discovery Channel Volume 3, Dragons-A Fantasy Made Real not realizing it was the same program/material. One is narrated by Patrick Stewart the other is more like a movie with actors telling the story. Both DVDs are good productions but for the price make sure you want both versons.",1323820800,,500,4.693181818181818
2990425,5,B000WR1XRK,"This story is a lot like the movie THE RED VIOLIN: a modern-day find of a dragon body, that's analyzed, and in the analysis, the entire history of the dragon species--their rise and their fall--is told. It's kind of brilliant. And, in a way, it's beautiful. You believe what you're watching, and you feel a sense of wonder and awe at what might have been. Beautifully narrated by Patrick Stewart and a well-written story that he tells. HIGHLY RECOMMEND to fans of BLADE RUNNER; DUNE; ET.",1279843200,7,487,4.674418604651163
2990426,5,B000WR1XRK,"Should be noted that this and Dragons World, a Fantasy made Real are the same. However this one has more footage at the end. Eventually, I will give one away.",1419465600,,158,4.3
2990427,5,B000WR1XRK,"Wonderful - and just as I remembered it from it's original showing on TV.  If you are at all interested in dragons this is for you.  It's a ""Documentary"" pretending to have discovered dragon fossils, and then proceeds very scientifically, and finally following the last dragon. So sad - you feel like you've really experienced the development of the original dragons' evolution to their demise as a species.  Loved it.  And afterwards a quick overview of the special effects magic used to produce this video.  Interesting.",1412467200,3,522,5.023255813953488
2990428,5,B000WR1XRK,Excellent depiction of the plausibility of the existence of dragons.  I used it in a science class and it was extremely well-received.,1399939200,,134,5.090909090909091
2990429,1,B000WR1XRK,The one you remember was a narrative following a discredited paleontologist through exploring the dragons. THIS IS NOT THAT STORY.,1391472000,2,130,5.55
2990430,5,B000WR1XRK,"A wonderful fantasy about ""what if dragons were real?""  Great graphics and a fine plot based on real science of other species, from the people who designed ""Walking with Dinosaurs"".  Based on an imaginary discovery of dragon fossils. Really fun for the whole family.",1376265600,2,266,5.0227272727272725
2990431,4,B000WR1XRK,"The script and narration was awesome, and someone had a fantastical imagination!  The viewer is given a true sense of what life would have been like, if dragons were part of their world.  It was so realistic that the viewer succumbs to emotions throughout the piece.  Well worth the viewing if you're a dragon lover like me!",1374883200,,324,4.649122807017544
2990432,5,B000WR1XRK,"This is a very well made movie. Very nicely done and the research behind it was impressive especially since there is no physical evidence to utilize. The people making up the how and why made it a very enjoyable experience. Also, it leaves open a very real issue... Humans usually do not draw something they haven't seen. Even cavemen did this. Also, the  fact that so many cultures seperated my great distances and time (no google search avaiable) having a history of a simular creature is very intriguing. It does make your mind wonder.",1362096000,,538,4.723404255319149
2990433,5,B000WR1XRK,"Patrick Stewart narrating a fiction-made-real mocumentary about dragons, in the vein of the ""Walking With..."" series. While it didn't feature as much as content as the Dragon's World: A Fantasy Made Real DVD, it felt more like a real documentary, as the latter had narration by the  lead ""Scientist"" and made his team seem foolish for not taking precautions a find like this would merit. In any case, while this one is harder to find, it was definitely worth the difference in price.",1361232000,,483,4.819277108433735
2990434,5,B000WR1XRK,This is a documentary that explains how dragons could be scientifically possible.  They go into great detail about all the reported features of dragons & how that would be accomplished by physiology.  They describe what organs would make fire-breathing possible & what they would eat to produce the necessary ingredients.  They explain possible causes for extinction and why there have been no fossils found.  They explain their interactions with humans. Very thorough.  Narrated by Patrick Stewart.,1361059200,4,499,5.5131578947368425

8225278,5,B000WR1XRK,"I saw this when it first came out on TV when I was about 17 so when I saw the dvd on here, had to get it. I hadn't seen it advertise back then and happened to run across it about 5 minutes in so I didn't see the beginning. So ... being a gullible young girl, I thought they actually found a dragon which is kind of how they put this together to seem real. I was SO excited I started calling my sister and cousin and best friend. LOL As the show went on and neared the end I kind of caught up to reality and was like aaawwww... but I enjoyed the show none the less and it was great to believe for a while! haha",1522800000,,609,3.7286821705426356

8225281,5,B000WR1XRK,"This is a shorter version of *Dragons World: A Fantasy Made Real*. This focuses more on the animal and less on the scientific investigation, and some of the narration is different also. I have both DVDs and I like them both.  Recommended for those who like dragons.",1476230400,,265,4.638297872340425

8225285,4,B000WR1XRK,I go this for my 8 year old son and he loved it.  It is a great show for anyone who loves dragons.,1445904000,,98,3.260869565217391
8225286,5,B000WR1XRK,"Fantastic original documentary, the kids at my work love it, it captures their imaginations and entertains the adults. Its a little weird that it ends and instantly its a making of without warning but i cant recommend this more!",1424304000,,228,4.871794871794871
8225287,3,B000WR1XRK,"I guess I misread the description because I was hoping for a more historical approach to the idea of dragons.  In that way, I was disappointed.  However, it was cute and entertaining enough to hold my 9 year old, dragon made child.  Complete fantasy.  Reminded me a bit of the Werner Herzog Loch Ness movie I saw years ago.  I am glad I bought it used because it isn't worth a large sticker price.  I received mine as a gift from my father.",1420848000,,440,4.240963855421687
