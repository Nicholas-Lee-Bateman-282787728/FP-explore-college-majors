7937349,5,B00005BCOP,"If you're looking for a comedy classic with good acting and a few nuggets of truth, this would be a good bet.  Spencer Tracy is delightful as a befuddled, confused, and out-of-his-depth father, trying to survive the announcement, planning, and actual wedding ceremony of his beloved daugher to a man who has taken his place as #1 in her life.  He is a typical 50's father-gruff and at times uncommunicative, but always loving.  Elizabeth Taylor is cast as the naive and passionate daughter, but she is overshadowed by both Tracy and Joan Bennett as his understanding and long-suffering wife.  This is a real tour de force for Tracy and is a delight after all these years.",1070150400,,671,4.758620689655173
7937350,4,B00005BCOP,"FATHER OF THE BRIDE is a comedy mostly about the preparations for a young bride's wedding. Spencer Tracy plays the part of the father. Elizabeth Taylor is the bride and Joan bennett is the mother. The cast also includes Leo G. Carroll, Don Taylor and Billie Burke. Tracy is excellent as the flusterred dad and Elizabeth Taylor is a delightful picture of innocence as the bride. The relationship between father and daughter is the glue which keeps everybody together during the hectic period before the wedding.
The movie received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor (Spencer Tracy) and Best Screenplay ( Francis Goodrich and Albert Hackett). The sequel was called FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND and it was released in 1951.
Vincente Minnelli received an Academy Award for his direction of GIGI in 1958.",1060387200,,807,5.075187969924812
7937351,5,B00005BCOP,"There is a reason that Spencer Tracy was one of Hollywood's most acclaimed actors. He could pull off any role and make it believable. He was one of the great everymen of his day. Watch, for instance, FATHER OF THE BRIDE and you will find yourself thinking of your own father, grandfather, uncle, or perhaps even yourself.
In the film, based off the novel by Edward Streetcar, Tracy plays Stanley Banks, an upper middle class lawyer who has his nerves put to wits ends when he learns nonchalantly over dinner one evening that his only daughter, Kay (Elizabeth Taylor) has just become engaged. His life is turned upside down in a few brief moments, as the simple thing he thought of as love turns into a nightmare called a wedding.  Yet as much as things change, he learns that nothing really changes at all.
This original film version of Streetcar's novel stays true to the source and (as much as I love the remake) in many ways is far more entertaining than the Steve Martin version. The movie has dated some, yet it remains as enduring as ever. Watch it and laugh, maybe cry, then--if you can--give Dad a call.",1032652800,6,1111,4.555
