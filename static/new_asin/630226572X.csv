7823156,1,630226572X,"A trio of mini-TV movies based on short stories by outmoded American writers.  'Kansas' is 'The Wizard of Oz' updated to working class New York in 1939, on the eve of war, with Kyra Sedgewick as an awful wife longing for escape, forcing her boxer husband (Matt Dillon) into a potentially fatal fight.
'Dilemma', paying homage to the 1950s Hollywood melodrama, features Ray Liotta as an advertising executive, having nightmares because of work pressure, alco-wife, fears for his kids, and the possibility that he might have to go fight in Korea.
Mike Figgis' 'Mara' is what you'd expect from a Henry Miller story set in Paris, much talking of talks, little walking of walks.
The first two films are done in the style of glum Masterpiece Theatre (e.g. Eugene O'Neill), with contrived situations and stilted dialogue.  figgis, hampered by poor material, squeezes some of the empathetic visual magic he would perfect in 'One Night Stand'.",984700800,2,934,5.019354838709678
