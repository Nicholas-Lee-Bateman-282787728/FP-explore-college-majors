5857153,4,B00DUX28UO,"These documentary pieces on Nazi Mega Weapons are very well done.  But what's missing is the contrast to the counter-measures taken by the Alllies to defeat them and the Germans, overall.  Not even mentioned is the stupendous American and British effort in the Manhattan Project which produced the greatest scientific and engineering achievement in history.  This is especially noteworthy when one or more of the Nazi Mega Weapons, like the Atlantic Wall, is described as just falling short of what it needed to be for lack of time.  For goodness sake!  If the Nazis had prolonged the war 3 more months, Little Boy and, probably, Fat Man would have landed on Berlin and, possibly, the U-boat pens at Lorient, northern France.  OK, some of the flak towers and pens may have survived, in part, but the German citizens, including Hitler and his henchmen, would all have been fried or received fatal doses of radioactive fallout.  Some may have walked around for a while, dazed and stupefied.  They may even have glowed in the dark.  But not for long.  The Germans, not the Irish or anyone else, are the luckiest race of all.  Three more months and they all might have perished.",1403481600,,1174,4.791044776119403
5857154,5,B00DUX28UO,"As we approach the 70th anniversary of D Day, I wanted to convey to my grandchildren the magnitude of of the invasion and the great adversity that the allies had to overcome on the landing beaches.  The first episode, The Atlantic Wall, explained this extremely well.",1401321600,2,267,4.804347826086956
5857155,5,B00DUX28UO,"I found this DVD to be very informative regarding learning about German submarine bases in France, German missile production, and the German ""wall"" of fortifications in Europe during WWII.  I believe this DVD was very well done, and gained quite a bit of information that I did not know about all three of these topics.  I hope PBS will do further documentary type DVD's in the future regarding German weaponry in WWII, especially regarding the so called German ""wonder weapons"" (secret weapons) of WWII.  Thanks for a great DVD, very well done!",1395619200,13,545,4.9021739130434785
5857156,4,B00DUX28UO,"Overall it was a very informative series about several programs the Nazi regime pursued to improve their chances of winning World War 2.  It also was very dark and disturbing on how they used prisoners to achieve those goals. Two discs with three episodes per disc.  The Atlantic Wall, the construction of coastal defences against Allied invasion.  U-Boat Base,  how Nazi submarine pens were constructed to withstand Allied bombing raids.  V2 Rocket,  the development and deployment of the V2 rocket program.  Super Tanks,  the biggest tank on the battlefield is not always the most effective tank on the battlefield.  Jet Fighter Me262,  the first jet fighter aircraft,  came into the war too late to put the Allies back on the defensive.  Fortress Berlin,  Berlin made into the place where Hitler made his last stand .",1387756800,40,820,4.985185185185185
5857157,4,B00DUX28UO,The program is excellent when it comes to the engineering of various fortifications. This particular episode includes some information about the V2 and the ME 262 jet fighter. It spends some time on the submarine pens constructed in France and the Atlantic wall. I think it falls short of my expectations. When I think of Mega Weapons I think about various projects the Germans and Nazi's had underway or completed.,1467331200,,415,4.942857142857143
5857158,1,B00DUX28UO,"I watched this on Netflix. I can't believe PBS thinks this is scholarly enough to broadcast. It sensationalistic. The reenactments are cartoonish and the German accented voiceovers are hilarious. Hitler is always portrayed as a caricature. It makes Springtime for Hitler look like a serious Broadway drama play. Would rather watch World War II, the Final Days, Hitler and the Nazis, etc.",1440633600,3,387,5.258064516129032
5857159,4,B00DUX28UO,"Very intriguing, Still have the 2nd disc to view.",1431907200,,49,4.555555555555555
5857160,5,B00DUX28UO,Enjoyed it.  Best follow up to the first series.,1431043200,,48,4.333333333333333
5857161,2,B00DUX28UO,"The filming is interesting, but some things are exaggerated to the point of being ridiculous. The episode on the West Wall or what they call the Siegfried Line is poorly done. It seems their talking heads knew little about this fortified line  and the filming including propaganda film of an underground fortress known as Scharnhorst which was not in the West and not even the Scharnhorst of the East Wall.  They claim they had these fantastic subterranean fortress greater than anything else ever built. They seem to have forgotten, or probably did not know about, the unfinished positions of the East Wall and the Maginot Line. For that matter they did not know of the really large forts that were planned and only partially built on the West Wall.  Their experts think they know how the bunkers operated, but apparently their information is not correct in regards to the equipment they included and how it was used.  The segment is riddled with errors and misleading. In addition, they do not seem to realize that the West Wall became part of the West Stellung in 1944 which covered a number of other positions in front and behind it - some not completed.  They probably should have used some 'experts' from the British Fortress Study Group as talking heads instead of a few professors and a soldier who knew little about them.  One other interesting point is they claimed the forts had rotating gun turrets and backed this up with a film clip of a French machine gun turret on a Maginot fort.  As one person commented they tried to show some of the bunkers today which for the most part are overgrown with vegetation and difficult to  to view.  They even mentioned that these bunkers were so strong most of them could not be destroyed, although the German government has been destroying them for years so that some of the ones in less remote and overgrown locations only exist as ruins today. Certainly not an enlightening episode. There are a number of books available on the topic (just try typing German fortifications or West Wall on the Amazon search) including reasonable priced books by Osprey they are of more interest than this video.",1429660800,10,2147,4.75
5857162,3,B00DUX28UO,There is some misinformation about the Bismark. Apparently the makers did not hear about about the Yamato or decided to script the narrative in a sensational way that presents facts detracting the Yamato deliberately.,1429315200,2,217,5.411764705882353
5857163,3,B00DUX28UO,"I've only watched the episode 'Hitler's Megaships'. I was not impressed with that episode. It was mostly about the Bismarck and the Tirpitz. A lot of the show was current day experts in places where the ships had been, i.e. the shipyards where they were built, the canal the Bismarck used to get to the sea, the fjord where the Tirpitz was sunk...it was kind of interesting but these places have been modernized, they don't contribute much to the discussion. There wasn't much discussion of the construction of the ships or details of the battles the ships were in or the ships' capabilities. Some of the technical details of ships were only given in metric. Both metric and English measures would have been nice. Most importantly, in my opinion, was the discussion of the Tirpitz left out the mini-sub attack on the ship by the British. That's a good story and important to the history of the Tirpitz.",1428537600,,902,4.715189873417722
5857164,5,B00DUX28UO,Loved Season 1 and season 2 is just the same. Awesome product. Loved the history lesson. I enjoy seeing the then and now aspect of history and this is a prime example of that reality in perfection. Wonderful programs. Highly recommend.[...],1427673600,,240,4.878048780487805

5857171,5,B00DUX28UO,"The title is misleading.  The series deals mainly with Massive engineering projects, such as the submarine pens on the French coast.",1421625600,2,132,5.285714285714286
5857172,3,B00DUX28UO,"In terms of nuts and bolts of the weapons systems, the series is very interesting.  As history, it's mixed quality.  The V-2 episode interviewed one rather infamous nutty guy who is not respected in the history field at all.  I just watched the V-1 episode in season 2, and it is typical.  There is a lot of good information about how the V-1 worked, but it makes grandiose claims about how original it was, ignoring many earlier cruise missiles as early as 1916 (Sperry, Kettering).  It fails to say anything about the extraordinary anti-aircraft technology that made the V-1 virtually useless -- a 90% kill rate by the time the assault on Antwerp began.  The research is narrow and the series sometimes interviews people with questionable expertise.

The series is fun and interesting, but it also promotes a lasting misconception that the Germans were radically superior.  You could easily have a series about Allied mega weapons -- the proximity fuze, the SCR-584, the M-9 gun director, the B-29, the a-bomb.  It's something of a clich to talk about Nazi engineer as if it were almost magical.",1420675200,13,1097,4.854838709677419
5857173,5,B00DUX28UO,"This is a well-done and interesting documentary series for those interested in looking ""behind the curtain"" at World War 2 and particularly the Third Reich's technological innovation.  I had seen the episodes on PBS and wanted to watch them again as well as have them in my considerable archive of World War 2 programming.  I recommend it to similar-minded folks and to those that have not seen the six-part series on PBS.  It will be time well spent and you won't be disappointed that you purchased it. I learned a lot from watching this series and you probably will too.",1420329600,3,572,4.7

8598077,5,B00DUX28UO,"Great series. If you are a buff on World War II I highly recommend buying Nazi Mega Weapons. We all know how mighty the Germans were during the War, but it hits you even more when watching this series. From the Atlantic Wall, to huge tanks and the V-1 Rocket, it's amazing they lost the war. I've watched all three seasons of this series several times and never get sick of it, as a matter of fact I just become mare fascinated by how mighty the Germans were.",1515888000,,459,4.2272727272727275
8598078,5,B00DUX28UO,I love to learn about history and this will never be in a history book. The people who put this together along with the historians make this program one that I have and do watch over again and again. PBS will always Rock.,1502841600,,221,4.162790697674419
8598079,3,B00DUX28UO,"This would have been a much better series if it was straight documentary instead of ""docu-drama.""  The actors playing Hitler relied entirely on a brush mustache and lots of shouting for their portrayal of the Nazi leader, truly comic performances.  Historical footage was superimposed in brief flashes on flat surfaces in the picture - very annoying.  That said, I DID learn some stuff I didn't know before.  You may enjoy these as long as you don't expect too much.",1495843200,,466,4.860759493670886
