7822295,3,6302181585,"Though ""The Gazebo in the Maze Affair"" and ""The Yukon Affair"" are something like a two part episode, ""The Gazebo in the Maze Affair"" appeared in UNCLE's first season while ""The Yukon Affair"" appeared in UNCLE's second season. If you read on you'll find out why I'm only giving this volume only 3 stars.
Episode 27 ""The Gazebo in the Maze Affair"": A long time ago, Napoleon and Illya stopped the plan of Squire G. Emory Partridge (George Sanders) to control a small country in South America. Now he wants revenge. He kidnaps Illya and lures Napoleon to his manor in Eastsnout. He captures Napoleon and wants to have Napoleon and Illya convince Mr. Waverly come to Eastsnout to try to bring UNCLE down. They refuse though and Partridge, together with his wife Edith (Jeanette Nolan), torture Napoleon and Illya. Peggy Durance (Bonnie Franklin) helps them escape fortunately. The only thing is, the dungeon is right in the center of a maze in which it is filled with all sorts of deadly traps.* Great episode with a great plot. In the second season of UNCLE, they made it so Partridge returned again, in The Yukon Affair. I definitely prefer this first one with Partridge though. The part when Napoleon, Illya, and Peggy are trying to get out of the maze is really exciting, especially with Partridge, his henchman, and a wolf looking for them.
Episode 43 ""The Yukon Affair"": Sqire G. Emory Partridge (George Sanders) has returned and has acquired in Alaska a large quantity of Quadrillenium X, a very heavy metal with high magnetic powers which THRUSH wants. Napoleon and Illya are sent there to try to stop him but are immediately captured by Eskimos, but are saved by the chief's daughter Murphy (Tianne Gabrielle). Partridge and his niece Victoria (Marion Thompson) again capture them though. Will Napoleon and Illya be able to escape and find the cache of Quadrillenium X? * Weak and stupid plot, not very high up in my list of favorite UNCLE episodes.  The scene in the beginning where Illya and Napoleon are in UNCLE headquarters is the best part of the whole episode, the rest is just too silly.",999302400,9,2100,4.7534246575342465
7822296,3,6302181585,This exemplifies the direction the show took from magnificent monochrome to crazy color. It starts out acceptable and ends poorly. Strong to weak. This one makes me hesitant to buy pro tapes.,993081600,,191,5.0
7822297,4,6302181585,"The first episode is another best from the first season of Man from UNCLE. Gazebo in the Maze Affair is about a man, Emery Partridge who lures Illya and Napoleon to his place to have revenge on when UNCLE had foiled one of his plans to control his own country in South America. The second episode is the Yukon affair, where Partridge returns, this time working for THRUSH to obtain a very rare and heavy metal in the Yukon area. Illya and Napoleon are sent to stop his plans. The first episode is lots of fun with lots of Illya, but the Yukon affair, though very funny, has a very weak plot.",985737600,6,591,4.285714285714286
