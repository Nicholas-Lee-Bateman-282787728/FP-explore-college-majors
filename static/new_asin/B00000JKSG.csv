1232945,5,B00000JKSG,"This is the first and the finest of all the Anne movies.  This movie has so much to offer just on its own, though, that it is easy to see why it has become a classic.
First, I want to make clear, despite being over 3 hours long, you won't bored for a second. The beautiful scenery, the superb acting, and the masterful writing keep this movie going--you won't feel as if you have watched a 3 hour plus movie.
Megan Follows stars as the orphan, Anne (spelt with an e) Shirley. She has had a lonely and tumultuous childhood--moving from one orphanage to the next, and one home to another (including the Hammonds--who are quite the type you wouldn't want as parents!), a twist of fate comes when Marilla (Colleen Dewhurst) and Matthew (Richard Farmsworth) Cuthbert, of Green Gables, Avonlea, accidentally adopt her. From there on, Anne's life--as well as every else's, in the provincial Avonlea--is changed.  But, however, I might add, Anne does get herself into plenty of trouble and she has Gilbert Blythe (Johnathan Crombie)--her rival, admirer, and academic equal--to deal with.
I can't say enough about the acting. Every actor or actress does and excellent job portraying their role, and you will like even the characters who despise Anne.  Schyler Grant especially does a good job as Diana Barry, Anne's best friend and kindred spirit.
This film is full of love and many messages but even if you ignore such phrases as ""better smart than pretty"" or ""tomorrow is fresh with no mistakes in it,"" you still have a great film.  There are so many moments, too, that are so touching and others that are so funny, that you may be disappointed--as I usually am--when the 3 hours plus have come to an end. One just never wants it to end, but that is why ANNE OF AVONLEA, the sequel to this, was made.
I will add this--no matter how many times I have seen this--and I watch it quite often--it still seems fresh, funny, and inspiring. (An example is when PBS earlier this summer did basically a Anne-Anne-Anne weekends--even though I own the movies, I still watched it on PBS every weekend, from June to August, and that is quite a bit of Anne watching for anybody!) It is a rare movie that can succeed in not becoming old or passe, and this by far one of the very best of those kinds of rare movies.  So watch the movie and enjoy!",1001203200,14,2322,4.5587529976019185
1232946,5,B00000JKSG,"This movie is awesome. In fact, the whole series (Anne of Green Gables [this one], Anne...The Sequel, and Anne...The Continuing Story) is awesome. Before I get in depth on this particular movie, I'd like to comment on the series in general.
First, all three installments are now available on dvd and, together, they total over 10 hours of pure television magic. I watched all 10 hours in one sitting. Admittedly, I have little self control anyway, but it's got to take something ABSOLUTELY AMAZING for me to keep the dvd player on for that many hours in a row. And this series, as a whole, is exactly that--absolutely amazing. The series was filmed over a period of years, and it's great to see the characters develop and grow older in front of your very eyes. Unlike a lot of Hollywood productions, where characters are recast if the actors who portray them do not wish to reprise their roles, each major character in this series is portrayed by one, and only one, actor or actress (with the exception of Fred, who was but a peripheral character in the second movie, but became a main character in the final installment). The result is a true attachment to the characters, and each successive installment makes you feel like you're revisiting with old friends. I highly recommend getting the set, although each installment is a complete story unto itself. As such, each installment can stand on its own if, for some reason or other, you can't get copies of the complete series.
With regard to this particular movie, Anne of Green Gables is the first of Sullivan's three ""Anne"" movies and, in my opinion, the best. It's well written, beautifully filmed, and convincingly portrayed in both its direction and acting. I can't imagine anybody as Anne besides Megan Follows. The same is true for each of the other characters. This movie, based on a children's story by Lucy Maud Montgomery, is about an orphan struggling to fit into her environment, while at the same time retaining her sense of individuality and without compromising her innate sense of fairness and righteousnous. This is truly an inspiring movie--the kind you'd like your children to watch and hope they love. It brings you back to a nicer, gentler time where kids will be kids and where society is sometimes quirky and inappropriate, but where very little true ""evil"" is exposed. A return to innocence at a time when the world seems to lack it the most. I can't say enough good things about this film. Highly recommended...especially on dvd where you get a bunch of extras. ...Notwithstanding the bonuses on the dvd, however, this movie is worthwile in any format. Please get it, watch it, and love it. This movie deserves its place among the best family movies of all time.",1001203200,6,2740,4.782700421940929
1232947,5,B00000JKSG,"Anne of Green Gables is a classic tale of an orphan becoming a pioneer and role model for young girls and chiildren of all ages. In Anne of Green Gables to Anne: The Continuing Story, we watch Anne get into sticky situations and deal with the issues of love, friendship and careers that will warm your heart. Anne lives in all of us, in our hearts and spirits and will continue to charm generations to come.",999993600,,407,4.368421052631579
1232948,5,B00000JKSG,"I picked up the DVDs for the first two ""Anne of Green Gables"" series after seeing the musical version of the story in Charlottetown. I lucked out because the DVDs have been out less than a month. The actual film, of course, is worth 5 stars all by itself and is a classic adaptation of a beloved novel, so what I want to talk about is why Anne's fans should pick up the DVD version as well. There are cast bios, previews of the other ""Anne"" works by Sullivan films, and some production stills.

However, the chief charms of the DVD version are the following: First, there is Megan Follows' audition for the part of Anne, which is fascinating to see her first attempts at nailing the character of Anne Shirley. You will notice considerably changes in her actual performance, but the raw talent is amply displayed. Second, there are missing scenes, most of which have to do with the wife of Reverend Allen. It seems the production was co-produced by a German company and so there was this extended subplot with Mrs. Allen, played by a German actress, that was fully integrated into the Germany version of ""Anne of Green Gables."" Third, there is Directors Commentary from Kevin Sullivan and the film's editor, although the latter is there mainly to given the director someone to talk to during the almost four hour film. The commentary is certainly fascinating, as we find out where certain scenes were short (mostly around Toronto, but some on Prince Edward Island), when scenes were shot (Megan would have to play Anne at 16 in the morning and 12 in the afternoon), as well as great stories about Colleen Dewhurst leaving a scene about to explode in laughter or adding a line.

However, for all these fascinating tidbits about the production you will find yourself surprised from time to time that Kevin Sullivan often does not have a clue about the story of Anne and why it works. He expresses surprise, for example, that audiences find the scene where Anne thanks Matthew for the dress with puffed sleeves to be so emotional. Sheesh. She is looking at him with absolute love and devotion in her eyes and he says, ""Don't you like it."" Of course it gets to you. But not Sullivan apparently. Still, the commentary is first rate and I thoroughly enjoyed listening to it and using it to track down sites I intend to visit later this week in Toronto (I am going to find THE BRIDGE!). Finally, there are some behinds the scenes clips. Warning, this was a television news story on the production and is not the excellent behind the scenes documentary that aired on PBS. Obviously, my only complaint with this DVD is going to be the exclusion of that documentary, which, I supposed, belonged to PBS and not Sullivan productions. So, I know that most of you reading this not only already have ""Anne of Green Gables"" on videotape, you have had it for a long time. I am just here to tell you that picking up the DVD version as well is worth the additional expenditure.",999043200,466,2957,4.598484848484849
1232949,5,B00000JKSG,"Anne of Green Gables tells a series of events in the life of Anne, an orphan that is sent away from her adoption family after being blamed for the death of an old coot. No matter what she tries to accomplish, it seems she can't do it without a foul up. This movie is around the three hour range in length, but once you've seen it you will understand that time flies when your having fun! After she is dumped at the orphanage, the head mistress hears about an elderly couple that lives on Prince Edward Island in a town called Avonlea. They want to adopt a child and she thinks that Anne would be perfect for them. Anne keeps herself company until she leaves by talking to her reflection, her ""Window Friend"" Katie. After she arrives on P.E.I. she melts the heart of a man named Matthew (Richard Farnsworth), who is to be her new parent. After she jabberboxes on their journey through fields, around the Lake of Shining Waters, and the trail of endless lace (Names that she gives the stretches of landscape they pass) they soon arrive at Green Gables. Once inside, the reluctant Matthew reveals the red headed child to Marrila, his sister. She quickly becomes enraged, ""What is that!"" Then Matthew says, ""It's a girl."" She says ""I can see that...where is the boy?"" He shrugs, ""Was no boy, just her."" That is the setup for the film, and one of the biggest challenges for Anne to overcome: winning Marrila's heart. Also one of the funniest things happens when she tries to dye her hair ""A Beautiful, Raven, Black"" and it ends up green. Anne of Green Gables is the first of a trilogy, and is an adventure to experience; As I have probably a hundred times!  ~S.A.O.S~",997660800,12,1662,4.485148514851486
1232950,5,B00000JKSG,"This drama centers around the life of Anne Shirley from Prince Edward Island and is based on the novels by Lucy Maud Montgomery of the same name.  In this film, we are introduced to Anne and how she comes to live with the Cuthberts (Marilla played by Colleen Dewhurst).  The story starts off with her being a young orphan at age 12 and ends with her being a young lady ready to go off to college.  Anne has many adventures with her 'bossom friend' Diana Barry. A great movie for the whole family as there is no profanity, violence or sex just good wholesome fun.  Enjoy!",996796800,10,570,4.349056603773585

They just never seem to stop working.  DVD's however have a very short life span in this household.  I have replaced more DVD's than I care to count.  I take very good care of DVD's but my kids can't seem to put one away to save their lives.  So....VHS is and will remain the favorite.  We finally had to replace the ones from 20 years ago.  It has been watched at least 100 times and it just finally got so loud with static that I searched out a new one.

1233081,3,B00000JKSG,"There are some problems with this DVD that are endured because this movie is so wonderful.  If you have an HD TV, the picture quality is pretty terrible.  I really don't know what the ""digitally restored"" claim is referring to; I guess it must be a case of false advertisement.  I have watched other DVDs on my blue-ray/HD system that look pretty good despite not being an actual blue-ray disc.  Secondly, I have No Idea why one needs to flip the disc in the middle of the movie.  Maybe other more techie people can explain it, but I think it's just dumb.  I was tempted to get the Blue-Ray version, but after reading such mixed reviews for such an expensive product, I decided to not bother wasting my money.  The same review goes for The Sequel.

My family has enjoyed watching the movie despite the defects.  I was desperate to see it again and did not mind spending a few bucks for a cruddy product.  It's just that some other reviews were so technical and varying in opinion, I really wasn't sure what I would get.",1482624000,2,1019,4.43010752688172

Pretty close to the LMM original book (slight differences, of course), but when I go back and read the book, the scenes here are the ones I picture.  I've watched this film (all 4 hours) dozens of times, and between the scenery, the music, and, of course, the sublime acting, it's a favorite.  Kind of like 'It's a Wonderful Life', but in Canada - that same sense of hope beyond hopelessness, and perserverance in spite of incredible odds.  Inspirational.",1482278400,3,555,4.622448979591836

I had thought it was great back when I first saw it in 1985, and it has most definitely passed the test of time,  with flying colors - the colors of the fluttering Union Jack, accompanied by carrot strands of hair,  blowing vigorously in the Canadian breeze.

Megan Fallows performance as the as the orphan girl Anne was as perfect a piece of acting as I have ever seen. She even succeeded in making her characters faults seem perfect. And adorable.

Likewise the roles of the two veteran troupers Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth - playing the elderly spinster-bachelor brother and sister pair who providentially became Annes adoptive family - were performed expertly, and with real class.

Prince Edward Island is beautifully portrayed by the cinematography.

Victorian-era manners and mores - even more outdated now than they were in 1985 - seem all the more refreshing for that.

If you ever feel the need to see something entertaining which uplifts and makes you feel good about life, Anne of Green Gables is an obvious choice.",1463788800,2,1127,4.894736842105263

1233288,5,B00000JKSG,"Of the Avonlea universe, I had watched the ""Road to Avonlea"" show as a child, but not the renowned ""Anne of Green Gables"" mini-series that gave to Megan Follows and Kevin Sullivan the popularity and respect they've gotten.
So it was last year that I took the chance to look at this series which I had only seen excerpts and photos in books, but not its episodes. And of what I saw on this 2002 DVD, I can definitely say that this movie deserves all the success it got.

Based on the classic novel ""Anne of Green Gables"" novel by L.M. Montgomery, viewers get to see Anne Shirley's departure from a troubling surrogate family in Nova Scotia for an orphanage that would eventually get her adopted into the Cuthberts family who live in a property called ""Green Gables"". Located in Avonlea down on Prince Edward Island, this house becomes the central stage for the many ups and downs that Anne Shirley, Marrilla, and Matthew Cuthbert experience as Anne gets into trouble with Rachel Lynde, Gildert Blythe, and the other villagers of their community. A storyline that spans several years where Anne grows from a twelve year old child to a sixteen year old teenager.

About the story the adaptation is excellent. Indeed, no parts in the movie drag, and even better, the movie takes the time to introduce us to Anne's former life in Nova Scotia as we witness some of the abuse she endured there. Personally, I felt this was an excellent add-on as it allows us to see how Anne's imaginary games are caused by this troubling lifestyle and are an attempt to escape this rough reality. In another note, this adaptation was for Sullivan the chance to improve some plotlines from the original novel, like the relationship between Prissy Andrews and their teacher Mr. Phillips which, as he states in the commentaries, wasn't well developed. Of that storyline, Sullivan presents instead a more realistic and bittersweet ending, but which connects well with Mr. Phillips's original departure during the novel.

Regarding the actors, everyone is perfectly cast, especially Megan Fellows who, due to this role, will always be known to the world as Anne Shirley, though I wish for her the best in her career and lots of roles as inspiring as this one. As for Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth, they both are perfect as Anne's adoptive parents the same way Patricia Hamilton is as the very open Rachel Lynde. On a side note it is interesting to see that some guest actors in this mini-series would end up on the ""Road to Avonlea"" show like Cedric Smith, Jackie Burroughs, Robert Collins, and Lally Cadeau. Why, seeing Sara Polley's mother's name as Casting director is ironic as people working on this movie would end up working for the 80-90's TV show. And to think that Jonathan Crombie just died last April is heartbreaking as he's the perfect Gilbert Blythe and you can tell that his chemistry with Sarah is strong as together their scenes are perfect. So I would like to also take the occasion to offer my condolences to his family and his friends, in this tragic moment for them.

Now about the 2002 DVD copy I have, the image is sharp, but not in widescreen as other versions might offer. And even though not in HD , the colors are sharp, although for a shot where Anne speaks to Diana about some letter she intend to give to Gilbert, several white spots appear in her shot, which is too bad as the movie could have gotten a better transfer on DVD. Of the sound quality, the voices are offered in its original English version, but also in Spanish and French Canadian dubbings. Speaking of that French Canadian dubbing, I encourage it for people who practice or learn French to listen to it as the voices are clear and their acting correspond well to the actors' performances, even enriching it with a vitality that make the scenes more poignant. Why, it is interesting to know that the French Canadian voices for Anne Shirley, Marilla Cuthbert, Rachel Lynde, and Mr. Phillips are the same that participated in the French dubbing of Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki's version of ""Anne of Green Gables""; which creates a wonderful interconnecting irony that many people working on this Anime got involved with Sullivan's movies and series.

Maybe one day I shall buy a sharper version of that movie, but as of now, I'm quite content with this 2002 copy of Anne of Green Gables. A wonderful series that shall be as well remembered as Montgomery's original classic.",1433116800,13,4452,4.731958762886598

I cannot say that the movie is as good as the book (a very rare occurrence for any book-to-film), but it is one of the best film adaptations I have ever had the pleasure of watching. Megan Follows is delightful as Anne! She really brings the character to life. The entire cast is just perfect. Jonathan Crombie, Colleen Dewhurst, and Richard Farnsworth, in particular, are fantastic in their respective roles.

ETA: It looks very likely that it's my DVD player itself that has the issue. Oops! So the DVD is probably fine. Now I feel confident about giving 5 stars.

Also want to add that the acting is PERFECTION. There's really no way they can ever remake this. It's too perfect as is. A shame it can't be HD quality, though.",1430697600,,560,4.3238095238095235

1233313,2,B00000JKSG,"It's the year 2015 and THIS is the version the insane folks at Sullivan Entertainment are peddling?

Absolutely a low quality, bare bones DVD of a modern classic.

No captions available.
No bonus features (other than a commentary)
Picture quality looks like it was transferred from a VHS tape to DVD, then back to VHS, then back to DVD.
The audio is probably the worst I have ever heard on a modern DVD release, not exaggerating. It sounds like ti goes from stereo to mono to stereo in many places.

Cheap cheap cheap - shame on Sullivan for corrupting the delightful world of Anne with this half-hearted money grab.

I, like many others, love the movies (1 and 2 only) and will ""hold our nose and continue to watch them"" since there's no other option.

Kevin Sullivan will have many sins to answer for in the next life, though! A pox on you sir!",1426550400,110,846,4.467532467532467
1233314,5,B00000JKSG,Such a great movie!  One of my all time favorites and it follows the book very well.  There were only a few differences from the book to the movie and they were minor differences that didn't affect the story line at all.,1426464000,,220,4.214285714285714

1233317,1,B00000JKSG,"I love this rendition of Anne of Green Gables.  I watched it multiple times on PBS when I was a kid.  BUT, I hate this recording.  It does not allow for you to select scenes or go back to where you were.  Visually, this recording is not that good--the colors are not very vibrant--they aren't as colorful as my VHS tapes were.  I wish they would reissue a DVD set with the ability to select scenes and with improved color.  I never thought scene selection was that important until I began watching it with my kids and I needed to split up our viewing of the film because we didn't have time to watch it straight through.  Thankfully, my computer remembers where it was when I stopped it last, so that helps.  But, I'd like to be able to go back and easily talk about certain scenes and the differences between the book, but we can't (without me writing down the exact times for the scenes and parts I'd like to go back to and doing a lot of extra work).",1424995200,4,953,4.226519337016574

The character of Anne is absolutely irrepressible and even decades after my own first viewing, there are parts of this movie that still elicit genuine emotion.

Megan Follows was absolutely perfect as Anne, and in my opinion the casting of this show is one of its greatest strengths; the music is memorable, but never obtrusive; the cinematography is done in a manner that evokes the period, as well as the gorgeous landscapes in which the series was shot; and the story is one for the ages.

The series has become popular with most of our extended family.  This is great for kids and adults!  The sequel is excellent as well, but the third series set in WWI is best avoided, alas.

All the actors performed so professionally that it feels like I'm actually part of the story, as if I'm there too. I can never get tired of watching this. It's exactly like real life. Even though it's a drama, there is also a bit of comedy here and there. All the more reason that makes me enjoy it. It's always necessary to have a little bit of extra humour added to it. We've recorded it when it was first broadcasted outside of the US. I love the music and the costumes are also very professionally made. It fits the fasion of the late 1800s perfectly.  It's a brilliant show for all to enjoy.",1379203200,,664,4.228346456692913

1233686,5,B00000JKSG,"I loved this movie as a child.  I have many great memories of watching it with cousins, my siblings and my mother.  I watched it quite a bit as I grew up, so I was a bit nervous to watch it again as an adult as many of the movies that I so loved as a child did not stand the test of time.  A lot of movies that seemed so fun and great when I was younger have turned out to be cheesy, bad effects that I can't look past now that I know better, horrible dialog that I understand more now and quite a few just don't make any sense now that I'm old enough to really understand them and see the details.  This is not the case with Anne of Green Gables.  I think that the main factor was the fact that it's a book adaptation of a timeless tale, so as long as you have an appreciation for the books (and period pieces) it won't let you down.  I think that this is probably one of the best book-to-screen adaptations I've ever seen.

When I was younger I was always so happy that Anne had found a good home, but I hadn't really understood the true horror of her previous situations until I got older.  Yes, even when I was young it seemed awful that in her old homes they made Anne watch the younger kids, but I looked on that as she was forced to babysit and that wasn't all that bad.  Now, as an adult, I can truly see how awful it would have been for her. I understand and know the history of how orphans were treated, as if becoming orphans were their fault and not the fault of poor parenting or tragic circumstances.  And after someone in my life has been so deeply touched by adoption - although it's a lot more difficult these days than just sending word to 'pick up a boy' - I fully understand the meaning of what the Cuthberts did.  After the death of my own father I understand the death of Matthew more deeply and more profoundly now than when I was a child, when it was merely sad.

This movie has truly grown up with me, where I can find new and significant meaning in it in a way that I didn't when I was younger.  That is a test of a truly good film, where you can find the parallels to your own life while also being entertained.

I also enjoy the sequel, Anne of Avonlea, which has also taken on a new meaning for me as an adult.  I would recommend that one as well when watching this one but DO NOT watch the Anne of Green Gables the Continuing Story, the third in the series.  While it was written and directed by the same man, and acted by (mostly) the same people it diverts completely from the plotlines of the books and makes little to no sense as a continuation of the first two films.",1346112000,3,2602,4.042884990253412
1233687,5,B00000JKSG,"I remember asthough it was yesterday, when a friend announced at our church fellowship luncheon that a series for our daughters would be playing that Saturday night (it was in Decembe in Chicago)and all of our daughters would love watching it.  My girls were 11 and 8 at the time, they are now 34 and 29.  We watched it and oh my goodness WE LOVED IT!!!!  My girls just fell in love with Anne (who wouldn't) the constant chatter box that she is!  I also love Marilla and Uncle Mathew!!!! I was looking for a book for my almost 7 year old granddaughter to read and I so happened to run across my beloved Anne of Green Gables!!!  Oh I was just thrilled to know she also will come to  love reading about Anne.

It has been years since I saw the movie and so  I will be odrering 4, for my granddaughters and for my own personal video library as well.  I can't thank Amazon enough for letting me reconnect with my dear sweet Anne of Green Gables again!

Anne is liberated for a girl of her age and time, (the world couldn't handle it then)  and her high spiritness and all the other good stuff!  I remember how things would always go wrong for her or she would get herself into trouble...but things always worked out for her.  I loved the fact that she did win the heart of Marilla (she had won Mathew's heart enroute home from the train station ;) and it is a clean wholesome family watching together movie (there's not to much of that going on these days).

I want them  to read the book first then watch the DVD.  Summer days are long and hot and this is the best time to curl up for them and read.  Buy the DVD and book, it will be the best purchased you could ever make.",1340841600,3,1670,4.16875

1233691,5,B00000JKSG,"I'm one of the few people on earth who did not read about Anne until I was fully adult: about 40 years old, in fact. Don't ask me why I missed it. But when I did finally get around to reading it, I followed it with the rest of the entire series. And I'm sort of doing that here: I have ""The Continuing Story"" for tomorrow. Both were done for Canadian television, and very well done indeed. All the characters looked very much as I imagined them, except the teacher who I had seen as younger and prettier.

No doubt you've all known the story most of your lives. Anne was an orphan with flaming red hair who hated her hair, had a vivid imagination, was rather scatter-brained but very smart.

Apparently in those days, at least in Canada, it was not necessary for people to actually adopt an orphan. They merely took them in, gave them a home, and were allowed to send them back if they didn't do as they were told. Apparently it was mostly to have cheap labor. She was in more than one home mostly to take care of the younger children, and eventually was sent to sister and brother Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert on Prince Edward Island. They had expected to get a boy to help Matthew take care of the farm, but they got Anne instead, and Matthew was content. He was a shy, gentle, wise old thing, very quiet but very attached to Anne from the beginning. Marilla was an old maid sort of old maid, crabby and demanding. But she had a good heart, and agreed with Matthew that they would keep Anne in spite of the error (of her gender) because they could raise her right, instead of the heathenish bringing up she had suffered so far.

Diana Barry, the girl who lived next property over (not very close, because of all the fields and woods in between), becomes her ""bosom friend."" They go to a small country school at Avonlea which includes children of all ages. It seems to be literally a one-room school house, but I'm not certain of that. In any case, it is small. Gilbert Blythe, a handsome boy in the school, earns Anne's long-term enmity for calling her ""carrots,"" a reference to her red hair. She hates her red hair, and therefore takes a long, long time to admit that she likes Gilbert.

There are many incidents, some amusing, some dramatic, and because Anne is Anne, some quite melodramatic. But nobody who reads the book or sees this movie can possibly avoid loving Anne. The girl who plays Anne is just right for the role. She's perky, amusing, sincere, and so very melodramatic about her imagination.

For one thing, it is put on one of those awful double-sided DVDs that are just too easy to scratch. Secondly, the image quality is not great.

At the beginning of the movie, Anne lives in a fantasy world, but who can blame her after all she has been through. She soon outgrows that, but never loses her vivid imagination and flare for words. I grew up in an alcoholic home and lived in a fantasy world for many years, so I understand why Anne would do that. The movie was well acted, the story touching and also funny. It is a wonderful family movie, which I highly recommend. My niece recommended it to me. She and her sisters loved the book and movies (parts one and two), and would even go around talking like Anne.

1233723,5,B00000JKSG,"This 2001 ""Anne of Green Gables"" is the DVD version of the superb 1986 Canadian television adaptation of Lucy Maud Montgomery's beloved novel by Sullivan Entertainment.  It is blessed with terrific casting, excellent production values, and a surprisingly faithful visual translation of the original novel.

Megan Follows is superb as the redhaired Anne, a spirited and imaginative young orphan who comes to live with a middle-aged bachelor farmer and his spinster sister (in spot-on performances by Richard Farnsworth and Colleen Dewhurst).  Jonathan Crombie is entirely credible as Gilbert Blythe, Anne's childhood rival and patient would-be sweetheart.  This three-hour production works in screen appearences by most of the characters from ""Anne of Green Gables"", including Mrs. Rachel Lynde, Diana Barrett, Josie Pye, the teacher Miss Stacey, among others.

Authentic sets and lushly beautiful location shooting in Prince Edward Island and Ontario, Canada, add immensely to the visual appeal of the film.  Green Gables farm itself, Avonlea's one-room schoolhouse, and the White Sands Hotel seem just as described in the novel.

Even die-hard Anne fans should appreciate the remarkably seamless translation of novel to screen.  Inevitably, the storyline has been compressed, and the order of a few events have been changed, but many scenes and whole swaths of dialogue are reproduced.  Some scenes have been redone, but the changes seem faithful to the author's intent.  For example, the episode in which an embarrassed Matthew purchases Anne's first pretty dress is now staged entirely at the store, with the aid of store clerk Alice Lawson.  The priceless closing scene, in which Anne finally acknowledges her friendship with Gilbert, allows the actors to show the feelings implied in the original text.

The ""Anne of Green Gables"" DVD is very highly recommended to fans of the ""Anne-girl"" of all ages.",1278806400,6,1906,5.423728813559322

I had no interest in the ""Anne of Green Gables""subject at all, for crying out loud---but my wife had always loved the books, and one night wanted to catch this production on PBS. Wanting to spend the evening with her no matter what she was doing, I sat through the thing and by the end, it had me hooked. This is very well put together, a classy yet down-home production that makes you feel like you're really in that time period. Sets, music, everything. Great cinematography. And the cast could not be more perfectly chosen: from bit parts to supporting roles to main characters--they make you believe they're real, and the dialogue--especially Anne's---is terrific. Purists will note some differences from the actual book series, but you'll get past that...even if only to watch ""cool as they come"" Richard Farnsworth and ""could-do-no-wrong"" Colleen Dewhurst interact with Megan Follows as Anne. This young actress is the crown jewel of the films---an amazing performance---and all of them deftly handle the clever script. Even though nearly every fan has seriously (and quite accurately !!) denounced the later chapters of this film series, director Kevin Sullivan hit real paydirt with the first two, ""Gables"" and ""Avonlea"".

I ordered two sets and when they got in we immediately opened our set and started watching the entire series again. If anything it was even more fun the second time around.

This is great family fare and a delight to watch by family members of all ages. Megan Follows is convincing as Anne; she was 17 years old when the first movie was made, 19 when The Sequel was made, and 32 when The Continuing Story was made. Her progress as Anne is effective and although the last story was not directly based on the work of Lucy Maud Montgomery, it carries the story of Anne on to a satisfying conclusion.

I can recommend this series with all my heart; in my opinion it ranks right up there with All Creatures Great and Small. Congratulations to Kevin Sullivan for recreating a fascinating world enriched by the presence of Anne Shirley. Supporting roles by Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth are also touchingly well done.

Whether or not you've read the books, this series stands on its own as true joy to watch.

Update 5/25/2010

We have had some friends over for several nights of watching Anne of Green Gables and just finished up the third disc last night. While watching it the question came up as to the make and model of the grand convertible owned by Diana and Fred. I watched the scene where it is driven up in slow motion but was not able to read the writing on the radiator grill although I did get a good look at the hood ornament. That was the help I needed to identify the car as a 1917 Pierce Arrow.

For what's it worth, I love action movies, and killing as much as the next guy.  Yet, one day when I was about 15 years old I was forced to watch this movie and something weird happened.  I liked it, I had watched it many times on VHS, but I like the movies too the point that I just bought the two movies on DVD, and can't wait to re-watch the movies at the age of 27.  I don't know why, but the story is good, it's funny, charming, and just grows on you.  My girlfriend has not yet seen the movies (I am talking of course of ""Anne of Green Gables the sequel"").  She is going to be stunned to learn that I had bought the two DVD's and want to watch it with her.  I mostly fall asleep during the Chick Flicks she makes me watch, but this show is different.

Maybe it's the trouble Anne gets into, or the fact that in the movie men are depicted as MEN, and not what we have become today.  Maybe that's why I like it so much.  Guys, take it from me if you're forced to watch this one day with your sweetheart of wife, it's not a bad way to spend an evening.  Anne of Green Gables is a funny story with many laughs put in, and yet it offers a deep story without violence or explosions.

Sullivan and company used brilliant casting and accurate, lush locations to give us an ""Anne"" that feels right.  Megan Follows beat out thousands of young actresses for the coveted part of Anne Shirley, and Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth were never better than here in the part of brother-sister surrogate parents Marilla and Mathew Cuthbert.

This production swept the Gemini awards that year (Canadian Emmies) with 10 Awards including Best Dramatic Miniseries, Most Popular Program, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor and Actress, Best Writing, Best Music, Costumes, Photography, and Production Design/Art Direction.  It also won the Emmy that year for Best Children's Program.

The Awards barely give you the gist of the enormous outpouring of good will that accompanies a viewing of this program.  The character of Anne, although a downtrodden orphan, is nonetheless feisty and intelligent and determined to make her way in the world.  You can't help but pull for the girl, who begins the movie as slave labor to a hot-headed couple with ten children before being sent back to the orphanage after the husband suffers a heart attack.

The elderly Cuthberts are looking to take in a young boy to help Mathew with work in the fields.  They are instead sent Anne, who charms her way into Mathew's heart in the buggy ride back to Green Gables.  The film hooks the viewer in this sequence and you can't help but want to know what happens next.

Special kudos to Richard Farnsworth, who makes Mathew such an endearing and kind-spirited character that he received many marriage proposals in letters from adoring women despite being nearly seventy.

There are few on-screen moments anywhere more heartwarming than the sequence where Farnsworth goes to the general store to buy Anne a dress with puffed sleeves, then the following scene where Anne tries on said dress.

Anne of Green Gables was followed by an equally excellent sequel: Anne of Avonlea.  Unfortunately, this was followed by a third installment: Anne, the Continuing Story, which was frankly an abomination compared to the first two installments.",1236038400,,3854,6.78498985801217

1233748,5,B00000JKSG,"My wife and I bought the ""100 Aniversary"" book of Anne of Green Gables"" last October when we visited the author's home on Prince Edward's Island. After my wife finally finished it, I picked it up and could not put it down. The movie on this DVD is the same way. It sticks pretty well to the novel and only leaves out some scenes with the pastors wife.

Meghan Follows should get a lifetime achievement award for this unforgettable performance. She is absolutely beguiling in portraying Anne's innocence, intelligence, imagination and goodness. This is a movie you'll watch over and over; children's behavior may change after reading the book or watching this movie, such is the impact of this story. I am a pediatrician and am recommending it for all the girls I see Anne's age. Most have never heard of it tho most moms saw the movie on PBS and loved it.

All of the other characters in the movie, esp her adoptive parents give wonderful performances. Will stop here and offer some quotes from the book/movie:

Anne Shirley: My life is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes. That's a sentence I read once and I say it over to comfort myself in these times that try the soul.

Mrs. Cadbury: Tell me what you know about yourself.
Anne Shirley: Well, it really isn't worth telling, Mrs. Cadbury... but if you let me tell you what I IMAGINE about myself you'd find it a lot more interesting.

Anne Shirley: This is the most tragical thing that has ever happened to me

Anne Shirley: Mrs. Hammond told me that God made my hair red on purpose and I've never cared for Him since.

[Marilla, commenting on whether or not she'll keep Anne]
Marilla Cuthbert: If she can avoid catastrophe two days in a row, I might have a chance to make up my mind.

Anne has just fallen from a roof]
Diana Barry: Just say one word and tell me if you're killed!
Anne Shirley: No... but I think I've been rendered unconscious.

Anne Shirley: Tomorrow is always fresh with no mistakes in it.

1233762,3,B00000JKSG,"Films are amazing because they can literally take any shape, any sound, any form, and any size.  They are the chameleon of entertainment.  As a viewer, you cannot jump into a film with expectations, because due to the circumstances listed above, one may never know the particular outcome.  Films can arrive in forms of made-for-television releases, direct-to-DVD releases, or through mainstream venues.  It is a magical moment beginning a film through the ending - there is a level of unknown as well as random emotions throughout.  ""Anne of Green Gables"" was one of those surprise random moments for me where I didn't know what to expect, but went through a barrage of emotion before arriving to this conclusion.  In film, it may be clich to say ""size does matter"", but with exploding budgets and timelines over 120 minutes, size is becoming a hot commodity in Hollywood.  ""Anne of Green Gables"" is one of those low budget, little screen book adaptations that literally takes every page and puts it in cinematic lights.  Carrying both positive and negative attributes, ""Anne of Green Gables"" takes three hours of your life, puts it in a made-for-TV blender, blends, and forces you to drink the resulting concoction.  How does it taste going down?  Don't worry - that is what I am here for.

""Anne of Green Gables"" begins with Anne's life in an orphanage, living with uncaring foster parents, all the way through her lavish life with her new parents, Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert.  She goes through the struggles of being an independent woman living in a prim and proper world.  Leading us as Anne is Megan Follows, a young girl with a television filled resume, who provides us with the shell of Anne, but not quite the full-body development.  Follows is my first experience with Anne, and since there is little to judge, I must admit she was follow-able, but not quite developed.  The words that she engulfed were charismatic, she defined the role, but when she walked, cried, or ran - she didn't seem to be that same Anne again.  Follows felt like a stage actress trapped in an invisible cinema box.  Either she wasn't allowed the explore all the elements, or she just didn't have to.  This film was your typical made-for-TV movie that didn't need actors escaping their shells because they had picturesque views and longevity on their side.  They were telling a story, not winning awards - and with this film it was obvious.  Don't yell - I did like what Follows did, I just didn't love her performance.  Perhaps a stack rankings of all the others that portrayed Anne would allow Fellows' performance to stand out, but watching this film alone - something just felt missing.  Richard Farnsworth's Matthew was another abandoned character, with no emotion and void of life.  Every time he opened his mouth, nothing of excitement protruded.  Colleen Dewhurst was the clich angry woman, unwilling to change, yet something about Anne eventually brings her to a new understanding of life.  These two were the leading figures around Anne, and working together they provided a good story - but poorly developed characters.  There was minimal emotion surrounding them as they went from scene to scene.  For these actors, it was obviously a job; they allowed the movie to tell the story.

Having never read the story of Anne and her adventures at Green Gables, director Kevin Sullivan should be commended for bringing such a drab story to life.  The adventures of the protagonist Anne includes minimal excitement, the clich drunken friend, the death of a loved one, the adolescent blurts of English - all can be found in other films of this nature like ""Little House on the Prairie"" or any ""After School Special"", but Sullivan did bring some snippets of joy to this story.  He made it long, which allowed us to sink into the environment, believe that it was forced, and yet one can find simple joys in the stagy-ness of it all.  Sullivan's direction was impeccable; he took no risks, created nothing original, and played it by the book.  He allowed the story to grow, but again, there wasn't much story to grow.  Anne stays in one place, runs around everywhere, and grows an iconic challenge with a local boy who is equally as talented (and equally as drab).  I am not a pre-teen girl, I am missing the ""bosom"" friend, and obviously this film wasn't targeted towards my demographic, but it should still entertain.  Anyone who argues that they could sit through such lifeless characters must be first in line to the new Larry the Cable Guy film.  While I am drawing random tangents, my point is the meat was missing from this adventure.  The scenery was fantastic, the pacing was fluent, but our characters could not bring me to a second viewing.  Where was the passion in this film?  Why did Sullivan allow cardboard to grace his screen?

Overall, ""Anne of Green Gables"" was a lengthy film, with cardboard characters, but a plethora of beautiful scenes.  There wasn't much music to talk about, outside of the same three chords played over and over again.  Richard Farnsworth proved yet again that his name filled his resume, while Megan Follows played her part while keeping within her self-proclaimed box.  As a reviewer of films, I want to see progression, development; strong single elements that make each film stand out from the cattle of the rest.  With this film it felt safe, it was a family film that took no risks, it felt like a Styrofoam box on the ocean - you really should take it out, but you worry about getting wet and sea creatures.  ""Anne of Green Gables"" was an 80s film without the pizzazz.  If I had a daughter who wanted to watch this film, I could hope it would help her sleep.  Coupled with the characters, the story is ironically bland, and even the director didn't push for risks.  It was a film.  I was happy when it was over, could never dream about watching it again, yet I can't fault it for anything dramatic.  It wasn't the greatest made-for-TV film, but there is little to complain about.

It was sterile.  It was cardboard.  It was copper.

1233766,3,B00000JKSG,"for me to believe she is a little girl. I adore the story so I watched the series and I love Colleen Dewhurst in anything; however, I could never get lost in the story because Follows is so mature and professional it was more like watching a much older woman doing a screen test than a believable impressionable young girl. Her performance, IMO, was cool, calm and collected and far too old for the character, especially in the beginning of the story. Her emotions seem too contrived, as does her entire performance, and self conscious; she has acting skills but they do not lend themselves to this particular role.
Being 17 at the time was another handicap, as Anne is only eleven years old as  the story opens, and while precocious, she is also wondefully innocent, a charter trait totally missing in Follows' performance. Rather destroyed the mood for me, but I did love the setting on Prince Edward Island, just gorgeous, and the other characters were excellent, except I thought Matthew could have been more emotional/feeling toward Anne.

1233779,5,B00000JKSG,"This great 1985 production gloriously brings the characters from the ""Anne"" series, written by Canadian writer Lucy Maude Montgomery, to life.  I remember well watching (and reading) this story as a small child.  It was magical, then, and it remains so more than twenty years later.  Anne (Megan Follows) is a lively and strong-willed orphan adopted by Marilla (Colleen Dewhurst) and Matthew (Richard Farnsworth) Cuthbert, siblings in need of a helper on their farm.  Originally, they had expected to adopt a boy, but fate has other plans for them.  Anne proves to be just what they needed.  She brings them her youth, indomitable spirit and flare for getting into mischief.  Along the way, Anne meets and befriends neighbor and classmate Diana Berry (Schuyler Grant) and butts heads with ""would be"" suitor Gilbert Blythe (Jonathan Crombie).  Anne's slew of adventures and misadventures are a lot of fun to watch (especially an instance where she attempts to die her red hair auburn--turning it green instead!).

The strength of this wonderful film is in the engaging acting, warm direction from Kevin Sullivan and the luscious photography.  You really feel like you have been transported to Prince Edward Island in Canada, in the early 1900s.  You'll laugh, you'll feel the pangs and poignance of Anne's trials and tribulations and you will absolutely lose yourself in the story.",1188086400,7,1380,5.143497757847534

1233782,5,B00000JKSG,DVD in great shape - enjoyable version of the Anne of Green Gables classic story.,1186272000,,81,4.466666666666667
1233783,5,B00000JKSG,"I remember watching the Anne of Green Gables series when it first showed on American TV, and fell in love with it.  I purchased the VHS versions of this and the sequal and watched them over and over with my mother and my young niece.  Three generations of women in my home enjoyed it trememdously.  About 10 years ago I donated the VHS tapes to the library assuming I had seen it enough, but then decided recently to purchase the DVD.  The quality is really no better than the quality of the VHS versions; however, you forget about it after the first few minutes.

The story of Anne is actually very feminist in nature.  All the main characters are women, with the men being mere scenery.  Even the character of Matthew, with his quiet nature, takes second place to that of Marilla's overbearing, take charge personality.  Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth are perfect in their roles and play magnificantly off  Megan Follow's Anne.

If you've seen Anne several times the commentary adds a new element to the story.  However, I would have liked more commentary on the actors and less on the lighting and scene design.  It lags in many places where the director didn't seem to have anything to say, although it did answer a lot of questions I had about some of the scenes, like the one where Anne is running through the fall trees -- I always thought it didn't fit because she never wore a bright blue dress with a white apron.  Now, I know the seasonal changes were shot the year prior to shooting the miniseries and edited in later.  Some of the commentary left out things I would have liked to have known, such as the scene where Anne finds a mouse in the pudding.  I want to know if they used a real mouse because it was so realistic looking, and if so, how did Megan react to having to scoop it out of the pudding.  Well, instead the director focused on the color of her sweater and the spoon vs. the color of the red wood in the kitchen!  He does express his utmost admiration for the actors in the series, especially that of Colleen Dewhurst (who is the reason I watch this over and over again).  I loved hearing what the director had to say about her personally and wished there were more of that type of commentary instead of how the lighting crew lite one scene after another to reflect the time of day or year.  Lighting, scenery and costuming are all important factors in any film, especially a period piece, and it's important to acknowledge it, but it appeared to hold center stage in the director's commentary on the making of the miniseries.  One thing I would like to note is that regardless of what another reviewer said, Kevin Sullivan does know Anne Shirley and all the other characters, and the story line very well.  He never makes the comment that he doesn't know why a scene worked well, only that the reason the scenes worked were because of the consumate acting ability of the actors involved in the scene.  Kevin Sullivan is the reason this miniseries was, and is, so successful.  It is Sullivan's vision that brought the story to the screen in such a manner that has made it literally a worldwide sensation.

I had some trouble finding the commentary for the first part of the series.  The first 95 minutes is on one side of the disk with the remainder on the flip side.  Side B starts with a menu that gives the choice of languages and the director's commentary.  Side A does not.  After flipping through all the special features and not finding the commentary I finally selected the ""languages"" menu and found it in there.

Whether you've seen this in the past or not, this is one series that is wholesome enough for the entire family and yet quite entertaining as well.",1183766400,5,3705,4.504491017964072

At one point I had them all on VHS that we'd recorded, but I believe one of my sisters took them when they left home, and I only just got around to buying myself a copy on DVD.  And I'm so glad I did, because now I'm sharing my love of this story with MY 9 year old daughter.

The casting is perfect - major and minor characters alike are extremely talented.  It's amazing to see how Megan Follows plays a 13 year old and a 16 year old, sometimes days apart, and is believable every time.  Richard Farnesworth and Colleen Dewherst are magic.

The bonus features are also great - giving you the impression that getting this adaptation so perfect was more luck than craft on Sullivan's part (a perspective proven later when he destroys this ""trilogy"" with the joke that is The Continuing Story""), but provides an interesting commentary and details fans will really enjoy.

Everything about these two adaptations is superb. The acting is incredible. Megan Follows is the perfect Anne Shirley - endearing, fiesty, imaginative, lovable, and utterly confounding. Colleen Dewhurst offers a wonderful portrayal of the stubborn, rigid, and yet compassionate character of Marilla. Richard Farnsworth's Matthew is touching and poignant. Everyone of the supporting characters is equally well-acted and bring the story to life so fully and beautifully.

The cinematography is wonderful and the scenes of the Island and the other places along Anne's journey are really lovely. I was so thrilled when the DVDs finally became available.

1233809,5,B00000JKSG,"An A+ recommendation for families to watch together

I'm glad to have been proven wrong. I came to this movie, thinking it was going to be just old-fashion syrupy goodness ...  idealized emotionalism. I rented this movie for my mom (to surprise her; as I knew she likes this genre - drama -and society), and have never seen her laugh so much at a movie. This movie was a good bonding experience for me and my parents.

This movie is about Anne, a red-haired girl who is orphaned at an early age and faces life's situations with a maturity and also innocence to admire, really. In this movie, I learned a lot about social interactions, character maturity, the beauty of wit, and the social/psychological differences between women and men. The beautiful, down-to-earth, and somehow sublimely wicked character of Anne has been a *therapeutic session* for me. Meditatively, I had sympathized with various emotions, thoughts, schemes from my own childhood, some of them which comprise the brokenness that I carry in this world's life, my brokenness as an imperfect child of God.

The movie, has spectacular cinematography, historical era-clothes, language (lingo sometimes archaic), and culture (I guess 19th century Canada; Victorian era). An A+ recommendation for families to watch together.

For me, a young 30s old male Christ-ian, this movie had been therapeutic (even contemplative or meditative) because of all the prejudices, biases, subjective thought-process, and baggage, that I carry as a human being.  Now I feel lighter, wiser, and will-not-always-take-life-so-seriously. I've enjoyed *observing* not only the character development of Anne but also my parents reactions to Anne's behavior. For my dad and mom, they enjoyed and laughed at all the social gaffe, innocent improprieties, Victorian hypocrisies, and the words & life-actions of a little girl who turns adolescent and changes people's lives around her - Anne of Green Gables.

I look forward to the day when I will watch this movie with my future kids.  A super movie (A+) for couples and families.",1173312000,,2067,5.186186186186186

Megan Follows delivered an absolutely brilliant performance as young Anne- portraying perfectly her humorous melodramatics, her sweet and loving side, and her feisty, stubborn side. She IS Anne Shirley to me and always will be. The rest of the cast is also oustanding, especially Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth. The musical score is subtle, gentle, and so beautiful it never fails to send chills down my spine. This film is deeply touching, yet it's also full of wit and dry humor. So much of it is tongue-in-cheek, be ready to do a LOT of laughing when you watch it! It all comes across as very real and wonderfully human, rather than overly sentimental.

I remember when this miniseries was first broadcast on PBS here in the United States, when I was a little girl. I was too young to even know about the ""Anne"" books, and yet this film somehow drew me in early on, and I sat entranced in front of the television screen for the entire four hours. For me, ""Anne"" is a part of my childhood memories because our family (including my dad and brother!)  re-watched it so many times over the years. I'm in my 20's and it's still one of my all-time favorite movies. I have now read L. M. Montgomery's books and I enjoyed them, but it was this film adaptation- along with its first sequel- that really made me discover and fall in love with her characters.",1168041600,,1595,4.589473684210526

1233833,5,B00000JKSG,"How in heaven's name did Anne of Green Gables ever make it through the politically-correct censors at PBS?  It's not anti-Protestant, anti-Catholic, anti-family, anti-marriage, anti-motherhood, anti-heterosexual, or anti-Anglo Saxon, which is what you'll see the 364 other days a year on your local PBS station.

I'll tell you how.  They couldn't ignore the quality of this first-rate production.  And after those at PBS realized (probably to their great cynical chagrin) how beloved this show would become, they only showed it during their pledge weeks.  And - guess what? - the money poured into their Grinch-like hands.

If that isn't reason enough to buy this DVD, then there's no convincing you because no greater reason exists.  Who would rather sit through a mindless PBS pledge break if he or she could avoid it by owning, arguably, the best made-for-TV movie ever produced?",1167436800,3,882,5.212765957446808

1233835,5,B00000JKSG,"The movie Anne of Green Gables is based on a book of the same name by L.M. Montgomery...a book I loved as a child and still reread occasionally to this day. So often when people review a film version of a book they say ""it's not as good as the book, but..."" It's almost as if it is expected that the movie can't be as good as the book, because no one can out think a reader's imagination.

As an avid reader and movie watcher, I've seen hundreds of book-to-movie adaptations, and this is the ONLY one where I honestly thought they got everything perfect. The casting was perfect (standouts include Megan Follows (of course) as Anne and Colleen Dewhurst as Marilla). The scenery was perfect. The faithfulness to the book was amazing and like nothing I've ever seen. The music was perfect, a hauntingly beautiful score by Hagood Hardy. You may think I need a thesaurus, but there's really no other word for it...perfect.

One more piece of evidence for its perfection-now, when I reread the novel, I picture these actors in my head going through the story. You can't give a movie a higher complement than that. If, for some odd reason, you are a fan of the book and have not seen this movie, don't waste any more time. Go and buy it!",1166054400,3,1231,4.442477876106195

So I expected these DVDs (individually not the collection) would have the closed caption but it did not have any (subtitles or closed caption).  I was so disappointed because I am deaf and these movies had a lot of talking.  Finally, my friend showed me this (The Collection) instead of individual DVD.

1233840,5,B00000JKSG,"Kevin Sullivan's TV movie ""Anne Of Green Gables"" is as unusual in theme as it is beautiful.  On the surface, this 4-hour adaptation of Lucy Maud Montgomery's classic novel deals largely with everyday events (everyday, at least, for Canada's rural Prince Edward Island, in the early 1900's).  But in terms of fundamentals it is a richly romantic story about values and their role in human life.

Talented Megan Follows plays the feisty red-haired heroine to perfection.  Richard Farnsworth and Colleen Dewhurst give unforgettable performances in their roles of Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, the elderly brother and sister who ask an orphanage to send them a boy to help on their farm, Green Gables.  Instead of a boy they are sent 13-year old Anne Shirley by mistake.

Anne is bright, imaginative, and talkative, dreamily preoccupied with poetry and tales of romance.  But she is a passionate valuer, constantly searching for a ""kindred spirit"" or ""bosom friend"" to share her values with.  Passed from one foster family to another, with no one to care for her, she has known little happiness; but she loves life's promise with an aching intensity that makes her shine out in the midst of her bleak surroundings, and makes her seem ""odd"" to most people.  Marilla, a hard-headed ""realist"" who seems almost to have given up valuing, meets Anne's affection with nothing but crustiness, at first.  Matthew, on the other hand, is a painfully shy, quiet, gentle old man, who blossoms for the first time in his life under the warmth of Anne's love.  He is first to realize something it takes Marilla much longer to understand: that they needed Anne even more than Anne needed them.

At the beginning of the story Anne is an impractical idealist with her head in the clouds, constantly coming into collision with her surroundings, falling from one misadventure into another.  With the best of intentions, she insults Marilla's friend, gets into trouble at school, is caught trespassing in a neighbor's cow pasture, and falls off a roof.  Marilla shakes her head: ""When I said you could stay as a trial, I had no idea you'd take me literally.""  Teased at school by a pesky boy who pulls her pigtails and calls her ""carrots,"" Anne breaks a slate over the boy's head.  In despair over her red hair, she tries to dye it and accidentally turns it green.  Finally Marilla begins to soften, as she recalls how her own fiery temper used to lead her into trouble as well.  Thoughtfully, she tells Anne that the girl may now stay with them permanently: ""I think you may be a kindred spirit, after all.""

""Anne Of Green Gables"" does not have a complicated plot, but is full of colorful incident: Anne loses her best friend through a misunderstanding, attempts to act out Tennyson's ""Lady of Shallot"" in a leaky rowboat, lets a mouse get into the pudding, attends her first ball, and saves a baby's life.

But her transformation from an impractical idealist to a romantic realist is what the movie is really all about.  This is a highly unusual theme, and it is dealt with better in the movie version than in the original novel.  One character, early in the movie, tells Anne she hopes that life will ""shatter this dream-world that you live in;"" and eventually Anne does change.  But unlike most people, whose youthful love of life is eroded and replaced by cynicism, Anne's values are merely transformed into practical goals, and she remains as much an idealist as ever.  (The transformation is not actually completed until the sequel, ""Anne of Avonlea,"" which is also noteworthy, though not as good as the first movie.)

As an added bonus, ""Anne of Green Gables"" is beautifully filmed at historic sites on Prince Edward Island and elsewhere.  And Hagood Hardy's benevolent music score is rich in inspiration.  This masterpiece of romanticism deserves to live forever.",1155427200,8,3847,4.860429447852761

While no book and movie can ever folloiw one another EXACTLY, it keeps so strongly to the story I almost had to go back to figure out which details they left out. Megan Follows did a terrific job as Anne, and it was a great acting challenge as well, as Anne grows from about the age of 12 to 16-17 in this movie, and Megan Follows was 15 or 16, I believe. Yet her ability carried her through as a very believable 12 year old. The rest of the casting was inspired. The characters looked and acted almost exactly like I had always imagined them. Anne is human. She gets mad, she gets hurt, she acts or speaks before she thinks, and this makes her believable to any child, or any one of us who's ever done something like that.

Kevin Sullivan did a beautiful job of bringing to life the works of Lucy M. Montgomery's series of Anne of Green Gables. I loved this movie the first time I saw it on television on PBS and I was thrilled to finally find it on DVD. Anne Shirley is a young orphan girl with a huge imagination, daydreams, and a huge talker. She's transferred from home to home and then back to the orphanage until she is finally picked to live in a town called Avonlea. She lives with a family Marilla & Mathew Cuthbert (played by: Colleen Dewhurst & Richard Farnsworth). After worrying she wouldn't be adopted because she's not a boy she warms their hearts and starts a new life with them. And she then soon meets her bosom friend Diana Barry (Schuyler Grant) and of course Gilbert Blythe (Jonathan Crombie). We follow the lives of these characters that Anne meets along the way. This series is for any young girl or for any girl at any age to enjoy and the entire family. The fun part is you can also see parts of the cast that end up being in Kevin Sullivan's production of Road to Avonlea. But this series is wonderful, charming, and full of adventures. The supporting cast is quite amazing as well they include: Rachel Lynde (Patricia Hamilton), Miss Stacy (Marilyn Lightstone), & Aunt Josephine (Charmion King) just to name a few of my favorites. This movie is also about life and the human heart that we see through Anne's eye's.

It is entertaining and fairly close to the book/s. I feel that the story is highly  appropriate for children and adults alike. It doesn't have any violence or foul language, but it isn't stupid or patronizing like many ""childrens"" films. I'm 26 and I still think it's great.
In spite oh what others have said, I feel the DVD quality is great. The colors are much more vibrant than the colors on my VHS and while the ""extras"" were few in number, they are entertaining anyway.

I'm very happy to report first that to my eyes the quality of the picture is very good indeed; I'm not an expert but the limitations seem to be in the original print and not in the mastering; indeed, there are to my eye very few compression artifacts to be seen. In particular, the wonderful colors of Prince Edward Island shine out beautifully. Second, while there is no chapter menu, there are chapters. My only objection to the DVD as a DVD is that it's a flipper--but hey, so's ""Schindler's List""! This is a DVD worthy of the film, and for three and a half hours of such a wonderful film, the price is not, I think, too steep.",1083888000,13,789,4.337837837837838

1233891,5,B00000JKSG,"I first watched this movie at my aunt's house. She had just been shown it by one of her friends and so she wanted to share it with my mother and I. So we sat for the 240 minutes of all 4 movies which included ""Anne of Green Gables"" and ""Anne of Green Gables the Sequel"" laughing and crying. This movie is able to capture amazing emotions. It is a tale of friendship, heartache, embarrassment, and most importantly love. You see her as she first arrives a mistake to Green Gables since Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert wanted to adopt a boy. But as soon as they get to know Anne Shirley they cannot let her go. Anne soon finds a ""kindred spirit"" in neighbor Diana Barry. They spend their childhood in school, at parties and together finding themselves. As they enter the time when many a young woman from that time would have married Anne goes to Queens College. There she gains her teaching degree. But when Matthew dies and Marilla is left with only one option but to sell Green Gables if she is left to live alone Anne is given the opportunity to teach at the local school house instead of distant Carmody. This chance is granted to her by an old chum Gilbert Blythe. He had made the fatal error of calling her ""Carrots"" in one of their first meetings. I call this error fatal since it is the one thing that Anne, who has an amazing imagination, cannot imagine away from herself. She despises her red hair with a passion.  This is something she won't forget but though she doesn't know it he has a secret love for her. When he professes this she refuses him for she feels that she is not in love with him and thinks she can never feel that way. Naturally this hurts him but he is soon off to medical school in his quest to become a doctor. After a neighbor is left a widow and moves in with Marilla Anne soon follows in leaving Avonlea. This time she she leaves for Kingsport Ladies College where amongst teaching she finds romance in one of her pupil's fathers. This man is her ideal dream but for some reason it doesn't feel right. She then turns him down and surrenders herself to being an old maid. That summer she returns to Avonlea, having turned down a 5 year teaching contract. As soon as she is home though she learns terrible news: Gilbert is dying of scarlet fever. At that moment she notices who her true love is. Having a book written on Avonlea she goes to him to show the dedication in his honor for giving her the idea in the first place. By the end of the summer he is recuperated and she accepts his proposal in the end. To me this movie is even better than the book. The picture quality is so good you could think it was from today instead of nearly 20 years ago. The acting is impeccable with actors you can really believe are the characters. These characters will most likely never leave you. To this day it remains in my top five for its humor, realism and human dynamics.",1081036800,3,2892,4.3161764705882355

1233898,5,B00000JKSG,"If anything (and here purist fans of the novel may want to stop reading) Kevin Sullivan improved upon the novel.  He cleaned it up structurally, and, best of all, deepened and enriched some of the major characters, most notably Gilbert who tends to get lost in the series as a sort of semi-defined ""shadow person.""  Sullivan deftly handles the Victorian melodrama and Follows gives a no-nonsense performance of a character that could have come off as so dreamy and unrealistic as to be sickening.  There's nothing sickening here, however.  The film is pitch-perfect throughout.  It is true to its era, it is meticulously and humorously scripted, and brilliantly acted.  Dewhurst and Farnsworth are revelations in their roles.  This is a superior production that creates such a sense of genuine, earned warmth (right down to the lovely music score) that you will be compelled to watch it again and again.  It's a real crime that Megan Follows is not featured more often in American film and television; in this film and the sequel she exhibits the kind of performance authenticity too rarely scene in young actors.  (For an equally impressive mini-series based on a classic book, be sure and see the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version of ""Pride and Prejudice."")  This production comes together so perfectly as to elevate the film to a level that I suspect even the filmmakers never expected to achieve.",1069286400,2,1400,4.995689655172414

The movie is set in another place and era and often the morals and hardships they endured are overlooked in this day and age.

The color quality and sound balance are perfect.

The chemistry between Anne and Gilbert seems so real, however whether it turns out well or not is up to you to watch the movie! Since Anne of Green Gables is filmed on location, fans of Montgomery won't be dissapointed as the movie is just like the book with only two or three alterations.

In this film, the acting is strong. The scenery is lush. The plot is relentless. Truly, it is! I mean it's not awful, but the girl just kind of experiences life. If they wanted to make a film like this, more interesting details should have been added to the plot; that, or they could have shortened it up a little.

1233913,5,B00000JKSG,"When I saw for the first time Lucy Maud Montgomery's classic, 'Anne of Green Gables' I fell in love with Prince Edward's Island. Now, it's on my list of favorite travel places to go. I couldn't wait for the sequel, 'Anne of Avonlea' to come out. I was hooked. I'll be reading all the Montgomery books. Just being trivial, did you know that there were others up for the part of the red-haired Anne Shirley? Even Schuyler Grant was up for the part of Anne but, got the part of Diana Barry (Anne's best friend) instead. Who is more perfect for the role than Megan Follows. I believe she captured the character more, as the red-haired, dramatic orphan Anne Shirley. Also rounding out a great cast is Richard Farnsworth (The Straight Story, Texas Across the River, Resurrection) who plays Matthew Cuthbert and Colleen Dewhurst (Broadway's 'O'Niell's 'A Moon For the Misbegotten,' Annie Hall, Ice Castles) as Marilla Cuthbert.

The story is about an orphan girl growing out of her humble beginning to a beautiful, sophicated young woman. Anne is taken from an orphanage by mistake as the Cuthberts look for help in their elderly years and try to get a boy from the orphanage. When the orphanage can't get a boy the Cuthberts want, they send Anne instead. So the story begins Matthew taking Anne home to the farm at Ingleside. When she mets Marilla the first time, Marilla is not much taken to Anne and tells Matthew she has to go back. But with much convincing from Matthew and Anne, Marilla let's her stay. Matthew and Marilla's lives are far from normal since the imaginative Anne who seems to manage to get into uninvited trouble. Out of the awkward young Anne grows a young lady's love for life and a penace for drama. I love films that are of this caliber aside from the kind of Hollywood stuff that peddles violence, sex, obscenity and profane language. ""Anne of Green Gables' takes you away from all of that into good family entertainment back to a time that was simple and innocent. Even Christian families will enjoy this one. It's one of the most endearing stories ever made and it will probably will be a classic for many generations to come. I highly recommend it!",1056931200,8,2170,4.651041666666667

My mom told me about this movie that was on and I insisted I thought it was stupid.  Well, I've had to eat my words ever since!  She finally got me to watch it and watch it I did!!!  Over and over again.  I can't tell you how many times I've watched it in the past fifteen years.
Anne of Green Gables is the story of Anne (spelled with an E) Shirley, an orphan girl who goes to live with an elderly brother and sister, Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, on Prince Edward Island.  She gets there only to find out there's been some mistake and the Cuthberts really wanted a boy, not a girl.  Marilla puts Anne through a trial period to see if they'll keep her.  Matthew falls in love with Anne on the way home from the train station and wants to keep her.  They decide to keep her and the rest of the movie is the story of her growing up with her bosom friend, Diana Barry, and her rival in school, Gilbert Blythe, and life with Matthew and Marilla on PEI.
This is a wonderful movie.  Megan Follows is absolutely brillant.  She is charming and spirited and really brings to life the character of Anne.  Richard Farnsworth and Colleen Dewhurst are wonderful as Matthew and Marilla.  Mr. Farnsworth really portrays the shy, backwards Matthew to a T.  And Ms. Dewhurst does an equally excellent job as Marilla, the stern, but loving disciplinarian.  Jonathan Crombie is great as Gilbert Blythe.  There seems to be a natural chemistry between him and Megan Follows that lights up the screen.  One can almost forget they are acting and actually believe they are Anne and Gilbert.
I had recently just bought the DVD and watched it yesterday.  I must say that after watching this movie 15 years after I first watched it,that it really stands the test of time.

My children and I love this movie and I feel it teaches morals with a lot of humor mixed in. My husband, who normally deplores ""old fashioned"" movies, will even watch this one with us (while pretending to be busy at his desk though)!
For little boys (and girls ;-)) there is enough action to keep them captivated for the entire duration.

The cast of this production is noteworthy. Megan Follows is an enduring character, sinking into Anne with ease. She is at time frustratingly stubborn and at other times completely charming. Sassy and full of life and spirit, you cannot help but love Anne Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth are equally good as Marilla and Mathew Cuthbert. It is hard to believe that such a tender player as Richard Farnsworth spent over 30 years as a stuntman.
The DVD is great, and I have had no complaints. The quality of picture and sound are as good as any of my DVDs. The production is not widescreen, of course, because it is a television series filmed in the television aspect ratio.
The extras are all valuable. The extra scenes, and the story behind them, add a new dimension to the story. Megan's audition reel is included, as is feature commentary.

1233944,5,B00000JKSG,"""Anne of Green Gables"" is just a beautiful, beautiful film, well crafted, carefully thought out, and superbly acted. There really isn't anything bad that I can think to say about it; it's an amazing, magical, and altogether unforgettable film. I saw it for the first time when I was about nine or ten years old; now, at seventeen, I have come to appreciate its depth and innocence so much more. When I was younger and used to watch it, I loved laughing at Anne's funny and endearing antics in the first half of the movie; now that I'm older, I still love that aspect of the movie, but I can also better understand and appreciate Anne's blossoming into a beautiful young woman. I would say that any girl 12 or older can get the full feel of this movie, and believe me, all of those girls should do so if they want a wonderful and refreshing movie experience unlike any other (and that is the truth).
""Anne of Green Gables"" is truly an engaging story of our beloved heroine Anne Shirley, a fiery, redheaded 13-year-old orphan looking for someone to love her (and put up with her!) Her whimsical outlook on life and her fascination with fantasy and imagery has made many people turn away out of frustration and sometimes even lack of heart. However, little Anne is given her own miracle when she is chosen to live with a family in the gorgeous town of Avonlea and ends up with Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert quite by accident. The sweet and soft-spoken Matthew is immediately taken to her, but Marilla does not exactly intend to let this talkative, imaginative little girl open the key to her hidden affections. Fortunately, Anne manages to worm her way into everyone's heart, and it is not long before the stable love she is finally receiving begins to help her come into her own as a friend, student, and person. As she eventually comes to understand, accept, and grow through sometimes rocky friendships, difficult neighbors, and competition from her peers, Anne's transformation from a somewhat gawky little girl to a substantial woman of intelligence, maturity, and strength of character finally seeps through, leaving the viewer feeling as if they truly witnessed the positive change and growth of this charming young girl.
Overall, I would rate this movie as easily being one of the most magical and amazing films of all time. Megan Follows comes through beautifully and brings the title character of ""Anne of Green Gables"" to life in her own unique way. She is a notable actress with great potential and has a seemingly flawless ability to enter Anne's world of confusion, passion, and success. Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth give strongly acted and emotionally accurate performances as Marilla and Matthew. Also rounding out the main cast are Jonathan Crombie as Anne's faithful and somewhat desperate admirer Gilbert Blythe (you will fall absolutely in love with his character); Schuyler Grant as Anne's faithful best friend Diana Barry; and the priceless Patricia Hamilton as Rachel Lynde, Anne's busybody neighbor. The lighthearted and tender story intertwined with the scenery and gorgeous shots of Avonlea make this a perfect choice for the entire family. Sadly, there just aren't very many films like this being made right now; we all know what the dominant themes of today's movies are, and none of them come even close to what you see in ""Anne of Green Gables."" This is a gem of a movie and certainly one to include in your video collection. If you like any kind of movie about family, courage, love, and all that good stuff, then ""Anne"" might be the very best you could get. I recommend every piece of this heartfelt film; it is time and money VERY well spent and is the heart and soul of innocence and love.",1041379200,101,3730,4.7844961240310075

1233947,5,B00000JKSG,"When good books are adapted to TV or the silver screen, people play close attention, and it's not often that the adaptation lives up to expectations. Anne of Green Gables is a wonderful, noteworthy exception. I have read and loved the books ever since I was a child, and I thought the movie more than did them justice. My friends all agree.
Megan Follows is perfectly cast as Anne Shirley, an opinionated, carrot-top orphan who is mistakenly adopted by farmers looking for a boy to help out. Matthew is a sweet old man who takes to Anne right away, but his sister Marilla takes a while to be won over. Anne fights with boys at school and finds a bosom friend, and as the small community falls in love with her, so does the audience. Anne's story is touching and thoughtful, and the DVD generally does justice to the beautiful Canadian scenery. The picture quality could be better, but the slight grainy look actually seems atmospheric. We are transported to a bygone, magical place, and one can only come away from this feeling like a better person for having seen it.",1037577600,5,1068,4.596858638743456

Recently it came to mind, and I decided to buy it and see if I still enjoyed it so much. I must admit..I enjoyed it MORE! What an absolutely charming story. I honestly cant imagine anyone playing the role of Annne better. I just loved her..she was so dramatic and passionate. I would have loved to have had a ""Bosom Friend"" just like her. My only complaint is that at the end, I would have loved to have seen a little kiss between Anne and Gilbert..but other than that...perfect. ""Anne of Green Gables"" is DEFINITELY worth your time and money.",1034899200,,646,4.347107438016529

Whenever I need a little cheering up or a surefire movie choice I come back to Anne of Green Gables. The Sequel brings the character of Anne back in full force and I loved every minute of it. The final installment of the Anne trilogy, I think, accurately depicts Anne as an adult. She still has that flair for Adventure we all love!!

I was reluctant to watch the movie because I was afraid it might ruin the vision I had always had in my mind of Anne, Green Gables and all the characters.  I was thrilled to see that Megan Follows IS Anne... and even Green Gables was just as I had always pictured it.  Matthew, Marilla, Diana, Gilbert... all were true to the wonderful story.

1233968,5,B00000JKSG,"Okay, it's definitely a woman's movie too, and a young adult's movie.  However, it took me a long time before I could be persuaded to watch it, because I assumed there just wouldn't be any masculine appeal here.  I was expecting a bland, innocent, goody-goody-two-shoes movie.  Well, I was right about it's being innocent, but far as it being bland, no it isn't.  It sure isn't ""Goody Goody Two Shoes"".  And while it may basically be a woman's movie, it definitely has masculine appeal.
The filming in Canada is richly beautiful.  The characters here are each of them strong and believable, characters you will enjoy spending three or four hours with, not noticing the passing time.
And this film is a breath of fresh air, without violence, sexual situations, or earthy language.  Usually, such a film is on the bland side because today's producers and directors don't seem to know how to handle drama without any of the above elements.  And if I am to be completely honest, I am not planning on dieting on cinematic fare such as this.  But it is nice to know that I can enjoy a pure family movie when it is done as this one is.
I did wonder at the start about the narration, and whether or not I'd find it acceptable throughout the story, but truth is that the narration does add immeasurably to one's enjoyment.
This one film that I can highly recommend to all except the most extremely jaded viewer.  (Yeah, I know ""most extremely"" is redundant, but I still want to retain that wording.  LOL)",1026259200,14,1495,4.582706766917293
1233969,5,B00000JKSG,"I first watched Anne of Green Gables when I was in the third grade, and the impact it had on my life was immeasurable.  Here was a person who, like me, didn't really fit in, and yet she made the best of her situation and her imagination - what a role-model.  Now, almost twenty years later, I can still watch this miniseries and feel the fond memories and familiar aches of that long-ago identification.
The story follows Anne (Megan Follows), an orphan who mistakenly gets sent to the remote and beautiful Prince Edward Island at the turn of the 20th century (Anne is supposed to be a boy, to help her adoptive `parents' with farmwork).  She develops bonds with her new family, as well as many members of the community, and goes on to college to foster her love of learning and writing.  Anyone who identifies this as a ""chick flick"" either has no imagination or is overly-cynical.  True, there is romance, but it's more a story of life rather than love.
The DVD presentation is good - it's fullscreen (as it was shot), with some grain, but not too much.  There are a few deleted scenes, some Megan Follows screen tests (humorous, but unintentionally so), and a feature-length commentary.  Its too bad that the only way to get this great series on DVD is to import it; note that the next parts of the series, Anne of Avonlea (AKA Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel) and Anne 3 (the 2000 series that has the same cast, but doesn't really follow the book) are also available on DVD from Sullivan Entertainment, although they are much harder to find than this first part (and the quality of the video on those discs is pretty crummy).
Final Grade: A-",1025222400,12,1646,4.521885521885522
1233970,5,B00000JKSG,"""Anne of Green Gables"" is a remarkable series.  I have never read the L.M. Montgomery books, but someday I feel I must.  Everything about this production is perfect, and I feel as Anne does when she first glimpses the ""White Way of Delight."" Magical.
The cast of this production is noteworthy.  Megan Follows is an enduring character, sinking into Anne with ease.  She is at time frustratingly stubborn and at other times completely charming.  Sassy and full of life and spirit, you cannot help but love Anne Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth are equally good as Marilla and Mathew Cuthbert.  It is hard to believe that such a tender player as Richard Farnsworth spent over 30 years as a stuntman.
The DVD is great, and I have had no complaints.  The quality of picture and sound are as good as any of my DVDs.  The production is not widescreen, of course, because it is a television series filmed in the television aspect ratio.
The extras are all valuable.  The extra scenes, and the story behind them, add a new dimension to the story.  Megan's audition reel is included, as is feature commentary.
I'm glad I grew up watching this series, and I am glad that I own it on DVD, to watch and share anew.",1023753600,22,1208,4.576744186046511

Rare is a movie that can go as deep as this one and stay true to itself.  You are never swayed by any of the unbelievability that so many other movies seem to be plagued with.  Truly a find for the romantic at heart.  Enjoy this one.  It's a true find.",1023235200,,363,4.114285714285714

This would have been a big mistake on my part as the DVD movie is 100% better quality then the VHS version that I currently own. After watching this movie on DVD I can recommend it highly as a great value. No problems, the movie worked perfectly from start to finish. This has always been one of my favorite movies and I am glad to finally be able to own it in the DVD format. The product information sticker on the DVD box had a date of 4/26/02. Other information on the package was Bin#T00328; NTSC/Region1; 000392.

Megan Follows was simply magnificent in this movie, along with other great actors such as Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth. This is not only Canadian film at it's finest, but one of the finest films ever produced. Wonderful breakthrough performances by young actors Schulyer Grant and Jonathan Crombie. Schulyer Grant will remind you of your best friend, and Jonathan Crombie will simply make your heart swoon! This movie holds a record for achieving the highest ratings in Canadian television, and was a ratings hit in the U.S., and every other country it aired in such as the U.K., Australia, Japan, Germany, etc. This movie is worth your time! A great family film, good for the kids, but really a movie for all ages! Kind hearted, serious, romantic, funny, and breathtaking are all words to express this movie! A must see!

1233988,4,B00000JKSG,"The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is that the format is pan & scan.  I realize this is/was a television production, so perhaps it was never filmed with a widescreen aspect ratio.  In any case, aside from that it is wonderful.  The picture looks good; I have seen none of the artifacts (pixelization) mentioned by another reviewer-the picture looks fine.  I might suggest getting a DVD lens cleaner-I had the same problem with all of my DVD's before I got one, and now I never have the problem.
The sound is pretty good and the extras are nice.  The full-length commentary is a treat.  My wife and I sat down to watch a little bit and ended up watching over two hours.  The director and editor shed a lot of fun light on the production.  There is also about 15 minutes of Megan Follows auditioning which is fun.  There are a few missing scenes from the version that aired in Germany as well as production stills.
Very nicely done.  Widescreen and perhaps more booklet notes would have been nice.  A treat.  (4 & 1/2 stars)",1012953600,11,1031,4.396825396825397

The video quality of the DVD isn't much better than that of the VHS tape, and the picture is compression-artifact ridden. I even purchased the Collector's Edition, hoping that Sullivan Entertainment had remastered the DVD for the new version, but alas, no! Worth getting if you don't already own a copy, or if you absolutely *have* to have the director's commentary, or the deleted scenes, or Megan Follows' audition reel; but you might want to wait until it gets released in the States-- Buena Vista will undoubtedly remaster these with better quality video.",1011830400,31,731,4.809523809523809

I also recommend Anne of Green Gables the Sequel (1987), Anne of Avonlea (1975), When Calls the Heart (2014- ), and Anne With an E (2017- ). All of the series feature wonderful locations and great characters, but the newest series have the best production values, best colors, etc., due to digital technology. I like them all.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002), and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.
