5063765,5,B00790XMOA,"I loved that there are two stories  running parallel...one political, one a murder enquiry but interlocking...great performances, I wish it would go on forever, I just hated it ending.",1373068800,,184,5.344827586206897
5063766,4,B00790XMOA,"While I must admit . . . once again . . . just like the first two . . . after a couple of episodes I knew who the killer was. While this supposedly last season to this great series seemed to repeat a few sub plots and resurrect (in persona) some characters from the first two it was still a great show to watch. There were a couple of unexplained events though. I can';t comment on them or it will give them away. But they have to do with the kid, the cat, the first scene, the sailors. At first I was disappointed at the ending . . . pretty shocking and kinda tragic . . . left me feeling kinda empty . . . but after thinking about it
***********semi spoiler alert . . . so stop reading now if you don't want hints at the ending**********************
I guess I couldn't really expect Sarah Lund to wind up in the red house with the white picket fence, a man she loves and loves her, reconciled with her kid and mom with a garden to tend. But I did expect the series to be wrapped up without lingering questions and a cliffhanger so-to-speak. But on the bright side (if there is one . . .)
***********end spoiler alert****************************************************************************************
I noticed again that (this) Denmark needs some serious lighting installed in its buildings,houses,streets,etc . . . even the nice ones . . . too many shadows . . . seriously depressing. . . is it really like that over there??? Maybe this isn't the end of Forbrytelsen. :-)",1373068800,,1479,4.522388059701493
5063767,5,B00790XMOA,"Never thought i'd watch a foreign TV program with subtitles with such awe.

Wonderful series - 1 -2 and 3.",1372464000,,106,4.3
5063768,5,B00790XMOA,"We watched the three seasons and loved them. Sofie Grabol is so good in her understated
kind of acting, as if she was so unimportant... Of course she still leaves lots of room to the
rest of this so well-matched cast. I'll be watching it again for sure.",1371340800,,253,4.291666666666667
5063769,5,B00790XMOA,"Another great season. Best one so far........shame I hear they won't make anymore.

I had no idea who had done until the last episode.....fantastic",1370822400,,147,5.125
5063770,5,B00790XMOA,"We had seen the American version of the Killing and decided to go ahead and buy a universal DVD player so that we could watch the original Danish version of the show. One of the best investments we have made in terms of entertainment! The Killing, Danish version, has 3 seasons and each one is gripping, haunting and exquisitely well made. The Killing, Danish version, falls in the category of Danish Noir film, and we are hooked. Other fantastic Danish series include The Bridge and The Eagle. Go ahead and invest in a universal DVD player, very inexpensive less than $75.00 on Amazon. This will open your viewing horizons to an entirely new level and if you start with the Danish version of the Killing, I guarantee you won't be disappointed!",1366848000,5,744,4.687022900763359
5063771,5,B00790XMOA,Received this DVD quickly and it's great. The final (unfortunately) story in original Danish series: The Killing. One of the best mystery (police procedurals) ever.,1366329600,,164,5.6
5063772,4,B00790XMOA,"'i langden' is Danish for The End

The third and final series of 'Forbrydelsen' or 'The Killing', the Danish thriller involves a murder and kidnapped child. I purchased the Danish series, reading subtitles is a pleasure for me.  A great sense is conveyed by tone and body language in the original version. Series three is well written and performed. Sophia Grabol who play Sarah Lund, is a perfectionist.  She is on the verge of her 20th year in police work,, and a cushy chair job awaits her. She has her son on her mind. He has not forgiven her for choosing her job over him. Just as she is going to celebrate her last day, a young girl goes missing. Sarah with her years of experience has a gut feeling about this kidnapping. She turns full force into solving this mystery. Along the way she meets an old lover, and the complications of her life catch up with her.

Forbrydelsen also explores the global financial crisis. New and convincing characters in the political and financial world appear. As a kidnapper is attempting to get justice for his murdered daughter, the police are looking for the kidnapper. This final series has a dramatic finish that leaves you horrified and yet, there is an understanding of what took place. Superb acting and the dark, rainy exterior of Copenhagen leave you feeling unsettled.  You will not be disappointed, maybe shocked, but, then, Forbrydelsen is that kind of series.

Highly Recommended. 03-21-13",1363824000,8,1443,4.798387096774194
5063773,5,B00790XMOA,"Makes 'Downton Abbey' (which I loved) look like the superior soapie it really is. 'The Killing' requires, intelligence, concentration and commitment - when you watch it you'll find out why over 4 million Brits loved it and wanted more...",1363219200,,237,5.102564102564102
5063774,5,B00790XMOA,The best series yet and riveting storyline. The acting is very good and non of the Hollywood over acting and gratuitous violence and sex.,1401494400,,137,4.75
5063775,1,B00790XMOA,"I have a problem  in that only the top line of the sub titles is visible. The rest sink below the bottom of my screen. I have a 52 inch screen so it should n't be a problem. Otherwise it looks ti be a great show. A shame I am unable to enjoy it.

Has anyone else had this problem?",1390867200,,280,3.65
5063776,5,B00790XMOA,I am sorry this is the last season. The problem with DVD's is you stay up late watching as many episodes as you can. Excellent series.,1390435200,2,134,4.1923076923076925
5063777,5,B00790XMOA,I loved season 1 so much I bought season 2 and 3.  I think season 3 is the best.  I highly recommend this.,1386288000,3,106,3.5652173913043477
5063778,3,B00790XMOA,"I was disappointed to find that this Season 3 storyline is nearly the same as the one in Season 2.  At first I actually thought I was watching Season 2 and it had somehow been packaged as Season 3.  Nope.  I would much have preferred a whole new story.  I have no idea why they did this, but had i known I would nothave spent money to buy Season 3.  I love the characters.  A shame and a poor way to end the series.",1380844800,,415,3.880952380952381
5063779,5,B00790XMOA,Nordic Noir lives up to its name as never before.  The plot was clever and the end so completely unexpected.,1380758400,,108,4.4
5063780,5,B00790XMOA,I can't be the only one in North America who'd like to be able to see this without buying another DVD player. What gives? Help amazon! Someone is missing a potential profit center here!,1378771200,,185,4.470588235294118
5063781,5,B00790XMOA,"I have become quite attached to Sarah Lund and her partners. Extremely well acted, written, and very absorbing. Deep and suspenseful. Difficult to pace oneself in watching these because it is so engrossing you won't want to stop watching. Worth getting all three seasons. You'll need region 2 dvd player which I found for $40 on Amazon and possibly an adaptor plug for US if it doesn't come with one and you're good to go.",1377561600,2,422,4.64
5063782,5,B00790XMOA,"I started out watching the American version of The Killing, but decided to try the original, and while the US version is good, very good in fact, the Danish one is better, more nuanced. The only requirement for viewing is a multi-region DVD player.
As soon as one season ends, I am on the watch for the next. For all three seasons, the DVDs have arrived sooner than promised--sort of like airline schedules, with a built-in time cushion, no doubt. The one thing I do miss on these DVDs is a description of what each episode is about, for those times, all too frequent, when I forget where I left off, and have to watch through the introduction and first few minutes to see if all is familiar or not. Since the subtitles are a UK production, I would hope they will start providing this.
I would also recommend that you try Borgen, Danish political intrigue, and Bron, on which the new American series The Bridge is based.",1374105600,,920,4.482142857142857

8512486,5,B00790XMOA,"Forbrydelsen - Season 3 or The Killing is a 2012 ten-episode Danish murder mystery and thriller, created and written by Soren Sveistrup, and produced by Danish DR Television. In this third season, the story line begins with the investigation of the mysterious murders of three crew members of a freighter that has been docked in the Copenhagen harbor. These murders may be connected to the contentious reelection campaign of the incumbent Prime Minister, and his complicated relationship with the largest and most powerful corporation in Denmark. The lead detective is an introverted and conflicted female police officer, who is a brilliant and relentless investigator, but who is unable to communicate effectively, and to separate her chaotic work life from her dysfunctional personal life. There are many clever plot twists, which serve to challenge the viewer throughout the course of the series. Forbrydelsen is an exceptionally intelligent and intriguing detective procedural series, because it provides numerous credible murder suspects, each of whom is highly suspicious, and could easily be the killer. In addition, the atmosphere of Forbrydelsen is exceedingly dark and foreboding, in the classic Nordic Noir cinematic style. The performance of the lead actor, Sofie Grabol, is absolutely outstanding, as are the performances of the members of the talented supporting cast. Forbrydelsen - Season 3 is a decidedly intelligent, suspenseful, and gripping murder mystery and thriller, and I found it to be extremely engaging and entertaining. Forbrydelsen - Season 3 features superb plot and character development, as well as great acting performances, and it definitely merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1505865600,,1745,5.613636363636363
8512487,5,B00790XMOA,"I think Season 2 was more dramatic at the end or in a different way, but Season 3 was awesome too. The end is unpredictable as in Season 2.",1489622400,,139,3.8275862068965516

8512494,5,B00790XMOA,"Series III is the best yet & the other two series were great. I loved Series III so much, I went back and watched Series I for a second time. It took a second viewing of Series I to gain a greater appreciation of the acting in ""The Killing"" and not just by the Lund. I highly recommend ""The Killing.""  BTW, I tried watching the American version and it is unwatchable; so bad it is laughable. Hollywood should not try to remake successful Nordic Noir, it just shows how talentless and corporate Hollywood has become.  I mean, how stupid do you have to be to not even be able to copy or perhaps slightly improve a proven formula?

*Spoiler Alert*
Great acting and direction in the final scene of Series III. You know she has a chance to make amends and move forward and be the person those important to her want her to be, but she cannot help herself, which is really who she is....",1407628800,,880,4.289156626506024
8512495,5,B00790XMOA,"This is still a great show, even in it's final season. My opinion is it is better than season two, as good as season one. With the ending it had I hope they find a way to make season four. With all the Scandinavian series I have watched I think they will find a way.",1406678400,,266,3.8545454545454545
