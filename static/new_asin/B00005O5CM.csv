1639142,3,B00005O5CM,"An under achiever (stereotypical blond) played by Reese Witherspoon is dumped by her boyfriend that prefers to marry someone sophisticated and intelligent to further his career. The challenge is to retrieve her lost love at any cost; even if it means having to go law school.

It goes down hill from there as the movie is formal and filled with clichs. There are some interesting side stories but not enough to save from the mediocre main plot. The outcome is not surprising but satisfying.",1502841600,,490,4.833333333333333

1639149,3,B00005O5CM,"I had a feeling the first time I saw Reese Witherspoon.  She was going to be big.  I saw her when she was just a kid in Man In The Moon and there was just something about her.  And now she is an Oscar winning actress.  I think this is her best role.  She plays a  blonde air head who can pretty much get anything she wants.  But her boyfriend doesn't  really take her serious.  So he leaves her to go to Harvard law school.  So she submits a video of her self telling why Harvard should accept er too  How hard can it be.
Once there she gets everyone's attention with her look.  She gets the attention from everybody.  Good from everybody except the fellow law students.  Through it all she stands up for herself and eventually through her brains she starts winning them over too.  This movie has everything going for it.  I think it could also be Luke Wilson's and Selma Blair's best roles also.  And it has a sound track with the song Perfect Day that is perfect also.",1501891200,,970,4.213114754098361

Well let me just tell you that your perception is dead wrong! This movie has it all - vapid rich people, the brand of feminism we could handle in the 2000s, a tiny dog in outfits, ""ugly"" intellectuals, Stifler's mom, a Michelle Branch montage, love & revenge, an inaccurate representation of the legal system and the introduction of the Bend-and-Snap. This truly inspiring tale of an already privileged woman overcoming prejudice and adversity is exactly what you need to forget for about 90 minutes that someday you're going to die.",1495756800,2,751,4.921259842519685

Reese Witherspoon shines as Elle Woods, an enthusiastic sorority girl who goes to Law School because her boyfriend is going... in spite of what others think of her based on appearance.

This movie is clearly dated, and it's not something that's supposed to be taken too seriously, but the story is interesting, cute, and fun. A personal ""modern"" classic.",1483401600,3,469,5.012820512820513

she goes through much travail in starting at harvard. bumps in road. personalities.
HERE IS MY TAKE.... great movie, poor acting and scenes were seemingly filmed once. THE STORY IS AMAZING.  i feel hollywood played down this potential great movie and made it real silly. no sex. no drugs. no drunkeness. no language.

Although tolerably photographed and produced, the story line was inadequate and uninteresting promoting the ""academic quality"" of Hah Vahd Yahd, an institution better known as a criminal gang organizing center whose Endowment Fund not only encourages but perpetrates felony theft of the ratable property of continuing stuckholders of formerly great American companies via what they euphemize as ""stock buybacks"".

Reese Witherspoon manages to square her curves and transcend the limitations of prejudice and preconceptions. And all this became possible because of a very clever script that permitted her to continue being the cute valley girl while growing in dimensions undreamed of by her--or us. 4 1/2 stars.,1478304000,,414,4.763888888888889

1639797,3,B00005O5CM,"I didn't want to like this film, but Reese Witherspoon as Elle Woods is so charming.

This film isn't pure fluff.  It goes into some lengths to humanize Elle Woods, who though she is beautiful and going to a good school is also oblivious, out-of-place, doubted, and mocked.  Elle Woods is out of her element, but she fights back, undaunted even when humiliated, and it is refreshing, as any underdog story.  It is actually when she is down that she is the most powerful, because she takes step to better herself.

It is also shows the depth of Jennifer Coolridge's range.  She is the original MILF (from American Pie), advertised for her sexual prowess by two drunk guys barking MILF, and then heightened to glory when she finally appears - sexy and as wanton as all hell.

But in this film, Jennifer Coolridge plays homely, and weak, and even terrified.

You may envy Elle Woods because her plight seems so superficial.  But it is important to her.  Elle Woods may be beautiful and intelligent, but you want her to succeed.  I did like her.  And most of all, I understood her.  I admired her for fighting back.

This is a very entertaining film.",1459468800,,1146,4.58128078817734

Legally Blonde is a humorous movie that stars Reese Witherspoon as Elle Woods. She ends up deciding to take up a career as a lawyer and go to law school after some changes that occurred in her life. What is A little embarrassing at first is that her ex-boyfriend Matthew Davis (Warner Huntington) is dating Vivian Kensington (a fellow law student) After Elle Admitted to him About Vivian giving her a hard time. Fortunately, Elle has people in her life who can count as allies such as Emmett Richmond (Luke Wilson) and Paulette Bonaparte (Jennifer Coolidge). Of course, there are more actors, actresses, and plotlines to Legally Blonde but my intuition and logic steered me away from providing more details out of my concern that I would reveal too much of the plot and script outline of Legally Blonde. However, I will say, as an aspiring writer/scriptwriter I enjoyed that the character of Elle refused to let anyone place in her box and she voluntarily pushed herself out of her comfort zone to experience professional and psychological growth when she could have easily coasted on her looks (as what some of the other characters of Legally Blonde were trying to get her to do). Additionally, Legally Blonde served as a playful and fun reminder to me to keep striving to live up to my potential regardless of how Im perceived for doing so.",1447459200,,1370,4.760504201680672

1639967,5,B00005O5CM,"Is this movie fluffy, popcorn movie fun? Absolutely. And in this case, that's not a bad thing.

While many popcorn flicks are the same movie with minor plot and cast changes, Legally Blonde stands on its own. It follows Elle Woods as she fights her way into Harvard to win back her boyfriend, but the pink-clad scholar becomes much more than that. Overcoming sexual harassment and criticism from her peers, Elle ends up as the valedictorian of Harvard Law, has great friends and gets her man.

This is a feel good comedy that shows that a woman can get what she wants if she tries, although that may not be the goal she begins with.

A few things:
- Note that Emmett Forrest and Elle Woods end up together. Forrest? Woods? No coincidence there! And Warner Huntington (a negative word - hunting, which could happen in the woods) ends up losing out.
- The original story took place at Stanford law school, I believe, not Harvard. Read the novel. It's good.
- The musical is as great as the movie. Love the soundtrack!",1425600000,,1015,4.53551912568306
1639968,4,B00005O5CM,"Legally Blonde is comedy that stars Reese Witherspoon as a sorority girl who struggles to win back her ex-boyfriend by earning a law degree. This film is an adaptation of novel by Amanda Brown.

Elle Woods is the president of her sorority and a Hawaiian Tropic girl. And above all, a natural blonde. She dates the cutest fraternity boy on campus and wants nothing more than to be Mrs. Warner Huntington III. But is Elle is too blonde? So, when Warner packs up for Harvard Law and reunites with an old sweetheart from prep school, Elle rallies all her resources and gets into Harvard, determined to win him back. In her journey,she must wage the battle of her life, for her guy, for herself and for all the blondes in the world out there.

This is a fun movie about a bombshell who discovers a brainy aspect of her personality. Witherspoon provides a great performance and catapulted her into stardom in this original and refreshing movie that definitely provides entertainment and excitement from beginning to end. She definitely made Elle an engaging and vivacious personality that one will remember her and guys would not taker their eyes off her. No question that this will be enjoyed endlessly by the viewer.",1425340800,,1212,4.766666666666667

1639999,4,B00005O5CM,"Legally Blonde is a 2001 American comedy film directed by Robert Luketic, written by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, and produced by Marc E. Platt. It is based on a novel by Amanda Brown.

The film stars Reese Witherspoon as a sorority girl who struggles to win back her ex-boyfriend by earning a law degree, along with Luke Wilson as a young attorney she meets during her studies, Matthew Davis as her ex-boyfriend, Selma Blair as his new fiance, Victor Garber and Holland Taylor as law professors, Jennifer Coolidge as a manicurist, and Ali Larter as a fitness instructor, who was once her friend, accused of murder.

In America, the film was released on July 13, 2001, and received generally positive reviews. It was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture: Musical or Comedy and was ranked 29th on Bravo's 2007 list of ""100 Funniest Movies"". For her performance, Witherspoon received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress  Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the 2002 MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance.

The film's box-office success led to a 2003 sequel, Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde, and a 2009 direct-to-DVD spin-off, Legally Blondes. Additionally, Legally Blonde: The Musical premiered on January 23, 2007, in San Francisco and opened in New York City at the Palace Theatre on Broadway on April 29, 2007, starring Laura Bell Bundy. The musical has since closed on Broadway, but opened to very good reviews and box office in London's West End. The large ambitious scores to both feature films were written by Rolfe Kent and were orchestrated by Tony Blondal. They featured a 90-piece orchestra and were recorded at the Sony Scoring Stage in Culver City, CA.

what i like about the opening of Legally Blonde is that the movie makes good use of imagery and audio to paint the picture of what's ahead,the setting and everything else about this Film emit's adorableness (which is the kindest way for me describe this Movie).The plot does bring a bit of cliche later on,but there is still enough entertaining moments and cringe worthy moments that at the same time are intriguing. I was bothered by the fact that we had yet another flamboyantly gay Latino in the film(come on it's been done to death) however i felt some the debates in this Movie were pretty creative. The final act is pretty well done,except for  the choice to make the audience read out a large portion of the final results,which would have been so much better if there were visual progression to go along with it.

Reese witherspoon  does a  considerable portrayal as the lead because of the characters multi-layered persona,she juggles quite a bit,her chemistry with Luke Wilson is veritable. Luke is satisfying but a little stiff at times. Selma Blair is great as the villain of the Film. The Main character Elle Woods is adorable,smart and has much to gain and in turn is one hell of well developed
character by the end of the Film. The love interest of the Film is not given that much to do but he is increasingly integral to the last half of the Film.

other than the pretty obvious relationship drama cliches in this movie,there still is a considerable amount creativity into the execution of what is done here.

So with a solid performance from Witherspoon,good classy visuals,Legally Blonde is a unique and quality Film.",1415750400,,3351,4.830715532286213

The fact that her character makes it into Harvard Law School attests that she is no nitwit, but that she simply isn't interested in much beyond social partying and the newest fashions--until a reason to care about more arises.

It is not an important film, but it was a lot of fun to escape the real world for a couple of hours and laugh.

 I've heard that this film is good, not what you expect, yayah. whatever. I was bored home alone over break, so I tried it.

it's a wonderfully honest expectations vs reality. you expect what you get for the first half - pretty girl loses her Boyfriend, decides to win him back, gets in to Harvard (HOW? by sending a video of herself in a bikini *shudders*).
 blah blah blah.
the tipping point for me was the ""costume party"" - she finally has a word alone with her ex. he basically tells her what the rest of the world has been telling her - she's ""too pretty"" to be a lawyer. she's hot already, why try for a hard and possibly *gasp!* rewarding goal? she already has the male gaze! *heavy sarcasm*

up to this point, she really hasn't been /trying/ to be a lawyer, just the kind of girl the Boyfriend wants.

instead of crying/wailing/wanting him back, the movie takes a rad left into ""I'm going to beat you at your game, FOR ME.""
a rare and very good tone to take, if done right.

 this movie to me is her kicking her personal patriarchy's butt, so I had fun.

PS -

1640051,5,B00005O5CM,"This is a favorite movie of mine, a simple feel good romp through the halls of Harvard law. The story is simple yet entertaining, Elle a fantastically airheaded blonde who also happens to have a significant intelligence underneath it all, decided to follow her creepy boyfriend to Harvard after he dumps her to try to win him back by proving she will make a good and intelligent wife. The story follows her adventures and discovery of just how much of a creep he is as well as her phenomenal success in law school.

The film transfer is excellent, flawless detail and nice dark blacks keep the movie popping nicely, not too surprising on a relatively recent film mastered to blu ray. The sound is a nice stereo transfer, nothing amazing but it is clear with a clean sound stage and excellent voice clarity, no issues picking out dialogue, no muddy music or sound effects, all is nice and crisp.

All the old extras (except the commentary and HD trailer) have been distorted so that they're too wide, but still framed at 4:3, so that the right side is just missing entirely. Look at any of the section headings, credits, or soundtrack promos to see what I mean. Fox has been alerted of this but is in no rush to fix it.

1640073,4,B00005O5CM,"""Legally Blonde"" is about Elle (Reese Witherspoon), a sorority girl who, during her senior year in college, is dumped by her boyfriend, Warner Huntington III, because, according to him, she is not smart enough to be the wife of a future lawyer/senator. Elle sets out to prove him wrong. Warner has already been accepted at Harvard Law School, so Elle applies, sends a most unusual application, and is accepted. Somehow, despite some missteps along the way, Elle manages to succeed at Harvard, graduating at the top of her class, and gets placed with a top-rate firm, while Warner languishes near the bottom of his class.

And that's the plot. Which means that the plot is pretty straightforward, easy to follow, and lacks subtlety. One might add that it's a bit trite. Moreover, the improbability of Elle getting accepted at Harvard Law, given her credentials (or lack thereof), is overwhelming, as is the improbability of her rising to the top of her class. So, one has to do a little suspending of disbelief to accept the story line. But, after all, this is a comedy, which, I suppose, makes this okay.

However, the movie is redeemed by Reese Witherspoon. ""Legally blonde"" is one of her earlier efforts, but her talent, which has become even more evident in subsequent movies, is already on display, and, really, is enough to carry the entire movie and make it a movie that is worth watching once.  The truth is that despite its lack of depth, one can't help but root for Elle to turn the tables on Warner Huntington III, which she does from start to finish.",1380844800,,1561,4.731617647058823

Okay, I can understand the ""no fishnets"", but does smart and serious have to mean you are a dark suit?

Elle, in this movie, proves that you can be smart and feminine, smart and frivolous, smart and fun. It's a light message delivered in a light, entertaining way. I loved this comedy.",1379548800,,547,4.20952380952381

This is Siddhartha, leaving the confines of the surface of life wrapped in the happy illusions of a prince, going out into the world to confront the illusions of her culture, and, surprisingly, even in this tawdry surface world, she is able to discover some of the depth of suffering of humanity.  The movie plays up the silliness and contrasts of these surface worlds, but in the end, through her trials, I think we all glimpse something deeper, the wheel of samsara, turning beneath everyone.  This unexpected depth, I think, gives this movie a bit of pathos (especially with the superb acting of the main character), that can wake us up and shake us a little.",1374192000,,922,4.714285714285714

The critic i read found the film's solace centered around the star and the story not being much...and this is true it is a kind of stereotyped story but if you listen to the audiotracks it is laced with serious aspects to it. I do congratulate the makers on putting intelligent commentary with such distinguishing comments as 'experience''contrast''atmosphere''socratic method''self realisation'...i don't know the book but i pioked up on these themes while watching the film,and these are all things to look at when watching a film,and right after i watched it i clicked on elvis at amazon,it must be all that 60's type clothing and
interest in fashions,that i recall from all my elvis movies years ago,and we can watch this film as those,in terms of fashions and hairstyles,and how people are reinvented in this way,and look in vogue,like 'elle' in the film at the start,so there's much more to the film then meets the eye and the contrast between california and boston sights,and the changes in atmosphere. At the beginning of film the Reese character is interested in latching onto a politician and becoming a 'part' of him, a political wife,but he drops her and being a smart person,she goes to harvard what with her 4.0 gpa and there is much comment on the school system,and how she begins to not want to be part of something else but to value herself,and begins life and relationships from there,how she becomes a modern woman,or better person,and this is gone over in the commentary. The film works though since the drama and conversation is good and dialogue funny,and ideas are never present but realized through the characters and not as ideas...there is much legalese and the court scenes
well realized and realistic,and listen to the song at film's end. Reese elicits and gets our sympathy in this film,or the film fails,you have to bond with characters in films or they don't work,perhaps what critic found in her being the whole show. Good minor characters are the hairdresser,and the small dog. Of course this great concern on self realization in modern life may make us wonder about the value of children in modern life,who are not surprising absent from this film not even pictured,we are too immersed in realizing ourselves which not only effect the character but the producers of this film,which is a realistic pastiche of our world.",1333584000,,2475,4.8534278959810875

The underlying messages are admirable: that you should not judge people based on initial appearances, and that women should create their own destinies, rather than passively hoping for ""happily ever after"" with the man of their dreams.

The main character, Elle, is very feminine, but also very smart and very resourceful and very strong. She's hardworking and honest and fiercely loyal. She sticks by her principles, even in the face of strong pressure to do otherwise. Over the course of the film, we see her progress from a girl whose happiness depends entirely upon someone else's behavior, to a woman consciously guiding her own future. Reese Witherspoon does a fine job with the role, playing up the comdedy without allowing the character of Elle to ever be a bimbo joke.

The only scenes that had me rolling my eyes were the ""bend and snap"" segment in the beauty shop, and a few moments in the final courtroom scene.

1640154,4,B00005O5CM,"I love Reese Witherspoon.  A lot of my friends kind of hate her, but I think she is comedic brilliance, and her creation of Elle Woods is just one of her many flawless brush strokes.  In fact, she alone takes this rather generic and at times reaching script and makes it one of the most delightful film experiences of the 00's.

I see its flaws, but they are forgivable thanks to Witherspoon.

Now, the general concept of this film is that of a young and airheaded hot chick named Elle who finds herself dumped by her boyfriend when he goes to Law School.  In an attempt to win him back, Elle decides to attend the same school and prove that she is more than a pretty face.  She meets lots of opposition in the form of a spiteful `new' girlfriend and a slew of fellow students who consider her a joke.  Instead of buckling though, Elle buckles down and puts in the work, proving to herself and to those who doubted her that her head is not as empty as they thought it was.

Like I said, this movie is a lot of fun.  It does have its dry moments though.  I personally found a lot of the `hair salon' sub-plot to be rather dull and distracting from the real story, which revolved around the school and the case Elle finds herself working on.  The predictable yet tacky teacher/student scenario that unfolds in the end was a little unnecessary, but what else do you expect from these kinds of films.

Predictable.

Thankfully, amidst all the familiarity lies a fantastic performance by a beacon of light that just illuminates every aspect of this film.  Reese Witherspoon takes the generic airhead girlfriend role and turns it on its head with brilliantly constructed, multi-layered character development.  She has her comedic timing down pat, making almost every facial twitch a comedic affair; but she also understands that dramatic tension needed to make Elle a relatable and sympathetic character.

Like I said, multi-layered.

As great as Witherspoon is (and I really mean great), she is not the only person here who puts in a commendable performance.  In fact, the entire ensemble works really well together.  I love Selma Blaire here.  I actually think she is a sorely underrated actress who I wish would get some better roles.  Her doe-like eyes balance out her permanent `snob' facial expression that helps add layers of depth to her cold exterior.  I heart her.  Luke Wilson and Matthew Davis are serviceable `boy toys' here, but the females definitely outshine here, including the hilarious Jennifer Coolidge (shining despite her dull plot points), Holland Taylor and Ali Larter.  Victor Garber is always a welcome addition to any ensemble as far as I'm concerned, despite my reservations on his eventual character arc.

Flawed by highly engaging and a lot of fun, this spectacularly acted teen comedy certainly deserves a place in any DVD library!",1275436800,,2856,4.7560975609756095

The fates collide to make Elle's first year at law school revolve around fashion knowledge more than habeas corpus.

1640159,4,B00005O5CM,"Not every movie has to be a film masterpiece, if every film was how boring would that be ? Legally Blonde is an unbeilevable tale of Elle Woods, a sorority head who has lost her boyfriend Warner because she isn't of his class. Not willing to give up the fight, she takes the LSATS and gets into Harvard Law where she gets introduced to a harsh, new, academic world were things are not handed to her. Adding insult to injury, Warner has moved on with Vivien a snobbish wealthy girl who tries to humiliate Elle by inviting her to a costume party where she is the only one wearing a costume !

This is where Elle begins to transform when she comes to realize that she's never going to be good enough for Warner and decides to become the best lawyer possible. This transformation is furthered when she staunchly defends the innocence of Brooke Windham-Taylor- a fellow Delta New amid murder charges and a law professor/defense attorney that beileves that she is gulty. The cementing action is when Callahan hits on her in his office and Elle showing self respect and discipline rebuffs him, than ironically ends up taking over the case after Emmit (whose always beileved in Elle.)tells the truth to Mrs. Windham, then everything comes full circle as Elle wins the case because of her background as a Delta New!

Witherspoon and Luke Wilson both play good, nice people and it's nice to see a Wilson brother NOT playing someone stupid. There are stupid parts in here, but you get that in any comedy. There are also some very clever lines in there, too, but overall it's pretty low-brained material.....just played for fun.

There are definitely some funny scenes and it's diverting. The idea that it presents a good message for girls about working to achieve goals and being true to yourself, though . . . I have to warn you, girls in our daughter's high school were saying they wanted to be lawyers because this movie made a legal career seem fun and glamorous and exciting. Our daughter told them, ""Are you crazy? My parents are lawyers. I KNOW better."" I suppose at some sad level, being inspired to attend law school by Elle Woods is no more naive than being inspired to attend law school by Atticus Finch, but at least Atticus Finch lost his big case. Don't be fooled. Even if you enjoy the intellectual challenge and have pleasant colleagues and are lucky enough to handle an occasional case that affects public policy or helps someone with a problem, law is mostly a lot of hard work under mountains of paper with cases dragging on for months or years and ending in settlements where justice is neither entirely served nor entirely undermined. That's assuming you don't do family law which is truly from hell. Unless you're at the very top of the food chain, it's not even all that remunerative. The lawyers who make the most money usually represent the most unsavory clients. Lawyers have very high rates of depression and substance abuse compared to the general population. And nobody wears hot pink suits with stilettos and accessory dogs to court.

How dare he say Elle wasn't smart?! Now Elle is determined to go to Harvard to study Law(where Warner just happens to be going) to win her man back!

With the help of her sorority sisters, her dog bruiser and some well timed mani-pedis Elle gets into harvard, but it will take a lot more then just that to get her through difficult classes, snotty teachers, and the biggest obstacle, Warner's new fiance Vivian(Selma Blair).

Elle even gets one of four internship spots at an elite law firm for a big case, involving a fellow Delta Nu! She even gets to work with Emmett(Luke Wilson) a sweet and mature advisor on the case.

1640171,5,B00005O5CM,"Based on the novel of the same name by Amanda Brown, this 2001 comedy is about the losses and gains  experienced by a priviledged young woman from California, and her ultimate self-empowerment.
 Elle Woods(as played by a multi-dimensional Reese Witherspoon) is the President of her Sorority, Delta Nu. A neighbor of TV producer Aaron Spelling during her formative years, her world revolves around fashion and frivolity, although  we see signs of underlying intelligence when a sales clerk who views her as ""a dumb blonde with Daddy's plastic"" is taught a lesson.
 We meet the beloved Sorority Queen on the day she expects a proposal from her long-time boy friend, Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis). Instead of a marriage proposal, Warner breaks up with Elle during their evening out, explaining that his family back East expect a lot from him, and that marrying a ""Jackie"" instead of a ""Marilyn"" will be more conducive to his family's desires, if he wants to be a Senator.
  The spurned young woman spends the next few days behind the closed doors of her dorm room, with only her chiahuahua/favorite accessory Bruiser (Moonie) for companionship. Her stereotypically ditzy sorority sisters, Margot and Serena (Jessica Caufiell, Alanna Ubach) finally draw her out of her pink cocoon, and take her for a manicure. There is a comical moment where Serena converses in Chinese with a manicurist, which gives her a little more depth. While reading a ""Fox and Hound"" magazine in the waiting room, Elle sees a photo of Warner's brother with his fiancee, breifly discusses the fiancee's credentials with the customer sitting next to her(Natalie Barish), and decides to attend Harvard Law School to win Warner back.
 Elle's parents (James Read, and Tane McClure) are not very encouraging in this endeavor, nor is her advisor (Allyce Beasley) as Elle does not have the academic background for it.  Still, she passes her LSAT test, and sends and admissions video, for which it requires some suspension of disbelief to think that the pop-eyed, bow-tied Admissions Committee would deem acceptable.
 Elle creates quite a stir upon her arrival at Harvard, but remains fairly oblivious to comments and stares about her eccentricities in manner and dress.
 She finally locates Warner, who is stunned that she got into Harvard, and during a class for which she is ill-prepared, is shown up by a small, pallid, mahogony-tressed Vivian Kensington(Selma Blair), whom, to her great distress, she learns is Warner's fiancee.
 Along the way, she receives help and advice from Emmett Richmond (a well-cast, kind, and encouraging Luke Wilson, whose performance hits all the right notes), and a cathartic chat with manicurist Paulette Bonafonte (Jennifer Coolidge), which will be bright spots along her journey.
 Gradually, she overcomes rejection and humiliation by her classmates through perseverance, and attention to details others neglect, winning friends and influencing people.
 She helps Paulette with a legal matter, and in getting a date with a handsome UPS guy (Bruce Thomas), and the mutual friendship between the law student and manicurist is a delightful cornerstone of this film.
 Gradually, Vivian warms to her, and the two share a laugh about Warner's idiosyncracies.
 One of Elle's more intriguing classmates--the character as well as the actor himself-- is the sweet, awkward David Kidney, portrayed by Oz Perkins, with the eyes of his father, Anthony, who does great justice to his acting pedigree. Sadly, he would only have a little more than a month to enjoy the success of this film before enduring the shattering loss of his mother, Berry Berenson, in the 9-11 Disaster.
  Elle's opinionatedness in Professor Callahan's(Victor Garber's)class appears to earn her an internship with Callahan's law firm, and she, Warner, Vivian, David, and Enid Wexler(Meredith Scott Lynn) work on a murder case under Callahan's supervison. The task also reunites Elle with Emmett.
 The case is a high profile one involving  the slaying of a wealthy 60-year-old man, allegedly by  his young second wife, Brooke Taylor Windham (Ali Larter), a member of Elle's sorority, and a wealthy fitness instructor of whom Elle was once a student.
 Raquel Welch appears as the ex-wife of the murdered man, with a perfect upper-crust accent, Linda Cardellini is her daughter, Chutney, and Greg Serano is the pool boy, Enrique Salvatore.
 There are comical moments when Elle tries to coax an alibi from Brooke, bringing her a basket of beauty aids and "" the Bible"" (a copy of ""Cosmopolitan"" magazine), and later discovers evidence to discredit a witness in a way that only a Cosmo Girl can, with Emmett sneaking up on his blind side in the process.
 Elle suffers a major setback when she discovers the real reason Callahan wanted her as an intern, but Professor Stromwell(Holland Taylor) goads Elle into having a bit more backbone and stick-to-itiveness.
 Brooke fires Callahan, and hires Elle, who under Emmett's supervision, solves the case, much to her own amazement and everyone else's.
 Warner, whose true character has been revealed throughout the film in subtle and not-so-subtle ways, finally views Elle as a worthy marriage partner, but Elle has her own ideas about their future relationship.

After weeks of friend's concern, manicures, and moping Elle realizes that the only way to get Warner back is to become a serious girlfriend, meaning starting a career in law at Harvard.

The casting is great, especially Selma Blair's drop-jaw performance as her rival who later becomes her friend; the way the title character who invests all her dreams in a man goes out to become studied to win him and then decides that she's better off without him anyway. The way innocence sometimes is able to accomplish things in a laconic manner that the pretentious are not able to. All these things speak of universal truths down through the centuries dressed in pink shades of fluff that make it palatable for everyone.

I was impressed by not merely the fast pacing of the movie, but its ability to avoid dwelling on a cuteness that it's unashamed to promulgate and which it does packing socially astute observations; such as the scene with the shy lawyer being rebuffed by two enamoratas who are suddenly swayed by the fact that after all another woman gives him amorous currency.

 The classroom scenes are fun too. All in all a well-made, fun film with a good message of empowerment for young women, and for everyone else for that matter.

1640178,3,B00005O5CM,"""Legally Blonde"" (2001) directed by Robert Luketic stars Reese Witherspoon as Elle Woods - a Californian golden girl who has it all - she is blonde, pretty, popular, adored by her wealthy parents and her friends in college where she is the president of her sorority. As we know from the movies, gentlemen prefer blondes but alas not a gentleman whom Elle is dating and expecting him to propose any minute. Instead, as the movie turns, the blondes also have blues because they are not taken seriously by the men from the blue blood families. When the object of Elle's desire heads off to Harward Law School, she decided to get him back by proving that the blondes have ""a head for business and a bod for sin. Is there anything wrong with that?"" The first step for Elle was to get admitted to the same school, and she did it. But that was only the beginning...

You know, I've seen ""Legally Blonde"" several times and I know that it is not the best movie ever made, far from it but I like it. I am not a Witherspoon's fan, I don't find her a stunning beauty but she is a talented young actress who brought a certain charm to the role. I am also a true believer that ""happy people just don't kill their husbands, they just don't"" and I like how Reese delivers this piece of wisdom. The second Blonde movie is a different matter altogether and belongs to the category of absolutely useless sequels.

1640183,5,B00005O5CM,"I rented this video expecting a cute, mindless piece of fluff for a relaxing evening's entertainment. What I got was so much more than I bargained for. True, many of the plot twists are pure far-fetched fantasy, but the basic premise was solid, and worked a charm. The primary conflict of the story line was certainly original - New England conservatism vs Left Coast consumerism is not a motif we find every decade, much less every day, in a film of any genre, and certainly not in a comedy of this nature. The gradual maturing of a group of college graduates from widely different backgrounds, as they pursue their dreams and goals at Harvard Law School could have been an excuse for a morass of schtick and slapstick. Instead, it was a sensitive, if amusing coming of age for all the protagonists, including, in the end analysis, some of the older characters.

The acting was above average; it takes enormous skill to play a rle like Elle Woods - intelligent, determined and resourceful while appearing a stereotypical blonde bimbo - and play it convincingly. And if some (most, actually!) of the serendipities of the plot were less than convincing, some great acting and quite exceptional dialog made up for the poor underpinnings. I'm not a great fan of Reese Witherspoon, but certainly appreciate the panache with which she pulled this one off. There were also some sterling supporting performances, notably by Selma Blair as the rival, who gradually evolves from a horsey country-clubber into a stunning beauty as the film progresses (with appropriate character development from a snooty bitch to a warm friend).

I was particularly impressed by some of the photography in this production. Pay close attention to the shadows in the poolside scene with the Woods family at the beginning of the film! Later, the private interview between Elle and Professor Callahan shows just how much can be conveyed in a handful of seconds of outstanding camera work. And the elevator scene immediately following gets my vote as one of the finest pieces of cinema photography of 2001.

There aren't many films that I would consider worth watching more than once, and even fewer that I have liked enough to want to own them. This one is going to find its way into my personal collection.",1170633600,2,2277,4.86340206185567

1640186,3,B00005O5CM,"No matter how much or little you've heard of this film, you should by now be aware of one thing: its main point is, or seems to be, proving that blondes aren't stupid. Am I the only one who believes it didn't do as good a job proving that point as it could have? I happen to be a blonde and I think I'm a reasonably intelligent one, thank you. However, I do not a) love shopping b) know every shoe type or c) adore pink. And yet, this movie seems determined to prove that those three things are what all blondes do. Excuse me if I don't find that flattering or hilarious. I appreciate clever comedies as much as the next person, but if someone expected me to either lavishly praise this movie or say something along the lines of, ""Oh, this movie's SUCH a credit to blondes everywhere!"", it ain't gonna happen. As cute and clever as it sometimes was, this movie failed to impress me on any particular level.

Brief summary: Elle is a very clever young woman who actually decides to choose law school over lounging in a pool all year at her parent's mansion. Before you get too impressed, though, Elle mainly did this to win back her boyfriend, not because she'd always dreamed of being a lawyer (then again, maybe that's a point in her favor). In spite of her partially shallow motives, however, she excells in law school, blows away many of her classmates, and proves to have far more brains than many gave her credit for. The story does very well by portraying not only Elle's clever and sometimes hilarious tactics, but her own personal struggle as she tries to fit in with the other students and recover from her boyfriend's cruel treatment. However, its pitfalls come from painfully goofy moments, even more painfully stupid characters, and, occasionally, the same message that it seems to attempt to disprove: that blondes aren't automatically dumb.

While Elle's definitely smart, she is also occasionally an undeniable bimbo. She still dedicates too much time to her looks, dresses in hot pink almost 24/7 (including a sexy-bunny costume to a party and a frilly dress to a TRIAL), and dresses up her lapdog (gag). If the film really wanted to prove that Elle was smart, it could have done without the blondes-are-bimbos stereotype too and given Elle a little more common sense. Two examples: when her first client (a woman suspected of killing her husband) tells Elle that her only alibi to the murder was getting a lipo-suction and she simply can't bear to reveal this to the public, Elle, rather than reminding her that a prison sentence is worse than losing what's left of her reputation, says ""Your secret is safe with me"" in a sickeningly reassuring tone. (Your Honor, I'd like to take this moment to point out that Elle's client was blonde too, so her rather stupid reason to not reveal her alibi, and Elle's even dumber understanding of it came off to me as two blondes sharing a ""blonde moment"", which rather contradicted the movie's whole point, don't you think?)

Another example was when Elle, hearing two strange girls cruelly reject a boy who asked one of them out, walked up to the boy and loudly asked him why he didn't call her after giving her the best sex of her life. She then stalked off, leaving the two mean girls far more interested in him than they were a few moments ago. My question: why did she bother trying to impress the two witches when she could have just told them off? Much of the story supports the idea that you should credit people for their inner character, so WHY did Elle try to uplift the guy in his crush's eyes after the way she treated him? I was left very disappointed in Elle and furious at the scene's shallow message.

My main peeve with the film, other than the fact that it seemed to say that even smart blondes can't help being fashionably obsessed and fluffy-brained, was that Elle was surrounded by people ten times dumber and shallower than any human has the right to be. Take Elle's client, who she seemed to be so fond of; with her shallow attraction to her pool man (which she almost proudly admitted to in her own trial), her marriage to a guy twice her age, and the fact that she was willing to risk going to prison rather than revealing the fact that she had lipo-suction, I rather hoped she'd be convicted; her extreme shallowness and utter lack of common sense was so infuriating, she almost completely undid any good that Elle gave to the ""blonde community"" in the movie. Elle's mother was also tide-pool deep and was shocked that Elle would want to go to law school when she could just laze around in her money. And Elle's friends...well, let's just say that if any person that dumb existed in the real world, they couldn't survive on their own. And yet, people praise the movie for its cleverness. Yes, it's definitely clever in some points, but it also suffers from the extreme annoyance that some of its dumber-than-dirt characters exude. Some good messages, some cute moments, but nothing truly deep or real. Fluffy entertainement with some substance, but don't expect a Harvard degree behind the scriptwriting.",1158537600,2,5086,4.622787610619469
1640187,4,B00005O5CM,"I've been reviewing items for Amazon for a little over a year and a half, now. One of the things that I still don't quite understand is how Amazon picks its ""Spotlight Reviews.""

Sometimes those Reviews are great. But, sometimes...

Okay. Here are excerpts from the current Spotlight Reviews for this film (though they may be different by the time you read this):

""I was disappointed by this film. I was hoping it was going to be a satire, a la 'Clueless'. When I realized in the first 15 minutes or so that it was not, then I at least hoped it would be funny in any kind of way (e.g. dumb funny). Well, it didn't even do that.[...]"" -- First Spotlight Review

""As a blonde myself, I really should have been offended by this feature-length blonde joke, but hey, this flick is first-rate fluff.[...]The script is surprisingly smart for fluff and is a huge reason for the success of this extended blonde joke. For mindless entertainment, you can't beat this film. 'Legally Blonde' is one of those guilty pleasures you might hate to admit having. Remember, you can always watch it in the privacy of your own home[...]."" -- Second Spotlight Review (from a ""Top 100 Reviewer"" no less)

Uh...

Maybe it's me.

But I don't think that either of these two reviewers get this film. Legally Blonde is not a movie trying to make fun of blondes. What would even be the point of that? Nor is it a ""dumb comedy,"" nor is it trying to be. It is not an extended blonde joke. It is not mindless. Nor is, as the second above reviewer mentioned in her write-up, the main character (Elle) mindless.

In fact, the point of the film is that she has a mind. The point is that, despite being blonde and pretty, she still has other skills and abilities (and an incredible amount of compassion and kindness) that people unfairly overlook or dismiss. This is a movie with a heart, a mind, and, my friends, a message. The message isn't devastatingly clever or anything like that, but it's a good, solid one, nonetheless. And, it appears to have been too subtle for the reviewers quoted above.

Usually, this kind of movie is about a nerd or other outcast who falls in love with a beauty and gets unfairly discriminated against by the popular kids on account of his appearance, etc. This is the exact same film, except the roles are reversed. In this movie, the beautiful, pampered prima-donna is trying her darndest to fit in with the smart kids (the nerds) but is constantly rejected on the basis of the same sorts of shallow, prejudicial judgements from which they typically suffer. When she competes for an internship, everyone assumes that she won't have the brains to pull it off. When she gets that internship based on her skills, people assume that she must have slept her way to the top. Along the way, she is constantly humiliated and made fun of, on a large part based on the color of her hair and the way she dresses. We're not supposed to be laughing at her, people; we're supposed to be sympathizing with her (unless, like the cruel ""nerds"" she encounters, we're too tied up in people's looks).

Whether or not you're particularly receptive to it, this movie is trying to say that we all suffer from rejection, ostracization and prejudice--even the pretty and popular.

Even though the Spotlight Reviews here on Amazon might not reflect the fact, this is not a ""mindless extended blonde-joke,"" nor is it a failed Clueless; this is a story about an outsider fighting for love and struggling to fit in, and yes, she happens to be blonde and pretty and wear lots of pink. To understand it, I guess, requires at least as much heart as the film was made with.",1154908800,115,3638,4.564417177914111
1640188,4,B00005O5CM,"When I first saw this movie with my teenage son, I admit that my expectations were not particularly high. Was I ever pleasantly surprised by this delightfully funny comedy! Reese Witherspoon does a star turn as the not so dumb, California airhead blonde, Ellie Woods, who is dumped by her college sweetheart, Warner, before graduation, instead of getting the anticipated and expected marriage proposal. It appears that he has political aspirations and an ostensibly dumb and flamboyant blonde is not what he envisions having for a wife.

Seeking to prove herself worthy and knowing that he is planning on attending Harvard Law School, Ellie, a fashion major, also seeks admission with dogged determination and studies her charming buns off in order to do well on the LSAT, the Law School Admission Test. Her high LSAT scores, coupled with her hilarious admission video, and her perfect college grade point average, albeit in Fashion, get her through the portals of Harvard Law School, and the games begin in earnest.

What happens to her at Harvard is hilarious, as Ellie tries to get her former sweetheart back. She discovers, instead, something about herself that ultimately makes others sit up and take notice of her in a positive way. Reese Witherspoon is delightfully funny doing a comic turn and will have the viewer laughing almost immediately, while rooting for her. The supporting cast is likewise enjoyable.

1640190,4,B00005O5CM,"""Legally Blonde"" starring Reese Witherspoon is escapism fluff, but it never tries to be anything more than that and maybe for that reason, it succeeds and is two hours of fun.

Upon arriving at Harvard, she finds that Warner has a new fiancee, the more appropriate Vivian (Selma Blair), and that her blonde perkiness makes her an outsider.  She makes friends with the shy manicurist in town (Jennifer Coolidge) with her own man problems, and finds an ally in Emmett (Luke Wilson), an associate who works with one of her professors.

What makes this movie work is Reese Witherspoon.  Her Elle is so likable - - she is ditzy, yes, but in a good natured way, and her heart is in the right place.  And by the end, she is proven to be smart and intelligent.

I know this is supposed to be a feel good movie but come on everyone has to admit it is more stupid than anything. And I can't believe Reese wants to be remembered like that. Thankfully she has done other movie roles that are much better.

Anyway, for people who have not seen it, don't expect much intellectual stimulation. It's pretty simple and foolish and Reese acts like the stereotypical blonde in the beginning who becomes smart in the end- case closed basically.",1139270400,3,872,4.310975609756097
1640196,4,B00005O5CM,"You can push people only so far before they begin to fight back.  When this movie was made, blondes were one of the few groups left in America that it was safe to bash, belittle and discriminate against.  Someone decided enough was enough.

The woman they selected to lead the fight could not have been better chosen.  Reese Witherspoon had already played characters that, whatever else they might be, were not ones to take any crap from anybody.  Reese played Elle with all the vulnerability, all the tender-heartedness that a real Elle would have; but when it came to getting what she wanted, she was prepared to go a long way, even if it meant buying a computer (Ugh!) and going to law school (Double-ugh!).

But a strange thing happened along the way.  Elle discovered that she was not as dumb as she thought she was.  She could compete with the best of them and still keep her own values.  By the end of this journey, Elle (and the viewer) has learned that sometimes what or who you wanted wasn't as great as you thought he was, and you can do a lot better, because now you are more capable, more knowledgeable, and smarter than you were a few years before.

The filmmakers obviously didn't want to be so uncool as to take sides, so there is still a lot of blonde bashing in this movie; but there are moments that are funny, moments that are touching, and an ending that is satisfying.

Reese Witherspoon became a mega-star with this movie, and she wasn't one to quit either.  She started her own production company, put up the money to make Legally Blonde 2 and continues to be a major Hollywood star.  In a poll on [...] Reese was voted the most popular actress of 2005.",1138924800,2,1677,4.459016393442623

Elle (Reece Witherspoon) is the stereotypical dizzy blonde rich girl.  She is attending college to get her MRS.  And she thought she found Mr. Rich Right.  But on what she thinks is her big night, she finds out that he is dumping her.  She goes into a depression until she decides to get her guy back.  The best way to do this is get admitted to the law school he is going to attend, Harvard.

The scenes of her studying for the LSAT are hilarious and her admission video is even better.  (Now in reality, this would not be possible - this has to be done at least a year in advance, not over the summer).

Elle arrives at Harvard and is assessed by everyone as the dizzy blonde that she is.  But more important to Elle is that she never fail.  And she takes everything by storm.

The best part of the film is when Elle is selected to assist on a high profile murder case.  Not only does she blow the main prosecution witness out of the water but she solves the murder.

This film is light as fluff but it is great fluff.  Reece Witherspoon shines as Elle and is worth the price of admission.

Now Elle is trying to become a lawyer, to become the girl that her ex-boyfriend is looking for.  The movie is funny and entertaining, combining an original storyline with the typical story about a comical heroine that everybody loves.  There was hardly a dull moment in the entire movie, and now I can't wait to see the sequel!  There is some sexual talk, fairly bad language every now and then, and of younger children viewing, hence the PG-13 rating.

The movie begins to the song ""Perfect Day"" which really sets the mood. Elle is going out with a handsome, smart guy named Warner Huntington. Thinking he is going to propose to her, she buys a 'perfect' dress and meets him at the fancy restuarant he is taking her to, only to find out he is dumping her because he is going to Harvard Law School and wants to start a more serious life. Elle is heartbroken and devastated, so when she reads about a woman who is more Warner's 'serious type', she decides she is going to go to Harvard to so she can win him back!

I'm not going to give away all the good parts, but I must tell you, if you are wanting to get a fresh, funny, and totally blonde kind of movie, RENT (if you have not seen it yet) OR BUY THIS! You will laugh and if your a sensitive kind of person maybe even cry too. The acting is great, although I think the Warner guy could have done better. But Reese Witherspoon, being the great actress she is, totally makes this movie totally perfect!

If your a girl between the ages of 13 and up, you'll definitely love this. It's a really girly, chick flick type movie basically about a girl who goes very far for her man.

After weeks of friend's concern, manicures, and moping Elle realizes that the only way to get Warner back is to become a serious girlfriend, meaning starting a career in law at Harvard.

The message is never judge a book by it's cover, and the stereotype blondes are airheads is obviously not true.

The whole time her boyfriend would not accept her for who she was, and no guy is worth that. If he can't see all your qualities and love you for who you are he isn't worth it. It's mainly because of our brainwashed stereotypical narrowminded judgmental society that forces people to prove themselves to others. When the fact of the matter is, you know who you are and that's all that matters. Forget everyone else. I myself don't give a dam what others think.

It seemed she was destined for great things, and even though LEGALLY BLONDE is nothing more than a wisp of a movie, Reese's radiance carries the movie and makes it a highly enjoyable diversion.  She plays a somewhat ditzy blonde whose snobby boyfriend (an effective Matthew Davis) breaks up with her as he prepares to enter Harvard.  She decides to show him she's not so dumb and manages to get into Harvard's law school herself.  She meets a handsome law professor (Luke Wilson), and finds herself favored by the program's chief (Victor Garber), and also confronted with Davis' new love (Selma Blair).  Holland Taylor is very good as Reese's mentor professor and the whole thing is as predictable as day and night, but it's a showcase for Reese, who ends up defending an aerobics instructor (Ali Larter) in the murder case of her wealthy husband.  The film has some wonderful comic moments and it spawned a sequel.  I enjoyed its lightheartedness and Witherspoon's appeal.",1118534400,,1073,4.862637362637362
1640209,4,B00005O5CM,"In my experience with college teaching, I've realized that blonde Barbie looks and a bubbly persona do not necessarily come with cotton-candy brains. At face value, ""Legally Blonde"" is fun and frothy. However,  the movie exhorts us to look behind a person embodying a stereotype to see an individual.

Elle Woods, Sorority president, decides to follow ex-boyfriend Warner Huntington, III to Law school. This East Coast blueblood has decided to put his carefree college years  firmly behind him and has set himself on the path to the U.S. Senate. Obviously, a frolicksome blonde does not fit into the picture and is conveniently disposed of before the ascent to the hallowed halls of Harvard Law. His jaw literally drops in surprise to see that the selfsame blonde has gained admission to his exclusive program!

Warner is not the only one who does not quite know what to make of the walking, talking Ivy League Barbie; neither do the other students or even the professors. This speaks to the power of stereotypes in our culture. I also noticed a subtle but pervasive attitude towards attractive young females I've personally observed in academia: that of being objects simultaneously of desire and derision.

In the end, it is Elle's knowledge of a cosmetic procedure that nails the guilty in a court case. The very attribute that is often seen as a liability by her peers ends up being her trump card. The last laugh, therefore, is on those who purportedly claim to impart impartial judgement but misjudged HER. This sly turnaround collectively pokes fun at the pretentions of extreme feminism and academia in general - mainly at the notions that style and substance are mutually contradictory attributes and that analytical thinking necessarily comes in a grim, no-frills package. Whether or not you decide to delve into the deeper significance of this movie, it does not detract from its entertainment value.",1111190400,2,1911,5.034810126582278

1640217,4,B00005O5CM,"Watching this film after twelve months of Film Studies AS forced me to take a critical approach to Legally Blonde. All together, the film is pretty damn good, especially if you want to relax and watch a real Girl Power movie!

Reese Witherspoon makes a fantastic Elle Woods. I can't imagine anyone who would play the part better. Personally, I think she is one of the most talented actresses in Hollywood, with her acting range impressive and each character played with prescision and individuality. Just look at her portrayal of Elle Woods, a bubbly homecoming queen, delta nu and Bel Air socialite in comparison to her acting in, say, The Importance of Being Earnest or Cruel Intentions. She is an inspirational actress, and it is not due to her capability that I am not giving this film the full five.

Okay, the film is absolutly hillarious and I adore Jennifer Coolidge as Paulette Bonafonte. They make such a great duo, and you can see them feeding off each other as the film progresses. I cherised the idea of Elle as the mentor to older Paulette, showing her the way of life she should have and helping her to regain herself - it showed the depth of Elle's character (in a less obvious way than her law school success)and her desire to pass on her 'knowledge' to those who need it.

However, there are things about the film that I felt jarred me a little bit:

1#  I feel that maybe Raquel Welch could have been more convincing in the part of Chutney's mother, Mrs. Windham Vandermark. She was okay, but I wasn't quite convinced.

2#  I don't know why, but something about the female Law teacher in the Salon... you know that scene? Something about it didn't quite fit.

Other than that, there's really not many points I can pick with the film. So it's predictable, obviously 'staged' at times and over the top, but hey! That's all the fun, isn't it? It is a great film, not an absolute masterpeice, but it will definatly always remain a part of my collection.

Oh, but unless you already have, don't bother watching the sequal. It's like a completley different film... it's really quite bad.",1104883200,3,2100,4.60857908847185
1640218,3,B00005O5CM,"""Legally Blonde"" is an amusing movie, with a very charismatic central character, Elle Woods (played by Reese Witherspoon), a beautiful blonde girl who seems to know very little about everything, except shopping and designer clothes. Reese carries the weight of this film over her shoulders, and she is the main reason why ""Legally Blonde"" works fine.

 The plot is not complex, but it's charming and amusing. The characters are kinda standard (Elle Woods being the exception): you got the pretty boy who pretends to be more than he actually is, you got the mean girl that hates the good girl, but eventually they become good friends, you got the ugly guy with good heart and big brain, you got the good guy that wins the heart of the good girl, and so on. But this movie works because even though the characters aren't exactly original, the situations, some jokes and the charisma of the cast are notable.

 Obviously, the main reason to see ""Legally Blonde"" is Reese Witherspoon, her performance is charming, and that translates into a lovable character...oh, by the way, Reese Witherspoon looks stunning in this movie.

1640219,4,B00005O5CM,"This movie is a classic -- and a classic example of ""you can't catch lightning in a bottle twice"" (the sequel was dreadful).  It sets out to be a totlally formula movie -- then violates the formula at every possible point.  Is Reese Witherspoon a great actress?  No.  But she carries this role -- including the transition between CULA and Harvard Law School.  Even the idea that she doesn't get her boyfriend back at the end because she DOESN'T WANT HIM is fresh and original.  And who can forget the director pulling the camera back from her pool-scene video admissions essay to that room full of Harvard ""suits"" discussing why she should be admitted.

The script is intelligent, and if it includes a few logical holes, so what?  It carries them off.  I have to say that the actress (I don't remember her name) who played Brooke Taylor Windham was wonderful.  Her innocence, her unaltering faith in Elle, and so on were understated and believable.

But of all the bits in the film, the most brilliant (aside from uncovering that the pool boy was gay) was the use of Racquel Welch as Windham's ex-wife.  Glamour woman extraordinaire, and the first look we have of her is in the mud-room in a spa, wrapped in a blanket, with a mud-pack on her face and a cucumber slice in each eye.  It takes an actor with a real sense of the absurd to parody herself like that.

Oh, yes.  The resolution of the plot may have been absurd too, but it hangs together logically.  Quite a coup, considering the light touch of the whole film.

This is just one of a thousand things that aren't realistic or plausible in the movie. So what!?

A girl gets crushed by a jerk. Pulls herself up by her own bootstraps (color coordinated and in the correct fabric, of course). Makes it ""her way"".

1640228,5,B00005O5CM,"Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon, ""Election"") is your average dumb blonde. Living in a sorority, Elle shops, talks, and is obsessed with pink like any other girl. Even though she's rich, there's one thing she has that she can't buy with money--her charming boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis, ""Pearl Harbor"". But when Warner suddenly dumps her because he wants a ""smart"" girlfriend, Elle is determined to prove him wrong by getting into Harvard.

Surprisingly, Elle gets enough good grades to make it into Harvard! But unfortunately for her, everyone there makes fun of her because she's too ""pink."" However, everything's about to change. Elle is picked to be a lawyer for a real trial. And if she can make it through this case, she'll be able to prove that there's more to blonde than meets the eye.

LEGALLY BLONDE is such a funny movie, and it will get a laugh out of everyone. It may seem like just another teen movie, but it has everything to make a perfect comedy. Something I really liked about the movie was that the acting was great, although Reese Witherspoon improved as the movie went. So all in all, I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good time.",1094947200,,1165,4.705882352941177
1640229,5,B00005O5CM,"""Legally Blonde"" is a great movie with great, albeit predictable, characters.  However, director Robert Luketic found a way to balance a current formula for box office success (pretty, young cast + quick-witted dialogue + feel-good dream achievement) with some subtler messages for the thinking people out there.

For example, as anyone who has taken the LSAT knows, Elle's whole admittance to Harvard Law is a farce.  But, the movie doesn't try to make it realistic.  Instead, Elle gets a forty point LSAT score boost (that would be like doubling your SAT score), somehow garners letters of recommendation, and then sends in a video essay.  Luketic is reminding us to suspend our disbelief, something too often forgotten in an industry sometimes too preoccupied with spectacular special effects. In this development, we see a couple of Luketic's strokes of ingenuity.  First, Elle's parents are not just rote characters like those of the movie--they're the ultimate stock characters, and discourage Elle from attending law school because it is for boring, ugly people.  These characters aren't just for the hyperbole laugh, but seem to be nodding to the audience--""yeah, we realize the story line and characters may be familiar to you, but we're not going to bore you here, in fact, have a laugh at our expense.""  Then, Elle's video essay also has some interesting satirical elements.  As the admissions committee discusses Elle's application, the frame of the film cuts off part of the television on which Elle's admission video just played.  So, you see an old white dude making a decision for one of the world's most competitive programs with ONLY Elle's bikini-clad body on the screen behind him.  The old men are making a case for her GPA and LSAT scores, but the cut suggests that something less academic may be influencing their decision.  This scene raises several questions: First, should women be allowed to use their sexuality as a weapon when entering male-dominated spheres?  Second, how aware is anyone of the factors they may be manipulating to their advantage?  Elle was only behaving as she always had.  And, is there a real difference between Elle's getting in on her swimsuit performance and Warner, as we learn later, getting in on his father's connections?

This is a great movie to own for its popular entertainment value, the pleasure of watching it more than once, and, if you need an excuse, scholarly excursions like those discussed above.",1094601600,2,2466,5.066831683168317

Reese plays a very typical blonde who decides to go to law school to win back her boyfriend that dumped her.  As predicted, she falls on her face in the beginning, being scorned and made fun of by her fellow classmates.  She then summons her learning powers and rises to the top.  In the end, everyone is happy...but the old boyfriend who dumped her in the first place!

1640233,3,B00005O5CM,"I was expecting this movie to be full of dumb blonde jokes, but was pleasantly surprised. Considering I'm naturally dark, and dye my hair as dark as possible, I'm never gonna be blonde, and it probably wouldn't suit me. But I do have what people would call my ""blonde moments"" where I say/do something stupid. I don't see why brunettes can't be labelled a bit daft at times too! Cos I definitely am!
This movie is carried by a strong cast: Reese Witherspoon, Selma Blair, Stifler's Mom from American Pie, Ali Larter, Thomas Andrews from Titanic, and many more! My faves out of the cast have to be Ali Larter and Stifler's Mom! They stole the movie out from underneath Reese Witherspoon.
What is amazing about this movie, is the sheer amount of time spent on Reese's hair (which looks suspiciously like extensions). Throughout the movie, she has a mere 40 different hairstyles, which sometimes feels like a different hairstyle for each scene of the movie. Reese also wears a lot of different clothes for each scene, a lot of them with something pink in them, which she all got to KEEP after this was finished shooting! Free clothes, alright for some!
Once again, Selma Blair comes across as a bit of an ice queen in her role as Vivian, but you'll be glad to hear, the ice melts before the end of the movie!
What didn't I see coming in this movie? What Victor Garber's character really turns out to be. And trust me, he's not as nice in this, as he was in Titanic.
There is a sequel too, which I'm sure I'll manage to get my hands on eventually. And Stifler's Mom comes back for that too! That's how good her role is! But this is basically a feel good movie, which shows you don't need to change for anybody.",1089763200,,1706,4.453674121405751

1640236,4,B00005O5CM,"Of course this film's plot is preposterous, but LEGALLY BLONDE (2001) is so much fun that you just sit back and go with the flow. Reese Witherspoon completes her long-in-the-making climb up to superstardom with her infectious portrayal of pink-loving, Valley Girl-talking, beauty-minded, hopelessly optomistic, quintessential blonde Elle Woods. Before this role, Reese had co-starred in a string of successful films---PLEASANTVILLE (1998), CRUEL INTENTIONS and ELECTION (both 1999)---but with LEGALLY BLONDE, she has cemented her place in film history. As with Arnold Schwarzenegger The Terminator, Macauley Culkin the Home Alone Kid, Reese Witherspoon will forever be the Legally Blonde Chick.  This is not a bad thing, because Reese is such a talented actress that I do not believe that she will succumb to being typecast. Plus, it sure didn't hurt that she received a whopping $15 million paycheck for LEGALLY BLONDE 2!
In this first installment, Elle Woods is a bubblelicious Delta Nu sorority queen and soon-to-be-graduating senior at UCLA looking forward to having her blueblood boyfriend Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis) propose to her at the beginning. But instead he dumps her for being ""too blonde"" for him and his high political aspirations. He's going to Harvard Law School; she decides to study hard for the LSATs so that she can follow him to Harvard, show him that she *is* serious, and hopefully win him back. But, alas, once she makes it she learns that he's quickly moved on to another snooty blueblood Vivian Kensington (a well-cast Selma Blair). Of course, she eventually finds a mate of her own, the tall, dark and sensitive Emmett Richmond (Luke Wilson) and with his help, finds her place at Harvard Law, finds herself as an improbably brilliant legal mind, and ends up realizing that Warner's not the guy for her after all. The End. :)
Of course, it's not all quite as simple as that. Along the way, she makes good friends with her hairdresser Paulette (Jennifer Coolidge) who has self-esteem (read: men) issues. She even improbably bonds and makes friends with her ex's girlfriend Vivian, who apparently has a sense of humor lurking underneath her b*tch exterior. And the real kicker is that she is asked to work on a criminal case being fought by Professor Callahan (Victor Garber), and ends up winning it for him! (Again, in an improbable but most entertaining way.)
Obviously, LEGALLY BLONDE is a chick-flick fantasy and should not be taken as anything else. The reason why it's good is the same reason why *any* good comedy works: it's funny! The screenplay by Karen McCullah Lutz is smart and aware, apparently adapted from Amanda Brown's novel of the same name (didn't know that till recently).  The director, a previously unknown Aussie director named Robert Luketic (who now has scored a second hit with 2004's WIN A DATE WITH TAD HAMILTON!), keeps the pace upbeat. Of course, it helps that he has a good character to work with. Elle Woods is a cross between Cher from CLUELESS (1995) and Pollyanna from the 1960 film of the same name; she has such a glowing positiveness that is so infectious it rubs off on everybody. Even when she's crying over her lost boyfriend, she doesn't stay down for long. Even when she delivers a great comeback put-down line to her main female tormentor, she delivers it with such sunniness that she manages to stay on the high road. Everybody, including her detractors, comes out better for having known her. After watching this film, I feel that way, too.
RECOMMENDED, AGES 12 & UP

1640237,4,B00005O5CM,"As a blonde myself, I really should have been offended by this feature-length blonde joke, but hey, this flick is first-rate fluff. Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) is a self-absorbed sorority president and fashion major who expects to marry her college sweetheart Warner (Matthew Davis).  When Warner dumps her because she isn't the perfect accompaniment to his expected Harvard Law degree (too much Marilyn Monroe and not enough Jackie Kennedy), her whole world crashes around her until the solution hits her:  Why doesn't she become the woman Warner wants by following him to Harvard Law School?  To Elle, who has a specialty in The History of Polka Dots, this seems like a no-brainer, and since she doesn't seem to know how to use her brain, the hilarity begins.  She manages to get into Harvard through a brazen video, great LSAT's (for which she actually studied), and by stunning every last member of the admissions committee.
Who cares about realism when you've got a clueless blonde mixing with over-achieving, nerdy law students?  The always popular Elle becomes the class outcast, with a tongue-tied, good-hearted manicurist (played memorably by Jennifer Coolidge) as her only friend.  Director Luketic deserves enormous credit for keeping Elle's core personality intact despite the intellectual transformation; the sight of her colorful iMac in the sea of charcoal gray laptops is pitch-perfect as a symbol of her increasing seriousness but unwillingness to give into the nerd culture.  In her sorority house, Elle is but one of many blondes.  At Harvard, she is an individualist.
This film is completely preposterous and doesn't care - that's the fun of it.  Although the eventual triumph of Elle is predictable, how she gets there is not, making this film enjoyable every step of the way.  The script is surprisingly smart for fluff and is a huge reason for the success of this extended blonde joke.
For mindless entertainment, you can't beat this film.  ""Legally Blonde"" is one of those guilty pleasures you might hate to admit having.  Remember, you can always watch it in the privacy of your own home where no one but your closest relatives can hear you laugh at the antics of Elle Woods.",1085702400,39,2203,5.038567493112947

It begins with a light and lively isn't-it-great-to-be-young introduction, complete with plenty of the colorful materialism typical of yuppie films to dazzle the viewer and convince them they can actually buy this fantasy life for themselves.  The characters are each interesting, realistic, and unique, and there's a delightful little dog, Breezer, whose name symbolizes much.  Miss Witherspoon as Elle Woods is absolutely charming; personality plus and a warm heart.  However, the story's attempt to mock male chauvinism with a reverse stereotype approach--you can be blonde, frivolous AND highly successful in the professions--fails because it quickly embraces the impossible super woman ideal, where you must be thin, beautiful, rich, young, and vivacious--to really get anywhere in the world (so why try otherwise, girls?).  Perhaps proof of the pudding are Miss Wood's scathing public putdowns of her powerful opponents that, while an admirable stand for higher values,  would burn your bridges before you start.",1085184000,,1225,5.559139784946237

I wasn't very interested in Legally Blonde at first, but with all of the positive reviews and having a couple of friends who told me that I should give it a chance, I finally had the chance to rent the movie.  On one hand, it was exactly what I expected.  On the other hand, it was a pretty good movie.
Reese Witherspoon is Elle Woods, a senior in college who lives a life of privilege.  She is the pampered girl who was homecoming queen and was involved in all of the stereotypical activities.  She is the social queen, but nobody expects much out of her intellectually (though she pierces that bubble when talking about the fashion and the minutia regarding the industry).  She expects her boyfriend to propose to her, but instead he dumps her saying that he needs someone serious in his life if he expects to be in the Senate by age 30.  She is crushed and decides to follow him to law school and enroll herself (and show that she is a serious person).  She is actually accepted to Harvard Law School on the strength of her test scores and Harvard's desire to diversify a little (she really did qualify, though).
At first, Elle is treated like a joke but her determination wins through and she gains friends and respect.  In a way, that's what this movie is.  I thought it was going to be a joke and completely fluffy, but Reese (and the movie) tries so hard and is so likeable that I couldn't help but enjoy the movie.  I don't think that I would buy Legally Blonde, but it was an enjoyable movie to watch.  Everything turns out as you would expect it too (so don't expect to be surprised at anything), but Legally Blonde rises above that and is actually a pretty good movie.",1065657600,,1704,4.377777777777778
1640254,5,B00005O5CM,"I have to admit that this film is a guilty pleasure.  It rests on the shelf amidst my more distinguished DVD titles, but it has no need to feel ashamed; Legally Blonde probably gets more playtime than her neighbors.
Simply put, I love this movie.  You can't fault a movie too much for just making you smile.  There are tons of ways in which this movie could be worse, but it comes out to be a really good flick.  No, you shouldn't invite your friends over for wine, cheese and Legally Blonde followed by philosophical discussions.  Unless you want to have philosophical discussions in a really good mood that are wholly unrelated to the movie.
Legally Blonde just goes to show how good a formula can be, because this move is in every way another film that follows a formula, but I still can't shake my love for this film, so much so that despite the flaws that I see in the movie, I still give it 5 stars.
The most prominent flaw in this movie is the fact that Elle is pretty much morally perfect.  People given to hating the sorority girl persona will also have distaste for Elle, and probably wouldn't agree with me that she's perfect.  But truly, there's not really a character flaw that might cause Elle's downfall.  She has to overcome other people's perceptions and there's no reason she should lose because aside from perkiness, she's got nothing holding her back.  Every other character has flaws coming out the nose.  The writers bank on the audience having the same distaste for Elle's lifestyle that the Harvard students in the movie do, and that's just lazy.  On that note, there's very little to love in anyone who isn't on Elle's side.  If it weren't for Elle's ""wining personality"" causing Vivian to side with her at the end of the movie, Vivian, like the rest of the characters who have it in for Elle would find herself at the end of the movie just as two dimensional as Enid, the feminist lesbian, or the guy who thinks too much of himself, or Victor Garber's character.
However, I do actually come into the movie with the same negative preconceptions about sorority girls that allows me to enjoy the film.
Reese Witherspoon carries the movie.  She could probably just skip around in front of the camera while everyone else forms a circle behind her and we would probably be watching an interesting film.  Fortunatley, that's not what we have here.  There's a fantastic supporting cast, what with Holland Taylor, Jennifer Coolidge, Victor Garber, Luke Wilson and Selma Blair to name a few.
There are a lot of extras on this DVD, all of which are geared toward the target audience of perky blondes.  If you also stick this movie in the guilty pleasures category, then you will probably not be excited about the extra features.  The commentary is fun, even if we hear a little too much of ""Reese is great."" On that note, its fun to hear her responses as she tries to graciously accept the compliments, but you can tell that she thinks one time is enough.
The behind the scenes and making of featurettes are okay and worth a watch, but they definitely don't beg to be watched repeatedly.
The deleted scenes are fun to watch, though you can tell why they were cut (namely because Vivian is entirely too mean).
All in all, this movie probably deserves four stars, but I still think its worth the money that I paid for it.  I like it.  I like it a lot.",1065398400,2,3364,4.530578512396694

The way they portray this blonde as clueless with a 4.0 GPA is kind of odd. The exaggerated behaviors by her ex boyfriends love interest is a bit noticeable as well.
However this One Trick Pony gets a little wearisome after a while.  The closing court room scene is based on extreme stupidity of Reese Witherspoon and her alleis who show up at the courtroom like if it were a show.

Witherspoon stars as Elle, the not-so-dumb-blonde sorority queeen who gets dumped by her snooty boyfriend because she's kinda tacky. She decides to show him, and (because she is really smart and the admissions folks were all men), she enters Harvard Law School! Of course, the other students laugh at her and a professor embarrasses her for being unprepared. She learns her lesson, buckles down, goes on to win the Big Case and even gives the graduation speech.

All of this fantasy is made possible by the delightful Miss Witherspoon, who is an accomplished comic actress and lets us know it's ok to laugh at her and with her. ""Legally Blonde"" is a great chick-flick comedy with solid laughs.",1061337600,,967,4.7844311377245505

When I realized in the first 15 minutes or so that it was not, then I at least hoped it would be funny in any kind of way (e.g. dumb funny).  Well, it didn't even do that.  There wasn't any subtlety in the humor.  It was sometimes too crude to be funny, or sometimes so obvious that your little chuckle was over before the punchline.  I didn't even feel there was any good quotable dialogue in the movie.  Even the ""bend and snap"" scene didn't work (which could have been funny in the right hands).  Reese Witherspoon is okay, though far from being good enough to earn however many millions a picture she earns now (though all Hollywood actors are grossly overpaid).

1640262,5,B00005O5CM,"Let's get one thing straight...this is not a serious film.  Legally Blonde doesn't take itself seriously, which is how I like my comedies.  The storyline is a stereotypical California blonde gets her heart broken.  Elle Woods is the president of her sorority and leads a charmed life.  She has a 4.0 in Fashion Merchandising and thinks her hunk of a boyfriend, Warner, is going to propose.  However, he breaks up with her to pursue Harvard Law School and to ""get serious.""  Elle is momentarily in the dumps (over seeing her dreams snatched away so suddenly) but like any truly worthwhile heroine, she pulls herself up by her bootstraps and moves on and into overdrive.  Elle's hard work is rewarded by passing the LSAT and miraculously getting into Harvard Law School.
Elle arrives with flair to the campus and soon discovers the world outside of LA is different.  Elle runs into the ex-boyfriend on her way to her first class and makes a meeting time to ""catch up"" after class.  She arrives to class but wasn't prepared so she was asked to leave her first class by professor Stromwell.  While lamenting on a park bench, she meets Emmett Richmond (more on him later).  Warren meets up with Elle and Elle is getting her groove back when all of a sudden Warren introduces her to Vivian, his fiance.
With nothing going her way (no one wants to let her join their study group, she gets invited to a party by Vivian and just needs a good manicure).  Elle meets Paulette, played terrifically by Jennifer Coolidge, at the beauty salon and who is just surviving and not really living.  Elle and Paulette quickly become friends and by having regular manicures, Elle gets into the swing of things at Harvard.  She starts to put her mind to the task at hand and basically does it on her own.  Elle is starting to impress her professors and is asked to apply for a coveted position in Professor Callahan's law office.  They are representing Brooke Taylor Windham, a famous trainer along the lines of Kathy Smith.  Brooke is accused of the murder of her husband.  Brooke refuses to reveal her alibi even if it means going to prison for life.  Professor Callahan assembles a group of first year law students to be supervised by Emmett Richmond.  He is a member of Callahan's law practice and taken with Elle.  They work together on the case.  Also in the group of students are Warren and Vivian, which adds some needed drama.  Elle goes to pay Brooke a visit and discovers her ""secret.""  There is a big courtroom climax and all's well (or Elle) that ends well (again Elle).
The beauty of this film is not in the story.  This storyline is all formula.  The acting and casting are what make this film work so well.  Reese Witherspoon plays Elle just exaggerated enough to make her larger than life but restrained enough to not make her cartoon-ish.  Other worthy performances are Victor Garber as Professor Callahan.  He is convincing as a slimy lawyer.  Ali Larter as Brooke is a good match for Reese's Elle.  They are both former presidents of Delta Nu at CULA and they have the same mentality.  Selma Blair doesn't play Vivian Kensington with a malicious angle.  She pretty much treats Elle like most fiances would when confronted with someone chasing their fianc.  Jennifer Coolidge gives us the best performance of the bunch.  Ditzy but loveable Paulette is who you root for and has a heart of gold.  I was disappointed with Luke Wilson's character, Emmett Richmond.  I would have liked to have seen him guide the group more during the discovery phase.  It was almost like he was a student team member instead of a lawyer himself.
Elle Woods is a character that is not bound by what those around her think.  She is a force of her own and brings others around to reality.  This is a fun movie with lots of snappy dialogue and great characters.",1059523200,3,3831,4.634472511144131

This dilemma easily resolves in favor of the latter alternative, much in part because a movie this saccharine is a bit harder for the bitter cynic to bite.
A capsule synopsis might be all that is necessary: a fish-out-of-water comedy in the ""girl-power"" genre, with some romance thrown in for good measure.

Since Harvard has a policy prohibiting filming on its campus, LB was filmed somewhere else, either in a studio or some other university campus.  HLS students are portrayed as a stuffy and weird, which is not what I observed while working there (yes, they tended to be obnoxious nonetheless), but this stereotype works well as a backdrop for Elle Woods's silly innocence.

1640274,5,B00005O5CM,"I've never been a Reese Witherspoon fan; however, Legally Blond has changed that opinion.  Witherspoon not only carries the movie, but shines as the eternally optimistic if not nave Elle Woods who initially believes that success in life is predicated on what others think of you, but grows to understand that belief in oneself is the key to personal success.  The film actually reminded me of Goldie Hawn in 1984's Protocol; like Elle, Hawn's ""Sunny"" is an eternally optimistic blond stuck in a fish out of water situation.
While Witherspoon glows, the rest of the cast spends its screen time playing stereotypical roles that help ""Elle"" develop the inner confidence to carry on.  However, it is Luke Wilson, playing Witherspoon's champion ""Emmett"" that delivers a performance that one only sees once every 19 years.  Not since Chris Sarandon played opposite of Goldie Hawn in ""Protocol"" has an ""actor"" so effectively played an emotionless piece of wood.  Like Sarandon, Wilson is tall, dark haired prop, and performs adequately.  We know he is acting when he cocks his head (support), gooses his neck (encouragment), and wears a white suit to show he's the good guy.  But the movie isn't about Elle and Emmett, its about Elle and the producers were correct to place Wilson in this role to prevent a real actor from drawing attention away from Witherspoon.
Despite these flaws, this is Witherspoon's movie and its worth 90 minutes of your time.  Sit back, relax and just try not to think too hard.",1055635200,2,1497,4.912698412698413

Rich pretty girls who eventually get dumped in favor of ""marriage material"" do not in the course of a few months become intelligent and thoughtful, while maintaining their Cover Girl persona.

BUT it does so with lightness and fun and I'm sure you will be able to tell those who take themselves too seriously by their reaction to this movie.
I LOVED it (no, I'm not blonde, rich, super smart, gay, a society girl, trailer trash OR a lawyer)! And I'll try to tell you why I love this movie in under 1000 words.
Reece Witherspoon portrays Elle Woods(blonde, California college girl and fashion major just looking to get married as quick as possible to the man of her dreams) with such a deft touch that one would think she IS that girl--if they hadn't seen some of her other film work. Elle loves Warner Huntington III whose plans for the future are law school at Harvard and then politics and a ""serious"" minded finance/wife. Beautiful Elle doesn't fit the image, so Warner dumps her---On Valentine's Day....during dinner at a lovely restaurant....where Elle Thought he was going to propose!!  OOOOH....if there is one lesson guys should learn from this movie it is: Don't mess with a beautiful blonde on the Holy Grail of Romance Days or you could live to regret it.
In usual Elle fashion, she deduces that in order to 'get' her man, all she has to do is go to Harvard Law and so she proceeds to plan B. Just....Nail down an acceptable SAT, video a killer essay to Wow the admissions committee and accomplish it all without breaking a nail. Before you can say ""Let's shop for whole new wardrobe"" Elle is at Harvard asking for her Activities and Mixers schedule.
Favorite moment: When Elle gets chosen to be on Callahan's legal team for a high profile murder trial. You can practically see Elle changing from ditzy dreamer to determined achiever.
There are so many well crafted performers I had a harder time than usual picking favorites. However, two that really shine for me are: Jennifer Coolidge as Elle's friend and manicurist, Paulette Bonafont and Holland Taylor's turn as Professor Stromwell. Luke Wilson was perfect for Emmett (he does 'nice, decent guy' so well)
Legally Blonde is an affirmation that people can generally do a lot of the things that are important to them.  And that most are capable of doing more AND better if they will just try! It's a feel good movie that I love to watch. I highly recommend it!",1050364800,2,2366,4.644391408114559

1640283,3,B00005O5CM,"This is not a fantastic film however it is much better than I predicted, only the elaboration of a very basic plot makes the film work.
It begins with Elle, (Reese Witherspoon) a college student who anticipates receiving a marriage proposal from her boyfriend Warner (Matthew Davis). Unfortunately Warner has bigger plans and wishes to study law at Harvard University and only has plans to break up their relationship.  In order to prove that she is not just a stereotypical blonde bimbo with no brains, Elle successfully applies to Harvard whereby she attempts to charm over her ex-boyfriend by proving that she has the brains as well as the body.
Apart from annoying girls obsessed with shopping and beauty parlours (hence my connection with Clueless) and the part of Elle being overwhelmingly irritating the film does have some comical parts.  During the film you can also play a game of spot the instantly recognisable B-list actor. You will find yourself shouting aloud: - ""oh that's the guy from `Titanic'"" (Victor Garber) and ""oh he's from hmm can't remember"" (Luke Wilson)...and ""oh wasn't he in `Bring it on'"" (Richard Hillman). ""Oh, oh and she was in Final Destination"" (Ali Larter).
Many have congratulated Reese Witherspoon on a splendid performance in this film, but I'm not quite entirely sure she was not just playing herself.  I have seen her similar style of acting in American Psycho and one does have to wonder.

1640296,5,B00005O5CM,"""Legally Blonde"" was one of the funniest films released in 2001.  The film stars the very talented Reese Witherspoon (known also for her role in the 1998 film ""Pleasantville"") as sorority-queen Elle Woods, who majored in college in fashion merchandising.  The film begins with Elle being dumped by her boyfriend Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis), who plans to attend the prestigious Harvard Law School.  Determined to be with Warner, Elle decides to take the L.S.A.T. so that she can apply to Harvard Law School herself.  After studying harder than she has ever done in her life, Elle passes the L.S.A.T. and films an introductory video of herself to send with her application to Harvard Law School.  The Admissions Committee at Harvard Law School approves and Elle begins her journey into a new life at Harvard.  Elle's vivacious, naive, sorority-party attitude doesn't exactly fit the typical Harvard Law School student.  However, after Elle meets Warner's snobbish fiance, Vivian Kensington (Selma Blair), she is befriended by a poorly educated manicurist, Paulette Bonafont (Jennifer Coolidge), who inspires Elle to become a more serious law student.
The film takes some unexpected turns as Elle is propelled into world of jurisprudence and the court of law.  Memorable scenes in the film include Elle's first law school class with Professor Stromwell (Holland Taylor), Elle's revealing costume, Elle explaining the dynamics of the ""bend and snap"" to Paulette, and Elle explaining perm maintenance in a courtroom.  Other wonderful characters include Emmett (Luke Wilson), Professor Callahan (Victor Garber), Brooke Taylor Windham (Ali Larter), the UPS Guy (Bruce Wilson), Enrique (Greg Serano), Chutney Windham (Linda Cardellini) and a brief appearance by Raquel Welch as Mrs. Windham Vandermark.
""Legally Blonde"" is an engaging and endearing comedy whose success resulted not only from a great story, but also the talents of Reese Witherspoon for making a fashion merchandising major turned law student plausible.  Overall, I rate ""Legally Blonde"" with a much-deserved 5 out of 5 stars.  I hope that its sequel to be released in July 2003 (""Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde"". also starring Reese Witherspoon) will be equally as funny and further demonstrate Elle Woods' passion for the study and practice of law.",1047600000,5,2328,5.35068493150685

1640298,5,B00005O5CM,"Elle Woods is shocked when, instead of proposing, her boyfriend dumps her.  Convinced that this was true love, she struggles to find a way to win Warner back.  In an effort to be perceived as serious, she follows him to Harvard Law School.  She soon finds that the work is much harder then she anticipated.  And Warner is already engaged to someone else.  Will she managed to fit in, or will she drop out and move back to California?
As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a fairly formulaic comedy.  The first time I watched it, the plot only surprised me a couple of times.  However, it's so much fun, I really don't care.  Reese Witherspoon really caries the movie was Elle and brings such warmth to the part that it's easy to root for her to overcome her circumstances.  The other actors really shine as well, and several sub-plots help keep things interesting.  I find myself laughing and cheering my way through the movie.
This is a first rate DVD.  The picture and sound have been well preserved.  The audio commentaries are a mixed bag, some interesting information mixed in with a ""You were wonderful"" love fest.  My favorite feature is the deleted scenes.  They helped fill in a couple of small gaps.  And there's a great gag in one as well.  There was reference made on the disc to a few scenes that weren't included, which surprised me a little.  I guess these scenes were cut before they were filmed.

Elle thinks he is going to pop the question, but instead he tells her he's leaving her because she's not excelled enough, so to speak, and then he goes to Harvard Law School. Surprisingly, she also gets accepted to Harvard Law, and she tries to pursue Warner while battling his new girl Vivian (Selma Blair), and the reputation that she's not smart enough to be there.

1640302,5,B00005O5CM,"No one could have played Elle Woods quite as well as Reese Witherspoon, and I think her performance is why ""Legally Blonde"" succeeds on so many levels. With her case-closed smile and innocent baby blues, Witherspoon as a sorority princess who makes the grade in the Ivy League, lifts what could have been a trial into the realm of inspired fluff. Elle is smarter than she looks (a lesson the film belabors) and has the good sense to hire a Coppola to direct her admissions video.
First-time director Robert Luketic's heavy hand with sitcom farce strains credulity and patience. But the script, by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (Ten Things I Hate About You), gets off a few zingers, and Witherspoon - though miles from the keen satire of Election - stays one sharp cookie even as the film's plausibility crumbles. The silly and predictabl plot moves along at a trip hammer speed, however, and it is all played for laughs. Of course it is Witherspoon's performance that makes the film so much better than it should be. Her on-screen prescene is electrifying and her smile can melt just about anyone.

She decides to fix his wagon, so she puts together a kick-...admissions video (a hilarious speech on her law qualifications delivered while sitting in a hot tub), scores high on her LSATs and moves to the East Coast.

1640308,5,B00005O5CM,"Reese Witherspoon stars in this charming comedy about finding ones' self and just being who you are. Directed by Robert Luketic, it is light-hearted and funny.
PLOT SUMMARY: Elle Woods (Witherspoon) is your typical southern California blonde: she attends college, majors in Fashion Designing, and likes to get manicures. One night, her boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis), takes her out on a big date, and she and all her friends get excited, because they think he is going to propose to her. Instead, it turns out that Warner wants to dump her, because he'll be attending Harvard Law School in the fall and is looking for a more ""serious"" girl to marry, if he is ever going to become sentor. Heartbroken, Elle is furious and becomes depressed. But soon, Elle discovers that the only way to get her man back is to go to Harvard Law...a subject she knows little about. Elle is determinded to prove Warner wrong; that she CAN be smart. Surprisingly enough, Elle is accepted into the school. As soon as she gets to Harvard, however, she immediately stands out from the rest of the crowd, considering her wild fashion style and ultimate perkiness. But then, Elle has an encounter with Warner, and is surprised to learn that he has gotten engaged to a very preppy Harvard Law student, Vivian (Selma Blair). Vivian doesn't like Elle at all, and tries to make Elle's Harvard experience as miserable as possible, in hopes that she will find out that the school isn't right for her and leaves. Also, Elle is usually unprepared for classes (which also turn out to be miserable experiences), and Warner just can't seem to notice her. Meanwhile, Elle, upset with the way things are going, goes to get a manicure done and befriends the woman who gives her the manicure. This woman is lonely and depressed after getting a divorce from her husband and not getting a fair share in property custody. So Elle tries to help the woman get back what's hers from her husband. Also, while all this is going on, the woman tells Elle that if she wants her man back, then she must work hard to get him, so Elle decides to become serious with her work. She is surprised to find that she is actually improving, especially when one of her professors, Professor Callahan (Victor Garber), asks her, along with a few other students--including Warner and Vivian--to help him with an assignment. The assignment turns out to be a murder case. The accused? A former president of the soroity house Elle used to live in at her old college. Elle knows that the girl is innocent of the crime, but no one on her team will believe her. So Elle is determinded to solve the puzzle of the case and get her friend out of jail. By this time, she maybe starting to lose interest in Warner, for another guy has come into her life, Emmett (Luke Wilson), who is assisting Callahan on the trial.
OVERALL THOUGHTS: I personally loved ""Legally Blonde"". The acting is superb by the entire cast, especially Reese--she ultimately shines, the script is clever and humorous, and is not offensive or dark. Since I am a Boston native, I have true appreciation for this film, since I'm always seeing preppy Harvard students whenever I visit Harvard Square (lol). The directing is awesome and it's just a fun film. You can enjoy it even if you are not blonde-haired! It's very girlie, but ""Legally Blonde"" will have you laughing away. The DVD is also nicely packaged, because the bonus features inlcude deleted scenes with introductions, exclusive featurettes, a Hoku music video, audio commentary, and trivia track.
I highly recommend ""Legally Blonde"".

I just rented it again last night on dvd, and the special features are great too.  If you are a fan of Reese's, I definately recommend this movie for you.  It shows you both her funny and serious sides.
It starts out with Elle in a typical California college, parties and such, and she believes her boyfriend, Warner, is going to propose to her that night.  Instead he breaks up with her for someone more serious, if he is going to be a senator, he needs someone a bit more down to earth.  Elle is frustrated, and decides to apply to Harvard Law.  She somehow manages to get in, but she sticks out like a sore thumb.  Her first class doesn't go over too well, and she only finds out that Warner is engaged to some preppy girl.  She doesn't make friends very easily at first, and she starts to think law school was a bad idea.  Finally, she decides to prove everyone wrong, by getting her act together, and be prepared for her classes.  Everything is going great and when a teacher chooses 4 first years to help assist him, Elle is one of them.  As it turns out, their client was in Elle's sorority house, only before Elle was there.

In doing so she finds that she's more than just a pretty face, she's a top notch defense. Along the way, she tries to win back her beau only to fund out that he got engaged to a mean uptight Selma Blair who is constantly making her stay at Harvard an uncomfortable one. In the end she puts her Law skills to the test as she finds herself in a heated Murder trial. It's up to Elle to come out on top.
O.k. this is yet another comedy where you have to take it was it is. In any case, it's a funny movie and Witherspoon does reallt well in this role. A lot of people have plugged this as the new CLUELESS and I personally don't think it is because the 2 movies are completely different. The only thing the 2 share in common is that the lead is played by a beautiful, yet somewhat ditsy girl but other than that TOTALLY DIFFERENT and should not be compared to each other.
Definately get this movie because it'll make you laugh. It's a lot of cutesy and fluff so girls will get into this movie and any guys with a good sense of humor will also get a kick out of this one.

The script is full of wit, charm and all the elements that remind us of old classic comedies like Born Yesterday or Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. The story of a blonde girl who decides to go to Harvard just to impress an ex-boyfriend is just the start of a great story about friendship, self-esteem, pride and the right to be different.

Reese Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, the president of her Southern California sorority, which seems to consist solely of beautiful but empty-headed coeds. Expecting a marriage proposal from her dreamboat, Rich Boy Warner (Matthew Davis), she is instead dumped. Warner is off to Harvard Law and expects to run for political office someday. As he puts it, ""I need to marry a Jackie (Kennedy), not a Marilyn (Monroe)."" Stunned, Elle soon comes to the conclusion that to win him back, she also must get into Harvard Law. Since she has a Fashion Design major, her prospects seem dim. But this is, after all, a Hollywood fable and not real life. The all-male admissions committee grants her entry after viewing her application video, which shows her bikinied in a hot tub. Even lawyers can go ""oink, oink"". Anyway, once on campus, Elle is confronted with the usual Dumb Blonde stereotyping. Enraged and indignant, she decides to get serious with her studies. She'll show them!
LEGALLY BLONDE is magnificently frivolous with an eminently predictable ending. But, so what? It's also light-hearted and fun, perhaps even to a lawyer. Witherspoon is lovely and perky - a joy to watch. It's family entertainment in which nobody gets permanently hurt. And it's about time that the human subspecies Homo sapiens blondei got empowered.

Instead of being the typical rich, snotty, elitish sorrority queen, Reese Witherspoon' s Elle Woods is warm, endearing, funny (especially when she cries during the breakup scene with Warner; her hilarious crying is reminscent of Doris Day's in ""Pillow Talk""), and intelligent.
For once the tables are turned and the popular sorrority girl finds herself an outcast with Harvard's staid law school students and professors. But with pluck, determination, and a positive outlook, Elle forges on and eventually wins them over.
The scene where Elle introduces herself to some classmates during Orientation is priceless. After she utters the classic line, ""Whoever thought orange was the new pink is seriously disturbed,"" the reaction from her classmates is absolutely hysterical. I laugh everytime I see it.
The only REALLY dippy-dumb part was the ""Bend And Snap"" portion. That was really LAME, and really did not fit into the film all that well. To me, that temporarily transformed Elle back into the mindless, air-headed blonde.  It just didn't fly.
Other than that portion, this is a cute, fun film. The soundtrack is superb--being from Hawaii, I am a fan of Hoku's music. It's nice to see a local girl make good. (For all of you who don't know, Hoku Ho is Don ""Tiny Bubbles"" Ho's daughter!)",1034553600,,1396,4.991416309012876

Reese Witherspoon's comic timing is excellent, and its impossible not to enjoy her performance here. Elle eventually enters an internship, with her ex boyfriend and his current beau, and they have to defend Brooke, a woman who Elle knew through her sorority. Elle is the only one who belives her innocence and later goes onto to prove her innocence, taking on the case when Callahan her professor makes a move on her, and Brooke dumps him. Its a well timed comedy movie, with some great moments all around. Other actors include Luke Wilson, Selma Blair, and more.

1640327,4,B00005O5CM,"'Legally Blonde' surpassed everyone's expectations last year when it became one of the most successful movies of last summer, even in blockbuster season.  The story has Elle Woods (Witherspoon) as the blonde sorority girl who is dumped by her boyfriend because she's not smart enough for him.  Determined to prove him wrong she enrolls in Harvard Law School, whereupon she finds he's now engaged to Selma Blair.  But she's prepared to steal him back as well as ace her degree.
Okay, so the plot is a bunch of fluff that's as empty-headed as the sorority types it tries so desperately to lampoon but with Witherspoon on board it's impossible not to root for her.  It's pretty near impossible to read a review that doesn't make at least one reference to the comic genius that was Witherspoon in the biting satire 'Election', and such comic timing is on full display here.  Brimming with sexual attitude, naivity and an endearing determination Witherspoon fleshes out the role of Elle admirably.  Even with the clichd story (you can tell right from the get-go who Elle will end up with) she keeps you watching right up until the very end.
Still, I don't mean to write off the rest of the people involved in the movie completely because there are plenty of good ideas and observations here.  The fact that the clique of sorority girls are, at Harvard, the underdog is a nice reversal of roles that works incredibly well.  Still, you do suspect that without Witherspoon on board this would be just another teen movie.

I found the movie boring, dull and to be quite frank would much rather go swimming with ""Jaws"" than watch that again!

1640331,4,B00005O5CM,"The formulaic young female blonde is a familar object in American Movies, particularly in recent years; invariably ""Clueless,"" shallow, vain, and blended with a little streak of mean that always gets, in the end, its just desserts.
I watched ""Legally Blonde"" with low expectations, expecting to see this bit played tirelessly to the hilt. I was pleasantly surprised to see a few unexpected elements added to the standard mix in the character of Elle Woods played so warmly by Reese Witherspoon, the most notable of such elements being intelligence, integrity, and that rarest of things in modern film, a sense of ethics.  Witherspoon plays the role finely, with an overweening optimism that breathes real life into a script with almost as many unbelievable plot twists as, say, ""The Fugitive.""  Here however there are no amazing special effects to make up for the plot, unless of course you count Ms. Witherspoon's winning smile, which somehow does more than Harrison Ford can do by jumping off a dam.
The rest of the cast is pretty good too:  Of special note is Matt Davis, as Werner Huntington III, the boyfriend who jilts Elle for a fellow Harvard Brahminette, played by Selma Blair.  Davis plays Warner like a latter day George W. Bush, a mindless self satisfied far overrated automaton who relies on connections and an unearned sense of birthright to push himself far beyond the realms in which he might safely function.  Ms. Blair is also especially good as Vivian Kennsington, the new girlfriend, an ice queen before the fall.
Also worth noting is a little throwaway role played by Bruce Thomas, the UPS guy.  He does it perfectly.
Definitely worth watching, even if the plot is preposterous.",1031529600,,1699,4.943859649122807

1640335,3,B00005O5CM,"I suspect one's gut reaction to ""Legally Blonde"" may hinge upon two things: fondness (or lack thereof) for Reese Witherspoon and her frothy LA sorority girl character, to whom this film entirely belongs; and  any personal experience with college and/or law school that allows the predictable script to seem funnier or more believeable than it is.

The plot is a variation of the fish-out-of-water theme and offers few surprises but some mild laughs. Witherspoon creates a very credible proto-bimbette, and her dynamic expressions and careful timing wring the most out of every line and reaction. But there isn't anything very challenging about the film's message of ""Just be yourself"" as a key to success and happiness -- all fine and good when you have money, beauty, and privilege, as Witherspoon's ""Elle Woods"" does.  What Elle is forced to discover in the course of her Harvard Law School adventure is that she has a brain as well, and this along with one massively convenient plot twist after another allows Miss Woods to conquer all by film's end (which is  itself the most outrageously convenient and smiley-faced section of the movie).

I'll be generous and grant three stars to ""Legally Blonde"" because it is occasionally clever and has a good heart (like our chirpy heroine) and because Witherspoon is a genuine comedic talent -- comparisons being made to a young Goldie Hawn are, if anything, understated, with Reese showing a much wider range at a far younger age.  She is going to have a long and fantastic career, no doubt about it.  But this movie is unchallenging and ultimately as filling as a big hank of cotton candy.  Nothing wrong with that, but it's no solid meal.  And sad to say, in real life, sororities and fraternities are not nearly as egalitarian, supportive,  or sweet-natured as depicted in this fantasyland, and the Elle Woods who reside within them are more likely to be  intolerant, smug, and elitist jerks and bullies -- just like the villains of this picture, not the good guys.  Such is the skewed,  rosey-eyed worldview of ""Legally Blonde"" -- no wonder Elle wears so much pink!",1029196800,9,2115,4.890756302521009

1640337,5,B00005O5CM,"""Legally Blonde"" wasn't as good as I thought it would be, it was much better! I had always thought that it would be just another chick flick, dumb plot with stupid jokes. Nevertheless, I really wanted to try it out so when I did, I had a pleasantly fun surprise!
Sorority girl of Delta New, Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon), has it all. She's beautiful, everyone loves her, and she has the love of her life, Warner Huntington the 3rd (Matthew Davis). But on the night she believes he's going to propose to her, he instead dumps her big time! After being told she's not serious enough to be his wife if he's going to become a senator, she comes to a decision; to show him how serious she is, she'll go to Harvard Law School where she'll be near Warner! But when she does, she discovers he is already engaged to another student, Vivian Kensington (Selma Blair). With the help of a manicurist, Paulette (Jennifer Coolidge), and support from the handsome Emmet Richmond (Luke Wilson) Elle decides to prove how smart she can be. Will Elle have enough heart to believe in herself to show the world the real person inside of her? Also starring Victor Garber as Professor Callahan and Ali Larter as Brooke Taylor who is being put on trial for murder.
""Legally Blonde"" is not your usual chick flick, one of the reasons being that it falls in the category of a pure comedy since there really is not much romance is a way. The plot is as cute and as feel good as it gets, with an outcome you already guessed. But who cares since ""Legally Blonde"" ultimately satisfies you just the way it is!
Reese Witherspoon is terrific for her role as the cute and peppy girl, Elle Woods. She's incredibly funny and is very much into her role as the way she walks stylishly, swishes her hair, and 'like' talks the way which makes her so believable as a sorority girl. Her character is given some character development but not too much making it too much of a change. In the end she's still Elle, fun and lovable yet a much smarter girl. The supporting cast is also superb and it's hard not to mention all of them. I especially loved Luke Wilson, my first time to see him act though I've seen his brother Owen Wilson in many movies (""Behind Enemy Lines"", ""Shanghai Noon"", ""Meet the Parents""). Though Luke Wilson doesn't have that much screen time as I'd hoped, in every role his character Emmett is such a support to Elle. Matthew Davis is also good as the 'jerk' ex-boyfriends of Elle's. I mean from the very beginning you can't help but despise him in a way though he may seem like Elle's 'Prince Charming'.
As I have already mentioned, ""Legally Blonde"" is just so funny, filled with one-liners and very funny moments! There are plenty of favorite parts, some of mine including Elle's 'bend and snap' method, Elle's two friends coming to the court house saying, ""How cute! There's a judge and the jury people!"", Emmett giving tips on the professors, and lots more! Plus Bruiser, Elle's chihuahua is so adorable as she has as many different outfits as his master! Oh, and a bit of trivia, Reese Witherspoon's character wears 40 different hairstyles throughout the film! And a numerous array of outfits!
So if you're in mood for a fluffy and light comedy, check out ""Legally Blonde"", fun whether you're a blonde, brunette, or otherwise! Rated PG-13 for language and sexual reference.",1028592000,2,3354,4.582362728785358
1640338,5,B00005O5CM,"I went into watching ""Legally Blonde"" with low expectations.  I get tired of movies portraying rich valley girl bimbos that have good luck in life because of their looks.  Well, now there is sweet revenge because this girl's got a brain!
Reese Witherspoon is funny, charming, bright, etc. as Elle Woods, the fashion-design major who sets out to become an attorney to keep her snobby boyfriend Warner.  She meets adversity because of her Barbie doll looks and wealthy lifestyle, but she actually sets out to prove that she can work just as hard as everyone else and earn respect and success.  How very noble of her.
And the character is worthy of respect.  The audience will undoubtedly root for her as she makes her way from being late to class to assisting in a sensational trial.  The rest of the cast is great as well, but Witherspoon just can't help but outshine them.  One exception might be Selma Blair who gave an excellent performance as the icy classmate who has stolen Warner's affection.
There are plenty of funny, even some ridiculous moments in this movie, most of them involving Elle trying confidently to fit in in Harvard's schoolbook-serious environment.  But there is also some drama to keep things interesting.  And it's not just a chick flick.  It's the kind of movie that both men and women can find humorous.

1640348,4,B00005O5CM,"Reese Witherspoon is becoming quite a big contender in Hollywood today.  She's appeared in several critically acclaimed films such as Cruel Intentions, Election, and Pleasantville.  And with Legally Blonde, her hot streak continues.
Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, the beautiful, blonde, rich valley girl who gets dumped by her boyfriend who has made the decision to become more ""serious"" and study at Law School.  After being rejected,, Elle decides to follow him to Law School to win him back.  When she gets there, she realizes he has a new girlfriend, who is played by Selma Blair (Reese's co-star in Cruel Intentions).  This sets up an amazingly fresh and bright comedy that is sure to be remembered by many people.
Elle quickly becomes a very likeable character.  She stands up for what she believes in and says some of the things that we wish we could to others, but don't.  She's very much of an outcast when she arrives at Harvard and despised by most, but as the movie continues, she slowly begins winning over almost every character in the movie.
Legally Blonde is a very bright and smart comedy, with a hip and talented cast.  It contains great morals, a great story, and fun dialogue.  And when it's over, no matter what mood you were in before, you're guaranteed to feel better about yourself afterwards.  This movie is definitely worth a look.
There are many great extras contained on the DVD, such as a Hoku music video, deleted scenes, and two featurettes.

The caricature is so outlandish and the kitsch ladled on so heavily that the film seems intent on blowing by parody to excessive farce.  However, the genuineness of Reese Witherspoon and the shift from California to Boston and the sorority house to the law school provide just enough dampening to allow you to sit back, relax and enjoy the movie.
And the movie is enjoyable.  Witherspoon has a genuine radiance on screen which, combined with her wonderful sense of comedic timing, allows one to forgo analysis of the obvious and hackneyed plot and concentrate on her quite considerable talents.  Moreover, Luketic, in what amounts to a heroic restraint these days, virtually completely forgoes the modern tendency in summer ""fluff"" movies to avoid cheap and tawdry sexual exploitation (the ""bend & snap scene being the only real exception) and concentrate on the story, letting is focus on Reese's acting rather than her bosom.

An absurd storyline is carried by the actress in a script that fits Ms. Reese tighter than the designer outfits made into a running joke in the film.
Though ably directed and acted by a supporting cast including Luke Wilson and a chihuahua, 5 star storyline it is not.  This movie is for fun, not for keeps.  Yet, as weak as the foundation may be in Legally Blonde, I found myself smiling at the antics of Elle Woods (Reese W.), a grown up version of Alicia Silverstone's Clueless character.  The sorority depictions were frightenly parallel to the one's I recall in college, which only made the stereotype more humourous.  And Elle's college entrance video submitted to the Harvard Admission Committee makes the film almost worthwhile on its own.

After seeing the movie, I knew I had to add this movie to my collection. This is a great movie starring Reese Witherspoon, Selma Blair, Luke Wilson, Matthew Davis, etc.
Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) has a good life going for her, being President of her sorority, a Hawaiian Tropic girl, and a natural blonde. She is in love with a fraternity boy , Warner ( Matthew Davis ) whom she wants to marry, but who dumps her simply because she is ""too blonde"". Heartbroken but angry enough, Elle decides that she will get Warner whatever it takes, even if it means joining Harvard Law School, where Warner is studying. She joins Harvard, but has a lot of twists in store for her, and must battle through them :)
From my point of view, this is not just another ""teen"" movie, but it actually gives a good moral that you should never judge a person just because of his/her looks, race etc. whatsoever. The movie tells us this moral in a very funny and cute way, which makes Legally Blonde all the more enjoyable.
Apart from this, there are also the Special Features the Special Edition of this dvd contains such as, deleted scenes, 2 original featurettes, 2 audio commentaries tracks with the cast and the crew, music videos, trailers and much more!

1640359,3,B00005O5CM,"At first glance, this film would appear to be a rehash of ""Clueless"" - especially when comparing the equally blonde, likable, and rich characters played by Alicia Silverstone (Clueless) and Reese Witherspoon (Legally Blonde).  However, after 30 minutes, you start to realise that Legally Blonde is actually a fish-out-of-water story.  Elle (Reese's character) is a fashion major and sorority girl from a (fictional) west-coast university who decides to go to Harvard Law School (in pursuit of her boyfriend).  She barely makes it in (a scene that contains the film's funniest moment: ""Don't we encourage diversity in our program?""), and shows up in Massachusetts dressed in hot pink with her chihuahua in tow.  In hearty contrast are her classmates - serious law students toting Masters degrees and dressed in beige and grey.  The story is basically how Elle buckles down, learns to work hard, and wins the approval of her peers and professors while remaining true to herself.
The movie only works because of Wotherspoon's protrayal - Elle is completely likeable, even when she starts off as a spoiled rich girl.  The movie doesn't dwell on artificial crises thrown in Elle's way (in fact, the cut scenes on the DVD include a few of these, which the editor wisely eliminated).  Instead, we are drawn in by the character and are cheering for her to make it through the law degree.  In addition, to the untrained ear, the legalese is convincing, not a parrot of filibuster courtroom scenes from past movies.
The DVD edition, oddly enough, may be more than most people would expect for such a film.  There are 2 audio commentaries, some short featurettes (one enumerates all of Reese's hair styles, something like 32 in total), and a pop-up video trivia track.  All are entertaining to some degree, if occasionally repetative.  Most interesting are the cut scenes, including an introduction to each (and explanation why they were cut) by the director.  All of this (including both widescreen and P&S forms of the film) fits on a single disc (2-sided).

For a while, my friends; it was heavy going: giggly dopey airheads saying ""like"" endlessly. But I persevered.... and things got better. Sure, the ending is so stupid and unlikely that you will be rolling your eyeballs toward the heavens, but this story of a blonde bimbo who becomes a lawyer to prove to her ex-boyfriend there's more to her than being blonde and having a body you could eat off, is actually quite likeable, in large part to Reese Witherspoon's performance (plus she looks really hot in a bikini too).",1023148800,,802,4.462585034013605

It's also a great movie to watch after getting dumped (trust me, I know this from experience). In Legally Blonde, Elle Woods, a sorority girl who is a fashion major, gets dumped by her boyfriend, Warner, because she is not serious enough for him. She decides to show him that she is indeed serious by going to Harvard Law School. Everyone (especially Warner) assumes she will fail but she gets the ultimate revenge-proving all of them wrong and becoming a great lawyer. Reese Witherspoon was hilarious in this movie. I was laughing the whole time. She is one of those rare people who can be intelligent and funny and still look good doing it. Luke Wilson was also good-a great contrast to Elle's first boyfriend in the movie, Warner. This is a great girl power movie. Even though the whole basis of it seems a little farfetched, it still has several great messages-that everyone has the potential to succeed if they work for it, and not to judge people by appearences. Also, the DVD has a lot of cool extra features (several behind the scenes featurettes and a lot of funny deleted scenes). I actually bought it after renting it because I liked it so much.

1640365,4,B00005O5CM,"When I first heard of the movie, LEGALLY BLONDE, I suspected a ditzy teen movie with not much of acting, plot, or significance. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I finally got a chance to watch the movie. The beginning starts out silly...the expected takes place when Elle Woods (Witherspoon) and her ditzy high school graduate friends are thinking about boyfriends, makeup, their perfect dresses, etc. However, the movie keeps you watching as you see the changes that come along with Elle and her story. Here is a quick plot summary and a telling of what makes LEGALLY BLONDE ""not just another blonde girl flick"".
Plot: Elle Woods is the perfect girl. She has pretty much everything a teen girl could desire...great boyfriend, plenty of friends, and beautiful clothes. Then everything takes a turn for the worse...or so she thinks when her boyfriend dumps her during a date. The reason is because ""Elle isn't smart enough for him to impress his family when he goes to Harvard"". Elle, devasted, does all she can to head to law school.
The plot takes twists, plenty of comedic moments, and the characters take turns for the better...and the worse. Elle begins also to unexpectantly discover the person she really is behind the ""Barbie Doll"" look. It also holds valuable lessons about acheiveing goals and not letting anything stop you. This movie could be compared to Alicia Silverstone's CLUELESS. While both excellent, funny, not-just-another-teen-movie movies, I'd recommend LEGALLY BLONDE over CLUELESS. In both movies, the characters began as shallow, ditzy teens and later on in the plot became more aware of the world around them.",1022198400,,1643,5.0664206642066425
1640366,4,B00005O5CM,"Dumped by the man that she loves, Elle decides to overrule the statement he's made about her not being serious enough, and make a motion of her own by getting into Harvard and attending law school. It's entertaining and satisfying to see how Elle retains her unique flair for life but finds herself motivated to be more than just another pretty face. In the midst of almost everyone telling her she's not smart enough, not serious enough, not tough enough, Elle determines to prove (almost) all of them wrong. The one who believes in Elle from the first time he meets her is a surprise - you have to watch to find out who he is!  The neat thing about this movie is, many of the people who judge Elle to be a certain way in the beginning, the ones Elle finds herself up against - classmates, professors - end up rooting for her in the end... and Elle is the kind of person who, by not holding a grudge, wins in more ways than one.",1021852800,,929,4.278409090909091

Not very appealing.  The film takes the airhead too seriously.  Will the ditzy teen comedies never end?  It is the worst teen movie I've ever seen.  In fact, it's the worst movie I've seen in recent years.  If a person skips out on Legally Blond, they won't be missing anything.",1021593600,7,556,4.425742574257426

1640369,4,B00005O5CM,"This is a film I really wanted to be good, and I was not disappointed.  From the opening scenes of mega-eye-candy, showing the important things in the world of the sorority, this could have easily turned into yet another vulgar teen comedy and quickly forgotten.  If not for the clever writing of the Elle Woods character, and the casting of Reese Whitherspoon, this could have easily went down this path.
What I liked very much is that it's easy to think early on that Elle is exactly the ditz she seems to be.  Her world is shallow, and full of fluff, and she works hard at maintaining the status quo.  Had she become engaged to her boyfriend as she planned to at the start of the story, she might have stayed in this world.
But what we start seeing of her is that she's a very smart person.  She has excelled in her chosen field of fashion merchandising, because that's all that was ever expected of her.  While her original reasons for trying to make more of herself are, well, ditzy, we start seeing a person capable of accomplishing a lot without compromising a lot of what is important to her.
This would still not make it a really good movie if it wasn't for one more characteristic.  The Elle character is a genuinely good person.  While being on the receiving end of a lot of abuse for her lifestyle, she dishes out almost none on her own.  This is a genuinely nice person who you root for to win in the end.
The only problem I had was the lightweight legal material.  I saw exactly where the movie was going when Elle questions the daughter about a perm, and I'm sorry, but witnesses don't fall down and confess so easily.  But I guess this is to make me realize that this is still a comedy, and not to worry about such things.",1021593600,,1738,4.34984520123839

But how much does it take for you when you're to read heavy textbooks your nasty teachers assign to read instead of ""Seventeen"" or ""Cosmopolitan,"" to get back your ex-boyfriend?  Or your dignity for that matter?
Looking this way at ""Legally Blonde,"" truly enjoyable comedy, it becomes now 100 % clear that this joyful film is not a second cousin of ""Clueless,"" a modern high school comedy.  ""Legally Blode"" means exactly delectable Reese Witherspoon, and even if the script sometimes (or you might say always) gives a ridiculously incredible turns in any given 10 minutes, it is absolutely OK as long as Reese is on the screen ... and, thank Heavens, she IS!
So, don't complain anything about less exposure of supporting players (Luke Wilson fans especially), and grab a huge cup of popcorn and just have fun.  Not every scenes are successful, I know, but as far as Reese's character Elle Woods is concerned, it is absolutely a genuine fun that make us forget any clumsy  moment of the story.  And for older film fans like me, you got a special appearance (welcome but too brief) of Raquel Welch.
Finally, the film is reportedly made with a low budget ($ 18 millions), but every effort is put into the film's unexpect places where you might miss.  To illustrate, just try to count  40 different hairstyles that decorates Elle's head.  And watch out the delightful semi-musical scene in the beauty salon, where Elle teaches how to catch guy's attention (with incredible 98 % success rate).  This scene is choreographed by no other than Toni Basil.  Enjoy it.

1640374,4,B00005O5CM,"What thought crossed your mind when you first heard about this movie?  I was thinking that ""Legally Blonde"" was just another title for ""Clueless 2"" and I wondered where Alicia Silverstone would fit in.  Still, I thought it looked saccharine, sweet, Bubblicious, and fun....and fun it is.
  The plot revolves around Reese Witherspoon's character, Elle Woods, a blonde, beauty queen, perfect, Barbie doll, babe.  But not only does Elle look perfect, but she acts perfectly too....I'll get more into that aspect of her character later.  Anyway, Elle's perfect GQ boyfriend Warner, is about to go off to Harvard Law and instead of proposing to her he dumps her.  He tells Elle that if he wants to be a senator by the time he's 30 (uh, good luck) he needs a more serious girl-- a Jackie, not a Marilyn-- as he so aptly puts it.  Elle is just not serious enough for him.  Unfortunately, Elle is seriously in love with Warner and doesn't want to lose him.  She devises a plan to get him back-- she'll go to Harvard Law too (""What, like it's hard?"", she says).
  The rest of the story involves how Elle deals with the nerds at Harvard, the attitudes of East Coasters, and scary sadistic law professors.  As if all that is not enough....Elle also has to cope with Warner's horrible, mean, super [nasty] fianc who makes it a point to humiliate Elle whenever possible.  She's a real meany!  Elle pulls through and eventually realizes that she really is a smart girl with a great legal mind (in her own way)....oh, not to mention a great sense of style and knowledge about fashion.
  Overall, the story is really cute and very enjoyable.  There was only one scene that really made me roll my eyes and think, ""D'oh!  Gimme a break!"".  The main reason I really liked ""Legally Blonde"" was because of Elle's character.  She's beautiful and perfect and looks like a Malibu Barbie....but she is also very self assured and confident.  She doesn't try to change herself for others and she stays true to herself despite ridicule.  Also, when things get tough for her she always responds in an almost saintly manner...she ""kills 'em with kindness.""  She always tries to be nice to others and always has a kind word.  I thought it was a very positive message.
Recommendation: I thought ""Legally Blonde"" was a great movie.  It was very funny and entertaining.  I enjoyed ""Legally Blonde"" much more.  It was a lot of fun and it had a great message-- be yourself!",1020124800,2,2437,4.657276995305164

1640376,5,B00005O5CM,"Legally Blonde is one of the best underdog movies I've ever come across. Reese Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, a Beverly Hills blonde with a fashion designing career in order and a Hawaiin Tropic belt under her . . . belt. When her boyfriend (Matther Davis) decides to dump her and go to Harvard to pursue a career in Law, Elle figures the only way to win him back and to show him up at his own game. So Elle heads off to Harvard, and certainly does show a lot of people that blonde is a whole lot more fun than people put on.
 Legally Blonde came as a surprise hit to Hollywood. But it's totally worthy of it's praise. The screenplay is smooth going and never hits a corny note, even with some of the characters that could have been ultra corny. Reese Witherspoon absolutely shines as Elle Woods. Jennifer Coolidge was adorable as Elle's new best friend, Paulette. Matthew Davis played the part of the rich, snobby boy to the core, and Selma Blair's change in character was flawless. She's too cute. The rest of the supporting cast all gave great performances, as well as the little Chihuahua who played Bruiser.
 The Special Edition dvd is a must-have for your collection. There are two audio commentaries with film crew and Reese Witherspoon. Two features, one which goes into full detail on the movie; from the beginning of the idea to the end result. I was glad to see this instead of a 7 minute or so promotional spot which is marked as a featurette. This part of the DVD is a much watch. The other featurette is all about Reese's hair and is a fun little ditty. There are 8 or so deleted scenes, some with commentary from director Robert Luketic. Rounding out the extras are the theatrical trailer, production notes, and cast & crew bios. The picture quality is great with Elle's bright colors contrasting well with the fall colored background of Harvard. The audio is also very good.
 Legally Blonde will certainly stand out from the rest, and it's all thanks to the cast and crew, and mainly, Reese Witherspoon.",1019606400,10,2018,4.553719008264463

I watched the movie and there's nothing dumb about Elle Woods.  To me, she's brought up with confidence in herself.  Don't know who embedded this strong belief in one's self in Elle Woods.  But it's there, so evidently portrayed by Miss Witherspoon.  She's not a bit self-conscious showing up with her own west coast fashion sense in the east coast Harvard Law campus and she's not a bit ashamed of who she is.  Although her failed relationship had temporarily set her back and the people she encountered in Harvard Law had tried to put her down and belittle her (they almost succeeded), her healthy dose of self-esteem came to her rescue every time.
It's a far-fetched comedy by all means but Miss Witherspoon always came prepared for her roles with a great deal of understanding into their psyche, motivation, and character development.  It's her grounded portrayal of Elle Woods that made this movie a fun movie watching experience.

First and formost, this is NOT a movie about a ""dumb blonde"".  This movie is about the President of fictional sorority Delta Nu, who is a fashion merchandising major with a 4.0 grade point average.  She IS smart when it comes to her field of study and all surrounding subjects.  This is proved when she goes with her friends (one of whom, as a result of hanging out in nail salons, speaks fluent Korean!!) to buy the perfect dress for what she thinks will be the night her boyfriend Warner (Mathew Davis from Pearl Harbor) proposes to her.  The sales clerk of the botique, thinking Elle must be a dumb blond, tries to pass off an old dress with a propensity to snag as a one-of-a-kind original.  Elle quickly, and sweetly, let's her know she is NOT dumb, ditzy or willing to be taken advantage of.
When Warner breaks up with her because he needs a serious girl like the ""Vanderbilt"" one his brother is marrying, she is crushed.  But after noticing his soon-to-be sister in law is a law student, she has her plan; she too must attend law school!  And from there, we ride a roller coaster of Elle studying for the LSAT's, making her wonderfully inventive admissions video and doing what even Warner was not able to do...get into Harvard Law School On Her OWN Merits!
Along the way, we meet Vivian, Warner's new fiancee and Elle's competition, and a whole host of others who will be for or against Elle during her quest to win Warner back.  But after a crushing blow or two, Elle soon figures out that actual studying, faith and a seriousness she HAS ALWAYS possessed, is all she needs to survive and prove, Not To Warner, but to Herself, that she Does Indeed Belong at Harvard.  She isn't GIVEN a position as helper on a sensation murder case.  She EARNS IT with her outspoken and legally on point answers in class.  And goes on to prove that Cosmo girls with intelligence and someone who believes in them, can do anything.
This movie shows true intelligence, integrity and endurance wrapped up in a fluffy, child friendly ""girl power"" environment.  The fact that my 13 year old Son LOVED the movie says a great deal.  So don't believe this is another ""dumb blonde"" movie.  Reese Witherspoon has gained a fan for life in me with this triumphant trip to Harvard that far surpasses anything I've ever seen in the genre.

1640385,3,B00005O5CM,"Legally Blonde is a comedy that pokes fun at the lifestyles of rich California girls. A few years ago, a little jewel of a movie called Clueless gave us a much funnier and more insightful look at these young ladies. It's probably still around your video store. The immensely talented and likable Reese Witherspoon stars in Legally Blonde. She portrayed a much more determined and funnier girl in Election, one of the best teen comedies ever made. This doesn't mean Legally Blonde isn't enjoyable. It means it's lightweight entertainment. It makes you smile a lot rather than laugh. It does have the distinction of being rather sweet and lovable [thanks to Ms. Witherspoon] in a year of mainly cynical and gross-out comedies.
Elle Woods [Witherspoon] has it all. She's rich, adorable and popular. So is her boyfriend, Warner [Matthew Davis]. Her sorority sisters at her Los Angeles college think Warner is about to propose marriage. Everyone is ecstatic. Instead, Warner, who is about to go to Harvard Law School, dumps her. He says she doesn't fit into his plan to be a US Senator by the time he is thirty because, frankly, she's just too blonde. He needs a girl who's more East Coast Establishment, like a Kennedy or a Rockefeller. In real life, a young woman would be thankful to have seen her boyfriend's true colors before it was too late. But this is the movies, so Elle decides she will become the girl he desires. She applies to Harvard herself, and actually gets accepted. Off she goes to Cambridge with her little dog, Bruiser, and a Bekins truckload of furniture and fashion accessories. There, she discovers she's still too blonde for Warner, who now has a brunette girlfriend. That's okay. She a Southern California girl, and nothing is too big of a challenge for one of those. Her optimism and sense of self are too great to be undone by much of anything or anyone.
Legally Blonde plays like an old-fashioned star vehicle. The entire movie revolves around Ms. Witherspoon to the point where the other actors have little to do except play second banana to her. While she certainly is an interesting enough actress to be the center of attention, I suspect the situation arose because of weaknesses in the script. There are other very talented players here, in particular Holland Taylor, Jennifer Coolidge and Ali Lartner, but their characters either aren't well developed or are too little seen. This type of satirical comedy works best when the lead has at least one strong character to work off of. One of the elements that made Election work so funny was that Witherspoon's ruthless character had a powerful adversary in that of Matthew Broderick's.
One of the movie's strongest assets is its costumes. Witherspoon has over fifty costume changes. These range from the outlandish to the bizarre to the fabulous. At the points where the movie dragged a bit, I was kept alert by wondering what on earth the star would appear in next. All this attention to clothing is appropriate because the focal point of Legally Blonde isn't about the legal profession. It's about what's fashionable. The emphasis here is definitely on blonde rather than legal.",1017705600,12,3158,4.860853432282004

This movie is not a classic, but it does show how appearance can affect the way people view you.  There are many funny scences throughout the picture and some serious ones also- it was a nice blend.  This movie was carried by Witherspoon and it was a great role for her.  I would watch this movie again and I recommend to anyone who likes a nice old-fashioned movie.",1015804800,,806,4.601398601398602
1640389,1,B00005O5CM,"It would probably hurt quite a bit to try and think of a film that I have seen in my nineteen years of living that is comically worse and more offensive to me as a viewer for wasting my time in a more pathetic way than MGM's Legally Blonde.
  I can imagine the pitch now. Some probably already-accomplished writers looking for a sure win with a predictable and contrived plot based around the seemingly humorous idea of a sweet, blonde, rich girl making it happen at Harvard law. The MGM executive probably told them to throw in a few jokes about shoes and hair coloring, add a cute dog wearing a gucci sweater, and take out the sex scene to gear it toward a wider audience...bam, they had a movie.
  Don't get me wrong, I am not usually this disgusted by pointless comedies. I have actually enjoyed a number of them, Billy Madison, Wayne's World, Earth Girls are Easy, all classics in my book. I believe the secret to comedy filmmaking success is all in the writing, and for the love of God, write for an audience with an average intelligence level that surpasses third grade. The main probelem that this film has is the storyline is terribly contrived, ignoring the entire 92 minutes of the film simply to reach the last scene. The comedy in between is poorly crafted, and the jokes are barely even able to be called jokes.
Take for instance a point in the movie when the main character, Elle Woods (played by Reese Witherspoon), discovers an important detail about a witness in a murder trial for which she is interning. The witness claims to have had an affair with the defendent, who is convicted of murdering her husband, and the affair is therefore proving the defendent's discontent with her marriage. Woods discovers that the witness is homosexual after he comments on her Prada shoes, and she quickly informs the cute grad student (played by Luke Wilson) that is assissting in the case of this fact so that they may discredit the witness. This is what she tells him, get this: ""He's gay...he knew who made my shoes...gay guys know designers, straight guys don't."" Okay, after I regained consciousness from this miraculuous truth of life being so plainly stated, I racked my brain for possible reasons that this premise, presented in this way, would be even remotlely humorous. I came up with nothing, but I did decide that the lack of effort on the writers' part to develop a better joke than...that...is part of the reason why this film is so poor.  First of all, the concept that comedy has brought to light in recent years that homosexual males care a great deal more about fashion than do straight males, got old around the fifth episode of Will and Grace. However, If the writers are adament about using this concept in this part of the film, the absolute LEAST they could do is present it in some sort of comedic form. Bluntly stating something in this manner is a form of comedy that can work, but in this case it failed so miserably I barely made it to the restroom in time to puke. I won't even mention the fact that this heroic discovery is hardly enough to discredit the witness testifying, as being homosexual would not exactly make having an affair with the opposite sex and impossible feat.
  The fact that I realized after sitting through this film is that Hollywood in cases like these assumes a large portion of it's audience are a bunch of mindless idiots that will enjoy this low, disgraceful form of comedy and laugh at all it's horribly failed attempts at jokes. I resent that assumption, and hope that the more people that don't purchase this film after reading this review are the more lives improved in this sense.
  I realized about five minutes into the film that it is impossible to slit my wrists with a DVD case. I was therefore forced to take one for the team, and immediately publish all the reasons why this film should be avoided at all costs.",1015286400,13,3886,4.587896253602305
1640390,4,B00005O5CM,"A friend lent me this DVD couple weeks ago and I absolutely had no expectation of the film.  The film actually made its theatrical release during the time of the year when box offices tend to slack - after summer and before Thanksgiving-Christmas push.  Anyway, the point made is that I'm so darn wrong about this film.  The first impression is not always right.  Legally Blonde is fun, inspring but not over-done.
Elle (Reese Witherspoon), a graduating fashion marketing major from CULA, had next tried hard for anything in her life.  Her well-to-do parents provide.  She is home-coming queen and the head of the sorority house she stayed in.  She is fashion savy and deeply in love with her boyfriend, Warner Huntington III.  Expecting Warner to propose to her on a very romantic date, her boyfriend instead decided to break up with her and leave for Harvard Law School because Elle was not serious and scholarly (well, hmmm...because blonde is usually flashy and flaunty) enough to be his girlfriend and that in order to be a future senator, Warner demanded a woman of more political charisma.  Her life collapsed and her dream shattered.  Brokenhearted and shattered, Elle realized that her only chance of getting Warner back was to pursue his interest and apply for Harvard Law.
The first part of the film is quite predictable in its plot.  What I really come to like about the film is the portrayal of Elle's character.  It is inspiring to see her transform through the film.  It also surprises many that though a fashion savy, Elle is not some stupid air headed bimbo as her appearance suggests her to be.  Elle is likable, amiable, heart-warming, and good-hearted.  The part where she befriends with the manucurist and helps her get the dog back really touches me.  I'm sure that the audience must have felt for her and wanted to see her succeed among her colleagues in school and win the approval of the Harvard elite.  Elle worked hard and exceled in her schoolwork.  Later on when she worked as an intern on defending a murder case, she was confused and frustrated about how people didn't take her seriously.  The result of that is maturing of her character.  Elle herself taught us how our first impression is not always right.  I don't want to give away too much of the story just so to ruin your viewing pleasure.  But Legally Blonde is a warm comedy that is worth seeing.",1015027200,,2386,4.71256038647343

He claims that she is not good or serious enough to be his wife, especially since he's going off to Harvard Law School.

1640393,3,B00005O5CM,"From start to finish, Legally Blonde was an enjoyable piece of brain candy.  It is not a profound film, a biting satire, or a gripping drama.  It is what it is....fluff.  Having been in a sorority before, I know that the film's treatment of Elle's beloved Delta Nu is over the top, but little else is, including her treatment at the hands of the Harvard law student body.
The film has its high points...the liposuction conversation, Elle arriving at Harvard for orientation (Woods, comma Elle), and her conversation with her family about her future.  It has its low points as well...and its low points are VERY low indeed.  I know Elle needed a friend, but why on earth did they pick a dowdy, stupid beautician to be her friend?  My god, that woman was irritating.  The ""bend and snap"" scene shouldn't have just been left out of the film, it should have been burned so it couldn't be included in a future director's cut.
The film is predictable....you know Elle will win back her snobbish boyfriend, you know she'll win over the Harvard elite, and you know going into the film's final scenes that she will easily win the case.
This film is great fun on a dreary Sunday afternoon when there's nothing else on.  I wouldn't buy it unless you're a big Reese Witherspoon fan...if you're not, I'd save my money and just rent it from Blockbuster.",1014681600,,1339,4.5966386554621845

The man of her dreams Warner Huntington the third dumps her because she isn't good enough and goes off to Harvard Law School. Elle is shattered. She decides the only thing she can do is get into Harvard Law school and win him back.
My Opinion: I wasn't expecting much going into Legally Blonde, but I knew I liked Reese Witherspoon. Little did I know that 96 minutes later I'd like her even more. Legally Blonde is one of those movies that people like to hate without seeing. They dismiss it because they think they know what it's about just like the characters in the movie think they know Elle and dismiss her. Both are wrong.  Legally Blonde is not a deep movie, but it's fun and it strikes a cord. It's an enjoyable experience and Reese is entirely loveable as the goodhearted Elle. Elle has never had to apply herself or work for anything, so everyone just dismisses her as another dumb blonde. It's no surprise that when she puts her mind to it, she gets results! It's also very fun to watch her changing wardrobe and hairstyle. I know it's hard to believe, but the term guilty pleasure fits this movie to a tee. You don't have to work hard watching it. All it wants to do is entertain you and make you happy. Thumbs up on both counts.

1640396,5,B00005O5CM,"""Legally Blonde"" was one of the funniest movies of 2001. It is the story of Elle Woods and how she goes to Harvard Law School so she could get back together with her boyfriend. Beyond this, she ends up being there for a much better reason. (To find that out just watch the movie.)

  Now let me go over the plot a little more. Elle Woods gets dumped by her boyfriend because he thinks that he needs a better girlfriend (to become a wife) if he is going to be a great senator. When she's dumped she decides that she must become a lawyer to get him back. After vigorous work to get into Harvard Law, she gets in and things take a turn for the worst.

 Actress Reese Witherspoon basically makes the movie what it is. This beautiful, talented woman puts on a show that you won't forget. She truly plays the role of what many people would call an everyday blonde. She talks like a rich girl, acts like one, etcetera.
  This movie reveals that blondes are not ""dumb"" and that they really are smart humans capable of doing what any other human with any other color hair can do.
  The setting of Harvard University is great and the students and faculty chosen for the roles are great. Many actors that have already been in other popular movies reappear here for a light role.
  I recommend ""Legally Blonde"" to anybody that wants to enjoy a funny movie with a good plot. Whether you are a blonde or not, this movie is a must. It reveals what a blonde female really is on the inside.",1014249600,,1473,4.300724637681159

This young woman is fashion savy but not an air headed bimbo.

She is kind hearted and has a positive attitude even though people look at her as a dim witted party girl.

Seeing them back together should have been a delight. But in this movie the first plays just plain stupid and the second a jealous, not too likeable character portrayed too positively. But the main reason I felt legally conned by this is how it sells itself as light comedy. That lured me in for an easygoing two hours of movie, but that ain't what I got. I wasn't in the mood for heavy-handed delvings into cutthroat competition and sexual harrassment.

1640402,4,B00005O5CM,"Reese Witherspoon is Elle Woods, a blonde and beautiful if slightly ditzy college senior whose life is turned upside-down when her rich boyfriend Warner Kensington the Third (Matt Davis) dumps her.  With her daddy's plastic, a bottomless wardrobe and a college career based on ""Fashion History"" Elle is something of a Barbie Doll come to cruel life.  Getting into Harvard Law School, and having a promising future ahead of him, Warner sees himself as a future JFK, and JFK isn't supposed to choose Marilyn over Jackie O.  Convinced that she still has a chance, Elle pulls out all the stops and manages to crack into the freshman class at school where she sticks out like a sore (and poorly accessorized thumb).  Making no friends, and confirming every dumb blonde stereotype ever conceived, Elle is ruthlessly victimized by her seemingly smarter and insecure classmates.  Elle wouldn't make it past her first day if not for her inexplicable capacity to dig out the common sense buried under the heady legal theory.  Instead, she sort of prospers becoming a success story and more mature person while still being the same cute Elle that only Reese Witherspoon can create.
It's a thin plot, and the tacked criminal trial added at the end seems an excuse to keep a lame idea going, but it works because, like Elle, the script has an endless reservoir of pluck and manages some cute tricks of its own.  The dim homilies guiding Elle's sorority lifestyle are bound by a fierce sense of loyalty (people who exercise can't kill people - the endorphins make them too happy), one that the script remains true to.  In the end, Elle wins her case because of her loyalty to an accused killer and former sorority sister, one that you'd never think twice about doubting.  Neither seem to deserve the attention or loyalty, but manage to win the case anyway.  See it if only for Reese Witherspoon.",1013126400,2,1881,4.795665634674923
1640403,2,B00005O5CM,"There is only one reason to see this movie and that is Reese Witherspoon. And with her bright, comic flair even she has to dog paddle through certain points of the film just to stay afloat.
A living Malibu Barbie, Elle Woods is a fashion design major. That is until her boyfriend announces he's going to Harvard Law and dumps her because Elle's image doesn't fit into his future plans of a life in politics. Still in love with the superficial louse, Elle decides to get her man and applies to Harvard Law School. Her application video is quite funny in it's over the top approach. Mesmerised by her audacious tape and impressed by her more obvious talents (hair, figure) the male admissions board alots an opening to the luscious Ms. Woods. Upon arriving at Harvard Law, Elle runs into her ex-flame and is surprised by his surprise at seeing her there. ""Like it's hard?"" she asks incredulously. The ex's new girlfriend is prim and proper, the ideal candidate's wife. She sets out to ridicule Elle, who sticks out like a sore thumb in this Ivy League enclave. After several setbacks, a depressed Elle finally finds a friend in the local beautician. Then encouraged by a seemingly sympathetic Professor,Elle decides to make the best out of her time at Harvard Law and does so with dogged determiniation (reminiscent of her performance in ELECTION).
Reese does an incredible job considering the poor material she's given. While the premise is full of comic potential, it is little more than that--a premise. The story is never fully developed so her setbacks and victories are pretty much one note.

when it came out in the summer, i thought it was a preppy movie and decided to not go see it.
but like Elle Woods says when she graduates ""First impressions aren't alwayas correct.""
a lot of my friends told me to watch it because i was missing out on a great movie, so i rented it.
at first it looks like your average preppy, high school/college ""chick flick"".
and she's a blonde so you expect her to be really dumb, but especially when she's buying a dress at the store you realize that she's way smarter then she looks.
this movie was great, it was funny but not hilarious funny.

""First impressions are not always correct. You must always have faith in people, and most importantly, you must always have faith in yourself.""
and she realizes that her boyfriend is a jerk, and so does the girl he was going out with.

1640407,3,B00005O5CM,"But I liked it.  This might be seen as a continuation of Election (1999) as a slightly dingier Reese Witherspoon graduates from ""CULA"" (sic) and goes on to Harvard Law School.  There's a kind of irony here--the real Reese Witherspoon with her drive and intelligence could actually do it.  Her character in the movie: I don't think so.  In fact, just about everything in the movie requires the maximum use of the suspension of disbelief option on the part of the audience because virtually nothing in the movie is real.
Well, the dogs are real, but I think they were drugged, they seem so passive.  Witherspoon, of course, is real, but her performance was a little weary in parts, as though she is tired of playing ditzy blonde airheads and would like something more serious.  This script understandably was very difficult to turn down since it practically amounts to a vehicle for her, and her character triumphs over every obstacle and ends up with a choice of two attractive men and a fast track career.
Selma Blair, whom I recall from Cruel Intentions (1999), provides fine support as the other girl.  Robert Luketic's direction while undistinguished is crisp and even witty at times and gets a lot out of a mediocre script.  However those who enjoyed Election might find the pandering to a mass audience in this one annoying.  Certainly there is no comparing the scripts.

1640415,4,B00005O5CM,"""Legally Blonde"" is a showcase for Reese Witherspoon that continues to highlight her talents.  The film draws comparisons with ""Clueless"" since the theme is essentially identical.  Elle (Witherspoon) progresses from a culturally challenged blonde bubblehead to a high achieving Harvard law student for all the wrong reasons.  All the while she has to endure mockery for her valley girl attitudes. Of course, she triumphs over east coast bigotry and over own limitations, but for all the wrong reasons.
The story is cute, but lacks the insight and nuance of ""Clueless"".  However, Witherspoon outdoes Alicia Silverstone's performance with her sheer energy and determination.  Both were excellent, but Witherspoon is the more dynamic.
The acting by the ensemble of supporting actors is very good and helps Witherspoon look that much better.  The cast is rich in aspiring actors with strong talent and little name recognition.  Of particular note are the performances of Selma Blair and Luke Wilson.  Blair plays the uppity girlfriend of Elle's former boyfriend Warner (Matthew Davis).  Blair is wonderfully condescending and catty throughout most of the film, but shows the ability to move into a softer, more likeable portrayal by the end.  Wilson's soft spoken demeanor is perfect for his nurturing role in this film.  His support is the catalyst that makes Elle's transition work.
Reese Witherspoon has been gradually moving to progressively larger parts for the last ten years, and at age 25 she made the leap to the lead with this film.  She definitely makes the most of the opportunity.  She simply dominates the entire film with a high energy performance that has as much steel as perfume.  She makes Elle as lovable as she is ridiculous, while instilling her with qualities that you can't help but admire as the film progresses.  If this is representative of the wattage she will bring to films, then her future is likely to be very bright.
This is not a great film, but it is very charming and watchable.  I rated it a 7/10.  We may look back on this film as the one that launched a prominent career.",1011398400,6,2106,4.988538681948424

Its a gr8 movie about a girl who gets to Harvard Law School just because her Boyfriend dumped her cuz he wanted a smarter law student to marry.

1640417,4,B00005O5CM,"I thought this was a pretty good show. For what it's worth, I thought Reese Witherspoon's two ex-roommates from her fashion design school days were a little tiring. I also thought the moment when the accused killer reveals the truth as to where she was when the crime took place - actually having liposuction - was overdone a bit too. Once could also argue that the witness revealed her guilt too quickly once her lie was exposed on the stand by Reese, which is a black mark against the script. Overall, however, the movie works. It not only reinforces the message that people shouldn't be judged by their appearance or first impression, but also has several very funny moments. Personally I liked this show way more than Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles (3 laughs for the whole movie) or America's Sweethearts (no laughs at all).
It was a nice change of pace to see a movie that did not rely heavily on profanity.",1010880000,,913,4.607361963190184

The juxtaposition of the ridiculous against the backdrop of normalcy is what makes this movie so hilarious!!

And you will do plenty of that if you watch this movie!  I screamed with laughter at the downright goofiness of just about everything in this movie--from the dorky matching outfits worn by the chihuahua and Reese, to the ultra furry pillows on her bed, to the dance scene in the beauty parlor!  My favorite part was when Reeses's character walks into her first pre-law class surrounded by all of these uber-brainiacs with their uptight attitudes and two-thousand dollar laptops, and in all seriousness takes out this pink fluffy pen and this 3-inch tall pink furry, heart shaped notebook in which to take notes!!!  I almost choked on a piece of popcorn,  I laughed so hard!! The utter ludicrousness of this movie is what makes it work! Reese Witherspoon is a gem--she plays ridiculous comedy with such a straight face to the hilt--priceless!!!

1640419,4,B00005O5CM,"When I first saw this movie with my teenage son, I admit that my expectations were not particularly high. Was I ever pleasantly surprised by this delightfully funny comedy! Reese Witherspoon does a star turn as the not so dumb, California airhead blonde, Ellie Woods, who is dumped by her college sweetheart, Warner, before graduation, instead of getting the anticipated and expected marriage proposal. It appears that he has political aspirations and an ostensibly dumb and flamboyant blonde is not what he envisions having for a wife.

Seeking to prove herself worthy and knowing that he is planning on attending Harvard Law School, Ellie, a fashion major, also seeks admission with dogged determination and studies her charming buns off in order to do well on the LSAT, the Law School Admission Test. Her high LSAT scores, coupled with her hilarious admission video, and her perfect college grade point average, albeit in Fashion,  get her through the portals of Harvard Law School, and the games begin in earnest.

What happens to her at Harvard is hilarious, as Ellie tries to get her former sweetheart back. She discovers, instead, something about herself that ultimately makes others sit up and take notice of her in a positive way. Reese Witherspoon is delightfully funny doing a comic turn and will have the viewer laughing almost immediately, while rooting for her. The supporting cast is likewise enjoyable. This is a funny, wacky comedy that is never mean spirited and is, instead, surprisingly uplifting.",1010793600,3,1517,5.108870967741935

The movie centers around Elle Woods and her relentless pursuit of the man of her dreams, whom she had been dating until he told her (on the night she thought he would propose) that she didn't fit properly into his family's ideals for a suitable future spouse for him.  This is when she did what every rational woman would do...
Apply for admission to Harvard Law School--where her ex was supposed to attend.  She studied her butt off and finally got in.  Then, she realised that this wasn't going to be as easy as she had hoped.

  Reese Witherspoon was excellent in her role as the sorority girl who goes to college seeking parties and a husband.  When her boyfriend dumps her instead of proposing she goes into a depression and comes up with a plan to get him back.  What actually transpires is that she gets back at him by finding out who she is and going after it despite what other people said or thought.
  The DVD had some extras about the making of the movie and the importance and time spent on Reese's hair color and style.  Now, usually that sounds stupid and not something I would ever want to see, but it really gave you an appreciation for what could be a small detail, but a huge deal.  All the extras were worth watching.

1640424,3,B00005O5CM,"This Hollywood vehicle for bigger-than-life actress (though it's p.c. now to say ""actor"" instead) Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly polished and funny, not the mindless hackwork one might expect from its marketing campaign.  The story is shamelessly derivative, true, with obvious nods to THE PAPER CHASE, MY COUSIN VINNIE, CLUELESS, and, it's easy to imagine, any number of other movies I've missed.  No matter:  It's a hoot, and works fine on its own terms.
It's entertainingly written, capably directed, and uniformly well-crafted in every area: acting, casting (several of the bit players are dead-on), costuming, set design, cinematography, editing.  Not a ""deep"" film, but fun, with some hip, timely satire.

1640425,4,B00005O5CM,"Walking through the aisles of the video store on a Friday night is not an exciting adventure when most of the movies are gone.  Looking at the rows of empty boxes, the remaining videos were surely second-rate.  The mood at the moment was for an exciting thriller, until the one desired was gone as well.  Glossing over the remainder of misfits, LEGALLY BLONDE was still in stock.  Reaching up to take the movie, I quickly withdrew it with the notion that possibly someone had returned the one I really had a hunkering to see.  However, the idea was shot down as the clerk said, ""Sorry sir.""  With all the resolve one could muster, the hand shaking as though it was working against its master, once again reached for LEGALLY BLONDE.
Darn it!  Those first impressions are not always right, you know, thinking this movie was CLUELESS II.  It was much more than a dumb blonde movie, but remarkably a refreshing 'you can do anything you set your mind to do' film.
Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) has everything going for her.  She is a peppy Southern California beauty, runner-up in a Miss Hawaiian Tropic Contest, sorority president, and carries a 4.0 GPA at UCLA in Fashion Designing.  Moreover, she is optimistic of becoming the wife of Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis), a handsome and successful young man from a prominent family of lawyers, whose desire is to be a senator by age 30.
Expecting Warner to pop the question, Elle is devastated to hear that he wants to end the relationship.  His reason is even more shattering; ""He needs a Jackie, not a Marilyn.""  In other words, Elle carries a social stigma and persona that the world will see, and it is not the style of the Huntington tradition.  She is 'illegally blond.'
Being an 'illegal blond' in Warner's eyes, Elle is determined to follow him to Harvard Law School and regain his affection.  With her tenacious spirit and resolve, she passes the entrance exam, and produces a creatively funny autobiographical video for the school officials, to which they acknowledge Harvard's need for 'diversity.'  Elle is in.  Now, she must prove to Warner, the world, but more importantly to herself, that she is LEGALLY BLONDE.
Reese Witherspoon played the role of the blonde California girl with a lot of moxie.  Her character was not the CLUELESS Cher Horowitz, played by Alicia Silverstone in 1995, but a smarter goal-driven blonde.  Sad to say, Silverstone, typecast with her dumb blonde character, never really rebounded from it.  The same type thing happened with Raquel Welch, who had a bit part in this film as Mrs. Windham-Vandermark.  It is ironic that Welch was in this flick for she was typecast as a buxom beauty in her own career. One can only hope Reese will not suffer the same, because all three ladies are terrific actresses.
The movie watcher cannot help falling in love with Elle for she is more than dropdead gorgeous, but smart, determined, and compassionate.  She struggles in her relationship with fellow law students and professors, but extends a hand to other outcasts in the film such as Paulette (Jennifer Coolidge), the divorced manicurist, and David the Dork (Oz Perkins).  Moreover, Elle personifies integrity as she withholds the alibi of her client from her law professor.
In conclusion, this is a surprisingly good movie, especially for first-time director, Robert Luketic; however, without the performance of Witherspoon the film would have been almost illegal.  The movie is terribly predictable, but fun and entertaining.  Rent it or buy it...it's LEGALLY okay.",1010275200,,3548,4.9144295302013425

There were moments when I laughed out loud, but I couldn't tell you now what I laughed at.  The moments I do remember are the ones that made me not like the movie.
Reese Witherspoon gives a likable performance.  Having very blond roots though I was expecting to see more analysis, not just tricks pulled out of a hat when you just need to know how permed hair is treated to win a case.  I wanted her to succeed, and was glad when she did, but I never quite made it to what I'd call cheering for her.
The relationships in the film also fell flat.  With one exception. Watching her help the manicurist first get her puppy back and then bolster her courage to get the man she wants was the best relationship in the film.
After all that complaining you might wonder why I bothered to give ""Legally Blonde"" 3 stars instead of 1 or 2.  The fact was I did enjoy watching it.  I just don't feel that it's one for the keeper shelf.",1010188800,2,1081,4.203883495145631

Aside from being very funny, it also has a deep meaning to it. Never judge from the appearance only, things are not always what they look, actually they RARELY are what they look. And this is what Elle Woods, the main character, wants to prove. Greatly interpreted by Reese Witherspoon, Elle looks and behaves like a girl straight out of a blond joke. She sees silly and shallow at first (but extremely funny!), but then you change your mind quickly when you see how she reacts to her boyfriend dumping her because she doesn't fit into his plan of becoming senator, she's too pretty, too perfect, wears too much pink, and she's too... blond. You start really liking Elle when she gets admitted to Harvard, and start being a real fan of hers when she shows how she can gain respect for being smart and a good student even when still wearing flashy designer clothes.
This movie shows you that a woman has many resources and that being good-looking and caring about one's appearance doesn't mean one doesn't care about anything else. It will make you laugh, but it will also make you think. And you'll probably want to watch it again!",1010016000,,1318,4.518828451882845
1640429,4,B00005O5CM,"I rented this movie expecting highly entertaining, enjoyable fluff.
This movie was all that -- but also so much more. Legally Blonde is one of the most subversive mainstream movies I've seen in a long time. I would go so far as to call it a daring stab in the back to to the feminist backlash in its assertion that independent, empowered women come in all shapes, sizes and haircolors.
This film, on the surface, appears to feed into our culture's stereotypes of women. We pigeonhole and define women by their appearances, and judge them through harsh dichotomies -- virgin/whore, beautiful and stupid/ugly and brainy. Such categorizations help prevent women from uniting and overthrowing the patriarchal establishment.
Witherspoon's Elle must work hard to overcome the preconceptions that come w/ her background, appearance and experience, but she eventually succeeds in asserting her intelligence, her independence and her determination to a doubtful student body. The judgement she initially receives from her more traditionally ""feminist""-ish fellow law students eventually turns to respect and friendship. Women unite themselves across societally-imposed boundaries, and the result is energizing, encouraging and entertaining.
Legally Blonde is comedy at its best -- a substantive message well disguised in the form of light-hearted entertainment.",1009929600,2,1352,5.632352941176471

Reese Witherspoon is the poor, unfortunate girl with the beautiful blonde hair and the perfect figure.  No one takes her seriously, so she has the ""valley girl"" role down pat, but during the course of the movie, she finds out she's not so dumb after all.

This movie is full of hilarious lines (""whoever said orange was the new pink was seriously disturbed!""), lots of laughs, and a strange view of what college life is about.  But Reese Witherspoon, a fantastic actress in my opinion, has another great role in this movie.  A dumb blonde who is actually not blonde.  A blonde who can do anything.  A blonde who will take over the world!
Elle Woods, sorority president, fashion major and owner of a chihuahua, expects the love of her life to propose to her, but instead he breaks up with her, telling her that he cannot be with her since she is not a Jackie Kennedy Onasis, but a Marilyn Monroe.  Since he is going off to Harvard law with aspirations to be a senator, Elle decides that the way to win him back is to enter Harvard law school as well.

Reese Witherspoon delivers a powerhouse performance as Elle Woods, a ditzy yet lovable blonde who has, for her entire life, never been regarded as the ""serious"" type. Nobody has ever seen her that way, and that has never bothered Elle before, but it really gets to her when her cocky boyfriend Warner dumps her for that very reason and heads off to Harvard Law School. Thinking that she might still have a chance of winning back Warner's heart,  Elle also decides to enroll. Her remarkable imput on things gradually brings her to the head of her class, but throughout most of the movie, love is the one thing she's after. In an attempt to find a ""serious"" girlfriend, Vivian is Warner's top choice. This girl is serious, all right, and she's Elle's biggest competition. While working on her studies and striving to get Warner back, Elle helps her insecure manicurist find love and works on an important trial case which profiles Brooke Taylor--Elle's biggest fan--suspected guilty of murder. With her evident charm and intelligence, Elle proves herself worthy of being taken seriously, and by the time the movie is over, all you can do is admire her for everything she's done. Reese Witherspoon played the part perfectly, and I can't imagine anyone playing this designated role with more energy and spunk. This is one of those movies that's so bright and funny, it's almost impossible not to like it. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. It's perfect, no matter what mood you're in.

1640435,3,B00005O5CM,"In ""Legally Blonde,"" - which could well be re-titled ""Clueless Goes to Harvard""  - the delightful Reese Witherspoon stars as a ditzy, fashion-obsessed airhead who winds up (through plot complications too elaborate to go through) taking that Ivy League law school by storm.  Needless to say, there is not a single believable moment in the film, but that is generally the case with most fish-out-of-water scenarios anyway.  What ""Legally Blonde"" does have is a warm spirit, a bubbly demeanor and a breezy charm that reflect to a tee the personality of its main character.
Although the film does not exhibit the same level of comic genius we found in ""Clueless,"" Witherspoon's letter-perfect rendition of the bubblehead stereotype earns the film a great deal of audience goodwill, a factor that helps us to get over some of the movie's flatter moments.  For indeed, throughout the course of this tale, we do hit a number of arid stretches where we feel that we should be laughing an awful lot more than we are.  In fact, ""Legally Blonde"" occasionally feels more like a concept in search of a movie than a full-fledged work in its own right.  But, just as you are about to give up on it, the filmmakers hit upon a hilarious concept, sight gag or line of dialogue, which help to set the movie back on track.
Clearly, Witherspoon is the big selling point of this film.  As an actress, she exudes such an air of intelligence, confidence and compassionate goodwill that she invests even her dumb blonde character with those seemingly paradoxical traits.  ""Legally Blonde"" isn't always at the top of its form, but Witherspoon wins the case for the film hands down anyway.",1009584000,4,1662,4.807017543859649

Reese is Elle Wood, the beautiful Valley Girl whom no one will take seriously because she's too pretty and fashion-conscious for somber, earnest Cambridge, MA, and because her main object in attending law school -- at least when she first arrives -- is to win back her snobbish ex-boyfriend.  Will Elle discover that law is her true calling?  Will she turn out to be brilliant?  Will she amaze everyone in a courtroom scene?  Are you kidding, does the sun rise in the east?  The courtroom scene is about as plausible as the idea that she'd be allowed to keep her pet Chihuahua in a university residence hall, but hey, who cares?
Part of the fun, if you've ever been near Harvard, is that although the Cambridge types are caricatured, they're not exaggerated all that much.  I've met the brilliant, eccentric guy with a facial tic, the militant feminist, and a lot of others there.

Elle is going to have the fight of her life to win back Warner but in the process she discovers something far more important... she discovers believing in herself can take her farther than she ever expected. I will not give away any more, but I will say this is a fun movie that will make you laugh. It is in the tradition of such movies like Never Been Kissed, and Miss Congeniality which are just plain fun entertainment which is what these  kinds of movies are meant to do entertain. I would also like to say Reese Witherspoon is one of the most talented actors today, and without her this movie would have not worked as well as it did. This movie was made on a 18 million dollar budget and by the end of its run in movie theatres it ranked in 95 million, not bad at all. If your looking for a feel good movie that at times is a little over the top, and if you have a sense of humor than you will enjoy this movie. Regardless of what some of the other reviewers say LEGALLY BLONDE is a great movie and I encourage any of you to BUY this DVD as it is just a blast to watch and/or makes a great Christmas gift for any teenager.",1007942400,2,1719,4.055882352941176

Reese Witherspoon does an amazing job in playing Elle Woods, a Delta Nu Sweetheart and Homecoming Queen, who decides to attend Harvard Law in order to get her boyfriend back. The way she handles this is hilarious, and you'll see that being blonde doesn't automatically mean you're stupid.

The message here is ""Don't judge a book by its cover"".  And we could all use a lesson in that.  The outer shell is never the entire story when it comes to each individual person.  Not only is REESE WITHERSPOON'S character an example of that, but everyone in the movie is.  That's the best part about Legally Blonde.  Reese's character is not what she appears to be on the surface and the producers don't stop there.  Some characters are what they appear, and some surprise you.
Although Legally Blonde isn't much better than average when it comes to movies, it does make its point in a fun and entertaining way.",1007856000,,724,4.573643410852713

I have to say this people - I was pleasantly surprised. I think you all will too. The radiant Reese Witherspoon gets her first real big film playing Elle Woods, a blonde sorority girl who everybody assumes is just another ditzy blonde. After her piggish boyfriend dumps her because, as a law student, he needs somebody more like Jackie Kennedy on his arm. Not Marilyn Monroe. Elle, determined to prove people wrong about her, decides to go to Harvard to study in law and get her boyfriend back. She must of really loved him. Why would anyone want him back?. (...) Reese Witherspoon is a jewel. Plain and simple. She's as cute as a bug in a rug. She attacks the role with full force gusto and, in the process, gives a winning comedic performance that should win her a lot more faithful followers. She's teriffic. The jokes here are all pretty quick and funny. I laughed out loud a few times. I wasn't expecting it at all. It's a real great film for 'Girl Power'. It definitley has a nice message going. The movie isn't 'male bashing' as has been said. Please. Get over it people. The movie isn't obscenity laced(as stated by a review below). A few moments of the ""A"" word here and there, but that's it. Not what I call obscenity laced. What movie were they watching?!. The supporting cast is exceptional. The best being Jennifer Coolidge(American Pie 1 & 2, Best In Show), as a hairstylist that Elle befriends. Raquel Welch also pops up in a very brief cameo. The movie may be innocent fluff, but that's a good thing. Fluff is always a good thing. This is fluff that even male friends of mine have liked. Give this sweet movie a try.

Here's a plot breakdown: Elle Woods (played by Reese Witherspoon), a fashion major in CA, gets dumped by her boyfriend when she had previously thought he would be proposing to her that night. He says he wants to stop fooling around if he ever wants to be a senator. He goes to Harvard law school. Elle, determined to impress him, follows him there. When she starts out, she hates it because all the people there think she's just another dumb blonde. Then she starts doing better, making some friends (including a divorced manicurist whom she helps to get her dog back), and she ends up with an important case.

Where this DVD really shines, tough, is in the special features.  I'm not generally a big fan of DVD special features, but these ones are really worth watching.  I especially liked the ""trivia track"", which adds ""pop-up video""-style trivia bubbles throughout the film.
Another nice feature was the inclusion of crew commentary in addition to the one by the director and Reese Witherspoon.  The crew can give a completely different perspective on the making of any movie, and I'd like to see more DVDs include this kind of material.
I also liked ""The Hair That Ate Hollywood"", a short documentary on what they did to Reese Witherspoon's hair for the movie.  I never realized just how much work could go into making a beautiful blonde continue to look like a beautiful blonde, and it makes for an entertaining short.
My only complaint on the special features is that they put the supplemental material on the flip side of the DVD, rather than on a second DVD.  I would normally like that approach, because I normally don't like the special features, but in this case, it would have been nice to have both parts playable on my DVD changer.",1007683200,5,1403,4.753086419753086

The guy she's seeing doesn't want to see her anymore because she's not serious. To win him back, she applies for an upscale school to study to become an attorney. And eventually gets in the school with mostly her looks but also common sense...logic.

One of the holes I had the biggest problem with was that she took the LSATs at the last minute and breezed through it, and then turned around and applied to law school.

Reese shines as a student who goes from a fashion merchandising school in CA then goes to Harvard Law school to get the man of her dreams.  Her portrayal of Elle is great because,  she never comes off dumb as stereotypes suggest. Au contraire. She comes off as independent, smart and very savvy in the wiles of womanhood.  Bravo!

She has a great comic ability and her timing is impeccable.  She is very talented, and in my opinion, is a bit underrated as an actress.
Enough about the Blonde, and on to the movie.  The main character, Elle Woods, played by Reese, has been kicked to the curb by her man because she isn't smart enough.  It takes an episdoe like this to get Elle to prove to herself that she is smart.  While she acts pretty ditzy, and graduates with a Bachelors in Fashion Design, she decides to try and get into Harvard Law School as that is where the ex boyfriend goes.  She wants to show him that she is smart enough for him.  One of the funniest parts is her ""video essay"" she sends to the school and the board of admissions is viewing it.  I laughed through this entire scene.  She is accepted.
Along the way, she learns a lot about herself, and she meets some pretty funny characters.  When she goes into a nail boutique for an emergency manicure, she meets Paulette Bonafonte, played hilariously by Jennifer Coolidge.  They become fast friends.  She meets Emmett, played by the sweet and charming Luke Wilson, at the school.  He is a lawyer who is also an assistant to Elle's worst professor.  He becomes her new love interest, and Emmett is sweet to her and believes in her more than Warner ever did.  Elle is the underdog, but in the end she wins out.  This is a good rental.

1640469,4,B00005O5CM,"Reese Witherspoon, in a 5 star performance makes the ""Legally Blonde"" DVD rentable.  Like Alicia Silverstone in Clueless, Reese carries the film.  She is so confident and charismatic in her performance as a seemingly dumb blonde (a sharpie in blonde's clothing) that the film is worth a rent.
Other positives:  great soundtrack of girl songs, terrific DVD features about the making of the movie and the outtakes - there are a huge amount of extras here.
What makes it not ""buyable""?  The rest of the cast is forgettable, unlike Clueless, which featured great support for Silverstone, Reese is forced to carry the movie.  Both love interests are unworthy of her and there is little or no chemistry, there are no breakout character actresses in the ranks of other students in the sorority or in law school.  The familiar actor playing the high powered law school professor, Callahan, changes so quickly into a lounge lizard, it will make your head spin.  The actress who plays Paulette, the manicurist that Elle befriends, is not believable in the role.  Exceptions?  A great chihuahua, and the fabulous Holland Taylor as the woman law school professor....
In an effort to transform a California girl into a Harvard Law student, the filmmakers go too far into the ""Barbie syndrome""...fashions and accessories are too girlie and just too adolescent to be believable.  A great illustration - while Elle is getting ready for her ""engagement dinner"" (which turns out to be where she gets dumped) she tries on a knockout dress in turquoise.  Unbelievably, she appears ready for dinner in a cheap red and black number, instead.
A nice flick for chicks where the misunderstood heroine gets more than just the man she adores, she shows the world she is a person of quality, without giving up the girlish touches that make her unique.  Witherspoon proves she can carry a comedy, but her film presence is so strong, we all hope it will translate into meatier roles in the future, and not just give her the opportunity to host Saturday Night Live.",1005955200,15,2034,4.880813953488372

1640473,4,B00005O5CM,"I love to see a good actress really enjoying herself, but at the same time remaining in CONTROL of a part, especially in a comedy. Reese Witherspoon is incredibly good in this role of Elle, a spurned sorority airhead who decides to follow her former fiance to Harvard in order to get him to marry her after all.
The holes in the plot are easy to ignore because of her acting, which is fun and terrific. In fact, I bet even the men in the family could stand to watch this. It's ""cute"" but a guy could handle it. It's funny enough.
Witherspoon, wearing her absurdly inappropriate outfits and residing in her out-of-place, out-of-her-mind  Harvard Law Scool dorm room (she even has fuzzy pink fluff covering her princess phone) reminds me, in this role of Elle, of the fabuolous Judy Holiday or some of the other actresses of earlier eras who could immerse themselves so gratifyingly in a comedy that you would end up just relaxing and going with whatever the ridiculousness was.
And ridiculous this is...but it's really well done.
And the reason it's well done is Reese Witherspoon. Fun supporting cast too..especially that doll who played the beauty parlor buddy. What a sweetie.
I enjoyed this more than eating cotton candy, which is about the level of seriousness at which you should take it. It's all in good fun and for that it gets four stars from me.",1005523200,,1355,4.645833333333333

In ""Legally Blonde,"" one might expect voracious amounts of high-pitched voices, pouting, and out-of-nowhere remarks and comments that have become the constituent image for blondes everywhere. The movie includes all of these things, no doubt, but somehow manages to cast them in a witty and extremely humorous light, while also possessing a heart and soul that are easy to relate to. It's a priceless comedic gem, and gave me every reason to fall into its spell.
In a performance that is easily likeable and irresistibly charming, Reese Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, who hopes to be accepted to Harvard Law School to prove to her ex-boyfriend that she's not too stupid to be a lawyer's wife. With a 4.0 grade average, a fashion major from CULA, and a video essay featuring herself and others in bikinis (a tactic made funnier by the fact that she doesn't realize the effect she will have on the all-male board at Harvard), she is accepted, and arrives intent on winning back her man.
Of course, things are not all parties and homecomings, and she soon discovers that no one really cares to be around her. Former prospective fianc&eacute; Warner is now engaged to the snotty Vivian Kensington, leaving Elle's plans in the cold. With no one to turn to except for Paulette, a manicurist with low self esteem, Elle decides to take life into her own hands, and quickly learns the tricks of the trade at Harvard.
This is where the movie takes on a personality much like its main character. By setting out to prove her worth as a law student, Elle shows a determination full of energy and real drive. By doing so, she becomes more than just the stereotypical blonde bombshell everyone sees her as, and in allowing her character to expand, the movie generates into something more than just an average teen comedy.
The laughs are almost non-stop, filled with a sense of humor that has great taste and tact. Much of this has to do with the movie's mockery of all things blonde, while at the same time embracing them so that the humor isn't hurtful or insulting. From pinks skirts and high heels, to a fuzzy phone and a Chihuahua that she dresses in matching outfits, Elle's persona is a riotous display of the typical air-headedness given an atypical treatment through the display of her kindness.
Her gentle nature and her unwillingness to give it up also gives the feel-good factor a shot in the arm of confidence. The movie covers just about every lesson you can think of, from friendship and broken hearts, to first appearances and loyalty, and takes on a moral that is good, clean fun without being overly sentimental. Take the scene in which Elle helps Paulette stand up to her ex-husband. Elle uses her technical language to completely confuse him and retrieve Paulette's dog, and the scene becomes funny and touching at the same time.
The sheer joy and glee one gets from watching a movie like this can be the result of nothing less than satisfaction. It brought a smile to my face and laughter to my heart, and gave me a warm feeling inside that most comedies cannot. ""Legally Blonde"" never oversteps the bounds of good humor, nor is it ever too saccharine for its own good. If nothing else, it proves the age-old saying that blondes do have more fun.",1005436800,30,3513,4.704545454545454

The double-sided DVD contains much more commentary and information than any normal human could stand to absorb, but if I were a student looking to learn about the movie industry this would be a good place to start.
For some reason, either the transfer to disc or the original print has strangely saturated colors that had me scrambling to adjust the color, tint, brightness and contrast on my television until I gave up and decided the effect, which I didn't like at all, may have been intentional, although the cinematographer's audio commentary didn't mention it.
People who live in Massachusetts may find the cheesy attempts to use locations in Pasadena to pass for Cambridge to be the most entertaining aspect of this film.",1005436800,,860,4.931034482758621
1640476,4,B00005O5CM,"Don't judge a book by it's cover.  An old saying we've all heard so many times it doesn't seem to mean anything anymore.  But it does mean something, and it's important; and, before we proceed, go back and read it again.  In fact, let me help you:  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  There.  Now take a moment to think, really think about it.  And if it still doesn't mean anything, take a couple of hours and check out ""Legally Blonde,"" a comedy with some real teeth in it, directed by Robert Luketic and starring Reese Witherspoon.  The premise of the story has to do with upscale sorority girl Elle Woods (Witherspoon), who instead of getting the long awaited, much anticipated marriage proposal from her boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis), finds herself jilted as he prepares to leave for Harvard Law School.  Elle, it seems, just doesn't fit the oh-so-serious, somber profile that the wife of a future Senator must have.  It's all about image, and Elle's own 4.0 grade average earned in her ""frivolous"" curriculum apparently doesn't carry any weight.  Being outgoing, positive, beautiful AND intelligent just won't do among the ""serious"" of the ""upper crust"" elite.  So, because she looks good and enjoys her life, Elle is given the gate, and she just can't understand why.  She's devastated.  But she's also smart.  Smart enough to pick herself up and make a decision that stands them all on their ears.  With the grades and the wherewithal to swing it, she enters Harvard Law herself, initially with the intent of winning back Warner.  But along the way she  learns something important-- about the way things really are, about people and about herself, as well.  And she sets out to prove that if there is any ""shallowness"" around, it's only in the minds of those who perceive her as something and someone other than what she really is.  And, for the viewer, right out of the gate this is someone you want to see succeed in her quest, because her triumph-- whatever it may be or however it comes out-- is going to be one you share right along with her.
 Make no mistake, this is one funny movie-- in fact, it's downright hilarious at times.  But beyond the laughter it evokes, there's a flip side to the same coin.  Because beyond all of the comedy there is some serious issues at the heart of this film, and anyone who's ever been subjected to trials and tribulations simply because they didn't happen to fit a certain ""mold,"" or coincide with someone else's ""opinions"" of the way things should be, will be able to identify with Elle's situation.  And it's something you have to be aware of, because even while you're laughing at the funny stuff, at the same time it's almost painful to watch Elle endure the senseless, heartless, unnecessary and unwarranted acts that are perpetrated upon her.  At the core of the matter is not only the need for tolerance and understanding, but the necessity and importance of keeping an open mind about everything that transpires around you.  Who knows what monumental contributions an individual is capable of making in this imperfect machinery we call society if they are prejudged into oblivion?  So there's a lot more to this film than meets the eye; ""dumb blonde"" jokes get nipped in the bud, and by using a comedy format, the filmmakers here have produced a film that is not only entertaining, but thoroughly thought-provoking, as well.
 Reese Witherspoon opens herself up and gives a dynamic performance here as Elle; she conveys such a full-of-life spirit that it is easy to empathize with her, and when the hurt comes, you feel it with her.  And through it all, the way she takes it on the chin then moves on with her life makes her a role model for those who may find themselves in a similar situation.  On one hand, when Elle finds solace by getting a manicure at the local beauty shop, it makes for a falling-on-the-floor moment of hilarity, and yet you're always aware of that other side of the coin, as well.  And it makes you root for her all the more.  Witherspoon has a perky, vibrant screen presence that makes her perfect for this part, and she makes Elle a flawed and therefore very real person.  When she gets knocked down, you feel for her; and then there's that feeling of triumph when she gets back up and stands her ground.  There's no question that this is Witherspoon's movie, and it's one of the best performances of her career.
 The supporting cast includes Luke Wilson (Emmett), Selma Blair (Vivian), Victor Garber (Professor Callahan), Jennifer Coolidge (Paulette), Holland Taylor (Professor Stromwell), Ali Larter (Brooke Taylor-Windham), Jessica Cauffiel (Margot), Linda Cardellini (Chutney), Alanna Ubach (Serena) and Oz Perkins (Dorky David), with a special appearance by Raquel Welch as Mrs. Windham-Vandermark.  An entertaining, accessible film that should be embraced by a wide audience because of the clever way in which it gets across it's message, ""Legally Blonde"" can be enjoyed by just taking it at face value and soaking up the jokes, but offers even greater rewards to those who really delve into it and see it as an examination of human nature.  Not always, but occasionally, a movie is so much more than what it appears to be on the surface, and this is one of them.  What makes it so good is the fact that it can really make you laugh, while at the same time it's subtly telling you that there is no place for cruelty within the realm of human relationships.  It's a film that's worth seeing many times over, and that's the magic of the movies.",1005436800,8,5535,4.726041666666666
1640477,4,B00005O5CM,"Reese Witherspoon saves this movie from mediocrity. This is, in fact, a bland, hackneyed, completely predictable, badly scripted, and unoriginal flick that Reese Witherspoon single-handedly elevates to utterly delightful light entertainment.
I have been a Reese Witherspoon fan for a long time, though not always knowingly. About ten years ago I saw on cable a delightful movie about a young girl learning about love called THE MAN IN THE MOON. The young (14 years old) actress in the main role just sparkled, and although I didn't remember her name, I remembered the movie. Last summer, I was looking through my video store, saw the cover for the movie, and thought I would double check the name of the actress, to see if she had gone on to any sort of success. I was delighted and shocked to see that the movie had starred Reese Witherspoon.
As much as I have enjoyed her in PLEASANTVILLE and ELECTION, I absolutely didn't expect that she would be able to carry a film to the degree that she did this one. She did more than carry the film: she made a bad film good. And that is a rare achievement indeed. I really do think that Reese Witherspoon's best films are ahead of her. She has talent, charm, intelligence, and versatility.
So, I definitely recommend this film, but only for one reason: Reese Witherspoon. Besides her, there are just no reasons to see this film.",1005436800,,1371,4.6929460580912865

Elle (Reese Witherspoon) is determained to proove that she's got what it takes to make it as a lawyer. That's basically how it goes in a nutshell. There are some surprises and it's filled with humor.

The deleted scenes are great, and the two behind-the-scenes documentaries are quite interesting (the way the young director was found and hired; the selling of the author's first novel, the pain of having to find just the RIGHT blonde shade for Reese's hair, etc.)
The studio has wisely split the extras up on to two sides of the DVD, so that everything can be easily played on any DVD player (some DVD players have trouble playing DVD's that have too much compressed information on them).
There's also pop-up trivia that comes up that tells you all about the making of the movie, history of cast and crew, etc.  (You can turn this function off if you just want to watch the regular movie.)  As far as the movie goes- Reese Witherspoon turns in yet another spectacular performance.  Is she America's new sweetheart?  Why, yes!  I think she is!  This movie was sort of marketed as a stupid, mindless comedy- which is a shame because it's not really that at all.  This movie has got a lot of heart and hilarity- great story, acting, EVERYTHING is perfect.

I hope I'm not being sexist but girls and women will LOVE this movie but judging by most of the comments from other guys I overhead leaving the movie theatre, most men will HATE or at least pretyend to hate this movie, although obviously I'm a guy and I enjoyed it.

She plays a sorority girl majoring in Fashion who is actually very bright but doesn't at all follow the sterotype of what a ""smart girl"" looks or acts like.  When her boyfriend dumps her because he wants someone smarter, she follows him out of desparation to Harvard Law School (her brains and creativity get her in).  At first she finds it all a struggle, but once she knows in her heart that she really is smart, she surprises everyone.  Great example of how things are not always as they appear.  I loved her dog.

For decades Hollywood has been throwing at the audience all of these Ugly Duckling stories depicting the inner beauty of a person.  This film is a welcome departure in the complete opposite direction.  For once the girl is shunned for her beauty, creating a delightful and funny tale that never takes itself too seriously.  Witherspoon is perfect in all aspects (yes of course phsyical) and don't judge the ""legal"" aspect of the title too heavily, but bring your sense of humor and this film won't fail to entertain you.

1640488,4,B00005O5CM,"If you like your movies pink and frilly, preferably with plenty of toenail-painting, then this is your _Citizen Kane_.  As a fan of the ""girliness is powerful"" film genre, I definitely enjoyed _Legally Blonde_.
As lots of reviewers have said, what keeps _Legally Blonde_ is Reese Witherspoon's wonderfully ingenuous performance as the apparently vacuous blonde who turns out to be the smartest person at Harvard Law, as well as the nicest, kindest and definitely the pinkest.  She's wonderful, and the film has enough energy and girl-affirming moments to mostly smoothe you over a few doubts.
The doubts include the fact that the film itself isn't nearly as nice as its lead character.  Gays could give this film a miss if they're tired of being portrayed, and ridiculed, as mincing queens, and while the angry lesbian character is eventually softened, she spends most of the film being a different sort of cliche.  And some of the film's apparent satirical targets (Westie air-head culture, Eastie uptight sorority culture, the expectation that an engagement ring is the highest possible thing a girl can aim for, to name three) turn out to be affirmed, not undermined, by the movie's end.  And the semi-serious end, where our heroine makes the graduation keynote speech (in praise of diversity) is crying out to be leavened by a joke, and it isn't: it's meant to be taken seriously.  We don't need that sort of TV movie ending; we need More Comedy, dammit!
And then I notice that the jokes are often a bit small, and a bit too far apart.  When you're watching a comedy, mostly enjoying it, but you notice that the first gag to come along in a while has been a shot of the heroine's dog wearing a comical costume ... When the dog gets the best lines, or at least sight gags, you start to feel that the scriptwriters haven't worked quite as hard on this film as they should have.
But I'm over-analysing, sure.  Reese Witherspoon's bright-eyed performance as a blonde who is never as dumb as she lets herself appear is a joy.  It's got a great soundtrack of California girl-rock, important tips about perm maintenance and the importance of keeping up with this year's shoes...  And it flies along having fun.  The script's nowhere near as good as girl-movie classics like _Clueless_ or even _Michelle and Romy's High School Reunion_, but _Legally Blonde_ has a star who is a phenomenon, and it has enough energy to persuade you to drop your critical faculties for 85 sugar-candied minutes.
The best girl-movie of the Millenium!  Well, as at October 2001, and counting...  Anyway, Recommended for girl-movie fans.
Cheers!

1640490,5,B00005O5CM,"If ever a movie succeeded on the back of its star, Legally Blonde fits that description.  The movie takes a seemingly implausible plot - blonde wants to keep boyfriend so she enrolls in law school - and with the charms of Reese Witherspoon, makes it a joyful and fun movie.
Elle Woods (Witherspoon), blonde Calfornia girl, thinks her preppie boyfriend Warner is going to propose.  But Warner thinks he needs a serious gilfriend so he dumps Elle for the brunette and more stoic Sarah.  Determined to win Warner back, Elle decides to follow him to Harvard Law School.  Elle's admissions video is an absolute hoot.  It is nice that Witherspoon is fi8nally being noticed, after standout performances in ""Pleasantville"" and the best of movie of 1999, ""Election"".  (Sorry ""American Beauty"".)  The success of ""Legally Blonde"" has openned new door for her and we can expect a sequel to this and a ""Honey West"" series, as well as ""The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing"".
While in law school, Elle is not taken seriously. She shows up in class with a flowered pen and a heart-shaped note pad.  Finally, she breaks down and buys a pink I-mac.  The contrast between the bubbly blonde Elle and the dour Harvard stuffed shirts is wonderful.  Elle manages to get assigned as an assistant on a murder case (another incredible stretch of plausibility) and is able to use all the knowledge she has gained from Cosmo.  There are a couple of subplots, like Elle helping her maincurist friend find confidence and the usual sexual discrimination thing, but they are incidental to being able to watch Elle interact with all these Harvard bluebloods.  And the movie has something to say about accepting people for who they are and not prejudging them.
The key, of course to the success of this movie is Reese Witherspoon.  She is a pure delight to watch.  She always has something out of this world to say and in spits of incredible odds, doesn't get down.  She gets close, when she thinks that a professor who admired her for her brains is really only interested in her looks. However, one of her professors says to her ""If you let one stupid (jerk) ruin your life, you're not the girl I thought you were"".  That gives Elle the courage to go forward and she discovers that it was the right thing to do.
""Legally Blonde"" has been released in many cities to make up for movies that were delayed or dropped early.  In this dire times, it is the kind of movie that will make you laugh - and that is what we need.",1001808000,10,2487,4.603174603174603

When she arrives, she runs into her boyfriend and discovers that he's now dating Vivian (Selma Blair) who is very bitchy in the film. But in the end, Elle meets the right one & becomes a great attorney. She wins a case all because of a perm, lol. That was one of the funniest parts, but don't forget her cute dog who is dressed up halariously throughout the whole film. Elle & Vivian leave him behind & become best friends.

However, she finds that this is not sunny California; there are no sororities or luaus. No one cares about Prada, Fendi, or Dolce and Gabbana. She also finds that her ex-boyfriend has found someone else, someone more ""serious.""

I'm glad I did, because it was very funny. Reese Witherspoon was hilarious. She is a great actress. This is a role totally different than what she usually plays. The supporting cast were also funny, especially Jennifer Coolidge and the UPS guy. If you're in the mood for a laugh, go see ""Legally Blonde.""",997574400,,456,4.313953488372093

Reese Witherspoon was fantastic as the Elle, the popular sorority president who gets dumped by her boyfriend, Warren because he's going to Harvard Law and she's too 'blonde' for him.  So Elle gets into Harvard in an attempt to win him back! I was really glad that Reese finally got to star in a movie of her own, she really deserved it, she's a great actress!

But the in-theater previews I had seen made me believe there was more to this movie than that.  It turned out I was really glad I did see it.  It was funny and very sharp. Yes, at times it was almost too cutesy and/or dumb, but the key word here is almost.  The director never seemed to let things get too out of hand.  One of the reasons why I enjoyed this movie so much is I genuinely liked the character, Elle,played by Reese Witherspoon. She was funny and caring and shockingly smart!  And her dog!  I haven't enjoyed the appearance of a dog throughout a movie that much, since seeing ""As Good As It Gets"".  The courtroom scenes were terrific and, at times, hilarious.  I especially enjoyed it when a person stood up in the back row of the courtroom and snapped out a succinct opinion of the pool boy witness who was currently testifying! Those of you who've seen the movie will, I'm sure, remember the scene.  Even now, several days after I've seen the movie, I still laugh out loud when I recall that outburst.

1640515,5,B00005O5CM,"This is the one that's going to finally do it for Reese Witherspoon.  A slight variation on her darkly brilliant comedic turn in the satirical ELECTION, Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, a blonde bombshell concerned as much with her social calendar as her scholastic one.  When her boyfriend dumps her upon his entrance to Harvard Law--he wants a ""Jackie, not a Marilyn""--Elle is determined to win him back--so she applies and is accepted to Harvard(upon first witnessing her on campus, her ex remarks""YOU got into Harvard Law?!?"", to which Elle retorts, ""What, like it's hard?"").  Among the supporting players, Matthew Davis strikes a nice balance between weasel and nice guy, and Jennifer Coolidge is very funny as Elle's manicurist friend(and used to much better effect here than in the insipid AMERICAN PIE).  Also funny is Alana Ubach as one of Elle's old school chums(she delivers several funny one-liners, including a brief, but hilarious, dialogue with an Asian manicurist--spoken in the manicurist's native tongue, no less). As Davis' new fiancee, Selma Blair, that most nondescript of actresses, continues her seemingly endless string of playing one-dimensional, one-note characters(though she's not bad, she has yet to find a role that distinguishes her as anyone with some talent).  Witherspoon, of course, literally owns this movie, and hopefully this will serve notice to the uninformed of this actress' stunning comedic skills.",997056000,,1438,5.373333333333333

However I am at the top of my class in high school. Reese Witherspoon does a great job playing the super blonde people. The entire audience (Including me and 15 friends) was laughing almost nonstop. It was well written, well directed and most of all well acted. I must say that my favorite part was when she graduated at the top of her class, got a great boyfriend, and totally fried her old boyfriend who basically said she was stupid!

1640521,4,B00005O5CM,"Sure, I'm a guy. I was dragged to this movie by my girlfriend, kicking and screaming. Actually, I wasn't exactly ""kicking and screaming,"" since I have a major crush on the film's star, Reese Witherspoon, but I had no desire of seeing it in a summer filled with ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""A.I."" and ""Planet of the Apes.""
I was resoundingly surprised.
""Legally Blonde"" is one of the most refreshing films I have seen. It mixes the goofy, colorful hipness of ""Clueless"" with the legal satire of ""My Cousin Vinny"" and, I must say, the inspirational power of films such as ""Hoosiers"" and ""Rudy.""
Reese Witherspoon is a delight in her first ""real"" starring role. Sure, she's a household name, known for her roles in ""Fear"" and ""Pleasantville."" But this film belongs to her. She's in all but one or two scenes, and she carries the film with the aplomb of a major star. Everyone's always gushing about Julia Roberts--""Oh, Julia this, Julia that. Julia's so great."" No...Reese is where it's at.
I am often called a movie snob by my friends, always loving the high-brow, intellectual films. But I must say, this movie touched me. I loved it from frame one to the end. It is colorful, hilarious, and it rises above the typical ""teen movie"" banality.
I recommend this film to anyone. I only give it four stars because I hold the fifth star for movies like ""A.I."" and, well, films like ""The Godfather"" and ""Citizen Kane.""
I think that's a pretty high compliment for this film. I had a smile on my face for its entire running time. If you don't see it in the theater, you better race to Blockbuster the day it comes out on video and rent it.

If you want to have some fun and a lot of laughs, see Legally Blonde!  Reese Witherspoon is once again on the mark as a deceptively bright and motivated college student who doesn't know what she's not supposed to be able to do and then goes ahead and achieves even more.  All the while, she maintains her integrity and learns to stay true to herself - something we could all strive for.
It's not without its flaws however.  Most of the other characters seem stilted and appear to be reciting lines from a poorly written high school play.  I'm not sure why the writers and directors gave only the main character any depth or appearance of acting ability.
That aside, the story is cute ( and that's really the best word for it!) and I'm glad I chose it over Jurassic Park 3 last night!",996364800,,895,4.4

1640527,3,B00005O5CM,"Legally Blonde is fun if you don't mind taking your comedy with a lot of tongue in cheek. The story in Legally Blonde is preposterous but knows it but asks you to go along for the ride anyway. Reese Witherspoon makes the film work with her unsinkable upbeat spirit.  Often films like this win me over with the secondary friendship even more than the central story.  In this case Elle Woods (Reese) helps her painfully bashful trailer trash manicurist Paulette Belafonte (Jennifer Coolidge) find love with the brutally handsome UPS guy. Its little stuff like this that infuses some heart into the picture that leaves you with a little more affection for the story after you leave the theater.  I do classify Legally Blonde as a chick comedy that the dudes will enjoy but a few will probably secretly wish was about something else.  The three star rating of the film is more because as a guy, accessorizing and fixing my depression with a manicure and a new handbag isn't something I can relate to. But it does not reflect that I didn't have a good time. If possible I would give it three and a half stars.",996278400,,1104,4.5606060606060606
1640528,4,B00005O5CM,"Reece Witherspoon finds herself carrying a major release feature film for the first time, and rises to the challenge. Legally Blonde is a crisp and energetic comedy that refuses to be taken seriously, even during its most pivotal courtroom scenes. The subtle and smart screenplay, adapted from Amanda Brown's novel, nonetheless falls into mediocrity for long stretches, the plot is somewhat half-baked, and the characters are archetypal at best. Yet somehow, I was genuinely entertained.
Witherspoon triumphed as a troubled teen with a razor sharp edge in ""Freeway"" (1996) and as an annoying and ruthless over-achiever in ""Election"" (1999). In each of her roles, her intelligence and capability smolder under a Barbie-doll exterior. Her characters put us on edge. One moment we're haughtily amused, the next, hopelessly intimidated. It's the type of feeling we got watching Sharon Stone in her prime. Expect more of the same from Witherspoon in this upbeat vehicle.
As she pursues her ex (Matthew Davis II) to Harvard Law, men and women alike hastily underestimate Elle (Witherspoon)-a Sorority president and Fashion Merchandizing major from Beverly Hills. Each faces the consequences as Elle repeatedly tramples the mythology of the ineffectual Blonde, all the time remaining impeccably dressed and manicured.
Myself a graduate student at Harvard, I must admit I enjoyed Brown's jabs at the mentality of many Ivy Leaguers. But this film is mostly worth seeing for its down-to-earth common sense, for its unbelievable comedic situations (one character is outed by his knowledge of shoe designers), and of course, for Reece.",996019200,13,1623,5.393700787401575
1640529,4,B00005O5CM,"Reese Witherspoon proves herself a talented actress in what could be a sequel to Clueless.  The film is satirical and bubbly with stereotypes about West meeting East (Coasts, that is).  While the movie is a silly and enjoyable film for young adults, it does have more than just pretty people and slightly unrealistic situations.  The great messages the film manages to get across for young women are very important.
1. You shouldn't give up on something because other people tell you you can't do it.
2. What you think you want is not always what's best for you.
3. If you promise to keep a secret, you should keep it.
4. If you believe in yourself then anything is possible.
Aside from the ""feel-good"" messages, the film is just a lot of fun.  You'll find yourself laughing out loud no matter your age.  This is a movie you should be happy for your kids to see.  This is also a wonderful film for mothers to enjoy with their daughters.  There is no sex, no drugs, and no violence.

Inwardly she is quite independent and refuses to conform to the smug intellectualism of  the eastern elite. She reaches out  across class structure and sterotypes and helps people that others will not.
.... All of this wrapped is a lot of great humor that had the theater audience laughing loud and often.
Only negative are some really off-color lines about male genitals that did nothing for the plot or character development - just there to get the PG-13 rating for the teen audience.",995673600,,720,4.488549618320611

I've been watching her since her first film, ""Man In the Moon,"" a solid dramatic movie. She showed incredible talent in that film, that continued to show itself in every film of hers to date. This is Witherspoon acting on the entire other end of the spectrum, in very broad comedy, and she pulls it off. She plays Elle, a beauty queen, sorority president and blonde Bel Aire, CA, girl who everyone assumes is a dumb blonde.  However, she has a 4.00, albeit in fashion merchandising. When her boyfirend dumps her because she doesn't fit his image for his girlfriend while he's going to Harvard Law School, she applies to the same school and gets in with her 4.0 and high LSATs.  She shows up with all of her sorority sensibility and frou frou clothing and accessories and becomes the butt of all the intellectuals' (everyone elses') jokes.  How can she get her former boyfriend to see her as an equal at Harvard and will she want him when she does?  This is the jist of the movie and it stretches credibility greatly.  However, it is a great comic vehicle for Witherspoon and she milks it for all it is worth.  When we saw it, it was the #1 movie in the USA and I was so glad that all of her solid work over the years had finally paid off in an enormous hit for her.",995587200,18,1387,4.311538461538461

Reese's character Elle was the only one which was dynamic. There is a lack of characterization. Sometimes everyone is so stock and stereotypical. But it adds to the humour and the fun.

Sometimes it takes itself seriously and other times you're supposed to laugh at the characters.

1640550,4,B00005O5CM,"Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) is a perky, popular blonde who expects her boyfriend will propose to her the night the movie starts but instead he dumps her because he thinks she's not smart enough and he'll need a smart woman if he wants to run for political office by the time he's 30.  Elle loves him and figures the way to get him back is to prove to him that she's smart and to do that, she figures the perfect way would be to get into Harvard Law School where coincidentally her now ex-boyfriend is going.  She takes an exam and makes a video for Harvard to see.  Surprisingly, she ends up getting in.  She doesn't fit in there since her Harvard class-mates are more laid back with their clothing and attitude then Elle is.  Elle finds out that her ex-boyfriend has dumped her for a girl that he dated before her.  He even calls his new girl the pet name that he used for Elle right in front of Elle.  Still Elle is determined to win her man back.  To do that, she applies for and gets an internship with her professor's law firm.  Her ex-boyfriend and his current girlfriend are on the team too.  They help in a case of a woman accused of killing her husband.  The woman accused of murder is the person who used to teach Elle's exercise class.  Elle knows she's innocent but no one on the team thinks so.  Can Elle save her former exercise teacher and prove to her ex-boyfriend, her Harvard Law associates and herself that she's not a dumb blonde?  She had gotten straight As and was articulate.  If she had been doing poorly and was a bad speaker and then suddenly improved when she got into Harvard, it would have been less believable though a fashion major getting in Harvard Law is still a stretch.  It's a very cute movie.  It seemed like it could have even gotten a G rating.  It might have had a couple profanities but that was it.  No sex or violence.  The movie was much better than I thought it would be.  It was cleverly written in some parts and Reese Witherspoon gave a great performance in it.",995068800,23,2013,4.328877005347594
1640551,4,B00005O5CM,"Let me begin by saying I am not normally a fan of the ""Clueless"" type character, but this is far from what I expected going into this movie. Reese Witherspoon's character ""Elle"" is a sweet, funny, smart and completely likeable character and has you caring for her and rooting for her to win and prove everyone wrong. After being dumped by her boyfriend Warner because he thought she wasn't smart enough for a future lawyer or senator, she follows him to Harvard determined to win him back. While she struggles with fitting in, she slowly wins over several of her classmates, and proves she is no dumb blonde. This movie is fun, and well worth seeing. I was skeptical about this movie, but don't let the trailer and bad critic reviews turn you off of this bright and funny film.",995068800,61,777,4.557142857142857
1640552,4,B00005O5CM,"I'm glad I caught this movie today. ""Legally Blonde"" was very satisfying and gave me quite a few laughs. It plays kind of like a good 80's movie with its ""valley"" girls, ""flashy-pink"" tones and soundtrack. I hate giving storylines and plots away so just go see this one for yourself. I had a lot of fun watching it and I recommend it.",995068800,,334,4.317460317460317
1640553,3,B00005O5CM,"...is what Reese Witherspoon is capable of doing. Forget the far-fetched premise here: the story of an airheaded Valley Girl type gaining admission to Harvard in order to pursue a career in law with the initial reason being to win her boyfriend back is laughable. But the charm, charisma, and genuine honesty and believability that Reese Witherspoon conveys here and, for that matter, everything else I've seen her in makes this movie worth checking out.  I loved her in Freeway, Pleasantville, Cruel Intentions, and Election. She can be funny, serious, genuine, and warm, which is alot more than I can say for her counterparts who attempt and fail at the same style, namely Kirsten Dunst, and Melissa Joan Hart. If you like Reese Witherspoon, don't miss this. Otherwise, you may find the premise foolish.",994982400,,805,5.007462686567164
1640554,5,B00005O5CM,"Legally Blonde is a very lighthearted movie that will definitely make you laugh.  Reese Witherspoon is right on target with her depiction of Elle, the sorority queen who gets dumped by her Law-School-Bound boyfriend.  To prove to him that she is worthy of him, she gets herself enrolled in Harvard Law and hilarity ensues.  A great supporting role by Jennifer Coolidge as Elle's manicurist, who ""bends and snaps"" her way to a very funny role.  I definitely reccomend this movie.",994896000,9,478,4.9375

From the previews I thought it might be a little silly for me, but rather enjoyed it. I would recommend it to almost anyone, but teenage girls with their mothers would probably enjoy it the best. It had the audience clapping and laughing very loudly in many scenes. Well worth the time and money.",994550400,6,418,4.662162162162162

The whole theater was sold out, and everyone was laughing their heads off. There are a lot of one liners, and ill probably have to go again to hear the ones i missed when everyone was laughing. I have not had such a good time at a movie in a long while. Cant wait for this to come out sometime on DVD, I'll definately be buying it when it comes out to watch over and over.",994550400,4,506,3.9705882352941178
