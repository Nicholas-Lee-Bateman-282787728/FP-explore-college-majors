I never read Ernest Hemingways novel To Have and Have Not but I know he would never echo the plot of Casablanca. Hollywood almost always changes the book to simplify and condense the story for a movie. This creates an audience from those who already read the book, and omits characters and scenes that would lengthen the movie past the usual two-hour running time. Before the 1950s the educational system taught about the conflicts between the Haves and the Have Nots as an explanation for politics and wars. I wonder what was the reason for a character like Eddie in this movie?",1414972800,,2385,4.415909090909091
