1780428,4,B00006J9OU,"This performance of Cosi is one of the best available on any medium.  It has (almost) everything one wants in an opera DVD: an energetic young cast who sings and acts superbly, inventive staging and direction, elegant period instrument orchestra conducted by the intelligent Gardiner, and lastly, spacious surround sound.

Sadly, cameras capture little frontal close-up shots.  Granted Cosi is often considered an ensemble piece, and the visual is in widescreen format, this performance nevertheless leaves me feel like I am watching it from a corner seat in the back row, unable to make out characters' facial expressions.  Considering that all six singers are such gifted actors, I would want to see more of them.

Nevertheless, 4.5 stars for this first class performance.",1123286400,8,774,5.260162601626016
1780429,1,B00006J9OU,"LOL ! The actors/singers use modern fencing gears and the orchestra uses

the period instruments ! LOL ! And all those 19th centry British soldiers sing

in Italian... LOL ! Probably the dulliest performance of Cosi fan tutte.

And something is not right. Uninspiring act and performance.

As a special bonus of this DVD, it has some trailers of other opera's performance

by other singers. You will find their performance amzing - energetic, enthusiastic,

and artistic. Sadly, it is just a trailer of ""other"" performance DVDs.

You can't find any similarity in this DVD's main feature.",1117411200,6,587,5.052083333333333
1780430,2,B00006J9OU,"I was delighted to find an opera DVD in widescreen and with Surround Sound. Had modern DVD standards finally get to opera DVDs?

Alas, the video on this is very overcompressed, even for two disks. Visual artifacts make this barely watchable on a large HD screen with a progressive scan player. But, with both DTS and Dolby, it is a delight to listen to.",1100044800,12,353,4.515625
1780431,5,B00006J9OU,"The title, Cos' fan tutte, meaning ""All women are the same"", uttered by the men in the play, and the plot with two young women falling into the conspiracy of their fidelity being tested, are misogynistic to some extent, but the real gem is the music. It is a comedy in the face of ""tragedy"", where love, betrayal, happiness and cynicism are revealed by sublime music - extremely eloquent, plenty of beautiful ensembles.

John Eliot Gardiner's production for Th''tre du Ch'telet is brilliant in establishing a realistic, sunny Neapolitan atmosphere to match Mozart's heavenly music, which was brought out with such fineness by Gardiner. Whether a lush visual attraction is indispensable in fully embodying the music is perhaps a matter of taste. I've seen production that also worked out very well with much simpler sets and austere designs, where the focus on music was distinctive and the drama was revealed by wonderful singing and acting.

It's a great ensemble piece with each of the six characters sharing their big moments on stage, so a cast of six singers equally strong in singing and acting becomes essential, and for the lovers, their youthful appearance would be as important. The English Baroque Soloists mounted a good cast; everyone did an excellent job in singing and acting. Amanda Roocroft showed great range and agility in her singing as Fiordiligi. Rainer Trost's Ferrando was exquisitely and beautifully sung, demonstrating his graceful Mozartian style, although you'd expect more tension created in scenes like ""Fra gli amplessi in pochi istanti"", the fervent duet of Fiordiligi/Ferrando. Eirian James' Despina is simply wonderful. Her mezzo voice-type suited the character very well, and her singing was full of life, sometimes surprise - as she changed her voice for Despina-the-notary to a smooth baritone. In this production more emphases were made to the identical side of Fiordiligi and Dorabella, from the details like the exact same garments in Act I to the singers' timbre, the subtleties in their personalities were gradually differentiated by the nuances in their acting. As for their lovers, Ferrando and Guglielmo, I wish their Albanian disguise were given more Albanian touch in the style and more dramatically different from them as soldiers - something that would intensify the drama and the comedy as well.

The quality of the DVD, with clear sound and sharp image, has done full justice to this wonderful production. No doubt, it's a worthy collection for Mozart lovers or Cos' fans.",1076371200,29,2523,5.163814180929095
1780432,4,B00006J9OU,"Nos encontramos ante una gran version de la gran pera mozartiana. Jonh Eliot Gardiner dirige con pulso vivaz a unos English Barroque Solist maravillosos como siempre. En el reparto nos encontranmos voces frescas de cantantes jvenes, que adems de cantar bien se lo pasan bien en escena. Amanda Roocroft y Rosa Mannion realizan unas notables creaciones de Fiordiligi y Dorabella respectivamente, mientras que Rodney Gilfry est tambien notable como Guigliermo y Rainer Trost (lo mejor del reparto) sobresaliente como Ferrando. Claudio Niccolai (nico veterano del reparto) hace un gran Don Alfonso, y Erian James una Despina ms que correcta.
La produccin escnica es bellsima, tanto en escenografa como vestuario e iluminacin, y muy entretenida visualmente.
Francamente me parece que estamos ante la mejor opcin visual disponible para ""Cos fan tutte"", que adems ofrece un nivel musical altamente notable.",1062806400,12,899,5.521739130434782
1780433,4,B00006J9OU,"An enjoyable performance on DVD of Mozart's last opera in which he used Lorenzo da Ponte for the libretto.
This is a 2-disc DVD set that stars Amanda Roocroft (Fiordiligi), Rosa Mannion (Dorabella), Rodney Gilfry (Guglielmo), Rainer Trost (Ferrando), Eirian James (Despina) and Claudio Nicolai (Don Alfonso).

John Eliot Gardiner conducts this work that is performed before a live audience at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris.
The sets are simply magnificent with multiple curtains that depict beautifully painted backdrop scenes. The floor is entirely made up on plaques of inlaid stone to resemble an outdoor courtyard: a very realistic touch. The costumes are lovely and are appropriate for the era they represent. Also the cameral angles, switching and film editing are excellent and have resulted in a finished work that is of superior quality.
That main singers are young, vibrant and indeed sexy: someone you could really believe to be in love and they all have great voices. They are competent in their acting skills making good use of hand gestures and facial expressions.
And yet despite all the above positives things that I've mentioned above, I felt, for some difficult to explain reason, the first half of Act I dragged significantly (thus 1/2 star lost). I sensed the audience also had the same opinion, as their applause during this phase was rather subdued. However, this lack of energy changed quickly once Eirian James, as the maid, Despina, came on stage. She had an energetic stage presence that seemed to infect her fellow actors: While the other actors and actresses seem to enjoy their roles, she obviously loved hers and this shone through from beginning to end. From this point on, the entire cast seemed more at ease and appeared to be enjoying themselves on stage. The last part of Act 1 and the remainder of the work was lively, funny and a joy to watch and hear. Certainly the audience was much more responsive and their applause more sincere and prolonged.
Technically, the disc has subtitles in several languages, including English and Italian, BRAVO!. However on the negative side, there is no menu that allows you to go to a particular scene: you have to start at the beginning of an Act and continue to jump forward one scene at a time(another 1/2 star lost). This is annoying and difficult to understand with the advances in todays recording standards.
All in all a wonderful presentation: the negatives that I've mentioned above pale in comparison to the overall positives of this delightful work. A Cosi that I could honestly recommend to be added to anyone's opera collection.",1042243200,64,2615,4.970319634703197

Of course that problem goes away if I don't turn on subtitles next time I watch it (and can forget da Ponte's libretto).",1440374400,,279,4.957446808510638
7970282,5,B00006J9OU,"This production is beautiful and seamless, both directed and conducted by John Eliot Gardiner, superb period orchestra, very fine singing and acting, wonderful sets based on period paintings, which change subtly to reflect the plot development.  Claudio Nicolai is the best Don Alfonso I have ever heard or seen - the perfect balance of avuncular and cynical.  Although this production shows us the emotional turmoil of the characters, it doesn't get mean or sadistic, as some modern versions do - after all, in Mozart's words, this is a ""dramma giocoso"".  Excellent sound quality, good English sub-titles.  Attention to detail both musically and on stage makes this one of the best Cosi fan Tuttes out there!",1432944000,3,709,5.139130434782609

7970285,2,B00006J9OU,"This is a wonderfully sung and performed COSI FAN TUTTE. The problem is the video quality it terrible. On your HDTV it is like watching the opera from behind an annoying screen. The picture is blurry and anything but crisp. Details are lost, and the better your TV, the more annoying this is. My recommendation is to skip the dvd and get the cd of this performance.",1182902400,4,365,4.462686567164179
7970286,5,B00006J9OU,"There are several excellent productions of Cosi available on DVD. Because the opera can be interpreted in different ways (that's one of its joys), I don't think there's a ""best production"" out there. This one, though, is my personal favorite. It's conducted by John Eliot Gardiner who says of Cosi that no other Mozart opera has such an unmistakable sound, one he can only describe as ""feminine."" It's the opera I put on when I need to nourish the soul. The ""Addio"" quintet, followed by the ""Soave sia il vento"" trio is almost too much beauty to bear in so short a time. Heavenly Amadeus music, always with that tinge of indefinable sadness, just like life.

This production has lush sets and costumes, sparkling conducting (on period instruments) and first-rate performances by the six ensemble players. I love how it shifts gears in Act II. Up until then it's all hilarity and fun. Then it  stops you in your tracks as you realize Fiordiligi is truly in crisis. Amanda Roocroft communicates this both in her singing and her acting. You feel deeply for her.

As the sisters, Fiordiligi and Dorabella, Roocroft and Rosa Mannion's voices blend perfectly; this is essential because they sing together throughout the opera. Rainer Trost is a perfect Mozart tenor - sweet-voiced and expressive. His moving interpretation of Ferrando's two arias ""Un' aura amorosa"" and ""Tradito, schernito"" goes straight to your heart. Rodney Gilfry is wonderfully arrogant as Guglielmo and his rich baritone voice is a treat for the ear.

Finally, there are some great directorial choices - from the sisters fending off the ""foreigners"" with upended tables in the hilariously-staged ""Alla bella Despinetta,"" to the ensemble dropping out of character as they begin the final chorus (an inspired choice since the audience knows it's false cheerfulness at that point anyway).",1149552000,23,1851,5.059016393442623
7970287,5,B00006J9OU,"Loved every minute of this performance!  I will only add that the voices were all stellar - incredible range required for Mozart - and the blending of Manion's (Dorabella) and Roocroft's (Fiordiligi) sopranos skilled and delightful.  I was fascinated with Dorabella and Fiordiligi: difficult to distinguish in the beginning and gradually allowing their different natures to emerge along with differences in costuming.  This production, like all of Gardiner's, is excellent; anyone wanting scan and pan with lots of closeups is missing a genuine treat!",1144281600,9,551,5.535714285714286
7970288,5,B00006J9OU,"that this is the best overall COSI on the market. Cosi is very much ensemble and this dvd is filmed that way. Those who want alot of closeups and editing may find this disappointing. I liked the filming scheme of this dvd because it was written and composed specifically as an opera of relationships, and viewing the reactions of those characters not necessarily singing at the moment is important. The denouement of this version of the opera is peerless in dvd format. The quality and matching of voices is also unmatched on any other current dvds of this opera.  Trost & Roocroft are consistently excellent and the orchestra is dead on. I have viewed every COSI dvd offered online, and it is my sincere opinion that this version is the best overall. Try it!",1124150400,24,759,4.664179104477612
