4227995,2,B003Y9NXDK,"When Bruno gets dumped by his girlfriend for another guy, he plots to win her back by making her reject the newcomer.  His initial plan was to introduce him to another girl he might like better, but, when that doesn't work, he goes to ""Plan B"" (Argentina 2009).  After noticing the new guy was staring at him in the gym, he sets out to seduce him, thus making him less desirable for his girlfriend.  The seduction works too well, with consequences he had not anticipated.

I don't expect a film about a concept such as sexual confusion to be quick and precise, but this film drags on with glacier-like pacing throughout.  It has numerous extraneous scenes that don't seem to contribute anything to the film, and the dialogue meanders even further, in between long periods of silence with characters staring as if in a daze.  There are silent shots of street scenes and household items, unrelated to anything going on in the film. It's not ""art"" ... it's just boring. Though listed as only 103 minutes, the film seemed nearly twice as long.  The two male leads, who did the best with the lines they were given, don't seem to have any chemistry with each other, or with the actress who plays their former/current girlfriend.  I read an article in which one of the leads explained that relationships ""go slower"" in Argentina, and I don't buy it.  Two stars out of five.",1287619200,11,1366,4.6115702479338845
4227996,4,B003Y9NXDK,"Yo.....let me get something out of the way right up front. If you don't think the ending 4 minute scene makes your viewing time more than worth it, then I'll eat my ticket stub, AND tell you that you're not the gay romantic you'd like to think you are.

The Big Question addressed by this movie is....Will ""Plan B"" backfire?  And since we're given seemingly ""Dyed in the Wool"" Hetereos as our 2 leads, it's a valid one.  Just know, however, that this viewer has never seen a ""straight guys falling for each other"" story which felt and seemed more real than this (well, maybe in novels).  And what really stumps me is HOW they got such intangible feelings to come across on film!  That's a Biggie.  Now a WARNING:  Don't be mislead by viewers who say nothing ""seems"" to be happening in this movie.  The fact is, for most of us, it'll take time to sink in that IT has been happening right before our eyes all along; we just weren't ""recognizing"" it.  So when several of those long (in time taken) shots occur, showing one or another of our leads standing alone, staring off into space....or sitting by himself, gazing at nothing......BUT then this silly smile starts to appear on his face.....or you hear the guy start whispering funny or surprised little comments to himself......THEN is when you pick up on what all this is about.  You suddenly realize what these two are thinking and agonizing over:  ""What's the hell's happening to me?"".......""How come I'm feeling this way?"".......""No way this can be real!"".......""Well, what the F--- do I do now?!""

So, with all that out of the way, here's a little bit of what your having been patient will bring you:  There's a written confession of love.....there's a face to face admission of love.  There's some hurt.....there's some tears.  And, as already mentioned, you'll witness lots of feelings expressed in just a look.....or in the manner a character is standing or sitting during his alone time.  So, Viewers, don't rush this.  Your Director intended for you to be as patient as are his 2 characters (even if that does cause them confusion along the way).  But, in the end, you'll be happy to know:  We CAN see it.....Falling in Love.....oh, yes we can.

Not everything is perfect; there are things I think wrong with this film.  However, most of them have to do with a lack of resources to produce a top-grade production. This young and talented (cute, too) writer / director likely did the best he could with what he had. Foremost problem is a lack of inviting surroundings in which to shoot---especially an important waterfront ""getting to know one another"" scene---which takes place in an abandoned industrial area of crumbling cement, rusting metal and weed growth. Sadly, those surroundings undermine the relationship development such a scene is aiming for. Still, it does remind us that our 2 lead characters are not upscale, wealthy types (and their living quarters reflect that, as well).

Speaking of the leads (Manuel Vignau and Lucas Ferraro).....if you begin by thinking these 2 are mere eye candy, they'll have you right where they want you---squirming for ""IT"" to happen. What's ""IT"" you ask?  Duh, c'mon, be honest; you came into this thing thinking, ""Oooh, 2 straights falling for each other."" Sure ya did.  And along the way you may just start to notice that these guys play off each other wonderfully---which is no small thing if a film is to be memorable. (Even though a low budget Indie, the DVD Special Features interviews of both actors show them to be quite well-spoken and certainly well aware of what they needed to do to get the point of this story across to us).

PS--So, the Moral of this tale is that:  Yes, you can have a Backup Plan (""B"") in place for a first attempt that goes wrong.  BUT keep in mind that, if the situation involves love... jealousy...getting-back-at....and if it results in deviousness or hurtfulness toward another person, then you may find out the hard way that ""B"" can also stand for ""B""ackfire or ""B""oomerang.  Which is not to say, Dear Viewer, that LOVE can't be the end result.

(( I've revised this review and in doing so am adding this following comment about the film. I've come to find it strangely surprising that these 2 actors have REALLY grown on me, and that I want to watch and rewatch them. Sure, one's kind of an idiot at the beginning....until an ""earthquake"" hits him, and you begin to see him differently. And the other lead....well, Wow, the tears he is brought to suddenly become the tears you share. And sure, sometimes I fast-forward through scenes not mainly involving them, but that's only because I want them back. So, there you have it. ))

4227998,5,B003Y9NXDK,"I wasn't sure about watching Plan B due to its 4 Star rating and the number of negative comments. However, after watching Hawaii, which I really got into and loved, and reading the positive comments others who watched that movie had to say about Plan B, I decided to give it a look. I'm so glad I did even though it did not grab me a tightly as Hawaii. But it showed a side of straight men and gay sex that is seldom talked about, I think it is one of their greatest fears, but is more common that many suspect. I know from my personal experiences.

The thing I am confused about is Marco's use of ViewMaster in a prominent role in both movies. He showed the slide in Hawaii, but not in Plan B. I assume it had something to do with Peter Pan and Never Never Land.",1478217600,,763,4.086666666666667

It's about two bros who become friends because one of them is a total dick, and they discover that they might want to be more than friends, without either feeling the need to conform to gay stereotypes.

Also, I don't buy the whole ""I'm straight but  suddenly at 25 I'm in love with a guy"" thing.  So little plot. Not plausible.",1422489600,,362,4.492307692307692

I sort of enjoyed it, but found the long montage sequences to be annoying, even though I understood that they were conveying the passage of time in the story line. It is of fair/average production quality, and something is probably lost in translation. The premise is that two otherwise straight men fall in love with each other. What they do for a living is not made clear (again, maybe lost in translation), and peripheral characters and events are never really introduced or explained.",1420588800,,514,4.976744186046512

4228021,3,B003Y9NXDK,"Bruno wants his girlfriend back. In order to get her back, he comes up with a plan: seduce his ex-girlfriend's current boyfriend (Pablo). You see, Bruno has heard through the grapevine that Pablo has had sex with a guy. Bruno figures that if he can get Pablo to sleep with him then ... Well it's not quite clear how seducing Pablo will get Bruno his girlfriend back. Nevertheless, in Bruno's mind, somehow it will lead to their reuniting.

Plan B is the story of two heterosexual males who slowly form a deep bond and then struggle to decide what to do with it. Pablo senses it first and is emotional throughout. Bruno is fixated on his plan. But as time passes, he too begins to realize that his feelings for Pablo may be more genuine.

But what do two straight guys do when they realize that they like each other?

I enjoyed the movie for the two lead performances, particularly Pablo's confusion which bubbled authentically to the surface as he struggled with what he was feeling.

As for the plan, well let's just say that it's not the most well thought out plan of vengeance. But I guess a plan is better than no plan.",1411516800,5,1123,4.463414634146342
4228022,5,B003Y9NXDK,"It's difficult to describe my feelings toward this movie. It's unlike any I've seen before in its genre in its glacially slow pace, its lack of annoying background music, its many conversations and interactions among actors which are observed but totally silent, and the overall believability of its plot. As I began to settle in to its unique characteristics I found myself being drawn further and further into the lives portrayed. I cannot recommend it highly enough  I lack the vocabulary. After many watchings I feel even more positive toward it. ""Hawaii"" by the same director and also starring Manuel Vignau [who is difficult to recognize playing such a totally different character] I recommend with the same intensity. A famous jazz musician once said that the most important notes in his performances were the ones he *didn't* play. This movie has many important words that are not said, and are all the more dynamic in their absence.",1409270400,2,941,4.993630573248407

4228028,5,B003Y9NXDK,"I am a huge fan of ""Plan B"". To me it is simply one of the best (if not the best) cinematic portrayal of two straight men unexpectedly developing for one another attraction, affection, and commitment. The first time I saw it I was blown away, got the DVD, had friends watch it, saw it again and again. Marco Berger's style of direction was completely unknown to me; the slow progression and long shots all inducing a marvelous state of contemplation. Unbelievable and amazing. Manuel Vignau and Lucas Ferraro are both great actors and I recently found out, close friends. Besides ""Plan B"" they have worked together on Marco Berger's ""La Ultima Voluntad"" and prior to that in a film entitled ""Como Mariposas A La Luz"". Their on-line chemistry is incredible and makes the premise of ""Plan B"" actually believable.",1404864000,6,810,4.792857142857143
4228029,5,B003Y9NXDK,"Marco Berger has produced a truly masterful work. The premise is original and engaging. The pacing is more true to life than mainstream films. The cast all fit there parts believably.
Manuel Vignau's portrail of Bruno is sensitive and courageous. His body communicates even more effectively than the dialogue. Lucas Ferraro plays Pablo as conflicted and confused by his and Bruno's feelings.
The situation developes unexpectedly in a way foreign to anything viewers will have had experience with.
The conclusion satisfies the promise made be the complete film.
All in all this film tops my list of favorites. I can recommend this to any adult expecting them to have an extremely enjoyable time.",1404518400,5,694,5.150442477876106

4228034,5,B003Y9NXDK,"While Bruno's intentions may start off as cruel he is anything but, Manuel Vignau plays his character as a  charming schemer who's plans are promptly derailed when he falls in love with the man he is seducing. As most of the other reviews point out it is a slow moving film, but to me this is what made it stand out. What is left unsaid, the sweetness of their interactions captured in long drawn out shots, the expressions on Pablo's face as he slowly starts to recognize his desires, keeps the film cliche free and makes it a soulful, fulfilling love story.

Director Marco Berger presents a somewhat simple premise:  if Bruno can't get his girlfriend back by seducing her, he'll work on her new boyfriend.  But that's where the ""simple"" ends for Bruno.  He doesn't expect what happens next, but what does happen seems inevitable and exactly right.  The film is slow in places--long shots of scenery, but it actually gives you a minute to think about what is happening, to feel it a little bit.  The performances are excellent.  Both Manuel Vignau and Lucas Ferraro are sweet, seductive and make you sympathize and empathize with what they are feeling.

But the city is not that of famous landmarks and tango, but rather that of younger people living in ordinary apartments, having relationships, attending parties, and going to the gym. The plot is out of Shakespeare...one man conspires to get his girlfriend back by seducing her boyfriend and then unexpectedly falls in love with him. The characters keep each other in the dark and are taken by surprise by feelings they did not know they had. The dialogue between the actors is sparse but natural.  There are silences in the movie where characters are thinking over what has happened in the previous scene. Between scenes the director films city buildings and landscapes. You can hearing the noise of city in the background. I don't recall any musical score, if there was one. Although it is love story there are no overtly sexualized scenes. The protagonists seem to progress toward intimacy throughout which becomes in the end, very sexy. I'm not sure what the director wanted to achieve when he made this film but on a small scale as a romantic comedy, it is interesting and entertaining.",1395014400,2,1199,4.820388349514563

4228072,5,B003Y9NXDK,"If one takes into account human beings rarely act with single minded sense of purpose, but rather our motives are highly complex and come from places from which we are not entirely conscious, you will be captivated by this film.  The character of Bruno has a mean spirited plan to humiliate and embarrass his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend Pablo.  When Pablo does not take the bait, Bruno's appreciation and affection grows as he delights in the time they spend together.

This is a very non-American film.  You are not whacked upside the head with each step of plot development.  The actors are extraordinarily compelling.  The long shots of them trying to come to terms with their complex feelings are so different from the frenetic use of quick cuts in American films that at first, you might wonder what is going on.  Then you will come to understand the director is actually interested in character development.  What is it that we actually fall in love with in someone?  He is giving us the rare luxury of watching two men come to terms with something difficult and growing in understanding of who they are.

Also, and most importantly, I was rapt by our lead characters' self-discovery that even though they love and had loved women, they could and did ""fall in love"" with each other, not necessarily gay, but not straight either. Yet, in the end, does it matter? When two individuals find each other--FINALLY--it can't matter.

4228078,5,B003Y9NXDK,"With all the hoopla surrounding the Mexican director stars, you should perhaps check out a really talented Argentinean director who is, we hope, headed in their direction of fortune and fame.  Marco Berger's work with actors is phenomenal - the performances in this film are so complex and honest it takes your breath away.  He's a master at sexual tension (he even titles his last set of short films that) --the silent spaces where people don't understand or can't define the feelings they have (but know they have them).  Also his subject matter, or themes as you might have it are controversial in both a gay and straight context. He's interested in the gray area, where gay desires are often unlocked in straight men - which lead to mental torture because they conflict with all the values these men have taken for granted. So here we have a gay film about straight guys. How realistic can that be? Well, as it turns out, very. It's also a love story that shows how difficult it is to recognize what you feel, and the marvelous vibes that can naturally exist between two kindred souls --in other words, the real thing. Seldom do we see films that exhibit such affection and tenderness for their characters--oh yes, you can hear the nay-sayers--From straights: "" Talk about gay fantasy. Oh brother""  From gays: "" Where's the nudity and sex?"".  But for those of you who want to enjoy a real love story, you won't object, you'll be thrilled.  Berger has a more somber version of the same themes in his prize winning, Absent. And his last has been a series of short films, which excel in fine performances and well...sexual tension.

4228090,2,B003Y9NXDK,"I was actually a bit surprised to see the number of 4 and 5 star ratings for this film.  It's not a bad film at all, just remarkably slow.  I really found myself unable to connect with any of the characters, particularly the main two.  Acting was good, but I kept waiting for something to happen - a conversation, an argument, anything. When it did, we were two-thirds of the way through the film, and my interest had long since faded.

The film techniques used, while artistic, made an already slow film even slower.  At times, the directors would cast the audience to watch a scene with nothing happening.  I understand this was designed to move or inspire thought maybe, but without any connection to the characters or plot, it just made the agony longer.

4228093,5,B003Y9NXDK,"I love this movie. I had to watch it several times to really understand the subtle nuances of the plot and the characters. The actors are phenomenal. Lucas Ferraro is particularly touching in his role as Pablo. The subtitles miss the depth of the conversation, however, so if one doesn't speak fluent Spanish, I think there is some important context that's not being imparted. Every once in a while, the translation is just flat out wrong, or missing half of what was said. Warning: past this point, there will be spoilers.

One of the things it took many viewings to really understand is the heart & soul of Pablo. When I watch Lucas Ferraro take Pablo through the process of understanding the betrayal of Bruno, I am amazed by his ability to reach inside and make you feel his pain. The one tear sliding down his cheek, which he wipes away furiously as though he were trying to wipe away what he felt for Bruno, gets me every time. Later, he doesn't break up with Laura because he's vindictive; he does it for Bruno because Pablo doesn't yet understand that Bruno is really in love with him. Post-break up with Laura, Pablo tries to sleep with Bruno. Or so I originally thought. But that's not what he's doing. He's letting Bruno go so that Bruno can go back to the now-free Laura and be happy. When you watch the movie after you understand the selflessness of Pablo, it adds a layer to his interactions with Bruno earlier in the movie. Pablo is a genuine person. And even after understanding that Bruno was not being genuine with him, Pablo can only be himself and let him go without hurting him.

Bruno's evolution comes in fits and starts, whereas Pablo's acceptance of how he feels about Bruno is more consistent. Early in the movie, Bruno is forced and focused on the seduction of Pablo as part of his game. Around the time the 2 meet Ana, Bruno has moved past the game and genuinely starts to care about Pablo. When Bruno has moments of self-reflection where he knows he's feeling something different, he looks uncomfortable and shakes it off. He struggles while Pablo accepts.

I thought Manuel Vignau's portrayal of a heterosexual man who had never desired - or thought about desiring - another man was very well acted. As part of his original game, he focused only on sex. As viewers, we get to watch him forget his game and really come to like, and then love, Pablo for who he is. When he says ""No puedo explicar lo que me est pasando"" (I cannot explain what is happening to me), he really can't. And that's the basis for moving forward with new possibilities.

The last 2 minutes of the film are powerful. Bruno reveals that he's in love with Pablo. He says ""Estoy completamente enfermo"". The subtitle says ""I'm completely insane""... but that's not really what that line is trying to impart... Bruno is telling Pablo that he's love sick; the implication is that Bruno can't eat, can't sleep - he's literally sick from the emotions he's feeling. This last scene is perfectly acted by both principles, in my humble opinion. Lucas Ferraro does an incredible job of reacting to Bruno's confession of love. You can see the exact moment on his face when he decides to forgive Bruno for his treachery and pursue the love he feels for him.

The only thing I would have liked to have seen done differently in this film is the very ending of it. I love when Pablo pushes Bruno into his room so they can be together. I would have loved the last shot to have been the 2 of them in bed, after being together, spooning and holding hands like Ana and her boyfriend had done in the scene where all 4 people were sleeping. This movie wasn't about the sex - it was about the love - and I think having the closeness & the love in the last scene would have been stupendous. Regardless, I can at least imagine this in my head whenever I watch this film!

I recommend this film with my heart. My head can find some things I'd change, but my heart tells me it's perfect every time I watch it. Whatever you do, don't miss it!",1350691200,17,4014,4.476775956284153

I did not expect to be as moved and captivated by this movie as I was. Many others have discussed the powerful silences in this movie and I have to agree that, those, in addition to the actors' incredible skills of conveying a variety of emotions without saying a word, made this movie dynamic. It was very believable and not rushed. It was refreshing to see the uncertainty, angst and anguish over what was inevitably happening to them played out at length and not cheapened by the directors desire to bed them early on or rush them to a predictable happy ending.

I highly respect directors and actors who are courageous enough to involve themselves with projects like this and exposing themselves to ridicule. Thank you for this movie. It was pure and an absolute joy to watch.",1336089600,7,947,4.664670658682635

4228106,5,B003Y9NXDK,"The dialogue is in the eyes. If you can read that, the quietness of this film is filled with ten volumes of speach. A 'must see' for the aware!",1314144000,7,143,3.9655172413793105
4228107,4,B003Y9NXDK,"Plan B is a witty, moving comedy-drama about Bruno (Manuel Vignau) who tries to sabotage his ex-girlfriend's new romance by convincing her that her current love-interest, Pablo (Lucas Ferraro) is gay.  The plan, of course backfires when Pablo discovers what Bruno is up to and Bruno discovers he is falling in love.

The actors are great, and there is a nice chemistry between Vignau and Ferraro.

Being a foreign movie the film moves at a leisurely pace, but that's okay with me.  One drawback is that there is very little dialogue.  Many of the scenes are played in near silence which is effective up to a point.  Vignau and Ferraro do a very good job communicating their feelings through facial expressions and body language.  The problem is that the lack of dialogue leads to a lot of confusion, at least for me.  I couldn't even figure out who the girlfriend was until the film was almost over (I thought she was the neighbor).  I guess I wasn't paying enough attention.  A little more development for the supporting characters would have been helpful.

Otherwise it was a terrific film.",1312848000,,1092,4.75531914893617
4228108,3,B003Y9NXDK,"I agree with other reviews that said this film moved at glacial speed; however, that did not bother me. What did bother me was the real lack of a cohesive plot. The chemistry between Bruno and Pablo was wonderful and should have been played up. The lack of dialogue (except for the awesome ""toys"" scene) dragged down the movie. I felt it was like watching a bad version of extreme gay chicken at a frat party until the end. Plus I wanted more backstory on Pablo and Bruno. Where did they work? What was their family situation? All I got from the film was that Bruno was an unemployed actor. (Prior to that I thought both men were impoverished students). Also, the ending? A total let-down. All that build up and na-da.

Overall, there were parts I liked, but those parts were outweighed by the negatives.",1310774400,2,804,4.506849315068493
4228109,5,B003Y9NXDK,I ordered this when I ordered a copy of A Beautiful Life--description seemed promising--a very unexpected surprise.  Subtitles not even an issue---it's a movie that actually allows the drama of the moment to play out--and to give you the opportunity to pick up on all the visual cues of the actors as they realistically portray the questioning of relationships and sexuality.  I thought the setting in Argentina really added to the depth of the film--and I have rewatched the film already .  The way the director allows the scenes to play out in long shots adds to the captivating mood.  If you are looking for an intelligent film that is enjoyable--definitely get this one--plus the two leads are  are as handsome as they are talented.,1310428800,8,736,4.856
4228110,3,B003Y9NXDK,"I have to admit that I liked the story, but this film certainly isn't going to win any awards for editing. It moves so slowly that you could probably watch a baseball game on another channel at the same time and not miss anything in either the game or the movie. (OK, it's true. I don't like to watch baseball either.)

Apparently, the film maker only had a single camera and a single lens to use. Some of the scenes made me feel claustrophobic because they were shot up close in tight quarters. Most of the scenes take place in one of three tiny apartments and sometimes the camera doesn't move the entire scene.

The acting is mediocre. I think that it takes some skill to pull of scenes where there isn't much dialogue. The long pauses mostly felt empty, even when many of them ought to have been filled with tension. I kept waiting for the characters to develop some chemistry, which they never quite achieved.

Still, I don't regret renting this film -- it has its charms -- but it takes a lot of patience to watch and there isn't much of a payoff.",1308960000,2,1053,4.362244897959184

The xters were gr8 and so was the storyline. I know some people might call it typical but I think or believe that it is more than that. It is more than that because there are plenty of men/women who feel trapped and will or will not get the help they need to be free to love or even be attracted to who they truly deely love/like.

I recommend this movie and similar ones(Undertow, Eyes Wide Open, just to name a few)to any one interested in such. GR8 stuff",1308614400,3,609,3.9918032786885247
4228112,4,B003Y9NXDK,"""Plan B"" is a film that manages to succeed despite being built on a premise that seems silly and unlikely. Bruno is jealous of his ex-girlfriend's new relationship (despite that they still see each other for recreational sex). In order to win her back, he plans to befriend her new boyfriend, Pablo, and find a way to destroy their relationship. Instead, the two men end up quickly developing a close friendship and then, to the complete surprise of both, fall in love.

Much credit should go to the director, writer, and two lead actors of the film, because somehow the film manages to make the progression of the relationship between the two young men seem believable and natural. Despite Bruno's initial malicious intentions toward befriending Pablo, when the two start spending time together, their relationship has an innocent, almost childlike, quality to it. The two share the unguarded, intimate closeness that many same-sex close friendships in childhood and youth do. The two talk about their favorite childhood toys, have sleepovers, take photos of one another, and just hang out together in the unhurried way that young people do.

Unlike most gay themed American films, the film doesn't feel the need to include gratuitous nudity or simulated sex scenes. Instead, the film depicts the characters finding emotional intimacy, which leads to a slow, hesitant exploration of romantic feelings. When the two finally decide to consummate their relationship, the characters close the door behind them ... and the film is all the better for it.",1308614400,13,1549,5.118577075098814
4228113,5,B003Y9NXDK,"This film reveals itself like a slow strip-tease, emphasis on slow.  I can see how many viewers wouldn't like it.  American films never move this slowly anymore, and many American viewers in particular might lose patience with this one.  But if you don't mind a bit of patience watching your films--if you can still enjoy ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" for example--this is really a wonderful, subtle film.  I watched it knowing nothing about it, having read no reviews, and perhaps that is the key.  With no expectations, the film does what it does and does it splendidly.  If you've read a lot of positive reviews and are expecting something profound or mind-bending or funny or whatever it is you like in a film, you may be disappointed.  This one is nice just because it is nice.  It even reminded me of the brilliant ""Brokeback Mountain"" in some ways since our two main characters' sexuality is revealed in nuanced stages... slowly.  Very slowly.  Too, you think you know where it's going throughout the film, but you can never be quite sure, so the tension is there, and I'm not going to be the one to give away whether or not it turns out to be as predictable as you might think while watching it.  Something about the power of the film can be found in this statement:  I didn't find the actors very attractive when I first began to watch, but by the end of the film I thought both were incredibly hot.",1307923200,9,1403,4.523809523809524
4228114,3,B003Y9NXDK,"Honestly, I would not have bought this now having seen it. The film has it's moments but overall I think it's a very overrated film.  It has a cute story line, but it's very simple.  Simple story lines are fine, but they need the characters to stand out, but they we're only average.  I found the dialogue to be rather poor in most places, and completely lacking in others. Of course I don't know spanish, so maybe some meaning was lost in the subtitles, but that can't account for everything.  Sometimes you couldn't tell if a character looked awkward because of the situation or because the actor didn't know what to do for that scene.  Another major problem was the editing.  There was so much that could have been taken out of that film.  So many scenes of complete silence.  I think the film was somewhere around an hour and 40 minutes.  It could easily have been an hour.",1307491200,,877,4.465408805031447

The languid pace and lingering scenes actually put this viewer in a mood that parallels the character's. I found it intriguing. See it! A must see for film lovers. This well made movie takes an artistic yet grounded approach to the interesting topic. I wish the film could be upgraded to a higher resolution quality. Shots and scenery are quite good but could use some clarity and color management. (Super Small Gripe because I just want more!),1307404800,3,559,4.957446808510638

When it comes to LGBT movies, they are not always that good since odds are they do not have the most creative plot since funds are very limited. You can say that this movie does not have the most clever script ever, but the magic of this movie is not in the dialogue but rather in the facial expressions.

The actors do an excellent job at portraying emotions through their body language, and their facial expressions are no exception.  I'm a visual person, and to be able to see what the actors are feeling makes it a lot easier for me to connect with the characters.

That being said, if people are looking for a thrilling movie with edgy scenes and hot models, this is not it.  This is more about the emotional connections that develop between two people.  It's nice taking a change from mainstream movies that focus on nudity, profane language, and less than decent behavior.  This movie is a great movie to sit down on the couch and watch when you're in the mood for a great, feel good movie.",1306108800,6,1250,5.009661835748792

4228121,4,B003Y9NXDK,"Before purchasing this movie I had read the existing reviews by other purchasers and this sold me on buying the DVD.  I loved, loved this movie! A look at relationships from a different angle and the suprises in store for the 2 main stars was funny and touching to view.

It was a bit slow in parts but nothing that distracts from the overall story telling, some camera shots of nothing in particular was a bit of a mystery they could have cut these as I didn't feel they added to the flow of the movie but again minor distractions on what I thought was an interesting and enjoyable telling of a love story.

I thought the 2 main male actors were very good in their roles and portrayed their characters very well, a lot of emotion on their faces but with not a lot of words needed to express their feelings.  It was delightful, I've watched it a half dozen times since I purchased it, I enjoy an ending that is just so perfect.

I hoped for some extra's in the DVD such as deleted scene's but there was nothing extra which is a pity I would have enjoyed hearing from the actors and Director with a comentary on the story and ending.",1296432000,5,1132,4.271028037383178

4228124,5,B003Y9NXDK,"First, let me say...if you watch television and are used to three minute snippets of script, or you are a passive viewer who needs to be spoon fed every single nuance that is in a film...then this is not the film for you.  If, however, you like to dwell in what the characters are saying with their eyes, feel the energy passing between the two characters and get wrapped up in the subtext of thoughts which the actors protray...then see/buy this film.

Truly it is cinema in the European sense of the word.  Texture, depth and a spirit of humanity are elements that the director brings to play as the characters each find out who they are and what motivates them.  Coupled with a modern, nonchalant acceptance/ambivalence towards gay lifestyle in the film, the characters ultimately find themselves and realize their destinies.

It is about time that a gay themed film finally has characters who don't hate themselves or act like ninny's. Also, it is refreshing to see a film where there is a happy ending with no one killing themselves or walking off into the sunset stoically.  More so the pity that our American directors can't bring to the screen anything close to what their European and South American counterparts have been presenting lately.  It is not always about the money.

As Norma Desmond said...""We didn't need dialog. We had faces.""  Well they certainly have them in Argentina.",1289433600,75,1394,4.799163179916318
4228125,5,B003Y9NXDK,"Plan B is a captivating movie about feelings and the struggle to be honest, at least to yourself about them.  An amazingly complex matter we all go through many, many times in life. Skillfully directed and edited by the Argentinean first timer Marco Berger, the film is an emotional statement of sexual confusion, artistically created by a team of young dedicated and intelligent friends.  Two other amazing films comes to mind after watching this extraordinary work of art; Alexander Sokurov's Mother and Son and the young and talented Romanian Corneliu Porumboiu's Politist, Adjectiv.

This film is not for everyone, but bright heterosexual people will find it very honest and even valuable.  You just do not know what will they do next and will question why are these two nice straight guys get it on? Because sexuality is complex by nature and societies made it even more difficult for them to express what they are feeling and Marco Berger knows that.  It seems like the Kinsey Scale is hard at work in this film, where the numbers they belong is keep shifting, but as a spectator, never for a moment lost interest or joy in the beautifully composed scenes especially when they are at sleep or just standing and waiting for something to happen naturally.  Your finger might be on the fast-forward side of the remote control, but if you are a true film lover ""you will not! touch that button.""  The joy and artistry are coming from these long, beautiful and important takes and cuts.  The film takes its time to let those feelings and expressions do the work, so we the audience get into the characters and almost feel their pain or joy.

One has to be very ambitious and a fanatic Tarkovsky fan to be able to make this stunning expressionist film and Marco Berger, I suspect, is both.  I only recommend Plan B to hard-core film lovers and open-minded beautiful human beings, because the film will ask you to participate, will give you the space to be there with them and even examine your own feelings about this complex subject matters as sexuality, society and honesty.",1289001600,77,2076,4.757660167130919
4228126,5,B003Y9NXDK,"In a time of bullying and gay teen suicide, I think this movie has a particularly important message.

An open mind and the experimental spirit of a 12 year old boy is all you need to find your true self as an adult.  What an incredible world we would live in if grown men weren't afraid of what comes after a very close friendship.

Sure, Bruno starts down the road for all the wrong reasons--it's a plan to break up his former girlfriend from her new boyfriend.  Bruno decides to get close to the new boyfriend--Pablo.

What follows is the quick maturation of Bruno, who I believes decides early on he can't hate the new boyfriend and then finds a real friendship developing.  The long, drawn out, and slow sequences of silence are the times the mind of the characters needs to think and reflect and try to figure out what's going on.  Those uncomfortable moments of silence for viewers directly reflects the same torturous silence moments the characters endure.  Those are times of indecision...not knowing whether to retreat or move forward.

The times Pablo and Bruno shared a bed...when Bruno woke up first and took glances at Pablo...probably wanting to reach out and touch him but holding himself back.  Those are the times of heartbreaking indecision--to touch or not.

If men could just carry their 12 year old spirits throughout life.....",1288051200,60,1348,4.767241379310345
