218413,5,6300175197,"This is an exquisite video. Baryshnikov is in superb form, and there's ever so faint a touch of world-weariness around the edges of these pieces, informing even Baryshnikov's copious perfection, which makes for a beautiful, rich viewing experience. Push Comes To Shove, especially, is sweet and ironic, and hearing the audience chuckle now and again adds to the depth of artistic triumph that marks each piece on this dvd. Tharp's ideas crystallize with snap and magic, and Baryshnikov delivers exactly what every moment asks. His legendary nonchalant classicism changed the world, and surely the heart of every person who ever saw this man dance, and these Tharp pieces make his insouciance ineffaceable. Amanda McKerrow wows in the Glazunov 'Little Ballet', and Baryshnikov's partnering is lithe and understated, intimate,even. Wonderful stuff. One of the greatest things you can ever see is Baryshnikov's solo tour of 'One More For The Road', at the end of the Sinatra Suite. Tharp's luscious familiarity is all over it, beginning to end, but in 'One More For The Road', Baryshnikov reaches a fusion of idea and means that flat out overwhelms. It's vivifying in its greatness: inevitable becomes irresistable. Pretty neat. It's too bad ballet is a forgotten word in any culture, but inexcusable in a rich one. People don't know what they're missing. Get this dvd and reaffirm your faith.",1141171200,80,1390,5.182222222222222
218414,4,6300175197,"Absolutely loved the dance pieces, especially Push Comes to Shove - would've paid for just that. It's a dream to finally have my own copy to watch. Twyla Tharp continues to blow my mind (Misha always has!) Also loved to watch Baryshnikov's and Tharp's minds at work in the Sinatra piece.

The A is for Arabesque, etc...thing was extremely corny - but that's not why I bought the video!

I do agree with one of the other reviewers that I want to see all of the dancer all the time, though I think some camera work helps avoid a distant, 2D feeling when watching a taped dance performance.",1140393600,,587,4.425925925925926

218416,5,6300175197,"A beautiful job - I do not agree with the reviewer who felt the camerawork was disappointing. I found a good mix of stage shots and close-ups that help create an intimacy with the dancers. The three ballets are all wonderful, beautifully choreographed, and give Baryshnikov a chance to express the sensuality and emotion that classical ballet doesn't always allow him.  ""Push Comes To Shove"" is worth the price of admission, but all three are gems to enjoy again and again.  The film quality is of high quality, including good sound.

218471,5,6300175197,"It's Baryshnikov and Twyla Tharp; what more could you want? Baryshnikov may be past the time of his astonishing flying jumps he did for George Balanchine, but whatever he performs he does it better than anyone else. Twyla Tharp is, well, Twyla Tharp. Nobody has ever been able to fit her unique style of dance into any category. Fluid and contemporary --usually. Always new, she has influenced almost every dance company, both ballet and modern, over her long career. The dances shown here are a good mixture showing some of Tharp's many styles. The supporting dancers from American Ballet Company are flawless in technique and make a wonderful foil for Baryshnikov's famous stage presence. The production values are the highest as you would expect. If you think you don't like dance, this would be a good place to start.",1425254400,4,821,4.913669064748201

218518,5,6300175197,"At 65 yrs old and new to the world of ballet (but already have seen over 25 ballets through the courtesy of Amazon.com and my library) I am a ""dyed in the wool"" fan of Baryshnikov.  Is there anything he has danced badly?

Baryshnikov Dances Sinatra and More is a must for anyone's library collection.  I bought my DVD just a short time ago and received it last week.  I've already watched it about 10 times.  I love it!  Baryshnikov once again shines and makes the people who dance with him shine too.  The ABT dancers with him are great!

The ""Little Ballet"" is a serious type of ballet.  Beautifully choreographed by Tharp.  Dances Sinatra has 4 serious dances and one funny dance.  Every one should see the ""apache"" type dance.  It's wonderful and funny.  Misha chews that gum and tosses Elaine Kudo around like she's a limp mop.  She appears not to have a muscle in her body.  And last but not least ""Push Comes to Shove"".  Each time I watch this performance by Mikhail and the ABT dancers, I am literally awed by the way they make it look so easy, relaxed and fun.

If you're expecting a lot of Mikhail's twists and turns in this, you are going to be disappointed.  If I remember correctly from reading his biography, he wss just recovering from a severe injury the year he did this DVD.  Mainly this DVD shows Mikhail learning to dance a new way which was one of his passions.  If you are looking only for classic ballet, this DVD is not for you.  However if you are looking for Baryshnikov, this new way of dancing for him is really wonderful to watch.

218520,5,6300175197,"There is an old show biz adage which says that you should always leave the audience asking for more. As did I, so will you. Ask for more; after watching this 60 minute video of a 1984 PBS TV show with Baryshnikov and the American Ballet theater performing in a Twyla Tharp production directed by Tharp and Don Mischer. I spell out the credits because of the errors in the listing by Amazon.
As other reviewers have pointed out, there are three short ballets included in this neatly organized program. The last, Push Comes to Shove, seemed to me the most creative and joyful, but Baryshnikov doing Sinatra is certainly a nostalgic hit for those of us who remember Fred Astaire introducing the song with a classic song and  dance number in one of his films and Sinatra performing it later in essentially the same setting. The Little Ballet which leads the way for the others gives a full measure of pleasure to Glazounov's music.
Baryshnikov, 25 years ago, was a marvelous artist in  full command of his body, those who shared the stage with  him were truly partners enhancing the impact of every move he made while sparkling in their own moments in the spotlight. Twyla Tharp proves herself a worthy successor to the ABT tradition established by Balanchine and those he influenced, like Jerome Robbins.
While, I suppose, a very short DVD as time is measured in minutes, it is long on quality and enjoyment.",1248652800,9,1405,4.680161943319838

218522,5,6300175197,This is Twyla Tharp's choreography for songs by Sinatra danced by young MikhaIL Baryshnikov.  Watch it with a quality cognac in your hand,1218585600,,137,4.956521739130435
218523,4,6300175197,"Another marvelous look at Mikhail Baryshnikov.

This is a DVD produced by Twyla Tharp featuring a more relaxed performance by Baryshnikov. The program begins with an segmented introduction that continues on in between the three, featured dance routines. The female leads are partners Deidre Carberry in 'The Little Ballet', Elaine Kudo in 'The Sinatra Suite' and finally the corp de ballet of the American Ballet Theatre in 'Push Comes to Shove'.

This DVD features a Mikhail Baryshnikov that is somewhat older (but he really doesn't look or dance like it).  The lifts and glides, the incredible sense of timing with his partners are done with such ease and grace...no effort at all...surely anyone could do that, couldn't they? Well, no most of us couldn't; what we are witnessing is Baryshnikov's athleticism, skill and balance that have endured, if not gotten better, through the years.

A comment on a few likes and dislikes about this disc...

1.)'The Little Ballet' starts off with a waltz where Baryshnikov and his partner, Deidre Carberry, only touch with their forearms; this is amazingly beautiful and erotic. The music and dance that follows just flows with a nature pace and sensitivity. I makes me wonder if dancers of this quality don't fall in love with their partners while performing these exquisite routines (well, at least for a few minutes anyway).

2.)My favorite work on this disc in the tribute to Sinatra featuring Baryshnikov and sultry looking Elaine Kudo. Using Sinatra's songs, this elegant couple do waltzes, modern dance and even a 'gangster and moll' routine. Baryshnikov finishes the set with a slow sensitive solo to 'One for My Baby' (It's quarter to three). I'm sure Mr. Sinatra would have been  pleased to see his songs use as a setting for the dance skills of Mr. Baryshnikov.

3.)The third and final piece was 'Push Comes to Shove'. This work features Mikhail with the corp; it is an attempt to show some humor in dance, and while the choreography is excellent, they unfortunately decided to use a laugh track to simulate audience laughter. I assume, that because there was no 'live' audience, they felt the need to put some laughter in at the appropriate spots, however this somewhat diminished the effect of this routine because the laughter was so obviously artificial.

Conclusion:
Mikhail Baryshnikov doing what only he can do, along with some exquisitely talented and beautiful partners. To be able to dance with such ease, grace and skill almost seems unfair to the rest of us mere mortals.  4 1/2 Stars  (1/2 Star off for the canned laugh track)

218524,3,6300175197,"The problem I personally have with this presentation is artistic: the choreography seems to lack overall structure and form. Instead of building a dance from, say, simple to complex or simple-complex-simple, the choreographer throws in complexity at the beginning, then tends to alternate helter-skelter throughout.  The result is a lack of building toward a clear climax or clearly shaping the work for so long numbers.

There's nothing wrong with the dancers, though; they're all great. Perhaps I'm influenced by the great film dance sequences of Astaire, Kelly and O'Connor.  Their choreographers (often much added by the dancers themselves) knew how to structure a number.

As for Baryshnikov himself, he's one of a kind, utterly magnificent, as are the member sof the American Ballet Theater.
