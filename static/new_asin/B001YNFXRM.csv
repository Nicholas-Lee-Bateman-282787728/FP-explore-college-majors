8348094,4,B001YNFXRM,Excellent 70s Italian Mob vengeance film. More brutal and less romanticized than the American Mob films of the time. Some creative and fairly destructive car chases. Some unexpected turns. And Alain Delon playing cool with submerged passion as only Delon can.,1322092800,,259,5.341463414634147
