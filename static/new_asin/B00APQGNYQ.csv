5466199,3,B00APQGNYQ,"When I read about this being on PBS in Pittsburgh, I was disappointed that I no longer live in the area to view the video.  Waited for the DVD version and ordered.  I was expecting a more in depth documentary on the trail, not just one mans view and personal story with a small portion of all of the history.  I still enjoyed what was provided, but wish it was more than it was.",1364256000,,378,4.081081081081081

5466201,3,B00APQGNYQ,"Super unrealistic. Kinda boring. I liked it in that it reminded me of a crappy movie from the 80's and maybe it was refreshing that it wasn't as violent or gnarly as I thought it would be. I haven't see the ""Go on boy!"" bit for 25 years - but that was usually about a dog, so it was fairly insulting. Super dumb and silly. I'm pretty sure I just got duped.",1527292800,,356,3.9583333333333335
5466202,5,B00APQGNYQ,Good movie.  Very nice cinematography.  There should be more movies like this and not the bias garbage that comes out of Hollywood with hidden messages and a sickening agenda.,1526515200,,175,5.0
5466203,1,B00APQGNYQ,I feel like the fact that this movie ends with a bible quote tells you everything you need to know.,1526169600,,99,4.0
5466204,5,B00APQGNYQ,"Despite the negative reviews, this was still a very enjoyable movie to watch. My wife and I enjoyed the suspense and not knowing if shes going to survive or not. Great references to the Bible and faith. We highly recommend this wilderness movie.",1525651200,,245,4.72093023255814
5466205,4,B00APQGNYQ,Jasmin Jandreau was absolutely stunning! This was a beautifully done prosaic exploration of emotional and spiritual development through wilderness survival. The scenery is spectacular and the direction is great! The ending is disappointing for multiple reasons though it could have been easily improved.,1525564800,,303,6.069767441860465

5466208,4,B00APQGNYQ,Good movie despite some flaws.,1524873600,,30,5.2
5466209,1,B00APQGNYQ,"This could have been a stellar film, and we were fooled into thinking it would be by the multiple awards bands across the cover photo, but this is more of a made-for-tv Lifetime Sunday movie. The premise was excellent. A lone pioneer woman stranded on the rugged western landscape whilst heading west for a new life with her husband. However that is where any good aspect of the film ends. The lead actress is terribly cast, with her orthodontia smile and horrendous performance. As is the whitewashed native boy. Had this been a more realistic, well researched film, then the premise of the stranded woman who has lost all faith, being visited by an divine/angel figure to both help her survive and restore her faith, would have been excellent. Instead, the preposturously modern dialogue, combined with the complete absence of realsim or tension, made for decidedly ametuerish drivel. So many opportunities for tension and excellence were missed. Absurdities, like the fact that a dirt poor pioneer can play piano concertos, or that she is surviving wearing a cotton dress through winter, with zero attempt at creating head and hand coverings, warmth or shelter, all whilst continuing to drag along a cumbersome wooden box without change, rendered the film almost unwatchable. Had the survivalism been realistic, the dialogue intelligent and era specific, the casting top shelf and tension added, this could have been a five star, award-worthy movie. Highlighting aspects like the initial fear and disdain of the native child, born to those who murdered her people, slowly turning to acceptance after shared survival, could have been a good start; instead of muddling the two extremes with the silly dialogue, campfire scenes and the ridiculous, ""come on boy."" Or even at the end, showing no footprints after th boy disappearded, confirming he was a guiding divine apparition, instead of leaving the viewer to presume the heroine a monster for not trying to go after this lost child, or ANY realistic survivalism in the woods through changing seasons, and how that would dramatically alter ones appearance and belongings over several weeks of cold, starvation and continuous trekking. Anything. Anything at all well thought out and plausible, could have elevated this film from just a straight to dvd reigious project, to the award deserving endeavor it claims to be with that box cover. Instead, The Trail is trite and embarrassingly bad. Still watched it to the end, because the premise held such promise, but kept wondering every ten minutes or so, why we didn't just shut it off. Pass on this one.",1524700800,,2603,5.06993006993007

5466212,4,B00APQGNYQ,"This was a nice movie that had a positive message.  I agree with other reviews, that there were several parts of her journey that are not realistic, but I think you have to move past that to see the spiritual growth that she achieved.  I think point of the story was for her to grow as a person in faith, confidence, and strength- this the movie did portray well.  The movie was a good way to spend a quiet evening and did make you think about some of the difficulties that people did face back in the days of migrating west.",1524355200,,525,4.178217821782178
5466213,1,B00APQGNYQ,"Spoiler alert except theres nothing to spoil. Unless you're all about Jesus don't waste your time with this. I kept waiting for the chic to have like an epiphany that never came. Awful dialogue well I guess monologue to be accurate no character development no plot other than she's lost no action, illogical as hell She had nothing but a dress on and magically doesn't freeze... what a waste of my time their time and btw!!!there was more than one cut tree - apparently I'm the only one that noticed including the director who later made a cut tree central to the story!!!",1524268800,2,572,4.563106796116505

5466216,1,B00APQGNYQ,"Should have turned it off in the first 10 minutes of watching. Not interesting. Predictable. Also there is no way she should have survived.

5466220,1,B00APQGNYQ,"Unrealistic fairy tale about how ""God"" helps people in their times of crisis, without explaining why all the other people in the movie perished. Most of the other reviewers pointed out the facts that the lead wore a thin dress that stayed clean for weeks through freezing rain and snow, didn't freeze to death, get frostbite on her bare fingers or blisters on her feet, and had perfectly straight, snow-white teeth. Very silly.",1523836800,4,427,4.863013698630137
5466221,4,B00APQGNYQ,"If you're watching this movie with the intent of entertainment, then yes the movie is boring because there is no climax point and very predictable ending. But that was not the intent of this movie. It was about the times of life when you are struggling, at the verge of loosing all hope, and when you doubt His care for you, He still sees you though; even if you don't see that at the moment. You do come to realize it at the end, that He was there with you all along. In order to understand the message and intent of this movie, you would have to bypass all of the logistics and details. If you are focused on the logistics and comparing it to a Disney movie, then you totally missed the point. You totally viewed the movie through human eyes and not by faith nor though a biblical viewpoint.",1523836800,,793,4.258278145695364
5466222,1,B00APQGNYQ,It was boring. I've heard this storyline sooooo many times and absolutely nothing intense happens. The most exciting part is over in 10 seconds.,1523836800,2,144,5.041666666666667
5466223,2,B00APQGNYQ,Movie was boring.  Moved way too slowly. Hard to believe survival with her clothes and food that was in the wagon.,1523750400,2,114,4.428571428571429
5466224,1,B00APQGNYQ,"Very unrealistic.  Her dress stays way to clean, she's out in the snow for days and nights in only the dress, never shivers, no frostbite, crosses a river in this same weather, and still comes out looking clean.  Eats dry beans without stomach pains........come on.  And the dress, is hardly wrinkled, though it does show a jagged edge towards the end.  Don't bother, very slow and boring.",1523577600,3,389,4.7611940298507465
5466225,3,B00APQGNYQ,"When she steps out of the grave, she is clearly stand on a red yoga mat. But she has some acting ability that much is clear. Levi, not so much. I like how low budget it was, like they never once had to show a horse in her flashbacks in the wagon. You only heard them. Creative trick.",1523404800,,283,3.896551724137931
5466226,4,B00APQGNYQ,"While I liked the movie and the ending which shared a message, I was becoming annoyed with the unrealistic aspects of her journey. It's cold and snowing and she's in a dress with no socks-even when she added a pair of boots from the dead man. She had five opportunities (her dead husband's clothing, her own caravan, a dead man and then the dead group-all wrapped in hats and blankets and don't forget the blanket that she carried in that wooden suitcase that appeared as weightless as a first graders lunchbox) to add to her wardrobe yet she continued throughout the entire film in only the dress-through rain, cold nights and then snow. Somewhere along the way, the blankets from earlier in the film mysteriously disappeared. Even though she fell into an icy river (snow was along the banks) she went on as if it was summer. While she shoved on, she barely showed any signs of freezing. Housewife not used to the prairie or not, could anyone have this little common sense to be freezing and pass up any opportunity for protection? . I almost wanted to give it a one-star for stupidity on her part, but I actually liked the movie. Enjoy!.",1523404800,8,1139,4.588235294117647

5466231,4,B00APQGNYQ,"I thought this easy-to-watch movie was well-acted. Having to survive in the wilderness after her tragic loss, she has to endure and learn where God is in time of trouble.",1523232000,,170,4.7
5466232,4,B00APQGNYQ,"This story is not realistic, don't expect it to be or you will be frustrated. Jasmin Jandreau is the best thing in this film other than the scenery.",1523145600,,148,4.321428571428571
5466233,3,B00APQGNYQ,"After seeing this ""pioneer housewife"" blundering about in the woods, I realized that the movie was going to be rather unrealistic. Her actions were that of a modern day city raised millennial. Not that a pioneer woman would have had all the answers in her situation, but simple instinct would have made her make more resourceful decisions. Another rub is that she always refers to the child as ""hey boy"", and apparently never even tries to exchange names for the days (or weeks) they were together. I did enjoy the scenery, so I'll give it a star for that. A shining single point of truth in the movie is when she talks about being closer to God in the woods than she has ever been while sitting in a church. As someone who has spent an appreciable amount of time alone in the woods, I can attest to that. So another star. As others have noted, this is somewhat of a spiritual movie, but it doesn't come off as ""preachy"", although it did have me praying about halfway through the movie though (praying it would get better). I gave it a third star because it was somewhat entertaining, regardless of the inaccuracies and unbelievable events.",1523145600,2,1140,4.565853658536585
5466234,3,B00APQGNYQ,"As many others have said, do not watch this film for any kind of outdoor survival tips. It is inconceivable that a woman of this period would be so clueless. Spent a lot of time shaking my head in befuddlement at the anachronisms and ridiculous inconsistencies ( ""Why would you not take the socks? TAKE THE SOCKS!""), but the film worked for me in that I was made to care about Amelia's fate. I take a little bit of a darker view of the ending than most, apparently.  I did like the spiritual tone and message, over all.  I thought the young actors did a fine job. Not a film I'd watch again, but not a complete waste of time.",1523059200,,625,4.2

5466237,5,B00APQGNYQ,"I do agree that it startrd out slow. But I am so glad I watched this film!
I found it powerful. Settlers encountered many obstacles, and it does speak to what women faced for generations. Following men. It made me think of how I would react in that situation.
I think this is a story of resilience. A story of survival.",1522800000,,319,4.245901639344262
5466238,4,B00APQGNYQ,"It starts off slow at first, but then it pulls you in. Not the most realistic with some parts. However, it has absolutely beautiful footage and overall had a nice message.",1522713600,,171,4.548387096774194
5466239,1,B00APQGNYQ,I wanted to like this movie so much. The story is great. However the movie is very unrealistic. I think the directors should have watched a few episodes of Little House in the Prairie as well as Naked and afraid. Cooking up some leaves in a pot of water is not enough to live off of. If this story is about survival then make it a little more realistic. Get her damn dress dirty! And the little Indian boys outfit looks like it was bought at Party City during Halloween!!!! And the dead guys boots... were those Justin Boots?,1522713600,7,525,4.313131313131313
5466240,2,B00APQGNYQ,Two stars for the scenery (which is actually worth a lot more but everything else about the movie took so much away) but that same beauty would have killed her dead. Not even remotely believable to anyone with wilderness experience.,1522627200,,232,4.825

5466245,2,B00APQGNYQ,The idea was good but it was completely unrealistic in terms of what she went through. She never would have survived and the movie had no realism at all. It was heavy in terms of religious aspects throughout the movie.,1517184000,,218,4.475
5466246,1,B00APQGNYQ,"Unrealistic survival story. A Jesus Flick pretending to be a movie, complete with Bible Verse at the end.

5466253,2,B00APQGNYQ,"Having lived in the mountains in a cabin, it's clear to me there are many aspects of this movie that are uninformed. There is no way she could have survived dressed as she was in the high mountains for as long as she did. If you are willing to suspend disbelief and believe that she did (and the movie eventually makes it clear in the end that suspension of disbelief is a requirement) then maybe this Christian-themed film is for you. Had the director gone to more trouble to give this film some kind semblance of authenticity, I might have enjoyed it more. There were so many aspects that were just wrong. For instance, you don't just go trekking through deep snow without tiring yourself out quickly. I spent too much of the film thinking to myself, ""that move was sure stupid on her part."" She wasted so much time on goofy stuff when her focus would have been on ensuring her survival.

If you are looking for a film about an incredibly resourceful woman who surprises you at every turn with her incredible abilities to come up with amazing solutions to her problem, this is not your film.

5466258,4,B00APQGNYQ,"Moves slowly at first. Once you establish who the people were it helped give the story more meaning. Very sad but true story for so many young women of that era. Going West with a dreamer husband who did not prepare for the trip properly. The husband had no firearm to protect them from nature or unwanted humans. He left her alone with nothing but her faith in God and herself. The journey she made was hard but almost hard to believe since she stayed so clean through it all. Her dress hardly soiled.
The entrance of the little boy helped the story a lot and you were invested in seeing them reach a safe place. Something told me it was to good to be true that they were able to survive on no food or blankets in the snow. But The lord provides for his children. and what she needed was a purpose to go on other than herself. It was a good spiritual movie which gives you hope that God is always with us.",1507248000,5,906,4.153409090909091

Learns how to start a fire using a pair of glasses, then is shown once carrying the embers carefully to the next camp, but thereafter, a campfire inexplicably appears after dark numerous times. Acts like a small child constantly, instead of a young adult. Spends a lengthy scene ""feeling"" the sticks, rocks, and moss as if she had suddenly gotten her sight back, but no reason for it.

Unrealistic actions, for example, Amelia is lost in the woods. She comes across a covered wagon.  Rather than sleep in the wagon, which would have provide some shelter from the wind and snow, she pushes on.  She sleeps in the open, on the snow.  Whether she is sleeping on the snow or falling into a river, she never shows signs of hypothermia.

I think there was supposed to be a spiritual message somewhere in the film but the actress's poor acting skills failed to convey  that. Just having a bible in a few scenes with a couple of references to God does not cut it. Seriously, the mountain scenery was nice and that's all that I can positively say about this film.

Only one scene showed the back of her dress dirty and then clean in others after that point????

As far as being about religion, as some reviewers have stated, I didn't see it. Sure, she had a bible with her and she mentioned that she had almost lost her faith, but such references and sentiments would not be incongruous with the vast majority of people of this country at that time.

Some viewers of religious sentiment may conclude this is a great film because of the spiritual theme, but it takes a lot more to make a great film and a believable character than the filmmaker was capable of.

If the female character is walking through winter, snow, rain & other elements in ONE THIN DRESS, then you know it's not giving the viewer any sense of history, which is why I wanted to see it through. First of all, I didn't like the irrational, domineering husband who insists they have to leave to find gold. He's selfish and she is gullible and too trusting. Along the way, you hear Indians kill the husband who's walking beside the covered wagon. We don't see any Indians or action, small parts of the sound of the man being struck down are heard, no moans or alerts. The Indians leave without looking in the wagon? Not reality at all. It gets worse and even more unbelievable when the young housewife (she doesn't look like one) keeps walking and we don't witness her eating anything much except alluding to her eating cooked leaves and not enough to keep a cat alive. You have the Indian boy who follows her in her leisurely walk to a town not known. No reality in this film at all. I thought surely when she kept finding frozen people that she'd take some of their clothes; IF it were reality, she'd have taken the man's hat like she did his boots. We see her walking barefooted, bareheaded in snow and she didn't shiver that I could see. The Indian boy was dressed for the weather. She's invincible and needs no coat or shelter and sleeps on snow and ice. Right. It's a time consuming film about religion, as I have stated, and nothing more.

Cast initially in the setting of the Old West gold rush, I loved this down-to-earth, heart-adventure story of a young woman struggling to survive, married to a man whose selfish, get-rich-quick aspirations lead them both to the brink of total destruction and death. She is challenged to the very core of her faith in God as she faces certain death, and then escapes into prolonged a wilderness struggle for survival that brings her to edge of suicidal despair.

5466308,1,B00APQGNYQ,"I watched this movie with my boyfriend and he was so angry at the waste of time that was this movie. My first gripe with this movie is that I thought it was going to have some historical basis at the very least-considering that it's supposedly a historical drama. I am a history major after all, and American history prior to the twentieth century is my particular focus, so I was really interested to see a movie told from a woman's perspective. I watched this after seeing Ken Burns's wonderful documentary ""The West"" and was really hoping this would deliver a good story. About halfway through, after this girl has been spending a considerable amount of time in the Sierra Nevada wilderness during late fall and early winter, has not eaten, carries nothing to help her, and wears only a thin dress, I stopped having any faith (no pun intended) that this drivel was going to get any better and accepted that this was solely a propaganda piece for the religious left.

She does make some meager attempts to save herself (trying to make a fishing net, sparking flints, etc) but by the time she finds the dead pioneers and does not take their blankets, and SHE HERSELF still has not died or is even beginning to succumb to the effects of the elements or of starvation, despite the fact that she has had no food and is wearing even less clothing than they are, I wanted to throw my remote across the room. I was done by that point. Still, I wanted to find out what would happen in the end though. Maybe she would redeem herself by taking care of the boy upon reaching civilization, perhaps she would die (as would have been appropriate-not being cruel or callous, just stating simple fact) or maybe even she would be rescued. All of these would have been appropriate endings. But no. Instead I got a bible quote about how faith conquers all and a magical dissapearing child. Wow.

What annoyed me the most is that there are people out there who will take this rubbish as the truth, 100%. I was not able to completely suspend my disbelief just to be able to get through this movie only to be preached at by a bible quote at the end. That, in and of itself, infuriated me. Maybe it's because I'm a history major, I don't know. That there are folks who would believe that this actually could have happened is absolutely terrifying. I would point them to the example of the ill fated Donner Party, who made a series of catastrophic mistakes in the period that this is set in, and ask them to suspend their disbelief that this woman could have survived on nothing, in only a dress, when the Donners resorted to cannibalism to keep themselves alive. Seriously, don't play with history. Have a bit of respect for those who actually died horrific deaths to make this country what it is today.",1450742400,7,2782,4.517857142857143
5466309,4,B00APQGNYQ,"The Trail is a movie with a simple message.  The message of faith is poignant.  I liked the movie!  I kept thinking about it for the few days after I viewed it.  The lead actress is a little inadequate.  At the beginning of the movie, you start to ""take her apart"".  Saying things like ""she should do this, or she should know that, or how come she did that"".  I think it is because we have an impression of our pioneers being supreme resourceful beings.
By the middle of the movie, you start to think - ""it will be a miracle if she survives this journey"".
At the end of the movie, you think - ""I knew it all along.""
My favorite part of the movie was every scene the small boy was in.  I thought he was fascinating and captivating. I loved to watch his little face.

Why didn't she just get out her satellite phone and call for help?  She seemed to have a way to constantly launder her dress, as its hem got a bit grubby, but it was otherwise untorn and clean despite all her hardships.  Of those, dying of hypothermia in the mountain winter, wearing only in a thin cotton dress would have to be high on the list.  Thin already, she seemed to be able to survive for weeks without food - we never saw her eat.  The bizarre ""boy"" that disappeared at the end seemed to be able to exist (if he did...) on air, too.  The whole miserable exercise seemed to be an excuse for some idiotic religious drivel and a bible quote at the end.  It seemed to want to promote hope - but even hope needs to be based on some degree of reality.  Suspension of disbelief just isn't enough to get you through this drivel - though maybe belief does it for those who'll tolerate - or like - anything that includes references to their imaginary friend.  The DVD cover boasts many positive comments - mostly from the Attic Film Festival, which shows ""Films of Faith, Hope, and Redemption"".

The unfavorable reviews point out that she manages to survive in the wilderness during the winter without encountering wild animals and without proper clothing or nourishment. While I, too, noted these facts and felt perplexed by them, I came to think (as the story unfolded) that she was able to survive because she was being protected by a guardian spirit. (It is obvious at the end of the film she was indeed being protected but I don't want to be a spoiler by saying exactly why.) I thought the cinematography was gorgeous and although the film didn't have much dialogue and was mostly focused on her from moment to moment trying to survive (sort of like Castaway), I thought it was intelligently executed. If you are a person who thrives on glitzy, action-packed movies, this isn't really going to appeal to you, although on the other hand, it does have action in the sense that it makes you constantly wonder ""what is going to happen next? what danger is she going to encounter? will she survive?""

The on-screen portrayal of off-screen elements (e.g., the wagon attack, the lead-in to the introduction of the native boy) made the story-telling more evocative and kept me interested. The lead actress portrayed her character Amelia very well. I read a couple of reviews that expressed frustration with Amelia, but I think her situation and how she initially reacted to it was meant to evoke frustration. Feeling frustration means the lead actress did her job by pulling you into the story and what she was going through. If you don't feel something while you're watching it unfold, you're not getting it. Besides the look and feel of the movie, the music was absolutely stunning. I'm not familiar with the composer, but I really noticed -- and really liked -- the music from beginning to end. It complemented the story and helped move it forward rather than distracted from it.

I loved seeing Amelia's story unravel through peeks into her past, and her resilience was life-affirming.

5466335,1,B00APQGNYQ,"This is the worse produced, written, directed movie I've ever seen. Not sure how many days the hero roamed around the the Sierras, but her dress never got dirty, nor did her hands or face. Have you ever gone camping? And where were the bears, chipmunks, and oh my favorite coyotes. There were so many details that didn't add up, we (my family members who watched it) started pointing them out. This movie was riddled with RED herrings, untied details, just plain inconsistency factual or not. I wish I could point them out but I guess that would be a spoiler. I would NOT recommend this to anyone especially someone young. Read a book about the Oregon Trail or the Donner Party, go to the Rockies or Sierras and see for yourself, go on Google earth and check out the Tahoe Basin (I believe it was shot in the and around the Carson Valley.)

5466338,3,B00APQGNYQ,"It's an unsurvivable situation especially in a thin cotton dress.  I'm not sure what the point of this movie is other than to make us appreciate that todays are always better than yesterdays.

The film holds attention because the actress is earnest but more importantly emits an involuntary illicit signal not found in Princess of Nebraska despite her starker appearance.  It's going to invite interest.  I think it's in the upper eyelids.  She reminds me a little of Laura Smet.

Princess of Nebraska did not emit an alone in the world grateful for the taking signal.  Pretty soon, she was going to ball her hands into fists and start swinging.

The purpose of her companion is that it binds her to trudging through.

I didn't appreciate the bible quote that closed the film at all.  While you're taking too much comfort in that bible quote or petting your cats, your enemies will finish you off.

5466339,3,B00APQGNYQ,"Interesting... Although I figured out the story-line early-on it was interesting to watch this wilderness flick un-fold. The landscape panorama shots are beautiful. It reminds me of my own days scouting around the Rockies. One does wonder why the screenplay is set in the early California Gold Rush days (1849) and why not another time period (it could easily have been in the 20th century or even today). Except that the heroine overcomes all adversity (I hope we see more of Jandreau, she's quite good as a babe-in-the-woods) there's not much that defines this movie. And the final scene is a bit odd (was the Native American child a figment of her imagination all along?). Weird way to wrap things up.

8555797,3,B00APQGNYQ,"Not a great flick, too many ridiculous WTF? moments that went against history and reality. Yes, many pioneers did set off for a better life and ended up dead by Indians, the elements or their own dumb decisions. No, most wives didn't listen to their stupid husband's idiotic plan to take a wagon in the wee hours and flee the safety of the wagon train! Yes, Indians often killed settlers and took their usable goods. No, they'd never be dumb enough to only take what's outside the wagon and not check thoroughly inside the wagon, especially when there might be guns, ammo, food or a tasty blonde white woman they can gang rape, torture, mutilate and kill, or make a slave, inside. Speaking of guns, this moron actually saw the savages coming and didn't fire off a single shot? Was he even armed? When she fled, why not take more clothing for the cold? They had to have packed some, knowing where they were going. I won't comment on the Indian boy, I think you can all figure that one out. Interestingly, this film also gives us hints of the Donner Party type disaster and was actually filmed in the Lake Tahoe forests, not far from Truckee, where the Donner Party got stranded and spent a tragic winter. I get not wanting to make it formula flick and show excessive violence, just too many plot holes.",1530748800,,1301,4.516949152542373
8555798,4,B00APQGNYQ,"I read the reviews before and after I watched ""The Trail""; the reviews generally fell into two camps, polarized by the realism of the film and the aspect of the faith message presented in the film.  Either reviewers said it was an amazing film that transformed their lives or the film was utter rubbish that was outside the realm of what was believable and tried to force God onto the audience.

Neither of theses assessments are accurate, though the one star reviews are much more off based. Those giving this film a one star review seem to have a deep anti-God bias and are unnecessarily critical of the realism of this film.  It really is a good independent film. The message of faith is extremely subtle, bordering on not being there at all.  The main character reads her Bible a handful of times, she gives one small reflection on seeing God in her circumstances, and there is a Bible verse at the end of the film. That's it.  I was half expecting a cheesy Christian movie going into it, but faith plays such a subtle roll in the movie that I'm left to think that those giving ""The Trail"" one star have a deep seeding anti religious bias that cant see beyond the chip on their shoulder.

As far as the realism criticism, yes, there are some seemingly implausible situations. But I feel one needs to suspend reality when watching most movies.  I mean, really, do you you think a movie about a Marvel super hero is believable?  Or robots that transform into anthropomorphic machines?  Come on.  We all have to suspend reality on some level to watch any movie, and this is no different.  Get beyond the less than perfect depiction of survival in the wilderness and try to see what is happening in the movie and the marvelous performance given by Jandreau.

Jasmin Jandreau is phenomenal in ""The Trail"".  The entire movie is centered around her and she really carries the movie well.  The director found a jewel in Jandreau and the movie works simply based on her performance.  If you watch the movie for no other reason, watch it to see her performance.  It is worthy of the awards she received.

The cinematography was also well done, and the movie doesn't feel low budget.  The shoot location is gorgeous.  I'm guessing the director is a fan of ""Cast Away"" as there are quite a few shots that remind me that movie.  The music is also well scored and I was moved with emotion because the music plays to the emotions of the scene at hand.

I really liked this movie.  Yes it was a lower budget indie film, but Jandreau's performance is so fabulous, it doesn't feel low budget.  This feels like a real, pure movie.  It wasn't life transforming or mind blowing for me like some reviewers have said, but it is well worth watching and enjoying for what it is.  I normally don't write reviews unless I am strongly moved one way or the other, and this movie deserves accolades and a positive review.",1530662400,,2895,4.531791907514451

An extremely touching movie, expressing the feelings, fears and joys of the protagonist by means of excellent photography--the true privilege and role of a movie--images, no ""action,"" what a novelty! In a world where films lose more and more of their intrinsic qualities each decade, gradually becoming meaningless pap, ""products"" filled with noise, violence, barbarity--the fast food of our modern day ""culture""--this movie shines like a diamond among glass beads and baubles. This will fly high above the heads of uneducated, dull and insensitive watchers. However, it will resonate with any real, vibrant human being who has experienced life--with its equally fleeting joys and disappointments. Beyond the vagaries of its very young heroine, set against the background of the great migration West in search of gold and illusory gains, the movie speaks quietly of what counts most in our lives, it is full of hidden symbols and messages--a modern allegory for life. The religious overtones, insistent at first, are compensated by the authenticity of the young woman's spiritual awakening through suffering--she comes to realize that God is not to be found in any of the churches, nor does it ""speak"" through a series of books written by men--but that God is omnipresent in nature itself.

And toward the end of the film her lips were mostly fine (when it was colder and snowing). So obviously these chapped lips were not added to make the story more believable, she just didn't take care of them in real life. It was very distracting and made me nauseous.
But what destroyed the movie, was her terrible acting. Her emotions were completely unbelievable. The movie was centered around the character she played and focused on the emotions of being alone in a strange and dangerous place. The actor was so bad at displaying true emotions, I couldn't emotionally invest in the movie. So the movie just didn't get it's point across.
Meeks Cutoff is a much better movie about pioneers crossing through Oregon :)",1528675200,,877,4.701298701298701
