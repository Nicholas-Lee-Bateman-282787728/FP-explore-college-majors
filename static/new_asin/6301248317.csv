8324612,1,6301248317,"This used video tape was delivered to my sister in a broken condition, although it was advertised as in ""good condition"" when it was sold. The video never played and immediately jammed up my sister's video player. My sister had to call a repairman to get the videocassette out. The trouble and expense to have it repaired or even return to the seller for a refund was not worth my valuable time.(I ordered this from Europe and had it delivered as a gift to my sister in California.)  I told my sister to just ""consider it bad luck"" and offered to pay her for the repairman's services.",1386892800,,584,4.457943925233645
