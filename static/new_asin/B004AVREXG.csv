8421037,3,B004AVREXG,"The film has an interesting plot  in fact a story like this has never been attempted by an Indian film-maker before  but how one wishes the twists and turns in the story were captivating enough to keep you glued right till the climax. Loosely inspired from THE GURU, MUMBAI MATINEE has an engaging first half. The 'strange' problem the protagonist faces has been well depicted initially. His sequences with the Baba and also with the Bengali cop are very well treated and the mainstay of the enterprise. Although the pace drops at regular intervals, one actually doesn't mind the first half since the humour succeeds in bringing a smile on your face.",1302480000,,650,4.794642857142857
