8162387,5,6304456956,"Read today's Headlines and see current Conspiracy theorists validated in this exciting, non-stop action thriller which points to shadow governments, to 'Enemies Within', to Deadly plots and extremist rogue branches of our Secret Service that ally themselves with those who would destroy America...It is right on the mark. The performances by this stellar cast starting with George Segal in a truly dramatic, Kennedy-like portrayal and Elliott Gould as the Vice-Presidential candidate is disarming and compelling and he and Segal both face, as the thematic allusions to J.F.K. remind us, the real dangers inherent in running for the highest office of the most important world power, the U.S. Their acting is superlative as is Conrad Janis' charismatic portrayal of the powerful, implacable, Cheney-like Deus Ex Machina working behind the veil of a world consortium bent on destroying the Presidency. The beautiful Paige Turco gives the best performance she may ever give as the determined Journalist who faces not only the horror of discovering that her lover (Dirk Benedict who is both Dashing and Dangerous) may unwittingly be the pawn of an International Intrigue that endangers her, the Presidency and our Country, but finds herself alone, against all odds in a struggle for survival with her and our ideals at stake. The November Conspiracy is fraught with twists and turns and true 'sitting on the edge of your seat' suspense, originality, and non-stop action, which few if any will divine before the movie is over. Bring out the Popcorn as Conrad Janis  masterfully directs 'Conspiracy' with unrelenting suspense, and compassion for Turco's character's loss of innocence, and the audience's similar disillusionment. The other cast members give marvelously rich, subtle, humorous, or frightening performances alternatively, these include Broadway legend Virginia Capers as 'Mama' the Manager of the secret organization, Lois Nettleton in an incisive performance as ""Pigeon"" Dirk's partner, Richard Kline in a serio-comic role as Jenny's (Turco's) boss, Bo Hopkins as the casual but savvy Police Chief, and Maria Grimm, as Maria de La Luz Schultz, Turco's flamboyant and eccentric artist/friend, who coincidentally also is credited as the author of this exciting screenplay. As close to Three Days of the Condor and the Pelican Brief as any film to date. Kudos for this great Conspiracy 'Who Dun it'. Should be on D.V.D.",1103068800,7,2424,5.378947368421053
