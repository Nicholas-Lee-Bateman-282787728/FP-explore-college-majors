8281353,2,B001B1Q3EY,I thought this was the video of the story including the history of how the story came to be.  Not so.  Just a reading of the story.  Not great and somewhat boring.,1392249600,,163,4.03125
8281354,3,B001B1Q3EY,I misread the description and thought I was getting something else. My grandchildren watched it (ages 7 & 4) and got quite bored with it. It was interesting but a bit too much for them. Maybe when they are a few years older they will view it differently.,1358812800,,254,4.3125

8281356,5,B001B1Q3EY,"This is just for The Night Before Christmas.

Based on the short story/poem T'was The Night Before Christmas, the charming little tale was broadcast on network television in December of 1968-a year full of much tumult. Riots, war, assassinations and all that. Clarks animated piece really brings the warmth and a Christmas ""glow"" if you will right to your home. Simple yet thought provoking, it's about a little girl who gets pneumonia right at the holiday in the 19th century. Her dad rushes home from a business meeting to be at her bedside and reads to his girl the poem he just wrote, T'was The Night Before Christmas.

The animation is superb with lot's of detail in the drawing. And if the music and songs don't give you a lift, then, well watch it again.
It's just a tiny bit jazzy in it's composition and form with beautiful arrangements.

It is a short film that you'll want to cuddle in your lap, and maybe get a little misty as well...

They just don't make 'em like this anymore.",1323475200,10,991,4.550561797752809
