I wanted to see a military tattoo - pipes and drums, military bands and their performers, and of course highland dancing.  What this program turned out to be is an extravaganza of magnificent proportions to rival any circus/carnival.  The fireworks at the end ??- well, the best word I can come up with is ""overkill"".  Too much FLASH, FLASH, FLASH! and not enough substance.",1433721600,,449,4.779220779220779
