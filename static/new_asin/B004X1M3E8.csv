My only flaw is the first season, which I never saw when I was a kid back then, so Season 2 going forward, is the Mannix I know and enjoy.",1432857600,,249,3.7884615384615383
8445839,5,B004X1M3E8,Mannix is always getting beat up and usually gets run down by a car but the plots are interesting and Mannix is professional enough that the cops are not on his case.,1371945600,,166,4.21875

8445841,4,B004X1M3E8,"MANNIX is a first rate detective series that features solid acting and taut scripts. If you thrive on this particular genre, you won't be disappointed. My only complaint is volume 4 of the series had some 'freezing' problems, but perhaps this particular problem has been addressed by now.",1353283200,,288,5.020833333333333
8445842,5,B004X1M3E8,I have always loved this show!!  Thanks for carrying all of the first five seasons in one easy to order pack.  I also bought Seasons 6 and 7 to complete my collection.  I don't understand why stations don't rerun these shows more often.,1351641600,,236,4.441860465116279
8445843,5,B004X1M3E8,"IF YOU LIKED THE MANNIX SERIES, YOU WILL LOVE THIS COLLECTION. OUTSIDE OF A COUPLE OF SMALL ISSUES WITH THE RECORDINGS. THIS SET IS VERY ENJOYABLE.",1342224000,,147,4.6923076923076925
