8630034,5,B00H4WGGOQ,"To me, this is by far the best sitcom on television, Candian, American, or otherwise. Gerry Dee is a genuine actor and a great comedian, which there are few of these days, and each episode is hilarious. I recommend this show to my American friends constantly.",1472169600,2,259,4.6521739130434785
