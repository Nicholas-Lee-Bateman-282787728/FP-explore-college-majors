7936402,3,B00005B2ZM,"Typical of DVD multi-packs, LEGENDS OF KUNG FU offers a mix of quality. The best of this bunch features Bruce Li, while the worst offers archive footage of his namesake. Apparently, even the ghost of Bruce Lee can't save ""Fist of Fear..."" from the mediocrity bin.

Sonny Chiba is featured in three of these, including a war story set in 16th Century Japan. Jackie Chan takes the director's chair for ""36 Crazy Fists,"" a movie in which he's also listed as a ""possible extra (uncredited),"" yet Chan's name appears prominently on this product's front cover.

Visual clarity of BRENTWOOD box sets is average. Transfers have a multi-generational dimness to them. Certainly they are well worth the bargain price, however.

For twice the martial arts action,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KUNG-FU-20-MOVIE-PACK/dp/B0007Z0OAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KUNG FU 20 MOVIE PACK</a>&nbsp;is a real kick!

7936403,5,B00005B2ZM,"BCIeclipse is the name of the company that started this mega-set trend with these 10 movie packs. I own many of them and love them all(well OK a few set I didn't like,but for the most part they are good)and this one is one that I love. Now don't expect great transfers or anything like that, but for less that $20.00 for 10 movies what more could you want. Great fun to be had here is cheesy Kung-Fu movies are your thing.",1177545600,,422,4.158536585365853

If you don't have these already, this may be worth getting. If you own a few other collections, chances are you already have several of these titles.",1156032000,2,374,4.753846153846154
