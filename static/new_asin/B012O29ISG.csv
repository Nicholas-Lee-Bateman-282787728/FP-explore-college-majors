7356905,5,B012O29ISG,"At last the best complete series are finally available as this is the first time we get a complete series with english subts for all those fans who need them and until now they never had them.
 I for once know poor english but when i watch a movie with subtitles i can understand the whole movie a lot better than when i watch it with no subtitles.
 so for me this is the right deal.
 apart from subts this set has new extras like the 6 part doc Little house phenomenon and screen tests and it also include the pilot and the three post tv movies plus u get a great cover gift as u get all those dvd's inside a little house gift box set cover.

 so all in all this is the perfect box set for those who NEED SUBTITLES.
 If u don't need subts and u have previous releases then don't spend your money unless u are a completist and u wanna have all releases as this release also has an improved picture quality and it's restored.
 but for those who have previous releases but they need subts then i'm afraid u will buy this series one more time.

 I will sell my previous sets so to get this new one only cause it has subts.",1438646400,6,1119,4.05

7356912,1,B012O29ISG,"When I got this DVD series the box was damaged, not the box it was shipped in, the actually box set (so that tells you someone packaged it up damaged). I looked at the discs and they looked fine so I ignored it. Then when I went to watch them I discovered there is something wrong with the discs. They don't have any visible scratches or marks on them but there are certain parts in the discs that freeze and episodes that won't even play at all. I even tried these in a different DVD player and got the exact same results, so my only guess could be a manufacturing issue perhaps. Not for sure.",1530576000,,594,4.173913043478261

I am a big one for Special Features and this has plenty behind the scenes and talks with the Little House Stars. The color in this Remastered Edition is unbelievable and almost took my breath away. By far, this is one, if not ""the"" best purchase I've ever made on Amazon. If you are on the fence about buying this, jump off! You won't be sorry.

I expected it to be of a poor quality and to have many discs that would freeze up for the price. But my kids have watched probably 40 hours already (yes, in only a few weeks of owning it) and only one show stopped for a few seconds. I am so thrilled with this show! It teaches wonderful lessons and brings back the moral foundation that our country was built on. Super, fantastic, wonderful! Each show deals with everyday struggles and ends with families loving each other and trying to do what's right, with lots of humor mixed in, and a great script.

7356944,1,B012O29ISG,"I almost NEVER write a review, but I decided to this time, to help other Amazon shoppers and to show both Amazon and Lionsgate, that there IS a known issue with this new box set release.

As other reviewers have stated, in some cases (I don't know if it's in all the box sets - but it has happened to me TWICE now with two different box sets) - what happens is many of the DVD's are DEFECTIVE. There is no visible damage or scratches to them, but when one of the defective DVD's is inserted into the DVD player, it will play 1 or two episodes on the disc, and then the last 3 or so episodes will end up freezing after starting them - and the DVD player starts SKIPPING - and making strange noises - the DVD player will do this for several minutes and then:

A. It freezes indefinitely and you have to uplug your DVD player in order to even get the disc out.
B. the DVD turns off and the DVD player goes back to it's system menu.

It's extremely frustrating.

I've found that at least 1 DVD in each season is defective. I have some ideas as to ""why"" this is happening:

A. It's well known with other box set releases, that when the DVD Distributor/Manufacturer goes ""cheap"" and puts the DVDs in laminated paper sleeves/slots, this is well known to damage the discs because they rub up against the laminate surface and sit in hot warehouses - it just damages them. DVD's are supposed to be stored in center slots that hold them in place - NOT loose, rubbing up against lamination and paper.

B. It could ALSO be a coding issue and defect in how the discs were burned.

_______________________________________________________________________

In any case, Lionsgate needs to address this issue and re-release this set with proper packaging and/or replace customers DVD's. I will provide a video showing what the defective discs do at a later time when I am able.",1524096000,3,1859,4.479289940828402

7356950,1,B012O29ISG,"This DVD set broke our Blu-Ray DVD player, which did not make me happy.  The DVDs must be copied in China because the quality is extremely poor.  We only made it through the first two groupings and three of the DVDs didn't work RIGHT AT THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENT.  What the heck???  We returned the set and ordered a second set.  We returned the second set for the same reason and ordered a third.  We returned the third set for the same reason.

I don't recommend purchasing it due to the poor quality.

We love this series so we ordered a FOURTH set in hopes that we would get a set that wouldn't freeze and, worse, crash another Blue=Ray player.  Wrong.  The first disc worked; the 2nd one froze then crashed the second Blu-Ray player.  This is the poorest quality I think I've ever seen.  Shame on whoever created this ""Deluxe Remastered Edition"".

7356976,4,B012O29ISG,"First off, I'd give this 5 starts but I can't for one reason only, it's not on Blu-ray. Maybe at some point the folks over at NBC, heirs to Michael Landon or Ed Friendly, or even Melissa Gilbert herself gets involved and gives Little House on the Prairie the ""Cheers"" or ""Friends"" treatment, where they use film masters to put it on Blu-ray.

But outside of that one issue, this DVD set is great and deserves the 4 stars. if I could give it 4 and a 1/2 I would.

I had a few seasons of the original release (the Imavision ones).. horrible. I could not watch them. So I waited with anticipation for this DVD set to get all the completely restored episodes and not a bunch of badly edited syndicated versions.

And I was not disappointed. Even though these are not on Blu-ray, the quality of the audio and video of these episodes blows away the Imavision ones. So crisp, so clear. Unlike the other ones which had grainy, off color video OR where you had to turn your TV up or down because the music is too loud or you can't hear the dialogue.

No more of that. Just crystal clear, well color balanced video. And perfectly balanced audio. No need to turn the tv up or down anymore!

I am impressed for not being on bluray. Imagine if they were tho, it could be even better. But these are pretty good.

If you're hesitant, but love this show. Don't be. Its worth the buy. You won't be disappointed.",1519948800,,1394,4.301526717557252

This is a cute set, housed in a sturdy ""Little House"" shaped box with a sloped roof. The DVD set includes all kinds of special features. Other reviewers mentioned problems with some of the disks.

Having said that, the quality of the videos is terrible. The playback stops and freezes to the point that I had to unplug the player. The chapters are cut and omitted for up to 10 minutes.

So as much as we'd complain every time she put it on we'd eventually get into each episode and at this point in our lives we even know most of the episodes when they're on. So naturally, seeing the case that looks like their house, i knew my mom would loves this for her birthday, so i ordered it. Now i know this would be my fault for not reading every detail, but just so you're all aware this is the only reason in giving it a lower rating is in the hopes that people will be aware when purchasing this because it has a disclaimer that you're going to get either the house case or their new slimer case and i received the slimer case when i really wanted to give her the case that was shaped literally like the little house on the prairie!

Well......we watch AT LEAST 1-2 episodes EVERY NIGHT to unwind before going to sleep.  She LOVES it.......Keeps asking - ""can we watch another? - and another?"" - etc.  Considering nowadays - all the cartoons - etc. out there show no learning value whatsoever........IE :  SPONGE BOB - ETC.

We just started season three and have so far encountered multiple episodes on each of these first three discs that freeze up mid episode and will not continue, and a couple episodes that won't even start, so we are unable to watch at all.  There are no blemishes on the discs, but they just don't play. We have never had a single issue with our player except with these discs.

There is also an occasional odd audio background noise in episodes. This doesn't make them unwatchable, but it is noticeable and considering the freezing issues it stinks. The box claims these are remastered but clearly that doesn't include the audio.

Considering the cost, and Lionsgate being a huge company I am especially pissed off. Don't waste your money on these.",1514592000,,905,4.679245283018868

7357052,3,B012O29ISG,"We have been watching this in order since we purchased it in February.  We absolutely love the TV series, and love having the remastered edition in the 'Little House' box.  However, we have been having more and more frequent issues with the DVDs.  It started small, with certain points freezing for a moment or two.  We accepted those as being not THAT big of a deal, but it has just gotten worse and worse.  It freezes for longer, skips certain parts, is extremely pixelated in others.  We just finished trying to watch Season 8, Episode 20 'A Faraway Cry' - it started freezing and skipping, and then completely stopped playing, and we couldn't watch the last 1/4 of the show.  We then moved on to Episode 21, which said it was the first part of  a two part episode.  It was immediately clear that it was not the first part - it showed the recap from an episode we had never seen.  And then continued on to the second part of the episode.  The episode listed as part 2, is also part 2.  So we have two part 2s, and no part 1.  Of the Season 8 season finale.  On top of that, as I'm writing this, the episode just clearly skipped ahead, skipping a good chunk of the episode.  I'm not too sure who is to blame for this - but this has been so disappointing that I don't see myself purchasing any other DVD sets from this seller, just in case.  We paid a lot of money for these DVDs and the quality is nowhere near equal to what we paid, or what it should be for this TV series.  I don't know if someone can replace the problematic DVDs or not, I just hope we're not stuck with this screwed up DVD series.",1504483200,9,1603,4.186274509803922

7357065,3,B012O29ISG,"So frustrated! I was so excited to buy this product, as this was my absolute favorite show growing up. The package arrived on a rainy day. Yet the DVDs/packaging were well protected by an inner box that was well padded, additionally the cute cardboard house that holds the DVDs was shrink wrapped. I watched several DVDs with no problem. Sadly, I now am trying to watch one that keeps pausing and freezing. I had read the other reviews of this being a common problem. But I had been optimistic that the problem would not happen to me. I am going to keep a log of damaged disks if there are additional ones that have a similar problem. I hope the company will respond with replacement disk (s). Frustrating also that we cannot ask questions on this item. Sounds like from one of the other reviewers, these disks are made cheaply. I hope they improve the quality. Other than this, so glad to have this series. I do wish they included a small insert that had a sentence or two description of what each episode is about.",1500076800,2,1016,4.467741935483871

7357068,5,B012O29ISG,"It was my husband who insisted we buy the complete series, after finding out that only some of the seasons were available on Amazon Prime. That said, the series is wholesomely good and that will never change.

There was one slight problem with this set: Season 8 is silk screened as season 9 and in season 9's box, and season 9 is actually season 8. They really fouled up big time on this issue. Otherwise, it is a great set. Just watch season 9 before season 8 and you'll be okay and not wonder how a town that was blown up suddenly is shown as whole again.",1498435200,4,558,4.214953271028038

I am a little scared that the farther i get in the series the more i will find wrong with it. I am hoping to get ahold of the company and see if they can send the first disk in season 6 at the least but i did buy this in feb of this year. So when you get it look at the season right away.,1498435200,22,470,3.4339622641509435

We have not watched all the shows yet(on these disks), so I can not comment on the quality of every disk. But, so far, they seem to be well made. This set includes all seasons and the movies. This is one of those shows where they do allot of filming outdoors, which I think, it makes it more realistic. Melissa Gilbert and Michael Landon are fantastic actors.

7357106,1,B012O29ISG,"Some disks were slightly scratched coming out of the case they come in (bad handling on the part of the manufacturer) causing the video to be slightly distorted (pixilated) at times but not for very long I'd say maybe a minute each time and it only happened on a few disks not all of them. Also the set is not quite complete it's missing the longer Thanksgiving, story and seems to be replaced with a shorter version and there are a couple other times where parts were different (replace with a different version) than the other version sold on Amazon. Not that big of a deal though.

Update: I originally gave this 3 stars being OK because of some scratches and blemishes however I have now been trying to watch the last four seasons and found many episodes not working they would just freeze and I am not able to watch them also I don't know if others have this problem but my set has double episodes instead of all the episodes season seven had five episodes that were in season six and season eight has three from seven and there are missing episodes because of this error in manufacturing. How this passed quality control is mind boggling.",1489017600,19,1410,5.351351351351352

However the box set is sold as the complete series ..but it isn't the complete series. Its missing the two of the last three episodes (it includes bless all the dear children) its missing look back to yesterday and the last fairwell.
  the little house in the Praise series went out as seasons... so it does include seasons 1-9 however the show was cancelled and the three last episodes... don't belong to a season but its still part of the series.

7357162,2,B012O29ISG,"Only two stars because we are only on season three and on three separate discs, an episode locked up and would not continue to play, mid-show!  Whatever is wrong with the disc causes the entire DVD player to completely lock up and the only way to make the thing function again is to unplug the device, then plug it in again, and then you will be able to watch other shows on the disc, but not the one it locks up on because it will lock up again when it gets to the point where it locked up the first time.  Having watched hundreds of DVD's in my lifetime, I have never had such a peculiar problem before where a DVD locks up the player and not even the power button will function!  I thought maybe it was the player, but tried playing each disc in three different DVD players and on each attempt, the same result, the device freezing and locking up.  Too late to send the thing back, but, I do like the episodes that do not have problems, the picture quality is great and it is still a very nice set, but with three lock ups in only the first three seasons, I'm not sure I can recommend this product, too bad because when it works, it is terrific.

I came home from work the Friday prior to find it delivered on the porch! This was beyond awesome because we went out for dinner and came home to a Little House on the Prairie kinda night!
As for product reviews, though it just arrived yesterday we haven't had the time to go through all the discs the ones we have watched have been of perfect quality. No skipping and no freezing. As for having 50 discs to choose from, I can't imagine how long it is going to take us to watch them all! I hope this helps! One question I have for those who have already purchased and viewed this set, my wife is lookIng for a specific episode where  Caroline tells Pa she wants or wanted Windows in their house. Can anyone help me find this specific episode? Considering this is the complete set it has to be in there somewhere!",1470441600,2,982,4.279569892473118

The season 1 episode ""If I Should Wake Before I Die"" looks horrible on the Imavision version while it looks beautiful just like everything else from this set.

7357259,5,B012O29ISG,"Little House on the Prairie Complete Series, DVD

This consists of all nine seasons of a TV series that was popular not just in America but elsewhere (Petite Maison dans la Prairie). These are based on the six volumes written by Laura Ingalls Wilder in the 1930's about her life in the late 19th century. These books provide her personal memories of family life during that time. The usual academic books seldom provide a personal history of ordinary people. The stories in the TV series were dramatized. They could not use real names from that era because of privacy concerns. One book said some of the characters in the novels were composites characters. This doesnt make the stories false. Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote other books. There is a biography about Laura that may interest any fan of the series. These stories tells about life in that era.

Laura wrote about the difference between a dirt floor and a wood floor. The former was warmer in winter, the latter was easier to keep clean. There might be a mention of their water well but no mention of their privy. [I am old enough to remember visiting a relative in a farming area who still had both facilities.] Some reviewers complained about some deleted scenes but did not describe what they were. [I read that a newer version of the movie Jaws used electronic editing to remove the firearms carried by the people. A book about the true event that inspired this novel said people bought and exploded dynamite in the creeks to kill the man-eating shark. In recent times the phrase injured while swimming was used to describe a shark attack at the shore.] If a few scenes were indeed deleted they should not affect the overall story. Do the individual seasons have the complete stories?

The late 19th century saw great changes in America. Immigration increased, the country became industrialized when high tariffs protected and fostered domestic manufacturing. This allowed America to become a first rate world power. People in farming complained and formed political parties and alliances. People in industrialized areas formed unions for economic justice. The wealthy fought them both. These events are not included in these episodes. Unemployed workers migrated in search of work (tramps or hoe boys). The Grapes of Wrath showed another view of rural life. The post-Civil War homestead laws provided land for those who could work and improve these lands. Their crops and cattle provided shipping business for the railroads. The US gave block grants of square miles of land to railroad companies to subsidize their construction and businesses. The overbuilding eventually led to bankruptcies and the disappearance of railroads. European railroads were built to meet government directions and avoided duplication of services. Or so I read in a history book.",1449792000,,2817,5.014957264957265

7357264,4,B012O29ISG,"I did like the set overall, still disapointed not being released on Blu-ray. This season is supposed to be complete and uncut, season 7 disc #2 Episode- Divorce Walnut Grove Style (45 min not the usual 48min) is indeed not in its complete uncut version, it does contain scenes that the imavision  set did not include but also omitted  scenes that the imavision set included. At about 7-8 min into DVD, The new set omits Charles getting first pane of  glass for the picture window from Nels at the Mercantile and substitutes it with another scene that was not in Imavisions set. 2nd after Harriet tells Nellie at the restaurant that Laura is leaving Almanzo, there is a scene (about 15 min into dvd) with Harriet getting ready for bed, carrying on to Nels about how they( Laura and Almanzo)  were bound to get seperated and how it is important to keep romance alive in a marriage. this scene is replaced in the new Lionsgate version with the other scenes that were originally cut out of imavision version. So in essence we have the Imavision set missing 2 scenes and the Lionsgate version missing 2
entirely  different scenes, making neither complete or uncut.
 This was  disappointing since I had hoped to finally have the entire series uncut but of course we are still missing The Little House Years from Season six. It looks like no Company is ever going to get it 100%, and by the time they do we will have purchased the set many times over but the quality of this set is by far better than the previous set.",1447891200,207,1511,4.533088235294118

Guaranteed, this is just the marketing team's strategy to release this full DVD set, and then when the sales finally stop, the Blu Ray's for the final season will magically appear (after a full box set of the entire series on blu ray).  Just don't do anything until the blu ray's for s7-9 are released individually, which will happen!  Shameful of Lionsgate to do this!",1444521600,13,432,4.584415584415584

8726293,1,B012O29ISG,The LHOTP set I ordered was from Amazon and directly from Amazon Services so I assumed that all the discs would work great. I read many reviews saying they were having problems with the discs and I had the exact same problem on multiple DVD players. I have never in my life bought an Authentic copy directly from Amazon Services on the Amazon.com site and the DVD's are not working. I am very disappointed because this was for my grandchildren. I am returning the whole set for a full refund today. I hope Lionsgate gets things in order and makes these corrections. But in my experience every LHOTP set has problems with episodes freezing and not playing right. Very disappointing. This should not be happening. I hope they finally release a set that is remastered and works without problems. If I could give less than 1 star I would but I can't. This show is great for families and it needs to be released properly for once. I was glad the episodes were remastered and looked better than they used to but if the discs don't play then it's just a big paper weight. PLEASE NOTE..I had to pull the power plug out of the back of my DVD player multiple times because the disc would freeze up my DVD player. This had only happened with this DVD set and nothing else I have ever used with my Samsung DVD player. I hope this review helps people and Amazon to get this problem fixed sooner than later.,1534464000,,1393,4.424124513618677

8726297,5,B012O29ISG,"Ordered for my wife and found myself watching the episodes again. I have seen them on cable plenty of times.
I was reminded how many life lessons are in this series. This series might be not right for everyone but it sure is right for us. Some might be upset that the church and religion is featured too much. I guess everyone has an opinion.
There are successes and hardships in everyones life. It is what you do with them that shows ones true character.

I do wish I had grown up w this series it would have taught me in a different way and reached me in a way no one at the time could.

It is series like this and M*A*S*H which I did watch as a child. They and series like them IMO that helped me grow up.
Thats my experiences and opinion. I do value series that show life a bit more honestly. Those 80s sitcoms while nice just weren't the same and didn't honestly teach me a thing.
They are very clear and nice to not have all of the commercials. It appears to be the whole series. It also has three movies and special features.
Update it has skipped a couple of times and it didn't seem to bother me as much as others. But I will reduce the rating now to four stars. I do still consider it a great value though.i put it back up to five as I tried it on a regular dvd and had no difficulties w it playing so far now.",1533427200,,1320,4.015209125475285
