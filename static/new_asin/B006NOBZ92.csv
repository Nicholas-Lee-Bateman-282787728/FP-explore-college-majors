8501448,4,B006NOBZ92,"Wonderful movie of a ravaged Italian village in WWII.  Americans, led by John Hodiak, come in to clear the rubble and provide emergency supplies.  Much frustration as the worst have risen to the top, that is, the commanders in charge are the most uncaring.  Tierney pulls off her role as village girl but the ""blonde is my Brooklyn"" was a stretch.  Hodiak and Bendix and fantastic, and this was Hodiak's favorite film role in his all-too-short life. This is a good movie.",1451606400,,471,4.7073170731707314

8501452,4,B006NOBZ92,"During WWII, an Italian-American U.S. Army major (John Hodiak) is placed in charge of the small seaside Italian village of Adano. His duty is assist the townspeople's transition from fascism to democracy among other things. But a bell that was taken by the fascist government and melted into ammunition and was a symbol for the town's daily life may be what's needed to restore order to the town. Based on the Pulitzer prize winning novel by John Hersey, this is a delightful dramedy that shows what can be done when one abides by common sense rather than adhering to the rule books, even if it means a personal drawback. There is an unusually adult relationship between the married Hodiak and a young girl (Gene Tierney, who's charming despite her dicey Italian accent) who's waiting for her fianc to return from a prisoner of war camp. Their need for companionship when separated from their loved ones takes precedence over social convention. The film's cinematic highpoint is the return of the Italian POWs to the women who've been waiting for them, affectingly handled by the director Henry King (12 O'CLOCK HIGH). The strong score is by Alfred Newman. With William Bendix, Richard Conte, Glenn Langan, Harry Morgan, Marcel Dalio, Hugo Haas, Eduardo Ciannelli, Fortunio Bonanova and Roy Roberts.

The Bounty DVD via Australia is a pristien black and white transfer.",1328745600,4,1369,5.004385964912281
