5963900,3,B00F2V7U6Y,"Seeing as only the cardio workouts are the hardest in the series for me, I wasn't expecting too much from this yoga DVD.  I am an advanced workout person so I did level 2.  I barely sweated and didn't feel like I got much of a workout.  This must be for beginners.  Also, did I miss workout #4?",1379462400,2,294,4.017241379310345
5963901,5,B00F2V7U6Y,"This is a great video!  I am on a weight loss program and have been practicing yoga for 2 years.  I have had to make some modifications in my practice but over time I have progressed.  This video is good for a beginner or advanced athlete, and is very similar to my practice with my instructor here at home.  Yet both of these workouts still offers some challenges for me.  Bob's instruction is very good and he does emphasize and explain the correct positions throughout the workouts.  I recommend this and love the practice of yoga!!  Thank you Bob this is great!!",1379030400,10,566,4.490196078431373

8611782,5,B00F2V7U6Y,"Challenging, fun and just the right length. And Bob give such nice and easy instruction. This is more challenging than Bob's Biggest Loser yoga workout, which I also enjoyed. I like how he combines athleticism and strength with more traditional yoga - for example with knee bends, planks, sit-ups and crunches. I'll be looking for some of his other ""Skinny Rules"" DVDs, too.",1439164800,2,374,4.9523809523809526
8611783,4,B00F2V7U6Y,"I like that there are 2/ 30-minute workouts. The first workout is similar to his ""Warrior Yoga"" moves. I didn't think it was a ""beginner"" yoga workout, though. I've done yoga for about a year, and found it adequately challenging, but I think someone brand new to yoga would have a harder time.",1438128000,,293,4.547169811320755
8611784,2,B00F2V7U6Y,"I love Bob Harper's workout DVDs and bought all of them.  However, I am quite disappointed with these five new ones.  He changed the format.  All other DVDs, especially the Inside Out Method ones, truly deserve 5 stars.",1435363200,,219,4.7105263157894735

8611790,4,B00F2V7U6Y,I am a huge Bob Harper fan and this DVD lives up to my expectations. There are some Yoga moves on the DVD that were new to me so that keeps it interesting and challengin.,1381708800,4,170,3.8857142857142857
