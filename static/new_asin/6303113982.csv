7839127,4,6303113982,"This Cabin Fever Little Rascals tape features commentary by film historian Leonard Maltin. As always, the picture quality is excellent.

""Hook and Ladder"" starts out the tape with the gang from the early talkies. Dickie Moore is the fire chief of the gang's fire station. His pal Stymie is his second in command and his little brother Spanky is just a nuisance. Spanky has worms and constantly needs to be given his medicine oil, but he protests every time. When the kids decide to lay down to sleep and snore like real firemen, a fire breaks out in an old barn. It's the gang to the rescue as cleverly homemade fire engines fueled by running animals chase the real fire fighters. Stymie runs inside to save the loot- boxes of explosives, while the rest of the gang puts out the blaze. The wonderful lines make this short a winner.

""The First Round-Up"" is the weakest short on this tape. Wally needs to get a new doll for his friend's sweet little sister before her bedtime because she can't sleep without one and bully Leonard destroyed her old one. The gang gets to work on a plan to buy her a doll that closes its eyes and says ""Mammy and Pappy and Poo-poo-patoo!"" They find the perfect doll-- in Leonard's father's shop. They ask how much it will cost, but they don't have enough, unless they are willing to part with Petey in exchange. After failing to make money, they reluctantly cash in Petey, but it turns out he hates Leonard just as much as the gang!

""Teacher's Beau"" is much more memorable. School is out, and the kids find out that they're going to lose their sweet teacher Miss Jones. Next year, they'll have Mrs. Wilson; that's because Miss Jones is getting married! The kids don't realize they won't have a different teacher at all, so they devise a plan to give ""that Ralph guy the air."" First they try to intimidate him by pretending to be ""the other man."" Then, they overhear the engaged couple joking around that he would not marry her if she weren't a good cook. Eureka! Spanky and Buckwheat pour every condiment into the noodle dish that Miss Jones made for the engagement party from tobasco to pepper to horseradish. Unfortunately, they realize their blunder just before supper and are forced to eat the concoction!

You might recognize parts of ""Hearts Are Thumps"" from the 1994 feature. It is Valentines Day and Alfalfa and Darla are sharing lunch together. Spanky and Buckwheat want to get even; after all, Alfalfa is a member of the He-Man Woman Hater's Club. They find a way to switch all of the good food in Darla's basket with soap from the cheese sandwich to the cream puff. Thanks to all of the soap, Alfalfa's final croon is decorated with lots of sudsy bubbles.",1208649600,2,2697,4.577639751552795
