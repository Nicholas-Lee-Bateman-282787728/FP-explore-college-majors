8033541,5,B0002W2MKC,"This is a wonderful movie for people of the generation of the stars of this movie, and anyone else who can identify with them.  It capitalizes on the zany personality of Louise Lasser, who accompanies and pesters the amiable Charles Grodin all the way across America, until at the end of the trip, he realizes he is in love with her.  It has one hilarious scene after another, contrasting her brash navet with his bemused, but good natured tolerance.  The scene in which their car has a flat tire that he can't change but she can, is priceless.  I hope it will be re-released for a new generation.",1332374400,3,597,4.5
