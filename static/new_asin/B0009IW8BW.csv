2293564,5,B0009IW8BW,"This is a samurai flick that put Sanada on the map as one of the great jindai, or otherwise actors. The plot is solid, if a little water colored.

What is apparent upon opening this collection is that it suffers from being largely an afterthought.

2293566,5,B0009IW8BW,"I have always enjoyed movies by Bruce Lee, Jet Li, Jack Lee and somewhat Jackie Chan (I give him 3 stars because I do not always get on with his sense of humour). I was introduced to Sonny Chiba's movie by accident when last year a friend gave me a movie by Sonny Chiba called ""Bodyguard"". I like Sonny Chiba immediately and am currently looking forward to receive a collection from Amazon.com. Like Bruce Lee, Sonny Chiba has a fabulous presence on the screen. As a senior instructor of a Wu Tang Kung Fu School and a Ju Jit Su school, I can see that Sonny Chiba really knows Karate. I would sincerely recommend this collection to anyone who enjoys Bruce Lee, Jet Li, Jack Lee and Kackie CHan's movies.",1231545600,2,703,4.415384615384616
2293567,4,B0009IW8BW,"Thanks to Quentin Tarantino Sonny Chiba has had a bit of a career revival.  Since Tarantino featured a Chiba fanatic main character in his screenplay for True Romance Chiba's been brought back to public attention in the U.S.

Over the last few years many different Sonny Chiba collections have been released on DVD.  Some of them are good, some not so good.  This one, The Sonny Chiba Collection, is one of the better releases.  BCI has again teamed up with Adness to release anamorphic widescreen versions of some of Sonny Chiba's best movies....along with a couple titles that don't really belong in a ""Sonny Chiba Collection.""

First, the classic Japanese hijacking/extortion film (and the basis for the movie Speed), Bullet Train is included in both the international edit (English dub, 115 minutes) and the original Japanese version (152 minutes).  The sound on the international version is pretty thin and tinny, and English dubs of Asian movies is usually mediocre at best - although this one isn't too bad.  The Japanese version, however, is very good.  The picture quality is excellent for a non-restored print of a 35 year old movie, and the sound is more than acceptable for a film of that vintage.  The only downside to this movie (as part of this set)?  Not a lot of Chiba.  He has a major supporting role, but is not the main character (that role went to the great Ken Takakura).  Still, this is a classic thriller (and I would have paid $[...] for an anamorphic widescreen release of the Japanese version by itself).

Golgo 13 is a top notch Chiba movie, where he plays an international hit man.  While this one has more action that Bullet Train, it has less action than many of Chiba's samurai or karate movies, and it plays as more of an action thriller than your typical kick ass Sonny Chiba action movie.  Don't take that as a negative, however, as the script is actually one of the best Chiba got to work with in a leading role during the 70's.  The Japanese audio is again noticeably stronger than the English dub.

Karate Warriors is more of what many Chiba fans go for - out and out action.  This time it's a variation on Kurosawa's Yojimbo.  Kurosawa this is not - but Kurosawa never got to work with Sonny Chiba, either.  Chiba's got IT, and this is one of those movies that really shows his charisma and screen presence.  This is one of the stronger movies that Chiba headlined (again, the difference is a decent script), and it is another highlight of the set.  English dub only on this one, and while the sound is again a little thin (and sometimes just a tad muddy), it is adequate.  The picture quality is uneven, but it is anamorphic widescreen, and it looks much better than most public domain releases.

The Bodyguard has some of that cheese that many people associate with 70's martial artus/karate movies, but it also has a fairly complex plot and a decent script (although, this is one of the 4 movies in the set that do not have the original Japanese audio, so it's hard to tell what the original script was like - it could have been significantly better than the English dub script).  There are several good action sequences, and some genuine suspense in this movie.  Good to very good picture quality, and the sound is again adequate to good.

Then we get to the two titles that probably shouldn't have been included in this set - Dragon Princess and Sister Street Fighter.  Neither one features Sonny Chiba in anything more than a glorified cameo role, and neither one is as good as the other movies in this set.  Sure, there is lots of action, and some good fight scenes, but weaker scripts hurt these films.  As for the audio?  English dubs only, but the sound quality is decent for both.  The picture quality is noticeably poorer for Dragon princess (lots of very fine vertical emulsion layer scratches from time to time, and the color level shifts dramatically - whether that's intentional or not I'm not sure).  Sister Street fighter fares a little better, but not a lot.

Two of the discs in this set are from BCI's ""Grindhouse"" series, and that probably explains the inclusion of Dragon Princess and Sister Street Fighter (as they were paired up with legit Sonny Chiba movies as double feature discs, and BCI just used their previously mastered and pressed discs).

Overall, this set (at around $[...]) is a great value and a must have for any fan of Sonny Chiba - or for anyone interested in (or just curious about) Chiba's movies.  Considering the [...] this set is Highly Recommended.",1208044800,28,4534,4.657861635220126
2293568,5,B0009IW8BW,"I saw this film in 1985 when I was 13, and was knocked off my feet due to the fact that not only was this a good story, but the music took it to a different place. The music was a jazz infused score that reminded me of the sounds that were coming out of Japan in the 70's thanks to the Japanese Jazz/Fusion group Hiroshima. Japan was really big into urban contemporary jazz at this time when Hiroshoma ushered in this style into their culture. Hiroyuki ""Henry"" Sanada became a favorite Japanese actor of mine as a result of this film, and I made it a mission to track down every film he had done.  The music made it an unusual treat in this film, especially Sanada's dance sequence that gave you a glimpse into his former pop star days. In case you didn't know Henry Sanada was a 70's pop star in Japan for a minute; he also is a Shakespearean trained actor with an immense classical background in theatre. Linking up with Sonny Chiba's Japan Action Club as one of Chiba's stunt actor's took him to another level in his career, which is why at age 43 he is still doing his thing in films such as The Last Samurai and Rush Hour 3. It's hard not to love this film, especially for those with open minds to alternatives in Japanese cinema.",1207612800,2,1235,4.25531914893617

2293573,4,B0009IW8BW,"DVD Review: This is a 6 film set. 2 of the discs is the Grindhouse double feature which you could get separately which 1 disc contains Karate Warriors and Dragon Princess and 2 disc contains The Bodyguard and Sister Street Fighter. These four films are all English dubbed (no Japanese w/ subs). Golgo 13 comes in a single disc in Japanese w/ subs and English dubbed. And finally there are 2 versions of Bullet Train on 2 separate discs. On is uncut Japanese version and the other is cut in English. The picture quality is fine in all the films. Some damage but that's how you watch Grindhouse movies you posers!

Movie Review: Golgo 13: Sonny plays a hit man who kills a bunch of drug dealers. This is a good action thriller with gun fights, karate action with a descent story. Not Sonny's best movie but it's entertaining enough.  3 1/2 stars.

Bullet Train: Sonny is a co-star in this movie and does NO KARATE!! I liked Speed and I know Speed was influenced (assuming) by Bullet Train but Bullet Train was s******. It was boring and I didn't care about anyone in this movie. So up yours.  2 stars

Karate Warriors: This is one BAD-ASS MOVIE!! The karate action and blood splatter was superb and the story was easy to follow unlike most Japanese exploitation movies.  4 1/2 stars

Dragon Princess: Sonny is only in this movie for the beginning. This is a Etsuko Shihomi movie where she is on a quest to avenge her father for some s***. This one was okay. I think Etsuko is cute and f***able, the characters are cool and the karate action was neat but the pacing was slow as hell.  3 stars

Sister Street Fighter: THIS FILM RULES!!!! Lots of bloody gory karate action and confusing story about some broad karate kicking people to rescue her brother. I love Etsuko in this movie and I wanna make f*** with her. Sonny Chiba is in this movie but as a character actor more so than a co-star.  4 1/2 stars.

The Bodyguard: The pacing is a little slow but I did like this movie. I don't know why but I did. So shut up!  3 1/2 stars.

Conclusion: Well 3 of the 6 movies are Sonny Chiba films while the others are either a Etsuko Shihomi movie or something. 4 stars for the DVD set.",1429920000,,2174,4.364764267990075
2293574,5,B0009IW8BW,"One of my favorite movies staring Sony Chiba. The action is fierce and the sound track is so groovy and bad it's awesome! It also plays to a theme I like, Kung-fu versus Karate. You so rarely see it done so realistically. He is trained in China and comes back to Japan and kicks everyone's butt! Then, when he is finally defeated, he is re-trained in Karate and decimates. Just love this movie.

The transfer is likely the best it will ever be for a US release. It is possible that a better transfer was made in Japan, but I haven't seen a blu-ray release.",1424131200,,556,4.295238095238095

The story makes a lot more sense with all the cut footage added back into the film.  This is one of those over-looked classic Ninja movies. One thing is the realistic period costumes of the ninja (in other words they are not all dressed in black as today's Hollywood likes to portray but colors that would have been realistic for the environments they were working in), for example they wear camouflage, lite gray, and period dress, which is what they really wore. And the variety of the ninja is nice too, spider-ninja, monk-ninja, samurai-ninja, etc. also three different ninja clans battling each other. the action is on par with today's standards.

2293595,5,B0009IW8BW,Fantastic box set with the real gem being Resurrection of the Golden Wolf. Yusaku Matsuda is a cinematic icon and to have that film in this set for such a low price is a bargain. His films are always acclaimed and always expensive (VHS tapes back in the day were always 39.95).

It is not a total waste since Bullet train is a 2 disk set and Golgo 13 are both not dubbed.  But i got the set for the body gaurd and karate warriors.

I have to admit that I really enjoyed this movie as well as Ninja Wars. While neither one of these films will ever be considered ""classics"" by Hollywood standards, they are both a lot of fun! Honestly, I could have done without Resurrection of Golden Wolf and GI Samurai.

2293599,5,B0009IW8BW,"Mill Creek's Sonny Chiba Collection features 4 great Japanese action flicks, all from the late 70s through early 80s, all filled with copious amounts of ass kicking and a varying quantity of Sonny Chiba.

GI SAMURAI is the only film in this set that can be truly said to STAR Sonny Chiba. He plays a JSDF commander zapped back to in time to feudal Japan along with his squad and some very heavy artillery. Their only way to return home . . . is to f%#& up history! Chiba is absolutely glorious in his role as the unstable commander. Some awe inspiring action and touching meditative moments mix with cheeseball J-Pop and an EXTREMELY meandering storyline to create a one-of-a-kind experience. GI SAMURAI!

LEGEND OF THE EIGHT SAMURAI is a no-holds-barred epic fantasy filled with demons, monsters, romance, tragedy, and THE EIGHT SAMURAI! Sonny Chiba has a strong supporting role and gets to mix it up with the demon army. No real karate stuff here, though.

RESURRECTION OF GOLDEN WOLF is a sleazy crime thriller about a brutal thief who lives a daring double life. And that thief is . . . NOT Sonny Chiba! Chiba plays a minor supporting character with an important role in a subplot. The film is very good regardless, and very weird too! ""When do we get to Jupiter?""

NINJA WARS, aka NINJA DEATH or DEATH OF A NINJA, is another dark fantasy feature in the vein of EIGHT SAMURAI. Sonny Chiba is onscreen for a grand total of maybe five minutes, but there's enough twisted visions and dark doings [head swapping, puking monks, HELL] to make up for that. Think of it as an unrelated bonus film in the Sonny Chiba Collection.

With anamorphic transfers and the original Japanese audio, you can't go wrong dropping $$$ on this set! [Aside from Mill Creek's awful new packaging - very slick looking on the outside, but the disc storage isn't very practical!]",1289692800,11,1854,4.674846625766871
2293600,5,B0009IW8BW,"Of course if you are a Shinichi ""Sonny"" Chiba fan this will be a dream come true; 4 films at an incredible price.  The individual films are described elsewhere, so I wanted to correct the product description, from amazon.  These are not the old, terribly dubbed english versions in pan scan format at all.  Four films, on three dvd's, each film is presented in a beautiful, anamorphic widescreen transfer, featuring sharp images and vibrant color. and most importantly, for once the awful English dubbing is gone.  Each film features the original Japanese audio, with optional and excellent yellow english subtitles. (There is no English language option at all) These are the Japan versions of the films as well, much longer, uncut versions never seen in the West.  The result is a high quality product at a wonderful price.  for the first time these films can be seen the way they were meant to be seen, and not recut and voiced over by some incompetant idiot with no respect for the artistic value of these rare works.  just be aware when buying this for the comical effect you remember when you saw the old versions, it is a different experience entirely in the original language.  Great product!",1274745600,44,1199,4.786407766990291
2293601,2,B0009IW8BW,"If you aren't a fan of the Sonny Chiba ensemble, you most likely will not like this film, and if you are a fan, then you still might not like this film.  This film is one of their less memorable films.

The warlord, Hideyoshi (but I can't remember if it is Hideyoshi Toyotomi, or a fictional warlord)sends his vassal, Shiranui (played by Sonny Chiba), who has ties with the Koga ninjas, to destroy the Momochi clan, an Iga ninja group.  The reason: The Momochi clan has a stash of hidden gold, its whereabouts which will be known when two daggers are puyt together.  Shiranui's side destroy the village and kill their leader, Sandayu Momochi, and get one of the daggers. One of the survivors is Takamaru, a boy who escapes overseas.  Ten years later (played by Hiroyuki Sanada), he returns for revenge.

It's a standard Japanese revenge plot.  The only suspense is with Hattori Hanzo, the leader of another Iga ninja clan.  He also knows of the daggers and the gold.  Will he be an ally to Takamaru, or an enemy?

As far as the action, there is nothing special with this movie over any other Hiroyuki Sanada, Sonny Chiba, or Etsuko Shiomi film.  You do get to see Hirouyuki Sanada do some ritualistic dance, that I've not seen in other films, but this did not move me, either.

So, it's got this plot twist, a dance by Sanada, and everything else is standard. Why a two, and not a three star rating? I really couldn't connect with the characters. Without a connection with the characters, the action needs to take command, and it didn't.  The plot had a little intrigue, but it was too little to make a difference.

Bottom line, if you are intent, for completeness sake, on seeing all the films by one of the actors who appear in this film, it's not that painful.  But if you've never seen a film by the ensemble together, pass this one up and start with a different film these three made together.",1268524800,,1898,4.49271137026239
