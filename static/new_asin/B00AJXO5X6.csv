5444230,3,B00AJXO5X6,"Sadly, this set of movies misses the mark for me. Only Cyclone was entertaining. The others were so character card board cutouts with no real development or depth. Shallow as can be, and very amateurish in direction and story development. I enjoy ""B"" movies, but not these. So I would skip.",1365120000,2,290,4.705882352941177
5444231,4,B00AJXO5X6,"This is great that these older movies are starting to come out on DVD. Grew up with most of these on VHS and watched over and over again. But the thing I can not understand is -- - WHY are they not on Blu ray ? Took 20 + years to make it to DVD, but now that format is becoming out dated. I would love to relive these in HIGH DEF. This is why I have decided not to buy. If it was on Blu ray I would pay 20.00 + for it........",1364860800,,425,3.5319148936170213
5444232,4,B00AJXO5X6,"Shout Factory have released another high-quality, low-price b-movie set in the style of their excellent Roger Corman's Cult Classics releases like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roger-Corman-s-Cult-Classics-Sword-And-Sorcery-Collection-Deathstalker-Deathstalker-II-The-Warrior-And-The-Sorceress-Barbarian-Queen/dp/B004ZKKKXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roger Corman's Cult Classics Sword And Sorcery Collection (Deathstalker, Deathstalker II, The Warrior And The Sorceress & Barbarian Queen)</a>. Included here are Exterminator II (1984), Eye of the Tiger (1986), Cyclone (1987) and Alienator (1988, released in 1990), all in nice widescreen transfers and mono (except Eye of the Tiger, which is in stereo). The only extra is a commentary track on Exterminator 2, which is nice to have, but as anyone who experienced Exterminator II director Mark Buntzman's commentary on the Arrow Films UK release of the first Exterminator knows, he can be quite a quiet and dull talker on commentary tracks. Here he's accompanied by Mario Van Peebles and it's an okay listen. Would have loved the trailers too, especially for Eye of the Tiger (see it on Youtube) and Exterminator 2.

""Exterminator II"" is to ""Exterminator"" what ""Death Wish 3"" was to ""Death Wish"". Borderline science fiction with post-apocalyptic rape/crime gangs, unbelievable (in both senses of the word) action, limited set design and acting, and Home Alone/MacGuyver-esque gadgetry. It is definitely a fun movie as long as you know going in that it's not going to be very good or grounded, a shock after the excellent first film. It definitely feels like there's an in-between film missing here.

""Eye of the Tiger"" is a cool combination of Death Wish (vigilante/revenge), Commando (wild action movie to save the hero's daughter), Mad Max (the inciting rape attack by a motorcycle gang) , Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (the sci-fi style compound the gang uses in the third act) and Death Wish 4: The Crackdown (actually made after this). It begins with Busey being rehabilitated along with his friend, a definite fake Scarface played by a poor man's Pacino (no, not Ron Silva). It's actually a nice touch. Anyway, typical for this kinda film: Busey's an ex-con, vietnam vet, trying to go straight. He was involved in a (possibly drunken) manslaughter and because of his military record, and a corrupt sheriff, they threw the book at him. Back to work providing for his wife and daughter, he's quickly thrown into a war with the local motorcycle gang who are protected by said corrupt sheriff, while the scared populace turns a blind eye. I won't go into too much detail, because if the film has a core flaw it's that it might take a bit too long to get where it's going. Director Richard Sarafian handles the film quite well, straddling nicely between b-movie exploitation/early direct-to-video styles, and a more mainstream, serious style. Parts are actually reminiscent of his classic Vanishing Point, and once again a Dodge vehicle plays a major part (a sort of cross between the A-Team van and KITT from Knightrider). I don't know who provided the motorcycles for the film but not only is every biker in this town part of this gang, they all ride the EXACT SAME MOTORCYCLE and dress in the exact same M-1965 field jacket and helmet (this makes them, ironically, all resemble the Exterminator from the first Exterminator movie). I get the feeling Sarafian was hired by the Scotti brothers to make a serious picture, which he did, but it was decided to be too serious that perhaps reshoots were done, then the songs and title added to make it more marketable, because quite frankly - James Brown song aside - Eye of the Tiger doesn't really fit here. It's a really fun, cheesy song and so it's of course welcome in a fun, cheesy film. Overall, a great movie if you like lower-budget, 80s action.

""Cyclone"" is a fun one, with a fairly big name cast (Jeffrey Combs, Martin Landau) and fast, clip pace that makes up for the silliness of it (you gotta see this ""high-tech"" motorcycle). Fred Olen Ray is actually revealed, here, to be a semi-competent director - who knew?

""Alienator"" is the worst film in the collection, with a total of two sets and veering dangerously into Jim Wynorski territory - without much of the humour. Oh dear. It's nice to see Joe Pilato in a non-George Romero role though (he was a cop in ""Dawn of the Dead"" and the immortal Captain Rhodes in ""Day of the Dead"") though he basically adds nothing here to his nothing part. Have a look online for the short film version of ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" put together early in the nineties - he was to play the George Clooney part, and the short is scored with ""Hell's Bells"" by AC/DC! Of all the rip offs of James Cameron's Terminator, this is one of the worst I've seen. Costumes, plotting, characters, dialogue - all are awful here. It was worth watching to laugh at, but I had my thumb on fast forward to skip lengthy scenes of nothing here and there. I suggest you do the same.",1364601600,5,5044,5.0661853188929005
5444233,5,B00AJXO5X6,"Shout Factory have released one of the most amazing action movie packs ever! Exterminator 2 is not only presented in Anamorphic standard, it also features a fascinating audio commentary from director Mark Buntzman and Mario Van Peebles! They provide a plethora of interesting facts and trivia behind the making of this 80's cult action classic. I'm very pleased with purchasing this 4 movie pack for Exterminator 2 alone! Many thanks go out to Shout Factory for releasing this!",1364515200,3,477,5.128205128205129

5444235,5,B00AJXO5X6,During my research as a student of 80s film I came across Eye of the Tiger and found this product from Shout Factory on Amazon.  I had never seen or heard of any of these films.  All of these films except Exterminator 2 had poor ratings on IMDB but I wasn't discouraged because I know someone at Shout has an affinity for 80s B-Movies from their release of the Roger Corman catalog.  The quality and clarity of these remastered films is a joy to the 80s fan and this product is no different.  After viewing these four films I realize I am indeed different from most movie viewers out there and am grateful to Shout Factory because apprently I'm not the only one.  Highly recommended!,1363910400,32,683,4.432
5444236,5,B00AJXO5X6,"Finally, Exterminator 2, released on DVD, with Director/Actor commentary, too! I'm really looking forward to receiving this in the mail, I hope that the transfers are good, and not just ripped from VHS copies or something. Shout Factory usually does a good job with their releases though, so... I look forward to checking this out, and will adjust my review accordingly.

UPDATE: Exterminator 2 looks GREAT on this DVD. The best quality version I had seen previously is from a VHS copy. The colors were great, blacks were actually black and not very ""pixel-y""... thumbs up.",1361145600,4,573,4.96875

The stunt work and action scenes are first rate. Finally released on DVD by Shout! Factory in a four-movie set with Eye of the Tiger, Alienator and Cyclone.

5444244,3,B00AJXO5X6,"Caution: Spoilers: Although this film has its fans, I find it a very poor imitation of the original THE EXTERMINATOR (1980), since Mark Buntzman (the producer of the original film) decided to direct, produce and co-write this film (with William Sachs, director of THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN - 1977; GALAXINA - 1981; HITZ - 1988; and others), taking over directing chores from James Glickenhaus. Mark Buntzman is no James Glickenhaus. Imagine making an action exploitation film with very little blood or gore and throw in characters you don't give a damn about, but you really should. At least the original had some wit, charm and imaginative deaths (not to mention one hell of a decapitation). The sequel has none of this, unless you like seeing people on fire and burning to death. The late Robert Ginty returns from the original as John Eastland, and he still is acting like a vigilante, walking around the alleys and back streets of New York City with a flame-thrower strapped to his back, frying would-be thieves and street scum, including the brother of street gang leader X (Mario Van Peebles; NEW JACK CITY - 1991). This seems to upset X, who orders his men to kill Eastland. When Eastland's dancing girlfriend Caroline (Deborah Geffner) is crippled and then killed by X's gang (including the hulking late Irwin Keyes; LOVELY BUT DEADLY - 1981; who plays a character called ""Monster""), Eastland gets down to serious business. He teams up with old Vietnam buddy Be Gee (Frankie Faison; RED DRAGON - 2002), now a garbageman, and they trick-out a garbage truck into a moving fortress, complete with machine guns and grenade launchers. They go after X and his gang and I guess I don't have to tell you the rest.  I remember seeing this film in a theater and then renting the VHS and thinking to myself, ""Man, the editing sucks in this film."" That may be because triple-threat Mark Buntzman (this is his only directorial effort) didn't know how to end a scene (you know there had to be some production trouble when the closing credits say ""Additional scenes directed by William Sachs"", who reshot much of the footage when Cannon Films was not satisfied with Buntzman's final cut). Some scenes just end without explanation and leave you scratching your head and it looks like Cannon Films (the theatrical distributor of this film in the U.S.) had to make some severe cuts in the violence department to receive an R-Rating. The VHS tape, released by MGM-UA Home Video is the same theatrical version. Maybe someday this film will get an uncut release on DVD, but until then I will give this film a thumbs-down. I may raise my thumb into the upright position if I ever see the complete unedited film. This film also contains early acting appearances by Arye Gross (HOUSE II: THE SECOND STORY - 1987), Thomas Calabro (THEY NEST - 2000), Jesse Aragon (WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE - 1986; who died way too young) and John Turturro (TRANSFORMERS - 2007) as ""Guy #1"". NOTE: Finally available on DVD from Shout! Factory as part of their 4 ACTION-PACKED MOVIE MARATHON in its original aspect ratio and audio commentary with director Mark Buntzman and star Mario Van Peebles, but it is the same 89 minute R-Rated theatrical version. Rated R. Note: The best film in this package is EYE OF THE TIGER. Filled with action, a pre-motorcycle crash Gary Busey and a scene involving Vaseline and a lit stick of dynamite that you will have to see to believe.",1459209600,,3433,4.769747899159664

5444272,5,B00AJXO5X6,"The main draw of this particular Shout Factory quadruple feature for me was the first official release of the 1984 cult classic ""Exterminator 2"". In addition to that 80's exploitation gem you get ""Cyclone"", ""Alienator"" and ""Eye of the Tiger"" starring Gary Busey. This is a 2 disc DVD set. While I was worried about each disc housing two films, picture quality didn't suffer from any compression artifacts that I could see despite each film being presented in anamorphic widescreen thankfully. The prints used for each film are clean and in quite excellent condition. While I would have preferred a bluray release, the presentation of these films are very nice. ""Eye of the Tiger"" is the only film out of the 4 to the best of my knowledge to have had a prior DVD release but I can't say if Shout Factory used the same transfer from the MGM disc or not. ""Cyclone"" and ""Alienator"" were both directed by Fred Olen Ray with ""Alienator"" being particularly awful but in a fun way. ""Eye of the Tiger"" and ""Exterminator 2"" on disc 2 are both vigilante flicks. The only film to get an extra is ""Exterminator 2"" in which the director and star Mario Van Peebles sit down for a chatty and incredibly fun commentary track. Each film is presented in 2 channel stereo.  Invite over some friends one weekend, pop open some cold ones and enjoy 6 hours of fine 80's cinematic cheese!",1425772800,4,1364,4.613168724279835

5444276,3,B00AJXO5X6,"Purchased this Action Pack specifically for the commentary. The Director Buntzman (a producer on the initial ""Exterminator"") & Mr. Van Peebles start the proceedings with a fair amount of enthusiasm and recollections. Sadly, the track devolves quickly. Long, and I mean quite long, stretches of silence. Mario is gracious enough to credit the Director (along with his esteemed father) as allowing him to ""look behind the camera,"" influencing his decision to direct. There are hints of fascinating stories as this film was released under ""Cannon Films,"" which could provide an interesting commentary in of itself. These two filmmakers went on to collaborate on future projects, such as ""Posse."" Perhaps a discussion about those films? The last 45 minutes prove to be rather frustrating, with Mark Buntzman openly admitting he doesn't recall entire scenes, and Mario seemingly unimpressed by the 4th and 5th mention by the director that they were able to film, cheaply and efficiently, at his fathers' warehouse. If you would like to hear more about ""Exterminator 2,"" I would advise fans to instead invest in the Blu-Ray edition of ""The Exterminator"" (1980). That edition features a commentary with Buntzman (as producer) along with British moderator Calum Waddell. This commentary is loaded with behind-the-scenes info about both films, and the moderator deftly prods the producer for more trivia and recollections. I always appreciate boutique DVD/Blu-Ray companies (like ""Shout Factory"" or ""Synapse"") for taking the time and effort to find the filmmakers and allow them to contribute to their classic work. But, if your purchase of the 4-pack hinges on the presence of the Commentary solely, my review is for you.",1420416000,2,1713,5.324723247232472

Cyclone:  The lovely heroine's (Heather Thomas) bf (Jeffrey Combs) comes up with a 'transformer' that can act as an infinite supply of energy thus eliminating our reliance on fossil and nuclear fuels.  He does what anyone would do with such technology and installs it in a..............motorcycle.  Some nice action scenes ensue and at the end she unbelievably destroys the device.  I bet if she could see in the future our world ripping itself apart she would really regret that one.  3 out of 5.

Alienator:  Yawntastically horrible is the only way I can describe this one.  Nothing at all to recommend it.  Female bodybuilder Teagan plays the titular role.  I wonder if she thought this would do for her career what The Terminator did for Arnold Schwarzenegger's.  I could barely sit through this stinker.  1 out of 5.

Eye of the Tiger:  Ahhhhh, a true action gem starring Gary Busey and William Smith (young Arnold's dad in Conan).  Gary Busey gets out of jail to find his town overrun with bikers.  It doesn't help matters that the Sheriff is on the take.  They kill his wife and all hell breaks loose.  Gary Busey calls in a favor from a friend from jail for a kewl truck with machine guns.  The soundtrack is a thing of beauty.  5 out of 5.

Exterminator 2:  Having never seen the first Exterminator, I felt that Robert Ginty was a somewhat weak leading man.  That was until I saw him slapping a punk around!!!!  Basically a story about a guy that kills criminals with a flamethrower.  I was a little confused about some elements of the story (does the garbage truck driver know he's the Exterminator?), but in the end it really didn't matter.  Some punks led by the surprisingly charismatic Mario Van Peebles declare war on the city and cripple and then kill Robert Ginty's gf.

My favorite film of the bunch is ""Exterminator 2"" about a Vietnam vet gone vigilante against a crime gang in New York.  Its a pretty brutal film and stars Mario Van Peeples in an early role as a bad guy.  ""Eye of the Tiger"" is next with Gary Busey as a Vietnam vet who locks horns with an evil biker gang who have taken over his town.  He takes them on by himself because he is the only man to do it.  Great fun!  ""Cyclone"" stars Heather Thomas who owns a futuristic motorcycle that the bad buys want.  Jeffrey Combs is her geeky boyfriend who built the bike.  Not a bad movie either.  ""Alienator"" is the least fun of the bunch.  Its a Terminator rip-off about a female cyborg sent to Earth to kill an escape convict from space.  Its very low budget and is very goofy but still has its own charm.  It just doesn't stand as well as the other three films.  However, not a bad time-waster.",1385596800,,998,4.162303664921466
5444304,3,B00AJXO5X6,"This should have been a great movie but comes up short because of the boring soundtrack and a seemingly rushed production. Almost no tension is generated here and the movie becomes just another (but well executed) action piece. Ex con Busey takes on an army of biker bullies lead by the great William Smith. Using demolition, several deadly traps, brutal determination, and a badass bullet-proof pickup that is fully armed, he blows them away for killing his wife. Talented actors Gary Busey and William Smith aren't given very much dramatic to say but their presence is undeniable. Purely from an action standpoint the movie is full of brilliant stunts and fight scenes. I got this movie because so far I can't find anything Busey did in the 90's that is better. With some beer this movie becomes a 4 star instead.",1384041600,,815,4.787234042553192
5444305,5,B00AJXO5X6,"I recently watched ""Eye of the Tiger"" from this collection, and I know that I have already won. Gary Busey as an vet from Vietnam versus a motorcycle gang that hangs out in the desert at some kind of Motorcyclist Ziggurat making drugs. What is not to love? All of these movies are complete fodder to riffing with friends and are great for laughs. Entertaining and unique in their own way. The presentation by Shout! factory is excellent. They got the best audio and video they could, some of these are not in widescreen, though I don't know what format these were all originally filmed in. The transfers vary but overall from the two I have now watched the audio sounds surprisingly good.",1383696000,4,688,4.6016260162601625

Lots of 80's stars in rolls I'm sure they'd rather forget, cheesy dialog, over the top acting and kills, huge on the 80's nostalgia factor, prints look great, there's even commentary and bonus features, this set is a home-run, lots of fun for action and scifi fans.",1369526400,5,339,4.666666666666667

5444313,5,B00AJXO5X6,"What a great TWO disc set containing 4 FANTASTIC films.

The main reason for getting this two disc box set is to view Exterminator 2 in a crystal clear image with additional voice overs by the director Mark buntxman and the main villain played by Mario van peebles

Alienator is a SUPERB action film with a female muscle terminator. All the characters are really good.

Cycole is a mixture of airwolf and street hawk with a female lead. The female lead has a slight attitude but its got some interesting scenes.

Eye of the tiger is BRILLIANT with Gary busey.

Worth buying just for exterminator 2",1366416000,18,597,4.59433962264151
5444314,3,B00AJXO5X6,"Of these 4 films, I actually liked Eye of the Tiger lol.

I like Gary Busey no matter even if hes just used in jokes nowadays.

I liked him in silver bullet, predator 2, lethal weapon growing up.

The film is a lower budget but i thought had ok acting and good pace.

Alienator is one of the worst films ever made, exterminator 2 was crap.

Peebles acing was terrible and ginty was just ginty....

I couldn't even finish cyclone...",1366070400,,431,4.325

5444317,5,B00AJXO5X6,"When the Exterminator was released on Blu-Ray I got it and it was a grade A release. Seeing the Exterminator 2 was on DVD I had to get it. Watching it right now I have to say it is a very good transfer and not a cheap straight from VHS copy. The set is on one sided discs which is great. Overall, very happy with the purchase.",1365552000,3,326,3.8805970149253732
5444318,5,B00AJXO5X6,"I bought this low priced DVDs set for the very awesome action/adventure movie ""Eye of the Tiger""... Excellent fun movie with great acting, especially for a low budget movie.  I haven't yet watched the other three movies,... But, judging by the descriptions, they could be entertaining... I.e. A beautiful Heather Thomas is something to look forward to watching.

By the way, ""Eye of the Tiger"" is NOT suitable for kids or people who don't approve of gratuitous movie violence.

Hope this helped!  Happy shopping.  :)",1365292800,3,516,5.023529411764706

8552796,5,B00AJXO5X6,"I bought this movie pack for Exterminator 2.  It looked like outstanding 80s cheese.  I discovered Eye of the Tiger and pretty much knew it would be a win since it was A. 1980s and B. Gary Busey.  I was blown away!  What an outstanding piece of cinema this was.  I highly reccomend this movie to anyone that is a fan of Gary Busey...or 8s movies...or lots of explosions....or cool trucks....or dirt bike outlaw gangs...or motorcycle rider decapitations.....or William Smith....or mortars installed on Dodge Powerwagons...you get the idea.  This deserves a place right up there with some of the finest action films.  If you like Missing in Action, Commando, Cobra, Out For Justice, Walker Texas Ranger, Point Break, Tango and Cash, Road House....you will love this one.  Add to your collection immediately!!!!!!!!
