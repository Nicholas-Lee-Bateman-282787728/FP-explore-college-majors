7229791,5,B00YQTDJ40,"I would recomend you to watch this movie if you are looking for something  real, a romance that develops slowly, rather than the fast paced lust driven movies that only end by dissapointing you. The movie starts a bit slow, and somehow confusing in the first 30 minutes but as the story develops I felt that I was able to emphasize with the main characters. I agree with the amazon reviewer that comented that this movie is very similar to real life in that, instead of freezing the world around you, just because you came out, it shows that life, with its ups and downs continue in a linear way, no matter when you choose to ""come out"". The only thing I found difficult to asimilate is the silences in the movie.. been more exposed to Hollywood cinema, you are  prone to expect every scene full of dialoge that will clue you in the character mood at any given point; on this movie you truly need to rely in your ability on reading people body language and facial expression in order to get that. Not a bad thing tho, just different.",1437868800,11,1033,4.403141361256544
7229792,5,B00YQTDJ40,One of the best LGBT movies I have watched (and I've watched many).  Love the fact that it was not about LGBT but really about 2 best friends that cared about each other as friends. Yet you could see the love from each from the beginning.  Last scene was spectacular!!,1437696000,11,268,4.34
7229793,5,B00YQTDJ40,"Despite the bad reviews on here I watched it because of the star ratings. Yes it is a simple plot of coming out but thats not all the story was about. Yes it centered on the gay aspect of the movie but everything blossomed in a not hollywood driven center of attention way. It felt like this was actually someones life, because in real life everything else going on doesn't just get drowned in the background. My favorite movies are the movies like this one. Like this story could honest to god happen in real life. I recommend it. And to the person (SPOILER ALERT) that said it was bad because they only kissed once and had only one sex scene. Yes if you like a lot of bang bang bang don't watch this movie but if you want a tender slow building love story/scene I do suggest this. Slow build ups are my favorite <3 Great job.",1437350400,23,827,4.2405063291139244
7229794,3,B00YQTDJ40,Despite bad reviews I decided to watch it. It just went alone as though there were no climaxes.  SPOILER ALERT: The characters got together in the last few minutes of the movie which made me very mad. It gets good at the end in the last 15-20 minutes. Really? I just needed the YouTube clip and I could save $4.32.  If you are looking for something to watch and you don't have all day. Don't watch this.

7229839,5,B00YQTDJ40,"I've watched this movie 10 times now, and can't seem to get enough of it.  Great movie!  I love this movie so much, I own 2 copies.  The movie is slow, so give it time to build its story.  But the ending makes it worth watching.  Touching, intimate, and happy ending.  Martin and Tomaz, two very attractive boys, have been close friends since childhood.  In this movie, they finally both discover each other,  Their true feelings, and at the end, they explore their new feelings in a very intimate and sexual way.  It took the entire movie to build the 2 main characters and to build the plot, but the ending made the movie worth it.  The ending was very positive, and it was a door way that opened to a new phase in their relationship. The sexual scenes at the end were not over done, nor, were they lacking, but just perfect.  Icing on the cake.  I was very pleased.  There is a song done in video format around 39 minutes into the film, Xingu - Beira Mar (NoPorn), that is so up beat and erotic.  Check out the song on YouTube.  When I watch this movie, I end up playing that song at high sound levels, multiple times.  Very up beat.  very hot.  The movie: Definitely worth seeing it again, and again.",1449187200,3,1204,4.299107142857143
7229840,4,B00YQTDJ40,"A coming-of-age gay movie that admittedly travels familiar ground, but does so with great, naturalistic acting from an appealing cast (especially the two young protagonists), with a spare but still involving storyline, and with visual and audio effects that truly evoke the feeling of being by the ocean, even though the actual ocean is not often seen.  The film is sincere without being saccharine, and it seems to me to do a commendable job of highlighting the difference between living life authentically and in the swim of things vs. living life by just observing life from the shore.  It may not be a completely original tale, but it is eminently worth watching...and, in my opinion, worth watching again in the future.",1448668800,2,724,4.975206611570248
7229841,5,B00YQTDJ40,Such a lovely and beautiful film!,1446681600,,33,4.666666666666667
7229842,4,B00YQTDJ40,"Yes, it has minor flaws and some heavy-handed stuff, but in the main it is a slowly developing tale of a friendship between two young men that is suffering a bit from one taking the other a bit too much for granted and the other not being trustful enough to be forthcoming.  When Martin has his moment of truth and realizes what his friend is and what his own failures are, the story moves smoothly and insightfully to its conclusion.  Their real concern for one another ends in a deeply affectionate night of love-making, and, in the morning, Martin reasserts his own basic courage to be his more authentic self.

In a way, the story has as an underlying theme something resembling the Pinocchio fairly tale of a wooden puppet and an ever-patient ""blue-haired fairy.""  If only honesty and selfless love emerge, Pinocchio will become a real boy.  Martin is led astray by his own fear of a heavy-handed father and the legacy of fear to be himself that it has left including a fear of the sea that never quite stops sounding along that chilly beach in southern Brazil. He hasn't cared for those whom he should care about and he hasn't felt the feelings he really has.  And his friends, like Pinocchio's companions, are hardly helpful.

Tomaz, amusingly enough, has his hair dyed blue during the course of a crass adolescent party during which he won't abandon his friend and in which Martin simply isn't the understanding friend he should be.  At the turning point, Martin recovers himself and Tomaz reveals himself for the friend he has always been.  As the Daniel Johnston rock piece blaring out in the car would have it, ""My Life is Beginning All Over Again.""  Their friendship and Martin's life do need to start all over again.  Yes, the young film-makers slip up and are a little obvious here and there, but the sweet sincerity of the film and the natural acting qualities of the two male leads make up for that.

If viewers want a film that shows a straight boy turning gay thanks to True Love or a ""Slam! Bang! Thank you, Man"" or a painful sermon on the horrors of homophobia, they'll find none of that in this film.  And if sub-titles that don't quite capture the dialogue do  turn people off because ""documento"" or something else isn't translated as ""legal statement involving the property rights to a piece of real estate such as a house,"" then they should turn to a piece that's more ""action"" or ""message"" than it is a gentle ""coming of age"" story developed by shifting moods rather than frenetic motion.

Lgbtq films can be a bit too closely calculated to match the market and pick up prizes at obscure festivals, but this one has a nice, uncalculated ""these were our lives"" effect and might just hang around as a quiet little classic.

I gave it four stars because of young film maker glitches, but I liked it five stars worth.",1443139200,6,2838,4.59009900990099

Everyone complaining about how boring and pointless the beginning is must either have 5 minute attention spans or expect a roller coaster ride out of every movie they watch.

7229868,3,B00YQTDJ40,"The movie was ok. The acting was satisfactory, and the actors believable, but the plot was too bare and they weren't given much to work with. The point of the trip was to procure ""the document"", yet it was never explained. That Martin's father sent him instead of going himself was made into an ""issue"", and again that was never explained. The first 70% of the movie could be edited to 10 minutes, tacked onto the remaining 30% and nothing would be lost story wise. Indie films are given too much leeway by some people since they aren't ""Hollywood blockbusters""  when most of the movies out of Hollywood aren't blockbusters either. It costs no more to write a good script than a bad one. One of the obvious cost savings was the cameraman who couldn't focus or frame a shot. I couldn't even tell if Martin and Tomaz were chain smoking teens or college kids other than a sense they were under drinking age for whatever country they live in. A much better script with more explanation would have made this a great little movie.",1441584000,2,1024,4.535135135135135

7229870,5,B00YQTDJ40,"This film is deeply affecting and rewards close attention.

Martin and Tomaz have been friends since they were kids, but lately Tomaz has been away at school so they haven't seen much of each other. The main story of ""Seashore"" encompasses a weekend trip that the two boys take together following the death of Martin's grandfather, to the seashore town where Martin has been sent by his father to collect an unspecified document (most likely an inheritance) from his widowed grandmother. It is Tomaz who will be driving him there, and over the three nights of this important mission the bond between the two boys changes in unexpected ways.

An unhappy episode in Martin's childhood has left him afraid of the ocean, and he hasn't been back to his family's vacation home in over a decade. The errand for his father troubles him, and this is one reason why his good friend Tomaz has gone so far as to skip a family wedding so he can be at his side to support him. On the night that they arrive in the seaside town they wander the deserted streets, joking with one another and making mischief. All seems fairly standard -- two young guys, lifelong friends, goofing off as they look for ways to dispel the boredom of the off-season.

On their second night, after Martin's first (and failed) attempt to carry out his father's orders, the two boys party with friends. There is much drinking and laughter along with a bit of Truth Or Dare and dancing. Each boy pairs off with a girl -- albeit with notably different results. Later, with Tomaz asleep in bed and the guests now gone, Martin spots the sketchbook that Tomaz has been scribbling in throughout the trip. Tomaz has been guarding the sketchbook closely, unwilling to share its contents, so Martin takes the opportunity to see what's inside. A glimpse through its pages leads to a revelation about Tomaz that brings Martin to see him with completely new eyes.

At first we're not sure how Martin is going to react to this new insight, but it clearly preoccupies him and he wastes no time in pursuing an understanding. Later that same day (after another visit to his grandmother) he walks with Tomaz to a quiet, remote spot in the countryside, to what looks like an abandoned house foundation in the middle of a big, overgrown field. This is a place where Martin's grandfather brought him as a child, and it's a spot where he and Tomaz can be alone together. Initially what ensues is small talk, but Martin has another goal in mind, and it's not long before he lets on to Tomaz what he has learned about him the previous night.

The way in which this pivotal scene unfolds is beautifully written and acted, with silences conveying as much as words. From the moment Martin ""goes there"" with his questions, Tomaz withdraws, his eyes downcast as he speaks, and although Martin's the one asking all the questions he seems anxious too. Nonetheless, he quietly persists. Why hasn't Tomaz ever shared this part of his life with him? Does he have a boyfriend? How long have they been together? Tomaz answers each question honestly but he's still looking down at the ground, his voice muted. When he eventually tells Martin that he and this other boy have been dating for three weeks, Martin's verdict is simple: ""Cool.""

At this point the tension breaks. Surprised by Martin's acceptance, Tomaz can look his friend in the eye again, and both boys visibly relax. There's still a little awkwardness they each process the moment, but from this point we realize that things are going to be okay.

This is just one example of how, throughout the film, we see how caring the two boys are for one another. Theirs is a rare friendship. Tomaz offers constant encouragement and reassurance as Martin struggles to complete his mission and contend with his stormy relationship with his father, and Martin is compassionate and respectful as he gently confronts Tomaz about this other aspect of his life, making sure to let him know that no matter what, he's a ""great guy"".

Yet even with all the answers he's pulled from Tomaz, Martin remains determined and curious. As he and Tomaz settle in for their final night at the vacation house, his questions, now much more playful, become more personal too. When did Tomaz know that he liked other boys? How does it feel to kiss another guy? Martin even jokes about the attraction that Tomaz might have for *him*, and Tomaz jokes right back. (It's certainly a change from earlier in the day, when they'd both been so nervous! In fact, until now we haven't seen a spark as bright as this between them.) Finally, as the laughter subsides and an uneasy silence falls over them, Martin acts to take the initiative. From there things progress unexpectedly, culminating in one of the most tender love scenes you will see in any movie. The complete and absolute way in which each boy surrenders to the other makes us wonder if maybe this is something they've both been inclined to, for quite a while.

""Seashore"" stayed with me for such a long time afterward that I had to ask myself why. I've seen dozens, maybe hundreds of LGBT movies that explore the same territory. What was it about this one that touched me so? What I realized is that the big difference was the love scene at the end (and what else could you call it if not a love scene) and how it provides a dazzling culmination of everything that comes before it. In ""Seashore"" we're given the time to experience what an incredible friendship these two boys have long before things get physical, and when the passion finally does ignite it is so spontaneous, and comes so soon after Martin has learned the truth about Tomaz, that it can only mean that they've both realized that this is the connection that's been missing from their relationship. Indeed, the feeling is so mutual that once they get going there's not so much as a word spoken between them. Martin swoops in, their lips touch for the first time, and it's off to the races -- not a second of hesitation, no checking in for reassurance, no pause to ask ""Are you sure you're okay with this?"" -- just immediate and complete rapture. What could be more romantic? The fact that it is depicted so exquisitely, with so much emphasis on how the boys gaze into each other's eyes and always return to their kissing (all that kissing!), is what makes this scene -- and this movie -- so unforgettable.

The final moments of the film may seem puzzling at first but I think what they convey is the breakthrough effect that the intimacy with Tomaz has had on Martin. No longer afraid of the ocean, he awakens the next morning to take it on directly, walking out into the crashing surf and diving into the waves for the first time since he was a kid. Remarkably, the framing of one of the final shots echoes one of the sketches that he saw in Tomaz's sketchbook.

Small details stand out in the way they enrich the story:

- Martin's glance out the window of his grandmother's house where he can see Tomaz devotedly waiting for him outside the gate.
- When Tomaz is showering in the bathroom, the way Martin's eyes begin to wander after he drops off a towel.
- The restrained but knowing reaction of Natalia, Tomaz's friend from school, when Martin speculates to her about which of the girls at the party Tomaz could be most interested in.
- Martin's skittish, wary look when he's first building up the courage to ask Tomaz about his ""boyfriend"" -- preparing to speak the one word he knows will cross the line to reveal everything he's learned, possibly changing their friendship forever.
- On their last night alone in the house, Tomaz's nervous laughter as the moment builds and Martin sits ever closer to him, his questions more probing and his intentions unclear.
- The stark contrast between the boys' passion at the end of the film and their awkward avoidance of one another in the closet just one night earlier, during their ""two minutes in heaven"" while playing Truth Or Dare.
- The symbolism of Tomaz's blue hair in light of the blue flag in Martin's childhood story: ""Lost child found"".
- The way the two boys affectionately rub noses as they kiss.
- The fact that their coupling isn't fueled by alcohol or any other substance.

The manner in which ""Seashore"" brings these two lifelong friends together in the final act reminded me a little of ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"", with the huge difference that in ""Seashore"" both boys go into the situation knowingly and lovingly and (of course) without a woman to compete over. More importantly, the regard that Tomaz and Martin have for each other is so open and unconditional that unlike that other film you're left with the feeling that their physical connection will only strengthen their bond, taking their relationship to another level entirely.

Overall, with its quiet and complete lack of angsty drama, ""Seashore"" delivers a refreshingly modern take on gay ""coming out"" cinema. For some it may be frustrating that everything isn't spelled out, but if you're patient and watch closely this film will bring you a uniquely memorable experience.",1440892800,36,9069,4.674185463659148
