Then when I found this film on Amazon I think she is a better actress than most realize. Watch this film and I think you will agree!!  Thanks again Amazon for another blast from the past.",1404259200,,334,4.138461538461539
3153507,4,B001675YQQ,"Well, I was shocked! I liked this. tough girl steals cars for a living and well, one night she steals a 1966 beauty from a killer and he really wants it back. Different movie with a lot of good fun and violence. big criticism...the so-called car chase scenes, looks like they were done on scooters, very boring. the upside, Taryn Manning, was very convincing (til the end), the cop who falls for her and believes in her, I think is Romano Orzari, he is handsome as hell and very sweet and does a terrific job. The bad guy? Perfect choice in Christian Campbell (Trick), he has that trust me thing going on, the very cute innocent face and he is so menacing. He scared the crap out of me. The supporting cast works too. My other problem is the end and that wasn't necessary what she did. Just tweeked the movie in the wrong. But overall a fun trip.",1396137600,,846,4.327044025157233

3153509,1,B001675YQQ,"The only good thing about this Movie(I purchased it at Big Lots for $3 and feel ripped off)Banshee is the car in some aspect(I am not An Mopar Fan,It's an 66' Dodge Charger.)The Plot is original at least,but it's boring and dull and the Actress is so annoying(No I never saw Hustle & Flow nor do I care for it.).It was made in Canada which says alot although the credits there is an Dedication which makes me feel bad about giving it one star,But The movie is awful,and trailers going in one about The Taxi in the middle east(Boo hoo America is Bad.)started me with an bad taste,but once into the movie even without said trailer I could not wait for it be over sadly.",1363824000,,667,4.344
3153510,5,B001675YQQ,"Very happy that Amazon.com stocked this item since it was hard to find! My wife saw this movie on the Oxygen Network when she was staying in Atlanta for business and wanted me to see it since part of the plot was ""DJ"" related... and once again Amazon impresses because they were the ONLY one's who had it in stock!!!

3153511,5,B001675YQQ,"My sister showed me this little movie that she discovered. I was surprised that it was actually alot of fun and entertaining. Although it's not a big budget picture, the story and script draw you in, the acting is quite good. It drags a tiny bit, but the leading lady kicks butt as the 'anti-hero' character. At the end, it almost had the feeling of a long pilot for a TV series and you wish you could come back next week to see the continuing adventures of Banshee!",1230336000,7,466,4.306818181818182
3153512,4,B001675YQQ,"A serial killer and a car thief interact in this semi-horror thriller.
It has action, suspense and a really baby doll voiced
star who does very good martial arts without toys, but
she polishes off a fellow with a sledge hammer.
The car chases are nice. Stunts are pretty good
and the acting is better than ordinary.
For an action movie that makes it worth the time.",1209686400,12,365,4.462686567164179

8261370,2,B001675YQQ,"While I wanted to like this movie and I really do love Taryn Manning, this one is slow, the timing is way off so you are always aware your watching a less than exciting movie, the roles played by the cops are just plain weird, the screenplay is so far from reality that this movie never seems to fall within any category, i.e., comedy, drama, adventure, spoof or ???

I do love the Banshee series though.

Taryn Manning's talent is better used in better quality movies than this stinker. She's great in Orange is the New Black.",1484524800,,527,4.422680412371134

8261375,4,B001675YQQ,"Taryn Manning (Hustle & Flow, 8 Mile) is Banshee, a sexy, streetwise punk in a high-speed action thriller from the director of Zebra Lounge. Banshee can throw a mean hook and pull off some petty crimes without a hitch, but now she's in over her head. She stole a vintage sports car from the wrong guy  who is also a serial killer (Christian Campbell, Malibu Shores) with a penchant for recording screams and Banshee is next on his list.",1432166400,,436,4.518987341772152
