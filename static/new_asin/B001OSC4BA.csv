3736040,2,B001OSC4BA,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it just isn't that good.  Some of the dialogue was very good and funny, especially the banter between the best friends.  But overall, the movie had a sad and depressing look and feel to it.  Hopefully, this isn't the way most LA twentysomethings live their lives.
Also, I didn't feel that anything was resolved by the end of the film: it just stopped.  No happy ending here.
If you're into low budget and depressing movies, this one is for you.  If you're looking for an entertaining, feel good, romantic comedy, this is definitely not for you.",1238889600,15,584,4.576923076923077
3736041,5,B001OSC4BA,"""Holding Trevor"" was a very realistic movie, about HIV, co-dependency, love, and ultimately how we have the power to change. I really enjoyed watching this movie, it put a lot of things in a new light for me. I loved Trevor and his idiosyncratic quirks. Sometimes in life everything isn't set in stone, and you really don't know which way to go. And in order to change you have to let go of the things holding you back. ""Holding Trevor"" was a beautiful coming of age film, and I adamantly believe it depicted life as a gay person. The movie didn't have a cliche ""everything's going to be amazing"" ending, but over all I think it did the film justice. But for being a low budget film I adored it. Trevor actively took hold of his future and changed for the better. Five star rating! Again, I loved the film.",1294790400,,806,4.38
3736042,3,B001OSC4BA,"My boyfriend and I stumbeled onto this film and decided to give it a try. While we really enjoyed it we found it a tad dry and underdeveloped. But as far a gay cinama goes it was classy and clean, compared to some of the racy trash that REALLY sends the wrong message. It's theme of love as an emotion not as a physical act is very endearing. Id recamend it as a rental not as a purchase.",1292544000,,388,3.9871794871794872
3736043,5,B001OSC4BA,"For sure the movie is good, actors above the average of the indie movies, setting and all well planned, even if it's clear that this was a tight budget movie. Even the actors are right for their role, Brent Gorski cute enough to be realistic in his role of man with possibilities trapped in something too small for him, Jay Brannan almost ethereal and out of the world, Eli Kranski a perfect dream date, kind, worried and so stunningly beatiful.

The movie is also eye catching, giving enough man candies to please the fans (as the offical pictures from the set prove) but the prettiness is only a bonus on the story. The oddity is that, even if I applaud to the originality of the script, I found it a bit sad: even if Trevor will be a better man in the end, even if he found the courage to claim back his life, I would have not minded if the happy end was a bit more romantic, more comedy than drama, but in a way or the other, it was at least romance.",1284249600,,954,4.184782608695652
3736044,2,B001OSC4BA,"Well, I just stopped watching this film, or shall I say a part of it. It was 34 minute of it and I couldn't go any further.
To watch it till the end, you will have to take prozac or sth. The acting is not so bad bad bad, but the action is nothing.
Definitely a piece for the fans of alternative stuff.",1282521600,,301,3.7936507936507935
3736045,3,B001OSC4BA,"So I don't know about this movie a few other reviewers mentioned that nothing was resolved and I have to agree.  Im going to be 31 next month so my 20s weren't too long ago and these characters were pretty accurate.  When you are in your 20s you are supposed to be all over the place, figuring yourself out, but preferably getting a college education in the process so that by the time you hit 30, you at least have something to put on a resume besides a couple of crappy dead end jobs. But NE way, yeah... so nothing was solved because (SPOILER ALERT) Trever quit his job. WHAT THE HELL FOR? If I were Trevor I would been on that plane faster than you can say Steven Slater.  I thought Trevor was a cutie and Ephram was just WOW! Im going to buy the movie mostly for the eye candy. I just didn't like the lack the emotional drama when (Spoiler Alert) Daryl died. What the hell was Jay doing for a living -was he a prostitute?  Yeah alot of holes in the story, I thought the acting was good, not over the top at all, but instead not over the top enough.  I would recommend this movie, perhaps not for purchase but at least netflix it, its worth watching for a number of reasons.",1282435200,,1178,4.171806167400881
3736046,3,B001OSC4BA,"I was quite surprised by this movie. The characters were quirky and fun in their own individual ways. Whilst the story is quite well known in its love lost and love found premise, it is unusual in its execution thereof. The familiarity of loving someone who seems to be determined to self-destruct is a well known theme, but in this case is executed within a complex story of self-discovery. The careful exploration of the central characters motivations, thought processes and personal choices is very well done by relying on excellent supporting characters and a strong script. His decisions whilst frustrating at times, are easy to understand. We have all been there at one time in our lives.

The final decision undertaken by the main character however, has the potential of driving one to frustration, if not confusion. It is no Hollywood ending, and seems more reminiscent of the raw angst one finds in Art cinema. Jay Brannan is perversely annoying in his fickleness in that you delight in its crass condescension, and it takes some time getting used to his character. Towards the end of the movie you understand him and his motivations, making his choices both understandable and perhaps even attractive. My only criticism of this movie is that insufficient attention is given to the influence and impact of loving someone with a destructive drug habit, but retains his ability to manipulate and coerce the love and feelings birthed in one's first love. This story within a story could have been better executed, and had the potential of making this a much better movie.",1277251200,,1577,4.950943396226415
3736047,2,B001OSC4BA,"The authors of the movie certainly had a lot of good intentions. The screenplay touches upon a number of serious issues - drugs, AIDS, betrayal, responsibility, relationships, friendship etc. The cast is generally acceptable. However, they apparently forgot that movie-making requires a little more.
Let's start from the basics - sound recording should allow the audience to understand what is being said on the screen instead of giving a perfect opportunity to listen to wind in the trees and other background noises. It is not enough to have wonderfully white teeth to be an actor. A clear story line also helps. I must confess that I felt a little lost while watching the movie.
This is an indy gay drama aimed mostly at fans of indy gay cinema. If you expect anything more, you may be unpleasantly surprised. On a second thought - even if you are a fan of indy gay cinema you may be rather disappointed. There is a lot of good intentions here but somehow very little comes out of them.",1266192000,3,989,4.689655172413793
3736048,5,B001OSC4BA,"Holding Trevor seems to be something that's impossible to do. Trevor, played brilliantly by Brent Gorski, is a puppy-dog eyed twentysomething, with an overwhelming fear of commitment. He meets Ephram, a handsome intern, at a really awkward stage in his life. Trevor has just ended a relationship with a guy who was an addict with suicidal tendencies. The only thing that had been keeping them together was Trevor's pity for this adorable loser. Trevor is also fighting an identity crisis of sorts. With no stable relationships in his life, except those with a few friends, and no meaningful career or personal goals, Trevor is feeling lost and insecure.

Trevor's best friend, Jake, played by the amazing Jay Brannan, takes life much less seriously. Jake is supportive of any decisions Trevor makes, and buoys his spirits when he's down, with humour and the kind of teasing sarcasm that only best friends can share. But ultimately Jake is unable to do much besides watch impotently as Trevor struggles with his life and his demons. Meanwhile Ephram is falling madly in love with Trevor, and is growing frustrated that Trevor is unable to return his affection.

The end is something of a disappointment, and a triumph, as Trevor is finally able to release some of the ghosts in his past that have held him back, and sadly bids farewell to Ephram, who must reluctantly go on with his own life without Trevor at his side.

This isn't a fast paced action movie. Nor is it wildly funny or romantic. It has a somewhat pedantic pace, and every scene is packed with restrained emotion and repressed desires. You have to sort of study this movie to derive it's full meaning. It isn't handed to you in a neat, simple package. But it's well worth watching more than once.

Allow me for a moment to gush over Jay Brannan. He is a ridiculously talented musician and actor. His lyrics convey an often morbidly depressed spirit. But the true Jay Brannan is a pale skinned beauty with a sexy smile and an astonishing sense of humour. Unfortunately there's not a lot of Jay's music showcased in this movie. But just seeing him makes ""Holding Trevor"" a movie you'll enjoy watching.",1263427200,5,2163,4.775401069518717
3736049,4,B001OSC4BA,A second coming of age with a twist. Good emotional content and a sub-plot regarding the need for HIV testing for all sexually active people. And who can resist Trevor becoming authentic before becoming a partner?,1254960000,,213,4.944444444444445
3736050,4,B001OSC4BA,Holding Trevor is a good way to spend a couple of hours. It provides both drama and comedy and the interactions between the characters are excellent. Good acting and production values make this film a good choice for an evening of entertainment.,1254528000,,245,4.857142857142857
3736051,5,B001OSC4BA,"I'm learning not to underestimate young writers/actors.  Brent Gorski doesn't disappoint in either role.

Holding Trevor is the story of many lives and many issues.  Complicated, yet simple.  Simple, yet complicated.

Many of us know all too well how we can be drawn to people who need help even when we know deep down our help is not wanted and not working.  It is sometimes the person offering the help who is truly in need of being needed.  That seems to be the case with Trevor and Darrell.

Ephram comes along and messes everything up.  The announced that Ephram loves Trevor is what the audience needs for Trevor but it turns Trevor's world upside down.

This film has neither the look or feel of something low budget.

I would have offered a much different ending, but I'll hold out for the sequel if Brent Gorski would bless us with that!",1246060800,2,846,4.573333333333333
3736052,5,B001OSC4BA,"Holding Trevor is really a great movie. The character Trevor is caught up in a horrible relationship with drug addicted Darrell, and finally meets Ephram, a medical intern, who falls in love with him almost immediately. Their romance takes off on a beautiful future when suddenly Trevor has to give it up to stay and be with his friend and roommate Andie, who has just found out that she is HIV positive. Trevor has a big heart, and all of his friends and his new love Ephram, truly love him for who he is! The stress and difficult times hit Trevor hard, but he keeps moving forward and doesn't look back. A great movie!",1245024000,2,620,4.447368421052632
3736053,3,B001OSC4BA,"Trevor is an intelligent, sweet twentysomething gay boy in L.A., working in a dead-end job as a answering service operator, sharing an apartment with a straight female roommate, and devoting too much time to a co-dependent relationship with an ex, a drug addict. His best friend Jake (Jay Brannan from ""Shortbus"") is pushing Trevor to move on, and is happy when his pal meets Ephram (Eli Kranski), a hunky medical intern who seems to be genuinely in love with him.  Ultimately, Trevor realizes his life is perpetually ""on hold,"" and he needs to be the one to effect the changes he knows need to be made.

Kind of a preachy vanity project for writer/producer/star Brent Gorski, but saved somewhat by genuinely likeable characters who support each other emotionally, with noticeable but minimal overacting.  Well made, considering the low budget, and could be a boost for others who feel they need to make changes in their lives. A 2007 film made for Here! TV, and occasionally on their On-Demand schedule.  DVD extras include only a theatrical trailer and stills.  I give it three stars out of five.",1243987200,7,1098,4.881720430107527

3736055,2,B001OSC4BA,"This should have been a great movie.  It has good, even very good actors with at least an A- storyline.  It creates what could have been complex and dynamic relationships between our lead characters.  And then it limps from start to finish.  Some nice moments between our lovers, and that's about it.  Except for the romantic leads the rest of the relationships in the film don't develop much depth or feeling, and the ending is thin and disappointing.  Wanted to like this film.  Gave it away once I was done.",1241308800,9,510,4.6

3736057,1,B001OSC4BA,"Maybe it's because I had just seen Summer Storm, which is an amazing movie, that I was beyond turned off by this cold, boring garbage. I couldn't help but feel so annoyed with each character. Everyone was cold, superficial, sarcastic, mean and boring. I couldn't connect with anyone in this movie, and if there's no one to relate to or sympathasize with, that's never a good thing. Everything about this movie was terrible to mediocre. I mean, I can see what they tried to capture, but they failed miserably. Some people just know how to execute something remarkably well. These people didn't. I will admit, there were one or two scenes I (shockingly) blurted out a laugh, but those few scenes do not save this movie. Sorry. Go see Summer Storm. Trust me. THEY know what they're doing. The directing, the cinematography, the acting; everything, it all snatches you and brings you into the film and you feel for everyone and everything. That's what a film is supposed to do... AVOID Holding Trevor at all costs!",1239840000,5,1010,4.744318181818182
3736058,3,B001OSC4BA,"Trevor Holden (writer-actor Brent Gorski) works for a telephone answering service in Los Angeles.  To make ends meet, he rooms with a woman, Andie (Melissa Searing).  His best friend is a singer, Jake (Jay Brannan, Ceth of Shortbus), who hides his feelings behind cutting language.  Trevor provides emotional support for an ex-boyfriend, Darrell (Christopher Wyllie), who is hooked on heroin.  Trevor is going nowhere and is too numb to know it.

Visiting Darrell in the hospital, Trevor meets an intern, Dr. Ephram Cohen (Eli Kranski), who says that Darrell will pull through.  When Ephram approaches Trevor at a party, the two of them get closer.

After several months, Ephram says he has a job offer from a hospital in New York.  It would be a big step up, and Ephram would get to be closer to his parents.  Ephram says he will not take the offer unless Trevor goes along.

Ephram will be making big money, Ephram is a good looker, Ephram has social skills, and Ephram says he loves Trevor.

Trevor has a lousy job, no family, and friends who seem to give him a hard time.

On the surface it is an easy choice.

The film does not get explicit, but notice that there is no vision of what Trevor is to do in New York.  A medical resident has long, irregular hours.  Ephram will be bounced around at the hospital and will be wanting to spend time with his parents.  How can he be sure Trevor is available when small patches of free time arise?  There is no discussion of Trevor getting a job or going to school.  There is no mention of domestic partnership or marriage.  Is it fair to think that Trevor would be a kept houseboy for as long as the doctor finds it convenient?  How well-off would Trevor be if the party ended?  Did Ephram pick Trevor because Trevor was a proven doormat for Darrell?

Combine this observation with Ephram's behavior regarding tickling, managing conversations, and not telling the truth on the timing of the decision to take the job in New York, and maybe there is a case going the other way.  Would it just be another nothing job for Trevor but in opulent surroundings?

Trevor has to compare his present in Los Angeles with a future in New York.  Will he speak up for himself?  Will he choose?  Will he live happily ever after or kick himself?  Watch and see.

The mechanics of the production were good.  The acting of the main characters was fine.  Trevor, Jake, Darrell, and Ephram all give good skin shots.  The extras are a photo gallery, a trailer, and five other Here! trailers.

The audience has to work a bit at intuiting reasons why the characters continue to like each other as much as they do.

This is a summer movie that explores people trapped in dead-end situations and how some of them get to consider using new relationships to reinvent themselves.  There is plenty of humor, but the issues are real.",1239753600,5,2849,4.563241106719367

A third of the movie is silly montages with musical background.  I guess they had writer's block and figured they could just mime their way through it.

Also, as another reviewer mentioned, none of the characters are likable. The protagonist is an immature, selfish baby....and his teeth...well they were a bit scary. His female roommate is a passive aggressive chick who becomes even more cold and angry when dealing with her HIV positive status...but won't tell anyone. The best friend is your typical bitchy queen. And the new love interest is boring...and comes on strong like a lesbian and has no sense of appropriateness.

8331310,4,B001OSC4BA,"A small film about love but though it is interesting, there are many shortcomings.

The first one is that there are a greaT number of scenes in very dark atmosphere, I mean lacking lighting and that creates a sombre atmosphere that is not in touch with the subject.

The second is that Trevor's psychology is not very constructive. He seems to be going through a rejection phase. He has made a choice and that choice turns sour. So he rejects everything and everyone when he is most needed and as if he had no responsibility in what is happening around him. In other words he is an escapist.

One of his friend and, ex-boyfriend, is on drugs and Trevor is satisfied with knowing that he is on methadone and he does not want to have anything to do with him any more, and he is brutal about it. His brutality ruins the party of his female room mate and he does not seem to give a damn and he even insults this room mate when she protests.

Another shortcoming is the fact that the gay scene, and more widely the young people's sex scene is seen as being intertwined with binge drinking and drug addiction, with irresponsibility in such states that makes you take risks and play it bareback instead of safe. It is the female room mate who falls in that trap and she gets HIV positive of course. Slightly superficial and easy and hardly pedagogical about the problem.

Trevor insists, even too much, on his father as a negative castrator and depriver and frustrater, etc, that forced him all the time to leave what he liked behind and yet this father is magically regenerated when it is needed with a sentence that is more than surprising: when you go away you don't have to leave things behind, or something like that. And he feels justified to go away from Los Angeles to New York with his lover who might be a life affair and leave behind without one thought about it all those who were his friends, shared his life and helped him in many ways to be what he is and even to meet his new and maybe lasting love of his, the doctor taking care of his drug addicted ex-boyfriend.

It is in a way an interesting romance, but it is less shiny and beautiful than it should be. It is based too much on cutting off branches, pruning off limbs. One cannot live with no recollections of and no connections with one's past. That's either purely egotistic, and then love is a sham, or it is in many ways leading to schizophrenia and that is a shame.
