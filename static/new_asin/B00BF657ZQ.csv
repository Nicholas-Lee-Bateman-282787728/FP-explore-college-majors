5613328,5,B00BF657ZQ,Esther is one of my favorite stories of the Old Testament and this film tells the story very well. I recommend it.,1372982400,,114,4.2272727272727275
5613329,1,B00BF657ZQ,Jen lilley did a good job as Esther but the story was very far from the bible story of Esther. The story line was very loosely wirte off the story of Esther. I have seen other movie that are more ture to the really story.,1372809600,5,221,3.933333333333333
5613330,2,B00BF657ZQ,"This version of the Book of Esther was done in a very disappointing way;the writing took a lot of poetic license with the actual book of the Bible, the acting was barely professional, and the scenery was very low budget. if you want a better version of the story watch One Night with the King (2006),but most importantly read the real story in the Bible.",1371340800,19,354,4.461538461538462

5613333,3,B00BF657ZQ,A good movie for young or sheltered children. It does NOT  cover several of the issues in the real story; so much was skipped. Could have been an amazing action/adventure movie! Disappointing for me as an adult who knows the details of what really happened.,1370736000,8,257,4.711111111111111
5613334,1,B00BF657ZQ,"I didn't purchase the dvd, I watched the movie on Netflix and I'm glad I did. It would've been a huge waste of money to have bought it.
Maybe the producers only had a small budget to work with or a very limited time frame in which to complete the project. In any case I was very disappointed. If they had stayed true to the story I would have been satisfied, but they did not. Too much was left out. Esther's story spans years, not weeks or months. Even some people in the story were left out. How certain events happened were changed in this movie. The actors did a fine job but the writers need to brush up on their biblical history.",1370649600,39,635,4.170731707317073
5613335,1,B00BF657ZQ,"This version of the Book of Esther seemed more like a modern day Hollywood movie. I have ordered an older version of the movie which I have seen before. It is more biblically sound to me. I have let a friend borrow the modern day Esther movie to see what she thinks.

5613338,3,B00BF657ZQ,"3 stars because they veered off from the Bible! Idk why that bothers me so much but I truly don't think its that difficult to stick to truth! Why feel the need to change anything? More than just poetic license, now that, I can handle! Read the book of Esther, its not that long and see the comparison. The true story would have made just as good a movie!!!! The movie alone is good but its false and I seek truth. Hopefully folks are reading the word and not relying on any biblical movies for teachings ",1520294400,5,504,4.25
5613339,1,B00BF657ZQ,The people who made this movie changed the story so much it barely resembles the story of Esther in the Bible.

5613354,5,B00BF657ZQ,Beautifully edited and acted. It really brought home the story of Esther to me and made me understand an important story about a beautiful and powerful woman from the old testament. The acting was significantly more realistic than most bible movies and it stayed true to the heart of the original bible story. I highly suggest this to anyone who is trying to understand more about the story of Esther.,1493683200,,401,4.742857142857143
5613355,1,B00BF657ZQ,Is it me or has anyone else noticed the battery opperated candles and the pathetic props. Honestly it looked like a church play instead of a movie. Plus this movie was so inaccurate. For instance Esther's uncle couldn't just walk in Esther's room anytime he feel likes it. He would have been beheaded in real life. Also did anyone else notice the Italian villa for the Persian palace. Which you could tell was fake like on a computer. Overall don't waste your time watching it.,1491955200,,477,4.623529411764705

good moral wife and woman is better than beauty sex and money. At a
time when women have no idea how to be decent women friends wives or
mothers this is a good movie to reset the example.

I can't judge the movie itself because I didn't watch it. It could be amazing, I don't know. I love the fact that we are having more and more christian and biblical movies lately, but I would like MORE of them to be dubbed because not many get to the Latin American market. That would be so cool...

5613371,5,B00BF657ZQ,"I am aware that this movie had a small budget and I went into watching it knowing this already so it was entertaining in its own way when the occasional really bad acting was in there. However, the main characters such as Mordechi, Esther, King Xerxes (also the lead singer of For King and Country) did a fantastic job. They threw in a little modern day comedy (such as Judith joking about marriage being a pain) which I understand why they do it but feel it takes away from how strongly loyal women were to their husbands then. Regardless, the movie has the story down mostly accurate and I think the movie is beautiful and it is nice to see the wisdom of God portrayed through a woman in history as well as Mordechi. Between this movie and The Book of Daniel (which Netflix recently removed) I have watched the two movies more than any other movie or show on Netflix. Love them, at least for me, light hearted, innocent movies focused on Biblical aspects do a lot of good for me and I love the encouragement.",1457827200,2,1010,4.406417112299465

5613373,1,B00BF657ZQ,"This movie is the worst version of Esther I have ever seen. I could had looked beyond the cheaply designed sets and costumes, but the acting was horrendous and the mere portrayal of the story is a mockery. It makes Esther seem like a mindless, besotted young women who would marry the first man who walked through the door. Her walk before the king unsummoned? A joke, it doesnt not even make it clear nor do it justice how grave the situation was, they talk about the destruction of the jews in such a light manner you'd think it was just some gossip that was vanquished by telling it to stop. They do not do justice to Esther, Mordecai, or anyone. So glad I saw this on netflix first.... like they say never judge a book by its cover.... good thing too because the cover looks fantastic, unlike the movie itself!",1455062400,,814,4.397350993377484

Virtually all the women portrayed disrespected their husbands, something totally not true, according to the Book.

The computer generated exterior sets are atrocious and the repeated use of a photo of what appears to be an Italian villa replete with glass windows as the palace of King Xerxes is laughable. In general the acting is less than sub-par although Thaao Penghlis does a decent job as the evil antagonist, Haman, and doe-eyed soap opera regular, Jen Lilley, is pretty good as Esther. In addition, Mark Irvingsen provides some welcome comic relief as Gaspar, the flamboyant eunuch. The plot deviates from the Biblical account quite a bit so don't expect a literal adaptation. This movie may not be flashy but God's message gets through and it's more edifying than 99.9% of the trash on TV.",1417824000,,782,4.8
5613413,1,B00BF657ZQ,"29 The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law. - Deuteronomy 29:29

WHY THE ONE STAR?
I have marked it as one star although it does not do justice to the effort made (a four star effort) but nevertheless, the  reason for such a low rating is primarily the addion of a dream Mordechai had at the beginning of the movie and then when God spoke to Esther when she was praying in the middle of the movie, then I had enough.

While I understand more details are often needed for Biblical stories like this one as many are often too short and to the point missing intimate parts like dialogues between parties to reveal the heart of their characters, to draw the audience further into the movie, the director, David A.R. White however added miraculous revelations through dreams and prayer not found in the Bible.

THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TWO
Why is that important?  For two following reaasons:

One, God edits accounts of the lives of His saints for His purpose.  Sometimes leave out the private details due to irrelevance like Jesus' childhood (save when He was twelve), but at times He reveals it for relevance such as Mephibosheth's backstory as he was disabled when he was five years old, those like him are often killed, David spared him despite and gave mercy and grace despite he being in the house of Saul he kept the promise he made to his best friend who hapened to be Saul's son, and it reflected God's own grace and mercy by choosing ""...foolish things of the earth to confound the wise...""(1 Samuel 20:12-15, 2 Samuel 4:4, 9:1-8, 1 Corinthians 1:27-30)].

Two, the Bible have not ever left out any miracles of personal sugnificance to those of whom He has chosen to do His will and in relation to His will like Joseph's two dreams of his glory above all his father's tent (Genesis 37:5-10).  Esther's dream in this case is of pesonal sugnificance equalling Joseph's, that should definitely not be dismissed as a minor addition to add ""... for dramatic purposes"".

Mordechai's dream in the beginning of the movie was not a personal dream, however, his dream was about the end times relating to the Battle of Armageddon and the 2nd Advent, a miracle of even greater sugnificance that equal's Isaiah's and others, that God would have included in His written word, IF, He made Mordechai to dream it which is another detail that shoud not be dismissed as a minor detail added ""...for dramatic purposes"".

THE GRAVITY OF THE ADDITIONS
Since the dream of Mordechai's along with God speaking to her is of importance in a personal and global way, then the Director has added to the Word of God since this movie is supposed to be a Bible movie, not a product of the director's ""Artistic License"" like ""Noah"".  Not only that but lied to his audience by telling them that the Bible included such life changing details.  Not a lot of  Christians read their Bibles for whatever the reason so how will they know the facts of the story ""...for further inspiration"" when they can't easily find it?  So until they get to read the story itself, they'll continue to believe the two lies and might tell others.

CONCLUSION
Since the director added the two miraculous details that were not just details for dramatic effects, but revelation of equal magnitude in comparison to the Old Testament saints, David A.R. White's movie deserves a single star.  Now I've stopped at mid-point of the movie, what other lies he added to the movie, and are they heretcal?

BTW... Mordechai was NOT there at the presence of the King the day when Queen Vashti refused to show up nor did the king actually asked her to dance before him and his guests (Esther 1:10-12, 14-15).  Why did he added this detail?  While it is not as important as the aforementioned two, it certainly wassn't true which must have either been the attempt to explain how Esther was chosen or simply due to the fact that the director assumed or forgotten the absence of Mordechai and never checked the scripture.

As to why Mr White added the two: the prophetic dream and God speaking, the first in my opinion he wanted to make it fantastically relevant to Christians but as for the second I have no idea, maybe he's trying to make her as every bit of an Old and New Testament saint as the rest because they recieved revelations and for some reason known only to God, she didn't.  David has to answer that himself along with the dream.

If he claimed to take the Bible seriously as not just a book of usefiul morals and great tales but God's written final authority and infallible truth for Christian discernment, he'd better explain himself as to why he added extra-biblical material and not do this kind of thing again (1 John 4:1-2, 2 Timothy 2:15, 3:16-17).

5 Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.

5613418,1,B00BF657ZQ,"I don't understand why someone wants to produce a movie , name it after a book in the Bible, and then  embellish/edit/alter the true story in any way they please. Its as though the Biblical account isn't good enough.  Why pretend their production is telling the story of Esther and then totally misrepresent the true events? This film was almost laughable at times. Some of the dialogue and scenes were very amateurish. Can you imagine the Persian court clapping their hands and yelling 'yay!"" when the King declares Mordecai innocent of charges. They totally altered this account .  I would recommend instead the movie Esther from The Bible Stories series, by F. Murray Abraham. It is beautifully done, the scenes and characters are more realistic, and the story is very true to the Biblical account. One Night with the King would have been a good replacement, except  the ending was bogus, with the star of David from Esther's necklace, having almost mystical powers. That was ridiculous, especially since the star of David came to be much later in history. Don't waste your time on this movie either.",1410480000,,1103,4.882352941176471
5613419,3,B00BF657ZQ,"Though Jen Lilley portrayed Esther's courage and faithfulness to God and her people well, the movie itself was not true to the Bible.  HOWEVER, the movie WAS nice in that it did not portray any violence mentioned in the book of Esther in the Bible, making it a family-friendly movie and useful teaching tool for kids.  But not in the way you might think.

My 12 year old son and I enjoyed the movie but I recognized early on that there were many inadequacies, especially the part where God spoke audibly to Esther.  Immediately after the movie, we listened to the entire book of Esther on my son's Kindle.  Because Esther is a small book, we could easily see how Hollywood had changed and embellished the story.  Thus, The Book of Esther Movie proved to be a WONDERFUL TEACHING TOOL and I highly recommend seeing it with your kids for this reason.  But, ONLY, when you have time to both watch the movie and then listen to the entire Esther book in the Bible immediately afterwards so that it is fresh on your minds.  (Biblegateway.com or the YouVersion Bible App). The advantage of listening to it together, allows for pausing it for discussion as you recognize discrepancies.

After listening to the real Bible account from the Bible App, my son and I had an enlightening discussion about what Hollywood had left out and what Hollywood had simply made up and added to the story.  The comparison of the two, easily illustrated to my son how important it is for us to KNOW what God's Word says, and how easily the world can be deceived and influenced when they don't know the Bible.

5613420,1,B00BF657ZQ,"I really wanted to like this film but  I just couldn't. The best thing I can think is that the producers wanted to make an Esther  that young children could watch. Esther is a deep, complex and powerful story and this film did not do it justice for anyone who knows the Biblical account. The production note at the beginning of the film is just an excuse for poor literary licensing. But, when I look at it from a child's viewpoint, I can see why they took it. A child would not be bothered by the distracting, horrid, ridiculous wigs in the film. A child would overlook Jen Lilly's doe-eyed portrayal of one of the greatest Jewish women in history. This is a 1960s Disney-version of Esther. Even today's Disney wouldn't have her spending so much time wishing to get married so she can start her life. And what was that crazy ""stare into each other's eyes"" moment between Esther and the King? Let's just keep cheapening the story for older, educated viewers. Again, a child wouldn't mind that the Biblical version doesn't describe her life in those terms. A child would also overlook the cheap sets, the strange ""comic relief"" moments. The Bible's Esther has no place for comedy. It is a dramatic epic of important political and historical themes. A child also wouldn't notice that the timeline has been completely squashed into non-existence. Esther's moment before the king took months to prepare. And finally, a child would not have enough knowledge to realize when the viewer's commitment to the Biblical book has been mocked. I watched Thaao Penghlis for years on Days of Our Lives.  Maybe he will bring some of that soap actor discipline to his next Christian gigs and help these film producers improve their storylines, sets and costuming. I can't even call this movie a soap opera. It didn't suspend my disbelief enough to accept an alternative world for such an important female Biblical hero (and I was able to believe some whacky stuff could happen when Penghlis was on DOOL.)  It made me sad to think someone in this emerging and much-needed genre thought a story of a great Queen needed a good hosing down.",1407628800,2,2119,4.703504043126685

However, I was curious how they worked the ending out for more of their ""drama effects.""  The cast of characters were unknown and void in their acting skills, along with foolish talk coming from both the men and women.

If you want an accurate movie of the Book of Esther, avoid this one as well as ""One Night With the King.""

Go to the ""Bible Collection"" version. It is highly accurate and very well done.

This version took far too many liberties (for example, the King of Medo-Persia could not, by law, reverse a royal decree as is done in this movie, and Esther did not become friends with Haman's daughter. It was illegal for ANYONE to appear before the King unsummoned, not just women. This is just a sampling of historical and biblical inaccuracies. There is so much in this movie that is inaccurate, I am disappointed in Pure Flix on this one.

I expected a Christian company to do far better with a Bible account than a company owned by Ted Turner. A small budget is not an excuse for biblical inaccuracy. Turner Network Television did a far better job,

I like it for what it is, but the two-star rating is due to the inaccuracies and liberties. If you want an accurate portrayal, the Bible Collection by Turner Network Television is best.",1388016000,,1138,4.504854368932039

No where in the Bible's Esther is the word God said.  Yet throughout this film God is used.  No where in the Bible's Esther is there a direct voice from God speaking to Esther, yet that happens in this film.  In the Bible's Esther, there is no mention of this first Queen, Vasthi being a spoiled brat, yet that is how she is portrayed in this film.  This film shows Mordicai in a totally different way than the Bible describes.

This film DISTORTS the Bible's story of Esther, and in the end offers a false view of the Bible's Esther.  As a Christian that troubled me greatly.  The Bible's Esther is a wonderful story and would make a great film, it did NOT need to be distorted, altered, and revised into what this film displays.

On positive notes, the acting by Jen Lilley (Esther) and Joel Smallbone (the King) is very good.  The sets are adequate.  The filming itself, in technique is adequate.  But the other actors are just not very good at all.

If the film makers wanted to make some period piece maybe they should have just presented a fictional account, because the way the writers mangled and revised and redacted the Bible's Esther is really disappointing.  Yes, they did admit to revising the story at the beginning, but they did not say they were corrupting the Bible's wonderful account.
