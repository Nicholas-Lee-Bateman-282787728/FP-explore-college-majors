5251215,5,B00930LJ6C,Sketchiest stunt you've seen!  Travis and the gang go big!  Couldn't help but laugh at the high speed carnage these guys go through.,1353715200,,132,4.695652173913044
5251216,4,B00930LJ6C,"I'm not sure why they needed to make a film.  This was like two TV shows made into a movie, kind of boring too.",1353715200,,111,3.625
5251217,5,B00930LJ6C,"Just a flat out awesome film.  These guys define taking things to the edge.  The term Epic comes to mind as well.

To the negative reviewer....Nitro Circus is the grown up jackass, while I enjoy jackass stuff...these guys are so much more than jokes.

The action is outstanding, and equally as impressive is the way in which it was captured.

Lastly, I recommend this to just about everyone outside of very little children.  I doubt your kids will actually try anything in this film.

Easy 5 stars, I'd give it more if I could :)",1353456000,,529,4.505263157894737

5251222,5,B00930LJ6C,"No, I wouldn't recommend this film for young kids - it will just give a lot of crazy ideas to them, but for everyone else, you will be absolutely AMAZED at what these people are able to pull off. Hard to believe that there were no special effect tricks used to achieve the stunts; granted, there were a LOT of bumps and bruises along the way, I'll bet! Frankly, I wouldn't have thought a lot of the stunts were even possible, but Nitro Circus made it happen. I'm looking forward to the 3D Blu-ray version.",1351641600,2,505,4.326315789473684

5251339,4,B00930LJ6C,"These guys are crazy.  Crazy like guys who free-climb large rock walls (no protective gear), or do high-wire acts with no safety net.  This falls under the general rubric of extreme sports, but they were doing stunts nobody else wanted to try.

One of the team said he had come over from the Jackass troupe and the difference was, There, the stunts weren't really meant to work and everybody knew it.  Here, if the stunt doesnt work, sometimes it means you're dead.

They hold the world record for some obscure things, like the longest and highest jump of a semi (the cab that pulls those 18-wheelers on the freeway), or for successful double-backward circles in the air on a tricycle, landing it on its wheels.  Or vaulting through the air from the roof of one 30-story high building, across the gap onto the roof of the adjacent building (on bikes, on trikes)  That gap was not a small gap.  The distance to the ground was a long, long way.

Their crowning glory was a live performance in Las Vegas with a packed stadium.  Perhaps the most remarkable member of the troupe was a guy born with spina bifida who is permanently confined to a wheelchair.  Hed do full circles in the air in his wheelchair the way the other guys would on a trike or a dirt bike or dirt cycle.  The difference, of course, was that his lower spinal cord was already injured and that he couldn't just get up and walk away if he didn't land properly.

If you like insane sports, youll probably enjoy watching the movie.  I don't recommend the lifestyle, but do recommend the movie.",1436832000,,1556,4.510714285714286

5251373,2,B00930LJ6C,"The stunts are awesome, when they are actually doing them. Far too much time is spent interviewing tools like Rob Dyrdek or people who have absolutely nothing to do with nitro circus or extreme sports, like Channing Tatum. The interviews are all largely the same, just saying how great these guys are and how brave they are because failure means death, etc. It seems to be more a documentary on how awesome they are for doing a live show than a movie about tremendous athletes doing incredible stunts, which is what the movie was advertised as. If you are a huge fan of Nitro Circus, the movie might be worth a buy. If not, I would not recommend this movie.",1422489600,,657,4.483333333333333

I'm glad that I watched it once, but I certainly wouldn't watch it again, nor would I share it with family and friends because I have alot more interesting 3D Blu-rays to watch and share with family and friends.

I bought it used, at about a third of what it's selling for here, and I still think I wasted my money. I coulda had a cold beer instead. Oh well, I'll just take it back to the used record store and trade it in towards something else.",1417564800,,579,4.078947368421052

It is interesting to see what a group of buys (and one girl) can goad one another to attempt.  It is heartening (and a little disturbing) to see adults acting like the children they were when this friendship bond was made.

5251492,1,B00930LJ6C,I have seen every Nitro Circus and was looking foward to the movie. It was unimaginative and was kinda boring. It is more of a documentary than a movie.

5251514,5,B00930LJ6C,"I thoroughly enjoyed these nuts doing their stunts.  Which probably indicates that there is something mentally wrong with me to a psychologist!  Some of the stuff they do, hell MOST, of the stuff they do is VERY dangerous.  So while I found the show incredibly entertaining, I also hate to encourage these guys (and one girl) to keep doing this stuff, or worse yet (worse for their health) even more crazy stuff.

It's not like Jackass if you are wondering.  Jackass is about pain and torture and just stupidity for the sake of stupidity.  This show is about daring, borderline crazy, STUNTS.  While a lot of what they did on Jackass was specifically to injure themselves, the Nitro Circus is about successfully completing crazy stunts and hopefully not getting too injured.  Of course, any difficult stunt takes a lot of practice and a lot of failures before success, and this is the core of the show - showing us the 49 failed attempts before the one amazing, beautiful success.",1354147200,,980,4.757396449704142

5251520,4,B00930LJ6C,"Nitro Circus takes a group of daredevils and shows what happens when you take stunts to the absolute limits. This is truly a heart pumping ride worth taking. You'll see tri-cycles jump ramps across buildings,huge car flips,insane dirt bike jumps,buses flying across the sky,wheel chairs attempting to go through loops,and the whole time the cast takes it as if it's just another day at the office. The whole films leads up to a finale which highlights the first live Nitro Circus show in Vegas.

The 3D here is a nice supplement. The material doesn't need it,but it certainly adds to the overall experience. The movie itself is quiet a knockout,but the 3D insures you stay down for the count.

Pros: The stunts are insane here. Without a doubt it's hard to believe no one has been seriously,life crippling injured attempting any of this. Some of it is pretty funny as well.

Cons: I felt at times they took too long in between shots to get the input of celebrities and sports figures alike. The stunts themselves sell the idea and I didn't need to be reassured of it. I felt the snippets of Channing Tatum's endorsements wore thin very quickly. I also believe the ending was somewhat anti climatic. The only other gripe I would mention is that at times I felt the film was too Jack-Ass esque in delivery.

On a final note I am a little shocked at the negative reviews this film received from critics. Early Hollywood inpart, was built on a foundation of talented individuals that put their lives on the line for a few moments of celluloid glory and we remember it in celebration,shock,and awe. Nitro Circus,in a way harks back to those glory days and it's a crying shame this film is not thought of in the same category by those who get paid to give their opinion. How can they so easily forget part of movie heritage?

I not only enjoy this film for the spectacle,but I respect the crew behind it. Good job guys (and ladies).",1353801600,7,1926,4.587209302325581
