8578284,4,B00C7O8HF2,"I like the fact that they added some songs not typically done on live concert recordings.  Their performances are so enthusiastic and they always manage to add a twist to at least one of their older songs, even if just jamming on the guitars.  I have to say, though, they really don't need those dancing back-up vocalists.  Sometimes the vocalists get more attention and better mikes than John Lodge which is a real shame.",1392768000,,422,4.675675675675675
8578285,4,B00C7O8HF2,"This dvd was first released in 1995 without the cd but my Moodies OCD had it's way with me and I bought it again for the cd. The Moodies were releasing Keys of the Kingdom and played their only performance at Montreux July 3rd, 1991 which was also the festival's 25th anniversay. Justin, John, Ray and Graeme are backed by Bias Boshell, Paul Bliss, Gordon Marshall, Sue Shattock and June Boyce.

The performance is is pretty good for the era but, as with a lot of the Montreux releases, the mix leaves something to be desired. Some instruments are mixed too loud while others are barely audible. The same goes with the vocals although the mix does improve as the concert goes along. Rather than playing two sets, the band played one extra long one. A few songs that were played on this tour aren't played here as a result. The performances are pretty good despite the mix problems. One of the standout things about this release it that it's only the second official release includes Ray's flute solo with the keyboardists. The solo had developed between Ray and Patrick Moraz and had become a constant in the song until Ray's departure. For some strange and poorly planned reason, it was edited out of the Hall of Fame concert dvd and cd releases. All in all, a nice addition to your Moodies collection if you don't already have it",1390262400,2,1331,4.569037656903766

Here they are just a rock band without the magnificent sound they are capable of. The first time I saw them live they had a superior keyboard man with them, &  the performance soared. The second time a more pedestrian keyboard was better than the one on this performance, at least he was more noticeable. It is a fine group of there best songs, Video is good, but not spectacular, sound a bit tubby, at least to my ears. A nice one to have, just sorry it was not what I  hoped for.",1376956800,2,632,4.172131147540983
