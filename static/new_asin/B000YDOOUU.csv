8232195,1,B000YDOOUU,"This video would be infinitely more viewable if the narration were not drowned out by the constant, too-loud squeal of women's voices cauterwauling in the background.",1339372800,,166,5.423076923076923
8232196,1,B000YDOOUU,"I Don't know what to say... Most of the DVDs to come out of ""Reality Films"", Seem to be no more then Pretty pictures, Or One Solid Filming of A Supposed Proffessional, And voice-overs...

I don't think any less can be said about this except, is it possible to post reviews with 0 stars or less?

Again, Just my Views... Won't be buying any more of this propoganda material... Boring as all hell... Better to watch my computer's screensaver. Atleast the image in that moves...",1280620800,,475,4.576470588235294
8232197,2,B000YDOOUU,This video had some good information but nothing new for most. It was filmed so poorly that we had a hard time watching it. There were three of us trying to watch this film and we all felt the same way. The camera jumped around so much that it was making us dizzy. As if they had a child holding the camera. The video drags and we nearly turned it off. But we hoped it would get better. It really didn't. I would say save your money!,1218067200,3,433,3.9885057471264367
8232198,5,B000YDOOUU,This is a very interesting and informative look at UFO happenings including sightings and crop circles.  They were explained in a way I had not previously heard.  Very believable and detailed.  This DVD was entertaining for me even as a UFO questioner.,1206576000,,252,4.9523809523809526
8232199,4,B000YDOOUU,"Steve Mitchell's ""Dragons and Rings"" offers complex scientific theories about ancient knowledge and how it relates to unexplained phenomenon such as extraterrestrial visitors, ""crop circles"" and ""stone circles"" similar to Stonehenge. The information about ""orgone"" and ""dragon lines"" is an extraordinary concept about how humans originated.  The exploration into Quantum Theory and unexplained mysteries of the universe is notable, and it challenges many beliefs.",1205539200,,463,6.234375
8232200,5,B000YDOOUU,"Scientific facts about UFO and the paranormal realm. Before I watched this movie I had my doubts about UFO's, but this dvd definately changed my point of view!",1205020800,,159,4.714285714285714
8232201,3,B000YDOOUU,"Colorful graphics and regional photography beautifully illustrate this scientific discussion on the nature of energy and its role in paranormal phenomenon, such as crop and stone circles, ley lines, and the link to UFOs. There is a haunting soundtrack from a group called Soul Path and other artists, and a bonus music video as well.",1198627200,,333,5.072727272727272
