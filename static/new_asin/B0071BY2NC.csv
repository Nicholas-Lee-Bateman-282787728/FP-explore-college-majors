5047159,5,B0071BY2NC,"The events that occurred during Game Six of the 2011 World Series were of such historic improbability, no one would ever believed they actually took place unless they saw it with their own two eyes.  Even then, it's still hard to comprehend it really happened.  But it did, and here's the proof.

If you are a Cardinals fan, this could be your favorite piece of team history; a game so frustrating and flawed at the outset, to so heroic and perfect at the conclusion.  Over the years, I have collected a wide assortment of video, capturing great moments of Cardinals history.  After a while, it tends to get a little boring.  I could watch this particular event every day for the next 50 years, and never get tired of it.

What amazes me is no matter how often I watch it, I still feel the range of emotions I experienced that Thursday evening back in October - hope, frustration, despair - to absolute joy.  For Cardinals fans, it just doesn't get any better than this.",1338076800,10,970,4.502857142857143
5047160,5,B0071BY2NC,"The picture quality is incredible!!! I am a Tiger fan and and am telling all fans of baseball... This is a must have !!! The choice of broadcasts (Fox, KMOX, KESN and Spanish) make it a real treat. It complements the whole event perfectly. Please make room for this in your collection baseball fans !!! and it seems to be region free.",1335744000,7,334,4.403225806451613
5047161,4,B0071BY2NC,"I have not seen this BluRay yet but can't wait. I was there at Busch Stadium with my son that night and I kept thinking this is it. The Cards are done. My son, a rabid baseball fan never gave up hope. I thought he was crazy! But against all odds the Cardinals just kept coming back again and again! We screamed until we lost our voices. One of the best baseball games I've ever seen and most likely this game has to be in the Top 5 World Series games of all time. It was so un-believable to actually be there. The place was electric. And the best part was I got to experience the whole thing with my 16 year old son!",1334361600,5,616,3.975806451612903
5047162,5,B0071BY2NC,I am not a St. Louis nor a Texas Rangers fan (I'm a Mariners fan). But I agree that this game is a CLASSIC. It will go down as one of the greatest World Series games. Good job MLB for recognizing this early and putting this out.,1334102400,8,228,3.872340425531915
5047163,5,B0071BY2NC,"Of all the World Series games played during my 54 years of life, this has to be the greatest of them all. Being 10 1/2 games out of the Wild Card at the end of Aug 2011, this team pulled it together and won it all. Game 6 of the World Sreies was even more proof that team was ment to win it all. Enjoy this game to watch over and over again for years to come.",1330732800,4,359,3.675324675324675
5047164,2,B0071BY2NC,"The Cardinals Played the Texas Rangers, NOT the Houston Astros in game 6 of the 2011 World Series.  This is one of the greatest World Series games of all time, since I was there I look forward to purchasing this Blu-Ray version.",1329696000,3,228,4.428571428571429
5047175,5,B0071BY2NC,"Not much to say about this...it's the whole broadcast of one of my favorite games ever. About the only downside is that rewatching it can remind you how bland most of this game actually was. You'll probably find yourself skipping to the late innings most of the time. In fact, I'd probably still have made the purchase (and given it five stars) if it had just been the late innings.",1392681600,,382,4.4714285714285715
5047176,5,B0071BY2NC,I wanted to get a copy of what I considered one of the greatest baseball ever.  Item was as described and works well in my player.,1389052800,,130,4.0
5047177,1,B0071BY2NC,"Bought the Blue Ray/DVD combo for a gift.  The audio on the Blue Ray does not work.  Great picture, but can't hear a sound.  Contacted them days ago, but have heard back.",1386720000,,170,4.25
5047178,5,B0071BY2NC,first time i watched a blu ray dvd.  excellent picture quality  game was very exciting  will be even happier when price goes down,1382659200,,129,4.521739130434782
5047179,5,B0071BY2NC,"I eat, sleep, and breathe Cardinal baseball, and for as long as I live I don't think I'll ever forget the events of game 6 of the 2011 World Series. I sat on the couch watching the madness and impossible-ness of the game unfold before my eyes while hardly believing it. It looked like a game 7 would happen. Then it didn't. I had basically accepted defeat entering the bottom of the 9th.  When Freese tied it I texted people, called people, and danced like a fool! Then yet again had accepted defeat entering the bottom of the 10th only to watch them tie it again, and I knew deep down when Freese led off the 11th magic was about to happen.

I still can't believe what happened two years later. I get goosebumps typing this. ""Roller coaster"" doesn't begin to describe the 2011 season or this game, and thanks to this blu-ray with a beautiful HD picture I can relive it whenever I want.  The highs and lows complete with Joe Buck's ""And we will see you tomorrow night!"" Baseball heaven at its finest.",1377561600,,1000,4.394594594594595
5047180,5,B0071BY2NC,"Amidst all the drama that went into extra innings, the play-by-play should get equal billing to the effort The St. Louis Cardinals and the Texas Rangers displayed, David Freese had not only sent the St. Louis crowd into ecstasy with his 11th inning walk off home run, but he had Joe Buck honoring his late legendary father Jack who said the very same words that described that of the also deceased Kirby Puckett after Game 6 of the 1991 World Series which also lasted 11 innings:

WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW NIGHT!

And both home runs (Freeze in 2011 & Puckett in 1991) were hit fairly deep too:  Kirby hit his to deep left-center field in '91; Freeze went to deep center 20 years later.",1371513600,,683,4.491935483870968
5047181,5,B0071BY2NC,"Had the privilege to see Game 6 last fall.  43 years old - baseball fan all my life, was actually cheering for the Rangers - most incredible game I ever saw.  Electricity was in the air - rainout the night before... Ups & downs - hats off to the cardinals for pulling this one out.  I feel my heart racing thinking about the crowd, the trip - all of it.
Shopping for birthday gift for my brother....Cardinal Fan - he was two seats to my right - made perfect gift. I guess I'm somewhat rating the game and its availability.  Thanks MLB!",1347321600,,535,4.215686274509804
5047182,4,B0071BY2NC,Blue ray worked great...dvs stalled about half way through. My main access is dvd so it is a minor problem. I have to use my kid's playstation to play blue ray.,1345852800,,160,4.193548387096774
5047183,5,B0071BY2NC,"I am a Giants fan, but I definitely don't brush off other teams like some. I appreciate the players more and I honestly don't think last year's World Series was anything special. It was a great game, but not one of the greatest. I've seen better games, like the 10-run comeback by the A's that everyone ignored because it's the A's.....",1342483200,,336,4.524590163934426
5047184,5,B0071BY2NC,"This sixth game of the 2011 World Series could never have appeared as an episode on ""The Twilight Zone"". Why? Because Rod Serling would have thought it too unbelievable, he couldn't have approved the script.",1339977600,,207,4.942857142857143

8508105,5,B0071BY2NC,There was no better gift this year. They were only interested in that single game. You were the only place to find it. It arrived at the exact right moment.,1483488000,,156,4.233333333333333
8508106,5,B0071BY2NC,It was good buy and a great gift for any cardinals fan or MLB fan to enjoy,1483488000,,74,3.411764705882353

8508110,4,B0071BY2NC,A great look at Game 6 of the 2011 World Series between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Texas Rangers!,1419292800,,102,4.15
8508111,5,B0071BY2NC,One of the best World Series games ever played.  I found the drama holds even when you already know the ending.  The extra audio tracks of the game winning home run are worth the purchase price.,1414972800,,194,4.361111111111111
8508112,5,B0071BY2NC,The DVD title says it all and as a Cardinal's fan this is definitely worth buying. I was at this game and it was one of the most exciting games I have ever been to. I love to be able to watch one of the best Cardinals games of the 2000s.,1413849600,,237,3.6666666666666665
8508113,5,B0071BY2NC,"My dad and I attended game 6 of the 2011 World Series and were lucky enough to see possibly THE GREATEST game in World Series history.  The back and forth drama in this big league battle really shows how exciting the game of baseball is - when tensions are high in a tightly drawn race to the finish.  If you are a St. Louis Cardinals fan then this is a must own. The Cardinals never-say-die credo in a must win situation is what makes this game such a remarkable feat.  I recommend this blu-ray this to any baseball fan (no matter who your favorite team may be) for just the sheer exhiliration of the action and the adrenaline rush produced by watching it.  Every time I sit back and watch this game it never fails to give me chills and goose bumps.  I'm sure part of that is produced by my brain's cognitive memory response and associating it with my real-life exprerience at the game. So, I'm a bit biased but that's my opinion.",1405296000,,931,4.327586206896552
