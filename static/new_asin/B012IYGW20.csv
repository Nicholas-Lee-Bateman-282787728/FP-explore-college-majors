8726250,4,B012IYGW20,"I liked this DVD with all the different Martial Artist, but I was disappointed. I bought this DVD because it had Shihan Tony Annesia on it and was hoping to see him in action demonstrating his Martial Art skills. Well all he did was spoke on his style of Aiki-Jujitsu. I was very disappointed.",1455062400,,293,4.444444444444445
