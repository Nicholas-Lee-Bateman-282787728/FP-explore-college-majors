Unfortunately, the movie was not nearly as good as the book. I caught maybe 10 minutes of it playing late at night many years ago and had always wanted to see the movie, but it never seemed to be on anywhere. Then, they released the DVD, so I bought it. If you are a fan of the book, you may think the movie is OK, but if not, I don't think the movie would interest you. This was a very low budget movie and it just never came together. With the book, you had sub-plots and details but the movie is more or less just a story of a kid tying to make a lot of money fast. It just didn't capture the theme of the book which was that while money is nice, it is not the most important thing, nor can it solve all of your problems.",1440374400,,885,3.868131868131868
8018421,1,B0001YVVSA,"Pretty simple, this film is boring. I stuck with it and watched until the end, but no redemption whatsoever. I like many movies from this era, and am very patient with story lines. Having said that, I gave it the usual chance after chance, and even thought having Lee Grant might possibly save this one, but no. I can't think of any reason to recommend it.",1357516800,,356,4.409090909090909
