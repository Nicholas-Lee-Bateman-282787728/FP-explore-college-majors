8056018,5,B0008FXSQ0,"I really like Yoga Kickboxing.  I won't try to describe what he does or doesn't do, but I will say you will have fun doing it.  The first time I used his DVD I had trouble keeping up with his style of movements, but I had fun trying to follow along.  The dude just makes you want to keep coming back for more.  I haven't gotten bored yet using his DVD, and I've purchased a lot of other different types of workout DVDs.  Every now and then I pop in his DVD when I want to switch things up, and create new challenges for myself to get more proficient from the last time I used his DVD.  I guess I do have to mention Joshua is very aerobic in movement.  Its also very nice that he's very rhythmic and smooth in movement, and your joints don't feel like they are taking a pounding while he pushes you to get your heart rate up.  The dude is very fluent in what he does, and he delivers what he promises.  His Yoga poses, and kickboxing are very easy to get into he doesn't take them to the extreme.  Joshua moves in such a way that someone from beginner to advanced aerobic class people will all benefit from what he has to offer them. I guess what separates Joshua's workout DVD from other mainstream DVDs is he has a little bit of African dance temple feel to his DVD.",1304035200,,1267,4.1138211382113825
8056019,5,B0008FXSQ0,Feel great every time I finish this DVD.  I feel revived but my muscles still feel like they had an intense workout without the boring weights/treadmill routine.  The meditation at the end is wonderful.,1266105600,,202,4.911764705882353
8056020,5,B0008FXSQ0,This movie does not seem to help with exercising to much and the guy is very creepy.,1230681600,,84,4.0
8056021,5,B0008FXSQ0,"I have quite a few workout videos. Don't we all!!! Why? Because we all want to look like the hot man or women on the cover. Each one promises to keep us moving, pump us up and give us the perfect...something or other. Inside we find exercises done by shapely twenty-somethings who rivals the stamina and range of motion of an African Cheetah. I usually find myself sinking into the couch halfway through exercise one and then limping back to my trusty treadmill.

Joshua doesn't make those huge claims. He does say that you will sleep and feel better and his is the workout I keep coming back to. No fancy dance steps here. He stresses subtle movements well done. I wish he had made more of these. His combination of Yogic breathing and slow build to movements that don't require a background in choreography have become a central componet of my exercise program. If you are the type who gets stiff from sitting at a computer all day this will take you through a gentle range of motion before progressing to faster movements. Nothing is too hard to do and you don't have to do tons of those floor exercise that form the core of most Yoga DVD's and put both of my legs to sleep inside of 10 minutes.

If this isn't strenuous enough for you, use it as a warm up.",1229385600,2,1260,4.380341880341881
8056022,1,B0008FXSQ0,"This is such a cheesey dvd I couldn't believe it.  I was laughing.  I couldn't even finish it because it was sooo bad. It is not yoga, it is not kickboxing.  I sold it at the used book store.  If you want a respectable fusion that is not Richard Simmonesque try Cameron Shayne's Budokon.",1174608000,2,287,4.2592592592592595

The set is in blues, oranges & bamboo with a Asian temple theme in simple fabrics. The music is low in volume, basic, but fast enough with a good enough beat to keep you going.

8056024,5,B0008FXSQ0,"Yogaboxing is an invigorating flowing sequence of movements to challenge your body and refocus your mind. Joshua Isaac Smith is a master teacher who utilizes a variety of signature moves to tone and shape your entire body. His pleasant and somewhat playful style awakens the inner child, while his strength awakens the warrior. His creativity flows through exercises like the Tibetian duck and he has many animal names for the various poses and flowing sequences.

This transformational style of exercise is a combination of Tai Chi, African Dance, Yoga and Boxing. Joshua takes you from stressed and physically tense to invigorated and tingly all over. Any unreleased emotional tension fades away and is replaced by a more positive attitude. By combining active participation with positive affirmations that are reminiscent of self-defense tactics, you begin to draw on your inner power.

The smooth transitions and flowing motions create a balance between the active and passive. You will unlock energy you didn't know existed. If you love Yoga and have tried a few Boxing or Tai Chi Exercise DVDs, then you are ready for Joshua Isaac Smith. He is the next level of artistic precision. It is one thing to do a pose, stop and try another pose. It is quite another to flow from one pose to another without losing your balance. The focus on balance and breath gave me all the challenges I could wish for in a routine. I was completely challenged all while feeling very powerful.

As you work through the routine, you will draw on your inner power, develop a new sense of determination and use your breath to open and cleanse your body. The therapeutic effects of Yogaboxing are immediately apparent. If you were tired and sullen, you will be laughing and energetic after 1 hour and 16 minutes. The benefits of this exercise routine are many and as a woman, I appreciated the hip opening exercises and playful dance.

The ""inhale/exhale/release"" sequence where you breathe in and then breathe out and release all your tension is repeated and gives you a break in between other low impact exercises. This completely oxygenates your body and if you are feeling at all sluggish, it will awaken you to a new state of consciousness.

This exercise routine will be enjoyed by men or women who want to naturally stimulate their body's physical and mental energies. If you want to lower the intensity, just keep your feet on the floor during the dance segments. There are no fancy steps to learn and I was amazed at Joshua Isaac Smith's masterful teaching style. His instructions are right on target and he takes care of you and makes sure you are completely enjoying this routine.
