7983619,5,B00008G980,"The film Demasiado Amor (Too Much Love) makes proper justice to Saras Sefchovich novel. The film transports the viewer to places all around Mexico, from south to north. However, the highlight of the story is the recognition and empowerment of a womans world: its struggles, prejudices, and stereotypes.  This film was rated number one in my film and literature class.",1468800000,,367,5.116666666666666
7983620,5,B00008G980,"This film is wonderful, but every review I've read about this film misleadingly calls it a romantic comedy.  I wish that you'd watch it, but it is very heartwrenching.  I won't give the film away, but I feel that it is important to give it a true representation.

Demasiado Amor is about the more homely, naive, and earnest of two sisters.  Tired of the monotony of saving for a future dream, Laura leaves for Spain with all the sisters' savings. She will find a house that will become their bed and breakfast inn.

Beatriz stays.  She becomes a prostitute to help to cover Laura until she can find a house, set up, and send for her.  Carlos is her first john and the one she falls in love with.  I believe that they had just one night together, but Beatriz makes up a whole relationship with him as her dream lover.  All her love and devotion is with him.

She has a variety of encounters with different types of men.  But don't think that these meetings are sordid or pornographic.  She has a great time with these men and they stave off her loneliness.  She even meets a gay man who offers her a marriage of convenience.

Beatriz is three people, a sister, a prostitute, and the lover.  The only place where these three people meet is in a collage on the wall of her apartment.  During a confrontation with her sister, we realize that Laura knows about Beatriz's prostitution, but in every letter that Beatriz sends she never mentions the painful side of her life.  Laura never asks Beatriz to come to Spain.  Instead, the sisters begin sending each other video tapes of each other.

Finally Beatriz gets to a point where she can not avoid dealing with her internal struggles and she faces all of who she is.  In the end, she does not stay in Mexico, but she does not go to Spain.

You'll have to watch the film to find out what she does.",1123977600,6,1841,4.387573964497041
7983621,4,B00008G980,"Director Ernsto Rimoch has created in DEMASIADO AMOR not only a tender story about two sisters and their dreams of moving from Mexico City to Spain to buy a house that will be a Boarding Home for their future income.  Beatriz (Karina Gidi) is the less attractive of the two sisters and the more responsible one and is elected to stay in Mexico City until the Spanish house is located and bought by Laura (Ana Karina Guevara).  Beatriz sees herself as unattractive and it is only after her neighborhood flower vendor (Luisa Huertes) that she feels beautiful and can begin to look at men!  Here begins the change!  Beatriz has a chance encounter with a handsome man, Carlos (Ari Telch) in her local cafe and has a whirlwind love affair with him before he disappears.  Demands for money from Spain and from her landlord force Beatriz to do extra work and that need for money also results in other encounters with men with whom she has brief affairs (Martin Altomaro, Daniel Martinez, Paul Mendez, etc).  She is wined and dined and adored but still longs for her first love Carlos.  Meanwhile her sister Laura falls in love in Spain, marries and has two girls, and asks Beatriz to move to Spain.  But Beatriz' encounters and experiences in Mexico City override her desire to leave her beloved Mexico.  There are twists and turns that bring the story to a close, but disclosing them would be unfair.  This is beautifully photographed, sensual, dreamy little film that merits your attention.  In Spanish with English subtitles.",1080518400,6,1521,4.767175572519084
