2352221,2,B000A2UC2E,"The 2 stars is because the actying was good for a b-movie. In a way I guess.

Do not take these 4 and 5 star reviews seriousley, as this is no way a 4 or 5 star movie. And take the reviews if you like to rent this because its available everywhre, do not waste 25$ until you see it first.

This movie been summed up already so i won't bother, but it lacks in every department.

The humor is not there as these people are saying, pretty lame and didn't know this was even suppose to be funny, but I do now. The killings you don't see any part of just the blood and there is like 2 or 3 gory parts. The acting is not bad atll just ok basically like a high grade b-movie acting, which at times is very corny and stupid.

Also you get no attachment to any of the actors in this as it is an emotionless film, the actors and actress show no emotion of being scared or nervous which makes this movie even more the worse because it is hard to get into, and the couple parts at the end when they try to be serious its just not working at all. This film brings nothing that will make you get into what you are watching, very unemotional in all ways as a viwer  ex. you won't laugh , you won't cry , you won't be scared, you won't be nervous, you won't be grossed out, you won't care who lives or dies etc....

Towards the end Lieberman ( Director and Writter ) tries to bring this film to somewhat of a dramatic closing/ending and with doing so all he does is make you laugh cause nothing seems to fit in as the end is also very predictable when things happen, just makes no sense, he leaves 2 different paces to this movie, or atleast tries to.

im not going to go on and on but RENT 1ST and never buy cause this is a straight rip off and joke of a horror film, if thats even what it is. One  of the more horrible movies I have ever seen not the worst but if it wasn't for the ok acting it would have been alot worse of a movie, take my word if you choose.",1128902400,,1946,3.9213197969543145

However, movie is great. I bought this because I had previously viewed it a few times over the past decade and decided to
finally get myself a copy. I usually wait for the blu-ray - but this one only had the TV edited version made into blu-ray -
don't understand that move .... The film is family friendly if the kids are all 13 and up - too much for anyone younger.

The cat scene involves the killer smashing the cat into a piece of plywood and using the cat's body to write ""BOO"" with the
blood that oozes out ....
There is a slit throat in one scene and the killer gropes the daughter in a sexual manner, but nothing a 13 year old hasn't seen
these days ...

The movie is set during Halloween and that is the time of the year I recommend it be watched ....",1474588800,4,823,4.067901234567901
2352281,5,B000A2UC2E,"Okay, look, I'm not giving this film 5 stars because it's a masterpiece, let me say that first. I don't even think it falls into the ""so bad it's good"" category. I mean, it's got bad film qualities all over, but I still think it's a pretty good movie as a horror comedy, mainly because it is insanely entertaining! 5 stars supposedly means, ""I love it,"" and that works for me, because I really do. This movie is just pure entertainment.

I first saw ""Satan's Little Helper"" on Netflix back when I first got the service. It's no longer on there at the time I'm writing this, and Amazon says it's out of stock on DVD, but I actually got my copy recently on bluray for 3 bucks at the country's biggest brick and mortar retailer, so there ya are. Bare bones, of course, but that's fine for 3 bucks. Now, the cover image IS kinda deceptive. That is NOT Satan's Little Helper, that's the character being called Satan throughout the film (I'll explain in a minute), and they've given him small hands on the cover to make it look like he is the little helper of the film. Why confuse people I have no idea. Anyway, the story is about a little boy who constantly plays a handheld video game his father got him called ""Satan's Little Helper"". I guess they had to show us the game's graphics. Just try to not let them bug you. In this game, you play a little kid who helps Satan go around killing people for points or something. The little boy playing the game, Dougie, is not the brightest tool in the box, and he is completely obsessed with Satan and being his little helper in real-life. It's hilarious, because he acts like any little kid talking about his hero, like if it was Turbo Man in Jingle All the Way, not like  some kid obsessed with Satan for real. Anyway, it's Halloween, and as he's out in the neighborhood in his little devil costume, Dougie runs across someone he is convinced is the real Satan. It's actually a local serial killer who is setting out real dead bodies on someone's lawn as Halloween decorations. Dougie immediately befriends this completely silent, masked killer (he's the guy on the box cover) and asks to be his helper. The killer is more than happy to oblige when Dougie mentions mom and sis are at home and Dad is not. I should mention Dougie's sis, Jenna. If you don't enjoy the movie for its pure ridiculousness, just staring at her is reason enough to watch the whole thing. Katheryn Winnick not only does a fine job in the role, she's also smokin' hot, and Dougie agrees. He wants to marry his sister someday (he is a little kid and doesn't know any better yet), but she's brought home a new boyfriend, and he's just asked Satan to come home with him and kill the new boyfriend, because, well, three's a crowd, of course. This leads to lots of confusion, death, and scary (well, in theme) Halloween fun! There are a couple of odd choices just for plot that aren't quite believable [spoiler alert], like why ""Satan"" doesn't initially kill the boyfriend character when he first attacks him. Like I said, this is not a perfect movie. It's great fun though, excellent for the Halloween season especially, and Satan's actually a really cool villain most of the time, and Dougie is so entertainingly stupid. Amanda Plummer as the mom is a surprisingly recognizable face in this film, and such a bizarre character sometimes, ha. In fact, just seeing suburban parents who think a little boy's love of his Master Satan is cute and normal (not to mention his plans for his own sister) is really, really weird, ha. Friggin' hilarious though!

Satan's little helper is just like I said, soooo entertaining, that yes, I can highly recommend it if you are okay with cheesy, really low budget films. If you love pretty much anything Halloween themed, that's probably the person who is gonna get the most out of this one, or if you just find weirdness really funny. You could do a lot worse when searching for a horror film to watch. Check it out sometime!",1466726400,2,3972,4.513888888888889

Overall, I liked the movie, and if I could find a cheap version of that mask, I'd buy it and go on a killin spree I mean *cough* Wear it for halloween. The movie is low budget (I hope) But mostly enjoyable. If you love cats, don't watch it. One scene ruins it for myself. I am not big on cats, but I don't like seeing them get.. well, I won't go too into detail.

Generally the movie is about a (Serial Killer?) Dressed as Satan and a kid is obsessed with Satan and thinks it'd be really cool to be his little helper on Halloween. Thinking all the evil things he's doing isn't real. He's overly attached to his older sister, which is unrealistic, what (8?) year old kid loves their sister? If you are looking for tips on how to be a good serial killer, this is the movie for you. As a horror it's ok, it's not very scary, there's not a lot of gore, it just focuses mostly on violent themes. There's minor Nudity (Breasts) And a lot of violence to old ladies, small children and pregnant women, Suppose he's trying to be Satan after all?

I was drunk when I watched this, definitely made it a lot better, I suggest you do the same. That said, I did like it and (Maybe Spoiler?) The ending was left as an open ending left to the viewers imagination. So that's always fun.

Hope you enjoy the movie, if you don't then at least it's only 90 odd minutes long.",1444089600,,1378,4.172932330827067

The most unique aspect of this movie is, well I don't know how to say it... You're just watching things happen, and there appears to be no attempt to force moral themes upon the viewer. This builds up over time, and you realize you're watching something crazy. Fun music fills the air, but a guy gets murdered anyways. They're not going to set you up with foreboding bass violin, you're on your own. Anything could happen at any time, because there is no ""narrative""... now you're really having fun watching.

There is something else that builds up too... That Satan guy just gets creepier and creepier throughout the movie. His presence around the family get more and more disturbing. You've gone from watching a freak show from a distance with no attachment, to hoping he doesn't get hold of your favorite characters.

2352515,4,B000A2UC2E,"There are many films that you could choose this weekend; ""Magic of Belle Island,"" a movie that I reviewed a while back in which I gave a mild thumbs down.  ""A Dolphin Tale,"" another Morgan Freeman vehicle that I highly recommended, as it will bring tears to everyone's eyes and warmth to their hearts.  But I'm going to assert right here and right now:  any film that you choose surely won't be as family-friendly as ""Satan's Little Helper.""

Sure, it's got a little nudity.  One guy's mistress is shown naked in the shower as he's having an affair.  And it shows a young gal, who's influenced by her mom to dress seductively, even though the daughter's very young and in an even younger relationship with a guy she hardly knows.  But you can forgive a heart-warming story such as this for a few minor indiscretions.  After all, this film has its ""teachable moments"" as well, moments that you might nod your head at and say, ""I need to remember some of the little life lessons from this film!  Ah, if they'd only taught me some of this stuff in school!""

For example, this film shows the danger of rifling through someone's medicine cabinet and taking prescriptions that were written for someone else.  It also demonstrates that, say if you're a clerk in a grocery store, the dangers of confronting a shoplifter by yourself afterwards outside the store.  You also will learn that adding poisons, such as Drano, to punch is not the best idea in the world.  Oh, the ""teachable moments"" go on and on and on.

But perhaps the most important lesson that we learn from this film:  you really need to be careful when you pick your friends.  It's dangerous to hang out with people who use drugs for sure; we all know that.  But most people don't know that it's REALLY a bad idea to make friends with a serial killer.  He may take you down a dark and scary path; he might even drag you down to hell.  Or he'll at least take you down to the cellar in your house, a place that can be very dangerous and scary.

I was surprised that no critics seemed to review this fine family film, and I was doubly surprised that only 36 percent of the viewing public liked it.  Geez, I would have figured it'd be much higher than that.  After all, the movie's really funny, surely funnier than this light-hearted-and-tongue-in-cheek review.  I'd say ""Satan's Little Helper"" is entertainment for the whole family.  After all, you'll learn a lot of life lessons while watching, just like I did.",1374796800,6,2467,4.541950113378685

When it tries to be funny, it's mind-bogglingly awful, and when it tries to be scary, it is unintentionally hilarious. Intention is the whole point behind whether or not a movie is worth laughing at. If I thought this movie was actually trying to mock itself, I'd give it zero stars and tell you to stay away. But something about the script and directing makes me think that the producers were certain they had a nice, grimly sardonic little tale on their hands, without ever realizing that the opposite was actually true.

The movie follows the adventures of Dougie, a chubby little boy who has the face of a forty-year old podiatrist from Des Moines. Dougie's favorite video game is called Satan's Little Helper, and it involves tormenting people and sending them to hell. Dougie has dressed up as Satan's Little Helper for Halloween, and is always on the lookout for the real Satan, eager to prove his worth as an assistant. Also, Dougie's older sister is visiting home from college (apparently Halloween is a holiday her school honors), and he is excited to see her as well, announcing that he wishes to marry her (a desire his scatter-brained mother -- Amanda Plummer -- does nothing to dissuade).

It's better off if you imagine that every character suffers from some sort of mild retardation. When Dougie encounters ""Satan"" (a silent man in a cheap-o Halloween mask who is going around killer people and using the corpses as de facto Halloween decorations) he joins him in a town-wide slaughterfest. This includes encounters with his sister's new boyfriend (whom she met on the trip home; sister's a little slutty) as well as the town bullies (whose sole crime is calling Dougie's costume ""gay;"" as my girlfriend remarked, ""Worst bullies ever""). ""Satan's"" actions end up throwing the island town into chaos, much of it caused by the townspeople failing to demonstrate even a baseline level of competence or intelligence.

It's not clear if the script is denouncing video games, religion, or the care-free, ne'er-do-well, all-in-fun attitude that pervades the darkness of Halloween. It IS clear that there was an attempt to make some kind of clever point (several throw-away plot points turn out to resurface, including a nail-biting habit and the giveaway of shoes), but it's never done very well, and is surrounded by so much weird framing, disastrous editing, asinine acting, and bizarre character behavior that the whole movie turns into a mess of cheap coincidences and bizarre, dream-like plotting. All of it is propelled by Dougie's puffy-cheeked lunacy (the director wisely chose to have Dougie do most of his acting behind a red devil mask), as if he is the poster boy of the mental deficiency that runs through the entire populace. The fact that the cinematography (and even the typography of the opening credits) makes this look like a made-for-TV movie that was filmed on a My First Sony Camcorder is just icing on the cake.

It's not worth it to watch this movie alone or with any serious intentions. Get a group of sarcastic friends together, pop some beers, and be prepared to yell at the screen and you might have a good time. In fact, I have devised a handy little drinking game for anyone who is actually willing to sit through this thing.

One Drink:
--Anytime Dougie yells his sister's name.
--Anytime Satan gives a thumbs up
--Anytime the sister speaks in her horrible Renaissance Fair voice
--Anytime Dougie says a version of the line ""rip his guts out!""

Two Drinks:
--Anytime Dougie refers to Satan as ""master.""
--Anytime Satan feels up someone's breasts and/or sniffs underwear.
--Anytime an image of the Satan's Little Helper video game is shown.
--Anytime Dougie lifts the mask off his head.

Three Drinks:
--Anytime Dougie yells, ""Send them to hell!""
--Anytime the bullies make fun of Dougie's Satan costume.
--Anytime Satan actually kills someone on screen.

Chug Your Drink:
--Anytime Satan shows up at the house.
--Anytime Dougie cries.
--Anytime Satan flips someone off.

2352544,4,B000A2UC2E,"Satan's Little Helper (Jeff Liberman, 2004)

Straight up, no apologies, I love Jeff Lieberman. In 1976, he made his second feature, Squirm, and carved himself a niche in horror history. Said place was carved in stone when the movie showed up on Mystery Science Theater 3000, granting it the kind of immortality few films can dream of. That everyone thinks it sucks doesn't matter. Eventually, they'll realize they're wrong, and that it's a masterpiece of silliness. Lieberman has made very few films since, but when he does, I sit up and take notice. As of this writing, his most recent is 2004's Satan's Little Helper, and no surprise, it's a barrel of monkeys.

Douglas Whooly (Alexander Brickel, who also appeared in Todd Solondz' Palindromes that year) is a pre-teen who's obsessed with a videogame called Satan's Little Helper. (Think of it as a computerized version of the old driving game where you get x number of points for running over old ladies, blind people, animals, etc.) In fact, he's dressing up as the title character for Halloween, and the only things he's interested in on the big night are his costume and going trick-or-treating with his beloved sister, Jenna (Katheryn Winnick, currently playing David Boreanaz' love interest on Bones), who's coming home from college. Douglas gets a nasty shock, though, when Jenna brings home Alex (Whigmaleerie's Stephen Graham), another student, whom she's recently started dating. While Jenna's mother Merrill (Amanda Plummer, radiant as always) goes into matchmaker overdrive, Douglas takes to the streets, hoping to find Satan and get him to kill Alex. At the same time, there's a serial killer in an awesome mask roaming the neighborhood...

This is classic Lieberman, a mix of black comedy and solid horror that never makes any apologies, nor offers any explanations for the behavior of its characters. Lieberman is willing to take shades of incest and suburban serial killers as normal, he seems to be saying, why shouldn't we? Hey, I'm down with that. Lieberman uses simple techniques and plot devices to build tension; simple is effective here. (Douglas, for example, is totally down with his pal ""Satan"" killing off pretty much everyone in town except for mom and sis, but as soon as ""Satan"" meets sis, you know he wants to carve her up big time...) Lieberman doesn't do all that much out of the ordinary, and a number of the twists are pretty predictable given the conventions of the genre, but if you're looking for a solid, dependable horror flick, it's tough to go wrong with Jeff Lieberman. *** ",1293062400,2,2569,4.981351981351981
2352545,3,B000A2UC2E,"Satan's Little Helper will most likely draw you in from the freakish pumpkin holding creature on the front cover, assuring you a heavy dose of B horror. Now obviously we weren't going into it with any legitimate expectations but were expecting some laughable B. In a few ways it did deliver but mostly leaves you feeling moderately entertained at best. Really the biggest set back is the ultra annoying pudgeball main character Douglas Wooley. His character is beyond the realm of frustrating and has one of those faces you just want to punch over and over again. Sid felt kind of bad having that reaction about a kid but his chubby little face with the round Santa specs and horrible acting just made us cringe all the way through.

The movies starts out with chunkie Wooley on a Halloween quest to find the devil and be his sidekick. His big inspiration comes from a video game, yeah big surprise his fat a** sits inside all day playing video machines, in which the devil laces people up earning you points. For some reason this translates into reality for him since he has no friends. He somehow finds the devil (who is a merely a guy wearing Halloween mask..NO JOKE) and begins reeking havoc throughout the B town. That's pretty much the story in a nut shell with a handful of laughs and a really hot older sister. That right there is the true 3 star earning.

Since Sid is a big fan of any Halloween themed horror we decided Santan's Little Helper needed to be done. It's one of those flicks that's been on the back burner for a few years that we finally got around too. We knew it'd be poor grade B but overall enjoyed the watch for a one time viewing. Like stated before the main character is just so irritating that you just watch the full thing in hopes he'll be offed at some point. Odds are this one won't be leading him into a long successful acting career...or even a straight to video $5 bin career either. He'll most likely work part-time at Arby's filling the remainder of his time wackin it in the tool shed in between playing Worlds of Warcraft in his parents basement.

2352546,3,B000A2UC2E,"""Satan's Little Helper"" can be added to the growing list of Halloween-themed movies, and when this popped up on my instant play list on a movie rental website I subscribe to, I decided to give it a try. It's not too bad, especially given the fact that it is a low-budget movie and can be termed an independent flick. The acting is actually quite okay given that I did not recognize most of the actors.

Anyway, the plot is quite predictable - a college girl returns to her small town to celebrate Halloween with her younger brother and parents. Said younger brother is obsessed with a video game titled ""Satan's Little Helper"", even dressing up in a ""little Satan"" costume. Sis brings along her boyfriend which triggers her younger brother's anger (he feels threatened as he is very close to his sister). He leaves the house in a huff and strikes up a friendship with a sinister looking man dressed in a devil costume. Unknown to the little boy, the man is evil and has been going on a killing spree in the town, using Halloween as the perfect excuse to wreak murder and mayhem.

The production values and acting are good for a low-budget flick, and there are some twists to keep it interesting, even though the plot and even twists are rather predictable. This makes for a fun, mindless watch, especially during Halloween.",1283040000,,1323,4.625531914893617
2352547,4,B000A2UC2E,"""Satan's Little Helper"" is rather different than other films within the horror genre which focus around Halloween killing sprees and serial killers.  Rather than the same old, tried and true method of a masked serial killer parading around town on an endless killing spree, ""Satan's Little Helper"" takes an alternative spin on the subject.  Utilizing a child and his gullible mind, the film sets up a story that places another entertainment form as a scapegoat for violent behavior and immoral actions, video games.

Video games have often been branded as ""inappropriate"" for small children, especially graphic games which contain high levels of violence, gore, and sexual representation.  Well, ""Satan's Little Helper"" uses this idea, but takes it to the next level.  The story focuses around Dougie Whooly and his ever-growing obsession with his newest video game ""Satan's Little Helper"".  In this game, Dougie plays as a character that must assist Satan in capturing souls and sending them back to hell.  The game focuses around random killing of innocent bystanders and animals, and Dougie can't get enough of it.

Dougie's obsession has grown to the point where it made him decide to dress up as ""Satan's Little Helper"" for Halloween and search for Satan in order to do his bidding and send souls to hell for him.  Dougie and his mother go to the dock to pick up his sister, Jenna (Katheryn Winnick) whom Dougie has always had an intense crush on to the point of stating that he is going to marry her.  Despite the ""incest"" that this statement may imply, the viewer simply cannot blame the child's innocence once the audience gazes eyes on Jenna, who is in fact a very attractive young woman with amazing looks that anyone would find hot and sexy.  Jenna, however, shows up at the dock with her new boyfriend Alex, and Dougie views his sister's new lover as competition for his sister's affection.

Things begin to become tense as Dougie refuses to be around the family now due to his jealousy of Jenna's new boyfriend.  In order to combat this tension that is growing, Dougie's mom suggests that Dougie and Alex go trick or treating together, with Dougie dressed up as ""Satan's Little Helper"" and Alex dressed up as Satan.  She hopes that by having Alex and Dougie spend time together that perhaps they will eventually bond.  Dougie refuses, however, and his anger grows, leading him to isolation.  During his time alone, Dougie watches as a nearby neighbor, dressed as Satan, sets up his Halloween display for his yard which uses props that look very similar to real dead bodies, mostly due to the fact that they are indeed real dead bodies.

After witnessing this, Dougie asks the man if he can be ""his helper"" and help the man locate souls that he can send back to hell.  ""Satan"" agrees and the two of them begin their night of terror.  The rest of the film depicts images of Satan and Dougie brutally murdering innocents, all the while Dougie thinks it's a game and even keeps score of the kills that have been committed.  His young mind cannot separate fiction from reality, until a much later time in the film when one kill in particular finally releases Dougie from his naive nature and come to the realization that the murders were real the whole night.

The film is not exactly scary, and the gore content is filtered quite well, meaning that there isn't an excess amount of gore where the viewer feels like the killing is pointless and does not contribute to the overall plot.  Growing up on video games, I personally have never had any trouble distinguishing fact from fiction, even after playing Mortal Kombat when I was merely 7 years old, without ever acting violent in anyway and finishing college with a respectable job, so the common belief that everyone who is exposed to violent games tends to have a violent personality in which their minds cannot distinguish the difference between reality and a game is not necessarily true, however, children should still have their exposure to violence and nudity filtered out until the content is deemed age appropriate by the parents.

The film is mostly funny, rather than scary, and scenes such as when ""Satan"" flips off a local group of teenagers, as well as an employee at the local grocery store, are quite hilarious to view.  References to breasts and sexual innuendos are also quite funny, and help take away from the film trying to take itself too seriously.  It's good that the film is capable of producing laughs, while at the same time remaining violent and dark.  Scenes of grotesque murders are well done and many are quite original.  The balance between comedy and violence is done pretty good for a low budget film, and everything seems to work together quite perfectly, making the viewing experience quite enjoyable.  ""Satan's Little Helper"" is an overall good film worth viewing at least once for a few good laughs.",1281398400,2,4897,4.818399044205496
2352548,2,B000A2UC2E,"I've seen Liebermann's ""Squirm"" a couple of times and liked it quite a bit. It's a quirky, creepy horror film with some neat characters. So when I saw his name on this and read some of the reviews I had no hesitation in wanting to watch it. Boy was I wrong. This movie is pretty terrible.

First off. On the mood side, he does borrow heavily from Carpenter's ""Halloween"" in that the action not only takes place on Halloween, but most of it happens in a seemingly idyllic setting (postcard type American town) in broad daylight. Even the music has a similar ring to it. That being said, the biggest problem is with the script itself. It's not a bad idea I suppose. You have a young boy who has a thing for his older sister, and when she shows up from school with a new boyfriend, he gets ticked off and goes to find Satan so he send the boyfriend to Hell.

What follows is that little brother finds (or thinks he finds) Satan and offers himself up as his helper. Now a string of murders ensues and young brother has no idea he's witnessing the real deal. He thinks it's as big a put-on as his ""Satan's Little Helper"" video game. To pull this off you need to be one clever writer/ director and Liebermann shows he's not up to the task. Major, horrible things happen during the story that would normally cause people to react a certain way. Here they behave so counter-intuitively you figure they must be retarded. And this happens not once but a few times. He also sets something up toward the end that the viewer can see coming a mile away. It's not a good idea to telegraph your intentions.

People like to be scared. They want another good Halloween movie. I want another good Halloween movie, but this just isn't it. Save your time and money and re-rent or buy his movie ""Squirm."" It's loads better.",1276473600,,1801,4.38622754491018

2352577,4,B000A2UC2E,"Now this is Indie Horror done right. SATAN'S LITTLE HELPER is smart, original, and extremely dark. A young boy obsessed with his video game Satan's Little Helper enlists himself to help a masked serial killer he mistakes for the horned demon as the two commit atrocious crimes that the naive kid mistakes as being part of the game. Many will have to forgive the often goofy acting from each of the side players, but it is the costumed character of Satan that really sells this flick. With a sinister latex grin and exaggerated physical humor, this speechless villain adds a unique mixture of comedy and terror throughout the night's events. It is presumed that the character beneath the mask is human, however the film does leave enough intrigue as to keep the audience guessing until the end. In a favorite scene, Dougie jumps in the front of a shopping cart as Satan runs down a pregnant woman, a baby carriage, and a blind man while Dougie cheers and tallies the points. The one area where the film could use the most work is in its overly long ending, which could easily have been reeled back 10-15m to become more effective and concise. Director Jeff Lieberman has done a lot with a very little here, and instills the darkest humor possible in what I consider to be an instant Halloween classic. The film will not appeal to all genre fans, but for those of you that share my taste for Indie Horror, it is a refreshing surprise and well worth a view!

No other time of the year can you look natural walking down the street drenched in blood and carrying a butcher's knife.  The bad guy in this story has constructed a sinister Halloween display--mainly because most of his decor used to be breathing.  Cops see him dragging dead bodies across the yard and just wave as they drive by.

Let me back up a sec.  There's a young kid possessed (not actually possessed) with his devil video game.  He squeals in youthful delight as he racks up lots of points slaughtering people and casting them off into eternal damnation.

When the boy sees his neighbor dressed up in the Satan suit, he instantly becomes fascinated.  He playfully asks if he can be his helper as they send people to hell.  And so the murder spree begins.  Ahh yes, good bloody fun.

This is a decent setup.  It demonstrates the magnitude some bad influences can have on a child.  I almost peed my pants during one scene--the devilish duo sprint through a parking lot, using a loaded shopping cart as a battering ram.  Imagine the kid pointing and squealing:
OLD LADY!!!  {BAMMM}
haha 25 points!
BABY IN A STROLLER!!!  {SMACK}
yeah 50 points!
BLIND MAN!!!  {PA-POW}
wahoo bonus points!

That was funny as hell!!!!!

This movie rolls downhill fast after this little romp.  Some really moronic, predictable, unbelievable stuff to accompany the bad acting.  But yeah, you probably knew it was coming.

Otherwise a very effective movie for Halloween, and even though I prefer them without humour, with this one, the humour worked and really was funny. Mainly because of the kid, (Satan's little helper) a nerdy, geeky little kid, extremely credulous, obsessed with the computer game entitled ""Satan's Little Helper"", to the extent that he totally confused fantasy with reality. He was hilarious in believing that firstly, 'Satan' (killer in groovy mask) really was: Satan, and secondly, believing that killer in Jesus mask really was: God, and thirdly, believing that killer in cop mask and outfit really was a cop, in spite of all evidence to the contrary. His conversations with 'Satan', 'God', and then the cop, were the most effectively humorous points in the movie. ""Are you Satan?"" ""Are you God?"" And all they had to do was nod, without ever speaking a word. Classic!
I loved the Satan mask and outfit, so cool, if only people dressed up like that for Halloween everywhere and wandered around in the shops getting provisions and carrying a shopping basket, so funny! To be honest, I'd have preferred a Halloween movie utilising all the effective costumes and sets that this movie had, but without the humour, but at least here, it worked.

It is colourful and atmospheric and unusually for these days all the characters are sympathetic, while the killer loses none of his ogre value in being funny. I've only seen this once, but I am certain this is a fine film that must become a Halloween classic. It excels in Halloween imagery.

It sure has guts and bloods that would definately make you turn around, expecially when in one scene, Satan mauls out a poor pussy cat & writes BLOOD on the wall with it's own flesh.

It starts off with young Douglas playing with his video game entitled ""SATAN'S LITTLE HELPER"", while his mum and him are travelling through a small community town.

Once he spots Satan murdering the neighbourhood while trick or treating, 9 year old Dougie starts investigating every move until he catches him.  The two then bond as friends and embark on a mission to kill to earn points from his game.
But Satan doesn't speak so he's a bit like another Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers mass murderer out for the kill.

Believe me, this horror will keep you on the edge of your seat from the start to finish.

Firstly the movie in my opinion is sick not funny as they stated it was. It was confusing, and stupid. If anyone thinks it is funny to take a cat and smash its head into a wall then rub the blood all over said wall, then we live with a lot of sick people. I would not recommend this movie, I am not an animal activist there was not call for this scene. The plot was twisted and sick giving people ideas on how to do damage to children. No wonder we have had to change the way we give out Halloween candy. This is one movie that should never have been made. It was just death for no reason and definitely not funny in any way shape or form. If I had known then what I know now I would never have spent even 1cent for it.",1189123200,3,861,3.842696629213483
2352628,1,B000A2UC2E,"My husband and I are B Movie addicts, so when we found this movie, we thought we had found gold. The acutal premise of the movie as described on the back cover seems not only plausible, but downright hilariously deviant.

Boy, were we wrong. Despite the fact that this movie has a ""cult"" director as well as a cult actress as the mom, this movie falls short from the very beginning. The kid seems moderately developmentally handicapped, if not completely, so any sort of joy that could be had from his involvement is here out neutered.

In the matter of about 2 minutes, his much older sister goes from modest young girl to unabashed tramp, and not in any sort of enjoyable, deviantly sexy way. The mother is just insane, and whenever she is on camera with the daughter, one feels the impending lesbian incest makeout scene that would actually make this movie worth sitting through, but it never happens.

The plot has holes you could drive through with an 18 wheeler, and the only backstory to the ""killer"" is a ten second, blink and you'll miss it snippet. I feel as though the director/writer didn't even try to make a coherant story, believable characters, or anything that was particularly scary OR funny. And I am saying all this in terms of B movies, not major releases.

The only positive thing I guess I can say is that it has been a LONG time since I've wanted every single character to die, including the killer. It takes a special kind of suck for me to actually DISLIKE an insane serial killer on Halloween. That being said, anyone who enjoyed this movie is either a fanboy or has highly questionable taste, and would probably laugh at a dried up turd on the sidewalk.",1185494400,2,1681,4.556291390728477

This is the best straight-to-video movie I've seen in a long time; and I'm a horror elitist.  Of course it's not high budget, but the black comedy more than makes up for it.

On Halloween day, Dougie meets up with a serial killer wearing a mask who Dougie thinks is the real Satan from the video game.  They become instant friends, and Dougie's innocence doesn't allow him to see the climbing body count as they go on a rampage through the town.

 well hey . . this is a B movie people..  if they cant be fun and not take themselves toooo seriously then how is that going to be

this was HILARIOUS .. to me it certainly was!  : D

im sure some people will find the humor offensive, but its GREAT good laughs and escapism.. its even kind of cute.. the whole masked/kid with the killer/satan thing..

 no, he DOESNT ever say anything, the killer.. but.. thats GREAT..

i found this for $5 at a previewed dvd sale somewhere (not online).. err.. should i be saying this here?  but anyway.. im biased i guess because i didn't pay top dollar for it..

but..  the reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because, as a lot of movies do ..  it kind of gets slow a couple times..

 it could have been more tightly editted/compressed..

but thats great if you like it, because it makes it seem to take forever.. b movies seem to have a way of seeming longer than a big 'mainstream' movie of the same length.. i don't know why.. and this one clocks in at 100 minutes..

 anyway i loved it, its one of the only decent 'b' movies ive seen in a long time,

and you know what, it actually has great acting.. and *looks* very much like a non-b movie..

some people saying the camera was bad ??  i don't know what that means.. it was very good visually..

very sharp and clear, and i thought professional camera-work..

except where they let the camera 'jostle' about a little like in the halloween movies where its from the killers perspective..

I don't consider this a horror movie exactly.  People get killed, and there's some blood and guts but nothing is ever really scary.  The killer, who never says a word and who we never see without a mask, is kind of funny and often weirdly likable.  The acting is actually well above average for a B.  Even the kid isn't terrible.  Plus the actress who plays the sister is easy on the eyes.

It starts out very well, and I was enjoying it quite a bit.  But like most B films (and many A films) it just goes on too long.  The creativity at the beginning runs dry, and we have several of the same gags repeated.  The bad guy fools the same people twice by putting his costume on somebody else.  And the dumb little kid gets taken in by the killer not once, not twice, but three times.

2352646,1,B000A2UC2E,"I was intrigued by ""Satan's Little Helper"" due to several things namely its Halloween theme, which I'm a big sucker for, and the heralded return of Jeff Lieberman to the horror scene.  Lieberman made 4 minor cult horror films in the 70's and 80's, the last one being 1987's ""Remote Control"".  You would think that Lieberman, with all this time off from filmmaking would have spent his share of time carefully observing horror films in order to craft a good one when he would choose to return.  Well, it almost feels like Lieberman is stuck in some kind of time warp, as this movie looks like it came straight from the 80's due to how cheesy, trashy, cheap and godawful it is.  Many, myself included, look upon the 80's slasher craze with fond nostalgia but this is one film that reminds us how truly bad some of those films could be.

The ""plot"" revolves around a 10-year old boy who is a huge fan of the video game ""Satan's Little Helper"".  It's now Halloween season and his mom buys him a devil costume, which he wears proudly.  One afternoon, he spots a tall man wearing an equally devilish costume dragging bodies around to serve as Halloween decoration stiffs for the front of his house.  He becomes enamored with the tall & mute masked man and asks him if he can be his helper.  The two then go on a rampage throughout the small suburban community, as the masked man kills people randomly in gruesome fashion all the while the boy (whose intelligence quotient appears to be much closer to a 5-year old than a 10-year old) inexplicably thinks it's all still a game of make believe.

If you think the plot sounds bad that's nothing compared to how poorly this movie is executed.  Nearly everything about it is god-awful from the camcorder film quality, to the laughable gore effects (including the least-ever convincing intestines I've ever seen) and especially, the acting. The 10-year old boy, who appears in nearly every scene, makes a run for most annoying child actor in recent memory.  The acting on just about everyone's part is bad, and the characters all come across as being mentally retarded from the clueless boy to the mute villain who kills for no apparent or explained reason, the flaky sister and the eccentric, kooky mother.  There is not a single character we can give a darn about and we don't care the least bit when someone gets killed.  Granted, dumb characters who do dumb things in horror movies are a dime a dozen, but these ones truly take the cake.

I'm a little baffled as to why this movie has gotten its share of enthusiastic reviews.  I'm thinking some people are going to put this in the ""so good it's bad"" category but I'm not having it.  Some of the scenes in the movie that were meant to be ""funny"", such as the parking lot scene where the villain and boy knock off a pregnant woman, an elderly lady, and a stroller carrying a kid, are downright appalling.  The villain himself is a bad joke, as he doesn't utter a single word throughout the film, instead delivering thumbs-up signs to the kid and wagging his finger.  Cheesy?  Heck, this film is cheesier than a Black Diamond factory.  ""Satan's little helper"" comes across as the work of a first-time wannabe horror amateur with no budget, not something from a guy in his fifties considered a cult filmmaker.  To sum up how I feel about this film, I will repeat a line that I see all over Amazon that I usually feel redundant but somehow I find to be entirely fitting for this movie.

Or something like that. This isn't Plan 9.....not much is. But Satan's Little Helper's strength is in it's heart. What the film lacks in technical worth, it makes up for in sheer glee. Jeff Lieberman's love for the genre is so evident, that the inane dialogue and the lack of character development is forgiven. I like this movie for the same reason I liked House of 1000 Corpses. It's made by someone who you can tell is having the time of his life, doing what he wants to do. So, in the typical, overblown excuse for effects that is hollywood, sense, no, this is not a good movie. But in terms of a horror fan making movies for horror fans, Satan's Little Helper is heads and tails over a piece of garbage such as VanHelsing. And for the record, I really think some parts of this film are creepy. The first part of the film takes place on Halloween day, and I've always thought that things that happen during the day are a lot scarier and more subversive than things that happen in the dark. Anyone can make the dark scary.....",1129075200,7,1277,4.3924050632911396
8072880,2,B000A2UC2E,"""Satan's Little Helper"" has two factors going for it: an interesting premise and a surprisingly talented cast. Even together, however, they cannot save this movie.

Perhaps the biggest issue is the quality. I feel bad for writing this, as I want to support budding filmmakers, but to say this film looks cheap is to put it mildly. The visual and audio qualities are terrible. The entire film looks as if it were recorded on a home video camera, and I have to agree with other reviewers on here who thought the movie looked like a cheap 90's flick despite being made in the early 2000's. I don't tend to be much of a quality snob, I think, as I usually opt to rent SD on here rather than the more expensive HD. But even I considered opting out of the movie just a few minutes in when I realized the quality was not going to improve.

Once you get past the technical issues, you run into the story problems, namely the unbelievable characters. Most of the characters in this film seem too stupid to live. I find it hard to believe that no one at the Halloween party found anything amiss about the mother being covered in tape. And the kid's falling for the killer's costume switches every time started to get ridiculous.

Speaking of, the film never really establishes why Dougie is so disconnected from reality, though I suppose I cannot fault it too much for not throwing out diagnoses on a whim.

Still, the film is not all bad. Amanda Plummer turns in a solid performance, as does Kathryn Winnick. The latter also spends much of the movie in a revealing costume, which is bound to gain the movie some appeal. And, finally, the killer's actor does a good job giving personality to a silent villain, and his costume was spot on.

Overall, while I do not recommend the film, die-hard fans of slashers and horror comedies could do worse, and fans of ""bad"" horror movies should give it a try.",1518998400,,1889,4.495626822157434

Things soon spiral horribly out of control, as they are apt to do in these scenarios.
