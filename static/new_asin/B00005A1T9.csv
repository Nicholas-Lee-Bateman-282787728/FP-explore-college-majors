7935053,4,B00005A1T9,"LE BAMBOLE/THE DOLLS is a great example of ""commedia all'italiana"" and its four directors are in very good form here.  The great attraction is the cast, though: virtually every actor is just perfect in his/her role.  Lollobrigida is at her sexiest.  She had problems with the censors in Italy at the time, on account of appearing half naked in the last scene of her episode, 'Monsignor Cupido,' delightfully directed by Bolognini.  Akim Tamiroff gives her all the support she needs.  He is sublime.  But beware: the DVD transfer is terrible in this American release.  It is better to import the recently released Italian DVD from any European seller.",1168905600,4,650,4.962962962962963
7935054,1,B00005A1T9,"The movie Le Bambole is quite an interesting picture [which I can recommend], as it reflects of the 1960s Italian morals, but this DVD should be avoided at all costs.  The quality of the print is simply abysmal.  It looks as this had been sourced from a second generation video, if not worse.",1001808000,23,292,4.490566037735849
