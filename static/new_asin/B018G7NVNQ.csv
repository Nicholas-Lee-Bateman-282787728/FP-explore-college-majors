7548306,2,B018G7NVNQ,"The first two seasons were well written as detective shows. The third season, still has excellent photography and superlative music. But it has lost the detective element of the story. Now the shows start with a wash of momentary, fragmented hints; and then we are left in a desert of stage motion and character development; and finally we are deluged with a ""deus ex machina"" moment when the killer, the motivation and the method are all revealed. Good detective shows invite the viewer to involve themselves in the thought processes of the protagonist as they slowly home in on the ""who, how, and why"" of crime solving. Only mediocre shows replace detection with hero worship for a protagonist who's only virtue is winning the day. The actors still do a wonderful job of bringing the scripts to life. But, whoever is doing the writing and the editing needs to be shown to the door. Please bring back the detective show I enjoyed so much that I ordered it from the U.S. while it was still only available in PAL format.",1463443200,4,1019,4.666666666666667
7548307,5,B018G7NVNQ,"Season three of Endeavour lives up to expectations.  The scripts are magnificent, the acting superb, the sets spectacular (sometimes because of their scale and ambition, sometimes because of their muted evocation of the 1960s, complete with material culture objects pertinent to the period.  It is hard to compare this series with the mainstays of English television because we are only in season three, but in my opinion this is the finest mystery series being produced today.

Season 3 consists of four 90 minute episodes (Ride, Arcadia, Prey, Coda).  The episodes are all very, very different.  The first is an extended homage to The Great Gatsby, the second a strange, atmospheric mystery, the third a beautifully bizarre homage to The Hound of the Baskervilles, the final episode an account of (among several other things) a bank robbery.  Each is special in its own way.

A lot of personal things are going on.  Remember that season two ended with Thursday wounded and Morse incarcerated.  The two must come together again and rediscover their reasons for doing the things that they do.  In the third season Strange is promoted to the rank of sergeant.  Suddenly he is giving Morse orders, though he wishes to remain his friend.  Morse is cut out for more (the rank of Detective Inspector, in Thursdays judgment), but he cannot jump ranks and is preparing for his own sergeants exam.  He is also thrown together with Thursdays daughter Joan in episode four.  As always, he finds his identity in his love of music, his work, drink and chaste but ephemeral connections with women.  Everyone loves him and wishes to free him from his solitude, but that remains a goal that is always a step or two out of reach.

Fans of the series will not want to miss this season.  For those who have not yet encountered Endeavour, start at the beginning.  Better yet, start with John Thaws Morse and meet the man in middle age.  He is equally compelling.

My only criticism of this season is that the fourth episode has moments when the screen is darker than the ambient light would suggest.  This is also true of external scenes.  The lighting parallels and reinforces the drama, but sometimes things get a little too dimly-lit.  This may have been a defect in my disc, but there were no other problems (with, e.g., tiling or pauses/blips).

The discs will not play on a U.S. dvd player (though many individuals play international discs on their computers).  My advice is always to buy an all-regions player.  Amazon.com sells them for a modest price.  I have two Pioneer players which work very well, their average price around $100.  They are simple to operate.  You put in the disc; the machine reads the code; the show begins.  An all-regions player enables you to see things that have not yet been released in the U.S.  It also enables you to comparison-shop.  This import is currently selling for $39.95.  The British version is selling for less than half of that.",1462838400,6,2960,4.798019801980198
7548308,5,B018G7NVNQ,This continues the story started by the Inspector Morse and Lewis. It is interesting how one can catch characters written into this series that were mentioned or featured in previous Inspector Morse and Lewis episodes.,1462147200,,218,5.257142857142857
7548309,5,B018G7NVNQ,"Great series, a worthy successor/prequel to 'Morse' and 'Inspector Lewis'.  Shaun Evans and Roger Allum are terrific.  As for the playback region issue, when I ordered this item the listing had a big box with a yellow warning sign explaining that the DVD will not play on a standard US Region 1 player.  I also got a warning about the same issue before placing the order.",1461110400,5,371,4.590909090909091
7548310,3,B018G7NVNQ,"Five stars for the condition of the DVD. The content gets a 2 and a half stars. I loved the first two seasons and couldn't wait to see the third one but the stories fell way short in terms of plot complexity, crime solving surprises and overall plot development.

I may or may not watch the fourth season, but I will not be waiting for it as I waited for the third one.",1458950400,15,369,4.054794520547945
7548311,5,B018G7NVNQ,"My PC and laptop DVD player region 2
 I often look for region 2 as some season of programs never make it to the US. Just have to be careful on the series/season numbers some times a season 3 is really US season 2 as an example",1456531200,5,226,3.8085106382978724
7548312,2,B018G7NVNQ,"When I ordered this set, I took pains to check whether the discs were for Region 1.  I would swear the description said they were, but when they arrived today, they turned out to be for Region 2. $25+ wasted. When I went to check the listing, all I find are Region 2 discs.  I am giving this 2 stars because there is a chance I misread the description. I do not think I did, because since it was coming from Germany, I was very concerned about that and, frankly, surprised it was available for Region 1.  Because all the listings now say Region 2, I have no way to know or prove what it originally said, so I am leaving 2 stars instead of 1 or none.  So disappointed. Guess I will go see whether I can find a cheap Region 2 DVD player.",1456531200,10,735,4.048275862068966

8742273,1,B018G7NVNQ,"I watched the first episode of Series 3 on Public Television.  It did not seem to make sense.  In the end, the plot was explained; yes, there was a plot and viewers were supposed to guess.  I could not help wondering whether the episode had been abridged to fit into a 90-minute slot.  At Amazon.co.uk, the run time for series 3 (a total of four episodes) is given as 480 minutes; at Amazon.co (U.S.) the run time is given as 357 minutes; both are from ITV.  Why this discrepancy?
.
The other episodes are scheduled for the next three Sundays.  I may not bother to watch them: watching Episode 1 was a waste of time.",1466380800,,616,4.3130434782608695
