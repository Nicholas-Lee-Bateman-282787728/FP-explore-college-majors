8466865,5,B005DIAG94,"Dr Gonzalez speaks for 3 hrs non stop without notes giving the most logical explanations of health, diets and causation of disease I have heard in a long time.  Individualisation of dietary advice and supplementary advice according to body type is the most sensible way to go.  Not only is it sensible, it works for very serious conditions including cancer as Dr Gonzales has experienced with his clients.  Much research and observation has gone on in the past to discover this and it should be much more widely known.  Really worthwhile lecture if you are at all interested in balancing the body to bring good health.",1411344000,,618,4.80188679245283
8466866,5,B005DIAG94,"If there were a scale of one to ten on Amazon this lecture by Dr. Nicholas J. Gonzalez, MD. would still be above that. If you watched and listened to the lecture two, or even three times you will find you still missed something when you listen yet again the forth time. I am an educated, practicing Nutrition Professional and to tell you how impressed I am with this body of work is an understatement.",1405209600,,401,4.36

8466870,5,B005DIAG94,"I was the original Junk Food Junkie and spent the first 22 years of my life living on Twinkies, Big Hunks, Mountain Dew and every other processed, refined, sugar-laden, nutrient-void non-food you can imagine (and even some you can't).  Somehow still alive when my 23rd birthday rolled around, I knew I needed to make a radical change in my death-wish diet for the simple reason that my health was kaput and I felt terrible.  So I stepped for the very first time into a rather creepy-looking natural foods store filled with long-haired hippy freaks and marijuana smoke you could cut with a knife, not realizing I had just embarked on a life-long journey in search of true health.  Emerging ten minutes later slightly stoned from breathing the air, I zoomed home, cooked up my first organic, natural food meal, and never looked back.  Immediately I began reading this book and listening to that tape, going to this chiropractor and talking to that naturopath, in an attempt to regain my shattered health.  And it was very frustrating, because everyone I researched and/or followed only had pieces of the health puzzle and often contradicted the previous guy.  Or they would just throw vitamins and minerals at a problem, much like an orthodox physician uses drugs.  They all had the ""perfect diet for mankind"" (ludicrous), usually named after themselves and vegetarian in nature.  So after almost 20 years of searching, I was still floundering about and still not feeling all that great.

Then I listened to a taped lecture by Dr. Gonzalez...and my search ended.  Dr. Gonzalez understands true health - and how to obtain it - better than anyone else on  the planet.  That may sound like an exaggeration - it is not.  And though he specializes in cancer (with AMAZING results, I might add), his protocol applies to most any disease.  Dr. Gonzalez doesn't have one perfect diet - he has 100 (10 basic diets - 90 variations) and puts each of his patients on the perfect diet FOR THEM - a diet that will bring their autonomic nervous system into balance (the autonomic nervous system is Houston Control for the body, and when it is in balance, the body is at its healthiest). Some of his patients are on red meat (the enemy of mankind!) three times a day (I'm not a patient, but that's what I now eat), some are on more of a vegetarian diet and still others are on a Mediterranean-type diet.  And that's Gonzalez's genius - we're all different, we all need different diets to be healthy.

If you want to regain and/or maintain true health, buy these DVD's - $30.00 is a bargain for the pure gold knowledge you will obtain, knowledge that will allow you to understand true health better than any in the orthodox world and many in the alternative.  Dr. Gonzalez is flat-out brilliant - listen to him.",1369526400,25,2792,4.711934156378601
