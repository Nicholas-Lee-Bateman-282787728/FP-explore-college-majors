8223113,3,B000WFSMQC,"I used to own this on VHS, which was probably back in 1981 or 1982. One of the problems - in my opinion - was it was only as good as whatever Paris nightclub they happened to be in at the moment. The ""they"" was actress/model Lauren Hutton and a male co-host (who now I can't remember, unfortunately) who takes the viewer through a risque look through Paris' 'redlight district.'

I do remember there was the Moulin Rouge and a lesbian cabaret featured, as well as the famed ""Madame Arthur's"" (astonishing transsexual show) where a Raquel Welch look-a-like did a strip tease (thankfully only down to her g-string, and no further).

What I remember the most about this doc was when watching with a friend of mine he commented how Lauren's male cohost mentioned that at the lesbian club they were know as ""les Femmes"" in french (very beautiful language), and then Lauren Hutton said something to the effect, ""Well, back home in the States they're known as LEZBIANS."" Which was kind of funny the way she said it...almost as if she was disgusted by having to say the word. I'm sure she didn't mean for it to come off that way, but it did which made it rather funny. I guess it's something you have to see and hear to get the full effect, and this is in regards to the whole film...It's something you must view for yourself.",1305417600,,1318,4.4875
