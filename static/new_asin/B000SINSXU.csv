2885224,4,B000SINSXU,"If you're reading this, you should already know this was the series that turned British television comedy upside down in the early Eighties (granted, parts of it haven't aged so well...). So I'll just get on with reviewing the particulars of this issue of the series on DVD. On one hand, these look like they're remastered - the picture looks sharper and the sound is improved, not to mention better subtitles this time. For anyone who bought the last box, the Ken Bishop's Nice Twelve (featuring Jools Holland, Stewart Copeland and many others) musical segment from ""Cash"" has been restored, and Neil's ""Sound of Silence"" bit that he sings in the bathtub in ""Nasty"" is back in place, so now that scene has its punchline in its original spot. Yet in the scene that immediately follows it in that episode (Rick sneaking into his bedroom), the ""teddy-bear sex"" shot is now gone. What, is that scene now considered too ""offensive"" or something? Anyone that's upset by an image like that shouldn't be watching the bloody ""Young Ones"" in the first place!

The extras? Well, I wish they'd kept the documentary bits from the ""Every Stoopid Episode"" one on here and just put this new stuff in place of the ""Filthy Rich And Catflap"" and ""Bottom"" episodes. At least with the first set, you could see vintage clips of Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmonson on stage. This time around there's not much cast participation in the interviews aside from Alexei Sayle and Nigel Planer.

So, I'm giving this one 4 stars - ""right on"" to the improved picture and sound, ""sod off"" to the inferior extras and inexplicable editing-out of a short but pretty funny scene.

I'm sure I echo the sentiments of other ""Young Ones"" fans when I ask... when is someone going to issue the ""Comic Strip Presents"" DVD box set in Region 1?!? Not only does it feature many of the cast, writers and crew that worked on ""The Young Ones"", but it's the only way to get the ""Bad News"" shows on DVD.",1198281600,125,1947,4.621387283236994
2885225,5,B000SINSXU,"This show is my absolute favorite British comedy. If you have never seen the Young Ones but find yourself laughing at Monty Python, The Black Adder or Absolutely Fabulous, then you are doing a great disservice to yourself.

Watching this great show now is a nostalgic reminder of my younger days--especially since the sudden death of Rik Mayall in June 2014.  As someone who grew up watching Monty Python, Black Adder, Red Dwarf, and Fawlty Towers I'm a huge fan of British Comedy.

2885328,5,B000SINSXU,"Bought this DVD for my girlfriend at the time because it was what she liked and Amazon had the cheapest price and was one of the only places I could find it actually. Although I didn't necessarily enjoy the comedy, my girlfriend loved it and watched it multiple times. The quality of the video and audio was up to par for a DVD of it's time. Occasionally you could tell that it had been remastered and sounded a little tinny to me, but I am quite particular about my sound quality, so I doubt the average user would notice. As far as the sellers go, shipping was fast and the price was good, so absolutely no complaints there.",1354060800,,626,4.313559322033898

2885331,1,B000SINSXU,"After removing the shrinkwrap I found that the manufacturing of these discs is very poor, especially the first DVD. Amazon kindly replaced the whole set when the first DVD would not play in two different DVD players; but again when I opened the second replacement item I found the first DVD heavily marked making it unable to play properly due to multiple picture/audio-freezes. Contacting BBC Worldwide Americas Inc. for a replacement disc is useless as I've spoken to them twice already: they are polite on the phone but won't do anything to correct the problem with this shoddy product. Today I will try contacting Warner Home Video Inc. who is the U. S. distributor before contacting Amazon about a refund. It would seem that this entire DVD is run is defective and I give the consumer the highest warning possible not to purchase this item from any seller for that reason. My only regret (other than having purchased this item) is that I am unable rate this product at zero stars. Amazon was going to refund the second item sent but I took the first DVD to a rental store and for $2.00 they had a machine that ""repaired"" the disc to a playable condition, so if you intend to buy this release find a rental store that repairs DVDs first!",1333238400,4,1241,4.619909502262443
2885332,3,B000SINSXU,"Growing up at the time I remember everything seemed to be young ones orientated. Kids running around headbutting brick walls in an attempt to be just like Vivian or coming up with way out comments to be just like Niel. Thing is I never got it at the time and decided to buy this complete set to find out if I do now.

Place the clock forward a few years and I finally feel that I can understand the joke, in fact anyone who has lived in scummy houses at universities will see clearly just how funny it all is. The problem is however for me the same as it was first time around, you have to wait a long time for something good to happen. The peak of the series is of course Episode 1 series 2 where the guys are invited to contend on University Challenge, this is truly a great comic moment. The rest however consists of interesting sight gags, loads of swearing and clever innuendo. The series was great but I have never been totally convinced that it was as ground breaking as it seems to be considered. Lets face it Charles Chaplin was once considered ground breaking and Benny Hill was for his day positively daring. The Young Ones seem to have done nothing new but they did succeed in re packaging the old fail safes of comedy, innuendo and slapstick and branded it as  Alternative... Alternative to what I ask!",1325289600,,1315,4.341463414634147

There has never been, nor do I think there will ever be a show like this... daring , funny, inventive and all around cool. The only thing I am wondering is when will they release an official soundtrack featuring all the cool bands plus the wacky musical numbers performed by the cast?!

2885362,5,B000SINSXU,"The Young Ones was an alternative sitcom that truly changed the way people looked at comedy and the traditional sitcom. It was the true anarchist of TV released at a time when the working classes were close to embarking on a full blown revolution against Thatcher's Britain. The show combined a number of different formats; traditional sitcom, violent slapstick and surrealism to make what some would consider truly bizarre but utterly brilliant. The creation of Rik Mayall, Ben Elton and Lise Mayer this has fast become one of the most well loved sitcoms in BBC history.

Focusing around 4 very different students, The Young Ones each represent the main stereotypes of Thatcherite Britain. Vyvyan (Ade Edmondson), the punk who hates everything authoritarian but reveals a more contradictory side to the tough guy persona. Rick (Rik Mayall), the annoyingly leftist goody two shoes who claims to be against authority until he's faced with it and also, being a massive Cliff Richard fan makes him twice as annoying. Neil (Nigel Planer), the depressed hippy who just talks about love and peace yet doesn't stop going on about how he wants to kill himself.  Mike (Christopher Ryan), the gangster of the group who considers himself very much the leader of the group and a bit of a ladies man. Alexei Sayle (Jerzy Balowski), the unpredictable landlord of the boys who comes in and takes on many different tasks that annoy his tenants.

There are many reasons for this programmes success. One is the unique comedy contained within but the other is the plethora of comic minds involved, not just as part of the writing team but those in front of the camera too. At the time of its release, each of the comedians was at the start of their character acting/comedy careers and were really looking to make names for themselves. I can't imagine that they would have believed this show to be as successful as it has become and how, even now, it can still be watched and enjoyed as much as it was when it first debuted.

I pointed out the surrealism aspect of the sitcom and this is really what makes it stand out from all the other sitcoms of that time. It's not just the basic sitcom of gag after gag. After a particular scene with the group, the camera will pan out to a completely bizarre scene that relates to what went on with the real cast. For example, in the episode ""Boring"", Alexei Sayle's character drinks water from a goldfish bowl and the scene will then turn to the insides of his stomach. We see the fish in the stomach talking to another piece of food about its appearance in the next James Bond film. This type of random addition really allows the creators of the show to experiment and can, in a way, relate itself to the Monty Python series as there was a lot of experimentation with the comedy.

Another great addition to the show is its adding of live band performances for the in-house audience and of course the audience at home. The acts are fit within the script of the show, so it's not as if the bands just come out of nowhere, but that is another fine example of what places this above the others in the case of originality. Although it's only a short lived show, lasting only for 2 series, I'm quite glad they didn't try to drag it out to a third or fourth series as it would have truly allowed the show to die a sore death. The amount of celebrity guests are another great addition with people such as Stephen Fry and French & Saunders plus many others. To those who like the bizarre and really enjoy a good laugh, then this is really the show for you.",1242691200,23,3568,4.5600624024961
