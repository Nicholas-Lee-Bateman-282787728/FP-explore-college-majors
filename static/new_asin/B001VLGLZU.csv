On this fine clear morning....I put it on my home entertainment system .....

Everything about Tangerine Dream is best described in superlatives.....their stage persona , their music and
the sheer magic of it.

For an outdoor concert , the sound quality is so good , it could have been recorded in a town hall....

I just hope Edgar Froese isn't contemplating retiring ant time soon.....he leads a group that is timeless and ageless....their music lives in the same atmosphere as that of Pink Floyd.....

The 'Dream  are a cut above everybody else in sheer brilliance.........

The band is getting along really well, and loving what they are doing together and it really makes this fun to watch.
This is another of those PAL (Europian)disks that many USA DVD players will not recognize. I have a player that does, so I am happy. It is a little $74 DVD boombox that plays US & European DVDs, CDs, camera SD cards, Flash drives, radio, runs on 12 & 110 volts, has a 7"" LED screen and 3 output jacks, here is the link
