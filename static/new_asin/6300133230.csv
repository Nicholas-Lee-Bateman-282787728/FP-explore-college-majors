7803462,5,6300133230,"One of the finest movies ever made, exploring Zulu culture, White South African society, and most importantly the essential nature of religion. The critical moment comes when the main character, Ntuku Makwena, learns that the village witch doctor murdered his daughter and lied about who did it, sending Ntuku on a wild goose chase through the South African courts and prison. Can he punish a witch doctor, who has the power of the Gods on his side?

I don't want to give a spoiler here, but I can say that this conflict is on the same level as Huckleberry Finn having to decide whether he is willing to go to Hell to save his friend Jim from slavery.",1455580800,,651,4.516949152542373

7803467,5,6300133230,"My mother was born and grew up in Durban, South Africa, and I've been there, so I have some natural affinity to things from South Africa.  This movie shows some of the misunderstandings in customs between the white tribes (British descendants, and Afrikaners, and the Zulus/Bantus)and the blacks tribes, who are each viewing the other side's normal way of dealing with murder, with head shaking, jaw dropping disbelief.

The two primary characters are a Zulu man, husband and father,  and a British descendant South African lawyer who is to defend him on the charge of murder, even though to the Zulu man, this particular killing was tribally sanctioned and called for as the revenge for the slaying of his little daughter.  It's well made and offers some insight into how misunderstandings that cause disputes can be resolved.

Two of the traditional Zulu folk songs are used in this movie, and they're the best renditions of these songs that I've ever heard.  The first is a lullaby called Tula Baba (Sleep Baby) and the second is a song of greeting and goodbye called Shosholoza which I've been able to find on YouTube. Both are beautiful.  How I wish they'd release this movie on DVD.",1380326400,2,1188,4.822660098522167
7803468,5,6300133230,"The VHS Dingaka was a very nice rendition of an excellent story on ZULU Tribal Customs, with an excellent cast. The music was the predecessor of Ipi Ntombi a hit South African Musical written by Bertha Egnos. The video arrived on time and was excellent quality.",1309219200,3,261,4.695652173913044
7803469,4,6300133230,"This is a nice little film on several levels. It is from Jamie Uys, who also directed THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY and ANIMALS ARE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE. This film is not the comedy that those were. Instead, it is a drama taking place in Southern Africa.

The primary story concerns a tribesman who learns that the heart of his daughter has been eaten by another member of the tribe on the advice of the local witch doctor. This deed was done to secure powerful magic and increase the bad guy's prowess as a fighter. When the crime comes to light, however, he flees and the outraged father takes off after him. He is followed to the city of the white man where both are in unfamiliar environments. This leads to the father being taken advantage of and eventually having to find mining work to support himself while he seeks his foe. When he is found, he attempts to kill him and that gets him tangled up in the legal system he does not understand.

The secondary story is of the lawyer assigned to defend the gallant tribesman. He is cynical and no one, even his wife, seems to like him. He was not always thus but has become bitter and disillusioned. In taking this case, however, he begins to change back into a real human being. Eventually it is learned that the one ultimately responsible for all of the evil in the tribe's life is the witch doctor who uses his position and reputation to extort the other tribesman. The stage is set for a final conflict.

The film works as an examination of culture clash. It works equally well in its depiction of honor and character change. What will stay with me the longest, however, is the haunting music sung by the tribesmen and women. It is magnificent.",1129507200,15,1689,4.459546925566343
