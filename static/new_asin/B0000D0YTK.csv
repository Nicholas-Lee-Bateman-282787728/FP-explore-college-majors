7999725,5,B0000D0YTK,This old Holmes fan absolutley adores Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century. Very well done! I just wish all of the episodes were available.,1148601600,,138,4.791666666666667
7999726,4,B0000D0YTK,"This DVD is nice.  It's good to have more of these episodes on DVD, however this collection (just four episodes) is a bit on the skimpy side.  I wish it contained more, or that they just released boxed sets already...  Bottom line, if you like the series, you'll like this DVD.  :)",1142812800,3,281,4.346153846153846
7999727,5,B0000D0YTK,"This is an excellent disc of a great series. I am a fan of the

old black and white episodes, but this is good too. The animation is very nice, the music good and most of the stories

are interesting and can be watched several times before you know them too well. Use your eyes and brains and give it a chance.",1124668800,7,310,3.9838709677419355
7999728,5,B0000D0YTK,"Our children, boys and girls, from 11 to 5 love this dvd. It is Sherlock Holmes of a childs dreams. I see that the original series had 26, I wish they were all on dvd. They may be simple or even simplistic rejuvinations of the authors original works, but they may spark our children into reading the full, indepth versions as they grow. :)

Good Clean Fun!",1096761600,9,356,4.313432835820896
7999729,3,B0000D0YTK,"In 1999-2002 Scottish Television Enterprises released 26 anime-influenced episodes that mostly adapted the classic stories of Sherlock Holmes by Conan Doyle. Although intended for children, the animations are enjoyable to adult fans of Sherlock Holmes to see where characters, plot threads, and dialog has been lifted from the original stories. The animations are well done, and the episodes have some surprisingly sophisticated vocabulary, as ""conundrum"" and ""sibling rivalry.""
 Seven of the 26 episodes have been released on two DVDs issued by different companies:
(1) The fall & rise of Sherlock Holmes (released 4/02 by Trimark) contains (TT 1.18):
 The fall and rise of Sherlock Holmes [adaptation: The final problem]
 The crime machine [adaptation: The valley of fear]
 The hounds of the Baskervilles: [adaptation: The Hound of the Baskervilles]
 The sign of four
 also: a multiple-choice game
(2) Out of this world (released 9/03) by UAV contains (TT 1.28):
 The sign of four
 The adventures of the dancing men
 Silver Blaze
 The Gloria Scott
Note that ""The sign of four"" is duplicated. ""Fall,"" ""Crime,"" and ""Hounds"" are the first three episodes;
the other episodes are out-of-sequence.
 The episodes are enjoyable if watched in small doses, for example, for snippets of dialogue from the canon, plus robotics and modernistic stuff like ""DNA scans."" The first episode (""Fall"") will be of greatest interest in transporting Holmes from the 20th to 22nd century.",1085702400,29,1466,5.358078602620087
