8232763,4,B000YGE0KQ,"Although there is plenty of martial arts action the plot is very confusing. The actors show alot more fighting than acting skills. Sort of reminds me of ""Kung fu Hustle"". but with a lot smaller budget.",1371945600,,201,4.611111111111111
8232764,4,B000YGE0KQ,"Ok, so i got this movie knowing it was a cheap movie with good fights.  It's definitely a cheap movie, but the fights are awesome.  The plot is thin, but there's actually more going on than in some Hollywood movies.  The performances are like a bunch of crazy people with a camera, but since this isn't a serious movie (except in the choreography) it works perfectly.  It's an indy action comedy that delivers on both.

Now the reason i gave it a 4 and not a 5 star rating is that it is a cheap movie.  Even though the fights are amazing and infused with more energy than in any three movies from the last five years, they are unrefined.  Face it, you can't afford long rehersals and a crapton of takes to get it just right when you're on pretty much no budget and making a feature length movie in your spare time.

The thing is, this movie is a bunch of martial arts fight scenes (and some gunplay) strung together with just enough plot to work.  And it delivers better than i expected on comedy, charm, and even story.",1344384000,,1020,4.298429319371728
8232765,2,B000YGE0KQ,I did not expect award winning performances but the acting was crap and the movie was not good. I like the stunt people but this did not do it for me. I was ready for the movie to end at a certain point. Some parts were just too silly and the finale was too long. The fighting was good though.,1332374400,2,293,3.9
8232766,3,B000YGE0KQ,"Jeez. Damn. Holy fudge. Any of these exclamations and variations thereof will uttered after sitting through ""Contour,"" the feature-length adrenaline offering of the Stunt People stunt team. Not unlike Team Yamakasi's production of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yamakasi/dp/B000EHPXLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yamakasi</a>, these guys apparently got tired of short films, live demos, and doing work for other movies and decided to try their hand at something more substantial. The result is an absolute orgy of some of literally the best fight scenes I have ever seen...marred by the fact that they're presented via a stupid comedy storyline with an obviously limited budget. These latter aspects almost killed the movie for me, but amazingly, the action choreography alone managed to kick my rating up two stars from what I would've otherwise given the film. Even if, like me, you're not hip to everything the movie offers, you'd still be a fool to miss the advent of the new standard of movie martial artistry.

The story: a thug-for-hire (director Eric Jacobus,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Immortal/dp/B0008ENI0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Immortal</a>) saddled with quirky tourists finds himself caught up in a race against time to recover a video tape that might spell doom for an entire country.

My condensed synopsis doesn't cover the comedy aspects of the movie, but trust me, it's goofy, and not in a way I can easily tolerate. Every now and again, a bit of Jackie Chan buffoonery will hit the spot, but even I don't punish myself with something like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-Hunter/dp/B00008WJE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City Hunter</a>. ""Contour"" goes beyond that one and yanks off the dial, indulging in any number of annoying characters, jarring video inserts, dumb dream sequences, and post-modern humor in general. It seems like many of the jokes weren't even in the script but improvised impromptu, with limited success. Sometimes, the needy production methods become the joke, but good luck getting a laugh out of that either. As far as the minimalist presentation goes, I really can't fault the guys, since I know how difficult it is to get proper funding for an independent movie these days, but I have to admit that it's harder for me to take a film seriously when it doesn't even look professional. Though the cameraman did a decent job, the movie can't shake that home video-type feeling, especially with how the picture gets really grainy whenever there the lighting is less-than-perfect.

Then they fight. And fight. And fight. And fight. At approximately the 65-minute mark, I had forgotten all my aforementioned qualms because I had gotten so into the action that I suddenly didn't want the movie to end - that's how very good these fight scenes are. There's about ten of them, and I kid you not that almost every single one of them is better than its predecessor. The strength of these is partially due to how they were shot - only one or two cameras, with absolutely no unnecessary editing in post-production - but the vast majority of the credit belongs to the performers themselves. Folks like Eric Jacobus, Ed Kahana, Dennis Ruel, Ray Carbonel, Tyler Wang, and Andy Leung (who looks a lot like Byron Mann) don't have too many well-known film credits to their name but it'll be a Hollywood tragedy if they don't receive any in the near future. These guys aren't just tricksters capable of flashy flips and spins but extremely creative film fighters, giving each brawl its own individual pace and style. Almost everyone's packing such a vast repertoire of cool moves, they don't need to repeat any of 'em. Seriously great stuff, here.

I'm not sure why the movie's called what it is, but that hardly matters. It's not often that I can recommend a feature in total disregard of its weaknesses, but ""Contour"" is the worthy exception. If you end up digging the comedy, good for you, but I guarantee it'll be the fights that end up blowing you away. Buy it.",1325462400,,4133,5.363636363636363
8232767,4,B000YGE0KQ,"Wow!  What a cool little flick this is.  To call this movie ""low-budget"" is an understatement, yet it's far more entertaining than most of the billion dollar action epics that come out of Hollywood, and maybe even Hong Kong.  This was made by a group of amateurs (not for long) known as the Stunt People, out of San Francisco.  Not only is the martial arts fast, fluid, and incredible, but the film has a silly, undeniable charm to it.  No, the acting is not that good, but you never get the feeling that they're just ""going through the motions"".  It's got sincerity.

Director Eric Jacobus plays Law, a petty criminal whose failed heist brings him back to his day job as a tour guide.  One of the people on his tour is the visiting Prince of Uruvia (Ed Kahana Jr.), who has lost posession of a videotape that has the potential to bring down the monarchy back home.  If Law can somehow get it, he can score 2 million smackers.  There's a lot more to the plot, but the less you know, the more you'll enjoy it.

Honestly, I think I would've liked this even if it didn't have any fight scenes.  I don't remember too many ""laugh out loud"" scenes, but I also don't remember any point during the film where I wasn't grinning from ear to ear, either.  Any movie that makes up a style (Tae Pho) that teaches you self-defense while eating soup can't possibly be bad, or at least not bad in a bad way.  The acting is actually better than I expected.  Ed Kahana's prince is the most annoying, but he stays in character, and grows on you as the film develops.

The DVD from Indican is loaded with special features, including a Tae Pho instructional video, several interviews and ""making of"" segments.  If you are a fan of fight films, this needs to be seen.  This movie is to action films what ""Clerks"" was to comedies.  Highly Recommended.

Over the past few years, a category of filmmaking has come about referred to often as 'zero budget filmmaking.' I don't know if there are rules to how much (or little) you can spend and still make this category. I have seen them called 'zero budget' up to about $15k. Drama films have been easy to come by in this category, as they don't have to cost too much to make. And with the introduction of the great movie, Primer (done for $7k), sci fi film had its voice. But no one had tried the action film at a high level.....

Enter the Stunt People. A group of stunt persons and fight choreographers located in California that make short films in their spare time and post them online. Contour represents their first broad release full length movie attempt. And what an attempt it is!!!!

The acting is bad, but has its own charm. The director wrote in part for the actors based on things they do/say in real life. And it comes off funny. There are good laughs, both intentional, and not so intentional. I personally like fighters who can't act, but don't try to hard either. Nothing ruins a film more than to have the lead role who is a great action star look into the camera and say 'we have to save the president!' and not have a clue how he is supposed to act. It ruins it for me.

But the fights..... wow the fights.... largely Hapkido, with some Wushu and Escrima mixed in, the fights are amazing. They are literally beating the crap out of each other. I think they said their philosophy was 'hit at 50%, react to the hit at 200%.' There is a lot of chop shot, but with excellent editing, and three respectable long shots during the film. It's really hard to pick a favorite fight amongst them. It has probably the best fight scene with two guys in suits I have ever seen.

The plot is fairly conventional, and serves to really just connect the fights. Then there's the ending..... well, it's an ending.... the director said he was paying homage to Pink Panther movie endings, and I guess on that level, it works.

In short, even though now this is a little pricier under re-release, it's hard to go wrong. It's an incredible representation of what can be done for little to no money. It puts the blockbusters of the same genre to shame. See if you can't find the original release (blue cover), because it was cheaper. If you like this kind of stuff, check out stuntpeople.com for their shorts, and Kwoon as well. Although, of all I have seen so far, Contour is the pinnacle.

8232769,5,B000YGE0KQ,"I cannot even begin to express how awesome this movie is.  If you're a fan of Hong Kong cinema's glory days (commonly referred to as the 80s) then this movie is worth every penny.

The fight scenes and stunts are amazing and it's hard to believe that these guys aren't industry professionals.  The action builds until the films 20 MINUTE FINALE which features four fights going at the same time.

The acting isn't exactly oscar worthy but the performances get the message across.  Contour has a generally fun loving tone to it and the comedy ensures that the movie never gets too heavy.  It's kinda like a good Jackie Chan movie in that it's exciting but still light and entertaining.  There's even an outtake reel that plays after the movie, showing just how much effort went into making this small masterpiece of an actioner.
