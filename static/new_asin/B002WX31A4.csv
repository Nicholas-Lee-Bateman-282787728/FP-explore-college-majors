8383391,2,B002WX31A4,"Pros:
Looks nice

Cons:
Absolutely can't fit around glasses
The colors are off, causing a ""ghosting"" effect.

Trust me, don't get these glasses if you're looking for quality. I got these because they were cheap but I was disappointed when I got them.",1346198400,2,250,4.790697674418604
8383392,1,B002WX31A4,Terrible ghosting! Worst 3D I've ever seen...due to the wrap around style.  Don't EVER buy the wrap arounds!!!! Go with the flat straight type.,1324771200,5,143,4.958333333333333
