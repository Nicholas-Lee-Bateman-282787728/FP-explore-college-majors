8380565,5,B002TPHOAI,"Do you like country music and The Clash?  If you do you'll love this.  This is some really ""close-to-the-bone"" country soul.  It rocks, it pulls at your sentiments, and it, basically, crushes!  First, and foremost, you've got an American Icon country songwriter.  Second, you get the raw performance that jettisons all pretense and Nashville gloss for the real ""meat"" that is the soul of country.  Surprisingly it rocks more like The Clash than Porter or Conway, but it is every bit as true to the heart of what the hell country is all about.  This stuff is pure gold on both the high plane of songwriting extraordinaire and pure honest performance.  I never made this connection until I saw this, but I'm gonna' say it...Billy Joe Shaver and Jason and The Scorchers are kindred souls.  You see I think JATS are the finest American rock band on the country side of American rock and roll(Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers are undisputedly the finest on the absolute rock side) and there is a real connection between them and Billy Joe Shaver.  This guy is the real thing, he is the ultimate survivor and the ultimate songwriter and he comes damn close to the ultimate performer here.  Don't even hesitate for one minute, buy this DVD and really get a glimpse into what the art of music which can transform the angry mob is all about.  This is some really powerful unifying stuff.  Billy Joe Shaver is the king of country and rock and I'll be the first to admit this DVD isn't even his greatest moment (that would be any one of an number of performances with his son Eddie), but it is some real bottled-up magic that reveals enough of the stuff to be pretty self-evident.  Get it, rock out, and feel some emotion.  This is the real deal.",1365811200,,1734,4.566343042071197
8380566,5,B002TPHOAI,"I must say, this is great! This consert does have what I allways miss in most of the musich today, this is raw and honest. Just like it should be. This is now my favorit DVD.",1288396800,2,174,3.861111111111111
8380567,4,B002TPHOAI,"Great image quality, great sound - 100 % recommended.

I have been to many, many Billy Joe Shaver live concerts and can say that this is as close as it gets to the real thing, Billy Joe's story telling in-between songs and all. Since the song list is not here on Amazon, here goes:

Georgia On A Fast Train
Honky Tonk Heroes
What She Said Last Night
The Devil Made Me Do It The First Time
You Wouldn't Know Love (If You Fell In It)
You Asked Me To
Old Chunk Of Coal
When The Fallen Angels Fly
Star of My Heart
Live Forever
If You Don't Love Jesus
Hottest Thing In Town
The Good Ol' USA
Old Crow Town (guest performance by N.C. Lawlor)
Love Is So Sweet
You Can't Beat Jesus Christ

One point deduction for the typos in the song list and that some of the song titles are not quite correct in the credits. However the quality of the recording itself is great, so I'm not too bummed... :-)",1265241600,5,885,4.104046242774566
