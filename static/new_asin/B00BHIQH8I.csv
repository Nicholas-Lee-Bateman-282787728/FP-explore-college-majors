8568496,3,B00BHIQH8I,"I wanted so much to like this movie, but the production quality (especially the audio) is so awful to the point of distraction.  I liked the story concept, though, and it was a fun tale that was clearly written by neopagans for a neopagan audience.  It's one truly redeeming quality is the dubstep-ish soundtrack by S.J. Tucker.",1399334400,,328,4.7368421052631575
8568497,4,B00BHIQH8I,I loved the sound track and this movie way out preformed its budget. The actors worked for free and provided their own costumes.,1379635200,,128,4.608695652173913
8568498,1,B00BHIQH8I,"The best thing about this video was the theme song and Becca Kelso. The rest was awful! I was sorry Becca was even in it. She's great, but the rest was poor, poor, poor!",1370908800,,169,4.0
8568499,5,B00BHIQH8I,"I first bought this film because I needed another DVD case but, after a crazy mishap between a pencil sharpener, eels, and a box of condoms, I found myself watching the film. I'm unsure if it was my curiosity with dreadlocks or my distrust of Christian theology but I found the film... educational. I give the film 5 stars for great cinematography, acting, and for the comprehensive features and usability the rituals rituals in Ember Days.",1369958400,,440,4.802631578947368
8568500,4,B00BHIQH8I,I loved it. I have to say after watching this movie I have seen great improvements from Sean Argo as a director. I especially enjoyed the snowfall scenes and  Jason Boltons acting He was super this being his first film. Also that guy in the wild hunt Roger Johnson is super sexy lol.
