4013749,5,B002YMWPQ4,"I really enjoyed this movie - great performance by Robin Wright Penn -  It was kind of quirky and different, but well done!",1270857600,,123,4.3478260869565215
4013750,5,B002YMWPQ4,"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee is the story of how Pippa Lee went from a runaway wild child in her youth to a serene, devoted wife and mother with a seemingly perfect life as an adult; everything seems to be going perfect for Pippa until her neighbors son, Chris who is played by a very handsome and clean shaved Keanu Reeves comes into her life and she finds out about her husband and best friend aren't perfect; The film looks great and the story line is ok  but does tend to drag when going back to Pippa Lee's youth. The acting is good, especially from Robin Wright Penn and Keanu Reeves, but the film would have been much more interesting if it had spent more time focusing on the budding romance between the Keanu Reeves and Robin Wright Penn's characters and left the past in the past.",1268697600,,792,4.351351351351352
4013751,4,B002YMWPQ4,"How many of us look back at our lives and reflect on our wild times and what it took to settle down? Most often, we might think it is luck that has brought us this far. And, when we found our life, were we happy, was this the life we really wanted or did we settle for this safer life of ours?

Pippa Lee, played by Robin Wright is fifty. Her husband, Alan Arkin, is thirty years older. They have moved from New York City to a retirement community in Connecticut. This is presumably to make life easier for both of them. However, Pippa is not happy, she does not have much to do now and we wonder, who made this decision to move?  She had met her husband years ago when she was at the end of her wild drug, hippie stage and he had saved her. They had two children and were happy. Or were they? Pippa starts to sleep walk, she is filled with tension and stress her therapist tells her- she needs a hobby. She takes up pottery and is kicked out of class for calling the instructor names. She is unsettled and her past life catches up with her. Her mother who was obsessed with her as well as obsessed with the Dexedrine she was taking, her life with her aunt after she ran away from home, and the life she has now.  She uncovers an interesting relationship of her husbands and finds one for herself.  Pippa is on her way to finding her life.

This film written and directed by Rebecca Miller is filled with remarkable characters and actors ""Zoe Kazan as Pippa's daughter, Grace, a headstrong photojournalist; Robin Wright as Pippa's kindhearted lesbian aunt Trish; and Julianne Moore as Trish's ferocious lover Kat, who enlists Pippa to pose with another woman for sadomasochist photos. Winona Ryder as Pippa's histrionic best friend, Sandra, and Shirley Knight as her blowzy next-door neighbor Dot, are also memorable. Keanu Reeves, his chest tattooed with a portrait of Jesus, plays Dot's glum, compulsively honest son.""  Stephen Holden

This is a film of a marriage that has come and gone, the ups and downs and the fun and the anger. Most of us have been there and unsettling is the most dramatic. What will happen, how will it end, you never know.

Highly Recommended.  prisrob 03-15-10

4013752,5,B002YMWPQ4,"My husband picked up this DVD on a whim, thinking I might like it, and he was right! ""The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"" is a thoughtful, leisurely-paced drama about a woman who though anchored in a stable relationship in the present, is haunted by her turbulent past. Robin Wright Penn plays Pippa Lee, a sort of prim and proper wife to an aging yet indomitable older man, Herb (Alan Arkin). The couple have recently moved to a retirement community, though Herb, who has already suffered previous heart attacks, refuses to buckle down and lead a quiet life. Pippa who is 30 years younger than Herb, tries her utmost to take care of her husband, despite his protestations and suffers from exhaustion, finding herself spacing out, binge eating in the middle of the night (but having no recollections of it later), and finds herself experiencing flashback moments of her younger days.

The movie flows well between the past and the present. We see baby Pippa being initially shunned by her mother Suky (Maria Bello) for being overly hairy as an infant, and how this relationship changes over time. As Pippa grows (the teenage Pippa is played by Gossip Girl's Blake Lively), a close relationship forms between Suky and her daughter, but Suky's own deteriorating mental health and over-dependence on anti-depressants causes a friction in their relationship. Pippa runs away, meeting interesting characters along the way - photographer (Julianne Moore), successful publisher Herb (Arkin),co-dependent friend (Winona Ryder in a great supporting role), and a store clerk (Keanu Reeves). Having settled down to a sedate married life, Pippa ponders her life's purpose, and some startling revelations throw her scheduled life off-balance.

Robin Wright delivers a finely nuanced performance, and the excellent supporting cast make this movie an above average viewing experience. There is a great deal of character development, insights, and self-introspection here - a woman who has been so driven to care for others (husband, son, daughter), that she has lost her own identity along the way, choosing to 'settle' instead. Will Pippa Lee set herself free? The movie credibly addresses this question and the compelling performances by the lead actress and supporting cast make it a worthwhile watch.",1267574400,19,2285,5.206521739130435
4013753,5,B002YMWPQ4,"In a male-dominated industry like Hollywood, it is refreshing once in a while to watch a movie in which the main character is a woman (Robin Wright). It is additionally rewarding - a bonus, if you will -- if the director is also a woman (Rebecca Miller, who wrote the story). The result, ""The Private Lives of Pippa Lee,"" is satisfying and remarkable. This film touches you and stays with you.

The story is about Pippa Sarkissian (Wright) - who would later become Pippa Lee --, an attractive woman with a troubled past, reaching middle age, who is trying to get her life together. Her mother Suky (the always dependable Maria Bello) was moody and addicted to antidepressants, and was repulsed by Pippa when she was born, because she was hairy. However, this situation improved throughout the years, and Suky got very attached to Pippa. Unfortunately, her mother's problems persisted, and Pippa eventually had to leave home. After some time living carelessly by herself, she finds Herb Lee (Alan Arkin), a man thirty years her senior, who happens to be a successful publisher. They get married and life appears to be good for everyone. That is, until Pippa's past begins haunting her -- a situation that is worsened by her current problems.

This is a real life drama, spiked with humor, especially provided by Wynona Ryder, in a surprising supporting role. It examines a woman's life that ""keeps swinging back and forth from generation to generation, getting it wrong."" Robin Wright shines as Pippa Lee, and Arkin as her husband. The magnificent cast also includes Blake Lively (as Pippa in her younger years) Monica Bellucci, Julianne Moore, Shirley Knight, and Keanu Reeves. The Blu-ray edition includes commentaries by Wright and Miller, and interviews with Wright, Arkin, and Lively. (USA, 2009, color, 98 min plus additional materials)

4013754,4,B002YMWPQ4,"Screen Media hardly ever puts any money into their BDs (as is the case here again) but Rebecca Miller put together a good story told in a less than simple way.

The story follows the life (if told lineally) of a woman from birth to her rebirth as an older woman (Robin Wright). Along this journey we jump back and forth in her time line as we see the different lives she has led. Mario Bello competently played her drug addled mother, Alan Arkin her much older husband, with some interesting short roles from Monica Belucci and Winona Ryder. The criticism I have read regarding confusion and casting choices to play the same person I can see having some validity, but I enjoyed the challenge of figuring things out while watching this. Keanu is once again picked to play a non-emotional role and he does it fine. The Blu quality is standard at times, above average in others. The vehicle motion scenes are difficult to figure out though, as they chose to film with the windows rolled up in each scene so the resulting reflections are always blurring the scenes - really the only shortcoming of the Blu quality. The DTS gets used infrequently and the special feature of interviews from a screening lasts only a few minutes and is forgettable. The commentary was adequate but as admitted by Wright - a little awkward to do at times.

You would be getting this for the performances alone, but I do not think there would be any significant disappointment in the BD either. No region coding listed, English and Spanish subs only.",1267315200,6,1524,4.619926199261992
4013755,3,B002YMWPQ4,"""The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"" is about the life of Pippa Lee (Robin Wright Penn), devoted wife married to a successful publisher Herb Lee (Alan Arkin). When her husband (30 years older than Pippa) decides to move from New York to a suburban retirement community, she slowly heads toward a nervous breakdown, unbeknown to other family members. The 98-minute film is written and directed by Rebecca Miller (""The Ballad of Jack and Rose""), adapted from her own book of the same title which I have not read.

Meet 50-year-old Pippa Lee, adored by everyone, a ""mystery"" and ""enigma."" As the main story unfolds describing Pippa's erratic behaviors in her new home, she recounts her days as a young woman Pippa Sarkissian, told in flashbacks, up to the moment she meets and marries Herb. The flashbacks consist of episodes about her emotionally unstable mother, her running away from home, her taking ""photos"" at her aunt's home, and so on. Through the repeated flashbacks we are to know more about the life of Pippa, and in the present time she meets inscrutable 35-year-old Chris (Keanu Reeves), with whom she develops a romantic attachment.

The greatest asset of the film is Robin Wright Penn's strong performance as Pippa, without which the film might have been a mess. The impressive cast also includes Alan Arkin, Keanu Reeves, Julianne Moore, Maria Bello, Monica Bellucci, Wynona Ryder and Blake Lively as young Pippa, and they all did a fine job.

Most episodes (of flashbacks and the main plot alike) are well-written and believable, but presented as a whole, they don't add up to much. So who is Pippa Lee? What does she want to do? I tried to like the film and Pippa (and I like Robin Wright Penn), but sorry, I couldn't bring myself to get interested in her story. Too frequent flashbacks of her life disrupt the narrative, affecting character development. Voiceovers are added when Robin Wright Penn's superb acting tells you everything. Given the subject matter of ""The Private Lives of Pippa Lee,"" the anecdotal nature of the narrative is understandable, but characters are too many, and some events here are too melodramatic, sometimes too good to be true.

Rebecca Miller's film has a unique charm of its own, with leisured pace and accurate eye for details, as well as its quirky sense of humor. Though it includes serious issues, the film itself is never too serious. ""The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"" is not everyone's taste, but it is worth a look for the impressive acting from the cast.",1266624000,3,2505,4.845794392523365
4013756,5,B002YMWPQ4,"No, this won't win an AA for Best Picture, but it was a film that touched my heart and soul. Pippa is a ""doer"", someone who has always taken care of others, rather than herself. I know the situation! The entire cast does a more than credible job of acting and I enjoyed everyone's performances. I do wish that they had left out the smoking, except that it was correctly depicted as part of the cause of Pippa's mental illness and drug abuse.",1264377600,,441,4.325301204819277
4013757,4,B002YMWPQ4,"This is a nice little unspectacular movie that I watched a few weeks ago. It left me a little puzzled, but with an essentially positive feeling. My reservations were mainly based on a technicality (really?), as follows: we follow the unspectacular life of a woman from her childhood to her middle ages (40s maybe?). The whole thing is set somewhere in the NE of the US, maybe all of it in Connecticut, I am not sure. The woman is played by 3 actresses: a girl for childhood (with a drug addict hysteric played by a great Maria Bello as her mother), a young woman as her incarnation as a wild young woman (the actress seems to be well known, but I did not know her), and then Robin Hood (Wright Penn?) or whatever her name is as the middle life version of Pippa. We get bits and pieces of Pippa's life from various stages of her life. From childhood in a 'dysfunctional family' to young adulthood as a dysfunctional young adult to a dysfunctional marriage with a much older man in her mid-life period. And what troubled me is this: the woman's 3 incarnations look nothing like similar to each other. This might work if there is a straightforward narrative, but if the story jumps back and forth, wouldn't one think that some probability in casting might be useful? The director apparently did not think so.
The movie has a prominent cast, with a superhysterical Wynona Ryder as marriage breaking adulteress snatching Wright's hubby Alan Arkin (you were just waiting for me to go to my grave! I never heard a better excuse for late life infidelity) and a super-convincing convenience store manager Keanu Reeves as midlife crisis-ridden wife's revengeful love interest. Lovely but a little odd.
Puzzling: no other reviews yet?",1263686400,2,1723,4.708609271523179

All of these dysfunctional characters come together at the end to, perhaps, give a new start, late in life, to Pippa Lee.  There is so much going on that this is the second time I see this picture.
