We who love the original Montalbano may have had doubts about this new series, at first, but it is such a wonderfully done, fresh look at our most beloved detective, complete with the setting we also love, it must be continued.  I don't have enough good words to share about it... so, see for yourself, and you will agree.
Well done!  Buono!",1523059200,,432,4.2560975609756095

Loving close-ups of the meals being served, beautiful landscapes and architecture.  Okay the detectives all look about fourteen, but Sicily, o my.",1520467200,,245,5.5675675675675675
