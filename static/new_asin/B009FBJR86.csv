8540914,5,B009FBJR86,A few of us slaughtered our own beef without prior experience(I've cleaned whitetail deer but going to a 800+ lb cow is like going from a house cat to an elephant).  It went well but there are alot of shortcuts to 'cuts'...pun intended.  The butcher explains things when needed and makes sure you can see all the progress.  Excellent how-to step by step DVD.  A must for the first timers.,1397433600,,388,4.5
