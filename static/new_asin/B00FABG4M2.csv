5973009,5,B00FABG4M2,"Lucrezia Borgia in one of Donizetti's better works, with a fine, melodic score and a plot that is better than most of its competition. Lucrezia herself was an historic person, but one whose invitation to dinner was probably best refused. Here is a performance that largely realizes the potential  of the opera, but with a very few aspects that nearly dropped one star from the rating. overall though, with the minor quibbles addressed below, this is a well realized performance of a neglected opera, chock full of melody.

Its strengths are many, beginning with a fine young tenor, Michael Fabiano. His is a big voice with an even production from top to bottom, and one of the smoothest passagios I have heard since Bergonzi. And while this performance will not see him nominated for an acting award, I suspect that based on what I saw here, that aspect of his work will improve.

Similarly, Vitalij Kowaljow as Duke Alfonso brings a really big and dark sound to the role. He posseses a splendid top and is secure throughout the range. There are some nice dramatic moments, too. Bravo!

Elizabeth DeShong sings the en travesti role of Maffio Orsini in splendid style. This young singer has a future, with a deep rich bottom and an extended top, and seems at ease on stage.

Which brings me to Renee Fleming. By her own admission, she is not a bel canto specialist and it shows, particularly with her entrance where the voice sounds tired and a bit forced. She quickly recovers and does a credible job with the balance of the score. But there is for me a sense of ... discomfort on her part, like maybe she'd rather be doing Rosenkavalier? This aspect of the performance was a bit off putting, but not enough to ruin my enjoyment of the opera.

Staging is mostly traditional, but the costumes were a bit over the top and the hair stylist should be banned from the theatre, expecially as far as the male singers (including Maffeo's) are concerned. I note without comment that the stage director,John Pascoe, has introduced a homosexual relationship between Gennaro and Maffeo, a bit intense at one part, which is absent in Felice Romani's libretto.

The chorus do a fine job, with lots of interaction, which increases the dramatic integrity of the stage business. Riccardo Frizza, one of my personal favorites for this kind of opera does a splendid job from the pit.

Disc quality is superb, with crisp picture and marvellous sound in the DTS mode. Extras include interviews with Fleming, Fabiano and DeShong. Subtitles abound. This is a 2 disc set, with the entire opera, uncut as far as I could tell, on disc 1, and the extras on disc 2.

There is 1 competing disc from Bergamo's Donizetti Festival. In my opinion, with the minor quibbles meantioned above, this disc eclipses the competition. Lucrezia is not performed as much as some of Donizetti's other works, but it is one of his better efforts and I think that potential buyers will enjoy it.",1383350400,16,2947,4.717898832684825
5973010,5,B00FABG4M2,"Just watched this Lucrezia Borgia starring Rene Flemin and Michael Fabiano from my local PBS station in HD. I am very excited about the upcoming blu ray disc.

When we talk about Donizetti's operas, we are expecting unbelievably beautiful arias and duets that show off their principal singers. With music like that, who cares about the somewhat ridiculous plots. Lucrezia Borgia is one of such Donizetti's masterpieces. The music shone in the hands (or voices) of the great artists from San Francisco Opera, which was exemplified by Elizabeth DeShong's unforgettable drinking song!

When Rene Flemin is in the cast, we are expecting solid singing and acting in a beautiful and gracious leading lady. This is exactly what we get with this production.  Rene Flemin's problem is that she is consistently perfect in almost all the roles she undertakes that such a high standard performance is no longer surprising.

What truly surprised me is the tenor Michael Fabiano. It is so refreshing to finally see a ringing tenor with such a beautiful and solid voice nowadays.  Michael Fabiano not only shone in the singing department, his acting was up there shoulder to shoulder with the leading lady. If that is not enough, the tenor is surely one of the most handsome leading men in opera. Unfortunately, the costume designer got carried away with the tenor's good look by showing off his bare chest too much too often.

What I feel most refreshing is the ""traditional""production. I have seen too many operas ruined by cheap modernization. Here we get authentic and splendid costumes in the renaissance style. The sets were majestic and breathtaking. With many blu ray discs having the operas staging around modern day hospitals and hotel lobbies, I am so excited to be able to add this almost perfect opera to my collection.",1380844800,48,1817,4.98019801980198

The performance is enjoyable enough with a largely young cast; however, Renee Fleming, wonderful singer though she is in other types of music, rarely convinces me as a natural choice for Donizetti. Her tone is rather smoky, and she scoops and swoons around the notes constantly; while her approach to decorations seems quite out of style to my ears. In addition, she is dressed in a series of increasingly outlandish costumes that jar with those of her colleagues around her. Had the central character been cast differently, the whole production might have taken off in a way that it never quite does here. Approach with caution, unless you are an unreserved fan of Ms Fleming.",1402444800,,796,5.037878787878788
5973021,1,B00FABG4M2,"I fell asleep two times while watching this lifeless  performance.  All the singers appeared to be walking through the opera. There was really no interaction amongst the characters, except for the ""love scene"" between Gennaro and Maffio. I'm sure the director insisted on this scene to satisfy the San Francisco audience. I was very disappointed in Renee Fleming's performance both singing and acting. Her flat note at the end of Act I was embarrassing to say the least. The large set with steps to nowhere  prevented any coherence of plot. This is probably the worst operatic performance on DVD I have ever had the misfortune to see. I wish I could get my money back.",1396742400,5,668,4.791304347826087
5973022,3,B00FABG4M2,"Excelllent performance, well sung and well conducted. Ridiculous and poor direction, ridiculous and poor scenery, ridiculous and poor designs !",1393718400,,143,6.2
5973023,3,B00FABG4M2,"I would have loved to totally enjoy this production.  After all, Donizetti is my favorite composer, and I cherish going to San Francisco Opera when I can afford to.  And this DVD is a true souvenir of SF Opera, obtained from the gift shop at War Memorial Opera House no less (though attending Barber of Seville at the time).  The point being, if it weren't for all that mental baggage (read: cognitive dissonance), I'd probably have to admit this Lucrezia is just a little substandard.

Just about everything in this production is provincial, not that provincial is bad ... just that we are talking about one of the greatest opera companies in the world.  And this is little more than what you'd expect from an average opera company in any metropolitan area.  Frankly, the singing is barely better than competent.  The star of the show, Renee Fleming, is not well-suited to the style--by her own admission.  (I would not have discerned her status as an operatic superstar from this performance.)  Of course, she was not terrible, nothing is terrible, but neither is anything here a 'revelation' as sometimes happens.  The stage scenery is, how shall we say, traditionalesque, better than one might expect ... but many of the costumes look like they hopped straight out of a comic book.  Yes, some of the costuming was the only truly bad thing in this production, strange and garish even in the context of make-believe.

But I loathe to criticize too harshly, because I love live opera and hope they'll continue to roll them out.  It is an OK watch;  I was just surprised something so mundane came out of SFOpera.  Positive note:  the subtitles are larger than most other Blu-rays, which is welcome.  (Of course, they're nowhere the size of regular DVDs.)",1392336000,6,1754,4.793333333333333
5973024,4,B00FABG4M2,"After a lapse of almost 178 years, the San Francisco Opera brought Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia to the stage, with star soprano Renee Fleming in the title role. Lucrezia Borgia had been a showcase role for bel canto experts like Caballe, Gencer, among others.  The question of what constitutes great bel canto coloratura comes to mind. There are expert bel canto sopranos with uncanny ability to toss off trills, roulades, embellishments, and interpolated high notes with ease.  But for really effective bel canto singing, it is the ability to sing, apart from all the notes, with the brilliance and passion in some of them that turn florid writing into searing drama or, in the case of comedy, gravity-defying delight.

Fleming was already 52 when this was performed. Visually the casting of Fleming as the dame fatale is highly effective for she not only looked fabulous onstage but also moved with feeling. Her looks complimented that of Michael Fabiano who portrayed her lost son Gennaro, and it is a visually convincing pair of mother and son.  If her coloratura lacked some of the high flying escapades that raised eyebrows on her 1999 recording of the opera's third act finale, it nonetheless abounded in steadiness, a number of admirably executed trills, and vocal beauty. Fleming capped Act 1 with a high D-flat, but the singing lacked the tonal brilliance and inner tension requisite for a truly great Lucrezia.

Indeed, in this production, Fleming's vocal portrayal was more than occasionally eclipsed by the sensational singing of tenor Michael Fabiano and mezzo-soprano Elizabeth DeShong as Gennaro's soldier lover, Maffio Orsini.

Fabiano possesses a beautiful, youthful tenor equally abundant in light, masculine heft and tonal brilliance. In addition to a technical surety and impeccable legato that seem ideal for bel canto, he also looks wonderful onstage.  If only his acting can be more alive and impassioned, it would have been a full-score performance.

Young American mezzo DeShong, diminutive in stature with less than 5 feet, sings like a vocal giant. Her lowest notes have body and depth, the midrange is especially rich, and she propels her secure, full, and rounded highs with aplomb. Her duet with Fabiano at the start of Act 3 was sensational, and the second verse of the famous ""Brindisi"" a cheer-eliciting tour de force. Bass Vitalij Kowaljow's Duke Alfonso was not far behind these two. His Act 1 singing was a bit wooden, but the voice soon warmed to produce a dark, authoritative portrayal.

Pascoe's direction, sets, and costumes conjure up an aura of grand gold flourishes. Riccardo Frizza's San Francisco Opera debut finds him in somewhat erratic pacing, as many of his tempi lacked pliancy. He drove singers and orchestra in Act 2. Thankfully, the freneticism eased up in the finale of Act 3, allowing as much of a sense of tragedy as Fleming was capable of generating to sink in.

For the young performers Fabiano and DeShong, 4.5 stars.",1389052800,3,2976,5.067484662576687
5973025,5,B00FABG4M2,"Renee Fleming sang this opera in Italy in the 1990s and was booed and tormented on opening night. She vowed never to sing it again, and I am so glad she did. I have the cds from La Scala, and this is better, only beacuse she is older and wiser and better at bel canto's demands, fioriture, legato lines etc. Her subsequent performances were loudly applauded...La Scala has sufferd for this disgrace..no one will sing there of any note. Lool at the DVDs for La Scala..Devia, Antonacci, Dessai..very good, but not Renee Fleming.

She can sometimes over extend, especilly in a glottal lower register that is best left alone. Otherwise, she knows all about her strengths and they are all here for the discerning opera lover to see and hear. Her ""Come bello"" reminds me of Callas but then it is Renee's own as she delves into its depths with seriousness and a kind of early madness.

Dull, camp opera? By no means! There are numerous magnificent moments of singing and drama as well. The libretto is very lenient toward  Lucrezia's sins, but we do get that early plot favorite, wife-accused-of adultry archetypal center to the story. The ending is fabulous, the duets are harsh, cold, as they should be. Lucrezia and her husband are killers. but Lucrezia herself.... we feel for her through her oft poisoned son, and the final ""Era desso il figlio mio.."" stands out as one of the finest moments in Fleming's career as a singer. I would love to see her ""Il pIrata"" by Bellini dug up and shown. It is magnificvent as well. But we have Lucrezia Borgia, a stumbling block that is one the most fortunate I can ever think of in opera.
The rest of the cast..thrilling and finally up to Renee's calibre of singing. Brava Renee!!",1388188800,3,1715,4.616393442622951
5973026,5,B00FABG4M2,"I throughly enjoyed watching and listening to this DVD.  As always, the San Francisco Opera mounted a good production and hired an outstanding cast.",1387238400,2,148,5.166666666666667
5973027,4,B00FABG4M2,"Donizetti's ""Lucrezia Borgia"" is not for those new to Italian opera. The plot is absolutely absurd, and the bel canto music, though lovely and accessible, can seem a bit threadbare compared to the work of later composers. But for those interested in casting a wider net after experiencing all the familiar chestnuts (including the composer's ""Lucia di Lammermoor""), this disc is an easy recommendation.

The vocal performances are, for the most part, excellent. Vitalij Kowaljow as Lucrezia's jealous husband uses his dark, fluid voice to good effect, conveying evil with ease. The younger singers, Michael Fabiano and Elizabeth DeShong, provide hope for the future of opera. In her trouser role, DeShong displays incredible range and facility (and, dare I say it, spunk), and Fabiano shows with every phrase why he's one the most exciting lirico-spinto tenors currently on world stages. You might remember him as the intense participant in ""The Audition,"" a documentary about the Metropolitan Opera Auditions, of which he was one of the winners in 2007. This performance of ""Lucrezia Borgia"" took place about four years after that and was his debut at San Francisco Opera.

Then we come to Renee Fleming, our Lucrezia here. She makes many beautiful sounds, but she's no coloratura soprano, so those expecting that sort of approach will be disappointed, particularly in her labored runs. To her credit, she compensates by making good use of her chest voice for effect. Then there's her acting. At best, it's generalized; at worst, a facial expression will remind you of Carol Burnett playing a seductress in one of her skits. An evil, scheming femme fatale is simply not in Fleming's toolkit. All that said, I enjoyed the performance. It remains a gorgeous voice and the closest we now have to that of Montserrat Caballe, a previous Lucrezia, in her middle years.

The staging is traditional and all the better for it. I'm not against modern productions -- just those, in fashion now, that add no new insights and aim purely for shock value or convey a distaste for the original work. Let's face it -- there are few psychological depths to plumb in ""Lucrezia Borgia,"" despite the twisted mother-son dynamic at its core. Traditional works best here. The costumes are not quite so traditional, as evidenced by Fabiano's low-cut outfits, which seem designed to expose plentiful male cleavage.

Surprisingly for such a rarely performed work, there is already another Blu-ray available, and it happens to be of a modern production:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lucrezia-Borgia-Blu-ray/dp/B006CAXOJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lucrezia Borgia [Blu-ray</a>]. It stars Edita Gruberova, a renowned coloratura soprano in the twilight of her career. Although the seams in her voice are apparent at this late stage, she's much more passionate than Fleming and fearlessly takes vocal risks (you'll hear some ugly notes here and there that Fleming wouldn't dream of ever allowing to escape her throat). She also has an excellent tenor in Pavol Breslik and a more exciting conductor, Bertrand de Billy. If you find yourself loving ""Lucrezia Borgia,"" then this would be next on your list. It's too bad that Mariella Devia's Lucrezia -- based on the evidence of online clips, the best of all -- has not been released on disc.

There's nothing to fault in the high definition image or direction of the San Francisco Opera performance. The sound is very good, although I sensed a bit of congestion at midrange. This performance was expertly spliced together from several. I only detected what appeared to be one splice jump in Fleming's final scene.

This disc, which I received a review copy of, includes some enjoyable bonus features, although you're not likely to view them more than once. They consist of short interviews with Fleming (who provides some interesting insights), Fabiano and DeShong, plus a time-lapse video of the set change from this production to ""Turandot"" that will only increase your appreciation for all the hard work that takes place behind the scenes.",1387065600,5,4105,5.259541984732825
5973028,5,B00FABG4M2,"Lucrezia Borgia is my kind of opera. Bursting with beautiful melodies, brimming  with melodramatic action, fast and furious, crammed with georgous costumes and impressive sets, filled with brilliant singing by the four stars and brilliant teamwork of the whole cast. This is grand Grand Opera. This was Donizetti's 40th of ~70 (65 completed) operas and was his fifth of 1833. He was a workaholic with new themes constantly flowing from his creative spirit. But instead of honing, shaping, improving and perfecting his outpourings he moved on to the next project.
Lucrezia was a major success in his lifetime. He was drawn to Victor Hugo's popular play and particularly by the last scene in which Lucrezia has six coffins revealed to the intended victims toward the end of the dinner party. But the Milan censors didn't allow the coffins at the premiere of the opera and the opera had no end of censor problems where ever it was produced. But from it's opening at La Scala Dec. 26, 1833 till about the end of the century it was extremely popular worldwide. After 1900 the taste for bel canto waned and it with most of his other works and those of Rossini and Bellini were forgotten. In my youth in the 40s and 50s only three Donizetti operas were known; Lucia, Elixir of love and Daughter of the Regimant (only one Rossini - Barber of Seville).
With the revival of interest in Bel Canto made popular by Maria Callas in the 50's and then by Sutherland and Caballe', this opera along many other of his forgotten gems are being aired again.
Lucrezia is a bel canto opera and needs a good bel canto soprano to carry it. And in this case it does. Renee Flemming did much bel canto early in her career but has done a rich variety of other roles since. She certainly established her canto creds in Rossini's Armida as well as many others. In Lucrezia I was struck yet again by her superb breath control. In the final cabeletta (cut later by Donizetti but usually restored) she radiates ease of control. I compared it with the only other viable DVD that of Sutherland and Kraus in 1980 Royal Opera House production. Sutherland long past vocal prime still controlled the voice very well. If you've got it; you've got it and both  Sutherland and Fleming got it. (In her prime Sutherland was unbeatable by anyone.)
Michael Fabiano has a beautiful, well managed tenor and as the young son Gennaro showed voice control and acting ability. A good career is ahead for him.
As Duke Alfonso, Lucrezia's Fourth husband, Vitalij Kowaljow had a most resonant and beautifully displayed bass. He was majestic in acting and singing
I was a little disappointed with the Maffio Orsini of Elizabeth De Shong.  Not that she can't sing (she can and very well) but this is not the part for her. She is supposed to be a part of the ""young fellows"" gang; rebel youths out for fun and adventure. But when they were all together she looked like the runt of the litter; the one that didn't get a teat (in farmer terminology). The role can be done and done well as Anne Howells did in the Sutherland - Kraus 1980 production. She was as tall as the others and looked like one of the ""boys"" and didn't have the ""squeekie"" quality to her voice.
One of the prior reviwers made mention of a supposed ""sexual"" conotation in regard to Maffeo and Gennaro. I did not see that at all .  What I saw was simply ""male bonding"". I grew up in the 40s and 50s where there was much male bonding in story, music and entertainment: Tonto and Lone Ranger, Batman and Robin, Prince Valiant and the Round Table Knights etc and the First World War song ""My Buddy"" etc etc. None of this had a sexual conotation to it. I had lots of buddies in school. Of course as a kid there was always some hard-shell Baptist of Calvinist scold who saw evil in everything. Anything that was pleasant or beautiful or enjoyable was inherently bad for you. If you were smiling you were sining. That included danse, movies, and opera too. I had thought we were over that sort of thing. Oh well, I think of them as young buddies and that's in the script.
All in all, it's a wonderful operatic experience.",1386892800,20,4124,4.5464333781965
5973029,2,B00FABG4M2,"Two stars for Rene Fleming alone (she certainly deserves five or more, but there are so many other persons and things to rate); her humorless spouse Kowaljow acquits himself allright with the singing, Fabiano as Gennaro a bit less so (compare Breslik's splendid acting and singing in Loys Munich production), de Shong is just a pretty-voiced plain woman dressed as a male braggart (what a contrast with Alice Cootes impersonation of Maffio Orsini in the Munich performance!). The theatrical design is unimaginative and drab, the clothings show little difference in color, and the best that can be said for the orchestra is that it never draws attention to itself. At any rate, the story is narrated in such a way that, for all its farfetchedness, it is understandable throughout. Thus, watching this boring performance prepares one for the excitement of the Munich BD.

5973030,5,B00FABG4M2,"This release heralds the start of a potential series created by the partnership recently agreed between Euroarts and the San Francisco Opera. The chosen opera to start this joint venture is an interesting choice being a combination of an established favourite composer but an opera that has more public awareness than familiarity.

The title role has been given to Renee Fleming thus guaranteeing a considerable and faithful following. The supporting roles have been given to lesser names who clearly have potential, many realised on this night of the recording. The role to be fulfilled by Euroarts will be covered later in in this review.

Lucrezia Borgia is a reliable historical dramatic subject by a composer of considerable repute both as a composer of comic opera, and more seriously intentioned historical opera such as this. The convoluted plot involves a vindictive mother, her lost and recovered child, mistaken identities, revenge and tragic consequences. Furthermore, the period and setting gives the producer ample opportunities to justify extravagant costumes with reason. Thus the scene is set and, unless one is seriously biased about such matters, the combination of such melodramatic drama and extravaganza is convincingly delivered in this production.

The musical criteria are also very promising. The stand-out performances on this occasion are those by Michael Fabiano as Gennaro, the lost son. Fabiano has a ringing voice throughout the range but compromised by limited acting abilities. His dearest friend in the plot is Maffio Orsini, sung by Elizabeth DeShong in a cross-over role with accuracy, passion and conviction. These two roles are therefore very successful musically and make a convincing partnership.

Renee Fleming, who has extended herself beyond her normal repertoire here, delivers a good professional performance in the title role but even her most ardent admirers would question whether she is really best suited to such a vocal demand in this style. Others who specialise in such parts in terms of vocal range and timbre simply have more expertise in such roles. (Consider Joan Sutherland or Edita Gruberova in earlier generations for example). The other supporting roles, without naming all the cast individually, are all of good and enjoyable standard.

The orchestra under the expert guidance of Riccardo Frizzi is excellent and it is obvious that the audience on this occasion was thoroughly satisfied and supportive. This is an important consideration and is readily conveyed by the recording.

The technical side of the disc is a complete triumph providing excellent camera work, imaging and sound. The latter is presented in both DTS 5.1 and stereo. There is the usual bonus material of artist interviews which, though entertaining, is unlikely to be a deciding factor.

In conclusion I would suggest that this is a very competitive issue of this opera within the current choice as it offers traditional production values, good singing by a believable cast in terms of relative ages, satisfactory acting and fine orchestral support under a good leadership from an experienced conductor. The presentation on disc by Euroarts is excellent without compromise. In general terms this is probably the best current option as regards purchasing this opera given these technical standards.

I would therefore suggest that this disc is worthy of serious consideration as an interim purchase but may not be the ultimate choice in the long term future.",1385251200,,3491,5.346083788706739

8613761,4,B00FABG4M2,"I enjoyed this very much. The pleasant surprise was Fabiano, whom I'd never heard of--good sound and decent acting. Fleming was her reliable self. DeShong (Orsini) has a good voice but doesn't project it very well. Kowaljow (Alfonso) was a bit disappointing in his great double aria, but did well in his scenes with Fleming. The opening scene with stairs--to display the chorus I suppose--strained credibility as a place where Gennaro would take a nap. I've always pictured that scene in some relatively large palace reception room. Overall the scenery and costumes were fine.",1440028800,,576,5.138297872340425
8613762,3,B00FABG4M2,"Donizetti's Lucrezia is the reverse Rigoletto and both operas are based on plays by Hugo. A vicious woman but at the same time a loving mother manages by her evil scheming to get her beloved son poisoned even twice. Like Rigoletto, Lucrezia has to be a real villain to highlight the love for her son, the only beautiful thing in her cold and superficial Machiavelli world obsessed with power. The production is okay, no fancy modernizations to take the focus away from the song and the music. The props and the costumes are (sort of) renaissance and function well, with the exception of Mrs. Fleming's  hairdo and mint green dress that make her look like a fifties starlet. There might be some idea in portraying her as a vicious Hollywood diva, but Fleming doesn't really pull it off. She is more Grace Kelly than Joan Crawford and not bitchy enough. In comparison with Sutherland and Gruberova she falls short. The two ladies might not have been so physically attractive but they where better as villains. Their crystal clear coloratura voice, which they preserved into their sixties, seemed better suited for the role, than Fleming who doesn't sound quite at ease in this very high technical bel canto part.",1439769600,,1210,4.8173076923076925
