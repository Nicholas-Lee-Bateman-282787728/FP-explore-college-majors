7902896,3,B000003K91,"Michael Eddington (Kenneth Marshall), was the former Starfleet Security Chief, who betrayed Sisko (Avery Brooks) and joined the Maquis in ""For the Cause,"" on the previous season of ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.""  This act of treason has stuck in Sisko's craw for a long time and when they cross paths again in Episode 111, ""For the Uniform"" (Written by Peter Allan Fields Aired February 3, 1997).  Sisko is obsessed with bringing Eddington to justice, especially after pursuing him in the ""Defiant"" only to learn that Eddington had rigged a computer failure.  Now Sisko is not only angry, he has been humiliated, especially when he gets back to DS9 and learns Starfleet has assigned Captain Sanders of the ""Malinche"" to track down and capture Eddington.  However, when Eddington attacks Cardassian colonies in the demilitarized zone using a biogenic weapon, Sisko takes off in the ""Defiant,"" even though O'Brien has not had time to make all the necessary repairs.
My first problem with this episode is that Sisko goes off the deep end, repeatedly, in his obsessive efforts to get Eddington.  No wonder the traitor gets the best of him time and time again.  But not only is there the problem that his rage is making him ineffective, there is the fact that I just do not buy the hysterical anger from Sisko.  The cold anger he showed towards Captain Picard when they encountered each other, or that Sisko has shown to Gul Dukat and the rest of the Cardassians, is more in keeping with his established character.  Every time Sisko starts ranting I just do not bye it.  Second, I find it hard to believe that Sisko cannot appreciate Eddington's view of the situation.  Eddington believes in the Maquis cause; he did not betray Sisko and Starfleet for money or something equally heinous, but on principle.  Sisko can disagree with that principle, but he should at least be able to acknowledge it has some legitimacy (especially for someone who has flouted the Federation as often Sisko).
Finally, I have a big problem with what Sisko does to win the day.  Even if we limit ourselves to the evil things that have been done in the ""Star Trek"" universe, Eddington's actions do not come close to warranting the winning gambit that Sisko employs.  Nor do the stakes seem to justify this extreme solution either.  Consequently, ""For the Uniform"" ends up being a below average ""STDS9"" episode for me.  They should have been able to come up with better ways of working out this plotline.",1073088000,,2473,4.8132387706855795
7902897,4,B000003K91,"Synopsis:
Sisko encounters Michael Eddington, his former Starfleet Security Chief, who betrayed him and joined the Maquis.
Obsessed with capturing the traitor, Sisko pursues him in the U.S.S. Defiant. But when Sisko gives the order to fire, the U.S.S. Defiant experiences a massive computer failure, caused by Eddington. He leaves Sisko angry and humiliated, and facing a long trip home.
The U.S.S. Defiant is towed back to Deep Space Nine, and O'Brien begins the massive job of bringing the ship back on-line. Adding insult to injury, Sisko learns that Captain Sanders of the U.S.S. Malinche has been assigned to apprehend Eddington since Starfleet feels Sisko hasn't himself been able to do the job in the past eight months. But when he learns that Eddington attacked Cardassian colonies in the DMZ with a biogenic weapon, Sisko sees his chance. Despite the fact that the U.S.S. Defiant is not ready, he prepares to take his starship back into space.
The ship lurches out of the station and soon encounters Eddington again, who taunts Sisko. The captain realizes too late that he was baited to false coordinates. As the crew sets off to find Eddington's real location, a distress call is received from the U.S.S. Malinche, Maquis forces ambushed and disabled the starship.
Sisko determines Eddington's next planetary target, but is too late to stop him from releasing his biogenic weapon into the atmosphere. The U.S.S. Defiant chases after Eddington's fleeing raider, but he cripples a transport vessel evacuating Cardassian civilians, forcing Sisko to break off his pursuit and rescue the helpless Cardassians.
Stumped as to how to get Eddington, Sisko realizes that the renegade sees himself as a noble hero and Sisko as a villain. In order to stop Eddington, Sisko decides he must do something truly villainous. He prepares to poison the atmosphere of the Maquis colony in retaliation and reveals his sinister plan to all. Eddington is prepared to call his bluff. Amazingly, Sisko orders the deadly torpedoes launched, and the Maquis scramble to evacuate. Sisko says that he is prepared to eliminate every Maquis colony in the DMZ, and Eddington, realizing Sisko is serious, does the ""heroic"" gesture of offering himself in exchange. Eddington is captured, and Sisko's vendetta is finally over for good.",1058832000,,2309,5.16
7902898,5,B000003K91,"Although slightly dated nowadays, when this episode was new it was one of the best, and is definitely one of the best pre-war episodes.
It continues the story of Eddington, the unlikely traitor who was actually leader of the Maquis, and betrayed Sisko's trust. This left Sisko very angry, and this episode is devoted to just how far Sisko will go to capture Eddington.
It contains very little in the way of subplots, just a good, old fashioned space chase, and it's interesting to see how a Maquis ship manages to evade the Defiant, and goes to show just how cunning Eddington was.
However, this episode, by the same writer as 'In the Pale Moonlight', raised some interesting questions of principle. In order to catch Eddington, Sisko opens fire on Maquis civilians trying to inhabit a Cardassian planet. Although they are not harmed, he places them in danger in order to catch Eddington, is this really conduct becoming a Starfleet captain?
I doubt Starfleet Command would chastise Sisko for his actions, they were ultimately successful, but it stretched some principles a little bit too far for my liking.(The writer then breaks those principles in ""The Pale Moonlight"", season 6).
Overall though, a good story, excellent plot, and Sisko was particularly good, Eddington wasn't half bad either.",1003449600,5,1296,5.00462962962963
7902899,5,B000003K91,"This episode proves that Star Trek can be realistic.  The lengths to which Capt. Sisko will go to capture Eddington will really surprise most Star Trek fans.  This episode brings to mind all the ethical issues that are forgotten during times of war.
Another fascinating episode, by the same writer, is ""In the Pale Moonlight,"" by far my most favorite episode in the entire DS9 library.",998179200,,385,4.818181818181818
7902900,5,B000003K91,"Eddington betrayed Starfleet eight months ago by defecting to the Maquis  and becoming their new leader. Under his leadership the Maquis have begun  setting off deadly biological weapons tailor-made to kill Cardassian's,  something Sisko cannot allow to continue.
Sisko sees Eddington as a stain  on his record, the officer who managed to spy on Starfleet under Sisko's  command. He is desperate to capture him. But this desperation becomes his  own downfall as he goes to dangerous, even crazy, lengths to stop the man  who has brought out the worst in Caoptain Benjamin Sisko. A brilliant  episode in which Avery Brooks shines as Sisko!",966729600,2,638,5.12621359223301
7902901,4,B000003K91,A very good episode. We see how far Sisko will go to capture Edington. One of the best fifth season installments.,938908800,4,113,4.428571428571429
