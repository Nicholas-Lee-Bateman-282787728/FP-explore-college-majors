We've been taught to believe that the purest and best documentaries are those that take a definitive stand on an issue.  Such a one-sided approach is supposed to bespeak a righteous passion on the part of a filmmaker - as if dogmatism, in and of itself, were an indisputable virtue.  But what if the issue at hand is such a morally complex one that it simply doesn`t lend itself to the strident arguments and easy answers of a black-and-white diatribe?  Might it not, then, be best to drop the ""know-it-all"" posture of the partisan zealot and, instead, attempt to look at both sides of the issue from a position of objectivity and fairness?

That is the approach that filmmaker Tony Kaye has taken in ""Lake of Fire,"" a documentary on abortion that attempts to examine both sides of the issue in as unbiased and evenhanded a way as possible.  For once, the impassioned spokespersons in both the ""pro-life"" and ""pro-choice"" camps are free to have their say and to make their case, without commentary or condemnation from a judgmental third party.  In so doing, he has fashioned an unflinching and uncompromising look at one of the issues that most divides Americans today - and will surely do so for a very long time to come.

Watching ""Lake of Fire"" is a bit like being a ping pong ball in a high-stakes table tennis match.  Just as we find ourselves agreeing with a representative from one side of the equation, we are bandied back to the opposing side by what appear to be equally compelling arguments emanating from a spokesperson there.  And back and forth we go.  For while there are ""nutcases"" and ""screwballs"" on both sides of the divide (and they certainly get ample opportunity to voice their views here), many of the people who are interviewed offer sound, reasoned arguments for the positions they take.  At a lengthy two hours and thirty-two minutes, Kaye's film has plenty of time to take us into the emotionally-charged world of abortion politics, represented most vividly by the impassioned rallies and protest marches that all too often devolve into name-calling shouting matches that cloud the issue and further alienate those in the political center.  Moreover, in what is essentially a new American ""civil war,"" both sides come to the battlefield armed with gruesome images of those who have already perished in the conflict - the pro-lifers of dismembered fetuses, the pro-choicers of murdered doctors and victims of ""back alley"" abortions.

Kaye is to be particularly commended for not sanitizing or sugarcoating the actual abortion process, clearly assuming that we are grown up enough to face the truth without the need for coyness or comforting filters.  Intriguingly, Kaye has opted to film his movie in black-and-white rather than color, a very shrewd and wise decision, since the stark imagery serves to underline the seriousness and gravity of the issue.

If there's a weakness to the film it is that there may be a bit too much emphasis on the movers and shakers in each of the groups and not enough on the ordinary, average citizens whose lives have been directly affected or severely altered by abortion (or the lack thereof).  The movie does, however, end on such a note, taking us along with a young woman as she goes through the step-by-step process of an actual abortion.  It reminds us that, after all the speeches and marches, all the clinic protests and killing of doctors, the issue finally comes down to an individual woman and the agonizing decision that she alone must make.

With his film, Kaye clearly wants to make us think, but he doesn't tell us HOW to think - and that`s what separates his work from that of so many of his filmmaking contemporaries.  How people will react to this film is anyone`s guess.  All I know is that, no matter which side of the struggle you may come down on - or even if you have somehow managed to remain scrupulously neutral about it up to this point - ""Lake of Fire"" will indeed make you think long and hard about the issue.",1211846400,14,4009,4.747838616714698
3035946,5,B000YVBCT8,"In checking IMDB, I find this film received little coverage on the awards circuit, which is surprising. Perhaps because of the film's controversial subject, many festivals, theatre owners and critics deemed it wiser not to enter the fray - and frankly, shame on them for doing so. This was a risky project to take on, but that's what good documentaries are suppose to do, and this particular documentary succeeds beautifully, providing new insight on a subject, abortion, that's otherwise grown murky with knee-jerk belligerence and political sloganeering. Lake of Fire should have been applauded and deserves to be seen by the broader public. Instead, the industry turned its back on it out of cowardice.",1211760000,2,705,5.192982456140351
3035947,5,B000YVBCT8,"I can't add much to the great reviews already written here, other than to say I think this doc will leave the vast majority of people at least a little uncomfortable with their stance on the issue of abortion.  It probably won't change anyone's mind (I don't believe that's the film's intent) but it will shine some light on why people feel so strongly about the issue - on both sides.  And why there are no easy answers.",1209600000,6,421,4.384615384615385
3035948,5,B000YVBCT8,"""Lake of Fire"" is an in-depth look at the Abortion issue. No matter which side you happen to belong, Tony Kaye gives both sides equal time. There are interviews of people off the street, as well as comments from Writers, Attorneys, Doctors, and Patients on the subject. There is no narrative, and Tony Kaye was wise to let these people speak for themselves.

There were many issues raised within the subject of Abortion, on both sides, that make one go HMMMMMM. There IS graphic footage contained in this film, so wait until the kids have gone to bed, to pop this film in the DVD player.

The most surprising thing is that the woman who is at the heart of the landmark Roe V Wade decision, is now in total opposition to the Law she was instrumental in creating. The subject of Abortion clinic bombings and the assassinations of physicians who work in Abortion clinics is not only touched upon, but the blurring of the Law vs. Morality argument is a case in point of how divided we are, when the right to life issue is raised. We see in the film, tapes of the bombers/shooters making their case to the police while in custody. I may be a bit biased, but the Pro-Lifers looked a little crazy to me. It's hard to see someone's point of view when Religion makes it's way into a conversation about this subject.

Whether you are Pro-Life, or Pro-Choice, this film is an education in what defines us as human beings. Does life begin at birth, or the Zygote stage of developement? How do we resolve the issue? I don't believe it really can be. I believe in the right to choose, to have control over one's body, financial security and education. There are many women today, who would have been marginalized, and possibly welfare mothers, were it not for Roe V Wade.

Women, as well as Men, owe it to themselves to see this film. There is no better film out there, that is this comprehensive. You will be changed after seeing it.",1207094400,9,1920,4.477142857142857
3035949,5,B000YVBCT8,"Tony Kaye gives us a brave, challenging, intelligent documentary with ""Lake A Fire,"" a film that boldly explores the many depths of one of the most explosive issues in American history: Abortion rights. This is the definitive record on the subject, at least the best documentary ever assembled about a topic Americans have been grappling with for decades. Kaye's construction is brilliant, there is no narrator, no central plot, instead Kaye takes us on a 15-year journey told through the voices of both sides of the issue. We see Pro-Choice activists describing their conviction of a woman's right to choose in an unequal society, but we also see the explosive response by the radical right as they resort to intimidation, even terrorism to express their point. This is a film of ideas, literally because Kaye is not giving us one sole point of view or promoting any particular stance, he simply lays down both arguments. There are great insights from nurses, religious leaders and journalists while a more philosophical tone is provided by figures such as Alan Dershowitz and Noam Chomsky. The viewer will be challenged by logical discussions promoting freedom to choose but also by images of aborted fetuses, limbs and heads floating in aborted liquid. ""Lake Of Fire"" also transcends being a simple documentary about one issue, in this film we see the basic struggles of American society. Consider the very frightening sections which dig deep into the violent underbelly of radical Christian America, as religious fundementalists call for violence, assassinations and theocratic order, we realize terrorism is not exclusive to foreign countries, it can breed anywhere. Kaye, the director of the popular ""American History X,"" shoots his film with a haunting, beautiful black and white look which expands the film's epic scope and impact. He doesn't use fancy tricks, he let's us see faces making their case, demonstrations trying to get points across, the abortion procedure in it's entirety, to challenge the viewer into constructing an opinion or idea on his/her own. ""Lake Of Fire"" in a sense embodies American culture, our pitfalls and clashes. Noam Chomsky gives the most clear-headed opinion as he mentions both the preservation of life and the right to choose are valid arguments, but as a society we need to discuss these complex issues instead of resorting to ranting and dogma, this is what Kaye does as a filmmaker with ""Lake Of Fire."" A great American film.",1206576000,5,2471,5.103703703703704
3035950,5,B000YVBCT8,Mr. Byrd's review is right on the money.  An incredible achievement by Tony Kaye.,1205193600,2,81,4.785714285714286
3035951,5,B000YVBCT8,"I saw this film at a Toronto Int'l Film Festival industry screening and thought it was one of best documentaries I have EVER seen! I've read a couple of reviews that have called it the definitive film on the subject of abortion - I completely agree. I've never seen anything so complex, complete and emotionally wrenching as this epic work. It stayed with me long after the screening. In fact, it's been a couple of years since I've seen LAKE OF FIRE and it continues to haunt my thoughts. I weeped at the end. My only criticisms are it's length (far too long) and it's use of music, which often bordered on excessive and manipulative. But, those are relatively small concerns when weighed against the film's many positives.

I LOVE documentaries and have seen nearly every major work produced in the past 20 to 30 years (as well as not so major films). ""Lake of Fire"" may well be my favorite - I'm still deciding if any of the other films I've loved delivered the same unrelenting, yet profoundly emotional punch to the gut that this one did.  This is the best film no one has ever seen!  What a pity!!!!",1205020800,27,1105,4.487562189054726
3035962,5,B000YVBCT8,Intense just as I suspected. I love this but only buy it if you know what it is about and are interested in discovering both sides of this sensitive issue. Arrived promptly and in perfect condition.,1312934400,,198,4.527777777777778
3035963,3,B000YVBCT8,"This is a film that is hard to take your eyes away from, and then, in a few places, one that actually makes you to avert your eyes. Lake of Fire is beautifully, engagingly shot in a rich black and white, mainly covering the abortion issue in the 1990s. Its visual intensity, however, is some times just too palpable for its own good. What Kaye achieves is a studious provocativeness that outstrips his narrative, leaving us with an overlong film that begs a synthesis -- that is, what this signature struggle in the late 20th century America MEANS.

I found the ""you decide"" approach a cop-out, a shirking of responsibility of the film makers to make some sort of case. Kaye is mistaken about about the motif he uses in LOF that ""everyone is 'right' or 'wrong.'"" No, the right position is that, given the reality of American culture & society,  the abortion procedure must exist in the context that it is (1) available AND (2) safe, (3) legal and as (4) RARE as possible in its use, as it is in most other first world societies. It goes without saying that wider availability of sex education and pre-natal care are part of the equation.

The dangerous fanatics on the far end of the anti-abortion movement (they're back by the way: asassain Scott Roeder & his cadre of supporters in 2010) are NOT the equivalent of those of us that are pro-choice. The anti-abortion extremists will smear us as ""abortionists,"" as they do Atty General Eric Holder who upholds US law. Look, I have never met ANYONE who is pro-choice that ""encourages"" abortion as a norm in women's reproductive health. As for the case of the hapless, abused woman that closes LOF by getting an abortion (her 4th, Kaye takes us through it step by step), we need to have abortion available to such irresponsible people precisely because they are not coping with life, AND then find them safe places to get their lives together away from lowlife men. Or for my respectable middle-class friend in 1980 who carried a fetus to birth that lacked a brain, i.e. no head above the eyes, this ""male"" was not human, and expired shortly after it was born. No humane or reasonable person (except a zealot) would require that she carry such a pregnancy to term, and that is why the zealots are wrong and the pro-choicers right.

As for LOF, I found the commentary by Nat Henthoff, Alan Dershowitz and especially Noam Chomsky (a drone-meister, who repeatedly punctuates his remarks with ""everyone knows this"")  to be distracting. This trio of aging East Coast secular Jewish intellectuals doesn't work because the abortion controversy isn't a primary interest for any of them - they're known for other things. So why are they here? Perhaps because Dershowitz can't say no to a camera.

LOF is at best a finely styled, highly engaging film at first blush, but doesn't hold up under reflection. I imagine there are other films that do the job better. Over on the book side of things, I recommend ""Wrath of Angels,"" which covers the same period, and from a wider and deeper perspective, Cynthia Gorney's ""Articles of Faith: A Frontline History of the Abortion Wars."" Both are well-tempered works by excellent journalists. Catholics may be challenged by ""A Brief, Liberal Catholic Defense of Abortion,"" by Daniel Dombrowski and Robt Deltete.",1299715200,4,3286,4.766256590509666

3035966,5,B000YVBCT8,"Whatever your opinion on the topic of abortion, this film is worth watching. It focuses more on the subject of the controversey between Pro-Life and Pro-Choice more than on the procedures themselves. The film is a documentary shot in black & white (nice use of metaphor there), and I can say that it is one of the most touching films I have ever seen. Though several intellectuals are interviewed for the film, it presses no concrete opinion and instead invites the viewer to make their own decision on how they stand admist years of controversy.",1262995200,,546,4.757894736842105
3035967,1,B000YVBCT8,"Ok, I admit I'm biased. I watched the first 5 minutes and that's all I could take. Each side demonizing the other. Neither looking for common ground. This is what's been going on for the last 35 years for no good reason. Nobody is really working on reducing the number of unplanned pregnancies and abortions in this country. The pro life folks focus only on making it illegal, without recognizing that making something illegal doesn't make it go away. The pro choice folks focus on the 'choice' part but really only pay lip service to birth control and still tend to think abstinence until marriage is just an impossibly abstract ideal.

Maybe I'm wrong because I only watched the first 5 minutes.....but it didn't seem like there was anything new here. It's the same old drama and self righteousness on both sides. I've been watching this drama my whole d*mn life and I'm sick of it. Time to take some constructive action to prevent unplanned pregnancies and find ways to lessen the economic burden of raising children so that people aren't put in such a difficult situation in the first place. And even though we must recognize a lot of people aren't going to wait until marriage to have sex, the pro-life folks are also somewhat correct that we do need to see more restraint and self control when it comes to sexual activity.",1257897600,,1328,4.6752136752136755
3035968,5,B000YVBCT8,"To my mind this Documentary is on par with GREY GARDENS and HARLAN COUNTY, USA in that it shows the rest of us how it's done. You film everything you can. You film it well. You extract yourself from the product to the best of your ability. And you cut it together without comment or motive but with artful, narrative grace, again, to the best of your ability. Kaye achieves all of that here.

Beyond that, this is a work of staggering humanity. The director cares about people, all people, and is fascinated by the way we address the most complex questions. If you're a doc fan, or simply interested in this issue... this is the real thing.",1243468800,5,640,4.423728813559322
3035969,4,B000YVBCT8,"I watched the film a little while ago, and it's an important and well-made film, often portraying with force the emotional intensity of the issue.

However, I can't recommend it for everyone, but really only for the discerning viewer. This not because I'm prudish or anything, but I can see where this film may have the opposite effect of understanding the other. I could see where people of one side will walk away from this film thinking even more ill of the other side; pro-lifers will think ""abortionists"" are even sicker and more sinful than they imagined, and the pro-choice crowd will grow in their affirmation that they are only up against fanatics no different than Al-Qaeda. I think this is an unfortunate drawback of the film. But the discerning viewer I think can gain a greater understanding from watching this film of the emotion, and the complex disconnected reasoning that drives the different parties in this issue to such extremes.",1230681600,2,949,4.894409937888199
3035970,5,B000YVBCT8,"This is easily one of the most difficult films I've ever watched. It is a documentary about the abortion issue. It is told as objectively as humanly possible. Whatever your position, you will be angry with the story. It takes you into the operating room and you watch two abortion procedures as they happen. It shows the baby being suctioned out and the doctor emptying the bag into a dish to count all the body parts to make sure nothing has been left. Kaye takes you into the middle of the picket lines where both sides are shouting and cursing one another. You are there with a young woman when her boyfriend picks her up to take her to the clinic for the abortion and you sit in on her pre-op interview, view the abortion and hear the emotions she is experiencing after the procedure. You go into the homes and offices of those active in both the pro-life and pro-choice sides and hear their stories. You will hear one of the guests speculate why neither political party seems to want the issue to go away as it is an issue that activates the parties' bases like almost no other and it is always a winner in raising money. You will hear from pro-life activists that believe murdering doctors who perform abortions is morally necessary and justified. You will hear the remarkable conversion of Norma McCorvey, the anonymous Jane Doe in Roe vs Wade, from abortion advocate to pro-life Christian. You will hear some honest discussion about why abortion is such an emotional and divisive issue and how we must raise the level of discussion to more than the rhetoric that is typical currently from both sides. Is there room for compromise or is this an issue that will forever divide our country? I do not know anyone who is neutral on this subject. This film will only help to raise the understanding on both sides of this very, very divisive and emotional subject and hopefully lead to meaningful and serious discussion between the viewpoints.

It reminds us that, after all the speeches and marches, all the clinic protests and killing of doctors, the issue finally comes down to an individual woman and the agonizing decision that she alone must make.

With his film, Kaye clearly wants to make us think, but he doesn't tell us HOW to think - and that`s what separates his work from that of so many of his filmmaking contemporaries.  How people will react to this film is anyone`s guess.  All I know is that, no matter which side of the struggle you may come down on - or even if you have somehow managed to remain scrupulously neutral about it up to this point - ""Lake of Fire"" will indeed make you think long and hard about the issue.",1211846400,14,4009,4.747838616714698
3270443,5,B000YVBCT8,"In checking IMDB, I find this film received little coverage on the awards circuit, which is surprising. Perhaps because of the film's controversial subject, many festivals, theatre owners and critics deemed it wiser not to enter the fray - and frankly, shame on them for doing so. This was a risky project to take on, but that's what good documentaries are suppose to do, and this particular documentary succeeds beautifully, providing new insight on a subject, abortion, that's otherwise grown murky with knee-jerk belligerence and political sloganeering. Lake of Fire should have been applauded and deserves to be seen by the broader public. Instead, the industry turned its back on it out of cowardice.",1211760000,2,705,5.192982456140351

It probably won't change anyone's mind (I don't believe that's the film's intent) but it will shine some light on why people feel so strongly about the issue - on both sides.

3270445,5,B000YVBCT8,"""Lake of Fire"" is an in-depth look at the Abortion issue. No matter which side you happen to belong, Tony Kaye gives both sides equal time. There are interviews of people off the street, as well as comments from Writers, Attorneys, Doctors, and Patients on the subject. There is no narrative, and Tony Kaye was wise to let these people speak for themselves.

There were many issues raised within the subject of Abortion, on both sides, that make one go HMMMMMM. There IS graphic footage contained in this film, so wait until the kids have gone to bed, to pop this film in the DVD player.

The most surprising thing is that the woman who is at the heart of the landmark Roe V Wade decision, is now in total opposition to the Law she was instrumental in creating. The subject of Abortion clinic bombings and the assassinations of physicians who work in Abortion clinics is not only touched upon, but the blurring of the Law vs. Morality argument is a case in point of how divided we are, when the right to life issue is raised. We see in the film, tapes of the bombers/shooters making their case to the police while in custody. I may be a bit biased, but the Pro-Lifers looked a little crazy to me. It's hard to see someone's point of view when Religion makes it's way into a conversation about this subject.

Whether you are Pro-Life, or Pro-Choice, this film is an education in what defines us as human beings. Does life begin at birth, or the Zygote stage of developement? How do we resolve the issue? I don't believe it really can be. I believe in the right to choose, to have control over one's body, financial security and education. There are many women today, who would have been marginalized, and possibly welfare mothers, were it not for Roe V Wade.

Women, as well as Men, owe it to themselves to see this film. There is no better film out there, that is this comprehensive. You will be changed after seeing it.",1207094400,9,1920,4.477142857142857
3270446,5,B000YVBCT8,"Tony Kaye gives us a brave, challenging, intelligent documentary with ""Lake A Fire,"" a film that boldly explores the many depths of one of the most explosive issues in American history: Abortion rights. This is the definitive record on the subject, at least the best documentary ever assembled about a topic Americans have been grappling with for decades. Kaye's construction is brilliant, there is no narrator, no central plot, instead Kaye takes us on a 15-year journey told through the voices of both sides of the issue. We see Pro-Choice activists describing their conviction of a woman's right to choose in an unequal society, but we also see the explosive response by the radical right as they resort to intimidation, even terrorism to express their point. This is a film of ideas, literally because Kaye is not giving us one sole point of view or promoting any particular stance, he simply lays down both arguments. There are great insights from nurses, religious leaders and journalists while a more philosophical tone is provided by figures such as Alan Dershowitz and Noam Chomsky. The viewer will be challenged by logical discussions promoting freedom to choose but also by images of aborted fetuses, limbs and heads floating in aborted liquid. ""Lake Of Fire"" also transcends being a simple documentary about one issue, in this film we see the basic struggles of American society. Consider the very frightening sections which dig deep into the violent underbelly of radical Christian America, as religious fundementalists call for violence, assassinations and theocratic order, we realize terrorism is not exclusive to foreign countries, it can breed anywhere. Kaye, the director of the popular ""American History X,"" shoots his film with a haunting, beautiful black and white look which expands the film's epic scope and impact. He doesn't use fancy tricks, he let's us see faces making their case, demonstrations trying to get points across, the abortion procedure in it's entirety, to challenge the viewer into constructing an opinion or idea on his/her own. ""Lake Of Fire"" in a sense embodies American culture, our pitfalls and clashes. Noam Chomsky gives the most clear-headed opinion as he mentions both the preservation of life and the right to choose are valid arguments, but as a society we need to discuss these complex issues instead of resorting to ranting and dogma, this is what Kaye does as a filmmaker with ""Lake Of Fire."" A great American film.",1206576000,5,2471,5.103703703703704
3270447,5,B000YVBCT8,Mr. Byrd's review is right on the money.  An incredible achievement by Tony Kaye.,1205193600,2,81,4.785714285714286
3270448,5,B000YVBCT8,"I saw this film at a Toronto Int'l Film Festival industry screening and thought it was one of best documentaries I have EVER seen! I've read a couple of reviews that have called it the definitive film on the subject of abortion - I completely agree. I've never seen anything so complex, complete and emotionally wrenching as this epic work. It stayed with me long after the screening. In fact, it's been a couple of years since I've seen LAKE OF FIRE and it continues to haunt my thoughts. I weeped at the end. My only criticisms are it's length (far too long) and it's use of music, which often bordered on excessive and manipulative. But, those are relatively small concerns when weighed against the film's many positives.

I LOVE documentaries and have seen nearly every major work produced in the past 20 to 30 years (as well as not so major films). ""Lake of Fire"" may well be my favorite - I'm still deciding if any of the other films I've loved delivered the same unrelenting, yet profoundly emotional punch to the gut that this one did.  This is the best film no one has ever seen!  What a pity!!!!",1205020800,27,1105,4.487562189054726

3270460,3,B000YVBCT8,"This is a film that is hard to take your eyes away from, and then, in a few places, one that actually makes you to avert your eyes. Lake of Fire is beautifully, engagingly shot in a rich black and white, mainly covering the abortion issue in the 1990s. Its visual intensity, however, is some times just too palpable for its own good. What Kaye achieves is a studious provocativeness that outstrips his narrative, leaving us with an overlong film that begs a synthesis -- that is, what this signature struggle in the late 20th century America MEANS.

I found the ""you decide"" approach a cop-out, a shirking of responsibility of the film makers to make some sort of case. Kaye is mistaken about about the motif he uses in LOF that ""everyone is 'right' or 'wrong.'"" No, the right position is that, given the reality of American culture & society,  the abortion procedure must exist in the context that it is (1) available AND (2) safe, (3) legal and as (4) RARE as possible in its use, as it is in most other first world societies. It goes without saying that wider availability of sex education and pre-natal care are part of the equation.

The dangerous fanatics on the far end of the anti-abortion movement (they're back by the way: asassain Scott Roeder & his cadre of supporters in 2010) are NOT the equivalent of those of us that are pro-choice. The anti-abortion extremists will smear us as ""abortionists,"" as they do Atty General Eric Holder who upholds US law. Look, I have never met ANYONE who is pro-choice that ""encourages"" abortion as a norm in women's reproductive health. As for the case of the hapless, abused woman that closes LOF by getting an abortion (her 4th, Kaye takes us through it step by step), we need to have abortion available to such irresponsible people precisely because they are not coping with life, AND then find them safe places to get their lives together away from lowlife men. Or for my respectable middle-class friend in 1980 who carried a fetus to birth that lacked a brain, i.e. no head above the eyes, this ""male"" was not human, and expired shortly after it was born. No humane or reasonable person (except a zealot) would require that she carry such a pregnancy to term, and that is why the zealots are wrong and the pro-choicers right.

As for LOF, I found the commentary by Nat Henthoff, Alan Dershowitz and especially Noam Chomsky (a drone-meister, who repeatedly punctuates his remarks with ""everyone knows this"")  to be distracting. This trio of aging East Coast secular Jewish intellectuals doesn't work because the abortion controversy isn't a primary interest for any of them - they're known for other things. So why are they here? Perhaps because Dershowitz can't say no to a camera.

LOF is at best a finely styled, highly engaging film at first blush, but doesn't hold up under reflection. I imagine there are other films that do the job better. Over on the book side of things, I recommend ""Wrath of Angels,"" which covers the same period, and from a wider and deeper perspective, Cynthia Gorney's ""Articles of Faith: A Frontline History of the Abortion Wars."" Both are well-tempered works by excellent journalists. Catholics may be challenged by ""A Brief, Liberal Catholic Defense of Abortion,"" by Daniel Dombrowski and Robt Deltete.",1299715200,4,3286,4.766256590509666

3270464,1,B000YVBCT8,"Ok, I admit I'm biased. I watched the first 5 minutes and that's all I could take. Each side demonizing the other. Neither looking for common ground. This is what's been going on for the last 35 years for no good reason. Nobody is really working on reducing the number of unplanned pregnancies and abortions in this country. The pro life folks focus only on making it illegal, without recognizing that making something illegal doesn't make it go away. The pro choice folks focus on the 'choice' part but really only pay lip service to birth control and still tend to think abstinence until marriage is just an impossibly abstract ideal.

Maybe I'm wrong because I only watched the first 5 minutes.....but it didn't seem like there was anything new here. It's the same old drama and self righteousness on both sides. I've been watching this drama my whole d*mn life and I'm sick of it. Time to take some constructive action to prevent unplanned pregnancies and find ways to lessen the economic burden of raising children so that people aren't put in such a difficult situation in the first place. And even though we must recognize a lot of people aren't going to wait until marriage to have sex, the pro-life folks are also somewhat correct that we do need to see more restraint and self control when it comes to sexual activity.",1257897600,,1328,4.6752136752136755

You extract yourself from the product to the best of your ability. And you cut it together without comment or motive but with artful, narrative grace, again, to the best of your ability.

However, I can't recommend it for everyone, but really only for the discerning viewer. This not because I'm prudish or anything, but I can see where this film may have the opposite effect of understanding the other. I could see where people of one side will walk away from this film thinking even more ill of the other side; pro-lifers will think ""abortionists"" are even sicker and more sinful than they imagined, and the pro-choice crowd will grow in their affirmation that they are only up against fanatics no different than Al-Qaeda. I think this is an unfortunate drawback of the film. But the discerning viewer I think can gain a greater understanding from watching this film of the emotion, and the complex disconnected reasoning that drives the different parties in this issue to such extremes.",1230681600,2,949,4.894409937888199

It shows the baby being suctioned out and the doctor emptying the bag into a dish to count all the body parts to make sure nothing has been left. Kaye takes you into the middle of the picket lines where both sides are shouting and cursing one another. You are there with a young woman when her boyfriend picks her up to take her to the clinic for the abortion and you sit in on her pre-op interview, view the abortion and hear the emotions she is experiencing after the procedure. You go into the homes and offices of those active in both the pro-life and pro-choice sides and hear their stories. You will hear one of the guests speculate why neither political party seems to want the issue to go away as it is an issue that activates the parties' bases like almost no other and it is always a winner in raising money. You will hear from pro-life activists that believe murdering doctors who perform abortions is morally necessary and justified. You will hear the remarkable conversion of Norma McCorvey, the anonymous Jane Doe in Roe vs Wade, from abortion advocate to pro-life Christian. You will hear some honest discussion about why abortion is such an emotional and divisive issue and how we must raise the level of discussion to more than the rhetoric that is typical currently from both sides. Is there room for compromise or is this an issue that will forever divide our country? I do not know anyone who is neutral on this subject. This film will only help to raise the understanding on both sides of this very, very divisive and emotional subject and hopefully lead to meaningful and serious discussion between the viewpoints.

8234213,3,B000YVBCT8,"I just finished watching ""Lake of Fire"" and I must say that it portrays Pro-Life people (especially Christian proponents) as radical in the worst sense of that term. If a person is pro-life that does not mean that they condone murders or assasinations. The grizzliness of the procedure is hard to watch as well as the emotional turmoil of the 28 year old near the close of the video. We live in a world (Christians too!) that fail in many ways, but personal responsiblity needs to be taken for all our actions and attitudes. Hatred of persons is never appropriate. Sadness is appropriate. For me, abortion is wrong but also sad. If we live our lives without regard to consequences, then why are we surprised that abortion is used as retro-active birth control? Momma always said that ""Two wrongs don't make a right."" Abortion may ""solve"" the problem but there is a much deeper problem that lies behind it and that is the narcissism of our day. We are slaves to our selves...our wants, our goals, our passions.

Christians should adopt more and empty the orphanages and bind up the wounds of hurting people. The video portrays Christians as uncaring, harsh and dangerous people. The fringe does not define the Bible loving believer. Healing is the message we bring, not ""quick fixes"" like abortion that only make the situation worse.",1375228800,,1332,4.791304347826087
8234214,4,B000YVBCT8,"I would have given this 5 stars except that it was overly long and some of the music scenes seemed unnecessary. I have had friends and relatives who for various reasons chose the abortion route and I understand their reasons. One chose financial ruin in order to pull the funds together many years ago to go to New York where abortions were legal. I have not had an abortion, but I can empathize with those who have had to make that difficult decision. My major take away from the film was that the religious pro-life people need to reconsider what it means to be ""pro-life"". Not only is killing doctors and nurses wrong, just stating that everyone who does not believe as they do will burn forever in a lake of fire is absurd! Should that not include being against all war? What about providing housing, food and health care for all American children? To make a positive difference why not band together to adopt the unwanted children in orphanages or in foster homes? Work to better the world instead of being so judgmental?  And primarily, how can we prevent women having to make this difficult decision in the first place?  Birth control and education are the answers to reduce the need for abortions.  One person in the film said that if abortions are banned, poor women will be forced to back alley abortions while women of means will be able to travel to obtain one. As another reviewer stated, I felt like a ping pong ball while watching the movie when intelligent, educated people discussed the issues.  The ranting of the religious Bible thumpers and cult leaders reminded me of the Christian Crusades and witch hunts that killed thousands who did not go along with the world being round, revolving around the sun, genocide of entire cities, stoning women, men (because they have a penis) as the head of women, etc. I truly hope that providing sex education and birth control will continue to help to reduce the number of abortions. It is a horrific decision to have to make, but as the nurse at the end of the film stated, the women making the decision did not do so lightly. I loved what one nurse said at the end:  Miscarriages happen when the body is not ready to carry a child, abortions happen when the woman is not ready.""",1340928000,,2239,4.5735660847880295
8234215,5,B000YVBCT8,"Our evolution makes us want to reproduce. In fact, to twist an old saying, many of us consider sex the most fun we can have with out clothes off. Not only do we have a strong urge to fornicate most of us have a strong urge to protect and care for children. Full disclosure: - I am  a very hard core atheist. However, many people people - including many religious believers who are close friends of mine - are trying to find common ground on abortion. A way I frame the question is that to say that to say that birth control pills are a kind of ""abortion,"" is quite nutty, as is saying that ""day after"" pills are abortion.

On the other hand, to abort a child one day before it is due to be born, strikes me as clearly murder. I watched the movie with about half a dozen secular people. There was no consensus. Two of he audience were were women (one from Indonesia). When the film showed abortions taking place, the women covered their eyes and ears. Although the movie is long (we stopped watching about half an hour before the movie was done), I think the movie treated the issue with serious respect.

There are at least two big issues involving abortion: people having sex without creating unwanted children. and population control. As people are not going to stop having sex, we probably need a ""Manhattan project"" effort to make safe and reliable. China is the most populated country in the world, so it is understandable (but not in my opinion) desirable that it uses forced abortion as a method of birth control. My biggest disagreement with religious believers is their objection to reasonable methods of birth control, and their obsession with having as many children as they can,",1336003200,,1690,4.552631578947368
8234216,2,B000YVBCT8,"This film has a very particular focus on the abortion issue that eschews almost any contemporary opinions or documentation from any women or couples who are actually dealing with having or not having the controversial procedure performed. The first hour (it runs two and a half hours) is overwhelmingly concentrated on the extreme right wing element and the murdering of abortion doctors. There is about 30 seconds mixed in of testimony from actual women who had abortions and why they did it.

The director seems to have taken a definitive stance to show as many crazy Christians as he possibly could find and it grows repetitive. Truly the most powerful images in the film are the same controversial shots that the anti-abortionists use to scare women from having abortions. No matter what your stance is, shots of dead fetuses and pieces of dead fetuses are deeply disturbing.

Apart from the bombardment of the viewer with nutty, shouting, singing religious extremists, the film falls into an intellectual duel of talking heads from both the academic left and the religious right. About two-thirds into the film, I realized that there simply was not going to be any interviews of any women or couples who were dealing with the consideration of having an abortion, had had an abortion and were for it, had had an abortion and were against it, women who didn't have an abortion and gave up their babies for adoption, women who had an abortion and were fine with it or any human being dealing with the reality of it at all.

The real highlights of the film are Alan Dershowitz and Noam Chomsky's deeply thoughtful opinions on the matter, but that should tell you how much the talking heads of men dominate this documentary.

At the two hour and ten minute mark, there is finally one interview of a woman who is considering an abortion but it seems to focus entirely on her history of domestic violence.(??)

If you are looking for a definitive film on the contemporary history of right wing Christian fundamentalism as it relates to being anti-abortionist, and the academic left's stance against it, this is it. If you are looking for a film about the real human issues and spiritual complexities of the abortion debate and getting an abortion, this is far from it.",1330128000,4,2266,4.814910025706941
