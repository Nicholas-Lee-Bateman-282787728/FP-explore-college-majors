420781,5,6302035279,"I love this movie.  I saw it first back in 1985 when it first played in the art house theaters in the USA and have seen it a few times since.  I believe it was the first time I'd ever seen Richardson or Everett in anything and they both completely knocked me out.  When I saw Everett in ""Ideal Husband"" last year, I didn't even realize it was the same actor at first.  He's that good.  When you immediately recongize actors doing the same role, year after year, it is a bad sign. This is a notorious British murder case that ended in Ruth Ellis's (Richardson's) execution in Britian for murdering her lover. The thing that always stands out to me in this movie is how obsessed these two become with their sick relationship with one another.  This is something everyone can relate to because everyone knows someone in a sick relationship.  Many people have even been in sick relationships themselves.

Because neither character can break the strangulating force of their combined obsession, the obsession snares and turns on both of them.  I also thought that it was pretty effectively conveyed throughout that she just wasn't good enough for him and didn't meet any minimal standards of British respectability. By any objective standard, however, he was not a laudatory individual either and would be easy to classify as big trouble to know or get involved with personally. Yet the country had more sympathy for him.  I think Ellis's being considered rather trashy was also why it was so easy to execute her in Britain.  Had she been a member of the aristocracy and/or upper class, a different movie would have had to be written.  He probably would have been falling all over himself trying to marry her then even if she otherwise remained exactly the same and with the same physical appearance.  Then she would have been merely a British eccentric.

420782,4,6302035279,"This was the film that brought Miranda Richardson to fame, before her ill-advised turns on Black Adder on TV. I've always thought of Richardson to be like a British version of Meryl Streep. Both actresses use meticulous technique to convey character though I find Richardson the more interesting performer. Consider what neurosis she would have brought to Streep's Susan Traherne in Plenty. Here Richardson plays Ruth Ellis, involved in a tormented relationship with Rupert Everett's David Blakely, who became the last woman to be hanged for murder in England in 1955. You know things aren't good when their banter is full of taunts. Wisely director Mike Newell controls Everetts' narcissistic petulance so that we read him from her reactions. One scene when his back is to the camera as he descends upon her and her slapping turns to an embrace is as good a definition of their dynamic as any. Newell scores points off Ruth by making David's friends show disdain to her, though this disdain is too heavyhanded in some talking to the camera warnings, and in a scene where she confronts him for avoiding her. This scene is played as if Ruth is meant to be a coarse scrubber but Richardson makes us feel Ruth's humiliation, and our empathy is thereby shifted away from the ""toffs"". The only thing that David's friends could object to about Ruth is the fact that she peroxides her hair to resemble Marilyn Monroe (""Just look at her"" one says). but considering how ordinary the friends are, this seems hardly a crime. Ruth is styled impeccably, even if Kael thinks her makeup looks ""etched on"", and I love the touch of giving her spectacles. Early on, someone describes how the wealthy ""like a bit of spit and sawdust"" I suppose to indicate the seamy aspect of both Ruth's working as a ""hostess"" and Ruth herself, but the British are never quite convincing when they try for grubbiness. As a third party, a man who wants to rescue Ruth from David, Ian Holm plays his usual ineffectualness, yet Newell having him attack Ruth in frustration gets an easy laugh. Newell allows the screenplay to go on too long, repeating things we have already seen, and giving us Ruth standing all day and night watching David, before the murder. However there are two great images in a fog - a flaming torch, and Ruth wearing a white head shawl. note is made of the moody and little-used score by Richard Hartley.",973641600,8,2390,4.747596153846154

420849,5,6302035279,"""Dance with a Stranger"" features a great performance by Miranda Richarson.  I've seen MR in countless other movies in the last 20 years, but this is her best performance (it's also one of her few leads, as she usually appears in supporting roles.)  I was surprised when I looked it up and saw that she wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award in 1985, the year that this movie came out.  Probably because she never asks the viewer to like her or feel sorry for her.  Ian Holm was wonderful, as usual.  Rupert Everett was okay -- definitely not in the same league as his brilliant co-stars.  Great direction by Mike Newell.  I found this movie to be both heartbreaking and unsentimental at the same time.",1375660800,,705,4.5476190476190474

420852,5,6302035279,"I like it the film as much now as when it first came out. A really beautifully directed and nuanced piece that deals with the true story of the last British woman to be executed, with Miranda Richardson in a stunning performance as a lower-class girl on the make and Rupert Everett being totally convincing as an upper-class cad she falls for. For the evocation alone of grimy, washed-out 50s Britain it's excellent, but there's a true story of human passion and hopelessness here as well.",1261872000,2,489,4.6976744186046515
420853,2,6302035279,"I have to say, I may be completely biased in writing this review, as I went into the film with a certain expectation, which never seemed to be fulfilled. This movie is in the Avant-Garde Cinema category of MGM DVD releases. Never having heard of it, I decided to rent it due to this tag, complemented by the cast, whom are capable of giving good performances.
  I really cannot see how this movie fits even lightly into the avant-garde category. Perhaps the first two minutes of the film, which could have led the proceedings into more creative realms. That being said, I am probably unfair in my rating, since it is more about the product itself (in a certain sense). I really cannot say at the moment what rating I would give it if I had accidentally come across it on TV with no references whatsoever. The main point for me was that I went into it expecting some kind of experimenting with narrative, but for me there was no such thing. Perhaps the people at MGM believe that it was a conscious attempt of the filmmakers at making a film as plain as possible, hence making it avant-garde in its mimicry. Yeah right. Then again, I do not know what exactly their criteria is for putting a film into said category, so proper justification may exist, but it definitely was not one that fit my ideas of avant-garde at the time of watching. Some of the fims that MGM has in its Avant-Garde collection (even though some of these are not directly labeled as such (I checked there website)) that I have watched and do consider in avant-garde are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marat-Sade/dp/0871295075/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marat/Sade</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Belly-of-an-Architect/dp/B0001V6ZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Belly of an Architect</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suture/dp/B000053VAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suture</a>, and a few others, most of them excellent films.

  About the movie itself, the performances are good in a classical sense, displaying truly pathetic characters. But somehow, it was just that, they were all pathetic in a way that was not all that compelling to see, unless, you were in the right mood. For me, this is not a movie that will stand out, alongside other great movies. If not for the act of writing this review, I might even have forgotten about it in due time.
  I am sorry for bringing the overall rating down, but this is also a review of the product itself, and it is has been misleadingly packaged. So for those of you interested in more unconventional cinema, this is not unconventional, at least in a way that could be called avant-garde (unless the person in question is accustomed to average Hollywood blockbusters, then this might be an exercise in the unbearably ""experimental"").",1251849600,2,2880,5.37250554323725
420854,4,6302035279,"Dance with a Stranger is the story of Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be executed in England.  Her crime was one of passion, but also madness, which the film lays out for our eyes with exquisite detail.  A former ""tart,"" and now hostess of a nightclub, Ruth is an independent woman of means and beauty.  With her many admirers, it is a wonder she ever fell for David Blakeley, upper-class ne'er do well with a lot of time, a drinking problem, and a bad temper.

These two are not star crossed lovers bound to obstacles because of 1950s English society, in truth they are a lustful pair brought together because of desire.  David treats her poorly, and Ruth seems helpless in love's grip.  The film crawls through their many encounters to reveal to the audience the agonizing relationship both endured.  It obviously does not end well, but if you read any description for the product, you already know that instantly.

This film is full of remarkable acting.  Miranda Richardson is one of my favorites.  Not only does she delight with her talent, but she is breathtaking as well.  I would dub her the British Marilyn Monroe.  A wonderful true crime film that exposes human weakness and vice, so you believe it had to end the way it did, which is truly remarkable.  Recommended.",1251417600,2,1274,4.633928571428571
420884,5,6302035279,"I  became interested in the history of capital punishment in Great Britain during 2007.  In looking up this subject on the internet I discovered the case of Ruth Ellis, whose murder case, conviction, and execution remains controversial to this day.  Miranda Richardson became a ""star"" from starring in Dance With A Stranger playing Ruth Ellis.  I bought the film and have seen it several times and have become a Miranda Richardson fan. I am a citizen of ""Mirandatia"" as her fans are called on the net.
Our sympathies are with Ruth Ellis from her first meeting with David Blakely in 1954-55. He seduces her, makes love to her, and then abuses and ignores her. Ruth Ellis fatally shoots Blakely in April of 1955 and is tried, convicted and hanged for her crime.
I wish this film had included her trial and the last days of her life as
Ruth Ellis awaited her execution. Much of the British public protested
her hanging, and that protest aided in eventually abolishing  capital punishment in Britain ten years later.
In a sense, Ruth Ellis ""lives"" due to the notoriety of her case.  I feel
that Miranda Richardson brings her to life in Dance With A Stranger and
this makes the film worth seeing and Miranda Richardson's career worth
following.",1205193600,3,1239,4.73953488372093
420885,5,6302035279,"Beautifully rendered, superbly acted film recreates events leading up to one of England's most famous crimes of passion. Newell painstakingly revives the look and feel of 1950's London, using this sordid affair to examine the ingrained class differences that doomed the couple from the start. Richardson, Everett, and Holm are marvels to watch, and the film's shattering climax is worth waiting for. Catch this chilling romantic thriller.",1183680000,4,438,5.552238805970149
420886,5,6302035279,"this film has stayed with me because of miranda richardson's showy performance as ruth ellis.  she is a woman that is barely in control of her life, then relationships with the wrong men at the same time destroys her.  the script by shelagh delaney works the facts into a tight dramatic collection of scenes and moments peppered through with taut dialogue.  the stylings and visuals evoke an inky, foggy london that was still struggling to get back on its feet after world war ii.  and richardson is supported ably by pretty boy rupert everett as david blakely and ian holm as desmond cussen, the two men in ellis' short and trauma-filled life.  perhaps, the most tragic element of the story though, is not ellis' destruction of herself but her unknowing destruction of her son.",1178755200,5,778,4.776119402985074
420887,5,6302035279,"This film was Richardson's first outing as a movie actress and she is outstanding, Everett is also good as the callous playboy, though he has never quite managed to build on his first performance in the way Richardson did. Holme is aslo excellent as the doting ""Father"" figure.

 This is the sad telling of the true story of Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be hanged in England, in the mid 1950's.

 Ellis was essentially a loving and caring woman with a chequered past and little options for making a living, a woman who would have been highly frowned upon in such conservative times. She met and fell in love with, a rich boy rogue, David Blakely and the film chronicles their destructive and doomed relationship. Not an easy story, Richardson is amazing as the increasingly unhinged Ruth and Everett is the perfect ""Bastard"".

 A worthy watch and an excellent introduction to the talents of Richardson (in my opinoin, she is one of the finest contemparary actresses and could only be rivalled by the likes of Meryl Streep and Susan Sarandon).

 This film is a very sad tale and to this day the British Judicial system debates whether or not Ellis should have been executed, the majority thinking amongst the British public both then and now is that it was a gross miscarraige of justice.

 I have to also say that I cannot understand negative reviews of this film, I can only conclude that such people find the content hard to tolerate which is vaguely understandable, or they just don't have the intellilect to work through the story.",1111536000,8,1536,4.697761194029851
420888,5,6302035279,"Ruth Ellis was put to death because she was a resentful woman with a gun. She was a girl that had a baby by an American soldier who she claimed was killed the same year her son was born in 1944. In 1950, she married a dentist and had a girl, but that marriage was dissolved in 1953. During that time, she meets gorgeous David Blakey, a racing motorist, and a son of a doctor aged 29.
Ruth being from rocky background begins an ardent love affair with the David who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Love and hate became the core of their relationship, and their affair gave birth to nothing but jealousy. She began dating him while she was still married to the dentist, and David was engaged to another girl. Ruth at first refused to take the affair seriously since he had another woman.
When David suspects or finds out that she sleeps with other men, he becomes outraged and begs her to marry him. She becomes more affectionate, but does not trust him and accuses him of cheating. They have dramatic scenarios such as her throwing him out of her flat in anger and him coming back begging on his knees to marry her. She spies on him while he is with other women, and he brings her flowers at the hospital after he beats her.  Eventually the relationship worsens and escalates, and Ruth ends-up supporting much of her rich boyfriend's habits.
Well this goes on with the dark and lustful tension that keeps building up throughout the whole film. Miranda Richardson's performance is just excellent, and it is based on the true story of the last woman to be put to death in England 1954.
It is a very interesting British film noir, so I will not give the whole story away.",1107734400,5,1678,4.395498392282958
420889,5,6302035279,"Ruth Ellis is a gentle waiter . She has a son and lives for him and his welfare . But soon she will meet David; a man who will become her only subject of desire and illusion .

And David is just a gigolo without any future . He lives as many people does ; just waiting for the fridayness and have a great fun .

But this encounter with Ruth will arise a opposite passion totally unknown . He will be to her the object of desire but besides of pain and sorrow ; he punishes her and this behavior gradually will carry to the expected ending : this murder became the last execution in the England fifties.

Miranda Richardson has been a very beautiful woman and also a very gifted actress , she has expressive force and presence on the screen. Ruppert Everett plays David in a very credible role .

This film may be well be considered the best british film noir of the eighties .

420890,1,6302035279,"I have seen some bad films in my lifetime, but this film literally takes the cake.  Right after watching this film I went over to my wife and asked her if she knew what the film I just watched was all about.  She told me that she didn't see it, and I proceeded with a ""Well, you probably know more than I.""  What a horrible film!!

I had no idea what was happening for any of this film.  What was the relationship between Holm and Richardson all about?  I thought that he was the father of her child, but then he isn't, but then maybe he is ... WE NEED SOME SORT OF CONSISTENCY HERE PEOPLE!!!  I understand that this film has some respect to it because it was directed by Mike Newell (of Four Weddings and a Funeral fame), but this film really didn't make any sense to me.  Now I watch movies very closely because I don't want to miss anything elaborate, but even if I watched this film for a second time I still think that I wouldn't catch half of it.

This was Richardson's worst role ever.  She screamed most of her lines urging me to almost want to use the subtitles.  Everett tries too hard to be the clichd ""uncatchable"" male figure in this film, but I just didn't see him as the part.  Holm, well, if I knew what Holm's role in this film was I would be a better person.  It was almost as if he stumbled onto the set by accident and just started acting in some scenes with Richardson and Newell didn't want to take it out.

Nothing was coherent in this film.  The acting was horrible, the story was boring, and there was no string tying this film together.  Instead what you got was a 1000 piece puzzle where the pieces were all from other puzzles.  Nothing seemed to match up.  I understand that sometimes it is good to put into film some major events in our world's history, but I am not sure that the last few months of Ruth Ellis (the last woman hung in England) life was exactly what I needed to get through my life.  This film was so bad that whenever my cat walked by the television his eyes would water and he would have to claw at his ears to make the vision and sound try to disappear.

I have never ... I mean never experienced a film like this.  I am going to end this review now because it is giving me a headache just thinking about it.  This film should definitely have a Mr. Yuck sticker on it prior to renting.  Also, if you get a petition in the mail shortly, it is going to be from me asking to eliminate weapons of mass destruction and replace them with Dance with a Stranger.  It would cause the same amount of damage ... PEEE-EW!!  In the words of Jay Sherman ... the God, the man, the myth ... ""IT STINKS"".

420891,5,6302035279,"If there is one problem with Dance With a Stranger it has to be that inevitably one becomes so mesmerized with the performance of Miranda Richardson there is a danger of missing the other performances. The nuances of her character's brittle emotions are perfectly pitched with the arch of penciled eyebrows, the tightening of blood-red lips, and the lisp of her tense voice. A total victim of her own weakness she is drawn into an emotionally and physically abusive relationship, but is powerless to escape. Even under the wing of a man who truly loves her, she throws his devotion aside in a reckless and indeed masochistic spiral. In Richardson's potrayal Ruth Ellis seems almost to crave the violence and mercurial passion, watch her eyes and face as Blakely hits her. The movie drips ambience, wonderfully creating the London nightclub scene in the early 50's. Costumes and makeup are impeccable. Superlative performances from Ian Holm and Rupert Everett, and indeed all members of the cast. Mike Newell has taken a wonderful slice of an evocative era and portrayed a tragedy that we must hope, could never have reached such an awful conclusion today.

420892,5,6302035279,"This a rivoting story, made all the more incredible given the fact that it is based on the true-life events surrounding the life of Ruth Ellis, the last women to be hanged in the UK. The casting of Miranda Richardson as the love obsessed, call girl in a seedy London hostess club is inspiried to say the least. The intensity of her character in all its frailty and flaws is meticulously portrayed by Richardson. As she endures disappointment and humiliation at the hands of her young lover, David Blakley, (Mike Newell) her obsessive love grows to a heated frenzy, as she is compelled to distroy the object of her obsession.
Rubert Everett deserves kudos for his flawless recreation of the seedy London night-life as seen through the eyes of the denizens of the hostesss club. The overall effect I felt in watching Dance With Stranger was like unwittingly being pulled into a strange and troubling atmosphere...Almost like being in a place where the undercurrent of danger and intrigue have a grasp on you and you can not let go.
