2907520,3,B000TM1CLA,"Known for outlandish embellishment in her own storytelling, Margaret Mitchell herself might have giggled her way through this movie's version of her life.  This bio of the author of ""Gone With The Wind"" originally aired on NBC back in 1994, and stars (are you sitting down?) Shannen Doherty in the title role. Ms. Doherty does a surprisingly fair job of capturing Mitchell's rebellious nature.  Plus, the actress was born in Memphis and so her Southern accent is tolerable.  Ultimately, however, most of the facts presented are outrageously construed to turn Margaret into Scarlett O'Hara and her first husband Red Upshaw into some version of Rhett Butler.  The script gets only the names right.  This being said, the movie is lots of fun and certainly worth seeing at least once.",1196380800,4,780,5.015503875968992
2907521,5,B000TM1CLA,At last A Burning Passion: The Margaret Mitchell Story has finally been relised in the USA. A great movie about the events that sparked the writing of the great American novel Gone With the Wind.  The casting is good as well as the scrip that make this a must see.  The cover art on this DVD is beautiful. It a shame that amazon does not have it pictured on the site.  A bargen at under $10!,1190073600,9,391,4.118421052631579

8210179,3,B000TM1CLA,"If you like ""Gone with the wind"", you will like this. It's the story of the woman who wrote it. Shannen Doherty is a talented actress. Her accent sounds a little fake, because it is fake, but that is my only criticism. Margaret Mitchell's real life was the inspiration for her book ""Gone with the wind"".",1485561600,,303,4.428571428571429

8210185,4,B000TM1CLA,"""A Burning Passion"" is inevitably Hollywoodized a bit, but by and large it provides a true account of the younger years of Margaret Mitchell -- from girlhood, to her wild days as an Atlanta flapper, to the astonishing success of her one and only novel, ""Gone With the Wind."" Her first husband, Red, is portrayed as a real cad, and that is right on target. John Marsh, though, becomes Peggy's lifesaver at a time when she is totally at sea. Shannen Doherty does fine indeed in the role of a brilliant but flighty author. As made-for-television movies go, this one is better than most. Any enthusiast of GWTW and the intriguing, short life of Peggy Mitchell Marsh will find much to enjoy.",1379721600,5,686,4.631147540983607
8210186,5,B000TM1CLA,"What an awesome movie which follows the life of Margaret Mitchell, author of Gone with the Wind. As you watch this movie that traces the life of Margaret Mitchell from childhood through her adult life and then the success of her only book, you will be amazed at the events in her own personal life that are paralleled in the story she told in Gone with the Wind. I've only had this DVD a few weeks and have already watched it three times. Each time I find more interesting tidbits about her life.",1367452800,2,496,4.344086021505376
