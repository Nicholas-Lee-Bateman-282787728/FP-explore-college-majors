1409441,5,B000059RNA,"I grew up on Stingray so I would preface by saying that I am
marginally bias to this release. This is the one I've been waiting for and it has finally arrived.
Having experienced the adventures of Troy Tempest as an eager child hungry for thrills, chills and spills, this is the ticket. What truly astounds is the timeless nature of Gerry Anderson's work. Being 40 years of age and fired up about Stingray is a beautiful thing.  And sharing it simultaneously with your kids is beyond words! Going further, I would hint at this being a unique and unforgettable experience that the whole family can enjoy.  Bottom line:  Go for the gold and shell out the clams!  For those tired of the same old same old, rediscover the magic of ""Supermarionation"" as only Gerry Anderson can provide.  This truly is marvelous and genius, all wrapped up into one.  It is highly unlikely you will be disappointed with your purchase. Enjoy.",1040774400,7,918,4.670807453416149

From the opening announcement (Stand By For Action!

Stingray is great all the way around. The characters are great. The voice actors bring the Marionette actors to life. The sets have had great attention paid to every detail and Amazon's Instant Video makes it possible to watch all the episodes from virtually anywhere. I've ordered the Stingray series and the Thunderbird series to watch with my grandkids. Fortunately, my kids saw Thunderbirds Are Go on VHS and loved it, so my Mom, my wife and I, our two children and our grand kids are getting together on my birthday to watch these shows on DVD!

1409479,5,B000059RNA,"Stingray was one Gerry Anderson series that I never caught in its original airings. Then, years ago, it played regularly on cable and I regretted having missed it during the first go round. For me, the Anderson marionette productions had an arc of quality overall. The early outings -- Supercar and Fireball XL5 were technically crude but had adequate stories and character interactions. The later examples -- Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet, for example -- were technically excellent but were deficient in character development. Stingray seems to have sat at the apex of that curve, boasting an excellent puppet cast, nuanced plots, and a high degree of technical expertise. Overall, I think it's the best of all the Anderson shows -- even or especially counting the ones with real people. If you haven't entered this surreal universe, this is the best place to start in terms of balance quality. And in the meantime, Stand By For Action!",1356480000,2,940,5.032051282051282
1409480,5,B000059RNA,"Product arrived in timely manner, and even though they were used. All the DVD's are in great shape.  I had been looking for these for several years, as I had purchased the whole series of Thunderbirds. This sparked memories of this series.  I told my husband when they arrived, that I'd be in front of the T.V. set with my bowl of cereal, re- living Saturday Morning cartoons... although these are not cartoons, but they were part of my Saturday Morning cartoon favorites.",1355097600,,472,4.674698795180723
1409481,5,B000059RNA,"Anything can happen in the next half hour?  It usually didn't but who cares?  Sure the W.A.S.P. (World Aquanaut Security Patrol) crew might meet an underwater version of an alien creature or a bad guy who knows all about the oh so top secret Marineville and wants to destroy it (for unknown reasons since really the fine folk at Marineville always seems to help them out) but really the action in the end just kind of zips by and often the height of the action isn't  even shown.  Doesn't matter.  It's still an addicting must see show.

From the theme song with virtually no words that you'll remember (you will be singing Stingray... Stingray... a lot) to the drum beat warning sounds to the bumbling clumsy bad guys who use magical makeup that changes their whole appearance to the fact that our heroes always visit the bad guys house (lair?) and never recognize it the next time -- this is all just too good.  Cheesy may not be the right word as it really was  different for its time and its something between a kids show and a general all age show.  While cheesy might be too strong of a word, it's also not exactly something you can take too seriously.  Still it does build itself around storylines that are generic enough and timeless that they still hold up today:  oil at sea being handled not so well, oceanlife and modern human needs conflicting with one another, governments being overthrown, etc.  And yeah, for the adults there is what appears to be a love triangle, it's just that it is more implied than truly explored as a true storyline.

Also, you must watch the behind the scenes feature.  It will make you appreciate this show even more.  Much like the 3D of today, these guys and gals spent hours and hours and days and days to get even the smallest thing to look as good as it did.  So while some people today might be a little surprised to see puppet strings and find the whole show lower production value by today's standards, it's really an amazing piece of tv history (including being the first show of its kind in color).",1301184000,,2049,4.482479784366577

1409484,4,B000059RNA,"I used to watch this one also on tv in the 1960's. To me at that time I thought it was really cool. Since I saw supercar I started watching the half hour episodes of Stingray. I liked the way that Gerry Anderson put together those kind of episodes also I liked his puppetry. The episodes were so put together that it seemed like the puppets were almost human and did things that us humans do. So for me that's why I bought Gerry Anderson's Stingray. This video collection is good for anyone of any age.

1409485,5,B000059RNA,"I had bought Thunderbirds and enjoyed it; therefore, thought I'd purchase Stingray. Wow! it puts Thunderbirds to shame.  I enjoy every minute of this show. I highly recommend it. I could look at it over and over.",1247616000,2,212,4.72972972972973
1409486,4,B000059RNA,"This series came right before Thunderbirds, and had much of the same aesthetic.  Here's the lowdown: this is the first one in color (which adds a lot to the faux-underwater charm of the sets, lots of marine greens & blues), and more importantly, this one shares the ""freedom of movement"" approach that the Thunderbirds marionettes had.  If you aren't aware, the series that came after Thunderbirds (Captain Scarlett and Joe 90), while still of interest, opted for a VERY restricted puppet movement approach, in order to make them more ""realistic"" -- lots of sitting and standing still, almost no walking.  This series, however, has the ""marionette bob"" when they walk, just like Thunderbirds.  I know this may sound like a slight thing, but it adds IMMENSELY to the old-school charm, letting the figures bob on their strings instead of fixing them to the floor for ""realism"".  Very entertaining as well, nearly as much as Thunderbirds (though the action sequences in Thunderbirds can't be matched).",1245110400,3,998,5.060975609756097
1409487,5,B000059RNA,What more can I say than the title above? Those of us who grew up watching shows like this nowadays wonder what the hell the executives are thinking putting on such crap-ola on TV and expect children to watch what they produce. Cartoon Network = CRAP !!!!!!!!,1243209600,,259,4.531914893617022
1409488,5,B000059RNA,"There are better reviews than mine to read. But you have got to see this show. From the moment the action packed theme song hits (which you'll soon want to play very loudly) to the end of each episode, your interest will be more than held. In a commentary by Gerry Anderson he mentions he doesn't like the Atlanta puppet. I don't know why he said that. Personally I think she looks hot. And Marina the beautiful mute sea woman will definately tug at your heartstrings. There's even a moment in the second episode that's very emotional where Marina is believed to be an assassin. Thunderbirds may have been a bigger commercial success, but compared to Stingray it's really quite boring. With most sellers selling this set for astoundingly low prices you should really take the chance and order it. There's a lot more to this show than I described, but I figure since other reviews give more detail why repeat them. 39 episodes in all.",1239235200,6,933,4.626506024096385
1409489,5,B000059RNA,"I have vague memories of watching this show when it was first broadcast in the U.S.  At that time I was still too young to understand the plots.  Watching it as an adult (and in color, yet) was a revelation.  45 years later, it still looks great.  The puppeteering, which pushed the technological envelope as far as possible for 1964; the top-notch voice acting; the detailed miniatures; the frequently clever plots, which pack a lot of action into a half-hour's running time; the amusing pop-culture references; the gorgeous costumes (check out Atlanta's kimono in the extras section on disk 5); the sets, which are designed down to the smallest detail--the amount of work, sweat, and love which went into this series is staggering.

Does this show still work for kids?  Recently I screened the first few episodes for my cousin's 2 daughters (ages 6 and 8) and they were enthralled.  They didn't care about the visible marionette wires.  (They also didn't care for X2-Zero and the mechanical fish; but booing the villains in a melodrama is par for the course).  Why does this show, which by all rights should appear obsolete to an audience weaned on the latest CGI from Pixar and Dreamworks, still rock?  If I had to boil it down to one word that word would be: charm.  Stingray is charming.  There is just something about watching real flesh-and-blood puppets (so to speak) moving about a real (if miniature) set which CGI cannot match.  It's the same quality which makes Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion animated critters so beloved by so many.  The physicality of it is seductive--it can make us believe, if only for the duration of a show, in a kind of childhood magic: that a plaything, a construction of metal, plastic and cloth can live and speak.",1239062400,4,1752,4.796666666666667
1409490,5,B000059RNA,"You wouldn't think it'd be possible to imbue a puppet series with all the flamboyant colour and camp of the 1960's - yet here it is.

'Stingray' is gloriously of its time. A deliciously CGI-free world of deep-sea despots, mechanical war-fish, relentless xenophobia and populist rough justice.
It's the completely believable adventures of the Marineville-based World Aquanaut Security Patrol: Troy Tempest, Phones, Atlanta, Commander Shore, exiled sea-nymph Marina, and their self-righteous policing of nasty races skulking and scheming at the bottom of the sea. (And now to the serious stuff....!)

Much fun's to be had spotting the real folk the puppets are based on: Marina is obviously Ursula Andress, Shore displays more than a hint of Spencer Tracy, evil scourge Surface Agent X 2 Zero's voice is clearly Peter Lorre - in fact only Tempest himself remains unclear. I always thought it may be some early 60's crooner like Dickie Valentine - the jury's out anyway.
([Edit]: Someone suggested James Garner which is a great call!)

'Stingray' has the most exciting opening credits sequence of any tv series ever.
Oil rigs collapse, a whole marine base disappears underground, huge noisy war-planes raze the sky, explosions, shootings, missiles, a jarring jump from black and white to vivid colour; all accompanied by the rousing and urgent theme music, in my opinion never bettered, by Barry Gray.

On the un-PC front 'Stingray' is a joy. The 'Loch Ness Monster' episode is APPALLINGLY offensive and the WASPs seem to a have a very civilised - if unfashionable - shoot-on-site policy;
Phones: ""Hey Troy, I'm picking up a small craft on the echo-finder.""
Tempest: ""Prepare Sting Missiles!"" .
They smoke, drink, play poker and there's an underwater prison: Aquatraz (!) which makes Guantanamo Bay look like the Holiday Inn.

The 60's endorsed sexism is admirably emphatic. Both female characters have massive crushes on Tempest (of course) but instead of filling his boots, he acts so gallant, coy and condescending - he gets neither.
Personally - although Andress/Marina is desirably mute - I'd go for Atlanta.
She's a hot red-head, dreamily voiced by old Moneypenny herself Lois Maxwell, and is the daughter of Commander Shore, so there's more chance of promotion...

The only down-side to 'Stingray' is that it was commissioned for children so no-one gets even slightly killed.",1236038400,3,2379,5.198433420365535

1409492,5,B000059RNA,Supermarionation tv is great stuff! I love this series! I used to watch this when I was a kid. It is so nice to be able to see it 40 years later.,1235001600,,145,3.5625
1409493,5,B000059RNA,"STINGRAY was on Saturday morning television right after Tom & Jerry. It was a must for me. Stingray was the first of Gerry Anderson's supermarionation series, to be seen in color. I've have seen SUPERCAR and FIREBALL XL-5. As each series progressed, the better it got. I'm fan of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. As the series progressed over the seasons, the focus was on the Seaview and the new technology being created by Admiral Nelson. What I loved about Stingray, the series focused on the characters. Stingray was the perfect example of Good versus Evil and the good guys always won in the end. Stingray itself, a super submarine that was equipped with the latest technology, added to the appeal of the series. Even though Stingray was on for one season, its success and the way it was presented, led to the THUNDERBIRDS. Gerry Anderson did create live action series such as UFO and Space:1999. They did well in syndication. The supermarionation series such as Stingray and the Thunderbirds, is work that Gerry Anderson will be best known for. Stingray or any other of Gerry Anderson's series, is a must for anyones collection.",1226966400,2,1134,4.790816326530612
1409494,5,B000059RNA,"Again great special effects by Derek Meddings and music by Barry G.  I can add very little to what others have said except that the character stuff and lives off the ship were well explored, and some great humor.  Compare this to Voyage to The Bottom of the Sea.  A good show but stories never covered the lives of the crew in such depth.  The puppets may be akin to wooden but they sure weren't as wooden as those of live actors in so many sci-fi shows.",1208649600,,454,4.183908045977011
1409495,4,B000059RNA,"Much has already been written about this DVD set.  The plots are simple and fun, the characters have a some depth to them.  It's kinda funny to watch marionettes smoking cigars after hours, or sweating when under pressure.  One of the things that I think appeals to kids about this series (and other Gerry Anderson series) is that the crafts and puppets look like toys that would be fun to play with.  The first thing my son commented on when he saw Stingray was how neat it would be to have a Stingray sub of his own.
Another thing about this program that is striking is the attention to detail and special effects.  The designers and puppeteers were obviously very serious about creating believable environments and lifelike characters.  And there is surprisingly very little recycled footage throughout the series.  Compare that to Battlestar Galactica for example, which routinely used recycled footage for their spaceship battles, and Stingray is way older than Battlestar Galactica and probably had a much smaller budget to work with.  The music is also top notch, and is very effective in bringing the emotion of scenes to life.

In all, it's a very well done and imaginative series which has aged quite well, and is a lot of fun for both boys and girls (at least mine).  It's fun for parents too.

The program has been nicely restored for DVD.  It looks great.  Hard to believe it came out in 1964.  I did have a couple of problems with my DVD's.  On a few episodes on disk 1 the sound does not track correctly and is about 1 sec behind the video.  I solved this problem by pausing it and scanning backwards to the beginning of the first explosion.  After that it tracks fine.  Also, the final episode will not play from the menu.  I had play the ending of the second to last episode and scan forward until the final starts.  Then it it plays.  I don't know if this is just a problem with the DVD's or maybe my player.  It's a minor annoyance, and not worth the bother of returning the set since I bought DVD's from an online vender for about $26.00.  Everything else plays great.",1197590400,2,2088,4.538873994638069
1409496,5,B000059RNA,"episodes are ligh years ahead of the previous series 'Supercar', and 'Fireball XL5'. In glorious color too. Wonderful characters and marvelous stories. Great for young kiddies and middle-aged people alike. What I love the most is that they are not 'over the top' with technical gimmics (guess they did not have too many back then), like that 'groan' over-used 360 degree slow-motion pnaing the bullet through the air (enough said)--Highly enjoyable and it's flaws add to it's wonderful charms--not pristine, not clinical mega produced hype--just good clean",1176854400,2,556,5.402298850574713
1409497,5,B000059RNA,"I had this vague recollection of a show I watched as a child ... underwater, marionette puppets, submarine, mermaid ... that's all I could remember.  Browsing at a used book store I found several Gerry Anderson DVD sets ... then I saw Stingray!  (...).  Or at least that's what I was thinking.  Sure enough it was the show I remembered from my childhood.  I was thrilled.  Then my son, age 8, started watching too.  He ended up watching ALL the episodes over a couple of days then wondered if there were any toys.  An online auction search uncovered Stingray toys and we are happily awaiting the arrival of our very own Stingray ship from London, England. P.S.

1409498,5,B000059RNA,"I recently became enamoured of the works of Gerry Anderson, the first being his live action projects (UFO & Space: 1999) and I never thought that I would actually find myself buying any of his puppet projects, but low and behold I found myself acquiring both Captain Scarlet and Stingray.  And I haven't regretted that decision since.
Stingray is a marvelous show, yes it is a puppet show, and it's hard to take the show seriously considering that these are marionettes taken in dangerous situations, but it doesn't matter.  it's just a fun show to watch regardless, because the production value is very high and very exceptional with the action sequences.  When I watch Stingray, I feel like a kid again.  I love the characters, Troy Tempest, Phones, Commander Shore, Atlanta and of course the beautifully silent Marina.  What would've been interesting was if Marina could actually speak, who would've provided the voice?  But I think on the other hand, she works well as a silent character, because her actions speak a lot louder than mere words.
I especially like the opening sequence with the announcement of 'Stand by for action!'  and given the present climate of global terrorism, when you hear Commander Shore's proclamation that 'Anything can happen in the next half-hour' you can't help but feel some chills.  It's action packed, with some very excellent characters and humour that makes you feel good inside.  Definitely a must have for any SuperMarionation fan.",1064448000,15,1473,5.004098360655738
1409499,5,B000059RNA,"Stingray is part three in the Gerry Anderson five part development (and eventual perfection) of marionette based shows. 'Supercar"" was crude and campy good 1960 kidshow fun. ""Fireball XL5"" had significant improvements in technique. ""Stingray"" was in color and was a dramatic leap ahead in set design, marionette action, scripting, and special effects. ""Thunderbirds"" remains the best of the lot with hour long scripts, ""gee whiz!"" special effects, some funny character development (such as the humourously  irritable dialogue of the pyramid explorers in ""The Uninvited""), and action scenes. Stingray is famous for its underwater special effects which were advanced for 1963-64. No one had seen anything like it up until then. Stingray has the best fully developed characters with Troy, Phones, Atlanta, and Marina. Stingray is enjoyable and highly nostalgic.",1056672000,26,858,5.6
1409500,5,B000059RNA,"These are 60's programs restored for DVD. The picture is very good considering the source, and the sound is good. There is an occasional skip in sound at the start of some episodes, but I haven't had any problems during the episode itself.
Stingray is a nuclear powered super-submarine capable of 600 knots while submerged. The plot of each episode either involves conflict with the evil Titan, leader of an underwater race, or daring ocean rescues. Kids will enjoy the simple plots while adults will be amused at the inconsistencies of the plot devices.
In the first episode, Stingray investigates the destruction of a drone submarine and is attacked by Titan's forces. This is ""first contact"" between ""Terrarians"" and oceanic people. In subsequent episodes, Stingray meets numerous other oceanic cultures, some friendly and others belligerent. All technologically advanced. There's no explanation of why some cultures hate humans, nor why friendly cultures hadn't made any sort of contact prior to Titan's attack. Of course, it's immaterial to the seven-year olds that the series is aimed at.
We bought the DVD's to provide entertaining TV to our kids without the sex, violence and coarseness that is endemic to modern television. There is mild violence in Stingray, but it is of the simple ""good versus evil"" variety, and generally abstract in nature. You might see one of Titan's submarines hit by a torpedo, but you won't see one of Titan's soldiers being killed. Gun battles are usually resolved by something heavy landing on the bad guys with enough force to stun them but no more. Good guys and bad guys are awful shots when aiming at each other, but the good guys are super accurate when they have to aim at an inanimate object.
Being 60's television, and British to boot, smoking and drinking are shown as normal activities by our heroes. The lead heroes are white males, but there are two strong female characters and the head of the unit is disabled. I think the design for his hovering ""wheelchair"" was lifted for a Star Trek episode a decade later.
All in all, good entertainment for today's kids and a fun stroll down memory lane for those old enough to remember ""anything can happen in the next half hour"" in front of a tiny black and white television. (The DVD is in color though).",1041984000,17,2298,4.864795918367347
