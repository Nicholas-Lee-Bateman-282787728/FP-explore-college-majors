However, parents of such a child have to treat it like any other child and not make excuses for its bad behavior simply because it has a disability.  This is a very educational DVD.",1444867200,,287,4.588235294117647

8178594,5,B000NJM6EG,"This is the story of 3 year old Gabby from Minnesota, 7 year old Miriam from Norway, and 10 year old Jamilah from Germany.  Each one of these children share an exceedingly rare and dangerous disease called Congenital Insensitivity to Pain.  What is normally disliked but crucial to humans is the ability to feel pain and react accordingly to its effects.  This keeps us safe, alerts us to injury and illness, and protects us from countless things.

In the world of Gabby, Miriam, and Jamilah, they cannot experience pain in any way, shape or form and therefore have a difficult time understanding the perilous situation they are in.  This program looks at the struggles they have all faced growing up with this problem and it is both shocking and heartbreaking to learn of all the terrible injuries they have suffered over time.

Needless to say, the hard work, dedication and love that the parents and family members show toward these special little girls is uplifting and quite admirable.  Because of the constant supervision given them and the specialized care used in certain instances, these children are leading healthy and productive lives today.  It is very pleasing to see their happiness and their being able to engage in a variety of everyday activities that all kids enjoy.

`A Life Without Pain' is an interesting and oftentimes emotional documentary but definitely a rewarding one also.  This film was an official selection of the 2005 South by Southwest festival and was also featured on the Oprah Winfrey Show.",1184803200,3,1526,4.949019607843137
