4666676,4,B005ELVCT8,"My family enjoyed watching these four movies. My Fake Fiance was hilarious, as well as the Revenge of the Bridesmaids. But the other two weren't as really good as these. They're fun to watch one time but not repeatedly. It gets boring. But for the price it was good.",1380326400,,266,4.448979591836735
4666677,5,B005ELVCT8,"I have only watched 2 movies so far, and have loved them both.  Princess: A modern fairytale was charming to watch.  At first I thought the princess was a little bit awkward, but then I realized it suited her character because she had been isolated for so long with mostly mythical creatures for company.  I also love, love, love the dresses she wears in this movie - each one absolutely gorgeous, and would be dream dresses for any little girl.  There are some people who say this isn't really a family movie because there is a couple of references to gay people (so subtle I don't think kids would understand anyway), and they also refer to the princess as the virgin princess (if kids ask you could always tell them it means pure - which it does).  I admit I wouldn't let my ten year old daughter watch this just yet, but from the ages of twelve and up should be fine.

Revenge of the Bridesmaids is now one of my favourite movies.  Raven-Symon is an absolute delight in this.  She has so much sass and attitude, you can't help loving her character.  I read one person's review who said this movie is the way ""Bridesmaids"" should have been, and I totally agree.  There is no gross humour.  The two main love stories are so sweet.  And it's genuinely funny.  Once again there are a couple of references which are not suitable for very young children (although I don't think they would understand anyway), but from the age of twelve and up should be ok.  As an adult, I thought it was a lovely movie with no swearing, violence or nudity.  We need more movies like this.

I haven't watched the other 2 movies yet (my fake fiance and Au Pair 3), but I'm a fan of Melissa Joan Hart so I'm looking forward to watching her movie.",1365465600,3,1725,4.377358490566038

8468584,5,B005ELVCT8,"I bought this pack for My Fake Fiance and Revenge of the Bridesmaids. I have also seen Princess. And while it was cute, the plot was a little too ""fantasy"" for my taste. But My Fake Fiance and Revenge of the Bridesmaids are two of my favorite made-for-tv movies. Melissa Joan Hart and Joey Lawrence are great together. In MFF. And it's a lot of fun to watch the girls' shenanigans in ROTB. I am excited to see Au Pair 3. I imagine I'll like it as much as the rest.",1465948800,,464,4.1098901098901095
