Carlos Saura is great in  making this film, but he is smart enough to choose one of the greatest masterpieces of Spaniard culture from an all-time poet and playwright Federico Garcia Lorca. I whish I could  buy this film as well as some others from this great director.",930182400,3,290,4.78
2350201,5,B000A1MVWO,"Bodas de Sangre-la obra maestra de Carlos Saura donde el bailarin y coreografo espaol Antonio Gades nos da una muestra de la magnificencia del genial Garcia Lorca a traves del flamenco.  Gades esta sensacional al igual  que su cuerpo de ballet. Cabe mencionar la magnifica interpretacion de  ""La Nana"" por una de las mejores voces femeninas de Espaa, la  grandiosa Pepa Flores mejor conocida como Marisol.  Lastima que el  ""soundtrack"" de esta joya visual y musical no este accesible.  Ver los bailes y oir a la diva espaola Marisol, bien vale la pena.",928800000,2,552,4.870967741935484

8072312,5,B000A1MVWO,"I'd heard of this film when it was in the cinemas but I never saw it and to be honest I wasn't quite sure what to expect. It is superb; the film opens with the dancers and musicians arriving for a rehearsal and getting into make-up and costumes. The director then runs a warm-up in which they practice a new dance sequences then they run the whole show as if it were a dress rehearsal; no audience, no lights, just the performers.

The performances are wonderful, the choreography is inventive and the music is beautiful. You don't need to have seen Lorca's play to follow the dance, although a quick glance at the plot is helpful.

Highly recommended.",1219795200,,652,4.516949152542373
8072313,5,B000A1MVWO,"Carlos Saura `s flamboyant style is carved in relief in this notable chamber work that retains the primordial dramatic nucleus in the adaptation of Federico Garcia Lorca `s play . With a minimum of resources economy you will understand why Saura was then in the peak of his heights.

A true masterpiece!",1160611200,,303,4.826923076923077
8072314,5,B000A1MVWO,"This, as said above, is a masterpiece in film as well as in dancing (Flamenco) terms. A group of dancers stages ""bodas de sangre"" in a small dance hall, transporting you to Garcia Lorca's play almost magically. This Flamenco is the most courageous and character and personality-filled dance, compared only probably to bullfighting itself.

The story: Two universes collide 1) a young and handsome groom soon to marry a bride, the happy mother of the groom and a bride who is in love with a married man 2) the family of the married man; himself (Antonio Gades who by the way is THE MONSTER personality here), his wife who suspects he is in love with the bride and their baby son. The collision takes place in the middle of a Spanish town soon to celebrate the wedding.

If you read Garcia Lorca's play you will learn that the married man belongs to a family of lovers and killers, all in the words of the mother of the groom.

The first general scene reveals a central part of the first universe: the mother and the groom rehearsing and getting ready for the wedding. The groom is so filled with joy, his eyes glitter for what is soon to happen. The mother warns that he should not take his knife; ""he will not be needing it"". ""I'll use it to cut a flower for you"" he says (everything is done dancing since no word is spoken but music). Nevertheless the mother insists; the knife stays.

The second general scene is in the house of the married man. His wife rocks their son in the cradle while the most beautiful song is sung. He arrives and she accuses him of caring little for the house, of spending too much time out. She tries to tell him ""Can't you see that I love you?"" but he shows little care for her; he wants to lift his son in arms but she denies him of touching his son in reprisal. This man is suffering for his lover, the bride who is to marry soon. He parts to the streets leaving his wife irritated (to say the least) but clearly passionately in love and longing for him.

Third scene, married man and bride dream about each other or else have a last loving encounter and then dream about each other (all dancing). They show their pain in the most beautiful flamenco while the acting is superb.

Next people from the town go to hail the bride to the wedding with another wonderful song ""Despierte la novia que despierte, ruede la ronda que ruede"" (Wake up the bride for the morning of her wedding). You will hear a ""haaaaa"" being sung at the end of this other song that will remind you of the English Patient and thus of the Arabic occupation of Spain that took place for over 600 years. She throws her bouquet to the ground in denial and refusal; a girl friend picks it up to put it back into her hands.

The wedding starts and the most wonderful ""pasodoble"" is the second song sung: ""Sombrero"". It is a song to ""my"" black hat, ""you who have witnessed so many kisses and love promises to so many beautiful girls that now cry in sight of their deceit; so many promises (of mine) carried away by the wind"" (ha!). If any English speaking person could study the lyrics to this song she would find it fascinating. It is almost a guy in love with his hat and thus with himself and reveals a little of Gades' character, who is about to steel the bride. At a point the pasodoble says: ""My sombrero, you that has such a bullfighting way about you (such a bullfighting -meaning proud and courageous way about you- whenever I take you to the bullfights"". Is that not pure poetry? Is it not to grasp the strength and intensity of these intense feelings of mental youth, towards what all art aspires to? BTW a wonderful ""wedding picture"" piece is majestically performed in this section.

The bride dances ""sombrero"" with several attendants to the wedding. Antonio Gades circles the dance like a shark waiting for the kill, wearing his black hat. Suddenly he has his chance to dance with the bride. They are split by the wife of the married man who senses too much passion in this seemingly courteous gesture of the bride to one of her guests.

The dance goes on as the wife of the married man and the bride seem to defy each other with flamenco steps as each guarding her turf. The bride (Cristina Hoyos in real life) makes the hairs in your whole body stand up.

The bride excuses herself for a while but actually runs away in a horse with the married man. The wife of the married man comes crashing into the dance with loud and firm flamenco steps denouncing and pointing towards the road taken by the departed, the bride and her longed for husband. So she would rather have him killed that have him abandon her?

The mother of the groom takes a knife (just like the one she had previously withheld) from a guest and gives it to his son. The son takes it and runs after her bride (by now wife since the wedding actually took place) but after a few steps feels weak-in-the-knees and turns to her mother for any expression. The mother with a simple gesture tells him ""you must find the courage within you; go kill him"".

A party of men goes with the groom after the bride and the married man, all on horseback. It is the groom that finds them. They both get down from their horses, take out their knifes and have the most extraordinary dance piece you have ever witnessed in slow motion, not achieved by the camera, but by the dancers themselves. Knifes swing by neck and gut on both sides while the bride, hysterically and beside herself is screaming in agony like a Picasso painting (of course not a scream is heard but only the music and the hea! hea! hea! from the singers; a hea which is used to say ""hea toro!"" ""hea toro venga!"" and thus is an incitation to courage, a ""c'mon, give me all you got"". So you say -hea!-  too to a fine spanish horse when asking from him a collected proud gallop).

I have probably told you a lot and this little of the ending I will not spoil, but if you own or see this film you will find yourself one of the luckiest people alive. You will never want it to leave your side and, as with the English Patient, you will see it over and over again. The plot BTW is exactly the same as ThEP, will the ending be too?

8072315,4,B000A1MVWO,"It is a flamenco film...Saura style...Gades is a great dancer but the real treat here is the appearance of the magnificent Pepa Flores, the once known singer and actress named Marisol. A superb voice added to the lullaby...what a treat!!!! The few snapshots of her are worth it as is the sound of her voice through the scene. Don't miss it!!",969753600,9,341,4.60655737704918
8072316,5,B000A1MVWO,"I saw this film a number of years ago, but still remember vividly the passion of the dance and the film style.  I feel that it is fitting that this piece of literature should have been translated into flamenco, because  de Lorca was a great lover of the art form.  I study flamenco with a woman  from Cadiz, Spain, who sings and dances many of the great songs that he  wrote the lyrics for, and she says that he was often quoted as saying that  flamenco was deeper than the deepest part of the deepest ocean.  So, I  guess it goes to say that this is a film not to be merely watched, but  intensly felt, as not only the story of Blood Wedding, but in the duende,  or soul, of the dancers portraying it.  If you are looking for mere  entertainment, this is not for you.  If you are looking for something to  engage your passions, soul, and mind--take a look.",953596800,19,857,4.209876543209877
8072317,2,B000A1MVWO,"I watched ""Bodas de Sangre"" as part of a Hispanic Literature and Film class.  Our goal was to compare novels and plays with their cinematic adaptations.  After reading the play, I was greatly intregued, more so than  any other time in the class, to see how it would transfer on to the screen.  However, that intrerue quickly turned into a great anxiety to leave the  movie.  As a person who is not very experienced with dance, it was somewhat  difficult to transfer what I gained from the play over to an understanding  of the movie.  It made the movie far too boring for myself and everyone in  the room with me.  By concentrating almost entirely on the use of the  Flamenco to tell the story, Saura loses a great deal of his potential  audience.  Not everyone is an expert in interpreting what certain types of  dance moves are supposed to suggest and as a result those people are going  to feel at a loss when watching this movie.  A greater use of dialogue  would have vastly improved the quality of the adaptation as well as  allowing a much larger audience to appreciate the terrific story that  Frederico Garcia Lorca originally created. On the bright side for me, a  person who typically favors the movie over the written version...This  experience has taught me to have more of an appreciation for the latter.",945561600,,1318,4.6147186147186146
8072318,1,B000A1MVWO,"After viewing Carlos Saura's version of Carmen, I was quite interested and inspired by his incorporation of the flamenco dance.  Therefore, with the same hope and aspirations of a rhythmic form of entertainment, I anxiously  watched his visual adaptation of Bodas de sangre (Blood Wedding).  To my  displeasure, Blood Wedding lacks the charisma and appeal that initially  lured me to this style of film.  Moreover, it is more than a boring,  disappointing film; it is a disgrace to Federico Garca Lorca's original,  theater version of the tale.
 Even though Blood Wedding is only an  hour and fifteen minutes long, I could not wait until the credits appeared  on the screen.  The first half of the movie tediously documents how  performers prepare themselves before they step onto the stage.  It  unnecessarily covers everything from their arrival to the application of  their make-up to a warm-up dance routine.  As the first segment eventually  concludes with a change of wardrobe, I hoped and prayed that the remainder  of the film would be filled with flashy dance routines and passionate  battles.
 However, if you have the same hopes, do not hold your  breath.  The second part of the movie is a loose adaptation of the theater  work in which all actions (which primarily include a marriage ceremony and  a deadly fight) are portrayed through the flamenco dance.  However, since  there is no dialogue besides some sporadic ballads, the plot is difficult  to follow unless you have read the book.  Even then, the second part is  very meaningless and dull.  In addition, since there is no change in  scenery, the monotonous white walls create a forty-minute prison experience  in which I could not wait to escape.  As a result, it is not uncommon to  find oneself absent-mindedly staring at the dancers' feet in search of some  form of entertainment.  And so, if you are seeking a movie to lull you into  a deep sleep, you have chosen the perfect one.  Otherwise, steer away from  this dull, poor excuse of a film.",944697600,8,2018,4.8898809523809526
