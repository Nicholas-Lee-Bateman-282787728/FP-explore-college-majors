8318845,3,B001LNOLO6,Hookers and Vampires everyone wins. Not the best move but worth a watch just for the title. MS3K would be proud.,1402272000,,112,4.380952380952381
8318846,3,B001LNOLO6,"Read the title. If it makes you laugh, you'll probably enjoy the movie. Cheesy in the extreme, plays fast and loose with stereotypes, but it still makes me laugh if I'm in the mood for something this wonderfully bad. John Carradine is, and always will be, the king of the ""B"" movie.",1313280000,3,282,4.4423076923076925
8318847,1,B001LNOLO6,"I have seen a lot of John Carradine movies over the years, but I don't think I'm going out on a limb to suggest that ""Vampire Hookers"" is one of his very, very worst, and that's saying something. Made in the mid 1970s in the Philippines by Cirio H. Santiago, the film takes a shot at the almost always disappointing vampire comedy genre, but spends most of its time on poetry and flatulence. John Carradine plays Richmond Reed, a vampire who lives in a cemetery with three shapely vampire lasses and an inept would-be vampire assistant with an intestinal disorder. Reed claims he was born in 1775, and judging from Carradine's appearance, that's about right. (Side note: was John Carradine born crotchety?) Reed claims that Shakespeare and Walt Whitman were both vampires, and prattles on poetically whenever given the chance; he also mixes his metaphors into untidy new sayings like ""A bird in the hand is worth its weight in gold,"" while drinking vodka and blood cocktails. To clarify this point though, one of the girls states authoritatively that ""I knew Walt Whitman, and he wasn't a vampire!"" Good to know. There are many pointless diversions throughout: the writers threw in everything they could think of. For instance, despite thirsting for human blood, Reed keeps a crossbow ready to go to shoot rats. When he shoots one he says to his gassy henchman ""Get the blood out of that rat before it evaporates."" Before it evaporates? What?

The protagonists are US Navy sailors on shore leave who are looking for women, but stumble only across the vampiritic variety (excepting one very unacceptable scene in a men's room.) As the two sailors, Tom Buckley (Bruce Fairbairn) and Terry Wayne (Trey Wilson) fall into conflict with Carradine and his minions the film devolves to endless trudging through a graveyard, continuity gaffes (e.g. in an apparent homage to Ed Wood one sailor leaves the base early in the morning to arrive minutes later in the graveyard around midnight,) and more padding than you can shake a pillow at. Despite the lurid title, the film is very tame, although one particular element of the film is genuinely ghastly. Or rather, gas-tly. If he's such an experienced vampire, why does Reed employ an imbecilic assistant who makes a tremendous effort to sniff his own flatus (particularly in his own coffin or inside his cloak,) and who also routinely brings both garlic and crucifixes to work with him? You'd think these things would be basic to the vampire henchman profession.

While the flatulence on demand was an annoying and distinctly off-putting facet of the movie, there's much more to appall you here: from the poor image quality (I know it's supposed to be dark, but this is ridiculous,) to the terrible soundtrack (don't miss the closing theme which croons ""Don't get hooked by a hooker...,) and from the dreadful acting (Carradine, Fairbairn, and Wilson are the worst offenders,) to the ridiculous use of poetry, this is a world-class stinker. Hold your nose and run away.",1300147200,5,3009,4.909626719056974
