2055358,5,B000228E8G,"This DVD is absolutely astounding. As a birder myself just the idea of a Red Tail taking up residence on 5th Ave. is great.  He has had more than one mate.  His first,First Love was rehabilitated at The Raptor Trust in New Jersey and released from there.  His second mate was also a Raptor Trust rehabilitated hawk.  My daughter worked at The Raptor Trust for 10 years.  We are all very happy with the success of Pale Male's nesting.  He is a magnificent bird.",1086566400,31,460,4.416666666666667
2055359,5,B000228E8G,I LOVE THIS NATURE FILM.  I GAVE IT TO MY GRANDSONS.  IT IS THE BEST.  THANKS TO EVERYONE WHO MADE IT.,1357862400,,102,3.761904761904762
2055360,5,B000228E8G,This was a wonderful documentary about a hawk in NYC. It was a pleasure to see how he and his mates & babies could bring so much joy to people. It was also cool to see how the people would support Pale Male and were able to influence his circumstances for the good. Getting to know our wild friends is truly a blessing.,1357344000,,319,4.079365079365079
2055361,4,B000228E8G,"To a large extent this story is about Manhattan birders and the Pale Male cultmany of whom are comically eccentric. Another context, not indicated well here, is the growing urbanization of natural wildlife species on the comeback (including coyotes and raptors). For the philosophical implications, listen to Steve Earle's great ode to Pale Male, ""Down Here Below"".",1354752000,,365,5.421052631578948
2055362,5,B000228E8G,"I teach a nature writing course at a high school in Northern California, and this film is one of the many available to my students.  Every year my students check out this film and they love it.  We see red tailed hawks every day and mostly take them for granted, but this film resonates with my students and they end up loving the story, the enthusiasm of the folks in Central Park, and the tenacity of Pale Male!  I get to NYC often and I always make a pilgrimage to Central Park and pay my respect to the place and that very special bird!",1346025600,,540,4.173076923076923
2055363,5,B000228E8G,"I had originally saw this on PBS and liked it enough to later purchase it. I enjoy documentaries and nature programs a lot. This documentary is based on a red-tailed hawk and it's mate starting a family in an unexpected place, a big city. It details the dangers and experiences of the birds. If you enjoy nature programs and documentaries, check this one out!",1324252800,,359,4.625
2055364,5,B000228E8G,My 7 year old loves to watch this over and again.  This is the one the Bronx Zoo sells.,1308009600,,87,3.5789473684210527
2055365,2,B000228E8G,I saw the original and expected this to be the same show - it was not as detailed and informative as the original.  To me it was not worth the price.,1275609600,,149,3.806451612903226
2055366,5,B000228E8G,"Excellent. I view this from time to time and still enjoy it as much as the first time.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nature-Pale-Male/dp/B000228E8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nature - Pale Male</a>",1246147200,2,236,8.875
2055367,5,B000228E8G,"This film has it all -- pathos, love, conflict, loss, and survival -- and all the magnificence of the natural world -- filmed to advantage against the dramatic backdrop of Manhattan.  I was a tad apprehensive that this would be another plodding and overly-didactic nature documentary, but the story unfolds with drama, subtlety, and wit.  We follow not only the truly remarkable hawk, Pale Male, and his mates and offspring, but also their human admirers, and we grow to love them.  In this day and age, it is so refreshing to see the rare feel-good story in which nature thrives and humans do the right thing.",1229126400,8,610,4.735849056603773
2055368,5,B000228E8G,I have watched it with my 70 year old parents and with kids.  It's a lovely story for all ages!,1182902400,10,95,3.75
8020273,5,B000228E8G,"This is a fabulous video of Pale Male, NYC and the diligent followers of him and his family.  I highly recommend it.  My 5 and 7 year old loved it.",1499385600,,147,3.8666666666666667
8020274,5,B000228E8G,Fun to watch with family. Great story.,1472774400,,38,4.571428571428571
8020275,5,B000228E8G,A great documentary! Must-see for all raptor lovers!,1433030400,,52,5.625
8020276,5,B000228E8G,Wonderful story of this iconic bird and his family!,1425513600,,51,4.777777777777778
8020277,5,B000228E8G,Terrific but this version is not the original one. In the first film New Yorkers had the bird's nest removed which produced tragic results. They finally came to their senses but the film you sent me was another version.,1420329600,,219,4.641025641025641
8020278,5,B000228E8G,"Excellent photography and music throughout this incredible story of the history, hawks, and other inhabitants of NYC's magnificent Central Park. More than 5 stars!",1393891200,,163,5.833333333333333
8020279,5,B000228E8G,"Even if you are not into birds, this film will engage you totally.  A red-tail hawk takes up residence on an apartment building next to Central Park and becomes an overnight celebrity.  This could get you started birding if you don't already.  Good for children over the age of 10.",1393891200,,281,4.58
8020280,5,B000228E8G,"I bought this for my mom and she LOVED it. I watched parts of it and it was really good--I live in NYC and have seen Pale Male and his family numerous times--the film brings his life to life in a way that just seeing him flying around can't do because it includes his history and the joys and perils of living in the city. The film definitely draws you in and it's nice to learn about the birders who are so devoted to him and the other redtails. It's a very sweet video (it was made before all the drama when the nest was removed and put back, so none of that is in this film). Please note, though, this is EXACTLY the same film that's in the  ""Pale Male"" dvd that Amazon also sells, so if you were thinking of purchasing both, just get one of them or you'll waste your money. Only the covers are different (this one has the Nature theme music before it begins, the ""Pale Male"" dvd doesn't, that's the only difference).",1389744000,2,920,4.168539325842697
8020281,5,B000228E8G,This is a wonderful video and a heart warming story about the courage and tenacity of these beautiful birds as well as the love New Yorkers have expressed toward them. It's fascinating to observe how Pale Male and his mate care for their nestlings. I also found the idea of their courtship on Woody Allen's balcony both amusing and poetic.,1384732800,,339,4.666666666666667
8020282,4,B000228E8G,"A good story for kids and bird wathcers' of all ages.  Brings out the best in the people of New York as well.  No stories of greedy Wall Street investors or urban street crime (although I am a big fan of NYPD Blue and Law & Order!)  May even by scientifically significant for naturalists and zoologists because it shows how animals that normally live only in rural habitats can adapt and even thrive with a lot of offspring in urban areas.  This may be the future of all birds of prey.  Living in cities, not being  afraid of humans.  If you're a fan of PBS Nature and scientific shows like it you will like this.  The urban enviroment is a surprising new twist compared to other nature documentaries but it works.  It does not show the struggle to keep the nest after the building management tried to get rid of it so it's outdated in that sense.  Would have made a good children's feature film if it did.",1360540800,2,906,4.339285714285714
