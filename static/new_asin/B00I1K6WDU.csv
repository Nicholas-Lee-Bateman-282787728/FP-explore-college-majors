8638225,4,B00I1K6WDU,"RELEASED TO TV in early 2013 and directed by Zach Lipovsky, Tasmanian Devils chronicles events on the Australian island when a group of American base-jumpers inadvertently spawn several amped-up Tasmanian devils from folklore. The Americans team-up with three rangers to (try to) survive.

The low scores are inexplicable (with a 3.6/10 average on IMDb) in light of the fact that this is a competent monsters-in-the woods survival/horror/adventure flick. Sure, the diverse cast is no-name, except for Danica McKellar (best known, of course, for her role as Winnie Cooper on The Wonder Years), and the CGI creatures are decidedly cartoony, but Tasmanian Devils otherwise delivers the goods as a suspenseful, gory creatures-on-the-loose TV picture with breathtaking forest locations. Danica is super-cute, as usual, but shed be sexier if she gained at least 15 lbs.

Australians complain about the accents, but the Australians in the movie sounded Australian to these ears. Another nitpicker complained about the Gerry-rigged flame thrower. Seriously?

THE MOVIE RUNS 86 minutes and was shot in British Columbia. WRITER: Brook Durham. ADDITIONAL CAST: Kenneth Mitchell & Mike Dopud emerge as the most prominent base jumpers. Winter Olympian gold-medalist Apolo Ohno has a small role.

8638228,3,B00I1K6WDU,"It's not like I see Danica McKellar everyday on the bus stop scrounging for bus fare, but I feel that she's slumming on the Syfy Channel. She heads up the cast of TASMANIAN DEVILS, another in Syfy's line of B-horror turds. TASMANIAN DEVILS is not a good movie. But it does have some redeeming elements. The first is that McKellar is in it. The second is that it features two pretty awesome visual kills. The third is... there is no third.

When five base jumpers illegally parachute into a remote territory in Tasmania, onto the 3000' tall Devil's Peak, they awaken malevolent forces in the shapes of six supernatural predators, never mind that Australian folklore suggests that these creatures are actually the nation's mystical guardians against encroachers. These five hapless daredevils (that includes Winter Olympian Apolo Ohno) are soon joined in the wilds by three rangers from the Tasmania Parks & Forest Service, one of whom is a Yank named Alex (McKellar) who has a master thesis on aboriginal folklore.

There's really not much to the plot other than eight characters trying to survive these unstoppable atavistic hellhounds. These predators are attracted to sound, which sucks for the eight humans as they all indulge in stupid talk. The dialogue is strictly camp. It's the sort of movie where a guy informs a girl he'd just met: ""You're the strongest person I know, and I love that about you."" The CG is utter crap, and that sinks whatever ounce of verisimilitude that could've squeezed out of the feature creatures. Mystery Science Theater would've been drooling to get their hands on this one so as to poke fun at it.

2.5 out of 5 stars, and why am I so charitable? Because TASMANIAN DEVILS does offer a measure of enjoyment for the viewing audience. It's one of them awful movies so awful it becomes tremendously fun. I got the giggles because Apolo Ohno lived up to his last name. I love that cheesy scene where one of the guys was able to cobble up a flamethrower out of automobile parts. There are at least two awesomely gruesome kills - one victim's losing disagreement with a stalagmite and another's face getting graphically pincushioned to a tree. But, above all, there's grown-up Winnie Cooper scandalously flouting the park ranger dress code - oh, that tight, half-buttoned uniform - and putting the pain on them eldritch Tasmanian devils with that makeshift flamethrower. And never mind that Tasmanian devils are an endangered species.

By the way, if you're planning to get this Blu-Ray, be aware that this disc is classified as a ""Non-USA format, Region B Import from Germany.""",1414972800,,2606,4.8758465011286685
8638229,2,B00I1K6WDU,"A group of cliff divers take a helicopter to a remote Tasmanian mesa to jump 3000 feet before the park rangers find out. They are 100 miles away from anything in either direction. One jumper opens his chute a tad late while the jumpers are discovered by rangers  who show up in a matter of minutes from 80 miles away over bad road. The blood from the oops jumper  causes  the revival of ancient Tasmanian Devils who look like CG reptiles, recreating a Jurassic Park feel as our group is being hunted.

Danica Mckeller provides the eye candy and worst facial close-up as a flame throwing ranger working on her masters.

Tasmanian Devil special effects were nothing to write home about. The exaggerated mouth and fangs were more comical than horrifying.

Made for TV- kid safe except for that blood and eating human stuff.",1390608000,,820,4.659722222222222
