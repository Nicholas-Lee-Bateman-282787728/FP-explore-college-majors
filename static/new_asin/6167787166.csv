This is pretty fast paced and requires concentration, but oh, so funny!  I felt as if I was competing with Detective K to figure out the multiple mysteries occurring simultaneously.  I found myself surprised at how well timed the actors played off of each other.  Many surprises along the way.  Complex at times with unexpected events thrown in.  Couldn't stop laughing.  It did include some serious parts concerning persecution, fraud, blackmail and murder, but everything tied together by the end.  The ending opens the door for a 2nd adventure with 'the lady' character (wonderfully played by Han Ji Min) who seems to connect with Detective K.  SPOILER ---- Han Ji Min convincingly portrays multiple parts in this movie -- she really showed off her talent as an exceptional actress.  Loved it!",1465776000,,919,4.864516129032258
