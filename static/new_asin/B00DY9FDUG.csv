What I like about the DVD is its informative lessons. Doni warmheartedly explains why people celebrate the holidays. She says, Chanukah allows us to celebrate what we are grateful for in our lives and teaches us to never loose hope. During Chanukah, a game called ""dreidel"" is played with your friends. Doni tells you how to play it, step by step. I also love the how to cooking parts. This is when food lovers can get into the kitchen and learn how to make Jewish foods such as from latkes (fried potato pancakes) and matzo pizza. She tells exactly what you need and how much. The food looked so good I think I may make some. The music it is upbeat, catchy and it may be the only time you hear country music mixed with Jewish lyrics. What makes it even more fantastic is the musical accompaniment by Eric Lindberg. He's a wonderful guitar and banjo player. One little issue that I have is that all the lyrics for the beautiful songs like Dayenu, Bim Bam, and Lecha Dodi are all in the Jewish language. Subtitles in English would be a great improvement. I have no idea what they are singing about.

My favorite part is when Doni shows how to make challah - a braided bread you make on Shabbat. I  -love bread! The smell, the taste - I go nuts for it. I was so excited that I wrote down the ingredients and plan to make it. .

Mama Doni is a beautiful singer and has personality plus. You can tell she's really passionate about the Jewish holidays and loves sharing them with us.

The moral is ""try new things."" Whether you participate in the Jewish culture or not, you can still enjoy learning about a new way to celebrate with friends and family. You can make new foods or play new games as long as it's with the people you love.

I give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this to 5 to 12-year-olds. For this age group, this is a great introduction on how Jewish holidays are celebrated and why.

Consisting of three episodes (Chanukah, Passover and Shabbat), each of the shows (like specials) details the history of the holiday, provides incredible music ranging from traditional songs to brand new originals and also features a truly fun cooking segment for such dishes as latkes, Matzo Pizza, and Challah bread. The DVD comes WITH a bonus CD of the music (about a dozen tracks).

What's really fun is Mama Doni's exuberant excitement about Jewish tradition while bringing the presentation into modern living to invigorate participation (singing, dancing and so on) for kids. The music is incredible, blending traditional Jewish melodies with American Bluegrass. While this may sound ... unique... it surprisingly lends itself to and provides a level of fun and education I've not seen in any program for kids before. The gent on the instruments (Eric Lindberg) is wonderful, and while he plays guitar, dobro, mandolin, he is also a great co-star and provides a wonderful balance to Mama Doni. The lessons about the holidays are told with great understanding and ruach, and are told camera face-forward as if she is speaking to you and you alone! The kids in the series are also a blast... ""do you say Chanukah or do you say Hanukah?""... and when they all help prep for the sedar, it's like being in your own home trying to get things ready for company. Do you know what the first thing you have to do to prepare for the sedar is? Clean the House!!! :)

Traditional songs are re-worked in the new style and the original songs range from Honey, This Ain't Money (a tale of a girl trying to spend her gelt like cash... even to buy chocolate!!!), a roaring Let My People Go and a ballad called 8 which might be the best song / video in the assortment.

As for the cooking lessons, not only do you learn how to make the dishes, but the presentation provides how kids can help whether it's putting the Matzo-rella cheese on the Matzo pizza or it's braiding the dough for the Challah.

This DVD is so personalized that it's simply irresistible.

Highly recommended!",1381708800,2,2181,4.744063324538258
