664884,3,6303487645,"In the early 1970s musical films based on classic novels, and ""Presented by Reader's Digest,"" were made like every year: ""Tom Sawyer"" in 1973; ""Huckleberry Finn"" in 1974 and ""The Old Curiosity Shop"" in 1975. Probably the filmmakers still remembered ""Oliver!"" (1968) and ""Scrooge"" (1970) both based on Dickens.

As you know, the story concerns villainous Daniel Quilp, the owner of ""The Old Curiosity Shop"" and his angelic 12-year-old daughter Nell Trent, or Little Nell. The musical version of ""The Old Curiosity Shop"" stars Anthony Newley as Quilp, delightfully mean-spirited moneylender, quite Dickensian character you either love or hate. Anthony Newley also composed the songs for the film while Elmer Bernstein provides the score. Unfortunately, film's songs and choreography are just OK compared with the numbers in ""Oliver!"" but Newley's performance as evil Quilp with very thick eyebrows is very good. In fact he virtually takes over several sequences of the earlier part of the film (also known as ""Mr. Quilp""), comically singing and dancing before asking bewildered Nell to be his ""No. 2"" as the book's Quilp does.

Sarah-Jane Varley made a debut in this film as lovely (maybe too lovely) Little Nell who flees from Quilp with her grandfather. Michael Hordern, who is to play Scrooge on TV two years later, plays her grandfather. David Hemmings is good-natured Richard Swiveller and David Warner (the photographer in smash hit ""The Omen"") is Sampson Brass. Acting is unanimously good.

You will notice interesting changes done to the book: the book's ""Marchioness"" becomes ""Duchess"" and Quilp fails to know why Nell's grandfather lost money. But all in all most of the major episodes are left intact, including hilarious episode of Mrs. Jiniwin's interrupted tea party, but the orders of the incidents are often altered so the film can be without several minor characters. Largely these changes are improvement, but even with the changes the weak plot of the original book is still obvious and Nell's grandfather is an impossible character. So why does she has to devote herself to him? Or what does Quilp really want to do in the first place? I was not sure while reading the book and that didn't change after watching this film on video.

The film, shot on location and in studio in England, has reasonable sets and costumes, but not outstanding. Surely this is not the greatest film based on Dickens, but not the worst either.",1199750400,6,2439,5.059701492537314
664885,3,6303487645,"I totally agree with the previous reviewer that this is a great production of a wonderful Dickens's story.  I enjoyed everything about this presentation with one glaring exception and that was the acting of Peter Ustinov.  Down through the years I've seen Sir Peter in many films and to me each of his portrayals simply reeked of ACTING.  Never, have I seen him give, to me, a convincing portrayal of the character that he was supposed to be playing.  Likewise, this presentation of Dickens's ""The Old Curiosity Shop"".  In each scene I was made fully aware that Sir Peter was ACTING!  Not for one moment did I ever feel that he had become the character.  All that I could see in the film was Peter Ustinov going through his ACTING routine. The other acting, especially by Tom Courtenay as the nasty landlord, was great; however that, for me, was NOT enough because Sir Peter is in most of the scenes of the film which, I'm afraid, ruined it for me.

If you adore Peter's acting definitely buy this DVD",1187136000,16,1001,4.553072625698324
664886,5,6303487645,"This must be the DVD Bargain of the year. I brought this DVD as I enjoy watching Dickens.
I have not read the book or seen this movie before buying it. I brought it Purely for the price. What a surprise I was in for.
The story is about a girl named Nell and she lives with her Grandfather in a shop called ""The Old Curiosity Shop"". Nell's grandfather loves her very much, however he has a problem with gambling. He borrows money from his evil landlord (played by Tom Courtenay).
When the Landlord finds out what Grandfather has been doing with the money he takes all that belongs to the old Gentleman and makes plans to put him in the madhouse.
Nell desperately wants to protect her Grandfather so they set out to leave London for the Sea Side.
Will Nell and her Grandfather able to be free from the Landlord or will the evil Landlord find them and do what he set out to do.
Watch and find out. This DVD is a must for anyone who enjoys Dickens and/or family movies. A movie to be enjoyed by all ages.
With great actors, well made production of the greatest quality at a great price what more could you ask for.
You will not be disappointed.",1177286400,152,1140,4.258064516129032
664887,3,6303487645,"This once beloved story of Dickens has been filmed many times  since the days of silent films, and was even once made into a musical (as ""Mr. Quilp"").  But probably this Disney-Hallmark production gets the best review among others, and not without good reasons.  It has good atomosphere, beautiful shots (in Ireland), and decent production designs.  But if you are one of devoted Dickensians, you might be a little disapponted with, or even resent some part of it.
The double story of the original work was condensed, but still retains fairly much of the book.  Being threatened by villanious moneylender Daniel Quilp, Little Nell and her grandfather (Peter Usitinov) decide to leave their old curiosity shop in London, to live in country.  They soon meet many colorful Dickensian characters including Mrs. Jarley and her waxworks, and a kind school teacher who provide them with place to live.  But Quilp, who intends to throw the doddering grandfather into an asylum, is persistently chasing them, always at their heel.
The story is always interesting to anyone, and the film remains within an acceptable level of authenticity, even though London and the Themes River don't have enough touch to convince us.  The actors are good if you don't mind Ustinov's rather hammy performance, but the good acting of Tom Courtenay as Quilp makes up for it.  He knows Daniel Quilp, though a villain, is in fact a jolly fellow, with his pretty wife devoted to him.  The merit of reading the original is to experience the eventful life of one of the most successful characaters Dickens created, and the film shows satisfactory amount of this.
But if you know (and love) the original, you will be quite upset.  Ustinov is miscast -- the grandfather should be a lean, skinny man -- but that is not a big problem.  Every shot of the film is given too much lighting, chasing away the murky feeling of the night of London  -- the curio shop doesn't look like the dark one Dickens imagined -- but you can forget it.  The most deplorable thing done to the book is that they removed ""Marchioness"" an ill-treated housemaid living in a dump celler.  To be honest, this is too outrageous.  Any Dickensian will mourn for the loss of her, which makes the character Richard Swiveller quite feeble and pointless, because the relation between her and Richard Swiveller is, as everyone who read the book knows, the most moving part of the book.

This is not a bad production, but I am afraid that this one may not please every reader of Dickens.  Though this film is good, the British film made in 1935 is, I find, superior, conveying the spirit of Dickens and his world.",1031443200,28,2642,4.756578947368421
664888,3,6303487645,"For those of you who read my review on the book, you know that I also gave it 3 stars. Despite some alterations, this movie portrays the book fairly well. My only real complaint about this movie is that it deletes the abused servant girl that the eccentric, but benevolent Swiveller befriends, sends to school, and marries. I feel the absence of this character takes away a large portion of Swiveller's role. But aside from that, the movie is well done. I still feel, Peter Ustinov is at his best as the Belgian Detective in ""Evil Under the Sun,"" but he does a fine job as Nell's grandfather. Nell is absolutely adorable. Quilp is OVER THE TOP. Just as in the book, he initially has legitimate reasons for his anger, but then he reveals himself as a real embodiment of evil. But despite his evil (just like in the book) he carries real character and charm. At times he is even likable! Now and then, I even found myself cheering for him. Most of the other characters have limited roles, but they seem to make the most of them. The scenery is also quite beautiful. If you want to see why I only gave the book 3 stars, you may check my review on the book. If you liked the book, you will not want to miss this movie.",985737600,6,1214,4.3056768558951966

I appreciated the picturesque atmosphere and beauty of the film - it definitely captures the whimsical nature of the book. Also, all of the actors and actresses did a great job! Quilp in particular was super duper creepy.
 I was disappointed at the emission of some of the smaller plot lines featuring Kit and Dick.  In my opinion, there could have been a few less shots of Nell and Grandfather rambling contentedly about the countryside, and a few more of the entertaining instances with these two delightful characters.
 All in all, I think that the minor complaints I do have are with the way the story was adapted, not with the way the adaptation was carried out. Nicely made and all in all an enjoyable experience!",1324252800,,874,4.7368421052631575

665079,2,6303487645,"Most of Dickens' interpretations to film are well thought out and brought to life, but this is probably the weakest version of a Dickens novel I've seen on film. The most notable problem is that the essence of characters and their relationships to other characters is glossed over in a rather flimsy manner. In the novel, Quilp is such a dirtbag and villain, being abusive to his wife and taking pleasure in others misery that you take an active role in hating him. In this version, Quilp just seems to be a rather unpleasant, unlikable fellow, but his true villainy isn't explored. When we read the book, the differences between hateful Quilp and innocent Nell underscore the idea of evil vs. goodness in the world, something the film misses. Another issue is that the film is ineffective in filling in the gaps of the plot like most solid Dickens' films do. One example: one minute the grandfather is talking rationally to Nell, the next he is blubbering out of control like a baby. The attempts to characterize his problems with gambling and his want of success for Nell are done in a half-hearted manner, and so, as with much of the story, it has a real overdone, choppy effect that doesn't come across as genuine. The spirit of the story just doesn't ring forth here.

Another problem specifically with the DVD itself is that the sound quality and transfer are poor, with the dialogue often being muddled.

There have been successful  Dickens' movies from some of his rather lengthy novels, including recent ones such as Little Dorritt (2009), Our Mutual Friend (2005), and Bleak House (2009). Also, a few more of interest are Great Expectations (1999 Masterpiece Theatre version  or 1949 David Lean version ), David Copperfield (2006), and Oliver Twist (1949). Any of these are highly recommended.

I haven't watched any of the other versions of The Old Curiosity Shop, but I've heard that the 1979 version is much better. At any rate, very marginal Dickens film here.

The movie leaves out several characters, two of whom are extraordinary: a servant and a pony. The character Quilp is even more grotesque in the print or unabridged audio version than in the movie.

Give up an hour of t.v. each night for a month and listen to the Audible version. Hagan is amazing with the character voices. I found that I needed to listen intently to the audio to follow the story as my simple little self needed to concentrate to stay with the story, both with the Dickens' language and the character accents.

I especially like Tom Courtenay's over-the-top portrayal of the villain Quilp.  Peter Ustinov, Edward Fox (in a small role as Ustinov's brother), and the girl who plays Little Nell are also very good.  Many small roles are memorably acted.  If you like Dickens and period pieces, it's a very good show.

I then purchased this movie on DVD to keep it in my collection, and I was very disappointed.  The video quality is far inferior to that of the earlier VHS tape.

not know how it was done to make the streets of victorian London and vicinity look so life like and real, but it was done very
nicely. There are a few scenes of fighting, but otherwise this production is good for the entire family. We thought it was

665188,4,6303487645,"Firstly, this film (like any other OCS adaptation) does not fully and sufficiently develop the cast of characters. For some reason, no one seems to want a 500 minute adaptation of ""The Old Curiosity Shop"" where a lot of Dickens' original dialogue is kept.

Having qualified myself, this is my favorite adaptation of ""The Old Curiosity Shop"" by Charles Dickens.

To contrast this adaptation with those of the BBC:

1.
This film emphasizes Nelly and her grandfather, especially her grandfather's addiction to gambling. BBC emphasizes the villainous Mr. Quilp and his insatible desire for revenge.

2.
This film does contain at least as many of the minor characters as the BBC adaptations. While the minor characters are not developed very well (Kit's character for example), they developed almost as well as in the BBC.

3.
One of the worst things about this film is the piece-working together of scenes. In 2006 BBC, music in front of large houses signifies a shift in residence. In this Disney adaptation, you must watch carefully or become confused (especially if you have not read the novel.)

BOTTOM LINE:

I could not give the film 5 stars because of its compression of plot and underdevelopment of characters. However, I know of no other adaptation that is better than this one.

Also, I would warn you that the aspect ratio is 4:3, just in case you only enjoy widescreen productions.",1260921600,19,1389,4.905982905982906
665189,3,6303487645,"Made for the Disney Channel in 1995, this truncated adaptation of Dickens' beloved novel benefits from a strong performance by Peter Ustinov, and a near-brilliant one by Tom Courtenay, but suffers heavily from the role of Little Nell being played by Yorkshire actress Sally Walsh.  Walsh's Nell is hardly the tremulous, emotionally complicated, and ultimately unforgettable child of Dickens' imagination, and without that emotional center the film is only modestly gripping and Nell herself is just an inscrutable bundle of bland ""can-do"" perkiness.  The cinematography has the inevitable flatness of a made-for-TV movie: too much light, too little atmosphere.  There isn't a memorable image in the entire three-hour movie -- which is shocking for anything based on Dickens.  Still, it's a moderately enjoyable time-killer.  Just don't buy it with the expectation of experiencing anything like the BBC's recent Bleak House or Little Dorrit.",1256256000,10,940,5.545454545454546
665190,4,6303487645,"This 1994-version with Peter Ustinov as the grandfather is the best version. 3-hours, in color. The appeal of this film is the colorful and interesting bad-guys scheming against the grandfather and each other, and the perils of sweet, young, Nell. Up until 1869, a few years after the American Civil War, there really were debtors'-prisons in England. If you could not pay your debt; your creditor could have you dragged off to prison. This is a story about a vindictive creditor who wants to throw the grandfather in debtors' prison or worse, and the grandfather trying to elude him.

In this version, Mr. Quilp, the creditor, steals the show as the petty, vindictive, scheming, bad-guy, who enjoys doing evil. No one could play this bad guy better. A nice young woman twenty years younger than Mr. Quilp, who was poor and destitute, marries him to escape poverty, but brings her mother along to live with them.

There are several other colorful characters, such as Mr. Swiveller, the lazy bum gentleman suitor wanting to marry Nell. There is the crooked, obsequious, lawyer Mr. Brass and his icy sister who conspire with Mr. Quilp to harm the grandfather. There is the mysterious, dignified, wealthy, gentleman, making inquiries about the grandfather.

This film is intriguing from beginning to end. Some glimpses of beautiful scenery as they travel the countryside. Some sarcasm and humor from Mr. Quilp.

A good ending is critically important. I removed 1-star for a lackluster ending. The script-writer should have re-written Mr. Dickens' ending, which would have required re-writing the relationship between Nell and her grandfather, which I detail under the ""comment"" button below.

The characters of the other, 2007 abd 1979 versions are not as colorful. The 1979-version is a slower pace. They are watchable; not bad if you watch them before seeing this better version, 3-stars.",1254614400,4,1887,5.113636363636363

665192,5,6303487645,"This is one gorgeous production that takes the viewer back to the sights and sounds and ethos of Victorian England, even if the film was shot in Ireland, according to the end credits.  The details, even those in the background, are impeccable.

Moreover, it is faithful to the novel.  One reviewer for Amazon criticized the bittersweet ending, but the denouement was Charles Dickens' own.  I thought everyone knew the ending--as everyone knows how ""Gone With the Wind"" turns out--or ""Hamlet"" or just about any other standard work of fiction.  Knowing the ending surely does not ruin the movie or book for any knowledgable viewer or reader.

The acting is perfect and should have garnered every award for the year this was made.  The portrayals of the grandfather, Little Nell, Quilp, his lawyer, etc. are not to be forgotten.  Dickens' greatest talent, in my view, as his ability to create memorable characters, such as, Miss Havisham, Fagin, Uriah Heep, Barkis, Mr. Micawber--and lest I forget, Little Nell.

I cannot think of a single thing amiss with this production.  I could find some fault with Dickens' novel--too many coincidences, for example--but not with the film.  It is a treat to the eyes and ears.",1244505600,9,1212,4.9504950495049505
665193,4,6303487645,"I never thought I would enjoy this story as I did when I watched this version of the movie...  I had never read the book in its entirety, but I did know the story - having been brought up reading Dickens and Shakespeare at school.  I never thought I would enjoy Mr. Quilp, but I did, and I wish I could shake Tom Courtenay's hand - I thoroughly enjoyed Quilp - he was the best of all!!  I felt sorry for him in the end.  Kit was a delight.  The scenery was beautiful, the sets excellently put together..
I can't impose on people that the size of the book should not alarm them, as originally these were written in weekly sections.  I do think we should all read at least one of Charles Dickens' books (apart from A Christmas Carol) and get the feeling of Victorian England and its effect on children especially, as Mr. Dickens so keenly addresses and describes..",1239580800,32,862,4.3229813664596275

7848845,2,6303487645,"An owner of a curiosity shop loses it by gambling away money borrowed from an evil being Daniel Quilp. The Made for T.V. movie starts up after this fact at the time Quilp (knowing the owner is old and senile can be put into an asylum) is hunting the grandfather for the fun of torturing him and giving false hope of riches to his acquaintances.

You cannot properly distill a serial that was made into a book and now into a quick 135 minute movie (screen play by John Goldsmith.) So I cannot blame them completely for cutting out the purpose of the story but they did not have to make it all sugary and sweet. John Goldsmith

A few new things have been added or corrupted to be sure that it plays well on the screen. However in doing so have distracted again from the essence of the original story that has kept people spell bound through the years. The original was more of a serial and the Harry Potter of its time.

While Peter Ustinov made a good stab at the original grandfather, most of the others actors were a pail reflection of the originals in the book.

Well Jonathan Coy as Rev. Pratchett makes a good speech about ""Don't you see, there is nothing innocent or good that dies and is forgotten. We must hold to that faith or to none'"" It is close to the book where on that occasion the schoolmaster persuades her that ""There is nothing, no, nothing innocent or good, that dies, and is forgotten""; its ""blessed work"" persists.

I wonder what is missing from this presentation as there is a version 3 hr. 4 min (184 min) (2 parts). A little further investigation leads me to believe the DVD is really only the second half of the movie. And if you have not read the book you can be lost.

It lies.
