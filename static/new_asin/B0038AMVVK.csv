8391169,5,B0038AMVVK,"""Sandok"" and any of the other titles it is supposed to have been known by is perhaps best known as a forgotten Umberto Lenzi film, the director of ""Eaten Alive!"" and ""Cannibal Ferox,"" both of which received no mention in Halliwell's.  But ""Sandok"" is an intelligent, beautifully crafted adventure/heist film that, when it was made in 1965, would surely have rivaled nearly half of the American output that year, if it had been released with a comparable advertising campaign and the culture were as cinema-obsessed as they are now.  The film stars a veteran of Italian spectacles and spaghetti westerns and espionage films that all went unnoticed here and Richard Harrison has a quality that could have made it in the films not considered ""Z"" films that his fare is usually now credited as, plus he had the brawn to rival anyone working today in action films.  Perhaps that is why I've been looking for his work having seen the also excellent ""Master Stroke"" which also went unnoticed in any directory I consulted.  I do not have to resort to watching Tom Cruise or any of the action stars currently and can find truly good films that are not moronic to be entertained.  And whatever happened to Jean-Claude Van Damme?  ""Sandok"" is based on a classic novel, now considered a masterpiece, by Emilio Salgari and there are more famous renderings it seems, but this is truly exceptional.  I do not understand how such a good movie slipped by us and I congratulate Mya Filmworks for putting it out in a really beautiful edition to appreciate now and hope that it is not the end of our being able to recognize this quality film-making.  It is also presented in its original Italian, co-starring the beautiful Luciana Gilli and Wilbert Bradley with a beautiful score by the also-great Francesco De Masi (who scored ""Master Stroke"").",1333929600,,1825,4.8083067092651754

8391171,5,B0038AMVVK,"With the success of the Sword and Sandal and Spaghetti Western genres within the Italian cinema in the sixties , genres tended to mutate into Spy and Action films which actually blended a bit of everything.  Mya Communication has unearthed a jewel from that period which actually trancends the diamond highlighted through out the films running time.  'SANDOK' aka 'LA MONTAGNA DI LUCE'(THE MOUNTAIN OF LIGHT) is just that rare jewel.  Not only is it an action movie but it also resembles Jules Dassins 'TOPKAPI' which enters it into the heist caper movie genre.  Richard Harrison is at the top of his form as Allan Foster, a thief who pulled off a daring robbery of a major bank in New York.  On the lam, he winds up in the company of a Rajah in India who hires him to steal a rare diamond called the Mountain of Light from an impenetrable Pagoda.  Naturally, the double crosses and action sequences ensue.  Since this film was made in 1965, its fresh to see the genre glowing with such great set pieces that now since 'RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK' have become cliche.  Director Umberto Lenzi, way before his forays  into the cannibal/poliziotteschi genres, moves the film along in a brisk manor no thanks to the brilliant photography by Angelo Lotti.  Harrison is also aided by the stunning Luciana Gilli who provides more eye candy than the beautiful sets shown throughout and a great performance from Wilbert Bradley who aids Harrison in the theft but is left to die by tigers and returns to seek revenge .  If you are a fan of Indiana Jones and Allan Quartermain, definitely purchase this rare find.  Mya Communication deserves to be congratulated for unearthing this excellent bit of escapist entertainment as fresh now as when it was first released.  Its a beautiful, crisp widescreen transfer in Italian with English subtitles.  Enough said, hit the add to cart button. Now if only someone would release the Steve Reeves/Arthur Lubin Fantasy 'THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD'.",1282953600,4,1968,4.801186943620178
