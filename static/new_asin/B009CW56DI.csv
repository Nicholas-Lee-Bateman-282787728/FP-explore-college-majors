It is a very interesting video to watch because it addresses some of the questions we have had about the history of Black Mormons. Very informative and helpful.",1388793600,7,254,4.291666666666667
5315539,5,B009CW56DI,"My family is from Puerto Rico which has a mix of ancestry including descendants from Africa. Although I am a devout ""Mormon"" or member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, I was unclear/misinformed about the past ""policy"" regarding the ban for African men from receiving the priesthood. This documentary was very informative, it has strengthened my testimony. I recommend everyone to watch it, because it depicts a very important part of history and present, but it is not sugar coated.",1370995200,12,501,5.048192771084337
8539731,5,B009CW56DI,"The truth is the truth!  I'm glad Spencer Kimball was inspired to allow all worthy males to receive the priesthood.  Obviously, Joseph Smith permitted it when he was alive but something happened after his death that allowed racist concepts to persist until the 1978 ""revelation"". It was time!  Good movie!",1512000000,,305,5.06
8539732,4,B009CW56DI,"beautiful story - and I'm glad they took out the part where Darius grey quotes the prophet John Taylor, ""that black folks were here to represent Satan and to have a balance against white folks, who were here to represent Jesus Christ, the savior. How do you damn a people more than to say that their existence upon the earth is to represent Satan?""",1481846400,3,348,4.453125

8539736,5,B009CW56DI,"I purchased this direct from the producers a few years ago.  I praise the producer's unbiased storytelling for a controversial subject in Mormon history. My best friends are non-Mormon blacks.  In the past, I haven't been able to tell them anything substantial about this subject when they've asked.

I'm disappointed Mormon owned Deseret Book will not to sell this documentary, although the church has never discreted it.  You can only buy this DVD online. The Mormon church has candy coated its controversial history with Black people as long as I can remember.  Many thanks to the producers for this documentary.",1448755200,2,615,5.11

8539739,5,B009CW56DI,Film was Produced by my husband and mostly by the University of Utah. Not BYU. BYU wouldn't help with the production at the time they filmed it. Great film! But I'm bias. Film does not give Church bias. Tells the truth straight forward.,1417737600,4,236,4.511627906976744
8539740,3,B009CW56DI,"There is some history in here and I always enjoy history. However, the interpretations of that history are clearly presented in a pro-Mormon perspective. It is funded by BYU and distributed by Candlelight Media, an LDS film distributor.",1403308800,,236,5.2368421052631575
