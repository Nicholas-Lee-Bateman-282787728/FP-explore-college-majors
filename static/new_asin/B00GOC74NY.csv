8625515,5,B00GOC74NY,Ok honestly who doesn't love Married with Children? Well I bought it for a gift for my dad and i am extremely satisified. I grew up watching it as a kid and it was my Dad's favorite show. So it was great for him to get and be able to watch in the DVD player rather than wait for it to come on TV.,1449100800,,296,3.640625
8625516,5,B00GOC74NY,"This is a decent set and worth picking up if you don't own the original set, can find it cheap, and don't care about extras.

If you can find the original sony season one set at a good price, that is the way to go. Here's why....

1. Picture Quality - The original season one set had 2 discs as opposed to the one in this set. The compression in the original set is less and the picture quality is a little bit better than this one. This one seems a little bit grainier than the original set but what do you expect with some many episodes crammed on there.

2. Extras - This set has no extras. The original season one set had a 40 minute reunion special.

3. Content - The content in the new set and the old one is the same. The original first season set had no cuts and contained the original theme music. The cuts and theme music substitution started with Sony's season 3 set.

So in a nutshell, if you own the original first season dvd by Sony, there is no need to double dip. If you don't own this classic show, you need to buy it at once.",1397174400,,1043,4.043689320388349
8625517,4,B00GOC74NY,"No Embassy Communications logo.
Sony plastered the 2002 Sony Pictures Television logo onto the set
Come on the point of DVD is to preserve the original content not some politically correct version.",1391990400,,197,5.1875
