Most of the character development (what little there is) that goes on in this movie doesn't begin until 10 minutes till the end, when we finally get a little insight of what the character is feeling.  Consequently, the movie really saves what little it has to say about dreams and love until then-- the director apparently being about as speechless and self-centered as the  main character is.

In addition, the choice of soundtrack music often does not seem to reflect the mood of the scenes.  While Pietro is a ""musicologist,"" and much of the classical soundtrack is his choice of listening material, in the car, at home, etc., the tracks seem out of character with either the character's or the films moods.  While one might argue that it shows the conflict in the character's emotions, a simpler and more plausible explanation is a director who's musical palette is as thin as the main character's emotional one.

I'd pass this one up-- mostly a waste of time.  I had hope that it might instill some insights, perhaps new viewpoints about love, dreams and aging, but the movie in fact has very little to say...",1167523200,3,1403,4.629032258064516
7984973,3,B00008K797,"Mario Piccoli plays a musicologist who is irresistible to woman and chases la grande inconnue all over Paris. I loved the Paris of 30 years ago, the French country side and the vignettes, like Simone Simon as Madam. Piccoli plays a narcissistic man who makes all the woman in this movie look ridiculous and who solves his problems ultimately with sleeping tablets. There are dreams and flash backs which confuse this story of an obsession. You must love veteran actor Piccoli very much to enjoy this DVD.",1061337600,4,504,4.804597701149425
