8237510,2,B0010AEQ8Q,"The title ""Home Made"" states what to look forward to in this film.  It did take some folks off the street to reduce the unemployment stats for a couple of days.  It was a shame that the producers had to pay the staff the minimum wage but it did have the ability to con Amazon to buy the rights.

It is a great late night film to put one to sleep faster.",1508284800,,353,3.875

8237512,1,B0010AEQ8Q,"I have to say it was a complete waste of money. Nothing like the description given to sell it. Poor acting, poor story line and bad filming.",1413676800,,140,4.222222222222222
8237513,1,B0010AEQ8Q,Imagine a so-called movie that some guy decided to shoot on an old VHS camcorder with ketchup for blood and nothing but looooong stretches of people walking around doing nothing with an occasional POV shot of the 'killer' who is nothing but some dopey guy in a white T-shirt and jeans! This is literally the quintessential 'movie' that all horror fans dread renting (much less buying). An utterly worthless and incredibly boring shot on OLD VHS camcorder home movie! There isn't even anything to laugh at in this thing to give it some sort of enjoyable cheesy appeal. We're talking the SINGLE MOST BORING 'MOVIE' I'VE EVER SEEN!!! (and I've seen a LOT of bad horror movies),1272067200,,673,4.760683760683761
8237514,1,B0010AEQ8Q,"a person can't use this DVD as tolite paper cause that is all is good for. ANYBODY!!!!! I mean ANYBODY with a cam-corder and $100.00 can make a movie as good as this. The actors are most likely hang out buddies of the director. One woman would be a very good candidate for the TV show the biggest loser especially in the lower back side ( If you know what I mean?) The blood looked fake. The music was horrible. Also, hardly anyone drives a car in this movie. Everyone walks long distances to get where they are going while the horrible music is playing. One guy takes about 10 minutes of movie time to walk from his house to see his girlfriends house. Walking across large open fields, through woods, down narrow roads ect.... it goes on and on and on before he ever gtes to his girl friends house. Then when he gets there they have an argument about a minute after he arrives. The director is also the main star in the film. I don't know which is worse. His acting or his movie. The only good this DVD will give me is I hope I can trade it in at my local video store. It is TRASH!!!!!",1268697600,2,1086,4.151658767772512
8237515,1,B0010AEQ8Q,"It's frightning that people would actually spend money to purchase this piece of cinimatic trash.  I thought I had seen the bottom of the barrel with SLAUGHTERED, but this one is even worse.  Filmed by wanna-be amatuers, it looks like something a seventh-grader put together on a lonely week-end.  Thank god DVD players come with a FAST FORWARD feature. Even then, my eyes hurt from watching this dreck.  Total and complete TRASH.  Don't even waste your time looking at this movie on AMAZON.  Go on to something else.  I would rather be forced to watch BARNEY THE DINOSAUR while drinking acid tainted Kool-Aid rather than sit thru this cinamatic garbage dump.  I gave it one star because you can't give no stars or even negative stars.  Forget about this one.  You'll be be better off for having NOT seen it.",1266969600,2,808,4.707142857142857
8237516,1,B0010AEQ8Q,"If you put the empty pastic DVD case up for auction on EBAY, you'd get more for this piece of *&^% on the auction block!  A total BOMB!.  Horrible!  My German Shepherd could have done better.  This has to be the worst film ever made.  I fast forwarded to the end...and then put an end to it all by tossing it in the garbage.  My garbage was so upset, it launched a protest march.  So, I put it out with the backyard dog poop.  No one would ever know the difference.  AVOID.  AVOID.  AVOID.",1266364800,,489,4.095744680851064
8237517,1,B0010AEQ8Q,"This film is terrible , bad acting * high school level* , bad script , bad editing , i think this movie was ACTUALLY HOME MADE that's what the title is all about",1213920000,4,161,3.909090909090909
8237518,1,B0010AEQ8Q,"Yes indead this is the worst movie I have ever & I mean ever seen , this utter rubbish looks like it was made for about $4.99 plus tax ! , it is pure trash & looks like it was made by 10 year old kids at school .
The acting is appaling - the story was awful & I'm sorry Amazon but why are you selling this sort of total amature stuff ? .",1206835200,10,337,3.506666666666667
8237519,1,B0010AEQ8Q,"This movie was by far the worst movie I have seen in my entire life.  The write-up on this film does not describe what really happens in this movie.  The acting was not realistic, the ""story"" was convoluted and made no sense whatsoever, the violent scenes were a joke.  If it weren't so pathetic, I would have laughed.  My husband got so disgusted with this piece of trash that he left the room half way thru.  I stuck it out for another 20 minutes and quit watching it.  I paid $9.99 for this trash and it isn't worth $.99, so save your money and buy something worthwhile.",1202947200,17,573,4.308411214953271
