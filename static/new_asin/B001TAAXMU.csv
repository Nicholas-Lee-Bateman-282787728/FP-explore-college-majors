My family had bought me one of esteban's guitars (which also aren't that great since they're all the same with different paint jobs on them 2/5 also) with this DVD set.

There's no technique teaching and Esteban just gets annoying after a while.  The DVDs are now collecting dust on my counter",1249862400,2,490,4.351648351648351
