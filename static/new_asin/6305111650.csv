966294,5,6305111650,"Like many other movie fans, my only view of Lon Chaney was in The Phantom of the Opera. I enjoyed it a lot and decided to try some of his other work. The Penalty sounded the most interesting since Chaney's legendary makeup skills are used not on his face but on his legs. He is nothing short of amazing in his role as a double amputee/crime lord. Indeed, this is one of those movies that is carried by an actor's charisma.
Unfortunately, the supporting cast is not nearly as fascinating as Blizzard. With the exception of Rose, they are just the standard gangster film characters. (The eager young man, the innocent young girl, the dogged investigater) Whenever Blizzard is onscreen, the movie really works and the viewer misses him when he is not there. Chaney takes a completely horrid character and makes him almost likable. It's no wonder this was the movie that made Chaney a real star.
The plot involves Chaney's character, Blizzard, seeking revenge on the imcompetant doctor who amputated Blizzard's legs at the beginning of the movie. Meanwhile, the police are investigating Blizzard, hoping to bring down his entire gang.
The print is nice enough, quite watchable. The soundtrack is another matter. It consists of NIN sounding loops and drumbeats. Some silent movie fans are purists when it comes to music and some are not. I am in the middle. I would have preferred a more traditional soundtrack (the clangs and bangs are distracting sometimes) but it did not wholly hamper my enjoyment of the film. I just want to give a warning to any traditionalists.
The DVD boasts a suprising amount of extras for a silent film. A 1914 western short starring Chaney. I enjoyed seeing how little a western changed between the teens and the fifties! Also,and a brief but well-done tour of Chaney's makeup case. There is a book-to-movie comparison that explains why the ending was changed. (I think the movie would have been stronger if they had kept the original ending.) I won't spoil it of course but I didn't think it was in keeping with the mood of the rest of the movie.
All in all, check it out for Chaney. It is an entertaining film and a great piece of film history.",1028246400,18,2170,4.698162729658793
966295,5,6305111650,"Lon Chaney is perhaps the ultamate method actor.  Were Marlon Brandow gained weight to play a part Lon Chaney endured great pain to bring a role to the screen.  The comparison is a valid one.  However, similarities end as soon as they are made.  Brando begain about forty years later than Chaney.  Lon Chaney was creating new faces for himself, reconfiguring his body, and selflessly allowing the character and performance to eclipse his own personality in the ""Nineteen Teens"".  A method actor allows the charactor to be paramount.  The ""Leading Man"" type actor to which we have become so acustom to allows his own cutness, handsome apperance, or affible nature to obscure a part.  Lon Chaney was the First film actor to give more to the part than to himself.  A unparalled actor that could have only have existed in the silent era.",1005264000,3,833,4.769230769230769
966296,5,6305111650,"The Penalty is a superb Lon Chaney film. It has a really sinister, creepy atmosphere and a central performance from `The Man of a Thousand Faces' which is amongst his best. Chaney, in the role of Blizzard, does not use elaborate face makeup, although his face still takes on an incredible number of varied expressions. What makes his performance so memorable is that he is able to convincingly play the part of someone who has had both legs amputated above the knee. Chaney is totally believable as he moves around on crutches. He shows an incredible strength in using only his arms to climb ladders and ropes. Chaney's performance is not merely a physical tour-de-force. His portrayal of the bitter criminal mastermind does not descend into caricature. The viewer sympathises with him even as his violent actions make him repellent.
The story of The Penalty is lurid to say the least and at times rather far fetched. It is basically a story of Blizzard seeking revenge for the unnecessary amputation of his legs as a child. This revenge involves an elaborate plot to trap the doctor responsible for his plight. Alongside this revenge plot Blizzard plans to take over the city of San Francisco using `Reds' to fight the police while his gang robs the banks and jewellery stores. The story is far from plausible, but stories of criminal masterminds rarely are. It is however hugely enjoyable, exciting and also at times quite shockingly violent for a silent movie.
The print used for the Kino DVD is very good. It is nicely colour tinted and is clear and sharp. The score, composed by Michael Polher, is modern in style and takes a bit of getting used to. It has a thumping beat for large parts of the film, which can be a bit annoying, but on the whole the score fits in quite well with the mood of the film. This DVD has a lot of extras. The best of these is Chaney's one-reel 1914 Western, By the Sun's Rays, which shows the younger Chaney already playing the villain. There is also an interesting video tour showing Chaney's makeup case and the costume he wore in The Penalty. Other extras include a photo gallery a good essay on The Penalty. This is a fine DVD with one of Chaney's best films. Silent film fans will not be disappointed.",1004486400,13,2240,4.630653266331659
966297,4,6305111650,"Kino on Video has carved a niche for themselves with their fine digital transfers of art, foreign and classic silent films. Four of the towering icons of early cinema were Lon Chaney, John Barrymore, Douglas Fairbanks and Rudolph Valentino. Now, each of these stars has a seminal film freshly available for a new generation to discover and enjoy on DVD (along with a generous sampling of choice supplemental material).
A few years before his death, I got to know Allan Dwan, the legendary film pioneer and director of over 400 features films, who by then was well into his 90s. After a special screening of a his 1922 ""Robin Hood,"" a spectacular comic epic adventure starring Douglas Fairbanks, Dwan told me how he discovered Lon Chaney. ""I was at Universal and picked up a new prop man,"" he said. ""Suddenly, every day after work, I noticed a stranger leaving the set where we were shooting. A stranger with a missing leg, or eye, or odd nose, hair or teeth. It turned out to be Chaney in his home-made makeup effects. I said, 'You wanna be in front of the camera?' and began putting him in small parts where he was immediately noticed -- not so much for his makeup, but rather his personality. So I took the tip and featured him. He had that mysterious hidden thing that certain people have. He was a star from the very beginning.""
When I saw ""PENALTY"" I understood what Dwan meant about Chaney's sheer force of personalty. Shot in 1920, this Wallace Worsley (""Hunchback of Notre Dame"") directed thriller features Chaney as Blizzard, an embittered double amputee and criminal mastermind out to avenge the incompetent doctor who cut off his legs when he was a boy. Blizzard befriends the surgeon's artist daughter and serves as model for her sculpture of Satan. All the while biding his time to enact his demonic revenge. Chaney is electrifying. The disc is loaded with essays, photos, clips, shorts, trailers, a video tour of Chaney's makeup case and a look at the double amputee rig and costume. The atmospheric music score is by Michael Polher.  A DVD for the digital library.  Trust me.",999820800,21,2090,4.723287671232876

966366,4,6305111650,"Lon Chaney, an actor known for taking on the roles of characters that were tortured or grotesque and known for horror silent films such as ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""The Unknown"" and ""Laugh, Clown, Laugh"".

Known as ""The Master of Makeup"", Chaney has a long list of films in his oeuvre dating back to 1912, but it wasn't until 1919 in which Chaney would receive acclaim as The Frog in ""The Miracle Man"" (unfortunately, the full version of this film is lost, only a few minute footage which is included on the Blu-ray release) but it was in 1920 in which Chaney would star in the crime drama, ""The Penalty"" and solidify his status as one of the most popular actors in America and not a one-hit wonder.

The film would also captivate audiences as Chaney, playing a double leg amputee, using a leather harness to strap his two lower legs behind his thigh to two buckets.  While using crutches, he was able to take part in stunts without the use of his legs and feet.  So painful for Lon Chaney to play this role, he could only do this for short periods of time.

Based on a pulp novel by Gouverneur Morris (which you can read online here), the film directed by Wallace Worsley and written by Philip Lonergan would be one of the few silent films starring Lon Chaney that many silent film fans have had watched on  home video thanks to Kino (who released the original DVD back in 2001).

And in October 2012, Kino Lorber has released ""The Penalty"" on Blu-ray.  Remastered in HD from the 35 mm restoration by the George Eastman House Motion Picture Department.  The film is color tinted according to the surviving instructions and features a new musical score by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra in 2.0 stereo and DTS-HD Master Audio.

VIDEO:

""The Penalty"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and remastered in HD from the 35 mm restoration print from the George Eastman House Motion Picture Department and is color tinted according to the surviving instructions.  It's important for people to know that Kino is not a company that cleans up their films but presents the film in high definition as provided to them.  They choose films with the best print and so, you can expect prints to have some damage, tears and white specks and occasional hair or dirt that was made permanent during the restoration (at the time, many companies restored the nitrate print by converting it to 35 mm but with all defects included).

Fortunately for ""The Penalty"", the film is not in bad shape at all.  There are visible splicing, color tinting was a tad bit saturated at times and  there are white specks but for the most part, I was quite pleased of watching this film in HD and seeing more detail as opposed to the 2001 DVD which had DNR but also a bit of blurring.  But the contrast is good and I saw no major issues when it comes to artifacts or any significant errors.  I'm confident that this Blu-ray release will be the definitive version of ""The Penalty"" to see for quite some time.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Penalty"" features a new musical score by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra in 2.0 Stereo and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  I'm always a fan of Rodney Sauer and the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra's work and I enjoyed their score for this Blu-ray release of ""The Penalty"".

The music is fantastic and sounds amazing, crisp and clear via its lossless soundtrack. Rodney Sauer wrote on Nitrateville.com, ""Mont Alto's score for `The Penalty' -- after our previous score for `Les Vampires' -- has had us wallowing in melodrama for most of 2012. But we really like this kind of music, it gives us a great opportunity for emotional playing. This Blu-Ray is also our first recording with my newly acquired Kawai grand piano, though in most of these arrangements, the piano ends up pretty buried. When Lon plays his piano on-screen, you'll hear it a little more to the front. Grand pianos are very inspiring to play, but can be difficult to record.""

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Penalty"" come with the following special features:

  Chaney's Secrets Revealed - (9:33) Author Michael F. Blake gives a video tour of Chaney's actual make-up case and the costume he wore in ""The Penalty"".
  ""By the Sun's Rays"" - (11:27) A Lon Cheney one-reel western.
  The Miracle Man- (2:37) The only surviving footage of Lon Chaney's breakthrough 1919 feature ""The Miracle Man"".
  Lon Chaney Trailers - Featuring a trailer for ""The Big City"" and ""While the City Sleeps"".

EXTRAS:

""The Penalty"" comes with a slipcase.

JUDGMENT CALL:

As I tried to put myself in the shoes of those who must have watched this film in 1920, I can certainly see how this film would be chilling to viewers.  A dark and somewhat evil character, Lon Chaney's Blizzard shows viewers the cruelty of the underworld.

Viewers get to see how Blizzard is feared as he rules with an iron fist, he has show girls forcibly working under him and how his temper can easily flare to the point of hurting another woman with not so care in the world and the fact that he has this power, he gives this evil grin that surely is a predecessor of the evil grin that Jack Nicholson is known for in his chilling films such as ""The Shining"".

And while people die in this film, it also is quite interesting to see how police are featured in the film.  The criminals are always a step ahead of the police, so their best chance is Rose, an agent sent to infiltrate Blizzard's operations and manages to do it.

While some may see this as a positive role for a woman officer in an early silent film, unfortunately, while she is successful to infiltrate and do her own recon, she makes a key mistake which gives herself away.  To make things worse, she falls for Blizzard's charms and is torn between duty and love for him.  So, much that when he plays the organ, Rose kneels down to play the piano's pedals for him.

There are quite a few scenes that are implausible and personally, there are times that I wondered that if all these women do not like to be treated so badly, what stops dozens of them from getting revenge as he is a man with no feet and on crutches.  Suffice to say, this  is one of those films one shouldn't think hard of why these people do not do things this way or that way, just think of Blizzard as this evil power that men and women fear, despite his physical disability.

But what makes this film so entertaining is to see Lon Cheney giving an amazing performance.  A man who had to undergo tremendous pain just to walk on his knees and take part in many stunts, I was just amazed of how much he was able to accomplish.  But it's his performance that the film rides on his shoulders and he manages to succeed and making the film worth one's time to watch.  And the scene of Blizzard posing as satan is quite creepy.

As for the Blu-ray release, for silent film fans, to have a silent Lon Cheney film on Blu-ray is fantastic, considering his breakthrough film ""The Miracle Man"" is lost.  But it's great to see the surviving footage of the film included on this Blu-ray plus one of his earlier shorts from 1914, the western ""By the Sun's Rays"" included as well.  Especially a video tour of Chaneys' actual makeup case and his costume used on ""The Penalty"".

Picture quality on this Blu-ray release is much better in detail and contrast over its 2001 DVD counterpart and the new score in lossless audio by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra is well-done.

Overall, Cheney's performance in ""The Penalty"" is impressive even today, over 90-years-later, how one actor can perform a role with so much pain but yet give a commanding performance is a testament to how amazing an actor he was during that era.  And it's a gangster film that probably was dark and terrifying for its time.

""The Penalty"" is another welcomed addition to the George Eastman House titles on Blu-ray courtesy of Kino Lorber.  And to have a silent Lon Cheney film on Blu-ray is another win for silent film fans who have wanted to see more silent films featuring other notable talents in HD.  And one can hope that Kino Lorber continues bringing more films with other silent film stars on Blu-ray!

As for this Blu-ray, ""The Penalty"" is recommended!",1364601600,3,8204,4.566643882433356

966368,4,6305111650,"What a treasure! Awesome to get to see this film. Really interesting extras. (especially those bizarre expressionist original trailers) HOWEVER, I found the quasi-industrial-ambient score (the only option here, unlike some other Kino silent discs) to be, at best, ill-suited and mismatched, and, at worst, a jarring distraction. Did the composer watch the film with any interest? I argue that Lon Chaney's performance does not need klanging music and sobbing voices to communicate. His face and body language speak VOLUMES. Isn't that a significant aspect of silent film? Now, I'm not suggesting it should be honky-tonk piano accompaniment, but, this is as UNsubtle as it gets. I tried to maintain an open mind and I feel it does work in a few spots but it absolutely CRUSHES the first sequence in the hat-building sweat shop. And it distracts from the remarkably (especially for its time) fluid cuts from scene to scene. So, I recommend this with serious reservations. I couldn't truly lose myself in this example of a bygone era with a substandard example of a modern one grafted onto it.

966370,5,6305111650,"Lon Chaney was one of the very few multi-talented stars that Hollywood had in its early years. He truly was. Not only was he a great actor, but he was also a master make-up artist, the one that opened the doors to the next to come. If you don't believe me, then I urge you to watch ""Mr. Wu"" (1927), ""The Phantom of the Opera"" (1925), ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1923), and many others -- not in vain he was referred to as ""the Man of the Thousand Faces.""  He had a remarkable career that was sadly cut short due to cancer, presumably caused by his excessive smoking. His legacy is there, however, and, for our great luck, ""The Penalty,"" one of his brilliant silent classics, is now available in a glorious Blu-Ray edition, thanks to the folks at Kino Lorber.

The story takes place in San Francisco, then known as ""the richest city in the Western World.""  It begins with: ""A Victim of the city traffic. It was young Dr. Ferris' first serious case.""  We then realize that Dr. Ferris (Charles Clary) had just amputated both legs above the knee from young Blizzard. Unfortunately, Dr. Ferris is told by another doctor - his senior - that he made a mistake, that there was only a contusion at the base of the skull. Sadly, young Blizzrad hears this private conversation and he complains to his parents, but there is a cover-up in which the kid is blamed of being under the effects of medication, and he doesn't know what he is saying or thought he heard.

Twenty seven years later, Blizzard (Lon Chaney) is now ""the lord and master of the underground,"" despite the fact that he is missing both legs above the knee. He is able to walk and has a sharp, criminal mind. For this reason, Lichtenstein (Milton Ross), from the Federal Secret Service - who refers to Blizzard as the ""cripple from hell"" --, assigns agent Rose (Ethel Grey Terry) to infiltrate his organization. Lichtenstein claims that Blizzard ""gathered up his dance hall girls and he's put them to work in his house, making thousands of hats."" He wants to know why. At the same time, Blizzard, through one of his spies, was told that Barbara (Claire Adams), Dr. Ferris' daughter, who is now a sculptor, is looking for a model, so that she can create her masterpiece: a sculpture of Satan. Blizzard manipulates the conditions, so that he can be that model, in order that he can be close to and reach Dr. Ferris, and have his revenge, claiming that ""everything comes to him who waits."" But Blizzard - who calls himself the unhappiest beast in the world"" -- dreams big, pointing out that, ""For my mangled years, the city shall pay.""  With all these factors together, it seems that his patience will reward him big time.

If you are lucky to watch ""The Penalty,"" you will discover that Lon Chaney (Leonidas Frank Chaney, 1883-1930) was ahead of his times, so to speak. In recent years, the Academy Awards have been given to actors who defy the odds by imitating handicapped people, which translates into ""great acting."" Chaney would have had a field day with all these actors. Maybe one day he will receive a posthumous Academy Award for his work. The Blu-ray edition of ""The Penalty"" is awesome, and the image quality is crisp - a delight. I also enjoyed watching the footage from San Francisco during the twenties. The Blu-ray also features a video tour of Chaney's actual make-up case, housed in the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History; surviving footage of Chaney's ""The Miracle man;"" ""By the Sun's Rays,"" Chaney's 1914 western; and more.

966371,4,6305111650,"The Penalty (1920) revolves around the story of a young boy who, though a accident, has his legs mistakenly amputated by a doctor. The boy grows up to be Blizzard (Chaney), a tough, ruthless mobster and crime lord. With bitterness and hatred consuming his character, Blizzard plans to exact revenge on the Dr. Farris, the one who cut off his legs many years ago. Blizzard also plans to cause mayhem and destruction within an all out takeover of the city with his henchmen's assistance.

Lon Chaney really fit his title of the man of a thousand faces, taking on various roles and bringing so much life to his roles. He had that ability to transform himself into his character in a way that is unmatched. In The Penalty, he has that sinister, grotesque kind of role he seemed to be perfect for.  As the character, Blizzard, there is something about that wicked, cruel smile that says infinitely more than words could possibly capture, as if the wheels of his mind are spinning with plans of revenge.  Chaney's character is personified by his hatred toward his fate. At one point, Chaney's character shows up for an advertisement for a model who might ""resemble Satan.""

The movie's title, at first, appears to be a reference to Chaney's plan, but this is a bit misleading, as there is a twist at the end. Some have commented that they didn't like the ending, but I thought it was a great way to finish the film.

There are other great aspects to this film.  The Penalty uses heavy doses of expressionism to tell the story, and a music score that is eerie and bizarre. The restoration and quality of picture is superb; it is hard to believe that this film is over ninety years old. There are a few rare gems and extras worth checking out also, such as ""Chaney's Secrets Revealed"", a look the tricks and techniques used by Chaney.

966433,5,6305111650,"Though this film was made a few years before Lon Chaney became a huge star, when he was still known primarily as a very good character actor, it easily seems like his best surviving pre-stardom film.  In spite of his stardom still being a little bit away, he was given the lead role, and did such a wonderful job with it.  I think his performance as the villainous double amputee Blizzard (what a great character name!) ranks up there as being just as compelling and great as his performance in a film like 'The Phantom of the Opera,' 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame,' or 'Tell It to the Marines.'  (It's really amazing to think about the physical pain he put himself through to play a double amputee, in an era long before CGI, sacrificing so much for the sake of his craft.)  As in all of his films, though he's playing a horrible villain, the type of person you'd ordinarily be afraid of, avoid, or make fun of, he brings depth and sensitivity to the role.  Even though Blizzard is a very wicked man, he's not totally inhuman, and does display more human emotions a couple of times.  Underneath the exterior of the tough unbending criminal mastermind, there does exist the heart of someone who isn't completely evil.  He's also a lot more interesting than just about all of the other characters, because of this depth and complexity.  After all, when was Lon not great?

As a young boy, Blizzard's legs were unnecessarily amputated following a traffic accident, and when he was coming out of the operation, he overheard the doctor and his young assistant arguing about how this was an unnecessary operation.  Twenty-seven years later, he's an evil criminal overlord on San Francisco's Barbary Coast, obsessed not only with building his criminal empire and taking control of the entire city but also with finally getting revenge on the doctor who ruined his life.  He gets his chance when he sees an advertisement in the paper (under the terribly old-fashioned ""Male Help Wanted"" section of the help wanted ads) for a model to sit for a sculpture depicting Satan.  The young sculptor, Barbara, is none other than the doctor's daughter.  Blizzard's plans for revenge soon come to include Barbara's boyfriend Wilmot, who is rather old-school and wants Barbara to give up her career as an artist to marry him and have a family.  While Blizzard is plotting to seduce Barbara and get her father to cut off Wilmot's legs so they can be grafted onto him, all while still hatching an elaborate plot to take over the city, he's also falling for Rose, a woman who was originally hired to investigate his evil plans.  Because Blizzard isn't totally evil, Rose comes to develop feelings for him as well, and starts having second thoughts about ratting on him.  All of this makes for a great vintage macabre film, complete with a very creepy atmospheric soundtrack.  It starts off well and just gets even better and better, more and more intense and dramatic, as it goes along.  Unfortunately, there's an incredibly ridiculous and implausible plot twist at the end (which was foreshadowed in the beginning of the film), which probably seemed silly even by 1920 standards.  It leads to what I consider a disappointing ending, but everything that comes prior to the final reel is so wonderful that the lame ending doesn't cancel it out.

Bonus features are plentiful and include trailers, the surviving footage of the 1919 film 'The Miracle Man,' a photo gallery, information on the novel on which the film was based (and which helps to clear up some confusions and questions the viewer might have, like why those women are making all of those hats), the 1914 short 'By the Sun's Rays,' and an essay by Chaney biographer Michael Blake, who also provides a short video tour of Lon's makeup case and the costume he used in this film.",1208304000,,3815,4.742813918305598
966434,5,6305111650,"The unusual story for ""The Penalty"" was taken from a novel by a popular author of the early 20th century, but it is the star and legendary character actor, Lon Chaney, who really makes this film unforgettable.  Before his most famous roles as the Hunchback of Notre Dame and the Phantom of the Opera, Chaney's most impressive and highly-acclaimed performance was in this film, ""The Penalty"", in which he plays a double amputee and criminal mastermind with chilling conviction.  In fact, next to his portrayal of a Chinese man in ""Shadows"" in 1922, his role in ""The Penalty"" is probably one of his most striking and poignant, especially as he uses no make-up to disguise his face in this film.  This gives him a chance to express the warped-minded criminal character simply with facial expressions and other gestures, while stunning the audience with his realistic movements on stumps and crutches to portray the accident victim whose legs were amputated at the knees when he was a child.  Swearing hateful revenge for the doctor who needlessly amputated his legs, this frightening criminal character schemes his plots while a female agent goes undercover to find out how he operates.  Although somewhat dark and oppressive due to Chaney's overwhelming performance of the evil `Blizzard', there are still romance and intriguing plots in this interesting, though unlikely, story.  The sombre mood is emphasized by an unusual modern musical score which seems to add some eeriness to the atmosphere.  It is already eerie enough to see Chaney with cut-off legs, even when one knows that he is walking on his knees with his legs tightly strapped back behind him under loose pants and jacket.  There are no tricks or special angles used:  this is just another aspect of Chaney's amazing abilities of transformation which impressed audiences and fellow-actors so much in the 1920s that a humorous phrase was coined, namely ""Don't step on that spider - it might be Lon Chaney!""  Such was his physical skill to portray amputees, cripples and disfigurements, and ""The Penalty"" gives us a fascinating glimpse into this extraordinary art of a unique silent film legend.  To highlight this point, this DVD has some interesting bonus material which provides ample background information to the film, as well as excerpts from other rare old films in which Chaney appeared.  In itself an excellent example of a silent film, the picture quality of ""The Penalty"" is also very good throughout, and with the exceptional music and Chaney's outstanding performance, this DVD rates full marks and will surely leave a deep impression on every viewer.",1203465600,,2625,5.064965197215777
966435,5,6305111650,"Aside from the legendary comedians of the time, Lon Chaney was the KING of silent cinema and one of the few artists of this genre whose work holds up well today.

Here, our man plays Blizzard, a man who is mistakenly crippled in a bothced operation as a child by a crooked doctor who covers up his mistake. He grows up into a mad super-criminal bent on wreaking vengeance on the world whith his misfit followers. While there is not a light minute in the film, it doesn't overwhelm you. You are drawin in to the shocking power and brilliant storytelling of this psychological thriller.

Hardocre Chaney fans will relish the sequence from the long-lost THE MIRACLE MAN, where our man plays a fake cripple who pretends to be healed by a faith healer (Jimmy Cagney played an approximation of this scene in MAN OF A THOUSAND FACES). See it and enjoy.",1172880000,,845,4.552631578947368
966436,5,6305111650,"It is always an experience to watch Lon Snr`s work as he is, in my opinion, the greatest charactor actor of all time.  As the renowned Chaney historian, Michael F Blake, reiterates many times; Chaney was never a horror actor.  Neither the Hunchback (incidentally eagerly awaited in a new DVD presentation-hint hint KINO)nor Phantom are horror films.

The penalty is witness to the input, perfection and endurance that Chaney would bring to a role never giving into anything less than startling realism which seems even more fantastic by today`s standards.  His perfomances still make the viewer`s head nod in almost disbelief.

No one equaled Chaney in terms of his acting standards when he was alive and there has certainly never been anyone since.

The Penalty is a fast paced superb film which must be seen and not described.

The DVD is excellent value and as we have come to expect from KINO only the best surviving 35mm elements have been used.  There are great extra features one of which is the examination of Lon`s make up case by Michael F Blake.  I also found the soundtrack initially annoying but it does grow on you after a while.

If you have access to a DVD projector take the opportunity to project this on a huge screen it really brings the film to life again.

Overall this is a highly recommended motion picture with a fantastic presentation by KINO",1170115200,2,1368,4.729957805907173
966437,3,6305111650,"One is tempted to limit one's remarks to ""Wow!. I am a fan of Lon Chaney the Elder (the Younger wasn't bad either). He was a master of mime, of storytelling without words. He had one of the most expressive pairs of hands in history. He was, by the standards of the 21st century, a stylized, broad, melodramatic actor, but in the special, very rich, context of his time, he was one of the greatest. In ""The Penalty"" he pushes the envelope once again as a demonic master criminal who is so evil he is hired to pose for a sculptress as she models a portrait bust of Satan! The plot of ""The Penalty"" is downright operatic, full of wild action and heightened emotion. The denouement is questionable enough,I feel, to have raised some eyebrows even when the film was new, but the rest of the experience more than compensates for that fact. This DVD release is especially distinguished by its newly-composed musical score, one of the finest, and most unusual, I have ever heard for a silent film re-issue. Lon Chaney's films are a good way to discover what the separate art form of silent film could do!",1167782400,6,1096,4.5125628140703515
966438,5,6305111650,"Watching this film before reading up on it (which, as another [...] viewer has noted, is the most satisfying way to encounter a Lon Chaney picture), I assumed this film was made circa 1927 and was a little surprised by the vintage costumes.  For 1920, THE PENALTY is a superior achievement.

The plot is far superior to PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, and not only moves swiftly but also is filled with surprises right to the end.  And the ending indeed rings more true than that of its popular novel source material.

One explanation for the success of villainous Blizzard in San Francisco's crime district is that the ""best undercover agent in the police department"" is so inept.  And the hats subplot is rendered ludicrous by the fact that anyone could acquire a hat that had fallen off a crook.  Still, bumbling ""homeland security"" and the terrorism of a city bring unexpected currency to this story's more far-fetched elements.

Lon Chaney's Blizzard is a remarkable creation.  He visually exudes evil and menace, yet (an apparent thread through many of Lon Chaney's films) transcends society's contempt by revealing a sympathetic soul underneath.  His acting is credibly natural, despite his legs being strapped back at the knees, and it is his sheer physical grace (akin to Keaton's, Fairbank's, and Gilbert's) that contributes to his power and charm as a presence on the silent screen.",1155340800,2,1383,4.9523809523809526
966439,5,6305111650,"This film and this DVD reissue have already received vy competent reviews from prior critics, so I cannot add much. This is one of the best restorations I've seen, superbly mastered and artisically tinted. The music is extraordinary, very well coordinated with the action. I liked it a lot. It reminded me of ""Tubular Bells"" in Friedkin's ""The Exorcist."" Chaney is simply astounding in this film. He is known as the Man of a Thousand Faces and most people meet him in his heavily made-up roles as the Hunchback of Notre Dame and the Phantom of the Opera. Here he is himself, just his own face, his own acting skill against the camera lense, and he is astounding. This is one of the great, great silent films and I was reminded of Gloria Swanson's immortal line in ""Sunset Boulevard."" ""Back then we didn't need sound. We had FACES."" Chaney's gymnastics as a legless cripple are tremendous -- he climbs stairs on crutches and twice lifts himself by sheer arm-strength up a series of pegs driven in a wall, like a giant spider -- but in some way they are the least part of the film. It's his face, his acting, his sheer power that carries the film along. It's all expressions, all shoulders and arms and hands. It's an astounding performance. The only drawback is that he just blows everybody else away, every other actor in the film seems made out of cardboard, compared to Chaney. I agree with a prior reviewer: ""WHAT ABOUT THE HATS?"" That part of the film doesn't make much sense, though it does afford Chaney one of the most terrific and scary moments in his career, when he threatens a hatmaker, wobbling and towering above her like a huge monster on a table. The ending is silly, but one is left with the disturbing and unforgettable sense of having seen something truly demonic briefly released on film. An astounding and powerful film, a real tour-de-force, handsomely restored and presented with many fascinating extras. Even the subtitles are curiously horrific.

A minor note: Rex Beach, who seems to have collaborated on the screenplay, went on to promote Coral Gables as a real estate development south of Miami, along with William Jennings Bryan. Everybody ends up in Florida, sooner or later!",1109980800,4,2204,4.739583333333333
966440,5,6305111650,"the other comments are accurate. very good to excellent print. I found the music sympathetic to the film. But what about the hats? Fallen women in san francisco are making thousands and thousands of hats. there are very strict quality control standards (death for instance). And this is really the main essence of the subplot of the red takeover. The above reviews are right: great silent movie and an accurate barometer of why lon chaney is a star still.

7883025,4,6305111650,"I enjoyed this 1920 black and white70 minute silent film (the first talky was in 1927). Lon Chaney as the man with no feet acted very well. Surprisingly, I could not discover where his feet were hidden.
The film starts when a young physician treats a boy, his first patient, who was in involved in an accident. He had a contusion on his head which the young doctor did not treat, but he amputated the boys two legs. An older doctor arrives and says the young doctor made a mistake. He should not have amputated the boy's legs. He agrees not to tell this to the boy's parents, but the boy himself overhears what the doctor did wrong.
Twenty-seven years later, this boy is now the head of a crime ring. He is determined to get revenge against the doctor. He develops a plan for revenge as well as a plan for a huge robbery that will make him as rich as a king. The police know that the Chaney character is a criminal, but are unable to prove it. A woman is assigned to join Chaney and work undercover to find proof of his evil doings. This woman falls in love with Chaney.
What transpires next is exciting and revealing. It also raises the question whether Chaney should be punished for his criminal acts.",1501977600,,1203,4.351111111111111

7883031,5,6305111650,"The Penalty(released Aug/20) stars,among others,Lon Chaney,Charles Clary,Doris Pawn, and James Mason. While the film is well rooted in its 1920s time period and some of its dialogue/prose a little over the top,by our standards,the film is still powerful and it is mainly due to Chaney's great performance. The Penalty put Chaney on the map and deservedly so.
The story finds Chaney's younger self/character in bed. He has been in a terrible accident on the street and he has a contusion on the back of his head and a young inexperienced doctor has just amputated his legs just above the knee. A consulting doctor also on the scene tells the young doctor he operated in haste and should not have removed the boys legs. When the boys grieving parents arrive the doctors circle the wagons,to coin a phrase,to protect the mistake. However the young Chaney has overheard the doctors talking and tries through his grief to tell his parents the truth. The doctors assuage the parents by telling them he is just delusional because of the operation he has just undergone.
Fade out and fast forward. Chaney is now grown up and on his own in San Fransisco. His father kicked him out when he was 15 because of his deformity and now he has risen to become the kingpin of the SF underworld. However revenge has always been in his heart of hearts. When the daughter of the now older surgeon(who amputated his legs) puts an ad in the paper for a model to pose for a sculpture,Chaney leaps at the chance.
Alongside this story runs a parallel one and it has to do with the cops. They have put an undercover policewoman inside Chaney's close circle. They want to know exactly what Chaney is up to. While Chaney goes for poses at the artist's apartment,she snoops around. One day she discovers that the fireplace in Chaney's lodgings hides an entrance to an underground lair. Among the many things it has is  an arsenal of guns and an operating room. Any information she gets she relays to a cop outside the room window, who takes it back to the station. One day the cop who is returning the note gets killed by one of Chaney's henchmen, who notifies Chaney of what has happened and hands over the note,upon his return.
Chaney summons the policewoman to his parlour where he sits down to play the piano,with her assistance at the pedals below. He intends to kill her but can't because of the wonderful music both create together. The next day Chaney summons a friend of his who deals with illegal aliens. Chaney reveals that he plans to arm each and every one of his friend's immigrants and create a widespread ruse to lure all the military and cops to the outside of the city. While it is left unguarded,Chaney and his men will ransack and loot the inner city of its treasures. His friend calls him crazy and leaves.
Meanwhile the undercover police woman is outed by Chaney. But she has fallen hard for Chaney and actually is relieved the plan to take him down has been revealed. Chaney's plot to ingratiate himself with the daughter of the hated surgeon has worked almost flawlessly. That is until Chaney proclaims his love for her. She is taken aback and he has to beat a hasty retreat,psychologically. He leaves,cursing his luck. Back home he puts the start of his plan into action. He lures the doctors assistant( and boyfriend of the daughter) to his place under false pretenses. Once there he won't let the man go,for he wants his legs. He then calls daughter's father and does the same to him. By now the doctor knows who Chaney is and Chaney insist the doctor operate. He wants the assistant's legs grafted onto his. After a string of objections, the doctor eventually relents to the surgery. We know the doctor has a plan up his sleeve,and it is soon revealed. We see a groggy Chaney waking up after the operation,but his legs remain the same. Remember that contusion? The doctor has operated on that and corrected any damage it has done. This has been what has caused Chaney's personality change over the years and what drew him into his life of darkness. Chaney is now a new man as the undercover cop sits by his bed. Chaney and the doctor vow to help each other into a bright new future.
Chaney's old cronies and underlings however are having a hard time with the new man they used to call their boss. They gather together and vow to take him down. As Chaney and his new bride(the cop) sit together at the piano two shots ring out, and Chaney is fatally struck by both. He dies in his loved one's arms,never to get a chance at redemption.
The film is chock full of pre-code scenes like nudity,drug use and prostitution. It is at times a raw look at the underworld crime scene and it isn't pretty. The title cards at times are a little too flourid for modern tastes at times,but Chaney's performance is what really makes this film. There are no camera tricks and any kind of S/FX were extremely limited in those days anyways. No,Chaney plays it straight as he walks,climbs and claws his way along the floor and up wall sides. It is an utterly astonishing, but at the same time, marvellous thing to watch. His obvious character/make up aside,Chaney was one heck of an actor,which comes through brilliantly here. This would be Chaney's breakthrough performance and it is a doozy.
Technically speaking the film is in full screen mode and is clear and crisp. Also along for the ride,KINO has added a host of extras. It has Chaney's July/14 one reeler The Sun's Rays,the only surviving footage of The Miracle Man,a small featurette by Chaney author Michael Blake on his make up kit and costumes,a small essay on the film,photo gallery and much more.
All in all a must have for all Chaney/silent film fans. While very much a /20s film it is also intelligently done and well acted. Chaney is the star and in his breakout role he steals every scene,and is mesmerizing as Blizzard the underworld king pin,with stumps for legs.",1426896000,,5909,4.616920152091255
7883032,5,6305111650,"A car accident leaves a small boy in the care of a doctor who decides to amputate both of the boy's legs. The boy also has a contusion at the base of his skull--a plot point that will become very important towards the end of the movie.

Much to the doctor's shock and dismay, one of his colleagues reveals that amputation wasn't necessary and the boy overhears how the doctor butchered him. Years later, the boy would grow up to become Blizzard, the King of the San Francisco underworld.

Blizzard has plans--not only to rob the city blind, but to exact revenge on the doctor who robbed him of his legs.

This was without doubt, the best Lon Chaney Sr. movie I have seen. No elaborate facial makeups, just the acting skills of a master silent screen star--and the no doubt arduous pains Chaney must have gone through to affect the double amputee look.

Also, this might be one of the very few Chaney Sr. films I've seen where he gets a girl. Not the one he had his eyes on throughout the film, but a girl nonetheless and after an operation, it appears Chaney may get a very happy ending--that is until he must pay the Penalty.

And, this is the best restoration I have seen of all of Chaney's surviving silents. There's still one or two I have not purchased yet, but there was not a whole lot in the way of grain or dirt, static, whatever else may effect old movies such as these.

Overall, if you're a fan of Lon Chaney, then ""The Penalty"" is required viewing.
