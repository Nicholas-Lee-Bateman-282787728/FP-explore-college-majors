8008534,5,B00019G4QY,My little boy loves this. I was so glad I could find a copy. Great patriotic songs. We watch it over and over again as a family.,1398902400,,128,3.7777777777777777
8008535,4,B00019G4QY,"My daughter reads this book over and over, so I bought her the DVD.  She enjoys hearing the states' voices and the little side comments that are added.  It's nicely animated while sticking closely to the book.",1223769600,,209,4.621621621621622
8008536,2,B00019G4QY,"I was disappointed with this DVD.  I was hoping for a fun way to learn about the states, but this DVD is not it.  The other stories that accompany it are set to music that is difficult to listen to.  The two stars I did give it were for the Star Spangled Documentary, Johnny Appleseed story, and John Henry.  I expected more from a Scholastic product.",1191888000,,351,4.2727272727272725
8008537,3,B00019G4QY,"Frankly, I was disappointed with the video. It seemed rather dull to me, in comparison to reading the book itself, which I thought unique, entertaining, and hilarious. Then, I am a rather animated reader to my students with voices, etc. It is a complicated read, so if your not up to it, buy the companion tape to follow along. Laurie Keller is one of my favorite authors.",1133654400,5,372,4.567164179104478
8008538,5,B00019G4QY,"This tape is mesmerizing for kids and adults alike.  I thought the art and music in America the Beautiful was incredible, and the musical biography of Woody Guthrie was powerful and touching.  This tape is more educational than entertaining for kids, but it's enough of the latter to keep them interested.  The Scrambled States are clever and subtle.",1130025600,9,350,5.0
8008539,5,B00019G4QY,"We have 4 children (from 4-8).  This DVD allows for optional read/sing along, which if used, enhances each of the individual presentations immensely.  All of my kids enjoy the DVD, but it's particularly great for patriotic learning occasions (as mentioned by another reviewer).  The full length Aretha version of the Star Spangled Banner is alone worth the price!  Remember that the read/sing-a-long version must be chosen from ""extras"" on the dvd menu since it is not the default mode.",1105488000,17,486,5.113924050632911
8008540,5,B00019G4QY,"It always amazes me how people see things differently (see other review.)  I agree that this is not one of the more lighthearted & ""catchy"" Scholastic videos of the lot, but it has SO much to offer.  This is an especially good choice for an older child.  The cover story ""Scrambled States of America"" is hilarious and has many hidden humors within it that grown-ups will even appreciate.  The other stories that the other reviewer referred to are anything but boring.  Rarely do I want to sit & watch what my kids are watching, but I find that I can't resist this one.  I couldn't believe my ears the other day, when I heard my 4 year old son singing the words to ""This Land is Your Land.""  And I could NEVER consider Peter Spier's drawings to be boring!!!  As a child I used to sit & stare at his books for hours on end.  The animation to the ""Star Spanled Banner"" and all the verses that we usually never get to hear are absolutely BEAUTIFUL (sung by Aretha Franklin)!!!  I get goose bumps & cry every time I watch it.  This DVD is very educational.  Bonus stories include John Henry and Johnny Appleseed.  I have to admit, we don't watch this DVD as much as the others, but I love to pull it out on July 4th, Veteran's Day, election day, etc. I never feel guilty letting my kids watch the Scholastic Video Collection!",1094601600,25,1320,4.338775510204082
8008541,1,B00019G4QY,"The first illustrated story about the scrambled states keeps your interest, but the two other illustrations are totally musical, the songs are too long, and get boring.  Doesn't hold your interest.  Not one of Scholastics' better videos.",1088121600,6,237,5.378378378378378
