8340729,5,B001T7HMDG,"We loved this DVD. The photography was fantastic. We have visited the sites featured in the video and were fascinated to learn so much more about the history of the locales. Ron did an awesome job and I highly recommend this DVD for anyone interesting in the Lincoln Memorial and the Tomb of the Unknowns. In addition, anyone who loves Colorado will appreciate the journey they are taken on high in the Colorado Rockies. Thanks Ron for producing this video....it's a must have!",1378857600,,477,4.759036144578313
