8645909,3,B00443FMKW,"Great documentary but it seems to be biased that the husband that was accused may be innocent. I don't care what the experts say that dispute the original findings, this man is and was guilty. He had 3 babies burning in the fire but he comes out wth no injuries to equal the fire and his ""so called"" attempt to save his 3 babies.  Any REAL man I know would have died in the fire to save their babies, yet this coward comes out with nothing more than singed hair. Justice was served. He was put to death. Those babies that he allowed to burn are his judge.",1441584000,,555,4.138888888888889
