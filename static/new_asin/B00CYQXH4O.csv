I keep hoping that another network will revive the show, but since it supposedly didn't appeal to young airheads it probably won't be. :-(",1382832000,10,249,4.555555555555555

5754303,5,B00CYQXH4O,Fantastic show. Wish it was still on. The DVD arrived earlier than scheduled. I would recommend buying this product.  Looking forward to watching Vegas over and over.,1382227200,9,166,5.148148148148148
5754304,5,B00CYQXH4O,This show was awesome because it had a great storyline and it had a terrific cast. Dennis Quaid and Michael Chiklis were both fantastic in their roles. It was a shame that this show was cancelled because I really enjoyed it .,1381795200,2,225,4.380952380952381
5754305,5,B00CYQXH4O,"I feel this series is the best television can offer along the lines of the Sopranos etc. The writing, actors are all top notch Hollywood Feature Film class, as is the look and feel of the show. Anyone interested in Vintage Vegas, the Mob etc. is in for a real treat here!",1381708800,2,271,4.230769230769231
5754306,5,B00CYQXH4O,"I worked for Sheriff Lamb. He was the best thing to ever happen to Las Vegas. Then in 78 the idiots voted him out of office, because off some BS trumped up tax charges that just happened to come about during election time. He beat the charges in court, but it was to late. The election was over and Las Vegas got the biggest jackass of a sheriff. And that is when tony the ant spillotro and the hole in the wall gang went to work burglarizing the city. And a whole lot of other crime.
Dennis Quaid plays Sheriff Lamb perfectly. He had Ralphs poker face and quirky smile. That you saw just before the s*** was about to hit the fan. He even looks like him in the saddle. And even kind of the same roping style. It was eerie how he moved and acted just like the real Sheriff.
This show had the most unbelievable cast. The writers were fantastic. Ever episode kept you in suspense. I can't believe this show isn't coming back for another season. Somebody sure messed up.",1381190400,42,966,4.255434782608695
5754307,5,B00CYQXH4O,"Excellent well done modern western drama set in 1960's Las Vegas was one of the best series ever produced for older viewers in the past 10 years. Loved it, brought back great memories and my most enjoyed show since the late 1990s when the Magnificent Seven series was on. But like the Magnificent Seven, Vegas didn't appeal to the younger viewers, who want nothing but horror & sex on TV and the Hollywood Networks don't give a damn about older viewers even though they watch more TV and have a lot more money to spend. I am giving up on watching network TV shows, they are crap and the networks are nothing but stupid bastards who don't know there ass from a hole in the ground.",1380240000,3,679,4.396825396825397
5754308,2,B00CYQXH4O,"One of our fellow reviewers wrote ""I mean c'mon- Michael Chiklis ..."", Yeah, that's what I thought, too. Fact is: the scripts of the show are simply lame without any suspense. Nothing you haven't seen in other TV shows. What I really didn't like, however, was the set of Las Vegas in the late 1950s/early 1960s. Everything looks so unreal. If you've seen later CSI:Miami shows, you'll know what I mean - articficial colors, artificial everything. Compare ""Vegas"" to ""Boardwalk Empire"" and you'll see the difference, very very much in favour of the Boardwalk. Producers and directors didn't work well.

I feel sorry for Michael Chiklis that he didn't get anything better after the great and well deserved success of ""The Shield"". One good thing, though, I got to dig into my DVD collection and started to watch ""The Shield"" all over again.",1378512000,4,838,4.86013986013986

Really, really bummed it was cancelled, thought this was one of the better shows on non-cable TV. I mean people want a million seasons of the worst crap on TV but they cancel this. So disappointed! At least they ended it in such a way you can look at it like a mini-series, since they concluded the season very well without any cliffhangers. Wanted to buy the season on Blu Ray though & don't see it. Would not pay this price for reg DVDs, hoping Blu Ray shows up soon, otherwise the price would have to drop a lot for me to get this.",1378339200,20,746,4.26056338028169

They need to get real about over pricing this item..This is the standard 6-disc package just like CSI and others that paramount produces and so you know what you are getting..(*****) stars for the show(*) One star for the price!!",1372118400,18,644,4.591304347826087

5754387,5,B00CYQXH4O,"I watched this show when it came out and I loved it. I love the setting which is Las Vegas before it beame the city that we all know it as. Great concept. And the characters, I loved just about all of them. Yes, there were some of those standard Mafia characters that you have to have because of what was going on in Vegas in 1960, but they all meshed and to me were perfectly played.

Dennis Quaid played Sheriff Lamb perfectly and I love the relationship that he had with his brother, Jack, his son, Dixon and even Katherine. The cast of Dennis Quaid, Michael Chiklis, Jason O'Mara, Taylor Handley, Sarah Jones, Carrie-Anne Moss are all incredibly talented.

This was a great show that should have seen more time on television. Such a shame that it only saw one season. I would have loved to have a proper conclusion to the characters.",1445472000,5,837,4.428571428571429

It is over the top good.  Great acting, believable and interesting scripts, phenomenal dialogue that is pleasantly refreshing for the absence of any 'F'-bomb or similar vulgarity that are the crutch of modern writing, comedy and acting.  The actors, set and writing carry this show along at a steady, no room for boredom pace; but which leave you satisfied at the end and not strung out.  I don't have cable or satellite TV so I had to buy the series on DVD. So sad to watch this show - thoroughly enjoy it - and learn there will be no further seasons.

Yes, I understand the pressure network stations are under from the cable giants, but to waste a great premise is a tragedy. Not very authentic-visually.  When I think of Vegas, I think of sexy showgirls, prostitutes, filthy language, a sense of realism of the times. Network tv destroyed this sense. Made it a PG flop.

Others have said the hats are wrong, the cars are not all accurate. I felt a bit, well, underwhelmed-almost bored. No sense of suspense or intrigue.

5754586,5,B00CYQXH4O,"Vegas - Entire Series

Summary:

It's 1959-60 and a Chicago crime organization sends one of its representatives to Las Vegas to ""manage"" a casino. Vincent Savino - Michael Chiklis has big plans for the Savoy Casino and is give a relatively free hand as long as he keep the ""skim"" flowing back to the bosses in Chicago. Opposing Savino and his underworld methods and unsavory friends is Sheriff Ralph Lamb - Dennis Quaid. For the record I watched the entire series over a period of a month. This was my first viewing of ""Vegas"".

Content:

Five disks - 21 episodes - origional broadcasts 9/22/2012 to 05/10/13

Positive Comments:

This is one of the few TV series I looked forward to viewed each show. In addition to the main episodes narrative each character had an interesting back-story or relationship that was integrated with the weeks plot.

The character of Ralph Lamb played by Dennis Quaid was based upon an actual person. In the ""extras"" on the series DVD's the real Sheriff Lamb visits the set and comments on some of his experiences during the early 1960's.

The DVD is full of very interesting deleted or extended scenes and interviews. These were worth watching and not just fillers or vanity videos.

The Cast:

Actors Dennis Quaid and Michael Chiklis as lawman and casino manager/gangster respectively are outstanding in these roles.

In fact I could not fault any of the supporting cast. There were a couple of ""bad-ass"" gangster types that could give you nightmares!

Negative Comments:

 Sheriff Lamb's son, a deputy, has a romance with an attractive Mexican American woman who is the sheriff's office manager. This story line seems very contrived and was inserted to attract, apparently, a certain demographic. To this viewer it detracted from the overall story.

Recommendations:

This is an excellent series on several levels. It has a wonderfully talented cast of actors that seem to ""fit"" their roles with perfection. The sets have a real nice 1960's look of what, presumably, Vegas was like during that period. Almost every episode was well written and paced to a satisfying conclusion.

It is a mystery to me was this series was not renewed for another season.",1388188800,,2185,4.91008174386921

8587649,5,B00CYQXH4O,"Another really great short- lived series that was taken off the air too soon. Why? According to the network the series skewed to an older audience. So what! Some of us are NOT between the ages of 18-34, & we appreciate more mature shows!",1522108800,3,237,4.409090909090909
8587650,5,B00CYQXH4O,This is an interesting look at Vegas in the early days.  It's obviously fiction - but I have to believe there is a little historical background built in.  The actors do a great job and the sets are amazing.  I only wish it would have gone on another season or 2 or 3.,1517788800,,267,4.0
