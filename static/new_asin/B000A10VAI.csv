8071832,4,B000A10VAI,"The wonderful Rosa Maria Sard plays the title role in this charming, wistful, often whimsical comedy/drama directed by Ventura Pons.

Anita, a fifty-year-old film buff who has led a predictable and unadventurous life as a box-office clerk, takes a chance on love when she's pursued by a hunky construction worker. It's not your typical romantic comedy, but it's a lovely film.

Set in Barcelona, the film was shot in a mix of Spanish and Catalan (mostly Catalan), though it's often shown in Spanish-dubbed versions. The European Spanish dub (available on this DVD) is much more carefully done than the American Spanish dub shown recently on Univisin television.

This disc also includes the original Catalan/Spanish multilingual version, which I recommend (and which you can watch with the Spanish or English subtitles turned on if you need them). It gives a good feel for the reality of conversations in that part of Spain.

""Anita"" is my favorite Ventura Pons film (as the director usually goes in for much more depressing scripts). Apparently it's the only one of his films that's unavailable in the U.S.",1219449600,,1107,5.065934065934066
