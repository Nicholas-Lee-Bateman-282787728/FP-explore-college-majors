8253854,4,B0014127NC,"My dad, Ed Bechtel, was in the FSSF. For me, having met many of the force members at reunions, this dvd is special! Absolutely don't care about the pauses, thoroughly enjoyed the archival footage, and the personal recollections of these courageous men!",1485129600,,252,5.023809523809524
8253855,4,B0014127NC,"My wife's dad was a member of the FSSF. We have visited Fort William Henry Harrison in Helena, MT. I agree that the ""delays"" are bothersome, but nothing that a little patience cannot compensate for. We are really enjoying the comparisons between the past and prersent.",1483228800,,268,4.8478260869565215
8253856,4,B0014127NC,"I recently ordered my copy of the DVD at Amazon. I wasn't as frustrated by the technical issues as apparently some of the other reviewers were.  The screen would go black for about 15 seconds between major scene breaks but otherwise it played satisfactorily in my DVD player.  I live in Helena, Montana, where the First Special Service Force (FSSF) was formed and trained from 1942 to 1943.  I learned some interesting history about the unit, including local sites where they trained, that I haven't seen anywhere else and I have several books about the unit.  The program offers rare archival film footage that you won't likely see anywhere else.  As a history buff, I too was puzzled when the director/producer reversed the time sequence of the Battle for Monte il Difensa and the unit's front line service at Anzio.  That was disconcerting and unnecessary.  However, given the gross inaccuracies and fabrications in the Hollywood version of the FSSF's story, this was a far more accurate and honest telling of their story.  Comparing the experience of modern soldiers going through similar training using the older equipment and combat gear added to your appreciation for the accomplishments of the FSSF.  The interviews with and perspectives of the actual World War II veterans of the Force were sometimes very touching and powerful as they talked about their experiences and the close friends and respected leaders they lost in combat.  I thought the four part series was well done over all and well worth the money.",1332028800,3,1521,4.976284584980237
8253857,4,B0014127NC,"The Devil's Brigade is an interesting mix of reality TV and documentary. A group of Canadian and American soldiers follow in the path of the First Special Service Force in a mock attack on Monte la Difensa, interspersed with documentary footage.

I enjoyed the episodes, particularly when the modern soldiers took part in authentic Force training. Their take on World War II gear, and how heavy and uncomfortable it was, was astute. It put the exploits of the FSSF in perspective.

There were a few small flaws in the program. The most glaring was the documentary's attempt to make the Force's original mission to Norway ""edgier"" than it was. The documentary suggests that the Force was going to destroy a Norwegian power plant involved in the production of heavy water, and thus directly affect Germany's nuclear program. In fact, the Force's original mission (which was never carried out) was to destroy a series of Norwegian hydroelectric plants, the main purpose of which was to supply electricity to metal refineries. The heavy water work might have been a side effect, but it wasn't the purpose of Operation Snow Plough, nor was it mentioned in the operation's briefings.

I didn't like how the documentary jumped around with the Force's timeline. They talked about the Anzio operation before getting into the detail on Monte la Difensa. This is because the climax is the mock attack on Difensa, and I'm sure the director thought that keeping the Difensa portion of the documentary near the climax made more sense. Possibly, but it also distorts the order the Force's operations occurred and could cause confusion.

The mock assault is interesting, but unfortunately the number of men taking part in the assault is so tiny compared to the real attack (about a dozen men versus the 300 in the original attack) that it looks too much like a re-enactment. However, taken as an example of what the men went through (particularly given what happens to the modern-day soldiers in their attempt on Difensa), it is very instructive. The program's footage from the top of Difensa is invaluable. A Google image search uncovers very few pictures from the top of Monte la Difensa. This program gives the best view of this important FSSF battleground that I was able to find. This is the first time I'd seen some of the archival footage.

All told, it is well worth downloading.",1277510400,3,2371,4.902743142144638
8253858,4,B0014127NC,"I caught the series on TV and thought it was very interesting. I liked the mix of both former Devil's Brigade members and those who were going through the ""recreated"" training. It gave two different perspectives from two different generations. Overall I thought it was a very good show.",1268784000,,286,4.857142857142857
8253859,1,B0014127NC,"Like the previous reviewer, I enjoyed the televised program. The problem is with trying to play a DVD-R on many of the newer DVD players. I'm not a ""techie"" so all the different DVD-R, DVD-RW, etc. confuse the heck out of me anyway. Just a warning to be sure know when you're buying a DVD-R Recorded On Demand product and that it may not play on your machine.",1233446400,8,359,4.294117647058823
8253860,1,B0014127NC,This negative review is not for the show.  It is for the poor packaging and the dvd-r format for the dvds.  Both disks would freeze at various points on playing in all three of my dvd players.  Both disks had scratches on them.  I will never buy a product from Monarch again.,1220054400,8,275,4.230769230769231
