8502114,1,B00000FBI1,"The description is for a film called ""Before You go"", starring Julie Walters, Joanne Whalley, etc ... Apparently, it has an alternate title, ""Memory of Water"".  The image provided, is for a foreign language documentary, whose Spanish(?)title translates into ""Memory of Water"".  Because ""Before You go"" is evidently only available in VHS format, I wanted to make sure that I didn't end up receiving the foreign documentary, which involved some gritty/depressing/bleak subject matter having to do with child abuse of some sort...Soooo... I sent an email to the seller to verify which film they were offering.  After being assured it was the movie I wanted, I was kind of upset when I received the @#!!&# documentary instead...  At the time, I'm not sure whether I notified Amazon or not -- I will send them a copy of this...  and after the seller gave me the wrong info, I figured I'd wasted enough time & money on the proposition.",1264896000,,929,4.8544303797468356
