WW II Movie Classics DVD Features --

This 3 DVD set features classic war movies including:

A Walk In the Sun, Go For Broke!, Gung Ho!, Casablanca Express, Ski Troop Attack, Battle Of Blood Island, The Stilwell Road, Nazis Strike, War Comes To America, Combat America, and Divide And Conquer, starring Dana Andrews, Van Johnson, Randolph Scott, Lloyd Bridges, Robert Mitchum, Ronald Reagan (as narrator), and more. Bonus features include authentic newsreels, rare radio highlights with photography, historic speeches, and more.

Six exemplary war films and a series of historical documentaries are collected on WWII MOVIE CLASSICS. Three of the films were produced during the war or the immediate postwar period, and each is interesting in its own way. GUNG HO! was made as the war was starting and is based on true historical events. GO FOR BROKE presents the little known story of Japanese-Americans who fought during the war. A WALK IN THE SUN, directed by Lewis Milestone (also known for the war classic ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT) was one of the first films to aim for total realism of character and appearance in its depiction of combat situations. The remaining three films, CASABLANCA EXPRESS, SKI TROOP ATTACK (directed by the legendary Roger Corman), and BATTLE OF BLOOD ISLAND were all made some time later. The series of documentaries that rounds out the collection were produced during the war for propaganda and morale. Coupled with GUNG HO!, GO FOR BROKE, and A WALK IN THE SUN they provide a view of how Americans conceptualized World War II as it was being fought, and a comparison with the later films illustrates how much that view has changed.
