7905534,2,B000009MS4,"American viewers whose only exposure to Hong Kong comedy has been the films of Jackie Chan will be greatly surprised (pleasantly or otherwise) at some of the more outrageous parodies that Hong Kong produces. LITTLE COP (1989) is a spoof of police films that may have been inspired by Hollywood's POLICE ACADEMY series, thanks to its collection of rookie cop hijinks, but is actually closer in tone and spirit to the anything-goes strategy of the AIRPLANE, NAKED GUN, and HOT SHOTS-type parodies. The quality of its relentless stream of gag segments ranges from hilarious to silly to vulgar to deeply obscure, thanks to numerous HK pop culture references (e.g. a soap opera spoof and a pop act performing at a funeral) that may or may not go over the heads of American aficionados. Numerous HK stars appear in cameos, including Maggie Cheung, Andy Lau and Jacky Cheung.
The title character is a short, rotund young man from a family of crooks who is allowed to join the Hong Kong Police Department when they let in ""handicaps."" He is played by Eric Tsang, who looks and sounds, to this reviewer, like a Chinese Lou Costello (of Abbott and Costello fame). Tsang is one of HK's top comedy stars, although he has frequently taken dramatic roles (GEN-X COPS, THE HITMAN, and COMRADES, ALMOST A LOVE STORY) and directed numerous films, including this one. LITTLE COP offers an opportunity for American audiences to see him in full comic starring mode, although curious fans should check him out first in Sammo Hung's MILLIONAIRES' EXPRESS where Tsang is one of the comic standouts among an all-star cast.",989539200,,1598,4.8786764705882355
