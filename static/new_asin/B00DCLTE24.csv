Ok yeah if you like found footage - paranormal investigator mockumentaries or just ghost hauntings in general this movie was intended for you. Unfortunatley  no one told the makers of this film that. Hey I know this is not an original plot- new reality ghost hunters show goes to a haunted local that's...Really Haunted-Ahhhhhh! But truthfully I cant get enough of them that's just me I love good found footage films ,especially this type- Grave encounters, episode 50 , the last episode, one of my favorites-The Feed (they even put commercials in the movie for the realism effect) even the last excorcism (great) would fall into this category. But not this film, like so many of this genre now a days they move to quickly not forming a decent plot the dialogue is filled with too much yelling at each other and special effects are horrible or non existent basically your waiting for the action waiting-then boom its over and credits roll.

5790363,2,B00DCLTE24,"A team of six setting out to make a pilot for a new paranormal reality TV show goes to an abandoned hospital with a dark history. Our team is composed of two groups: one is the TV show's inexperienced producer, the snarky cameraman, and the forgettable A/V guy. The other group, the amateur paranormal investigators, is composed of two overly-excited enthusiasts and the world's most air-headed ""skeptic."" Honestly, the story of how the producer found these three nitwits would have made for a better movie. Anyways, as the investigators, at the behest of the producer, start creating ""gags"" (faking ghost stuff for the sake of ratings), things actually start to happen in the hospital ironically parallel to what they're doing. Right fro the get-go of the movie, though, you know you're in for a rough ride: the opening scene is just B-A-D. I can only guess the makers of this movie included the scene to add a little backstory to the supernatural goings-on in the hospital, but given the number of things that happened in the hospital's history, it's completely unnecessary. Thankfully the rest of the movie is easier to swallow, but never rises above the countless other found footage movies with similar premises. Movie highlight: Scruffy from Futurama gives a guided tour of the facility to our intrepid team of losers.

5790371,3,B00DCLTE24,"After the reviews, I was expecting to give this a 1-star....but I was surprised.  Maybe it is because I went into it with such low expectations, but it definitely is not the worst horror film I have seen particularly in the found footage sub genre.  I was also doing some paperwork while watching it so I didn't waste all of my time, but even so, there are some good scares and decent effects.  The acting was okay for this type of film - the characters were somewhat believable as realty-show investigators.  No one was particularly over the top in performances which lent a bit of credibility.  The opening was slow and, yes, it does get predictable, but for a free Amazon Prime stream, it is somewhat effective.  If you are easily scared, this should frighten you; for the hardened horror film buff (which I am), it has its moments.
The backstory is  not developed very well -- too many items strewn together to keep track of anyway; the writers couldn't seem to decide which ghost story to run with.  It's a TB hospital, an experimental drug-gone-wrong hospital, a ?lumberjack headquarters? (really don't know what the heck that was there for), and a place of several tragedies.  Only one of the back stories plays any prominent place in the horror that ensues, so I'm not sure what the point of all the extras was.
Loved the caretaker -- he couldn't be more bored if you paid him (lol).
What I did like was that the ""reality show"" investigators didn't take themselves too seriously and made it clear they would invent the horror for their own purposes.
Didn't have the post-film, genre-typical written narrative on the screen of how the footage was discovered or of any investigation so I guess the viewer is on his own to figure that out.",1408233600,6,1744,4.636363636363637

I'm starting to think that the B movies from the 80's and early 90's need to be reclassified as A movies compared to what's being put out there now days. Thank God nobody is wasting film on this garbage anymore that will stay in a landfill for 200 years once it's thrown out and it can be deleted with the click of a mouse.

This is the result of what happens when everybody gets a trophy. Nobody is told anymore that, ""Man, you know kid, you kind of suck at that. You should try something else."" And now the rest of us have to suffer. Who are these people making this stuff? Sheesh.

I haven't seen a good low budget film in over a decade. This should be called no budget, but I suppose they spent $49 bucks at Wal-Mart on one of those throw away phones to film it on so 'technically' there was a budget. And it probably cost them a few bucks when they took the actors through the McDonald's drive-thru and let them pick 2 things from the dollar menu as payment for being in the ... no, I can't say it.

3 girls died in a fire.
A patient killed a nurse.
They experimented on patients.
They developed an experimental vaccine.
The building acted as a crematorium.
Lumber jacks trapped inside resorted to cannibalism.
and oh yea, the original house was used for devil worship.
How they forgot the aliens is beyond me.

What really made this unbelievable is the fact Trent Reznor didn't live there.

Only the 3 girls seem to be a factor in all of this, no burly lumberjacks ghosts looking for a meal. The film squandered early moments by not building character, leaving us with a bunch of people we don't know. In spite of the fact this should have been a professional film crew, the film is worse than a U-Tube phone camera up load.

The film moves slow so they must interject later scenes of ghosts to hold our interest, becoming its own plot spoiler. There were far too many purple tinted scenes of a herky-jerky camera showing cut-off faces.

I found myself rooting for the dead instead of the living because the living were killing me with the bad acting.  The icing on the cake was the names of the actors were the same as the characters they played.  Were they so new at the whole acting thing that they tried making it easier to remember the names of the characters they were supposed to portray?

Maybe they were crying with laughter, I don't know. The audio cut out at the end of the stream but by this point I was beyond caring.

As someone else commented, I wouldn't recommend it highly, but it's not awful and if you like horror flicks, it's a good way to waste a bit of time.",1490486400,,369,4.285714285714286
8591900,1,B00DCLTE24,"wow, what an utter waste of cloud-space needed to store this drivel. I'm from Arizona so have a natural intense dislike of metrosexual atypical (they're not all like that) Californians. Here we have a pack of them... a few nondescript male-ish characters and some strippers looking for a break into the movies (sums up LA right there). They wander around a building saying nothing important for the entire movie. Trust me you can live happily without that. In addition there are some little girl ghosts who pop up for about 5 minutes total and don't do much... well, they dance ring a ring a roses but thats about it. The only thing creative thing in these Prime ""F"" horror amateur productions is the cover picture and the titles, everything else is an embarrassment. Just one last point, it's found footage style, as if it wasn't bad enough to start with.",1489363200,,856,4.713333333333333
