7811341,5,630139433X,The transfer was almost fine for European movies filmed during this era.  I would rate it a 7 or 8 out of 10 for picture quality.  James Mason did a great job in a supporting role.,1357603200,,180,3.9722222222222223

The movie starts by a harbor in France, one fishing motor boat arrives from the sea. The captain plays cards and wins. Back home he gets a phone call and hangs up. Its not for the police. Lights out, curtains drawn! [Who is Joe Moran?] There is a noise inside the house. A stranger talks to them, but doesn't say much. ""How did you find me?"" [Is this actor's voice dubbed?] There is a fight, Joe wins. But he won't call the police. Joe explains his past life in Germany to Fabienne. He was part of a criminal gang. Joe tidies up, nothing on the living room floor. They carry ""Vermont"" away. Fabienne is fussy about a clean house. On the return they find three old friends waiting. Ross asks for Joe's boat. Will he go along? Yes. On the sea there is a boat with a Turkish flag. Opium? Joe learns about his stepdaughter.

Fausto is paged at the airport. Joe sees him, then meets a courier. They go for a ride and stop at a isolated cottage. Joe can bargain with Ross now that he has a hostage. But something goes wrong! Joe wants to get a doctor for Ross. Katanga makes a decision but it is overruled. Joe leaves with Moira to get a doctor and quickly return. There is an exciting car chase on a curvy highway, then the car goes off the road! [The red car looks like new.] The situation changes back at that cottage. Katanga is now in charge. They go for a boat ride together. A flare gun adds to the celebrations. And so it ends well. ""I'm hungry.""

This was filmed in southern France at the port of Beaulieu-Sur-Mer (a fine place by the sea). The story of a gang that abducts people goes back to ""The Petrified Forest"" and similar movies from the 1930s-1940s. The cast seems chosen by a quota system. You may find it just about average.",1336089600,,1760,4.2792792792792795
7811343,3,630139433X,"This is a good Bronson action movie that is a little ""corny"" by today's standards, but still very entertaining.  The main criticisms I have are poor sound quality, poor color rendition and a few ""jumps""
where the master has obviously been broken and spliced at some time.  This DVD is far better than the older VHS copies but the entire thing needs to be remastered with sound and color being digitally enhanced--if there
are any original masters left in decent condition.",1333843200,,472,4.814814814814815

JUST ANOTHER CHARLES BRONSON MOVIE. DUE TO THE POOR PACING AND THE PREDICTABLE PLOT, IT FAILS TO MAINTAIN MY INTEREST AFTER A WHILE. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SOLID, ACTION-PACKED MOVIE, YOU WON'T FIND IT HERE. THERE IS A GOOD CAR CHASE NEAR THE END. UNLESS YOU'RE A DIE-HARD CHARLES BRONSON FAN, DON'T EVEN BOTHER BUYING THIS ONE. JUST RENT IT INSTEAD IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN SEEING IT. BASED ON A NOVEL, ENTITLED ''RIDE THE NIGHTMARE''.",1097193600,2,606,4.726415094339623
7811345,1,630139433X,"I really liked this movie, I like Charles Bronson a lot. This is the worst DVD though. The colors change in the middle of a scene, one second the colors are fine and then they suddenly change and everything will have a bluish tint, the colors change several times during the movie. Try to find a copy by anyone except Direct Source.",1059264000,5,332,4.370967741935484
7811346,5,630139433X,"i loved this DVD. James Mason does an outstanding job...one can't tell it's him until you look closely and see his cheek bones beneath the beard. Charles is at his usual best. the story revolves around a group of people who know Bronson's character (Joe). it seems that Joe had once been the driver for this group of militants but bailed out at the last minute and escaped while the rest of the men were hauled off to prison. Joe had since moved to another country and married a British woman (his wife, Jill Ireland) but seven years later, the gang has traced Joe's whereabouts and they're out for revenge! Bronson's great acting combined with his trademark grin while he makes one insult after the other to Mason and his crew are not to be missed. also not to be missed is the car chases through the mountains at top speed. the DVD i have shows the 1980's Bronson on the cover with the graying hair at the sides but the film actually came out in 1971. this is a great film and one of James Mason's most under-rated.",1047686400,,1017,4.386243386243386
7811347,1,630139433X,"This DVD has a very bad image and sound. Altought it is a good movie, I don't recomend it if you are looking for a Charles Bronson movie for your collection due to its bad reproduction. No menu, no subtitles, no chapter  selection. I wished I did not buy it.",943574400,18,258,4.16
