This recording is exceptional - and I know what I am talking about being an audiophile since 1974. The sound is not  only relaxing - it is perfect (I use pretty good equipment, high end - studio quality), and I personally prefer to listen Susan Wong's performance comparing to well known Diana Krall or Norah Jones. The reason is - sound quality and emotional energy, implemented by a singer into it's performance. Yes, some songs have different impressions such as in our memory they sound differently. But it doesn't mean they sound bad or worse. I love this record, I believe Susan did her best, as well as all other musicians in Nashville, TX. Just listened to Quite Winter Nights as a sample of pure quality music, and actually this Susan's record delivered to me the same amount of pleasure.",1488499200,,898,4.6125
8626280,5,B00GQZTXVA,Brings back wonderful memories of great songs from the 70s.  Susan Wong does some very good interpretations with her soothing voice.  But it might not be to everyone's taste.  The production and sound quality is also excellent.,1447459200,,227,5.081081081081081

8626285,5,B00GQZTXVA,"Audio quality is very good which is the reason I purchased this disc. Susan is a polished artist, however would like to see her take a few more chances with her vocals but overall very entertaining and worth the purchase.",1414454400,,221,4.55

I agree absolutely  with the previous costumer review regarding the audio. It is knockout,
One of my best Blu - ray disc.",1406419200,,137,4.708333333333333
8626288,5,B00GQZTXVA,"A must have for those who are new to Susan Wong. I was sceptical at first but the moment I slipped the blu ray disc into my player I was blown away. Because it was recorded in a closed environment, the audio quality really stands out. The backing musicians accompanied her very well. The selection of songs were superb. Among my favourites are Billie Jean, California Dreaming, Sometimes When We Touch, Desperado....well its all delivered magnificiently. Verdict...its just AWESOME!",1399593600,2,482,5.113924050632911
