4471090,5,B004UV3KSO,It's good to  have a collection of the best of Miami Vice.  It was a great series. I am really enjoying this video.,1393545600,3,115,3.9565217391304346
4471091,5,B004UV3KSO,"My all time favorite TV series EVER.  Great purchase if you can't afford the whole series.  A few good shows are missing, but you can catch most on the net.  All that really mattered to me:  the Beginning & the End.  Thank the powers that be the 1st & last are here.  ""Have you ever considered a job in Southern law enforcement""?  If Crockett had any damn sense at all...he'd have taken up w/Gina...",1377388800,,399,4.3108108108108105

The CD is perfect, new & packaged with care!  I fell asleep last night watching #3 episode, for the 2nd time! =)",1376179200,,256,4.08

4471094,5,B004UV3KSO,"Obviously being a Miami Vice fan, I like this sample of the series.  If you do not want the entire series, this DVD set is your perfect dose of Miami Vice.",1367020800,,155,4.0
4471095,4,B004UV3KSO,"Crockett and Tubbs, fast cars, gorgeous women, bad guys, car chases, shoot outs. It's got it all...Whats not to love!",1366329600,,117,4.9
4471096,3,B004UV3KSO,"I am not a fan of this show, but I am a fan of eighties television, so recently when a local store was having a liquidation sale I spotted this on the shelf for $5.00. I grew up during the eighties and for me this series is one of the least memorable from that era, the only thing I do remember about this show is the opening titles and theme music. I decided to get this ""Best Of"" set because it was so cheap and just check it out after all these years. This set contains the best episodes from the series, including the feature length pilot and finale, so you get ten episodes, not eight. Guest stars include Glenn Frey, Bruce McGill and Julia Roberts. I have to say that not being a fan of this show these episodes are pretty decent, it doesn't make me want to buy the individual seasons because honestly this is all the Miami Vice I care to have. One thing I don't like about this set is why it includes only the second part of a four part story. ""Mirror Image"" may be considered one of the best but including it in this set just throws off the whole continuity. Replacing it with a stand-alone episode would have been better.

4471097,4,B004UV3KSO,"MIAMI VICE was a hit groundbreaking TV series and it had it's moments of great unforgettable episodes and some ridiculous episodes that made no sense or that were terrible! I have the complete series set with all 5 seasons,but but for those fans who feel that 5 season dvd's are too many,then just buy this dvd if it features the pilot & finale episodes,but I was this advertisement would mention what other episodes it includes,like ""GOLDEN TRIANGLE"" CALDERON'S RETURN"" THE PRODIGAL SON"" and the 3 episodes were Crockett loses his memory and believes that he's only Burnett! Well,let's see how the dvd sells",1306886400,6,608,4.912621359223301

8442281,2,B004UV3KSO,"I would strongly recommend just purchasing the season DVDs. Not to say that these are not good episodes, for the most part, they are. However, to try to summarize the characters, themes and show itself in just eight episodes, that is ridiculous. Where are the legendary episodes, ""Evan,"" ""Cool Running,"" ""No Exit, "" etc. One of my favorite shows ever, but a show that should be experienced in its entirety (although season 5 was awful).",1451088000,,436,4.826666666666667

8442283,4,B004UV3KSO,"The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is because they didn't include a few of my favorite episodes. ""Bought and Paid For"" was a GREAT episode with a very early performances from Joaquim de Almieda and Lynn Whitfield. I also thought that ""Evan"" and ""A Bullett for Crockett"" were outstanding episodes that could have been included here.

That being said: ""Smuggler's Blues"" is a great episode with Glenn Frey, The pre-opening credits scene of ""Calderone's Return, Part 2"" is by far one of the most incredible sequences on T.V. in the 80s'. Crockett and Tubbs are racing across the open sea in a Chris-Craft Stinger while the haunting Russ Ballard song ""Voices"" is playing in the back ground, as each cop reflects on how they got to where they are via a series of flashbacks. And they included the best T.V. episode of all time in ""Out Where the Buses Don't Run."" Who can forget the end with the incredible Dire Straights song ""Brothers in Arms"" playing as Hank Weldon reveals his darkest secret to Sonny and Rico and to the audience as well? Best twist ending on episodic television.",1427673600,,1083,4.670157068062827

8442287,4,B004UV3KSO,"What can I say?  I absolutely LOVE Miami Vice.  However, while the first disc in this ""best of"" collection is SOLID GOLD, the second disc seems to just be a mishmash of decent-ish episodes that includes the underwhelming finale.  Anyway, to not include the absolutely bad@$$ episode ""Bushido"" with Edward James Olmos taking down Russian assassins with a samurai sword is a true crime...  Wish I could have been the one to arrange that second disc!",1416355200,,447,4.842105263157895
