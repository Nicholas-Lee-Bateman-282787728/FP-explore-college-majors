433763,5,6302172888,"Sons Of The Desert is considered to be their best feature film. I can understand why. This is definetly one of their funniest feature films. Laurel & Hardy's feature films often lack the ongoing belly laughs of their short films. Sons Of The Desert,Pack Up Your Troubles,The Devil's Brother,BlockHeads,Saps At Sea and The Big Noise are the exceptions. This movie in particular,is also one of Stan and Ollie's most entertaining films. Actor Ty Parvis's musical number""Honolulu Baby""is an unforgettable classic. Sons Of The Desert is a must see for fans of Stan and Ollie. My collection of L&H movies wouldn't be complete without this one.",1077753600,,637,5.076190476190476
433764,4,6302172888,"""Sons of the Desert"" is often reguarded as one of if not the best film made by ""the boys"". It's thought that even if you've never seen a Laurel & Hardy movie you would still be able to understand the relationship the two characters had. And maybe that's true. Made in 1933, ""the boys"" had already established their characters. And there was plenty of chemistry.
 When first released many critics cited that ""Sons of the Desert"" was a remake of they're earlier short ""We Faw Down"", which is available on ""The Lost Films Of Laurel & Hardy Vol. 3"" just incase you're interested to compare the two. The basic idea of the movie is the same. That of the boys lying to their wives saying they will be in one place instead of another only to then find out, the place they were suppose to be at suffered a terrible accident.
 ""Sons of the Desert"" has ""the boys"" as members of a club called the sons of the desert. There is going to be a convention in Chicago, and NEVER in the history of the club has a single member not attended. But ""the boys"" have already made plans with their wives to go on a vacation. Now they have to come up with an excuse to not go on the vaction. If you're a true Laurel & Hardy fan you can probably think of another short ""the boys"" made that sounds familiar; ""Be Big!"".
 There is a lot of fun to be had with this movie. This along with ""Way Out West"" and ""The Devil's Brother"" would be my choice for their best films. There are some memorable moments, Oliver faking a sickness. Stanley calling a veterinarian to examen Oliver lol. Claiming he's cheaper. And a few other gags but I don't want to give them away.
 If you've never seen a Laurel & Hardy film this wouldn't be a bad place to start. I've already mentioned two other films to watch after this one if you enjoy it, but, I personally think their short subjects show them sometimes in better form. The often considered classic ""Music Box"" is one to watch. And try to get hold of ""Below Zero"", ""Brats"", ""Helpmates"", ""Going Bye-Bye!"", ""County Hospital"" & ""The Chimp"" those are just a few of my favorites.
 Bottom-line: Often considered ""the boys"" best film it is definitely one of their best. Everything was in place by the time this was made. They understood their characters, the timing was perfect and each played off the other so well. This is truly classic comedy. The way it should be!",1056153600,,2366,4.392694063926941
433765,5,6302172888,"This is one of the greats by L&H. It's fairly low-key in comparison to a lot of their work, but it has some real sidesplitting moments as well as the gentle humor (the ""antistooges"" as I've often considered L&H) that they are renowned for. The simple tale of ""honesty being the best policy"" could have porbably been told in a short-subject format, but this feature has no wasted moments. My favorite is the scene where the wives go to the movies thinking that our heroes died in a sunken ship in Hawaii and they see L&H jovially cavorting in the streets of Chicago in a newsreel. Stan and Ollie's clowing in this scene (their wild dance with the umbrellas is worth the price of admission alone) contrasts nicely with the wifely outrage.
But enough of that-see it and enjoy.",1049760000,,773,4.568345323741007
433766,5,6302172888,"The song interpreted by the 2 coming back from their ""vacations"" is for me the best part of the film if I had do choose between all. This movie is a MUST see!!",1038787200,,159,3.8484848484848486
433767,5,6302172888,"This is THE ULTIMATE Laurel & Hardy flick -- and it has stood the test of time. Its premise is pure situation comedy (the boys try to trick their wives into thinking they went on a cruise to Honolulu when they actually attend their lodge meeting in Chicago...the cruise ship goes down...the shocked wives then see their husbands in a movie newsreel). Its 1933 setting works to the film's advantage, as does the wonderful nightclub number Honolulu Baby.
There are several other reasons why of ALL the Laurel and Hardy features this is THE ONE to get if you are just discovering this classic comedy team, studying their work, or already know them and want to collect their films (a hard thing to do these days):
1. GREAT COMEDIC BALANCE: There's a perfect balance of laugh-out-loud dialogue, plus fast-paced slapstick...and it's all carefully integrated. It isn't as if there's a slapstick segment, then some dialogue, etc. It all blends together. I like slapstick and if you do you MUST see the attic scene, the pots and pans scene, Hardy's foot in the water tub scene and the sliding down the drain pipe scene. GUARENTEED belly laughs!
2. EARLY USE OF THE 'CALLBACK' COMEDY TECHNIQUE: David Letterman is a master of the ""callback,"" the joke repeated throughout a segment. Here, L&H use a line ""two peas in a pod-DAH"" as an early example of a callback (they were pioneers in this).
3. A PERFECT SCRIPT: There are NO wasted moments or frames in this picture. Each line, sight gag, and scene leads to the next.
4. THEIR CHEMISTRY: Unmatched by any comedy team (except Jackie Gleason and Art Carney in the Honeymooners tv shows). Every glance and line is perfectly timed for hilarity. These two comedy talents melded into one unmatched theatrical treat.
5. SUPERB SUPPORTING PLAYERS: Dorthy Christine is Stan's vivacious gun-toting wife; Mae Busch (who died very young) gives her best career performace as Hardy's shrewish better half; Charlie Chase is 100 percent energy as the hyper conventioneer and almost steals his scenes (Chase hated this performance but critics loved it).
This and WAY OUT WEST are THE features to show young people who want to learn about ""the boys."" What a tragedy it is that as of this writing videos of their movies are not being newly produced. If you see a used copy -- GET IT! Remember: generations of comedians have been influenced by Laurel and Hardy, from Gleason to Seinfeld. Hopefully 21st century audiences won't be deprived of their timeless comedy classics, which improve with age.",1009238400,15,2517,4.855813953488372
433768,5,6302172888,"Laurel & Hardy have to attend the fraternal convention of the Sons of the Desert but need a good excuse for their wives.  Hardy pretends to be sick and a doctor proscribes a long ocean voyage, with Laurel along for company.  Of course as soon as the convention is over and they arrive home the boys learn the ship they were on was wrecked.  But things get even better, because their grief stricken wives (Dorothy Christie and Mae Busch) are at the movies where they see a newsreel of the boys having a good time at their convention.  Laurel & Hardy end up hiding in the attic and then the roof to avoid their wives, before they show up at the front door with a fantastic tale of how they escaped being lost at sea.  Their wives, however, are not impressed.
""Sons of the Desert"" is an atypical Laurel & Hardy film in that the slapstick is toned down a bit while the inherent comedy and charm of the characters is enhanced.  A lot of the credit needs to go to director William A. Seiter, who takes a more subtle approach with the comedy in this 1934 film.  Why the boys did not make another film with Seiter is beyond me.  Laurel & Hardy are two of the most beloved characters in comedy history and the humor in ""Sons of the Desert"" has to do with them AS characters and not just with impersonal slapstick.  This is definitely my favorite Laurel & Hardy film.",990576000,11,1357,4.311023622047244
433769,5,6302172888,"SONS OF THE DESERT is one of Laurel and Hardy's finest films.  This gem of a comedy really deserves to be restored, remastered and re-released on video.  Like many of the boys' best comedies, the premise is simple:  Stan  and Ollie try to outsmart their wives so they can attend their lodge  convention.  Naturally, whenever Stan and Ollie put they're heads together,  disaster is never far behind.  SONS is full of inventive touches and great  dialogue (i.e. Ollie is expecting a doctor; Ollie:""Why did you get a  veteranarian?""  Stan:""Well, I didn't think is religion would make  any difference."").  The unjustly neglected comedian Charley Chase is  outstanding as a loud-mouthed conventioneer who befriends Stan and Ollie.  Mae Busch is in top form as the shrewish Mrs. Hardy.  SONS OF THE DESERT is  a thorough delight from beginning to end.",958521600,3,845,5.007246376811594

7822063,5,6302172888,this is an entertaining film showing the boys lie to their wives they are going to Honolulu when instead they went to fraternity convention without realizing Hardy's brother in law was there as a member and he called his long lost sister and put Ollie on the phone and then got his when he got home.,1384560000,,299,4.357142857142857

7822065,5,6302172888,"This is a review for the Anchor Bay VHS videotape of Laurel and Hardy's feature film, SONS OF THE DESERT (1933).

Yes, this is the one where at different times either Stan or Ollie declare that ""no one will be any the wiser,"" just before the next avalanche of disaster rolls thier way.

Stan and Ollie and thier wives share a stucco townhouse and a very close friendship.
Both belong to the fraternal lodge, The Sons of the Desert and both take a vow to
attend the Chicago convention next week.

But Ollie's wife wants to go to the mountains which Stan believes  might be wiser than Mohammad coming to visit her. Eventually the boys sneak to the convention in Chicago and that's when the fun begins.

In my opinion this is the most entertaining Laurel and Hardy feature film, over an hour of the boys doing thier best while doing thier worst. Plus you get to see the conventioning boys enjoying an  eye opening nightclub floorshow version of 'Honolulu Baby,"" and an excellent cameo by Hal Roach comedy great, Charley Chase.

Before the feature film begins, there is a short film of Stan Laurel and his father.
Very touching and not surprising that Mr. Laurel's family was apparently very close.

I have had this particular video tape for well over ten years and it plays beautifully
with no problems whatsoever.

Maybe someday an American manufacterer will wise up and release the Laurel and Hardy catalogue on good quality DVDs in chronological order, something like the Harold Lloyd set. But until that time us Laurel and Hardy fans will just have to  make do and this is a good place to start.",1262044800,,1596,4.627659574468085
7822066,4,6302172888,"There are a lot of funny scenes squeezed into one of the thinest ""plots"" you'll ever see in a story on a feature-length film.  Our heroes - Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy - simply want to go to the annual convention of their group - ""The Sons Of The Desert"" and want their wives' approval to make the trip.  That's it.

As it turns out, they go anyway and, well, it's one wild scene after another. Along the way, we see all the trademarks of these two famous comedians: Laurel scratching his head, crying when in trouble, having the better heart of the two and providing some clever slapstick and dialog. Hardy does his normal routine, too, with the dirty looks, the scheming and the pratfalls.

Oddly enough, on the second viewing of this film I found a bit slow going, which I didn't find the first time. Charley Chase, a famous silent comedian, is also in the film as are a few things you wouldn't associate with Laurel & Hardy: some sexual stuff! Really! There is a dance number in the middle of the film where I swear I saw a see-through blouse on the main dancer. Also, there was a play- on-words here about some woman ""who likes to pump the organ."" Well, this film was made a year or so before the Hays' Code went into effect.

At any rate, if you have never seen the famous duo, this is a good place to start.",1240790400,,1315,4.286290322580645
7822067,5,6302172888,"""Sons of the Desert"" (1933) remains a classic by any standard. Even non-Laurel and Hardy fans have admired this feature-length comedy, with the team's domestic mishaps augmented by hilarious dialogue. Director William A. Seiter proved an ideal match for the unique talents of Stan and Ollie, yet it was their only collaboration. A memorable supporting cast includes the ""ever-popular"" Mae Busch (as the crockery-throwing Mrs. Hardy) plus a splendid turn by Charley Chase as a relentless practical joker. Highly recommended.",1237248000,,523,5.55
7822068,5,6302172888,"""Honesty is the best politics,"" so sez Stan in their best ever comedy that is places The Boys at the height of '30s male political correctness ... bossy wives, smoking, drinking in Prohibition, male bonding clubs (i.e. the Shriners*), etc - how's that for ""scholarly overtones""?  In order to go to a Sons of the Desert convention in Chicago Ollie fakes Canus Delirious, as diagnosed by a doctor brought in by Stan - a veterinarian - because Stan ""didn't think his religion made any difference."" As usual Stan's malapropisms abound.

One of the things that makes this film different is that The Boys' marriages are given some depth so that we can see some attraction to each mate. The wives have the chemistry of a Thelma and Louise, and just as deadly.  Mae Busch is softened in blond hair and by her genuine care for her sick and drowning Ollie...but don't push it or pay the cost of a new set of china, pots and pans, and a black eye.  Dorothy Christy, Sugar, makes us glad that she is Stan's wife with her sense of forgiveness and great taste in lounging attire.

My idea of decorating has always been Early Laurel and Hardy (try telling this to a Margret Dumont-type decorator), and Sugar's Egyptian decor, made popular from the recent discovery of King Tuts tomb, makes us pea-green with envy for a home as cozy as two peas in a pod..ah. In costuming, the Honolulu Babies' shimmering hula outfits are only rivaled by Marilyn Monroe's ""...Hot"" nightclub dress. My fourteen year old, who has been reared on L&H, constantly asks if these styles were acceptable in the '30s (see 'International House'). What can a mother say, except ""Zowie! "" This could only be in pre-code Hal Roach.

The scripting is perfectly tight ('Some Like it Hot,' 'The Producers,' 'My Cousin Vinny,' and 'Clueless' almost achieved this too), and it's logic flows from one seamless scene to another. This is one reason for my rating of perfection; that and it's just plain fun. And The Boys have a lot of fun, for once, in which we can share; such as the uninhibited joy of dancing in the street, twirling umbrellas, admiring pretty girls, making telephone calls to long lost sisters, or singing that musical masterpiece ""Honolulu Baby"" accompanied by a rousing ukelele. L&H are the epitome of American humor: the worse the situation the funnier it is, but even harder to achieve is the humor of zaniness; Sons of the Desert has it all.

*I want to put in a word for the Shriners on which the movie was based, and in which my father was Potentate in San Francisco. He was never an exhausted ruler, for nobody has the invigorating parties of the Shriners (not even Kentuckians at the Derby). Men raised around the turn of the last century were closer to life and death, so life had to be made more fun; it's saving grace was humor and every household had it. All men of prominence were Masons and/or Shriners from Mason Thomas Jefferson to Shriner Roy Rogers (whose idea of a good time was jumping up and down on the couch with his numerous kids). These men of fraternity were raised on the tradition of anything goes and good will. The Shrine exemplifies the good hearts of the Boys with the great philanthropy of helping sick kids for free while continuing the occult mysteries of the Egyptians, and they get to wear great costumes. If any Son of the Desert (the official L&H Appreciation Society) ever wants to wear their fez more often and act silly like the Boys for real, clown with the Shrine. At the least it would do for the Sons of the Desert and the local Shrine clubs to get together for a great movie...This one is tailor made.

I, Charita, can be seen on You Tube as Ty Parvis sings to me in Sons of the Desert.  And if this doesn't make you buy the video/DVD, nothing will.

7822069,5,6302172888,"I have always liked this comedy, and it stands up well over time.  Sons of the Desert is the lodge that Laurel and Hardy belong to (does this look like Shriners and a Shriners Convention?).  The local lodge wants its members to go to the annual convention.  Stan has no problem getting an OK from his wife, but Ollie thinks he has to sneak away.  As usual, Ollie gets them into trouble.

Needless to say, their wives discover they are at the convention and not where they are supposed to be, according to what the wives were told by Stan and Ollie.  There are some funny scenes when the men return home and try to sneak in.

There are also some classic scenes in the motion picture, including Stan eating the wax fruit.  Stan Laurel could turn almost anything into comedy.",1139356800,,772,4.425531914893617
