5375269,5,B00A29MZYI,"I'm so happy with this product because I want to teach my son how to speak portuguese.  I love this DVD set because it is teaching him the European portuguese. I've searched everywhere for the European versions but all I could find were brasilian versions. My son (16 months old) was hooked since the day I showed him the preview of this. He loves watching these videos. Also, that is what I loved as well- the try before you buy.  The preview was enough to see if he was going to enjoy it.  Thanks Dino Lingo.",1357344000,2,510,4.291666666666667
5375270,5,B00A29MZYI,I like the DVDs so far and my son also. We watched two videos today and he wanted to watch more and it was amazing and awesome to see him repeating the words. I also learned a couple new words. It seems like a great set to teach little kids the basics.,1355702400,4,252,3.8653846153846154
8546119,1,B00A29MZYI,"I purchased the whole package for my children, the Persian DVD has a lot of mistakes, a lot of animation without description so a lot of wasted time in DVD. This product is not worth what they are selling it for. I speak the language so I can correct it for my children when I see mistakes, but people who want to learn the language and have no idea what is going on cannot know the mistakes. I rented from Amazon the French DVDs too and noticed those as well have a lot of mistakes.
In short, this product is not worth the money they are asking. I only tried Persian and French who knows what other languages they have out there with mistakes.",1492387200,3,644,4.201612903225806
8546120,4,B00A29MZYI,"I bought this product for a few reasons, but mainly because I am trying to get my children to speak Urdu in addition to English as their native languages. We already primarily speak Urdu in the household, with some English intermixed, and my children attend preschool which is taught in English. The animation for these videos is decent, and my children (3 and 4, respectively) seem to like it. The videos approach the language on a largely vocabulary basis, wherein they will take a topic (colors, food, numbers, animals, etc.) and show either animated or real life pictures and state the term for it in Urdu, as well as it written out on the side. They will then use some of the terms in a sentence like ""This is a horse"". The video is in Urdu only, but some of the terms they use are not necessarily what I grew up learning.
Pros:
1. Captures interest of my toddlers and keeps them interested for the duration of the video
2. Allows children to associate the terms with the object depicted
3. Supplements a natural speaking environment by building vocabulary and basic sentence structure

Con:
1. It will not work as a standalone language immersion or teaching strategy. It does not have enough material or depth to do a full immersion teaching, but is more intended for homes that are already engaging in language development.

Did not try:
1. Flashcards - as my toddlers are still very young, I am not using the flashcards to actually teach reading or writing. I am largely focused on speaking ability for my children",1466553600,,1522,4.654275092936803
8546121,1,B00A29MZYI,This product did not work for my toddler. It was cheap!,1449446400,,55,4.090909090909091
8546122,3,B00A29MZYI,Very basic videos.  Love the flashcards.,1445558400,,40,5.666666666666667
8546123,2,B00A29MZYI,I think its too much money for what you get,1441065600,,43,3.4
8546124,3,B00A29MZYI,Parts of the video graphics not suitable for young children. My 2.5  year old would run out of the room during certain parts that were scary. At 3.5 easier for him to watch but I don't think this set of CDs is the answer for him to speak fluent portuguese. I would give it more stars if the graphics were better quality and more suitable for toddlers.,1436227200,,351,4.2388059701492535
8546125,5,B00A29MZYI,"I wanted my sons to learn Urdu so they could communicate with and understand their elders. I have been using this set for little over a year and have had great success with it. My boys have picked up words that I didn't even know. I would highly recommend this learning system.

Now my sons can easily interchange between both English and Urdu.

Highly recommended and absolutely love it!",1412294400,2,388,4.608695652173913
8546126,5,B00A29MZYI,"I've been looking for something to help me teach my kids (5 and 3) Finnish and stumbled across this.  My kids love these videos and especially the sticker chart that came with it.  I like that they get excited about earning stickers for the words they have learned.  We've had these DVDs for about 6 weeks and they've learned about 1/3 of the flashcard words.  We do use a lot of the words in everyday life and I don't think they would have learned so many if they were just watching the DVDs.  This program is not perfect (there are some typos both in print and on the DVDs and the DVDs are kind of silly), but my kids like it and it's definitely the best thing I've come across to help my kids be excited to learn Finnish.",1385510400,,724,4.179856115107913
8546127,5,B00A29MZYI,"Probably the best learning tool I've found for my kids. All of the translations are correct and it keeps the kids interested. The only thing I would change is to make it more gender neural, it's much more geared to boys than girls.",1365120000,2,231,4.395348837209302
8546128,4,B00A29MZYI,"I was a bit skeptical initially as I was not too sure of the quality of this product. This however, has been a very good investment as my twin girls have started picking up words. They try to mimic what they see and hear from these DVDs.  Each DVD is different and so it keeps the kids interested. I would recommend this product as an initial tool to help your kids learn a new language at a young age.",1357516800,4,402,4.0886075949367084
