8589974,5,B00D6I7DW6,"Corey is one of my favorite video instructors--personable, clearly knows what he's doing and is a good communicator.  He doesn't talk too fast and he's not trying to ""sell"" you anything.
There's no real way to dress up playing Rhythm--let's be honest--it's not the most exciting thing in the world.  But Corey keeps it positive and takes you through example after example, large based on the key of A--7ths, 9ths, etc. to break it down and keep it going.  I like Corey's comments--his playing is fantastic, but not overwhelming.
I take this DVD on long airplane rides, where I just have to sit and watch it---but this is one of the most useful and best ways for me to learn how to play chords further up the neck and break out of Barre chord jail.  I recommend it for anyone who's tired of fingers cramping due to barre chord burn out.",1409443200,4,835,4.509933774834437
8589975,4,B00D6I7DW6,"Very good lesson here.  Corey is a great player, and there are lots of good examples included (just not 50).  I failed to give it five stars for the following:

There really aren't 50 rhythms here.  The first ten or so examples are just minor variations of one another, sometimes he gives you the same rhythm back to back with a short turnaround added, or the same rhythm in a shuffle versus a ""straight 8"" style or he shows you how to play the same rhythm elsewhere on the neck.  Out of the first ten, I would say there are really two or three.

I could benefit from a LOT more emphasis on how the turnaround works with the last bar or two.

On-screen tab or chord charts would help.

A little too much talking to set up the examples.

*********If possible, buy the ipad app and save some money off the dvd.",1405123200,,808,4.228758169934641
