8108836,5,B000EEWZMS,"This DVD is fabulous!! I bought it when I had my first baby and she was using some of the simple signs by the time she was 6 months old - like eat, more, milk.... SO exciting! I think that it is meant more as an instructional for parents, to teach them how to teach babies the signs, as opposed to being made to sit the kids in front of and have them learn directly from the video. It does take time and effort but I really think it is the coolest thing when babies sign back to you - cuts down on crying too!!! Definitely would recommend.",1194307200,,539,4.0
8108837,2,B000EEWZMS,"I was excited when I read babies and toddlers can ""learn over 200 words"".  However, my one year old and four year old will not sit through this video long enough to learn anything.  It is boring as can be.  It is basically one woman standing there in front of the camera teaching sign.  Occasionally, she will explain a reason for the sign (mostly for adults), but there is no repeating or recap, which makes it difficult for children to learn.  There are no pictures that go with the sign so my one year old loses interest immediately.  My four year old will watch for a few minutes, but gets frustrated because by the time she figures out how to do one sign, the instructor has moved on to four more.  While it is a very instructional video, it is not at all entertaining, nor geared for children.

I was very disappointed with this video.",1152921600,3,841,4.380645161290323
8108838,1,B000EEWZMS,"I bought this hoping it would teach my child a few signs since he is a little delayed in his speech.  The first video is simply an ""advertisement"" and the second video is geared toward an adult learning signs to teach.  It was of no interest to my son.",1123804800,2,252,4.122448979591836
8108839,5,B000EEWZMS,"I bought this video set when my daughter was an infant. I, along with my husband, taught her some of the simple signs-- mostly focusing on the ones we thought would come in most handy (ie, more, water, eat, all done, etc). We started when she was about 6 months old and we got a lot of flack from our friends who told us that it will confuse her and her speech development will suffer. ON THE CONTRARY!!!  She picked up signs really quickly and she was able to tell us what she wanted without the whining and screaming that our friends' children went through. In fact, I believe that she was able to learn words (verbal) more easily because she had the sign to attach it to and she wasn't frustrated because she was able to communicate with us at such an early age.

My daughter just turned 2 years old and my friends are amazed at how well she speaks. She's already stringing together 5 and 6 word sentences and is very articulate. Even strangers notice her advanced communication skills and always assume she's older than she really is.

Now my son is 7 months old and since starting on solids a couple months ago, we've been working on signs with him (eat, more, finished). As the need arises, we will add more to his repetoire and I'm sure his sister will help teach him too!

I also borrowed some of the other videos in the We Sign series from our local library and am currently looking into purchasing some. They're wonderful!",1109203200,2,1432,4.412878787878788
