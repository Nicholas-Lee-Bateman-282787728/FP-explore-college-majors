7815648,5,6301801660,"A tongue in cheek aussie style of raiders of the lost ark .being australian I find the movie
amusing in parts .the story is about a mystical tablet of gold with supernatural powers
over time and space which is broken into three pieces and hidden around the globe.
one bad guy trying to gain ultimate power at any cost and the hero that just want to
throw the thing back where it came from and forget about it.",1410134400,,409,4.256410256410256
7815649,5,6301801660,This movie should become a cult classic  it so bad it's great the script is passable effects laughable  just pure fun,1376179200,2,117,4.523809523809524
7815650,2,6301801660,"The film is terrible. The plot is totally dumb and the continuity totally sucks.
There were a couple of decent stunts but avoid this film.",1354060800,,138,4.56
7815651,5,6301801660,I am amazed this film isn't better known and available on DVD.  The lead and his girl are likable and far more human than the typical Hollywood specimens.  The plot zips along;  there's plenty of action; neat locales. The ending is a bit abrupt. It would have been better if the film were 20-30 minutes longer- something you can't say about many movies.  A very good way to spend 90 minutes or so!,1245456000,3,397,4.397260273972603
7815652,3,6301801660,"It wasn't the greatest adventure movie of its kind and the title is kinda misleading (although sky pirates to me were Don karnage and his gang on Disney's Tailspin)

I used to rent it all the time at Blockbuster back in 90-91 but haven't seen it since. It has a strong Tales of the Gold Monkey feel to it It's a good rainy day movie and I'd like to get it on DVd if it ever comes out",1137196800,2,383,3.91025641025641
7815653,4,6301801660,"Supernatural adventure movie with some touch of ancient Easter Island mystery. Some good flight scenes. For people with imagination ability it is an entertaining movie. If you have a reason to see it, it will give you a great nostalgic trip to the Indiana Jones genre. Amphibean airplane scenes.",1073260800,,295,5.040816326530612
7815654,1,6301801660,"I'm an Australian. I love Australia and I write reviews for alot of Australian stuff here on Amazon.com trying to bring publicity to my native land.
This film is awful. On behalf of Australia, I am sorry.
John  Hargraves and Bill Hunter are great actors. I don't know how they got  involved with this mess. Get them in anything else.
DO NOT BUY  THIS!",965520000,,351,4.453125
