8145553,2,B000IHYUQK,"Horrific graphics, terrible acting, and most importantly, outdated science (even at the time it was released).

Watching the actors playing Hominini do the monkey shuffle and act like kids would do if you asked them to play chimpanzee was really irritating. Watching the weedy, pasty, supposed archaic humans gingerly trapse across their habitat (like beachgoers without shoes crossing a hot parking lot), made me hate this film.

This film has neither scientific value or any value as entertainment.",1351728000,2,500,5.397435897435898
8145554,4,B000IHYUQK,"How did Homo sapiens evolve? How did our brains begin to change? And why did early humans suddenly start creating art? What about the concept of past and future? What pushed our forerunners to explore beyond the narrow confines of the world they lived in? How did they learn to solve problems, to become innovative thinkers and, most of all, to survive when other species failed?

The mega-budget, two-part series, Homo Sapiens boldly considers questions like these by examining our evolutionary milestones.

Homo Sapiens deftly employs both docu-drama and interviews with key scientists to illuminate the remarkable story of the origins and development of our species. Seminal moments like the discovery of tools, adaptation to climate change or the hunting of large mammals are re-enacted in this ambitious documentary. At the same time, current thinking on subjects as diverse as the evolution of human belief systems, changes in migration patterns and the emergence of cave painting is revealed.

  A sequel to the hugely successful A Species Odyssey (which posted record audiences and was seen by some 35 million viewers worldwide), Homo Sapiens is made by the same creative team. Director Jacques Malaterre, Artistic Director Adrien Morot and Director of Photography Martial Barrault used meticulous set decorations, elaborate FX effects and a team of Montral makeup artists who worked long hours to transform the cast into the believable prehistoric men and women we see on the screen.

Homo Sapiens, a French-based co-production, attracted a huge audience share when it was screened in France earlier this year. Today when evolution is back in the news and intelligent design is stirring up controversy once more, Homo Sapiens is a compelling and intriguing addition to a topic that continues to fuel our imaginations.

Homo Sapiens is directed by Jacques Malaterre. Michael Allder is Executive Producer of The Nature of Things.",1294012800,5,1936,5.30718954248366
