1458680,5,B00005JKWX,"There, but for the grace of God, go I.

While it is not scary in the traditional sense of the word, John Q is, by far, the most frightening movie I have ever seen.  It is the story of a man who plays by the rules, and yet he and his family are, effectively, deemed expendable.  How does a person handle that?  What extreme measures will an ordinary person resort to when he is pushed beyond reason and left with no recourse?  Could this be me?  Could it be you?

Denzel Washington is all too believable in his role as an ordinary man who does the unthinkable to get what he needs.  Highly recommended.",1492387200,,601,4.2105263157894735

1458739,5,B00005JKWX,"Highly under-rated and ignored by most in 2002, ""John Q"" is one of those movies that is sometimes too intelligent for a viewing public unfamiliar with topics never really tho
ught about in common societal circles (health care and insurance policies, rights of blue-collar citizens, media exploitation, law enforcement practices and over-paid medical specialists). Denzel Washington's young son falls out one day at a little league baseball game. The diagnosis is frightening. Without a new heart, the boy will most definitely die. Washington, a normal everyday citizen, lacks substantial resources and benefits from his insurance to even get his son on a donor's list. It is blatantly obvious that Washington and wife Kimberly Elise are being strangled by red tape in a mercilessly heartless (no pun intended) system. Friends Laura Herring and David Thornton (and seemingly countless other ordinary people) do their best to help the couple raise money and soon it seems that most everything they have is on the market to be sold. Work and more hard work does not get the couple much closer to having the money they desperately need. Washington realizes that time is now of the essence. He has been pushed and pushed again and now he takes it upon himself to push back. As a last resort he literally takes the doctor (James Woods) hostage, along with other bystanders who have nothing to do with Washington's war with the hospitals and insurance organizations. Immediately cops led by Robert Duvall and Ray Liotta surround the hospital and the tenseness builds. Hungry media cronies (who would not help Washington when he had asked earlier) also try to benefit from the misery of all those that are involved with their typical exploitation tactics (one thing Jerry Springer got right). Will Washington's son be saved and is Washington actually willing to take his own life in the venture so his boy can live? ""John Q"" is a very impressive production from director Nick Cassavetes (showing much of the same ability his late father John showed throughout his career). Screenwriter James Kearns gets to the soul of an American society that has been blinded by economics and inefficient big-wigs who have no business possessing the careers they have. Morality has gone out the window and that ""hypocritical oath"" that is so prevalent in the medical field seems to be little more than a silly afterthought. ""John Q"" succeeds everywhere just about except in its ending. The ending is a major mistake that took away from some of the good things accomplished before the final ten minutes. Washington, arguably better here than in recent triumphs like ""Training Day"" (an Oscar-winning role) and ""Antwone Fisher"", goes to an even higher plateau here. Much like Al Pacino in the equally under-rated ""Dog Day Afternoon"" (an admittedly better picture), Washington dominates in a role that thrives on a claustrophobic aspect that cannot be escaped or denied within the film's running time. Duvall and Woods are also solid, as always, but Washington is the man here. Strikingly accurate when pointing the finger at things wrong with America these days, ""John Q"" is a thought-provoking production that will cause its audience to think and learn about sometimes forgotten aspects of human life.",1474243200,4,3276,5.091078066914498

1458812,5,B00005JKWX,I have to give Denzel credit for a movie like this because and the reality of the real world we do face challenges of getting the right care from hospitals and doctors everything takes money and a fight to try to survive  in this country. I've read a lot of reviews concerning this movie people need to give it credit where to do this man really put up a fight for his son the love of his son it doesn't get any better than that a good performance he is willing to die for his son if he have to and I love you and call that love I don't know what you call it but it's the love of God and the love of his Child his son. but we are living in the country to wear but we don't get the services that we deserve anyway health care  is screwed up in this country people dying from diabetes people dying from all sickness and diseases as a whole is this supposed to be the richest country in the world where we are not fighting for right for people to have the best Health Quality of their lives. I don't care what no one says this is the best movie that I like and it means something to me and Might don't to others but it means something to me .,1460419200,,1139,3.9051724137931036

This is great movie to get you to question concerns over the ever-growing problems with our nation's health care policies, as well as some hard-hitting performances from its talented actors. Because of this John Q is a awesome movie, even though it is predictable at points the movie will still pull at your heart strings.

This movie is brilliant not just from the great acting but also because their theme is so real-life.  The basic plot is about a young boy who collapses at his softball game; we later find out that the reason why he collapses is because his heart is weak. He is in need of a heart transplant immediately. His parents have insurance, but the insurance will not cover the $250,000 heart transplant. Then Denzel shows everyone what unconditional love really is.  You need to watch all that John Q. and his wife did in an effort to accumulate the funds needed for their sons' transplant was so emotional and so heartfelt.",1444176000,4,1015,4.685393258426966

1459114,3,B00005JKWX,"You can rarely fault a Denzel Washington performance though I question at times his choice of roles.  (Why he allows his talents to be wasted on meaningless 'shoot 'em up' films like Training Day or Man on Fire I'll never know).  So I cannot fault his acting in this film . . . but I agree with reviewers that the story was often implausible and predictable.  So many scenes were utterly unbelievable -- like the beaten-down-by-abuse girlfriend suddenly gaining the hudspah (not to mention physical skill) to go all ""Jackie Chan"" on her abusive boyfriend?  Only in Hollywood!

This film is clearly an adult ""revenge fantasy,"" and to a certain extent there is nothing wrong with that for a sane individual who understands that it IS a fantasy (i.e., in reality the son would not have gotten a heart transplant and the father likely would not have left the hospital alive or been a hero). One concern, though, is that impressionable viewers might be persuaded that an over-the-top, in-your-face approach to solving a personal problem (like the one exhibited in John Q) COULD succeed -- and that's not a good message.  But I admit that probably no one is going to try something like what John Q did, so that concern is minimal.

My other objection is to a subtle but ultimately more destructive message that many viewers WILL act upon, and unfortunately it is delivered in the most powerful scene of the film:  John Q's emotional speech to his son about how to live his life.  The speech sucks the viewer in with a lot of genuine wisdom, but then delivers this poison:  ""Son, always go for the money, make sure you earn a lot of money, even if it means you have to compromise yourself, because life is better the more money you make.""  NO NO NO.  The movie's premise that John Q is a moral superior is undercut and destroyed in one fell swoop by this one potent line of dialogue.

The systems in America which act as obstacles to most of us in our attempt to fulfill basic needs -- HMOs and the healthcare system included -- have gotten the way they are in large part because individuals compromise values in order to keep a job in the mistaken belief that survival requires moral compromise and that ""this is what everyone does.""  Yes we all have to support our families and yes American business is not especially ethical.  But it has been my experience that we live in a benevolent universe, a universe which will actively assist the survival of those who dare to hold fast to a moral vision and consistently choose doing ""what is right"" over what is merely expedient (or ordered by someone with superior authority).

The supreme irony of this film, then, is that John Q HIMSELF is part of the dysfunction which resulted in his son being denied a heart transplant!  I.e., employees of the HMO which denied coverage no doubt share John Q's belief that it is okay to compromise human values in the course of one's work ""for the sake of earning money.""  If most Americans had firm moral values and then refused to compromise those values on the job, then John Q's son would have likely had his heart transplant approved from the get-go, and the extreme act of taking a hospital hostage would have never been necessary!

These are the types of dialogues we-the-people need to have openly and publicly, and that is why I have taken the time to write this review for an otherwise average Hollywood action film.  I give John Q 3 stars because it has value for two reasons.  First it is a catalyst for discussions we averge Americans should have amongst ourselves, and second it exemplifies one of America's biggest problems:  we refuse to acknowledge that commitment to a moral vision at the individual, personal level -- by each of us, for each of us -- would solve so many of our larger societal problems . . . not to mention that beyond the amount necessary to sustain the necessities of life, having money has no bearing whatsoever on the quality of an individual's  experience of life.",1407456000,,3983,4.618439716312056

1459118,5,B00005JKWX,"John Q. faces the same problem a lot of struggling Americans do today.  As the film unfolds, some very critical issues surface.  These are the backbone and the inspiration for this amazing film.  Of course the film wouldn't be nearly as good without Denzel Washington.  His emphatic portrayal of a man on the edge is without a doubt what brings audiences to the theaters for dramas in an already dramatic world.

I agree with New York Times reviewer Elvis Mitchell that the stereotypical collection of hostages is beneath the quality that an issue likes this deserves.  If a situation like this really were to unfold, the liklihood that a stereotypical crayon box of characters probably wouldn't be available.  Instead, it is more likely the true hostages in a situation like that would be burdened with enough sub-plot sequences that his problems wouldn't be limited to negotiating with police.

I'm not in agreement with Mr. Mitchell's suggestions however that Washington, and Duvall are doing great performances of a ""ham-fisted' cliched predictable plot.  When John Q. Archibald throws himself into the pot as an alternative, the plot thickens excitably.  It might be far from possible, but it still intrigues. It might be those very predictable and fantastic elements that appeal to the public audience Washington's character stands for.

Just before Washington gets set to go under the knife, he tells the hostages that he will see them in the funny papers.  The topic of this film may hit the serials, but this is not a movie to be joked about. Robert Duvall, Denzell Washington, Ray Liotta, Kimberly Elise, and Eddie Griffin bring stellar performances to another film I look forward to sharing.",1404518400,2,1702,5.039285714285715
1459119,5,B00005JKWX,"JOHN Q (2002) is a drama about health insurance, starring Denzel Washington (father), Kimberly Elise (mother), James Woods (heart surgeon), and Robert Duvall (police negotiator).  The film also includes Daniel Smith (the son), Anne Heche (cold-hearted hospital administrator who has no choice but to deliver continuing disappointing news to Denzel), and Paul Lampley (television reporter covering events taking place in the emergency room, thereby drumming up public support for Denzel, and embarrassment to the hospital).

IN A NUTSHELL.  In a nutshell, Denzel's young son is in a baseball game, but loses consciousness while running from first base to second base.  He is taken away in an ambulance, and is diagnosed with a heart failure.  Because of the inadequacy of his heart, the heart has expanded to three times its normal size.  The only treatment is a heart transplant.  The main issue (meaning, ""big problem"") is that Denzel's health insurance doesn't cover heart transplants.  A second and underlying issue, which is a continuing theme in this movie, is the divide between the rich and poor in America, regarding access to insurance that provides comprehensive medical care.  Denzel formulates a quick fix to his dilemma, and decides to use a gun to take hostages in the emergency room.  Denzel's goal, in taking hostages is to force the administration to agree to put the son on the waiting list for receiving a heart transplant.  The hostages include James Woods, and several others.

The film is remarkable in its inclusion of African Americans and Hispanics, but where the reason to include them has absolutely nothing to do with their racial or ethnic background.  In other words, the film includes African-Americans and Hispanics, only because these folks that are typically encountered in society.  To illustrate my point, movies such as MEN OF HONOR or TUSKEEGEE AIRMEN, include African-Americans only for the reason they are African-Americans.  But JOHN Q includes a rich assortment of African-Americans and Hispanics, only because the American populace comprises these particular groups.

WHAT THE FILM IS NOT.  The storyline is excellent, despite the flawed premise that there is anything appropriate or believable about the notion that one can take hostages in the emergency room of a hospital, in order to force the hospital to foot the bill for a $250,000 medical procedure.  Rather than give away too many elements of the story, I will only state what the film is not.  There are no computer graphics.  There are no wild police chase scenes.  There is essentially no swearing.  There are no gunfights.  Also, this is not a comedy, though there are occasional comedic nuances, now and then, from two of the hostages.  Despite the lack of violence in this movie, the final 20 minutes or so provides a tense direction in the plotline, which is likely to induce nail-biting behavior in many viewers.  Although the film is notably lacking in clever dialogue, amusing cliches, and memorable throw-away lines, the movie is rich in something else.  What the film is rich in is its presentation of ethical dilemmas, and a plot that unfolds itself and compels the viewer to remain glued to his seat.

THE ENDING.  The last 20 minutes of the film gets more intense, and there are a couple of clever twists in the plot.  The film has a happy ending.  I do not reveal the ending in this review.",1404345600,2,3408,5.0447227191413235

1459211,3,B00005JKWX,"My bargain-rack movie for last night was ""John Q."" starring Denzel Washington. I found it on a five-dollar rack. It was worth the money, but that's about it. It seemed like a story, actually several stories, within a story. For example, the movie starts with a careless driving scene in which a woman gets her fancy car sandwiched between two Semi trucks and dies in the accident. Then that story is left hanging and you don't get back to it until the final minutes of what seemed like a rather long movie. Strange organization. Then there was Denzel Washington's seemingly healthy and happy little boy suddenly gravely ill and needing an emergency heart transplant. Of course, the times were tough and he had just had his health insurance policy reduced to minimal coverage. Then began a long propaganda barrage set against the American Health Care System, insurance companies and money-hungry doctors and hospitals. The lengthly message was directed at you, the audience. It had a lot of validity, I must admit, but I hate entertainment features that are trying to sell me something.

In any case, Washington becomes increasingly frustrated, finally to the point where he takes over the hospital. The episode strains credibility. However, the emergency helicopter form the car wreck (Remember the opening scenes of the movie?) arrives with a dead body that just happens to have a useable heart and it just happens to have the right blood type and the little boy is miraculously saved at the last moment. Now, if you can get through the movie believing all this, I happen to have the deed to a very large bridge in Brooklyn that I'd be willing to sell at a bargain price.

The movie is fairly well produced. The acting is  good, but not spectacular. The story momentarily  tugs at the heart strings here and there. I guess the problem is  that the whole production strains credibility. Yes, I think that's it. There's a lot of extra materials, but I didn't find the movie itself interesting enough to spend the extra time viewing them.

1459377,2,B00005JKWX,"""John Q."" (2002).  In this dramatic thriller, John Quincy Archibald's cute son Michael collapses while playing Little League baseball as a result of heart failure. John rushes Michael to the nearest Chicago hospital emergency room where he is informed that Michael's only hope is a transplant. Unfortunately, as John, a blue-collar worker, has been reduced to working only twenty hours a week at the factory, his medical insurance has been similarly reduced.  His insurance won't cover his son's surgery.  As he believes that he is out of options, church-going John Q. takes the emergency room staff and patients hostage at gunpoint, until such time as the hospital doctors will agree to do the operation.

Denzel Washington, an Oscar-winner for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Training-Day/dp/B00005JKED/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Training Day</a>, turns in his usual powerhouse performance in the title role.  In the part of his similarly church-going wife Denise, we have Kimberly Elise. I've noticed a trend in Washington's movies - his character is almost always married, and to a black woman - but the actress is never particularly beautiful, nor well-known.  (Only exception to this was 1999's THE BONE COLLECTOR, in which his disabled character Lincoln Rhyme successfully woos Angelina Jolie, who is masquerading as a Hispanic police officer.)  Anne Heche (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Six-Days-Seven-Nights/dp/6305213283/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Six Days, Seven Nights</a>)plays cold-hearted hospital administrator Rebecca Payne; James Woods(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Against-All-Odds/dp/B0018Q7JRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Against All Odds</a>) is business-as-usual coronary surgeon Dr. Raymond Turner.

Ordinarily reliably avant-garde director Nick Cassavetes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Notebook/dp/B000YMM3CC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Notebook</a>) directed.

Heche, Woods, Liotta and Duvall probably all signed on for the chance to play characters each of whom has the same arc: initially by-the-book rules followers, each eventually sees the light and sings in Denzel's choir. It's hard to see Cassavetes' hand in this would-be social issue drama that yearns to weigh in on the real-life American problem: the lack of universal medical care.  It ain't much of a thriller.  Not only does it lack that avant garde edginess we might associate with Cassavetes, it is predictable, melodramatic, full of preaching to the choir, and downright soggy.  It just might irritate even viewers who wish to see the health care situation ameliorated.  Best only for Denzel fans, and, unfortunately, the now definitely middle-aged actor is no longer eye candy.",1322697600,2,3306,6.992718446601942

1459381,5,B00005JKWX,"I was totally ready to dismiss John Q as a very generic and predictably written storyline, however the quality improved dramatically once the actual hostage situation got underway.

It's about a father and mother with a young son who happens to unexpectedly and predictably develop a heart problem during a baseball game.  It's predictable because you knew what was about to happen at the game.  After being rushed to the hospital, we immediately find out that the boy needs heart transplant surgery urgently or else he will die.  Of course, getting such a surgery won't be so simple.

First the mother and father struggle to find a way to put their son on the donor list, then the boy has to actually find a donor match, but the part that will REALLY strike a negative reaction out of the viewers is the way the family continues to be denied assistance by the medical staff as far as taking care of the child because the family doesn't have insurance or enough money.

This of course means the doctors continue to turn the family away time and time again despite the family desperately trying to find a way to make enough money (through church donations in one particular instance) and never making anywhere close to enough (I believe the doctors wanted 250 grand in order to go through with the surgery... YIKES!).

What makes John Q not as predictable as most ""Boy/girl is dying of a strange disease dramas"" is that, about halfway through, the father actually becomes so fed up and aggravated with the lack of help for his son that he walks into the hospital and takes a bunch of people hostage (many of which need urgent medical attention themselves).

What's REALLY appealing about the hostage situation is that each of the hostages is given enough time to develop a character, so we, the viewers, actually get to know and understand them.  Another interesting aspect is that the father isn't really considered the bad guy despite making constant threats to the police officers (who are standing around outside holding guns) that he will kill the hostages one by one unless the doctors DO something to help his dying son.

This movie does a fantastic job illustrating the mental pain that families have to go through pertaining to getting what they need during an emergency involving health insurance and money situations.  The storyline explains who exactly *is* the bad guy during these situations, and why.  It's really well written and fascinating to pay attention to, because you'll be thinking about it afterwards and wondering how much greediness is actually taking place in, not only in hospitals, but everywhere in the world where power reigns.

I totally loved the final 45 minutes, which is a slight twist from how you're probably expecting the movie to end given the storyline build-up to that point.  I WON'T be spoiling what happens either.  I refuse to mention anything that happens during this period of storytelling.

The one negative is that there were *several* moments where the hostages could have easily overpowered the father and taken the gun away from him, but they never did (well, besides that one botched attempt by the wife beater).  I'd like to think the reason behind this is because they understood the frustrating predicament the father was in, but eh... they didn't know him well enough yet at that point in the storyline other than he was a lunatic waving a gun around and making demands.

So yeah, stick with this one.  What starts out as something cliched and boring will gradually become a very watchable and emotional story.  I highly recommend it.",1307491200,3,3592,4.828711256117455

1459468,3,B00005JKWX,"I don't think you can walk away from `John Q' without a heavy heart, but it would be a completely manufactured and obviously manipulated `weight'.  Yes, `John Q' is a touching and heartbreaking story, but it is so insanely convoluted in texture that its own plot development becomes its biggest flaw and thus the ending emotional result feels cheep and unwarranted.

It doesn't deserve to reach those heartstrings.

The film tells the story of a down on his luck father named John, who finds himself in a tight situation when his son becomes in serious need of a heart transplant.  His healthcare provider won't cover the surgery and the hospital won't go forward with the procedure because of that.  John and his wife (and obviously their son) are helpless here.  That is why John decides to take the emergency room hostage and basically force the procedure to be done at gun point.  While that plot point may seem rather forced and a tad improbable, it could have been the catalyst for some seriously poignant dissection of the healthcare system in general.  Instead, this film becomes a bland string on random clichs that create a feel of `made for television' that permeates the films core.

The cast is more than capable of carrying this film, had this film actually been scripted as a worthy canvas for their talents.  Look at the many faces that lather the screen.  Denzel Washington (Oscar winner), Robert Duvall (Oscar winner), James Woods (Oscar nominee), Ray Liotta, Anne Heche and Kimberly Elise.  They are all pretty fantastic at times and they have all proven themselves capable of carrying films.  Sadly, the material they are saddled with here is just too generic and preposterous for them to really create anything meaningful out of it.  This concept really needed an organic script, something that could breathe with a humanity needed to achieve something profound.  Instead, `John Q' ditches its obligations and divvies off into melodramatic territory that feels like a cheap thrill; a manipulated variation of Hollywood fluff directly designed to raise money, not debate.  This was a golden opportunity to do something real, for the source material itself is something that would cause seriously controversial discussion.

Where is the grit when you need it most?

Ha, Beany (my Ammy buddy), this would have been an ideal pitch for your friend Oliver Stone to develop.

In the end I must say that I am very disappointed with `John Q'.  I remember seeing it in the theaters when it was first released and my taste was less than desirable and even then I found that it seemed less authentic than it wanted to be.  Upon further reflection those initial feelings have been amplified.  It's sad, because this had so much promise.  I'd give it a C, but that is solely based on the fact that Denzel Washington really makes his character blossom despite the lack of depth in the script.",1280275200,2,2898,4.869387755102041

He sold all of their jewels, appliances and anything else worth anything, he went to insurance company begging them to help him, he visited the hospital, hoping they would help him, and he even told the doctor that it was all right to kill him and give his son his heart. I was so touched during that whole movie, it's difficult to even put my feelings into words.

1459545,3,B00005JKWX,"The acting in this film is excellent, there is no question about that.

John Q. Archibald (Denzel Washington) is a factory worker whose hours have been cut back. His family is always struggling and his car has been repossessed for lack of payment. He always promises his wife (Kimberly Elise) he will take care of things. That never seems to happen.

But then their son Mike (Daniel E. Smith) drops, unconscious, after hitting a home run at a baseball game. At Hope Memorial Hospital, heart specialist Dr. Raymond Turner (James Wood) informs the shocked parents that their son needs a heart transplant, and their health insurance has denied the procedure. They should make him as comfortable as possible and prepare for the worst, he says. Mike is going to die.

John does not believe this is possible. He goes to his company benefits department, which then tells him that indeed, the HMO will not cover the surgery.

And here's the factual rub. It is illegal to change a family's health insurance plan without informing them of the changes that have been implemented. But in this plot line, John Q.'s insurance has been changed from full coverage to $22,000 in total (or thereabouts), since he is no longer working full hours. However, John Archibald was never notified. Families are required to be offered full coverage under COBRA provisions, and cannot be automatically changed from full health coverage to virtually none without having been fully informed.

So while it makes for great drama, this film is based on a false premise. There is no way that John Q. Archibald could have lost full health coverage without knowing it.

From this point, the grieving Dad takes his story to a seemingly sympathetic pressman, who in fact is only interested in a scoop that will make his career---not ticking off his editors with another sob story about a bad situation that no one can easily address.

So John and his wife sell everything they have that isn't nailed down, and raise $6,000 to pay their son's uncovered hospital bills. By now he has been ill for longer than their meager policy will cover---even without the surgery. But the funds are inadequate and the cruel hospital administrator  plans on releasing their son Mike. The surgery has not been approved, his insurance is used up, and he's going to die.

John's wife tells him to ""Do Something."" This time, John breaks his usual do-nothing pattern and more than succeeds---via criminal actions, albeit actions with which any loving parent can empathize.

John goes to the Hope hospital emergency room with a concealed handgun. He takes hostage all the emergency room patients---a drunk driver and his injured girlfriend, a pregnant woman, a mother and her child, doctors, nurses and other staff on duty. After several hours of accomplishing nothing, John informs the police and hospital administrators that he will begin killing the hostages if his son is not placed on the transplant list immediately.

Now, that insensitive pressman, who did nothing before, is hot on the hottest story of the year. He runs a live feed into the emergency room and broadcasts a telephone conversation in which the hospital administrator informs John Archibald that Mike is going on the transplant list, after all. She's faking. The Police Chief (Liotta) asked her to go along just to save lives. But they are now trapped in their own lie, which the public has seen. Their gooses are cooked.

What happens next is all as inconceivable as the initial premise---that John's family health insurance plan was canceled without his knowledge or consent, before he was offered an opportunity to extend full coverage by paying himself.

It all makes for good drama, a tearjerker, and superb acting. John Archibald becomes an unlikely hero, as he demands that all the other patients are treated for free, and chief police negotiator Frank Grimes (Robert Duvall) thwarts the Police Chief's election year ploy to make headlines by sending in a sniper.

Unfortunately, the story line is completely implausible, and dangerously misleading. I'm therefore giving this movie only three stars.

In effect it's propaganda supporting national health insurance. However, the national health plans elsewhere---in Great Britain and Canada, among other places---leave more people waiting to die than in the U.S. They're denied treatment or benefits for lack of funds, facilities or physicians. Even socialized medicine still needs to allocate resources. Neither emotion nor family love have anything to do with how those resources get allocated. The most likely to benefit are treated. Expensive and unproven procedures are not used. And tens of thousands of people have died---waiting.

Sure, U.S. health care is broken. Insurance is too costly and hard to come by. However, foreign experience has already proven that nationalized health care would only make the broken U.S. health care system worse.",1229817600,,4921,5.086848635235732

1459549,5,B00005JKWX,"Mike Archibald (Daniel E. Smith) seemed perfectly healthy until he collapsed at a baseball game.  He's taken to Hope Memorial Hospital where Dr. Raymond Turner (James Wood) advises the family the child needs a heart transplant.

Unfortunately, John Q. Archibald (Denzel Washington) has an HMO and the surgery isn't covered. Despite the family being barely barely able to survive financially, they don't qualify for Medicare. John hocks everything he owns and pays the hospital a hard raised $6,000, they're going to release Mike.  Mike's Mom (Kimberly Elise) tells John to DO SOMETHING.

The only thing John can think of to stop his son being released to go home and die is take the hospital ER hostage. He takes a gun--which he has not yet sold--and does just that.

Everyone has an agenda in this.  The Police Chief (Liotta) wants to appease the mayor in an election year.  The press want a story that will rival OJ's escapade with the white Bronco. The other patients in the ER want to get their own healthcare issues taken care of.  Hostage negotiator Frank Grimes (Robert Duvall) wants everyone out alive.

""John Q"" is one of the most compelling films I've seen in a long time because the story is entirely real. This is one of Denzel Washington's, James Wood's and Duvall's best performances to date. The story will have you in tears and cheering at points--and hopefully asking some meaningful questions about your own healthcare coverage.

1459617,4,B00005JKWX,"I remember when this movie came out there was a lot of criticism towards it. I can honestly say that the only good things I heard about about it was these positive reviews on Amazon. I was determined to see it and I was finally able to see it. Guess what? It isn't as bad as these critics say it is.

Premise: John Q Archibald's son passes out during a baseball game. Once tooken to the hospital John and his wife find out that their son has an enlarged heart. John goes through great leangths to get money just to get his son's name on the heart donor's list only to get screwed over by the same hospital that was supposed to look out for him. Down on his last luck, John Q holds the whole hospital hostage at gunpoint until his son's medical needs are met.

Opinion: This movie is very touching as well as a sad testament to the issue involving healthcare. Many people bash the movie because they figure that the way John Q handled his son's situation was extreme but if you were in his shoes and handled that situation with passiveness then you deserve to get bullied by these corporate warthogs for being docile! Everybody with the exception of the ham that beats his girl fits into this movie perfectly. Eddie Griffin provided brief moments of levity, James Woods was great as the doctor who had to be forced into comprimising and John Q is one of Denzel's finest performances. The movie has a happy as well as a sad ending but I won't spoil it for those of you who have yet to see it. They say that the message of the movie was hammered onto the audience but in a world full of proud-to-be-stupid people, the only way to get a message so serious across is to beat it into their thick heads. I'll part by saying that not every movie that is critically panned is bad and not every critically acclaimed movie is good. See it for yourself.",1209600000,,1841,4.317919075144508

1459623,5,B00005JKWX,"This film is the pioneer and precursor of Michael More's documentary Sicko recently released, but this one is based on a fictional situation. What is a father ready to do to enable his son to get a heart transplant? And what is the system able to do to prevent him from getting it because he does not have enough insurance coverage? The second question is easy to answer: nothing and the system will let the child die. No insurance coverage, no treatment. The first question is a lot more difficult to answer; the film goes very far in the fiction and yet it is absolutely believable. Yes a father is able to kidnap innocent people and medical personnel to impose a positive solution. Then the rest is pure luck, haphazard chance, good effective media, a lot of human feeling, a mistake done by the shoot-first-ask-questions-second chief of police in his four star uniform, and of course a lot of sympathy from the public which is perfectly understandable when you know 46 millions Americans have no health coverage at all and probably twenty more millions have a partial coverage, i.e. not full coverage or full coverage not all the time. The film is of course very effective emotionally, and it uses some short sequences from the news programs of the 1990s when Hillary Clinton was trying in the name of her husband to convince Congress to pass legislation on the subject and failed. I think even to kill yourself to provide your own son with a heart is an option that could be considered by some fathers. Of course the film did not emphasize the real negative sides of the problem, the greediness of some doctors, the total indifference of most administrative personnel, the brutality of the police in such cases who would consider a forceful solution before a peaceful one. But there must be some dream even when dealing with such a subject.

And believe me, from start to finish he does well in pumping up the suspense as well as making you wonder what will happen next. I think it would be hard for someone not to cry while watching this movie. It really deals with real life medical procedures and even heart-breaking choices. Becuase, after all, if you give a father no choice, sooner or later he'll have to take the rules into his own hands. This movie really inspired me in a big way. It made me want to learn more about the technicalities of the medical field.

1459709,5,B00005JKWX,"Denzel Washington (our title charactor John Q.) and Kimberly Elise play loving parents to Michael Archibald, a young boy who collapses while playing baseball due to heart failure.  Upon being rushed to the hospital for an emergency heart transplant the Archibald's are told that their health insurance does not cover the surgery, and John, already working dead end jobs as a factury worker, can't afford the surgery (their house is about to be repoed as well so he's really down on his luck right now) and so his situation seems hopeless until he takes matters into his own hands and takes the emergency room of the hospital hostage.  Now he's able to make demands of the hospital and the insurance company, demanding they operate on his son.  The end of the film gets very intence, to the point where you're at the edge of your seat and praying something will happen quickly to make things better.  Denzel does an amazing job here, and James Wood and Anne Heche do an outstanding job at making you really really hate them.  Eddie Griffin does what he does best by making you laugh quite a bit and Ray Liotta plays against type...not...by playing a jack@$$.  Anyways, the real heart of this film is not in the 'father will do anything to save his son' route but more in the 'I can't believe that the medical and insurance world is that currupt' and the sobering part is that they are that currupt.  This movie should help to open your eyes to the type of men and women (heartless men and women) who have high office in the places we place our trust.  Medical attention, to me, should be a non-question type item.  If you have a patient who WILL DIE if not given immediate attention, yet his insurance won't cover the surgery...what would you do?  The fact that the question needs to be asked shows how little this society of people gives two $hits about one another.  It should be a no-brainer.  You should perform the surgery.

1459710,3,B00005JKWX,"This movie starts out with much promise only to be disapated by blatant goofiness, and a bad screenplay. First off the movie has a strong start in which Denzil has problems at his factory only getting 20 hours a week, something we all can relate to i'm sure. Things start to get even worse after not being able to make ends meet, with an upset spouse, Denzil's little boy collapses while running between bases at a baseball game. When taken to the hospital they say either his son must have heart transplant surgery or he will die, they become distrot in the fact that the hospital doesnt even seem to care. Then when Denzil finds out his insurance carrier has changed and will only cover 20,000 he has to try and raise the money to fund his childs surgery, a whoping 250,000 dollars. So in the mist of all this he pays the hostpital 6000 dollars to keep his son at the facility, but then finds out they are releasing him the next day.

Now it all begins, he then becomes enraged and takes the he pyshician(played by James Woods)hostage, along with an emergency room filled with nurses and a few patients. This is were things drop down hill. Robert Duvall shows up and talks to John, and i will have to say this is the worst roll i've ever seen Duvall play. He can't do a chicago accent to save his life, and his dialogue is so mish-mashed that he seems to just ""get through"" every line, much the same as Denzil, who really can't make a bad movie in my opinion, but can be given a bad script. The rest of the movie plays out a typical hostage situation, failed attempts to take johns life, tension between the hostages, sneak attacks from them, and oh yes the infamous wife telling her husband to just ""give it up, will be fine"" scenes. All of this is also plagued with some very ""goofy"" yes stupid dialogue between the hostages. All these charactars seem to have fallen out of some low rate made for TV film, because they just can't share the same screen with someone like Denzil, much the same with the outside police squad and Duvall. So yes this could have been a great film given the premise. Healthcare is absurd for the most part, and a lot of uninsured people should have some way to be  treated without having to make payments in full. I will say this i'm not sure HOW true the circumstance are in this movie as far as heart transplantation but i'm sure in reality there would be somewhere they could fly him to, or special circumstances for there situation to ""make payments"" to the hospital. So if you enjoy a decent almost TV film, then you may enjoy this one, other wise watch some of Denzil's finer moments like Training Day or Man On Fire.",1136419200,,2654,4.392276422764228

Running Time:  116 minutes

Rated PG-13 for violence, language and intense thematic elements.

John Quincy Archibald (Denzel Washington) is a down-on-his-luck worker. He's about to be evicted from his home, he doesn't earn enough money, and is soon driven to the point of breaking. While at his son's (Mike) baseball game, the boy is overcome with convulsions andis rushed to a hospital, but his insurance coverage does not cover a heart transplant.  He tries everything he can but can't get the money. He soon takes drastic measures as he takes twenty or so people hostage and takes over the ER at the hospital to get the transplant.  Among the people is Dr. Raymond Turner (James Wood), a man who wishes John luck but can't give his son the transplant. Soon the situation turns into a police stand-off under the command of Lt. Frank Grimes (Robert Duvall) and Chief Gus Munroe (Ray Liotta).  While Grimes wants John to surrender himself, Monroe is prepared to kill John just to end the crisis. As John waits for his son to be put on the donor list, he must take care of all the hurt hostages and keep the police from coming in. When John finds that he has the same blood-type and tissues as Mike, it become clear what he must do.

The audience are firmly on-side as Denzel's final, desperate plea to surgeon James Woods falls on deaf ears, and we understand why he believes the only option now open to him is to hijack the emergency room at Chicago Hope. However, the scenes in which Archibald takes over the hospital fall short of the drama the audience has been wound-up to expect. In some respects, this makes the development more realistic: Denzel doesn't suddenly become Bruce Willis and launch into a mass shoot 'em up; he is an ordinary, decent man, and his hijack is clumsy and somewhat botched: ""John Q"" is clearly out of his depth.  The problem is that director Nick Cassavettes allows the film's momentum to dip irrecoverably during these scenes. There are some confusing moments while we wait for the authorities to work out what's going on and respond accordingly.  This movie isn't like that: you know John isn't going to harm anybody, and moreover, you know his son is going to get a new heart. Worse still, you know, long before the climax of the film, how this is going to be achieved. For, although we've had time to forget about the opening sequence in which a young woman is involved in a car wreck, the same footage is repeated halfway through the story, leaving us in no doubt as to the identity of our donor.  In it closing moments, ""John Q"" keeps its dignity, sending Archibald on a race against time to save his son or perhaps sacrifice himself.  ""John Q"" never hits the dramatic high points we might have hoped for, nor does it tug convincingly on our heart strings, but it is at least a coherent and original movie, albeit one you're likely to forget as soon as you drop it back at the video store.",1135987200,6,3127,4.66
1459712,5,B00005JKWX,"At the height of the HMO arrogance, Corporatized Medicine believed that they could mistreat human beings in the name of the dollar.  I believe, I hope, that their attitude has taken a turn as they realized humanity will not be slapped down.  Stir in the extra emotion of organ donation, in which one must die for another to live, and you have the electric tension of John Q.

John Archibald (Denzel Washington) is a good man, a hard worker, who just needs a little more luck and a few more hours at the slow factory job he holds.  When his son, Mike (Daniel E. Smith) collapses at a baseball game, he is rushed to the hospital where John and his wife Denise (Kimberly Elise) discover that Mike needs a heart transplant, quickly.

But, John's insurance won't cover it.  His company switched his health plan from a PPO to an HMO to save money, and there is no provision for transplantation.  Hospital Director Rebecca Payne (played surprisingly well by Anne Heche) demands Mikey's transplant be treated as a cash account, demanding $75,000 down payment before Mike can even get on the donor list.  (still think the donation process is not dollar driven?)

John tries to raise the money, but time is running out.  In a desperate attempt to save his child, John takes heart surgeon Dr. Raymond Turner (James Woods) hostage, along with the emergency room staff, demanding that his son's name get on the list.

Hostage negotiator Lt. Frank Grimes (Robert Duvall) arrives on the scene, but is hampered by the presence of media-hungry Police Chief Gus Monroe (Ray Liotta).  Also present is Tuck Lampley (Paul Johansson) a television reporter hungry for 'The Story' but who is sympathetic to John's plight.

The film is not action packed, but nonetheless has a palpable tension.  It's a story of humanity, and the interactions between real people.  It's a story about mistakes and redemptions, arrogance and assumptions, and the all too human core inside all of us.

The performances are spectacular.  Denzel Washington, James Woods, Robert Duvall, Ray Liotta, Kimberly Elise, Paul Johansson, and (surprise) Anne Heche do phenomenally good jobs in their roles.  The photography is excellent, the editing, script, and atmosphere are great, and the musical score matches mood with the film.

'John Q.' is one of those movies I can watch over and over again, and still feel the same emotion I felt the first time I watched it.  Though the ending does have some unrealistic qualities, it fits well with the film and doesn't skip over the wrongs that John did to try and make things right for his son.  Definitely a 'buy'.

1459713,3,B00005JKWX,"Denzel Washington's powerful performance dominates this drama about a father fighting to keep his son alive.  Many critics panned ""John Q"" upon its release, and to some extent, I agree with them.  There are so many cliches in it that it often seems like a knock-off of other movies like ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and ""Mad City.""  Robert Duvall, while a great actor, comes off like a characature of a cop, while Ray Liotta, also a terrific performer, is equally cartoonish as his adversary.  Naturally, the news reporters turn the whole hostage situation into a media circus with a preachy message about the sorry state of our healthcare system.  We've seen all this before in many other movies, and it didn't work in them either.  The plot also takes predictable turns all the way to the end.

The main reason to watch is for Denzel Washington.  His likability goes a long way; he really does make you care about him and his family.  Because of him, I can still enjoy watching this film and forgive many of its shortcomings.  And the DVD is loaded with many nice features, including deleted scenes and commentary with director Nick Cassavetes, writer James Kearns, and actress Kimberly Elise, who plays Washington's wife in the movie.",1131926400,,1228,4.804761904761905
1459714,5,B00005JKWX,"John Q is one of my favorite Denzel Washington movies. Denzel Washington is in my opinion one the best actors ever. He's so powerful with his expressions, movements, tones, and sentences.

This movie is a beautiful movie that is very sad and remarquable. It's about a factory worker played by Denzel Washington who has a nice loving wife and son. And then one day, while playing baseball, his young son collapses. They take him to the hospital and find out that he'll die if he doesn't get a heart transplant, a highly costly operation. And to make matters worse, the factory worker's (named Jonh Archibald) insurance won't cover it. And since they can't afford it, John Archibald is forced to desperate measures. He holds up the hospital, locking himself in. He then orders for his son to get a transplant. The movie is very toughing and wondeful with great perfromances by Denzel Washington, James Woods, Robert Duvall and Ray Liotta. While in the hospital, John meets new people that are also trapped in. He meets a married couple with the wife pregnant, a spanish mother whose baby is sick, a weird couple with a hurt lady, a security cop and more. The movie is a great ride and will make you cheer and cry. While everyone in the hospital and out loves John, the government doesn't. And they send snipers and more to get the job done.

1459822,3,B00005JKWX,"John Q. is an emotional thriller that definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat... at times as a tear jerker, but at other times laughing at the ridiculous directing, scriptwriting and sometimes acting... There are some scenes you can see coming from a mile away, ridiculous melodramatics... and a blatantly (yet superficial) propagandic message...

Wow, when was the last time YOU got to walk into a TV studio and TELL your story to the investigative reporter on the set ?  - - and oh yes... JOHN Q's bearded blue collar friend was - - well, quite Blue Collar... Duval pretty much played the same cheerfully cynical rational minded cop he did in a similar victim of society gone lunatic film (Falling DOwn), there's the cold hard hospital administrator, the jerky self righteous doctor, narcisistic chief of police against the gung-ho local cops vs. the trigger happy sharp shooters... ""I got da mayor on the line...""  - - ""Tell 'em to hold back !  hold back !  Don't shoot til I tell you...""  - - ""I love you Daddy !""  and oh how the list goes on.  - - James Wood, a GREAT actor  almost seems to realize the sillyness of the film during the DRAMATIC change of heart sequence which seems something straight out of a Saturday night live spoof... ""But doctor, you could get disbarred or lose your license,"" and Wood answers something in a ridiculously flat tone as if he's really trying to say, ""Oh God, when am I going to get off this set...?"" and then there are all the other great classic Hollywood (ridiculously unbelievable) close calls with sharp shooters, loaded guns, calls that don't get through at the last moment... People running desperate AGAINST TIME (cue dramatic incidental music...)  In the end, as a message film, it falls flat... I mean, preaching to the choir is one thing (we ALL agree the health care system is messed up and we've all heard the figures and hey, yeah, let's go and fill out our organ donor cards, brush our teeth twice a day and eat our spinach), but beyond preaching to the choir, it doesn't really offer any other deeper insight or sparker debate beyond, ""oh how cute and little the Webster like little Kid is..."" and maybe making you think ""What if it were my son ?""  Heck yea, I might do it...  So how abotu a dramatic TRIAL OF BILLY JACK type ending where Duvall says that you have a choice ""Die here, or tell your story in court to the world...""  -- Uh, uh... we can shoot you or you can go to jail... make your choice...  In the meantime, the film just goes ridiculously overboard to touch everybody, offend nobody, and play into the mindset of an Oprah Winfrey Audience, with yet, a touch of an ABC Afterschool Special with a few jarring moments (such as the SFX on a realistic but overdramatized heart surgery.)  This film would have been great paradied on STRANGERS WITH CANDY !  - - No doubt however, one should mention that Denzil Washington did put on a heck of a performance, letting the waterworks through on virtually every scene and playing a not so bright average Joe that everybody loves, just wants to save his son and has commanded a hospital ward full of... well the morbidly obese body guard, the scared sh*tless nurse, the wise *ss pimp and his girlfriend, the witty street smart black guy, and the lady about to have a baby any moment...  in other words, ample comedic relief... and yes, you can smell that they're going to bond from miles a way...  and as the hostage situation plays out all the elements and cliches from all the other films of that nature play out... minus the Billy Jack clenched fist salutes as he rides off into the sunset...  - - Still despite this, the film did keep me glued to my seat and was a fun and exciting watch...  Perhaps one day it might even be made in a more coherent manner and not try to create the ultimate feel good/feel bad/human message/police stand off/ triumph of human nature blah blah blah film.  In the meantime, I think I'm going to go outside and breath a fresh of air and try to remember some of the more poignant lines.

Thus John (Denzel Washington) does the only thing he can think of: he holds the emergency room hostage, and even intends to commit suicide to allow his heart to be transplanted into his son.

The acting is superb. In addition to Washington, the cast includes Robert Duvall as a police negotiator and James Woods as a heart surgeon, both of whom do an excellent job. Anne Heche as a hospital administrator is good, while Ray Liotta's portrayal of the cheif of police can be questionable at times. The only bad acting, in my opinion, is done by the man who portrays the newscaster; he seems very over-the-top and cheesy.

The dialogue is well-written, and you can judge for yourself on how realistic the premise is.

What caused me to give the film 4 stars instead of five (and even came close to bringing it to 3) is the preaching about the sorry state of America's healthcare system in the penultimate segments, with leftists such as Hilary Clinton and (if I recall correctly) Jesse Jackson giving speeches about how America needs more socialism in not so few words. In doing this they alienate a large portion of the potential audience. Without it, a veiwer could draw what conclusions he feels are appropriate; perhaps just a portrait of a father's love for his son, rather than a call for socialism.

It is also surprising that two of the few conservative actors in Hollywood -- Duvall and Woods -- and others who, as far as I know, tend to keep their views on politics to themselves would star in a film that comes close to left-wing propaganda toward the end.

The plot was very unrealistic with the free care, welfare, and other hospital-assisted funding programs out there.

What do you do when you're faced with a catastrophic illness and have no medical coverage?  It's a question that many in this country face everyday.  Washington as Q is pushed to the breaking point and makes some decisions that bring dire consequences upon himself.  His son has a bad heart and needs a transplant.  He loses his job and sells almost everything he owns to pay for his son's hospitalization.  While the film does demonize the hospital staff and the police department by putting them in the role of the bad guy, there are some truths that must be faced.  Who should pay when you can't?  Should doctors donate their time to every hard luck case?

While a bit preachy about the health care situation, the movie makes its point for Washington's case.  The life of a little boy is certainly more important than bureaucratic red tape, and hospital hierarchy.  Washington is supported by a fine cast:  Kimberly Elise as his devoted wife; James Woods as the heart surgeon who undergoes a change of heart; Shawn Hotosy as an ER hostage with his own problems; Robert Duvall as the crusty police negotiator; Ray Liotta as the egotistical chief of police; David Thornton as Denzel's friend Jimmy; and Anne Heche as the apparently coldhearted hospital administrator.

James Woods plays the evil dude once again, and tells John he needs to pay 250k, but unfortunately John is not insured and cannot pay it, and his son will die. So, the rational explanation is obviously to hijack the ER and hold everyone hostage until they put his son on the transplant list. Robert Duvall plays the police negotiator, who you snense feels almost sorry for John, but Ray Liotta comes in and plays mr. steelballs ordering someone to snipe John.

failings of a health-care system that covers about 85% of the population, this movie is eerily similar to the ""Socialist realism"" that passed for art in the Soviet Union before it collapsed.  Even worse, after the ridiculous melodrama has passed, the movie subjects viewers to a a parade of (empty)

talking heads like Hillary Clinton and Gloria Allred bleating about how we need universal (in other words, socialist) health care in this country.  Apparently since Marxist ideas have worked so well in Poland, China, and Cuba, it's high time we tried them here.  I think these peoples' attitudes were best exemplified by the quote from Bill Maher, who said something to

the effect of ""We could have national health care, but we don't want our taxes raised.""  Gee, if people don't want national health care, is the government supposed to force it on them at gunpoint?  (Probably).  Maybe people figure they're already paying enough in taxes, and don't really feel like paying even more so the government can give to some people what most of

Maybe they are single, healthy and never get to go to the Dr., and are not aware of the pathetic state of health care of America.
I've had to deal myself since my son was born. My son has Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa. His skin basically falls apart at the slightest touch. It is awful, brutal (see some clinical pics at my website, silviaskingdom.com). The only treatment that my son has is basically take care of the wounds, which cover, at times, as much as 60-75% of his body. Some of these wounds are chronic and take months to heal. Taking care of wounds is vital because if a bad infection occurs, my son could die. Infection is the number one killer of persons diagnosed with my son's condition. You would think that insurance companies would cover the medical supplies, the ointments, the bandages and everything involved in taking care of the wounds, but the reality is, the vast majority of HMOs do not. They don't because bandages and related products to care for wounds are 'over the counter', hence not covered under insurances.
Sounds crazy? It is. And there is nothing I can do about it. Some states, if the income is low enough, provide some services that include coverage for bandages, and that is what fortunately is saving us, because I could never afford to pay the tens of thousands of dollars it takes each year just to purchase the various skin care products my son needs. I know what you're thinking... there is no way bandages cost that much! Yes they do actually... for example: an 8x10 sheet of Mepitel for deep wound coverage is $40. A roll of 1"" gauze to bandage my son's hand is $1, and he goes through 4-6 of those per week, and that is just on his hands!
It gets crazier... the various HMOs that we've had over the years have also denied to have my son seen by specialists too because they were 'out of network'. Of course they are out of network, my son's condition is one in a million, we can't expect to see a 'specialist' on this condition in every corner of the country, are we?
I know what you're thinking... it's all my fault, yeah, the evil HMOs -- how dare they actually have the audacity to enforce the contracts people choose to purchase! Choose to purchase? I never had that choice. I never had the choice to choose between HMOs, let alone even have the opportunity to get PPOs. Medical care won't be legitimate in this country until we stop seeing ten-dollar boxes of Kleenex on the bills. Everyone gasps when I tell them how much my son's power chair cost... yes, $7,000, and there is no way it's worth that much.

1459909,3,B00005JKWX,"Do you have health insurance?  If the answer is ""Why no, Roman, I don't believe I do,"" then you really need to check out JOHN Q.
JOHN Q, a drama starring Denzel Washington as a father who takes matters into his own hands when his insurance won't foot the bill on a new heart for his dying son, has all the elements of a great drama except one - it tries desperately, but miserably fails to really keep you guessing.
Basic synopsis:  Washington stars as John Q. Archibald, the kind of fellow who can't seem to get a break.  However, his family life, while not full of monetary riches, is full of the heart-felt kind.  And, when it comes to heart, no one surpasses his son, whose heart turns out to be three times too large.  After young Mike Arhibald passes out on the baseball field (thunk!), doctors book him for a brief stay on the planet without a normal-sized heart, which his insurance won't pay for.  The doctors and hospital administrators don't seem too sympathetic and old John Q just can't raise enough to money to fix the situation.  So, in the dark of night, by the light of the full moon, he jumps the fence of a nearby pet cemetery and steals the heart of a pig in a desperate attempt to save his only son.  O.k., that last part isn't true.  I made it up.  But, things do get nutty when John Q takes over the ER at gunpoint, demanding his son be placed at the top of the donor list.
The Cast:  Denzel Washington (HURRICANE; GLORY) does an excellent job in any role he takes on.  He can be an ex-slave soldier with no real heart, a boxer with all heart, or a daddy whose kid has too much heart.  His part as John Q is no exception.  He does a great job of looking flustered and scared yet determined throughout the crisis, like a real father would.
Robert Duvall (APOCOLYPSE NOW; FALLING DOWN) is no Samuel L. Jackson (THE NEGOTIATOR), but he still does a fantastic job as the ""good cop/negotiator"" in this crime caper.  He's the police officer who does things for the ""right reason.""
  Anne Heche (SIX DAYS SEVEN NIGHTS; RETURN TO PARADISE) is insensitive and cold.  But, hospital administrators have to be.  Do you have any idea how many sick people they see every day?  Don't you think they might get just a little numb to tears?  Still, you will hate her in a very healthy way.
  James Woods (ANY GIVEN SUNDAY; THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER), once again, lives up to his name as one of the best supporting actors of all time.  This guy knows exactly when to push his dramatic expertise over the edge.  His ""didn't you ever have a dream"" speech in ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is a prime example.  While you really don't get too much of that in John Q, he keeps the emotion flowing.
  Kimberly Elise (BELOVED) grows on you as the momma, but she cries so dang much it makes me want to shoot myself.
My take on the film:  While JOHN Q may not have been the most-shocking movie of late, it was everything I thought it would be, which can be both good and bad.
  It had plenty of drama and great acting on the part of Washington.  That was great.
  It was full of unique camera angles, music that really clicked, and casting that can't be beat. Also a big plus.
  However, all the health insurance ranting was not what I wanted to hear about.  I wanted to see a drama where a daddy takes care of his boy and refuses to let the world and all its nonsensical rules stand in its way.
  Also, there were parts of this movie that no one, not even a pawn shop owner, would buy.  I don't want to give anything away, but I hope the cops and judicial system don't handle a real incident the way they do in JOHN Q.
  Overall though, it was a fairly good film.

I was truly amazed at how choppy, awkward, and just plain stupid the lines are. The seem so random and inappropriate that at times I laughed. There is absolutely no sense of despair - the audience quite frankly yawns. Did the director want the audience to feel the internal struggle Dr. James Woods has - wether to operate or not? What was the point of having that annoying guy who hit his wife? To take attention away from a supposed HOSTAGE SITUATION!!!! HELLO??!?!?! This is like SONY'S MY FIRST FILM. We have another supposedly dramatic struggle between the veteran Duval and the flashy new chief, Ray Liotta - is this what passes for character development????

1459977,2,B00005JKWX,"This movie has an interesting premise but unfortunately falls into the traps of most mainstream movies out there. Denzel Washingston`s character threatens some peolpe`s lives and makes them hostages in an emergency room of a Chicago hospital. By doing so, he hopes that his ill soon will get an heart transplant since his health care can`t cover it. This will lead to a troublesome situation that gets the attention from the media and leaves the country in suspense. But John Q is, after all, just a nice guy that loves his son and will sacrifice himsfelf to save him if required.
Director Nick Cassavetes brings food for thought and raises questions about the health care system, heroism, altruism, individualism, relationships and media power, but the plot isn`t particularly clever or subtle. The story here follows the more obvious, predictable and basic approach, typical of an average hollywood movie.
Despite a couple of good ideas and moments, this soon turns into cheap, unoriginal and tired melodrama with stereotyped characters and a set of old cliches. The ending comes out as completely expected and unsurprising.

1459978,4,B00005JKWX,"This is one of the most heart-wrenching movies I've ever seen. You really identify with Denzel Washington, and a couple of the other characters. I first saw this film at the cinema on the 1st May 2002, and it's one of those meaningful dates/films in my life, for different reasons. I'll always remember this film for those reasons.
The very start of the film won't make sense - but keep watching, believe me, you'll figure it out long before anything actually happens.
I wouldn't have chosen any other actor to play Denzel Washington's character. He played the part well, whether crying about his son, or threatening to kill himself, just so his son could have a heart. He really throws himself into the film totally, and the other actors support him totally - except Anne Heche, who is just expressionless throughout.
Re-watching this movie, a year and a half afterwards, it had a different effect on me, and it almost seems to be based on a true-life story. Especially right in the last shot, when you see ""for Sasha"". It may have certain elements from true life, as all films do, but I was very surprised NOT to see ""based on true life"" on the cover or during the film credits.
The lovely Shawn Hatosy also stars in this, looking very nice all dressed in black, and much sexier with darker hair. (He's starred in another of my fave films, Down To You). Robert Duvall is also great, although he's played this type of character so often; you don't really notice him.
The little kid (who's name I forget) was just unbelievable in this. He played the part so well, although he spent the best part of it in bed! Along with his screen dad, they were the best characters in this movie.
This is definitely a surprising movie, and I'm pleased to own this on DVD. You'll definitely need some tissues, especially when Denzel Washington starts crying!",1074038400,2,1842,4.6189024390243905
1459979,1,B00005JKWX,"John Q. has several problems.  You watch the movie and you wonder, ""How did they get all these actors to do such a crummy movie?""  It was a question that boggled many but was finally answered upon seeing the entireity of the movie.  Everyone involved knew what they wanted and cared about the message, but could not even fathom the terrible mess it would become.  When sitting down to write the script, I'm sure the idea of health insurance and it's wrongful ways would make a good movie with an overwhelming message to let people know that they are not the only ones who think the health insurance plans are ridiculous and downright awful at times.  When I first saw the trailer, I was impressed that a movie was going to touch on a subject that has battled with many americans throughout their lives.  I was excited to finally see this movie and hear what they had to say.  Did I get the message?  Yes, I did, but not like I wanted it.  The message was there, but the problem was it was completely succumbed by the horrible script and at times the unfinished arguments.  I have never heard so many awful lines in a movie.  Every saying felt unrealistic as well as ridiculous.  The makers beat the audience over the head with the message so many times you almost want to rebel against it.  It is completely over-the-top in religious christianity.  There were so many stupid lines trying to make a point in the direction of christianity but came off as so pointless causing the viewer to be turned off.  During the hospital scene, the hostages would constantly argue with one another bringing up pretty good discussion topics to why America and the systems we have are they way they are.  But once again, this was unfortunatley messed up.  A discussion topic would always be brought up but never concluded.  It was terribly unsatisfying to see this and made the viewer want to say, ""What's the point of bringing these discussions up if they are never answered and have nothing to do with the movie?""  It's another cheap shortcut in hollywood to take up time between the main plot in the movie.  The makers of the film, as well as the actors, obviously wanted to touch the hearts of audiences with it's message on health care.  It's a great topic and I believe this could have been a really great film, but as the film makers now know, as well as the audience, you can't have a great topic with great acting surrounded by a lousy script and plot.  For it's because of these things the message was drowned causing a once thoughtful idea, into a complete laughable mess.",1072915200,11,2567,4.534782608695652

1459982,3,B00005JKWX,"It is not often one encounters a mainstream Hollywood movie with an overtly liberal agenda and it is its attack on the American public health sysytem that is by far the most interesting thing about this  re-run of Dog Day Afternoon  in which a hospital stands in for a bank as the buildinh being held up.
John Q Archibald is a hard working factory worker on part time and feeling the economic pinch as he can only stand by as his wife's car is repossesssed owing to missed payments. The marriage is under strain and his world collapses totally when his son collapses and is diagnosed with an overly large heart which needs to be transplanted or else death is imminent. The problem is finance -he turns out to be underinsured and despite major endeavours he is still sdhort of the sum required when the hospital transfer him to the county hospital with its lower standards of medical care.
Result? He bursts into the hospital and takes a number of medical staff and emergency patients to draw attention to his plight and force the hospital to traet his son.
The police negotiator -Robert Duvall -tries to end the siege peacefully in the glare of media scrutiny ,handicapped by the publicity seeking police chief -Ray Liotta ,and the cynical money conscious hospital administrator -Anne Heche
The siege sequences are standard by the numbers big Hollywood movie making but the acting is strong enough to carry the viewer through some over familiar dialogue and situations but the barbed references to medical cynicism and the plight of the economically disadvantaged keep the movie alive and out of the mundane.
Providing you don't mind some emotionally manipulative scenes towards the climax this is good and provocative movie making that asks some pertinent questions about just how long we should tolerate the situation wherby
inequalities in wealth lead inexorably to gross inequalities in health .

1460063,4,B00005JKWX,"""John Q"" is surely too melodramatic even though it treats one of the most important social issues, namely, current medical insurance system in USA.  The characters, save for the main one, need lots of polishing, and the over-the-top finale is too good to be true.  But the film is still a great audience pleaser -- if you are a kind of audience who can ignore the holes in the plot -- and it is certain that Denzel Washington acquired new fans after the release of the film.
John Quincey Archibols is a family man, working at a local factory where his hours are cut, and whose car is repossessed.  Still, he is a loving father, whose son Michael, however, collapses during the baseball game, and is brought to hospital.  John Q is told by the hospital executives James Woods and Anne Heche that he has to prepare $ 250,000 to have an operation for heart transplanting for his son.  Without that, Michael is certain to die within months.  But the insurance, for the reasons you should see for yourself on screen, does not give any more than $ 20,000 ceiling.  The time limit for payment gets closer, and the hospital even suggests that his son leave the place when John and his friends are desperately collecting the money, which is far short of the amount they need.
Told over phone by his wife ""to do something,"" John takes a literal course to do something -- to take over the hospital with a gun, taking hostages and requiring that his son's name should be put on the top of the waiting list.
You might find the story ethically dubious (and I did, too) but soon find that Washington's performance as distraught father compels you to (almost) forget that point.  The story is oversimplified and melodramatic, but it successfully conveys the father's feelings towards his son, and as such it manages to engage us.  The good pace of the film also makes you forgive the fact that the script is too contrived (though I don't say impossible), and that there are some stock characters such as veteran hostage negotiator and power-hungry police representive, played by Rovert Duvall and Ray Liotta respectively.
The original script was written in 1993 when ""Die Hard"" style action flicks are in vogue, and the finished script of ""John Q"" clearly shows that fact.  There are satire about media circus, conversations over radio, etc., but director Nick Cassavetes keeps good pace with stirring direction and some occassional references to modern US insurance systems.  Though the film seems to touch these social issues too casually, it is still worthwhile to know these things, some of which are simply surprising for, like me, those who are not living in America.
You may think that Nick Cassavetes, now both as actor (""Face/Off"") and as director (""Unhook the Stars"" which incidentally features his mother Gena ""Gloria Rowlands"") is not the right choice for the film.  The fact is, however, he did a good job, helped greatly by Washington's towering presence.  But you cannot and hsould not seek for profound insights or messages here.  It is nothing but a crowd pleaser -- and a good one at that, but we know the subject matter needs more subtle handling.",1064880000,2,3150,4.755963302752294
1460064,2,B00005JKWX,"I delayed watching this movie from the simple fact that the previews gave me the impression that this was a ""squashed squirrel."" There are two ways to elicit emotion: 1) provide a cliche device, such as a squashed squirrel (who won't go ""awwww"" when seeing a small animal hurt?), or 2) earn your audience emotions by providing them with honest writing and believable situations. Unfortunately, John Q goes for the easy cliche almost every time.
Denzel Washington is an excellent actor and try as he might, he simply can't escape from the script. At every turn he's handed another maudlin easy out. And that's really a shame because the topic addresses some fairly tough questions. There was real opportunity to provide a rich story filled with interesting dialog regarding the U.S healthcare system. Instead we're presented with stereotypes of the ""rich doctor,"" the ""mean hospital administrator"" and the ""gung ho cop."" Been there, done that and I didn't care to see it the first time.
Major talent is wasted as well. Robert Duvall's character, Lt. Frank Grimes, doesn't have enough material to even be effective as cast member. At the end of the movie, I was left wondering why we even needed his character - he had no arc and provided no real insight to the drama. Duvall is a fantastic character actor and he's given nothing to work with.
The rest of the cast is mostly a mixed bag of good and bad. All Kimberly Elise can do is play anger as Denise Archibald, John's wife. Her performance was disappointing since her character had the most to work with. James Woods and Anne Heche can likewise do little in their roles than play the stereotypes that they've been given. However Eddie Griffin did standout as one of the more honest characters as Lester Matthews, one of the hostages. Granted, his role didn't require much of a stretch, but it was a breath of fresh air and one of the few redeeming elements of the movie.
The bottom line is that James Kearns, the writer and co-producer, simply provided nothing but a sow's ear to the cast and no amount of magic was going to turn it into a silk purse. Kearns' work may have been appropriate for ""Jake and the Fatman"", or ""Highway to Heaven"", (he wrote for both TV series), but it simply wasn't up to snuff for the cadre of talent on the playbill.",1063929600,4,2298,4.648648648648648

1460066,4,B00005JKWX,"When I found out Denzel Washington starred in this movie, I knew I just had to see it as he is by far my favorite actor.
A touching but funny movie about a man who has a kid with a heart growing larger than it should. During a baseball game, his kid collapses and they quickly take him to hospital. Little does John. Q know what lies ahead when they take his kid to the hospital. First off they would have to pay $10,000 for his son to get an operation and what makes matters worse is that they don't have the kind of money nor do they have insurance so really they're lying the lane of death for their son.
The first half of the movie is so powerful and emotional as matters gets saddening. It really would be the pits to have your son dying and you don't have the money to get him or her to get the only chance to save him or her. But the most unexpected thing comes to place after the movie moves on.
John. Q decides to hold the hospital and the people in it hostage until he gets what he wants -- the operation for his kids. For hours and hours, police try to figure a way to get into the hospital and surround him but John. Q always has something for them. As time goes by, the hostages begin to know John. Q a little better and soon begin to like him. It becomes funny when John. Q lets a woman out and she gets interviewed by a reporter. She tells the reporter that John. Q is a nice guy and wished she was back in there as a hostage!
In the end, you'll find out that John. Q is about to give up his life for his son's but is luckily saved by his wife when the people decide to give Q's son the operation. After his son is fixed finally, John. Q would have to go to prison for holding the people inside the hospital hostage. This movie is such a great film because it stars Denzel Washington. You'll always know that any movie with Denzel Washington in it will be great because he puts so much effort into the movies he stars in. John Q is a sad but funny movie.

1460069,5,B00005JKWX,"""John Q"" is an extremely powerful film filled with emotion and drama. The story revolves around John Quincy Archibald and his quest to receive proper medical care for his young son. His son collapsed suddenly during a baseball game due to the enlargement of his heart.

John then decides to take desperate measures and hold an emergency room hostage until his son's name is placed on the list.
This film is saturated with deep emotion. John is not only willing to sacrifice his freedom by holding people hostage, but there's also another sacrifice he's willing to make towards the end of the film that will leave you speechless and will most likely bring a tear to your eye.
Denzel Washington, Kimberly Elise, James Woods, and Anne Heche give excellent performances. Anne Heche is so convincing that you truly hate her character throughout most of the film.

Because when they get you to sign forms
they treat you like a king and when it comes to make the claims
they treat you like a criminal regardless the proofs you offer.
And the bad one was : to keep hostages inside a hospital wasn't such a good thing to show - I'm sure that in a democratic U.S.A there are heaps more options before deciding on that one.
Anyways, John Q is a factory worker. He has a cloud above his life that rains unhappiness after unhappiness. He's facing financial problems as the work hours have been reduced for him.
His car get's repossessed. Can't get any worst than this he thought just until he realised that it can get worster than all of his misfortunes put together.

John, so confident (and so ignorant) that his insurance will cover Michael's surgeroy comes to know to his surprise and shock that his employer changed his insurance from PPO to HMO. Though the hospital admits Michael on emergency could not continue his medication owing to the high expense involved. Poor John runs out of options before taking the gun to get life for his son.
For me, the movie lacks the objective. Will gun be the answer for all? Though John's character is portrayed as a common man, he should have consulted an attorney to tackle the insurance issue why the insurance was changed without his knowledge. (His conversation with his employer weakens the objective) Instead the system is blamed, the doctors are deemed bad and so on. John's thoughts and deeds were more emotional than logical. For this reason the movie was a slack many a time.
But Denzel Washington gives a splendid performance as John Q, the emotional father. He proves again that he is worth the Oscar. Nice that his actual son played the role of Michael.

The entire movie is contrived to spread the message that we need socialized medicine.  The problem is that they do not try to challenge your mind, making you think they might be on to something or pose any real facts that support their beliefs.  No they simply preach to us ""ignorant"" folk, through a series of over the top exaggerations of healthcare woes, and pull at our heart so we feel bad for not accepting Hilarycare years ago.  They even quote Bill Maher in that respect.
Everything is this movie is contrived and everyone except John Q is vapid and one dimensional.  Doctors are greedy, poor are righteous and life is black and white with the haves and the have nots. Health care suffers because of greed by insurance companies, your job and medical staff, not because of consumers demanding so much as well.  This movie is an infomercial for an agenda, with nothing from the opposing view whatsoever.
They push socialized medicine as a pancea, but do they show Canadians travelling to our country for better medical care?  Do they talk about how countries with socialized systems often do not get the services they need nearby or at all as they are simply not available?  What good is free healthcare if no one offers the service you need?  Do they mention medical saving account,? quality of services or the impact on taxes and our economy? Non of these issues is even remotely touched upon.
This movie could have been so good, with such a great cast, if they had just been a more honest and real about the situation and less preachy.  Denzel is great as always and I tried to empathize, but I also felt like a republican at the Wellstone memorial.

It could have, but it didn't. Instead it manipulates the audience into feeling emotional about these characters. The hostages soon take John Q's side, criticizing the cardio doctor present (James Woods), and go into conversations discussing health care. The film here strangely sounds like propaganda rather then truth. The doctors are all made out as the bad guys, and the general public as one roots for the underdog John Q. There are no shades of gray here, just a black and white portrayal of a complicated issue. And that's a dangerous route to go because the average filmgoer isn't always able to discern the difference between a good film and one that manipulates them into thinking its good in order to spread its one-sided argument.
The film further degrades itself by adding jokey one-liners straight out of an Adam Sandler film, complete with stereotypical racial jokes. I couldn't believe the producers thought it was a good idea. But what's worse is the corny dialogue that's supposed to be moving but is only laughable. It tries way too hard to be clever and emotional and only succeeds in becoming embarrassingly terrible.
And with such a great cast, which includes Ray Liotta and Robert Duvall, the acting is as good as it can be with what they have to work with. They must be as disappointed in the finished product as much of the public is, because they all had good intentions to create an important film.
In some ways, this movie would almost qualify as a guilty pleasure, but the reduction of such an important issue into propaganda-type smaltz is offensive. If you're a smart film-goer, you'll see beyond the surface of John Q for the film it is, and for the film it could have been.",1037664000,2,2538,4.810068649885584

After getting the run around due to a lack of adequate healthcare, he does what any normal and loving parent would do.

It is a riveting story about a man who risks everything to challenge the healthcare system that aimed to push him aside. The movie touches on the growing problem that our country is facing in regards to proper healthcare. I was personally moved, however, by the ""spiritual"" typology displayed through Denzel's character. John Q was prepared to die so that his son could live...

1460290,1,B00005JKWX,"I knew going in that this would be another ""we need socialized healthcare"" type movie but I really like Denzel Washington and James Woods.  Yes it's easy for Hollywood elites earning 8 - 15 million per picture to think that socialized medicine is a great idea.  Luckily these idiots only have to make movies that portray their view in a utopian world where they all wear rose colored glasses.  These bozo's would never have to live with the socialized system but you would so before you go running off and whining to your congressman about Clintonized health care educate yourself on some economics and history.
Denzel puts in another wonderful performance.  He is great at changing emotions and bringing his character out so you can empathize with him.  He is just a great performer.  I have always loved Woods' work and this performance was equally as wonderful to take in.  Duvall plays the same police officer as he did in ""Falling Down"" but it's a good character.  Ray Liota is fine as the politicized police chief making sure things `turn out okay' as it just happens to be election time etc.
So we get a lot of great performances but it's all washed away in the end.  Instead of the enjoyable ending we get to see all of the holly libs and top democrats getting their free airtime ""commercials"" on the celluloid much like Steven Segal's shameless tirade at the end of ""On Dangerous Ground"" where after using half of the northern hemisphere's gasoline making his dumb movie he goes after Evil Big Oil like they're the anti-Christ but they sure made his movie better and the explosions bigger.

1460294,3,B00005JKWX,"Denzel, what happened buddy?
I saw Denzel on Oprah just before the release of ""John Q"" speaking about his upcoming movie.  It sounded dashing, heartwarming, and daring. The trailers gave me the same feeling.
""John Q"" is all the things I have described...at least for 45 minutes.  Denzel and the true heartbreaking tale of a father who gets shuffled through HMO LALA land and his desperate paternal outreach to save his son's life. The movie works to a point.
It's a good formula...Father loves son, son is ill and needs a transplant...father will do anything for the son.  But what happened?  Once John Q, (Washington)  decides to hold a hospital hostage to get his demand met...we are bombarded with ridiculousness.  There just HAS to be a pregnant woman about to give birth...a thief, a guard, and a wife beater.  These are our main characters?  John Q's hostages are so annoyingly sereotyped it makes you belt out ""Come On!"" sporadically throughout the movie.
On the brighter side...Denzel's performance is believable, real, and at moments so sensitive I couldn't help but be a part of the movie.  I could feel his anger and pain.  It's hard to believe this IS the same man from ""Training Day"".  Without all the hooplah over the ""characters"" being held hostage and parts of the movie sounding like a documentary about the horrors of HMO'S, this movie would have succeeded.

True, this film is simply an eye-opener. It does not offer any solution to the HMO loopholes; but being an eye opener, it presents us the issues at hand & hopefully we are able to address these matters correctly at the soonest possible time.
May I say that the perofrmance of our actors are excellent.  Denzel W. is unbelievably real!  Robert Duvall portrayed his character well --- that of an able but still sympathetic negotiator. I give everyone a 'thumbs up' sign except for Anne Heche who failed to draw a clear transition from the hard core profiteer to a charitable person.  That scene in the hospital room between Heche, Duvall & Elise was critical in establishing her character shift but I believe she fell short in delivering.
Enjoyable is not the right word to describe this film.  It's simply sad to note John Q's plight & to think that it actually happens in real life is doubly sad.  I say, it's a good film --- one with a heart.",1029801600,,1069,4.518134715025907
1460362,4,B00005JKWX,"John Q deals with the plight of a couple whose only child needs a heart transplant.  The premise alone is the stuff that parent's nightmares are made of.  When the couple is told that they have no insurance coverage for this, because their insurance has been downgraded without their knowledge,  they do everything possible to raise the quarter of a million dollars needed for the transplant.  Appealing to the insurance company, filing for assistance from government aid organizations, selling all of their possesions, and the fundraising efforts of their community all fail to produce enough cash.  John's wife calls from the hospital with the news that their son is being released, that is, he is being sent home to die.  His wife demands that he does something.  So, John takes over a hospital emergency room, his only demand is that his son be placed on the list to recieve a heart.
Ok, so the movie gets predicatable.  John does a little freaking out, wins over the sympathies of his hostages and the news watching public, there is a bad cop and a good cop, and of course we are treated to a vain, exploitative TV news anchorman.  We are even forced to watch a little ""Universal Health Care"" propaganda near the end of the movie.  I even have to agree that the charges of some characters being stereo typical is true.  You know what?  I don't care.
The entire movie is emotionally compelling.  The story is quite believable, if not so much in the exact details of whether or not someone would be denied a transplant (some have claimed this would never happen, I personally believe that it can and does happen), then in the hell of paperwork and scheming that patients are put through by their healthcare organizations and governmental agencys.
The acting in this movie is absolutely superb.  Denzel Washington is at the top of his game and gives a commanding and believable performance.  I especially like when he was fumbling with the gun.  An ordinary father isn't going to be experienced at pulling a gun out of his trousers!  What an excellent touch!  Robert Duval and James Wood give their usual polished performances.  Ray Liotta is ok, if a little plastic.  Even the secondary characters, such as the video tech and the hostages were quite good.

This is a horrible script with vapid dialogue and a bleeding heart so big that it is this film that needs a transplant; a brain transplant.  Films trying to make a political point (in this case an emotional appeal for National Health Care) are usually deft enough to bury the message in the subtext.  This one oversimplifies the issue, preaches unabashedly and even sends a parade of lefties to bang the drum and spew liberal pap all over the screen.  Films like this never seem to have trouble finding backers, but at least give us some semi-intelligent interchanges and believable scenes.
Director Nick Cassavetes seems oblivious to the fact that the film is cartoonish, as he lets inane drivel attempt to pass as serious dialogue.  With the exception of John Q, most of the other characters are cardboard cutouts of you favorite stereotype action figures.  We have the cold heartless hospital administrator (Anne Heche), the arrogant doctor (James Wood), the good hearted but dopey factory worker (David Thornton), the grandstanding police chief (Ray Liotta) and the street wise career cop (Robert Duvall).
The story is totally predictable, telegraphing the outcome in the first three minutes.  Cassavetes seems content with TV level production values and milks the screenplay for every ounce of sympathy it can muster.  This is the most shameless emotional manipulation that one could imagine.
There is a considerable amount of talent that flounders attempting to prop this film up.  Denzel Washington gives a good performance with one of the few characters in the film that is close to believable.  He makes John a very noble and respectable character with a warm heart and an iron will.  Kimberly Elise is also credible as his wife, and Daniel E. Smith is lovable as his son.
The rest of the cast should hide in shame.  James Wood is a terrific actor, but overplayed the pompous doctor routine to the point of being ridiculous.  Anne Heche, who always comes across as a bit cold, takes this character to the arctic, only to become a weepy basket case at the end in a stunning reversal.  Ray Liotta and Robert Duvall are more like a Keystone Kops than serious cops.  Shawn Hatosy brings new meaning to the word obnoxious as the rich kid who brings the hooker he just beat up to the ER (sure, that's realistic; it happens all the time).
This film isn't terrible, but it's close.  I really enjoy watching Denzel work, but this script is a total hack job, and as good as he is he can't save it.  I rated it a 3/10.  Do yourself a favor and don't insult your own intelligence by seeing it.",1029715200,9,2862,4.77079107505071

1460451,1,B00005JKWX,"First, let's address the most glaring omission...
It's ILLEGAL for an insurance company to change coverage on a patient without first notifying that patient.  With this in mind, there are at least two scenarios....
1) Mr. Archibald realizes this and threatens to file a lawsuit.  IN THE REAL WORLD, this would most likely result in an extremely rapid settlement resulting in full coverage for the kid's transplant.
  OR
2) It was clearly stated in Archibald's policy that he would be demoted to Tier Two coverage when he dropped under a specified work load.  Now, obviously, John was aware that he was no longer working 40 hours a week.  If he was familiar with his policy (ie. took the time to read it), he should have understood his position before the crisis which forms the basis of this movie.
That said, this joke of a movie ignores reality and trades it for almost two hours of shameless, sickening propaganda.  Wealthy heart recipients are portrayed as uncaring morons while John Q, the totally irresponsible center of the story, is suddenly worshipped by the trampled masses for ""taking the law into his own hands"".  Also, any authority figure (police, hospital administrator, etc.)is represented as a heartless ogre.  Give me a break!
The whole premise of the pathetic excuse for a movie is that EVERYBODY is entitled to free or reduced healthcare.  Never mind that ""John Q"" by all rights should have known beforehand that his son's transplant would not be covered.  Only noted TV pinhead Bill Mahr makes the point towards the end of the movie that government health care would come from OUR POCKETS.
Before anybody starts to accuse me of hating this movie because I disagree with it, I want to point out that I love MASH (movie and series), Bruce Springsteen, and many other entertainment media which I disagree with ideologically.  I watch movies and listen to music to be entertained.  The reason John Q fails so miserably is its heavy-handed and unrealistic approach.  It also plays the movie-seeing public as a bunch of unthinking chumps (which may unfortunately be true after reading some of the previous reviews).

I figured some hack talked him into doing this film until I saw the director was Nick Cassevetes who made the wonderful ""She's So Lovely."" It's not that the subject isn't worthy of a film.  The denial of health care to the average American is a very film worthy topic but maybe they needed to talk the likes of David Mamet into writing such a work.  They sure didn't get such a script here.  Washington takes an emergency room hostage in order to get his son the medical care he needs to save his life.  The situation is then milked for every last bit of sentimentality possible and ends up a mawkish, over the top mess.  Robert Duvall is wasted as a stereotypical cop negotiating a hostage situation.  James Wood and Ann Heche are wasted as cardboard cutouts of a doctor (Woods) and medical administrator (Heche). I'd recommend instead getting your hands on a copy of George C. Scott in ""The Hospital"" from the 1970s if you want to see the same topic dealt with in dramatic yet also black comedy brilliance.

The film itself may not have had such an impact were I single. It is a good drama, and certainly worth watching. There are moments when it is overly corny; and the social commentary it tries to bring across is strained at times. But the star cast performance helped keep my interest alive throughout.

But I once again stress on the fact that he was pushed to the limit.

1460520,4,B00005JKWX,"This movie is chock full of big stars and proposed big messages.  While it does fail to address the messages it brings up on health care, it presents the plight of the working poor in our nation very well.
When John Q. Archibald's (Denzel Washington) son gets sick he finds out that everything is not as he thinks.  He questions and questions and questions and finds out that his company has changed his health care plan without his knowledge.  He looks for help anywhere he can get it and finds out that he would be better off on welfare (a sad statement for sure).  This movie shows both the good and the bad in our country.  The ordinary folks trying to help each other and the corporations and big busniess that are driven by the bottom line - money and profit.  But through all this, how much can a man take?  Our star, John Q (Denzel Washington) is pushed and pushed for an answer he can't get anywhere.  He feels pushed into a corner and finally he pushes back.
Denzel Washington, once again, turns in a fine performance.  He is very believable as ""the average Joe"" and reacts in ways that many working folks have thought of time and time again.  There are many other characters in this story that are portrayed very well.  The careeer driven, do anything to get ahead type is done well by Ray Liotta.  The career man who has seen it all and knows the right and wrong moves is done well by Robert Duvall.  Anne Heche plays an excellent ""bottom-liner"" as a profit driven, hard core administrator.  James Woods plays the expert doctor who has compassion but has let the size of his career influence his perception of the world.  And some great small parts by supporting actors playing a variety of ""types"".
Overall, a very good and enjoyable movie, even it was a bit predictable.
Although, as many seemed to have noticed, this movie does not address our failed health care system adequately, it is a good movie to open the door and bring peoples attention to it.  And in the end, it is what it is, a good movie.",1027814400,6,2016,4.452316076294278

Then he talked to his insurer and said he was covered but they swictched to regular basis to an H.M.O. Yada yada. Then he had no more options but to demand them,(the hospital)to put their son's name on the donor list. With a gun.(Personily I would have done that with a sawed-off shotgun, but those are illeagle). Well this is not a family oriented film, but it does have a strong message. This movie has some humor and some teary bleary-eyed moments. The only complait is that the woman in the car chrash did kinda give away the ending. But the ending off the movie isn't exactly uplifting, unlike the fluffy-bunney endings people really see.

How can the likes of Anne Heche, James Woods, and Robert Duvall ruin a movie with bad acting? I don't know but it happened here. With a cast like this this film could have been gold, with a subject like this this movie could have had a social impact. But it's trash.
This is probably the first movie I have seen Denzel in that was this bad. He does his best to save the film but the rest of the acting, editing, and directing is so bad, even a star like Denzel can't help what could have a been brilliant film and social statement.",1027814400,,765,4.210884353741497

Denzel was simply brilliant as John Q and his portrayal was never in doubt but what dragged the movie down was its cliches right from the beginning to the very end.  The ending was a huge disappointment.  I guess that the ending was executed that way by gauging the reaction from the audience survey, and perhaps, there would be an alternative ending in the DVD version later.  Other than Denzel, the rest of the crew was left with hardly any scrapes to develop their characters further.

1460524,4,B00005JKWX,"John Quincy Archibald (played by Denzel Washington)is a hard working middle-class everyday laborer, trying to supply a normal life for his family.  His wife works to supplement his salary.  They struggle to make ends meet, but provide a happy home for their only child.  That happy life is shattered when John's son collapses at a Little League Baseball game.  That's when John discovers that his son has a heart condition that can only be corrected through surgery.  John's son needs a heart transplant.  No problem, thinks John, I have insurance.  We're covered.  Well, John soon discovers that his insurance will not cover the costly operation, nor will the hospital allow the surgery until it receives a downpayment for it.  John, hi wife, family, and friends struggle to raise money for the surgery, only to discover that the hospital is planning to release the child without placing him on the donor's list.  John Q. Armstrong, his back against the wall, does the only thing he can do.  He fights for his son's life, taking his battle to the hospital's ER.
This is a heartbreaking story which is all-to-close to the truth.  HMO's have become a rising problem in America.  People who have money and can afford better insurance or private care get better treatment in hospitals, while others who are insured by HMOs only get as much care as their insurance provider allows.  And try showing up to a hospital ER without insurance!  This movie brings awareness to the public at large of the atrocious health care system that scorns the ""common Joe"", the average lower to middle class families, the ""John Q. Publics"" out there!
Well done!  The actors, an ensamble cast featuring Denzel Washington, Robert Duvall, James Woods, and Ann Heche, are believable in their roles and the story is real.

If you accept those premises, you can cheer for Denzel. If you are tired of being pummelled from all sides by the media's misconceptions of our health care system you will roll your eyes and wish you never bought this film.
The Chicago police are portrayed as war mongering dolts.  With a gunman in the building the police setup just outside the door of the emergency room where he is hiding.  Then they allow onlookers to line up RIGHT BEHIND THE COPS, so that if John Q misses the cops, it will travel 20 feet past the cops and into the crowd.  Worse, the crowd is nothing more than a Ricki Lake audience that cheers anything John Q says.  Because John Q is Denzel, the audience response seems genuine but more like fans of Denzel cheering for Denzel rather than an outraged group of justice seekers.
The final straw is the end where we are blasted with a slick photo montage of news footage featuring our heros, Hillary Clinton et al demanding something be done about our health care system.  This movie is such disinformation and misguided propoganda that it makes me ill.  I do not defend the health system as perfect, however, in general, our system is the best in world and is the best because it has the most free system of research.

Still, I do not understand why a person can cry at a movie while at the same time saying it was ""A really good movie.""  Oh well, some things are not meant to be understood.

1460527,3,B00005JKWX,"Denzel Washington seems incapable of giving anything short of a great performance.  He can be tough, scared, or tender, as the moment requires and this movie requires him to be all three.  He plays a man who is devoted to his family and who is frustrated because the reduced hours of his job have caused a family financial crisis.  When his son collapses on the baseball field because of a serious heart condition, John Q. (Washington) discovers that his insurance coverage has been reduced and will not cover a required heart transplant.  After exhausting all the legal means at his disposal, John Q. takes over the hospital at gun-point and demands that his son be given a heart.  The script then begins to spiral into melodrama and it becomes somewhat preachy.  The message of poor health care for lower-income people may be legitimate, but it is presented in a heavy-handed manner.

It's not the acting, although there is nothing to be proud of there. Aside from Washington, Woods and Duvall, none of the actors make much of an impression. In fact, there's so much ham in the movie (Kim Elise, especially) that I would advise Jewish people to keep clear. It's not the stilted dialog, the contrived story, or the generally mediocre quality of the writing all-around. I guess we can blame this movie's screenwriting committee for this turkey. It's not the overt politicization of health care, either. It's the absolute evil way this movie manipulates you. Basically, this is not a movie for encouraging debate about our nation's shoddy health care system. It's a movie for which you are told exactly what to think. If you're against universal health care, you're against a 10-year-old getting a new heart. And I'm for universal health care, so there. I just don't like to be told what to think by anybody. Onto that, how is Denzel not a criminal? You see, Denzel doesn't deserve blame for his actions, because he's doing it for his kid. Let me tell you something, if you take a school bully hostage because he's beating up your kid, I'll be the first person on the jury to announce your life sentence in prison. It's funny that this movie would resonate in this post-911 world--since Washington plays the most likeable, mild-mannered terrorist in the history of the movies. He is a terrorist--ordinary folks don't go around with guns and threaten people. Shame upon you, Mr. Director, for besmirching a name which stands for vital, innovative, challenging cinema. This movie seems like a rejected TV movie--perhaps even worse. I could go on and on about just how wrong this movie is, but I think you get the picture.

I waited, because every review I read on it, the critic's trashed it entirely.  They said it was way too melodramatic, and that ""It could have been so much more"".  Hogwash.
I caved in and bought it.  I figured, it's a Denzel Washington movie, how bad can it be?  I watched it, and wasn't disappointed one bit.  It starts off a little slow, and the viewer seems detached.  Then, when tragedy strikes, it's like you immediately relate to Washington's charactetr, and what he endures.  I'm sure not many people have been in the position of his character, but with the performance Washington gives, we feel his pain.  As soon as John(Washington's character - obviously) finds out his sick and dying son is going to be released from the hospital, the flick jumps into high-gear, and you're strapped in until the closing credits.
Most people complained that it could have been a lot more, in a sense, to portray the terrible health restrictions, but I was pleased just fine.  After all, it is fiction.  The film definitely carries a certain commentary on the restrictions, but I found that the main conflict was between the people involved, and what needed to be done.
It's a really good flick, with great performances from every actor involved.  There's not one bad acting job in the film.  But obviously, the top kudos go to none other than Denzel Washington himself.  I found his job in this up there with his other films, behing only ""Training Day"" and ""Glory"".  He's definitely one of the best actors of today, tomorrow, and years already past.  The only reason this movie gets 4 stars instead of 5, is that a few of the characters were cliched.  But it's nothing that isn't easily overlooked.
It's got it's flaws, but every movie does, right?  It's definitely better than what the critic's made it out to be, and if you're in the mood for a good, sad movie, then this is a must.  But just see it either way.  It's certainly moving, to say the least.",1027468800,3,2126,4.556728232189974

His job has changed medical plans and his hours have been cut, all more or less without him being aware of it.

1460586,4,B00005JKWX,"""John Q"" is an emotional and powerful film that delivers a much needed message about the state of healthcare in this country. John ""Q"" Archibald (Denzel Washington) is a father who's having a rough time. His hours at work are being cut, his car has been repossessed and his wife is getting edgy since there's no money around. But things get unbelievably worse. During a little league game, his son drops in the middle of the field and passes out. After tests at the hospital, it's learned that John's son will need a heart transplant or he will die. But John can't afford the $250,000 price tag, so he eventually takes matters into his own hands and takes control of the emergency room, taking hostages until his son has a new heart.
The story is a somewhat fresh idea and the acting in the film is wonderful (if not a little melodramatic). All the actors in the film do an exceptional job with the exception of Anne Heche, who I thought was a little lackluster. Denzel is fantastic and gives another oscar worthy performance.
I gave the film 4 stars instead of 5 because I felt that they could have made the film a little more ""edgy"" being the circumstances John Q was put in. But I guess they were leaning towards a more family atmosphere even with the adult subject matter.
The dvd is very well done. The film is presented in widescreen format and looks great. No serious artifacting or imperfections present. The audio is also more than exceptable. There are some deleted scenes (which are really just alternate versions of some of the scenes that are in the film.) and a commentary track.

1460655,3,B00005JKWX,"The film takes a great premise coupled with terrific actors and spoils what could have been an excellent movie with trite, silly, oversimplified dialogue and blunders that shouldn't have been made on a project with this kind of budget.
James Woods and Anne Heche are both capable of excellent acting but in this work they are both given roles and dialogue that could have been played by a first year acting student.  They are forced to become cardboard antagonists that give unbelievable lines in totally unbelievable scenes.  Later as the movie progresses they start to see the light and transform.  The people they portray in the film just aren't real enough to hate or love.
Washington is the man and his character is believable and therefore as a viewer I sympathized and believed in his cause.  He was the saving grace of this flick.  I think the dialogue was just a bit over the top with liberal platitudes about how unfair the world is and how the ""rich"" are out to get everyone else.  It could have been toned down a bit and still have been effective.
The scenes with Robert Duvall and Ray Liotta are more of an obstacle to the film than anything else.  Again the characters that these capable actors are stuck playing is a shame, they are much better than they are allowed to be.
The most annoying thing in the movie are the silly little political statements:
Guns are bad, bad guys get them at gun shows in five minutes.
We don't want our taxes raised so 50 million Americans don't have health coverage.
There's four hundred of us here for one job, probably already taken by some cousin.
The employers are bad, the hospitals are bad, the doctors are greedy, the hmo's let little kids die because it's cheaper, and by the way, you can get a gun at a gun show in five minutes.
As for technical errors:
The emergency rooms of large hospitals have more than four or five patients waiting to be seen, they also have a bigger staff than two or three people (none of which was a doctor).
The old ""sneak through the air duct"" trick belongs in Get Smart reruns and made for tv movies.
No well run hospital lets one child die (with hysterical mother screaming) right next to another terminally ill child.  It may happen in a badly run, overcrowded hospital, but this hospital was on the ""right side of the tracks"", so it can't be both ways.
No police force, faced with a hostage situation and an armed gunman, allows everyone on the force to show up with guns drawn and at the same time allows hundreds of spectators to stand around and cheer as if they were watching a cops charity baseball game.
No paramedics (except for really bad ones) would just hand over a bleeding patient to an armed gunman, unless they were cowards or stupid they'd stay with the guy until released by an attending physician.
I' m no expert, but I'd bet that it wouldn't be a simple procedure to perform a heart transplant in an ER, I'd imagine that it is a little more complicated than just wheeling the bed in and cutting the patient open.
I suppose that the film makers were trying to make a point with this movie and getting all the details correct and believable were not all that important.  I give the film a ""C"" because Denzel Washington is simply a superb actor and he is fun and entertaining to watch.  A mild recommendation for a sloppy offering.",1027123200,5,3334,4.514096185737976
1460656,5,B00005JKWX,"If you love drama, get this movie. If you enjoy quality entertainment, get this movie. If you have a Pollyanna view of our healthcare system or how police handle hostage negotiations, avoid it until you can extract your head from the sand! If you have no idea what parents will do to protect their children, what extreme action they might take to save them from harm, read a newspaper now and again. Better still, ask a parent who is confronted with a similar situation!
I read various reviews pertaining to this film and am amazed how many people have no clue how police handle a hostage situation. Yes, there are lulls in the action, just as in real life. Police attempt negotiations, but also maintain high readiness, prepared to fire at any opportunity in order to end a standoff with minimal loss of life or injury to innocent civilians. Hostages frequently become fond of their captors, a reaction known to psychologists as the Helsinki Syndrome. While trying to understand why they have been taken hostage, it is reasonable, even logical, for hostages to demand an explanation from their captors.
This movie is intelligent, entertaining, and entirely credible. What is more, Denzel gives an incredible performance as a father frustrated by a bureaucratic system that is inherently heartless to the plight of John Q and his dying son. It is an insight into the heartbreaking desperation that compells him to extreme action. The news is filled daily with reports of men with far less cause who are driven to extreme action by a sense of desperation. The scenario is entirely believable.
More importantly, as the featurette ""Fighting for Healthcare"", included on this disc makes abundantly clear, millions of American citizens are either uninsured or underinsured. Worse, among those covered by insurance programs through their employment, policies can change at the whim of the employer. This can be done without notice to the employee, who is left believing they are fully covered for all medical contingencies.
This movie is believable, credible and tense. It is less an action film than a psychological thriller. John Q harkens back to the tense confrontation found in Crimson Tide, which again pitted Denzel Washington against Gene Hackman.
This is a marvelous film. The features included are a stunning indictment of a healthcare system that fails a huge segment of our citizens. The movie is exciting, and highly entertaining. I strongly recommend this movie.",1027036800,,2470,5.0712530712530715
1460657,4,B00005JKWX,"I expected very little from this one and found myself happily surprised while watching this interesting mix of social commentary and audience-pandering drama (and I mean that in a good way) as an armed father John Q (Denzel Washington) takes over an emergency room when a hospital denies his son's placement on a transplant recipient list and is about to release him.
The cards are stacked (think ""Dog Day Afternoon""), the cliches abound (insensitive hospital administrators, numb hot-shot surgeons, blood-thirsty cops, egocentric media types), and there's a enough left-wing propaganda to choke a convention of conservatives (forced rants on gun availability and a cute sound bite from a former First Lady), but somehow I did not feel insulted by it all.
Why? The answer is Denzel Washington, a living paradox, someone who barely registers any excitement yet maintains a high level of charisma. Only someone as trusted by an audience and even-keeled could have kept this movie afloat and balanced, and he does.
Sure, I felt manipulated, but it worked, and I had a good time. Recommended.",1027036800,,1088,5.1525423728813555
1460658,4,B00005JKWX,"Denzel Washington, 2 time Oscar winner for Training Day and Glory, and one of the
world's most talented actors again performs at the level of which audiences have come to
expect from him.  John Q, a desperate man, has to turn to desperate measures in order to
save the life of his son.  The movie, in a minor way, touches on the politics of medicine in
America.  As John begins his fight to fund the heart surgery need by his young son,
director Nick Cassavettes takes us step by step through the ugly reality of HMO's, the
`haves and the have nots' and what happens to people everyday that don't have `proper
medical coverage.'  I'm sure many of us like John Q. (Archibald), have not read the fine
print on their medical policies and assumed that they have adequate medical coverage,
only to find out when its needed, you have none.  Something like extended warrantees on
a used car.  The insurance covers everything except what you need it to cover! The film
ends without an obvious solution, but does briefly show politicians ""talking"" about the
need to reform our healthcare system. Co-staring with Denzel, is James Woods, Robert
Duvall, Ann Heche and Ray Liotta.  Ann's performance as the all business hospital
administrator is worthy of an award while her other co-stars were out performed by the
films other supporting actors.  This DVD is loaded with very good features.  New
Line/Infinifilm again proves excellent value on the DVD. John Q. is rated PG-13 for some
language and violence.",1027036800,2,1495,4.785992217898833
1460659,5,B00005JKWX,"This movie has is all....Denzel Washington is fantastic!!!! As a parent, this movie goes right to my heart.  The only problem I see with the movie is how frighteningly TRUE it is. Health care in America is so pathetic and what happens to John Q (Denzel Washington) and his family is probably right on target for some people. When John finds out his insurance company won't pay for a transplant that his son desperately needs and the hospital won't put his son's name on the donor list unless they come up with 30% of the money for the operation, he takes matters into his own hands.  He takes the emergency room hostage and in it is the transplant doctor, Dr. Raymond Turner (James Woods).  It is sad that it ever came to that, but I thought doctors were here to help people?  But as this movie shows, some are just out for the almighty buck.  This is one of Denzel's best films.  Also co-stars Robert Duvall, Anne Heche, Kimberly Elise, and Shawn Hatosy. A must have for your collection!!!!",1026950400,,991,4.5083798882681565

Being a father of a two-year-old boy, this movie had me in tears, but it was well worth watching.  This movie is definitely a must have!",1026950400,,384,4.380281690140845
1460661,5,B00005JKWX,"To begin with, this movie is very emotionally charged and poignant and sends a distinct message concerning the rapid decline of our health care system.  It is a story of one individual driven to take extreme measures when all other courses of action have failed.
Denzel Washington stars as John Q. Archibald who is a hard working family man trying his very best to keep his finances solvent and trying to make a better life for his family.  It is discovered early on, while at his son's baseball game, that his son collapses and is diagnosed with a life threatening heart condition.  The prognosis for his son is that he needs a heart transplant in a very short time.  John Q discovers that his insurance policy does not cover the needed medical costs to have this operation take place and he is suddenly initiated into the unfair and cruel realities of our health system.
Anne Heche, who plays the consummate hospital administrator, tells John Q his son needs to placed on a list for heart recipients and that a heart transplant comes with an enormous cost which he cannot possibly afford.  Almost devoid of sympathy and acting in a manner akin to a corporate CEO or policy maker or politician, the administrator's true interest here is the profit margin and having the correct type of insurance coverage or nothing at all.  John Q is basically told that there is nothing that can be done for him whatsoever.
John Q pleads with the cardiologist (James Woods) to perform the operation and that he will raise the necessary funds and pay him any way that he can as soon as he can.  The doctor basically tells him that he is out of options also and that his dying son will be discharged from the hospital very soon.  John Q's distraught wife urges her husband to take some form of action immediately to save their son's life.  Being forced into a corner with nowhere to turn, John Q decides to take control of the hospital (along with hostages) until an agreement can be made to help his son.
Ray Liotta and Robert Duvall star as police officers trying to diffuse the situation with each one of them having differing and conflicting ideas on how to terminate the hostage crisis.  As the movie proceeds, you are able to see the interactions that unfold between John Q, his hostages, his family, and the police.  It is a moving and emotional time leading ever closer to his son losing his battle to live.  By what might be attributed to a miracle, the hospital receives word that a properly matched heart has been located and is flown to the hospital to save the son of John Q.  A successful operation is perfomed which saves the life of his son, ends the hospital crisis, and subjects John Q to the legal system for the acts he has committed.
The actions of John Q, although criminal, were not borne out of machismo or malice or spite, but instead were acted out because of serious desperation and the deep love for his son and his desire for his son to have an equal chance to live a long, healthy, and prosperous life.
The main characters in this movie, Denzel Washington, James Woods, Robert Duvall, Ray Liotta, and Anne Heche, delivered excellent perfomances and made the movie very enjoyable.  The plot does, at times, seem a little sensational or maybe a little too manufactured but it does not really deter from the true meaning of the movies message.  This movie idealizes a loving father saving his son's life and having to fight an unjust health care system that should benefit all citizens but doesn't due to it's myriad problems and unfair practices.
I highly recommend this movie to everyone and would venture to say that it is probably one of Denzel Washington's best performances to date.  Very enjoyable movie.",1026864000,4,3722,4.633738601823708
1460662,2,B00005JKWX,"Denzel was very good and the state of health care in the U.S. is atrocious as is the red tape and costs but, ignorance of the law or laws intitles you to nothing! If everyone who needed emergency surgery started taking hostages, hospitals would be guarded like Fort Knox. Then stick in Anne Heche as a totally unbelievable, ""underdressed"", hospital administrater, Duval and Liotta as two guys they grabbed at the water cooler and said get in the movie and play cops and a gaggle of Chicago cops all pointing their loaded guns at an emergency room full of sick, innocent people, not to leave out the ""heart transplant"" surgery that has to be done by a team of several physicians and technicians. You'll like how they toss the heart right in the hole, slam dunk. Then after all this Denzel is given a trial scripted by Frank Capra. The car crash scene was really cool. Well meaning movie, terrible waste of talent.",1026864000,2,912,4.601226993865031

7939377,4,B00005JKWX,"Released in 2002 and directed by Nick Cassavetes, John Q stars Denzel Washington in the title role as a factory worker in the Chicago area whose son desperately needs a heart transplant, but the biyatch at the hospital maintains that he doesnt have enough coverage (Anne Heche). John feels he has no choice but to take radical measures to save his son, even if it costs his life. James Woods plays the main doctor while Robert Duvall & Ray Liotta appear as the top officers. Kimberly Elise is on hand as Johns wife while David Thornton & Laura Harring play the couples best friends.

The movie effectively shows how effed up the American health care system is and appears to promote universal health care. While the system obviously needs fixed, Nobamacare wasn't the way to do it; and, in many ways, made things worse. Nobamacare didn't even accomplish its supposed goal, which was to grant health care to ALL Americans, at least thats what the powers that be maintained; as of this writing there are still 27 million citizens who are uninsured, and probably far more than that. In reality Nobamacare was basically a Demoncrap Federal power grab.

But all that is irrelevant to whether or not the movie is effective, which it is. Its not believable, but its certainly entertaining. What do I mean by not being believable? The tone is generally realistic, but the characters and dramatics are so amped up the movie is sometimes almost a parody (almost). A good example is how over-the-top uncaring Heches character is compared to the low-key evil of Nurse Ratched in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). The histrionics amongst the hostages is another prime example.

Speaking of the hostages, at around the 40-minute mark the movie settles into a confined-location flick. These kinds of stories involve several characters, usually strangers, who are stuck in a particular environment wherein they are forced to get to know each other and interact in order to survive (2007s The Mist is a good example). The producers assembled a notable cast for this stock plot (Eddie Griffin, Shawn Hatosy, Heather Wahlquist,  Troy Winbush, Ethan Suplee and a few others, including Woods) with Griffin, Hatosy, Winbush and Wahlquist standing out. The latter, incidentally, has a great Whoa Mama! scene.

The opening scenes seem somewhat contrived, but the movie quickly finds its footing and compellingly embroils you in the events until the close, despite the aforementioned overblown moments. Of course, Washington is excellent as the likable protagonist turned antihero. You cant help but sympathize with him even though what he does is very foolish. Bold, yes, but foolish.

The movie run 116 minutes and was shot in Ontario (Solina, Cambridge, Ajax, Hamilton, Oshawa & Toronto) and Montreal with the mountain scenes shot in Alberta (Canmore & Cochrane) and establishing shots in Chicago. WRITER: James Kearns.
