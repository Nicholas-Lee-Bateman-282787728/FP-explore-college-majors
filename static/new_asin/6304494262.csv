7873673,5,6304494262,"Thich Nhat Hanh's life is a spiritual teaching in itself, and it comes through magnificently in this brief film. His thoughtful and penetrating responses to the off-camera interviewer are wonderful to behold. His whole being is quiet and supple, fully engaged and spiritually beguiling, handling profound questions with noble ease. What a teacher! Knowing Nhat Hanh's incredible personal history of struggle during the Vietnam war helps to focus an understanding of his remarks on suffering; like Merton, he forges a synthesis of wide spiritual understanding to transcend the sectarian bottlenecks that plague contemporary religious practice. This monk is a living witness to the far horizons of human compassion. Door of Compassion curls its way through the listener frame by frame, inspiring and consoling anyone who seeks it. Many times worth the price listed here.",1157328000,,868,5.485074626865671
