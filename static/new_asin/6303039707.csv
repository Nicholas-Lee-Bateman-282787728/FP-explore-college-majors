Biography - Don Ameche

As much as I have always loved this Best Picture Oscar nominee, I have always been very disappointed never to have seen the original, longer ""roadshow version"", which includes almost fourteen minutes of additional footage.  Finally, after years of waiting, it appears that my chance to see the entire movie in all its glory will  be coming with the DVD release of this movie from Fox Home Video.  As noted above, the disc will be two-sided, and will contain both versions of the film ... the familiar ""Theatrical"" version which has played on television all these years, and the rarely screened original ""Roadshow"" edition which was a box office smash ... and earned Alice Brady the Best Supporting Actress Oscar back in 1937.  Thank you in advance,  Fox Home Video ... this is exactly the type of consumer-friendly offering that will earn you the loyalty and financial support of classic movie connoiseurs!",1117152000,60,1074,5.0
540482,3,6303039707,"""In Old Chicago"" is a hopelessly dated melodrama released in 1937 chronicling a fictitious account of the O'Leary family and the events leading to the great Chicago fire of 1871.  Tyrone Power and Don Ameche play 2 of the 3 O'Leary brothers who arose through a tough upbringing in the seedy slums of the ""Patch"" section of Chicago.

Power, a ""wise guy"" and eventual cabaret owner and his brother Ameche, a lawyer wound up on opposite sides of the law.  When Ameche got elected mayor of Chicago he threatened Power's shady business dealings.  Alice Faye playing Power's righteous cabaret singer wife attempted to mediate to no avail.  Push came to shove and eventually the cow kicked over the lantern and you know the rest.

Outside of some outstanding footage and special effects of the ferocious fire there wasn't much to this very average soapy drama.  Brian Donlevy, an excellent movie tough guy was wasted in this movie as a corrupt mayoral candidate.",1104192000,5,955,4.8580246913580245
540483,4,6303039707,"Tyrone Power and Don Ameche co-star in this stagey, grandiose historical drama, in which the rivalry of two brothers culminates in the Great Chicago Fire of 1873.  The plot leading up to the fire is kind of standard fare, but the special effects at the end are really dazzling and horrific.  Power gets a bigger, juicier role than Ameche, but they're both pretty good here.  A reasonably fun rental.",1062806400,3,399,4.753623188405797
540484,4,6303039707,"As the legendary Mrs. O'Leary, Brady has a few miraculous scenes (her cow kicks over a kerosene lamp and thusly starts the big blaze of 1871).  The remainder of the movie, however, which features Ameche as her perfect son and Power as her shrewd, black sheep scamp - is on a different level entirely.  It's a mediocre - though jolly - quasi-historical melodrama involving brawls, riots, capricious temperaments, police squads, cafe ladies, gaudy saloons (with Alice Faye smiling that great open smile of hers).  When one hears Faye's  mellow velvety voice caress her musical numbers, you can almost forgive lack of acting ability; Ameche is so fatuous here that he's almost likeable...Fox made this film in order to capitalise on the success of MGM's SAN FRANCISCO - it was not completely in vain.  Based upon the novel WE THE O'LEARYS by Niven Busch.  The supporting cast includes Tom Brown, Sidney Blackmer, Brian Donlevy and Andy Devine.",1026432000,5,940,4.993589743589744
540485,4,6303039707,"20th Century-Fox took its cue from MGM's 1936 hit ""San Francisco"" (with its spectacular earthquake scenes) and made its own disaster hit.  Tyrone Power and Alice Faye were Fox's answer to MGM's Clark Gable and Jeanette MacDonald, and along with Don Ameche and the incomparable Alice Brady, their film just as fun and entertaining as MGM's hit.
Good Americana, with enough melodrama and music to satisfy any diehard movie fan.  The highlight is the great Chicago fire, which is even more spectacular than the burning of Atlanta in another 30's classic, ""GWTW"".  It is amazing they did all those great special effects without computers and animation.  Just good old-fashioned sets on the back-lot.  ""In Old Chicago"" is a golden chestnut from the early disaster movie genre of the 1930's.",1008720000,5,785,5.054263565891473
540486,4,6303039707,"that's a line of dialogue that gets pretty tired towards the end of this spectacular, since it is much too overused. However, be that as it may, this film used to be on TV a lot when I was a kid, and I always used to watch it for the marvelous fire footage. It's the sort of scene that appears to be a history book come to life, with horse-drawn fire engines racing down the street, and massive buildings caving in while blazing away.  And wouldn't you know it? The whole thing started in the barn of Mrs. O'Leary--the same Mrs. O'Leary who is the mother to mayor Don Ameche and crooked guy Tyrone Power. The two brothers are always at odds, eventually even clashing, though not romantically, over Ty's treatment of chanteuse Alice Faye. Yet, because they are A Strange Tribe, they always are there for each other when the chips are down--and with an inferno raging away, the chips don't get downer than this!",995500800,2,909,4.475903614457831
540487,5,6303039707,"This movie is worth seeing for the fire alone.  But in a buildup of love and loss, we are given four very human souls to cherish throughout the calm and the chaos.
Alice Brady won an Academy award for her portrayel of Mrs. O'Leary, the owner of the infamous cow and mother of the O'Leary clan.  Her performance is sentimental and tough, and her award richly deserved.
The trio of Tyrone Power, Don Ameche and Alice Faye hit it off with memorable characters.  Ameche is the honest, hard-working brother who means to make Chicago as good a place as he can.  Power gives a splendid performance as the charming but rotten brother whose power in Chicago is both impressive and abused.  Faye is the singer caught between them, alternately loving and hating Power along with the rest of us.
This is a wonderful example of the universal tale in which rascals can always be redeemed and cities are never burnt forever.  A classic from the silver screen era, with lovely music and an unforgettable climax.  Haunting in its tragedy, inspiring for the human story behind it.
A must-see, for any silver-screen fan.",970531200,10,1101,4.703125

Instead, the DVD was mostly fiction - Mrs. O'Leary did not have a son who became mayor of Chicago, and while she did have a son who owned a saloon, he wasn't a kingmaker either. Then, doing a bit of reading on the side, I learn that it's also questionable whether Mrs. O'Leary's cow started the great fire either.

Like all features and cartoons released during the lengthy ASCAP strike, ""In Old Chicago"" relies for music on such public domain chestnuts as ""Oh Genevieve,"" ""The Irish Washerwoman"" and ""Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys.""

Set in 1871, a fictional drama of the O'Leary family unfolds while we wait for the family's skittish cow to kick over that lantern. This small barn fire culminates in the destruction of a major portion of the city from an all-engulfing inferno. Really spectacular fire sequences still boggle the mind over 70 years later. IMO, Tyrone Power's best and a most enjoyable FOX motion picture.

540632,3,6303039707,"Now, I know very little about Chicago history, so I don't know how accurate this is. Here's all I know about Chicago history:

""Late last night, while we were all in bed
Old lady Leary lit a lantern in her shed
And when the cow kicked it over,
She winked her eye and said
'They'll be a hot time in the old town tonight'
Fire! Fire! Fire!""

I understand that the name was O'Leary, and that part of the story is apparently true. But this story is about the entire O'Leary family, including one that became mayor, so perhaps some Chicagoan can tell me if that part's true.

Mrs. O'Leary was made a widow just outside of town when her husband decided to try to race a train in their covered wagon. The trace broke, and he was dragged by the horses until he was injured beyond repair. So she entered town with her three young sons, Jack, Dion and Bob. She started a laundry, ""Molly O'Leary's French Laundry,"" and raised her boys, insisting they go to school.

Flash forward to where the boys are all grown up. Jack (Don Ameche) is a lawyer, although he is just getting started and gets all excited about winning a case even when he doesn't get paid. Dion (Tyrone Power) is a gambler and ne'er do well who eventually deals himself into a successful saloon with his partner, Belle Fawcett (Alice Faye). Bob married the Swedish hired girl and settled down to help his mother with the laundry and turn her into a grandmother.

Jack and Dion get involved in politics; Jack runs for mayor, and Dion schemes behind the scenes. But apparently so does everyone else in Chicago. I didn't follow who sold out whom, or how or why, but there was enough of that going around. None of it would have meant much except that Jack, as mayor, was determined to clean up ""the Patch,"" the neighborhood where his mother lived which was all old wooden houses with inadequate fire services and then that pesky cow kicked over that darn lantern. Of course a bunch of thugs assumed that he had set the fire deliberately rather than go through the lengthy process of eminent domain.

The last ten minutes or so of the movie was the fire and ensuing chaos.",1336780800,,2122,4.442159383033419
540633,3,6303039707,"If it were not for the spectacular special effects of the Chicago fire, this wouldn't be worth much.  The start of the fire (Mrs. O'Leary's cow kicks over a lantern) has been proved false, and it had been when the movie was made.  Alice Faye looks nice, wasn't a great singer, and wore some costumes on stage that seem out of place in the Victorian era.  We see all of her legs, front view and back.  She's a bit risque, even today.  Tyrone Power and Don Ameche cause a certain suspension of disbelief from the viewer.

So we are back to the special effects.  They are as good as the scene of the burning of Atlanta in Gone With the Wind.  And for the fire, I give this three stars.",1317600000,,682,4.1923076923076925
540634,4,6303039707,I would give the theatrical version 3 stars but the Roadshow version is definitely superior in every way!  The movie fictionalizes the Great Fire of 1871 with a story that isn't very interesting but the fire itself is a gem.  The additional footage of the Roadshow is wonderful to behold and makes the movie so much more interesting.  The O'Leary clan of cow fame (her cow supposedly kicked over the kerosene lamp that began the fire) is expanded to three sons who take over and run the city.  The dream of a great city is realized in the ashes of a wood city.,1289952000,,560,4.407766990291262
540635,4,6303039707,"Historical films were very popular in the 1930's, as were historical novels, and this may be one of the best of the type.  It follows, in fictionalized fashion, the career of Mrs. O'Leary (Alice Brady)--she of the famous cow--and her three sons, Jack (Don Ameche), a lawyer and would-be reformer; Dion (Tyrone Power), a hustler on the make; and baby Bob (Tom Brown), who drives his mother's laundry-delivery wagon and is the first of the trio to marry (his wife, Gretchen (June Storey), is his mother's milkmaid and assistant) and present her with a grandchild.  Having lost her husband to a wagon accident as the family made its way to Chicago in 1854, by the late '60's Mother O'Leary has made a decent living out of laundry, and her sons are positioned to better themselves.  Much of the conflict in the story comes out of the different ways they choose to do so.  Jack gets himself elected Mayor--with the secret backing of his brother Dion, who has become a power in The Patch, the local anything-goes district--and sets out to Clean Up the Town.  Dion, of course, opposes this program, and he also has rival Gil Warren (Brian Donleavy) to contend with.

Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/San-Francisco/dp/B000F7CMQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">San Francisco</a>, which came from the same studio two years earlier, the movie focuses less on the climactic disaster than on the events preceding it and particularly the people moving among them, which helps the viewer to relate to the tragedy when it finally comes.  (These two movies could, in fact, be said to be the daddies of the great boom of disaster flicks of the '70's--the best of which, like the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Airport-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005B1Y0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Airport (Widescreen Edition)</a>, also focus on the people.)  Power, as the central character, is an unprincipled rogue who lets nothing--not even family loyalty--stand in his way, but he has a breezy charm that makes it hard not to like him.  And perhaps because it wasn't filmed in a wide-screen process, when the Great Fire finally does break out, you actually get something of the feel of what it must really have been like in the teeming streets--people running, crowding, screaming, shouting, bells clanging, horses whinnying, fire engines thundering to and fro with whistles shrieking, and behind it all that hungry crackling of devouring flame.  The special effects are of course primitive, yet I thought them very well done for their day.  This would be a great family film and may serve to interest youngsters in the history of the real fire (of course nowadays we know that Mrs. O'Leary's cow was almost certainly innocent) and of the many immigrants from Ireland who helped make the U.S. what it is today.",1278115200,,2873,5.362222222222222

In its uncut 110-minute roadshow version, In Old Chicago plays like an even more obvious ripoff of San Francisco, merely substituting Tyrone Power, Don Ameche, Alice Faye and the Chicago fire for Clark Gable, Spencer Tracey, Jeanette MacDonald and the San Francisco earthquake and adding more twee Oirish antics than are healthy. The musical numbers are a step down too, particularly Faye's rendition of Carry Me Back to Old Virginny complete with `massa' lyrics, and the finale isn't as grand on screen as it is in your memory: the scenes of the crowds of refugees on the banks tend to be far more effective than the backlot chaos.

540683,4,6303039707,"With more than a passing nod to M-G-M's blockbuster smash of 1936 ""San Francisco"", IN OLD CHICAGO details the events leading up to the famous fire of 1871.  Twentieth Century-Fox assembled three of their most bankable stars of 1939 (following their roles in ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" the previous year) for this historical romp, and the production values were lavish (highlighted by the climactic and harrowing 20-minute sequence of the fire itself, which required it's very own film and production unit).

The O'Leary boys, Dion (Tyrone Power) and Jack (Don Ameche) make and break their fortunes in the bustling city of Chicago.  Good boy Jack plays fair and settles for whatever he can get; while Dion fights, cajoles and charms his way to the top.  Alice Faye plays Dion's beautiful wife, saloon singer Belle Fawcett.  Alice Brady turns in an Oscar-winning performance as Mrs O'Leary, whose cow unwittingly sets the fire in motion.

Alice Faye dazzles in her sparkling costumes and gowns (designed by Royer), and sings a selection of period numbers.  Tyrone Power is as handsome as always; and the supporting cast includes Phyllis Brooks, Brian Donlevy, Tom Brown, and Sidney Blackmer.

It was an old slave song which because of our politically correct era was revised (lyrics were eliminated since it was written & sung from a slave's viewpoint). The original lyrics are sung here. In her talented hands, this is still a patriotic & beautiful song showcasing the Old Dominion State. Only Ms. Faye could as a marvelous entertainer sing this song with original lyrics and I do not think anyone would be offended even today.
The print & sound quality of this dvd is excellent. The special effects showing the fire that swept through Chicago are visually outstanding. It's as fine as the fire that engulfed Atlanta in ""Gone With The Wind"". However, my favorite actress is the wonderful actress that portrays Mrs. O'Leary, a hardworking and honorable lady who exemplifies dignity regardless of the tragedies that befall her family.

The scenes depicting the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 are simply astounding, moment after moment making one wonder how they did it all with the technology of the late 30's.

Of course, initially one has to sit through the first hour of the movie, which I have to say is sort of quaint and old-fashioned with its fictionalized and slightly soapy version of the lives of the O'Leary family.  But even these scenes are always at least mildly engaging and are often laced with sharp humor and knowing asides about big city politics.

In addition to getting two complete versions of the movie (the shorter regular theatrical release and a longer ""roadshow"" version), a nice batch of extras is also included on the DVD.

Tyrone Power, Don Ameche and Alice Faye are a likable trio (they can also be seen together on the musical Alexander's Ragtime Band, available on DVD) of leading stars, which is both a plus and a minus.  They're just too likable and rather bland, so the film lacks the sexual tension that Clark Gable, Jeannette MacDonald and Spencer Tracy brought to San Francisco.  I do prefer Alice Faye's deep singing voice to Jeannette MacDonald's.  This was the first film (of less than a handful) that allowed Ms. Faye to show some range as an actress and, for the most part, she does a good job.  The A&E Biography segment on Don Ameche is as informative as usual.",1126742400,4,880,4.7254901960784315
540689,4,6303039707,"""In Old Chicago"" was a blockbuster movie made in 1937, a box office smash which contributed significantly to the emergence of 20th Century Fox as a major studio. The film mirrored MGM's 1936 smash hit ""San Francisco"" and while Tyrone Power, Alice Faye and Don Ameche do not have quite the weight of personalities of Clark Gable, Jeanette Macdonald and Spencer Tracy, they were 10 to 15 years younger in Faye and Power's case so this is understandable.

Seeing the roadshow version of the film makes one wonder why Fox bothered to put the shorter version on the DVD because you may never view it again. All of a sudden, the dramatic portions of the film make better sense, with the smooth continuity of a Henry King directed film and notably missing from the shorter version. All the principals' performances improve too because what seemed quite superficial now has more depth. For example, instead of being told Don Ameche is an honest lawyer, we SEE him in action; instead of being told Tyrone Power is a crook, we SEE him offering bribes. Power, in particular, is very convincing as the charming Irish rogue.

The story is a corny tale of the Irish O'Leary family and has that hokey quality which undermined a lot of Fox's big productions. By the time you have heard for the third time that ""We O'Learys are a strange tribe"", you can almost hope that they suffer some unspeakable death when the fire starts! Alice Faye plays Belle Fawcett, the dance hall attraction whom the crooked Power marries. This was Faye's bid for major stardom when she replaced Jean Harlow who died just before production began. Faye is diffident at first but Henry King coaxed her along and her confidence grows. The film was a great success for her. She sings 3 songs too and her version of ""Carry Me Back to Ol' Virginny"" is memorable and retains its original ""southern"" lyrics. Alice Brady won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as Mrs O'Leary but there is nothing to warrant it except a good Irish brogue and the fact that she is playing a serious part for once instead of the screwball mothers for which she was typecast. The special effects which make up the last 20 minutes of the film are spectacular and really give the film the status it has retained.

The DVD prints of both versions of the film are good and the package contains a couple of short newsreels including the New York premiere of the film. There is a good Biography program of Don Ameche but this film was important enough to warrant a commentary.",1125705600,14,2511,4.625560538116592

The information should be readily available at Amazon for this disc, and the many other Fox Classics that have similar biographies.  You're missing a real opportunity here, and your customers deserve, and should have all the information on included special features to make an informed buying decision.",1121904000,12,670,4.955357142857143
