The movie starts with a body on the beach, carried in by the tide. The Allies could land at a number of places. Can they misinform the enemy so their defense of Sicily is weakened? Lt. Commander Ewan Montagu must come up with a plan to fool the enemy. The simpler the better. We see life in wartime London. They meet Sir Bernard Spilsbury to talk about medical facts. Someone who died of pneumonia would have water in their lungs, like a drowned person. The body could be preserved with dry ice in a container. Operation Mincemeat is approved and critiqued. Montagu answers the questions. The Prime Minister approves the plan, cutting through red tape. They find a body that will serve their needs. The father asks that his sons body will be respected and given a Christian burial. Yes.

It will be a great thing for England (but the man was a Scotsman). Major William Martin will be given papers to authenticate his identity. Pam will write a letter. [Would sea water wash out any ink?] Pams friend Lucy uses her personal experience to compose this letter. We see the other documents used to authenticate Major Martin. [Isnt it difficult to dress a dead body?] The noise of bombs exploding adds tension to this drama. [Is that the right skin color for a dead Caucasian?] Next the Optical Instruments are delivered to a submarine. [Sailors believe a dead body brings bad luck to a ship.] Will the Major have a successful journey? [Shouldnt there have been a loss of an airplane to explain the disappearance of the Major?] The round case is delivered top side. A rubber dinghy is launched, next the Major. A short burial service is recited.

A carrier pigeon is released to carry the results. [It cant be intercepted and decoded, or traced by radio finders.] The body washes up on shore, a poor fisherman calls the authorities. A Spanish Naval Officer takes the briefcase. A man informs the British Embassy, an official asks for the briefcase. The Major has arrived. The body is buried with honors, the papers are returned. Were those envelopes opened? A scientist in a lab coat tests the envelopes. It was opened by somebody who knows what he was doing. But one German officer has doubts, they will send an agent to London. Mr. Riley arrives to verify Martins past. A taxi takes him to a location. [This tells about life then, such as blackout curtains.] Rileys suitcase has unusual items! Riley goes to Gieves for khaki shirts, then asks for information at the Navy Club.

Mr. Phillips: calls a bank for information; they make an afternoon appointment. Is he suspicious? Montagu visits Scotland Yard for help. Will Phillips show up? Riley looks for the girlfriend at her home address. Lucy gets bad news. Riley gives his address to Pam. Lucy arrives and talks about her dead boyfriend. Riley leaves after giving his address to Pam; she makes a telephone call. Riley sends a radio message; if he is still free in an hour then Martin existed. [Would a real spy do that?] Montagu surmises Rileys plan and explains it to the General. They will not arrest Riley, even if he leaves the country. Riley sends the message Martin genuine. The enemy moves some of its forces away from Sicily. After the war Montagu visits Martins grave. [Note the walled vaults in that country.]

This war movie that has little action, only intellectual activity. There were other deceptions, read The Double-Cross System for more details. The book Operation Mincemeat goes into more details and presents the true facts. There was an earlier example, read The War Magician about the battle El Alamein and false information taken from dead British officer.",1421193600,,3691,4.742990654205608
