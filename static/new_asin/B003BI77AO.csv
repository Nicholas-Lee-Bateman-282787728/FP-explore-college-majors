8393651,1,B003BI77AO,"I am speaking now of the documentary titled ""MYSTERY GORILLAS"". What you see of the Gorillas is fantastic. Unfortunatly, too often you are forced to look at people talking. EXAMPLE: you are watching two male gorillas sizing each other up and trying to intimidate each other. They are about ready to fight. Then, the camera switches to a close up glamore shot of a woman named Mireya Mayo. This is constantly happening during the entire show. It ruins the mood and experience. Not only does this woman Mireya Mayo insist and force us to watch her too frequently, she is also partially dressed for a beach party. She is frequently wearing a shirt a couple sizes too small and exposing arms, shoulders and cleavage. Who the heck goes tramping through the CONGO jungle dressed that scantilly. What about the exposure to thorns and tree branches that scratch your skin? What bout insect bites? The local guides are all dressed proper for the situation. Oh, i almost forgot, Mireya Mayo thinks we bought the dvd to watch her not the Gorillas. I give it 1 star instead of ZERO because what nature and Gorillas you are allowed to watch is very good. If it was 90% viewing of the nature and Gorillas i would have given the film crew 5 stars.",1385942400,5,1232,4.6045454545454545

8393653,5,B003BI77AO,"Touching stories on this DVD - we humans could learn so much from the other Great Apes!

I have a growing collection of ape/primate DVDs and movies and this is an excellent addition.

My thanks to Amazon and National Geographic.",1375401600,,228,4.675
8393654,5,B003BI77AO,"The First part of the dvd is ""Mystery Gorillas"", a team from the Wildlife Conservation Society exploring the jungles of the Congo Republic, a modern look at the survival of the apes. Brilliant.
The Second part was a documentary from the eighties/nineties, based on Diane Fossey. Once again Brilliant. This is a must see dvd.",1281830400,6,324,4.909090909090909
