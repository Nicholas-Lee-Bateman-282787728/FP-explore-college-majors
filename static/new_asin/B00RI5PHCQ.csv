8695390,5,B00RI5PHCQ,"This show of Man Vs. Food is 1 of my all time favorites, because Adam knows exactly where he wants to go & have a good meal & everyone knows who he is by his ultimate food challenges, they think of Adam as a loyal God to the mighty food. If you or loved one or anyone is a total fan of Man Vs. Food, this will be good for any fan, because I suggest it & I have it on DVDs & it's a good show & I love watching it over & over again.",1499558400,,430,3.4895833333333335

He  travels  to  every  city  in  the  country,  &  tries  all  kinds  of  different  foods,  Bar B Q  brisket  burgers,  hot  dogs, breakfast  pancakes  at  unbelievable  size!  (Adam Richmond)  conquers  the  vast  majority  of  them.  Behold  though.  Not  everybody  can  do  what  he  does.  A  lot  of  stuff  he  eats  is  so  much  spicier  then  Jalapenos.
Its  not  uncommon  for  him  to  try  to  eat  a  sub  sandwich.  I  watched  him  try  to  finish  one.  He  almost  got  it  completely  done,  as  you'll  notice  sometimes  he'll  take  home  a  shirt  from  the  restaurant  &  sometimes  he  won't.  Other  places  say  if  you  finish  all  of  that  you  don't  have  to  pay.  But  if  you  don't  finish  you  do  have  to  pay.  So  in  this  one  episode  he  didn't  finish  &  he  ended  up  having  to  pay  the  entire  140.00  dollars  for  it.  &  that's  way  out  of  my  price  range.  He's  handled  the  real  hot  &  spicy  stuff  better  than  anyone.  &  with  a  cheering  crowd  behind  him  he  pushes  through  &  wins  at  a  certain  time  which  he  is  told  he  must  eat  the  food  in  half  an  hour,  or  an  1 1/2  or  whatever.  Adam  is  crazy.  I  love  to  watch  him  take  on  the  eating  challenges.  If  I  did  what  he  did  more  than  likely  I  would  probably  have  stomach  ache  later  on.
I  watch  this  because  it  amuses  me.  Yep  I  found  this  to  be  a  heck  of  a  show!",1477353600,,1473,4.004048582995951
