4688351,5,B005G4FFG4,"I learned of this video from reading her book: Prime Time.  I can't put this book down.  I am not anywhere near 73 years old, but since she is a movie star, her opportunity to interview so many experts, on so many things, makes this book a wealth of information.  Also, I will be having knee surgery soon, and am looking for a home workout routine to get back to my gym self, and a video from a 20 year old, jumping up and down, is not what I was looking for.",1314230400,56,459,3.967391304347826

My only problem is that the quality is not HD on my computer, and there are occasional pauses. But overall, I am very glad these videos are now available for online stream.
It starts with a nice warm-up exercise and is followed by three courses of 12-minute dance/cardio and at the end there is a cool down exercise as anyone who has exercised with Jane knows. One of my favorite Jane videos.",1457049600,2,559,4.544554455445544

4688458,3,B005G4FFG4,"I was looking for something low impact due to knee trouble; however, this is much slower paced than I would like.  It's okay for those just wishing to keep their bodies moving to avoid stiff muscles, etc., but for a more robust workout I would probably add hand and maybe even leg weights.",1449100800,,289,4.452830188679245

4688475,3,B005G4FFG4,I like this workout but find the live music a bit corny and I almost feel like Jane is showing off a bit in this one.  It is quite fast paced and a little hard to follow in places so I just do the best I can.,1443139200,,208,3.425531914893617
4688476,4,B005G4FFG4,Like the video. Movitating and easy to do.,1442880000,,42,4.375
4688477,5,B005G4FFG4,Love Jane Fonda's workout DVDs.  These most recent ones are perfect for older exercisers.  She's very encouraging and the workout makes you sweat!  Good thing at my age.,1442188800,,169,4.964285714285714
4688478,5,B005G4FFG4,I am a 58 yea old woman who had Jane Fonda's original video earlier in life and loved it.  I really am pleased with this workout.  It's gentle on me and yet is a great workout. Recommend!,1441584000,2,187,4.027027027027027
4688479,5,B005G4FFG4,I really enjoy this DVD.  The routines are fun.  Jane does a good job of explaining aerobic exercise and how it benefits your body.  I am 60 y.o. and I can keep up.  You can customize your workout and do as many routines as you want.  She starts with a warm up and ends with a cool down.  It's great!  I really like it and its helped my stamina.,1441411200,,345,3.9130434782608696

4688484,4,B005G4FFG4,A bit annoying but basically what I need. Exercise without jumping (jumping hurts my neck). Good for older people or someone with special issues.,1439683200,,145,5.083333333333333
4688485,5,B005G4FFG4,I am 74 years old and not in bad physical condition but have not been working out this past year because I was taking care of my mother.  I needed something to get me started exercising again but not those videos that are made for the 20 and 30 year olds.  This video is perfect for getting me sweating and moving again.  Not beyond my ability.  It has 3 workouts on it and you can do one and stop which I did at first.  It didn't take long and I could do one after the other and not be too tired.  I am beginning to feel strong again.  Fonda does a very good job of preparing a workout that is not too much but really gets you going.,1439596800,,634,3.90625
4688486,5,B005G4FFG4,Jane Fonda never disappoints.  Her exercise routine is easy to follow and fun.  Thank you Jane Fonda,1438732800,,100,4.823529411764706

4688489,5,B005G4FFG4,I use this video three times a week.  I am in my late 50's and needed something to address stamina without impact.  I am loving this!  The dance moves are fun and I look forward to it.  I do a different workout each time.  I also really enjoy Jane Fonda.  She says some really funny things and cracks me up.,1436745600,,307,4.033333333333333
4688490,5,B005G4FFG4,"A great cardio work out, in 3 segments, plus stretching so you can do one segment, 2,, or all 3, depending on your level of fitness. I have MS and like that I can do as much as I am able on any given day. And the music is great!",1436745600,,228,3.58
4688491,5,B005G4FFG4,"As an older woman (59) who was forced into a sedentary life these past 3 years, and who gained quite a bit of weight, this is a very good beginner workout but in part because I've done a lot of aerobics before. Fonda doesn't demo the moves and moves somewhat quickly -- which is fine if they aren't new to you. Also, I'm experienced enough to know to drop the arms or modify lower body movements when I needed to but a total newbie might not. Fonda is chipper and friendly, and the 3 10-minute aerobic-dance sections can be mixed and matched with ease so that the warm-up and cool-down play when you set them to -- which I very much like. Her cool down focuses on improving balance which is important as we age. For the right user I do highly recommend this video.",1436227200,3,764,4.275862068965517

4688503,5,B005G4FFG4,I love this workout. Great music (live musicians). Nice easy to follow steps that are very fun. This is one of my favorite exercise DVDs.,1435708800,,137,4.52
4688504,5,B005G4FFG4,"I like exercising from DVD, but nowadays , most of the new productions around seem to be meant for hyperactive kangaroos. Which I definitely am not. What this 60 plus old lady needs is keeping in shape, keeping balance and being able to use my muscles ( esp as I love hiking in the mountains!). JF's step video and several of her other (older) ones have come in good stead here.
For those who want to lose calories in the first place, I would recommend  good diet in the first place, just exercise is not the way to go, although it will help.

And I am verrrry bad at learning steps, esp fast ones, but I am quite sure that if I stick to this, I will learn them soon :-)",1435449600,,670,4.106870229007634

Easy to follow, step by step.  It is addicting, this Jane Fonda DVD is a keeper and will not collect ""dust.""  Applies to both genders. Dance  anytime.  Upon the completion dancing, I'm not exhausted nor sore.  My energy level increase, remaing for the duration of the day.  Nice feeling.

4688516,5,B005G4FFG4,I love all of her workouts.  They are practical and she tells you why each movement is needed and how to get the most from it.  I've tried many DVDs and always go back to Jane for the best workout.,1431648000,,197,3.9
4688517,4,B005G4FFG4,It's a great workout for me at age 62. She does not prompt every time. It would have helped to add text prompts prior to the step changes. Otherwise it's a great workout and gets me sweating.,1431302400,,191,4.1891891891891895

4688524,4,B005G4FFG4,"I did the whole thing back to back and it did what I wanted it to - got me up a moving for 45 minutes and was fun. Yes it has chorography but it is easy to follow but just not so easy that you will be bored to death by the third use.  I think Zumba Gold or beginners Zumba class would be a good comparison.  Really liked the fact there was a live band but wish we say them more.  Jane looks great and is very motivating.  This is not a calorie torcher and probably around 125 on heart rate monitor but it is good it you are trying to do ""10,000 steps"" each day ad good way to get some extra steps in at the end of the day but do not feel like doing something with any dread factor to it.  I think this would be great for seniors with some fitness level who want their exercise to be fun and not just a chore.",1428796800,,808,3.757396449704142

I am bone on bone in my right knee and the only section I have trouble with is the Latin one, too much twisting with the knees so I will skip that one. The other 2 I have no problems doing.

Jane Fonda is a great instructor. She's nice to listen to and really enjoys herself doing the workout. I thought it was also cute because she kept mentioning her ""boyfriend"" throughout the video...

I just loved all the moves she was instructing as well. They were simple but fun to me. Similar to Kathy Smith's (some were) but like even better. The pace was perfect too. The music was perfect and went so well with each workout, like inspiring. You really get a nice workout also.

The only minor complaint I have, I skip the first 3 minutes of the latin section. But I think it's a personal thing. Because we had to do the ""cha cha cha"" with our feet, and I get easily tired from those.

Any way, thanks Jane Fonda for putting this wonderful workout video!

4688632,1,B005G4FFG4,"Years ago I really enjoyed one of Fonda's videos on VHS and was looking for something on DVD that was similar.  I thought I'd go with this one because it seemed like it would help and I was hoping for some similar exercises to the old video I liked so much.  I figured Jane Fonda videos would be similar.  I'm only in my early 30's and I know this is geared towards older people and they may like it, but I really wanted something that isolated different muscle groups and had lots of stretching and toning exercises.  After 5 kids I'm having lots of back and muscle issues and a bit of weight to lose, and really want something that has lots of stretches and works on toning each part of your body.

This was basically a dance video with hard to follow moves with a live band.  The music was fine, but most of her moves were very hard to follow.  I'm sure with time I could keep up better, but most of the time I was walking all over the living room and trying hard not to bump into things or my kids and trip over my own feet.  I'm not sure how this would be easy for older people.  I'm not horribly uncoordinated, but this was very difficult to follow and she would do a ton of different excercises that are dance moves, then say to take it from the top, which was a ton of exercises you had to try and do in order.  She would remind you before the exercise what to do, but I didn't usually understand what moves she was talking about until she was basically done with the move.  Not enjoyable at all.

A big reason I picked this one too is because she was actually dressed, unlike some of her older videos where she looks like she's dressed like a Sports Illustrated model.  Another one of her newer videos she's doing exercises (saw a clip on youtube) and she's bending over showing her cleavage a lot.  This wasn't acceptable since I had hopes to play it while my kids were around and I have boys.  I was happy to say she was covered in this one, but the kids couldn't follow along and I didn't enjoy it at all.  She also kept talking about her boyfriend who was the bass player or singer or something.  I don't care about that and a lot of her comments were really annoying and talked about how another lady in the video was a matchmaker and the older guy in the video was single, etc.  Wish it was just about exercise and not her or other's personal lives.

So, I tried to return it on Amazon and since I'm a valued customer apparently, they let me return it and keep the money.  I never knew they did that sort of thing and was very happy about that, but I really don't want the video, but maybe can give it to someone else.  I went on ebay and found the old video I was looking for. It took a lot of google searching to find it since I couldn't remember the name at all.  It was her very first workout video apparently called Workout and it's from 1982.  This has exactly what I'm looking for and has 2 routines, 1 for beginners and 1 for advanced.  This really works on all the parts of your body and is pretty intense, but easy to follow along with from what I remember.  I have since ordered that and can't wait to get it and get to work.

Being 58 though the duwop  workout was way before my time so I would have liked more modern music. Maybe Jane will do a 1970's-90's version of good beat workouts?? (hint) I do like these workouts to get me back in shape.  Jane needs a little work on her cuing but it's not bad at all. I've seen worse cuing from Denise Austen and even from the Firm videos.  I'd like to see more cardio workouts from Jane.,1400889600,,495,4.135416666666667

You can also combine more than one workout session if you want to burn more or exercise different parts of your body.",1400371200,,403,4.315789473684211

I've been puzzling over how to get this dvd on to my Kindle so I can take it with me when I travel.  Has anyone out there done it?  Maybe Jane should think about a Kindle version?

Aside from that small matter:  I've now ordered a couple of other videos to try to get some variety in my daily workout and they really don't do the job -- not like this one does.  If you opt to do all of the workouts in succession, Jane keeps you on the move with very little down time.  I have to steal time to snatch a drink of water or to grab the towel.  In scanning some of the other reviews it's easy to see that finding the right match is a personal thing.  I have a lot of trouble with the Latin segment (no hip movement forthcoming) but I do it anyway (badly) and while Jane is doing leg stretches, I practice the balance exercise.  Like Jane, I've really improved my balance. All in all this dvd provides a very good cardio workout and I'd recommend it without hesitation.",1400198400,,1130,4.114155251141552

My first comment is that sometimes (not often) Ms. Fonda's foot timing is a bit off, but I've learned to watch the other exercisers in the group. Secondly, it would have been very helpful if she would have told the audience what steps she would be doing BEFORE she does the steps, not during the steps.

4688745,3,B005G4FFG4,"I've been a fan of Jane Fonda's exercise DVD's and videos for a long time. This one unfortunately is not one of my favorites.

On the plus side:

I loved the music in this one. It's all aerobic-type dancing on this DVD and the music is retro, funky and fun; provided by a live band on the set with Jane and her students. Nice touch.

The DVD includes a 5 minute warm-up, followed by three separate dance routines: Doo-Wop, Latin and Old-School Funk (each of these are 10 minutes)  followed by a 5 minute cool down to complete the workout.

All three workouts can be played together or a person can pick and choose which ones they want to do. The DVD plays separate sequences for each or all of them, if preferred. I appreciate that feature as it's annoying to have to keep going back to the main menu in some exercise DVD's to continue on to another routine.

The DVD also includes an optional 18 minute meditation segment.

What I didn't like about this DVD:

It didn't provide a strenuous enough workout to make it worthwhile. At the end of the 3 dance routines, I hadn't even come close to breaking a sweat. No ""burn"" here!

I got a bit bored with some of the dance moves. Rather ho-hum and repetitious.

I do think it would be OK for someone who is: just getting back to exercising, is rather out of shape and who enjoys routines that are mainly dance-type moves. And these aren't hard moves to master.

The meditation segment was a bit strange. It had some breathing suggestions that I do not agree with. Breathing through the mouth is a big no-no health-wise for so many reasons but that is part of this segment. What's with taking gulps of air through the mouth? Like I said, kind of strange and not relaxing either.

There is a mention of needing weights on the back of this DVD but they aren't used at all. Don't know why they included that.

I think Jane Fonda fell short (no pun intended) on this particular exercise DVD.

4688746,2,B005G4FFG4,I am around Jane's age so I knew it would be age appropriate.  I have had her vidoes in the past and knew it would be a good workout.  I think it is helpful as it is a thorough workout.,1380067200,,185,3.6
4688747,1,B005G4FFG4,I want my money back. The DVD would not advance past the introduction. Not much of a workout for me unless you like to sit on the couch!,1379808000,,136,3.892857142857143
4688748,5,B005G4FFG4,I don't like to go out to exercise and this makes it so easy to do at home at your own pace.,1379635200,,92,3.227272727272727
4688749,5,B005G4FFG4,I am 50 and have arthritis in my knees so I have to be careful with my exercise. I get a great workout with this video and it does not hurt my knees. It is so inspiring to Jane Fonda still making exercise videos in her 70's.,1379116800,,224,3.7872340425531914
4688750,5,B005G4FFG4,It is what it claims to be. I have earlier cds by Jane and this is different enough to hold your interest. I like that she uses other people exercising and a live band with it.,1378944000,,176,3.9166666666666665
4688751,5,B005G4FFG4,"I am 62, and first DVD I have bought that really give you good cardio, does not hurt your joints, and is easy to follow. Also it is fun,  The older Jane really knows how to help someone my age, and not hurt me.  So many say low impact, but I always end up hurting somewhere.  This is absolutely AWESOME.  I want her to make another one, just to mix things up a little.  Alot of the moves are the Zumba moves,but you do not get dizzy, or hurt your feet or knee's.  I tried Zumba loved it because i love to dance, but oh my, way too much for a 62 year old.  Needless to say I did not last with the Zumba very long.  I can see this being a long term routine for me.  I cannot imagine I would get bored with it.",1378684800,,707,3.787671232876712
4688762,5,B005G4FFG4,"I am 61 and work behind a desk all day. I have put on some pounds and was looking for a more enjoyable way to get them off. I have tried the diet routines, the walking etc. but I really need something more enjoyable if I am going to stick with it. It is low impact but gets the cardio workout in as well as the stretching and all to dance type steps which make it enjoyable to me.",1378684800,,380,3.8227848101265822
4688763,5,B005G4FFG4,"The music and dancing are fun.  I especially enjoy that it is apparently ok to have an individual style while at the same time doing the moves to great music.  Jane and the other participants appear to be having a good time, which is ""catching"" for me.  The time passes quickly and I know I've have a good workout because I check my heart rate.",1377648000,2,344,4.2615384615384615
4688764,2,B005G4FFG4,The music is terrible and the exercise is boring. Not enough variety in movement and I did not break a sweat.,1377302400,,109,4.238095238095238
4688765,5,B005G4FFG4,I actually had the same one previously& lost it. I like it because I am 73 & can still do  these exercises. excellent for even older people.,1377216000,,140,4.185185185185185
4688766,3,B005G4FFG4,It is just another one of those exercise video where you can't keep up until you learn the steps for the dances.,1376697600,2,112,4.136363636363637
4688767,5,B005G4FFG4,Jane is awesome.  I have followed over the years and she keeps me in shape.  The right amount of durance on everything.,1376611200,,119,4.363636363636363
4688768,5,B005G4FFG4,"I love this dance exercise, it was fun, easy to follow, and wow, I really felt it was better than a 5 mile walk..which I have routinely done.. so, this is a keeper!  I would love to see more.. I am over 55 and really needed this ... where I live its too hot to walk in the summer, this ends up being the best buy for me .. ever... thanks for prime time jane !!",1375488000,,360,3.736842105263158
4688769,4,B005G4FFG4,"I have enjoyed using this cardio workout.  It can be played in sections, so you can leave out or add in extra workouts sections to customize.  Recommended for those who do not require high energy and jumping to keep cardio up.",1375401600,,226,4.487804878048781
4688770,5,B005G4FFG4,"After nearly killing myself attempting Zumba, I checked this DVD out from the library. I liked it so much, I decided to make it part of my daily exercise routine and buy it..I have arthritis in multiple joints, so I cannot do lunges, squats etc., but I can do these dance steps without pain. I like the pace(not as fast or complicated as zumba). Most of the dance routines give a total body workout. The other people in Jane's class look like real humans at various fitness levels, so not everyone is perfect in looks or dancing. I like that too.. Also, Jane is good at reminding the viewer of proper form throughout. Now if only I was as graceful as Jane: )",1375056000,,658,4.357723577235772
4688771,4,B005G4FFG4,"I tested this training on You Tube and like what I saw, so I bought the DVD.
The price was Perfect, the time of delivery was Perfect, and the DVD was Close to Perfect.
I Had some problems With my CD-player - and was not not able to play it because of error With the Country Code.

I do like Jane Fondas training, she is a woman somewhat older than me - and this makes it easier for mye to follow the training.",1374969600,,409,3.927710843373494
4688782,5,B005G4FFG4,"jane fonda was a head of the class back in the 80's with fitness and exercise.  She is still one of the BEST instructors on the market today.  She explains things simply, demonstrates correct posture, movement, offers alternatives, and these workouts can be done by anyone, any age, any pain level, and any fitness level.

Great for beginners, for those days where something ""less intense"" is wanted... sometimes ""less is more""... (less shouting, less jumping, less complex routines).... the basic, old fashioned, standard of quality vs quantity...  The time flies, and after you feel taller, and more energized.",1374796800,,612,5.214285714285714
4688783,4,B005G4FFG4,"I love to dance.  Each segment could be longer.  My favorite dances are the Latin and the Old School Funk, but I'm just getting started when they end.",1374192000,,150,4.321428571428571
4688784,5,B005G4FFG4,"This video is super helpful!!!! I love it  because it funny, clear, easy to follow, it is not hard.
I always used because it is fun and the same time  make  me feel strong all day",1374105600,,179,3.9166666666666665
4688785,2,B005G4FFG4,Not enough to it.  Good warm up and cool down - but 10 minutes with few weights are not enough.  Hope Jane makes a 30 minutes workout with weights for over 60 year old women.,1373760000,,174,3.942857142857143
4688786,5,B005G4FFG4,"This is an enjoyable workout program for people who want to want to be more fit without injuring themselves.  I alternate using this with doing Wii Fit strength training exercises, biking, and going to a local gym.  It's a good set of exercises to do the day after my more strenuous gym workout routine.  The cha cha portion of Latin segment causes me some discomfort as I have a bum knee.  But overall, I find that Fonda understands the exercise needs of older women.",1373500800,,468,4.535714285714286
4688787,3,B005G4FFG4,I had a difficult time trying to follow the movements in this video. I will have to work up th this one.,1372809600,,104,3.772727272727273
4688788,5,B005G4FFG4,"Finally, I found a low impact aerobic workout that doesn't make me fear a heart attack!  The pace is perfect and I get a great workout that is fun and makes me feel energized.  Jane talks you through the whole thing and the movements are easy to follow.  I'm not the most coordinated person but I'm able to follow most of the moves pretty easily.  I highly recommend this!",1372723200,,372,4.3478260869565215
4688789,5,B005G4FFG4,"Jane Fonda looks great, gives good instructions and is still way up there in my opinion.  This is a good product.",1372464000,,113,4.380952380952381
4688790,5,B005G4FFG4,"I choose this product because, I want to work out, but according to my age, and Jane Fonda made it easy. The video tutorial  is well explained and easy to follow, I highly recommend this product to anybody that wants to get in shape while also having fun!!!!!  :-D",1372291200,,264,4.36734693877551
4688791,4,B005G4FFG4,"I really love Jane Fonda but I must say this is not my favorite.  This is much more of an aerobic workout, nothing with weights, but somehow I had the idea that it included exercises with weights.  I had an old VHS yoga tape by her and also have another workout video that is about 5 years old and I do like both of those better.  She gives two levels of workout on this one which is really good.  I was surprised that my heartbeat was getting up there, even with it being low impact.  Some of the music is not so great.  DooWop and the Jazz, I wasn't wild about, but the Latin and the last part (think it's rock) was good.  Even though it is low impact, my back was kind of hurting after the first workout.  So, if you have lower back issues like me, take it easy with this one until you build up your muscle strength.",1371945600,,819,4.043478260869565
4688792,4,B005G4FFG4,I use this workout every week. I think I will tell all my friends to try it. I got all her workout now.,1371340800,,103,3.5217391304347827
4688793,3,B005G4FFG4,Unfortunately I haven't been able to play the entire dvd on my 3-in-1 TV. I can't get past the warm-up. My remote doesn't have arrows and so I have no way of advancing the dvd to the other exercise segments. I'm currently trying to figure out what to do. It's too bad because the warm-up is excellent. I like Jane and I have enjoyed her exercise tapes in the past.,1370390400,,364,4.214285714285714
4688794,5,B005G4FFG4,I just received this today in the mail and decided to give it a try. I'm 55 years old and need to shed unwanted pounds for my son's upcoming wedding next summer. This is just right for someone my age and it definitely gets your heartbeat up and makes you sweat. You can do all 3 of the dance sessions or just one. There is a warm-up and also a cool down. I did the warm up and two of the dance sessions and then the cool down. I was sweaty and out of breath. It was fun and low impact. I highly recommend for any beginner who wants to get in shape and have fun doing it.,1369872000,,570,3.8389830508474576
4688795,3,B005G4FFG4,"I should look as good as Jane at her age.

I found this video easy to follow and not terribly difficult, which is good as I am just beginning to use tapes for toning and weight loss.",1369440000,,182,3.918918918918919
4688796,5,B005G4FFG4,Jane Fonda is even more inspiring in her latest series of workouts for older adults or anyone easing back into an exercise program.,1369267200,,131,4.739130434782608
4688797,5,B005G4FFG4,"These routine's are really good for geting back in shape from a sedetary lifestyle. I was looking for something with low impact as
my knee's and hip are not what they used to be. I am turning 62 this year and have not done regular excercise for about the last 15 years or so. All the excercises are low impact and can be adjusted to less intense or more intense as you progress. Each routine is around 20 - 25 minutes long so you don't have to spend a lot of time doing them, and you have the option of doing only one routine or adding the other routine's. I started out doing one routine only and this was enough to leave me a little breathless but not overly uncomfortable, I have now advanced to doing two routines in succession. I have since purchased Jane Fonda's Walk Out DVD, which I also enjoy doing.",1369008000,3,808,4.253246753246753
4688798,5,B005G4FFG4,If you like to dance - you will like this work-out. Jane is so much fun and so very cute! The tunes are catchy and the moves are easy to get. You feel like you are in a small dance team. She pushes you in a gentle way. Times flies when you are doing it too. My favorite one so far!,1368576000,2,281,3.622950819672131
4688799,2,B005G4FFG4,This video did not meet my expectations. Jane Fonda has done some good videos in the past but this is not one of them.  I would not recommend it.,1368576000,,145,4.0
4688800,1,B005G4FFG4,Did not like the DVD the description was not valid and i hate it . would like to return this item ASAP,1368144000,,102,3.6818181818181817
4688801,4,B005G4FFG4,"This is great for people who are either new to aerobic exercise, are older or are working toward a healthy comeback.  My only criticism of this video is that a few of Jane's video group have no musicality at all.  You will get lost if you watch some of these folks.  The younger woman (an attorney) on the right in the blue top looks very fit, but can not follow the beat of the music.  Jane gets off beat a little as well.  But after you have done the exercises a couple of times and are familiar with the moves, you'll be ok.",1367625600,2,527,4.077669902912621
4688812,5,B005G4FFG4,"The best on the market for us older folks,  Jane  has done a good job for many years and is still doing it today.  Go Girl  !!!  thanks for encourage us oldies to keep moving  highly recommed this to all who want to stay active and have fun doing it.",1367539200,3,250,3.9
4688813,5,B005G4FFG4,"This is where I started my new exercise routine.  I could manage all the moves, but felt those muscles that hadn't been worked for a while.

Thanks, Jane, you make exercising for the mature easy and, for the most part, painless.  By day two the muscles were getting in line and my dresses are looking better.",1366761600,,308,4.464285714285714
4688814,5,B005G4FFG4,"I LOVE this DVD!  It gives me a GREAT workout, though none of the moves are strenuous. It always leaves me feeling energized rather than exhausted.  There is so much variety in this workout that it never becomes boring.  The moves are perfectly synchronized to the wonderful music.  I highly recommend this product!",1366243200,5,315,4.886792452830188
4688815,5,B005G4FFG4,Ms. Fonda understands me.  Her pace and power are just right.  I recommend this workout for every couch potato out there.,1365984000,2,121,4.714285714285714
4688816,5,B005G4FFG4,I have already written my review on this. This video is pretty good for anyone who likes low impact aerobics.,1365984000,,109,4.5
4688817,1,B005G4FFG4,thought this was a waste of time. I could do without her political stances and views and disrespect of veterans.,1365811200,,112,4.65
4688818,4,B005G4FFG4,"Advance cuing for the next moves are missing on this DVD.  Otherwise, very good.  Make larger movements towork up a sweat. Preview this before doing.  Can program segments for short to long workout.",1365292800,,198,4.9393939393939394
4688819,5,B005G4FFG4,"I am 64 and new to exercise dvds. I have purchased a variety in the past 6 months and find that I exercise to Jane Fonda's more than any others. ""Firm & Burn"" provides a very good workout when I have the energy for it. ""Walk Out"" is less intense. ""AM PM Yoga"" and ""Fit & Strong"" are my choice at the end of the work week when energy is low. ""Trim, Tone and Flex"" is also good. I enjoy Jane's low keyed style, advice on health issues and choice of music. I used to have to force myself to exercise and now look forward to it. If Jane keeps creating exercise dvds, I will continue buying them.",1364688000,17,591,4.016949152542373
4688820,5,B005G4FFG4,"Jane, thank you so much for making three great video's for the 50 + woman.
4 years ago I had back surgery and after I recovered I was unable to find a workout
that I could do without causing me pain.
Your DVD's are great, Firm and Burn is a good aerobic workout at a perfect pace with
easy to learn and follow steps. My heart beat ranges 134 to 155 for the 50 min workout
and I burn 581 calories.
Trim Tone and Flex is great because I can do the workout and go off on my day without
having to shower and do hair (no sweat) but I still feel I get a good weight workout.
AM/PM Yoga is great also, I hope you will be expanding this yoga searies with more
 video's and poses.
You are such an inspiration and I strive to look as great as you do.",1364169600,4,740,3.8684210526315788
4688821,5,B005G4FFG4,Enjoyed the music and the 10 minute segments...much lateral movement which was hard for my injured leg...will return to the workout once my leg is fully healed...,1364083200,2,162,5.037037037037037
4688832,4,B005G4FFG4,"I bought this DVD instead of joining a gym to save money. After several sessions, I was very bored with her comments and the steps. Joined a gym.",1363305600,,145,4.214285714285714
4688833,5,B005G4FFG4,Never to late to start and this is a great way to start back into the exercise mode. I have had definite improvement in my hip mobility.,1363219200,2,136,4.074074074074074
4688834,5,B005G4FFG4,I buy a lot of dvd;s and they all seem to be shipped within a day or two of ordering. They almost all seem to work well and this dvd was good on both counts.,1363132800,,157,3.5142857142857142
4688835,2,B005G4FFG4,"I also purchased Jane's AM/PM yoga which is great.  The firm and burn DVD pales in comparison, I couldn't take Jane's verbiage seriously, I'm in my fifties but I felt years younger watching and listening to the workout.  It was funky!!!  It's not my thing, but I'm sure other people love it.",1362960000,,291,4.5576923076923075
4688836,4,B005G4FFG4,"This exercise video is great for older folks like me who like to workout without overdoing.  The only thing I didn't care for was the time lapse between dance segments.  to be really aerobic, you must continue moving.",1362873600,,217,4.684210526315789
4688837,5,B005G4FFG4,I have been really enjoying Jane Fonda's workout video and find it very useful and enjoyable.  The music as well as the interaction between the people she uses in her video bring a whole new level of energy and fun to low impact cardio. I have given this video as a gift with a good response!,1362182400,,292,4.214285714285714
4688838,5,B005G4FFG4,I really enjoy working out with Jane Fonda.  I've been her fans for many years when she had her VHS workout in  the 80's and 90's. The reason I like Jane Fonda and Leslie Sansone's vedio's are that they workout with you. Makes you feel like they are right there as a team. They don't give instructions and walk around like they're sargents. This video is fun and I like dancing to all three different type of music. Dancing is the best ways to burn calories and stay fit.,1362182400,,471,4.280898876404494
4688839,5,B005G4FFG4,Easy and very motivational CD Finally a workout for people over 55 years of age.  I use these CD's weekly and there is a whole set.,1362182400,,131,4.038461538461538
4688840,3,B005G4FFG4,I'm 60 and want to get in shape.  I love Jane Fonda and her workouts.  I found the workout to be fun and easy but I don't have time to spend an hour to do it.  Two 30 minute workouts would have been better for me.,1361836800,,213,3.5869565217391304
4688841,3,B005G4FFG4,This is a little too impact for me but Jane does make it interesting to follow along. Maybe I'll use it again in 10 years.,1361491200,,122,3.92
4688852,5,B005G4FFG4,It has great music as it has a live band.  One of my favorite ones is Old School Rock where you do the John Travolta move from Saturday night Live and then the move from the movie Pulp Fiction,1360972800,,192,3.923076923076923
4688853,4,B005G4FFG4,I am 64 and love this cardio..I can't do zumba because of back problems and this cardio has different dance styles to keep you enthused and also keeps ya hummin' to do a lil sweatin'...,1360540800,2,185,4.314285714285714

4688855,5,B005G4FFG4,This a great dvd for the older generation because it doesn t burn you out so that you will not do it again.,1360281600,,107,3.6956521739130435
4688856,5,B005G4FFG4,I bought this for myself and it works great.  Some of the other exercise places and videos just were not for me.,1360281600,,112,4.090909090909091
4688857,4,B005G4FFG4,This vodeo is fun and a little too easy for me so if you have been working out for years get a more difficult one. I still use it because it is fun. I do it all and that takes about 30 minutes.,1360281600,,193,3.511627906976744
4688858,5,B005G4FFG4,"Started using the dvd & saw a difference right away. Have been losing 1-2 pounds every week along with moderate diet changes. Jane is always reliable, so is Amazon.",1360195200,,164,4.689655172413793

By dancing and doing the meditation.
If you are used to workout a lot and do intense exercises, then this DVD is not for you, but if you are just getting started, or like my mom, has difficulties doing high impact or intense workouts, and you want something to burn calories, tone your body and for it to be fun, then I recomend this program 100%.

That is the strategic I planned due to my physical conditions, and I can feel the result. Again, I have physical limitations but a very open mind and the will of improving my life in different areas since, in my believe, the best is still coming (Joel Osteen and Wayne W.

I selected the full 40 minutes of workout time on each video and realized how out of shape I was. Firm & Burn Low Impact Cardio was the toughest. Perspiration was running down the sides of my face along with a full body sweat. Phew! Trim Tone & Flex truly works most muscles in the upper and lower body. I can tell which muscles are the strongest or weakest. I am definitely on my way to a healthier me.
Thanks Jane for thinking of people that are really out of shape or need to bounce back from a health issue! These videos fit both.

I recommend this workout for anyone, really, but especially for those who can no longer do squats, lunges and iron aerobics.  It is fun and effective.

4688916,3,B005G4FFG4,"This is the second CD by Jane Fonda I purchased.  I'm using it to limited degree for some change to the first, but the first (Walk Out) is far better overall for my interests.

A plus with this CD is the setting is an exercise studio as contrasted with a made-up living room in the other CD.  In this one, I also liked her selection of a small number of diverse people (ages, genders, body types) to participate in the routines as would be found in a class and that she introduced them. Of added interest is a small live combo playing the music which she introduces during the first exercise set in general terms (no one by name).  They are a group led by someone she is dating which led to some fun comments.  I wondered why they weren't also introduced - maybe  a  contract issue or some such thing.

Finally this CD has little unnecessary patter. In the  Walk Out CD, because I use it routinely, at times I find Fonda's comments irritating over time(do we really need to keep hearing about all the diseases we can get if we don't use it?) so I turn down the sound completely.

There are three exercise sets here.  The first is with two back-to-back music segments described as Doo Wop.  I've had little exposure to that music but thought it was energizing and excellent for the exercise set.

The second set is Latin music which is just not to my taste and the third is something she termed as ""Old School Funk"".  Admittedly, much of this review has to with personal preferences; however, I found the latter set so mild and the music just ""OK"" that I went through it only twice before I rated it as boring. Then, because Latin music isn't something I enjoy, I rarely use that segment although the beat and the routines were fine.

Just wish she could take the best of both and have some stronger variations in a couple of sets as in the Walk Out CD.  In my view, that would be a big winner.",1333324800,4,1893,4.3201133144475925

Ms. Fonda is showing you dance moves and telling you to feel the rhythm and have fun, but I can't hear the music.  I have found this on other instructors' work out tapes also, you can't hear the music.

cool down.  After doing this for a few days, I then added on the other dances one at a time
which took about 3 weeks. I can now do the entire tape whenever I feel like doing so. The best part
is that you can design your own workout.  Many times in the evening after sitting just watching

I have found that it is easy to exercise if you find something you like to do. The dvd is upbeat and Jane offers good advice. I also like that she admits where her challanges are.

Being able to do short or longer sessions is a big help in getting started, at this point I am doing the warm up, the first exercize session and then cool down.
I can slow my pace whenever I want and speed up when I feel I'm able too. With time and sticking to it I hope to be able to complete the whole session which is a goal to shoot for.

I find the exercises quite energetic and suggest that it may be well for seniors to begin at a slower pace, perhaps with some Tai Chi sessions and then work up to the ""Firm & Burn"" DVD. Jane is very clear in her directions. I love the DVD and my body says ""Thank You"" after each exercise session.

4688947,5,B005G4FFG4,"I have always done the Jane Fonda workouts when I and she were younger.  I was involved in a horrible wreck that injured my entire spine and makes it hard for me to even move.  When I saw that she came out with a new slower way of working out, I knew I had to get them all.  I like her calm voice. She is great at constantly telling you how to keep your form and that if your balance is not good (like mine) that it's o.k. to hold onto something so that you don't fall.  I am doing better with her workouts than I did with a Physical Therapist that I was paying $40.00 per 1 hour session 3 times a week.  I can finally move without completely feeling crippled. I love, love, love Jane Fonda and only hope I look as good as her at her age.  I used to look like that before my accident and know that she will get me back to that shape!  She's great!

I lost that weight over the past 6 months by walking 10,000 steps a day on my treadmill.  Boring but effective.  Santa brought this tape and I just completed it for the first time.  Fun and doable in spite of my 61 year old body.  In the extras Jane provides a 10 minute meditation with breathing exercises.  Wonderful!

Younger exercisers may not find this to be difficult enough but there are lots of Programs for them.  This tape is perfect for those of us who are looking to stay fit and fabulous in our ""Third Act"" and beyond.",1325462400,54,625,4.15
4688955,3,B005G4FFG4,"I have never been a dancer. However, dancing always looked fun, and I wanted to try this DVD thinking that since it's designed for the ""older"" generation, there might be detailed instructions on the steps and proper form.
While Jane Fonda DOES do a good job of explaining the steps and reminding us of our posture, she is doing so AS SHE IS PERFORMING the routine.
I would like to have seen a section of the DVD devoted to explaining each step -- slowly -- with proper form explained.
Oh, I'm sure that with time I'll get better; however, since this was supposed to be designed for an older generation, I would think that teaching the steps and proper form to avoid an injury would have been of utmost importance.
Also, she says, ""From the top"" quite a bit and I can't figure out what the ""top"" is because I was so focused on getting the steps down and keeping proper posture that I couldn't remember where we started.
Again, I'm sure I'll get better with time and may come to enjoy this DVD more. If so, I'll revise my review and up the stars. But, for now, I think it's only worth 3 stars.",1325030400,47,1091,4.326829268292683

She shows the steps very well and by the end of the whole dvd i felt i had a great workout.  I am 64 and have arthritis and was able to do this.  I highly recommend for people in their 60's.,1324339200,14,328,3.9242424242424243
4688958,5,B005G4FFG4,"I used to love doing aerobics and jazzercize, but I've found that too many dance-related DVDs require a bigger learning curve than I want to commit to. Much of it is hip-hop or Latin, the instructors rush you through the instructions, and I worry that I'll hurt myself as I try to keep up with steps that sometimes don't seem very healthy to start with. (Granted, I could master them if I stuck with it, but I have a big collection of exercise DVDs, and I rarely do the same one twice in a row.)

I love Leslie Sansone, but sometimes I just want a little more variety.

I've only done the warmup and the first routine here so far. I found Jane's workout to have more in common with Leslie's DVDs than the usual dance ones because it's easy to follow and uses some of the same basic moves. However, there are some fun variations, too. There's enough repetition that you can zone out to a degree (which I think is important for stress relief), but then she changes it up, so you do need to keep on your toes.

I anticipate using this DVD often as a break from the walking DVDs.

And having a live band on premises is a fun change from the other workouts!",1318809600,243,1152,4.2465753424657535
