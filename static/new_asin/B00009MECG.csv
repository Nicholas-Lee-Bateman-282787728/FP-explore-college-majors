1884220,5,B00009MECG,"Years ago I had the VHS version of this delightful film.  Many playings (and mucho ganja) engraved this gem on my brain. So what happened? I gave it to a friend who returned it without the slipcase.  Then I accidentally left it near a heat source reducing the tape to unplayable garbage.  I searched high and low for a new copy. Today I just happened to think about it and here it is on DVD! Hooray for Countryman. A big up! Buy it, enjoy it, and go native with a Red Stripe or some lambsbread so you can understand the dialog. Right on.",1137024000,,537,4.194174757281553
1884221,3,B00009MECG,"For serious fans of Reggae, Rasta, Jamaica and natural mysticism Countryman is well worth viewing. Unfortunately the plot and style is kitsch '70s, a little B grade even.

What saves it is the wicked Reggae, the heart warming Rasta community and the funky shamanic magic of Countryman himself. Countryman is a groovy natural mystic. There is some good acting from some of the Jamaicans and some appaling acting from the two white actors!",1126396800,5,437,4.986301369863014
1884222,4,B00009MECG,"Having had the VHS and soundtrack album for many years I was pleased to find the DVD on a recent trip to the US. I was saddened to see, or rather hear, that a lot of the Jamaican English has been re-dubbed to make it more understandable. I had no problem understanding the VHS version I had from the UK. I don't know if this is a US/UK change or a DVD/VHS change, either way it is unwelcome and not needed.

Other than that...great film",1113955200,22,436,4.129411764705883
1884223,5,B00009MECG,"The Raw Rasta missed out! The A/V is much better on the DVD. I had the VHS, but just gave it to a friend since getting the DVD. And if you watch the Featurette, you're in for a big surprise!
IRIE!",1060041600,4,196,3.8048780487804876
1884224,4,B00009MECG,"If you're into Rastafarianism, Reggae (5-star soundtrack, Bob Marley, etc.), and/or seek to explore the cultural dichotomy of rural Jamaican life juxtaposed against the oppression of the city and the government, 'Countryman' is a buzz. In vague brief, it's the story of two American plane crash victims who are rescued and then further aided by a rasta fisherman while they are being hunted by desparate Jamaican authorities for bogus political reasons. There is a mystical element that will bring you great satisfaction if you tend to favor underdogs in struggles against repression and brutality. For those who have had the experience of the spleef, be prepared to smile and nod knowingly during the ""dinner"" scene.
I dropped the fifth star only because of the poorly scripted and acted military scenes. Some people may have difficulty understanding the patois or ""duck"" English typical of Jamaicans. Also, I can't speak to the DVD quality as I have only seen the video version. I have reviewed the video version because the DVD has not yet been released and there were no other reviews of the film. But I can say that I've watched this film many times (having finally tracked down a copy of the video after several years of searching) and I can think of no better recommendation than that - and no better reason to suggest that you get your own copy.
The lesson line: ""First, you have to have that intention.""

1884249,5,B00009MECG,"If you like Jamaica (or ganja culture), you'll love this film.  You might just like it anyway, the main actor (the guy running on the cover) has just a natural and charming style, it's really a wonderful respite from the Hollywood formula...",1430611200,,241,4.738095238095238
1884250,5,B00009MECG,"Another Jamaican classic with a tribute to Bob Marley and other reggae artists. The storyline takes place at a time when Jamaicans were dealing with a social/political revolution and where America likely had provocateurs infiltrating Jamaica. It gets a bit hokey at times, but I would recommend it!",1426464000,,298,5.229166666666667

Over all a good family movie besides the white woman showing her bare chest , which was the only woman in the movie by the way, lol.

The ppl of the community were so beautiful.",1420934400,,334,3.911764705882353

1884295,5,B00009MECG,So far been really fun along with helpfull. I origanly got it so that my wife could access etc. That takes away the time we spend together. Our Fun is all the way of the house. Often I found it isolated. This smart thing has allowed us along with myself less restricted or confined to the back on which it displays  me. I have never even manipulated a befor. I always thought they were veryi limited and could not perform the average tasks. However I have been proven wrong. Surfing !!!!,1354320000,,487,4.351648351648351
1884296,1,B00009MECG,"First, real Rastas don't eat scavenger sea life like lobsters, but there it was in this movie getting scarfed.  Rastas are vegetarians.  And what was with the owl, it ended up dead near the end of the movie, and it looked like a REAL dead owl!  Did they murder that majestic bird to make this movie? The headless dead chicken was real, did they kill that too for the movie?  Where was the animal respect in this movie that Rastas practice?  I had high hopes for this movie, I'm really sorry that I even watched it.",1343952000,,514,4.3125
1884297,3,B00009MECG,"This is a favorite old movie of mine that has been unavailable for some time as it was on VHS. Now available on DVD it is welcome, however, the quality is a little lacking. It looked like it was coppies from the VHS, not from the movie. It is ultimatly watchable but in this day of blueray discs it is a little rough!!",1340668800,,318,4.063492063492063
1884298,5,B00009MECG,"Spliffs, nudity, religion, good and evil, some laughs, a few serious spots, and the SOUNDTRACK make this a good purchase.  By no means is it academy award winning but 2 hours not wasted IMHO.",1329264000,,191,4.617647058823529
1884299,3,B00009MECG,"If something was good in this movie, it is Countryman himself, his physics and general appearing.

A story of drug-smugglers saved miraculously by an indigenous fisherman-witch for a reason to stuff off brutal authorities, probably.

It is an informative work of Jamaica, sexy also no sex, neither much music nor factotum but a poor countryman in nice Speedos and some money-bribery in a lap.",1317168000,,392,5.109375
1884300,5,B00009MECG,"This excellent movie often suffers from being misunderstood and (literally) misinterpreted - you're better off listening to the words than trying to read the subtitles, for example; some of them are quite far off.
Additionally, try to make sure you're buying the original version of the audio.  Word is they dubbed over the original later to make it easier to understand.

In my opinion, Countryman is one of the best movies to come out of Jamaica in its generation.

Contrary to the official description on this page, the American couple, played by Hiram Keller and Kristina St. Clair, are guilty only of taking her father's plane without permission (and crashing it into a swamp), not smuggling ganja or gun running.  The weapons charge is invented by the Colonel of the JDF (Jamaican Defence Force) in order to justify disrupting the approaching general election.

Get this movie!

Peace.",1291593600,,891,5.0272108843537415
1884301,5,B00009MECG,I loved this movie. Yes it is old but it still contains issues that we can relate to now in 2010.  I like the whole good being triumpthant over evil theme.  I liked all of the music that they had in it.  Lost of Bob Marley.  You can't help but love the main character.,1266796800,,268,3.9074074074074074
1884302,5,B00009MECG,"This movie is partially the story of how the rastafarian way of living saved two people and opened them up to such a great love that they shared it with the rest of the world- but they don't really talk about that in the movie. The movie carries the message that all obstacles can be overcome through true, open hearted, unconditional love- and that life is more than most of us think.",1265760000,,385,4.361111111111111
1884303,4,B00009MECG,"So happy to see this finally come to dvd. I remember seeing this on Vhs when I was a young girl. I hated to see they had to add subtitles that were not quite true in translation. The moive is not hard to understand if you are realy paying attention. They are so many moives to watch, The Lunatic, Smile orange, Shottas, Klash, Third World cop, Dancehall Queen, and Belly.  Any body know where I can get The Lunatic ? please let me know. I have seen it once in the UK and Have the book.",1216771200,,485,4.052083333333333
1884314,5,B00009MECG,"Countryman is a glimpse into the world of a small fishing village in Jamaica. Its based on the the life of the main actor in the movie, with a hollywood twist to make it more interesting. While its not the most rasta movie out there, you can't help but love countryman. Really a classic reggae film.",1209081600,,299,4.357142857142857
1884315,5,B00009MECG,This movie endears the viewer with visuals and a philosophy that lasts a lifetime.  I can not express how happy I am to find it on DVD.  Buy it.  Share it with friends.,1206316800,,168,4.03030303030303
1884316,5,B00009MECG,"I have seen both of the movie original and new re-edited one. The first is really good but, due to time it became worn. The re-edited one is respect due! It is better in that you see it as it should be seen. I found it to be REspect due!!",1206230400,,238,3.78
1884317,5,B00009MECG,"This is an excellent movie that depicts true Rasta culture.  This is Jamaica's finest Export, second only to the Marley Dynasty of course.  Great soundtrack and awesome plot.

1884322,5,B00009MECG,"For any reggae lovers, this movie, will give you an understanding of the reggae music and what the words of bob marley and many other greats meant. The music played during scenes in the movie is what gives you the appreciation and understanding of the reggae music we all love. Great movie to check out and to add to your movie collection.

1884323,5,B00009MECG,I had seen Countryman on its original cinema release but couldn't rememeber much. having eveolved artistically my self watching it now made it far more enjoyable. especially appreciating the difficulties of getting a film done in Jamaica. the story it self is nothing great but the film on a whole captures and incredible and very true life that makes this film a must have for a DVD collection of Jamaican films.,1174780800,,413,4.830985915492958
7991421,5,B00009MECG,This is a great film.  I loved it when it came out in the early 80's and it's still great today.  If you like reggae you will enjoy the soundtrack.  It broke my heart to read of Countryman's death last year . . .we were the same age.  It depicts the culture and politics of Jamaica in those days with a fantasy adventure and the classic battle between good and evil.  Countryman's personality as the Rasta super-hero and the music are what make it a classic.,1507593600,,458,4.27906976744186
7991422,2,B00009MECG,"I was very disappointed with this version, technically. Hence the two stars. It is 4:3 aspect ratio and poor soundtrack quality, with lack of bass. I have had the movie on VHS, once, and also have the CD & LP soundtrack. I saw it in the cinema, when it was released. I remember it as widescreen, though (?). This edition is very low-res, bad sound quality and VHS-like. Thats a shame!",1502668800,,384,4.422535211267606
