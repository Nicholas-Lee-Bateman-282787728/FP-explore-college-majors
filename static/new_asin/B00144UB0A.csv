8254384,1,B00144UB0A,I rented this movie from netflix. I tried playing the dvd and i couldn't believe you cant skip the commercials. It plays the whole advertising all throughout the dvd before the movie. I was so annoyed i didn't even bother watching it. You cant control the dvd at all. No forwards and cant even stop it. It would only let you eject the dvd so i did. Everytime i rent a filipino movie there is also this reelplus commercial that you cant get rid of. I won't even bother renting another filipino movie just because of these annoying advertisements.,1362528000,,545,4.515151515151516
