7879538,1,6304898592,We have two other videos from this series that I love.  That's why I was so disappointed in the SHAPES video.  The references to the shapes are just too vague.  The pacing it also too slow.  I would highly recommend the NUMBERS and ANIMALS videos from this series.  My 20 month old loves them and can now recognize his numbers from 1-10 and can say all the animal names.  My 4 year old will even watch these!,1134518400,,408,4.233766233766234
7879539,2,6304898592,"This video focuses on circles, triangles, ovals, squares, diamonds and hearts.  For circle they show bubbles, balloons, hula hoops, rings, balls, a circle shape inside a flower, etc.  The music is really good. There's a part where the kids are playing at the playground and you (the viewer) are supposed to look around and see what shapes you see.  I could have done without this.

One reviewer said the video showed the shape and then had kids playing but that it had nothing to do with the shape.  I don't really understand that comment.  I thought they showed lots of things with each shape.  There is a section where kids are stacking foam blocks and it takes *forever*.  It's at least 5 minutes long (maybe this is what that reviewer was referring to?).  It's way too long for a baby or toddler (even a parent) to sit and watch kids playing with blocks for 5 minutes.  That segment seems to go on and on and then this is followed by another really long segment with toys of different shapes.  These long drawn-out parts could have easily been edited in length (edited out would have even been better).

This is the first volume in the Baby's First Impressions series so maybe they didn't really know what they were doing for their first video.  It seems like there is just way too much ""filler"" in this and it can get *really* boring fast.  I think Baby Brainy's Shapes & Colors is better and even Baby Einstein's Baby Newton Discovering Shapes would be a better choice.  I have left reviews on all of these plus all of the other Baby's First Impressions videos.",1116288000,,1567,4.546428571428572
7879540,1,6304898592,"I purchased the Baby's First Impressions Encyclapedia last week for my 2yo son. So far he likes almost every video in it except for this one and the opposites (I also bought Bumblebee Kids Opposites but he just doesn't seem to care about up/down, in/out right now).

My son's a late-talker so I bought these videos trying to help speed things along. I must say I like the Small Fry line of videos (we own Talking hands and 6/8 Brainy Baby DVDs) so I was floored when I watched this one. The idea of teaching shapes in THIS video is this: Circle. Then they'd show babies with puppies and babies and kids playing but NOTHING else about circles. My son walked off and started playing with his tool bench! In Brainy Baby Shapes and colors they'd teach them like this: Circle. This coin is circle. The orange is circle. Do you see any circles? Yes, this clock is circle etc.

If you actually want your child to learn his/her shapes I'd suggest Brainy Baby Shapes and Colors. My son watches that video over and over again and now knows alot of his colors because of it. Plus, it goes beyond black white and blue, it teaches other colors like silver and gold. I'd suggest skipping this video and Vol. 7 - Sounds (unless your child is under 18m). The rest of the videos are terrific and I'd highly recommend them!",1095292800,,1305,4.433333333333334
7879541,5,6304898592,"Video teaches children the circle, square, rectangle, and triangle with different styles of music, objects, and lots of live children playing.  My 18 month old learned her shapes in less than a week from watching this.  We  suggest adding the rest of the videos to your collection, too.",919641600,,286,4.916666666666667
