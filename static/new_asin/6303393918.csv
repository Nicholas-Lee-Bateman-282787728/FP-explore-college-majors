639501,3,6303393918,"very enjoyable escapist saturday afternoon old technicolor flick. ""routine"" is also what Leonard Maltin has termed this movie but i agree with someone online at Amazon that says he can be a snob at times. I enjoy certain 2 and 3 star films as much as some of the highly lauded ones and this falls into that category. If u like the old western good guys against the bad decently done this will fit the bill superbly",1125446400,14,414,4.3896103896103895
639502,2,6303393918,"In Santa Fe, Scott plays an ex-Confederate soldier who ends up working for the expanding Santa Fe railroad. His brothers, who also served with him in the War, are still angry at the Union, and develop their own band of outlaws who are determine to make the Union pay for the suffering of the South. Scott is caught between his own flesh and blood and his desire to help build the railroad as it stretches through the Western wilderness.

Scott is entertaining as always, and there's some decent action in Santa Fe, but this is only an okay film.",1122940800,9,545,4.505050505050505

639571,3,6303393918,"OK, disclaimer. I have a positive bias toward Randolph Scott's westerns. He always gives a fine performance, some better than others, and I always enjoys his films. He's somewhere between Cary Cooper and John Wayne in the western pantheon -- a rare talent.

Here he shoulders the load of the film doing what he can with the material at hand. It's not a *great* film but it *is* a very enjoyable one, given the limitations of the story. This is one of the early Scott-Brown films and I think they're just getting into stride. It's an interesting story that moves along at a good pace, so break out the popcorn and enjoy!

Three and half stars and recommended. I'm glad to own a DVD of this film and thank Columbia for releasing it!",1294358400,,730,4.481203007518797
639572,3,6303393918,"The four Canfield brothers - Britt (Randolph Scott), Clint (John Archer), Tom (Peter Thompson) and Terry (Jerome Courtland) - are making their way west just after the Civil War. Oldest brother Britt is trying to help his more hot-headed younger siblings keep the peace, but it doesn't work very well when they are taunted in a saloon in Kansas, and end up killing a soldier. On the run from the law, they assume new names and by happenstance are soon working on the Santa Fe railroad on it's march west to build the Transcontinental Railroad. Britt finds a sympathetic friend in an ex-Union officer he had fought against, Dave Baxter (Warner Anderson) and soon becomes his right-hand man, acting as a troubleshooter against Indians, drink and gambling that threaten to slow down the progress of the railroad, which is on a race against time to get to the Kansas-Colorado border. His brothers, unfortunately, end up siding against him, working for the scheming Cole Sanders (Roy Roberts) running gambling tables - and eventually taking to more dangerous pursuits.

This 1951 production from Scott's friend and frequent collaborator Harry Joe Brown bears some surface resemblance to DeMille's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Union-Pacific/dp/6303382983/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Union Pacific</a>&nbsp;of a dozen years earlier - Scott's job is much the same as Joel McCrea's in that film, and there's a romantic rivalry between Scott and his boss over Judith Chandler (Janis Carter) that occupies a bit of time, though Carter never comes close to having a dominant role the way Barbara Stanwyck did in the earlier film. It's not the grand big-budget spectacular that the earlier film was, but it's also no better written or better directed, and ultimately it's probably the weakest of Scott's 50s films that I've seen thus far. A lot of the problem lies in the motivations of the three younger Canfields, which never seem terribly realistic and tend to shift around wherever the screenplay demands, whether they make sense or not. Add to this some pretty dull dialogue, particularly when Britt is trying to convince his brothers to get on the right path, or the several moments of chest-thumping ""this will make America great"", and you have a relatively dull and obvious storyline, with a resolution that ought to come off as serious and tragic but instead is played for action at the expense of Britt's real losses.

But in the end, it's still worth seeing for Scott fans; he's quite good in it, and the comic relief provided by Olin Howland and Billy House as the two train engineers - one of whom is a secret card sharp - is better integrated than such stuff often is and really is pretty entertaining. There's pretty solid Technicolor photography by Charles Lawton Jr, and the location work is nice.  Director Irving Pichel had worked with Scott once before, on 1936's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/She/dp/B000RW5C2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">She</a>; like most Hollywood directors of the period he worked on a variety of genres but seemed to have a particular flair for the fantastic - the film he made just before this one was the first serious big-budget American science fiction film, DESTINATION MOON.  I believe this was his only western, and he doesn't show any particular affinity for the genre's dusty, trailworn feel.

Again, even a weak Scott western is still worth a look I think, and this is no exception, though I doubt I'll be giving it as many rewatches as most.  The DVD isn't one of Sony's best-looking in their Randolph Scott series but it's serviceable; no extras apart from English and Japanese subtitles.",1289347200,2,3718,5.261382799325464
639573,3,6303393918,"Synopsis:  Irving Pichel, well-known Hollywood narrator and director is in charge as Hollywood western legend Randolph Scot stars in Santa Fe.

Scott stars as Britt Canfield the eldest of four ex-confederate brothers who have lost the estate and are in Missouri seeking a new life.  They have an inevitable altercation with drunk Yankees and must flee. Scott ends up on a train carrying laborers to the equally legendary Atichison, Topka and Santa Fe.  He becomes a railway construction boss and, almost inevitably, must now struggle against the usual- weather, Indians, a hot-headed female, gamblers, and his own 'Yankee-hating' brothers, who just can't quite reform themselves.

The plot is cleche but entwines enough read history--Bat masterson of Dodge city, Colonel Holliday, and the struggle with the DRG&W over Royal Gorge and Raton Pass, to really ring true.

Some see this film as formulaic and dull-- I see it as a staple western, and a great trio to watch with Union Pacific and Kansas pacific.

Not for everyone, but Pichel, Scott, and railfans will enjoy it.
It's a nice slice of Americana and railroadiana.",1223942400,,1120,5.1208791208791204

639575,3,6303393918,"This 1951 movie is among the weakest in which Randolph Scott starred and this in no way down to the man himself as he is in prime form, giving his usual strong performance .It is rather down to weaknesses in the rest of the package .

Scott plays Britt Canfield the eldest of 4 brothers ,all Confederate Army veterans drifting in the West after they lost the family possessions in the conflict .In addition to Britt ,there are Terry(Jerome Courtland),Tom (Peter M Thompson),and Clint (John Archer).After an altercation with and the shooting of a boorish Union sergeant in a saloon the brothers go their own ways when Britt takes a job with the Santa Fe railroad and quickly becomes a key player in the construction of the track becoming the right hand man of the chief engineer Dave Baxter(Warner Anderson)and finding time to develop a relationship with the payroll clerk Judith -played by Janis Paige .His brothers meanwhile join up with a gang intent on halting the railroad by fermenting discord with the local Indian tribes and selling rotgut hooch to track workers .Cue a busy plot involving some broad comedy and false acusations of murder and a few robberies thrown in for good measure  .

The script meanders too much and the motivation of the characters is  too opaque for the story  to be especially interesting  and the minor roles are undercast ,Janis Paige being an especially underpowered heroine ,.Ray Rowlands as the chief villain never exudes the requisite menace and it is left to a strong performnace from Jock Mahoney to  provide a worthwhile opponent for Scott
The movie benefits from lush colour photography and is never dull but it comes across as a retread of the De Mille classic ""Union Pacific""albeit onm a comparative shoestring budget
Its not bad -just mediocre",1194739200,2,1789,4.865131578947368

639577,3,6303393918,"In the aftermath of Civil War Britt Canfield (Randolph Scott) the eldest of four brothers late of the Confederate Army head west from Virginia looking for a fresh start. In a small town saloon they run into a small bunch of ex Union soldiers following a few hot words shooting breaks out and one of the Union soldiers is killed. The brothers escape the town and with luck manage to get on board a Santa Fe Railroad flatcar taking new recruits for laying tracks from Topeka across Kansas to the Colorado border. Britt joins the Santa Fe Railroad Company whilst his three brothers tie in with a bunch of no good crooked gamblers and would be payroll thieves led by Cole Sanders (Roy Roberts). Look out for a moustachioed uncredited Jock Mahoney (Range Rider) as Crake, Sanders right hand man. Troubles come and go for Britt not least trying to cover for his brothers whilst being right-hand man to Santa Fe Rail boss Dave Baxter (Warner Anderson), The love interest is provided by Union war-widow Judith Chandler (Janis Carter). The storyline is very similar to another Scott vehicle the superior WESTERN UNION (1940) but with Rail Tracks instead of Telegraph Lines!

As always Randolph Scott assumes an air of authority without seeming to do very much although without doubt he is the best thing in it, all the supporting cast are perfectly adequate without being outstanding.  Unfortunately it leaves the feeling of being a poor mans version of Cecil B. De Mille's epic western UNION PACIFIC (1939) starring Joel McCrea. Santa Fe was another Scott-Brown Production for Columbia Pictures. Good quality color transfer to DVD. Well worth a look.",1168300800,6,1642,4.881720430107527
