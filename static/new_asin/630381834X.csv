7853249,1,630381834X,"It's strange that after his decent debut film ""The Funeral"" Itami did not make anything good. A Taxing Woman is more or less acceptable even though his tax inspectors look like a bunch of amateurs; and Daibyonin, a story of a dying film actor, begins with a promise of a good movie but then turns tooooo sugary. Other than that there's not even a hint of good production in any of his films. And true to form, Minbo shows all signs of a third-rate 'hollywoodish' junk with the most nave portrayal of the yakuza as primitive thugs and arrogant bullies, and the good guys (the hotel people) as a bunch of kindergarten kids. Not worth the time and money",1389571200,,650,4.470588235294118
7853250,5,630381834X,"I was actually an extra with a speaking part that ended up on the cutting room floor for this movie.  It moves along at a rapid pace and gives some insight into how the Japanese mob ""Yakuza"" operate in Japan.  This film began a series of events that eventually led to the suicide of the Director Juzo Itami.",1384300800,,307,4.275862068965517
7853251,5,630381834X,"This is a brave and, at the same time, very funny coverage of the problem of organized crime in Japan.  Juzo Itami paid for it with his life! His wife, Nobuko Miyamoto, is brilliant in the lead role. The writing is brilliant and all of the characters (even the secondary ones) are well drawn. Anyone who loves Japanese films and is interested in the culture, should see Minbo. Extortion is a subject everyone can relate to - from the bully in the schoolyard to the IRS (taxation without representation) - we a have all experienced it and long to stand up against it.",1376265600,,566,4.495145631067961
7853252,5,630381834X,"This is not just about the Yakuza. Its about the weak overcoming the strong, and the nerd overcoming the bully. Its done in such a lovely way, that you seat back and smile at the sweet, foxy heroine - but it has quite a bite when the heroine is attacked and almost killed with a sword.

That the director was attacked by the Yakuza, and eventually may have been killed by them, makes this film so much more poignant. It tells us that the bullies are still in charge. It tells us that Itami was definitely well ahead of his time. So I am giving this film (pun intended) three thumbs up (and at least two are mine)!!!",1337126400,,615,4.211864406779661
7853253,5,630381834X,"this movie works on so many levels. first of all, its engaging from the first minute to the last. its shows an empowered smart woman besting the criminals by her wits and inspiring the weak men around her to rise to greater heights - and should help dispel the concept that Japanese women are weak, and that a woman can be strong with finesse and brains, rather than antagonistic male bashing or kung fu kicks. The main actress is such a rare mixture of charm, quiet strength, intelligence, ande guts ... but with an unbelievabley great smile.

it shows the layers of gangsters and their tricks - much better than the typical one dimensional cardboard cutouts you see in Black Rain or Yakuza or others. it gives you a taste for their methods and interaction. then there is the interaction of the innocent good Japanese and how they are intimidated and interact. its interesting to see how it all unfolds, and how characters  is built.

the movie is clever interesting, has emotional highs and lows, and educational. i just wish they would make a DVD version. I also highly recommend the Tax Woman movie - in particular the first one but not the second. I also didn't think that much of the Funeral movie. But Minbo and the Tax Woman are great!",1135641600,,1243,4.59009009009009
7853254,5,630381834X,"Itami touched some serious nerves in Japan, when he filmed ""Minbo: The Gentle Art of Japanese Extortion"" (Japanese title ""Minbo Onna"" - ""Extortion Woman."") His choice to show the Yakuza as intimidating jerks, rather than the usual portrayal of the stylish, Robin Hood-like last remnants of the Samurai tradition, earned him a famously slashed face and possibly a murder.  I admit that its history was the reason I sought the movie out.
In addition to its political bent and rather movie-like repercussions, however, ""Minbo"" remains an excellent film, showcasing Itami's biting wit and stinging satire of modern Japanese society. The same sharp eye he brought to Japanese family life in ""The Funeral"" is used to mercilessly let the air out of the yakuza's puffed shirts and throw back the curtain of the Great and Powerful Oz, revealing the scared little men for all to see.
Itami's skillful blend of comedy and drama is on strong display, and characters wax and wane  between pathetic, noble, scared and ridiculous.  His wife, Nobuko Miyamato is at her most beautiful and  powerful in this film.  Playing a lawyer who will not bow to the yakuza tactics, she is a lady full in command, it is hard to believe that this is the same scared woman behind the counter in ""Tampopo.""
Anyone who lives in Japan is familiar with the black trucks and their annoying, relentless loudspeakers, can appreciate the frustration felt by the characters in ""Minbo.""  I for one am glad Itami made this film.",1084665600,7,1486,4.900398406374502
7853255,4,630381834X,"OK, here's the film that so burned the yakuza like the hottest piece of tempura that they slashed director Juzo Itami's face.  It's also been suggested that Itami didn't commit suicide in 1998 but was actually murdered by the yakuza. With this film, I'm not surprised if they did.
For those unfamiliar with the title term, Minbo is a Japanese acronym for MINji Kainyu BOryoku, or ""criminal acts disguised as civil actions."" It is a form of extortion that doesn't break criminal laws, and it gives the yakuza a strangehold over institutions too scared and unable to fight them. And the police cannot interfere in civil cases, so that gives the yakuza another advantage. Suzuki, accountant of the Hotel Europa explains that payments to the yakuza are listed as ""unaccountables"" and not expenses, because the yakuza don't give receipts. He thinks that people should refuse to pay, because paying them ""makes the yakuza cockier. The staff pay them off because it's not their money.""
Hotel Europa wants to fight them, because the yakuza have descnded upon their hotel like a swarm of locusts, blowing the hotel's chance of hosting the upcoming international summit. The reception manager tells the staff, ""We want people of the highest calibre. They must be courageous, skilled negotiators, familiar with the law, quick-minded, tenacious, and decisive. I doubt we employ anyone like that [here].""
Management appoints the aforementioned Suzuki as Chief of Security against the Yakuza, making him a Special Aide To The Manager. However, the milquetoast Suzuki, assisted by go-getter bellboy Wakasugi (also promoted) is given firsthand education against the rough yakuza, who artfully yell at him till he ends up hiding under a table. He learns the hard way that the customers are too scared and keep to themselves rather than incur the yakuza's wrath.
Enter Mahiru Inoue, an attorney who is hired as a specialist and she turns things around as she trains Suzuki and Wakasugi. Don't be scared of the yakuza, don't call the manager, and never fight the yakuza on their home turf are a few lessons she teaches them. Her establishment of a VIP room to deal with the yakuza is a masterful step. Although a consultant, she's more of a nice big sister to her trainees, with a killer smile but with more than enough guts to hang on a barbwire fence.
 The yakuza are indeed formidable villains. A boss named Ibagi sets up the hotel restaurant by pulling a variation on the Julie Andrews restaurant trick in Victor/Victoria: ""I'm not an expert in Italian cuisine...is this a typical ingredient?"" And when they appear to be conciliatory, they are actually setting up the next stage of their plan. A letter of apology written by Suzuki is delivered to the health department as ""proof"" of the restaurant incident. The thuggish underlings do shouting so intimidating even Sam Kinison would've soiled his pants. Meantime, the boss calms them down and offers the solution, i.e. payment amount. If the victim agrees, they go away happy, but if not, the boss becomes just as belligerent. But the one thing to remember is that the yakuzi act thuggish to the weak, but yield to the strong. And if one is strong, then they'll give.
What also made the yakuza attack Itami was the way they were cariacatured. Despite their tactics, he portrays them as oafs and overacting buffoons. Ridicule them and they seem like a joke.
Nobuko Miyamoto was Itami's wife and starred in all his films. Since his death, she appears to be inactive. Here, she gives the role of a lifetime as Mahiru Inoue. And Takehiro Murata (Wakasugi) would later play Shinoda in Godzilla 2000.
Minbo also gives the viewer a look at the teamwork concept that made Japan so successful. This outstanding film is also about confronting one's fears, finding out about and skillfully negotiating with one's enemies, but also, knowing oneself.",1027123200,11,3873,4.947772657450077
7853256,5,630381834X,"What a great film.  Writer/director Juzo Itami takes on the Yakuza, who extort money through both physical intimidation and the threat of public humiliation.  Itami himself was stabbed by a member of the uyoku, the Japanese right wing, which is affiliated with the Yakuza, shortly after this film was released.  He must have touched a nerve.
In this film, a posh hotel has been targeted by the gangsters.  No longer able to support the outflow of cash paid to prevent the criminals from embarrassing the establishment, the management decides to take action.  They are completely unprepared for the task.  Finally, they turn to a plucky attorney played by the charming Nobuko Miyamoto, who teaches them how to use the law to their advantage.  The real delight of this film is watching the various frightened hotelmen transform into an effective anti-extortion force.",980553600,8,865,5.092198581560283
