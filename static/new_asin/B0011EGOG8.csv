I really enjoyed the emphasis on breathing and how the simple act of deepening and being aware of the breath can be so calming.  The instruction was very clear and the postures were gentle but effective.  I recently used the postures recommended for the airplane on a 5 hour flight was amazed at the difference they made, I actually arrived relaxed and refreshed!",1200441600,2,474,4.7560975609756095
8241498,5,B0011EGOG8,"Yoga for Travel keeps trips free of stress and discomfort. Victor Dubin's simple exercises help anyone release the tension in the body that results from the stress of travel and the discomfort from the confined spaces we travel in. The video is divided into 3 parts to help before your trip, during the travel, and when you arrive. Victor narrates and demonstrates the poses along with two ""fellow travelers"" in a clear and easy to folow format. No previous yoga experience is necessary. This video should be available on planes and in hotel rooms and given to all business people before their trips!

8241499,5,B0011EGOG8,"This very useful yoga DVD is divided into sections for all types of travel situations. My favorite sections are airport, airplane, and motel. Last summer I used it during a tiresome layover at Chicago O'Hare Airport and then during a nine hour flight to England. It's easy to follow, and it really works. I also like that the postures are demonstrated by three different people of different ages (yes, I'm over 50 and prefer to see yoga demonstrated by the not-so-flexible). Lastly, put this little gem on your iPod so you can have it wherever you go, whenever you need it.",1198195200,,573,4.683168316831683
