7967496,5,B00006FDA7,"I realize while watching this series, and reviewing them in order, that these reviews and my joy for them are nothing but fan-appreciation. These are for families looking for a good show, or anime fans who can appreciate the awesome that this series has to offer. Even if everyone else thinks I'm crazy, watch a volume. You'll love it.

This volume ups the ante, and we get four more great episodes:

19. ""The Soseki Kite Battle Over London""

 This episode start with the Rosetta stone in the London Musuem, but when the curator is sure it is unsafe, suddenly it gets stolen! But, this is no ordinary theft, as the stone FLIES away! When a japanese student also reports some books missing, all signs point to ""soseki"" kites and Moriarty, and the battle is on!

20. ""Chase the Airship White Silver!""

 When gold goes missing from a bank, Moriarty and his men are stuck with the money but no way to get it out through Scotland Yard's Dragnet. But when the Dirigible White Silver is set to make it's maiden voyage, Todd and Smiley are sent out to complete this already successful plan. Who's in charge of security on the blimp? Holmes!

21. ""Buzz Buzz! the Flying Mecha Operation""

 When Professor and Crew break into a Jewelers, they find a strange sight: a cat burglar beating them to the Diamond they were after. But when Scotland Yard shows up, Moriarty is the one next to the open safe. But a mysterious calling may prove Moriarty's innocence and help finger the mystery thief. And what does the royal family have to do with all this?

22. ""Grand Flight Championship of Chaos?!""

 The World Championship air race is about to take place in Holland. A brilliant british inventor and pilot Mac Bain has created an engine to tear the competition apart. Moriarty sees this as an opprotunity to do exactly that. He steals the engine and heads off to win the race. Not without cheating though, of course...

The stories all remain simple and the mysteries aren't necessiarily hard to solve (Moriarty, anyone?) but they remain funny and inspired. These episodes are stand alone type, and you could watch the series in any order, however they make refrences to early episodes here. All the episodes are great, but the 19th and 21st are really outstanding.

Also, in this volume we see a level detail in the episodes we haven't seen. However, due to the copyright battle (see Case File 1-4 review for refrence) these are also from the late-80's and this is when Anime was taking a turn towards the extreme quality we see now. Think Thundercats versus Ninja Turtles. This quality shows extremely brilliantly through in the new transfer, and even the intro and outro look less grainy or spotted. The sound is superb in this volume, voices are loud, with solid music and erffects crack and boom like any modern movie.

We another special feature tucked away in the Episode section, a Line Art gallery. It's great, but short, with only twenty some pictures. None the less, a great treat for a fan.

The disc is still dual sided with English and Japanese on one side each.

Please, pick this one up! Also, lets hope Pioneer (now Geneon) releases a box with all six discs, now that they are so easy to produce. Then again, this series probably doesn't net them a whole lot. But I still like it!",1131926400,5,3280,4.6355785837651124
