8049526,4,B0007O3J6G,"Always liked Zalman King and his style: i know, maybe, it was 'innovative & hip' in the 1980's, then glossy in the 1990's, later, often considered just well made erotica.
But there was a lot more in his last completed Tv Series, the cult ""Chromium Blue""! And since Zalman left us over a couple of years ago, and has been missed by many, however he has not been particularly remembered by the Hollywood's community, who probably considered him out dated and difficult to work with (this man apparently was at times very cruel with the actors, despotic with producers, and crews, often they say, just because he was very moody, and impatient: now, i haven't met him, but followed him closely and, i think that mainly he was just being a creative artist, facing his demons, and, some insecurities like most human beings, however, we know that in Hollywood this is not acceptable, they didn't even like Marilyn Monroe to have some thoughts over the poor scripts she was given by Fox, and she was the number 1 super star! Imagine how obsolete people must have been with Zalman King, considered also his passion for tabu, and sexual themes, which are also not so likable in Tinseltown!), and had broken up 'bridges' with incredible, and powerful names, all huge people initially drawn to him, just because of his natural talent(before becoming a writer, creator, producer, musician, painter, and director, he had been a very good actor for many, many years, and, yes i believe he did succeed to become an unique filmmaker as well!), then often running away from him or giving him a real hard time to be creative, because frightened by his very own unique and provocative talent!
Anyway, i always believed that fabulously over the top, stylized like a cartoon, colorful and glossy, pagan, and erotic (however note: this despite some negative reviews, probably all coming by begot women, was never, and, again, never vulgar or merely exploitative! Not a bit!), called ""Chromium BIue"", and, of which this DVD makes a delicious film, assembling three of the most funny and adventurous, visionary and sexy episodes of the original cable series composed by 13 episodes of about 40/45 mins. each one, composed essentially by an old fashioned romantic plot, that gets completely re-envisioned, and re-invented, becoming a provoking and wildly unapologetic mix of ""Love Boat meets Fantasy Island in acid"", yet laced as well, with a lot of refined, superbly stunningly shot, and edited erotica. And, please, watch one of those late shows that either HBO or ""Skinemax"" put on the air lately, and, then dare to tell me, that this is like Oscar material, by comparison! There's actually no comparison whatsoever! While those flicks or Tv Series are often shabby, and, vulgar, and, cast mostly with porn actors engaging without any direction in stiff soft porn, King's stuff, and, this is a clear example, stands at a completely different tone, and, level. It may be surreal, dreamy, personal, but never anything like the low class products presented normally over the success of Zalman King's works!
If they said at the time, that Chromium Blue would not make much sense, perhaps because Zalman decided apparently to cut so much of the lengthy dialog that had apparently been written for 26 episodes (commissioned by Showtime and Viacom in the late 2000)  to concentrate instead on the atmosphere of those lovely years around the Millennium, populated by a happy and gorgeous, International young and hip crowd, lounging on refined Martini's, by luxurious aqua swimming pools, traveling all over in the most magnificent places, and, like in a Bond movie, always managing to stay in the most fabulous hotels and resorts, while, flirtatiously living the most sensual affairs with either some of the most lovely ladies, or some of the most ripped and wealthy new generation of studs and entrepreneurs, at the same time, since also the economy was formidable, almost like that irresistible ""tempo"" of those fantastic acid jazz, electronica, chill out grooves that made of that time, an irresistible and almost nostalgic era. Zalman King of course, nailed that time and its crowd of 24 hours party people so completely, creating a never ending series of stylish and slick, at times even super natural, or so impossibly, intoxicatingly beautiful sets, starting with shooting in lovely Barcellona, and, then down to the very South of Spain, in the fascinating, exotic landscapes of Malaga, Marbella, and Gibraltar,where Spain truly faces Morocco, and a whole other Continent, Africa, while completing interior work and some (more wintry and less sunny) exteriors in the pretty Luxembourg where executive producer Tom Reeve had a large influence, and, many practical sound stages, but even infusing this series, with that typical, exquisite mid tempo/chill out/ house, wonderfully classic music score, composed by Trevor Morais, who was helped by tons of the hippest dj's of the time to create a memorable cd. Episode after episode, King nailed a time, a society awakening to the freedom of having money and living the most exclusive fun, yet also of living with a whole new conscience, much more self aware, and, sensitive, evolved, cynical, but never angry, always wanting the best for others and for the World, taking pride in enjoying sex, partying, and great business, while making of luxury traveling an occasion to open the senses, getting to know the World, letting go of inhibitions, or excessive sentimentalism, while still dreaming of the possibility to keep as romantic as our hearts would be ready to open up to, and, envisioning a real true new generation, non afraid of anything, but always engaged on multiple points of views and recreations, and, lastly truly opening up to the World of Gay's with wisdom: just look at the many scenes including lovely lesbian models, or 2 bisexually driven guys with the same girl, or one of the principal characters, the stylist Popo, so over the top gay, and, played with great gusto by International actor, Domiziano Arcangeli, whom certainly was brave to wear nonchalant, some of the most outrageous outfits ever seen until then on TV, while, speaking with a tone somewhat reminding of the Marilyn Monroe of her earlier stages, like playing Miss Caswell, or Loreli Lee, that is! It was all crazy, yet impeccable! And, the other characters, so wildly free and innocent, always happy and so playful as the gorgeous Maria, played with awesome grit by the never again as gorgeous and powerful, Summer Altice, a real babe, capable to make you feel almost immediately on the set of a Bond movie, with her strong and arousing presence! And 2 of the most wonderful character actors, like the British, Ian Abercrombie (a class act while playing a butler that isn't really a butler, but a Lord, and, yet has amicable nonsense conversations with Popo!) and Dominic Keating also very good at playing a role of a bisexual nobleman, appearing only to a few, and, who's believed truly to be a ghost! Also the 2 (virtual, since the show is more of an ensemble piece really!) leads, so well played by the Grace Kelly look a like, Erica Prior, a blond who would have probably scored high with Hitchcock, and classic handsome boy, Shane Brolly, just coming from the success of Underworld, as billionaire Henry Brooke. And, then, of course all the guest stars: amazing, sometimes lovely, sometime funny, mostly all American girls, who'd alternate themselves in each episode, bringing the note and the flavor, since the Chromium Blue's premise was also real seductive: after socialite and billionaire Henry gets almost killed in a tragic accident, decides to leave in the hands of bride to be, the savvy and classy, Vivian Vadim, in charge of the ship, and its crew, in order to never stop the riveting message of happy partying, and, freedom, the main mission of the Chromium Blue, where, besides hosting some of the wildest parties ever seen, or just making fun of everybody else, by cleverly not taking themselves seriously, at first, in every episode there's a new lady (the guest star) who normally coming from some big American city, is either unhappy or feeling lousy, and, most of all, looking for romance! And, that's the job of the Chromium Blue's mystic people and crew: while Popo, almost immediately provides always at first a lovely, almost magical make over, then Maria, Vivian and the Butler with also more help coming from a male model and gigolo in bad luck, Sasha, and, the same Chromium Blue's web vixen who's the one the lady write to for help (impersonated by the mysterious and aloof brunette, Annette Culp) have to satisfy fully the non common desires of their guests! Oh yeah! In fact these women are coming from comics, and, wouldn't ask just for common men! But they ask for incredible and mythical characters, like a Sheik, a blonde muscular king of the Vikings, an old fashioned cowboy, 2 extremely hot brothers half gypsies and half terrorists, a vampire who looks (and he's played by Lucas Babin a top model of the time!) like a true glamor boy, and, a whole series of gangsters, lords of darkness, and so on!  So, that, when the mission is accomplished, Vivian can show all to the loved Henry, and, live with him a virtual sexual experience through such adventurous and fantastic romances! What do you think? I think it was a delight!
But, i guess, when Viacom's investors, and Showtime's executive's saw then in mid 2001, something so ahead of its time, so never done ever before, not flawless, but truly so fantasy, sexy and futuristic, imaginative, all at the same time, told more by the splendid camera work and by the music than by the usual self explanatory excessive dialogues we see on any TV show,  they remained silent.. and, terribly shocked! I truly believe they wanted to shelve it, to bury it, and to destroy any ash, or remains. In fact it took almost 2 years, before finally Chromium Blue was put on the air late at night by Showtime, every Friday night, without much or remarkable publicity, and they should be truly blamed for that! Only, Summer Altice's protector and pygmalion, Hugh Hefner made the news by inviting Zalman, and the whole cast to a great party with the press going crazy!
I say instead that it was formidable to follow the crazy, on acid, yet romantic, lavish, and erotic misadventures of the great Chromium Blue and its crew, and it's many of us who miss that kaleidoscope of those great innocent years we spent partying, and traveling, and flirting, and dancing with great grooves from LA to the East, and from the Mediterranean to the North, almost where the real Vikings may be still are! And, for as much as these DVD's are great to revive those memories of at this point almost 15 years ago,  we would love the show back, and.. extended, if possibly!!
It needs to be rediscovered, and, awarded, and, i am very, very serious!",1391126400,,10905,4.8961600865332615
