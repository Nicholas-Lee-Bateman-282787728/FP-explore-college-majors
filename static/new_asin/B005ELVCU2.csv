4666874,5,B005ELVCU2,"I found this DVD after  my daughter suggested I might like it. I loved it! Don't get me wrong, this is a very tough workout. I recommend working up to the full routine. When you finish you will have worked up a sweat, just as if you would running or biking. If you are like me and need to be kind to aging or injured joints, this dvd is for you.",1394496000,,345,3.859154929577465
4666875,5,B005ELVCU2,I started using Trudie Styler's videos and I have felt muscles that I haven't felt in a long time.  I recommend these videos to all my friends and everyone I meet!,1364428800,,163,4.258064516129032
4666876,1,B005ELVCU2,"Repetitious, hard on the joints and more about the guy, than Trudie Styler. Also, the constant reminder to breath was completely irritating. Not my favorite yoga workout, but will be my last w/Trudie Styler.",1352764800,2,207,5.117647058823529
4666877,5,B005ELVCU2,"I bought all of trudie styler DVDs after trying a library copy of her core strength Pilates.  This yoga DVD did not disappoint -- it is challenging and made me break a sweat.  The repetitions helped me improve my form.  James D'Silva is fantastic as an instructor and I find his voice soothing and motivational.  The music is different, but didn't bother me the way it did another reviewer.  I will definitely use this DVD on a regular basis.",1344902400,4,442,4.544303797468355
4666878,4,B005ELVCU2,"I love yoga workouts with shorter segments. This workout is not the same relaxing stuff I have tried before. I actually find her yoga workouts more strength and challenging then her Pilates workouts, which make me feel stretched. The instructions are clear, although he is constantly reminded you about breath which can get old. I like that it's voiced over so the cues remain clear and audible. I do like her Weight Loss Yoga dvd better then this one though so if you had to choose, I would go with that one over this.",1331510400,4,519,4.531914893617022
4666879,3,B005ELVCU2,"If you like doing what feels like a thousand warrior 2's, then get this DVD. It is very hard on the knees.

I found after 3 uses, I was done with it. It is very repetitive with variations of Warrior 2 and wide angle forward bends. The DVD picks up towards the end with some nice seated work.",1329091200,9,291,4.017241379310345
4666880,3,B005ELVCU2,"I'm giving this 3 stars because the workouts themselves are fine,however,I did not like the music used in this DVD. It is a low,droning music with a bass voice chanting/singing. It is not conducive to a peaceful workout and instead became so irritating that I could not continue. There are only two options with the sound; instruction with music or music only. I do not know the workout flow well enough to simply turn off the sound altogether. Since the music is so distinctive and different from the usual, I think it should be mentioned in the description, or an option of instruction only should be available.",1327276800,12,613,4.738317757009346
4666881,5,B005ELVCU2,LOVE - LOVE - LOVE this Yoga DVD. It's exactly what I've been looking for. I recommend it HIGHLY and plan to order more of Trudie's DVD's,1326153600,2,137,4.111111111111111
8468654,2,B005ELVCU2,"I purchased the Trudie Styler's Strengthen and Restore Yoga DVD specifically for the included downloadable ""Winding Down"" practice. When I follow the website address provided on the DVD, I receive an error message stating ""This site cant be reached."" Has anyone found a link that works to access the Winding Down practice online that is included with the DVD that I purchased?",1495843200,,376,5.080645161290323
8468655,5,B005ELVCU2,Excellent!!,1494892800,,11,11.0
8468656,5,B005ELVCU2,"I love this DVD. Let me say the first time I did one of her DVDs I was disappointed it wasn't her. However the quality of the workout is amazing.
This DVD isn't for someone looking for the same sun salutations repeated over and over with the occasional forward stretch thrown in. I think this is for someone who takes yoga a bit seriously and wants variety in their daily DVD practice. This DVD will keep you focused on what you are doing.
I love the 20 minute practice for the moring time before work. And the 45 minutes is great on days i don't have work. If you are tired of the same sequences over and over Id highly recommend this Dvd or any of the other DVDs Trudy has put out with her instructor. Personally I don't find him annoying i seen another review didn't like his voice...i think hes calming myself.
 The background is beautiful. There is deep chanting music playing again personally i find it relaxing.",1490486400,,918,4.4

8468658,5,B005ELVCU2,I have several of these videos and I am happy with them.,1476144000,,56,3.75
8468659,5,B005ELVCU2,My favorite of the series.  The deep voice of the chanting is somehow soothing and the routine kicks my butt!,1468800000,,109,4.45
8468660,5,B005ELVCU2,"Simple, well explained and show results.  James has a relaxing and easy instructive dialogue that on continual use, never gets annoying.  I love doing my exercises at home with these vidoes.  I tell everyone I do yoga with Trudie, never fails to impress.  My body has definitely changed shape since I started yoga and pilates.",1427673600,,326,4.872727272727273

8468662,5,B005ELVCU2,very happy thank you,1421193600,,20,4.25
8468663,4,B005ELVCU2,I was disappointed that Trudie doesn't narrate her own dvd. The voice of the male that does the narration is very annoying. That being said I do like that there are options for workouts on this and they are done in a flow manner but not too fast that beginners can't keep up.,1415232000,,275,4.2075471698113205
