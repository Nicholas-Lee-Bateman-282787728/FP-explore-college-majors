764598,3,6303985416,"Doctor Eric Zinthrop is a run of the mill mad scientist of vague and indefinable European descent who loves wasps. He gets fired from one job during the rising action (if you can call it that) and appeals to the aging head of a cosmetics company to fund his research. The vain Janice Starlin (played to the hilt by Susan Cabot) agrees to hire him after watching a (very Cormanesque) demonstration in which Zinthrop turns guinea pigs into rats. Later (offscreen) we are supposed to believe that he turns a huge wild cat into a cute gray kitten. (What kind of cat did it start as with that coloration? A puma?) Miss Starlin is sold, hires him, and begins taking the age-reducing injections herself.

After a plotpoint of extremely dubious credibility, Zinthrop gets hit by a car (apparently) and lapses into a coma. Starlin speeds up her own treatments (she has reduced her age from 40 to around 23 we are told via some talky exposition) but there are side effects. We are not a bit surprised, as it's almost an hour into the film before we finally get to gaze upon the wasp woman, who, of course, is Starlin.

I have seen most of Roger Corman's films, and count myself a fan of his brand of camp, but this is one of the mangiest monster costumes in film history. The wasp does not fly (obviously that was not in the budget) and appears more like a psychopathic black ruffed lemur or a marmoset of some sort with fangs and horns. In other words, it looks absolutely nothing at all like a wasp. This is the sole reason I am giving the film three stars. The rest of the movie rates on the two star level, but the appearance of the wasp woman is delightful to bad movie fans of all types.

The movie is fairly slow, and mainly takes place in one office building, so it really isn't visually stunning, but Susan Cabot does a good job in her role, and truthfully most of the other actors are a bit better than this genre normally sees in roles of this ilk. Please do not miss a cameo role by Bruno VeSota as a drunken security guard with his own comic relief theme song. Bruno is looking pretty rough here, actually, but six years later cleaned up nicely in his tour-de-force performance in Jerry Warren's truly stunning ""Wild Wild World of Batwoman.""

This is a good, though not terribly exciting, example of the giant mutated monster genre so popular in the middle of the last century. As a bonus, please enjoy the hilarious box art (from the original poster) and compare it to the actual wasp woman. I suspect that you will notice an uncanny and total lack of resemblance.",1139875200,3,2568,4.457446808510638
764599,2,6303985416,"I have watched some pretty bad science fiction and horror movies, and actually enjoyed them.  Some of them were so bad they were funny.  ""Wasp Woman"" is just bad.  Even those cheery lads at ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" might have had trouble coaxing laughs from this thing.

We see scenes of bees at the start of this movie, and then a scientist-looking character, Eric Zinthrop (Michael Mark), captures a wasp nest.  The excitement is so intense you can just feel it.  Our scientist is fooling around with wasps while he is supposed to be working on royal jelly.  Royal jelly is a secreted from the salivary glands of bees and is used to raise young bees.  Because people are gullible, many believe royal jelly has all sorts of health benefits.  However, except in Roger Corman movies, royal jelly has yet to have any proven health benefits, can cause severe allergic reactions, and in the case of this movie, seems capable of turning some women into cheesy wasps.

After Mr. Zinthrop is fired, he encounters Janice Starlin (Susan Cabot in her last movie role; apparently ""Wasp Woman"" was the kiss of death for her movie career), the aging head of a cosmetics company.  When I say aging, I mean she is in her 40s.  She is very attractive, but apparently insufficiently attractive to sell cosmetics.  Mr. Zinthrop convinces Janice that he can make her young by making a guinea pig young.

This movie drags along quite a while.  We keep seeing bees instead of wasps.  Indeed, there is nary a wasp to be found in this movie except for the wasp woman, and she looks like a ""professional"" wrestler when she is wearing her cheesy wasp woman outfit.

Finally, Mr. Zinthrop is involved in an accident and ends up being stuck in bed.  Janice decides to start taking shots of royal jelly a bit quicker than Mr. Zinthrop had been giving them to her.  Janice gets young really quick, but occasionally she gains a black face, claws and a nasty buzz in her voice.  When this occurs, she tends to kill people and eat them, which most people would likely consider a serious side effect of Mr. Zinthrop's shots.

I would like to tell you that there are redeeming characteristics to this movie, but unless you are a hard-core Roger Corman fan, you should probably avoid this movie.  The movie waits too long for the wasp woman to show up.  When she does show up, Corman made up for the cheesy costume by using out-of-focus photography and brief flashes of the wasp woman.  The ending was unsatisfying also.  The wasp woman put up a really poor fight.  After the big husky guys she killed and ate, you would have thought she could have put up a bigger fight at the end.  Oh well.  Just remember, there are lots of other cheesy movies waiting for you to watch.",1137196800,,2743,4.588477366255144
764600,5,6303985416,"I've always had a soft spot for Wasp Woman. The not so special effects are lame and the acting is campy, but you just have to love this thing. The box cover shows a human head on a giant WASPs body. The movie actually shows a human body with a WASP's face. Plus everytime she turns into the WASP be prepared for a very loud buzzzzzzzzz coming from your TV.

I'm not sure how injesting 'Royal WASP Jelly' can stop and reverse the aging process, but you kind of just go along with it. A female president of a cosmetics company is aging and she feels it's bad for business. A mad scientist comes to her and shows his discovery. She is convinced and decides to try it out on herself. Of course you know it all goes bad for her from there. The WASP woman has some great kills in this one. Not too gory, but some great scenes.

The WASP Woman may be the only movie monster to be stopped by hydrochloric acid, a wooden chair, and a closed window.

You see, Ms. Starling has committed that ultimate sin of growing older in a business that only recognizes youth and beauty. Desperate to turn back the hands of time, she enlists the help of scientist Eric Zinthrop, who just so happens to be experimenting with a youth-inducing serum, made from the royal jelly of queen wasps. At first, all goes well, as the serum causes 5 years to melt away. However, Ms. Starling's impatience soon gets the better of her and she takes extra injections of the stuff, turning her into a voracious she-beast!

764602,2,6303985416,"From Roger Corman, one of the most prolific director/producers in Hollywood, comes The Wasp Woman (1960), a film that was most probably influenced by 1958's The Fly, with Vincent Price.  Hey, if Hollywood can turn a man into a fly, why not turn a woman into a wasp?  Well, no one ever accused Corman of originality.

The movie opens up with a scientist getting fired from a company the produces honey as he is doing some strange experimentation.  Seems the Scientist, Eric Zinthrop, played by Michael Mark, has been exploring the notion of using royal jelly to create a rejuvenation formula.  After getting fired, Zinthrop contacts Janice Starlin, played by Susan Cabot, the head of Starlin Cosmetics.  Starlin Cosmetics is losing sales due to the fact that Ms. Starlin was the only spokesperson for the cosmetics, and now that she is aging, sales are falling off.  After talking to Zinthrop and seeing his success on turning back time with various animals, she hires him on, sets him up in a lab, and they begin treatments on her.  The process appears to be working, but Ms. Starlin becomes impatient, wanting more results quicker, so she secretly starts injecting herself with the formula.  What happens?  Take a guess...I mean, the movie is titled The Wasp Woman.

The acting wasn't bad, but we didn't even see the wasp woman until almost an hour into this rather talky feature.  There are some bloody deaths, and the make up to create the wasp woman isn't all that bad, but the movie would have benefited from not making us wait so long in seeing the creature, filling up the 73 minute run time with nonsensical plot threads that don't develop.

Alpha Video provides an exceptionally poor print here, as the film has all kinds of blemishes and even drops out briefly at a couple of points.  The picture appears washed out, and the audio is pretty poor.  No special features here in this barebones release, not even a trailer, but for under ten bucks I wasn't expecting much.  Now that I've experienced the quality of Alpha Video, I doubt I will buy any more of their releases.  I would recommend someone interested in owning this movie on DVD to do a little research, as I have since found out a number of companies have released a version, some even on double bills with other movies.  I will say the cover art on the Alpha Video release looks enticing, but, as with most things in life, you get what you pay for here.

764605,5,6303985416,"I've got to hand it to Roger Corman for this one; Wasp Woman is a pretty darn good movie (albeit with vintage Corman-esque not so special effects).  The film starts off with a whimper, giving us a boring look at bee farming before introducing us to Dr. Zinthrop, who is promptly fired for wasting his time experimenting with wasps.  Then we are taken to the boardroom of Janice Starlin Enterprises, a cosmetics company facing lean times because the face that has always sold the product, that of Janice herself, is not as young as it used to be.  Enter Dr. Zinthrop and his fantastic story of restoring youth with a wonder-working extract taken from queen wasps.  After he turns two old rabbits into young bunnies before her eyes, Janice believes him and insists that she will be his first human test subject.  The rest of the company bigshots are increasingly concerned by the secrecy around Zinthrop's work, but even they cannot deny the new youthful face of their leader (accomplished mainly by taking away her old maid glasses and having her smile more often).  Unfortunately, Janice secretly injected herself with the experimental, much more concentrated extract in order to hasten the process, and poor Zinthrop gets run over by a car before he can warn her of its rather disturbing side effects.  Thus, we are left with several Starling associates trying to find out what is really going on.  They think Janice is in danger, but in fact they are the ones in danger.  Janice's headaches are indicative of a much more significant problem; from time to time, she turns into a giant wasp who is less than civil to her underlings.
The whole wasp woman getup is pretty ridiculous-looking, but one can look past such silly special effects and enjoy the movie for the fun, B-movie classic it is.  The acting is unusually good for a Corman movie, and Susan Cabot particularly shines as Janice Starling.  I've seen a number of Roger Corman movies, and this 1960 offering is by far the best of the bunch as far as I am concerned.",1045440000,21,2025,4.708215297450425

Starling is a CEO and model for a successful line of cosmetics but, like all of us, she is growing old. Enter a strange little man who promises that he can restore youh with Wasp Royal Jelly and Enzymes.
The treatment works but is slow, too slow for Starling. She sneaks into the lab and injects a massive dose to speed the process. It works but with horrible consequences. The enzymes change her into a wasp woman, who kills her enemies and eats them.
The story is hokey but the underlying idea isn't. Like many of Corman's movies, this one dealt with a very provocative topic, the American obsession with youth and the lengths people will go to keep it, and treats it in a half-serious, half-humorous manner.
The effects are lousy, especially since Corman films bees and not wasps, but you get the idea.",1017187200,2,913,4.506024096385542
764607,3,6303985416,"Quickie-flick exploitation master Roger Corman produced and directed this epic example of schlock cinema.  A forty-something cosmetics magnate takes experimental injections derived from royal wasp jelly to look twenty years younger.  Impatient to achieve the desired  results, she overdoses on the stuff.  The massive jolt of wasp juice causes sporadic ""insect girl"" transformations that lead to murder.  We doubt that Corman intended this little sci-fi thriller to be camp entertainment, but that perspective works best in viewing this film.  The fright ""makeup"" consists of a bug-eyed head mask complete with antennae and goofy looking mittens with claws (or is it stingers?) that leave the human wrists conspicuously visible.  Regardless of logic, the apparently wingless creature makes an insect wing buzzing sound, raised by several decibels.  The acting, dialogue, and production values are typically low budget.

As such, I cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of the disc released by Gaiam - Entertainment. My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

Mill Creek Sci-Fi Classics 50 Movie Pack: Disc 2, Side A, second feature - THE WASP WOMAN (1959), starring Susan Cabot and Anthony Eisley (and Frank Wolff and Frank Gerstle), directed by Roger Corman.

Corman stalwart Susan Cabot stars as Janice Starlin, the aging head of a cosmetics company whose youthful looks had built the reputation of her company.  But profits are falling as newer models have taken her place; enter the unconventional scientist Eric Zinthrop, who has developed a serum derived from extracting the royal jelly of queen wasps, a serum which may reverse the aging process.  As the face of her company, Ms. Starlin insists that she be the first human to test the serum - sounds like a good idea to me!  But wait!  What's this?  People in the building are starting to disappear, and Ms. Starlin - though now youthful in appearance - is starting to become confused, forgetful.  Could there be some harmful side effect to the serum?  A well-timed auto-accident puts Dr. Zinthrop out of commission for a time, so Ms. Starlin resorts to injecting herself with the remainder of the serum.  (Considering the things I've seen women do in order to look younger, this seems entirely credible to me.)  The results are fantastic, in more ways than one!  Oh no!

The dangers of unregulated science are on trial again, here in THE WASP WOMAN, as with so many other creature-feature films of the 50's - that is, if you wanted to assume that Mr. Corman was trying to insert any subtext into the film.  If, on the other hand, you cynically assign no higher motive to the director than that he wanted to exploit the popularity of other films which had the dangers of unregulated science as their themes, then you might think THE WASP WOMAN was simply a cheap knock-off of THE FLY, which, suspiciously enough, was released only year prior.  The well-anthologized short-story by Roald Dahl (ROYAL JELLY, first published in the collection&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kiss-Kiss/dp/B002RI9VM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kiss Kiss</a>) seems to have been published AFTER this film, so Dahl may have got his idea from Corman - interesting that the two follow so closely on one another.

I mention Dahl because, like Audrey's tendril's (the carnivorous plant from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Shop-of-Horrors/dp/B001O8Z5TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Shop of Horrors</a>), Roger Corman's influence is inescapable.  (No direct connection between auteur and author is proven - but it seems odd that two people would focus a horror tale on the dangers of royal jelly consumed by humans within a year of each other without one influencing the other.)  Anyone who has read my reviews before knows that I'm on the fence with Mr. Corman - as a producer/director, I think he has a well-deserved reputation as an innovator and as an entertainer.  I just think many of his films are over-hyped simply because his name is attached, when the product is actually only mediocre.

THE WASP WOMAN is mediocre.  Not nearly as good as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fly/dp/B000VB03AA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fly</a>&nbsp;with Vincent Price, it still manages to be marginally entertaining in the way that many black-and-white cheap horror films from the 50's can be - if one is able to hold back on a whole lotta legitimate criticism.  This is the sort of B-movie that people who hate B-movies can sometimes still abide - certainly a better film than, say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Attack-of-the-Giant-Leeches/dp/B001HE06JS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Attack of the Giant Leeches</a>, another film Roger Corman's name is attached to.  Susan Cabot and the rest of the cast turn in mostly solid performances (or solid enough, considering), and the storyline is far-fetched but not entirely unbelievable (especially from a late 1950's viewpoint).  Probably what sells the film (if anyone's buying), is the appeal to vanity - Susan Cabot's character's obsession with youth is understandable given her position.  Not only is she personally interested in appearing more youthful, but her company's success also depends on it.

But the special effects are pretty laughable, and anyone who's seen at least a smattering of films in his or her lifetime knows where this one is headed, right from the beginning.  Frank Gerstle, whom we last saw in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Atomic-Brain-aka-Monstrosity/dp/B001J1X24K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Atomic Brain, aka Monstrosity</a>, has a short bit as a private detective (he has a good villain/cop face - he should have been used more often), and we also get to see an early walk-on appearance by Frank Wolff, who went on to have an excellent run in Euro-Western and -Crime films in the sixties and early seventies.

If you are a fan of low-budget science-fiction/horror from the 1950's, then you probably already have this film or know of it - I can't really think of any other reason to seek it out, unless you are looking for all the films of Roger Corman, Susan Cabot, or even Frank Wolff, if your interests turn that way.  If you're stuck at home on a Saturday night and the only thing on TV is Svengoolie, and the featured episode is THE WASP WOMAN, you won't get stung too bad if you watch.

764868,2,6303985416,"I have watched some pretty bad science fiction and horror movies, and actually enjoyed them.  Some of them were so bad they were funny.  ""Wasp Woman"" is just bad.  Even those cheery lads at ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" might have had trouble coaxing laughs from this thing.

We see scenes of bees at the start of this movie, and then a scientist-looking character, Eric Zinthrop (Michael Mark), captures a wasp nest.  The excitement is so intense you can just feel it.  Our scientist is fooling around with wasps while he is supposed to be working on royal jelly.  Royal jelly is a secreted from the salivary glands of bees and is used to raise young bees.  Because people are gullible, many believe royal jelly has all sorts of health benefits.  However, except in Roger Corman movies, royal jelly has yet to have any proven health benefits, can cause severe allergic reactions, and in the case of this movie, seems capable of turning some women into cheesy wasps.

After Mr. Zinthrop is fired, he encounters Janice Starlin (Susan Cabot in her last movie role; apparently ""Wasp Woman"" was the kiss of death for her movie career), the aging head of a cosmetics company.  When I say aging, I mean she is in her 40s.  She is very attractive, but apparently insufficiently attractive to sell cosmetics.  Mr. Zinthrop convinces Janice that he can make her young by making a guinea pig young.

This movie drags along quite a while.  We keep seeing bees instead of wasps.  Indeed, there is nary a wasp to be found in this movie except for the wasp woman, and she looks like a ""professional"" wrestler when she is wearing her cheesy wasp woman outfit.

Finally, Mr. Zinthrop is involved in an accident and ends up being stuck in bed.  Janice decides to start taking shots of royal jelly a bit quicker than Mr. Zinthrop had been giving them to her.  Janice gets young really quick, but occasionally she gains a black face, claws and a nasty buzz in her voice.  When this occurs, she tends to kill people and eat them, which most people would likely consider a serious side effect of Mr. Zinthrop's shots.

I would like to tell you that there are redeeming characteristics to this movie, but unless you are a hard-core Roger Corman fan, you should probably avoid this movie.  The movie waits too long for the wasp woman to show up.  When she does show up, Corman made up for the cheesy costume by using out-of-focus photography and brief flashes of the wasp woman.

The ending was unsatisfying also.  The wasp woman put up a really poor fight.  After the big husky guys she killed and ate, you would have thought she could have put up a bigger fight at the end.  Oh well.  Just remember, there are lots of other cheesy movies waiting for you to watch.",1339632000,,2743,4.588477366255144

764943,3,6303985416,"No one watches a Roger Corman film with the expectation that it will have a coherent script, solid production values, or memorable performances. Done on the cheap, his films were calculated to draw a teenage audience with clever titles and flashy posters that inevitably promised more than they delivered. Some are better, some are worse, and some are mildly amusing due to their commonplace nature. THE WASP WOMAN falls in the latter category.

The plot is part FRANKENSTEIN, part DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE, and part THE INVISIBLE MAN. Eric Zinthrop (Michael Mark) is a scientist who finds that ""Queen Wasp Royal Jelly"" has a youthening effect; Janice Starlin (Susan Cabot) is an aging beauty whose cosmetic company is in a slump. Unfortunately, Janice grows impatient and overdoses on wasp extract. She not only drops about a decade of wrinkles, she also turns into a wasp and takes to sucking the blood of her unfortunate employees.

There's nothing spit-shined about the story or script, but the cast is surprisingly competent for this sort of thing. Susan Cabot was one of many young actresses who had the misfortune to receive a film contract from a major studio at almost the precise moment the studio system began to fade; although she was smart, prettier than many, and more talented than most, her film career quickly stalled. Her association with Corman (she did five films for him) was actually the high point of her career. Her turn in THE WASP WOMAN, complete with silly mask and awkward gloves, was her final big screen fling, and as the result isn't too bad as these things go. Others in the cast worth noting are Barboura Morris, who did several Corman films, and Anthony Eisley, who went on to a significant television career.

I'm not wild about Corman movies. They always seem slow to me, and THE WASP WOMAN is no exception. Still, it has its moments--as when Zinthrop demonstrates his wonder drug by injecting it into guinea pigs that somehow ""youthen"" into lab rats or when Janice's age is erradicated by simply wiping off some crudely done make-up wrinkles. The big pay off, of course, is the sight of Cabot in her silly wasp woman costume, which looks nothing whatsoever like a wasp. But do these moments make it all worth the effort? Well... I'm not going to watch it again, but it's better than such Corman debacles as ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTERS or CREATURE FROM THE HAUNTED SEA.

764944,3,6303985416,"This Roger Corman B- horror film isn't bad. It could have been better with a little more action earlier on. When you advertise a film featuring a monster, you don't want to wait for over three-quarters of that film waiting for it. That was the case here with the Wasp Woman who doesn't become that and start killing people until the last 15 minutes of the 72-minute film.

However, it wasn't totally boring up to then. It was still fairly interesting as it showed an eccentric scientist inventing a serum that would reverse the aging process. He finds a willing subject in the female head of a cosmetics firm that is falling on hard times.

Susan Cabot does a nice job playing the cosmetics CEO and ''Michael Mrk"" isn't bad as the scientist, ""Eric Zinthrop."" None of the actors are terrible, actually, which I usually except in these kind of B-films. They aren't Laurence Oliver or Meryl Streep, but they're competent enough.

Corman's goofy music score was very reminiscent of his 1960 hit, ""The Little Shop Of Horrors."" This movie didn't have that pizazz to it but, as said in the first sentence, wasn't bad. It certainly is worth a look for sci-fi or horror films of the '50s and '60s.

764945,2,6303985416,"[This review was written by my SO, the Thinking Chick. -- Ed.]

This is a (unintentionally) hysterically funny Roger Corman grade-Z drive-in fodder. Don't waste your time with the remake, just watch the original in all its cheesy glory.

Eric Zinthrop (Michael Mark) is a conscientious scientist -- a rarity in your 50s junk science vehicle -- who thinks he's found the fountain of youth in royal jelly extracted from wasps. No wussy bee royal jelly for him; no sir, he's getting his royal jelly from aggressive, carnivorous wasps. (Yeah, you know where this is going, don't you?) Zinthrop's results are initially encouraging but before he can do further testing, his research team, determined to stick with bees, dismiss him. Zinthrop packs up his equipment and resolves to find someone who'll appreciate his genius.

He meets with Janice Starlin (Susan Cabot), an aging cosmetics queen who's threatened with being dethroned because she's no longer perceived as youthful. Zinthrop shows her the results of his wasp enzyme serum and she insists on being his first human test subject. The stuff erases years from Starlin's face and makes her young and beautiful again, but at times it also has the unpleasant side-effect of turning her into a flesh-eating she-wasp.

Normally, when I get so much as a rash, I throw the offending product away. Starlin must dread those pesky crows feet even more than being a human-eating insectoid, because she keeps shooting up with wasp juice. You can imagine the gruesome results. What you can't imagine is the $1.98 wasp costume used to convey her transformation. Some things just need to be experienced first hand. The wooden acting matches nicely with the costuming and special effects too.

Imagine, in 1960, a movie about a female CEO who clearly wears all the pants at her successful company, plus she is bright as heck.  Now there's a fantasy premise for the year 1960!

As the other reviewers have commented, the special effects are weak, and the monster doesn't even become visible until 80% of the way through the movie.

However, the premise is so unique for the time, I was more than willing to stick with it.  And I found the protagonist to be an interesting character.  You won't see another sci-fi movie with a strong female CEO as the protagonist.",1207180800,2,664,4.53781512605042

The creature does not appear until a little over 50 minutes into the version which I streamed via Amazon Prime.  The special effects for the creature are pretty basic and primitive, so it is probably a good thing that it doesn't get much screen time.

SPOILERS:  The movie is the usual science gone bad plot but Dr. Zinthrop is not the usual crazed mad scientist villain.  He discovers the side effects but suffers a head injury before he can do anything about it.  There are several things wrong with the movie such as Dr. Zinthrop at the beginning is later called Mr. Zinthrop.  When Zinthrop injects the guinea pig, the animal is obviously not alive - stuffed or fake?  The close-ups of the insects appear to be bees not wasps.  In one street scene the cars are obviously too old for a 1959-60 street.  But despite the flaws, Leonard Maltin gave it 2 1/2 stars out of four.  I think it is a solid 3 1/2 stars out of 5 for this type of movie.

7859609,3,6303985416,"I have a at least 3 movies released by Alpha Video.  They are all mediocre at best.
If I could find another release of The WASP WOMAN Roger Corman's 1959 B-movie cheapie (shot in 7 days) I would in a heartbeat as The WASP WOMAN is one of my guiltiest of B-movie pleasures (Jack Arnold's It Came from Outer Space another guilty pleasure, for example...).  I would never suggest anyone buy this Alpha Video version if you haven't seen this Corman ripoff of ""The Fly"" before (conceived on a dime soon after the success of Fly that starred Vincent Price and David Hedison).  But, The Wasp Woman's picture is too grainy, jumps in 1 or two places and the sound fades out too soon before one scene changes to another.  I'm glad I only spent 4 bucks on this shabby Alpha Video re-production.
But, the good is the Fred Katz jazzy music, the respectable dialogue, the respectable acting (see Barboura Harris,also good in the especially good A Bucket of Blood 1958) and just the science of possibilities that make this cautionary tale of vanity and success worth a watch.  I also find it interesting how progressive it is for this 1958 movie to have a female character (Susan Cabot, not bad .. and looks 'tight' and business like in those 'dress' suits) running the Company before the tender old age of 40!  Yes, the make-up-mask is not too good (it's kinda nasty, actually ... and the antennae, oh man...) but the blurry lens eventually add up to a smile inducing, cringe worthy hoot of a cosmetics massacre, as it were.  Some rather thick blood even flows.
I also enjoyed the 'model' secretaries who sit on each others desks and drink coffee and gossip about status, basically.  And the scientist who shows up with the elixir serum is not mad, I tell you, not mad at all.  He's actually a good old guy who loves the wasps he works with.  ""The wasps won't sting me..."".

And this was a little better than most of them - directed by the KING of this type of film, Roger Corman, on a budget of about $1.99 (actual budget was $50,000 in 1959 (which is roughly $414,000 adjusted for inflation can you imagine ANYONE making a move for that amount today?) for this little film which could be pretty good if polished a little and had a bigger budget for special effects, etc.

The basic plot involves a starting to age owner of a cosmetic firm who has always been the firms public face - in ads, etc. Since she's starting to show some age it becomes harder for the firm to find it's footing. MOST CEO's would just hire a new model but not this one!

She decided to bet on someone who no one knows even if the basic idea of using wasp queen jelly does have - some - scientific evidence. There are those who believe eating or using a supplement containing queen bee Royal Jelly can extend you life - after all it does for queen bees!
