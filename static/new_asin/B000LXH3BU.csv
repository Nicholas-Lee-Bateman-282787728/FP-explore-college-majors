8165221,5,B000LXH3BU,"The Jammys are an annual event to celebrate the year's top contributers in the jam music scene. It also features different musicians performing together in a variety of combinations. Most typically this will be a current jam band playing with a top artist from another genre such as country, blues or classic rock.

Some highlights for me were blues legend Buddy Guy, John Mayer and Phil Lesh playing an electrifying version of the Muddy Water's classic ""Hoochie Coochie Man"", Blue Oyster Cult and Moe together on ""Don't Fear The Reaper"" and Peter Frampon with Guster and Martin Sexton on ""Do You Feel Like We Do"". If you like excellent songs performed by talented musicians with a fun mixture of styles than this DVD is a great choice.

It also includes some bonus features such a backstage documentary and a list of past Jammy award winners. This is good stuff and comes highly recommended.",1203465600,,892,4.823529411764706
8165222,5,B000LXH3BU,"What would happen if we put Les Claypool on stage with Phil Lesh and Mike Gordon? Aside from needing more cowbell, how would it sound if moe. played 'Don't Fear the Reaper' with Blue yster Cult? Would Perry Farrell ever play with The String Cheese Incident? The responses to such questions are not just hypothetical curiosities but the fabric of the Jammys experience. Indeed, ""Best of the Jammys"" is an epic trip into live improvisational music. The DVD bridges the gap between jambands and classic rock, Blues, alternative rock and Country. No intact bands perform. Instead, the event features dream bands or 'frankenstein groups' that unite under the flag of jam. Could there be a more unlikely combination than the Disco Biscuits and Travis Tritt? As unlikely as it may be, their music is some of the most rewarding. That written, every song is a five star experience. If there's a drawback to ""Best of the Jammys,"" it's the noticeable absence of jazz. Hopefully volume 2 will portray a more balanced view of the event. In terms of the production, the camera work is excellent and the video editing is superb. Uninterrupted by interviews, songs are allowed to play in their entirety. The audio editing fulfills the greatest potential of the surround sound experience. Hats off to Relix for such a fantastic production. ""Best of the Jammys - volume 1"" will strongly resonate with anyone who loves live improvisational music.",1177632000,2,1427,4.95
