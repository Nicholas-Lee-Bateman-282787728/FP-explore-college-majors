4123776,5,B003H6KRO8,"This story is about a young man named Rin. Rin lives with his friend Kaede. Both of them lost their mothers in an accident, and Kaede takes care of Rin's every need. It looks like they will always be together, until a couple of princesses form other worlds show up and ask him to choose one of them to marry. There is also a classmate named Asa who is gunning for his affections. After things start to settle down a young girl comes from the demon world to live with Kaede and Rin, making everything even more crazy. With all these really great ladies after his attention Rin must choose one, and break the others hearts.

This story is very good. It's a great harem style anime with lots of awesome characters and plot twists. It is also very emotional. The last 6 episodes or so are really heavy. The animation quality and voice acting are also very good in this anime. I enjoyed every minute of it. I hope you do too.",1354924800,,920,4.317919075144508
4123777,5,B003H6KRO8,"I watched this anime expecting a few different things, especially the outcome, however it was really good. I'm a guy and I still found this to be very enjoyable. Worth looking into.",1354492800,,181,4.6875
4123778,3,B003H6KRO8,"Note: This review is for the dubbed version of the series.  I have not seen the subbed version.

This anime starts out as a pretty typical harem comedy.  The main character is surrounded by beautiful girls, all who want to be with him and he ends up seeing their underclothing at various places.  Totally fun.

However, about halfway through the series, the story takes a much darker turn and much of the funny parts all but disappear.  Once the darker story arc ends, it returns to funny and then back again to dark.  This makes it seem very unbalanced and I would have preferred that the story stayed a funny harem story, especially as the last few episodes shows a side of my favorite character that I found very disturbing.

Nonetheless, the art style is beautiful and the voices in the dub are well acted (I've always liked Funimations adaptations, though I'd like for them to hire a few more people).  I'd still recommend the series, but with some reservations if you're looking for a full-out comedy.",1348185600,,1007,4.6440677966101696
4123779,4,B003H6KRO8,"Shuffle is nothing extrodinary...at first anyway.  It begins with the typical ""nice guy"" , Rin in this case, gaining the attention of several beautiful women.  This time around one is the princess of the gods (Sia), and one is the princess of demons (Nerine).  On top of that, several other women start to persue Rin as well.  Honestly I don't see Rin as the nice guy that the show keeps trying to make him out to be...  He's constantly taking advantage of these women, even if he really has no interest in them.  What held the show together for me were the female characters.  Most of them start out as the usual sterotypes, but they quickly gain more and more depth as the series goes on.  Even the women I didn't like ended up becoming interesting characters.  Another problem I had was that the girls don't really get equal focus in the show, but when they did get their turn they developed just as much.  On a positive note, unlike several of the harem series I've seen Rin does make a choice.  It has a great ending that wraps up the main focus of the series, but also leaves it open enough for interpretation and a sequel (though I doubt we see one).  I will say just as a general complaint of harem series in general that it would make sense for the genre if at the end of the series they had either ova's or an entire episode or two about what would've happened if the main character had chosen someone else.  Overall, it's got great characters (for the most part), comedy, animation, and drama towards the end.",1347840000,,1520,4.405017921146953
4123780,4,B003H6KRO8,"This show starts out to feel like a typical harem comedy mixed with some sci-fi/fantasy elements...a few of our girls here are aliens. Cute aliens, but pointy eared aliens nonetheless.

What made this show interesting to me is we start to see reality rear it's ugly head & throw a wrench in the perfect harem situation for our male protaganist. Would a bunch of girls who were all in love with the same guy all get along & remain friends like we see in many harem comedies? Of course not. Is every cute girl just as perfect on the inside without any baggage or issues? Of course not. Does a guy eventually have to choose one girl over the others, otherwise face losing everyone? Yes he must. Will that choice be devastating to others, and be a painful situation? Yes it will.

Ah, reality. Screwing up a superficial harem comedy and elevating it into something more dramatic. I like it.",1332806400,,886,4.53125
4123781,5,B003H6KRO8,"24 episodes does not seem like enough for this anime! It was amazing! If you're like me, and you read the visual novel, but haven't seen the anime, you better watch it! I was satisfied with the ending, but I wish he could've chosen someone else (I'm not saying who he chose). Someone did spoil part of the end for me though, which made me PISSED, so I'm not going to go into detail too much. Though there are parts where it gets uncensored, but if you're looking for hentai, don't get this. ""Shuffle!"" has more of a deeper romantic story, and it may seem like it's girly, but it actually isn't. I'm a guy and I totally love this anime! ""Shuffle!"" has a really amazing story and I recommend it to anybody, as you will NOT be disappointed! I guarantee!",1313280000,2,750,4.326241134751773
4123782,5,B003H6KRO8,"To be honest at first I was more or less scratching my head saying hmmm ok... But as the series went on I found myself getting more into it. The main character didn't really seem to lean towards any of the girls untill a few episodes with one of them.
Farther in I found myself wanting him to hook up with one of them but didn't seem it was going to turn out that way. As the story progressed and was on it's 10 or so last episodes I found myself getting farther and farther on the edge of my seat, wanting to watch episode after episode. The ending was amazing and I was very happy with the way it turned out, it didn't let me down one bit.
To sum it up in my opinion it took alittle while to get going, but when it did, it didn't disapoint at all.",1313193600,,749,3.9342105263157894
4123783,5,B003H6KRO8,"THIS IS THE EPIC ROMANCE ANIME FOR GUYS!

No MONSTERS WITH TENTICLES, NO RAPE!!!! Thats all I ask for in my anime. This is my first review because this is the first DVD i found that was so AWESOME! I love action anime like ""Inital D"" and ""Afro Samari"" too, but Shuffle! is a love story.

My major issue with the ""romance"" anime is the ""SPAZ OUT"" events. In so many of the ""guy meets girl"" animes there is always some dude spazing out CONSTANTLY. in this one the dude is calm. Hes got all these smokin hot girls around him. They all say all the most seductive things and he plays it cool the whole time. The girls don't start to spazz out until the last few episodes where they confront dude for leading them on, but then they are right back to flirting.

Flashing their underpants in just about every episode is about as graphic as this one gets. There is only 2 kisses in the whole thing, a very innocent romantic anime.

Listening to the girls talk about how they are helplessly in love is quite refreshing. The the movies out now suck because the women are so cold and demanding. Its every mans dream to have women say they love you, and do things like flashing their underpants in just about every episode over and over for hours. There is no other movie like this and its a shame. :-)

600 minutes and every second is worth watching twice!!",1312329600,3,1345,4.300395256916996
4123784,5,B003H6KRO8,"Let me just say that Rin (the main character in this anime) has the type of luck any red-blooded man would want. He has two MEGA HOT princesses who want him for their husband. One is from the demon world and the other is from the world of the gods. Unfortunately, with extremely hot girls in animes these days comes the psychotic groupies.....if only there were no groupies and you could have both of them for yourself. The story is very heart-warming and the princesses' fathers are pretty funny. The carrot-top (Kaede) turns out to ALSO be in love with Rin (unbeknownst to herself) but it turns out Kaede might be a little off the deep end (you'll discover why later on in the anime.

There's the perfect combination of sexiness and romance. If you love drama animes then I would recommend you buy this anime, owning a copy of this anime I can tell you it is well worth the buy.",1308182400,5,880,4.432098765432099
4123785,5,B003H6KRO8,"Hay guys its me amazonotaku just wanted to say this was some really demented stuff but all good.awsome looking girls and a story that will make you fall in love then it got weird.  Three of the five love intrests have split personalities while one is suttle one is seductive and the last one and least expected one is down right creapy.  I am not sure what it is but lately I've found myself watching stuff with attempted suicides this one was touching in an erie way.  Ok final review time design and graphics 5 out of 5, story 4 out of 5, ending 5 out of 5, and last but never least female hottness a mear 7out of 5. Note to the concerned parent there is nudity it is rated tvMA for a reason not a great christmas gift.  All in all a good series makes my top 20 for now.
Let the world know you are an otaku we may have hard times of riticule but remember anime in its simplest form takes more work then the entire cast of multi million doller movies or the weekly cop drama.  Live out loud

8396740,2,B003H6KRO8,"This show has only one major point to the plot: who does the only guy want to hook up with? Along the way, you see elf boobs, human boobs, heck even little girl elf boobs. It's nothing but soft core anime porn in a series. I was not aware going in, and traded it in shortly after realizing it. I was not impressed.",1494288000,,314,4.0

8396744,5,B003H6KRO8,"This collection is one of the better harem comedies just because of the varied categories of stories and adventures. To think of ways to describe it without giving anything away is hard to do so i think less words is better in this case. Love, loss, comedy, heartache, disappointment, laughs and smiles, adventures, u name it and its there basically. A harem comedy to own, one of the better ones!",1389657600,,397,4.685714285714286

8396747,5,B003H6KRO8,I was willing to get the Funimation S.A.V.E. Edition but waited awhile to see if I could get the Viridian collection. I'm glad I did because everything came perfect.
