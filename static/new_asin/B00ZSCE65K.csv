7294609,5,B00ZSCE65K,"I have heard of many different missionaries to China, but this was the first I had heard of Robert Jermain Thomas. The story was told from the perspective of one of his converts, and did a great job giving lots of little details about his life and work without getting bogged down in them.
The movie was animated and very interesting, even for adults. After the movie, there was a little section (more for the grown-ups) showing real pictures of Thomas and some of his Chinese converts and telling what happened after the ending shown in the movie.
Well done. Great for people of all ages, though parents of children under FOUR would do well to watch it with their kids as some of the thematic elements can be a bit scary (some people are executed, you don't actually see the deed done, but my 3 year old still picked up on the scary music).",1456617600,4,841,4.432258064516129
