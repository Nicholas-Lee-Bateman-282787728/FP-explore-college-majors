Although it is usually my policy never to respond to critics, legitimate or otherwise, I am choosing to because I suspect the ""reviewer"" has either a personal grudge of some sort or has seen a rough cut/work in progress version of the film from years ago.

There were at least two screenings and video review versions of this film that did have technical problems. All of these have been addressed in this new DVD version of the film. The editors went back to all the original materials - negatives and sound recordings and completely re-cut/re-mastered the film. Work that was not possible due to severe budget restraints when working on the original 35MM theatrical release.

The technial issues been dealt with. The director has completely re-shaped the film. It is now what I originally intended.",1195516800,4,917,4.7784810126582276
8216714,1,B000V6LSZ4,"Waiting for the Man is another turkey from the so-called filmmaker John Covert. The problem with this film lies with the director John Covert. He fancies himself to be one of these spiritually austere European film directors like Robert Bresson. However, John Covert films lack the substance of Bresson's (or Bergman's) films. Also the acting in this film is terrible-perhaps this due to the screenplay-afterall, John Covert wrote the screenplay. I see that John Covert wrote an Amazon review of his own film. This film is nothing to get defensive about. John Covert seems to be a very paranoid person-(I would refrain from calling him a film director). John Covert should not be allowed to write reviews of his own films. Amazon.com is not the place to peddle his American garbage.",1194220800,,782,4.977099236641221
