My children watched it growing up, and now as young adults are a thrilled as I am to watch it all over again.

2295515,5,B0009JKVT2,"Charming children and adults get into fun predicaments.

If you liked ""Anne of Green Gables"" or ""Little House on the Prairie""; then you should like this. Seasons 1-6 are excellent.

The realistic, likeable, characters are people that I would like to know. Avonlea is a place, I would like to visit. I like the beautiful, country-side, the farms, the horses, and the period style of dress, with the women in their pretty dresses, the period sets and homes, the humor, the warmth, the inviting activities, and the lively pace. Avonlea carries you to a nicer place.

Mr. Sullivan spared no expense to create fun and interesting escapades.

I especially liked the episode where Aunt Hetty, Jasper, and Aunt Olivia purchase the Lobster Canning Factory; because Jasper and Olivia are such charming characters in figuring out how to improve the factory.

This series has been my best money value; dividing the 13-episodes by the cost: $5113 episodes = $3.92 per 46-minute episode. Sells new in Canada for $80.",1175731200,12,1002,4.976047904191617

2295536,5,B0009JKVT2,"As a family we have watched Season 1, various episodes from Seasons 2 and 3, then we purchased Season 4, Season 6 and Season 7, respectively.  Season 5 balances out the superior character development of the various members of the King family, as well as interspersing episodes with guest star appearances as we've come to expect.  Episodes such as ""Memento Mori"" and ""Thursday's Child"" really tug at your heartstrings, while ""Best Laid Plans"", ""Someone to Believe In"" and ""Modern Times"" reveal further interesting details about Alec, Felix, Jasper and Olivia's personalities.  The continuing romance between Gus and Felicity is also addressed in ""Otherwise Engaged"", and Janet is highlighted in ""The Minister's Wife"" and in ""Thursday's Child"".  Season Five is humorous, poignant, dramatic, and supremely satisfying.... while highlighting friendship, family bonds, and principles of loyalty.... all at the same time.

The quality of this series is unparalleled... excellent the first time you see it, or for the 100th.  Worth your time in viewing and worth every penny spent!",1369699200,,1074,5.401197604790419
2295537,5,B0009JKVT2,"We're now on the fifth season of Road to Avonlea as we love it. A great family show with fine acting and beautiful scenery. I found out about this series back when it first came out on The Disney Channel in 1990 I believe. I only got to see a part of this series back then because at that time The Disney Channel was a free station from my cable company and they changed it to a premium channel which I was not willing or able to afford then. So I finally found this dvd series on Amazon and have been ordering the seasons one at a time. I highly recommend it as it has great actors, the scenery and photography are beautifully done and it has endearing characters and good stories. If you are familiar with Anne of Green Gables and have seen that movie starring Megan Follows and Colleen Dewhurst then you will see some characters from that movie show up in this series. It also has some great guest star appearances as well.",1362700800,2,926,4.267045454545454
2295538,1,B0009JKVT2,"This is not a review.

This is a question about the product.

Is this the widescreen version in pseudo HD or not?
The text above reads that the aspect ratio is 1.33 : 1.

Is that a mistake in the product description?",1359504000,,216,4.095238095238095

Good follow-up for Green Gables. thanks",1358380800,,118,4.95
2295541,5,B0009JKVT2,"First off let me say that the rating is for the show, not for the company that I purchased it from.

Season Five of Road To Avonlea is great.  It brought back memories of me watching it with my family when I was younger.  For those of you who enjoyed the pervious seasons or the Anne of Green Gables movies, I'd highly recommend this show.

As for the my experience with the non-Amazon seller, I was disappointed.  I purchased seasons 5,6, and 7 from Standing Ovations.  I found their price to be reasonable and didn't mind spending shipping and handling for the price I was paying.  Since my transaction was for all three seasons and from the same company, I had emailed them to see if I could get a discount on my shipping.  I was charged $9.  No one got back to me regarding this matter.  When my package was shipped it was shipped media mail ($3.20) and arrived in a small box with newspaper as cushioning.  Now there is no way that between the box and the shipping that it cost $9.  For $9, better packaging material or faster shipping could have been used.  A little disappointed.",1358208000,,1086,4.396984924623116
2295542,5,B0009JKVT2,"I've been viewing the Road to Avonlea series again after several years, and the magic is still there. This is truly one of the best family friendly shows that ever aired on television. Produced as a spin-off from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anne-of-Green-Gables/dp/B00005YNTR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anne of Green Gables</a>&nbsp;(another of my favorites), this series was unique in the sense that it accorded equal time to both the children and adults residing in the town of Avonlea on Prince Edward Island. The earlier season focused a lot on the antics of the children as they interfered in the affairs of the adults, often with hilarious and at times poignant results. The latter season saw these children maturing and undergoing adolescent pangs, as they struggled to cope with emotions and events as they grew up.

Season 5 begins with the episode, ""Fathers and Sons"", one of the highlights of the season and also one that is bittersweet. Alec King (Cedric Smith) places heavy demands on his young son, Felix (Zachary Bennett)who is to inherit the King farm someday. Felix on the other hand has no real interest in the farm, preferring to work at the White Sands Hotel and dreams of opening his own Tea Room someday. This predictably does not go down well with Alex who takes pride in adhering to family traditions, but slowly comes to the realization that Felix needs to be able to have a dream of his own, and perhaps traditions can be changed. This happens to be one of my favorite RTA episodes!

The other episodes this season are:
Memento Mori - birthday celebrations for Hetty King's 50th do not turn out as expected
Modern Times - Hetty buys the cannery to prevent it from being turned into a distillery; Jasper and Olivia wish to buy the cannery despite their own financial troubles
A Friend in Need - Hetty and Sara babysit the Keith twins whilst Rachel Lynde goes out of town; Izzy Pettibone outgrows her tomboy phase
Strictly Melodrama - Janet and Hetty come to blows over a play
The Great Race - Felix enters a horse race despite Janet's misgivings
Stranger in the Night - Alec hires a new farmhand Caleb Stokes who might be hiding something
Someone to Believe In - Alec King gets involved in politics, and so does Felix, in a manner of speaking
Thursday's Child - tragedy strikes the King family when Cecily contracts TB
Best Laid Plans - Jasper comes up with a new invention but his unscrupulous cousin may get in the way of the Dales' success
Otherwise Engaged - Gus Pike proposes to Felicity King, but will Felicity accept given her desire to go to medical school?
Enter Prince Charming - Sara becomes involved with the new minister's son
The Minister's Wife - Janet and the Minister's wife get into trouble

This series is well-worth one's time - it is family-friendly, always has a positive message at the end, and affirms the bonds of family and friendship. Recommended!",1289433600,9,2946,4.935483870967742
