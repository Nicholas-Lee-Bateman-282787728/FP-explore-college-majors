7888844,5,6305320772,I have a friend that likes the As Time Goes By series.  I buy them as gifts to give to my friend.,1359244800,,97,3.409090909090909
7888845,5,6305320772,"I love every one of the volumes in this series.  Series acting has never been so good and the writing is also superb.  The price is hefty, but I don't regret it for a second.  These episodes are definitely worth watching many times.  My only complaint is - Where's the DVD version?  Why is BBC wasting time only releasing VHS?",991440000,4,326,4.366666666666666
7888846,5,6305320772,I have been immersed in this Brit Com since I first watched Video I and  then had to buy II.  I have also taped (just about) every episode from PBS  tv!  I feel as if I know these people...at least would want to know them!  Who would not want to live in that household?  If I were Sandy I would  definitely stay on even if Judy moves out to marry Alistar!  After one  watches all these episodes you will crave for more! And never tire of  watching the shows over and over!  The English vocabulary is a pleasure!  I cannot get enough of the series...not only the most romantic  story-line..dialogue but do not overlook the home decor!  Isn't is  fabulous!  The kitchen I could live in forever and the kitchen out at  Lionel's manor one could die in!  I recommend these tapes as the best ever!,969321600,9,791,4.301369863013699
7888847,5,6305320772,"The second volume of this British drama-comedy sees the further set-up of basic tensions that will run through the entire six-season series.  Here, though, the emphasis shifts somewhat away from the basic Lionel-Jean  storyline, and fleshes out both the secondary series plotline and  relationships with the supporting cast.
That secondary plot has to do  with Lionel's somewhat questionable writing talent.  In the middle episode  on this tape, romance gets pushed aside somewhat as Jean has to inform  Lionel that his characters lack passion.  When Alastair confirms Jean's  assessment, Lionel is forced, not for the last time in the series, to  painfully (and comically) revisit his work.
Of course, the real  substance of these three episodes is in the development of the secondary  characters.  We get a better impression here of Alastair, Lionel's book  agent and Jean's would-be suitor.  Judith, Jean's daughter, is also greatly  amplified in these episodes, with Lionel attempting to move his affections  from mother to daughter, and the daughter, in the ""Picnic""  episode, eventually transferring her affections elsewhere.
Indeed,  these three episodes are perhaps best thought of as having to do with  misdirected love.  And though much is left unresolved by the end of the  last episode (which also ended the first season), Lionel and Jean are  forced to admit that they have more in common than just their 40-year old  wartime love story.  It was an intriguing enough ending to ensure that the  BBC renew for a second season, and it's certainly enough to make you order  volume three of this outstanding series.",959990400,11,1623,5.214007782101167
7888848,5,6305320772,"This is absolutely the most wonderfully written and acted British comedy series ever aired in the US! And between Geoffrey Palmer as Lionel and Philip Bretherton as Alistair (who happens to be gorgeous), I cannot imagine a show with handsomer leading men!  Of course, Judi  Dench is no slouch either and Moira Brooker is really charming, so there's  an excellent cast. The writing is very good - subtle humor and warmth that you  don't normally get from Britcoms. I can't help but gush - buy all of the videos and get to know these people!",956707200,5,539,4.6421052631578945
7888849,5,6305320772,"The further adventures (or mis-adventures) of Jean & Lionel are hysterical!  There are so many ""bumps"" on their road to true love.  This is surely one of the better Brit-Coms.  I can't wait for the  rest of the series to be out on video!",949622400,5,237,4.318181818181818
7888850,5,6305320772,"As with all programmes written by Bob Larbey, ""As Time Goes By"" is pure excellence.  Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer give flawless performances. Larbey's writing is witty and fresh, and the premise of the  show unique. Larbey's genuis, acheived in other shows such as ""The  Good Life"", shines through. ""As Time Goes By"" is one of the  finest programmes ever to be broadcast anywhere. If you enjoy British  comedy, you won't be disappointed.",932774400,5,439,4.958904109589041
7888851,5,6305320772,"""As Time Goes By"" is truly one of the finest television series I have ever seen, American, British or otherwise.  The acting is terrific and the writing very clever and funny.  I hope there will be more videos very  soon!",925862400,4,221,4.475
7888852,5,6305320772,"With recent Oscar winner Judi Dench in the lead, Geoffrey Palmer as her long sweetheart and scripts by that great Britcom wordsmith Bob Larbey, this series is a pure delight for viewers who want substance and quality in  a television show.  The premise is that two young lovers who lost touch  during the Korean War meet again after a 38 year separation. Watching the  new relationship unfold in each episode is a treat for all ages. This  series which began in 1992 on the BBC will start taping its 8th season  soon.  Believe me, if you watch the first 11 episodes, you will fall in  love with the characters and want more. Philip Bertherton, Moira Booker,  Jenny Funnell, Frank Middlemass, Joan Sims and Janet Henfrey round out a  truly remarkable cast.",924134400,7,755,4.694656488549619
