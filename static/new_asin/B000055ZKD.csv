1395291,5,B000055ZKD,I was very lucky to get to watch this event from my fifth row seat. It was fantastic.  The match of the night was undoubtably Jeff Hardy vs RVD.  All the high spots were hit and these guys put there bodies on the line.  The finish to the main event was unbelievable.  Just a another reason to buy this one.,998006400,,306,4.05
1395292,5,B000055ZKD,First and Formost I had to go to 3 different places just to find a place to watch it in Indianapolis. The First match I saw was: Reagal vs. Raven-This match was pointless because Raven ... and he only won cause Tazz interfered. 1/2* Tajiri vs. Tazz. It was alright-*** Then RVD vs. Jeff Hardy - great match - ***** Tag Team Bra and Panties match - ***** Inagural Brawl - ***** This pay-per-view was alot better than King Of The Ring but it doesn't compare to Judgment Day and Backlash,997401600,,484,4.329670329670329

Most of the matches are very interesting, but there is one match that I'm still disappointed with.  The Inaugural Brawl.  It's not the match itself, it's what happens at the end.

1395322,2,B000055ZKD,"Before I get stated, why are most of you people writing reviews about a fantasy WWE vs. TNA event that isn't going to happen!  Take that crap to a fantasy league or something but it doesn't belong here wasting space for the ACTUAL DVD REVIEWS!

Now that I got that rant out the way, this was the beginning of the WWF vs. WCW/ECW ""Invasion"" storyline that would consume the WWF for most of 2001.  This PPV kicked it off & it actually was a good start to the storyline as we got some fantasy matchups here that people wanted to see.  The only problems here were that half the PPV was filled with ""filler"" matches that people could really care less about and only put on here to get as much of the current ""WCW"" roster & old ECW alumni on the card.

Edge & Christian vs Mike Awesome & Lance Storm - This was a good opener at Awesome & Storm made a good combination in WCW while E&C were one of WWF's best (if not THE BEST) tag teams at that time.  Good & fasted paced which as a good way to kick off the PPV.

WWF Referee Earl Hebner vs. WCW Referee Nick Patrick with Mick Foley as the special referee - Suppost to be a comedic match but was really just crap.

WWF Tag Team Champions APA vs WCW Tag Team Champions Sean'O Haire & Chuck Palumbo - The first of ""champions vs. champions"" matches but nothing really memorable here but it was a good match to watch.

WWF Light Heavyweight Champion X-Pac vs WCW Champion Billy Kidman - The match itself didn't go real long but it was an average match between the two but they would go on to have better later in the year.

William Regal vs Raven - This was a filler match that was really just there & boring for the most part.

Big Show, Albert, Billy Gunn vs Kanyon, Hugh Morris, Shawn Stasiack - Another filler match that was just there like the previous match, again nothing special here.

Tajiri vs Tazz - If your expecting the type of match they had at ""Heatwave '99"" then look elsewhere because you won't get it here as this was real quick & again, nothing memorable.

WWF Hardcore Champion Jeff Hardy vs RVD - It's ironic that RVD's first WWE match was against Jeff Hardy & his return match is against Hardy once again. Hardy & RVD have similar styles so this match stole the show and was one of top matches of the year. Hardcore match except they were high flyin' & everything instead of bashing each other's heads in with weapons. Great match.

Bra & Panties Match: Torrie Wilson & Stacy Keibler vs Trish Stratus & Lita - This is exactly what you would expect it to be...the T&A segment of the night.

Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kane, Undertaker, Chris Jericho, Kurt Angle vs. Booker T, DDP, Dudley Boyz, Rhino - This resembled just about every other multiman main event at a PPV in which it was well paced brawl for everyone involved to get their moments along with cool spots at the end before the finish happens.  A fun main event.

In the end, there were only three matches worth talking about and the match of the night is available on a better DVD worth the money you would pay for it (RVD's ""One Of A Kind"" DVD) so I would suggest that if you can get this cheap or used, then go head but otherwise it's passable.",1175644800,4,3166,4.2675585284280935

1395334,4,B000055ZKD,"This show was really solid, one of the only gripes I had throughout the show was that both J.R and Michael Cole were doing commentary, and they both hold the same role as play-by-play commentator. That made the commentary kind of repetitive with both guys repeating what each other was saying. It's a little problem, but other than that it got better as it went.

I loved how the crowd was really into the event and when a match was bad you could hera it from the crowd. This was definitely evident in the Regal/Raven match. I don't know what it is about this show that I liked, but the fact that I was really into the whole WWF vs. ECW/WCW angle, it was fun to watch it all unfold.

The best matches of the night was Edge & Christian vs Awesome & Storm, Hardy vs. RVD for the Hardcore title, and of course the Inaugural Brawl. I'll finish off with my assessment of the main event, it was one of the most entertaining non-title main events I've ever seen at any PPV. There was total non-stop action (no pun intended) and storylines throughout. there were brawls and some mat wrestling (with Kurt how can you not), and then there were table spots. The match was a great finish a to a solid show and the match made the show one of the best of 2001 in my opinion. I won't say what happened in the end vecause everyone else will do that, but I'll tell you that this match has more twiests and turns than a Prison Break episode.",1161043200,,1423,4.266666666666667

Chris Jericho, Stone Cold, Undertaker, Kane, and Kurt Angle VS DDP, Dudley Boys, Rhino, and Booker T: A match that went on for way to long and WWF dominated most of the match, with the Alliance only getting a few shots here and there.

Wow!  Entertaining.  These four are hot.  I don't agree with it being picked as one of the matches of the year.  (7/10)

10. DDP, Rhyno, Dudley's, Booker T (WCW/ECW) vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Undertaker, Kane, & Chris Jericho (WWF) (Inaugural Brawl - Ten Man Tag Match)

Pretty exciting match, especially the end.  Very shocking ending.  (8.5/10)

Good PPV.  I recommend picking this one up for the Hardcore Title match.  It is worth the price.  This DVD is not a must have for your collection.

1395367,2,B000055ZKD,"THE 1ST WWE PPV TO EVER FEATURE THE WWE-OWNED WCW IS AN ULTIMATELY DISSAPOINTING EVENT. ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I SAY THIS IS THE SUFFICIENT LACK OF TITLE MATCHES. I REALLY THINK THE ADDITION OF ECW AND THE FACT THAT EVERY MATCH ON EVERY SHOW WAS AN INTERPROMOTIONAL MATCH WAS THE MAIN REASONS AS TO WHY WCW FAILED MISERABLY IN THE WWE. I ACTUALLY ORDERED THIS PAY-PER-VIEW
BACK IN 2001 [WHICH COSTED $29.99, WHICH WAS $5.00 LESS THAN THE USUAL WWE PAY-PER-VIEW]. HERE'S MY THOUGHTS ON THESE MATCHES;

1. EDGE & CHRISTIAN [WWE] VS. LANCE STORM & MIKE AWESOME [WCW/ECW]
AVERAGE OPENER. NOTHING SPECIAL. RATING; 2.5/5

2. EARL HEBNER [WWE] VS. NICK PATRICK [WCW/ECW]
THEY COULD'VE DONE THIS ON RAW OR SMACKDOWN INSTEAD OF THIS PAY-PER-VIEW! WHAT A TIME-WASTER! RATING; 0/5

3. NON TITLE MATCH
WWE TAG CHAMPIONS THE ACOLYTES [BRADSHAW & FAAROOQ] VS. WCW TAG CHAMPIONS SEAN O HAIRE & CHUCK PALUMBO
BORING MATCH. FACT THAT NO TITLES ARE ON THE LINE MAKES THIS A POINTLESS MATCH. RATING; 2/5

4. NON TITLE MATCH
WWE LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION X-PAC VS. WCW CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPION BILLY KIDMAN
THIS WAS A LITTLE BETTER THAN THE 1ST 3 MATCHES. RATING; 3/5

5. WILLIAM REGAL [WWE] VS. RAVEN [WCW/ECW]
UP BY THIS POINT, I FELT LIKE I WAS WATCHING A BAD EPISODE OF RAW. RATING; 2/5

6. THE BIG SHOW, ALBERT, & BILLY GUNN [WWE] VS. KANYON, HUGH MORRUS, & SHAWN STASIAK [WCW/ECW]
NOTHING THAT REALLY INTERESTED ME HERE. BIG SHOW REALLY DESERVES MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. RATING; 1.5/5

7. TAJIRI [WWE] VS. TAZZ [WCW/ECW]
WELL, IT'S ALWAYS INTERESTING TO SEE 2 FORMER ECW RIVALS FACE EACH OTHER IN THE WWE. RATING; 3/5

8. FOR THE WWE HARDCORE CHAMPIONSHIP
JEFF HARDY [WWE] VS. ROB VAN DAM [WCW/ECW]
THE BEST MATCH OF THIS EVENT BY A LONG SHOT. IN MY MIND, THIS WAS THE REAL MAIN EVENT OF INVASION. RATING; 5/5

9. BRA & PANTIES TAG MATCH

To save writing it loads of times, the WWE side are first, folllowed by Alliance side for each match.
Edge & Christian V Mike Awesome and Lance Storm
This was a pretty good opening bout and the crowd were into it. 7/10
APA V Chuck Palumbo and Sean O'Haire
This was Tag champs V Tag champs with no titles on the line. It was an ok match, but nothing special at all. Not as good as the previous match. 5/10
Earl Hebner V Nick Patrick - Guest Ref: Mick foley
Ref V Ref? Come on WWE, this is crap! It was pretty funny to watch though and the crowd were getting into it. 4/10
X-Pac V Kidman
This was another champ V champ match, but it was weird because no one liked X-Pac, even though he was on team WWE. People actually preferred Kidman, cheering for him instead! However, the actual wrestling was great, with some brilliant ariel moves. 7/10
William Regal V Raven
Regal was actually quite cool as a face, but the match was nothing special. Got quite boring. 5/10
Big Show, Billy Gunn and Albert V Shawn Stasiak, Kanyon and Hugh Morrus
This was an alright match. After the match ends Show, Gunn and Albert beat up Stasiak, Kanyon and Morrus. 6/10
Tajiri V Tazz
A decent enough match, but nothing special happened in it. 6/10
Hardcore Title - Jeff Hardy V Rob Van Dam
The only title match of the show. I don't know why everyone thought this was so good really. It was good, but it could have been better. They use a chair and the title, and Jeff takes a cool bump of the ladder. 2nd best match of the night. 8/10
Bra and Panties Match - Trish and Lita V Torrie and Stacy
For a womens match this was actually really good. The match type maybe stupid, but it was cool. 7/10
The Inaugural Brawl - Team WWE V Team WCW/ECW Alliance
Stone Cold, Kurt Angle, Undertaker, Kane and Jericho V
Booker T, Rhyno, DDP and Dudleys Boys
Although this could have been better, the action was great and very exciting, and it was the best match of the night. The crowd are crazy, especially for Austin. By the end of the match, the whole thing has gone wild, with Taker chasing DDP into the crowd. When Austin boots Angle the crowd go absolutley mental. At the end Austin joins the Alliance in one hell of a shocker! 8/10
Overall
The main event and hardcore title matches were good, and some other matches were decent, but overall the PPV didn't live up to expectations. Not enough WCW/ECW wrestlers were involved - they should have had Hogan, Flair, Bret Hart, Goldberg and loads more.

1395369,4,B000055ZKD,"I'm writing this in early 2004, and these days this DVD can be picked up for less then ten bucks. If you're a wrestling fan, it's one hell of a buy.
This of course is the first Pay Per View that featured the WWF vs. the WCW/ECW alliance, and bills itself as such, with ""interpromotional matches.""
The main event, the ""Inagural Brawl"" pits Team WWF, consisting of Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, the Undertaker, and Kane, against Team WCW/ECW (""the Alliance"" name hadn't been used yet), which has Booker T, Diamond Dallas Page, the Dudley Boyz, and Rhyno. This is one hell of a fantastic match with a great finish. I won't spoil it for those that haven't seen the PPV, but anybody who was watching during the Alliance angle are sure to remember the turn of events that led to victory.
Another great match on this disk is Rob Van Dam vs. Jeff Hardy, in a Hardcore title match. As you'd expect with Jeff in there, a ladder definately gets involved. I believe this was RVD's first televised match after signing with the WWF, and it's pretty amazing how the crowd is booing him at the start of the match, but then --- ah, I won't spoil it. :)
Other then those top two matches, the disk is loaded with a lot of tag team and singles contests, and all are very solid. There also is an appearance by Mick Foley!
I'd say any Wrestling fan should be happy with this purchase, especially since right now you can get it for so cheap.",1075507200,,1429,4.39622641509434

The matches some were good, otehrs were not.  FOr example RVD vs Jeff HArdey was phenominal.  However Lita and Trish Strats vs Torrie Wilson vs Stacy Keibler Bra And PAnties was just for Eye Candy.  The funniest match however was Earl Hebner vs Nick Patric.  IT is by far not a good match, but the fact that they threw two refferees together, followed by Mick Foley reffereing the match it was very funny.
In the end it built up for the Invasion storyline which lasted the next few months.  Set up Kurt Angle as the Hero he was should of been early on and Stone COld as the Villian that drives us nuts.  Decent overall.",1028678400,,765,4.352112676056338

1395376,3,B000055ZKD,"This show is everything wrong with the WWF wrapped into one neat little show.  Shane McMahon's WCW set up shop on Raw one night in an effort to showcase WCW wrestling.  The crowd walked out even before the match started.  Drastic change was needed, so the next week Shane turned heel and Paul Heyman reunited with ECW castoffs in an awesome Raw moment.  A beatdown followed and suddenly ECW and WCW were a threat to the WWF.  Ten seconds later Stephanie McMahon was introduced as the new owner of ECW and everything fell apart.
For comparison, when the NWO invaded Kevin Nash powerbombed then-announcer Eric Bischoff through a table.  A few weeks later Bobby Heenan left the ringside area saying he didn't feel safe.  The NWO jumped some guys in the parking lot and when tiny Rey Mysterio Jr. tried to stop them, Nash through him into the side of a trailer like a lawn dart.  One of the men receiving the beatdown said that he saw four NWO members (at that time it was just Hogan, Hall, and Nash).  THAT is the way you start an invasion.  Speculation was that it would be Bret Hart (who was unhappy with the WWF at the time) introduced as the fourth man.  That kind of speculation and real fear that WCW might be destroyed forever fueled an 18-month dominance over the WWF.
Let's cut this ... open and see what killed him.
Edge/Christian vs. Awesome/Storm - Great way to open the show.  Typical tag formula with the heels pounding on one guy until he gets the hot tag.  Very reminiscent of the old Rock `n' Roll Express vs. The Midnight Express matches.  ***1/2
It should be noted, though, that Paul Heyman (ECW/WCW) is doing commentary with Jim Ross (WWF) and they simply trade quips as they did before the invasion started.  Mistake #1.  Heyman's commentary should have been filled with the same bile and hatred that his rant on Raw was.
Nick Patrick vs. Earl Hebner - I think that once it was announced that Vince had bought WCW every wrestling fan was salivating for this match.  Or not. -****
APA vs. Palumbo/O'Haire - Mistake #2.  Vince doesn't want to admit that WCW might have some better talent even though he owns BOTH promotions now.  Wrong guys go over here killing any heat for the WCW guys.  It would get worse for Palumbo. **
Billy Kidman vs. X-Pac - Good, quick match.  These guys are capable of more, though.  Nice to see the Shooting Star Press again! ***
William Regal vs. Raven - Mistake #3.  Not really WWF's fault here.  Regal is a natural heel, but is forced to play a babyface.  Crowd is not enthused.  (See also: X-Pac vs. Kidman) *1/2
Big Show, Billy Gunn & Albert vs. Kanyon, Morrus, & Stasiak. - Next! *
Tajiri vs. Tazz - Should have been much better.  **
Hardcore Title - Jeff Hardy vs. Rob Van Dam - Great way to introduce RVD to the WWF crowd.  High-flying match with good bumps, but nothing that would severely injure anyone. (Kudos to the WWF for toning that trend down). ***1/2
Bra & Panties Match - Trish/Lita vs. Stacy/Torrie - They picked the four best-looking ones. DUD
Booker T, DDP, Rhyno, & Dudleyz vs. Austin, Angle, Jericho, UT & Kane.
Mistake #4 Why would a guy fight in a twenty-minute match, THEN turn on his team?  Wouldn't you just turn on them as soon as you got out there?  I won't say whom, but you probably already know.  Good match until the turn.  ***1/2
In the end - This show is required viewing just to see why the WWF lost twenty percent of their audience over a three month period.  Watch the E & C vs. Awesome/Storm match and the Hardy/RVD match.  Everything else is avoidable.  Recommended for historical value only.",1017792000,,3577,4.493023255813953

1395378,4,B000055ZKD,"I have to give it 4 stars for a few reasons.  First and foremost is the RVD/Jeff Hardy match probably the best match of the year.  This is the closest RVD will ever get to his ECW days in the WWF and Hardy is the perfect opponent to let RVD show why he is the whole F'N show and all that Mr. PPV stuff too.  Other matches to note Kidnman and X-Pac who hasn't compared these two before???  They lived up to the hype nd deliver.  Tajiri and Tazz was pretty good as well, but we all Tazz (along with Awesome) are more imposing then the federation are letting them be.  Now maybe its because I'm a dude, btu the bra and panties match was very very VERY entertaining, nice reversals, probably the best in the history of the sport.  Some low points however are the Regal/Raven match (who put this together?), The Patrick/Herpner match (utterably horrible), and the main event which was a complete dud.  Austin defineatly doesn't look like the Stone Cold of the old btu does do a good job ruining Rhyno's poise as even the slightest threat to anyone which is a shame.  DDP is absolutely horrible here, I was expecting more out of the two time two time, umm anyway the match was like 45 minutes and wasn't anything minutely it could have been.  But its a defineate worth buying.  the DVD has a few good extras like Rob Van Dam invades, which is like a 10 minutes profile on RVD, and before and after interviews.  But the only thing thats missing is the Kurt Angle afterwards, you click you get absolutely NOTHING.  Good DVD.",1009670400,3,1516,4.371428571428571

The main event was pretty boring (i hate tagmainevents).
regal and raven had a bad night and i expected a bit more from kidman and x-pac.
If you want to see 1 of x-pac's best matches get summerslam 2001, he was vs tajiri and it was a very good match, and not to mention summerslam 2001 is WAAAAAAAAAAAAy  better!!!!
And wrestlemania 17 even tops that so id suggest to get wrestlemania 17 even if it didn't have the whole fn show it had a breath taking TLC2 match which topped there TLC1 match.

The biggest problem with the WWF ppv is that there are never more than 3 good matches and the rest are all fillers of time. Do yourself a favor and get an ECW DVD instead.

What i am trying to say is he pulled a wall over everyone's eyes. Even mine and i can usually predict what happens every time. I give props to Vince Mcmahon on the planing of this event. What? i said props to Mcmahon! Another thing if your wondering why i still like Austin...Well heres why 1. Hes the best and allways will be. 2. Hes funny as all hell, what? LOL. 3. Any true wrestling fan knows that you cant just turn your back on ur favorites just because of there actions. I have a friend actually who has liked kurt angle since he came into WWF, Angle started becoming cool after invasion, and then BAM like the little rat he is, he joins the allience....WHY? ill tell you. HES SCARED OUT OF HIS MIND OF AUSTIN. It's true It's damn true! Even after Angle went over to the allience my friend still likes kurt. So you can't bust on me for liking austin.

No music on main title page - what happened to PRESENTATION guys!?!
The 'exclusive backstage footage' - if I wanted to see Hugh Morris doing squats and Jericho putting his babyoil on I'd subscribe to a 'hidden cam' xxx page. They are a waste of everybody's time.
However I DID enjoy the event and here it is in crystal clear audio and nice (if occasionally pixally) visuals, buy it if you want a little bit of history.",1004140800,,535,4.36
1395385,4,B000055ZKD,"Even though this was not the perfect inter-promotional PPV we all had in our heads, it was still a good, solid PPV, and most of all a historic event.
Edge and Christian vs. Lance Storm and Mike Awesome- Seriously underrated match; a very good one and a great opener. Very entertaining match.
Earl Hebner vs. Nick Patrick- WTF is this? What a waste of PPV time. DUD.
APA vs. Palumbo and O'Haire- A pretty weak match but it was still okay, an average brawl.
Billy Kidman vs. X-Pac- Good match. This was the only one where the fans weren't behind the WWF guy. Sad how much they hate X-Pac. Good high-flying/technical match, but I was expecting a little more.
Raven vs. William Regal- Nothing great, just another match on the card. The fans aren't into this one AT ALL which makes it tough to get into yourself. Gets pretty boring.
Big Show, Billy Gunn and Albert vs. Hugh Morrus, Kanyon, and Shawn Stasiak- Bathroom break match of the night. Not terrible with a good spot or two (like three guys being pressed at the same time) but really, who cares?
Tazz vs. Tajiri- Uh... I barely remember this match (as you can see it made a huge impact on me) but I was expecting alot only to be let down. It was okay I guess...
Jeff Hardy vs. RVD- Wicked hot match. The best of the night, very entertaining spotfest, it was actually more amazing that I expected!
Torrie and Stacy vs. Lita and Trish- Whoo hoo! It's a bra and panties match! Actually I was disapointed that we didn't see a little more, but still great for what it is.
Inagural Brawl- I actually liked this match- mainly because I expected nothing. A couple of cool spots and alot of emotion, but still, it's a ten man tag match involving the Undertaker...
Buy it for a few great matches and the history- don't for the fact that ""InVasion"" should have been so much more.",1000857600,5,1820,4.435820895522388
1395386,3,B000055ZKD,"For years and years the wrestling world had been waiting to see WWF vs. WCW, and in July 2001 we finally got it. However overbooking this ""Superbowl of Wrestling"" into another McMahon family feud, made Invasion a disapointing PPV. The reason the rating for this tape is *** is because there are a couple of pretty good wrestling matches on here, being Lance Storm & Mike Aweosme vs. Edge & Christian, as well as the Hardcore Title Match between Rob Van Dam and Jeff Hardy. While the WWF always puts out stellar DVDs, this one is by no means a must-have and probably only belongs in the collection of a die-hard wrestling fan.",998784000,,625,4.539823008849558

Yeah, it could've been better had they had superstars like: Goldberg, Sting or Scott Steiner had they come over but it wasn't time for them to appear. Some former stars were still under contract waiting for their chance to renegotiate and start fresh while other came over who were held back and overlooked. It was really the new blood of talent with stars like: Rob van Dam, Billy Kidman, Booker T., Diamond Dallas Page, Lance Storm, Rhyno and the list goes on. For me, it was extremely unique seeing: Undertaker, Stone Cold, Chris Jericho and Kurt Angle beef with these stars which all came ahead at the Invasion pay per view. I thoroughly enjoyed it all and believe any old wrestling fan of the Monday Night Wars would appreciate the concept and respect the idea brought forth.",1525651200,,931,4.682926829268292

7931463,3,B000055ZKD,"1.) Lance Storm and Mike Awesome vs Edge and Christian

We start off with a hot tag team opening that coincidentally is all-Canadian. The crowd is on fire for Edge and Christian and we a good display of competitiveness. Awesome and Storm end up working over Christian for a good portion of the match. Edge gets the hot tag taking out Storm and Awesome with a clothesline and spinning wheel kick. Things get chaotic nearing the end with all 4 participants getting involved in the match at once and a fair amount of false finishes. Edge takes a superkick from Storm, letting Awesome get the win but Edge gets the shoulder up at 2. Awesome prepares to finish Edge off with the Awesome Bomb but Christian runs in and Spears Awesome. Edge makes the cover for the win

Vince McMahon is in his office, hilariously celebrating Edge and Christian's victory when William Regal walks in and informs Vince McMahon that Stone Cold Steve Austin and Debra have arrived at the arena. McMahon refers to Austin as the ""old Stone Cold"" and advises Regal to give them some space before giving him a pep talk for his upcoming match with Raven

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) Nick Patrick w/WCW referees vs Earl Hebner w/WWF referees

This was a ridiculous part of the Invasion to say the least. Because if you're going to do the Invasion angle, you might as well milk every last drop out of that cow and throw in a referee feud. Mick Foley was the special referee for this thankfully short match. Back and forth brawling between Patrick and Hebner. The outside referees get in a fight and Foley ejects them from ringside. Hebner takes Patrick down with a shoulder tackle and gets the win. Patrick argues with Foley after the match about the outcome and lays Patrick out with the Mandible Claw. Short and bittersweet.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) WWF vs WCW Tag Team Championship Match: APA (c) vs Sean O' Haire and Chuck Palumbo (c)

To put it simple the APA were the WWF Tag Team Champions, while O' Haire and Palumbo were the WCW Tag Team Champions. The winners of this match would become owners of both titles. Because this match consisted of all powerhouses, there weren't too many noteworthy or impressive things going on here. If you're a fan of big powerhouse matches, I suppose you'll like this. In the end, Bradshaw gets the win for the team with the Clothesline From Hell on Palumbo

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) WWF Light Heavyweight Champion vs WCW Cruiserweight Champion: X-Pac (c) vs Billy Kidman (c)

Unlike the previous match; this was Champion vs Champion, but the titles weren't on the line. This was the only match of the night in which an Alliance superstar was the babyface while the WWF superstar was the heel. In reality Kidman was the heel while X-Pac was face but because fans still hated X-Pac during this time, he was treated and booed as the heel, while fans treated Kidman as the babyface. It's safe to say that X-Pac never recovered from his ""X-Pac heat"" after his 1999 heel turn. Not if he was still getting booed in 2001. X-Pac sucks chants begin within the opening seconds of the match but this was actually a really solid and tight fast paced, Cruiserweight bout here. We get a sleeper wear down from X-Pac on Kidman at one point but luckily it doesn't slow down the pace of the match at all. Kidman counters an attempted Bronco Buster with a foot to Pac's upper groin. Kidman goes up top and flies down on to X-Pac with the Shooting Star Press for the win.

Paul Heyman, Shane McMahon, and Stephanie McMahon are in their locker room, celebrating Kidman's win when DDP comes in and starts bragging about kidnapping Debra on the previous Smackdown but the 3 of them quickly stop DDP in his tracks and get him focused on the Inaugural Brawl and pumped for the match.

Elsewhere, Torrie Wilson and Stacy Keibler are in their locker room bragging about the audience won't be able to see their goods because they'll rip Trish and Lita's clothes off of them. They tease giving the Hardyz a private showing of their undergarments after the show

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) Raven vs William Regal

Two of WWE's underrated workers go to work in this standard match up. Fair paced action but it starts to slow down during the last 3 or 5 minutes. At one point there are a few faint ""boring"" chants heard in the crowd. I feel as if most of the crowd thought this match was boring, seeing as how most of them barely made a sound but I don't think it was that bad. At one point Regal and Raven collide, bumping heads and Raven falls to the outside of the ring. While the referee checks on Raven, Tazz runs down to the ring to some cheers from the crowd. You gotta figure they were happy to see Tazz because they knew that his interference, signified the end of the match. Tazz jumps in the ring and floors Regal with a gut wrench suplex. Raven re-enters the ring and drops Regal with the Raven Effect for the win. Decent match, but the crowd seemed to think otherwise.

Vince McMahon enters the Brothers of Destruction and Sara's locker room and gives them a motivational speech, reminding them of the horrendous things the Alliance has done to them and reminds Taker of DDP stalking Sara and making a Best of Sara compilation. Taker's heard enough and forces McMahon against the wall and tells Vince tonight they'll see the best of The Undertaker

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) The Big Show, Billy Gunn, and Albert vs Kanyon, Hugh Morrus, and Shawn Stasiak

The match starts with the babyface team getting a good pop from the crowd, giving the heel team military presses, simultaneously. Nothing impressive here and was clearly a filler match featuring the undercard stars from WWF and The Alliance to take up card space and time on the PPV. Shawn Stasiak drops Gunn with a Reverse DDT and Hugh Morrus makes the pin for the win. After the match, Big Show Chokeslams Stasiak and Morrus and flattens Kanyon with the Alley Oop

8.) WWF Hardcore Championship Match: RVD vs Jeff Hardy (c)

Jeff charges the ring after RVD and this highly competitive and fun match is underway. This was undoubtedly the best match that had happened so far on the card. You have a man who contributed to revolutionizing hardcore wrestling in ECW, battling someone who had spent the last year, inhabiting hardcore wrestling into his style and of course, they were battling it all out for the Hardcore Championship. This match definitely has its spots and moments. Perhaps the biggest and sickest moment of the match was when RVD pushed Jeff off on a ladder, set up on the outside, causing Jeff to take a loud smack to the floor. RVD soon followed it up with a Van Daminator, sending Jeff off the stage and to the pit of the Invasion stage. Jeff ends up busted open due to chair shots and after a hellacious battle; RVD wins with a 5 Star Frog Splash. This ladies and gentlemen was a Hardcore match and was amazing for the 12 minutes it got.

9.) Bra and Panties Tag Team Match: Torrie Wilson and Stacy Keibler vs Trish Stratus and Lita  (Special Referee: Mick Foley)

This match all came about when Torrie and Stacy began hitting on The Hardy Boyz who Lita and Trish were dating at the time. In addition to trying to steal their boyfriends, Stacy and Torrie were out to prove that they weren't only better looking than Trish and Lita but were more dominant than them as well. So then we find ourselves here in our first and only Bra & Panties tag team match. Torrie and Trish start things out with Trish getting the upperhand only to be stopped by Stacy. Trish takes them out and makes the tag to Lita and Torrie tags in Stacy. Stacy is the first to lose clothes as Lita rips Stacy's shirt off almost immediately. Stacy and Torrie double team Lita and Torrie holds Lita down while Stacy removes Lita's shirt. Torrie and Trish meet again and Torrie gets Trish's shirt, while Trish cleverly does a sunset flip pin reversal and takes off Torrie's pants. After a Poetry In Motion, Trish and Lita both remove Torrie's shirt. A bulldog and moonsault combo from Trish and Lita leave Stacy for easy pickings to have her pants stripped off from Trish and Lita for the win. Fairly entertaining sex appeal match but I can't be the only one who was hoping to see Stacy or Torrie have Lita laying in her bra and panties.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Backstage, we get a segment with Shane, Stephanie, and Heyman giving one last motivational speech to the Alliance members of the Inaugural Brawl. We then go to Stone Cold Steve Austin in his locker room where Vince goes in and tries to give him a pep talk but Austin cuts him off saying he's not here to sing, play guitar, or hug but whip some you know what and gives his signature ""And that's the bottom line"" quote.

10.) The Inaugural Brawl: Team Alliance: The Dudley Boyz, Rhyno, DDP, and Booker T w/ Stephanie McMahon, Shane McMahon, and Paul Heyman vs Team WWF: The Brothers of Destruction, Chris Jericho, Kurt Angle, and Stone Cold Steve Austin w/ Vince McMahon

The match gets started early as Undertaker on his way to the ring and a huge brawl breaks out. Austin arrives just seconds later and the crowd comes unglued at the sound of the shattering glass. The brawl eventually gets under control and the match goes onto the ring with Austin and Rhyno starting things out with Austin controlling Rhyno for the most part. For a great duration of the match, we get to see tremendous back and forth action from all competitors of the match. Eventually Angle gets caught in a major beat down from the Alliance members. Eventually a pier 6 brawl breaks out among all the competitors with action taking place all around the ringside area. DDP and Undertaker end up brawling through the crowd and somewhere to the back, Kane Chokeslams D-Von through one of the announcer's tables, Bubba and Rhyno suplex Kane through the other, Jericho sends Rhyno through one, and so much more fun and excitement! Angle tries for an Ankle Lock on Booker, but Booker reverses it and sends Angle crashing into the referee. The chaos continues with Shane knocking Vince's lights out with the WWF Championship. Just as Angle gets the Ankle Lock finally locked in on Booker, Austin slides back in the ring and in a big twist and unforeseen shocker; Austin turns heel, attacking Angle and laying him out with a Stunner. Stone Cold drapes Booker over Angle and the referee makes the count to give The Alliance the win. In an idealistic Invasion world, this match would've included the NWO, Sting, and Goldberg against Austin, Rock, HHH, Undertaker, and Angle but this was still an amazing and underrated match.

Overall: The first and last Invasion PPV was very standard to say the least. While it drew big money from PPV and ticket buys and even managed to sell out the arena, the show itself symbolized a horrific sign of things to come for the remainder of the Invasion story. When you've got two referees fighting each other, you know the storyline is in trouble. When you have one of your most over babyfaces join the Alliance, you know you're lacking stars/ Majority of the WCW/ECW superstars weren't even over with the fans. That's how bad it was. Most of the PPV felt like filler with forced feuds taking place just for the sake of taking up card space on the PPV. The best matches are undoubtedly the opening match, the Hardcore Championship match, and the Inaugural Brawl. The tag team bra & panties match was also fairly good...seeing as how it's main focal point was for sex appeal. Overall, Invasion passes as a decent PPV. Only a few matches on here were really worth the time, money, and watch. Everything else just seemed like a waste",1437523200,,14734,5.407504363001745
