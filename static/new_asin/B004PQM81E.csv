4444607,4,B004PQM81E,"There is just something great about all these black and white television shows!  Color just takes something away from it...

Though I'll admit the theme song is quite uh...stifeling...it's one of those that sticks in  your head.  I catch myself singing it and my son looks at me like I just lost my mind.  The episodes keep you interested and the quality of the videos are okay.  The acting leaves a lot to be desired, but it's good considering the time and budget back then.  I wish there were more than 20 episodes available though...",1356912000,,536,4.578947368421052
4444608,5,B004PQM81E,"OK, I admit it has a terrible theme song but it's a trip in a time machine.  A trip back to when good guys were good and bad guys were very very bad.  They all deserved stringin' up, especialy horse thieves!  It gives a tip of the hat to AZ Rangers who've too long been forgotten in the shadow of the TX Rangers.  It stars a man named Coffin.  Nuff Said.",1349395200,5,354,3.9295774647887325
4444609,3,B004PQM81E,"As a connoisseur of early TV shows, I am glad this typical 1950's Western was made available to consumers. For the record, the quality of the video is much better than indicated by one overly critical review that I perused before making my purchase, although I must admit it is far from perfect!  Nevertheless, I believe that this DVD represents good value for those who appreciate vintage television shows!",1338249600,31,407,4.898550724637682
4444610,5,B004PQM81E,"What I like about 26 men was it was just one good guy acting alone, with back up.  This was not a town western, but filmed on location in the real West.  Just plain and simple as I imagined it really was.  I have no way of verifying if 26 MEN was based on the files of the Arizona Rangers.

The TV 26 men used the standard Winchester rifle's from New Haven, and Colt's from Hartford. The horses did not carry fifty pounds of jangling silver while chasing down the bad guys.  No trick horses or dogs.  They did not wear uniforms. No guitars or harmonicas, secret caves, or whips, no capes.  No gimmicks, no badges, no fat funny sidekicks.  No sawed off rifles with big levers, shotguns or canes, or long barreled six shooters.  No silver bullets, no big butcher knives, and no half-rifles/half shotguns.  No dogs, or sure-shot sisters, or aeroplanes.  No personal shoot outs in the alley.  They did not drive a jeep.

There was one West Point trained knight without armor, no gimmick lone gunman roaming the West in those days, but he had a custom made signal action Colt .45 with rifling in the barrel, and a surprise get off me derringer in his belt.  But 26 men, was a simple plain good western, as good as any.  Anyone who likes old Westerns will like the 78 episodes of The 26 men if they can find them.",1332547200,3,1307,4.3429752066115705
4444611,5,B004PQM81E,"I recently saw an episode of ""26 Men"" on TV.  Being an avid watcher of Westerns I was thrilled to be reminded of this series.  Days later, while on Amazon I saw the 20 episodes being offered, so I ordered them, and have been very pleased with the series.  Upon ordering the series I received them in record time and they were in great condition.",1329523200,3,345,4.276923076923077
4444612,5,B004PQM81E,"This is one of those westerns that I do not recall watching while growing up in Western Australia during the 1950's - but then my memories were mostly of shows such as FURY and RIN TIN TIN.
I now possess a very large collection and happily include 26MEN along such as WAGON TRAIN and HGWT.
The acting of TRIS COFFIN as the Captain sets this show apart and it is good to see this actor on the side of the law for a change, for some reason this release does not appear to be numbered so I have now sent off for its companion which I now see came out a few years previously.
I enjoyed the understated humour of the episode ""TROUBLE AT PINNACLE PEAK"", with the Captain and his recruit creeping up on a gang located in a shack, sounds of a Harmonica comes out and the recruit says
""something about a Harmonica makes me sad""  and the Captain replies
""train whistles do it for me"".
Another section has the recruit saying to the Indian tracker ""Indians don't laugh""
with the tracker replying ""nothing to laugh about, but I laugh anyhow"".
Okay it sounds funny rather than reads funny.
As far as the condition of the DVD I found it to be very good when you consider the age of the film,
I wonder if much television in the present age of 2012 will still be viewed in 2062?
As one of the original Arizona Rangers recalled: ""The reason there was only 26 of us was because the Territory could't afford no more""!.
{I have since this review purchased the previous release which contains 2 DVD of 10 episodes,
these are the same as the above release so for me was a waste of money}",1326672000,29,1564,4.265993265993266
4444613,4,B004PQM81E,"The restoration job on these episodes is excellent. Very few had noticeable film defects. The stories are intriguing, since they are all true!

4444618,5,B004PQM81E,"I was curious about this series when I read the description about it on Amazon.  It seemed interesting so I watched a few episodes on You Tube and then ordered this 20 episode DVD set.  Many of the older TV shows are much better than what's currently on television now.  I've never seen this show on TV when it aired, but it has the mark of classic television which was very well written.  Some of the previous reviews were rather tough on the theme song, but compared to the theme from ""Rawhide"" it doesn't seem all that terrible. If you're a fan of the old westerns like ""The Lone Ranger"", ""Hop Along Cassidy"" or ""The Cisco Kid"" you'll find this series enjoyable.",1509148800,,665,4.426229508196721

4444647,5,B004PQM81E,"This turned out to be wonderfully horrible.  There are 3 discs with 20 episodes.  I have come to find out that 77 episodes were filmed.

I do not know why Timeless Media only brought us these 20, but they are fantastic!  All of these stories are based upon true accounts some even introduced by the Ranger involved.  All the location names are exact and living in Arizona I feel wonderfully connected to my states history.
There is very little bad about the show itself.  The only thing I can complain about is that for a show called ""26 Men"" we really only get to see 2.  On the actual Discs themselves, while the quality is good. No jumps or skips and the sound stays constant. There is nothing else other than just the episodes.  No commentary or insights into the making of.  Nor are there 77 episodes :(

The Rangers organization consisted of only twenty six men reason being (allegedly) that the Territory couldn't afford more men.  It was the Rangers sole duty to preserve and maintain law and order throughout the entire then Arizona Territory.  Each episode was complete in itself and depicted a story from the actual chronicles of the ""26 Men"".

Robert Blake for example.  At the beginning of one episode is a statement from a very old Arizona Ranger.  Priceless.  Lots of entertainment at a great price.  Glad to have 26 Men in my collection of Westerns.",1456790400,2,503,4.297872340425532

The opening title sequence seems to take up a third of each episode and reintroduces the background of the rangers every time.  We're viewers back then that forgetful?

4444696,5,B004PQM81E,"I enjoyed this far more than ""The Texan"" (which I never finished watching). The Arizona Ranger stories are based on real incidents so they didn't seem as contrived or as violent as the other series mentioned. There were even humorous stories in the set. I also lived in AZ for four years in southwest Tucson and the scenery brought back memories of the heat and vegetation I moved there to enjoy (but also left because it wasn' t as enjoyable as I hoped). I would like to see more episodes if they are ever put out in a dedicated series disc rather than a mixed collection of westerns.",1421020800,6,585,4.425925925925926

4444711,1,B004PQM81E,Too old and black and white.  Also the intro music got very old.  Plots were not up to par for my taste!!!!!,1403308800,,108,3.8636363636363638
4444712,5,B004PQM81E,"26 Men is a series that I missed during the golden age of TV Westerns. Maybe there was a conflict with some better known show since there were only 3 channels back then. Fortunately, I discovered it in a collection of westerns recently. This set is an incredible value at less than $5. Do not let the stories of the Arizona Rangers turn you off, sure I had never heard of them either, but the series is well done and Tris Coffin is perfectly cast as the Captain. Grab this amazing bargain.",1401408000,,489,4.326086956521739
4444713,5,B004PQM81E,"If you want action and less drama then this series is for you  It is non stop action for half an hour. However you do not see 26 men , the show only shows 2men.",1400112000,3,160,3.5714285714285716
4444714,4,B004PQM81E,"The stories were based on actual events in the history of the Arizona Rangers--""26 men"" who patrolled the wide open spaces of territorial Arizona around the turn of the 20th Century. Of course, there's a heavy dose of fiction thrown in, and the supporting actors are sometimes awful. But for once in his long career Tris Coffin gets to play a good guy, and he does a fine job in the lead. I'd follow him on a posse any time.",1397692800,,424,4.3125

4444716,3,B004PQM81E,Watched the first episode and liked the story but found the singing as well as bad quality picture too painful to finish this bad set. I have films dating back to the 20's and they are stunning tranfers. Old films may have scatches etc but if they were copy off video masers this is the crappy quality you get. Not recommended,1389830400,4,326,4.360655737704918

4444718,3,B004PQM81E,"The biggest problem I had with this series was the intro at the beginning. I found myself counting the ""twenty-six men,"" and the total never comes to twenty-six. I just wish they would've hired on twenty-six extras for the opening sequence. It's a lazy effort like that that carries into the show itself.",1383264000,,304,4.754716981132075

4444721,5,B004PQM81E,I love the shoe and feel it is a classic western tv series. I grew up watching it and it tells of the Arizona Rangers in their fight of crime in the old west. I would recommend it to all western fans and wish I could get the complete series.,1360368000,2,241,3.84
