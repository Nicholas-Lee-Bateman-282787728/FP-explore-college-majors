8507801,3,B0070JUQJY,"Huge fan of Fluffy. I think Gabrial has a very funny, clean act, that is mostly acceptable for families with tween kids or older.  However, I had never seen the Revolution show, so I had no idea that it was only hosted by Gabrial.  I don't care for the Revolution show. Gabrial's friends are not really my cup of good humor. Anyway, I gave that cd away.",1405814400,,353,4.253731343283582
