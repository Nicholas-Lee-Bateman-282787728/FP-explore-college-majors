Mostly what this is boils down to beautiful women in nice lingerie and glamorous makeup and hair, being photographed by another gorgeous woman in lingerie and glamorous makeup and hair.  Too bad the camera largely stays on their face and boobs with not that much below the waist and carefully chosen angles to avoid getting too explicit.  Some faux body rubbing, some bush (though not all the girls do full frontal nudity), some very subtle breathing and moaning occasionally.  But I wouldn't call this particularly stimulating - even Playboy or Penthouse were showing more than this.  The running time is about 55 minutes and the scenes are fairly short, so there are nine scenes of hot babes with some beautiful bodies to look at, and some nice voice-over intros as well.  I got a bit of an ASMR feeling from watching them be photographed, but not a lot of extra blood flowing between the thighs... occasionally one or two girls seemed to want to show more (I caught one bit of panty play that let a little labia slip briefly), but you could tell either they checked themselves, or the editing cut or faded right before getting there (always a frustrating move).

As for the VHS quality - it's pretty good, filled up my HD screen at least (no 4:3 aspect, thankfully) and wasn't too grainy considering its age and the fact that VHS rarely looks good on a 39"" LED TV.

I'd say if you're a collector and/or saw this when it first came out and formed some kind of bond with it, then it might be worth it... and like I said, these women are hot and the lingerie looks great.  But 30-40 bucks is steep for something that's only VHS quality, and considering it's pretty tame as well, yeah for me this was my introduction to the series and I don't think I'll be pursuing it further.",1423785600,,1991,4.523676880222841
