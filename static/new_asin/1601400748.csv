200834,5,1601400748,This dvd is wonderful! I got it as a bday gift for my co-worker's 15yr old daughter and even as a complete beginner she was able to instantly catch on!!!

200861,5,1601400748,once again I am very impressed with these learning to crochet DVDs. This DVD teaches you different stitches and ways to make things a little bit more fancy or flashy or wild.

200872,1,1601400748,"CONS
DVD ORGANIZATION - The organization of the topics was very unorganized. There were too many topics to choose and when you would pick one, it would only last 20 seconds. So you would have to keep pushing the ""play"" button every 20 seconds, then click on the next topic.

INSTRUCTOR
She rushed through how to hold the yarn. I watched it several times, but she went at 90 mph so i never learned.

CAMERA WORK
It seemed like a lot of vital moments were cut off. Like it would show the instructors hand with all the yarn placed on her finger instead of showing how she placed the yarn on her fingers

LACK OF PROJECT LESSONS
She never showed all of the projects step by step, the wash cloth only had written instructions, it never showed her doing the project. It was really weird.

I really wanted to learn to crochet, but this dvd was a huge disappointment. It is by  no means a way for a beginner to learn. And if you are advanced, then theres no need for a dvd such as this. On a side not, the instructor was posing in awkward positions and she was very serious. It was not fun at all.",1360281600,20,1089,4.216346153846154
200873,1,1601400748,"I do not recommend this DVD and the reason is, "" I don't know why this lady is going at the speed of light crocheting"".  Is she not suppose to be teaching us to crochet? I watched 5 times her doing this square and she is going so fast that you can't see anything she is doing.  She does at one point in the video say, "" I know it looks like I am going to fast but when you get more experienced with your crochet you will too."" Hello, lady! More experience is what we are trying to get too. So, after she flys through it with a blur she says,"" when you get too the point I am at press play and a crochet instruction for the square comes on the screen, duh!  You are going so fast that we will never get to the point of pressing play because you need to let us watch you crotchet. That is all I have for this DVD. I would give her no stars if I could. Next time you make a crotchet instructional dvd just remember it is too teach others whom has never touched a crotchet needle before that is why we ordered your intructional video and (slow down).",1358380800,38,1046,3.947867298578199
200874,5,1601400748,This video breaks down the stitches and not only shows you how to do them but the yalso break each stitch down into an index that you can refer back to if needed. I was crocheting in one day.,1357776000,,191,3.923076923076923
200875,4,1601400748,It is good for what I want to learn. I would recommend it to other people to learn this skill.,1357084800,,94,3.75
200876,5,1601400748,"I hesitated buying this DVD due to some reviews here, but I ended biting the bullet and going through with it. I am happy that I did!

The instructions for how to crochet are very clearly spelled out to you. The host, Melissa, goes slowly and carefully so that you don't miss a thing. She gives tips and tricks as she goes through the various techniques. Some other reviewers claim she is wooden, and doesn't smile. I guess I didn't notice this while watching her; rather, she seemed professional and knowledgeable. I enjoyed watching her and learning with her.

Another great thing are the camera angles: the working yarn and the stitching are always easy to see. There is also a great feature where a smaller screen is over laid at the bottom corner with the picture reversed for lefties.

Finally, some seemed put off by the way the DVD refused to just play through from start to finish. I noticed this as well, but as a total beginner I found it was nice to slow down and focus keenly on each step. Later, I noticed that there is a 'play all' option on the main menu that took care of the problem. It allows the viewer to choose how to interact with the material.

I bought this along with a book Teach Yourself VISUALLY Crochet (Teach Yourself VISUALLY Consumer) because I learn best visually, but find the book is a good backup resource to have.

I should mention that when I got the dvd, it was loose inside it's case (so it kind of flopped around in transit. If works fine, but has a few scratches. So check yours carefully when if arrives!)

200879,1,1601400748,"Terrible video for those just learning. She moves too quickly and expects the viewer to rewind and replay parts in order to catch up.

200881,5,1601400748,"As a beginner with crochet, I love the stitch along and close up video to see how to create stitches.  I also like the way the video takes you along with an actual project and shows how to complete a row.  The best purchase ever and instructions are easy to follow.",1322006400,2,265,4.176470588235294
200882,5,1601400748,"This video fixed what was wrong with my crochet technique. I had checked out book after book and watched You tube videos and still couldn't make a straight block. After watching this DVD once all the way through I had a half dozen ""Ah Hah"" moments, the second time through, I was able to imagine myself doing the stitches and the third time through I was almost able to to keep up with the demonstrator.  It has chapter features which let you view the short segments as many times as you need, and has actual projects you can do, broken down into each separate part so you will never fall behind, just hit repeat and see the stitches again. Only move forward when you are ready.
It explains all the basic stitches, and how to read a pattern, and how to increase, decrease,and all the other basic stitch processes.  From this video, I can now easily read the books that formerly flummoxed me, and I can figure out patterns that weren't shown even in the video.

I would recommend this DVD for anyone who is having trouble even after looking at the hand drawn pictures and photographs in books that just don't show the process in action. Last summer I spent months making trapezoids and batwings and pulling out yards of yarn over and over, now after three short viewings of this DVD, I have finished my first scarf and I'm working on two projects at the same time.",1321920000,4,1363,4.465863453815261

It doesn't even say what size it is, but after I bought a kit I matched it and I think it was like a size h or something... i don't remember... Anyways the crochet hook is the only real bad thing in this kit. Plus the fact that the patterns require the different hooks that isn't even that size on the crochet hook... seriously if your going to make a kit, you should provide everything we need or at least warn us on the case that we'll have to buy more crochet hooks. I didn't really mind that much because I already owned those crochet hooks, it's just that if someone didn't know how to check the sizes of the hooks, or that different hooks were different sizes, it'd confuse them and that is why I gave this kit 4 stars.",1314662400,2,782,4.185430463576159
200888,1,1601400748,"Got DVD from library & I'm so glad I didn't pay a penny for it. This DVD is the hardest DVD to navigate I've ever seen! Once you're in a section you can't replay it or see where to go to the next step if you've mastered the one you've just seen EXCEPT to go all the way back 'Home' which takes you out of the DVD completely so you have to remember what you just saw and hope you can chose the right area to go back if you want to watch it again or go on to the next part in the series.

She DOES NOT tell you what kind of yarn to start with (very important because some yarns are much more forgiving! Had to look that up online for free - again would've been wasted $ if I'd bought DVD!)

She DOES NOT explain what size hooks to buy (Approximately 16 different size hooks to choose from at the store. Got the info for free online as well and again the info should've been in a beginners crochet DVD.)

When I went to the demo part of the DVD it jumped right in to crocheting like you should already know how to do it! Shouldn't she show you how to put the yarn on the hook, hold it or SOMETHING???

Melissa crochets 90 miles an hour and there's no way a beginner can keep up with this, know which section of the DVD they're in, how all of the stitches go together.... it's a mess. If I would've bought this DVD I would've felt bad giving it away to charity it was so bad! I took the DVD back to the library the next day.

(Just for the record I can pick up on things when taught correctly: Irish Ceili dancing, decorative painting & historic restoration & piano to name a few. This is not a case of someone without aptitude wanting to do something they cannot!)

If you want a great DVD take up knitting and get Nicci McNally's The Complete Beginner's Guide to Knitting. I did buy that DVD online and it was well worth the cost!",1312675200,9,1828,4.022038567493113

200892,5,1601400748,"I am most grateful for this DVD.  I help others learn to crochet and as I am right handed I have problems helping people who are left handed to learn.  I have some very good instructions in one of my books, but this DVD will overcome the difficulties I have encountered.  It is just excellent for everyone learning to crochet and also as a refresher for people who have been crocheting for a while.

My praises are 'over the top', for this DVD and for the instructor who is clear in every way, taking nothing for granted and demonstrating so well.

I have not even finished viewing the DVD, which I have from the library, and I have ordered my own copy.  I cannot do without this DVD, and this will help me in my work tremendously.

I would like to see a man demonstrating crochet.  This is not in the slightest meant as a criticism but just to expand the potential.  Sometimes crochet is taken to be 'women's work', and as I help men to learn also, I would like to have the modelling of a man demonstrating crochet clearly, in the same format as this DVD.

My thanks to all concerned for producing this DVD, especially Melissa Leapman, an excellent tracher.",1294185600,2,1158,4.394366197183099
200893,5,1601400748,"For some unknown reason, I'm very dedicated to the idea of learning how to crochet.  I know very few people who crochet (and I don't feel comfortable to ask them for help) so I purchased this dvd along with the book.  I find these two tools enormously helpful.  I'm already comfortable with the foundation chain and the single crochet stitch.  The 'secret' language of crochet is a little challenging, but fun.  The dvd lets you move along at your pace and of course the book, with photos instead of illustrations, lends further clarification.  Maybe Melissa can begin a macrame series.  Knots and loops are clearly on my mind.  Thanks for such great products!",1289433600,,660,4.778761061946903

200895,4,1601400748,"This DVD is exactly what it says and nothing more. I was recommended, by Leisure Arts customer relations staff, to try it when I wrote to enquire about broomstick lace and the boucle  or loopy stitch. It does very well by the advanced stitches but doesn't even approach the expert stitches. Since I knew how to do the stitches demonstrated on it I wasn't much help, but If you are trying to learn how to make bobbles or popcorn or any other bumpy stitch, it will be well worth the money. It demonstrates the stitches in such a way that you can go at your own speed. When you are done with the programs you will have a ""sampler"" afghan. There are other suggested products you can make on the disc as well. There is a pamphlet of printed pattens included with the disc.",1283212800,10,767,4.326388888888889

I've already made the barrel bag and fingerless gloves from the DVD and have actually been able to follow one of my book patterns for making slippers.  My confidence is up 100% and I've crocheted so much now that my hands hurt. I would highly recommend this DVD to someone who wants to learn or expand their crocheting skills.

I bought this dvd so I could learn a few more stitches and finally complete a granny square. I did one the first try. Very detailed instructions. The only problem is that you have to practice first with how to hold the hook and maintain your gauge. The dvd alone is not going to get you to crochet perfectly on your first shot if you rush through it. Be sure to make plenty of practice swatches first. Once you get past finding your comfort zone with holding the hook and yarn everything else will come naturally.,1256947200,4,604,4.307017543859649
200901,3,1601400748,This is worth the money to buy.  This video has a pleasant host that is likeable and the video is well shot so you can see all the details and follow along.,1246665600,5,156,3.875
200902,4,1601400748,"It is great for beginners, great close ups. I learned new stitches quickly. I would recommend this to everyone.",1241740800,3,111,4.894736842105263
200903,5,1601400748,"After multiple books and web sites to self teach, this is the best resource I have found.  Shown from crocheter's view, easy to stop, rewind and watch over again, good close ups and clear instruction invaluable to someone trying to learn a new craft.",1239926400,,250,4.681818181818182
200904,5,1601400748,I rented this dvd at my local library. I have been crochetting for a couple of years now but still only know just a few basic stiches. I usually watch videos on youtube but I came across this dvd at my local library and decided to give it a try. I watched it and the dvd is very up-to-date and easy to understand. If I were a first-time crochetter I would find it pretty easy to pick up and definitely find it more simple than trying to learn to crochet from a book. Excellent book. I plan on buying one for myself for reference.,1238803200,2,529,4.096153846153846
200905,1,1601400748,If I had known that this DVD was all I was going to get I would have purchased a used one.  This DVD was supposed to have 4 different colors of yarn and instructions to crochet a project.  That was one of the MAIN reasons I bought it new form Amazon.  But all that came in the mail was the DVD.  It is hard to crochet a project if you don't have the supplies to do it with. Very Disappointed Indeed!!,1238112000,10,400,3.9012345679012346
200906,5,1601400748,"I had only a book to learn from and my starting chains were a mess. This video made it very clear what I was doing wrong, how to fix it, and how to balance my stitch out so that it looked like crochet, not making knots in yarn.

The video's are extremely detailed and take you through the process step by step for each of the 5 stitches that it teaches in the video. Once you get these down, learning a new stitch is very easy.

The only negative I would say is that for a DVD, I would have liked for them to have spent a little more time taking me through the patterns that come with the book. To help you read them, and understand them, and basically bring together the lessons on stitching, with the nomenclature used for writing patterns, with the act of actually putting that into stitches. But I guess that is left as a ""user exercise"".

All in all, Excellent DVD. Worth every penny",1236297600,2,888,4.211764705882353
200907,5,1601400748,"I am brand new to crochet & have a friend who is helping me with a simple afghan pattern. I watched this dvd all the way through & found the close-up shots to be great! I'm also using it for reference while I'm learning. I wish I had bought this dvd sooner! This is a great supplement to the ""beginner"" pattern books I had already purchased but couldn't understand before I watched this. Wonderful!",1235952000,,398,4.391891891891892
200908,5,1601400748,"I Can't Believe I'm Crocheting is an excellent instructional video for any skill level.  The video covers everything from how to hold the hook to four small projects.  This dvd is nicely organized into chapters and sub-chapters containing lessons, projects, necessities and an excellent a-z index of terms.  The dvd navigation is done through the dvd main menu as all dvds are - if you need to go back to the top level screen, you click main menu on your remote.  The one feature that might have been nice would be a bookmarking feature but the main menu and chapters are logical enough so this is not at all an issue.  In dvd format, it's easy to pause, rewind, and resume when necessary.  Additionally, if you only need to practice one task (ex. treble stitch), you can choose to see only that task either from the lessons section or from the a-z index.

I would like to comment a little more on the projects because without seeing the dvd, it is difficult to conceive of how this would work.  Except for the two row washcloth, each of the projects (belt, purse, scarf) has its own sub-chapter under the projects section. You are given the choice to see the pattern and supplies or to work the project step by step.  The instructions for each step are presented first in a callout box on the right side of the screen, you then press play to see that section demonstrated while the callout box remains on the screen.  After the demonstration, you're given time to complete the section with the instructional box still visible on the screen.  You press play when you are ready to move to the next section.  This truly becomes a stitch-a-long for the viewer.  This is a very good setup for the beginner and is probably more akin to learning one-on-one than to learning in a classroom setting where the instructor would need to keep going for the faster students.  I found this an excellent learning experience and one that demonstrates some consideration about the instructional presentation.

Several reviewers have commented negatively on the presenter's personality and style.  This is a personal preference.  This is not an entertainment video nor a  motivational video.  Instead, this is an instructional video.  Her professional presentation of the material is what I would expect from a good teacher.  Her voice is clear.  She stays on task and does not add in color commentary that is irrelevant to the tasks she demonstrates.  This allows the viewer to focus in on the crocheting and nothing else.  If your preference is to focus on the craft, then this video will suit you well.  I give the video 5 stars for its ease of use, professional presentation and the clarity of instruction.",1235606400,3,2692,4.73763440860215
200909,4,1601400748,"I made up my mind that before I die I want to learn to crochet.  This DVD, ""I Can't Believe I'm Crocheting"" is so easy to follow.  I can pause and go back time and time again if I didn't ""get"" what was being demonstrated.  I recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to learn to crochet.",1233532800,2,284,3.9473684210526314
200910,4,1601400748,"I have had several people attmept to teach me the art and in addition have purchased many books, but when you are learning it is hard to understand what you are being told because all the terms and motions are abstract concepts.  With the dvd it was easy see what was you are being asked to do and if it isn't clear, you just rewind and repeat the segment until you do. I especially liked that the dvd is broken down into several lessons/segments that return to the a menu after the completion of the segment. You can return to to the specific section where you last left off with no problem. My only advice to the viewer is to have the remote firmly by your side when you are watching because though the instructor is clear and fairly even paced, it can be a bit tricky to follow say step one of the lesson before you move to step two. I found it easier to watch each step one time, then rewind and try to do the step along with the instructor. If I found that it was particully difficult, I would push pause so that I wouldn't miss the next part of the instruction while I was finishing the previous task. Overall I am very pleased with this product and found it to be a great value. I can now crochet.",1233273600,2,1204,4.167381974248927
200911,3,1601400748,"The instruction is thorough, but the instructor goes too fast.  The camera work is not great; it's almost as though the camera is too close to the instructors hands, and sometimes her hands were not completely in the frame to watch how to do the stitches.

I agree with the person who said this DVD is not easy to navigate.

I gave this DVD 3 stars because I was still able to learn crochet, however, I think it could have been much, much better.",1233100800,8,446,4.285714285714286
200912,5,1601400748,"I have watch countless You Tube and Expert Village video's and after the initial chain stitch I was still lost. I purchased this DVD but was very sceptical that it would teach me. I thought I just had too left hands. It is amazing, I am learning to crochet. I am still practicing just on a single stitch but I am doing it! My goal is to make the beaitiful belt in the video and to make some dishcloths to drive my DH crazy (he hates the hand crochet ones that my friend made me). If I could give this DVD 10 stars I would. I also love the left handed screen on the side. When I have mastered the stitches I plan to teach my 11 year old DD with this DVD. She is a lefty and I am sure this DVD will be very helpful to her too.",1231200000,,724,3.8333333333333335
200913,5,1601400748,As a beginner this is a wonderful DVD.  She shows you very important steps of how to crochet correctly and closeups really help.  I still refer to it when I forget some stiches.  Great DVD.,1230249600,,189,4.3428571428571425
200914,5,1601400748,"I love this dvd! It's clearly presented so anyone can understand the instructions. The video shots large enough to see detail and with the instructions for both righ handed and left handed crocheters, you can't go wrong. Anyone can learn to crochet from this dvd. I would highly recomend it.",1225929600,3,291,4.84
200915,3,1601400748,"The classes are good, but the DVD format is bad.

Once you are in a section, you cannot go to another. For instance, while doing a project, I could not go through a menu to a lesson to refresh my memory. I was very disappointed, because in order to see the main menu I had to remove the CD and  start from the beginning to see all the chapters.

I bought the ""The Complete Beginner's Guide to Knitting,"" by Nici McNally, at the same time as I bought ""I Can't Believe I'm Crocheting,"" and the difference between the two DVDs is like night and day. Navigating in the knitting video is a breeze, while navigating in the crocheting video is very time-consuming.

The crocheting presenter, Melissa Leapman, doesn't look too happy about what she is doing. She is probably mad because someone made her wear those ill-fitting crochet sweaters. A smile once in a while never hurts!",1210896000,52,872,4.535031847133758

One day while at JoAnn Fabrics I ran across this dvd so I bought it.  I went home popped it in and within a few hours I was crocheting my first project.  To me it's G-R-E-A-T for beginners.  It's easy to understand and I absolutely love the A-Z index.  This dvd is a must have for all crocheters.",1208908800,7,550,4.259615384615385

My girls were able to get the instruction they needed and I was able to help them with the hands on part of croceting. They are all working on projects (ages 7, 9 and 14). This is something we will share all our lives. It is a great crochet dvd for beginners. Having the ability to pause, replay or skip any lesson when needed is wonderful.

200918,3,1601400748,"I've never crocheted before in my life and thought a DVD would be the best way to learn.  The presenter, in some cases, makes things much more complicated than they need to be (ie, her slipknot technique was very bizarre).  I tried several times to learn from the DVD, but no luck.  I finally had a friend teach me in person, and I had it in no time flat.  Once I knew how to crochet and had put in quite a bit of practice, it was good to go back and watch the DVD and pick up some more tips and techniques.

The presenter would also, in some cases, crochet extremely quickly and her hands were just a blur.  That doesn't do me any good.  At other times I was distracted by her bad fake nails and her weird choice of jewellery.

The granny square purse project had very clear instructions and she gave a good explanation of the granny square concept as well as good visual demonstrations of where all the stitches go (though again, she would ""speed crochet"" at times which was annoying).",1207526400,13,987,4.297297297297297

I am a visual learner and reading the steps in paragraphs and fiddling with yarn and a hook is difficult for me.  The instructor went over stitches several times and I caught on. It was great to pause and rewind until I understood. I was crocheting that day and the DVD teaches you how to read crochet instructions. Now I understand the ""code"".",1206835200,2,410,4.394736842105263
200920,5,1601400748,"When I bought this dvd, I was hoping that it would help me with my crocheting skills (okay, I have very minimal crocheting skills). I couldn't really figure out the abbreviations in the easy crochet books. If you're like me, I'm more of a visual learner.

This DVD is great. It demonstrated how to go over the different basic stitches, such as, single crochet, slip stitch, half double crochet, and treble crochet. It also shows you how to yarn over and how to hold the hook properly with the right tension.

What's really important is that the camera zooms into the actual stitches, so you can see HOW it's supposed to be crocheted. I had looked at most of the You-Tube videos on-line, and they are not as detailed as this video, but I suppose that's to be expected. I also had another crocheting dvd, but it wasn't as good and thorough and detailed as this dvd.

Another good feature is how they step you through the projects that they have on the dvd. (Their projects on the dvd are a spa cloth, open work scarf, granny squares mini-purse, and a belt.) After showing you the stitches, it pauses to allow you to keep up with Melissa. Then you can start the dvd again for the next segment or phase of the project. Also, it shows you the instructions of the project after each segment. (This has helped me decipher crochet patterns.) I was able to do granny squares with one of the projects (granny square mini-purse), but of course, I had to redo it a couple of times because I needed to figure it out--challenged that way. However, it didn't take me long to complete it.

In any case, I highly recommend buying this dvd if you are a beginner. I think intermediate crocheters would probably find this too basic. I am going to order the Crochet Stitches in Motion dvd, and I have bought the kitting version of the series. I can't wait to watch them! :)",1202515200,7,1852,4.454277286135693

Melissa is very professional, but is devoid of personality.  She is robotic, but informative and clear.  She does not smile.  You cannot tell if she likes or hates to crochet.

All of the information is presented in a way that is easy to grasp the concepts.  The video and sound are fine.  The lighting is flat. The close-ups of Melissa's hands and yarn are clear and easy to see. Instructions are detailed and comprehensive.",1180828800,23,704,4.604838709677419
