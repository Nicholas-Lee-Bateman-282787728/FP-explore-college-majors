8229025,5,B000XPXSA6,Interesting how the anxiety of relationships played out in a short amount of time. What happens in life compacted down to a few short minutes. Sorry - yelling at the screen for Tate to turn-and-talk doesn't work...so I gave up. Don't discount this little number...it engages your schemas.,1387324800,,288,5.020833333333333
8229026,5,B000XPXSA6,"Okay, so I haven't actually seen this.  But I got to play the lead role of the young man (""Man,"" as I recall) on stage at the Blind Parrot Theatre in Chicago in 1988, back before Krakower's play was published.  It was called just ""Open All Night"" back then, and it served as a quite popular late-night show following the main production on weekends.  Very funny, a real crowdpleaser.  I have absolutely no doubt it would make a terrific & entertaining short film.  In fact, I may actually have to get this, come to think of it!",1306540800,,527,4.391752577319588
8229027,5,B000XPXSA6,"""4 A.M.: Open All Night"" is a character-driven short film set entirely in a diner in, as the title suggests, the very early hours of the morning. A man is at the diner looking for a burger and a bit of sympathy from the server. Soon, a woman arrives, and the man can barely take his eyes off her. Yet neither one speaks to the other, despite the counterman's efforts to get them at least to say hello to each other.

That's pretty much it for the plot. But the film's plot is secondary to the dialog and performances, all of which are top notch. Bob Krakower, who wrote the script, has a great ear for dialog, and the actors' delivery of his words is superb. My experience with independent films is that there always seems to be at least one weak link, but I could find none here. Each of the four cast members (Tate Donovan, Wendy Makkena, Rod McLachlan, and Kevin Geer--the fourth person is the diner's third patron) is superb, and the direction is sure.

""4 A.M.: Open All Night"" is essentially a one-act play in its construction, similar to the longer and also superb&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Happened-Was/dp/6303961703/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Happened Was...</a>&nbsp;Watching this one, I kept thinking of Edward Hopper's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-Hawks/dp/B000G6SIUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night Hawks</a>, in part because there is a quick shot of the famous painting at the beginning of the film and in larger part because I wondered whether Hopper's work, which seems to capture the loneliness of the early morning hours, was the inspiration for this script. Either way, this film truly is a little gem.",1198195200,,1733,5.438661710037175
