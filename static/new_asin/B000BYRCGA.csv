2447884,1,B000BYRCGA,The only way to stop the companies that produce split sets is to NOT BUY THEM.  This is a nice series and should be selling in the $ 35.00 range for the WHOLE SEASON.,1135296000,12,166,3.8823529411764706
2447885,5,B000BYRCGA,"TBAA was my FAVORITE show when it was on the air.  It's so sad that it ended, but it left us with such a wonderful message at the end of every episode.  I don't think there was a single episode in which I didn't cry (especially the 100th).

The fact that season three is being released in two volumes doesn't bother me very much because I will most definitely buy both...I do of course wish it would come out in one volume, but they do what they have to do.",1134172800,9,457,4.055555555555555
2447886,4,B000BYRCGA,"Yes, I have the right to voice my opinion on this season coming out in more than one volume. As a consumer, this is frustrating because I don't want to have to wait months at a time for a new volume to come out.

This does not mean I do not like this series.

It was my FAVORITE and I WILL buy it regardless of it having volumes.",1133827200,5,329,3.823529411764706
2447887,5,B000BYRCGA,"Can't wait for the third season to be released.  And yes, in two volumes.  But I for one don't care.  It could be released one disc at a time and I'd still line up to buy it, or preorder it through Amazon.  At least we are getting the seasons slowly but still getting them.  Please, let's NOT complain.  I'm just a happy consumer glad to be able to buy this series on DVD.  One volume, two volumes or three or single disc, WHO CARES!?  Then just don't buy it and buy something else.

Later and thanks for your time.  5 stars to me even before seeing it or having it in my hands.  Monica is the best!",1133740800,7,599,4.034188034188034
2447888,4,B000BYRCGA,"Touched by an Angel was one of the BEST series on television. I am a devoted fan who has been waiting and waiting for the dvds to come out so I could see those episodes that I had missed in the original airings.

The one thing I don't like already about this release is that it is in volumes. I want to buy FULL seasons. I don't want to waste 30$ buying half of a season and have to wait another year to buy the other half.

Getting out these seasons are taking FOREVER.

I'm still going to buy them because I love TBAA but they need to put more features on the dvd and get them out quicker.

I just don't understand why shows that are currently in their SECOND season (like Laguna Beach) have the dvd out for their first season and TBAA, whose show aired for 9 years, is lagging behind.

Anyway, this show will continue being one of the greatest on my list...right next to The X-Files. :)",1131580800,8,889,4.145348837209302

2447899,4,B000BYRCGA,"I bought this series because I was an extra in several of the episodes.  I saw myself several times, but there were no credits, so I never got to see my name.  I worked on the set several times and I just have to say that Della Reese was the rudest person I have ever met.  I was talking to her one day on the set and she asked me what I thought of the show.  I was honest by saying that I have never watched it because I was a single mom working two jobs and going to college.  She flat out said, ""Get out of my face!""  And shooed me away!",1455408000,,540,3.734513274336283

2447946,5,B000BYRCGA,"It is not a dreary poorly produced moral program. It is top of the game entertainment. It features well known stars in compelling roles.
It tackels subjects, I am sure many of us would rather avoid discussing. It is life layed out on the screen, written extremely well.

If you have children, then consider offering this as an opportunity to get together and watch. The program deals with cyber dangers and what happens to children lured into this world. Sure, it is a television show, but how many of the programs that are shown would you feel comfortable with allowing your kids to watch alone.",1394582400,,596,4.6761904761904765
2447947,5,B000BYRCGA,"In short, most actors were very, very good. A few, exceptional, but here is why I rate it high.

It is the first series about Angels that doesn't denigrate God, and gets Christian theology about God and Man and Angels correct.

This is because the producer: Martha Williamson is a Christian and fears God.",1391299200,,305,4.62962962962963

2447968,2,B000BYRCGA,of this series so far. The story lines just aren't as deep as could be. Personal views keep me from agreeing with the shows attitude so I couldn't like it these dvds.

2447969,4,B000BYRCGA,"Love the series. Outstanding TV for the whole family. The problem is the way it is released. I like to buy a whole series, at once in one collection.

2447971,5,B000BYRCGA,"Few shows stay in our minds so may years after they have been gone. For me Touched by an Angel was one of the best shows to express warmth to its viewers. Every episode has an uplifting message, and the series is so full and rich I can't wait till the rest of the seasons are released. This third season is quite long indeed, and it introduces to the spin off of The Promised Land. Personally, I could never get really attracted to this other series. Nonetheless all the episodes have the quality the entire show always demonstrated. Roma Downey is and will always be a beautiful and very talented actress. Her role as the angel Monica captivated many of us, and Della Reese was as charming as only she can be. Quite a little treasure, this series is.",1154649600,5,751,4.410071942446043
2447972,3,B000BYRCGA,"I am rating this volume a 3 star, not because of content which is definitely way above a 5 star, but the quality of the picture is not good.  Quite a few of the episodes have a grainy quality and the others are just not quite crystal clear.  BUT if you are an ""Angel"" fan, it's worth it just to watch these stories again.  This season also gave birth to the spinoff ""Promised Land.""  MY BIG QUESTION IS ""WHERE IS THE SECOND HALF OF THIS SEASON???"" I understand why they split this season into two volumes, but at least have the courtesy of releasing the second half!!!  Grainy pictures or not, I was planning to purchase all 9 seasons.

Monica (Roma Downey) is an angel sent by God to help people in their times of need.  Tess, played by Della Reese, is Monica's supervisor and brings life and laughter to the show.  Each episode brings home the fact that God exists and loves you.  Sometimes I cried, sometimes I laughed, and sometimes I did both.  Touched By An Angel is a wonderful television show for the whole family.  I believe it also teaches right from wrong and to have morals.",1154390400,4,1086,4.38

2447993,5,B000BYRCGA,"This third season of ""Touched By An Angel"" is very good. They don't make shows like this anymore. And so far, there aren't anymore reruns of this show. Therefore, I recommend that all fans of this show should buy this set, along with Seasons 1 and 2. The only downfall about this set is that it's released in two volumes. But it's not a big issue because this set is much cheaper than the first two season. Now, as far as the picture quality is, it's ok. It's not the best transfer. The main problem with the picture is that it has a muddy look and there is some bleeding. Overall, it's not a bad transfer, but it could've been better. As far as the sound quality is, it is very good. In my opinion, this is the best a Dolby Digital 2.0 sound can get. The theme song has great bass and dialogue is always very clear.

This is indeed a series with ""heart"".  The 16 episodes in this collection will more than attest to that fact!  All I can say is can't wait for part two!!",1140048000,5,293,4.596153846153846
2447995,5,B000BYRCGA,"Just saw the first show on this volume. My heart was so moved by the Doctor who gave up her family to pursue getting ahead of others just for some financial gain. Doesn't matter whether we are millionaires or living on little as the heroins in this story were, I truly believe so many of us would be wonderfully blessed to see such a powerful moving story.

After watching the generosity of so many strangers on a bus, I could not help but cry. Was so powerfully moved by only the first show. Told my wife this was worth $30,000.00.

Can not wait till our family gets to watch ALL 16 shows on this dvd. I have not ever seen any other show like this one. Thank you very much to the makers of this movie for an amazingly unique show!!!!!",1139961600,9,735,4.205673758865248
2447996,5,B000BYRCGA,"The inspiration alone is worth the cost.  Sure the sets are being split in two but if one really loves the series (as many of us do) we'll buy it no matter how it is put out.  My only complaint is having to wait so long.  Why do they have new product of ""Will and Grace"", ""West Wing"" or ""Sex and the City"" out nearly every month and we have to wait almost a year for TBAA!!  As far as I'm concerned TBAA is superior to any of those other programs.  Buy this series!!  You will be blessed all over again as we were for the nine wonderful years this series was on the air!!  Bravo!!",1139875200,3,580,3.9482758620689653
2447997,5,B000BYRCGA,"Complete season sets of Andy Griffith contain 32 episodes, each fitting into a half-hour time slot. They sell for roughly $30. TBAA season 3, set 1 contains 16 episodes, each for a one-hour time slot. It also sells for roughly $30. I don't see any disparity there and will not be complaining to anyone. I am most happy to have this program available to buy and am glad that it is being marketed at a very competitive price. I, like many others, would be willing to pay more if it were necessary, simply because this is such a great series. True fans will buy all of the seasons...if they are released...any way they are released...for any reasonable price. The digital conversion that was done on the first two seasons was excellent. Picture quality is great, and if you've never heard the opening theme song through a good surround-sound system with LOTS of bass you're in for a real treat! What a theme song ... and what a voice! Della...""you done good""!!! Well, this is one satisfied customer: with the first two seasons in-hand and the first part of season 3 on the way I am supremely happy that the series is still alive and available to those of us who love it. I hope the entire series is released. I will do my part by buying all of them that are. Hopefully there are enough of us to make it profitable and feasible.",1139788800,19,1324,4.4526748971193415

2447999,5,B000BYRCGA,"Season three is one of the strongest of TBAA!  I can't wait until part two comes out and I hope it comes out soon!!!!  Meanwhile, part one of season three contains some of the most powerful episodes of the series, most notably :  1)  The Violin Lesson.......on my top ten list of my all time favorite TBAA episodes...definitely a 5 hankie episode.....I haven't seen it in years!!!  And also ""Homecoming"" which is a two part episode that concludes with TBAA's spinoff ""Promised Land"", another 5 hanky episode!!  My goodness this series was beyond exceptional!!  It transcends everything that has ever been on television!!  Five stars and more!!!!!!  Hurry up Part Two!!!!",1139443200,,670,4.963963963963964
2448000,4,B000BYRCGA,"I just watched the first few minutes of the first DVD and so far so good.  The picture is excellent as well as the sound.  Two DVD cases, four DVDs all together.  Smaller package that I thought it would be.  The cases are the thin versions, not too sturdy, but it will work.  Nice pictures on the front of the DVDs as well.  I am a dedicated fan, and as long as you shop around for the best price... I will keep getting them.  It is worth it.  Touched by an Angel is an excellent series.  I have Season 1,2, and now 3 vol 1 (it was a big season!)",1139356800,,546,3.890909090909091

Since there are a lot of episodes in this season, the price might be too high for some people to be able to afford it, otherwise. I, for one, have a limited amount of money to spend like this and I would be so disappointed if I weren't able to purchase this latest season.

This is the best!",1139270400,,309,4.5
2448013,5,B000BYRCGA,"That's the release date!!  I agree with the other reviews that it is a pain to have the season split up, but they did this also with ""Lost in Space"" Seasons two and three.  However, we didn't have to wait what seems to be an eternity for those releases.  I only hope they don't make us wait another year for part two of Season Three!!  I love TBAA and the DVD releases are just like watching the series again for the first time.  Its wonderful to share this program with a new generation who have never been ""touched""!!",1138665600,3,519,4.255102040816326

2448017,5,B000BYRCGA,"I know it is a pain but I doubt any of you even know why Season 3 is being split in two. The reason is because Season 3 has an abnormally large number of shows in it, mainly because it has numerous Promise Land crossovers, and the rights to Promise Land have to be bought as well. They aren't doing this just to be mean. They didn't do this for season 1 or 2 and I doubt this will happen to any other season either. So please calm down, everyone.",1136505600,68,446,3.966666666666667

Paramount Home Video is releasing the show into two volumes.  No thanks!  You are taking advantage of the fans and I am cancelling my order today.  I advise everyone to do the same to get the message to the suites that made this decision. What a way to ruin an image of the best show on TV.

2448020,1,B000BYRCGA,"This was one of the finest television series ever produced.  But Paramount Home Video is showing its contempt for the fans by releasing the third season of TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL in two volumes, thereby ""maximizing profits"" and squeezing more money out of its fans.  If this outrage works, Season #4 will be in three volumes and ultimately one episode at a time.  You can be certain if this shameless gimmick works other video companies will follow suit.  This is the same company that releases never-ending ""new"" editions of the STAR TREK movies and series at the top end of the price scale.  Few other studios would have the nerve to release a TV series at a list price of $139.98.  They're also releasing the GUNSMOKE series in two volumes.  Fans should show their displeasure for this bad new idea by boycotting this blatant pandering to greed.",1135555200,13,845,4.707482993197279
2448021,1,B000BYRCGA,"I understand the frustration about the split-packaging of this DVD series. In fact, I support the criticism to the studio for this type of marketing. First off, there's only one reason at which they have chosen this style of ""money making"" and that I'm sure is not one that makes anyone happy but themselves. Second, this is by far one of the most popular and respected shows to have aired in television history and this marketing only brings a tainted dipiction of the series to some of the most beloved fans.

Not everyone loves this show, no. But, not everyone who does can afford this split-packaging idea either. There's no need for it and they're going to get more money for it anyway. It's also odd in the fact that the show designates the need to love and understand one another while the studio releasing of this series is doing just the opposite. I can't help but be reminded of Jesus turning over the tables of the robbers when they were making a profit off of religous sacraments that were unneccessary and offensive to some people. Some may argue that this is the same, some may say it's not as bad as the original situation. I shall let the consumer decide for themselves.

Nevertheless, I still love the show, but I may end up passing on buying more of the seasons until the studio realizes their mistake and how they are frustrating many consumers who love this beloved show. This is the same studio that made the mistake in 2002 and 2003 to release the first season of I Love Lucy in 9 volumes spanning over a year long release. I'm sure eventually they will once again realize this mistake and re-release season three of Angel, like they did of the first I Love Lucy season in 2005, when they come back to reality.
