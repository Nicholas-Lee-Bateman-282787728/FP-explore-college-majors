7786290,5,B01HE9S3J4,"This is a fascinating look at LA Times food writer Jonathan Gold and his culinary domain - the mosaic of neighborhoods in a far more vibrant and interesting Los Angeles than a casual tourist could ever see. That LA is his hometown, and that he loves it dearly, adds some real depth to this excellent work. I've watched it twice in a single week - highly unusual for me when it comes to documentaries.",1477008000,,400,4.418918918918919
7786291,3,B01HE9S3J4,"City of Gold
 Some might find it pretentious to call LA the City of Gold after the subject of this very interesting and smart documentary about food critic Johnathan Gold, but not me.  Gold achieved the remarkable status of receiving the Pulitzer Prize as a food writer, a first in literary history.  He really does have the touch for phrase making and insight into his subject.  And he writes just as much about the multifaceted culture of Los Angeles as he does the food.  LA has been called the capital of the third world and Gold's explorations give that claim credit.  Of course food occupies the center of his writing but he has plenty to say about the various communities that generate the tasty bits too.
 He seems to like ethnic food.  At least in the film, unobtrusively written and directed by award winning documentist Laura Gabbert, he did not review a single conventional restaurant.  He dipped in the Black community only to feature as single restaurant, a hot dog stand that he favored.  The rest of the eateries he showcased came from the wide Asian community or Latin America with a single offering from Africa.  The food looked good enough to eat.
 Gold likes food in all of its forms and his enthusiasm comes clearly across.  Ditto his enthusiasm for his home turf, the vast, colorful and sun spangled City of Angles.  He tells the story of the people cooking the delights.  A woman from Ethiopia, now here in the states for decades, has a very successful restaurant featuring food of her homeland.  Her son has now been a Doctor for twenty years.  He points out the restaurants make the classic entry level capitalist entrepreneurial opportunity in our great land, an opportunity taken up with vigor by immigrants from all over.
  Gold himself in his private life has done what he lauds in the ethnic, multi-national hodge podge that makes up the genetic soup of modern LA.  Jewish himself his life love and wife, a fellow writer, is Latina.  His kids, who feature briefly, are nicely blended.  He mentions the ethnic and cultural mosaic in LA and then shows us how fast it in eroding.  In one bit he shows a Korean chef working wonders from a food truck....but his two workers are young white guys learning how to make great meals.
  I like Gold for his skill as a writer but also for his humility.  He said 'If I eat 20 Burmese dinners, I know I am not an expert of Burma.'  Not many of us would say that.",1476662400,3,2428,4.573085846867749
7786292,5,B01HE9S3J4,Loved this documentary. Bought this as a gift for my married daughter who lives in L.A.,1476144000,,87,4.5
7786293,5,B01HE9S3J4,About so much more than food.  It's about the community around food.  About how writing can affect people and build community.  Entertaining too.,1475452800,4,145,5.217391304347826
7786294,1,B01HE9S3J4,"I thought this would be a good video about restaurants, but it is really just about Jonathan Gold, and I didn't enjoy the video at all.  He comes across as very snobby and elitist, and is just kind of full of himself.  Really disappointing video.",1475366400,3,246,4.444444444444445
8765219,5,B01HE9S3J4,"I live lived in Los Angeles for almost 40 years, moving here from Michigan.  Although my dining habits are so much simpler than the late Mr. Gold's were, I loved every minute of this film.  Because he went to so many different parts of Los Angeles (including some ""bad"" neighborhoods) and because such a wide swath of ethnic and cultural traditions are seen, I came to realize that if I had to suggest just one film to show what Los Angeles is like today, this would be it.",1533427200,,473,4.363636363636363
8765220,5,B01HE9S3J4,"Saw it on Hulu the other night. Don't live in LA...have spent very little time there. Not a restaurant aficionado. There is absolutely zero reason for me to like this film. But didn't find anything else interesting in the movies Hulu selected for me, so I decided to watch it for a little bit just to see how boring it would turn out to be. And I loved it.

Some of the other reviewers claimed that Gold comes across as a snob. What? Imagine a very literate, humble everyman as a food critic...that's Jonathan. Yeah, he does know what he's talking about, and it's not just food. You don't win a Pulitzer for writing about food alone. He is apparently very good at explaining how new immigrants adapt their home culture food to the USA, and how their restaurants connect the local community. I highly recommend giving this film a look.",1527811200,,834,4.52317880794702
8765221,5,B01HE9S3J4,Great portrait of a city and one of the food critics that made it into gold. Not so much a food pic like Bourdane or Emerel but more about how much power a food critic can have and in this case a benevolent critic. Makes me want to go back to LA with a different attitude and agenda.,1495497600,,283,3.896551724137931
8765222,4,B01HE9S3J4,"It's interesting to watch Gold behind the wheel of his Dodge on his way to one restaurant or another as I prepare for my first visit to LA. Gold is an interesting character and I can see why someone would want to make him the subject of a film. It probably took some convincing because he seems a private person who is not comfortable in front of the camera. I agree with a reviewer over at imdb (M. Miller) that this film is a hodgepodge of awkwardly staged scenes. It's as if the director said, can we have an editorial meeting with Jonathan in which the editors (pretend) to give him guidance on his next article? Can we sit Jonathan and Calvin Trillin together for a meal and hope they say something clever? The camera does not seem a fly on the wall. And the film only skimmed the surface of what I expected it to be about, eating in LA. I give it four stars because in spite of its flaws it held my attention and has inspired me to order his book Counter Intelligence.",1494633600,,974,4.241935483870968
8765223,5,B01HE9S3J4,"Jonathan Gold, prize winning restaurant critic from the LA Times, specializes in discovering lesser known ethnic eateries throughout this sprawling city. Following him as he follows his nose and appetite is both fascinating and appetizing. It was nostalgic for these former Los Angelenos and definitely should make you wonder who will enliven our palates and preserve our health if all the immigrant medical staffers and small restaurant owners and cooks were to be closed out of our society. Gold's writing won him a Pulitzer but his big heart and appreciation of this country's delicious multiculturalism inform every word and remind us that closed minds and closed doors will impoverish us all and take the flavor out of life.",1487116800,,729,5.186440677966102

8765226,1,B01HE9S3J4,"Avoid this doc and the arrogant horse's posterior that is its subject. Gold is a pompous, overrated L.A. windbag -- the worst kind because they're such hicks under the wrinkled, leathery skin -- and he's long spewed his third-rate jotting on a variety of subjects. Prior to his cretinous, exhibitionist reviews of strip-mall food, he drooled over the city's insipid rock scene -- missing the fact that garbage like Black Flag helped ruin punk (not that L.A. ever produced anything of value in that department aside from X and one or two others). Here, this bloated egoist is seen celebrating himself endlessly, while his aging ""friends"" and editors try desperately to seem ""with-it"" and somehow ""edgy"" by playing along. The result is a stomach-turning vanity project that would embarrass anyone with even a hint of sophistication.",1480291200,,830,5.110294117647059

8765228,5,B01HE9S3J4,I happen to know JG. A person filled with the quirks every genius demands. Great film about LA while using a big 'ol Dodge pickup and food as the literal and figurative delivery method.,1479168000,,185,4.470588235294118
