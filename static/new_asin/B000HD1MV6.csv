2634530,1,B000HD1MV6,"First that all, the trader was great. Very fast deliver, I much appreciate that. But the dvd is... boring! It shows 2 dances that are the most stronger, passionate, vibrating dances in flamenco, with no passion at all!! Very very basic!!! the farruca is mean to be a hard footwork dance.. there is no hard footwork at all! I guess it's ok if you are thinking of learn ""some"" flamenco just to play around, not to get good at it. Besides the dancer has no grace to dance at all.. very dissapointed. It probably would be ok if was rumba or even sevillanas, but not tango and farruca, wich are such hard and complex dances. I don't recommended, was a waste of money.",1295740800,5,662,4.390243902439025
2634531,1,B000HD1MV6,"I've been dancing for nearly 20 years. I've taken mostly ballet, but some modern, tap, jazz, swing, and other styles here and there on the side. I took a Flamenco class for a semester in college and really enjoyed the experience. So, clearly, I'm only just a Flamenco novice, but I do know how dance classes of various skill and formality levels are run. I thought I would refresh my memory and sneak in a bit of post-work activity with an instructional DVD. This not only seemed to be the most popular Flamenco instructional DVD on Amazon, but it also had the best reviews. I couldn't wait for it to come.

Unfortunately, I immediately sent it right back to whence it came. While Puela's performances are lovely and her introduction to Flamenco is informative, this DVD seems sorely incomplete. WHERE is the warm up?  There is none. There's also no technique section to speak of. I should have taken the description more literally, I guess, when it said ""learn two beautiful dances,"" because that's all that there is on this DVD. There are step-by-step breakdowns of specific routines. The end. While this DVD would be a nice addition for someone who can already do their own Flamenco warm up and technique, it is not at all what I expected from a beginner instructional DVD.

I wouldn't have given it such a bad review if I didn't feel like it was actively misrepresented. The ""Active Lifestyle Makeover"" label gives the impression of a class-like light activity/work out video. I have several dance instructional videos and nearly all of the beginning level have a ""virtual class"" sort of set up with a warm up and specific technique exercises prior to choreography sections. I really did want to love it, but it was neither what I feel like it was represented to be nor what I was looking for.",1275523200,12,1797,4.680379746835443
2634532,3,B000HD1MV6,"Having taken a beginners Flamenco class, I wanted to continue to practice without forgetting all the moves, while away. This DVD is lovely and so is  Ms. Puela, However, I wish she'd taken a little slower approach.  Doing ""like this:"" with your  hands, won't really TEACH you how to do the quite complex hand/ arm/ fingers movements , on which I have been working with a private teacher over a good several hours. Spending extra 5 minutes at the beginning,  JUST on fingers, wrist and elbows, would be exactly what is needed, in my opinion.
 If you are a quick learner, can watch and imitate, or if you just want to get the general sense of Flamenco, then this video is good for you.",1253664000,,683,4.475806451612903
2634533,5,B000HD1MV6,"I was looking for some gypsy dance instructional DVDs & came across 3 names of interest: Dalia Carella, Vashti, & Puela Lunaris.  All 3 have something to offer.  The ""Gypsy Tangos"" on this DVD is a great choreography, which I have learned & performed in public. I like that Lunaris has the full version of the dance in both the instructional mode & a performance, and that you can download the music for $1 with either Spanish lyrics or English. The white background is also good in reducing distractions.  On the negative side, you only see the choreography from the front (no mirror image or view from the back), and Lunaris' sense of timing is rather fluid. But it is still a good DVD, and a great value for the money.",1247961600,3,721,4.488549618320611
2634534,3,B000HD1MV6,I really like Puela.  I loved her first 2 dvds.  This one for some reason didn't affect me like the others.  Its not that her teaching style is any different.  It just doesn't appeal to me to where its fun to learn it.,1229212800,,218,4.0
2634535,5,B000HD1MV6,"In my discovery of Gypsy bellydance, I noticed there were alot of flamenco moves and hand gestures.  I went on to Amazon and checked out reviews of flamenco DVDs  finding that Dance Today and Flamenco You Can Do It (both demonstrated by Puela Lunaris) had great reviews- many from other bellydancers!
After quickly receiving the DVDs, I was  very impressed on the step-by-step instruction and the enthusiasm and charm of Ms. Lunaris .
I would certainly recommend these two DVDs to learn this beautiful art.
I'm pretty sure clips of these DVDs can be reviewed on YouTube.",1190332800,10,570,4.855670103092783
2634536,3,B000HD1MV6,"The instructor was a very informative and descriptive, however it was hard to follow. She showed how to move and how to act but she didn't put the steps together very well. Was a lot of fun to do, but if you want to finish the dance from beginning to end you will have to be very patient because she shows you the moves she just doesn't show you how to put them all together. You have to do that yourself and by watching the demo.",1189641600,2,430,4.011627906976744
2634537,3,B000HD1MV6,"Puela speaks very clearly.  You will feel comfortable with her.  Her explanations are quite thorough and you can see that she has worked hard in this production.
Her style is ""classical"". Her choreographies, as a whole, are not what you might see in Spain today.  She does get across in a fun way, which is a good way to get acquainted with the dance, since modern-day Flamenco can be quite demanding.  My review is based on my experience as an ""intermediate"" dancer who has studied (and lived briefly) in Sevilla.",1181779200,21,514,4.677777777777778
2634538,5,B000HD1MV6,"I've been looking for a DVD like this one for years! I've been dancing Middle Eastern for years, but have always been fascinated by gypsy and flamenco dance. I've bought several videos, some of them better than others, but with one exception (and that DVD only offered a few steps), they don't break down the posture, hand movements, upper body/lower body steps, etc.

Lunaris' DVD is completely the opposite! Lunaris breaks down both dances into combinations, which she then carefully breaks down still further, beginning with the absolute basic -- how to get your skirt up to your hand. From there, she explains posture and attitude, separates and explains upper and lower body steps and hand movements, and then demonstrates how to put it all together.

On top of this, Lunaris is lovely, and her demeanor and accent are delightful. She provides additional personal commentary on a few steps, too -- for instance, she describes how, in Spain, children learn one hand movement as ""picking an apple, eating the apple, throwing the apple away."" The DVD is so detailed and careful, I'd happily pay this much for a video that provided just *one* of these dances!

I also *love* the way Lunaris explains dance as a language. She teaches the steps as ""vocabulary,"" then suggests that once you know the vocabulary, you can improvise to music.

My only complaint with this video -- and it's slight enough, I still wish I could give this DVD a dozen stars! -- is that she faces the viewer and uses terms like ""this leg"" instead of ""right leg.""

Nevertheless, this DVD is an absolute must-buy if you've ever been intrigued by Spanish dance, whether gypsy or flamenco. It's a fantastic addition for Middle Eastern dancers who would like to add a little flair to their dance. When I'm finished with this review, I'm going to buy both of Lunaris' other videos!",1176508800,67,1849,4.80188679245283
2634539,5,B000HD1MV6,"Beautiful, beautiful! Who doesn't want to dance majestically like this beautiful lady? She is captivating from beginning to end.

Learn the beautiful Gypsy tango! Hips, swaying, skirt flying, beautiful hand movement. From posture to skirt basic technique, arm and body placement to hand, finger, wrist, movement very well broken down and easily explained.

11 combinations guide you into a beautiful gypsy tango. Learn turns, skirt technique, intricate footwork.

The Farruca with 10 combinations; the most interesting for me was the flat, point, heel. Try it with speed for a challenge!

 This is bold, heavy footwork with aggressive combinations.

2 live performances by Puela Lunaris, who beautifully executes the Gypsy Tango and Farruca two dances of Spain. Although I am a belly dancer, overall I feel this program has brought more grace and elegance into my personal style.  Dance being so universal marries the common ground in gypsy tango that I devote to my dance to create my own special blend. This was a good learning experience bringing variety and versatility for my audience.",1171065600,27,1090,5.265895953757226
8138674,4,B000HD1MV6,Very interesting and fun.,1426204800,,25,5.5
8138675,5,B000HD1MV6,This is one of the two Flamenco dance DVDs that my sister and I bought when we first started taking Flamenco classes. It's very helpful for beginners during practice sessions.,1423267200,,175,4.866666666666666
8138676,1,B000HD1MV6,"First, this is barefoot flamenco.  It doesn't teach any footwork, and while she is clearly a great dancer, the instruction, at least as recorded, wasn't very good.  Utterly disappointed - I really wanted to love this DVD.",1394150400,2,221,4.945945945945946
8138677,3,B000HD1MV6,Maybe it is unfair for me to look for a step by step dance central break down on the moves but it is not like I cannot get it. This is my first Flamenco DVD so who knows if it gets any better. Some moves I wish she would go over a few more times as I am not a dancer. That I mean by this is some of the turns I wish she would go over the footwork so that my timing is better. I think I was expecting too much.,1381017600,,409,3.4565217391304346
8138678,2,B000HD1MV6,"I am a professional dancer and teacher of world styles.  I enter Flamenco as a student - a beginner.  I was very excited to purchase this DVD after reading all the reviews.  No doubt she is knowledgeable and a fantastic performer however I don't rate this as a good DVD to learn Flamenco if you are a beginner.  Here's my feedback.....
a) a small annoyance is she is very fair skinned and teaching on a bright white background and perhaps it was my screen but this really hurt the eyes to concentrate on basically white on white.
b) I love her routines but i just don't understand who devised the way of putting this instructional DVD together.  The menu says learn the step or learn the steps with music. She is covering way too much content or detail in one hit - there is no revision of the step unless you keep rewinding the dvd.
c) in this day and age everyone she be offering a front and back view on their teaching dvd - if not teach infront of a mirror so that students can still choose their view. With so much footwork and intricate turns etc it gets very confusing as a beginner especially since she dosent really review the steps at tempo repeatedly.
d) that would be my biggest criticism.... teach the steps, then review them slowly, then at tempo several times each to give people a chance to drill and get it in their head.  It feels like she just wants to teach the routine.  Then if you are teaching in sections teach, review, drill, at tempo WITH THE MUSIC, repeat.i
I have done this DVD once and thrown it on the desk to collect dust it was super frustrating and i cannot see how a beginner who wants to learn this style would not feel even worse.
Fire the director I say.  She is super talented and the choreography is beautiful - the format this is taught will see it staying on my bookshelf until i feel like punishing myself again.  I bought her other Flamenco DVD and Im not even motivated to open it if this is anything to show.  Very disappointing.",1366934400,3,1974,4.3396739130434785
8138679,5,B000HD1MV6,"I highly recommend this video for Flamenco students and even for
good exercise techniques. I gave the video to my daughter who is the
dancer in the family. She got some great tips and new techniques
from the video. Ole!",1365206400,,219,4.5
8138680,5,B000HD1MV6,I think this instructional video is great. She really breaks down the dance movements. She makes it easier to learn,1361750400,,115,4.8
8138681,5,B000HD1MV6,"Compared  to another company, you deliver what you promise, the other company sent me a demonstration video not an instructional video.  The quality of the video production is excellent.  You met my expections.  Ole!",1361577600,,216,5.264705882352941
8138682,3,B000HD1MV6,"For the price, this DVD has not been bad at all. The tangos was a little bit disappointing. It will give you some good moves to incorporate into your own dance but basically there was no footwork in it at all. The Farruca is a stronger dance with better choreography but there a few problems in Combination 8 where what she shows the viewer in the step-by-step instruction and what she actually dances in the demonstration/practise part do not match. The footwork is essentially the same at first ""digada digada digadagataga va"" but she adds some steps, armwork and clapping in the actual dance demo which she does not give any instruction for. Experienced dancers should be able to follow it after watching the demonstration a few times (or many times in my case :) ) over but it could easily throw a beginner. In the second part of combination 8, she changes the variation ending a couple of times from ""digada digada digadagataga vava daga vava daga va"" to ""digada digada digadagataga vava dagataga vava dagata va"" and then ""digada digada digadagataga vava dagataga vava dagataga va"" during the instruction part. I think she actually dances the last one.  She also doesn't mention how many times the third part of this combination (diga) should be repeated. Apart from the inconsistencies with Combination 8, the rest of the instruction is good. It would also have been useful if she could have showed the steps facing the other way so that it would have be easier to follow her.",1339977600,2,1482,4.744186046511628
8138683,2,B000HD1MV6,"The video came in in record time and the seller is great, but the video is not good. I used to dance Flamenco and just wanted a routine video to practice on my own, but this is not it. I don't know this performer, but she does not compare to my maestra Ana Esmeralda and others that I observed. Her hands are not like ""palomas"", her feet not strong, she sometimes are out of measure and beat... very disappointing...",1317859200,,416,4.2784810126582276
