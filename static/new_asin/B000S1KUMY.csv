2878940,5,B000S1KUMY,"Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien is a beautiful story about love and betrayal. Spanning 14 episodes this story is probably the only anime that I have viewed that is true to life and human nature.

While it is very soap opera-ish, there is a beauty to this series that is unique. For the avid anime fan this is a must see. To the casual viewer this series might be better left alone or rented.

Hopefully the OAV will make its way over to the US.",1212710400,2,432,4.130952380952381
2878941,5,B000S1KUMY,"first of all i would like to say, this is the most passionate anime i'v ever seen. its for mature viewers. it's not hentai if that's what you think. it's simply for mature viewers  cause of the deep love that each character experienced. well this anime doesn't just have love in it, it also have comedy. i recomend this anime for anyone who is in love. of course its kind of slow cause its love anime, but its very deep in passion. i have to say it's definitly worth the money buying this series.

ill be quick on the story line
first, two girl friends, haruka and mitsuki, became friend with two dudes, takayuki and shinji. the reason that haruka and mitsuki became freind with takayuki and shinji is because haruka likes takayuki. and mitsuki was trying to help her friend by getting close to them. but mitsuki doesnt realize that she was having some feelings for takayuki. and it seems as if takayuki has some feelings for mitsuki too. then mitsuki and shinji hooked takayuki with haruka. they became closer and soon they were lovers, but they did had a little trouble at the begining. later, haruka was put in a coma in an accident. she was waiting for takayuki at a station and probably a car hit her. after the accident, the story passed on to three years later. mitsuki and takayuki are now lovers. one day, takayuki got a phone call from haruka's sister akane. she told takayuki that haruka has awakened. the struggle for love began for mitsuki, takayuki, and haruka. shinji didn't matter much until the later epidsodes.... well i won't spoil the rest for you folks.. find out on yourself..",1211328000,,1598,4.583916083916084
2878942,5,B000S1KUMY,This was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. I read the synopsis and reviews and wasn't really impressed but the price that I bought it for was unbeatable so I had to. The story is touching and I really fell into the stories and emotions that each character presents. Then ending wasn't what I expected and I will have to admit that a tear or two appeared. I recommend this to anyone. There is some nudity so if anyone is looking to buy this for children beware of that.,1204761600,,482,4.138297872340425
2878943,5,B000S1KUMY,"This anime is very touching. The story is heart breaking. We can't blame any of the characters for the way they behave as it is completely out of their hands and they are simply doing their best under very stressful difficulties.
The story is definitely for adults as some of the content is mature orientated. It s great to see a series getting out of the high school theme and seeing them grow up into adulthood.",1192838400,5,413,4.447368421052632
2878944,5,B000S1KUMY,"Okay rumbling Hearts is a series that starts off like any typical shojo anime. In other words cute girl pinning for a guy, confessing her feelings. You know the bit. However unlike most Shojo this one takes a truly tragic turn when the cute girl, Haruka, gets into a traffic accident while waiting for her boyfriend and is servely wounded ending up in a coma. The next episode takes place three years later and shows how her boyfriend and her best friend have done their best to move on. Just as the two finally start to be able to move on, Haruka wakes up and throws a huge monkey wrench into things. Not only does she wake up but she has no idea that she's been in a coma for three years but instead thinks its only been a few days. What is a decent guy to do when his love for a girl he lost to tragedy some back when he already has a girl he cares for? That is the question the main male leads left with, but that's only one of the main plots. There's the guilt striken Best friend, the typical but devoted teenager younger sister, and of course Haruka all trying to find their happiness in a no win situation.

Now for the actual review. First off maybe most noteable is the art work. It is simply amazing. It's fluid, crisp, smooth and well just look at the box cover and you get the idea of just how good it is. The second most noteable is the music which is wonderful and heart felt, from its happy fiddles to the more lonesome guilt struck piano and voilen pieces. Now then is the story line. Why does this take such a low bar? Well because the story doesn't really start until the forth episode. However once it does it draws you in completely. As it is a shojo the story is character based, which for a change is a good thing. Though at first all the characters start off as typical stereo types they quickly change and develope according to their new found situation. What I really loved about the story was that despite most shows, anime or not, tend to focus on the supposed main victum (the person in the coma) this one takes the time to show how such an event makes everyone involved is a victum. It goes that extra mile to show who everyone suffers tremendously. While there are a few truly funny jokes the series has a solemn to even depressing atmosphere to it. The voice acting is extremely well done, though there are times when the main male lead sounds almost drunk but only for a line or two. As excellent as everything is the story is really the gem of the series, which for a shojo is rare.

Now I usually go one about all the stuff with the series and in the case of most Shojo that tends to be a lot. However, I amd more then happy to say this series really doesn't have any errors or flaws in it, at all.

In the end I would have to say buy this series, it's more then worth the money even if it's only 3 dvds long. Now go buy this series!",1187740800,14,2868,4.1732851985559565
2878945,5,B000S1KUMY,"Rumbling Hearts is based off of a Japanese video game. I loved this series every single second of it. This is not like some weird fantasy world anime where they have like special powers its just basic human life on what normal humans do for a living and how relationships can be sometimes a real pain. If you love romance, drama, soap operas, about high school life then you should really watch this series. Its kind of like Degrassi in a way since they go to school and then fall in love and then they get betrayed by their partner. I wish Funimation would release the Rumbling Hearts video games here in America I think they would really sell since Rumbling Hearts is like one of the best animes ever made. Sometimes this series has some comedy in it but its mostly depressing but at the same time its great. Plus, who knows maybe if enough people buy this maybe Funimation might just release the Rumbling Hearts video games. I give it a 10 out of 10 and 5 stars. Now lets bring this series to Blu-Ray!",1186876800,8,1004,4.374331550802139

2878966,5,B000S1KUMY,"Rumbling Hearts (Kimi ga Nozomu Eien) begins as a typical high school anime.  An outgoing girl helps a shy friend get together with a boy both girls like.  Then a debilitating accident strikes one of the characters, and each of the characters, in a post-high world, deals with the results of the tragedy.  The pace, here, is slow, but what is built is worthwhile.  At the conclusion, it's the character whom one might have thought of as the weakest who finds the courage to face a trap no one should ever be in and make a decision.  One of the greatest good-by scenes I've ever met: heart-wrenching and real.

Years later, this is still something I can touch.",1407801600,,659,4.5423728813559325
2878967,5,B000S1KUMY,"This is a great series!!

Plot: (minor spoiler) This series follows Takayuki Narumi a boy in highschool who falls in love with a girl named Haruka Suzumiya. The lovers relationship was going along good but on one of the dates Takayuki is late meeting Haruka. Haruka waits. As Takayuki gets to the meeting place it is surrounded by people watching firetrucks and amblances take someone away as he gets closer to the sceen of the accident he sees one of Haruka's bows she always wore in her hair on the ground all covered in blood. It is later found out she is in a coma for 3 long years. As time passes on Takayuki loses pretty much all touch of reality and falls into a super deep depression where his friend  Mitsuki saves him and becomes his lover while Haruka is in a coma so he had to move on with his life and get better. But the story truly begins after the 3 years when Haruka awakes from the coma and the loving feelings he once had for her come back in full swing but at the same time he fully loves Mitsuki so Takayuki  will need to make a choice.

Voices: I think Fundimation did another wonderful job again

Cons: One of the cons with the whole anime is that the ending is somewhat unexplaned. Watch the series to find out! Another con that I find with the whole series on the box it says ""14 UNCUT episodes"" from what I saw I didn't see much theres nothing to edit from the tv to unedit to dvd. The Worst looking scene from the show is Haruka's accident was a little bit bloody and theres 1 to 2 scenes where Takayuki and Mitsuki make out with Mitsuki boobs are showing brefily but thats really it

Overall: I like the series, BUY IT!!!",1405296000,,1649,4.252396166134186

2878987,1,B000S1KUMY,"Never. NEVER in my LIFE have I watched a show that made me so utterly FRUSTRATED and ENRAGED. I don't want to spoil, but I will say this. If you're looking for an anime with deep, meaningful relationships or some sort of answer for your problematic love life, look AWAY from Rumbling Hearts. The main character is perhaps the most obnoxiously OBLIVIOUS character I've ever had the PAIN of knowing. Ultimately, you will feel drained by the lack of sympathy this character has. Your only attachment? The suffering that the two lead females feel. Watch for the train wreck. Don't watch if you don't want RAGE.",1374624000,42,606,4.726415094339623
2878988,5,B000S1KUMY,"This review isn't going to be too helpful, so feel free to skip it.

I thought the show was pretty good.  It's basically a tragic romance with very little comedy.  The only light humor is character interactions with each other, and this type of interaction only happens in the early beginning - way before the tragedy begins.

The turning points and stressful spots are well timed for this series, and, even though you'll see them coming, they do still give you reason to keep watching.

The characters can be very unlikeable.  They all have their problems that need to be ironed out, and they're all pretty dull in their own right... but... they kinda do seem real.  We're all, on average, very dull, so this seems to fit well.  However, this can be a heavy drawback for most.  They have personalities, however, they are unlikeable personalities... keep that in mind.

I dislike romance shows, but I love anime... so i buy highly rated ones to give 'em a watch.  I'm glad I saw this.  It's pretty good all-in-all and it's memorable.  It's not MY thing, but at least I feel i got a good story out of it.  I truly did.",1370476800,,1117,4.492537313432836

2878990,5,B000S1KUMY,"When I was young, I sat down to watch this anime and the motivation was watching a really sad AMV from an anime convention called Sayonara. I saw this at Sakura Con 2008 and it made me cry and made me go and pick up the anime).

Anyways, this is one of the saddest ""harem"" animes out there. It's not like School Days where things got from bad to worse because of stupidity and its a ""harem"" because its a visual novel game where the main guy could choose any girl he wants but the anime doesn't treat it like a harem and it focuses on a drama love triangle instead of the harem visual novel and its better this way because two of the five love interests are not only ""loli"" girls but they serve as the comic relief of this really depressing series.

The series starts out as a cute slice of life. Takayuki Narumi (the main guy) is best friends with Shinji Taira and Mitsuki Hayase. Takayuki originally had a crush on Mitsuki but he kept it a secret. Mitsuki liked him to but seeing her friend Haruka Suzumiya madly in love with Takayuki, she sets them up on a date. At first, its awkward given Takayuki doesn't understand Haruka and Haruka is too shy to voice her feelings but after a talk, the two start to fall for each other.

Tragedy strikes though. Takayuki is known for being late to his dates (unintentionally) but because he was late this time, Haruka is involved in an accident sending her into a coma. Takayuki blames himself for not picking her up on time and falls into despair and almost goes insane if Mitsuki didn't intervene and comfort him. This results in a misunderstanding from Haruka's little sister Akane and she shuns the two for betraying her unconscious sister.

3 years later, Takayuki has recovered and works at a restaurant while Mitsuki lost most of her life giving up on swimming and working as an office lady. The two are together now and happy, but that happiness comes crashing down when Haruka wakes up not realizing that she's been in a coma for 3 years. The drama continues.

But yes, this series is very depressing. I know people hate Mitsuki for going back on her friend but she was in a lose lose situation with watching Takayuki go insane or go back on Haruka knowing that if she were to wake up, she might not forgive her.

So make sure to grab the tissue box when you watch this anime. You'll be bawling your eyes out especially with the bittersweet ending.",1362614400,3,2399,4.416289592760181
2878991,1,B000S1KUMY,This anime was so retarded. A whole bunch of stuff was happening and he ended up with the blue haired girl! They were all so dramatic and the voice acting was bad for the english dub.,1358812800,,183,4.111111111111111
2878992,5,B000S1KUMY,"There are regular animes...and then there is Rumbling Hearts. I do tend to go for more slice of life dramas. I didn't know exactly what to expect from this one. I watched it first on Hulu and after finishing it, i HAD to have the DVD. Luckily, they had the S.A.V.E. edition so i snatched it up quickly and as soon as they dvds arrived, I watched it again. Often the series hits very raw nerves and even makes you think to yourself how you would feel in the same situation. The show dives into the human heart and puts people in the most insane situations and watches how they handle them. Keep in mind, this is NOT an anime for children. This is very much an adult feature as it deals with very adult situations and relationships. It makes you ask yourself ""How would you feel if someone you loved was taken from you?"" It then pushes that question and follows it up with ""Now how would you feel if that lost love came back to life years later?"" There will be times where you will cry. It is that type of Anime, but you will end up loving it exactly for that reason. If you ever thought of trying anime with a real life feel to it, this is where you want to go. I have watched this series over at least 8 times and I never get sick of it. The emotion lasts and the feelings remain.",1353888000,,1280,4.124
2878993,4,B000S1KUMY,This is basically an romance anime with some sad drama.  I can recommend this to any anime fan who likes love triangles and stories with sad tragic events.,1353110400,,155,4.535714285714286
2878994,5,B000S1KUMY,"I'm a little embarrassed to admit it, but I bought this series b/c the art on the box was pretty. You're probably thinking, smooth move dude. You're darn right it was. Rumbling Hearts is great. This is one of the most heartbreaking animes I've ever watched. It is about a group of four friends. just as the main character, Takayuki, and one of the girls, Haruka, start going out Haruka is hit by a bus and is thrown into a coma that lasts for years. After a very long bought with depression and drinking Takayuki's heart is being healed by Haruka's best friend Mitsuki. Mitsuki takes care of him and essentially saves him from a very sad ending. As feelings start to bloom between Mitsuki and Takayuki, Haruka wakes up. What do you do when your first love who you thought was dead and the girl that saved you from misery are both there and ready to be with you forever. Takayuki is thrown into a world of confusion. There's no way for everyone to be happy.

I was very touched by this story and I think it's a must see for any anime fan, of a more mature age. It starts out looking like a high school romance series, but quickly turns into an adult story. About everyday life and learning to live with grief. There is nudity, sex, and a lot of heavy and emotional content. It made this grown man cry. I can't imagine what kind of toll it could take on a tender hearted female. But it ranks up there with the best anime dramas ever! My only complaint is the length. I wish that it had went longer. It's amazing that they were able to develop suck strong characters in the 14 episodes that it ran. This series can be summed up in 1 word very easily...WOW!",1349740800,2,1653,4.298076923076923
2878995,4,B000S1KUMY,"Kimi ga Nozomu Eien (The Eternity You Desire) is a Japanese visual novel (interactive novel/game similar to choose your own adventure stories) released on PC, then later ported to Dreamcast and PS2.  In 2003 the game was made into a 14 episode anime TV series.  There is also a 4 episode OVA with an alternate ending to the TV run.

At first glance, this is a strong series.  The American title is unfortunate because it really is the worst sounding name for an anime series, it sounds more like a Romance novel.  You know; the ones with the half naked guy on the cover and the woman draped over him.  But the series doesn't quite get into the 'romance' genre.  Instead this series is about relationship struggles, guilt, and the actions of the characters after a certain event.  This review points out a lot of shortcomings, but I'm being nitpicky.  It's actually a very good series, but one I felt could have been improved upon.  But for those who enjoy some melodrama, it's worth watching.

This next section will contain a few early spoilers, so read at your own risk (though even the Amazon editorial review AND the back cover of the series mention everything I will mention here).  The story centers around 5 main characters: Haruka and Akane Suzumiya, Takayuki, Mitsuki and Shinji (though involved in some major events, he is a secondary character).  Takayuki and Haruka date in high school, though you get the sense that Mitsuki likes him.  Takayuki is on his way to meet with Haruka one day, but is distracted when he sees Mitsuki.  They go shopping briefly, but he realizes that he is very late to his meeting with Haruka.  He finally gets to their rendezvous only to discover that Haruka was involved in a serious accident.  Takayuki is overcome with guilt, since his tardiness indirectly contributed to the accident (she was in the wrong place at the wrong time - if he had met her on time, then she wouldn't have stayed in that spot and been hit by a vehicle).  So Haruka winds up in a coma.  This is really where the series starts.  Episode three opens with the title song and credits and the series takes place three years later. Three years have passed and everyone is living their lives.  Takayuki is involved with Mitsuki and he hasn't been to see Haruka in the hospital.  Finally he hears that Haruka has woken up, and this is where things get messy.

A few things are rather far fetched.  The doctors want to keep the truth from Haruka so Takayuki and everyone must pretend that no time has passed.  So Haruka is obviously fraught with mental issues, but it doesn't really come off right.  It seems cruel at times that everyone is forced to lie to her, and even when she starts figuring out that more time has passed than everyone lets on, they go to even bigger steps to hide the truth (fearing a relapse).  It seems that this was created just to give some conflict to the relationship between Mitsuki and Takayuki.  Already the guilt has nearly consumed them, but now the writers add even more strife into their life.  It makes the viewer almost think that Haruka waking up was one of the worst case scenarios.  It really doesn't endear viewers to Haruka's character.

The struggles between Takayuki and Mitsuki are pretty melodramatic.  They argue about the most inane issues when merely talking to each other would solve everything.  And of course, many relationships do have these issues, but this show takes things to extremes.  Especially since the two aren't long time spouses that have grown tired of each other or anything like that.  The two seem fond of each other, but each takes turns being very depressed while the other confesses his/her love.  Then the depressed one becomes positive and the previously happy person becomes angry and depressed.  It's this constant see-saw which gets a little frustrating and the main reason I docked a star.

And don't hate on this review because of that.  If one compares this series with Clannad (a solid five star young romance story) then the results are obvious.  Though this series has a bit more 'adult' feel with the characters struggling with their jobs and real life, Clannad seemed to just have a better story and much more likable cast of characters.  Though we do feel sorry for Takayuki and feel his guilt, we don't really cheer anyone in this series on.  It is like watching a depressing puppet show at times.

The other real let down is the side stories.  The restaurant girls are more annoying than endearing, though they have their moments at times.  I felt that the writers could have done a bit more with their characters.  Also, the nurses and doctor are walking anime stereotypes.  Another area that the series could have improved on.  Really the most interesting character to me was Akane, Haruka's younger sister.  I really felt the writers and creators had a soft spot for this girl.  She's really the only honest and stoic of the main characters.  Sadly, she got much less screen time than the others.

What the series does well though is bring a more adult story to the screen.  There are a few 'boob shots', so beware of animated breasts.  I think that was the main reason we see a TV-14 rating.  There is little profanity, usually from the mouth of the blonde waitress girl ('son of a ____' and 'go step in cat crap').  But I was watching in Japanese with English subtitles, so the English dub might be different.

The translation of the subtitles are very spot on.  I hugely applaud Funimation for accurate translations.

Animation is of good quality, even if it is nearly 10 years old.  Some of the characters really have an 'anime stereotype' look, even Mitsuki with her blue hair and cat ear part.  There is a little background music, and it is mostly sweet sounding piano pieces.

Overall I think this was a good series.  I did buy it, and it was about $15 so it wasn't a big disappointment.  If I had paid $25 or $30 I would have been peeved.  I would recommend it for at least one viewing through.  As far as a purchase?  I'm actually reselling my copy if that tells you anything.  I'm glad I saw it, but I don't really foresee watching it again.  But it's generally very good.

2878996,5,B000S1KUMY,"Well, what can a say? I wasn't expecting this series to impress me but I was really surprised with it. It's a really good story of friendship and growing up. The one thing I really liked was the way the hero is taken care of by a girl that has real feelings for him but really wants him to accept her for herself. He comes across as a guy who really doesn't know where he's going. His first ""affair"" is with a girlfriend of the girl who secretly likes him. (This girl has as crush on him.) His secret ""lover"" almost pushes him into the affair and he just ""goes with the flow"". What makes this interesting is you aren't told about her feelings until after his first girlfriend is in an accident and she does what's needed to jar him out of it. That's really the one thing that bugged me. You find yourself almost yelling at the screen for the guy to wake up. Anyway, this is a really good series and I highly recommend it!",1338249600,,921,4.179775280898877
2878997,1,B000S1KUMY,"Mitsuki and Takayuki disgust me.  Takayuki had no interest in Haruka, the poor girl who really liked him, yet he had no problem having sex with her.  He really wanted Mitsuki, but Mitsuki felt sorry because her friend Haruka liked him so she gave her a chance to be with him.  But then when Takayuki and Haruka have a date, Mitsuki tries to catch Takayuki by himself and make him feel sorry for her because it's her birthday and she's sad.  BOO FREAKING HOO.  She's the one who pushed her two friends to date each other.  It's not right for her to try to come between them, now.  But to make things even worse, on his second date with Haruka, Mitsuki tries to catch him alone again, on his way to meet Haruka, and this time, Haruka gets hit by a car.  So now, the poor girl will be in the hospital, in a coma, and this gives her two ""friends"" a chance to be together in a Joke of a relationship behind her back.  The writers of the show try to make you feel sorry for Mitsuki, but I Never did.  She was just a skank who took the convenience of Haruka's coma to steal her boyfriend and sleep with him.  Pretty much all she did throughout the whole show was stand in front of Takayuki, tear her clothes off and get him to have sex.  And they kept it secret from Haruka for a long time.  They were Not real Friends to her.  They were liars and Fakes who only cared for themselves and their own selfish needs.  And just when you think Takayuki might actually Grow Up and be a real man by taking responsibility with Haruka, he backs off and decides he doesn't want her.  And Mitsuki, in a selfish act of revenge, sleeps with another guy who really liked her.  But she still wants Takayuki.  Once again, they try to make you sympathize with her by making her say, ""Am I really a bad person?""  Uh, let's see...you STOLE your friend's boyfriend while she was in a coma.  Yeah, you're a bad person.  In a last ditch effort to make Takayuki feel sorry for her, she tells him she's leaving town.  While he's visiting Haruka in the hospital, Haruka tells him she doesn't need him.  Her sister told her what was really going on.  That is the ONLY part of the whole show I like.  So he runs off to stop Mitsuki from leaving by telling her her loves her.  And they get together.  So they're still selfish scumbags who betrayed Haruka.  Surprise, surprise.  Haruka becomes a children's book author.  She and her sister are the only characters I like the entire time.  But ultimately, I didn't like the show enough to ever want to watch it again.  They tried too hard to get you like the two Selfish Cheaters Mitsuki and Takayuki.  And in the end, I Hated them.",1337126400,,2644,4.276767676767677
2878998,5,B000S1KUMY,"I usually don't write reviews on Amazon because there's usually a billion reviews for the things I buy, but I felt I needed to on this one.

First let me say that the SAVE Edition / Viridian Collection of Rumbling Hearts The Complete Series has all 14 episodes uncut in 4:3 ratio. The audio is BOTH English and Japanese Dolby Digital and Stereo. It also has English Subtitles. There are no art books or anything like I hear the more expensive version has. The set is split up onto three DVDs. You can also find Textless Opening and Closing Songs and Trailers.

Now about the story. Without giving anything away, I must say this story is amazing if you love Tragic Romances like I do. It's set in the real world, so you won't get any of that weird stuff from some anime like time travel or super powers. The story is completely driven on emotion and I believe there is no real right or wrong way it could end. In fact, I read this anime was originally a PC game that had multiple endings you could choose.

2879003,3,B000S1KUMY,"Not many anime out there that I find myself unable to stop watching. After watching the first episode or two, I knew I'd like the series, but as with any good anime, I was in no mood to rush through it.  With that being said, today I blew through two and ahalf discs worth of episodes. I couldn't help myself.

The depth of emotion in this series is really something.  I was drawn into the world these characters lived in.  The depression, the anxiety, etc.  I was so connected and invested, that I had to see it through to the end.  An ending that would hopefully make things ok.  An ending that would relieve the tension and sadness.  Something to redeem the tragic theme of the series....

That ending never came.  We received, what I perceive to be, a very shallow closing that makes absolutely no psychological sense whatsoever.  Takayuki and Mitsuki....Really?  After spending the entire series together as nothing more than empty shells of human beings that acted as nothing more than a crutch for each other, I am to believe they were truly in love with each other the entire time?  In spite of all the neglect, pain, and anger they inflicted upon each other?

If this is the case, then what was the point of this anime?  Haruka's accident?  What was that exactly for?  Why was her character included?  Taka and Mits were together for 3 years after the events early in the series.  What the hell kind of payoff did we get?  Those two still together, and Haruka's existance ultimatey meaningless.  Takayuki supposedly loved Haruka so much that he is completely lost.  Distraught.  Doesn't see a point in living.  Enter the self centered opportunist Mitsuki.  Hooray, she commits to a failure of a 3 year relationship with Takayuki that looks more like loathing than love, but I'm to believe that mess can be redeemed into a believable love?  A happy ending?  NO. We see Takayuki's pain.  His anguish.  His regret.  We see the hope and light return to him when Haruka begins to improve.  He shows signs of his feelings for her returning to the forefront.  The kiss...the fact that he was ready to be intimate with her right in her hospital bed...THEN... he sees her scars...and is repulsed...  Lost interest.  From that moment on, it started the downhill slide for me.  That ending destroys any crediblity Takayuki and Mitsuki have.  Those two scumbags deserve a life of mysery together.

What angers me so much is how much I loved the series til the last two episodes, in which I knew what was coming.  An ending that made no sense based on the 20 plus episodes that preceeded it.  An ending without redemption.  An ending that left me angry, disgusted, and repulsed.",1304726400,3,2674,4.65450643776824

 This is not going to blow away with all the action...it is not that type of series. It centers on emotional pain and how some people deal or choose not to deal with it. As for myself I could identify with Mitsuki and what it is like to care for someone and watch them slip away. I felt like crap the last several episodes but I could not stop watching. As I said this was very emotional for me because I have dealt with some of the issues in this series. There is a feeling that one gets when they take an emotional beating and Mitsuki looked she was taking one.

2879010,4,B000S1KUMY,"""Rumbling Hearts"" is a heart-wrenching romantic melodrama told in 14 half-hour episodes. If you like your romances laden with pain, anguish, and uncertainty about how everything is going to be resolved, this one's for you. If you prefer your love stories sugar-coated, with pat endings, and filled with false notions about human nature, then you should stick to your American dramas. I found this one quite compelling throughout.

This Japanese animated TV series was based on a videogame and tells the story of a love triangle involving Narumi Takayuki, his girlfriend Haruka Suzumiya, and Haruka's best friend, Mitsuki Hayase, all in their senior year of high school. In the first two episodes, it becomes clear that Mitsuki, who managed the difficult task of bringing Narumi and the awfully shy Haruka together, has designs on Narumi herself and begins intruding on their relationship to the point where she causes Narumi to arrive late to meet Haruka one evening only for Narumi to find that Haruka was seriously injured after being hit by a vehicle while waiting on the sidewalk and has been taken to a hospital. This is at the end of the second episode. Episode 3 takes place three years later and we gradually learn that Haruka's been in a coma all that time and Narumi and Mitsuki have become lovers, despite horrible feelings of guilt. At the end of ep. 3, Haruka wakes up for the first time and the female doctor leads her to believe it's still three years ago and urges Haruka's friends and family to play along until Haruka has recovered enough to withstand the shock.

When Narumi visits Haruka in the hospital, he cuddles with her gently on the bed and maintains the illusion that he's still her boyfriend. Mitsuki gets anxious about this and insists that he tell Haruka the truth about them. She even moves in with Narumi at some point during all of this. Both had taken jobs after high school instead of going to college, so we see them at their workplaces as well. Haruka's younger sister, Akane, has her ups and downs with Narumi, whom she once worshipped as ""Big Brother"" but feels betrayed now because he's with Mitsuki, although she softens toward him as he visits Haruka and keeps her spirits up. Akane wears her middle school uniform to the hospital to fool Haruka into thinking it's still three years ago (despite the fact that Akane looks three years older and the uniform's a little tight on her, a plot hole that the series never gets around).

I had little patience for Narumi's constant wavering and even yelled at the screen a few times, but in the end I think he makes the right decision, as much as it goes against the moral path I felt he should have taken. It was hard to feel sympathy for Mitsuki at first, since she so clearly betrayed her best friend, but she does suffer a lot--probably the worst of any of the characters--so she ultimately earns our sympathy. The final episode was deeply touching and offered a satisfying resolution. The basic situation here reminded me of an older anime series about a high school love triangle, ""Kimagure Orange Road,"" particularly its movie spin-offs.

Important supporting characters include Narumi's best friend, Shinji, who commits an act of betrayal himself; Dr. Kozuki, Haruka's doctor, whose dress is short and hair is unkempt and has a bent, unlit cigarette dangling from her lips at all times; and Mrs. Ishida, Mitsuki's boss at the trading firm where she works. There are two annoying nurses, one of whom looks and sounds like a child and one of whom is a hot redhead in a way-too-short pink uniform clearly designed as fan-service for male viewers, something that's evidently a holdover from the videogame. There are also two annoying little waitresses, Ayu and Mayu, at the family restaurant where Narumi works. They're supposed to provide comic relief, but I found them grating.

If you can get past those irritants, the series offers a visual style grounded in classical Japanese filmmaking. I love the way scenes are composed and edited and the way they're lit. It's quite a beautiful series to watch. Typical is a shot of Narumi sitting alone, in despair, in a dark and empty hospital waiting area, as well as various uses of public spaces in and around Yokohama, where the series takes place. The hospital faces a beach and there are many shots of golden sunsets seen from the window of Haruka's room. A picture book called ""Mayauru's Gift,"" about a forest elf who befriends a human girl, plays a prominent role in the story, particularly in the final episode. I like the understated music score, with lots of piano solos, and the lovely opening and end songs performed by Haruka's voice actress, Minami Kuribayashi. (Just for the record, I watched this with the Japanese soundtrack on, not the English dub.)

The show's source material is apparently a ""hentai"" dating simulation videogame, something I'm not familiar with, although the term ""hentai"" would imply lots of sex in the game. This is not the case in the TV series. There are a couple of tender lovemaking scenes between Narumi and Mitsuki and a few brief nude shots of Mitsuki, but nothing more graphic than that.",1283644800,,5168,4.8076490438695165
2879011,2,B000S1KUMY,"I just bought this box set and WOW, was I dissapointed. I don't know what others are talking about when they say this anime series is GREAT because it's not and here's why:

The BAD:
The English voice over was horrible. The characters had little to no personality. The *atmosphere was boring/everything took place in the same three areas. If you are someone who likes there to be more to an anime series then just a storyline, then this series is DEF. not for you. And the COMEDY parts (which dragged on in each episode) were ridiculous/not funny at all. This made the series confusing because there were ""comical"" parts and then dramatic/serious parts and both didn't go well together (in THIS series). I didn't even connect at all to the ""emotional"" parts, and that is rare for me.

The GOOD:
The main theme song is nice.",1280448000,3,823,4.591836734693878
2879012,5,B000S1KUMY,"This series is my sixth favorite anime series(I have seen around fifty). I don't like a lot of anime because a lot don't have a very good story line and characters that are not shallow. I am a very harsh critic and it is hard for much to appeal to me, but this anime series was touching.

It starts out like most anime dramas that are about high school students. A cute girl (Haruka Suzumiya) likes a cute boy (Takayuki Narumi) they get together and fall in love, but then the story does a 180. Takayuki is late for a date(like usual) and Haruka gets hit be a vehicle while standing on the sidewalk. She doesn't die, but she goes into a comma for about three years. Mean while her best friend (Mitsuki Hayase) cares for Takayuki because he blames himself for Haruka condition. Mitsuki falls in love with Takayuki while taking care of him then they start to date and Takayuki starts to return to his normal self. All of a sudden Takayuki gets a call one day and is told that Haruka woke back up and doesn't know she was in a comma for three years.

You will experience much pain, sadness and anger with the characters in this series. It is easy to relate to all of them throughout the whole story. If you like anime and stories that consist of much drama then you will enjoy this series. This story is not for people under the age of sixteen. There are several sex scenes, but the most you see are the breasts of the two main characters. So like I said don't expect to watch this with a child, but for adults I highly recommend this series.",1279238400,23,1539,4.285223367697594
2879013,5,B000S1KUMY,"Parents:
This is not --I repeat-- NOT a good anime for younger kids. I wouldn't recommend it for any child under 14 or 15. That is not to say that it's pornographic, but there is nudity. They show just enough to give the understanding of the sexual situations, but not enough to make me say porn. The interpersonal relationships are complex, and you may have yourself having to explain a lot of concepts if you're watching it with a young person. There... I've said my piece.

With that being said, I enjoyed this story. Most times in an anime series, I can sit through three or four episodes at a time, without stopping. This time, I couldn't. I had to watch each episode one at a time. I guess it's because there's a lot of emotional turmoil to deal with. The story seemed to capture the idea that life is not neat and tidy. There are times when you can't help hurting someone even when you don't want to. Sometimes you do have to give up the thing you think you want most, and sometimes good things come from the train wrecks of our lives.

I found I enjoyed the English voice cast, with the exception of Haruka. I think I can tell why they chose to make her voice sound so mousy, but I think sometimes they have a tendency to make all the women in an anime below the age of thirty sound like they're 12 years old. But now that I think about it, I think they did it to emphasis that Haruka is truly a part of Takayuki's childhood past in school, and at the same time found a voice for Mitsuki that actually sounded like a young adult woman who is very much a part of his present. The story boils down to a choice --do I try to recapture the past, or do I hold onto what I have and look towards the future?

All in all, I was very happy with the ending. The only problem I had with the ending was that I would have rather they brought the four friends together in some way that allows them to bury the past together and move on. It seemed like the last five minutes of the show were devoted entirely to Haruka's book and Akane. Mitsuki gets very little attention at all in that entire ending sequence. Other than that, I did enjoy this one, but I won't be showing it to anyone else. It's kind of one of those ones you need to watch by yourself with a box of kleenex and the curtain's drawn just in case you tear up a time or two.",1276819200,20,2331,4.141280353200883

After an accident happens things get really rough. Words are said and stuff happens. and the story gets sad and depressing after.

2879015,2,B000S1KUMY,"""Rumbling Hearts"" is a lousy, sexist romance anime, with women who are so dependent on their men and sex that it's just disgusting.

The plot revolves around Takayuki Narumi, some bumbling teenage guy who is a friend of Mitsuki Hayase, the top swimmer at the high school. One of Mitsuki's girl friends, Haruka Suzumiya, has a crush on Narumi, so Mitsuki hooks the two together. They become close friends, and they even have sex together. However, the love story is put on hold after a fatal car crash.

The second half of the story takes place three years later. Within this time period, Narumi has a romance with Mitsuki, who is now part of an insurance company. However, everything seems to change when Haruka returns miraculously.

Overall, the storyline is passable. However, ""Rumbling Hearts"" suffers from overplaying the drama. Mitsuki is a jerk, who really doesn't care much for her former friend who almost died in a car accident. In fact, Mitsuki spends half of the series worrying that Narumi will not love her anymore. She's so obsessed that she tries her best to keep Narumi's attention off of Haruka.

This story boils down to the voice actors and the story, which is already extremely overrated on the Anime News Network and [...] Web sites. Eventually, this anime revolves completely around Narumi's love relationships will all three girls in the story: even Haruka's sister. With so many girlfriends around, one will definitely why Narumi would want to focus on the selfish Mitsuki, who obsesses all the time about whether Narumi loves her.

Narumi claims that he doesn't want anyone to get hurt, but what he's really saying is that he wants to make sure Mitsuki doesn't kill herself looking for someone else to love her. The screenwriter is so self-centered in restraining Mitsuki to an overdependent relationship with Narumi. Honestly, women in Japan will never want to be this constrained to the servitude of other men.

In fact, the only likable character in this series is Haruka. Yet, even she keeps longing for a sexual relationship with Narumi after she awakens from her coma. Haruka is supposed to be the strong, independent girl who struggles courageously to recover, but even she is restricted to relying on Narumi for emotional support. Narumi is not trustable either: he lies about his own relationship status, supposedly to make sure Haruka doesn't get too shocked.

There's very little to appreciate about ""Rumbling Hearts,"" a 14-episode series based on an disgusting, erotic dating game. There should be no reason for it to gain so much popularity in America. However, the male audience of anime fans undoubtedly love this infantile orgy of adolescent sex and romantic overdependence.

2879018,1,B000S1KUMY,"Trust me, I like a good love story Anime (see peachgirl it's awsome!) but this is.. this is.. absolute torture. I didn't really feel like I was watching a romance anime with Rumbling Hearts, I felt more like I was watching a tradgedy, and it's really quite depressing. The plot of Rumbling Hearts is basicly Highschool friends that grow in to adults, and how their innocent years are behind them. They are now grown up and have grown up problems to deal with. The story revolves around a guy named Takayuki, his original love interest Haruka, and her friend Mitsuki. Their tight bond of friendship and love however fall apart one day when a terrible accident occurs leaving Haruka in a Coma. Then the story begans, and so it the good parts of it end. To better understand the anime I should break down the characters. Takayuki, is more or less the cowardly boy who is afraid to admit how he feels, is indecisive, and he is easily manipulated. To put it point blank, he has no spine when it comes to his life and the decisions he makes. Then we have Haruka, who is the nice shy girl who steals your heart. She is cute, kind, and you root for her all the way. She is really something else the kind of girl that's rare and hard to find. Last but not least we have Mitsuki. She is supposed to be the best friend of Haruka, but she is selfish, self centered, and can't seem to keep her clothes on. Matter of fact my main problem with this story is the relation ship of Takiyuki and Mitsuki. Through out the story even when they are little, it seems Mitsuki selfishly wants to be in a relationship with Takiyuki. She drags him away from Haruka when Takiyuki is in need of him. In other words she is closing in on her best friends man. Unfortanately an incident allows her best friend to be taken out the picture. While her best friend is in a Coma she seduces Takiyuki at his lowest moment and takes advantage of him, because she wants him to herself. Not to mention that she doesn't feel very much guilt about it, and for the most part could care less about her friend Haruka who is in a coma. She calls her the ""sad little girl"" and even tries to keep ""Takiyuki"" from seeing her, when he needs to be with Haruka for reasons beyond love. The plot focuses on Mitsuki's selfish needs and desires, and Takiyuki plays right in to her trap. Not to mention Mitsuki is quite a harlott. She isn't oh so faithful to Takiyuki, but she even turns that situation around to make herself seem like the victim. Meanwhile Haruka is the one left in the dark while her boyfriend and best friend have a love affair. Most of the time you feel depressed and pitty for Haruka because she is so innocent, and when she comes out her Coma she has to awaken to all these new issues that she doesn't deserve. The story really is on the far end of what a love story should be. The Male lead character is a wimp and no romantic, and his main love interest ""Haruka"" is the one he neglects the most. IF there is any real love or actual relationship between Takiyuki and Mitsuki they never show it. For the most part your left with the impression that Mitsuki takes advantage of Takiyuki, when he is obviously hurting. She manipulates him and almost forces a relationship out of a bad situation. Takiyki on the other hand is so brainless that he can't see past her obsession and self centered motives. He only repeats what it was like for him when he was younger.

2879021,5,B000S1KUMY,"This is a great anime, and it is different for the simple fact that it is very realistic.  It's not a giant robot monster anime, nor one where the male lead is getting repeatedly punched into the stars.  This is a very angsty anime about something that could potentially happen to someone in real life.  The anime is based off the Japanese video game Kimi ga Nozomu Eien (The Eternity You Desire), a very risque dating sim, and it stays pretty true to the game's form.  One thing that impressed me is that even though there is a fair share of nudity in the anime, none of it is gratuitous.  It all fits in with the story very well, so it's not just a fanservice anime.  I highly recommend this anime for people who like serious plots in their TV shows and anime.  It will take you on an emotional roller coaster and have you wanting more.",1216598400,4,838,4.2993630573248405

8203972,5,B000S1KUMY,"*SPOILER-FREE REVIEW*

The somewhat oddly-titled Rumbling Hearts (translated from its original title, it's more like ""The Eternity You Desire"") is, in a sentence, a deconstruction of the high-school-friends-are-friends-forever theme commonly played with in television and anime, in that the real world doesn't work that way.

If you're not sure what I mean by that, think of how Neon Genesis Evangelion was a deconstruction of mecha anime, and how they're kind of in the same category, but only in the most vague sense. Similarly, this is about a group of high school friends who appear to follow that same idea. What this show does is go about 10 or 20 levels deeper and inject some real life into the equation, which makes things complicated.

So, the series begins with this premise: There's a group of friends all in high school. There's a light romance between two characters, Takuyuki and Haruka, which is played cutesy and straight, that eventually develops the emotions of both people. In a way, the first episode is like the ending of most other RomCom anime, in that the couple gets together, pledges their love, and looks happy-ever-after. The group of friends take a photograph to remember that they'll always be friends, and never grow apart.

Most anime *end* at that point, usually with the photograph. Rumbling Hearts does not roll that way.

So the following happens, so this isn't a spoiler (it is on the box, after all, and this is where the story really begins): The girl is hit by a vehicle and ends up a bloody mess on the street, though she lives through it and is kept in a coma. The boy is unable to cope and develops posttraumatic stress disorder and fails to complete high school. In short, he loses his damned mind because his sense of safety in the world is gone. The other girl, who is a friend of theirs, was actually in love with the boy the whole time. Feeling responsible, and also because he's had a crush on him anyway, she follows him, giving up her own future in the process. They both struggle to maintain a minimal lifestyle with little money, very little education, and naturally, the emotional effects of trying to ""move on"" after Haruka's accident. They're haunted frequently by flashbacks of the gruesome scene of the accident and an unspoken longing to want their worlds to go back. Haruka awakens from her coma, but suffers memory loss, remembering very little of anything, including herself.

That's where the series actually begins. That sounds like a spoiler, I realize, and in almost all cases, it would be. But this anime does not screw around with hitting the viewer hard and fast. This is all at the very beginning of the series. The story is actually about the effects of all of this, on everyone involved, afterward.

Actually, I've seen ""tragedy"" anime, and this is still pretty relentless. Its portrayal of its themes, including PTSD and its lasting symptoms, trying to be a friend and lover to someone with the same, adult romance (this is not your usual anime romance, this is treated with hardcore portrayals of reality in even its positive themes, full of stuff that might hit a little too close to home), alcohol abuse, maintaining a facade of ""normalcy"", the downward spiral of depression, suicide, just dealing with everyday life...Among other things, these are all done with brutal realism.

Now, as with any fiction, it does take some liberties from dead-straight reality, though they're pretty forgivable. The doctor in charge of Haruka makes an initial decision that is very questionable, because there's no way she'd allow visitors for Haruka if she actually was in the state she is upon awakening. But the story does rely heavily on hospital visitations to see someone who's alive in some sense of the word, so while I'm normally super-scrutinizing about fictional medical liberties (especially regarding memory loss), it's okay in this case, and not too distracting.

Worth noting is that you can tell the writers weren't ignorant about the psychological themes present, and there are a lot. This is not an easy watch if the real world itself frightens you. This is certainly not an easy watch if you relate to any of its major themes of PTSD, bereavement, or depression. The main lead, Takuyuki, is not someone you'd want to emulate, but he's not supposed to be. The same applies to his lover, Mitsuki. No one here is perfect by any stretch, no matter how they seem to be at the start (which is kind of the point), but everyone is certainly well-intended, if misguided and confused.

This is an adults-only anime, and not just because of the content visible. It's adults-only because it's about how mercilessly depressing real life actually can get and the included efforts of simply dealing with it, which is the kind of stuff that is normally off-screen because no one wants to see it. In a way, it's even a bit sadistic, because this is certainly not meant to be a pleasant watch. You won't be ""rooting"" for anyone, and you're ultimately watching life unfold as it actually does, not as you think it should.

If you can stomach the exposed themes here and how tortuous it can actually be, it's actually quite addicting. Like a good book, you'll really want to watch ""one more episode"" just to see what happens next. There are no shortage of surprises, and things can get very real, very fast, perhaps way too fast for some to honestly handle.

It's still wonderfully done, though. They just don't make anime, or really anything, like this, anymore.",1448064000,2,5523,4.820485744456177
