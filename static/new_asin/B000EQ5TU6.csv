2527958,5,B000EQ5TU6,"Yup, the series is about tribal benders who can work with a particular element, earth, air, water or fire. The Avatar, a child, must master all 4. Talking about elements, this series has elements for great TV ---fun, excitement, great characters, plot, and wow, even Values! So this review is mainly for parents. I'm a mom and came to love this program too AFTER my kids urged me to watch every new episode along with them.

My sons, ages 7 and 11, started watching Avatar from the beginning and loved it so much they made sure they watched not only every new episode but also reruns. Of all the cartoons they watch, this one is very good in not only visuals (ala japanese anime), exotic locales, fun and excitement... but also in intriguing story telling and realistic character development.

Every episode is like a chapter in an epic, developing the plot and revealing more and more about each of the main characters Katara, Sokka and the Avatar Aang(ages 12-15) and also of the secondary characters(more kids and also adults). Their sidekicks are their helpful, sometimes silly, and endearing pets Apa and Momo.

The Avatar episodes bring the young heroes into situations where they have to make choices and as viewers we journey with them as the make both good and bad choices, and watch as they learn and mature as they go along.

The Avatar series reveals the universality of human spirit as the young heroes face challenges and conflict. Despite and maybe because of the exotic people and settings, the writers never resort to TV stereotyping about gender, color, age, weight, education or lack of, etc., that you find woven in for punch lines and demeaning in other TV programming.

This is the only or one of the few new popular kids programs that doesn't insult yours or your kids intelligence, and actually has family values. I highly recommend this cartoon to parents looking for something that the whole family can watch and have fun together.",1142985600,65,1957,4.795252225519288
2528039,5,B000EQ5TU6,"My kids really love the Avatar series and I even like watching it as well.  The plots are interesting and action packed and the characters are complex--even the ""bad guys"" aren't 100% evil.

Most of the DVDs can be viewed out of sequence but it does help to start from the beginning.",1178409600,,283,4.423076923076923
2528040,5,B000EQ5TU6,"This is a great series for all ages. It is a truely well written and well paced exposition of the process of growing up, making and keeping friends, and accepting a place in the world. Ang starts out as a kid who just wants to play and gradually over the series discovers how to be a responsible productive person. The side and back stories are also uplifting and instructive. Good for all ages. Most of the other things on Nick and CTV have devolved to cheap idiot food that has no art or story line. Kudos to whoever thought this series up.",1168560000,,542,4.323529411764706

2528044,5,B000EQ5TU6,"Being a college student has its ups and downs...one of those ups being when you're not stuck in front of the computer for hours on end (or in my case, wrapped up in books and scripts) it allows you to find some quality programming-and I'm not talking about American Idol and Laguna Beach. Surprisingly, I used to come home after class and find Avatar on all the time. At first, it was just another annoying cartoon-until I took a closer look. This series is great for families and people of all ages. The main characters are faced with many challenges that help represent many of the moral values kids miss out on these days by watching other shows. It is a fantastic parenting tool as well as being highly entertaining. Much of the comedy is directed at the younger audience, but somehow manages not to be patronizing to the older audience. It even has many of the characters loved by people of all generations-pirates, bandits, and warriors-while including a bit of history in the process. Overall, the animation is marvelously done, the voices are very fitting, and the scripts are very well written. I would highly recommend this!",1150243200,10,1134,4.732323232323233
2528045,5,B000EQ5TU6,"I love this series! One of my kids picked up vol 1 from the library and we can't wait until to get vol 3. The show is fun, has good values and enough action to keep kids interested. The characters are likeable and complex and the animation is great. All three of my kids aged 8-12 enjoy this show. Good music too!",1146787200,6,313,4.064516129032258
2528046,5,B000EQ5TU6,"Yes, I'm an adult, yes, I love Avatar. It's a kid's show but it's so exciting for adults too. It has both a cultural expert on their staff and a martial arts expert. The story telling is great and even if you don't like anime it's a good series.",1143936000,19,245,4.020408163265306

8112874,5,B000EQ5TU6,"My grandson and I were both spellbound by the continuing stories of Aang and his companions.
Young Aang is the Avatar - the one who can unite the spirit and human worlds.  But when he found out his destiny at a young age, he feared it and ran away from his teachers and responsibilities - and was lost for 100 years.  During this time much of the harmony among the different nations was lost as the fire nation sought to assert supremacy.  As a result, there was much destruction and many people suffered.  The avatar can help restore harmony.
The stories and characters in the series are complex and well conceived.  And overall this is a very wholesome series.  Some of the characters mature and some don't, just as in real life.
There are many teaching about the four elements - fire, earth, air and water - as well as the continuity of life through incarnations.  The martial arts portrayed are based on real Chinese styles, each tailored according to the element of its practitioner.
After the Last Airbender comes the Legend of Korra, Aang's next incarnation.  I just couldn't stop watching!  Hope there will be more.
Some of the characters have mastery of one of the elements; these are called the ""benders.""  The avatar, however, can use all four elements, but must still learn their deeper qualities in order to practice them effectively.",1392681600,,1347,4.717948717948718

8112876,5,B000EQ5TU6,"If you get one, you have to get them all to understand the full meaning of the avatar.  My son loves the movies.  He has all of the collections thanks to Amazon.  The movies are quite entertaining.",1332720000,,197,4.27027027027027
8112877,4,B000EQ5TU6,"This is the 3rd volume of Book 1, and the plot thickens. I would have really have enjoyed it more in movie form.",1270598400,,112,3.9130434782608696
8112878,5,B000EQ5TU6,"With a time limit newly imposed on the Avatar's save-the-world-from-fiery-conquest goals, ""Avatar The Last Airbender - Book 1 Water, Vol. 3"" leaps back into loosely-entwined one-off stories. And the third volume further explores both the characters and the kingdoms at war -- the trio of kids encounter some moral ambiguity, terrorism, feuding, and the story of how Aang ended up frozen in an iceberg for a whole century.

Katara discovers an ancient waterbending scroll that some pirates stole from the North Pole -- and desperate to be able to tutor Aang, she steals it from THEM. Unfortunately, Prince Zuko is in the area (VERY reluctantly looking for a new lotus tile for his uncle), and he joins forces with the pirates to capture the Avatar.

Then the gang encounters a young outlaw named Jet and his band of teenage warriors, who are striking out against the Fire Nation. Katara is swept away by Jet, but Sokka is dubious about him and his fanatical hatred of the Fire Nation people... ALL of them. And when the kids arrive at the Great Divide (think the Grand Canyon with insectile monsters), they end up in the middle of a feud between two rival clans who have hated one another for a whole century. Aang tries to mediate them as they go through the Divide, but old grudges die hard.

Finally, a massive storm hits the town where Sokka is working for a fisherman, bringing back memories of Aang's past. Guilt-ridden, he tells Katara about his early life as the Avatar, about the separation from his kindly father figure, and why he ended up in the iceberg. In the meantime, Zuko's abrasive manner starts rubbing his crew the wrong way, but then Iroh tells them the terrible reason why he's so obsessed with capturing the Avatar.

Despite mostly not addressing the big new arc revelations, ""Avatar The Last Airbender - Book 1 Water, Vol. 3"" starts dipping into remarkably mature waters for a show aimed at kids -- you've got terrorism, long-running feuds, running away from home, and a truly nasty scene where it's shown how Zuko got that big burn scar. Thankfully the writers avoid the typical preachy attitudes you find in most kids' TV; instead, they just let the conflicts unfold pretty naturally.

All four episodes are solidly written standalone stories, with plenty of dangers (pirates! bug-monsters! hurricanes!), solid fight scenes (a double hijacking), and a hefty dose of humor (""He's a gigantic fluffy monster with an arrow on his head! It's kinda hard to miss him!""). Each of them moves along at a brisk pace (although ""Jet"" is a bit slower than most) and has some spectacular moments speckled throughout -- breaking dams, waterfalls, and that whole eye-of-the-storm scene.

And courtesy of the last episode, Aang and Zuko get a lot of development -- Aang's carefree childhood was abruptly being turned into all-Avatar-all-the-time, and he hides quite a bit of guilt over his past actions. And we see how Zuko became the grim, scarred, Avatar-obsessed outcast he is today, due to a minor discourtesy that blossomed into a disastrous fight with his own father. Yet we also see that he does care about his crew, even if he doesn't always act like it.

This isn't a very good volume for Katara, since her brain apparently implodes for two whole episodes. But though Sokka doesn't display any massive personal growth, he also gets to show that he's more than comic relief -- he has some solid intuition and rock-hard morals, even towards the Fire Nation civilians.

""Avatar The Last Airbender - Book 1 Water, Vol. 3"" is a nice solid foursome of standalone episodes, fleshing out the characters and the greyer shades of their world. Definitely worth checking out.",1249084800,,3679,4.856459330143541
