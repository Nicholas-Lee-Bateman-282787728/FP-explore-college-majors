2322396,5,B0009UZG3W,"Wow! I can't begin to tell you how thrilled I was to get the movie Assassins, and then to find I could also get The Specialist with it, was a bonus. Both are excellent action movies.
Well, I was so anxious to get them both. And I did, promptly and in excellent condition.
I thoroughly enjoyed them both.
This isn't the first time I found more than one movie in the same set.
Amazon is the best. How can I ever thank you!

2322397,5,B0009UZG3W,"I love these movies.  They're pure grade B, and absolutely marvelous.  Sly blows everything possible up as the Specialist, and seduces/is seduced by the very sexy voiced Sharon Stone.

James Woods villains it up like no other, and entertains massively as he looses his marbles, along with his yarbles ultimately.

Assassins...ohh Paradise found.  Seeing Antonio Banderas as the very nutso younger Assassin is a rare treat.  He has all the earmarks of a wild-eyed coked up freak, as he  determinedly tries to kill the antiquated (in his opinion) Mr. Stallone.  Stallone on the other hand manages everything with aplomb; the ultimate vision of cool.

These guys are great together.  These movies are great together.

Watch them for sheer entertainment and fun.  If you're looking for something to take seriously, you'll be ticked off and will write mean things about this set.  Go for the giggles, and the over-the-topness.",1226448000,,921,5.141891891891892
2322398,5,B0009UZG3W,"if you enjoy action flicks you have to buy this combo of stallone hits its hard to pick the best of the two but i lean towards the specialist because of sharon stone great acting job,",1200700800,,183,4.111111111111111
2322399,4,B0009UZG3W,I too prefer a letterbox (widescreen) transfer over a full screen one because the letterbox format is the way you see the movie in a theater. However unlike the widescreen movies of the 50's & 60's you don't lose any picture for fullscreen versions of recent (70's & after) movies. For the older movies they had to pan & scan the image to fit the screen and you lost part of the picture that way so you buy the letterbox version to get the full image. But today they just open up the matte meaning you see stuff at the top & bottom that you didn't see in the theater. Sure I bought this full screen disc. It was agood way to get two great movies for the one low price. Not all double movie (2 on one disc) sets are full screen. I've bought some (like The Fugitive/US Marshalls) where both movies were in letterbox format. Oh & for these sets they are flipper discs meaning one movie per side of the disc. A great way to get a pair of movies!!,1179446400,4,942,4.1530054644808745
2322400,4,B0009UZG3W,"For action movie fans, this is one of the best 2 discs DVD sets you can buy. Each of the 2 discs has the same movie on both sides: one for NTSC and one for Widescreen. Each of the movies has good picture and good digital sound. The films are full of action, drama, and romance. The DVD menus are incredible; each disc is like it's own single independent disc but this is a 2 discs DVD set. 2 into 1; you can't beat that.",1171238400,,420,3.9529411764705884

8066899,5,B0009UZG3W,I loved both of these films when I saw them years ago and getting both on a single DVD was a great deal. Stallone was better and less wooden than his more recent offerings and Antonio Banderas' performance was as enjoyable as The 13th warrior and more entertaining than Zorro or Desperado.,1431907200,,289,4.576923076923077

8066903,5,B0009UZG3W,Love these old action movies!! They just don't make them like they used to!! I'm always looking for DVD packs to buy and this was a deal for 2 great movies starring one of the best action stars of his generation!!,1389571200,,213,4.219512195121951
8066904,4,B0009UZG3W,"Ok,no special features,but you get 2 cool,fun movies.

Full screen complaints?..Listen,man,when you got pretty girls involved,you want full screen!
THINK GUYS,THINK!

I cannot express in words just how depressing it is to watch The Spy Who Shagged Me with Heather Graham's assets cropped off!!!You can only see it all on VHS!!!

This widescreen censorship should be optional,not mandatory!..Thank you cheap DVD bast-rds for your full screen preferences!..Google ""widescreen censorship""...128 results!!!I AM NOT ALONE!I AM NOT ALONE!",1349395200,,532,5.973684210526316
8066905,5,B0009UZG3W,"I first watched part of this movie on Youtube, downloaded a few clips mainly because I was on the search for James Woods movies. I happened across a scene where James portrays an ex-CIA Explosive Expert named Ned Trent, who is a bit hot under the weather, and also seems to react with his anger like he has a fire up in his ass. As always, James is very intense in this movie; there was a time or two where my mouth just dropped in awe, because I was so impressed. He's very intense, as I said, and very amusing, in a way that you just have to yell, ""HEll YES!"" His delivery is great, making Ned Trent almost meticulous and you know with every start of a rant, James has a point in the end.

Though Sylvester Stallone gives quite the performance on his own, I think Sharon stone aided him. She is very beautiful, and he is very handsome. The two were a great duo in this game of cat and mouse. Sharone stone stars as a woman named May who is out looking for a way of getting back at the people who ruined her life. With Stallone's character, Ray, who is an explosive specialist, this can be done.

I rate this movie five stars, mainly because of James' acting. I had hesitated placing it with five stars, mainly because it must deserve four. In my opinion, Sharon Stone and Stallone had one too many love scenes, and one of them seemed completely unnecessary.

Over all, this movie is great. Note, if the viewer has a problem with profanity, they may want to take a rain check.",1336348800,,1477,4.267857142857143
8066906,4,B0009UZG3W,"Unlike the other available version of ASSASSINS / THE SPECIALIST (which is full screen only), the twin-DVD set labelled: ACTION DOUBLE FEATURE consists of flip discs that offer both movies in full or widescreen format. THE SPECIALIST also includes its theatrical trailer. There's no other extras on the discs, which automatically start playing the films when they're inserted.

Clean transfers here. Definitely a good deal, especially for Stallone action movie fans.
