If I recall, they come to the conclusion that the animal captured on camera was something other than a Bigfoot, some kind of new species all-together.  And that it was female and a few other anecdotes to make a convincing case that the footage was authentic.  But based on the ""lips"" found on this animal and the lips that are supposed to found on Sasquatch in general (from film clips, magazines, photos) I disagree and tend to think this thing is real.",1416096000,2,559,4.46078431372549
8290630,1,B001D09P98,Simply M.C Davis speaking about the Patterson film. No information on the film itself other than a momentary reference to one snapshot. Don't bother......,1309392000,4,154,5.458333333333333
8290631,1,B001D09P98,"Pareidolia:

 the imagined perception of a pattern or meaning where it does not actually exist, as in considering the moon to have human features.

Apophenia:

 the experience of seeing meaningful patterns or connections in random or meaningless data.

These two definitions clearly describe the path that MK Davis sets foot on in this DVD, as his mind slowly spirals out of control.

The author MK Davis takes an indepth look into the famous Patterson film and concocts a story about a giant indian woman from China running across the California landscape with braids in her hair and other absurdities by blowing up the blurry images and creating objects out of pixels and color shapes. If it supports his theory then he'll surely find it hidden in a photo somewhere.

This DVD was only the beginning for Davis. He later went on to concoct a whole ""Bigfoot Massacre"" theory out of these same images, believing there was a whole family of these sasquatch on that day which were all massacred and skinned of their hides. Yes he got all of this from the same little shaky 30-second film that we all know.

It's amazing how a person's imagination could come completely unhinged like this, but I'm sure it won't be the last we hear from Davis before he's fitted for a white jacket.",1285718400,5,1277,4.716216216216216
8290632,5,B001D09P98,"Thank you for the DVD. These creature's certainly are not anyone's imagination as common knowledge goes, but they are as elusive as believers know because they have the ability to dematerialize and rematerialize. Their large hairy bodies may not indicate advancement to this degree, but these are evolved souls, actually from another civilization who where brought here and became trapped in this third density existence, however, they have retained much of their original intelligence and spiritual clarity. The biblical ""Goliath"" was of this race when a small population lived in that area. Their bodies mutated  from hairless physiques to virtually a fur coat for more comfortable endurance in the elements, as well as camouflage in the forests where ages ago they retreated for safety and where they live in harmony with nature. Because of their DNA, which differs from humans insofar as programmed aging (the rearranging of the humans DNA for controllability) they have a longer life span than humans, but they do not reproduce very often and the original Earth population of relatively few souls has remained nearly the same. By nature they are gentle because they are consciously evolved comparied to the Earth human being, and with respect are very wary of the Earth human creature and if they feel threatened, they can be ferocious because the survival of their race is at stake. Unfortunately, the Earth human creature must first evolve himself spiritually and consciously to know that he is not separate from anything in existence, respecting all of life. Currently, he does not display this, and his creators wanted something else, thus we have a planet that is completely separate from itself in every aspect, and quite frankly, generates much fear. But, I can tell you that this is soon changing, and that is certainly why the Sasquatch have continued to reincarnate into this existence here on Earth, because this race has long known that a Golden age would arrive on this planet, for whom they feel deep love and affinity, and then they would live amoung the rest of the enlightened people. And they love family life, so the same souls keep returning.

  This concerns the Earth human race. We have here yellow, red, white, brown and black human beings. On the Earth these races do exist, however, not only these five colored races, but also others completely unknown to most of us. They partly live in places where still no human being has found them. Places like under the earth, domes in inaccessible regions, mountains or chains of mountains, about which mythical things are told. These races also come to the surface, the world of the sun, and join into the crowd, like in countries with many sorts of races, where they do not stand out and can move unburdened, especially when they cover their faces like it is common in some countries (India, etc.). This is however more difficult when their face color is more striking, for example bluish, etc..

  Some colored races have already died out since a long time ago. According to the climate, skin coloring developed itself, and of which there are innumerable colors all over the universe. Also the body sizes are different because of the different gravity of each planet and ranges from only 50 centimeters to even some meters tall. There were, and still are, creatures which we would term giants, or titans, and also these creatures lived once on earth. They also left descendants here, but they were eradicated in time because they were often evil-minded and tyrannical. The present day different colored races are thus decedents of the different colored ancestors, who came from different stars.

  So then the human being was not basically created here on Earth, and he does not descend from a monkey. He was created by ancestors, who mixed themselves with Earth human creatures, who at the time were called ""evas"". A designation, which means nothing else other than the bearing one, or bearer.

 The question has been asked about the theory that the monkey could be the origin of the human being, that the human being is a descendant of the monkey. Also that certain monkey-like creatures, which are also called ape-humans, snow-men, bigfoot, etc., which have been seen many, many times, is of course doubted by ""scientists"". The human form you should know accords to a special act of creation, and in consequence is unable to degenerate (go backwards) by any natural or unnatural metamorphical process. The ape-humans are not akin to human being creatures, in the meaning of real relationship. They are very similar to human beings in their concerns, but they are merely a faunic (animal) creature whose origin traces back to the flora-world (plant world). They are indeed the highest developed animalistic forms of this sort on the Earth, at least up to the present time.

  Yes, this means that still other animal as well as plant forms will develop that high. This is because it is a condition of evolution, according to the development of the planet itself. But this will take at least another million years.

  The earthly creatures were of different forms and characters. They were partly fully savage creatures of human-like form, who were sent out at earlier millenniums by our ancestors, and were by this their descendants. These descendants of the outsent ones copulated with different sorts of animals, and created new living creatures. One such is the still today known monkey creature which represents a human-animal mutation. So it is correct that the monkey creature descends from the human being and not the reverse. Intermediate mutations between human and monkey have already been found by your researchers and scientists but mostly as skeletons or parts of skeletons. There are as well other skeletons not of human or monkey descent that have been found and reconstructed but were immediately confiscated and destroyed, or the bones were used in other skeletons. These other intermediate mutations, partly human being/partly monkey, are known to the human being under names like ""Africanus"", ""Peking man"" and ""Neanderthals"". Four different kinds of these have maintained themselves over all past millenniums, and their descendants do still live today, yet no more in large groups, but only isolated or in very small groups. They are so wild and timid that the human being will seldom see those. The human being has expressed a special name for them: Yeti... The evas were nothing less than very savage descendants of the thousands of years ago outsent ones who had then become deprived of means of assistance. They were like wild animals who lived in greater groups. When our ancestors finally settled on the Earth, they broke a strict law and used force on these creatures. This means they captured the wild, though attractive, female beings and coupled with them. From that arose the first forefathers of the present human beings of Earth. One class was called ""Adam"" in the old ancestors language, which means ""Earth man being"". For the first one this term remained as a name, and is still so used today. But as our forefathers were of mixed races and different colors and sizes, so they also generated their different characteristics accordingly - colored races of different sizes. The smallest were just 50 centimeters tall, while the largest and most wicked ones reached twelve meters. Their looks were also different, and some sorts of them looked little like human forms. They were left to die out, or were killed, when they became too evil-minded, but some found their way to distant isolated places and lived for many thousands of years, because their average age was 15,000 years. By the time they too became victims of time or human beings, the last of them, whose life was taken by force, died a bit more than 2,300 years ago. Today live, according to our knowledge, there are still seven such creatures on Earth, where they keep themselves so well hidden that they will never be found, and will one day die a natural death. More frequently then, these giants we called titans and cyclops, were just tall men. They often served important might-thirsty kings. They were called ""Goliaths"" and were especially used in wars.",1249862400,2,8229,4.981063364894392
