8279765,4,B001AUKUXG,Challenging.  Portions can be done by beginner and grow into the full routine.  My trainer thought it was very good.,1380758400,,116,4.75
8279766,4,B001AUKUXG,"For me, this DVD was between okay and I liked it.  The yoga form was spot on and I think that is very important.

But the video was more sport like than yoga.  I would have liked to see more core work, tennis elbow prevention type yoga and back flexibility thru the shoulder work. I could think of several poses to incorporate that weren't there.  I did like the beginning which reminded me of a touch of Kundalini yoga to warm up. The video overall was a decent one but not one that I thought that was really yoga like. If I had seen it before I purchased it, I probably would not have bought it.  I teach yoga and am learning tennis and was really looking for a yoga DVD that would have more preventative type yoga for tennis injuries.

It was a good overall sport yoga DVD but not what I was looking for.",1302480000,3,807,4.141025641025641
8279767,5,B001AUKUXG,"My chiropractor challenged me to get into yoga to help my tennis after some minor back and neck problems (I am age 50).  I wasn't familiar with yoga and this was my second experience with yoga on DVD (first was a basic beginners yoga DVD).  I could feel the difference in my body immediately.  Asad presents the moves well for a beginner like me and teaches you how to move from one position to another. So the video flows very well.  It isn't too long and after the workout I feel refreshed not worn out.  If you are looking for a DVD to help with your tennis game, look no further...",1288742400,,585,4.2342342342342345
8279768,5,B001AUKUXG,"Hi,
i recently picked up my raquet after an 8 month break due to a tennis elbow. After a couple of hours training i decided my body needed a little bit extra to spice up my on-court movements, so i thought what about doing some yoga. I started using this video, a couple of times a week, as a part of my weekly fitness routine, and boy it paid off. Not only do i move better, i've gained a 100% improvement when it comes to flexibility and legwork, my back is both stronger and relaxed at the same time, the only thing which irritates me is, that i didn't bought this dvd earlier. Highly recommend it. It's easy to follow, great for beginners at yoga such as myself, and as a bonus you feel great afterwards. After i used this dvd two times people around me began to ask me what i've been doing lately,that is to me a clear proof of the benefits of this dvd. So what are you waiting for?",1240531200,5,887,4.132947976878612
8279769,5,B001AUKUXG,"I am an avid tennis player, and do a little bit of yoga/stretching when I think of it.  This has got me hooked on really working different parts of my body. It's helped me feel alot quicker on the court, and I feel like I can go for all everything--that I'm not going to blow out a calf muscle.  Its also great for loosening up my shoulders and upper back. Really, really good program, even if you just take away a few of the exercises to do on your own.",1226448000,5,454,4.033333333333333
8279770,4,B001AUKUXG,"I haven't purchased the DVD yet, but am looking forward to seeing it for the first time. I am a student of Billy Asad, and like his classes this should be a great addition to anyone's yoga training library!",1221523200,,206,4.3076923076923075
8279771,5,B001AUKUXG,"I found this DVD to be great for loosening up my upper body and my hamstrings, which really helps my tennis game.  My wife gave it to me. I've never done yoga before but it feels really good.",1219449600,5,191,4.026315789473684
