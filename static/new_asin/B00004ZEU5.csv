1384278,3,B00004ZEU5,"I bought this collection one set at a time as they became available and have not regretted it a bit. The only regret I have is that they didn't make more than 45 episodes. My advise is buy the set and enjoy. (nudge, nudge, wink, wink - you know what I mean. He said with a knowing grin)",972864000,10,286,3.9482758620689653
1384279,5,B00004ZEU5,"This collection of 7 sets (14 DVDs total) of Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes (#1-45) is a must for any fan of Python, or British humor in general!  It will keep you rolling in the aisles for years!  It includes ALL the classic episodes and skits (Nudge, nudge, wink, wink...  The parrot sketch, The Spanish Inquisition, Marriage Councelor, Spam, and ALL the rest in a beautifully restored digital format.  It also includes outtakes from their later live performances, behind the scenes info, trivia, special programs for computers with DVD drives, and more!  I can't recommend this enough!  Plus, since you're getting all the sets in one bundle, you can save a bunch of money.  Rediscover how all the episodes are so cleverly interwoven with the theme of the evening (How not to be seen, etc.), and brilliantly come full circle by the end of the episode.  I have every Python CD and DVD made, and couldn't survive without this set!  Buy it, watch them often, and enjoy!",970617600,125,975,4.790419161676646
1384300,4,B00004ZEU5,A very enjoyable series.,1492819200,,24,5.25
1384301,5,B00004ZEU5,"OK, if you are not a fan, quit reading now.  Otherwise buy this and take the voyage.  Included is the complete series and two discs of extra material, live shows, and some rarities. For the most part the episodes are well presented on disc, generally high quality in color and sound, and hold up well even on my newer, larger television. Remember, I first watched the show on an old RCA 19 inch cathode so sometimes I cringe at the low quality of the image on a 40"" Sony. But then you laugh so hard that you tear up so all is forgiven. This is a rarity for a British series to last this many episodes and by season four you can tell the Pythons are beginning to tire of the show and the skits are beginning to flag a bit. But even at it's worst it is much better than most of what passes for humor on television over on this side of the pond. What is lacking is any kind of informative booklet to educate the new watcher on what they are about to experience. Truly designed for the fan who wishes to binge watch a truly ground breaking series. If you really want to know what the Pythons were all about may I suggest you also purchase at least the following books. ""The first 280 years of Monty Python"", Kim ""Howard"" Johnson, St. Martin's Griffin Press., and for the true fan, ""The Pythons"", autobiography by the Pythons, St. Martin's Press Thomas Dunne Books.  There are many other titles but these will really enlighten you on the complete Python experience.  Also check out the Python members other works as solo or with various cast members such as ""Fawlty Towers"", ""Ripping Yarns"", to name a few. Then there are the movies. The pure Python moves such as ""Holy Grail"", ""Meaning of Life"", ""Life of Brian"", are consistently great. Some of the ancillary projects like ""Yellowbeard"", ""Jabberwocky"", and others, not so great, but you decide. Most John Cleese films were good as are many of Terry Gilliams efforts, though spotty.  Still, a great time can be had by all.  Get your silly on.",1491955200,4,1987,4.460055096418733

1384333,4,B00004ZEU5,"I was never intending to buy all of Monty Python's shows but I'm always looking for a great deal and I couldn't pass this one up. The entire TV series on 14 DVD's plus 2 bonus DVD's (collectively known as Monty Python LIVE) on sale for $60, taxes and shipping included. That amounts to $3.75 per DVD.

I like some Python and was already considering just the LIVE set, but that would have been about $30, meaning I got the entire 14 DVD series for about $30, taxes and shipping included. It was a no brainer. Besides, no matter which Python collection or ""best of"" DVD you get, you're always going to be missing at least a few great sketches.

In my rating I took off one star because of the grainy 1970's film quality, it's not remastered.

Ultimately it's about good value... For the price, you get many, many hours of Python humour, which is very silly but often very clever, and always original.",1456617600,,898,4.430303030303031

1384351,5,B00004ZEU5,"We interrupt the Internet Movie Database because it's gotten too silly! I've noticed a tendency for the IMDb to get rather silly. Now I do my best to keep things moving along, but I'm not having things getting silly. So, we present to you this expos on the greatest comedy sketch show of all time! In it you will see: mosquito and ant safari hunters, the funniest joke ever written in which people die laughing and later used to attack the Germans during WWII, mountain climbers that see double, ""The Institute of Silly Walks"", hospitals that treat their patients like soldiers in boot camp, a world in which everyone is dressed like Superman except for the greatest hero ""Bicycle Repairman"", and of course the Spanish Inquisition that shows up when least expected! And like the existence of God, Monty Python was, is and ever shall be the Messiah of television comedy. All must genuflect at the altar of John Cleese's desk when he finishes his phone conversation at the beach and says ""And now for something completely different.""

Sketch comedy shows on television existed long before Monty Python. In the US, the early sketch comedy shows, like ""The Milton Berle Show"", ""The Caesar Hour"" and ""Your Show of Shows"" were essentially vaudeville acts that were broadcast nation-wide, and often upon a stage. However, Monty Python may have been the earliest of the sketch comedy shows to utilize the fact that it was being broadcast on television which pushed sketch comedy out of the constraints of the fading sensibility of Sid Caesar and Ed Sullivan.

In addition to their sketches which were filmed like little movies rather than on stages (and probably were not improvised), Monty Python's Flying Circus is filled with fake news broadcasts, fake commercial interruptions, spliced sequences of stock footage, and of course, the outrageously irreverent cartoons that spoofed the great art of Europe and created a surrealist python world where portraits of distinguished old men eat up the Venus de Milo -- whole! Monty Python spoofed everything, from their own BBC News, World War II to Queen Victoria who is shown in one sketch walking into a poetry reading with the coffin containing the remains of her husband saying ""My late husband and me...""

Almost every zany aspect of modern society were taken prisoner and held in custody by the Pythons, including courtrooms, shopping malls, and even little old ladies who have decided to form violent street gangs! And of course the French and the Scots seem to get a little more airtime than other groups! And the final aspect I will relate is that most of these zany sketches were presented with absolutely straight faces as if the actors were seriously engaged in their ludicrous exploits. There is very little I can add about Monty Python that hasn't already been said, except, that if you have never seen it, it is almost impossible to describe. So, for God's sake, see it! We now return you to the Internet Movie Database with its regularly scheduled programming.",1440374400,,3014,4.917485265225933

1384357,1,B00004ZEU5,"As a previous reviewer mentioned, the DVDs in this box set were horribly prone to glitching all over the place. The set I owned was to the point where every disc was unwatchable because they would all freeze. As they said, the menus also sucked. The DVD case inserts were of such poor quality that I thought the problem was that someone was trying to pass off an illegal copy they'd knocked up in someone's basement. Altogether disappointing, but at least I had enough disposable income way back then that it didn't matter much. I no longer own these, so I can't give a more detailed description of whether *every* episode glitched, but I do know that the first one on each DVD glitched.",1433721600,,687,4.548387096774194

But unfortunately as of April 2015 we have a set that ...
1. Has numerous edits made by either the BBC or A&E (depending on who's story you believe)
2. Is apparently out of print as the price for a set is now well over $300.

Note that a similar set is sold on the Amazon UK site for about 13 pounds ($25 or so, depending on the exchange rate).  Only issue is it's a Region 2 disc not playable on standard US CD player (but I suspect buying a multi-region player and this set will still cost far less than a $350 US Region 1 set).

minutes' worth of Pthonity, the real problem with Python is the uneveness of the comedy.
Given, no comedy series is consistently at the top of its game, but Python was always
near the bottom of its game - most of their  sketches fall flatter than a pancake. This seems to
be a trait of British humor in general. For Python, I would recommend only bothering with their
 best-loved  sketches (which are small in number) - download them from youtube for free, where you
can be  certain of not overpaying. I really enjoy their best sketches, mind you, but cannot in
good conscience recommend spending this kind of money (and shelf space) on this set of DVDs.

From the comments of some other reviewers it is apparent that a few bits of dialogue have been altered or dropped. As can be seen from consulting these reviews, these changes are minor and do little to nothing to significantly alter the sketches in which they occur. The truth is that before acquiring this DVD set I was at the mercy of PBS to watch whatever episode PBS wanted me to watch on a given evening. No longer.

Whether it's learning to defend yourself against fruit, whether you're comparing your awful childhoods with your closest friends or whether you're debating on returning that suspicious looking dead parrot back to the shop - this is one of the best examples of comedy in the entire world.

The video quality is good and the DVD's run well.
I'm too young to have known Monty Python while it was on the air, so I first experienced it through the movies and Netflix. When it went off instant watch, I immediately went over to Amazon to buy it. I was lucky enough to happen upon it when it was $45, but in my opinion it was worth the $120 they originally sold the whole collection for.

1384510,1,B00004ZEU5,"Assume for a moment that you were a devout Christian approached by someone selling an ""abridged"" version of the Holy Bible.  Would you buy it?  I thought not.

To the die-hard fan, the Monty Python's Flying Circus TV series is a different kind of ""religious"" experience.  And to appreciate it, it must be presented in an unabridged (as it really was) fashion.  This is one of those times (and there have been many) when I'm so glad I sprung for the few extra dollars it cost me to buy a ""region-free"" DVD player.  Why?  Because the A&E version of this series has been abridged to remove some of what the Pythons would refer to as ""naughty bits.""  Not so with the Sony Pictures version of this series sold in the U.K.  In fact, for just a few more dollars than this ""series only"" set, you can buy the ""Almost Everything Box Set"" from Amazon.co.uk.  It includes the unabridged version of the series, all 4 films, and their ""Live at the Hollywood Bowl"" performance.

This is what I'm about to buy.  And I leave you with one final recommendation.  If you intend to buy another DVD player, buy one that is either ""region-free"" or can be programmed to be region-free.  Sometimes, buying entertainment from U.S. sources is either more expensive or less true to the original version.  FWIW, I also have the U.K. version of Kubrick's film, ""Eyes Wide Shut.""  The U.S. version of the same film, like this A&E Python set, doesn't include the ""naughty bits.""

1384519,1,B00004ZEU5,"Well, you know what they say, ""You don't miss what you've never had."" That's so true. I thought this was a great set, and I gave it three stars, only because of video and audio quality. Until I dug a little deeper and found quite a few key pieces missing. To see exactly what's missing, look here:
[...]

For the most part, the video quality is ... OK... Livable... but on several of the DVDs the quality is grainy. As if some DVDs had greater compression than others. I'm getting pretty sick of over compressed and poor quality video DVDs.

Two episodes had, for lack of a better word, ""jumps"" in them. For example, in 'Biggles Dictates A Letter', Biggle is repromanding his secretary for calling him ""Seor Biggles"". He proclaims, ""Don't call me seor! I'm not a Spanish person. You must call me Mr Biggles, or Group Captain Biggles or Mary Biggles if I'm dressed as my wife, but never seor."" but in this DVD it jumps, ""Don't call me seor! I'm not......ary Biggles if I'm dressed as my wife, but never seor."" I've written A&E asking for replacements but never get a reply.

On three of the DVDs, the 'PLAY ALL' feature doesn't cue properly and skips the middle episodes. One must go into the main menu and play the individual episode.

These DVDs do have subtitles, which is good, because many of the A&E releases don't include subs. A&E needs to address this problem. Although many of the subtitles were just plain incorrect, these subtitles DID make this set much more understandable to the ear.

None the less, A&E is a far cry from the company it was in the 80s. Stop over compressing the video. Stop cropping the frames. Stop leaving out subtitles. Stop advertising a product as having ""every single skit"" (if it doesn't) and START producing quality DVDs worth watching. More QA ! If need be, charge the extra $10, or whatever, and do it correctly. They will STILL sell.",1325548800,6,1875,4.568452380952381
1384520,5,B00004ZEU5,"In the face of the adversity, the British people have always responded with that sarcastic and corrosive humor so typical from them. First and foremost the dazzling Charlot - who became the humor, genuine poetry and covered more than a half century- - and then, since those times of the blossoming of the British Humor during the aftermath of the end of the WW2. Films such as the adaptation of Pygmalion, Kind hearts and cornets, The legendary adaptation of The importance of being Ernest, The man in the white suit, Hobson's choice, The Lavender Hill Mob, The Lady Killers or The mouse that roared.

The British humor was - during the sixties - in a state of hibernation until the arrival of Monthy Phyton, a bunch of creative actors, screenplayers who eventually became future filmmakers that decided to bet and risk for making these corrosive episodes giving the best of themselves in which innovation, relentless irreverency for everything coated of solemnity, authority and a the self-criticism, wiping out all kind of formal conventions, as well a scathing critique of the enforcement of economic and social policies of the Governement, without leaving aside some customs deeply rooted within the social body of the nation.

Sardonic, irreverent and imbuided of the marvelous freshness of the brevity and delirious creativeness, Monthy Phyton established a standard in which concerns the most ambitious explosion of humor in the second half of the XX Century.

It's such its impact that it's necessary to watch the whole saga in order to appreciate much better legendary films such as Monthy Phyton's Holy Grial, The life of Brian, The sense of life, Brazil as well as films visibly influenced such as Consuming passions, How to get ahead an advertising or The wolf man in London.

1384533,5,B00004ZEU5,"Monty Python delivers the culmination of British humor of the late '50s and mid to late '60s. Hilarious, erudite, transvestite and a lot of other ""ites"" and adjectives I've not thought of ... they've got it all. Vaudevillian influences are present in the slapstick and sketch comedy aspects which, combined with Terry Gilliam's artwork, presents the viewer with a cascading barrage of capital ""F"" funny.

Monty Python was hilarious in the late '60s--early '70s, and it is just as funny today. A gangly Englishman in a bowler hat walking funny is just as insane now as it was then. A dead parrot remains dead, but is funny nonetheless. Men in drag shouting lines in falsetto still kills, and Carol Cleveland was a perfect compliment to the male Pythons. If you don't like the Pythons, or simply refuse to watch anything so ""British,"" then perhaps I could interest you in a Parrot ....",1305763200,,883,4.809210526315789

They are almost laying on top of each other, 2 to a page, with each page barely thick enough to hold the discs in, but it works.  Only one problem: the cover of the main 14 disc collection is upside down.  I couldn't get a message back to the seller to get a ""we'll replace it"" or ""sorry, keep it"" response.  It's a nit really, but I keep opening it upside down and I'd rather not.  The collection is truly enjoyable and my kids are getting an intro to Monty Python via the ""Personal Best"" discs and then selected shows.  (The shows obviously have some less than ""best"" skits.)  The price was very fair, in my opinion, for such a large number of discs, shows, and extras.  I never have to go anywhere else for anything Python (oh... except for my already complete collection of their movies).",1299024000,,905,4.377245508982036
1384537,5,B00004ZEU5,"This A&E reproduction of the outstanding original series is exquisitely crafted using nothing but the best ingredients to preserve the over all flavour of the shows broadcasted in the late 1960's and early 1970's. There are no trailers, and the menu is simple and effective.

The only draw back is the dvd format itself. Though it lends itself to book shelf status and they are easy to lend, in actual operation there are only 3 or 4 half hour shows per dvd. It would be nice if these shows would just drivel on endlessly without any effort required between dvds.

Regardless of the impending streaming option, I'll have this series on proud display until it is smashed up during the divorce :-)",1298332800,,695,4.688524590163935
1384538,5,B00004ZEU5,"I was not alive when this show was originally aired, but Monty Pythons iconic qualities have always stood out in my mind.  This complete set was a worthwhile purchase. It is very interesting to watch the series from the perspective of observing the artistic development of a legendary comedic style.  Many of the sketches are quite experimental in nature, and some are not funny at all (mostly within the first 3 seasons).  But as the group hones their craft through successive seasons, one can begin to appreciate and understand what makes Monty Python unique.  The laughs increase as the seasons continue.  A part of Monty Pythons style involves art, literary and historical references as well and I like the additional level of depth this adds to the overt sillyness of much of it. With regards to the more behavioral aspects of the collection, the DVD's boot up quick, there are no annoying previews or adverts, and the menus are easy to navigate. Some critics have complained about editing of a few choice moments, but I haven't noticed anything obvious and can only assume those that have are a level of enthusiasts bordering on fanatics.  It would also seem that any editing or missing footage is most likely due to the fact that the series is over 40 years old and transferring it to DVD just happens to involve some tough decisions sometimes.",1296000000,,1351,4.801724137931035

Having everything in one DVD set is great & for as much material as there is the packaging is streamlined and compact.

I don't have to sell this to Python fans on merit, we know who we are and we know why the show is great! This is not a series for the conservative, it is for those who are looking for something different and in-your-face that get bored with toilet humor or comedy being dumbed down to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Flying Circus is smart and funny and impolite. It will offend you if you are a prude and confuse you if you are an idiot.

The 5 minute.

Oh, sorry about that.  Well, let's get on with it.  A major thrill of my adolescent life was to turn to PBS and watch that great BBC import, ""Monty Python's Flying Circus.""  You actualy got to see the occasional bit of real boobie!  Hey!  When you're 13 you live for those cheap thrills.  But I missed so many of the episodes that when I had the chance to get the whole series on DVD, I snatched it up.  It's all there, every last bit.  The last season is considerably less memorable than the early seasons.  It seems that the steam had run out for the gang.

As I expected, the DVD reproduction is fine.  Also to be expected, there are extras with each DVD and those all hold either 3 or 4 episodes of the show per disk.  Also, as I expected, there are a lot of bits of trivia on the disk.  But I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition.

The episodes did require me to make an adjustment to the time period in which they were made, but after acclimating to the time period, I enjoyed the episodes once again.  The Lumberjack song, the dead parrot and other famous skits are still wonderful.  The whole series is terrific.  I enjoyed the extra DVDs of the concert movie Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl and the AFI tribute to the Pythons.  The set is huge but doesn't grow tedious to watch.  Wonderful!",1278633600,,553,4.48
1384554,5,B00004ZEU5,"Well, A&E has released the Flying Circus once again, hopefully for good this time, because it is outstanding. Every episode from the show's four year run is included here. Also in this set are two great new documentaries about the origins of Python and how they became known to America. The Personal Best, although redundant, as has been said before, are here for completion's sake. (My favorite introduction being Graham Chapman's, from one of the sketches: Good Lord, I'm on film!)
  Now, there are several issues I have with this set.
1) Only three episodes a disc? Really? Dual layer discs nowadays can hold about six, maybe even seven of these episodes (all thirty minutes.) I have a suspicion that they were spread out like this on purpose to increase the number of discs, and therefore, run up the price.
2) The picture, although as good as is available on the Python market today, is abysmal. Every pop, scratch, and dust streak is crystal clear here. It looks as though you were watching the show through a dirty sheet of wax paper. Some episodes are better than others. It depends, really. You can see the show, but the grit is quite noticeable.
  Other than those, the set is magnificent. The complete show, documentaries, live performances, the one German episode, and the Personal Bests all in one compact, beautifully packaged box with a lid to seal it off. Amazing!",1277596800,3,1380,4.785714285714286

1384562,5,B00004ZEU5,"Occasionally incredible things happen in comedy. Monty Python is one of these events. At first the humor is in the wonderful parodying of situations that we tend to take for granted, or of situations we know to be undesirable, but (like the weather) have become a British way of life. However, as the series progress, the humor also develops and evolves, with parodies of parodies and references to references. I particularly like the way that academia also becomes the brunt of some sketches, as coal miners argue about the Treaty of Utrecht and the life of Tchaikovsky is examined in the Farming Today program. Politicians also come under the hammer, but even then, everything is a surprise, with potential amazing political discussions turning into quiz shows about football, etc.

It doesn't take much to recommend this set. It is an amazing document recording history and comedy in the early 1970s.",1265932800,,903,5.02

1384566,4,B00004ZEU5,"I recently purchased the entire Monty Python 16-Disc set. Here is my review of that product:

While the contents of this package are quite good and bits of it even moderately funny, I was especially entranced by the fine packaging, which although likely created by marketers and not the performers themselves, still contains quite a bit of humor and imagination. I especially enjoyed the (and I quote) ""bright green sticker which likely covers otherwise informative and humorous parts of the original box"". My only regret is that the sticker was quite firmly sealed to the cellophane packaging and could not be removed. This prevented re-usage in imaginative ways. Perhaps the solution to this would have been to include additional stickers within the box itself, containing such phrases as ""He's not dead, he's pining for the fjords"".

I suspect I'm expected to say something about the DVDs themselves, regarding their quality, enjoyability, etc. Very well. The DVDs are somewhat roundish and thin, made of a respectable quality plastic, and do quite well as mirrors in cases of such need. They are each individually encased in equally fine plastic boxes, which can serve as coasters while you are watching the tellies. I'm not sure what the plot is about, as the individual segments tend to be somewhat confusing and rather silly. But aside from that, an excellent product overall, especially when purchased at reduced price.

My biggest disappointment is that in all sixteen discs containing far more hours of television than anyone should really have time to watch, I never did see that Monty Python chap. Must have been the director or producer or writer or other such nonsense. Probably camera-phobic I would guess. You'd think the bloke could have at least taken a bow once in a while.

No matter. Despite this oversight, I think the set well worth the purchase price and once watched, contains sufficient mass to be a perfectly good paperweight or doorstop, insuring its continued value over time. Plus, one can always re-read the box and enjoy continued chuckles until dying of something dreadful.",1265587200,2,2106,5.060518731988473

1384583,4,B00004ZEU5,"If you're like me, and most (or all) of your past exposure to Python has consisted of watching their films several times, then the experience of the Python TV series might puzzle you a bit. This is not to say that you'll be disappointed, but rather that your (mostly American) expectations of some brand of NARRATIVE-driven comedy will be challenged. In the end, this is a good thing- and precisely the type of comedic revolution I imagine the troupe was shooting for when they conceived and wrote the shows.

As an American, I too was in love with the comfortable narratives that 99% of visual comedy subscribe to. Though the Python films follow some sort of loose narratives in their films, the TV series throws all of this conventional grammar out the window. If you are looking for Simpsons-esque punchlines or the predictable situations of Seinfeld, look elsewhere. However, if you want to experience ""Wuthering Heights in Semaphore"", this is your bag. Be forewarned: Getting used to this style of comedy is NOT easy, and you may spend the first several episodes in incredulous silence. Your brain will have to slowly acclimatize, but the pay off is worth it. If you're a fan of other Brit-comedy then you probably don't have to worry so much. But if your an interested neophyte, I would advise you to take the plunge.

My only real complaint is minor:  On the 2 bonus discs, one of the shows is ""Parrot Sketch Not Included"", which is a 20th anniversary tribute hosted by Steve Martin.  It's the last time Graham Chapman appeared with the cast before he died, and I wish they'd given him a better send off.  Not worth watching otherwise.

The real treats on the bonus discs, though, are the Fliegender Zirkus 1, made for German TV in 1971 with a good deal of original material, and Live at the Hollywood Bowl, which is Python uncensored and at their blue best (not safe for kids!).  Wish they had also included the Fliegender Zirkus 2, but they didn't.

1384593,4,B00004ZEU5,"I LOVE Monty Python---they are the true Kings Of Comedy, in my opinion. I've been a fan ever since I first saw their TV series on PBS when I was a kid back in the late-70's. The TV series, the movies, the albums....I've got 'em all. However, up until now, I only had the TV series on videocassette (taped off of MTV, of all networks!). But, with Python's 40th anniversary upon us (happy anniversary, lads!), I finally forked over the bucks for this, the ""16-Ton"" megaset of their show. Overall, this box set of ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" is a real treat. SO many great laughs, and, along with it, so many great memories for me. Sure, a few sketches misfire (the alien dessert--aka blancmonge--playing tennis...sorry, but it just doesn't work), but the Pythons scored so many more comic hits than misses (the ""Atilla The Hun"" episode, The Upper-Class Twit Of The Year Show, Scott Of The Antarctic, The Most Awful Family In Britain, and on and on and on). Also, this is the first time I've ever gotten to see the Python show *in the correct order*! How great it was for me to finally see how the Pythons evolved over the course of their four series of shows.

BUT---this is not the ""complete"" Python show, as they would have you believe on the outside of the box. For some unexplained reason, four episodes have a few bits missing or censored:

""It's The Arts""---the sketch about the composer with the frighteningly long name, ""Johann Gamboleputty...."". Eric Idle had a brief bit as an old man who dies halfway through saying Gamboleputty's full name. It's no longer there.

""Blood, Devastation, Death, War & Horror""---in the ""Bus Conductor"" sketch, Graham Chapman briefly sang a spoof version of ""Tonight"" from ""West Side Story"" (""Tonight, tonight, I'm getting p----d tonight!""). It's been cut. Maybe for legal reasons? Who knows.

""A Book At Bedtime""---there were opening captions prior to Terry Gilliam's opening title animation in this episode (""Tonight we start the show straight away with the opening titles.....No you didn't, you started with that caption....Oh yes.""), as well as a concluding sketch about upcoming British comedy TV shows (including ""Dad's Pooves"" and ""Up The Palace""). Both have been cut. Why?

""The All-England Summarize Proust Competition""---in the title sketch, Graham Chapman is censored from saying the word, ""masturbating"". Very silly.

So, this box set is the *Not Quite* Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus, which is disappointing, but I'll still take it. It's a comedy classic by a classic comedy troupe, easily the groundbreaking comedy equivalent of The Beatles. Thank you so much, Monty Python, for all of the great laughs.

1384604,5,B00004ZEU5,"Monty Python's Flying Circusss

Monty Python is generally pretty well known, but unfortunately most have only seen the movies- the Holy Grail, Life of Brian, etc.
The movies are great, but this is a Python you don't want to miss. If it hadn't been for ""MPFC,"" we wouldn't have Whicker's World, Mr. Neutron, and countless other eccentric characters. So the bottom line is, if you haven't seen it, you should.

As for the quality of the item... my expertise is sadly limited. The intro (TO THE DVD, NOT THE SHOWS) is somewhat forgettable. It would be nice to be able to skip it. As for the sound/video quality, I didn't see the original but I imagine it is about the same. No quality problems for me.

As for the extra bits, there are two bonus DVDs with four features: MP live at the Hollywood Bowl, MP Live At Aspen (not a performance but a very good interview), Parrot Sketch Not Included (quite good, hosted by Steve Martin), and Monty Python's Fliegender Zirgus: German Episode #1, which is a great extra feature.

So... you should buy it.",1239062400,,1042,4.586021505376344
1384605,5,B00004ZEU5,"You have to wonder just what A&E Home Video is trying to do to the fans of this show.  The complaints listed in other reviews are correct, have merit, and are dead on, but let's not get into that.  I, believe it or not, DIDN'T have any of the other boxed sets, so, throwing caution to the wind, I purchaed this one a while back. Due to my rather haphazard schedule, I'm just finishing this product and, for those who haven't bought any of the other collections, this is spot on!

It contains absolutely anything a ""Flying Circus"" fan could want, namely the historic series all in one place.  It's worth having even if you're NOT a fan of the Circus, because these guys pretty much defined absurdist comedy for a generation.  Some folks get it, others don't, but for us who do, and frequently quote sketches, it's a blast!

The bonus stuff is great stuff too, although I have to wonder what the point was of the ""Personal Best"" documentaries.  We already have the sketches on the other DVD's and have seen them on the telly.  They even somewhat sanitize and abrogate the classic bits they're repeating.  Granted, some of the characters they portrayed in the '70s, namely anything in blackface, can't be repeated in these PC times, but do we really have to shorten them by a few words?  The true fan likes them as they are.  The new docs are rather amusing and somewhat fill in details for those of us not already aware of them.  And, lastly, I rather liked the all-German episode and think it could play well even today on English-speaking television.

Again, repremands to A&E for trying to make us buy the same thing over and over (don't even get me started on ""World at War""), but credit for putting together a good package for those of us who don't have it all already.",1238630400,4,1772,4.482866043613707

1384607,4,B00004ZEU5,"The material on this set is actually 5 stars (great comedy here)....this is a review for the boxset itself.  This is a good set with 21 discs of Monty Python goodness....but it could have been great!  There are a few problems with this set:

1) It's not really complete! - Wheres the second German episode?  If they're gonna mention it's existence, they should include it - otherwise, it ain't complete.  If they don't have the master, I suggest that they start looking!  Also, where's 'Life Of Python'?  A&E has released this separately at one time, but it is no longer available.  They also show a clip of this in the extras but their failure to include the complete show here boggles the mind.  The omission of these 2 items really ticks me off.

2) The first 14 discs here appear to be the original discs from way back in the early days of DVD......I can't even use my remote to see the time remaining on the episodes as I watch them. Also, there are some glitches in the video master that A&E used...most notably in the 'Biggles dictates a letter' sketch.  Fortunately, it's not a disc problem but perhaps a remaster is in order here.

3) Yeah...the personal bests are somewhat redundant.  I think I've seen the 'fish-slapping dance' to the point of nauseum watching these.  However, they are still worth keeping as each of these discs do include new interviews(from the remaining pythons for Chapman's best) and new sketches by the individual pythons in their personal best episodes.

Other than the above, it is still a good set if you have yet to get Monty Python on DVD.  Also, I should note that the package is actually smaller than the 16-ton set consisting of the box you see with 2 DVD booklets inside.  The larger booklet consisting the original episodes on 14 discs with the second booklet holding the remaining 7 discs.  They are all in plastic trays (2 discs: 1 overlapping the other in each tray) and are all securely snug in the hubs....at least it was in the copy that Amazon sent my way.

If you want the most 'complete' collection currently out now, buy this set......but keep a lookout for 'Life Of Python' if you can find it and hope that A&E gets around to releasing that final German episode one day.",1230940800,3,2226,4.575757575757576
1384608,5,B00004ZEU5,"The movies were bought as a gift, so I'm not sure about the quality. But they arrived in a timely fashion and were packaged nicely. I'm very satisfied.",1230508800,,151,4.428571428571429
1384609,5,B00004ZEU5,"For those who are on the fence about this set, I have to say I highly recommend it.  Yes, most of the material has been released before, but the two new discs, along with the very compact new packaging, make this a must-have in my opinion.  Each of the two new documentaries are an hour long, but to me they felt like two hours each.  I don't mean that in a bad way... they are just chock-full of rare footage and new revelations, so I got more out of them than what you'd normally expect out of an hour-long DVD featurette.

Before The Flying Circus is completely black-and-white, but given that the bulk of the vintage film clips would be b&w themselves, leaving the new interviews in color would be rather jarring, since every five minutes or so it'd cut back to b&w film.  Python Conquers America is in full-color, which is just as appropriate, and watching both back-to-back (in chronological order) makes each seem stronger.  Terry Gilliam's quite detailed description of each of the four different title sequences appears on the ""Before The Flying Circus"" disc, as does the long-lost ""Political Choreographer"" sketch, both in full color.

For those like me who don't have time to watch every single disc before deciding whether to sell/trade their existing sets, I have checked the data size and creation date/time of each disc.  Apart from DVD 12, all of the 14 main discs are identical to the original Mega Set (including DVD 1 being listed as a ""fix"", which may have happened before the original set hit store shelves).  The data size for #12 is the same as the original one, but the creation date is from 2008 and for some reason the DVD-ROM content is missing.  That means the link to [...] won't work, but there doesn't seem to be any other alterations to the disc.

I did notice that the disc artwork lists the first episode as ""L. Henry Thripshaw's Disease"" rather than ""E. Henry..."" as it's supposed to be, but the menu on both versions simply calls it ""Henry Thripshaw's Disease"".  My best guess is that there was a very minor correction that needed to be made, whether in the navigation of the menus, a typo in someone's filmography or a wrong answer to a trivia question.  I'm fairly confident that there's no significant difference in the new #12, and whatever may have changed is probably an improvement.  The only potential worry would be if something was censored on the disc.  The opening sketch is the Tudor Job Agency, so I thought there may have been something in the background that needed to be blurred out (an underage model, obscene material, etc.), but I didn't notice anything like that.  It's possible that a word or two may have been dropped out of the audio track, but I've not had time to listen that carefully.

The contents of the two discs of Monty Python LIVE! are also identical to the originals at the data level, although the disc art has been updated a bit for this new set.  As for the Personal Best specials, the six episodes are now on 3 dual-layer (NOT double-sided) discs rather than six individual single-layer ones.  I did notice that each program is missing approximately 50MB of data as compared to the original DVDs, but the ""Holy Grail"" DVD trailer found on the individual ""Personal Best"" DVDs has been dropped, which could account for some of that.  All the extras seem to have been ported over.

All in all, even if you have one of the previous sets, I would recommend buying this set and selling off the old one(s), partially for the great new documentaries, but also because the packaging for this set is the best yet, and one of the nicest sets I've ever owned.  As has probably been mentioned elsewhere, the discs are in two separate fold-out ""Digibook"" packages.  One minor gripe is that each pair of discs overlap, meaning that to get one out, you often have to remove the one in front of it (they don't actually touch).  This is much better than some recent sets that put the discs in fragile cardboard pockets that could scratch them.

UPDATE: The two bonus discs are now being released on their own in a package called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monty-Python-The-Other-British-Invasion/dp/B002KGREF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monty Python: The Other British Invasion</a>, so anyone who has the original 14-disc set and Monty Python LIVE or the 16-Ton (and 16-disc) Megaset plus all the Personal Best DVDs in one form or another really no longer has a reason to buy this set unless they want the much more compact packaging.  I'm still glad I bought mine, but if the bonus discs had been released right away I probably would have kept what I had and just bought the two new discs.  I suppose that's why they waited... either that or it was never intended and they're only releasing them separately now due to public demand.

At any rate, the set is still well worth the money, but it now bears thinking about when all you really have to do is buy another 2-disc set.",1230336000,58,4981,4.740440324449595

1384617,5,B00004ZEU5,"""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" was created in 1969 by the BBC as Britain's response to ""Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In,"" the NBC show that was enjoying huge ratings at the time.  The Monty Python troupe consisted of Cambridge and Oxford graduates John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin.  American-born Terry Gilliam provided the show's surreal animated sequences, which were interspersed among the skits.
 ""The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus Collector's Edition"" is a massive, 21-disc box set containing every episode of the show's four-season run.  The series is uneven and has its share of misfires, but when the comedy lands, the skits are hilarious.  The ""Ministry of Silly Walks"" hangs on the long-legged Cleese's unbridled lunacy in high-stepping around the office, making methodical turns with precisely looney leg contortions and never skipping a beat delivering the dialogue.  The skit is slapstick performed magnificently, and it's hard not to break up watching it.
 ""The Cheese Shop"" also features Cleese, this time as a customer trying to order a bit of cheese from proprietor Jones only to be told, after requesting by name every type of cheese on the face of the earth, that it is either sold out, no longer available, not carried, or on order.  Watching Cleese go from mild annoyance to apoplexy is a riot.  Other highlights include the ""Dead Parrot,"" the lumberjack song, and ""The Spanish Inquisition.""
 The set also contains ""Monty Python Live,"" a collection bringing together nearly 30 years of live performances, including the vintage 1972 ""Live at the Hollywood Bowl,"" the 1998 reunion ""Live at Aspen, 20 Years of Python,"" and the original 1972 ""Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus #1"" rare German episode.  In addition, there are are six mini-documentaries in the ""Monty Python's Personal Best Collection,"" with songs and sketches from the entire series.  There are two new documentaries chronicling how the Monty Python team was born that feature interviews with the Pythons, rare vintage photos, and home movies.

 I wish A&E had used the original masters, or that the BBC would release its own set, especially with extended commentary etc., as other reviewers wish for.

1384625,4,B00004ZEU5,"Six comic delights -- five British guys, and one American. Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin.

These six guys created ""Monty Python's Flying Circus,"" a groundbreaking comedy series made of skits. They were sometimes gross, naughty, and always bizarre, and their bizarre humour has influenced everything from ""Saturday Night Live"" to Jasper Fforde. ""The Complete Monty Pythons Flying Circus - Collectors Edition Megaset"" brings together the entire series plus some extra performances, but pads it out substantially.

For dozens of episodes, these guys served up skits on every insane subject you can think of: defense against fresh fruit, the Ministry of Funny Walks, sitcoms based on the family life of Attila the Hun, spam, lupin bandit Dennis Moore, obscene children's books, semaphores, racing twits, spam, village idiots, goats, psychotic barbers who moonlight as sexually addled lumberjacks, spam, Vikings, ""ALBATROSS!"", killer sheep, lobotomies, pantomime horses, Tudor pornography, spamspamspamspam, Royal Society for Putting Things on Top of Other Things, the dirty vicar, and giant alien blancmanges who are turning people into Scotsmen.

Certain sketches have reached the point of immortality, especially John Cleese's ""dead parrot"" sketch, in which he plays an increasingly peeved guy who is trying to return a parrot that was ""nailed to its perch"" to disguise the fact that it was dead. Also Eric Idle playing the obnoxious guy who constantly thinks of sex, and refers to it as ""wink wink, nudge nudge... say no MORE!"" And of course, THE SPANISH INQUISTION, whose chief weapons are fear, surprise...

There are also some running jokes, like the pantomime Princess Margaret, and a mysterious knight who walks through hitting people with a dead chicken for no real reason. And of course, Terry Gilliam's cartoons interspersing the skits -- goofy, surreal, interlocked with the skits. Sort of like Saturday morning cartoons if Dali were doing the animating.

Okay, not every skit is funny -- the ""Mouse Problem"" sketch takes a great idea and stretches it thin. But more often than not, the sketches ARE quite funny, sly and even subversive at times. They also mock just about anything, from government officials to art (""Watteau, dear?"" ""What a terrible joke!"") to censorship to the military (""It's DANGEROUS, sir!"").

There are also a pair of live discs, in which the guys also do their best little skits and songs onstage, and they're almost as funny onstage as they are on a soundstage. It's not new or unique, but it's still fun.

The big problem is that the ""Personal Best"" DVDs are also included, which means that there's a massive load of utterly redundant material on here -- the same sketches in the full-length series, but rearranged by ""favorite"" status. There are a few fun original nuggets in here -- including Eric Idle playing his own mom and Cleese playing a dirty older version of himself -- but most of it is recycled skits and interviews. Come on, why not bundle the movies in with the series instead?

That said, the whole Monty Python phenomenon is utterly astoundingly -- the entire classic production was put on by men who often dressed up as the world's most unattractive girls, with only a tiny budget and minimal cast. The 70s production values are omnipresent, and they are decidedly un-politically correct. But in a weird way, these only make it even funnier than it would have been otherwise -- the writing and acting are pure, raw, unrefined comedy.

Probably the most memorable actors here are Cleese and Idle. Cleese does his psychotic shrieks better than anyone, as well as having that rubbery lanky body that twists itself into Silly Walks. And Idle not only has amazing comic timing, but he can adjust his voice and body language to... anything, from domestic goddesses to sleazy TV hosts. But the other actors are quite good too, especially Michael Palin, especially when he's playing someone timid or crazy.

This classic comedy series not only became a pop culture staple, but it's still fresh and funny more than thirty years after it was made. The full series is definitely a must-have, but ""Complete Monty Pythons Flying Circus - Collectors Edition Megaset"" is for those who don't mind paying for some recycled material.",1221264000,19,4322,5.1004243281471
1384626,5,B00004ZEU5,"I received two of the ""Personal Best"" series as gifts, so I won't mind that small bit of duplication to get the entire Python collection.

This set contains:

""Life of Brian"" Special Edition

A sampler of The Personal Bests
The complete Flying Circus TV series

""IT'S"" all great stuff!! Episodes are intelligent, silly, surreal and thought provoking. The Pythons string seemingly random sketches together brilliantly and make it all work as a whole more often than not.

If you're unfamiliar with Monty Python or just want to reaquaint yourself with their brand of comic absurdity, this boxset is a great way to do it. The box set contains every episode, 2 live discs, plenty of extras and looks and sounds great.

If you've never heard of Monty Python's Flying Circus.....shame on you! This is classic British comedy that still holds up completely 40+ years after the show was aired in BBC. The Pythons (Chapman, Cleese, Idle, Gilliam, Jones, Palin) have created some surreal sketches: Spam, Argument Clinic, Upper Class Twit of the Year, Silly Voices at the Police Station, and the Agatha Christie Sketch are just a few examples of what this comedy is all about. The humor is very strange, the stories useless, and the characters just plain wacky. And that's why we love it. Monty Python is timeless.

My favorite sketches include: Bruces, Election Night, Anne Elk's Theory on Brontosauruses, Silly Job Interview, and How Not to be Seen.

Groundbreaking and brilliant in every way, Monty Python's Flying Circus was perhaps one of the funniest shows of all time. Everyone has seen the Parrot Sketch, Spam, etc., but this collection is a unique opportunity to see the evolution of the series. You get every second of the entire telvision run with some live bonus disks, and it is fascinating to watch as the troupe evolves and refines their work.

I love seeing this in the linear format, with all of the failed bits as well as the famous ones. What is even more interesting is that when you look at it all together, you see how the Pythoners pioneered a lot of comedy that is still copied today.

 Society,shot it up,turned it upside down,flattened it and called it Mr. Gumby!!
What on the surface seems a simple enough point about the troupe but usually goes unnoticed today is their original appeal and impact. Python came out of the 60s rebellious era and while that trait alone wasn't surprising what was was their own nationality(British),their feigned attempts at portraying themselves as part of that staid and stuffy society all the while taking stabs at every English sacred cow and then some such as the police,the armed forces,the BBC,war vets,etc. which made it definitely ""something completely different""! There has never been a program like it before or since.
Each program was filled with several sketches tied together more or less with animated segments by Terry Gilliam,the only Yank in the group.
Having watched the entire set with it's 16 DVDs I was favourably impressed by the quality of the transfers. They are pretty sharp and crisp. The only disappointment is the ""Live at the Hollywood Bowl"" film. The film is not in  good condition and the colour is quite washed out. It is a full screen version and I wonder since some of the credits disappear off the screen that there isn't a widescreen version out there,hopefully in better condition than this. Time will tell.
I also noted that the sketches ""Proust"",""Bruce"" and ""Biggles"" have some quick moments that have slight cuts/jumps in them. I know the BBC is responsible for the first one but the other two I'm not sure of the who or why. There may be others but those are the three I noticed off hand. One will also notice that there are some film glitches and other various defects. From what I can determine these are things that are inherent in the original film and there's nothing that really can be done to excise them.
All 16 discs come in their own thin slip cases and are one sided(less chance of scratching!).Each DVD interactive menu if quite neat and each has its' own trivia spot about the particular ep you're watching and some neat special features including trivia question contests and more. There are alas no interviews with the cast mano a'mano but the 'Live at Aspen' DVD makes up a little for this.
Overall this is a set every Monty Python fan should own or a lover of good comedy. If you're one of the politically correct crowd I wouldn't advise you to buy this set as the guys leave NO stones unturned in their comedic efforts to offend and delight us all at the same time. It's a set I will certainly be watching again and again and you will too.",1184716800,4,2789,4.713114754098361

1384671,4,B00004ZEU5,"Now here is a problem, how do you review the work of comedy gods? I'm not even going to go there, to even start would be blasphemous. For years I have wanted a complete copy of all the series of Flying Circus yet in the U.K. this has still not been released. Only now are the series being released here on dvd and only each individual series. So for the same amount of money as collecting all 4 series of Flying Circus you can get this boxset which also gives you 2 extra discs of live shows, the German Episode, plus bonus features, making this collected edition much more value for money (but only if you have a multi-regional dvd player).

This boxset is fantastic, it took me an entire week to watch all 16 dvds! But there are a few things that let the boxset down. The ""Meet the Chaps"" feature gets repetitive as it's the same information on each of the episode discs. The ""Upper-class twit of the Year"" and ""Gumby"" quizzes are a good feature but slightly repetative. I loved the Gillianimations Art Gallery, to see the images Terry Gilliam used for the animated sequences is great.  The interactive menus are good but a bit more variety could have been added to the main menus to make them more entertaining. But to be honest none of that matters to an ardent Monty Python fan, they would just click through the menu until they get to their beloved Flying Circus, whether it would be a full episode or just their favourite sketch.

My biggest and major gripe about this boxset (and this is the only reason why I have rated this 4 stars instead of 5) is that under the shear weight of all 16 dvd discs that the spine of the boxset has a tendancy to rip at the bottom and at the top, if the spine, bottom and top were reinforced it could take the weight of all those discs. Or if was to be re-released I would suggest that it would more amusing to have it repackaged in the shape of a 16 Ton weight.",1179792000,9,1903,4.280555555555556

We Brits, who have been waiting since time in memorial a sumptous Python complete box set, are currently experienceing the underwhelming release of the one-series-at-a-time-with-no-extra-frills versions at, comparatively, high prices. Of all the releases across the Globe the 16-Ton Megaset is the best of the bunch. It is superior, I believe to the recent German release, which has just the shows, where-as this set has the extras and the live bonus disks.

The set is bulky. Each disk comes in its own case - three episodes to a disk, and if posted to the UK it ends up costing you import duty (5ish) and post office handling charges to the tune of about 8ish).  But it is worth well worth the expense. There is a good supply interactive menus and extras per disk. The disks appear to play on most DVD players (I have an LG combo, Region 2/All). It can be confusing -  all this Region 1/2/3... etc. business, but I've had no trouble at all playing the disks on the PC DVD (Region 2) - the version I have appears to be 'region free'.

Of course, being complete, the favorite routines are all here. The Tobacconist's Shop; the Cheese Shop; the Dead Parrot Sketch; the Spanish Inquisition. But there many surprises as well. Most shows seemed thrown together rather casually, or had a repeating motif hat held them together artificially. But a few shows -- Michael Palin's ""Bicyclist"" show in particular -- were wacky while being very well-crafted from beginning to end. And the show featuring the blanc-mange from outer space (whose rays turned everyone into stiff-stepping, red-bearded Scotsmen (even women and babies) was rollicking fun.

You don't have to feel that every MP skit was a masterpiece of comic art. There are plenty of stinkers in this series that have grown no funnier with age.

They should not have let these performers do dancing or singing. Eric Idle, a guitarist, sings about money in one ep and does a fifth rate job of it as well. Dubbing of these actors would have been better as no singing or dancing ability shows them up.

Add to that list the removal of most of Terry Gilliam's religious animations from the ""Not Being Seen"" episode. (The show ends with a fast-forward summation of the episode and you can see a glimpse of what was expunged.)

I saw all of these episodes uncensored in Canada when they were originally broadcast -- now 35 years later A&E decides what we can and cannot see, even as we pay to own the set. It's disturbing for many reasons that BBC comedy that pushes the boundaries with religion and philosophy is wiped clean by the hand of A&E.",1148774400,417,740,4.6923076923076925
1384726,4,B00004ZEU5,"A&E released this series a long time ago, back before sets like The Simpsons came out and set new standards for TV DVD collections. It was passable, at the time, for them to include only 3-4 shows per disc and lukewarm Extras, but these days... not so much.

Thus, I was a little disappointed when they re-released the Season set a few months ago, and it turned out to be the same thing, only in thinpacks. Don't get me wrong, the slim cases are nice, but I really wish they had gone the distance and repressed the DVDs, and put 6-7 episodes per disc, cobbled together some commentary tracks from archived recordings, and at the very least fixed the mistake where they deleted a skit from the end of one of the episodes.

Instead, we still have DVDs that are looking rather outdated, complete with a really long, unskippable intro that's the same on every disc, and ""Special Features"" that are mostly redundant. Why include clips from the episodes when we could just watch the episodes? Not to mention that we know A&E can do better now, as seen by their work on the Kids in the Hall DVDs and other sets.

As you can see, this is just a review of the DVD set. As for Python itself, there not much I can say that hasn't been said already. I give the material SIX stars, and the DVD set three stars, which averages out to four.

Despite that fact, I never had the chance to view their Flying Circus series in its entirety, although I had seen many of the episodes as parts of various compilations available for rental. I purchased their 16-megaton set immediately after I accidentally stumbled upon it while browsing through the amazon.com pages. It seemed like a good investment, especially after it was (oddly) nearly half the price amazon.co.uk were charging. Despite the 45 days it took for the package to be delivered to my door (I live in Greece) it was totally worth the wait. The DVDs are region-free so there are no player compatibility issues, and the picture quality is very good despite the age of the original material. For those who already have an idea of what the Pythons stand for, but mainly for those unfamiliar with their work, this item is a must, especially at this price.

SO, I put off buying the DVDs broken up into seasons, knowing that someday they'd ALL be released. And that day came. I purchased the DVD set in late 2005 as a Xmas gift to myself, but put off opening the set until now. Lo and behold, to my horror, there obviously was an accident at the plant: the discs included are sequenced as follows: 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 13, 15, 16. Now, look at that again. It's almost Pythonic: And now, disc 3, the Larch. And now... disc 4, The Larch. The... Larch. I don't personally have anything against the numbers 3 and 13, but I'm also a bit fond of 4 and 14 as well. Of course, with so much genius contained in this little box set, I wondered: What could possibly have been left out of 2 little DVDs that I can't live without? I looked on the back of the box: Disc 4: Undertakers, Upperclass Twit of the Year, and Albatross. Dear God! That's crucial!! OK, and Disc 14?: Hamlet and Ophelia, MR. NEUTRON, and the Most Awful Family in Britain. Not ""classics"" per se and certainly not the most well-loved skits, but I've always found the ""single-story"" episodes to be brilliant: MR. NEUTRON (""I will call you Mrs. S.C.U.M, Mrs. S.C.U.M.""), Bicycling in Cornwall (BINGO!!), Blancmanges From Outer Space (""They mean to win Wibledon!"") or Michael Ellis (""where are we going to get 44 tonnes of plankton from every morning??"")

Anyway, I'm sure the kind folks at Amazon will replace the unopened set even though I didn't discover this abomination until several months after delivery.

It doesn't affect my ability to review this though as they are almost Identical.  The only real difference is the original DVD sets of the series, and Live packaged each disc on full size Amaray cases, not the half size ones this set includes.

Anyway that all said, I will note that yes, a couple things were edited from the show.  But they were edited years ago and the original uncensored format never aired, so it isn't available to be restored.

The Series is a classic and simply the greatest sketch comedy show of all time.  Unlike other sketch shows, (*cough *cough SNL!) they knew that you can only run a joke for so long before you'll have to switch to something else.

What you might miss are the occasional song or sketch that's mysteriously cut out without notice.  For example, in episode 22, the Bruces mysteriously forget to sing their Philosopher's Song.

1384735,4,B00004ZEU5,"As a kid, I grew up on Monty Python's Flying Circus.  I remember listening to and watching PBS staff members begging it's viewer's for money (or else PBS will have to go away, yeah right), before Monty Python's Flying Circus finally came on.

My mother was a Star Trek fanatic, so I was definately compelled to dodge her influence as I ventured into other means.  My life's quests, at the time, were Progressive Rock Music, dirty girls with low self-esteem, and Monty Python's Flying Circus.  Oh, to be 14 again.

I do believe that I'll have to keep all my VHS versions of Monty Python that I've collected back in the eighties. I was so glad to see that all the Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes came out on DVD, but, blemishes, deletions, and censorship are all over these DVD releases. For example, the skit ""Biggles Dictates a Letter"" with his secretary has a speech and tape blip in it. In the ""Summerize Proust Competition"", the line which mentioned ""masturbating"" was altered and deleted out (why was it okay to leave in on the VHS tape?) And the first 4 seconds of the ""Book at Bedtime"" episode was omitted, but more disappointing was the very last skit involving ""Dad's Poove's"" was also omitted. Is it possible that this was just an initial first release oversight that got corrected later?  It's hard to tell since everyone has the same complaints that I do.  I see that Time-Life is now releasing this series with all the same artwork.  I wonder if they recognized the flaws and corrected them.

I hope someday these 45 episode's of Monty Python's Flying Circus will be re-released again with all the flaws corrected, and perhaps a better mastering effort (richer enhanced colours, and perhaps 5.1 surround sound), and perhaps released onto to 7 DVD's (or less) instead of 14.  Having only 3 or 4 episodes on one disc is such a waste of space.  Having very few episodes on one disc is the reason why I didn't bother to buy the original first releases of ""The Twilight Zone"" DVD's. (...way too many discs, and way too expensive.)

So, who's next to step up to the plate, and improve on the Monty Python TV series for DVD?

1384739,5,B00004ZEU5,"Loony, surreal, weird, zany, wonderfully mad, hilarious... these are all words that can describe Monty Python's Flying Circus.

It all started with five British guys (and one enthusiastic American) who somehow got their own TV show. When Monty Python's Flying Circus first premiered, there was confusion. Flying sheep, a television show where deaths of famous people are rated, a joke that is used in WWII to laugh the Germans to death?

It's surreal and strange, but somehow, fits into this madcap world we all live in. It's so different from all the things on television now- where else can we find the Spanish Inquisition bursting in on an unsuspecting couple?- and absolutely hilarious.

Some of it gets old- who hasn't heard the Lumberjack song, or seen the Dead Parrot sketch?- but there are gems to be found. Restaurant sketch, Aliens Turning People Into Scotsman, Ypres 1914, Self Defense Against the Fresh Fruit, and many many others that will have you rolling on the floor, laughing hysterically.

This is an excellent show, a landmark in comedy. If you like the typical and are always questioning ""Why did this happen? I don't get this,"" and are generally confused, then I wouldn't recommend Monty Python. You're just going to have to let it go. I've questioned at the beginning, but then realized that this is Monty Python. They do it because it's funny, not that it's logical.

On the two extra DVD's comes Live at Aspen, the Hollywood Bowl, 20 Years of Python (hosted by Steve Martin) and a German episode.

The best of the bunch is the Hollywood Bowl, seeing material never performed on Flying Circus and a hilarious moment that involves Terry Jones's wig falling off and Graham Chapman having to stand in front of him to cover up the incident. Next comes Live At Aspen, in which all the living (and not living) Pythons come together for a nice reunion. The talk is mostly what you could read in a Monty Python book or website, but has a few moments where we see the Pythons really together, either sharing secret jokes (what WAS Terry Gilliam doing with his finger in his water, laughing towards Michael Palin's direction?) or going back to their old habits (""It's not heretical, Terry!"" ""Yes it is, John, it's attacking the church."" ""No, it's not..."") which makes the other Pythons start laughing at they realize what they're doing. We also hear a few interesting stories about Michael Palin hiding in Carol Cleveland's closet and John Cleese hiding behind Michael Palin's bureau. By far the funniest moment is when Terry Gilliam ""accidently"" knocks over... oh, you'll have to see.

20 Years of Python is good, but if you've already seen most of Python, this is really sort of useless. Very good introduction for people who have not seen Python. This is the first apperance Graham Chapman makes with the Pythons in a closet, and the last apperance he ever made with the Pythons in a closet, as he died a few months later.

The German episode is nice, but I am a little bit heistant because it's in German. Still funny, but would be funnier if in English. The delivery is what makes the lines even more hilarious, but the Pythons loose this because of the different language. It's still very funny, and you do get to see sketches that you probably never have before.

There's really only one word to sum up Python- and that's hilarious. Or maybe it should be zany. Well, for now, I'll just say I love it.",1132963200,4,3420,4.734453781512605

~Some guy on VH1's ""I Love the 70's""

Since the 70's, millions have come to 'get' Monty Python and derive hours of enjoyment from the reruns. (First on Comedy Central, now on BBC America)

I put this show in a category with The Simpsons.  Not because of any similarity, but because they are rare examples of enduring brilliance, originality, and subversiveness.

Python was way ahead of its time, with a postmodern sort of referential humor that zinged everything from the Catholic Church to ontological philosophy.

This review is getting pretty disjointed, but that's just because Monty Python's Flying Circus defies description.

The set is magnificently done. This huge collection of disks contains all of the programs in chronological order. Each disk features 3 or 4 programs along with a few special features and trivia. This is how a set should be presented. That being said, watching it all took some effort.

Many of the routines are dated but most can still produce laughs. This is especially true of some of the absurd setups and situations to say nothing of the animations. Still, I learned that the Pythons are best taken in small doses. The shows were originally broadcast over 4 seasons. I crammed them into a few months. I'm still a bit numb over the whole thing.

1384744,5,B00004ZEU5,"Six comic delights -- five British guys, and one American. Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin.

These six guys created ""Monty Python's Flying Circus,"" a groundbreaking comedy series made of skits. They were sometimes gross, naughty, and they were always strange. And their bizarre humour has influenced everything from ""Saturday Night Live"" to Jasper Fforde.

For dozens of episodes, these guys served up skits on every insane subject you can think of: defense against fresh fruit, the Ministry of Funny Walks, sitcoms based on the family life of Attila the Hun, lupin bandit Dennis Moore, obscene children's books, semaphores, racing twits, village idiots, goats, psychotic barbers, Vikings, ""ALBATROSS!"", killer sheep, lobotomies, pantomime horses, Tudor pornography, Royal Society for Putting Things on Top of Other Things, the dirty vicar, and giant alien blancmanges who are turning people into Scotsmen.

Certain sketches have reached the point of immortality, especially John Cleese's ""dead parrot"" sketch, in which he plays an increasingly peeved guy who is trying to return a parrot that was ""nailed to its perch."" Also Eric Idle playing the obnoxious guy who constantly thinks of sex, and refers to it as ""wink wink, nudge nudge... say no MORE!"" And of course, THE SPANISH INQUISTION, whose chief weapons are fear, surprise...

There are also some running jokes, like the pantomime Princess Margaret, and a mysterious knight who walks through hitting people with a dead chicken. And of course, Terry Gilliam's cartoons interspersing the skits -- goofy, surreal, sort of like Saturday morning cartoons if Dali were doing the animating.

Okay, not every skit is funny -- the ""Mouse Problem"" sketch takes a great idea and stretches it thin. But more often than not, they ARE quite funny. They also mock just about anything, from government officials to art to censorship to the military (""It's DANGEROUS, sir!"").

There are also a pair of live discs, in which the guys also do their best little skits and songs onstage, and they're almost as funny onstage as they are on a soundstage. They make a nice bonus for Python fans, and are fun viewing after you've seen all fourteen discs of the TV show.

And all of this by men who often dress up as the world's most unattractive girls, with only a tiny budget and minimal cast. The 70s production values are omnipresent, and they are decidedly unpolitically correct. But in a weird way, these only make it even funnier than it would have been otherwise -- the writing and acting are pure, raw, unrefined comedy.

Probably the most memorable actors here are Cleese and Idle. Cleese does his psychotic shrieks better than anyone, as well as having that rubbery lanky body that twists itself into Silly Walks. And Idle not only has amazing comic timing, but he can adjust his voice and body language to... anything, from domestic goddesses to sleazy TV hosts. But the other actors are quite good too, especially Michael Palin, especially when he's playing someone timid or crazy.

This classic comedy series not only became a pop culture staple, but it's still fresh and funny more than thirty years after it was made. The full series is definitely a must-have.

1384748,5,B00004ZEU5,"Okay, so originally I posted this review as a one star review, only for the fact that this particular box set was released two to three years earlier and the only change with this set was the price was higher and the packaging was smaller.  But to be fair, this box set is just as good as the original was, and if you do not have it already, get it.  So to be fair, especially to all those who took the time to write their disgruntled opinions on my original post stating that it was just insanity to give such a brilliant collection one star, and for those who remained anonymous and just said that my review was not helpful; who obviously missed the point entirely and probably could not take the time to read my review, couldn't read or who didn't understand what was written, I have changed my review.  This is by far the greatest collection to ever be placed on DVD, and I'm sure that when the Blu-Ray comes out we will be expected to pay even more for even less. Below follows my original review, which may make sense to those who can read, or may not, I don't really care.  My point is and always has been that if you release the same exact product into the market, label it slightly different and charge more, you are really getting less.  I was pleasantly surprised to see this as a gold box deal and highly recommend getting this before the price is jacked up again, but only to those unfortunate few that don't already have it.

True Python fans, like me, would already own everything that has ever been available for Python, like I do, and the items in this set are no different.  While I won't argue that it is a great collection, it is a pity that the producers of this set have simply taken to older one off the market, added two discs from another set labeled it new and improved and priced it higher so they could still make money.  Greedy pigs make me sick, why if I had half a mind, I'd march right up to them in their fancy shoes, pressed pants and starched shirts and bleeding Masonic handshakes and I'd...I'd...I'd beg them to let me join their cruel attempts to take over the world.  Please, please let me join you, I'd only just sit in the corner and be ever so quiet, unless you wanted me to talk, honestly I just want to bask in the sun that is your greedy attempts at capitalism, perhaps dining on a few table scraps or licking the mud off your shoes.

1384749,5,B00004ZEU5,"4.5 (almost 5!) Stars

Take a fantastic set of shows from an excellent British series, add two more discs of the troupe doing the classic bits live, and give it to the customer for practically the same price and you've got something for every Python fan.

First, my review of Monty Python's Flying Circus. I love the show. I think it is groundbreaking in its style and is still incredibly funny today. However, a type of humour doesn't appeal to 100% of the people and this is British humour so I know it won't appeal to a larger percentage. That being said, if you like British humour or sketch comedy, you will probably like Monty Python's TV show.

But, I am here to review the DVD set more than anything since that is what you are considering to buy. I am no Python expert so I can't tell you every little nook and cranny that should or should not exist on this collection. Like most box sets, it is missing something here and there and some of the other reviews point this out. For the most part, unless you are saturated in Python lore, you will not notice.

What you get is every episode put out on the BBC and I think they did a fine job working with the product. This isn't digital transfer so there are limitations. All of the skits I knew were on there, many that I had forgotten and many that I hadn't seen broadcast in the U.S. It is great to see them one after another in their original form. It is also great to have them all together in one box. If you are looking to find just a few specific skits or episodes, you may only need one disc or one of the smaller sets. But the price adds up if you get several, making the box set worth it.

The extras give some nice insight into the making of the series through some written blurbs about each episode and they have spliced together some thematic skits and animations. You can test your trivial knowledge of the Pythons and you can learn some history of the players. Also, some of the skits that they later performed live are available in the extras. The menu, as expected, is also well done using Terry Gilliam's animations.

However, the chaptering of the discs isn't real obvious so if you are searching for one skit, it may take some work to get there. Also, the packaging doesn't list all of the skits on each disc and in each episode so if you haven't memorized the series completely, you will have to go online to find that resource.

The boys went all out when putting extras on Holy Grail and I wish there was a bit more to this set. I would love commentary or interviews or a documentary or something. It would be quite a chore for this much but even a little bit would be nice. Otherwise, this would rate 5 stars as a DVD set.  With the additional discs, it comes even closer than the last set.

For me, though, I'm very happy having the episodes to watch whenever I want, whenever the mood strikes me. Some of the gems are the lesser known skits that aren't part of the public consciousness. Again, you don't need to be a Pythonphile to enjoy this set, just someone who really likes the show and the humour.",1127347200,138,3083,4.301724137931035
1384750,5,B00004ZEU5,"For those who don't know, the Monty Pythons were a group of british guys who clearly revolutionized TV comedy with a weekly tv show called The Monty Python's Flying Circus.

In it, they would develop and perfect a style that we started to define as ""the perfect example of british humour"". Today we see such style followers averywhere. And perhaps 90% of britcom owes a lot to these great men of straight faces and devastating effectiveness. Like The Beatles... there was only the before and the after... say no more!

Instead of jokes, the shows are composed by short sketches that mock anything you can think of.

....It can be something simple yet unexpected as ""the guy who reports a stolen wallet to a policeman and ends up inviting him home (to do you know what)""

....it can be something phisicaly demanding, hysteric yet full of political critique like my favorite ""the Silly Walk"" sketch (something no comedian could do as effectively as John Cleese);

...it can be something obvious yet nobody thought of it before like... the diner at a restaurant whose menu only has topics for discussions;

...it can be their unique way of making comedy an intelectual thing without compromising either audience nor comedy... like ""picasso painting a picture in a bicycle"";

...or it can be the uncontrolable bursts of inspiration like the ""nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition""-thing along one of the shows.

....IT WAS THESE GUYS WHO TURNED TV COMEDY INTO ART!!!!!

With Monty Python, the viewer gets the impression there were no limits to what they could do. It seems nothing could stop them. They were the absolute comic masters whose speciality was to take very little and deliver a very lot.

This new DVD collection ads two live DVDs and an incredible row of extras. The die hard fans of the group will be delighted to see them again.. in a kind of humour that ironically enough has not aged in many ways... possibly because they made fun of things that are too universal and contemporary.

The production values of the series are clearly 70's BBC style (the only dated thing about the series)... but five minutes after start you'll be laughing silly with the quality of their texts, chracters and situations.

This box is a great buy because one gets so much great entertainment from any individual show that he/she will want to see more and more of it.

In the word of modern comedy, the Monty Pythons are like The Beatles. No other group is so missed. No other group was so creative and influential. No other group ever left the expectancy/myth/secret-desire in their audience for a great comeback... of course their members did keep working and even got together occasionaly (like Cleese and Palin in ""A Fish Called Wanda"" or Gilliam's movies)...

But after the Flying Circus and the movies, live shows and their records, I wonder if there will ever be a group like the Pythons...

No (or after the next 500 years... maybe).",1127001600,70,2934,4.7936507936507935

I checked with some software that the DVDs were indeed region free, and so tried to rip it to my hard drive. After removing the CSS encoding (and any other processing the ripper was doing) the movie was playing fine! So as a word of warning, be prepared to work around this problem it might happen.

1384761,5,B00004ZEU5,"Alternately silly and surrealistic, Monty Python's Flying Circus is often cited as an comedic inspiration but seldom truly emulated. There's just as much magic here as with other classic comedy teams like the Marx Brothers, and that special combination of witty writing talent and performing ability just isn't capable of being copied. It's impossible to overstate just how different Monty Python's humor was in the late 1960s/early 1970s and how, going on 40 years later, it still provides a healthy alternative to most mainstream American and British comedy. Unlike most comedians, who prefer to feign stupidity on and off screen, the individual members of Monty Python weren't afraid to be themselves - a group of over-educated smart alecks willing to speak in (gasp) complete sentences and admit that they actually read books! This is very funny irreverent stuff, containing media parodies, social commentaries, stream-of-consciousness and plenty of gut-busting laughs at the expense of the very British authority figures being mocked in every episode. Not even the Church of England is exempt.

Yes, this set is pricy and as with other A&E sets there are very slight trims that will be annoying to purists. But for one-stop Monty Python madness, this set is a must. It contains all the episodes from Monty Python's TV series. I always prefered the series to Python's later movies, so this set contains all the Python I really need to see. My personal favorite sketch is ""The Bishop,"" a James Bond/Peter Gunn-like parody in which Terry Jones plays a crimefighting Bishop.

For newer fans, I would recommend borrowing or renting several individual discs first. See if this is to your tastes, and if it is, buy this set! Ignore the rather vocal nerdish cult that has unfortunately become associated with Python and just enjoy the humor.

My gosh, for barely the price of one or two trips to the shrink... look at it... its all there... you can watch the whole series sequentially, your favorite bits or freeze frame Gilliam's revolutionary animated sequences and closely examine the naughty bits.

Most of the DVDs have three episodes apiece on them, and they are wonderful to watch in order, to see the development of the Python style, or at random, to be pleasantly surprised by whatever bit of insanity happens to pop up.

In addition to the shows themselves, the discs have several extras, including biographical bits illustrated with representative clips of each Python, trivia contests (for both Gumbys and Upper Class Twits), bits of Gilliam animation (which, frankly is my least favorite part of the show, so I skipped much of this), random bits from the German shows and live shows, and direct scene access that is reasonably well catalogued.

""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" is without question my favorite television show of all time, and this box set does it justice.

But - there are also bits added that were never in the original US broadcasts, especially in the first series.

Except? Two of my favourite memories (and I might be wrong here) are not on there. One being the race of the Incontinent (Which I know is starred on the 'The Life Of Monty Pthon' DVD, but in a different form than I remember) and the other being a skecth about the car being an extension of a man's genitals.
Let's not bicker and argue about what's and what's not though. For a mere 170 bucks, you'll be the proud owner of close to 24 hours of Monty Python pleasure. Completely at your leisure to impress your friends with whenever you want. 14 (!) DVDs in total, this set comes at an amazingly low price.
The extras could have been better, and the menu gets annoying after the third DVD, but for any major Monty Python fan (and I know there's a LOT out there) this box is a must-have.",1079827200,8,1323,4.586497890295359
1384775,4,B00004ZEU5,"I don't have the gift of gab, or the experience in writing reviews that others do.  So I'll get right to the point!  If you've been reading everyone's comments, you know this is a very silly, very funny series.  I could go on and on about why people love it so much, but you've already read that a hundred times.
The bane and the bonus are the extras they've included.  On each DVD, you get an assortment of features, including brief biographies of the boys, perhaps some of Terry's animation, or a dictionary of Python-induced words.  Some DVDs even have a fun, interactive trivia contest (you against yourself, of couse!)  But, at least on my discs, many of the extras didn't work as expected.  The biographies locked up and I'd be unable to proceed to the next one, or the trivia game wouldn't allow me to enter an answer.  This is really frustrating and made me wonder if the set was thrown together haphazardly without proper testing.  But, the features that *do* work sure are fun!
The last flaw is one that the troupe proudly advertises on each disc ...
""How the DVD Process Works:  The imperfections of the origial ANALOG Monty Python shows have been analyzed and painstakingly reproduced as DIGITAL imperfections.""

However, the fun with this DVD set is definitely spoiled because of the fake canned laughter dubbed over, sometimes louder than the actors' voices. This fake laughter is not present in the original series which is aired from time to time here in Germany. That's why I gave it only 4 stars, otherwise it would have been 5 stars...

So anyone who is able to watch MPFC is a real lucky person because it is a real privilege to do so. And more then everything else it is the best comedy in the world. I've watched the series from a recorded video tape so often that in the end the tapes grew thin and teared apart.

But don't load the hollowpoints in that Smith and Wesson yet! There is still the greatest of all comedy shows, Monty Python's Flying Circus! And lo, the villagers did rejoice...
Monty Python was the name of a group of young Brittish men who were given a budget and some TV cameras. They wrote comedy that made THEM laugh, and not some empty corporate suit. The result is some of the funniest stuff ever broadcast in the history of television. If you loved the old SNL stuff with Belushi and the other all-stars, you will love Python more.
This set has all of the TV episodes ever aired. There is pure gold in them thar episodes. Jokes about everything from Nixon, to flying sheep, to the Royal Philharmonic going to the bathroom are all in here. This is a sure cure for the network TV doldrums. Python will make you laugh until you cry, and you will enjoy watching the episodes over and over. I have seen every episode literally over 3 dozen times, and I still love it.

1384782,5,B00004ZEU5,"Monty Python's Flying Circus is one of those entertainment phenomena that has to be seen to be believed. Describing to newbies it is impossible (I've tried, and it can't be done). It's like going through a funhouse -- a funhouse composed of the bizarre thoughts of six guys (five Brits, one American) who wanted something ""different."" Well, they gave us something different. Verrrrry different. So different, in fact, that it's still unique.
The Python crew present us with confused flower-stealing bandit Dennis Moore; the kamikaze Scotsmen; Elizabethan Pornography (and the supposedly-Shakespearean ""Gay Boys in Bondage""); a game show devoted to prejudice; the Pantomime Horses, Pantomime Goose, and Pantomime Princess Margaret; a frustrated man trying to return a dead parrot he was sold (""Bereft of life, it rests in peace!""); hairdressers climbing Mount Everest; ""senile delinquents,"" also called ""Hell's Grannies""; the Fish-slapping Dance (which is EXACTLY what it sounds like); buildings that collapse if you stop believing in them, and many, many more. Oh yes -- and the killer tennis-playing blancmanges from the galaxy Andromeda, who are turning people into Scotsmen.
Sprinkled through the DVDs are the wacky animation skits that somehow tie it together (like a TV actively abusing a man's eyeballs). They're joyously politically-incorrect (I'm surprised they didn't get sued by everyone, including the entire countries of Scotland and Belgium). They're so funny that regardless of gender, creed, or cheese preference, you'll laugh yourself sick. And not just because all these men like to dress as (ugly) women.
Don't watch this if you can't sit down and watch it in full. Walking in in the middle of a sketch is the most disorienting thing I can imagine, but watching any of them (well, most of them) in full is almost guaranteed to make you laugh.  The material is always surreal, delivered either with a straight face or a mocking smile, and often running jokes that keep cropping up (like Eric Idle constantly disrupting sketches to demand a pound).
So check out Monty Python's Flying Circus, and pretty soon you'll be speaking in anagrams and quoting random lines about dead parrots, cheese shops, full-frontal nudity, and torture in... the comfy chair. British comedy at its best. Actually, it's just comedy in general at its best.",1066780800,10,2348,5.261333333333333

Yes, it would've been nice if they added the two German episodes (A&E stuck both on their other DVD sets) or some other really rare extra historic clips on the Pythons (again see other sets). And yes, if you really, really have the spare time, look really hard, and follow the script books line by line, there are a few minor words and/or bits they apparently deleted or couldn't dig up in the archives to digitally remaster...bloody Vikings!

No Monty Python fan (young or old) is to be without this dvd set! Enjoy every episode of the hillarious Flying Circus series. If you're a Monty Python fan, then there's no need explaining the quirky humour of these Comedy Legends!!! BUY THIS NOW!! You won't regret it! All I have to say to you is: Lemon Curry?
TO THE NON-MONTY PYTHON FAN:
I've come to admit (as hard as it was) that not everyone has the pythonesque sense of humour... and if you don't, then you're unlikely to enjoy these dvds. However, if you have that outragously random, funny, wacky, and just plain old silly sense of humour - then these could be for you. For those of you who don't know, the episodes consist of funny sketches (skits) that are often linked together by some wacky animations. Very Funny Stuff!
Out of the hundreds of Sketches, some classics are:
The Fish Slapping Dance
The Ministry of Silly Walks
The Funniest Joke In The World (Which, when people read it, they die laughing)
The Spanish Inquisition (that's quite disfunctional)
The Dead Parrot Sketch
Nudge Nudge
Buying An Ant
and one of my favourites, The Undertakers...
...A man walks into the Undertakers and tells the Undertaker that his mother had just died, and asked them what to do. The Undertaker replied ""Now there's three things we can do with your mum. We can bury her, burn her, or dump her."" ""Dump her??"" said the shocked customer. ""Yeah, dump her in the Thames."" ""What?"" ""Oh, did you like her??"" So the Undertaker decides that it's best not to dump her. The sketch continues with the Undertaker giving a full description of what happens when the body's burned/buried: ""Well they're both nasty. If we burn her, she gets stuffed in the flames, crackle, crackle, crackle, which is a bit of a shock if she's not quite dead. But quick. And then you get a box of ashes, which you can pretend are hers. Or, if you don't wanna fry her, you can bury her. And then she'll get eaten up by maggots and weevils, nibble, nibble, nibble, which isn't so hot if, as I said, she's not quite dead."" The customer replies that he is definately sure that his mother is dead, so the Undertaker takes a look at her (she's in a sack) and realises that they've got ""An eater"". It ends with the punchline that if the customer felt guilty after eating her, they'd dig a grave so he could throw up in it!
If you weren't sure by what I meant with outragous comedy, that should help!

1384793,5,B00004ZEU5,"Indispensable for all those who are fascinated by the unique genius of this iconoclastic comedy troupe.  People who do not care for British humour, intellectual humour, surrealism, or who are easily offended ought to stay away! Very interesting to watch the series in order and see the developments/deteriorations along the way . . . particularly
interesting and disturbing to see Graham Chapman in the first series as a brilliantly funny and incredibly beautiful 28-year old, progressing through to the fourth series, when he is hardly given any speaking lines because he can't be trusted to learn them, and his glassy-eyed alcohol-swollen face is clearly that of a man drinking himself to death.  I was so perturbed by this that I had to watch ""Life of Brian"" afterward, to see him back in shape after getting sober.
No question that there's some material in here that falls flat; but when the Python writing hits what I think of as ""the sweet spot"", it is so incandescently delightful and somehow wonderfully liberating.  A really brilliant Python sketch, like
""Blackmail"", ""Piranha Brothers"", or the deceptively simple ""Man who speaks in anagrams"", goes beyond being funny and achieves a remarkable tribute to the ability of the human mind to contain and tame even the most horrible things in the world by laughing at them.  The uninitiated might well say, ""Where's the pleasure in that?"", but I have watched certain of these sketches twenty or thirty times without tiring of them.",1032566400,,1485,5.024390243902439

1384799,5,B00004ZEU5,"The greatest comedy sketch show of all time, the complete Monty Python collection consists of all 45 episodes made, broken down into four series. The first three series are all classics, and although the 4th series was shorter, without John Cleese, and seems less inspired, is still much more funnier than any other sketch show.
All of the classic sketches are there: The Lumberjack Song, The Upperclass Twit of the Year Show, Nudge Nudge, The Spanish Inquistion etc., and of course the Parrot Sketch. Of all the overlooked sketches, my favourite is the Dirty Fork sketch. How the team come up with a sketch where a filthy piece of cutlery can bring such emotion, heartbreak, metal anguish, and suicide is nothing short of genius!
It is true to say that a couple of edits (and at least one sketch missing) have been made, but were made for censorship reasons and should not really detract you from enjoying this collection. I would have liked all of the episodes to be complete, but these edits were done on the less memorable sketches, so they don't bother me greatly.
The picture transfer is excellent considering the age of the programmes and the fact that the episodes were converted from PAL to NTSC. Sound is mono only, but it is clear. In fact, the whole quality is better than my ageing VHS collection!

1384800,4,B00004ZEU5,"I just couldn't bring myself to give this set 5 stars.  I wish it were possible to give it 4 1/2 stars.
First of all, it's true, the episodes are not 100% complete, however, many people, in my opinion, have been over-reacting about the cuts.  Actually, the A&E DVD #1 has a sketch in the 2nd episode called 'The Wacky Queen', which was edited out of the show after the first broadcast & was never shown again on TV in the UK or abroad, as far as I know.  Seasons 1 & 2 have no cuts, at least none that I spotted when comparing the DVDs to the synopsis in the Monty Python books by Jim Yoakum & Kim ""Howard"" Johnson.  There is a slight edit of one word in the 5th episode of the 3rd season during the 'Summarize Proust Competition' which the BBC made to the episode before broadcast.  Broadcasts outside of the UK had the uncensored version of the sketch.  Unfortunately, A&E got a censored master. In the 7th episode of the same season during the 'Biggles Dictates a Letter' sketch, there is a slight glitch which can be blamed on slopply mastering on A&E's part.  It doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the sketch very much. The episode that appears to be worst hit is the 12th episode of season 3.  A&E goofed when they included 'Party Political Broadcast' on the box to this episode.  The sketch was edited from the master tape and hasn't been seen since the original broadcast in 1973.  This material is very probably lost forever. The very end of this episode, which has a trailer for Dad's Doctors & Dad's Pooves, is also missing from the episode.  This was probably sloppy editing on the part of A&E video as the episode does a fade to black with the BBC TV logo then fades up again with the BBC TV logo again and the 'Dad's...' trailer. The person transfering the episode, who probably had no familiarity with Python thought that it wasn't part of the episode or something.  A&E should have hired one of the US Python experts like Kim 'Howard' Johnson, Jim Yoakum, or David Morgan to oversee the A&E transfers so these mistakes might have been prevented.  As far as I know, the cuts I just mentioned are the only ones that have been made to these DVDs.  Not that much, in my opinion.  Certainly not enough to bring this set all the way down to one star.  Some have also complained that this set didn't include the German episodes 'Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus'.  These episodes were produced for German TV & not for BBC TV.  In fact, the 1st one, which was done in German, was never shown on British TV.  This set does contain all 45 episodes that were produced for BBC television.  A&E has released the 2 German episodes.  The first one, in German with English subtitles, is in the set 'Monty Python Live' and the second one, shot in and in English, is in the 'Life of Python' set.
Yes, yes, the quality of the picture and sound is not perfect, but still better than any TV broadcast that I've seen. I suspect that the quality of the shows as broadcast wasn't terribly impressive. BBC Television only started broadcasting in color in 1969 (the year Python started) and it was still new technology to them.  The sound is Mono. The BBC didn't go to Stereo until 1988! To do some kind of stereo remaster, one would need access to seperate dialogue, sound effect, and music tracks, which I'm sure don't exist with the Pythons or the BBC.  Such a thing did exist for Holy Grail, which is why Columbia was able to do a remastered Stereo soundtrack. Furthermore, each show had a budget of $6000. These shows were done on a shoestring and the BBC probably didn't have state of the art equipment, being a Government funded broadcaster.
I love Monty Python, and these 45 shows changed the face of comedy.  There are a few, very few, bits missing.
If you love Python, you should buy it.  Some fans have over-reacted way too much about the missing material.  If something like the Lumberjack Song, or Parrot sketch, or Cheese Shop, or Nudge Nudge were cut, that would be reason for outrage.  Not for the few fairly minor missing bits.  Over 24 hours of pure fun.",1025395200,630,4065,4.464140730717185
1384801,2,B00004ZEU5,"Take the best of material and it can still be wrecked by the incompetence of those charged with the license to put it on DVD.
Why is it that there needs to be DVD releases that just do not measure up to the original material?
Given that there are edits that remove or censor the content of the original series and thus make it incomplete - why would anyone spend the kind of money they are asking for on this pile of discs?
If I or anyone is expected to plunk down that level of cash, I would expect the DVD, as one should from any DVD release, that it be COMPLETE, it must include every second of every sketch as they aired in the tv series.  If my ancient VHS recordings of the show provide a more complete library of the sketches than the DVD's then we have a failed series.  Others have already pointed out some of the failures.
To anyone who wants a definitive DVD collection of the entire Monty Python's Flying Circus, I recommend NOT buying this but waiting, maybe another 5 or 10 years.  Maybe, if the BBC releases their own version , they will get it right and not bungle the job like A&E has done.

'Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus' 1971 episode included the excellent Silly Olympics sketch, and the 1972 episode had the hilarious International Philosophy sketch (where ancient Greek philosophers battle duel German philosophers at soccer).

1384806,5,B00004ZEU5,"At the time I purchased this set, I had seen perhaps half of the episodes of this tv series, most of them over ten years ago. I enjoyed the series, and wanted to see more. I had also read quite a bit about the series, but hadn't been able to fully comprehend what I had read due to a lack of exposure.
This set was a revelation.
First of all, the video quality is a good as possible for tv shows some of which are now over 30 years old. The photography is sharp, the picture bright, the colors clear. DVD allows all the colors to shine through, without that annoying color static that comes up with bright reds, which Python used quite a bit.
Secondly, seeing all the shows in order allowed me to really appreciate all the planning and effort that went into what often appears to be pure chaos. Running gags don't just recur in one episode, they re-occur in subsequent episodes. The first shows of the season are consistently funny, and the last shows of the season tend to have some weaker material, though still very good.
And, finally, there are many fun features, clips, archival artwork, and trivia questions to keep you amused when you have seen simply too much Monty for the moment.
I actually managed to watch this entire set over the course of two months. What is amazing is that I WANTED to - even after 30 episodes, I couldn't wait to see what was next!
The only thing missing is the tiny bits of footage edited out of shows here and there. I'm not even sure that it exists anymore, but it would have been nice to see the footage restored, or at least included as a bonus.

1384810,5,B00004ZEU5,"...Monty Python's Flying Circus. Picture the scene, an idyllic english seaside town. The sea looks calm when suddenly, out of the water, an obscured figure appears, and begins to move towards the screen. As the figure becomes clearer we can make out his torn clothes and scraggly grey hair and beard. He reaches the beach and crawls slowly towards the camera. Mustering up his last ounce of strength, he utters the immortal word... ""It's"" And so starts the first episode of the greatest television programme of all time (and british to boot).
What to say about such influential comedy. In Series One, it is clear to see that the group are still finding their feet. There is even the odd fluffed line here and there (Watch out for John Cleese is in ""Crunchy Frog""). But the first series has some wonderful moments, for example ""the Mouse problem,"" a brilliant satire of societies attitudes towards homosexuals and drugs.
Series Two, however, is where the group really hit their stride. Not as charmingly haphazard or deliriously surreal as series one, but in the comedy stakes it really goes for the jugular. ""The Spanish Inquisition"" and the Kray twins spoof, ""The Piranha Brothers,"" are stand outs, but there is so much more that it offers, including the notoriously controversial Undertaker's sketch. Gilliam's animations in this series are also some of his best.
Series Three marked the beggining of the end for the Python's. Cleese had become restless and thought about leaving the group. He was persuaded to stay and the Pythons produced some high quality, yet in parts very patchy episodes. There is genius here - ""Dennis Moore"" ""The Cheese Shop"" and ""Olympic Hide and Seek"" for example. But this also some plain unfunny material, such as ""the All England Summarize Proust Competetion"" - apparently a classlic, although i've never seen why.
 It was probably this inconsistency, as well as a feeling that he was repeating himself, that made up Cleese's mind that after the third series enogh was enough. He felt that ""the Cheese Shop"" and ""Dennis Moore"" were the only two original sketches he and Chapman had created throught series three. The rest, he felt were cobbled together bits and bobs of other sketches from the first three series. And so he bid the group adieu.
Stripped of a member, the group stripped the ""Flying Circus"" out of their title for their fourth, and final, series, simply entitled ""Monty Python"" However, the absence of Cleese (he does not appear in the show in any capacity and only provided minimal material for the first episode) has clearly tilted the balance, and unfortunately series four is a distant relative even of the patchy series three. To say that there is no humour contained within the episodes would be unfair, but it is, alas mixed in with a mire of cringe makingly embarrassing moments.
 Eric Idle once remarked, that if a sketch is over ten minutes long, ""It's Mike's [palin] and Terry's [Jones]"" Well with Cleese gone their excesses run full flow, a classic example being the long repetitive and dare i say it, boring ""Golden Age of Ballooning"" episode. The brilliant Gilliam is given more chance to flex his comedy acting muscle, but it is all in vain. Luckily, we are spared from a full thirteen episode run (there were only six episodes commissioned), as it is sad to see a once mighty bunch fumbling in the waters of mediocrity. And so, with a very poignant guitar version of the theme music (which brings a tear to your eye) the last episode of MPFC draws to a close.
 Monty Python's Flying Circus is simply the greatest and most influential TV series of all time. It had six great writer/performers each with their own unique talent, a memorable theme tune, an inspired animator, a drop dead gorgeous female co-star (Carol Cleveland). And although it lagged towards the end, the first two series are comedy perfection.... Oh.. and there's something about a dead parrot in it as well.",1002672000,22,3939,4.849925705794948

As a Python Geek of Trekkie proportions since childhood - and particularly during my teenage years - I find that nothing can compare to seeing the old favorites without commercials, and with a billion bonus rarities.  There are a handful of technical glitches here and there, but the ""Trivial Quest"" format is wonderful - as are the additional clips from Live at the Hollywood Bowl and Fliegender Zirkus.
What makes this set worth the price is being able to get that clear digital freeze-frame and find out what you missed all these years (such as the hilarious store directory in the ""Michael Ellis"" episode, which is illegible on a videotape freeze).

1384814,4,B00004ZEU5,"Well, I know I'm gonna be burned in effigy by the Python Nation for what I'm about to say, but it's not like I care anyway...
I've never considered `Monty Python' to be very funny in the laugh-out-loud sense. I did get a bit of a chuckle from time to time, but for the most part I found the show to be loud, obnoxious, stupid, and downright bizarre. Strangely enough, however, it was the sheer weirdness of the show, along with the ofttimes acrobatic physical humor, that drew me in. As if five (sometimes more, sometimes less) Brits performing such off-the-wall fare as `Upper Class Twit of the Year', `Dennis Moore' and `No One Expects The Spanish Inquisition' wasn't bizarre enough, the show's token Yank helped add to this atmosphere of unbelievable strangeness by creating those otherworldly cutout-style between-sketch animations.
In fact, it was these subversive `toons that I tuned in for when the series aired on PBS. After all, what does a ten-year-old know or care about the Dead Parrot sketch anyway? At that age, the big foot from heaven that tramples the title logo was one of the biggest screams of my socially-inept existence. Fortunately, as I matured, I found myself unable to turn away from the live-action parts and those became a part of my socially-inept existence as well.
Now, about the extra features- each DVD includes `Gilliam's Attic', featuring some of the cutout figures and/or animations that became an indelible aspect of the show. Also featured is The Pythonisms section, which is a glossary of British terms and vernacular. It's a great way for the Yank MPFC layman to get the banter of the show! Sometimes in lieu of the Pythonisms, there's a trivia section to challenge your MPFC knowledge. Then there's the `Meet the Chaps' section, highlighting the careers of each member of the core troupe. Also intermittently featured are `live' versions of the most famous Python sketches excerpted from the Hollywood Bowl movie. The live `crunchy frog' on disc 2 is disturbingly memorable.
Oh, one last thing: all the discs come in a rather flimsy cardboard sleeve. Try not to place anything too heavy on top of the sleeve, especially if there aren't any DVDs in it. I know this might seem painfully obvious to you, but in my view it's better to be safe than sorry!
Oh, all right... I'll let you in on my fave sketch. It's not `Dead Parrot', `Nudge Nudge', or `Spanish Inquisition'. Neither is it `Upper Class Twit of the Year', `Angus Podgorny vs. the Blancmanges', nor `Argument Clinic'. It's (sorry, couldn't resist)... the `Cannibal Undertaker' sketch, which is at the end of episode 26. Probably one of the earliest examples of `gross-out'- style sketch comedy, it's the only time the studio audience was ever disgusted enough to storm the set (though I have a sneaking suspicion this part was staged as well...)!

1384815,5,B00004ZEU5,"There's been a lot of criticism of the A&E DVDs. Personally, I think this is the best resurrection of the TV shows so far. OK, there's a few bits which feature the ""Edited"" version, but less than most people would seem to imply. Some sketches WERE filmed and ARE listed in All the Words, but they were never actually broadcast, and no longer exist. The Political Broadcast that another reviewer commented on, and the Wee-Wee sketch are prime examples. It is futile to complain that they're not included. The other complaint is the censored versions of Summarise Proust and The Spot.  Detailing really. The only bit that is missed and really required is the trailer at the end of the Dennis Moore episode, totally removed from this edition. However, with 45 shows to do, I think this could be forgiven.
The other complaint, the quality of sound and image, is also often invalid. If you compare these disks to VHS or TV recordings, this is far superior. In particuar, the filmed sketches have been greatly improved (the School Prizes, lots of It's Man appearances, and Undressing on the Beach come to mind). Any minor lapses in quality are mainly due to the original recordings from what I can discern.
Personally, I congratulate A&E on their Python DVDs. Incidentally, I think these are the best covers of any edition of the shows.... so there.",994896000,17,1343,4.763948497854077

7928631,5,B00004ZEU5,"I used to have a copy of the Complete Monty Python in the 16 ton set, but was divested of it by another party. Its a good version, here, but at its current price it is overpriced. The Almost Everything collection has perfectly good copies of the Circus, and more, for a fraction of the price. Great for the fan who cannot afford to pay this much for the 16 ton set, you just have to have a multi zone player ( and you get more than the original Circus series).",1519603200,,460,4.065934065934066

Seeing the shows in something close to pristine condition is a wonder.

Of course, they are missing Mr. Cleese's self-critical evaluation.",1515369600,,215,5.294117647058823

This never would've happened if you'd listened! But, oh no, what do we know? You and your bloomin' certificate and your pop-up gazebo. You had to go poking about and now it's ruined.
