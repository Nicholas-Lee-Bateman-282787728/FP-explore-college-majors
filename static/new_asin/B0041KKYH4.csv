4243983,4,B0041KKYH4,"This movie was a little better than I was expecting. It was very funny and very dirty. Cameron Diaz is the best bad teacher ever. She cusses at her students, mocks them, drinks in her class, and does drugs. At the start of the new school year, Elizabeth meets a new teacher named Scott. She tries to flirt with him, but he just got out of a bad relationship and just wants to be friends. She begins to embezzle from the school so she can have breast surgery. Another snoopy teacher named Amy Squirrel competes against Elizabeth and tries to prove she is stealing money. I highly recommend BAD TEACHER!!!",1309305600,4,603,4.490909090909091
4243984,1,B0041KKYH4,"Stupid movie. Why would a gold-digger be a teacher? Why does this movie paint women as gold-digging, vain jerks. The only funny parts where what was shown in the trailer. Skip this horrible movie!",1309132800,11,196,4.794117647058823
4243985,4,B0041KKYH4,"A reluctant teacher loses her wealthy fianc' and thus has to return to the job she hates. Desiring breast implants, she pursues the bonus awarded to the teacher whose class has the highest test scores. Along the way she is pursed by a gym teacher, tries to connect with a rich substitute, and finds a rival in a fellow teacher, the funniest and most well-developed character in the film. This is a movie that I found funny and refreshing, in that it is not laced with vulgarities and profanity throughout. This is a movie that provides laughs while not seeking the lowest common denominator. A pleasant surprise.",1309046400,64,612,4.728971962616822
4243986,3,B0041KKYH4,"R-rated comedies are really starting to all feel exactly the same. The same argument can more than likely be made for any genre, but R-rated comedies seem to be the guiltiest of mimicking that one gem in its arsenal that did well a few years ago. Avatar is probably one of the reasons that 75% of movies are offered in the 3D format, nearly every superhero film does well thanks to comic book fans, and Pixar and Dreamworks pretty much rule the animated film market. When it comes to adult comedies, we have the likes of The Hangover and Judd Apatow films to blame for their success and nearly every R-rated comedy since has either felt like it's been marketed towards fans of those films or copies their formula entirely. That's one of the reasons Bad Teacher isn't able to achieve being more than a decent comedy; it's never really able to walk along on its own and piggybacks on other well known films and TV shows to try and get a laugh.

Do any of you reading this watch ""South Park""? Did you ever see the episode where Mr. Garrison decides that he wants to be a man again? While Garrison is off dealing with that, Cartman becomes the teacher. He lets all the kids cheat on the test, they all test higher than the school ever has in the past, and he's sent to one of the most troubled schools in the county to try and help the students there. He disguises himself as Mr. Cartmanez (How do I reach these keeeeeeds?!) and teaches them how to cheat to succeed. Bad Teacher almost channels this story verbatim. Elisabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) disguises herself to meet and seduce the man who's in charge of guiding the state exams. Once she knows what's on the test, she teaches her students only what's on the test so that she can receive the $5700 bonus. Meanwhile the rest of the film feels like a watered down version of Bad Santa if it was centered on a woman and was set in a middle school instead of a mall. Ms. Halsey hates teaching and mostly has her class sit through movies daily since she's off drinking every night, smoking weed in her car, and generally just not giving a crap about any of her students or the faculty she's surrounded by.

The cast is able to play off of each other pretty well. Cameron Diaz does seemingly slide into the bad teacher role with ease and her on screen chemistry with Justin Timberlake is more than likely due to their former relationship, but results in a few memorable scenes in the end. Lucy Punch is so high strung, energetic, and perky that you basically just want to knock her down and punch her in the face repeatedly just to get her to shut up by the time the movie is over, so I guess that means she played the role of Amy Squirrel to perfection. ""The Office""'s Phyllis Smith is pretty much the same character she is on the show with just a little more R-rated content added to her resume. The highlights of the cast have to be Jason Segel and Justin Timberlake though. Segel is the one guy in the movie that'll probably make you snicker the loudest while Timberlake has a few scenes (one in particular) that is almost really funny with Cameron Diaz. The song he sings is so ridiculous that you can't help but laugh. Whoever that kid was that kept giving Amy Squirrel that look of open mouthed disbelief in her classroom was brilliant, as well.

The storyline really snowballs into absurdity as the movie progresses though. You're basically rooting for the villain the entire movie. A selfish individual who puts herself before everyone somehow gets away with basically being a drunken whore, who breaks the law a countless number of times, treats her students and co-workers like garbage, and keeps her job without learning a lesson throughout the entire process. It comes off like she has to settle for less by the time it's all said and done. It's pretty crazy.

Bad Teacher is a fairly mediocre adult comedy. It tries to reel in viewers with its very open relationship with the raunchiness featured in the film, but it all feels really tame in the end and isn't nearly as over the top as The Hangover Part II or even Your Highness. The problem is there isn't much that separates Bad Teacher from other R-rated comedies out there. It feels very similar and run of the mill. The movie would probably be a waste of time if it wasn't for Jason Segel, Justin Timberlake, and the staring kid in Amy Squirrel's class. While Bad Teacher is amusing at times, it isn't outrageously laugh out loud funny and mostly feels like a rehash of something you've already seen.",1308873600,4,4516,4.496954933008526
4243987,3,B0041KKYH4,"The title Bad Teacher automatically brings to mind Bad Santa, another raunchy R-rated comedy from years past. The two films are unrelated and completely different in tone, but worthy of comparison as they both take the concept of someone who works around children and make them into despicable characters. The difference is that Billy Bob Thornton's Santa was an offensive, outrageous alcoholic who used the Santa Clause-guise as a way to rob shopping malls; Cameron Diaz's Elizabeth Halsey is just a lazy, superficial, and yes, bad teacher. It's been 13 years since Diaz starred in the mother of raunchy R-rated comedies There's Something About Mary and it's nice to see her return to this comedic setting where she seems most comfortable. I would've liked seeing her tackle a dark character, but the movie plays it safe with a light tone. Diaz is a capable comedic actress and she plays this role with great relish, but she's trapped in an uninspired story with a concept that's never fully realized and suffers as a result.

Elizabeth Halsey is a bored middle school teacher leaving her job behind to marry a rich man who will take care of her. The day she leaves her job, her fiance leaves her forcing her to return to work. Marrying a rich man who will take care of her seems to be her only goal, while her only activities seem to be drinking, getting high, and insulting anyone she can. She's poor, lives with a man she met on Craigslist, and her only friend seems to be her quiet, passive, and older co-worker Lynn (Phyllis Smith). At work, she usually arrives with a hangover and sleeps at her desk while showing movies to her class. This becomes a problem when dedicated teacher Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch), who is across the hall from Elizabeth, takes notice. While shunning the advances of the gym teacher Russell (Jason Segel), Elizabeth fantasizes about getting plastic surgery to attract the type of man she's looking for and sets her eye on the new substitute Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake). With a yearly bonus offered to teachers with the highest testing students, Elizabeth sees a way to exploit her job for her own gain.

Diaz is a natural comedic talent and she has a lot of fun with this role which, despite her efforts, is just not meaty enough. Elizabeth is vulgar, despicable, rude, and politically incorrect and so was Thornton in Bad Santa. The difference was that you could empathize with Thornton and there was an underlying theme of redemption that gave his depravity a purpose. You'll recall also that he was a thief who dressed as Santa to rob shopping malls. Why is Elizabeth a teacher? There is no reason besides the convenience of the plot. It's hard to accept that this woman actually worked through four years of college to get to this point. Since the writers offer no theme of redemption and no reason for Elizabeth being a teacher, there's ultimately no purpose for her being the vulgar character she is. It's vulgarity for vulgarity's sake. She's just an unlikable character; not unlikable in the sense that I didn't like her, but in the sense that you see no reason for the characters in the film to like her and, by the end, when she has ruined innocent people's lives for her own selfish gain, you're left with no one to root for. This hurts the film.

Much of the cast does a fine job and I liked the characters, but I wished they were allowed to roam in a more natural comic setting. Diaz is the driving force behind the movie and proves that she can still carry a decent comedy, but her comedy is frequently upstaged by the minor characters. Her character isn't because, while far from three-dimensional, she serves a purpose in every scene she's in. The minor characters are not so much characters as they are excuses, simply appearing at the convenience of the writers, but some of their bits work. Kirk (Eric Stonestreet), the roommate, scores laughs in all four or so of his scenes but is underutilized. Smith is a bit of a scene-stealer and her character is one of the few examples of consistent writing present. Lynn is so awkwardly unsure of herself, so passive, one of those teachers who is no different out of the classroom. I was waiting for the moment where she would get drunk or high and become out of control. When she finally does get high, the credibility of her character is not betrayed. Furthermore, her lines of insecure agreement with Diaz's vulgar affirmations are understated and all the more amusing. My favorite character is Jason Segel's gym teacher Russell, also tragically underused. Segel is one of those actors that can take a simple phrase and make it amusing with his delivery and even when spewing throwaway lines he's the most likable, memorable character. Amy Squirrel is the only character that has a purpose in the film besides selfishness and her character contrasts well with Elizabeth, but the writing ultimately fails her. Punch's performance is intentionally over-the-top from the beginning, but she bubbles over as the film progresses and seems borderline psychotic. She plays Amy as one of those peppy teachers who are so into their job that some students shake their heads in disbelief. Amy is annoying, but she's not a bad person and yet the film expects us to see her as the villain and be pleased when things go wrong for her. It doesn't work.

You'll see other familiar faces, notably John Michael Higgins as the dolphin-obsessed principal and Thomas Lennon, who both score laughs. The weakest link in the cast, I'm sorry to say, is poor Justin Timberlake, so good in last year's The Social Network and so stiff here. I would have campaigned for Timberlake to receive an Oscar nod last year, so I'm not sure what happened. Granted, Scott is just an air-headed, nave substitute teacher but Timberlake looks so uncomfortable and he delivers his lines so unconvincingly it sounds like he's reading from cue cards. Maybe he felt awkward working with Diaz, his real-life former girlfriend which would explain why they have absolutely no chemistry in the film. It's not important for their characters to have chemistry but in their scenes together Diaz is convincingly in character while Timberlake seems like a bewildered extra who has wandered onto the set. Segel and Diaz meanwhile have a good rapport, but it's not exactly chemistry as I didn't buy that they'd end up together because of Elizabeth's attitude and demeanor, but they do work well together in a scene.

The writers that I've blamed for much of the film's failure are Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg, who had a concept that could have been very funny and carried it out in a very by-the-numbers fashion. When the script reaches the point where Elizabeth and Amy are going back-and-forth trying to one-up each other in who can screw the other over more, it just feels generic and I suspect the two ran out of ideas. The script is passable, funny at times, and I applaud the way they portray the children without the stereotypical cliques, but some of the jokes are of poor quality and feel forced, while sometimes the bits of ""stupid humor"" just become ""stupid"" humor. The dry-humping scene is inexplicable. It may have seemed like a funny idea to the writers, but their execution of it and the translation of it from page to screen doesn't work. Quite frankly, some of the writing is really bad.

Bad Teacher could have benefited from a darker tone or at least some consistency. It's R-rated but it feels very PG-13 aside from the frequent swearing. I didn't dislike the movie and I found the hour and a half running time passed by quickly enough. I even admit I laughed several times. It's a light-hearted, but mean-spirited film that moves unassumingly to a predictable (and contrived) conclusion. This movie wasn't meant to change the world, there are moments that are hit and moments that are miss. I remember one scene of the movie making me laugh harder than all the others for a good few seconds, but I have no recollection of the scene it was. Bad Teacher is not a bad movie; it's just not a particularly memorable one.

4244101,5,B0041KKYH4,"BadTeacher is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and I could see it becoming a cult  classic, because it is so outrageous, and quotable. I don't want to get into a long review, just make this short and sweet. This is an outrageous comedy as I said before. So don't get all worked up when things are unrealistic. The supporting cast is strong. Well cast movie. All the characters are funny in their own way. I found myself rooting for Elizabeth (Cameron Diaz) because as bad as she is, in her own way, her nemesis, fellow teacher Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch) is quite hateful to Elizabeth just for the sake of being mean, and she thinks she is GOD'S GIFT TO TEACHING, FULL OF HERSELF.  The main plot of the movie, and what moves things along, is Elizabeth is trying to get enough money for breast augmentation and will stop at nothing. She does have one redeeming quality and you might not realize until the end of the movie. She is good at counseling people in her own abrupt way, whether it be a student in love with a girl that hates him: ""look, I can't keep sugar coating this for you"", and she lays it on the line, and encouraging Lynn her fellow teacher to have the courage to talk to some cowboys in a bar.  She does seem to grow up a little in the movie, but it's a WILD RIDE GETTING THERE!!!  Also, this is one of those movies, the more you watch it, the funnier it is. So much for short and sweet! Oh, and I must make special mention of the principal,played by John Michael Higgins, what an excellent comedic actor. He has been in  the mockumentaries of Christopher Guest. which are improv, Two of my faves ""Best in Show"" and ""A Mighty Wind""",1458604800,2,1657,4.298076923076923

4244107,2,B0041KKYH4,"I absolutely hated this movie, which is surprising, because I actually really enjoy movies of this kind. I loved Superbad, Knocked Up, Guidance and Young Adult, but this was total garbage. I didn't really have any expectations out of it going in other than hoping that it would be funny,  but it could not even do that.

I think it is because  the character of Cameron Diaz, Elizabeth Halsey, has no redeeming qualities about her whatsoever. She is lazy, mean, rude and manipulative and a nightmare teacher. But not in a cool, endearing way like Pat Mills in Guidance, who smokes pot and drinks alcohol with his students, but in this annoyingly detestable way.

Where you hope the Bad Teacher to be someone who pushes the boundaries of what's decent in a civilized society,  you find someone who is a callous, stuck-up bi_ch whose class syllabus consists of showing movies while she takes a nap. She is a gold-digger who only dates rich people and who steals money from the school car wash to buy breast implants so she can find a new man to take care of her.  In fact, her main goal in life is to earn or steal enough money to get herself ready so she can find a rich husband. She is rude, mean and incredibly unpleasant, and - given what I have read about Cameron Diaz in real life and how she treats her fans - I am not even sure she is acting.

The thing is, no matter how screwed up and a loser a character is, no matter how self-deprecating and damaged, he or she does have to have some redeemable qualities. Or, if they dont, like in Young Adult, then at least not try to pass that irredeemability up as comedy.

Bad Teacher failes on both accounts. There is nothing redeemable about her - in fact, the character doesnt even have an arc and there is nothing funny about this movie  You cannot get behind her even one bit and even if you tried.

In Young Adult, Charlize Theron managed to create a character you are invested in - or at least intrigued by  enough to want to stick around and find out more.  There was something very real, tragic and sober in the way Theron played Mavis Gray, the young adult writer who, as the film progresses, is stripped down to something so ugly, unappealing, hopeless, and, in some uncomfortable ways, a little relatable. She is never glorified as being cool or maybe misunderstood. Unlike Bad Teacher that seems so desperate in its attempt to look cool  - and equally blinded by that desire - that it missed the mark by a long shot.

In Young Adult,  you stand behind Theron's character her because you feel sorry for her. Because she reaches rock bottom and still doesn't learn her lesson, so to speak. Cameron Diaz's character, on the other hand, is just a boring, stuck-up c)nt you are rooting for to fail no matter what.  So in a way I do recommend watching this movie, if for nothing then to see just how truly bad and unfunny it really is.",1455840000,,2889,4.43289224952741

Elizabeth Halsey (wonderfully played by Cameron Diaz), a former gold digger girlfriend has to get a job to fund her happiness in a cup size. Russell Gettis (Jason Segel) plays the gym teacher who just watches from the sidelines as Elizabeth does everything conceivable to get into bed -literally and figuratively- with new teacher Scott Delacorte (decently played by Justin Timberlake). Teacher Amy Squirrell [gotta love a name like that] (Lucy Punch) is Elizabeth's competition for the affection of wealthy Delacorte.

4244200,4,B0041KKYH4,"Bad Teacher takes place in modern day schools. Elizabeth Halsey, a mid-20s teacher is a great example of what a teacher should NOT be, at the beginning. Ms. Halsey, having just been broken up with by her fianc, goes to work as a teacher, as this is all she has a degree in. She is lazy, plays only movies, does not interact with students, and sleeps through most of the school day. She works for the paycheck, as she needs it now that her fianc left her. However, as the movie plays out, Ms. Halsey becomes more sentimental towards her students and at the end eventually ends up being the schools guidance counselor. Although I feel as if this movie is completely for entertainment, it has some real and relatable aspects to it. Though Ms. Halsey is not an ideal teacher, there are characters in the film that are. Amy Squirrel, for example, is a very engaged teacher. She relates to the students, has fun, and teaches passionately. She even uses a goofy voice that engages the students and makes them laugh. Secondly, I believe that the students in this movie are relatable to modern day students. Some are concerned about their grades, some are bullies, and others are outsiders. There are noticeable cliques and groups. This movie portrays what it is like for students growing up and going to school in a public school system. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, comedy and all. I would recommend it and suggest that you look deep into what it the movies objective is. It has a number of underlying lessons about things such as bullying, teaching, how to treat students/teachers, etc. I believe it shows you good examples of what you should and should not do as a teacher.",1427846400,,1671,4.62962962962963

4244202,5,B0041KKYH4,"As the film opens, Miss Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is engaged to a rich guy she uses for his money but doesn't love. When she's finds herself dumped and has to return to teaching, an occupation she had no talent for or interest in; she passes the time showing movies to her students while she naps, drinks and does drugs at her desk. When she meets new rich substitute teacher Scott (Justin Timberlake) she believes to have found her new out of her nightmare job. When she sees a picture of his ex she gets the idea of getting a boob job to win him over from her across the hall rival Amy (Lucy Punch) who Scott already has a crush on. Realizing her procedure would cost over 9,000 dollars, Miss Halsey starts to actually participate in school functions with her class such as their class car wash. She also manipulates parents into giving her money for more school supplies and pockets it all. When she learns that the teacher of the class with the highest state test scores will receive a bonus, she changes the ways of her teaching styles from terrible, to slightly less terrible. This movie is not only hilarious but it is witty and attracts tremendously to teenagers who are in school and believe all their teachers are bad until they meet Diaz in this funny film.

4244256,3,B0041KKYH4,"Bad Teacher
 Bad Teacher immediately reminds us of Bad Santa, another alleged comedy of a few years past.  Both of them have as a premise a horrible human being who occupies a position of trust in society and uses said position ruthlessly to his or her own advantage.  Neither film lives up to the claim to be a comedy.  Bad Teacher ill uses the talents of star Cameron Diaz.  Diaz not only can stand up to any star currently working in the comedy realm but can deliver a fine dramatic performance as well.  In this one she plays a lying, conniving, selfish, booze and drug abusing user of people for her own advancement.  I found little funny with her character, in fact, quite the opposite.  She seemed to me reptilian and aphotic, cold, heartless and without light.  No wonder the writers had a hard time coming up with things to make us laugh.
 Let me say that Diaz does indeed sell the role.  We believe that she is exactly what the writers mean for her to be.  This speaks well for her as an actress if not for the comic writing chops of the scripters.  Jason Segel, as the school gym teacher who finds the flawed, sexy new teacher Diaz fascinating, plays a sharp, intuitive guy who has both patience and persistence.  The movie works through the bad personality traits of the Diaz character, balancing them against the good personality traits of the other characters.
 Justin Timberlake, at one time the real life love interest of Miss Diaz, appears as the prey of the focused gold digging teacher.  This is another role where Timberlake surprises me.  Silly me, I still think of him as the boy band singer that he once was.  At this stage of his life, he has become a perfectly respectable actor.  He is spot on here as the good natured simpleton who might well fall into the web of Diazs black-widow-like schemes.
 Also look for Molly Shannon from Saturday Night Live in a small role.  Noah Munck, the kid who counts his lawn mowing money with such vigor in the TruGreen TV commercials, also appears.  Lucy Punch plays the absurdly named teacher Amy Squirrel, a rival of Diaz for the affections of the dim but sweet educator played by Timberlake.
 The movie isn't funny, but it does work as a kind of transformational tale.  Just as the coward finds his courage in The Red Badge of Courage, so the relentlessly wicked Diaz finds the true path to goodness.  Fellow teacher Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch) reverses directions, moving from a goody goody to the dark side.
 Director Jake Kasdan also holds the responsibility for the also not funny and worse in Hollywood, the not profitable Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story.  Maybe we should hope he directs an adventure flick or a drama in the future.  Comedy is not his forte.
 This film rates an average three saw blades, but not as a comedy.  The acting of the major players holds this movies only redemption.  Director Kasdan will see this $19 million effort come into the black, for which he should give thanks to Segel, Diaz and Timberlake.  It is rated R for raunchy language and adult situations (but no naked people-only photos of same.)  It runs an also average 92 minutes.",1410739200,,3131,4.583783783783784

This character would be the perfect poster child for the NEA. When the character believes an investment in cosmetic surgery would help her achieve her goal into snagging a rich husband she comes across the idea of having a car wash to raise the money.

4244266,4,B0041KKYH4,"The 2011 comedy BAD TEACHER came out as America's war on teachers was in full force.  Okay, by ""America"" I mean the moneyed interests that control much of the discourse force-fed to the public via corporate media, people who'd love to take your tax dollars and, in this instance, use them for their private charter schools that may not necessarily admit your children.

With all that in mind, I wondered if BAD TEACHER would condemn those who teach in public schools but, thankfully, this pleasantly surprising farce ignores that witch hunt.  In fact, starting with the song that opens the film, the forgotten, albeit very good song by Rockpile, ""Teacher, Teacher,"" suddenly I realized I was in for a less-than-predictable comedy.  Less imaginative filmmakers would have chosen Chuck Berry's ""School Days,"" Alice Cooper's ""School's Out,"" or some other selection about school that everyone's heard a thousand times.

BAD TEACHER proves very funny, as opposed to stupid, unlike too many movies aimed at young adults. Cameron Diaz looks no fewer than ten years too old for the part, but she does such a great job I, for one, suspended disbelief.

As I write this in 2014, the war against public school teachers rages on.  Ignore the charter school gang's lies and pay attention to something much more worth your while, Cameron Diaz in BAD TEACHER.",1409270400,,1344,4.973214285714286

They highly recommend it as well.

I laughed all of the way through it, from the first scene to the last.  The characters in the movie are composites and chariactures of the strange teachers that you have experienced in school.

4244305,2,B0041KKYH4,"The only people who will enjoy this movie are horny high school (and possibly college) male students. Everyone else will likely think it is stupid.

Since most people already summarized the plot, I'll only give a brief synopsis: Elizabeth Halsey is a gold-digging middle school teacher who is about to retire and marry her fiance. After he dumps her, she reluctantly goes back to teaching. She is abusive and apathetic towards the students. She also abuses drugs and alcohol. There is a love triangle between Elizabeth, another teacher (Amy Squirrel, played by Lucy Punch, who is MUCH more attractive than Cameron Diaz), and a wealthy substitute teacher (played by Justin Timberlake). The school's gym teacher is attracted to Elizabeth, but she is not interested in him.

Elizabeth wants to get a breast augmentation (how classy) so she plans to embezzle the money from the 7th grade class car wash. The highlight of the movie was seeing Cameron Diaz in a wet t-shirt and short shorts. Elizabeth later learned that the teacher of the class with the highest state test scores would receive a bonus so she tried to adopt a more draconian approach to teaching, but that didn't work. She then stole the answers to the exam.

Elizabeth won the bonus. However, Amy suspected that she cheated. Meanwhile, on a school trip, Elizabeth talked to one of her male students who had a crush on a shallow female student. This caused Elizabeth to reflect on her own actions. Back at the school, Amy tried to get the janitor to open Elizabeth's sealed drawer in order to prove that she had the answers. However, Elizabeth told the principal that some of the teachers in the school were doing drugs and drinking alcohol on the job. When they found Elizabeth's drugs and liquor bottles in Elizabeth's desk (that was switched), Amy was transferred to the worst school in the district. In the next school year, Elizabeth became a guidance counselor and started a relationship with the gym teacher.

This movie had a lot of sophomoric toilet humor. It got old after a while. I initially bought this DVD because I have a fetish for attractive cougars, but if you just want to look at attractive women, you may be better off buying the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition.",1398124800,2,2248,4.8311688311688314

With target reset she finds the path is not clear as she has a rival Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch).

Will Elisabeth find the gold she seeks or is she destined to die with small frontal accoutrements?

4244309,3,B0041KKYH4,"This movie is just a no-brainer, want to spend a few hours forgetting about real life for a bit type of movie.  There is absolutely no reality in it whatsoever (I am a teacher), but some of the parts were funny, and made me wish that they were reality (the comments that she wrote on the students' papers).

Diaz's character is a very over-the-type stereotype spoiled money grabbing slut, low on any morals throughout the movie.  And she doesn't really change at the end.  And I actually liked that part.  There wasn't any real miraculous change in her character to create an even more fake sentimental ending.

All of the characters actually are caricatures of reality.  The dingy, clueless principal, the out of shape PE coach, the over zealous do-good teacher, etc.  Even the students are all stereotypes, but that's good.  Forget how it really is for a bit, and laugh at them.

The acting was good.  I liked Timberlake's nerdy rich kid (I liked the scene where he sings his ""song"" to his love).  I especially enjoyed Lucy Punch.  I was not familiar with her work, and she  stole several scenes in this movie as the antagonist Ms. Squirrel.

The only downside to this movie is that the men are all portrayed as sweet little victims, when we all know that in real life it usually works the other way around, with men doing the lying and cheating. Since this movie shows the tables turned and a woman acting more like a man, people don't like it. I loved it, very funny movie overall and I love to see a girl be strong, not emotional and insecure. Also, the movie was a box office hit when it came out, and there is a sequel in the works for 2014. There is even going to be a sitcom on cbs based on bad teacher.  Not sure how good the sequel will be, since at the end of the first movie, we see bad teacher turning ""good"". I can only hope they will make her bad again in the second movie.

I bet it would have done a lot better - by comedy ape standard anyways (the same ones who gave Nacho Libre 5 stars).

I thought the movie was clever, had a lot of 'lol' moments. I have watched it over and over again.

It's nice to see a movie where the woman isn't some church going piece-of-s***, and who is actually an important part of the movie. The 'bad teacher' in this movie is definitely not disposable nor forgettable. The other cast of characters though, of course, helped make this movie what it is.

4244376,1,B0041KKYH4,"American Pie and Horrible Bosses are ""raunchy fun."" Bad Teacher is raunchy but not fun. It looks to me like the intended audience for this movie is young teenagers, but the bigger problem is that it appears to have been written and directed by young teenagers, too. The entire movie is a repetition of the same one-line gag: The bad teacher, Cameron Diaz, says one vulgar thing after another. She's vulgar with her fellow teachers and she's vulgar with the kids. These are middle school kids and yes, she's as raunchy with them as with the adults. She's an alcoholic and a drug addict who keeps a large stash of drugs in her classroom desk and in her car. She sleeps during all of her classes, and on the few occasions she's not sleeping she's being vulgar with her students.

With the exception of one teacher - the gym teacher, a completely out of shape, unathletic, and fellow drug addict Jason Segel - all the other teachers talk and act as if they are lobotomized Pollyannas teaching Kindergartners. In an attempt to make Diaz' character more ""complex,"" she's not only vulgar but a major liar, gold digger, embezzler, thief, cheater, and extortionist. Hey, but men fall in ""love"" with her because she's hot. Apparently she's a teacher because she needs a job to pay the bills until she marries a sugar daddy. Why she chose teaching as a bridge to that goal is beyond all comprehension. She'd have to attend college for five years and then get her teaching credentials just so she could teach for a year or two before getting married and quitting? She hates kids and she hates teaching. Actually it goes deeper than that: Being such a shallow and greedy person she hates giving anything to anyone; it's all about what she can get other people to give her, by hook or by crook - or, by sex. Why Diaz, Timberlake and Segel agreed to do this movie I'll never know. There must have been a lot of money in the budget for their salaries.

Those of you who disagree with me and say I'm just a prude who doesn't like raunch, fugetaboutit, because I do enjoy raunch and I already told you I like American Pie and Horrible Bosses. And if I give it more thought I could probably think of more raunchy movies I like. And let me tell you something else: No matter what you've heard about the ""hilarious"" sex scene between Diaz and Timberlake, believe me, it's anti-climactic (pun intended). I'll admit that it's the funniest scene in this pathetically unfunny movie, but that's not saying much. It is not nearly as funny as Diaz' hair gel scene in There's Something About Mary.

Aw heck, no matter what I say you're going to watch this movie anyway, you poor saps. Just do yourself a favor and don't pay any money for it. You'll thank me later.",1372291200,4,2735,4.532388663967612

There is zero character development, I wanted to punch most of the supporting cast, and as far as being funny, it's only good for a snicker here and there. It's a predictable story about a gold digger seeking money to get plastic surgery. Parts of it are painful and the rest of it is just really stupid.

4244447,2,B0041KKYH4,"When ""Animal House"" (1978) and ""Porky's"" (1982) burst onto the cinematic scene, they ushered in the new genre of the R-rated comedy, a style of film so narrow that attempting to release an entertaining movie can be as challenging as a perfect score on the SAT's.  Unfortunately, ""Bad Teacher"" barely achieves a passing grade.

The film is cast well: Cameron Diaz plays Elizabeth Halsey, a golddigger who decides that teaching is an easy way to bide her time (summers off, supposedly short work days) while searching for a rich man to support her extravagant habits for the rest of her life.  She meets Justin Timberlake, who plays a rich school substitute that Diaz believes to fit her bill, but only after she can purchase breast implants. With her sights set on her male conquest, she moves in for the kill, in competition with a nauseatingly over-enthusiastic colleague, played to the hilt by ""Dinner for Schmucks'"" Lucy Punch, who provides ample perseverance for Timberlake's affection.

Though the actors understand their comedy, the plot is mundane.  That Diaz distorts going through the motions of responsibility within the school community (chaperoning a car wash dressed in Daisy Dukes, scheming to cheat on a standardized test to acquire the school bonus for the top score) to acquire the funds for her surgery comes across as ridiculous and makes one want to expel her for the remainder of the school year. By the time she realizes the predictable error of her ways, we don't care.  Only Jason Segel, as the gym teacher who sees through the transparent faade of Diaz's schemes, appears as a likeable character within this dimwitted academic institution.  Give ""Bad Teacher"" a C-;  it doesn't fail, but you won't consult it for any help with your homework.",1357862400,2,1766,4.96271186440678

It's the writing.  The story is diluted to show a minimum of outrageous stunts - most of them even turned to some sort of positive in this day of political correctness.  The highlights you see in the trailers are ALL you will see in the movie.  There really isn't that much bad behavior.  True to political correctness, the movie ends with her getting a soul, falling in love with the underdog, and changing her entire personality and outlook on life.  I wanted to puke.

4244501,5,B0041KKYH4,"It took me a few years and possibly the movie KNIGHT AND DAY and THE BOX to really see the amazing talent that CAMERON DIAZ really is. She's a riot and out of control in this movie. I love it!!!.

If you liked OLD SCHOOL, this reminds me in some ways of that movie as far as the sense of humor involved.

Cameron plays in this movie a teacher that will do anything for money. To hook up with the right guy and ultimately to put enough money together for boob implants.

As a middle school teacher she does anything in her power and succeeds. Probably the hottest part in the movie is the car wash where she is wearing short shorts and all the fathers of the kids are drooling down the river.

It is hysterical, I really have under estimated Cameron for a long time.

She rules and she's still hot after all these years and can pull any role you want, off. If you don't believe me watch THE BOX with FRANK LANGELLA and and you'll see a different actress you never seen before.

I hope she's here to stay with us for a while and doesn't think about retiring because there's a lot more fire left in that furnace for all of us the movie goes.

On another note, this is the first time I see British actress Lucy Punch(Amy Squirrel) that plays this bubble gum teacher...but if you google her in real life shes HOT too!! Great actress as well.

I'm not a fan of Justin Timberlake but he probably took acting lessons...great performance as a geeky teacher that both Cameron and Lucy fight for and in the end Cameron goes for the gym teacher that she wouldn't give him the time of day through the whole movie.

Bad Teacher is funny at times, but it could have much better. Considering the R rating, I expected it to be more raunchier like more recent comedies, like The Hangover, Bridesmaids, and 21 Jump Street, but instead the writers decided to play it safe.

4244523,5,B0041KKYH4,"If your looking for something funny to watch without having to think much, this is it. You want action, depth or tears, go watch Lifetime. It is that simple.

This is a movie about teacher Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) who has dreams of marrying rich so she dresses and appears this certain way to keep up this persona so she can get a rich husband. Her fiance dumps her and she winds up broke and back to teaching, She meet Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch) who is clearly gay and wants Halsey, but because Halsey ""doesnt eat muff pie"" Squirrel sets out to destroy Halsey. The Gym Teacher (Jason Segal) is clearly into her while Halsey is clearly into the new sub (Justin Timberlake) because he comes from money.

She smokes pot, drinks booze in class, subjects her students to watch movies, dresses totally awesome and has the greatest one liners ever. Last, she also cheats on the state exam. Eventually she buckles down and takes teaching seriously, but even that is for an incentive.

Here is the reality, teachers are not really like this. Schools and principals are not this oblivious.

Back when it first came out, the only review that I had read about it had been negative.  So, as I settled back to watch it, I wasn't expecting to be delighted and greatly amused.  But I was.  Very much so.

First off, the cast of this movie are all outstanding comic actors, and every single role was cast perfectly.  Cameron Diaz was nothing less than brilliant in her portrayal of an apathetic, demoralized, dope-loving lazy slob of a teacher.  It is pure joy to watch her subtle facial expressions as she deals with each new unhappy challenge that comes her way as she attempts to skate through the day with doing as little educational work as humanly possible. Diaz is absolutely fearless in playing this dissolute character.  I loved every minute of her time onscreen.

Everyone else in the cast gives Diaz full support, including the talented Justin Timberlake as her love interest.  Every character in the movie is amusing in their own unique way.  Just about every single moment of this movie entertained me.  The comedic pace never falters and the script is truly smart and witty.  This is not one of those ""dumb"" comedies that Hollywood loves to unleash on the public.  Very possibly the advertising campaign for this film misled viewers to expect just another film for morons.  I can imagine that the morons in the audience were distinctly disappointed.

""Bad Teacher"" is a wickedly subversive film that just may find a way into your heart, because it makes you feel so damn good.",1351468800,,1581,4.7153284671532845
4244541,4,B0041KKYH4,"Cameron Diaz, while not one of my favorite actresses to be honest, performs a pretty hilarious role in Bad Teacher. She's probably one of the worst teachers ever (or best depending on your perception!)

She humiliates, criticizes and degrades her middle school students and makes it a daily occurrence.  She tells one boy for example that he'll never get it on with a girl until he's 29 since he wears the same shirt 3 times a week.  Hey, maybe that's why I never scored with the ladies- they don't like it when you wear the same shirt everyday.  Oh now I get it. :)  She doesn't like this one female student either because of the high and mighty way she acts, so Cameron criticizes her rot gut cookies, the girls uptight tattle tale demeanor, and basically throws her out to the dogs.

So, why does Cameron Diaz even HAVE a job if she treats her students like crap and does nothing but plays movies for them all period because she's too drugged or lazy to teach?  Because just *look* at her.  Nobody can resist that body!  Just watch her moves at the car wash for goodness sake!

Of course there's one person that doesn't like her.  Another teacher played by Lucy Punch.  When Cameron has eyes for the new hot teacher, Lucy's character is willing to do whatever it takes to make sure Cameron can't have him.  Lucy Punch actually makes this movie watchable.  Cameron's acting is questionable and on several occasions doesn't even feel comfortable portraying this kind of character, but I do admire raw and offensive humor so the movie gets a free pass from me.

4244558,2,B0041KKYH4,"The best thing to say about this movie is that it mostly avoids the failings of so many of Hollywood's comedic efforts. In other words, it isn't a gross-out, genitalia-laden, bodily functions-heavy, everyone-act-like-a-thirteen-year-old pile of audience insulting stupidity. It does have a few unnecessary shots, but those are quick one-offs that, while totally unnecessary, don't torpedo things completely. The comedy is certainly crude, but at least they go for acerbic instead of infantile. Given how many puerile offerings are being made, I'm taking what I can get.

There's a host of vaguely familiar actors, but the best effort comes from the dead panning Jason Segel, doing his best Bill Murray circa the mid-80s as the P.E. teacher. Justin Timberlake never fully convinces me as the substitute the two main female characters vie for, maybe because he seems to be trying so hard in every role I've seen him perform.  Then there's Cameron Diaz as the main lead, playing against her normal cutesy characters as a slutty, ill-mannered, gold digging party girl who incredulously happens to be a public school teacher. The problem is that Cameron Diaz isn't Billy Bob Thornton so it was hard to buy her as the same kind of foul-mouthed loser he plays with such ease.

Bad Teacher isn't a horrible movie, although it will probably offend those hand-wringing, paranoid, Helen Lovejoy-types who find any movie in which children are exposed to anything adult as the first steps on the road to the apocalypse. If you aren't one of those people, however, you might find some laughs along the way. From a teacher's perspective, there were some funny moments (the grading of papers, overzealous teachers, parent orientation), but the story has a lot of holes that simply don't make sense or stretch credulity too far, and thus prevent the movie from ever getting off the ground.

Bad Teacher is tepidly recommended if you can preview it for free before buying.  2.5 stars.",1346544000,,1966,5.036923076923077
4244559,2,B0041KKYH4,"Cameron Diaz plays the eponymous ""bad"" teacher Elizabeth Halsey. And she is really bad. Arriving at school hungover, Elizabeth sleeps during the class (while students are watching the video of ""Stand and Deliver""). Being dumped by her wealthy boyfriend, the self-absorbed teacher is determined to get what she wants, that is, a handsome substitute teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), who has just started teaching at her junior high school.

This is a one-joke premise, funny in itself as an idea, but it takes a good script to turn into a reasonable feature film. To do so, writers Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky somehow thought it good to make our heroine shallow and cunning. Elizabeth wants money for breast-implant surgery to impress Scott, so what would she do? Car wash! When she learns about a $5,700 bonus awarded to the teacher of the highest-performing class, what would she do? Something illegal, of course.

I liked none of the characters in the film (including Jason Segel's teacher who keeps yelling), but that is not really a problem. Some comedy characters are not really likable persons themselves (remember Mr. Bean). The real problem is, unlike in better comedies, most jokes are not as funny as the filmmakers think, dependent on the concept of ""bad teacher.""

And those gags are not just lame; they are mostly like watching a cruel and nasty prank being played on an unsuspecting by-passer. Even Cameron Diaz cannot pull off the trick with ineffective direction of Jake Kasdan.

At school she is obnoxious, rude, and really the total illustration of what you do not want in a teacher.

Cameron's character is so shallow and such a gold digger that you really can't like her and Justin's acting is like a 2 hour Saturday Night Live skit.

What does she have to fall back on? Teaching. So she's back at school, trying to pick up the pieces and figure out a way to get some cash for a boob job, so she can hook another money guy.
The story, was, in a word, weak. Okay. Two words, incredibly weak. Weak characters, weak story, weak goal for character, weak dialogue, weak all around. Bad comedy. I don't think I laughed at all, which is sad. And it didn't have to be. She could have still been a money grubber whose butt got kicked and she turned it around to help the kids (which she does in a small way towards the end but it wasn't written strongly enough). I want to get hooked in to the main character, even if I don't like them, they have to be believable and I have to be interested in what's going to happen and what they're going to do. Otherwise, why am I watching?
They had good actors, just weak material.
I saw the unrated version, and I don't think a protruding object in one's pants, or a wet spot is funny. Perhaps, it's just me? Not sure. Now, someone like Robin Williams is funny. But this movie, not in the least funny.

4244566,3,B0041KKYH4,"As a comedy the movie does contain some genuine laugh-out-loud moments. However, anyone who was not terribly impressed with the commercials should be forewarned that the film is equally unimpressive. We begin with Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz,) a beauty who is beginning to feel her youth slipping away, and who attempts to fill the void in her life through drugs and shopping. Teaching was a profession which she fell into more so than anything, and consequently her attitude toward education is one of apathy. After a rocky beginning (her husband and his mother kick Elizabeth out of the house) she finds herself trading a sports car for a rice burner, as she drive drives back to JAMS (John Adams Middle School,) where, ironically enough, she had quit teaching three months before, having only been there for a year. Needless to say, her return to JAMS is not exactly thrilling to Elizabeth. She begins showing random movies which have class room scenes but which contain no educational qualities; all the while she is slumped on the side of her desk sleeping or using marijuana, or gazing with lusty eyes at the enlarged breasts of a supermodel. She herself, by the way, is squeezing every penny in the hopes having the operation done on her, which includes almost embezzling money from the middle school car wash.

It doesn't take long for a zany teacher named Amy Squirrel to get on Elizabeth's bad side, with superficially cutesy but threatening comments like ""I know that last year you skated by doing the who 'bare minimum thing...' but this year I just know we'll be more than across-the-hall-mates."" One the one hand, Amy is a stereotypical Hollywood portrayed educator who uses touchy-freely talk to work out problems and help students. Being somewhat eccentric, however, she treats faculty in much the same way that she treats her students, a fact which Elizabeth, who is brisk and businesslike, quickly comes to resent. What's more, Amy has a dark side, and underneath her I-feel-your-pain sympathies is a fiercely competitive and somewhat mentally unhinged teacher. Curiously enough, despite their very different world views, the two have in common their strong will and ruthless, Machiavellian methods of making each other miserable and using every one else as pones to undermine each other. So when a substitute math teacher Scott Delacourte (Justin Timberlake) who also happens to come from a well-to-do family in the watch making business, a classic romance triangle forms and the two women try everything to win him over. Scott himself is an offbeat character, embodying certain feminine features which, when played by Timberlake, are both  amusing and down right disturbing. Additionally Scott is weak and easily swayed, thus allowing for plenty of manipulation by both Amy and Elizabeth. On the outside of the triangle is Russel Gettis (Jason Segel,) a gym teacher at JAMS who, despite his crude comments and stalker-esque behavior, actually has feelings for Elizabeth, as is later shown by the fact that he thinks her body is just fine and that she doesn't need the operation to make her look beautiful.

Elizabeth gets into plenty of sticky situations throughout the school year which will give the audience something to laugh about, including stealing Amy's theater class Little Orphan Annie wig and pretending to be a reporter to gain access to the forthcoming state scholastic tests (and getting a state official drunk,) speeding out of the school parking lot while blaring Black Sabbath, rubbing poison oak on an apple as a ""gift"" for Amy, and much more. Additionally, she wears, as Amy says ""provacative beach ware,"" to the middle car wash, looking like one of the beauties posing for Sports Illustrated more than a teacher at a car wash. We also meet an assortment of other characters, including Elizabeth's odd roommate who she later uses to blackmail the aforementioned state official. There is also the JAMS principal, who has a special place in his heart (and office!) for all things dolphin, thus playing on the stereotype of the progressive, bleeding heart principal.

Yet, as with all somewhat substantive comedies, the movie has its heartfelt moments, too, echoing the same limited substance of the American Pie franchise in its both tender and serious moments. We see that there are times when Elizabeth feels a connection with some of her students, particularly near the end of the movie, in which we see that she isn't a bad apple after all, despite her shortcomings and bad choices in so many areas. In her own way, she brings her own brand of realism to the table, helping some of the kids re-assess themselves. One of her students, Sasha, is a people-pleaser whose parents pressure her and desire that she aspire to high political office. Though Elizabeth's advice that Sasha should look into massage therapy instead is a bit heavy-handed, uncalled for, and cynical, the scene demonstrates Elizabeth's sense regarding the differences between hopes and dreams on the one hand, and real prospects on the other. Another example in which demonstrates she is not altogether apathetic about her students is seen in her lecture to one of the boys who has had an unrequited and hopeless crush on a classmate, Chance. It is here, perhaps for the first time, that Elizabeth demonstrates a disgust for her own superficial attempts to land marriage and money with Scott. She sees in herself the egoism of Chance, and she admonishes the male student to look for someone who can really appreciate his sensitive soul and interest in poetry. Additionally, about halfway through the school year she learns of a scheme to make her breast augmentation dreams a reality, via the teacher's bonus competition which comes from student's getting the highest scores on the annual state test. In one of the more touching elements about this film, we see an ever so subtle shift in Elizabeth's priorities as her interest becomes one of actually educating students rather than merely going through the motions. A final showdown with Amy occurs, and there are plenty of laughs to be had with that alone.

But all and all the movie was not successful. The acting was a up to par as one can expect from comedies, and Cameron Diaz really played her role well. But as a whole, while the movie did contain some redeeming elements, most viewers will find the unorthodox behavior and pervasive foul language use of the teachers in front of their students, simply too much. There is a scene in which Elizabeth writes ""stupid"" on some papers, and while this will arouse laughter from some quarters, others will not be so amused. One final interesting aspect of the movie is that it is a parody in some ways of the American school system. Pperhaps well apart from the intentions of its creators, it shows that despite the cliche idea of teachers as nurturing, progressive, and altruistic, they are often regular people who gripe about going to the office, are self-interested, and look to break up the monotony in life by resorting to the very juvenile behavior they are thought to be above.

4244567,2,B0041KKYH4,"If you don't recoil from the idea of a school teacher in charge of your children's education who smokes dope, lies, steals, manipulates those around her, uses movies to babysit her class while she sleeps off a hangover every morning and is totally devoid of any sense of professional responsibility to her students, then maybe you'll find this film funny.

The overriding conceit at the heart of `Bad Teacher' is the idea that the audience will somehow look past the reprehensible moral bankruptcy at the core of the central character (played to perfection by Cameron Diaz) and root for her, because she's good looking and has a few memorable one-liners so all can be forgiven. The character Diaz plays so well is dishonest, greedy, lazy, irresponsible, rude, utterly self-serving and in every way despicable. She is educating your kids, folks, and her manipulative, blackmailing ways win out for her in the end. This is funny, OK?

The film gets two stars rather than one because, on a purely technical level, it works as a (very improbable) narrative. The storyline is coherent and the editing snappy, the actors give their all, the script does have its moments, it's watchable. But somehow it's hard to get past the overall message the film leaves you with: if you're a selfish, lying, morally bankrupt, pot-smoking, drunken, money-grubbing whore willing to blackmail and deceive all around you whilst having complete contempt for any kind of professional responsibility to your students and their futures, this is in some way admirable. You will win out over more honest and responsible people, and it's hilarious.

4244586,1,B0041KKYH4,"I am a huge Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake fan, but even they could not prevent this movie from being an epic fail. This movie is just awful. I tried to figure out why, as I was watching it -- and there was time to mull this over, as I was completely unengaged in the stupid story -- and I came to the conclusion that it's not the actors' fault at all. It's a repugnant story to begin with, and an unfunny, soulless, pointless script.

Think ""School of Rock"" without a shred of wit or charm. Think ""Stand and Deliver"" (the movie this teacher shows in class day after day as she sleeps off last night's binge) without any drama, heart or morality. Cameron Diaz plays a hugely unlikable witch with a B, who hates everybody and everything, including kids. She's borderline abusive in her teaching duties. Of course all the good and decent people, you know, the good teachers, who enjoy their careers and love kids, they are of course made out to be morons.

So the main character is detestable, and her behavior as a teacher is unbelievable. What teacher sits in the car in the parking lot and gets loaded, even having a conversation with a student while hitting the pipe, and is allowed to just keep working as a teacher? She sits at her desk and ignores the kids, swears at them, mocks them, throws things at them...and these are young, middle-school-age kids. It is ridiculous, unbelievable, and disturbing, but on top of that, the movie commits the worst sin for a comedy: IT'S. NOT. FUNNY. I don't think I even smiled in in the hour and 15 minutes I gave this dreck before turning it off.

4244593,3,B0041KKYH4,"Let me begin by saying that I'm not a fan of the latest craze in movie comedy. For some reason the success of one movie that featured extreme vulgarity (THE HANGOVER) has resulted in numerous movies being released that seem to think the funniest parts were due to the rudeness of the language or visuals used. The fact is the funny parts commented on those items or around them but they were never the funny parts. That being said is BAD TEACHER a funny movie? In short, yes.

Cameron Diaz stars as Elizabeth Halsey, a teacher with little to offer. She's just marking time until she gets married to a rich available husband. While this is supposed to be her last year, her engagement collapses and she returns the next. Looking for a solution she decides that the reason she can't catch a top notch available male is because her breasts aren't big enough. She opts for augmentation but can't afford it and thus the main idea behind the movie kicks in, her trying to find a way to make the money.

At the school an overachieving teacher is found across the hall from Elizabeth. Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch) is that do gooder type person who is filled with all sorts of goofy sayings and feel good quotes. Yes, she's most obnoxious. And of course Elizabeth takes an immediate disliking to her.

Falling in between the two is new substitute teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) who happens to be the grandson of an expensive watch maker. The dollar signs flash and Elizabeth is ready to set her trap. Unfortunately for her Amy makes her move first and the competition is on.

While this is happening Elizabeth does her best to make it through each day failing to inspire or teach any student who happens to fall in her path. Instead she simply plugs in the TV and shows her class movies that involved teachers like STAND AND DELIVER and LEAN ON ME. When she discovers that the teacher who has the students with the highest grades in a state wide test wins a check for over $5,000 she makes the decision to start teaching and hope it works.

Complications and skullduggery come into play as well as a revenge seeking Amy. But along the way Elizabeth ends up helping some of her students. She helps them find their way through the terrible time known as Junior High. And she finds something more in herself as well. She also happens to unknowingly find someone else in the school's gym teacher Russell Gettis (Jason Segel). How it all ends makes for some funny moments.

So the story along with the numerous laughs interspersed throughout is the good part. What's the bad? If you were paid a quarter for every time the F bomb or vulgar word for breasts were uttered you would be able to fill a theater with patrons. For some reason Hollywood seems to think this makes it funnier. It doesn't and the shock value wore off on me back in Junior High when that sort of thing was funny. Granted there are occasion when the words can elicit some great laughs (think PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES or George Carlin's famous piece on the 7 dirty words) but when its just tossed in over and over it becomes annoying.

Diaz does a decent job here but she needs to rely on more than her looks to get her through a movie. While watching her talk about trying to save up enough money for plastic surgery one can't help but wonder if she's had her face done and if so where did that cash come from? Timberlake is showing that he can actually act and do a good job in comedy and drama. A Segel is a wonder, offering a subtle portrayal here of a goofy yet loveable guy. His is the most realistic portrayal of the bunch. Punch shows that she has the chops to pull of some great comedic moments and is someone I'm looking forward to seeing again. After some great bit parts in some hilarious movies its nice to see her star rising.

All in all if you can get past the language barrier this movie is funny more often than not. But know ahead of time if you are easily offended then this is not the movie for you. For everyone else, sit back and have a laugh.",1332201600,2,4036,4.429919137466308

At school she is obnoxious, rude, and really the total illustration of what you do not want in a teacher.

Cameron's character is so shallow and such a gold digger that you really can't like her and Justin's acting is like a 2 hour Saturday Night Live skit.

But I still wanted to see it to decide hmm... is it as bad as what everyone on Amazon said it was? It turns out IT WAS EVEN WORSE!!! I mean we have this lazy, goldigging, trashy woman played by Cameron Diaz whose rich fiance dumps her, with the help of his mother, because they figure her out as a golddigger. Shes also kicked out of her fiance's house and with no where else to go and with no money to get a boob job she met a guy on Craigslist and shes currently living with him and you guessed it, GETS A JOB AS A TEACHER!!! This movie is rated R so if you're thinking of showing this to your children ages 13 and under I suggest you don't! We have Cameron Diaz dry humping a male teacher played by Justin Timberlake. And she is shown wearing provacative clothing at a car wash. WAIT FOR IT IT GETS WORSE!!! At this carwash you also see a boy having an erection when he sees his teacher in ""SEXY CLOTHING"" at this carwash. SPOLIER ALERTS AFTER THIS POINT-- In the end we have Cameron Diaz dump Justin Timberlake and get with the gym teacher that she basically treats like garbage through out the film AND WAIT FOR IT.... since she's no longer a teacher she works as a guidance counsler AT THE SAME SCHOOL!!! The END!!! This movie is disrespectful to teachers everywhere! But this would be a good movie to show to bad teachers so they learn WHAT NOT TO DO to be worse teachers than they already are!

Acting:F
Comedy: There was NOTHING funny about it!
Plot:F-
Movie overall A BIG FAT FAILURE!!!",1326585600,4,1790,4.264705882352941
4244647,2,B0041KKYH4,"She's a teacher and she's bad? Genius! How'd you come up with that? Give that man, or rather those men, gold stars. Yes, it took two men to write this script. And the result? I almost feel stupid typing it.

  Cameron Diaz is Elizabeth Halsey. An aspiring trophy wife whose hopes are dashed when her spineless fiance calls off their wedding at the urging of his mother and financial advisors. So she returns tail between her legs, to teaching middle school. A job she took because she believed it required little effort and offered a summer vacation. And, almost immediately, she discovers a teacher from a wealthy family trying to find his classroom. She makes her intentions very clear, though Scott, the teacher (played by Justin Timberlake) doesn't catch on. And soon her efforts appear in vain when Scott (Timberlake) encounters the ridiculously named Amy Squirrel (played by Lucy Punch) whose hokey goodhearted nature ranges from annoying to nauseating. In addition, Diaz's character maintains a friendship with the gym teacher (Jason Segel) based in shared apathy and sarcasm.

  Is it funny? It has its moments, but overall the comparisons made between this and Bad Santa are accurate. Bad Santa being the role Billy Bob Thornton liked so much that he played it several times in ""different"" movies as characters with different names. This facsimile, on the other hand, is tame by comparison in addition to being largely dependant on the looks of its 38 year-old star who really should've past this sort of thing.

4244724,2,B0041KKYH4,"Saw this on the airplane.

While the premise of a teacher who hates her students is definitely serviceable, I was annoyed by two things:

1.  In the movie, the teacher's supposedly brutal sense of humor was too soft.  She really should have been much crueler.  I think this is because the film was going for the wrong sense of humor.  It was going for the shock-joke nature of comedy, while it should have been aiming at a sardonic, ironic kind of humor.  I kept waiting for her to unload some nasty, soul-crushing comments on the students or other faculty, but instead she was just a paper tiger.

2.  While her character was well-sketched, she underwent a complete, unprovoked reversal at the very end that betrayed everything that had gone before.  Quite apart from the fact that that ending could be seen coming from a mile way, the movie hadn't ""earned"" it.  It felt abrupt, felt like they had just done it because her renouncing her big goal abruptly at the end of the movie and starting to love teaching was what was expected by the audience.  But the movie would have been tons more effective and memorable if she stuck it out through the end, got her plastic surgery, and then given everyone the finger at the end of the movie.  It would have been much truer to her character and the nature of the film in general.

In other words, ruined by a Hollywood ending.",1321660800,2,1370,4.516260162601626

They got into their parts and they brought their characters to life. I admire Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake, Jason Segel, Lucy Punch, and Phyllis Smith, just to name the major ones, for how well they pulled off the parts that were written for them.

Unfortunately, this collection of superb actors were not given much to work with by the writers of this film. I'm not sure if they wrote out a story, so much as they made a list of all of the things they found funny and another list of all the terrible and inappropriate things a person can do and then they tossed them together into what they thought passed as a screenplay. And then, unable to find an ending that made sense with their ""story,"" they took an ending from just about every comedy with a romantic subplot (girl and guy hook up; all of the sudden they start acting like better people) and gave it a small twist that isn't so much funny as it is random and confusing.

While there were jokes and moments that were very funny, the movie itself did not fit together. It feels more like a random collection of moments than a film. And those moments don't always work together so well. The plot is disjointed and plots are dropped or explained away so quickly that it's hard to know what's going on. As a collection of sketches, these could work. As a film, they just don't cut it.

The conclusion is much too rushed and unbelievable - even more so than the rest of the film - and nothing is really resolved. This is a movie that I could have skipped.",1321401600,,1676,4.3312101910828025
4244737,1,B0041KKYH4,"To all Movie Producers and Screenwriters:  If you're going to present one or more unlikable central characters in a movie, TRY to make them INTERESTING in some manner, alright? Goodfellas' Henry Hill is a more winning character than the skank Cameron Diaz portrays here! At least make her a likable rogue like Sgt. Bilko or self-absorbed but spunky and oblivious like Jenna from 30 Rock!

Cameron Diaz is Elizabeth Halsey, who is such a manipulative, superficial, crass, insensitive, thieving, bong-sucking, gold-digging sociopath that Lindsay Lohan would be embarrassed to be seen with her.  The principal and her fellow teachers are a motley collection of stereotypical nerds, dweebs, and Dudley Dorights right out of central casting. So, compared to this panorama of Mayberry expatriates, and recognizing the social Darwinism of the audience, we're supposed to ""root for"" Halsey because she's...well, because she's played by Cameron Diaz!  In school she calls an overweight boy ""Chubs"" before she lands a basketball (could've been a volleyball, though) in his face for getting a question wrong. Later on, Halsey gets invited to a student's family's home for Christmas dinner, after which (like a true sociopath ""responding"" to someone's kindness) she steals a glass figurine from their fireplace's mantle. Our heroine!

This might be defensible--the characters in The Usual Suspects were a lot worse (weren't they?)--provided this movie was at all FUNNY. If you're a mean-spirited middle-schooler that's discovered the dubious glories of foul language and want to see a once-hot-looking-but-it's-fading actress play a shallow creep, you'll have the time of your life.

But we can't have a ""bad"" character be the star of the story, can we? Especially if she's a teacher, right? We have to see some change of heart, and...she shows concern for her students!  But that's not only far-fetched (after the personality we've seen), but utterly PHONY. It'd be more plausible for Vincent Price as Dr. Phibes saying at the end of one of his kill-the-British-actors-one-by-one movies, ""Maybe gruesomely murdering people I don't like isn't the way to go--perhaps I'll volunteer my services at a hospital burn unit.""",1321315200,5,2206,5.358381502890174

She wants a boob job in order to land a dorky but wealthy substitute teacher and resorts to theft, extortion, vandalism and outright felonies in order to raise the money to pay for it. Seriously dedicated teachers and parents are portrayed as clueless simpletons that she is able to dupe with a smile and witty remark.

4244743,3,B0041KKYH4,"BAD TEACHER is not a bad movie; it's just not that good.  Cameron Diaz plays a teacher whose dedication to her job is hardly admirable.  She merely teaches to raise money for a boob job--she's self-centered, amoral, foul-mouthed--a parent's worst nightmare...but in spite of this she's somehow likeable--almost.
The movie does expose the oftentimes hypocritical side of education albeit stretching it to extremes.
In spite of some funny moments, the movie ultimately isn't truly funny, winding up a bitter experience.
Diaz is effective in her unlikeable role and other cast members give good support.  Justin Timberlake offers a humorous turn as a dimwitted love interest; Lucy Punch is on target as the uberteacher and Cameron's rival; Jason Segel and Phyllis Smith round out the cast.
BAD TEACHER avoids many of this genre's cliches.  There are no redemptive moments or sudden enlightening revelations.  The tone is consistent to say the least!
All in all, BAD TEACHER is somewhat guilty pleasure but doesn't inspire a lot of educational appreciation.",1320451200,,1053,5.281437125748503

4244755,4,B0041KKYH4,"First fact, I'm a teacher. Second fact, normally, as that teacher, I rip teacher movies to shreds because they are so unrealistic and, often, downright dishonest. Third, I had so much fun watching ""Bad Teacher!"" Finally, a movie about teaching that doesn't pretend to be realistic. In fact, the movie is not about a teacher, but about Cameron Diaz playing a teacher. There's a significant difference! And, as a big Cameron Diaz fan, I was delighted!

Director Jake Kasdan, going with the obvious stance of Diaz PLAYING a teacher, but NOT being teacher, touches on real life. Diaz and Justin Timberlake were a real-life couple for awhile. By juxtaposing a more manly man (Jason Segal, coach) with Timberlake, a very boy-like man, the viewer can easily surmise that Diaz needs a more manly man. In fact, her one ""intimate"" scene with Timberlake's substitute teacher character (substitute to the real thing), shows her boredom. It's that universal truism of a woman not knowing which man is really not good for her and which is. While Scarlet O'Hara did not get her man (at least, not in viewer or reader sight), Diaz's character does and we know it. By movie's end, when the viewer learns this, Diaz's character actually seems tamed, more womanly, instead of this unpredictable, wild force of nature.

One of the teaching issues made clear is that children need a steadying force, even if it is a bit wild. The cactus she carries into her new room obviously symbolizes her prickly personality. Yet--a cactus endures, just as Diaz's character does. Also, a cactus can provide sustenance.

As for the unrealistic parts: Diaz shows movies EVERY day for weeks and no one checks on her classroom? No one observes a new teacher? Middle school students don't complain to parents? Parents don't complain to principals? Supposedly urban/ghetto schools have no structure and no discipline-top down. I've seen so many of that type of movie that I actually believe that's how those schools operate.

Given her nature and tendency to self-absorb, I still like the advice she gives to the weird, geek boy who follows the most popular girl around. On a field trip he proclaims his love for this girl right in front of EVERYONE. As if that move will impress a popular girl! Diaz's character tells him first, to lose the geek hat he always wears (a trapper John type) and to give it up because the girl will NEVER EVER like him. Why so blunt? Because ""I was that girl--empty, shallow"" and interested only in those like her. Cruel? Maybe? Blunt? Oh, definitely, but information worthy. Move on with your life. It was great advice.

Because she wants to buy a pair of big ""ti__ies"", Diaz's character tries a number of money making projects, including inserting herself in a school car wash. She becomes a wet t-shirt, shorts, legs, everything and makes plenty. Are we supposed to believe that teachers really do these things? Maybe, but with a grain of salt. After all, she represents ""bad teachers.""

Academy Award material. Nope, not the film. Disgusting? Not really. Funny! Yes, I laughed out loud and it felt good! This is a comedy I will see again one day. That in itself is a pretty good recommendation! As for Diaz herself, she plays her character full-throttle. An Academy for Diaz? Probably not, as most awards go to actors playing exceptional, down-trodden characters. An award for a ""bad teacher""? Wild things sometimes happen....",1320364800,2,3420,4.877796901893287
4244756,4,B0041KKYH4,"2011 has been an above-average year for female-driven comedy, with recent films like ""Bridesmaids"", and ""What's Your Number"", proving to be the good and the bad. Today, we have ""Bad Teacher"", a Cameron Diaz film that falls somewhere in the middle of that spectrum.

It follows Elizabeth Halsey, a morally corrupt middle-school English teacher, whose plans to quit her day job, to be a kept woman, were derailed. She's not necessarily a bad person, in my eyes, but she really shouldn't be teaching. She drinks, smokes weed, and puts on movies for her class, on the first day of school. She plays films for her class about good teachers, like ""Dead Poets Society"" and ""Freedom Writers"", while she pours airplane bottles of vodka into her coffee mug, ignoring her students completely.

All of this is very funny to me, because this part of the movie is pretty well-conceived. Cameron Diaz gave a great performance, and proved herself to have above-average comic timing. She isn't to blame for where ""Bad Teacher"" went wrong. It leaves this viewer underwhelmed, at a film that should have been a lot funnier. However, it isn't necessarily a bad movie either. It's just never as funny as it should be.

Written by ""The Office"" alums Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky, the film slightly resembles a long episode of ""The Office"" - something that has a brilliant concept, and the fully capable actors, however, it never really comes together in the end. However, there are a lot of reasons why this movie did work.

One being that it makes pretty good use of the time that it's given. It runs about 90 minutes, on the dot, and it feels full and decently conceived. One big reason is Cameron Diaz, proving herself not to be just a pretty face, but something of a cunning comedienne. She plays one of the most detestable characters that American cinema has recently seen, however, the audience can't help but root for her.

However, when the movie approaches moments of golden politically incorrect humor every so often, it's not what it should have been. A standard has been set for R-rated comedy films in the past few years, by films like ""Knocked Up"", ""The Hangover"" and ""Bridesmaids"", showing that there's a new point-of-no-return for comedy. This involves raunchy humor, yet it proves every so often, that new comedic punchlines and ideas haven't run dry.

However, ""Bad Teacher"" shows us nothing we haven't seen before, recycling jokes from other (and better) movies. From a lame school car-wash scene, to a borderline degrading subplot about a boob job, there isn't enough good to outweigh the bad. As I said, it has its moments, but there aren't enough of those moments to make this a great film.

4244757,3,B0041KKYH4,"There are quite a few reviews up before mine so I'll try not to be repetitive. First off, you should know that, unlike most films released in an ""unrated"" format (usually meaning more sex and language), the ""unrated"" DVD of ""Bad Teacher"" contains BOTH the Theatrical Version and the ""unrated"" version. I did not see the film in the theater and have not watched the ""theatrical version"" here, but the unrated version contains nudity (only topless females - as the main character wants to get a ""boob job"") and lots of four- (and more) letter words. Even the image on the cover lets you know that the comedy is trying to ""push the button"".

The story gets serious (well, sort of) in the second half but all the characters are played as broad comedy (no, there is no pun intended here) and so none of it can be taken serious. For those looking for a nude (or partially nude) Cameron Diaz, don't look here. She wears a ""Daisy Dukes"" skimpy outfit in one scene (which even gets its own 3  minute featurette!) but that's it. Most of the ""shock"" is in the language. (Think Terry Zwigoff's ""Bad Santa"").

The bonuses are a bit skimpy with 4 ""blooper"" scenes (4 min.), six ""deleted scenes"" (3  min.), and a really dumb ""Behind The Scenes with Jason (Segel) and Justin (Timberlake)"" (5  min).

If you like films like ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" you'll probably like this. It's in the same vein; but not as good. For me, I'll watch FTARH again instead.

4244784,1,B0041KKYH4,"There is absolutely no way to defend this God-awful movie. It's script is something that could have come out of a high school special day class. Good comedy is based upon reality with elements of spontaneity, creativity, and the absurd. This movie is absurd period. The reason comedians such as George Carlin, for example, are funny is because they don't try to be funny; it comes naturally. The same is true with comedy in a movie. It's humor must have been derived from people who laugh at their own jokes. One of the teachers is given the name ""Amy Squirrel"" and she makes like a squirrel when introducing herself to the . I'm surprised the principal's name wasn't ""Harry Boyle"" and the vice principal, ""Mike Hunt"". In another contrived scene, as the bad teacher is giving sexy poses at a student car wash one of the high school boys is shown with a huge erection bulging through his pants. It's simply not funny.

Were I given the job of writing comedy for such a movie, I'd begin by choosing a believable concept. For instance, a sexy looking teacher who is unintentionally flippant; not outrageously saucy. I'd also change the entire plot. Finally, I'd give key characters more substance, a personality, an identification. This movie has none of than going for it.

Good comedy is hard to come by. What I consider to be first rate comedy movies are as follows (not necessary in any order): Mrs. Doubtfire, *M*A*S*H, Portnoy's Complaint, What You Always Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask, The Odd Couple, Grumpy Old Men, Some Like It Hot, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and The Hospital. There are many others, but these are ones that instantly come to mind.

The concept of the movie is ridiculous; an incompetent but sexy teacher's desire to get a boob job.  The script is corny. The scenes are dumb. The acting is amateurish. This is the kind of movie that would mainly appeal to teenage kids who rode the short bus to school. Although the movie is about 90 minutes long, I was able to watch the entire movie in about 15 minutes. That's because I had to fast forward through most of the scenes. I would be embarrassed to have been associated with the production of this film in any way. I'm even embarrassed to say that I wasted a dollar on renting it. If I could give this movie anything less than 1 star, I would.

Don't waste your money on this film unless you have a room-temperature IQ and are the type who laughs at train wrecks and traffic accidents. Even if you have only half a brain, this movie will surely insult your intelligence. You're better off spending your money at a bar or on a lottery ticket.

4244811,4,B0041KKYH4,"This was one of those times where the plot was somewhat formulaic, but because the irreverent writing, casting, completely inappropriate scenes, and unfolding of the story was not, it still worked. Cameron Diaz stars as a spoiled gold digger looking for a new man to ride to the top. Of course the hot guy she should obviously be with doesn't interest her, and she'd rather be with a hot rich guy.

So we kind of know how that's going to end up. But on the way there, you have cursing by unexpected people to unexpected people, in the wrongest of circumstances, not to mention Cameron Diaz' character lying, manipulating people, and cheating in the most morally bankrupt ways. If you are that person in your crowd who is just constantly behaving inappropriately, or you like to laugh at that person and the trouble they get themselves into, you'll like this. If you like TV shows like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, this will amuse you.

If things like pot smoking and clearly immoral and unethical behavior offend you even when obviously being put on for your amusement in completely unrealistic situations, skip this one. I laughed out loud the whole time, especially during the sex scene. But I like movies that are a little different, and push the boundaries of what is acceptable behavior. Sometimes this pushes a little too hard, but I'd rather watch films that risk this and be a tiny bit offended than be doomed to an endless parade of safe, tidy films from mainstream Hollywood.",1319241600,4,1491,4.7528957528957525

And secondly, I love raunchy comedies as much as the next guy. But this movie is far from that. It's just mean spirited. Cameron Diaz plays plays a very unlikeable lead. In short, she is a home wrecker, a liar, and a blackmailer.

Her pessimism towards a little boy is particularly unsettling. She shatters the hopes and dreams of one of her 6th grade students by telling him that he will never be able to get a girl to like him, because he isn't good enough. That is easily the low point of the film. And she also ruins the life and career of a very likeable teacher, by framing her for something she didn't do. Which again is not funny, it's just plain horrible.

The overall ""moral"" of the movie is that it does not matter if you have big boobs or not. You can get everything you want by being a nasty, manipulating, gold-digging whore.

There is no way possible way to spoil anything, as the movie spoils itself within the first ten minutes. It is saturated with negativity, and tasteless humor.

Bad Teacher is a movie with no redeeming values whatsoever, sends a horrible message, and delivers very few laughs. It is not enjoyable, or fun to watch at all. It's more of a chore and/or punishment.

So if you're looking for a movie where the underdog triumphs, and the bad teacher learns from her mistakes, then look elsewhere. This is not a movie I want to see again.",1319241600,14,1529,4.404255319148936

Of course, Diaz learns her lesson by the close of the film and settles for real over dollars...but it is a really fun ride getting there.

4244860,3,B0041KKYH4,"BAD TEACHER is a mixed bag.  [Possible SPOILERS AHEAD]

It features a talented cast, particularly the always-deft Cameron Diaz, that certainly know how to play comedy, and it contains several laugh-out-loud moments, but the film is, ultimately, defeated by its very premise.

There is not one likable character in the entire film.

Diaz plays Elizabeth  Halsey, a ruthless, wildly inappropriate middle school teacher who doesn't give a damn about her students or colleagues, and ""teaches"" by showing her class movies while she sleeps off the previous night's drunk.

Why wasn't this woman was fired months ago?

After her wealthy fianc and his mother dump her, Elizabeth is out to snag another rich husband and she sets her sights on a new substitute teacher (Justin Timberlake) who comes from money.  Unfortunately for her, Justin is more attracted to Elizabeth's chief rival (Lucy Punch), a triangle that leads to a ""war"" between the two women...neither of which we, as an audience, are rooting for.

Certainly there are moments in this picture that one cannot help but laugh at Elizabeth's outrageous remarks, but these awkward laughs are akin to the somewhat incredulous guffaws we give Larry David and his inappropriate actions on CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM.

Elizabeth may ""soften"" late in the picture, but she certainly doesn't change and nothing in the screenplay by Gene Stupnitsky & Lee Eisenberg really justifies her ""winning"" at the film's end.

Phyllis Smith, John Michael Higgins and Jason Segel co-star in the movie, directed by Jake Kasdan.

Extras on the DVD, which contains both the theatrical and unrated versions of the movie, include deleted scenes, outtakes and two ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes.

""Bad Teacher"" is simply one of those films that could have been better, but because it was so bad, it would be tough to know where to start fixing it.

Cameron Diaz plays a character with no depth (not surprising or even a negative for this genre of films...), no like-ability and yes, she's a bad teacher too - thus the name of the film. Supporting cast including Justin Timberlake as a cute, rich, but nerdy co-teacher, are good enough, but you keep hoping for better and never get it. The story too is so simple, it really doesn't allow any of the characters to be built into much more than sketches of ideas versus characters you want to either loathe or cheer for in the end.

4244877,3,B0041KKYH4,"Short attention span summary:

1. Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is a teacher with a mission
2. Unfortunately, her mission does not involve the well-being of her students, and instead of A's, she's focusing on getting a pair of double-D's across her chest.
3. Having had her meal ticket relationship deep-sixed, she sets her sights on the nerdy but wealthy new teacher (Justin Timberlake in full geek gear)
4. The gym teacher (Jason Segel) would like to show her his rope collection, but she thinks that he's rather limp.
5. Many R-rated, illegal and immoral shenanigans later, the movie ends without a moral, or a lasting impression.
6. Teachers may have been harmed during the making of this movie.

This is an adult comedy that should in no way be interpreted as having any connection with real life teaching situations.  Cameron Diaz is extremely convincing with her bad self, strutting around half-stoned in her Louboutins, and Justin Timberlake sends $exy all the way back to the dark ages.  Jason Segel's character is, in fact, rather limp, but well portrayed given his limited screen time.

Funny in many ways, not so funny in others, this movie makes no excuses for bad behaviour by educators, and by the end actually condones it.  However, it should be noted that this movie comes with quite a few laugh out loud moments, and the casting of Timberlake in a role like this is so bad that it's hilarious.

Here's hoping that you never meet a teacher like Ms. Halsey.

This is another movie that the enjoyment is affected by your expectations. The higher your expectations the more you will be disappointed. I'm not saying that this is a bad movie at all, it is still really funny, but with all the hype behind this one it fell short of what I was hoping for.

Jason Segal was great, and Timberlake was actually really funny in this movie as well. Overall, a funny movie that is worth watching, but just make sure you tone down your expectations. I give it a B.

Would I watch again? - I might.

While a teacher as bad is this would never fly in real life (or would it?...) I have met people who her charactor reminds me of. This was a very entertaining movie. Would definitely be a good date movie. I really enjoyed the growing chemistry between Diaz and Segel's charactors, and the hilarious finish to the scene with Diaz and Timberlake at the motel in Springfield. Another great scene was the car wash scene - sort of an homage combining Daisy Duke with the infamous Whitesnake video.

I'd read the mixed reviews here on Amazon before I went and wasn't sure what to expect.  Turns out I enjoyed it.  Perfectly good way to pass 90 minutes of time.  Certainly far more enjoyable than many other films I've had the misfortune of seeing.

No, it's not going to be critically acclaimed nor go down in history as one of the greatest films of all time remembered by future generations.  But I sure don't care.  I just wanted an enjoyable comedy and this certainly gave me what I wanted.

In addition to being funny, it was actually rather sweet how Diaz's character comes to finds that love is more important than money, falling in love with a low-paid teacher who will never give her the vast pile of cash she previously thought so vital.

4244898,3,B0041KKYH4,"Hollywood has often elicited laughs from broad characterizations of teachers who would never last two days in public education.  ""Bad Teacher"" is just such a movie.  Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) has just completed her first (and what she hopes is her last) year of teaching at John Adams Middle School.  Engaged to a rich man, she anticipates a married life of luxury.

 However, he dumps her and she's back teaching in the fall.  Hardly the dedicated, hardworking educator, Elizabeth goes through the motions, doing as little as possible in the classroom.  Her new goal:  saving enough money for breast augmentation surgery.  This will be her bait for wealthy guys, she hopes.  The film focuses on the ways and means Elizabeth employs -- mostly unethical -- to raise the cash for her operation.

 When she discovers that a new substitute teacher, Mr. Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), is from a monied family, she sets her sights on him, but finds she has some competition in the person of fellow teacher Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch).  Amy is the poster girl for Perfect Teacher.  She decorates her classroom zealously, uses clever motivational techniques, and dotes on bureaucratic rules and regulations.  She is the complete opposite of Elizabeth.

 Most of the laughs in this R-rated comedy come from Elizabeth's outrageous, politically incorrect classroom methodology.  She curses, smokes, comes to class hung over, dresses far too provocatively, and has no inkling of the names of the children in her class.  Because the comedy is so broad and over the top, it can be enjoyed as a spoof.  It is by no means an accurate portrayal of middle school teaching, nor does it intend to be.

 Ms. Diaz is captivating in an unsympathetic role.  Her sense of superiority, her open disdain for students and colleagues, and her lack of effort make her not merely a flake but a selfish, thoughtless bully.  Yet we watch her make her way awkwardly through the day-to-day tasks of educating young minds, performing one outlandish faux pas after another, whether aimed at kids' insecurities, parents' concern for the curriculum, standardized tests, or a principal (John Michael Higgins) who must balance teacher squabbling with oversight from the superintendent.

 The rest of the cast also deliver some spot-on performances in ""Bad Teacher,"" which elevate it from merely OK to very good.  Ms. Punch is very funny as Amy, who starts out as a friend to Elizabeth and becomes her romantic rival.  Justin Timberlake is cast against type as a nerdy, bookish teacher who has recently had his heart broken.  Phyllis Smith (TV's ""The Office"") steals her scenes as Ms. Davies, a shy, middle-aged teacher who befriends Elizabeth and emerges from her shell somewhat as she learns how to have fun.  And Jason Segal plays phys ed teacher Russell Gettis, who is attracted by Elizabeth's considerable physical charms but put off by her behavior in school and the example she is setting for her kids.

 In ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,"" it develops that a popular, charismatic teacher is really a detriment to her students.  In ""Bad Teacher,"" we know that going in.  The jokes emerge as we watch Elizabeth Halsey navigate the waters of public education through a boozy haze.  One thing is sure:  as you think back to your days in middle school, you'll be grateful you never had a teacher anywhere near as terrible as Ms. Halsey.",1314921600,10,3401,4.957522123893805

I expected Justin's character to have a bigger part, but I was surprised by how much I liked Jason Segal in the movie. I was disappointed because I watched the redband trailer and in the movie some of the more vulgur lines were not in the movie that were in the trailer. Hoping for an unrated DVD release.",1314403200,3,543,4.271844660194175
4244900,5,B0041KKYH4,"For people complaining about how ""bad"" the teacher's behavior was in the movie and how ""teachers do not treat students like that"", this movie is called BAD TEACHER. ""Bad"" implies inappropraite behavior. It's meant to be a bit over the top and probably isn't likely to happen in real life. But this is a just a movie, so it's allowed to be exaggerated for comedic affect.

Anyways, having said that, being a huge fan of Cameron Diaz for her quirky characters and cute romantic comedies, i really couldn't wait to watch this movie. I admit that Diaz might not always play characters with much depth, but they are always fun and engaging. In ""Bad Teacher"" she plays the Elizabeth, aforementioned bad teacher, she drinks, uses weed, curses, doesnt teach, cheats, yells at her students and hits them with basketballs. But she also displays another side of her that is funny, determined, and isn't scared of a challenge. She's the anti-hero audiences end up rooting for.

Russel's (Jason Segal) plays the persistent gym teacher that provides another comedic element to the story. At first i was afraid that he was gonna be the whipped loser who is charmed by Diaz's character no matter how badly she treats him, but that ends up not being the case. He is not spineless and has a wicked sense of humor. His performance is on par with Diaz's. I have a feeling he's gonna be in the hollywood industry to stay.

Justin Timberlake plays Scott, a new rich substitute teacher. I'm not very sure why he turned to movies, and his character here is a bit one dimensional and slightly unlikeable, but at one instant very,very funny. He plays the role of the rich guy Diaz is trying to bag but we all know is he's not right for her.

Overall, this movie is perfect for an evening in with a bowl of popcorn and a huge can of soda. It's lighthearted, genuinely funny, and has the perfect (albeit a slightly predictable) ending. I just loved it! Even the snobby characters have a side that makes you feel sorry for them. A great main cast combined an equally quirky supporting cast makes a great movie for the summer!",1314403200,5,2096,4.611260053619303
4244901,5,B0041KKYH4,I don't understand how anyone could not like this movie. Cameran Diaz played the role to a tee. Justin Timberlake did a great perfomance as well and it was nice seeing the two together again on film (loved the dry humping scene!) Also as annoying as she was I loved the character of Amy Beaver not only because of how over the top corny she was but because I think we can all relate to someone similar to her character who has annoyed us at some point in time in our lives.

4244904,5,B0041KKYH4,"my main beef with the comedies of the last decade is lack of eccentricity in main characters. the ultimate concern is about making them relatable to the average viewer to the point that every new comedy that comes out is about the same stock character. bad teacher's elizabeth halsey is a welcome antidote and makes this the best movie i've seen in years.
she's a sociopathic social climber but too lazy and impulsive to hold up a wholesome facade. sees any expectation anyone puts on her as a nuisance to be only begrudgingly dealt with if it absolutely can't be ignored. the jokes really spring from the characters psychology and develop it rather than just being contextless asides. the central conflict between the bad teacher and the good teacher also derives most of its comedy from the good teacher struggling to maintain her own good-natured facade while seething with resentment over what she sees the bad teacher getting away with. which makes it hard to not end up rooting for the bad teacher, cuz at least she's not a hypocrite. that's what i found the most intelligent about the movie, the way it ends up making you root for the most obnoxious character by setting up all the more respectful characters as hypocrites and losers. i think its pretty realistic how the average citizens are shown to unravel rather than stand with conviction when faced with adversity. and hilarious.",1312934400,3,1392,4.828451882845188
4244915,3,B0041KKYH4,"As a brief summary, Cameron Diaz is a teacher who hates her job. She is happily looking forward to being able to quit (so as to pursue other interests, such as a breast augmentation), when her husband divorces her. Reeling, Diaz is forced to confront the fact that she is no longer wealthy by continuing to teach. It becomes apparent that Diaz's character is far from the most ethical and competent of teachers, as she simply does not care about her students' performance. What follows is the story of a school year in which Diaz first ignores then aids her pupils in an effort to win prize money which would allow her to win prize money sufficient to afford an augmentation in order to impress a wealthy coworker (Justin Timberlake).

On the whole, I rate the film as follows:

ACTING: A
 -Diaz shines in this movie for, really, the first time in a while. Timberlake and Jason Segal each add the flare that we are accustomed to receiving when they film. The interactions between the characters are believable and each embodies the role cast to them.

PLOT: C
-The idea of a ""Bad Teacher"" is a creative one, to be sure, but if you are expecting huge comedic interactions between Diaz and her pupils you will be disappointed. These occurrences, while present, are few and far between and, to me, made the movie somewhat less enjoyable.

COMEDY: C
-The comedy is raunchy, as would be expected. It's not a blockbuster comedic hit, for sure, but it will cause you to chuckle at points. Certain comedic points do seem stretched, and the lines of comedy are not as creative as would be expected for such high-profile actors. What comedy I found in this film came not necessarily from character interaction (which was more of a storyline) but from individual character moments. The group could have been a lot funnier together had the plot been more helpful in creating comedic moments.

FINAL REVIEW:

If you can rent this, then do so. I wouldn't necessarily buy it. At points it's good, but it had the potential to be so much better. Then again, everyone has different tastes in movies.",1312329600,2,2081,4.669398907103825
4244916,2,B0041KKYH4,"The problem with ""Bad Teacher is that she simply isn't bad enough.

Elizabeth (Cameron Diaz) puts in her time as a teacher at a junior high school, all to prove to her sugar daddy fiance that she is the marrying type and not really a gold digging viper. But her future step-mother puts a stop to the wedding and Elizabeth returns to the school unready and bitter about having to teach her classes. The job is now necessary to provide a living, a very modest living. The first day back, she runs into the new substitute teacher, Scott (Justin Timberlake) and quickly learns he comes from a rich family and recently broke up with his buxom girlfriend. Elizabeth becomes convinced the way to Scott's heart is by getting a new, expensive boob job. Elizabeth desperately comes up with an assortment of ways to earn, scam and steal the money for the operation. Russell (Jason Segel), the gym teacher, shows some interest in her, but because he is a gym teacher, making a gym teacher's salary, she couldn't be less interested. But he continues to make overtures. Amy (Lucy Punch, the stalker in ""Dinner With Schmucks"") is a good teacher, who takes great pride in her job, so naturally she and Elizabeth develop an ongoing rivalry. Then, Elizabeth's friend, Lynn (Phyllis Smith, TV's ""The Office"") tells her about a teaching prize, a prize Amy has won every year. Elizabeth has a new goal.

""Bad Teacher"", directed by Jake Kasdan (""Zero Effect"", ""Orange County"") has a handful of laughs, but just as it seems to be fulfilling the promise of the concept, it starts to pull back, as though the filmmakers are afraid to push the envelope too far.

Diaz's portrayal of Elizabeth is basically a one-joke pony. The teacher is foul mouthed and doesn't seem to care who hears it. That's pretty much it. Occasionally, she does something that could be considered 'bad', but these moments simply don't go far enough. The problem is everything is too easy for her. Once she gets an idea, it goes according to her plan. The complications arise from the other people around her. But because these complications don't really present much of a roadblock, everything seems too easy for her. Imagine if Lucy Ricardo had found a job she was good at, a job to earn the money for her new hat, if Ricky had let her into the show, countless episodes of ""I Love Lucy"" wouldn't exist. ""I Love Lucy"" is such a timeless classic because Lucy has to work very hard to get to her goals and they are extremely funny because she almost always gets in her own way. ""Bad Teacher"" misses a lot of opportunities to be funny because she doesn't have to work hard enough, there aren't enough complications.

In fact, the funniest moments come from Amy Squirrel, the character played by Lucy Punch, because she can't convince anyone that Elizabeth is a terrible educator. And, because she is complaining so much, the focus begins to shift to her and we start to learn things about her.

Lucy Punch played easily the most unfunny and annoying character in ""Dinner With Shmucks"", her previous film. Which is saying a lot. Everyone in that film was annoying and unfunny. In """"Teacher"", Amy has some vague similarities, but because her efforts are consistently thwarted by Elizabeth, she becomes desperate and a little funny. This goes on so long that everyone else starts to turn their attention towards Amy, dredging up her unwelcome history and turning a spotlight on her actions. And because of this, Amy becomes the funniest character in the film.

As Diaz is the star of the film, we want and need her to be the center of the story. She is the 'Bad Teacher'. She needs to be bad, to shock us. She sure has a foul mouth, but that is pretty much the extent of it. Maybe some people find this to be enough, but I don't. We need to see and hear more examples of how bad she is. If you are going to make an 'R' rated comedy called ""Bad Teacher"", really push the boundaries. Diaz and Kasdan don't do this.

The set-up for ""Teacher"" is funny. We quickly get why Elizabeth is a teacher, what she is trying to do and how she plans to accomplish it. But then everything in her life comes crashing down and we begin to learn a little bit more about Elizabeth. She is a truly desperate person and begins to come up with some ideas about how to get herself back on track.

Justin Timberlake plays Scott, the too-sweet, too-nave substitute teacher who captures Elizabeth's eye. She corners him and learns more about him. He could be the ticket to the Sweet Life. Initially, his ""aw-shucks"" navet is fun and so different from Elizabeth that we can't help but chuckle. And then he seems oblivious to the ongoing battle between Elizabeth and Amy, which is also amusing. But these ongoing situations only carry the humor so far. When nothing else is developed, the film dies quickly and resorts to the Timberlake staple; he starts singing an older song in a weird way. He has done this repeatedly, on ""Saturday Night Live"", in films, it even seems to be a part of his new film ""Friends with Benefits"". It was a funny idea the first few times. But it has now played out.

Jason Segel plays Russell, the gym teacher, and he also has a few good moments. When he initially makes a play for the bad teacher, he is quickly rebuffed. But this doesn't seem to faze him. Later, he does become miffed and decides to retaliate. Again, good for a few moments and then nothing happens.

This is the main problem for the entire film. All of the set-ups are good. For a few moments. But they don't evolve and take on new dimensions to continue to surprise us and entertain us.

""Horrible Bosses"", released two weeks after ""Teacher"", would seem to be ripe for the same problems and criticisms. But ""Bosses"" delivers on the ""Horrible"" promise. Each of the three bosses is very bad, for very different reasons. And each of the three actors seems to relish and enjoy the chance to push the boundaries.

In ""Teacher"", Kasdan and Diaz seem to pull back, afraid of going to that darker place. And because of that, ""Bad Teacher"" doesn't just give an 'F', it gets a D.",1311292800,3,6081,4.573921028466483

(She claims she caught him with the dog and peanut butter.) Teaching junior high gets in her way as she ""needs"" augmentations to be able to compete with all those Barbie Dolls out there. She uses movies to babysit her class. The gym teacher is interested in Cameron (she don't date gym teachers). Cameron in turn has her eyes on a nerdy substitute teacher (Justin Timberlake) whose family comes from money. He however likes Amy Squirrel.

Lucy Punch plays Amy Squirrel (as a red head) an overly perky teacher who becomes Diaz's school nemesis. Diaz helps the junior high car wash using moves she learned watching Paris Hilton commercials, pocketing some of the money for her ""t#t jar.""

4244921,3,B0041KKYH4,"I had fun watching ""Bad Teacher."" It's not a great film by any means, and I don't plan on repeated viewings, but it was enjoyable to watch once.

What's interesting about the film is that it's about a character that is completely morally reprehensible, and yet still comes across as likable. Much of this probably has to do with Cameron Diaz, who is just such a likable actress. She's a beautiful woman with a knockout figure and a mega-watt smile, and yet she's so goofy and willing to make fun of herself that even when she's playing nasty characters it's hard not to find her charming.

And boy is this character nasty. She's greedy, she's lazy, and she's selfish. She lies, she steals, she manipulates. What's also interesting is that the storyline of the repugnant central character, Elizabeth, does not fall into either of the two clichs that you'd expect from a Hollywood film:

1) She does not end up finding herself inspired by the children and discover a love of teaching, revealing a heart of gold hidden beneath her prickly exterior.

2) She does not find herself getting her comeuppance for being such an awful human being.

If anything, the characters in the film who are depicted as truly pathetic are Elizabeth's sincere, hardworking fellow teachers. Is this a dubious message? Perhaps. But the performers are all so funny and likable (Lucy Punch and Justin Timberlake are both hilarious) that they manage to make up for the film's many flaws.",1310342400,19,1459,4.796812749003984
4244922,1,B0041KKYH4,"Goes to show no matter how bad a movie is, there's still some senseless people that think it's good or were high on multiple meds. This movie was horrible (similar thoughts about Green Lantern). It was not funny, it was not witty or clever, and no way was it worth the ever rising theater price.

Everything was just plain boring and mind numbing-ly plain. Cameron Diaz isn't laugh-out-loud funny and making her the main character only made that fact clearer than ever. Justin Timberlake also stars in the movie, but the attempts to make the things he do or say funny failed. Only die-hard fans that would jump off a bridge if these two asked would root them on. Snooze-fest alert. Making Cameron Diaz the main star in a comedy type movie is almost as bad as when they put Gerald Butler in a past comedy movie with Jennifer Aniston as a couple, Bounty Hunter, which was a major fail. Gerald Butler in a comedy? Jokes aside please.

Now for possible movie spoilers to back up some of the stuff that I'm saying.

SPOILER ALERT!

1. Timberlake is a nice, fun guy. This movie, in my opinion, made him look bad. Not a funny kind of bad, but that of an insulting nature to the point where it was starting to disgust and annoy me. Maybe even to the point where one would ask themself ""maybe this is how he is in real life off camera?"" He received corny, stale dialogues and actions throughout the movie. Example would be at the bar where he sung that stupid rhyming song. I know it was meant to be funny and to poke fun because we all know he's a great singer, but I could only manage a mild awkward smirk. It just wasn't laughing material, it was sad really. Another mention goes out for the scene with them at the attempt of making love with clothes on, funny, but mostly awkward of the lowly nature. Trying a bit hard to get the laughs in are we?

2. You sort of get the feeling that the movie was steering Diaz away from Timberlake and more towards the gym teacher (whatever his name might be). However, there were no real strong scenes to show that. Her interest slowly switches but there were no strong scenes to give reason to that change. Sure they ended up talking to each other more, but that's pretty much it, small chit chats here and there.

3. The conflict between the main character and her rival is rather boring because if you think about it, they're both bad teachers who seem to pay more attention in getting at each other than their student. One's a plain out bad teacher and the other one is a closet psychopathic B. Now who do we REALLY root for? Of course Diaz since we know her better. It's more like ""which teacher do we hate more?""

The movie is not only NOT funny, but there's nothing to get out of it either. No morals, no real objective, nothing. It's movies like this that give further reason why people are pirating and downloading illegal movies more and more everyday rather than pay money to watch it. People are afraid to spend REAL money to watch a FAKE movie. It's more of a gamble nowadays to find a good movie in the theater and I might even add a bad gamble. I wouldn't even watch this movie with my enemy so why would I even consider bringing a friend? If a friend made me pay to watch this with them, I would have hated them almost as much as my empty wallet would if it could speak. Only I alone should suffer, I'm the guinea pig of movie watching.

Movie industry against pirating and illegal downloads? Solution? Make better movies and lower theater/dvd/bluray prices. Sounds simple but obviously very difficult or probably impossible. Making us pay top dollars for a crappy product...I'm pretty sure they're thankful to all those people out there that can't tell the difference between something of acceptable quality and total and utter crap.

I can be for certain when I say there's probably countries that are using movies like this as torturing methods.

SUM IT UP!

Movie failed cause of two main factors:
1. Boring plot littered with tons of worthless scenes that add little to nothing to the general storyline.
2. Actors that were NOT suited for the movie and therefore did not feel natural. Diaz as the main character to a comedy? NO. I love her and Justin, but they were not meant for this movie.",1310169600,18,4244,4.449163449163449
4244923,5,B0041KKYH4,"I absolutely loved this movie! I did not have high expectations going in as the last couple of comedies I've seen were full of bathroom and vulgar humor combined with hysterical outbursts which seems to be the trend in comedies these days. But I found ""Bad Teacher"" to be quite refreshing in that respect. I'm surprised at how many people find this movie to be degrading to women and teachers - as a woman and a former teacher myself I really enjoyed it and did not find it offensive one bit. I would highly recommend this movie!",1310169600,54,529,4.463917525773196
4244924,1,B0041KKYH4,"When I saw the commercials for this film I had high hopes, I thought the premise had potential, when I noticed it had an ""R"" rating I thought just maybe here is a comedy that has not been censored and ""Dumbed down"" for the 13 yr old movie crowd, perhaps it should have been because 13 yr old boys are the only people who will find this film funny. At several points during this film I actually felt both embarrassed and sorry for the actors for having to make this film, (I almost walked out halfway through it) it is chock full of some of the lowest grade humor I have ever seen. (Spoiler alert!!!) Did some producer actually think that a scene with Justin Timberlake (playing a clueless imbecile of a teacher) dry humping Cameron Diaz doggie style, then actually showing the wet spot in his pants would be funny??? All the best parts were used up in the commercials. Perhaps if they edit out all the low grade humor and bad dialogue they could take the remaining 10 minutes of film and show it on the art film circuit as a ""Short film"". Like I said the premise of the film had potential, it's got a good supporting cast, all it needed was a more intelligent script and better production values to make it a reasonably good summer film. I really hope Cameron Diaz makes a better film soon because her career is going downhill fast.  As much as I like Cameron Diaz as an actress, there is no way this film will ever make it into my DVD collection.",1309564800,23,1447,4.319852941176471

8412923,4,B0041KKYH4,"RELEASED IN 2011 and directed by Jake Kasdan, Bad Teacher is a dramedy about a slothful, inept middle school teacher in Illinois (Cameron Diaz) who hates her work, her pupils and her colleagues. She has no choice but to return to teaching after losing her sugar daddy and aspires to the lofty goal of getting breast implants. Lucy Punch plays her winsome rival while Justin Timberlake appears as a wealthy eligible teacher. Jason Segel plays the gym teacher whos interested in her while Phyllis Smith appears as her aged, overweight teacher pal.

Do you remember the bad teacher at your school? Every school has at least one, usually more. I found Bad Teacher amusing from beginning to end and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny. It helps that the characters are all well-defined & cast and that the story is absorbing. The soundtrack features some quality snippets by the likes of Judas Priest (Youve God Another Thing Coming & The Ripper), Whitesnake (Still of the Night) and Dio (Rainbow in the Dark).

NOTE: I saw the censored version, not the unrated one, which is likely gross.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour & 32 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal (Los Angeles & Santa Clarita) with exterior shots done in Illinois (Springfield & Lawndale). WRITERS: Gene Stupnitsky & Lee Eisenberg. ADDITIONAL CAST: John Michael Higgins is on hand as the principle and Thomas Lennon as a school official.
