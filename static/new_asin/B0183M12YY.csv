7539088,4,B0183M12YY,Creepy and interesting. It may be a little slow paced but If you just like horror movies it isn't perfect but follows a slasher formula in a dark way.,1453766400,,150,4.206896551724138
7539089,1,B0183M12YY,"The Jim Jones riff is tasteless to begin with, and the film goes downhill from there.  Rapidly.",1453766400,,95,4.588235294117647

7539091,2,B0183M12YY,"Wow, this movie sucked. Is there nothing anyone can do to make Jessica Alba act as if she has a pulse? And Thomas Jane, that I've liked in other movies, came across as a rabid D-grade actor who overacted to the point I wanted to choke him.",1453507200,,239,4.1063829787234045
7539092,2,B0183M12YY,"had such high hopes.. jeeez not very good at all. watchable, and Jane did a good job, but just kind of boring",1453507200,,109,4.0
7539093,2,B0183M12YY,"Nothing like an interesting story made uninteresting. Sarah Hope (Lily Rabe) as a child was the sole survivor of a cult suicide from 3/23/1985. Now as an adult she is returning to the secluded ranch (no bars, can't run to get help) with a camera crew who happen to be the larvae of the FBI men who raided the compound. Not to give away too much, but they locate some old film canisters (and 1 VHS) about the cult engaged in soul transmigration.

The individual scenes were done okay, but when placed together it somehow didn't make for a great film. Raspberry Award winner Jessica Alba will be looking to add to that list as Maggie who played a deer in the headlights for most of the feature. Hey! Let's capture that look and put it on the DVD cover! The male lead needed someone other than Thomas Jane whose charisma seemed forced upon us. Brad Pitt would have been too expensive, but Billy Drago, or heck even Billy Zane.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1453507200,5,957,4.431818181818182
7539094,1,B0183M12YY,"Deadly dull horror film about a documentary crew returning to the site of a Jim Jones style cult massacre from the 1980's looking for missed clues as to what might of really happened.  The screenplay by Robert Ben Garant (Reno 911; Night at the Museum) isn't without good ideas but, unfortunately, director Phil Joanu is no better of a director now than he was in the 1990's.  Joanu knows how to shoot attractive images and if there was nothing more to filmmaking he would be a master equal to Stanley Kubrick and Marton Scorcese.  Unfortunately, he paces his films like a 300 pound jogger with cement blocks attached to his feet instead of jogging shoes.  The Veil isn't just slow--it seems to be completely immobile.  At times Joanu can almost make Andrei Tarkovsky feel like Michael Bay--the idea that movies are supposed to be motion pictures seems to completely escape him.

It also doesn't help The Veil that Phil Joanu is pretty terrible with actors.  He got career worst performances out of Richard Gere and Alec Baldwin (in Final Analysis and Heaven's Prisoner's) and here is stuck with Jessica Alba and Thomas Jane, two actors who really need sure-handed directors to make them even halfway watchable in serious films.  Alba seems perpetually on the verge of slipping into a coma, giving a somnambulant performance without a trace of emotion--except for a brief scene where nails are being driven through her skin at which point she kinda/sorta expresses something that could be interpreted as pain, although by that point the viewing audience could probably show her how it's really done.  Meanwhile, Thomas Jane comes across more like a third rate Elvis imitator than a charismatic Jim Jones style preacher.

The Veil does have one pretty good third act twist up its sleeve plus a should be creepy ending, suggesting that in more capable hands it might have actually worked--although that's little consolation to someone unfortunate enough to sit through this thing all the way to the end without falling asleep.",1453420800,2,2024,4.943952802359882
7539095,1,B0183M12YY,"I am baffled that this one made it to the finish line. By the end of the movie, I had to ask my wife if I had fallen asleep somewhere down the line. It went from a Jim Jones styled cult-suicide at the opening, to a range of mysterious killings when a lone survivor shows back up many years later, to,
a feeble attempt at explaining the opening mass suicide to, gasp, a  ???zombie???  flick at the very end.",1453334400,2,406,4.1265822784810124

7539100,5,B0183M12YY,I think this movie is way underrated. The story is actually really interesting and fairly innovative depending on how you want to look at it. Kudos for casting the incredible Lily Rabe! I enjoyed Thomas Jane as well. Very creepy stuff. The concept alone is worth the watch.,1477526400,,273,4.708333333333333
7539101,1,B0183M12YY,"Horrible movie and I love horror stories. Don't even bother watching it. Great actors, awful script and ending",1471996800,,110,5.166666666666667
7539102,4,B0183M12YY,"This is the kind of movie that you cannot watch while doing other things, such as ironing or cooking, because if you don't watch every moment, then you will miss something, and you will be lost.  But, at the same time, this movie moved a little too slowly.

This movie was scary and suspenseful and it really made me think.  There is a twist, followed by a few smaller twists.  The ending surprised me.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves horror movies and thrillers, but you have to really pay attention to follow the story.",1469404800,,539,4.459183673469388
7539103,5,B0183M12YY,"Chaos, Souls, Skin walking, redemption. Pay close attention to the message of the movie. What did the cult leader achieve? What did he manage to do? He figured out how to do something so particular that we as humans were trying to figure out for ages.  His work was thwarted by ignorance. (in the movie)The ignorance cause a chain event that lead to vengeance. The vengeance is the downward spiral for the horror. Very well written. Very well made. I have noticed that if a movie does not gore the general public to death or jump scare them out of their seats every 5 minutes it has little merit with them. Movies that make you think are awesome. Think. I give it 5 stars . You want something out of it..pay attention to the details.",1469145600,6,733,4.42962962962963
7539104,3,B0183M12YY,"I didn't think The Veil was a masterpiece, but it certainly deserves more than one star. I enjoyed the story, but it got rather convoluted towards the end. Also, Jessica Alba in horror movies doesn't work for me. I thought Thomas Jane did a great job in portraying the creepy cult leader. All in all, definitely worth watching.",1467849600,2,327,4.655172413793103
7539105,3,B0183M12YY,Interesting subject.  Huge Thomas Jane fan!,1462924800,,43,6.166666666666667
7539106,4,B0183M12YY,"I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I did.  I'm always leery of movies that seem to take inspiration from Jonestown, the entire event was horrific and needs no help from fiction, but this one defiantly took it in a different direction.  I enjoyed this much more then the 'Sacrament' which was more of a scene by scene retelling of Jonestown.",1459987200,3,348,4.507936507936508
7539107,1,B0183M12YY,"Interesting concept, but then it moved slowly and ended with what I suppose was supposed to be a twist, but it was just a bummer.",1458432000,,129,4.2

8741314,4,B0183M12YY,"I'm not a huge fan of found footage horror, but this was a good popcorn flick.  The ""Jim Jones"" character was a little over the top in his deliveries, and probably would've torpedoed the film if it wasn't a horror flick.  My only complaint is Alba's wooden performance throughout, even at the end.  Maybe they should've swapped Shannon Woodward as the lead.",1501372800,,357,4.725806451612903

8741316,4,B0183M12YY,"I heard very mixed reviews of this one, but I found it scary and effective.  Great if you love stories about the weird little corners of America, family secrets, or just young people with cameras recklessly walking into an unknown situation to make a movie about it.  Features Thomas Jane in a role clearly based on Jim Jones, except this guy really does walk on water!",1495065600,,369,4.575757575757576
