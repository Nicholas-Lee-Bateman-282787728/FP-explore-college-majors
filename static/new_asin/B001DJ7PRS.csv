8293654,5,B001DJ7PRS,"I bought this for my grandfather (one of the oldest living UNC alums) and later bought a copy for myself.  You can't beat the price!  3 great games, including a spectacular come-from-behind finish.  DVD viewers get the advantage of the professional broadcast quality from the orginal network broadcast.

I loved it so much I even bought the ""Duke beat UNC"" DVD set too.  I hate Duke, of course, so I use those 3 DVDs as coasters.  At least that gets one copy of the ""Duke beats UNC"" DVD set off the streets.",1247356800,3,507,4.456521739130435
