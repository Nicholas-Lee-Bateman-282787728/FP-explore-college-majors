7874580,4,6304585411,"This is a low-budget, formulaic police flick.  The movie hits all the notes - cop is killed, wife worries about cop husband, new partner is hip and cool. Paint by the numbers.

Fahey can't give a bad performance because he is always calm and friendly. The other major characters are also played by competent actors. The movie is almost funny in some parts, and, for me, the weirdest, unintentional comedy of the movie is the fact that the villains are the members of a disco band seeking revenge from a rap mogul who sampled their tunes.  At the end, with the rap mogul kidnapped, the lead villain flips on a collection of disco tunes.

Disco?

I couldn't tell if this was intended as a major tongue in cheek element of the story for all that it was played straight.

It's an alright movie, particularly if you like Fahey.",1459641600,,822,4.52027027027027

7874583,4,6304585411,"I don't know why I wasn't expecting much from this movie; perhaps because it was made awhile ago and considered a B-movie, although I've seen other PM Entertainment movies and they were entertaining so this fit right in. It's nice to see movies made prior to digital special effects, etc. The story line, humor, character development and acting were good. The soundtrack by John Gonzalez/Spartan Sound and the songs he chose for various scenes are excellent.",1388880000,,458,5.0394736842105265
