7797073,5,1569382816,"I picked up ""Mysterious Britain"" at a local used book and video store...what a find! As a scholar of ancient and medieval English history, the segment dedicated to stone monoliths was of particular interest to me, but the entire tape is fascinating. In the segment on ghosts, both the recordings of a conversation with a supposed ghost in a former WWII hangar and of an unquiet spirit's deeply human sigh were chilling. And although the legend of the Loch Ness Monster has been repeatedly rehashed, ""Mysterious Britain"" gives a nice overview of the history of and research on this elusive creature. Check out ""Mysterious Britain"" if you are interested in the darker sphere of the British Isles, or unsolved mysteries in general...you won't be disappointed!",1156636800,,756,5.056
