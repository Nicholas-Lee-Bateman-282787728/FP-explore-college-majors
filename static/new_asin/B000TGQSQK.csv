8209165,4,B000TGQSQK,"North Shore television series is a captivating drama filmed on the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii.  The scenery is spectatcular.  The choice of actors was excellent.  The plot continued to become more involved and captivating.  I was very disappointed that this series was cancelled abruptly.  If you enjoy beautiful scenery, people, and surfing, this series is great.  I am hoping they will release a Blu-Ray DVD format to give justice to the spectatcular setting and people in this series.",1221004800,21,488,5.113924050632911
