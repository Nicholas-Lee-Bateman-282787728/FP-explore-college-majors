2308844,5,B0009PBLZE,Utterly amazing performance by the Airplane and amazing performances by the others. We are really lucky this film was preserved.,1190764800,,128,5.45
2308845,5,B0009PBLZE,"This is a little piece of history captured for our viewing pleasure...
It only makes you wish there were more old vintage performances available
on dvd... Cheers to eaglevision for keeping the past alive and relevent..",1189209600,4,218,5.083333333333333
2308846,4,B0009PBLZE,"this is an approx. 1-hour color videotape, 16-track recorded snapshot of February 1970 performances by these three bands at The Family Dog in San Francisco.  Originally produced at the time for public television broadcast; see the review entitled ""Amazing Performances"" for details ... also disagree w/ ""It's Not the 60's"" review comment:  Grateful Dead were still to break new musical ground from 1970-74 esp. after 1971 when Keith Godchaux joined on piano, as was Santana with even more jazz-oriented 1972-74 albums and lineups (powerhouse drumming from Michael Shrieve here).

for 58 minutes you'll be transported to a time and place in music which can't come back - savor it.",1188777600,14,679,5.2110091743119265
2308847,5,B0009PBLZE,"Glad to see they rereleased this dvd. Performances are great ,the music is right on,but it could have been a lot longer. Buy this dvd to see the great PIG PEN with the DEAD.Priceless.",1188518400,3,183,4.411764705882353
2308848,5,B0009PBLZE,"Beyond the film quality which is 1970's average at best, this DVD is Rock essential.  Santana, The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, the light show and hippie dancers is short in length, but still worth every penny.  SANTANA - Carlos Santana in recent years admitted the original band was his best.  They follow the Woodstock performance here playing two instrumetals proving they were no one hit wonders.  ""Abraxas"" was not out yet, so it was still a work in progress.  The musicianship is better than Woodstock, though not the fire.  Gregg Rolie, ""Chepito"" and the rest made this more of a group than in the later years when the guitar hero was backed by... ""Who's He Got This Year""? THE GRATEFUL DEAD -  Why was this band never the same after Ron ""Pigpen"" McKernan died?  He was the group's premier showstopper. Jerry Garcia was the leader, ""Pigpen"" the spark plug.  He lets it all go on the R&B ""Hard To Handle"" lifting the room to peak level.  The jam on ""China Cat"" is just a notch bellow ""Europe 72"".  Still doggone good.  The drummers sizzle.  JEFFERSON AIRPLANE - Jack Casady's blistering bass solo alone on ""The Ballad Of You & Me & Pooneil"" is something to watch and hear.  The guy is wired.  Grace Slick, vocals and Jorma Kaukonen, guitar are in sync on ""Eskimo Blue Day"" even though after the song, it's apparent Slick is loaded.  This was a great 60's band that splintered later into three parts.  The Airplane is better here than at Woodstock and Monterey.  THE ALLSTAR JAM is good only for watching.  Carlos, Jerry and Jorma seem to respect each other too much rather than trying to top each other.  Which band steals the show?  It's a three way tie, all having shining moments that will never again will be dupliated.  Now that ""A Night At The Family Dog"" is finally available, I hope next to follow will be the ""Fillmore: Last Days"" movie on DVD.",1188518400,54,1865,4.587878787878788
2308849,3,B0009PBLZE,"Musically this dvd is 5 star material, If it were a cd this would be a 5 star review.  Problem being the brevity and editing.  This dvd is much too short (about one hour).  The editing flaws include slo-mo shots of a chick hippie-dancing in a sheer dress w/out a bra (even as I type this I feel wrong complaining) the problem is it'll be during peak jams where I would rather see Jerry or Santana's hands or even facial expressions than borderline soft-core porn.  The material is great though, Pigpen on video alone is worth the price.  It's obvious the cameraman got into the ""special punch"" that night and just shot whatever the hell he felt like tripping on.  For completionists.",1188432000,10,683,4.557377049180328
2308850,5,B0009PBLZE,"Any fan of the Dead must purchase this DVD just to see the band rockin' with Pig singing Hard to Handle (complete with his gracious ""thankee"" at the end of the song).Then come the classic China Cat/Rider jam. Absolute perfection! Seeing Mickey and Bill on drums,a thin Jerry with black hair,Phil and Bobby front and center and in full support of Jerry's lead,and a ""healthy"" Pigpen is so awsome.
This is how they looked and sounded when I first attended a Dead show,and this is the most perfect film document of their early days. In full color,complete with dancing hippy-chicks,all you need is some good weed to complete this time capsule.

The Santana performance is also classic post-Woodstock perfection. I love their original band. Excellent latin heat from the acid era.
Speaking of the acid-era,enjoy the original Airplane in full flight. They were one of the loudest bands of that era,and Jorma and Jack provide their best of the that time. Also good harmonies between Marty/Grace and Paul. I loved that band,and I think they're over-looked today when people talk about rock legends.",1187827200,5,1091,4.961748633879782
2308851,4,B0009PBLZE,"I had no problem getting an unopened or re-shrinkwrapped copy of this DVD.  There is so little visual record of these bands, it is a must-have for fans of this era.  Santana cooks, the Dead chug, and the Airplane sound like nobody else but the Airplane.  The video quality is quite good, considering color videotape was only a few years along, and the extrapolated Dolby 5.1 Surround is phenomenal, since this was originally recorded in mono.  There is a sense, however, as a previous reviewer noted, that these bands were about to leave the period that had been their most formative and creative.  The Airplane degenerated into Starship, the Dead became a noodling nostalgia act for Haight wannabees, and Santana became, well, Carlos Santana.  There's a big messy""Super Jam"" at the end, where nobody can stay in the groove, and if anything symbolizes how the 60's ended, this jam does.  Still, these groups really said something in their time which has yet to be equaled.  If you liked these bands in your youth, this is a tasty fossil from this era.  If you weren't born when these bands were playing, well, too bad, this isn't even their best stuff.  But to paraphrase Bruce Springstein the night after Lennon was shot, if it wasn't for these guys, we'd all be someplace else.",1187740800,10,1279,4.746606334841629
2308852,4,B0009PBLZE,"Performances are HOT HOT HOT. Plenty of crowd shots, which I like. Only bummer is that this must have been shot on video and whoever put this out did not even attempt to clean this up at all... which is a real shame.  Somebody out there with some skills should have a go at fixing this and posting online somewhere.  Is that hot acid dancer during Airplane's set Marilu Henner?  Looks like her and she would have been about 18 but she was supposed to be in Chicago during this time I think.  You need this if you are a fan of any of these bands, regardless of quality. Oh Grace!",1187136000,3,578,4.18018018018018
2308853,5,B0009PBLZE,"These performances were actually taped at the Family Dog in San Francisco in February, 1970, not September, 1970 as indicated in the blurb accompanying the Amazon entry. The late Spencer Dryden was still drumming for Jefferson Airplane, and had yet to be replaced by Joey Covington, who joined the band in the spring of 1970, so that gives a clue as to the performance date.  I have a nth-degree-generation, very-poor-quality VHS of the original TV broadcast, which I saw at least a dozen times on PBS channels 13 and 21 in New York between 1970 and 1972.  The intensity of all 3 bands is startlingly good, and the bands are in fine fettle, but the gig represents a sort of swan song for the 60s-era-iterations of the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane, as both bands would change directions in the coming months---the Dead towards country/bluegrass/folk, and the Airplane towards its well-documented splinter into the Slickantner and Hot Tuna factions.  But, oh, the memories! btw, the JA version of ""The Ballad of You & Me & Pooneil"" that is part of the Family Dog show is also included in the recently-released ""Fly Jefferson Airplane"" DVD.",1136764800,114,1145,4.891752577319588

2308889,4,B0009PBLZE,"The two songs by the airplane are totally amazing. First Eskimo Blue Day, probably my all time favorite Airplane song. Grace Slick looks real uncertain, like she's tripping and having to really work to concentrate enough to follow the song. Jorma keeps looking at her and keeping her in the game and she really sings it well. Pooneil shows what a killer bass player Jack is/was.

What is interesting to me is despite being young and just into it what fantastic musicians everybody in the Airplane were even at that stage.",1379289600,2,521,4.725274725274725

2308894,5,B0009PBLZE,This one is special to since I remember when this was on TV public TV so when I saw it on did I had to pick it up. With this in mind you need to remember that this was done in 1970 and is not up to today's standards what you do get is a taste of three of the top bands from that era at their best. All three bands have their original lineup this is before all of the changes in years to come. Funny that all three are still active today but in a little different form Carlos is still going strong (I got to see him this past summer and he easy amazing). We now have Furthur who are stronger than ever (saw them this summer also). And now we have Hot Tuna who have been around the years with Jorma and Jack faithfully there. Each group on the dvd do two songs ( if you consider China Cat/Rider as one) there is a nice jam with all three bands at the end. Now back in 1970 to be able to see these guys on TV was a big deal. This does hold up well considering. It was a treat then and is still one today.,1361664000,,1001,3.7714285714285714
2308895,5,B0009PBLZE,I bought this for my dad for Christmas. I knew these were some if his favorite musicians from his heyday and he loved it. We put it on and rocked out while cooking Christmas dinner. You can even see Janis Joplin dancing in the audience!!,1357862400,,237,4.288888888888889
2308896,4,B0009PBLZE,"first, i am very impressed with the quality of the recording! to be able to see this historic event is awesome. now the review; first santana;5 stars; incredible performance ..  the entire band is way first rate,wow are these guys awesome musicans!!! can't say enough good things.if carlos played like this for 25 yrs. he would be one of the most popular bands ever.!!..next grateful dead; 4 stars;nice, but short set of period standards, but somewhat hard to follow santana and the energy his band put out;; still enjoyable for sure. love the girls dancing on stage.. groovy.. next jefferson airplane; 3 stars; seems to me you can already pick up on the vibe that splintered this band into 2 factions.jack and jorma absolutely smoke everyone else off the stage...man those 2 were amazing. that said the band chemistry is just not that good. they were a powerhouse none the less and thier influence in san fran and then nationally can not be overlooked.the jam is what jams used to be in the old days....unorganized but still fun... summary; a must see !!",1353888000,,1055,4.7650273224043715
2308897,5,B0009PBLZE,"It's amusing that any number of these reviewers state that one is looking at early incarnations of these bands. In fact, the opposite is the case. The Airplane and Dead (formerly the Warlocks) go back to the Summer of 1965 and Longshoreman's Hall-before Chet Helms and Bill Graham started up ""for real."" Santana, as the Santana Blues band, was first viewed by yours truly in the Fall of 1967 at the College of San Mateo. More importantly-much more importantly- 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969 had so much happening due to the, generally speaking, revolutionary intensity and consciousness transformation occurring, that each of these years was like a decade in today's wasteland. Dig it.

The gig, if memory serves me, was originally broadcast by KQED, San Francisco. KQED did a number of amazing PBS broadcasts, one notably in quadrophonic sound the night it was revealed that Janis Joplin had died during the day. For me personally, 1970 was the end of my attendance at the dance concerts unless Optic Illusion was doing the light show or a friend was doing the sound for a band. The scene was outside the tribe at that point, but...the major players: Grace, Jorma, Jack and the rest of the Airplane, Jerry and Pig and the rest of the Dead, and...Carlos, Michael, Chepito and the rest of Santana provide a very rare glimpse of these gifted individuals (all in their 20's still!!!) giving a good representation of themselves and their, for my money, immense musical talents. A very good signpost and indicative, to some extent, of things to come. All things being equal: a good flash of a tribal culture growing and reaching the whole damn world. Yes Virginia, it was even more magical than words can express.",1338681600,2,1707,4.845890410958904
2308898,3,B0009PBLZE,"If you love these bands, as I do and have for many years, there's some good footage on this vid.  But you really have to be patient and look for it, in the terrible, awful, horrid editing and production.  If someone with half a brain could get hold of the original footage, some great stuff could be done with it.  Santana is young, amazingly young and simple.  But great.  The Dead footage is very nice, although as someone who saw them many times in the early years, I can say, there's a lot better out there.  The Airplane footage is perhaps among the best, although one has to think, really, are these guys for real?  I'm a huge Airplane fan...but some of this looks so...contrived...(and the history of the band doesn't really refute that notion).  FWIW, Grace looks like she could use a good man in her life.  Ha ha.  She was cute, ya know.  And those guys...?  Ha.  But seriously, if nothing else, this is great footage of Grace Slick in an apparently good state of mind, young, pretty and talented...and surrounded by creeps.  Whatever.",1317600000,,1044,4.543010752688172
2308899,4,B0009PBLZE,"... the first is from Michael Shrieve, all of 21 years old, producing one of the finest drum solos during Santana's set (Soul Sacrifice).
... the second is Jack Casady's bass solo in JA's set (The Ballad of Pooneil).  The inventiveness is astounding - so much so that Grace Slick is brought to a near jaw-dropping standstill.
The Dead numbers are competent enough, but not exactly inspiring
I suspect the ""concert"" itself was arranged specifically for filming.  The cameras are pretty much fixed, and the ""dancers"" are too -I don't think there was a lot of spontaneity involved!  The film editing is good, though, and the picture/sound quality excellent considering the age of the footage.
A glimpse of the past that, musically at least, stands the test of time...",1317254400,,764,4.906976744186046
2308900,5,B0009PBLZE,"I actually sat through this start to finish and was supposed to be out doing work the wife assigned to me. I just got lost in it. These are good performances. One thing that really stood out is at least Airplane and Santana were at Woodstock and I think the Dead were too but my copy of the movie doesnt show the Dead. What stood out is how the songs were streamlined for the different venues to be performed in.

 I immediately noted the way the bands play the music in a much smaller venue and the music seems to be styled and of course sounded for the smaller gathering as it was inside and of course no match for the stage at Woodstock. I noticed this particularly with Santana's Soul Sacrifice. The drum solo by Aynsley Dunbar was a little bit longer here than at Woodstock but not near the heaviness. Even though I still very muched liked it.

Not much of a Dead fan but I did really like their performance all the way through. I have the first four albums of this incarnation of them so this set really appealed to me.

Airplane alas needs more room to breathe with all the talent in the band. So even though I like having their performance here, I much much prefer them at Woodstock and on the DVD ""Fly"" as another reviewer noted.

Very good would highly recommended and don't get on your high horse about the audio and video of the day, it is just alright with me.",1309219200,,1373,4.265384615384615
2308901,5,B0009PBLZE,"The DVD is great watching! If anyone is a Fan of either Band, pick this one up! If You are a Fan of any of the Bands on this DVD, AND give it anything less than 5 stars. I don't "" get it"". Sit back enjoy and ,"" Burn One"".",1306713600,,221,3.44
2308902,4,B0009PBLZE,"Early Santana is as much a visual experience as it is aural and this show certainly lets you appreciate it on that level.  Something about seeing the conga players hands in action, Santana's rhythm section in action is something to behold.  It's kind of funny watching Santana smoke (a cigarette?) as he watches his drum player work the kit during a solo.  The facials say it all. Santana's progressive latin rock jazz masterpiece ""Soul Sacrifice"" shines in this performance and it's great to watch the players ride it out.

Pig Pen's performance on ""So Hard To Handle"" is top notch, and I don't know about anyone else, but I wouldn't have traded in those shots of the bra-less hippy dancers for anything!  Perfect touch, and in slow-motion too! What would the Dead be without their inspired audience?

Actually, some of the dancers are stage-dancers and were probably paid for the show and this production - many are gorgeous and have been placed in ideal camera locations - it's doubtful they just popped in off the street.  They did seem somewhat out of place though during Grace Slick's performance - like, come on, Grace Slick is woman enough! She looked pretty good too, though we only see her sing one song (of course, only 2 are featured).

Besides the total of 7 songs from the above players, an 'all-star jam' with guys from all the 3 bands is included.

These performances are all great - too few - but great for what's there.  A pretty good showcase of the times, it's a stoney evening at the Family Dog for sure on this night in 1970.  DVD could be worth the purchase if the price is right.

I found interesting the Wikipedia write-up on Chet Helms and the Family Dog.",1285113600,,1681,4.604026845637584

I have to say that I was a little distracted by the long cuts to dancing girls since you don't really get to see that much of the bands playing. Not a huge deal, just a little frustrating. This dvd is fun to watch if you already love the music, which I do. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this dvd unless you love these bands and want a taste of nostalgia.",1254096000,,526,4.0673076923076925
2308915,3,B0009PBLZE,"While I would say that it is a great historical record of concerts at The Family Dog, it would have been much better if they had shown the hall, the surroundings, Ocean Beach, Golden Gate Park, and done a little more about the history of Family Dog and what happened to the production company. None of that happpens in this film. Chet Helms should have a long and detailed section in the film and there isn't much, if anything about him in the history of Family Dog.  All the concert ends up being is an incredibly abbreviated concert by three of San Francisco's, and Hippiedom's, favorite rock bands. The jam at the end is kind of a waste and really doesn't go that far. All in all, this basically is more for just the money than anything else. There's really nothing else here worth buying. Honestly, don't bother. It's too late for Janis, Pigpen is about to go, the end of the line for the Haight/Ashbury is months away and the Grateful Dead have already moved out of 710 Ashbury Street. Everyone has seen the writting on the wall. The speedfreaks have taken over (or about to take over) Hippie Hill and Golden Gate Park is fast becoming a dangerous place to walk through at night. Grace Slick is getting closer to the famous incident in Germany and she will soon have her breakdown. This could have been, and should have been, a much longer concert. KQED certainly held on to some of the tapes and there had to be more available to work with - they just didn't choose to work with it. One hour? This should have been two or even three hours long. It's a pity. But that's just my opinion. You might feel differently after viewing it. Carlos Santana is still incredible, Jerry Garcia is still fantastic, Jorma is still - WOW!!

I like them all.  Seeing two of the three bands live at different times was great but I didn't have a chance to see them in their heyday of the 70s.

The version of ""Ballad of You & Me and Pooneil"" is the greatest performance by the Airplane ever caught on film. And of course, Santana, -with his original lineup - is sublime. Don't hesitate on this one.",1200441600,2,573,4.572815533980583
2308920,5,B0009PBLZE,"I stumbled upon this Public TV one hour special in '70 as a feckless and un-radicalized 14-year old in the midwest. It was a monday night, I think. My parents were in the room. I sat and watched, and my mind was properly blown. I never forgot that bit of programming that came ... and just as quickly, went - Live From The Family Dog. A few years back I noticed it was ""out there"" ... but not quite ready for release. It was on my watch list in the blink of an eye, and now ... in my collection.
My initial impressions of the production hold true to this day, 37 years later; three outstanding bands, each in midseason form, playing stretched-out songs, with great sound and good visuals ... plus the hippie girls dancing ecstatically around the amps (yeah!), and the psychedelic light show, and the wild-eyed crowd, and the ""jam"" at the end of the night (what a wonderful mess). All in all, a high-water-mark testament to the Bay Area music scene as it prepared to devolve into something less delightful in the years to come. Watch it for the sizzling rhythm section of Santana, with the conga players in the spotlight. Watch it for Pigpen fronting the Dead as only Pigpen can, in HARD TO HANDLE. Watch it for the mind-melting Jack Casady bass solo in THE BALLAD OF YOU AND ME AND POONEIL, full of ritualistic thunder. Watch it for the Airplane all strumming hollow body axes (!?) Watch it for the Bobby Weir guitar solo on CHINA CAT SUNFLOWER. All in all, a great way to spend an hour.",1200182400,6,1487,4.410909090909091
2308921,4,B0009PBLZE,"The sound quality is great and the footage is mostly worthy.  There's a tad too much footage of dancers and the whole thing leaves you aching for more music, but this is a sound investment if you like any one of the three bands.  If you like more than one, you can't go wrong here. The ""Super Jam"", like most of its class, looks better on paper, but this is a fun musical exploration that doesn't get lost and it's great to see so many classic Bay Area musicians at their peak jamming on stage together.",1194998400,2,503,4.229166666666667

I have many other music dvd's, Roger Waters, Yes, ELO,N.Young. G.Dead Etc
All very fulfilling but these 2 song per band tidbit dvd's are in a way annoying allthough still very good.",1192924800,,211,4.552631578947368
2308923,3,B0009PBLZE,"I write this from the perspective of a deadhead for deadheads.  Okay, a night in a small club with a youthful trio of Santana, the Grateful Dead, and the JA, what could even compare today?  How many visual opportunities exist to see Pigpen put his signature on ""Hard To Handle""?  For these reasons, this is a must buy for all, and not even a second thought for deadheads.

Still, if you've listened (and watched) enough Grateful Dead in your life, you can tell the truly great nights from the good nights, despite any hype or advertising.  This was a good night, not a great night (at least for the Dead). The ""Hard to Handle"" is a treat with Pigpen in great (Workingman's Dead era) form, thinned down from the mid-sixties but not yet gaunt and sick from '72 until RIP.  Yet, within a year or so, the Dead would find magic with the jam portion of this song.  Simply listen to the Hollywood Palladium show from 8/6/71 or from their final show at the Fillmore East on 4/29/71 to hear what Hard To Handle sounded like on a great night.

More of the same with China Cat Sunflower/I Know you Rider.  This version is a good 1970 version.  However, by 1972 the Dead had taken the suite to a much higher level, and continued to develop it well into 1974 and later.

The Santana songs are quite good.  The highlight of the Airplane portion is the bass solo in ""The Ballad Of You And Me And Pooneil"".  Jack Casady was simply one of the coolest rock stars of his time and his sound and style are vividly on display.  This is Airplane on a very psychedelic night (as opposed to political night).

Then comes the All Star Jam... Well again, how many other dvds can you go out and buy that have Garcia, Santana, Kaukonen, et. al. playing together simultaneously on the same stage?  None, I believe.  Still, musically its not anything that would make the hair stand up on your back.  Its a lot of cooks in the pot.

Thirty-seven years later it is a joy to have this show play in our living rooms.  For years I owned a vhs copy of this show (I think bootlegged from WNET).  It is a surprise and pleasure to now have it on dvd.  However... they did nothing to improve the sound (like even get it to stereo, let alone 5.1).  Further, the artwork for the sleeve is funny, as they managed to get song titles and band names mixed up.

Go out and buy this dvd.  Just know the Dead reached heights much higher than this night - as cool as it must of been to be at the Family Dog that night.",1191196800,70,2467,4.27645788336933
