4219132,4,B003Y58CL2,"Sometimes we leave wondering why Verdi's opera was not titled PHILIPPE II, ROI D'ESPAGNE. On this occasion, however, we might feel it should have been called ELISABETH DE VALOIS, for the Queen is the most interesting and fully realized figure in stage director Nicholas Hytner's production (shared by the Met, Norwegian National Opera, and Royal Opera House Covent Garden; EMI's DVD is a composite of three summer 2008 ROH performances). Hytner and soprano Marina Poplavskaya have brought much care and imagination to the heroine's gradual progression from coltish, mischievous young girl to fatalistic, disillusioned monarch, and their work is persuasive. They make Elisabetta's every look, gesture, and attitude seem integral and supported by text and music, whether the choice is traditional or not (e.g. Elisabetta's helpless look back at Carlo as she is carried away in the celebratory procession at the close of Act I; the flash of anger aimed Filippo's way during the farewell to the banished Countess, a solo thankfully given its full two-verse due here; the sprinklings of pride and haughtiness amidst the protestations of innocence in Act IV Scene 1). Poplavskaya, as always, is a fascinating face to watch, and she looks show-stoppingly glamorous in a series of period gowns by Tony Award winner Bob Crowley. Even the changes in her coiffure from scene to scene tell us something of the character's inner life.

If the voice that comes out when this sensitive actress opens her mouth is not the sort we think of as that belonging to a ""Verdi soprano"" in the classic line, it is an interesting one in its own right, and it is the one belonging to the woman attempting the part. With adjustment for vocal category, the same could be said of other cast members. Both Simon Keenlyside (Rodrigo) and Sonia Ganassi (Eboli) must work hard for the high notes to which their music frequently guides them; each sounds most comfortable in the midrange. Keenlyside's portrayal seems unfinished. It is difficult to know whether stray tics and mannerisms we see, little smirks and squints, a curious rigidity of posture at baseline, are the character's or his own. At the Met, with a different eponymous tenor (Roberto Alagna) opposite Keenlyside, Hytner seemed to me to have encouraged a subtext to the Carlo/Rodrigo relationship that probably had not occurred to Schiller, Verdi, or the librettists, but is increasingly fashionable in modern stagings. For example, Keenlyside obviously was playing barely concealed delight when Alagna's Carlo began to confide his ""sinful love,"" and when the object of the sinful love was revealed to be Carlo's stepmother and not Rodrigo himself, the baritone played disappointment along with the usual shock and revulsion. This is less obvious on the ROH DVD. Ganassi is a considerable improvement over the unfocused, pitch-indeterminate Anna Smirnova, who replaced her for the 2010-11 Met performances, but Ganassi is another in a long line of mezzo-sopranos who lack the flexibility for the Veil Song. Her native credentials serve her well in terms of both style and delivery of text, but her deportment works against the concept of a glamorous seductress of the royal court; she is less than an ideal foil for Poplavskaya's elegant Queen.

Ferruccio Furlanetto has previously appeared on video as both the Grand Inquisitor (the 1983 Met/DG) and Filippo (the 1986 Karajan performance of the four-act abridgement, on Sony). Here, all that mars a powerful portrayal of the King is a tendency to depart from the sung line by shouting, modifying pitches, and cheating note values. I prefer to believe these are Furlanetto's crafty ways of working around narrowing resources, because if they are expressive choices, they stand out starkly against the greater portion of his contemplative work. Eric Halfvarson is also an old hand at the Grand Inquisitor (over a decade earlier, he appeared in the French-language Chtelet performance with the same conductor, also on DVD). At this point, so entrenched is the practice of casting basses who have the remnants of a voice as the Inquisitor, I no longer go in expecting to hear the musical line honestly, securely sung. This seems to have devolved into a character part, where stage presence, skill at declamation, and the ability to look and sound convincing as a 90-year-old relic are prized over absolute musical values. Within those strictures, Halfvarson does accomplished work. Robert Lloyd, having progressed in previous years through Filippo and the Inquisitor, completes his trifecta of this opera's bass roles by appearing as the Monk, and he is effective in the brief role.

The major liability, sadly, is Rolando Villazn as Don Carlo himself. This ROH run occurred between his first and second withdrawals from the stage, before his vocal cord surgery, but no knowledge at all of his medical biography is required to hear that he was in serious trouble and would have been wiser to cancel. When the music lies low and the specified dynamic is undemanding, there are reminders of the fine instrument with which he first appeared on the international circuit; but the voice is dry and lacking in polish, core, and stability, and the resulting performance consistently strained. With three dates from which to compile, the makers of the DVD have kept out major calamities, but the tenor constantly sounds on the verge of cracking, and any listener who knows where the music of this long and difficult part is leading, what hurdles lie ahead, is likely to be kept on the edge of his/her seat in the wrong way. It is unfortunate that Jonas Kaufmann's assumption of the role in the ROH's subsequent revival was not chosen for preservation instead. Villazn's fans are better off with the earlier DVD of Willy Decker's Amsterdam DON CARLO (four acts, on Opus Arte). Here, he hobbles through with a likable personality and not much more.

Antonio Pappano's conducting has matured since the previous Kultur DVD of an eccentric pick-a-mix edition (frequently misadvertised as ""the original French DON CARLOS""). The ROH Orchestra plays very well for him, and they are well recorded -- the high-quality audio and video are major pluses. Hytner's physical production has been controversial for its hard-edged, none-too-lavish scenic design (e.g. the bright-red ""Lego wall"" before which Eboli entertains the ladies of the court) and for the addition of an actor delivering spoken dialogue as a fanatical priest in the auto-da-f, covering Verdi's cornet solo (ceremonial music frequently cut altogether, it is worth noting). But the director is alert to character possibilities, most successfully in the handling of the Queen but also in the central confrontation between Rodrigo and Filippo, the motivations, conflicts, and agendas of which emerge with force and precision (Keenlyside and Furlanetto are at their best in that duet too, and everyone benefits from Pappano's clarification of the musical development). Hytner also attempts with some success to unify this sprawling work by isolating Carlo at scene endings, ""orphaning"" him on the stage by lowering a wall behind him that hides everything and everyone else from view.

My first choice DON CARLO/S DVD at the time of this writing (from a field encompassing both languages and several versions of the score) remains the first video of the opera released in any format, the Met 1983. This offers a generous performing edition (everything the ROH 2008 has, plus the rarely performed opening scene for Elisabetta and her war-deprived people), impressive orchestral playing under James Levine, John Dexter's evocative traditional production, and a cast including several great 20th-century singers in roles with which they were closely identified. Even if no one was having the best day of his or her life, they come out well ahead of most of the competition. The new ROH, more clearly a product of our present age in its state-of-the-art technical credits and its director's attention to matters of acting, is a respectable contender for the ""place"" position.",1311292800,11,8090,5.1725190839694655
4219133,5,B003Y58CL2,"First of all, Don Carlo is my favorite opera. Second of all, I am the worst of vocal curmudgeons, i.e. I love and long for Corelli, Bergonzi, blah blah blah. But as entertainment intended for the big screen television, this is superb. The image quality is first rate; the singing is mostly first rate. Villazon may have cracked live, but on video he is excellent. Poplavskaya is exquisite, maybe what Rethberg might have sound like if she sang this. Furlanetto is excellent. Keelyside is excellent. Ganassi falls a little short vocally. The production is gorgeous. I cannot recommend this too highly, so long as you are getting it for the totality that is an opera DVD, and not just as another recording. I ""replaced"" it with the Kaufman Blu-ray and re-listening it to it I realize its many virtues, an ardent Villazon, an exquisite Poplavskaya, excellent sound, not bad image. I even re-assessed Ganassi, not as wobbly as I recalled, though the mezzo on the Blu-ray is superior.",1296345600,30,979,4.833333333333333
4219134,5,B003Y58CL2,"This is the shared production with the Met with a different tenor and mezzo.  Rolando Villazon is superb (far superior to Roberto Alagna) and the singing and acting is what grand opera should be.  I saw it in performance at the Met this season and although I don't care for opera on DVD (who wants to see the singers' tonsils and perspiration up close), found this more of a movie.  Would recommend it to anyone who loves Verdi's greatest opera in the best possible production--modern set but not Eurotrash.",1294185600,5,507,4.674157303370786
4219135,5,B003Y58CL2,"This is a production that has been produced and shared by three different opera companies - the Met, the Royal Opera and a norwegian company.  It is very well done - the sets are sparse but effective and well lit; the costumes are sumptuous and in keeping with the depicted timeframe.  All of the performing artists are in excellent voice and are physically attractive as well, which is certainly a boon to any opera performance.  It was my first acquaintance with the Russian soprano Marina Poplavskaya and I was quite taken with her vocal beauty and prowess - she most definitely has a major international career to look forward to, which is most pleasing to know.  Rolando Villazon's thrilling tenor is in top form and very exciting to hear.  Conductor and orchestra offer sensitive and well-crafted accompaniment.",1294012800,9,817,4.934306569343065
4219136,5,B003Y58CL2,"I have in front of me DVDs of four productions of Don Carlo and/or Don Carlos. Such a plethera of riches! This is a new opera for me as in the 40s, 50s, & 60s it was rarely done. Thus it has been most exciting over the last twenty to thirty five years to experience the rise in performances and the critical esteem of this longest of Verdi's ouvre. Having witnessed this deveopment and experiencing several productions at the Met and Lyric Chicago, I have grown more appreciative of this magnificent work and the various problems that are inherent in producing it. It has become my favorite Verdi and yet this monumental masterpiece is flawed and unwieldy because of its size and breadth. Schiller's poem drama of great length was itself a tirade against tyranny both secular and religeous. His was a Protestant point of view so the Catholic Church comes off not well but it was the Hapsburg tyranny that is the real villain in the play and in the opera. The opera has some of Verdi's most evocative music and the singers have to be the best and able to cope with the very strenuous vocal line. Just thinking of Furlanetto' Fillipo singing ""Ella giammai m'amo"" brings tears to my eyes. I've heard a line of great basses do this from Christoff and Ghiaurov to Van Dam and Miles but to my ears Furlanetto is Phillip II. The same is true with all the major roles. But lets get back to this DVD. The Hytner production at the ROH and subsequently seen broadcast from the Met live series is the one on this DVD. Some of the cast is different and I think the better for it. Overall I was most impressed by the Hytner concept. I must say that I was so involved in the intensity of the drama on stage that I didn't notice much of the scenery. It was fine by me and not obtrusive. I think it imperative to have all the Fountainbleau act be complete to fully understand why Elizabeth has to say yes to the marriage to Phillip even though she is in love with his son. The peasants plead with her. She has already  encountered them and be friended them and it they not the noble people in this production that cause her to say ""si"". The Don Carlo of Villazon is adequate but no match to the Met broadcast of Roberto Alagna. Alagna appears on the du Chatelet version with the Posa of Hampson, a great pairing. Alagna is the best Don Carlo of the present time. Marina Poplavskaya is the Elizabeth and the more often I hear her the better I think she is. She was on the Met broadcast and is of great depth but reserved and very royal. The best of the day. (Her ""Tu che le vanita"" cannot match the Freni of 1982, however). The Eboli (whatever became of the eyepatch?) of Gnassi is adquate but on the Met broadcast Anna Smirnova did a better job particularly ""Oh Don fatale"". Again no match for Grace Bumbry of 1982 Met production under Levine. Simon Keenlyside is one of the great finds in opera in recent times. His Hamlet made me respect the opera. Now his Posa is the standard to match. He is trained as a lieder singer and it shows in the care of his enuciation and the care of each syllable. I still think the Hampson Posa of the du Chatalet production was more involved and more beautiful of voice. But Simon's star is still rising. All in all the Hytner production on this disc, even with it minor flaws is a great source of pleasure and appriciation of this great masterpiece. (But I wish it were the French version for it is a French Grand Opera)",1292630400,35,3438,4.355140186915888
4219137,5,B003Y58CL2,"This is my favorite opera, and, by far, this has become my favorite DVD of it.  Many of the singers (sadly, not Villazon) will appear in the Met's new production later this year.  I loved everything about it!",1288310400,13,208,4.447368421052632
4219138,3,B003Y58CL2,"I opened my set and put it in the DVD player with great anticipation although I admittedly was prepared for a bit of disappointment when I found out that Kaufmann was not to be the Carlos but the Villazon. Even so with memories of Pappano's great performance with the Chatelet forces this would surely be a superb evening in the theatre.

Alas, for me it was not so and on so many different levels I experienced disappointment. This production replaced the Visconti upon which an immense amount of praise had been lavished. It (the new production)is co-owned by the Met, ROH and the Norwegian Opera. I found the production unrealized and lacking in any sense of grandeur. At times it looked cheap and never evocative of the Spanish setting. The Bondy production was minimalist but one always had a sense of where you were. I wonder how Met audiences will respond?

Then there was the textual consideration. So much music has been discovered in the last thirty years and to ignore it seems to me to be wilful on the part of the powers that be especially since Pappano particiapated in the Chatelet production. True the Chatelet omitted the opening chorus which even the Met now includes, but why was the Act IV duet between Carlos and Fillipo omitted? The music is glorious and appropriate. So what we have is the version which has been standard for LP recordings. To hear all the music, sung in the right language one has to buy the Vienna/Konwitschny edition which includes every last note in a production which will offend many. The situation is not unlike Boris in which the musical director should decide what is to be omitted and what should be included. Don Carlos is a long opera and I have no love for the inclusion of the ballet which is ordinarily omitted. The Auto-da-Fe scene in the Vienna version is audacious and not particularly dramatic. The ROH version is also rendered less effective, although traditional, because of the inclusion of spoken dialogue on the part of the priest when he addresses the heretics. Whose idea was this?

And the singing? Villazon's Carlos was a very mixed bag. In the last few years tenors whose credentials have not included the word ""spinto"" have included this role on their CV. Alagna was subject to all kinds of criticism about making a foolhardy choice. He proved them wrong. His Carlos remains amoung the very best. Ramon Vargas in Vienna is another lyric who was canny enough to avoid the pitfalls of the role and come out a winner. Louis Lima another lyric apparently has not had a similar success. Villazon's vocal troubles are sufficiently documented not to be repeated here but he is clearly a weak link in a variable cast. he is not without imagination but Carlos is a long role, and while he has only one aria he is a major participant throughout the opera. Frequently he sounds at the end of his tether; there was a reason he did not return for the revival. The charismatic Keenlyside frequently seemed abstracted; one only has to compare his work with Hampton in the Chatelet production where he was involved and committed. Poplavskaya had been criticized for portraying the ""ice princess"", for having insufficient vocal thrust, for not being a spinto. Some of this is not without merit, but the role is a difficult one. When Milanov turned it down she was wise; afterall the aria comes in the last act; in the meantime she has to be a member of an ensemble in duets trios and quartets. Elizabeth's emotions are frozen since she is forced not to marry the man she loves but his father. A certain hauteur is required. My only criticism as regards the singing on these discs is her failure to sing any consonants so that much of the text is a vocalese--a beautiful one (exquisite pianos and pianissimos)but a vocalese nonetheless. Ganassi is another mezzo who stubs her toe in the role of Eboli. For a mezzo who has sung a great deal of Rossini one would think that her Veil Song would be a walk in the park. Well, it was better than Meir (Chatelet) but the small notes were barely articulated and the whole thing sounds effortful. O don fatale was somewhat better but her performance was essentially provincial. As an admirer of Robert Lloyd I am reluctant to comment. At 68 his vocalism  is not steady and his contribution only added to my overall disappointment. True, the role is small, but that is a specious argument.

This is one of the few DVD's where I feel that I have been let down by the photography. I will admit that one of the many pleasures of watching a DVD are the closeups of the singers. I would be the first to admit that this is not the way one sees opera in the house. Well, I am not watching in the house but in my living room and the advantage of the closeup is exciting. The medium is visual and most producers and directors and the individuals making the decisions realize that. Here we have very few closeups and many medium and distant shots and to a certain extent I felt cheated.

My last comment is one that will be of little import to most, but I must voice it: Don Carlos is a French opera; Verdi did not participate in the Italian translation. Surely the Chatelet production made that evident. Of course having two Francophone singers in leading roles and a baritone whose French is idiomatic were major pluses. The soprano may be a Finn but her French was more than exemplary. In the end this DVD continues to remain at the top and not without good reason. The singing, the style and the production all put it at the lead. This is not to say that there could be an Italian version equally as effective, but it will take a different kind of effort than the one offered by ROH.",1286323200,38,5669,4.574803149606299

8408661,5,B003Y58CL2,"This is an excellent performance, by each of the primary characters. The singing gets an A+, as does the period-appropriate costuming. The only odd part, about this performance, is the stage scenery. At times, its period-appropriate; at others, its modern/impressionist. At all times, its minimalist. I can accept the minimal scenery but the inconsistency draws away from the excellence of the rest of the performance.

 Villazn, as usual, is excellent and theres no doubt that the quality of his voice has already exceeded that of Pavarotti and that comes from a long-term Pavarotti fan.",1446422400,,588,5.24468085106383

8408663,5,B003Y58CL2,"I read the various reviews from the British press on this production and the one in which Kaufman starred .. I had not seen this opera before ,everyone has a missing link , and as others have written it is a superb story and continuously glorious music .. I found nearly all the performances quite faultless but was especially impressed by Marina Popavskaya as Elizabeth de Valois and Rodrigo sung by Simon Keenlyside . I saw the latter as the bird catcher in the Magic Flute and he stole the show and he almost does it again . I had two concerns with this production. The first one was the casting of Roland Villazon as Don Carlo , the tragic figure. I have seen Villazon singing at concerts and the outside production of la Boheme and he strikes me as a rather happy latino who can steal a show with Jurame or as a lover in Boheme. But Don Carlos is not for him except for the first scene as he is appears as a sulky figure rather than a as a tragic lover and infante . The other problem I had was the last scene . Several scenes earlier the King asked the Grand Inquisitor to forget the past conversation but the actual dragging of Don Carlos into the tomb by the dead King Carlos and the final walking out virtually arm in arm of the King and the Grand Inqisitor did not make sense ..It would have been so easy to fix and to have had a tidier ending.  Maybe this quibbling because what a fantastic opera, with superb scenes , a wonderful orchestra and choir",1419465600,,1461,4.255395683453237

I know I'm old fashioned, but a passionate grand opera really needs passionate grand sets!  The singing and the music wins me over all these minor problems.",1358121600,2,398,4.642857142857143
8408668,5,B003Y58CL2,"Winner of the 2011 Gramophone Award for best DVD - this Covent Garden performance of the five act Italian version of Verdi's ""Don Carlo"" is simply superb.

This ""grandest of all grand operas"" has long been special to me since I first saw the recording of the iconic 1986 Salzburg performance conducted by Karajan, with Jos Carreras in the title role.  That began a fascination with the historical Don Carlos - an enigmatic character of contradictions, if ever there was one!

Rolando Villazn's intense Carlos brings out a myriad of colours - exuberance, devastation, hope, despair, and the simmering undercurrent of resentment and rebellion which is finally his undoing.  It is beautifully sung, and I especially love the Fontainebleu scene which is so often omitted from performances.  His first aria is magic!

Marina Poplavskaya's voice is perhaps not as ""big"" as might be expected in the role of Elisabeth, but its crystal-like quality brings an air of deceptive fragility to the character, which belies her inner strength and defiance of the king.  Her transformation from eager girl to dignified queen is very realistic. Simon Keenlyside gives us a finely-sung Rodrigo. His calmness stands in marked contrast to the prince's volatility, and the unspoken bond of brotherhood between them shines through.

The perennial Ferruccio Furlanetto has to be the definitive Philip of our generation.  He also played this role in the Salzburg performance mentioned above - and here he is, 25 years later, still delivering the same excellence of vocal and dramatic portrayal.  Eric Halfvarson's Grand Inquisitor is pure malevolence masquerading as piety, and the late night scene in Philip's chamber throbs with tension, mistrust and the powerful singing of two duelling basses!

At first I was a little puzzled with the seeming lack of patent evil in Sonia Ganassi's Eboli, until I realised it was scorn, and not venom, that was her motivation.  This made sense when I thought of the real Eboli, married to a high-ranking Portuguese prince, perhaps considering the intrigues of court to be nothing more than a game - until she realised too late that she was playing with fire.

The auto-da-f scene is a show-stopper which left me with completely scrambled emotions.  On the one hand my heart lifted with Verdi's glorious music, while at the same time my stomach knotted with the visual horror of the burning victims.  The inclusion of spoken dialogue as a priest condemns the accused is unusual, but I believe it is historically accurate, and fits very well into the context.

The ROH Orchestra under Antonio Pappano delivers musical excellence as always, and the sets and costumes of the Royal Opera are superb, evoking both the splendour and austerity of the age.  The San Yuste crypt with the Emperor's tomb is particularly striking.  Here, an ending which is always open to speculation and interpretation is given an interesting, realistic and valid twist.  A thought-provoking conclusion to a grand performance!",1335571200,8,3011,5.120654396728017
8408669,4,B003Y58CL2,"Don Carlo is a history by itself. Books and the pamphlet included in this DVD goes to great length to describe the various versions of the opera and its various cuts to the point that it confuses you even more. The plot is based on historic characters, but the plot is not a representation of actual history.  The resulting plot, what you watch on this production is not the best dramatic result, so some background on the history is advised before watching the opera. But the real value is the music and the portraying of human emotions into music. Case in point is King Phillip's II (Furlanetto)  reflection aria in act IV.  In addition, there are many duets with almost any combination of voices you can imagine. The real joy of the opera is its music. Singers are good, in particular Furlanetto and Keenlyside (Pose). Audio recording is good, although not exceptional.
The production is very effective, except the scene in act II around Carlos V tomb. It is too dark for an image on the TV.
Overall, recommended as long as you do some reading before watching it.",1331424000,,1066,4.62962962962963
