8060691,3,B0009H68OQ,"If you like animation you may enjoy this cutesy trio of waterfalls. The mostly static scenes (besides the water) are enhanced with animated birds, cute fish and beautiful butterflies. The issue I had with this is that the music soundtrack loops quite a bit and you will have it memorized in a few minutes. This might be good for an eight minute meditation session. It was calming. If you are looking for waterfalls filmed at all different angles like I was this might be a bit too casual. For a more adventurous waterfall experience I can recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waterfalls/dp/3865620434/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waterfalls</a>.

8060692,2,B0009H68OQ,I received this in excellent condition but the video looks computer generated just like the Living beaches dvd. I was expecting REAL waterfall footage. This isn't worth the money no matter how little you pay for it.,1402272000,,215,4.837837837837838
8060693,5,B0009H68OQ,"Loved it!  I had seen it years before as a screensaver and always wondered if it could be purchased anywhere.  Well, low and behold, Amazon has it.  Really cool DVD!",1272240000,,165,4.433333333333334
8060694,1,B0009H68OQ,This DVD is totally hokey with digitally created waterfalls that look completely fake and the same goes for the phony flocks of birds and butterfly that dart across the screen.  We had a good laugh then returned it.,1232928000,5,215,4.657894736842105
8060695,3,B0009H68OQ,"I expected the digital animation to be more life-like.  I guess I've been spoiled by some of the beautiful aquarium programs.  The menu is great.  The images are lovely, but the nature sound track does not vary and the sounds of the waterfalls are almost secondary on the track.",1157846400,9,278,4.63265306122449
8060696,4,B0009H68OQ,"This is not a photographic essay of waterfalls, but rather animated clips of three waterfalls.  Only the first, pictured on the cover art, actually shows flowing water; the other two are static drawings of waterfalls, with the animation limited to flocks of birds and the occasional fish in the pool beneath the falls.

WHAT I LIKED:

THE VIDEO MENU:  By default each clip plays about five minutes, and the three cycle continually, but you can also choose to play only one clip continually.

THE PICTURES THEMSELVES:  In general superb, with photographic detail.  My only quibble is that only the first shows running water.

WHAT I DISLIKED:

THE ""NATURE SOUNDS"" AUDIO TRACK:  This blends the sound of a waterfall with jungle sounds; the same track is used for all three pictures.  The sound of the jungle creatures was harsh and overbearing and nearly drowned out the murmur of the water; at one point the scream of a big cat actually made my dogs look up.  I wish the developers had offered an additional audio menu choice of ONLY the sound of the waterfall.",1117843200,19,1060,4.763736263736264
