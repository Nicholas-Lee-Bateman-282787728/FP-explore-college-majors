8204264,5,B00005RRJJ,"Calling Bobcat is a great independent film in the vein of Napolean Dynamite, Garden State, and Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle.  Its only shortcoming is that it preceeded the now widespread interest in INDIE films, being about five years ahead of its time.

Directed by Paul Kermizian, it has been well cast (Jayce Bartok stars)and features some excellent ""Jersey-Style"" music, including Troy Hill, Bob Gilligan, Rich Praster, and Five Inch Fudge Muffin.

This is a wonderful film you will certainly enjoy.  It is certain to become a cult classic!",1143590400,,549,5.0
8204265,4,B00005RRJJ,"Not a laugh-out-loud riot that the video box or trailer would suggest, but definitely a solid film and a good effort from a first time director. Especially good performances from the two leads, Jayce Bartok and Rob King. So often, low budget independent films don't have any money and the filmmakers inappropriately cast their buddies. It's obvious that in this case they took the time to find the right actors, either that or in this case the buddies could actually act. Definitely worth checking out if you want to see how to correctly make a film on a shoestring.",1033948800,2,566,4.7272727272727275
