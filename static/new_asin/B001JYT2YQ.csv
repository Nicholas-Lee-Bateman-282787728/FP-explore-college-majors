8314053,2,B001JYT2YQ,"Ho hum. Another DVD-R transfer being listed on these pages, giving the impression it's the genuine article. Now we discover Warners is about to release same film in a pack with 3 others, including Karloff's ""The Walking Dead"", ""Frankenstein 1970"" and Lugosi's ""Zombies on Broadway"". I bought this DVD under the impression it was an authentic version. C'mon, Amazon... take some steps to get rid of the DVD-R pirates who solicit through your website..",1246147200,,450,5.094594594594595
8314054,4,B001JYT2YQ,"YOU'LL FOUND OUT is coming in Autumn 2009 from Warner as part of a Halloween promotion--also expected in the same package is ZOMBIES ON BROADWAY, THE WALKING DEAD, and FRANKENSTEIN 1970. It's supposed to be a Karloff/Lugosi promotion.  Warner's current master of YOU'LL FIND OUT is in pretty good shape, so the transfer should be a great deal better than is being reported about this release.

(Edit)  Interesting to note that the title of this release changed to WILD WILD SPOOK HOUSE following the announcement of Warner's ""official"" release this Fall.  Gotta love the ""grey market.""",1238284800,7,585,5.0625
8314055,5,B001JYT2YQ,"This forotton horror movie is forgotton gold. Peter Lorre, Bela Lugosi, and Boris Karloff are all in a plot together at a spooky old house. On hand to try to solve the ghostly plot involving ghosts ans seances is band leader Kay Keyser. Definitely fun!",1235606400,4,252,4.622222222222222
8314056,1,B001JYT2YQ,"The quality of this DVD was extremely poor. It looks like this DVD was mastered using a VHS tape. There is an excessive amount of distracting video noise, the titles all ""dance"" because of poor resolution and you can even see banding in the dark scenes (And there are plenty of dark scenes). The menu is virtually unreadable and amateur at best.
For those wanting to see great black and white cinematography of the 40's, don't buy this DVD.",1235347200,4,440,4.582278481012659
8314057,5,B001JYT2YQ,"I'm a big fan of classic horror and this movie is a rare treat. It has three of the kings of horror, Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, and Peter Lorre. It's a fun horror comedy along the lines of the ""Abbott and Costello Meets Frankenstein"" or something the Bowery Boys might have done. Kay Kyser, a then famous band leader, and his group go to a scary old mansion where they are forced to spend the night as the bridge is destroyed. But could there be murder and ghosts afoot? Someone nearly is killed by a chandelier during a seance conducted by Bela who seemingly communicates with the dead. It's a fun watch with the lights out and a treasure to fans of horror.",1226361600,9,659,4.365853658536586
