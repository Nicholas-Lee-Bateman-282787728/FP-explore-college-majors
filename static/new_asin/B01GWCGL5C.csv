8764024,5,B01GWCGL5C,"""Gator"" gives you the best of 70s movie fun.  Its redneck humor and excitement are still fun forty years later, and is Burt Reynolds at his best.  Jerry Reed gives a grossly under-rated and under-appreciated performance as bad guy Bama - he may be better known as a country-western singer, but he could have been as big a box-office icon as Burt had he been inclined.  Burt and Jerry are better known for 1977's ""Smokey and the Bandit"" but first came GATOR and WHITE LIGHTNING, and they're as entertaining, and have a better continuing storyline than Bandit ever did (remember how bad Bandit II was?)  Pop some corn, break out the beer, and enjoy this campy thriller even if you weren't born four decades ago.",1470960000,,709,4.648
