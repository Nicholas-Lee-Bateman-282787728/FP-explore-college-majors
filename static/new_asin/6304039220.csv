776056,2,6304039220,This movie does not hold up.  Some parts are legit like 15 frames per second and POORLY drawn.  A classic that suffers from the time it was made in.,1505692800,,148,4.068965517241379

776135,2,6304039220,"I have to remind myself this is over 30 years old, but even then, much of the animation was far from exceptional compared to other projects around the time.  The ""story"" was pretty weakly tied together, too.  I'm not a fan, or even a passing glancer, at the magazine this was suppose to be based on.  So, maybe that had something to do with it.  It was worth taking a look back at this for my own curiosity, but I probably couldn't think of a person I know whom I'd recommend this to.",1501977600,,484,4.172043010752688
776136,5,6304039220,"""Heavy Metal"" (1981) manages to capture alot of what makes the comic books of the same name cool. Of course, this animated film was made in 1981, so don't go in expecting groundbreaking visuals. In hindsight, the 'vintage' looking artwork lends to Heavy Metal's charm. Did I forget to mention that the collection of stories here are entertaining and pretty tripped out? Over-the-top, morally ambiguous, and appealing to our inner teenage boy, Heavy Metal is pretty kick @$$.",1499644800,,474,5.089743589743589

776143,5,6304039220,It's heavy metal what more can I say.  I wasn't allowed to see this when I was a kid and now I really don't understand what the fuss was about.  Great soundtrack rather crude animation.  It's a fun movie that my wife hates,1493596800,2,222,4.116279069767442

776192,5,6304039220,"This movie kicks ass. I can't say, the animation looks cool. All those songs all rock & roll! This movie is not suitable for children, because of all the sex & violence & it had a lot of nudity in it.",1485561600,,200,3.902439024390244

I guess they couldn't get Phil Spector to 'FIX' it with his magic.

This was a failed project - BUT - IT HAS SHINING MOMENTS OF GLORY  - THAT MAKE IT

776489,4,6304039220,"Fun early 80s animation, a bit crude but also gritty.  Especially, the film noir dystopia of Harry Canyon.  Some adolescent type sexual references and humor but funny nonetheless.  Definitely more a dude's movie.",1457568000,,212,5.363636363636363
776490,4,6304039220,"This film is hard to describe if you were not around in the late 1970s or early 1980s. Imagine an EXTREMELY violent episode of ""He-Man"" (in which He-Man impales and bludgeons his enemies and has sex with She-Ra who conveniently is a DD) and then throw in a soundtrack of Journey, Black Sabbath, Blue Oyster Cult, Cheap Trick, etc. and you will have an idea. Most of  the animators were Canadian so some of the voices were also on SCTV at the time (John Candy, Eugene Levy, Harold Ramis and others).

776495,5,6304039220,"My absolute fave for a R-rated cartoon.  Of course the music was the big draw, but the art is amazing and it's a great movie to kick back with some friends and some Colorado party favors.  Highly recommended...but kick the little kids out.",1447977600,,239,4.534883720930233

776541,3,6304039220,"This one is a very very mixed bag. Legend and nostalgia tend to give it a higher score than it deserves. Largely because it was the first time we ever saw something like this. Those wonderful Adult SciFi comics brought to motion. But the stories are uneven. The first and last are the best of the bunch. Heck the first will remind viewers more than a little of the Fifth Element (and overall better movie) and the last has been long paradied and passed into pop culture legend. (see South Park). The stuff between? kinda ok. I mean a bit with John Candy and Howard Ramis seemingly having a blast and probably completely lit will filming it is a trip as a historical piece, but was never anything much beyond animated porn at the time. The overarching story with the Green Globe and little girl is clunky and feels dreadfully out of place all around. And the opening sequence is disturbingly like a badly dated MTV commercial.

It's a fun watch. Plus lots of good music and animated boobs. But ultimately there are much better full movie examples of what this delivers. Conan the Barbarian, The Fifth Element, etc.",1440460800,,1113,4.592964824120603

For those who don't know, Heavy Metal was a fantastic magazine of illustrated science fiction, fantasy and some horror that ran from the late '70s to the early nineties. Characterized by adult themes, incredible artwork and a cutting edge aesthetic, it was the precursor to the modern idea of the graphic novel. Unfortunately creators of the movie decided that ""adult"" meant lots of gratuitous sex and LOTS of boobs (and some drugs and zombies). The target market I suppose was boys aged 13 to 18 with an intellectual level concomitant to the amount of newly minted testosterone coursing through their bodies. But this middle school crotch level aesthetic is a betrayal of what the magazine was about and was for me a complete disappointment. And yes I saw it as a teenager, liked the boobs then but hated the movie. With its cheesy soundtrack and Scooby Doo level of animation, and dumbed down stories tied together by a story arc involving an ""evil"" green sphere, Heavy Metal is mildly amusing at best and boring at worst. And there's a lot of boring. If you don't want to plunk down your money, I suggest watching the South Park episode ""Major Boobage"" which neatly skewers the animation style and themes of this idiotic movie in one of South Parks best parody episodes.

776836,5,6304039220,"No doubt about it, ""Heavy Metal"" is one of the most original, provocative movies of the eighties, or of any decade for that matter.  A tremendous wealth of artistic talent went into creating this animated anthology.  It is packed with science fiction adventure and eroticism.  A multitude of high profile animators, musicians, and actors contributed to this classic.  Released when MTV was booming on cable, it is understandable why it continues to have a cult following.  Before ""Heavy Metal"" was officially released on VHS, it was one of the most pirated films in history.  Every fan of the Heavy Metal magazine had to possess it.

  As a fan of the Italian sword and sandal movies of the sixties, my favorite story line in ""Heavy Metal"" is based on the character of Den.  Voiced by actor John Candy and drawn by popular adult animator Richard Corben, Den was the idol of every nerd boy who dreamed of becoming the muscle bound super hero.  Take your favorite Olympian bodybuilder, imagine them nude, bald and well endowed and you have Corben's graphic novel version of Den.  (The ""Heavy Metal"" movie has Den wearing a loincloth, much to the chagrin of numerous fans who wrote complaint letters to Heavy Metal magazine.)  The Den saga exemplified the essence of Heavy Metal; it was erotically charged science fiction adventure for adults.  When the feature ended, so did my patronage of Heavy Metal magazine.

  Unfortunately, the story line for Den in the ""Heavy Metal"" movie is too short.  One only receives a brief peek of Den's life.  This character warrants a full length feature.  ""Fire and Ice"" has been recently released by Blue Underground and features sensually dressed characters drawn by renown artists Frank Frazetta and Ralph Bakshi.

I do agree with one of the other reviewers here that said the sound track was great, and I think the different stories blend very well together by matching each other's themes. The animation for this film is really first rate, so it's no wonder why this film is a classic. The film is based off the popular erotic comic book Heavy Metal which features a collaboration of short erotic stories. The movie starts out with an astronaut coming home to bring his daughter a present, but the orb soon consumes her father. So she is left defenseless. Upon her father's death, the orb reveals several different stories in which this jewel has caused chaos and influenced various lives. Although the stories violence and sexual content is a bit exessive and some of the voice acting is bland, it still manages to tell a very powerful story.

That death is a green orb known as the Lochnar, which has an evil sepulchral voice.  This animated movie involves the Lochnar cornering a young girl and telling her stories of people who have encountered it.
Of the nine sequences, the opening two are introductory sequences that set the stage of the overall story, which leaves seven actual adventures.  ""Soft Landing"" has a space shuttle flying over Earth, while an astronaut in a Corvette flies down to the Earth, with Rigg's hard-rocking ""Radar Rider"" playing.  The animation is stylishly done, and leads to ""Grimaldi,"" in which the title character and astronaut brings home the Lochnar, only to have it destroy him and corner his daughter, who hears the seven stories.  Song:  Blue Oyster Cult-""Veteran of the Psychic Wars.""
The title character in ""Harry Canyon"" is a cabbie in NYC in the year 2031.  He's got the usual NYC attitude, with his wits about and a well-equipped cab that gets him out of unexpected crises.  He tries to help a nubile woman who's the target of gangsters trying to get the Lochnar, which her father discovered.  Ratnik, the gangster boss, is clearly based on the Kingpin (Marvel Comics) and the Fat Man (Maltese Falcon).  Songs played:  Donald Fagen-""True Companion"", Stevie Nicks-""Blue Lamp"", Journey-""Open Arms"", Riggs-""Heartbeat""
""Den"" has a pencil-skinny nerd being transported to another planet by the Lochnar, where he's tranformed into a muscular he-man who gets some hot and naked chicks in the deal.  One of my favourites, as it's inspiring to guys who don't have a chance with pretty girls.
In ""Captain Sternn"", a mild-mannered Hanover Fist is transformed into an Incredible Hulk-looking behemoth while being called as a character witness to the sleazy title character aboard a space station.  Mayhem follows.  Guess what causes Fist's transformation?  Fist's first denunciatory statement of Sternn is funny.  Song:  Cheap Trick-""Reach Out"".
""B-17,"" also known as ""Gremlins,"" recalls the old Tales of the Crypt comics of ghostly airmen aboard B-17 bombers attacking living crewmen.  Song:  Don Felder-""Heavy Metal (Take A Ride)""
""So Beautiful & So Dangerous"" has an alien robot kidnapping and getting acquainted with a nubile secretary from the Pentagon while his two dopey pilots get high on Nyborg, a cocaine-like drug.  One of the aliens says he knows how to drive while stoned:  ""It's like you know your perspective's f-d, you just gotta let your hands work the controls as if you're straight.""  Songs:  Grand Funk Railroad-""Queen Bee"", Nazareth-""Crazy"", Don Felder-""All Of You"", Sammy Hagar-""Heavy Metal""
""Taarna"", the story of a warrior who is sent to avenge the massacre of a city by mutants made evil by the Lochnar, is the best.  She's mute, but tough, wearing a nice leather outfit that still leaves her body revealed, and riding a hooting pterodactyl with large eyes.  The scene where she fights some mutants in a bar is inspired by the Star Wars cantina scene.  One of the bloodier stories.  Songs:  Black Sabbath-""Mob Rules"", Devo-""Through Being Cool"", and ""Working In A Coal Mine.""
Included is a sequence, ""Neverwhere Land"", originally intended to fit between ""Captain Sternn"" and ""Gremlins"", of how the Lochnar's baleful influence led to the predatory and violent instincts of creatures and men, with references to the French Revolution and Jack the Ripper.
What made this movie such a hit was its depiction of totally nude females, complete with pubic hair, especially ""Den"" and ""Taarna.""  Although seemingly dated in animation style, it's way better than its millennial remake, with great rock songs and an attitude that's tough, funny, and unique.",1045353600,9,3787,5.130505709624796

Heavy Metal is one of those movies which you shouldn't try analizing but rather you should kick back and enjoy.  It's the true party movie when you've got a ""beer buzz"" going.
Contrary to what the Editor says, I honestly think the Soundtrack is awesome.  It includes ""Heavy Metal"" by Sammy Hagar, ""Open Arms"" by Journey and other great artists like DEVO which personnified what Punk rock was all about.

It will certainly cater to anyone with a one track mind or an admiration for empty, shallow sexual scenes. Erotic? Hardly.

It's not a ninety minute story, it's really a set of free-standing items, each with their own weird twist. The B17 series is good but gruesome, and my particular favourite is Commander Stern.

So ""fire it"" up on the player, and ""take a ride, on heavy metal.""  PS: The Don Felder song is worth the soundtrack alone. Hard to believe it's the dude from the Eagles. Be warned though, this is classic rock, not metal, despite what the title implies. Remember this is before Metalica,Pantera,etc... In my day, BOC,Nazareth,Nugent,etc were labeled metal. Just to show you how unMetal this is, Journey(?) and Devo are included. Course DEVO works in an odd context, where as Journey is well Journey.

I wasn't very impressed with this film. It seems to be more geared to sexually curious 13 year old boys swimming in sweaty jock straps and wet dreams than any real audience. More like an animated issue of Playboy. (Which isn't all that bad) ;-) Let's not forget to mention the varied background tracks from 80's artists like Stevie Nicks or Black Sabbath. The tracks were inserted at appropriate times of action during the film, creating no big perks. Too obvious... The aimless plot can be easily summerized, a glowing green ball. wow...

I agree that it is dated, but as that same person  pointed out, there really wasn't much else available in the early 80's. If  you keep that in mind as you watch it, the movie's really not that bad.

I bought the comic and I wanted to see the Movie all over again and I can't find my DVD or was it VHS anywhere!  I got sad.  Then I bought this tonight!  I LOVE this movie!  It used Xerox and Rotoscope because in the 80's Computers were still a new thing.  They did numbers that's about it.  Photocopiers were still B&W not color like today.  The animation could be a little rough, sometimes like in Den it isn't drawn smooth.  They had students put that story together and Den isn't as consistent looking.  Some of the film looks like it was done in a hurry, but that adds to it.  This actually gets more interesting as time goes on.  Even the sound is a little soft here and there and the music is loud but again, it adds to the early-ness and the fact it took FOREVER to get to VHS and DVD was not until the late 90's.  All sorts of Lawsuits and who owns what got into it.  It was a miracle anyone could have a copy after it ran in theatres.  (Not all theatres carried this film.)  Thankfully my college did.  So here we have this rough hewn gem of a believe it or not AWESOME movie.  Not everyone likes this film.  Not everyone will.  I did.
