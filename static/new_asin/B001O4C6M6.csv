3727072,5,B001O4C6M6,"""Intelligence"" is a show by Chris Haddock, the same guy who brought us the equally obscure Da Vinci's Inquest. It's about the myriad characters in a Canadian Crime Intelligence unit and an organized crime family. The many stories, plots, and calamitous events just keep coming and intertwining into a dizzying mosaic of personal and professional disaster. The show hits the ground at a full run, challenging the viewer to keep up, and maintains that pace until it pours it on even more for the nail-biting season cliffhangers!",1254182400,,526,5.057471264367816
3727073,4,B001O4C6M6,"This is an excellent series--well-written and acted, and smart--and well worth the investment. I give Season One five stars and Season Two four stars. The disparity is due to the ending of Season Two, which serves as the series' ending, as well, because a planned third season was cancelled. The cancellation of Season Three appears to have left the writers with too little time to provide satisfying resolutions of the series' story lines, and the ending feels facile and rushed.",1243123200,12,480,5.0125
3727074,5,B001O4C6M6,"I have only watched disc  one and am in middle of disc two, but so far season two  promises  to be a good sequel to the first one.

3727075,5,B001O4C6M6,"I sat down 2 days ago to watch Intelligence and have almost completed watching Season 2. Knowing this is the last season, I am trying to savor the last disc. Amazing characters and cast. So well done. It is a shame that it will come to an end. Great story line, intense, fast moving, totally captivating. Bravo Canadian TV. DaVinci's Inquest is next on my list of ""must see"" dramas. 3 seasons are waiting.",1240790400,,405,4.486486486486487
3727076,5,B001O4C6M6,"Being in the U.S. I never heard of Intelligence but came across it on Amazon.  I loved it instantly and pre-ordered season 2 as soon as I could.  I rec'd season 2 3 days ago and I have one episode left.  My plan was to stretch it out as long as possible since it is the final season and the first night had to force my self to stop after one disc.  The second night I was not so lucky - I stayed up all night watching the next 6 hours.  One episode before bed - that was the plan...watched until 5 a.m.  Now I'm on the last disc and so sad.  My family has been bugging me since I gave them season 1 - where's season 2?  Kept forgetting it hadn't been released yet...no matter how many times I told them. I know they will be equally heartbroken when they finish it.  I would love to see these actors all in another crime show soon - but something lasting more than 2 seasons.  When you see a great show like this only last 2 seasons you've got to wonder what were they thinking?  There's no way it was replaced by anything better - no possible way.  Now I'm hunting for more Canadian crime shows I may have missed because they do it so well - Davinci's Inquest, Intelligence, and Cold Squad (not on DVD-but airing on SLEUTH TV) are all great shows-Davinci and Intel are pure genius with amazing actors who you truly believe are who they are.  Ian Tracey is so talented.  I completely believed him as Mic Leary and never thought I could turn around a believe him as Jimmy Reardon when he played such a great cop.  But Jimmy Reardon is just as believable, perfectly played and the rest of the cast is equally fabulous.  I always find myself rooting for the cops to put the bad guys way....Intel is the opposite -I like the actors, and want to root for the ""good guys"" but by the end of every episode, I'm on the edge of my seat rooting for Jimmy and his pals.  What a great show - cancelling it had to be the worst mistake ever-that says alot considering how many good shows get cancelled by the idiots in network & cable TV, while a bunch of trash continues to air year after year.",1239840000,49,2079,4.1575
3727077,5,B001O4C6M6,"If you like gritty cop shows, then you will love the Canadian-made INTELLIGENCE.  It's as good as THE WIRE, THE SHIELD and HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREETS, which are certainly the most realistic crime series ever seen on television.

Set in Vancouver, B.C., the drama takes you inside the murky worlds of organized crime and the cops who keep tabs on it.  The leading character (Ian Tracey) is a good father, respected businessman and a major drug smuggler.  On the other side of the fence is Klea Scott, the ambitious head of the city's Organized Crime Unit.  She not only has the crooks to contend with, but also her colleagues in the intelligence community who are trying to sabotage her information-gathering efforts to bring down the ""bad guys"".

A quirk of fate brings these two key characters together in an uneasy alliance that could help or destroy both.

INTELLIGENCE, Season Two (12 episodes/4-discs) from Acorn Media, continues this tense drama, picking up the action where Season One's nail-biting cliff-hanger ending left off.

DVD extras include a discussion with series creator Chris Haddock and ""Behind the Scenes"" clips.",1237680000,16,1136,5.037433155080214
3727078,4,B001O4C6M6,"Great series that not a lot of people have seen. Amazing acting and writing. It is most unfortunate that CBC decided to cancel after season 2. For those who can find and watch it, time well spent.",1465862400,,196,4.324324324324325
3727079,5,B001O4C6M6,"Some say that season two of Intelligence lost its way. I disagree. Canadian Chris Haddock is a master of taking the everyday ordinary interactions (even of drug kingpins) and making it fascinating. He created Jimmy Reardon (who ought to be in prison) and makes us like him and root for him. He has a crazy ex-wife, a young impressionable daughter and just happens to own a strip club and deal drugs. And finds himself working with the intelligence service. Ah, just a day in the life... Very sorry this one is gone.",1463788800,2,515,4.608695652173913
3727080,5,B001O4C6M6,Now this show is addictive.  It is so hard to turn it off.  I can't wait for the next one.  Found myself rooting for the bad guy.,1449792000,,129,3.7037037037037037
3727081,5,B001O4C6M6,"Very interesting series; the second season is more gripping and action packed than the first season. The first season seemed to move more slowly introducing us to the characters and their lives, building up the drama. This Canadian drama is very different in flavor from American and other international drama series. There was something very unique about it; perhaps the pacing of the storyline (slower), more low key ""real life"" characters or perhaps more realistic character acting. Once again, it's just very unique and it may seem early in series 1 that it's not going anywhere, but it gets more and more interesting and does go somewhere and if you're ready for a detective drama that's more low key, and more realistic,  this is definitely well done.",1446422400,,757,4.960629921259843

3727092,5,B001O4C6M6,as a big city narcotics policeman for almost 30yrs and laugh at the 99% of what they show as cop flixs;  this one is a favorite.  Figures the idiots with the money to make these things don't know when they have a winner!  I especially loved the intro music as well as during the shows.,1427500800,2,285,4.1454545454545455
3727093,5,B001O4C6M6,"This is a great series, probably my favorite. Few shows about espionage reach the quality and realism of this show. (The Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy shows, The Sandbaggers, and The Americans are very good, too.) Season Two has different concerns than Season One, with Mary Spalding now making the move over to CSIS. Some thread plots from the first season are left behind as the series focuses more on conducting counter-intelligence and developing foreign intelligence than on doing police work in Organized Crime Unit. Of course, that's where it was always headed. Jimmy Reardon, fresh off the Season One cliffhanger, has a thrilling escape and has to balance life on the run from the DEA and the tending of his empire. The resolution of that arc propels the beginning of the season and complicates the establishment of Jimmy's off-shore bank. The bank becomes central in the relationship between Reardon and Spalding--I don't want to reveal anything, but watching this unfold was fascinating. The reason I like the show so much is because it gets into the real-life the business of intelligence without the usual garbage that gets thrown in, from gadgets like Reddington's cell on The Blacklist (love Intelligences chain-link enclosure room in the nondescript warehouse) to the torture fantasies and hacker bafflegab on offer on most ""serious"" spy shows. I believe this is much closer to the truth of the way that human intelligence sources are developed and intelligence gathered in the real world. I'm very disappointed that the CBC did not renew the series for a third season and instead left us with a agonizing cliffhanger as an ending. (For those worried about where it would have gone, rewatch Episode 3 of the first season and see that it offers some hope that things will be OK.)",1427155200,2,1792,4.996655518394649

3727104,5,B001O4C6M6,"The 2 seasons of Intelligence is one of the best mini-series ever created for TV.  Great characters.  Great story lines.  Very realistic, I'm sure that's why there wasn't a season 3, the story showed the DEA and CIA carrying out their illegal activities in Canada/North America/Mexico and I'm certain that didn't go over well in Washington DC.  Infiltrating the Canadian government, manipulating the drug trade on both sides of the border, murdering Canadians and Americans as they wished in order to get the results they wanted.  Not a whole lot of fiction in this one folks.

I really am hoping they pick it back up with a Season 3 with Jimmy Reardon recovering in the hospital, preparing to turn over all the dirty details on the CIA (Black Briar Group), DEA (doing illegal drug deals on both sides of the border) and other illegal spying going on inside CSIS and Ottawa.

It definitely warranted two or more additional seasons. But it is a jewel that I watch over and over. Half of this story is about a major Canadian pot smuggler who is kind, considerate and a good father despite the situations he must get into to maintain a marijuana trade and laundering the fortunes of money he makes because he brings it in much faster than he can spend it. The other half of this story is about a brilliant black, female, Canadian intelligence chief who must make deals and compromises in order to capture the big fish despite peers and workers who would like to see her fail.

3727118,3,B001O4C6M6,"The 1st Season & beginning of 2nd Season are fantastic, one of the best series out there. However, mid-way through the 2nd Season, the show really falls apart. It's like they knew it would be cancelled & stopped caring. Certain plot-threads are just dropped. Jimmy Reardon's hothead brother disappears w/out explanation. The tribulations of a Russian call-girl with a terrible accent (hopefully not real) take center-stage, but she is not a good enough actress to handle it. We're supposed to believe that the likeable but ruthless crime-lord Jimmy Reardon, suddenly gets all Ghandi-like dealing w/ competition. He has a chance for a Michael Corleone moment w/ the rival American gang, but instead he keeps asking for peace as members of his Canadian crime alliance keep getting shot. The sub-plot btwn he & his psycho coke-fiend, ex-wife, and young hottie girlfriend never gets a chance to develop. Even Matt Frewer, who was so good & conflicted in the beginning, is on auto-pilot by the end.
At the finale, we are meant to wonder if a major character will survive or not. Sadly, I no longer cared. The 1st Season is worth owning, then just rent the 1st disk of the 2nd Season.",1355788800,4,1178,4.865671641791045

3727126,5,B001O4C6M6,"I started watching it on Netflix after getting a glowing recommendation from a friend.  I was skeptical because I'm burned out on most TV shows these days, where the end is sooooooo predictable and any twists are very basic and spoon fed to you, which is kind of insulting.  Most US movies are like that too.  Anyway, this show grabs you from the start, because there is no spoon feeding at all.  You have to pay close attention and figure out things just like the characters have to do.  There are always mysterious characters appearing or wild cards that keep you guessing all the time and many things are left unresolved, just like real life.  Nobody wears a white hat and nobody wears a black one either.  The American agency portrayals are surprisingly unflattering, but very believable. The show is full of super real situations with many twists.  Another big plus in my book is the very low key violence portrayed, where it is mostly implied and not the main theme of the show.  I really like it and am considering buying the 2 season set to finish watching it, after Netflix took it off instant view.  I'll then gift it to a friend.  There are some very interesting theories in the Netflix comments on why it was stopped after only 2 seasons.  They suggest it had something to do with the content and how it mirrors real concerns of the Canadian government.  It certainly is one the best shows I've seen in a long time.",1348099200,,1427,4.52734375

But what truly sets the series apart is its depth. We see essentially three broad types of characters in all their human fallibility and degrees of attractiveness. At the top, there's Mary Spalding, the true warrior, self-restrained, intelligent, with a genuine heart. Then there's Jimmy and Ronnie, the gangsters who are completely absorbed in scheming for petty advantage, but have likable qualities all the same. Down in the gutter are the psychopathic criminals trying to gain a foothold in Vancouver. A side story deals with a CIA plot. It's like real life in that we can see the expansive and contractive qualities of the characters and the results of those attitudes in their lives. It's a classic, better in all ways than many better-known feature films.",1329696000,4,934,5.151315789473684
3727131,5,B001O4C6M6,"Just finished watching the final episode of Season Two, and I'm simultaneously exhilarated and crushed.  It's very rare to find something this beautifully conceived and executed.  The show is extraordinarily authentic - not necessarily about the spy and drug businesses, thankfully I have no experience with either and thus no basis for comparison.  But this thing feels incredibly authentic in terms of its characters.  Most television shows or movies never get anywhere close to this level of character authenticity because it's so much easier to manipulate viewers with plot twists.  Doing it this way is both vastly more difficult and less likely to be a winner with the lowest common denominator.  All the people who were involved in making this series obviously cared about it very deeply - even the smallest details and least significant characters ring true.

And that makes the arbitrary cancellation of the series after only two seasons all the more painful to accept.  Maybe it was too smart to find a sufficient audience, or perhaps it hit a little too close to home for the soulless bureaucrats who canceled it.  I suppose the reason doesn't matter so much now.  Twenty six episodes exist, and they are brilliant.

Ian Tracey, Klea Scott, Camille Sullivan,John Cassini & Matt Frewer all give outstanding performances in a good guys vs bad guys scenario. There is a lot of blurring of the lines between good & bad - and all the different Canadian & US spy agency acronyms can be a little confusing - having said that, this is the best television series I have seen for a long time. Why it only went for 2 seasons is unfathomable, when there is SO much bad TV that keeps going on & on & on!!
To me it was like reading a really good crime novel - ' Just one more chapter & I'll go to bed ' - I watched the whole of Season 2 in one day and was not for one second bored.
Things change so rapidly that one has to concentrate, past paced, great acting, good plot & boy, can the Canadians make good TV!!
I would recommend this series to anyone who liked 'Da Vinci's Inquest', 'the Wire' and 'Homicide - Life on the Streets'.
All quality shows that we do not seem to have at our fingertips now.",1305763200,2,1057,4.062200956937799
3727133,1,B001O4C6M6,"While season one was a great work of television, it seemed like all the talent took a vacation from season 2 and left it in the hands of first year film students from a community college. Predictable, boring and at times annoying, the plot became so silly I was beyond caring by the end. Good riddance.",1299801600,,302,4.410714285714286

Great character development, interesting location, fantastic story line.  What would have caused them to pull this show.  I just finished watching the last episode, ugh!  This has got to be one of the finest series ever on tv.  I hate cop-shows but I love this show.",1289347200,9,415,4.298701298701299

The best television drama of the era, trailing only ""The Wire"" in intensity and satisfying story telling. Told from the perspective of those who make thier income from the illicit drug trade and the authorities who must cooperate with them, ""Intelligence"" is just that. A keeper.",1273190400,,461,5.078947368421052
3727138,5,B001O4C6M6,"I titled this review Poor Decision Making because whoever decided to end this series knows nothing about quality. This is clearly one of the best acted, best scripted and most interesting shows on television and it is truly sad it is ending after only 2 seasons. Klea Scott and Ian Tracey lead with stunning performances week in and week out. Matt Frewer is brilliant. The writing will have you guessing what comes next and the stories are totally engaging. Ostensibly the Canadian The Wire, it is every bit as good as that excellent series.
I guess I am grateful for this show seeing the light of day, given that some genius decided to end it after 2 seasons. Let's have MORE of this quality television instead of reality shows and other trash that shouldn't see the light of day.",1267747200,24,781,4.625899280575539
3727139,5,B001O4C6M6,"Intelligence is the best weekly TV show I have ever watched. Truly I think Intelligence is better than Prison Break or Lost.
My wife said I was addicted to the show but once she started watching from the beginning of the first season she found out why I was addicted. She too became an Intelligence Addict along with my sister who is now watching season 1 & 2.
Once ya start watching Intelligence it is tough to get to bed on time, it's late nights at the big screen till the end of season 2.
I sure hope they make a season 3.",1259020800,,526,4.116504854368932

Impossible, you must give the intelligence fans a better ending? Is Jimmy dead? will Katrina make it to Paris?  What's going to happen to Mary?  There are so many ways to go with this show PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T GO!!
