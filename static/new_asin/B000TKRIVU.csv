8210016,5,B000TKRIVU,This DVD set is an education in UFOs and much more than what they show on cable. I was shocked and really enjoyed the material.,1250726400,,127,4.12

Very disappointed that the DVD has no sound in some of it.
What is happening here.",1248134400,,153,3.967741935483871
8210018,1,B000TKRIVU,"If you see Bill Knell associated with it - avoid it. Old, outdated material, poorly transferred from videotape to DVD. Half the time the DVD does not play properly. Not recommended.",1219190400,,181,4.870967741935484
