8588115,1,B0009836RC,The cd came with pictures/scenes on the back. The cd started to play for a couple of minutes and then ended. I ran it in two machines and got the same results. Obviously someone copied the (original?) and the copy did not take. I tried but could not get a refund. would noot buy from this seller again..,1445212800,,303,4.241379310344827
