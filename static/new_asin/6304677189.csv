2756879,5,6304677189,"I first saw this film 15 years ago and it was a life altering experience.  Immediately, I went out and purchased the video, despite the fact that I did not own a VCR at the time, and proceeded to show it to anyone that was interested.  Very thought provoking and compelling.  I have seen this film at least 20 times and still it is very new and eye opening.  It is filmed gracefully and tells the story of Mother Teresa through unfiltered lenses.  What we see is what transpired. No matter what our spiritual orientation might be, we cannot deny the fact of Mother Teresa's profound impact upon our world. The most heart rending scene, out of so many, is the one in Lebanon as Mother Teresa goes to rescue invalid children.  That alone is worth the price of this video.

It is also eye opening to see how much she did...how well her Order functioned for people in dire situations, all around the world....from India to Lebanon to The South Bronx of New York City. Yes, right back at home in our large, North American cities. Shows that it takes everything and yet nothing at the same time to reach out and help someone, starting with a smile and a good nature.

I've owned this movie on VHS for years, and when I saw it was offered on DVD, I was excited to finally own it on disc. UNFORTUNATELY, the DVD is simply a TRANSFER of a VHS. It is extremely poor quality. It is NOT a scan or transfer of the original FILM elements.

So if you own the VHS, you might consider just keeping what you have. I'm returning this because I am so disappointed in the quality of this DVD--NOT in the quality of the original movie or message.

If you don't own the VHS, you may consider buying this DVD as it's a wonderful portrayal of Mother Teresa's life. It's just unfortunate that they transferred it from a VHS the way people can do at home on their own.",1347667200,6,859,4.193939393939394

Yet it is so foreign and remote from our minds, as suffering is from our experience, that we must watch in awe this woman's response to a call for love.

For anyone interested in knowing about her, her work, her life, her faith, her, this is a good purchase.  It is comprehensive, using live interviews and her voice.  Since I am a admirer, to put it mildly, I cannot say enough good.  I will view it more than once to be reminded of her example and her words to us.",1338249600,,452,4.258823529411765

Many deadbeat atheists often like to criticize Mother Teresa: showing how complete & brilliant their depravity is. But for those who still have hearts that beat in their chests - here is a MOTHER and a true hero of our generation.
This film was made over several years, on several continents and remains one of my favorite documentaries. It remains a treasure and hats off to Jean Petrie for making it.",1313971200,,564,4.4326923076923075

2756915,4,6304677189,"THAT THE VIDEO IS OKAY but it could have been better without that statement being any reflection on Mother Teresa. I was hoping to learn more about the times when she had doubts and how she cured herself of them.  Mother Teresa said that when two people marry they are to ""cleave"" together as one...even more, ""become one.""  This she was teaching to her novices to get them to understand what they are undertaking as ""brides"" of Jesus though she never used that word.  But she did not use the word ""committment"" and ""devotion"" in her lesson but she wanted them to cling closely to the word ""cleave"" so they would know what they were getting themselves into.

I thought of marriage then, as in spouses, as in partners for life, with the word 'cleave' in my mind..  Marriage, parenting, devotion, committment to...and that includes a committment to a job so that earn a retirement. It's as if we live our lives as little flowers or some other word or metaphor but all in all, we are to work hard (work is essential in Mother Teresa's way of life; it's good for you and it keeps you devoted; Booker T. Washington warned the people that they should not have all comfort in life that some struggle rather 'shines' and 'polishes' the soul for a really good life experience; my words, not his) but to dedicate one's self for an entire lifetime with no break for anything else, especially SELF; well, let's say: Ayn Rand would not be impressed. That's why I wanted to know more about her doubtful moments because here in our world called democratic capitalism we are prepared to change: change spouses, change addresses, change careers, change religions, change callings: CHANGE!!!  Therefore, we look at Mother's Teresa's calling (and though we adore her forever) we are left with a lot of questions about how much is too much, about how long is too long, and what price glory, and even: what else is there for me to do that I like more than what I'm doing? [I'm left with an interpretation I'll call: FOREVER IN A DAY and I'll admit that I have Mother's Teresa's career on my mind and one-time marriage on my mind, which infers: NO CHANGE. But then YOU can step up to the plate and remind me that all this one-time stuff in a person's life, without a lot of change, means that a person is building something that is likely to last a very long time, a very long time. So,that's why do it!

Even so, a giant question I wanted asked: ""Do you have an opinion that has formed over the years as to how people became so destitute?  Is there a pattern or are the rest of us just lucky?""  Well the Indian People have responded to that question with this sort of thinking: ""Oh, this is just one of your lives; you will come back in other lives that might be better. It depends. So be kind to the poor and wretched. They can't help it. They are in a life that is wretched for a reason.""

Mother Teresa let a government official know that she did not want to give up the land where the nuns were taking care of the sick and destitute.  This was in a South American country.  The government official spoke directly to Mother Teresa and let her know that they wanted the land to build progress (a shopping mall) and again the young official spoke carefully but assuredly.  Then suddenly Mother Teresa said, ""I want the sisters to remain here but we will accept whatever and where ever you put us.  We only want to serve Jesus.""  The government official was caught and she gasped in shock.  It was obvious she had been whipped.  The next thing in the video had the narrator telling us that not only did they give up that land the officials came back and gave Mother Teresa even more land and some other contrite offerings as well.

Still, I wanted even more intimacy with Mother Teresa.  I wanted to know more about her person and I wanted to know if she wanted to teach how to remain faithful to your calling (and marriage and family is a calling) and even ask her if she thinks one should ever move on........""to something better""?

Where most of us are reluctant to get involved, she is completely at ease with the sick and down-trodden.  The eager smiles that greet her show that she is well-known and highly revered in the worst circumstances.  Even though there many who follow in her footsteps, there is clearly only one Mother Teresa who towers above all.

2756924,5,6304677189,"The 1986 ""Mother Teresa"" film by Ann and Jeanette Petrie is the most inspiring and powerful portrait of the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize winner. This fascinating portrait shot in 10 countries over a period of five years transcends culture, class and religion. In 1952 Mother Teresa began picking up the dying in the streets of Calcutta, India. By the early 80s she and over 3,000 members of her order the Missionaries of Charity were working in 52 countries including Europe, the Americas, the Middle East and Africa and had provided love and comfort to over 42,000 abandoned people in the streets. Now a decade after she died in 1997 at the age 87 she remains an icon of kindness, love in action, compassion, sacrifice, service, frugality and a transformer of hearts and minds.
Mother Teresa's goal was not to convert others to Christianity but to allow Hindus to become better Hindus, Christians to become better Christians and Muslims to become better Muslims. She said, ""We all belong to the same family, Hindus, Muslims and all people are our brothers and sisters. They are the children of God.
Her fame did not affect the way she lived. She went barefoot whenever possible and slept on the floor of an open dormitory with the other sisters. She ate lightly, used cold water, owned only two white cotton saris and washed her own laundry and dishes. Visitors were struck by her simplicity and frugality. She explained, ""No money that is given to the poor should be wasted on our electricity. We use only what we absolutely need."" The film shows how she lived Jesus' teaching, ""Whatever you do to the least of my brethren, you do to me."" She saw the poor and the sick as ""Christ in distressing disguise."" She said do small things with great love, ordinary things with extraordinary love. ""Love has to be put into action and that action is service.""",1228780800,3,1845,4.732919254658385

2756928,5,6304677189,"If you ever wonder what the meaning of love and suffering is, this penetrating view of the life and work of Mother Teresa and her band of merry nuns will most likely leave you a different person if you act on the impulse that it will leave you with. I have shown this film to over a hundred people and every single person, Christian to atheist, has been bettered by it. The product review above gives a fine summary, and I can only add that if we take seriously the call of Jesus to love one another as He has loved us, then each one of us will find a way to express kindness and aid to those around us.

A major message of the film is that small acts done with great love reveal the power of God and bring Christ in our midst, Who is present in the poor and lonely. We don't need to travel overseas to love the poor. We need only to walk down the road and really see a stranger's need, call a relative we have forgotten or snubbed, visit a nursing home. A nun once told a seeker who had asked how a person can know if they love God. She replied, think about the person you hate the most, for that is how much you really love God our Father.

8174995,5,6304677189,"I was definitely not Roman Catholic when I first heard of Saint Teresa over 30 years ago.  This film was in my local Blockbuster and I checked it out and fell in love.  The cool part about this film is that Mother wasn't so very old and broken down when this was made, having been made 20 years or so before her death.  She's traveling around the world, just being the saint that she was.  i can't recommend this highly enough for those wanting to know more about her and her order.

This film, to me, is a perfect illustration of how we don't need a bunch of actors to play people like Teresa.  We have tens of thousands of hours of real footage with real subjects.  Go for authentic!",1517788800,,685,4.223076923076923
8174996,2,6304677189,"The DVD was not able to work on any of the DVD players I had in my and my parents house.  The disk would pause and start again incessantly making it impossible to watch.  I asked for another DVD to be shipped to me, and I experienced the same with the 2nd DVD.  I don't have any problems with any other DVDs I own, thus it most definitely has to do with how the actual DVD was printed/recorded.  I finally did find a DVD player (integrated with a small TV I have in a spare room in my garage) in which this DVD finally did work and was able to play it fully without interruption.  Once I watched it fully, I would give this 5 stars, but since it could not play on 5 out of 6 DVD players I tried, I had to give it 2 stars.  Did anyone else have this problem?",1515283200,,757,3.883116883116883
