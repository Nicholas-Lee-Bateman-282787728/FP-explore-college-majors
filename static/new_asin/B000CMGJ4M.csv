8099209,5,B000CMGJ4M,LOVE IT. The videos are classic and truly enjoyed by all Disney fans. The price wasn't bad either. Would buy again,1379116800,,114,4.476190476190476
8099210,5,B000CMGJ4M,"I was so happy with this product.  I'd been looking for 5 of these sets for a long time and just happened to stumble across this package. I appreciated the warning that one of the DVD's might not work in the USA/Canada because it was from a different zone, but all the DVD's worked!  The delivery was so fast it was unbelievable.  I think it was only 5 buisness days from the time I ordered.  Would defaintly order from this company again!!",1309392000,4,440,4.329268292682927
8099211,5,B000CMGJ4M,Got the chance to purchase the 7 titles in this set plus 6 more for a total of 13 treasure titles direct from the Disney Movie Club each at a 60% discount(I am a VIP member because I have purchased a lot of movies from the club so I get great discount offers) so I got the 13 titles for 239.00 which was a better deal than only 7 of them in this set,1291766400,,349,3.72972972972973
8099212,5,B000CMGJ4M,"Finally, a good set of Disney Classics. They might not have the fancy tins with them, but I look at the content of the DVD's themselves. I love the classic set and am pleased to see them making a comeback. One thing I'm not excited about it the commentary by Maltin, we know it is politically incorrect, it was the times, and we don't need reminders. People who purchase these sets are avid collectors and are intelligent enough to know historical aspects.",1224028800,10,456,4.573170731707317
