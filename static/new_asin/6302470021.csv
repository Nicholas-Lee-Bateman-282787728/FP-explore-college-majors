Perhaps its late, and its the icedtea thats talking, but this movie contained so many different styles of humor and spoofs from so many different angles, that all work  together!

475325,3,6302470021,"This 1967 spoof of Ian Fleming's novel, not to mention the film series itself, is entertaining overall, but is not without its problems.  Some scenes are utterly hilarious, while others leave you wondering,  ""What's the point?""  David Niven, Orson Welles, Ursula Andress,  and Woody Allen head up the impressive cast.  The climax of the film is  insane, but entertaining nontheless.  It would be a travesty not to mention  Burt Bacharach's splendid score, including the Oscar-nominated ""The  Look of Love.""  It's worth watching; the main hurdle is ignoring the  fact that the filmmakers wasted a great Ian Fleming thriller.",911865600,,623,5.255102040816326

Very good drugs.
Cannot imagine any other way this got made.

Girlfriend and I always wanted to see all the Bond films from start to finish.
We ordered the Bond 50 collection, and added the few odds and ends not included in that collection on our own.
I guess we could have skipped this one.

475377,4,6302470021,"Review is for the MGM blu ray release. Decent-ish quality transfer with ok colors, a little dark at times. A so-so spy farce that clearly had a great influence on the Austin Powers movies.",1503100800,,188,4.5588235294117645
475378,4,6302470021,"I just received the Blu Ray version of Casino Royale. I also have a Dvd version of the film. The blu ray picture is better detail than the dvd version. I haven't watched the blu ray extras but I am disappointed that it does not include the original 1950's tv version of Casino Royale, since my Dvd does include that in it's extras.
As to the film, for some reason I like Casino Royale and watch it fairly often. The film itself is a psychedelic trainwreck and it's main flaw is Peter Sellers. His decision to leave the film without finishing it (due to his conflict with Orson Welles among other factors), left the last director standing (Val Guest) facing the challenge of trying to tie up loose ends into a cohesive plot. With some of the greatest screenwriters ever (Ben Hecht, Billy Wilder, Terry Southern, Woody Allen, etc.) involved in the screenplay, you would think the finished product would rival It's A Mad Mad Mad World; unfortunately, this is not the case, and the only coherent part of the film is the David Niven segment at the beginning, which John Huston directed.
The film's ending deteriorates and collapses (like many great comedies that can't arrive at an ending to match the buildup) into a keystone cops, pie-throwing, cowboys and indians, cliche-laden, throw everything against the wall to see what sticks finale that is an inane, ridiculous way to disguise the fact that the many directors involved had no idea how to end the film properly.
One of my favorite things about this film is the Burt Bacharach soundtrack with the songs Casino Royale (both the Herb Alpert and the singing version at the end) and The Look of Love being standouts.
Also, the psychedelic ""look"" of the film during the middle and latter half of the film (after the John Huston directed beginning) deserves recognition and ranks with Fellini's Never Bet the Devil Your Head and Bava's Danger Diabolik as some of the best use of colors in 1960's cinema.",1502409600,,1950,4.721407624633431

475397,5,6302470021,"It was a fun, sarcastic take on the foibles of the James Bond franchise. It's Austin Powers but with more veiled testicle jokes. In other words, instead of throwing the jokes in your face, like modern people tend to need, they have a bunch of guys trying (and failing) to lift huge, perfectly round boulders that always end up at croch level. James Bond is the only one who can handle it and handle it easily.",1492473600,,409,4.394736842105263

475413,5,6302470021,"Outstanding.  The BTS in this edition is superb.  One wonders how many other movies either nearly never got made or were never made due to all the BTS drama.

Outstanding.  For this movie, which is outside the Broccoli/Saltzman ""James Bond"" series, this film is an impressive achievement.  Definitely wonderful on Blu-ray.

I had seen it once before, decades ago, and remembered very little.  This is a joy of a film to see now.  Great scenes and wonderful music.

This will require a re-screening to catch the things I missed seeing it in this format.

Technically and mechanically they managed a whole helluva lot in 1967 which seems so long ago now in an era before high tech.",1480032000,,679,4.726495726495727

The most brilliant David Niven performance that I can saw in my live. It's the heart of the humor about the personality of the 007 James Bond. I love this picture. Anyone that love the good cinema should buy this b ray.

The actors are good and the music is great.  I know that many would not agree, but I find the ending to be immensely satisfying and funny.  The absurdity of the movie is what makes it so great.

It is a satire framed in the issues of the late sixties and a lot of big names.  I thoroughly enjoyed and was so glad to pick it up.  It is not, however, for the CGI addicts who must have ""special effects"" to appreciate a movie.  It's character driven, albeit as a satire, the character driven is better described as a chaotic character collision, but it is a 60s classic.",1455667200,3,519,4.079207920792079

475704,5,6302470021,"This is not for every James Bond fan.  It is a must for every David Niven fan.  Without David Niven, this film would sink into the abyss of misfiring satires.

This is about as silly as one could conceive.

It is a comedic tour de force for both David Niven and Deborah Kerr.  David Niven is the 'original James Bond'.  it is one of Peter Sellers worst performances; he seemed to have a vision of his role which is at odds with the intention of the film (silliness and satire).

Structurally, it's a mess.  The best and most coherent part is at the beginning up to the point where Peter Sellers gets involved, then all of the scenes involving David Niven or his character's (and Mata Hari's) daughter, Mata Bond, played by Joanna Pettet.

Woody Allen makes his on screen film debut, but comes across as stiff and uncomfortable, even beyond the parameters of the role.  Ursula Andress is convincing as the money obsessed Vesper Lynd.  By this point in her career, her English is quite good and she seems comfortable in front of the camera.  Barbara Bouchet as Miss Moneypenny (introduced as the original Moneypenny's daughter) is excellent.  Orson Wells is a lot of fun as Le Chiffre, a baccarat player who does magic tricks, which apparently irritated Peter Sellers no end.  The character Cooper, played by Terence Cooper (no relation?) is very good.  There are lots of others interesting performances scattered throughout the film; John  Huston, for instance, is terrific as the ill-fated 'M'.

Fortunately, Peter Sellers walked off the picture before he completed his scenes.  The downside of that is the fragmentation of the rest of the film.

This is a film that makes most sense to those of us who survived the 1960s.  Music is by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass.  Any more, folks are only vaguely aware of Herb Alpert from his music label A&M (Alpert & Moss).  He was enormously popular in the mid-ish 1960s.  I think I still have a couple of his LPs somewhere.

This is funnier if you have already seen the more contemporary 'Casino Royal'.  If you see that film after this one, as I did, you will find it's weird how many parts they have in common.  Of course reality is changed to confuse the innocent.",1414713600,8,2213,4.639175257731959

This is a film where the visuals and the cast are of more interest than the silly and stupid script. The very few clever lines are delivered by Woody Allen and appear to be his insertions, or the cynical lines delivered by Ursula Andress. The cast is very broad, a whos who of the time, including David Niven, Peter Sellers, Orson Wells, Woody Allen, Ursula Andress, Joana Pettet, Daliah Lavi, Deborah Kerr, William Holden, Charles Boyer, John Houston, Terence Cooper, Barbara Bouchet, and Jacqueline Bisset. The storyline is a bit disorganized but that does not seem to matter in a film that is not the least bit serious or conscious of continuity. My favorite part of the film is the sequence where Ursula Andress is seducing Peter Sellers in slow motion while Dusty Springfield sings The Look of Love. There is irony in that Andress has a larger role in this film than in Dr. No where she appears as the first of the Bond women.

Overall, the film is interesting to watch in regard to the esthetics and culture of the 1960s. Dont expect much from the script but the array of performers from that period is interesting.",1409961600,,1241,4.515555555555555

What would Ian Flemings novel Casino Royale be like if it was turned into a comic movie? Watch this and see. Those who expected a straight and honest version will be disappointed and hate it. Those who expected a funny comedy may be disappointed because of its cultural references that may be obscure today. A parody isn't funny if you don't know whats being parodied.

You get to see the high-tech devices of the 1960s. This is a collection of skits, like some late-night Saturday television show. People who write parodies are seldom as talented as the original. Were these writers drunk or drugged? At the end James Bond meets Dr. Noah! Insignificant little monster? More sight gags and improbable acts. The world ruled by duplicates?

The story is that ""M"" is killed, and James Bond is forced out of retirement to solve the case.  His solution-to have everybody and his brother play James Bond in order to confuse the enemy.  It ends up confusing the audience as well.  The movie has a plethora of major stars, including Woody Allen-yes, Woody Allen-as the villain.

With gadgets, gaming and girls galore, this camp classic is not only the coolest of the spy films, but it's also a brilliant parody of itself!

Will the real ""James Bond"" please stand up? When secret agency chief ""M"" [John Huston] is killed, James Bond [David Niven] is thrust out of spy retirement to help smash SMERSH, the band of hit men who are likely responsible. And to protect his real identity, Bond's name is given to numerous other agents, including Evelyn Tremble [Peter Sellers] and Bond's neurotic nephew, Jimmy [Woody Allen]. With five directors, a cast of Hollywood icons that also includes Ursula Andress, Charles Boyer, Peter O'Toole, Jacqueline Bisset and Orson Welles, a soundtrack by Burt Bacharach and a frisky, farcical script, Casino Royale is Bond. Psychedelic Bond.

FILM FACT: Burt Bacharach's musical score was praised, earning him an Academy Award nomination for the song ""The Look of Love"" and was performed by Dusty Springfield.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: At the height of the James Bond craze in the mid-sixties, the studio executives at Columbia Pictures desperately wanted to capitalize on the 007 phenomenon, but Harry Saltman and Albert ""Cubby"" Broccoli, who had a distribution deal with United Artists. owned the rights to every Ian Fleming novel except one Casino Royale, which had been acquired by producer Charles K. Feldman in 1967. A deal was struck to create the biggest James Bond extravaganza of all time, but the resulting film was something else entirely a wildly uneven parody that required the services of five directors, countless screenwriters, and a cast of international actors and celebrities, many of them reduced to fleeting cameo appearances.

In the early days before Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman were in the picture, Ian Fleming's first James Bond title had been sold to Charles K. Feldman for a substantial sum. The bad news is that it would take fifteen years to make it to the big screen. By that point, five James Bond films were already out and there seem to be no hope to make an alternate James Bond picture. The filmmakers in their infinite wisdom decided to scrap the storyline, keep the title, and make a spy spoof which had been making lots of money at that time with the success of the Matt Helm and Our Man Flint films. With Charles K. Feldmans agent connections, he established an all-star cast not to mention five directors to make the ultimate wide spy spoof with the number of 007 attached to it. The result was Casino Royale.'

It's a dark time for the spy world. Five agents go to a remote spot to one car to seek out bringing Sir James Bond [David Niven] out of retirement for his assistance. Unfortunately, James Bond has been living a modest life and does not much care about the spy world as he used to. That is, until an attempt on his life at his residence claims the life of his former boss ""M"" [John Huston] whose only remains happen to be his toupee. After some careful thought at his former boss' residence, he takes over his superior's position to counteract on the mysterious deaths within the organisation using his moniker for recruits to use in order to confuse the organisation known as SMERSH and its chief enemy Dr. Noah [Woody Allen]. This includes a baccarat expert Evelyn Tremble / James Bond 007 [Peter Sellers] and his long lost daughter with Mata Hari. Together they infiltrate their main hideout which is under the cover name ""Casino Royale.""

It was best that a familiarity with the Our Man Flint series and the Austin Powers films are enough to satisfy with this all star vehicle. The wackiness plus the use of the kind of jokes that you don't know whether to laugh or not happen to be used to a great extent. A lot of the craziness going on in this movie makes a viewer wonder if the filmmakers were all on something during the production. Nonetheless, it's a psychedelic spy spoof with a nutty sense of some of the previous Bond films as well as brandishing its own brand of cool, thanks to a solid score by Burt Bacharach and Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass.

The look of the sets in this film is quite breath-taking and full of colour and uses a wonderful stained glass palette that let all the colours explode out sixties style. As for the performances, they all range from being in the movie a little while to a glorified cameo to some uncredited that do surprise and make me grin at their use in this film. All is different in this incarnation of James Bond and 007, and this multi-directed film came with much criticism and was not looked on too highly at the time. It was also not a box office success. However in this day in age when spoofing the sixties is a happening, it does freak me out in a way that spreads it away from the traditional Bond series and into its own groovy mould.

By the end, the budget of Casino Royale had swollen from its initial cost of $12 million to more than twice that amount. And no wonder the costs were high considering the extensive locations included Paris, the South of France, West Berlin, Ireland, and the Pinewood and MGM-British studios in England. The mammoth slapstick climax alone, featuring Jean-Paul Belmondo as a French Legionnaire, George Raft as himself, and countless famous faces and cost $1 million and took two months to shoot! Yet, despite the film's troubled production history, there is fun to be had amid the insanity, everything from Scottish comedian Ronnie Corbett as a robot with a German accent to the lovely Jacqueline Bisset as Miss Goodthighs. So, if you want to experience the Hollywood-style Sixties, this is the ultimate pit stop and an enjoyable one had by all.

Casino Royale was a big box-office hit and it's not hard to find passionate fans of the film due to its oddball and chaotic structure; it's closer to a sixties ""happening"" than a major studio release. After all, what's not to like about a film that features a Burt Bacharach score performed by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass, Dusty Springfield singing ""The Look of Love"" while Ursula Andress seduces Peter Sellers, Woody Allen in one of his first screen roles as the megalomaniac Dr. Noah (billed as ""the tallest dwarf in the world""), lavish special effects, and groovy art direction with all the psychedelic trappings?

Blu-ray Video Quality  Here we have an awesome 2.35:1 aspect ratio and an even more stunning 1080p image is about the most inconsistent that I've encountered on Blu-Ray, then again I've never seen a film with half a dozen directors, either. Image quality varies from scene to scene, but it's a reflection of the source material I'm sure. I will say that Ursula Andress looks as good as ever. Though the detail has been improved over the previous inferior DVD format release, there's still a bit of edge enhancement that I noticed. Still, it's what I believe to be a step up from the previous DVD and if this kind of movie floats your boat - should find a nice home next to the ""real"" Bond movies in your collection.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The disc has a 5.1 DTS HD Master Audio track, but let's not get too excited? The Audio has been cleaned up a bit and though this title in no way competes with the newer soundtracks, does have a moment or two of greatness. Take ""greatness"" with a grain of salt, if you please. Dialogue sounds nice and natural with little to no distortion. It's about as close to a mono track as you can get without actually being mono. Still, it's not a horrible or unlistenable mix and for that and I'm very pleased.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Bond Historians Steven Jay Rubin and John Cork: Steven Jay Rubin is author of The Complete James Bond Encyclopaedia, and John Cork has co-authored several books about Bond, as well as biographies of Ian Fleming, Albert ""Cubby"" Broccoli and Harry Saltzman. Cork has also co-produced many of the documentaries included on the ""ultimate"" Bond DVDs. Between them, Steven Jay Rubin and John Cork provide a wealth of detail not only about Casino Royale and its troubled history, but also about film history in general and various personalities both in front of and behind the camera. The commentary often takes on a ""six degrees of James Bond"" quality, as the speakers riff on the subsequent careers and chance connections of people involved in the film. Example: Woody Allen appeared in Casino Royale and did uncredited writing work. In 2006, Woody Allen was nominated for a screenwriting OSCAR, as was Paul Haggis, making it the only year when two writers who had worked on the same James Bond story were nominated for an OSCAR.

Special Feature: The Making of Casino Royale [2007] [41:30] This special documentary presents a relatively straightforward, chronological account of the film's genesis and troubled production, using informative interview footage from many of the participants. They include directors Val Guest and Joseph McGrath; actresses Joanna Pettet, Daliah Lavi and Jacqueline Bisset; cameramen Nicholas Roeg and Alex Thomson; and assistant director Roy Baird. The documentary is divided into five parts: Bond . . . James Bond?, A Three Ring Circus, More Directors . . . More Stars!, The Big Climax and It's a Wrap!

Theatrical Trailer [1967] [2:22] This Original Theatrical Trailer announces that it is Too big for just one Bond! At least so they claimed.

Finally, this 1967 `Casino Royale' definitely inspires a 'cult' appreciation. Similar to its finale - this remains a jumbled mass of bubbles and fun. If you can allow the fun to sweep over you rather than scrutinize it - you will definitely be better-off for your viewing experience. Plots don't always have to make sense - and looking at `Casino Royale' as another disjointed 'runaway production' kind of adds to its kitsch. I like the performances and all tongue-in-cheek and the sexy 1960's gals like Ursula Andress, Joanna Pettet, Daliah Lavi, Jacqueline Bisset etc. plus Bacharach's peppy theme gives it some real joy. The Blu-ray, in my opinion, represents the best it's going to get for this psychedelic James Bond film. Have some fun... the price encourages it and a total honour to add this to my James Bond Blu-ray Collection as it is a fun ride throughout its 125 minutes. Highly Recommended!

The first version was a made for TV drama, with Barry Nelson as ""Card Sense Jimmy Bond"" a Cia Agent.  With the success of Dr. No and From Russia with Love, this version was made as a Comedy mostly. With Peter Sellers and Woody Allen in the cast it can't really be called a drama.  There is lots of slapstick comedy.  Ursula Andres, almost the first Bond girl from Dr. No, returns as Vesper Lynde the not so good Bond Girl.  The movie is very funny and enjoyable.  The third version was made with Daniel Craig as a more gritty serious Bond.  I would acquire all three versions.  Each one has it own unique take on the same story.

David Niven as Sir James Bond, the retired spy is great, Peter Sellers is always very funny.  You should also see, What's New Pussy Cat, because some of the actors are the same and it referenced in this version of Casino Royal, when Mata Bond lifts a man hole cover in Berlin.

I love this because of my nostalgia for it--as well as for way I can laugh at jokes I never got as a child ('Hello Sailor'--Peter Sellers); how it taught me more about England, history, sex (oh my!); or how I can admit some of it is truly over the top bad--to the point of being genius!

475816,5,6302470021,"First off, it must be said that the 1967 version of CASINO ROYALE is either a film you like or you hate--there's no inbetween! Almost everyone I know who has seen it is either mildly amused, or they just don't like it at all. I can appreciate this, because the film really only makes sense after multiple viewings and some research of the subject. Even the most diehard Bond fans, of which I count myself among since an early age, usually dismiss this film. This film, however, takes on a magic all its own, and after 25 years since I first saw it, it is the only Bond in my personal top ten, and the only Bond film I will own on Blu-Ray. Other than being a one-of-a-kind film experience (and on the big screen it is breathtaking!), there are some facts that are indisputable--it IS a big mess, casting ranges from the sublime to the ridiculous, the idea of multiple James Bonds turns many people off (look at the billing in the end credits), the script had too many people working on it, and the overall film had too many directors to work properly. The problems are legend! But, this film has a lot going for it as well...David Niven is, as usual, his delightful self as Sir James Bond, ringleader of what is certainly a three-ring circus! The cardre of women in the film (less Bond Girls, more Characters)--Ursula Andress, Joanna Pettet, Deborah Kerr, Daliah Lavi, Barbara Bouchet, Anna Quayle & Jacqueline Bisset--all turn in lively performances that keep the action moving. In many ways, because of them, this is sort of a women's picture. Collectively, they have more to do than the Bond Girls normally have to do. The music is not only one of the finest scores of Burt Bacharach (amply aided by lyricist Hal David, Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass, and Dusty Springfield)  but one of the best EVER written! The standard ""The Look Of Love"" was written for this film--and nominated for an Oscar! The production and costume design are eye popping, and need to be enjoyed at least in a letterbox format. Blu-Ray takes the look of this film to a level I don't even think the film makers would have perceived in 1967.

I usually call Will Ferrel humor stupid but I laugh almost as much as I go ""Come on that's...."", here the laughter to come on ratio is like 1 to 10. The plot to this movie just randomly happens thanks to trying to work at least three different scripts into one movie, and it doesn't even seem to try and give an overall story except for total caous.

Every male James Bond portayal seems stupid, Woody Allen is a blumbering idiot (yes that's what his character is supposed to be but, I can't stand it in this case), Peter Sellers preformence really made me not like him when he's actually brillent and David Nieven just was a complete jerk. He makes Berry Nelson look like a gentalmen as Nieven's attitude is ""I'm more concerned with what I want, woman and beautiful flowers not the country I served and continue to serve for x years. Screw you all.""

Now the girls Vasper, Moneypenny and Nieven's daughter I liked but, most of their purpose is to be in hot outfits, seduce everyone they met, talk to Nieven and for Vasper to (SPOILER ALERT SO SKIP THIS NEXT BIT) kill Peter Sellers, thank you.

Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, Feldman made a farce movie out of Ian Fleming's novel Casino Royale. Casino Royale is a party that celebrates the 007 James Bond mania of the time. The music by Burt Bacarach and Herb Alpert and Tijuana Brass is an underrated classic. This film has a lot of star power, sex appeal, action scenes and high production values. A young David Prowse(Star Wars) played a Frankenstein monster who shows James Bond how to escape from an underground lair! Parts of Ian Fleming's book are in the movie. There's a card game at Casino Royale and Le Chiffre gets killed by SMERSH agents. This film is as mature and realistic as a Get Smart episode! David Niven, Woody Allen, Ursula Andress, Dalia Lavi and Peter Sellers play James Bond in the film! Barbara Bouchet is quite good as Miss Moneypenny.

Of course, the later Bond, that we all enjoy so much, is sophisticated and tenacious, refined and intelligent... all qualities poked at by this version of the Pink Panther type romp here!

BUT! YOU MUST SEE THIS! It really does something, by filling in the history of the Bond story, and highlights what could have happened to it. Bond likely would not have lasted this long, if this type of twist were adopted as the permanent Bond fiasco! LOL

I mean, look at the list of stars in this thing. No wonder it is what it is! We have a Pink Panther already; so, thank EON for make the current Bond what he is!

It was literally written off the cuff as the movie was being filmed, giving new meaning to the term, ""daily rushes.""  What plot is present is seeped in the 60's ethos. It commands major stars, both in credited and non-credited roles; it seemed that everyone wanted to get into the fun. The director(s) literally made the movie with a mind to include every cliche they could think of. George Raft was included just to show him tossing a coin. This movie is great fun. What plot there is bears no resemblance to reality. The enmity between Peter Sellers and Orson Wells was so great that they refused to be on the set at the same time as Wells. Of course a major scene of the movie involved having both in the same room; accommodations were made to have the scenes filmed separately. The finished product made the movie more disjointed than it already was. After working on the picture for some time, Sellers decided to take a two-week vacation, and was summarily fired by the producer. Unfilmed scenes requiring his presence had to be re-shot or re-edited, making the movie even more fractured. That is of no account. This and the avowed purpose of the producer to make a ""psychedelice movie"" makes Casino Royale an enjoyable mess and a delight to behold and to watch ---  as long as the viewer does not take anything in the movie seriously (the regular James Bond movies take themselves very, very seriously, too seriously) and preferably after having a few.",1349740800,,1812,4.677115987460815

Helmed by too many directors, Val Guest (according to a interview I saw with him) did most of the shooting after the muddled production drove away the other directors and most importantly Peter Sellers.  Uneven, sure, but there are bright moments in the film too. For me, the absolute highlight is Burt Bacharach's music, including the great theme and ""The Look of Love.""  Still, the this version of Casino Royale is fun and a document of the time.  It's not erased by the more recent remake, but stands in contrast to the typical Bond films.

Of course, that also means that like other reviewers have noted, there are a few scenes that just fall flat.

It's hard to describe this movie and in many ways harder to rate it.  Even in the extra about the movie the one director admits that four different men directed different segments, there were rewrites up to the last minute and Peter Sellers walked off the set and did not return, forcing major rewrites of the ending.

So the story ends up being a bit of an incoherent mess.  There are themes that run through the movie, and the actors do a superb job holding scenes together, but there is no real solid thread in the end.

But oh is it a fun ride.  The fight at the ending has to be one of the most outlandish brawls ever filmed, and yet its still entertaining.

475982,2,6302470021,"CASINO ROYALE -- 1967, reminds me very much of ""Alice's Adventures In Wonderland"".  Only ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" makes a great deal more sense.

This movie boasts an all-star cast: Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress, David Niven, Joanna Petite, Dahiah Levi- and Woody Allen.  In featured supporting roles are Deborah Kerr, Charles Boyer, William Holden, John Huston, George Raft, and Kurt Kazner.  Others appearing in featured roles are: Gabriella Lucidi, Tracy Reed, Tracy Crisp, Elaine Taylor and Angela Sinclair. The four separate segments, (featuring four separate ""James Bonds""), were directed by four different directors, including John Huston and Val Guest.

I listend to the ""Making-Of"" featurette, featuring director Val Guest, before watching either of the two ""Casino Royale"" versions included in this DVD -- and I am very glad I did.  Amongst other things Mr. Guest revealed is that the main feature, (the colour, 1967, theatrical version of Casino Royale), was based on the novel, ""Casino Royale"" by Ian Fleming in the very, very loosest way.
In fact, all they had of the novel was the title, and the sets.  The story -- such as it is -- was entirely made up and written for this movie.

This helps make SOME sense of the four stories within the 1967 film.
They have four different James Bond, and four different stories.  The first story, with David Niven, is full of stereotypes of Scottish people, running through a large, dark castle, people falling from being poisoned, people running through large areas of land, and sexual innendos.  It co-stars Joanna Petite as ""Mata Bond"", the supposed daughter of James Bond and Mata Hari, (talk about making a talkie film seem like it should have been made in the silent era!)  Ms. Bond gets involved in a weird spy-school, and the showing of a film....  Don't ask.  Even David Niven, (and even beautiful Ms. Pettet can't save it, either.)

The second part stars Peter Sellers as James Bond.  He is such a famous spy, that people ask for his autograph.  (Talk about realism in movies!  Famous spys are ALWAYS asked for their autographs in real life, of course!)  This segment also features Orson Wells -- who for some reason performs a magic trick involving the levitation of a ""Princess Aiesha""....a segment he repeated, (if my memory is correct), on a segmemnt of the ""I Love Lucy"" show!  Even Orsen Wells can't save this part of the movie.

I am not wasting my time watching the other two segments, (or is it three?)  This movie is supposed to be ""the ultimate psychedolic secret agnet satire.""  Well, as far as psychedolic goes, it is SO mixed-up, SO confusing, with stories SO bad, that it should really be shown in every drug-recovery program! This movie is to real spies as going to Kindergarten has to do with studying the finer points of constitional law.  And it is NOT a satire.  It is a farce, with a very few satirical elements, (such as calling one of the characters, ""Dr. Noah""), thrown in.

I saw this movie when it first came out, and wonder now how I --and the rest of my family -- were able to sit through it.  I wonder how ANYONE could have sat -- and can sit -- through it.  Full of totally implausible, ridiculous and, yes, quite stupid segments.  Where does it all lead?  To all the characters getting killed?  Or imprisoned? (A la 'Seinfeld'?)  Or discovering that the entire movie was a dream, (A la 'The Bob Newhart Show'? Or a famous season-end cliff-hanger of ""Dallas""?)  Or another, equally contrived ending?  To tell which -- if any -- of these are the ending would be to spoil this movie for those who haven't yet had the excruciating esperience of watching it.  But then, this movie spoils itself from beginning to end.

There are only TWO reasons to even borrow this DVD out of the library.  One is the truly upbeat, innovative, tuneful and memorable music by BURT BACHARACH.  His music seems to breathe life into even the dullest, most boring and most hackneyed scenes.  Watching this movie shows how important movie music can be!

The other reason is the inclusion in this disc of the 1954, black and white ""CLIMAX' version of ""Casino Royale"".  The story here has real suspense, good acting, and, (most important of all), a story which is followable!  Starring the late Barry Nelson, the late Peter Lorre, and the radiant Linda Christian, (the very FIRST 'Bond Girl"" -- who, at this writing, is a happily alive 83 years old!), it shows the difference between a ""trying-to-be farce"", and a good, solid suspense story.  Watching this segment is a true pleasure, and shows it's not how much money one spends that counts, (this episode of a TV-Anthology series, filmed in black and white, obviously cost FAR less than the extravagant colour theatrical movie of thirteen years later) -- it's the quality of the writing that counts.  ALL the actors in the 1967 version try SO hard to make the movie work -- but with a story and script that sabotage their every effort, all their hard work is hopeless.

So see this disc for the music and the ""Climax"" segment.  Despite the dizzying psychedelia of the main movie, these two things will keep you entertained and grounded, and realizing that 1) there really IS some talent in the entertainment world, and 2) there is no need to think that everything is getting ""curiouser and curiouser"".  Some things ARE good in life, still.  All one must do is seek them out!",1284336000,,5400,4.76318622174381

Ursula Andress' name (Bear Naked?) doesn't appear in David Thomson's BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONAR OF FILM, but so what?  She's the best-looking piece of cineflesh in this hashish spectacle, and more than anything else, by far, partly naked, wiggling femenine bodies in every imaginable situation are in and of themselves all (or at least most) of what this movie has to offer.  Wildly forgettable Jiggle Music by Burt Bacharach.

Hashish spectacle, you say?  Well, mostly the result of confusion about production (who's in charge?); the primary star quits the show; there are at least three different, unresolved scripts; it appears there are four directors, each with his own favorite part of and kind of movie to direct, and casting is searching for any putative star or personality they can find to plug a hole as a cameo, and the scene designer(s) have gone stark, staring mad.  Let's go back:  It's 1967.  Five years ago DR. NO and the new Sean Connery took the world by storm, launching the James Bond 007 craze.  It was followed by FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, another sensation, and an even better movie.  With what looks like a franchise in the bud, Albert Broccoli appears to have found a gold mine.  How to get some of that money?

Fleming's first Bond novel, CASINO ROYALE, a wildly improbable story about an attempt by a novice agent to bankrupt a crack but corrupt soviet functionary with a gambling habit and millions of siphoned-off Soviet money to lose, at a crowded French casino, became somehow available.  The Producers dove for it and began production as quickly as possible.  Catastrophe!  The story proved useless.  They couldn't get Connery, but they got his co-star from DR. NO, the stunning Ms. Andress, gave her the name of Vesper Lind and kept her before the camera for as long as possible.  Apparently Peter Sellers, headliner, was to have played a presumably comic Bond, but he bailed out and then into the more professionally produced and sillier PINK PANTHER movies.  Was he miffed because the producers hired Woody Allen to play yet another version of Bond?  And let him bring his own material?  He needn't have been.  Allen's appearances on screen, are about as amusing as watching gangrene fester.

The star of the mix-up appears to be David Niven, who manages to get through it without making an ass of himself.  He plays in rather an over-longish, not terribly funny bit, against Deborah Kerr.  She's the widowed lady of a castle staffed and stuffed with horny, nubile red-haired scotch maidens, and he's an interloper come to confront or to comfort her.  Either or both.

What saves this dog and pony show is the fact that the Psychedelic Sixties are in full bloom, and the Western World turns for a decade, into Lotus Land.  It was like the 20s, but instead of Gin, with Marijuana.  It was everywhere.  It was cheap.  In big cities, people gave it away on street corners.  People kept it on cocktail tables in sticks, rolled, or they offered it to you as a matter of course.  People everywhere began to find other aspects beside the obvious desirable, in viewing cinema, and were often to be seen with the sound low or disguised or overriden by other sounds or music, simply watching the screen and laughing simplemindedly at what they took to be hallucinations.  This social blowback it was that gave the movie its saving grace.  It wasn't funny, it was preposterous, but in a drugged-up, high kind of way.  The movie began in hard focus, but changed until wide swaths of it oozed and swam in psychedellic pattern and color, indicative of nothing so much as a good head trip.  At one point, toward the end, a shapely woman named Joanna Pettet (possibly an English, Australian or New Zeland musical comedy personality) who was supposed to be James Bond's daughter by Mata Hari, began an interminable music and dance sequence -- a blonde woman dressed in sort-of Baliinese pagoda costume -- that goes in every conceivable and many inconceivable directions, up, down, side-wise, until, somehow, it ends.  Or just, just...  Disintegrates.  Don't ask.  And somewhere in there there's George Raft, doing...  Please, don't ask.

The long anticipated Bacarat game with LeChiffre takes place, more or less as expected, with Orson Welles, a sweaty Hindenberg -- corpulent quite beyond belief -- doing magic tricks above the gaming tables.  Charles Boyer, William Holden, John Houston, Jean-Paul Belmondo do their five minutes, variously, and take their money and run.  And somehow, throughout all this, occasionally, there's an extraordinary-looking woman in a big black wig, called Daliah Lavi, (East Jordan movie star) who apparently came with the Producer(s).  At her entrance on camera she is first thrown to the ground, fully dressed; and later appears naked, strapped to an operating table for Woody Allen to play with.  (Ms. Lavi can be seen to advantage in THE RETURN OF DOCTOR MABUSE, as The Photographer.)  Please, don't...

Anyway, I have the BOND collection, love them all for their eccentricities and excesses, and watch them frequently.  If what TV broadcasts or newscasts show me have any truth, drugs of many kinds are coming into the country regularly, dependably, and in quantity, and consequently one thinks they must be available at reasonable cost.  Somewhere or other...  If so, why not enjoy this particular 007 fantasy in the way it was intended/marketed?  Or any of the others, for that matter?  What's the difference?  I certainly used to escape regularly into them and, for an hour or so, imagine myself the dashing stud assassin of British Intelligence, wallowing in conspicuous consumption and the wet laps of magnificent women.  As long as the images remain stable on their media, why not enjoy ourselves again, and yet again?  Bond films are all Boss-Man sex dreams.  Why shouldn't we too dream we are Boss-Men?",1254787200,,5941,4.930443548387097
476010,3,6302470021,"I did not enjoy this film when I first saw it on television, because of the incoherent plot, but my opinion has changed after watching it again years later on DVD.  After all, this is the only James Bond film that unabashedly makes fun of the world of 007 through sarcasm and slapstick, and incorporates the psychedelic atmosphere of the mid to late 1960s, with an all star cast including David Niven, Peter Sellers, Deborah Kerr, William Holden, Orson Welles, Woody Allen and Ursula Andress, arguably the best known Bond girl and only actress to appear in both an official Bond movie (Dr. No) and an unofficial one.  The musical score is pleasant, topped off by Dusty Springfield's memorable rendition of ""The Look of Love"".  Casino Royale is a welcomed alternative to the dark and humorless official Bond entries of Timothy Dalton and now Daniel Craig.  Life is frequently somber and challenging, let's at least have fun when watching 007.

Even if you dislike this movie, you may still want to purchase it to complement your James Bond collection, and for the bonus material; the 1954 CBS television program Casino Royale, the first ever 007 production for either TV or cinema that features American actor Barry Nelson (not Sean Connery) as the first James Bond, Linda Christian the first Bond girl, and Peter Lorre the first Bond villian.",1249344000,2,1342,4.868421052631579

What started out as an attempt to make a serious Bond film turned into one mess of a film, but strange as it seems to me, it does seem to flow into one cohesive plot. This captures the essence of the sixties; the fashions, psychedelic craze (this was done in '67, in my opinion, the hippiest year of the late sixties). David Niven is funny as the ""real"" James Bond, though the stuttering in the beginning can get quite irritating. And I do enjoy his jabs at his namesake. Peter Sellers is his usual comic self as Evelyn Tremble and he has amazing chemistry with Bond alum Ursula Andress in another sexy Bond girl role, though more assertive than Honey Ryder. When they're together on screen, its some of the sexiest scenes I've seen (and done with classy taste compared to today's garbage).

476012,4,6302470021,"Casino Royale is a splendid, hilarious spoof of James Bond films--despite the fact that the film could be seen as being divided into long sequences or segments that are somewhat loosely tied together. The plot is easy enough to follow despite the fact that you will be introduced to a myriad castoff characters; and I really liked those funny scenes that poke fun at the romance scenes in the real James Bond flicks! The cinematography and the choreography are brilliant and the acting is convincing, too. The casting is also good and there are so many jokes and good performances here you'll never get bored in the slightest!

When the action starts, we quickly meet the ""original"" James Bond (David Niven) who is coaxed out of retirement by a small group of international emissaries sent to his reclusive home. There's a real problem all right--spies from all over the world are being killed off; and the world can only count on James Bond to solve the problem. Bond is quirky all right; and David Niven plays Bond to the hilt. We see Bond begin to counter evil forces when he delivers a toupee (yes, a toupee) to the widow of one of the emissaries who is in actuality ""agent Mimi"" (Deborah Kerr); and among the countless funny scenes is agent Mimi who winds up swinging from a drain pipe in a poorly planned attempt to get out of a locked room. Moreover, we also see James Bond take charge in London where he decides to name all the agents in the group James Bond so as to confuse the enemy organization SMERSH and also do away with ""Le Chiffre"" (Orson Welles), a man who raises money for his own gambling and SMERSH who aces his game at baccarat by wearing special glasses that let him see every card on the table!

James Bond (Niven) also must reunite with his daughter by Mata Hari, Mata Bond (Joanna Pettet)--and Joanna gives an excellent performance as Mata Bond who helps her father fight SMERSH and ""Le Chiffre."" There's another great performance by Ursula Andress as double-agent Vesper Lynd - 007; and Peter Sellers gives an outstanding performance as yet another ""James Bond"" spy whose name is actually Evelyn Tremble! Sellers as Tremble ahs some wonderful scenes playing baccarat with Orson Welles although reportedly they disliked each other so intensely that the camera crew had to film each one of them at a time and then cut and paste film together to make it look that they were at the table at the same time!

Of course, from here the plot can go anywhere; and the cast of character actors only serves to make the movie even livelier. Who exactly is ""Le Chiffre?"" Who is in charge of SMERSH--and what do they really want from James Bond and the forces of good? What happens when Vesper Lynd is kidnapped and Evelyn decides to rescue her? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch and find out!

The DVD has a few good bonus features. We get a copy of a television show from 1954 about Casino Royale from Climax! Mystery Theater; the theatrical trailer and a feature entitled ""Psychedelic Cinema."" The 40th Anniversary Edition should have additional features including a ""making-of"" documentary.

Casino Royale may not have been the best picture ever produced; but it's funny as all heck! This is great fare for people who want a lot of laughs and the sight gags are terrific, too.

476027,4,6302470021,"I admit this; my love for Bond is newfound really.  Up until Daniel Craig stepped into the role my interest was minimal.  After watching Craig brilliantly convey humanity in `Casino Royale' I knew that I needed to research this classic character a little more.  Since then I've seen a few Brosnan and a few Connery, but honestly I have yet to truly tap into the legend that is James Bond.  I did however snatch this little ditty up a while back, anxious to see how they could have spoofed this story.  Having read the novel from which it stems, and of course having seen the 2006 masterpiece I really, really, really wanted to see how Sellers, Niven and Allen would handle it.

What I found was as my title suggests; a messy, convoluted and confusing film that never failed to keep me interested.

What `Casino Royale' has working against it is the lack of fluidity in the script.  This is an amalgam of spy spoofs here, not just a comedic rendering of Fleming's novel.  It covers many plot points from a wide array of Bond films and so it winds up feeling like an `Austin Powers' film as apposed to a strictly Bond comedy.  If you are not familiar with most of Bond's films then you may miss a lot of the jokes too, which is where I had some issues.

In parts the film is great, and the acting on almost all parts is a joy.  Woody Allen is superb in his supporting role, and the whole finale of the film is uproarious thanks to him.  Peter Sellers is also golden as the young spy who is passed off as Bond (everyone is called Bond, which is one of the funnier yet more confusing jokes in the film).  Peter Nevin is rather uninspired here, but he's forgivable thanks to Sellers and Allen.  The cast is rather huge, and that is one thing `Casino Royale' has going for it.  Everyone involved puts on a great show, and cameos from the likes of Orson Welles are very welcome and very rewarding.

In the end I can't say that this is a perfect comedy, but it tries hard and at times it is marvelous.  The scenes that work well work extremely well and they help make up for the scenes in between that drag on or fail to excite.  Regardless, the film is mostly entertaining.  I personally found myself intrigued and engrossed throughout; for by the time my interest starts to wane something funny happens and my interest is taken hold of yet again.

476031,2,6302470021,"""Casino Royale"" is one of those films, ala ""Cleopatra"" and ""Heaven's Gate,"" whose backstory is more interesting than anything that made it to the screen.

Before Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli came calling on Ian Fleming in 1961 to propose the deal that would give birth to the James Bond film series that continues today, the author sold his first 007 novel, ""Casino Royale,"" to CBS-TV. After the network adapted the book for a 1954 episode of ""Climax,"" the film rights passed to Gregory Ratoff. Once the Saltzman-Broccoli films gathered box-office momentum, producer Charles K. Feldman, a former associate of Broccoli's, bought the rights from Ratoff's widow in the hope of cashing in on his friend's success. So much for loyalty. Believing he could not compete directly with the ""official"" Bond films, Feldman turned ""Casino Royale"" into a spoof. ""Bondmania"" which reached its peak with the 1965 release of ""Thunderball"" was winding down by then, but ""Casino Royale"" sold enough tickets to become the third biggest box-office hit of 1967 (""You Only Live Twice,"" that year's real Bond film, took second place behind ""The Dirty Dozen""). But the bloated budget meant it could never qualify as a success.

The screenplay, to which ""Catch 22"" author Joseph Heller, Terry Southern, and Billy Wilder are said to have made contributions, shows signs of too many chefs at work in the kitchen, which was clearly the case behind the camera. No less than five directors are credited, so it's not surprising that the film has no real direction. It's a mess. But, hey, this was the `60s, baby, an era of ""doin' your own thing,"" transcendental meditation, surrealism in music (""I am the walrus, goo-goo-gagoob""), so there was no need to be coherent.

""Casino Royale"" has more in common with Feldman's earlier ""What's New, Pussycat?"" than it does with James Bond. Both films co-starred Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress, and Woody Allen, and surrounded them with other stars, though ""Casino Royale"" has the more glittering lineup with even the likes of Deborah Kerr, William Holden, and Orson Welles joining in. Unfortunately, the laughs are few and far between with Allen providing the most amusing moments. Burt Bacharach's music score is a classic, however, highlighted by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass' performance of the title tune.

The 1954 television version of Ian Fleming's first 007 novel is included on the DVD. The live telecast survives today on kinescope, a crude pre-video technique in which the program was filmed directly off a monitor as it was transmitted into the viewers' homes. The production itself is a little crude, too, but it remains watchable.

James Bond is an American agent in this version, and star Barry Nelson portrays him less enigmatically than any of the actors who followed in the role. One thing this Bond is not is larger than life. ""I'm no hero,"" he says after being roughed up by his foes, ""I don't like pain."" This certainly isn't the more nonchalant Bond of the big screen, but it is a convincing one. Peter Lorre makes an effective LeChiffre, Bond's first adversary, and Linda Christian is good, too. This production isn't entirely faithful to the novel, but considering the time constraints, that couldn't be expected.

This movie is very clever and every actor is hilarious in this all-star cast, from David Niven (as the Original, retired James Bond) to his wily and troublesome nephew, Jimmy Bond, played to perfection by Woody Allen. Deborah Kerr plays Mimi, villainess turned nun for her love of Sir James. (""Doodle me, Jamey!"") Peter Sellers has fun with many costume changes but does not play the bumbler; rather, he is an expert in Bacarat standing in for 007 to help beat one of the bad guys (played hilariously by Orson Wells) and assisted by the fabulously beaded and feathered Ursula Andress!
The sets are those of dreams and nightmares, with plenty of the mod patterns of the 60's when this movie was produced. If you love off the wall comedy, this one is a keeper.

Will it work?  Who knows.

The 1967 spoof of CASINO ROYALE was an expensive trainwreck of the highest order.  Most of the time, it functions on the level of a bad Frankie & Annette Beach movie.  The only funny parts belong to Woody Allen as Little Jimmy Bond and his mad plot to kill all men taller than him.

Want to make this interesting?  Address the utter chaos of the making of the film.  Four or five directors, the ever-evolving script reaching for complete mediocrity, etc.

This is the movie where Peter Sellers (who was insane) walked off the set and never came back...and the producers didn't care.  They merely gave the rest of the film to David Niven as a stuttering, older Bond.  One biography said Sellers left after Orson Welles mistook Sellers for Woody Allen in an elevator and another said it was just Sellers losing it and wrecking another movie (check out THE LIFE & DEATH OF PETER SELLERS film or the excellent biography, MR. STRANGELOVE).

But, please, don't try and trick people into thinking this was a 1960s classic.

476055,4,6302470021,"I must be in the class that loves it, because this is a funny movie - lots of chuckles from the understated performances of David Niven as Bond, especially in the Scottish castles with the 19 daughters.

Enter Woody Allen as Bond's long lost son, Jimmy Bond: ""I have a very low threshhold of death.  My doctor says I can't have bullets enter my body at any time.""  If you don't find this quote amusing or funny, that's because it's not!  And neither is Woody - as usual!  Quite fortunately, his first slot only lasts a minute.  His second appearance, later in the movie is much better, largely due to the fact that he doesn't speak much.  But back to main characters.

In order to confuse his enemies, the original Bond (Niven) has a new 'James Bond' trained - this time one that can resist beautiful women, as threats to the life of Bond usually come in the guise of beautiful women.  Some great scenes of these gorgeous girls coming out to kiss the new Bond, only to have him Judo throw them to the ground - hilarious!

There are as many funny scenes in this film as there are beautiful girls. It reaches levels of absurdity that are almost profound!  Of course you know not to expect a real Bond movie.  Look at the cover of the zone 2 Casino Royale - here's a test.  If you think there's something humorous just looking at this guy's face (and remember - he's Bond!), then you'll probably like this movie.  There is one scene however where Sellers suddenly becomes Bond - like out of the blue - I didn't quite catch the logic there first time around..  First he's Evelyn Tremble trying to reach some unknown objective and next thing he's Bond!  What?!  HOLD ON JUST A SECOND.  I went back and watched it again! ---- Evelyn Tremble (Sellars) wrote a book on winning at gambling.  After being seduced (and given $100,000 to gamble with), he agrees to take on evil SMERSH representitive Le Chiffre (Orson Welles) at the Baccarat table - under the guise of *James Bond* (so as not to be recognized as the famous author Evelyn Tremble!).  His chance of putting LeChiffre out of commission comes in winning against LeChiffre at high stakes Baccarrat.

Later, the daughter of the David Niven James Bond and Mata Hari, is brought into play.  Her job is to stop LeChiffre's art auction from being able to raise enough enough money to help him cover gambling debts, thus forcing him back to the table (where Evelyn Tremble, aka James Bond, will play against him).

Thumbing their noses to ""What's New Pussycat?"" (1965, which I saw recently and loathed), young Mata Hari is escaping her mother's East German headquarters where she'd been sent to foil the auction and as she and her taxi driver are running away, she considers going down a sewer grate in the road - as she opens the man-hole cover, the theme song from ""What's New Pussycat?"" comes wafting out!  ""Better not go down there!"" says her cab driver.  Fortunately, this movie never does, though both movies were made around the same time.

Actually, I thought this movie was great even when I was getting lost in the story the first time - that much more reason to watch it the second time - you notice a lot more jokes, and start catching the twisted logic in the plot.

At one point later in the movie, a certain Miss Goodthighs puts some 'LSD' in the form of alka-seltzer in Sellar's drink and a mock Beatles song comes on as they sink into a fantasy.

When things start getting even more splicy and psychedelic later on (and they do!), don't give up!  Consider it a challenge! Or just 'go with the flow'..  It's pure audacity. And rest assured, after the flying saucer comes, things start to resume the thread of logic again - logic, that is, for this wacked out 1967 made James Bond spoof...  ;)",1206662400,4,3752,4.514074074074074

When Feldman could not obtain the services of Sean Connery (still under contract to Cubby Broccoli & Harry Saltzman), he decided to make a spoof instead.  His instructions to Terry Southern and the other writers was to ""throw out the plot"" -- inwhich they thoroughly succeeded.

476057,5,6302470021,"`Casino Royale', the original 1960's version is one of those movies which seems to improve with age. I can recall reviews at the time of its release saying that its primary failing was that it parodied a genre, the James Bond movies, which were themselves a parody of the spy thriller genre, so it was much like taking coals to Newcastle. The movie was done with much of the same talent which contributed to the similar `What's New Pussycat', primarily the superb comic talents of Peter Sellers and Woody Allen. One of the very best things I can say about `Casino Royale' is that where these two failed to redeem `What's New Pussycat', they succeeded quite well thank you in the spy spoof.
One of the things one notices upon looking back at this flick is that it may have been an unsung precursor to the general genre of `all star' spoof movie. Most of this genre has usually been traced back to `Airplane', `Blazing Saddles', and maybe the early Woody Allen movies such as `What's New, Tiger Lily' and `Take the Money and Run'. In fact, I think Casino Royal stands up quite well as one of the better early representatives of this genre.
One thing this has in spades is a fine collection of cameo and major performances by the likes of David Niven, Orson Welles, George Raft, William Holden, Deborah Kerr, John Huston and many others. And, each one contributes just the right amount of panache to their stereotypical characters. But Sellers, Niven, and Allen do most of the heavy lifting, with Sellers doing a superb job in his character, far, far better than his silly character in `Pussycat'.
I also am very fond of the inventiveness behind some of the silliness, although there is more than enough simple-minded silliness, especially in the final scene. The primary premise of five James Bond characters, flubbing their roles in the field, leading to the need to bring James Bond senior out of retirement to straighten things out creates lots of opportunities for a wide variety of situations and subplots.
While the new `Casino Royale' is a superb `classic' Bond flick, its release may have the secondary benefit of bringing this old warhorse spoof out of the closet to be enjoyed once more.",1203465600,2,2195,4.733681462140992
476058,2,6302470021,"Oh, the pain, the pain of the first 45 minutes and the last 25 of the 1967 epic spoof version of Casino Royale, which try too very hard to be wacky and with it and funny to be anything other than execrable. Two or three jokes sort of work, but probably only because you're desperate for something, anything to work - and then suddenly the Peter Sellers-Joanna Pettet sections kick in and suddenly the film seems almost good. It even starts to look like a real movie instead of an over-decorated Christmas tree, with a particularly stunning bit of slo-mo in the Look of Love scene, and some genuine wit in Q's scene, set in the basement of Harrods. It's a shame that Sellers walked off the picture, because the gaps are often all-too visible and horribly papered over. And then, after an hour of not bad, Sellers is gone and it suddenly goes straight back to overproduced Hell for a painful and redundant finale. Still, at least Burt Bacharach's score is a lot of fun and a joy to listen to: if only it graced a worthier film.

The US NTSC disc includes the 1954 live TV version of Casino Royale, with an uncomfortable Barry Nelson as Jimmy Bond of the CIA, Michael Pate a wildly unconvincing Leiter of British Intelligence, don't ya know, and a very good Peter Lorre as Le Chiffre. The plot is boiled down to a 50-minute running time but it's not without interest and while it may spare Bond the carpet beater it doesn't completely cop out on the torture scene. However, it's worth noting that a special edition DVD with a new documentary on the 1967 version will be released in the future.",1202860800,5,1590,4.482758620689655

476060,3,6302470021,"With the success of the 21st Bond movie - Casino Royale, starring Daniel Craig, a new, younger audience will come across this 1967 version, a parody of the James Bond movies.

On paper this Casino Royale should have been the best comedy ever made. With a line up with the likes of Peter Sellers, David Niven, Woody Allen, and Orson Welles, it is almost a crime that Casino Royale was such a critical disappointment.

Five directors and as many writers has done untold damage to the structure of the movie, with some parts so obviously dire and tired, whilst some parts funny and stylish. For example, the beginning, where David Niven is held up in a Scottish castle of beauties, is mainly slapstick stuff, whilst the Peter Seller's parts are quite witty and more script orientated. The stuff with Sellers and Woody Allen are great but it is lost in reels and reels of bloated directionless action.

You can tell that this movie is composed of three stories spliced together in a sort of desperate attempt of actually finishing something that most of the crew and cast probably regretted starting in the first place.

Some of the dream sequences seem to be `proper' scenes that have been edited out and placed back in. The film reminds me of the last Peter Seller's Pink Panther movie, where unfinished scenes and old scenes are spliced together to form sort of story. But it fails, and the actual story structure of Flemming's Casino Royale is lost in the broth of too many cooks.

Orson Welles, who plays the initial baddie, Le Chiffre, is always a enjoy to watch but it is sad to see him take these type of roles, especially in a mess like this, which is a shame as he would have made a proper Bond Villain, tormenting Sean Connery with wit and quips before enduring him to an elaborate death, which of course doesn't succeed.

David Niven plays David Niven of course, which is weird as he was originally one of the famous actors reportedly put forward to play the real Bond before unknown Sean Connery got the role. In this context, it seems Niven got the booby prize.

Peter Sellers is on fine form, but his role is lost here and there in between bloated long scenes that do not involve him, nor really pull the plot along. Woody Allen shows us his original slapstick and his more surreal humour, long before his more intellectual efforts in years to come. His Jimmy Bond is typical Allen, self-deprecating and self-loathing; not being able to fulfill the respect of his more famous uncle, Niven's James Bond.

The saving grace for the film actually belongs to Burt Bacharach; his score is typical sixties, fun and colourful.

All in all this film is not great, but serves as an odd nostalgia of many talents from both sides of the pond playing on screen together. Others include William Holden, Deborah Kerr and Daliah Lavi.

The film could have benefitted enormously from having just one director to keep the comedy in check and to create a better continuity balance. The film would have been great with a director like Mel Brookes, a great comedy film director and king of parody.

I would recommend this film to fans of Austin Powers rather than James Bond. The music, camp colours and sets, and the bevy of sixties girls, the giant UFO and the `evil' plot all precede the similar Mike Myer's creation 30 years later.",1198972800,4,3325,4.637755102040816

In some scenes the two share you can tell that she's trying her best to keep a straight face.

I was very curious about watching this movie.  I felt it was a waste of time.  It was funny, and the acting was good, but I did not like it.  Part of it was that it was too sexy for a fundamentalist like myself.  Another part is that the plot meandered too much.

Then, the movie becomes silly, stupid, pointless, and (what is the worst) not funny. Only Woody Allen, (as Bond's incompetent nephew, Jimmy Bond) brilliant as usual has appeared in two scenes and made them silly and hilarious.

Jokes fall dead left and right. Anyone counting this film as one of Peter Sellers' best have likely never seen ""The Party"", ""After the Fox"" or choice installments of the ""Pink Panther"" series. And before you say ""it's a comedy that was relative to the age in which it was made"", let me tell you that I'm a huge fan of zany 60's films. It's just a mess. The emperor has no clothes.

Lavish amounts of time, energy and (most foolish of all) money were poured into a project whose script seems to run out about 17 minutes in, leaving you a good 2 hours of meandering mush. The level of detail applied to that mush is astonishing: elaborate sets, exotic cars, high fashion and complex choreography. The line item for the writers must have been inadvertently dropped from the budget. Or maybe they just plain lost the script.... or edited it upside down.... or, or traded it in for whatever drugs were fashionable at the time. It's just a mess.

Trust me, if you make the mistake of watching this film in the belief that you'll see the prototype for the Austin Powers film series you're going to be very, very disappointed. Mike Meyers and Jay Roach may play to early 21st century comedy tastes but they built a solid comedy that will stand the test of time. They took the same reference material and did it right. At one point in Casino Royale the background music rings with an echo of the themesong from the Benny Hill show and you just wince because it isn't funny like Benny Hill, in fact it isn't funny at all.

I can't help but be angry at every big name star you see in the film for luring you into wasting your time. David Niven, Orson Welles, Ursula Andress, Peter Sellers, a very naked (but covered) Daliah Lavi, William Holden, Charles Boyer, John Huston, George Raft and a very unfunny Woody Allen are wasted.

I'm glad I read the other reviews about Sellers walking out and all the production problems--that explains alot about the plot problems and why Sellers character was killed off before the conclusion. Still a really fun film I enjoyed as much now as 25 years ago. After watching Peter Sellers performance I have no doubt Mike Myers thought the same. When Sellers(with his nerdy/hip looks and thick black glasses)took off his shirt and exposed his hairy back all I could think of was Austin Powers! + The scene in the first Austin Powers with Bacharach's ""The look of Love"" was lifted staight out of this movie.

Ursula Andress showed what a good sport she was by playing in this silly caper.  It is a great cast, which includes Woody Allen, Orson Welles, William Holden, Deborah Kerr and many others.  Feldman turned the movie into a spoof after a dispute with Broccoli, who refused to underwrite him.  He enlisted the directorial services of John Huston, who also plays M in this madcap adventure.

476128,2,6302470021,"This may be the first cinematic spoof that requires Cliffs Notes.  Deep down, buried somewhere inside of this incessant film, there is something like a plot, but I don't know that all of the pieces are ever brought together in anything resembling a satisfactory manner.  Characters come and go, are recruited with no apparent function, commit outrageous acts for unclear purposes.  This is less a coherent film than it is a series of skits, interspersed, and loosely connected by (exceptional) production design.  I recognize that plot was not the driving motivation of the filmmakers, but let us consider the modern day equivalent: Austin Powers.

Austin Powers covers the same ground and covers it better.  The plot is grossly simplified and stereotypical, thus serving the function of a spoof.  The scenes are never essential per se but do serve to the further what little plot there is.  Characters are recognizable by their Dickensian idiosyncrasies.  Casino Royale does not accomplish any of these characteristics.  In fact, I guarantee that any person who watches a genuine James Bond film at random will laugh harder and more often than someone watching Casino Royale.  What the filmmakers failed to realize was that, to a certain extent, the real James Bond already is a spoof.  His sex-crazed machismo is as far from realistic as can be; he is a caricature of cinema stereotypes.  It's impossible to spoof a spoof, and that is why Casino Royale is such a failure.

The only impression it can leave upon the viewer is one of excess: you feel literally glutted after watching it.  It is too long, there are too many characters, there are too many plot threads, there are too many sets, there are too many scenes, and then you get to the climatic fight(?) scene, then there are too many people--cowboys, Indians, the French, etc.  It's senseless, pointless, and stuffs the viewer to the point of dyspepsia.

Well, what plot there was was minimal.  Didn't any of these people (including the Amazon staff reviewer) watch the damned thing?  Was it supposed to make sense?  I loved it after David Niven left Scotland, but found it a bore during those 30 endless minutes.  It was refreshing.  I think Woody Allen wrote his own dialogue.  Orson Welles was his usual pompous stuffed shirted self, and I disliked him in the pit of my stomach as usual.  It was a very unusual role for Deborah Kerr!  I recommend it for one viewing and I sure as hell wish I'd rented this instead of buying it.  Now what am I going to do with it?  The worthless security tape of the packaging (getting it off that is) ruined the plastic on the case as usual (dolts), so I can't even throw away the DVD and save the case.  For $16 (including shipping) I would have expected more from the studio than just a DVD stuck in a box.  No pamphlet, no leaflet listing scenes and tracks and extras, nothing.  Sigh I was disappointed, but it was full of colors and action and explosions and talented people and twists and imagination.  It reminded me of Neil Simon's two spoofs on detective stories, one called ""Murder By Death.""  I forget the name of the other one.  I disliked them intensely.

Although this film is about the old secret agent ""Sir James Bond"" played by David Niven, it is ""unofficial"" because it was not made by EON Productions nor did it have Sean Connery. However, it was filmed in three different studios, Shepperton Studios, Pinewood Studios and MGM Studios.

 Sir Bond travels to M's estate to meet the widow, Fiona McTarry (Deborah Kerr). He becomes a guest.
  Back at the MI5, he meets ""Miss Moneypenny"" (Barbara Bouchet), well her daughter that is. He inquires about his nephew, Jimmy Bond, would was an agent there. Sir Bond decides to hire new agents and all the trainees will be known as ""James Bond 007"", Terence Cooper who is a sexually-powering James Bond must be trained to ignore sexual contact, Mr. Tremble (Peter Sellers) is also being trained and meets Vesper Lynd. Sir James Bond meets a woman (in this nice musical number) that is his secret daughter, Mata Bond (Joanna Pettet).
  Orson Welles is ""Le Chiffre"".  Geoffrey Bayldon is ""Q"".
  Also in the cast: William Holden, Woody Allen, Jacqueline Bisset, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Peter O'Toole, George Raft, Charles Boyer, Daliah Lavi. Angelica Huston was the hand model for Mimi's hand.

The history given in one review does lead you to believe some of this movie was playing ""catch-up"" and no it's not hilarious but definitely funny and as someone who has seen every commercially successful Bond including R.Moore, S.Connery , T. Dalton, P. Brosnan and G. Lazenby this is funny.  You can definitely see ""Austin Powers"" in it as well as a few other movies, but one must keep in mind this is british humor so you won't be slapping your knee or falling off the sofa.
Frankly,  I have more of an issue with Daniel Craig playing the early Bond instead of some younger Brit, but he was excellent in ""Layer Cake"" so I guess we'll give him a chance although not thrilled with Eva Green as Vespa Lynd, she's no Ursula Andress.",1146441600,,958,4.365168539325842

Aside from the fact that Bond's and Leiter's affiliations are switched, Bond in the CIA and Leiter in MI6, whereas is should be the other way around, the accuracy is amazing. Peter Lorre is perfect as Le Chiffre, and is exactly as the character is described in the book. The only downside of this version, as it is the only one available on DVD, is the fact that the original ending is missing. In the full version, only available on VHS, Le Chiffre takes the razor blade out of his hat and tries to kill Valerie and Bond shoots him. This full version also ends with the cliche Bond ending, him kissing Valerie.

476156,4,6302470021,"What a blast from the past - but I'll discuss that in a moment. First, remember the James Bond phenomenon back when Bond meant Sean Connery. It was all about adventure, masculine style, and suave coolness as people thought of it then. In other words, so seriously self-important that spoofing was only a matter of time. This certinaly isn't the only spy-spoof from the time, but ranks as one of the greats. With David Niven, Peter Sellers, Orson Welles, and Woody Allen, it ranges from the dry to drippy with satire. The story gets a bit loose and hectic towards the end, but that's hardly the point. It's just a big budget goof on a then-familiar franchise.

In addition, it's a time capsule in video form, of the psychedelic 60s. The women were all young and mini-dressed (when dressed), in a range of pastels normally seen only in Easter baskets. Special effects were opticals and photo negatives - trippy, but naive by today's standards - and Op Art was still a going concern.

In the generally straight-faced sendup, Woody Allen was the only off note, conspicuously trying to be funny instead of simply doing it. He played the only character he can in a relatively early form, fresh from the standup format and not yet aware that movies are different. The saved him for the end, though, and he did a fair job of creating the final surge of goofiness needed to bring this movie to its satisfying end.

It's such a disaster that the star, the emotionally-disturbed Peter Sellers, walked off the movie and they never stopped the production.  (Depending on which books you read, Sellers walked off either after his dead mother visited him in a dream to tell him to, or when Orson Welles mistook him for Woody Allen at an elevator and he ran off in a huff).

David Niven is then forced to carry on the chaos as it noisily crashes to its climax, the kind of madness that would be much better used in BLAZING SADDLES seven years later.

My old friend, the late Derek Nimmo (of BBC's Just a Minute) fame is in this movie too as a would be Bond under the tutelage of Sir James himself. If you see the current Austin Powers movies you'll see where the scipt writers got many of their ideas from. Beautiful and seductively voluptuous women abound as in all 007 movies.

476207,4,6302470021,"One of the great things about DVDs is that occasionally the extras are really worth it.  In this case one of the extras is the original production of Casino Royale as it appeared on Climax Television.
Once upon a time it was decided to do a spoof of the James Bond films.  A four-part script was created and four directors were hired.  Ian Fleming originally claimed that he envisioned David Niven in the role of James Bond.  That became a reality in this film.
James Bond is needed and must be called out of retirement.  The original, that is.  The film James Bond is merely a replacement for the original played by Niven.  He quit the spy business after the death of his true love; Mata Hari (1917).
To redirect attention, Peter Sellers is hired as a new James Bond.  He has a system for beating Baccarat and is needed to defeat badguy Orson Wells.  But as Wells goes down, we discover the sinister plot of young Jimmy Bond (Woody Alan).  Add Mata Hari's daughter and plenty of slapstick and the result is an amazing spoof.
The original 1954 version of Casino Royale was produced on Climax Television and had a few unusual twists.  Although this was the first Bond ""film"", it is out of character with the rest as Bond is an American (What!, you say).  Bond must go against badguy Peter Lorre (who gets a place in history as the first to play a Bond villain).  The story is very close to the original novel except SMERSH has been replaced by the Syndicate.
A great disk with some great footage.  I especially recommend the original production that was included.",1052784000,5,1562,4.512455516014235
476208,4,6302470021,"Eon Production's DR. NO was a great hit in the early 1960s, and Eon quickly snapped up the rights to the rest of Ian Flemming's novels about super spy James Bond--except for the CASINO ROYALE, which had already been purchased earlier by CBS for a 1950s television adaptation.  When the property wound up at Columbia Pictures, they decided to create the satire to end all satires with a host of writers, five famous directors, and an all-star cast led by Peter Sellers.  But Sellers' ego reached critical mass during the production and he was fired mid-way into filming--and suddenly roles that were originally envisioned as cameos had to be expanded to finish the project.  The result is one of the most bizarre films imaginable.  The story, such as it is, finds James Bond (David Niven) called out of retirement to deal with the sudden disappearance of secret agents all over the world.  In order to confuse the unknown enemy, Sir James orders ALL secret agents to use the name James Bond--and before you can blink there are Bonds aplenty running wild all over the globe. Eventually all the Bonds, including (through the magic of editing) Peter Sellers, wind up at Casino Royale, where they confront the evil agents of SMERSH and a diabolical mad man with a plot to rule the world.
The plot is absolute chaos, but that doesn't prevent the film from being a lot of fun to watch. The entire cast runs wild with some marvelous over-the-top performances, and whenever the writers can jam in a gag or a weird plot turn they do precisely that: Bond (Niven) is attacked by decoy ducks; counter-agent Mimi (Deborah Kerr) swings from a drain pipe; Bond's daughter by Mata Hari (Joanna Pettet) is kidnapped by a UFO; double agent Vesper (Ursula Andress) hides bodies in the deep freeze.  And that's just for starters.
At one point Niven blows up the locked door of a psychedelically decorated dudgeon with lysergic acid--better know as LSD--and in a way this is indicative of the entire film, which was made at the height of the 1960s ultra-mod movement: the whole thing has the feel of a blow-out acid trip, right down to flashing multicolored lights and swinging 60s fashions.  It is visually arresting, to say the least.  And then there is that famous Burt Bacharach score, easily one of the best of the decade, sporting Herp Albert on the main theme and Dusty Springfield's legendary performance of ""The Look of Love.""  On the whole, the film is one of the most entertaining hodgepodges of talent and weirdness I've ever encountered, and it never fails to amuse.  As for the DVD itself, the print is good and the sound is too.  The extras are a bit disappointing, however.  The original CBS version, included here, is a bore, and the making-of documentary is essentially a prolonged interview with one the film's several directors.  I've found that viewers tend to have extremely different reactions to this film--they either love it or hate it, so you may want to rent this one first.  But it's one of my favorite guilty pleasures, and I recommend it for fans of the unexpectedly odd.",1049500800,91,3080,4.75422138836773

As an adult, the humor is so witty.  Really a gem.  I cannot recommend Casino Royale enough.  The acting is on the mark - especially David Niven.  I have laughed and laughed, time after time at his comedic timing. And Deborah Kerr's performance is oh, so funny and wonderfully inspiring.  I fell in love with her wit and spunk.  Too funny!
As for the music - my, what can I say?  I bought the CD long ago and have loved the Burt Bacharach soundtrack.  Especially, ""The Look of Love"" by Dusty Springfield.  You won't find a finer rendering that evokes such wonderful emotion.

Quite a complicated film to make with 5 directors, endless producers and screenwriters, and an endless cast in the movie with dozens of cameos. Lee Pfeiffer once commented on the film that ""If you were in London at the time of the movie production, you had a part in the movie."" Indeed Casino Royale is an over-budget big flop of the James Bond series, it stands up very well for itself. David Niven, Ursula Andress, Orson Wells and Woody Allen bring undeniable charm, class and comedy to the film. There is basically no plot for the film, but the comedy and spoofs make up for it. The gambling scenes and over the top finale are some of the highlights of the film. The true winner is the powerful score by Burt Bacharach. A real winner with Dusty Springfield and Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass. A crazy film with nonstop thrills, comedy and excitement! A real winner.",1043107200,5,991,4.480662983425415
476212,4,6302470021,"The ""Austin Powers"" series sure could take a few hints from ""Casino Royale"".  Whereas the former is predictable and obvious, ""Casino Royale"" is a good example of that famous dry British wit.
What else could you call it when wealthy Ursula Andress tells Peter Sellers that she gets her newspapers BEFORE they're printed, and he replies, ""Well, I suppose you can do anything if you've got money...""  Or when Joanna Pettet comments on her estranged mother's oversized bed and is told, ""The German army was very large in those days.""
I've withheld one star because the movie does tend to have an episodic feel, due to the five different directors who worked on it, and because it drags a bit in places.  Still, the witty jokes more than make up for those small flaws.  Considering how many hands this movie was in, it's amazing that it works so well.  Woody Allen gives his funniest performance as neurotic Jimmy Bond.  Peter Sellers is terrific, as usual.  And watch out for an appearance by a young Jacqueline Bisset as Miss Goodthighs.
The movie's crowning touch is the music by Burt Bacharach, which manages to be catchy and loopy at the same time.
Finally, one of the best reasons for owning rather than renting this movie is that some of the gags go by so fast (Q's laboratory, the art auction), that you might not catch them all until your second or third viewing.  And, like a lot of good humor, some of the jokes just get funnier with repeat viewings.",1041465600,4,1456,4.616279069767442

After seeing that it was released on DVD, I had to get it, for nostalgia's sake.  I found that I still very much enjoyed the film, but there are so many other things that I picked up watching it later.  I am sure that it is obvious from the cover that the movie has a strong sixties drug overtone.  Spinning lights and shapes are pleading to be watched under the influence.  You know that there is a drug undercurrent when there are in a room filling with gas, and they use it to blow the door open, and that gas is Lysergic Acid...  not so flammable, but is the main ingredient in LSD.  I also noticed the absurdity of so many scenes.  As a child I accepted a lot of it, but watching it now and seeing dazzling sparkles and colored lights behind Orson Welles as he does stage magic at the baccarat table, or the British government blowing up the estate of James Bond to get him to go on another mission...  it was nonsense.

It's hard for me to watch this film without falling asleep. So much of it fails to generate anything that could possibly be entertaining. There are occasional funny parts and a couple of entertaining moments, but the movie feels like an over-budgeted flop. David Niven makes a lousy 007 who is mostly bumbling and completely unbelievable. Ian Fleming is turning in his grave... but he does flips with ""A View to a Kill,"" which is worse than this one.",1039996800,4,625,4.63963963963964
476225,3,6302470021,"The psychedelic technicolor on this DVD was worth waiting for. It's worth keeping for the pictures alone, but then there's the fabulous music (including the immortal Audiophile wet dream ""Look of Love"" sung by Dusty Springfield playing while Ursula Andress seduces Peter Sellers, and also the equally immortal Tijuana Brass and Burt Bacharach), and the incredible star actors who do a fine job under the circumstances, especially Niven, Sellers, Allen, and Andress. There isn't much of a plot, almost zero continuity, loose ends galore, and total chaos in parts, but in the end the goodness of the parts makes the whole worthwhile. It's a miracle, maybe, but it works. Oh, and I need to mention the sexy girls, the macho guys, the incredible costumes, the gags, the props, ad infinitum. Apparently part of it was filmed below the Playboy club in London from which they got lots of extras.
While worth keeping, this is obviously not a ""great"" movie in any sense, so I'm surprised at all the 5 star ratings. Fortunately they tend to balance off the unfair 1 star ratings. I enjoyed this more than both ""Austin Powers International Man of Mystery"" (which kept me wincing) and ""Our Man Flint"" (which seemed rather short, hollow, and cheap...low budget obviously...). I'd actually give Casino Royale 3.5 stars if I could. It's easily better than the other spoofs, and ALMOST a great movie in its own right. When you understand what the producer was doing, and how the film was made, that's a miracle.
If you want to see the ""real"" Casino Royale plot, the TV version from the 1950's is included, unfortunately cut a few minutes short I've read here.
The documentary by the director who ultimately got the unenviable job of glueing this all together (Val Guest) was instructive. It's a miracle this movie was ever finished. The producer (an ex-agent) simply hired a number of top directors and ordered them each to do their thing. There was no ""book"" (the actual book was to be ignored since almost all the material in it had previously been used in ""serious"" Bond films). To make it worse, Orson Wells refused to do any significant amount of acting with Peter Sellers (who he considered an ""Amateur""), so their scenes had to be spliced together. Though Val doesn't explain this, that might have led to Seller's sick-out, when then led to having Sellers fired, so they had to figure out how to complete the movie without Sellers. That's really a pity, because Sellers is actually an outstanding actor and does outstanding work here (much better than Wells, in fact). He's only topped by Niven. (And despite what Wells seemed to think of himself, I consider even Casino Royale better than any of his ""serious"" movies...Orson Wells is the most overrated actor and director in history IMHO, but he does a adequate job here as a bit part actor.)",1038528000,6,2834,4.82135523613963

The film did have a certain discontinuity, but with four separate directors attempting to blend their individual talents, this is to be expected.  As a Bond spoof, some may compare the film to the modern day Austin Powers movies, but the Mike Meyers creations don't hold a candle to this 1960's classic.",1036281600,,653,4.954128440366972

I've read all these reviews of the ""great"" sound track with no mention of Herp Alpert & the Tijuana Brass' main title.  A real classic (can be found on their hits album) that's still popular today, long after Dusty Springfield's popularity has faded to, well, dust.
Woody Allen, whom I really, really hate, was actually funny in this movie - something that has eluded him the past three decades.  It's campy 60's at its best!  The show down between Bond/Niven and the Highlanders, the killer homing pigeon, and kamikaze car are only a few of the ""moments"" this film has to offer.

The extra material provided with the DVD, an interview with director Val Guest, explains why this is (I won't spoil it for you).  Keeping these behind-the-scenes facts in mind, makes the movie even more entertaining.
I probably laughed more as I child when I watched this movie, but I certainly get more of the jokes as an adult.

In fact, it would be a mistake to compare this film to anything.  Approached on its own merits, CASINO ROYALE is an oddball maze of plots, characters, pop-art images, and over-the-top gags that brims with a great sense of life and giddy humor.  Does everything make sense?  No.  Is it something of a jumble?  Yes.  Are all of the gags funny?  I don't think so.  But do any of those things get in the way of this being a thoroughly entertaining romp for anyone with half a sense of humor?  Not at all.  CASINO ROYALE is one of my all-time favorite pick-me-up movies when I'm stuck with the flu at home, and it's a great pleasure to share with friends, especially if you have a soft spot for Sixties culture.  It is silliness for the sake of silliness, designed purely to delight and distract, and, to paraphrase William Saroyan, I can think of few things more noble.
I've been looking forward to the DVD release for some time, and have been a little dismayed at the scant information about it from various sites.  Now that I have it, I can say that MGM has treated the film well.  Is it a red-carpet treatment like the Eon Bonds have gotten?  No.  But it is a far better DVD package than we were given with NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN.  The image and color quality have a vibrance fitting a film of the era (and I mean that in a good way), and the sound -- including one of cinema's most distinctive scores, written by Burt Bacharach -- is presented in a newly digitally enhanced 5.1.
The extras are what interested me, and (especially for the price) the disc provides some goodies.  One is the original TV version of CASINO ROYALE, shot with Barry Nelson as an Americanized ""Jimmy Bond.""  The other is a NEW making-of featurette with Val Guest discussing the film.  Guest was one of the five directors (!) on the movie, and was charged with trying to tie it all together.  He has some really great behind-the-scenes info, mostly told under footage from the movie.  The featurette is not the best I've seen, but it's hardly the worst, and sheds great light on how this distinctive and idiosyncratic one-of-a-kind picture was made.  I wish they had asked Guest to do a commentary, but I'm not griping.  Considering how little has been written on the making of this genuinely twisted film, the featurette alone is more than welcomed.  There is an original trailer included, and the film is presented letterboxed.
For the price, CASINO ROYALE can't be beat.  Its influence on the POWERS series will be obvious to even the most casual viewer, right down to the music.",1034640000,,2732,4.533742331288344

476263,3,6302470021,"With its tongue firmly planted in cheek, Casino Royale takes viewers on a wild ride through the spy business. David Niven plays the retired James Bond (who despises what his successor with the same name has been doing on behalf of the UK). The plot is little more than an excuse to cobble together 5 different segements (with 5 different directors including John Huston who appears in a cameo).
The funnest segment involves Peter Sellers as James Bond. He projects confidence so well in his witty performance that you'd almost expect him to play the role in a Real Bond Film. His scenes with Orson Welles very from mildly entertaining to rip roaring funny. Welles was reportedly irritated with Sellers during the making of the film so most of his material was shot with Seller's around (Seller's made fun of Welles girth and continually bated him during the production).
Although it hasn't aged as gracefully as some the Flint films (which still work very well as satire), Casion Royale still works well enough to enjoy. In many respects, it's a predecessor to the Austin Powers movies and plays like that film crossed with It's A Mad, Mad, Mad World.
Although Casino Royale is a lot of lightweight fun, it's not as good a spoof as its producers seem to think. James Coburn was actually funnier in the two Our Man Flint spy spoofs. Casino Royale is a notch below Flint and above the Dean Martin Matt Helm films.
A pity there was no way include a cameo of Sean Connery (the film's producers were not the producers of the Bond series. Casino Royale was the only Fleming book that they owned. That's one of the reasons they elected to go in a satirical direction with the film as anything else would have resulted in lawsuits). It's also a pity that the various directors are no longer around  to include a commentary track. Most of the principles are dead so it's no surprise that there's no commentary track from them as well.
Casino Royale is an enjoyable romp as long as you check your expectations at the door. While time hasn't been as kind to it as it has been to some of the Bond & Flint films, it was clearly ahead of its time.",1034208000,19,2133,4.5546875

It has a wonderful cast headed by David Niven and Peter Sellers along with the good and the great of British comedy from the period. Ursula Andress is the female lead and unlike her apearance in ""Dr. No"", we at least get to hear her real voice; her exotic cosumes were designed by Julie Harris who went on to perform a similar service in ""Live and Let Die"".
The photography is surperb and the digital remastering makes it truly a feast for the eyes. The production design is at least comparable with the EON series.
My favorite aspect of the film is Bert Bacharach's score; almost every scene has its own tune and each one is a delight.  ""The Look Of Love"" has to be one of the most sensual songs ever writen for a film and it has the images to match! Bacharach and David worked hard to capture the movement of Ursula Andress and they more than succeded.
The only thing that lets the movie down is that it is episodic feel to the whole film (probably because of the numerous directors) and the fact that it is about twenty minutes too long. It is hard to sustain tounge in cheek humour for over two and a half houres.

Finally this comedic take on the James Bond series makes its way onto DVD, and for completists and fans of James Bond this 2002 DVD promises not only the 1967 version of Ian Flemings first 007 novel but also an edited down version of the very first James Bond movie, the 1950s CBS TV movie that starred Barry Nelson as James Bond (thats right, Sean Connery was NOT the first actor to portray 007). Made for an American audience, the character of James Bond is a CIA agent in that show and Leiter is the British intelligence agent. That movie, which is listed as a special feature on this DVD, also starred Peter Lorre as the villain Le Chiffre. Made in the days of live television this entertaining oddity is worth watching for the bloopers alone.
Years later, the rights to ""Casino Royale"" made it into the hands of another movie producer who, convinced that any attempt to make a serious version of ""Casino Royale"" would be doomed without the talents of Sean Connery, decided to make the remake as a comedy instead. With Peter Sellers playing James Bond and Orson Welles taking on the role of Le Chiffre everything seemed to be going fine until a script dispute caused Sellers to walk out on the project. Left with half a movie the producers were in trouble and they scrambled to save their production. One needs to understand this background to the movie to understand why it turned out the way it did. In it's final version it seems truly confused with several actors portraying the role of James Bond and several directors (including John Huston who also cameos as M) taking a crack at it. There is even an early appearance by Woody Allen and former Bond girl Ursula Andress. For me personally, the Peter Sellers scenes are especially brilliant and very funny and David Niven plays the perfect gentleman spy. The action comes thick and fast and in addition to Andress there are a number of actors familiar to devotees to the rival EON productions. This movie is truly",1027036800,212,2397,4.803874092009686

476303,5,6302470021,"purrs Miss Goodthighs, played by Jacky (yeah, it's her)Bisset as she tries to drug inept aspiring spy Evelyn Tremble (aka James Bond) Peter Sellers in this wacky spy spoof from the 1960s.
You know, I TRIED to watch ""Austin Powers"", but in no way is it as good as ""Casino Royale"" can be in some places. I have to say, ""some places"", because much though I love this movie, I know it drags here and there or gets a bit too corny, but even that can't make me mark it lower than 5 stars.
Basically, it's a who's who of Hollywood in the 1960s, all jammed into the mystery of who is killing off all of M's secret agents, and why? Thus John Houston (M) must journey along with Charles Boyer, William Holden, and Kurt Kaznar to visit ""the original James Bond"" David Niven, now in retirement playing Debussy and tending a black rose. He literally has to be blasted out of his complacence, bringing the remains of M--his toupee--to the ancestral home in Scotland. Ah, but the evil agents of SMERCH have already infiltrated the castle and replaced whoever with Deborah Kerr and a bevy of French-speaking Scottish babes, all out to be-smirch Bond's clean image of himself, i.e., sleep with him! But he proves too much even for their nefarious scheme. In fact, Sir James is too much for just about anyone trying to overpower him, which is part of the great joke. Joining along at various junctures are Joanna Petit, Orson Welles, Ursula Andress, Woody Allen, and the aforementioned Peter Sellers. And the venues! An East German school for spies shot in abstract expressionist style, a Mata Hari dance knockoff in India, a circular revolving bed supporting Ursula Andress and Peter Sellers' romp, a baccharat table complete with Orson Welles doing cheap magic tricks, and the groovy spy chambers below Casino Royale itself (check out that fingerprinted rotating room). It's not supposed to make sense, really, and that's okay with me. And that score by Burt Bacharach, with ""The Look of Love"" and Herb Alpert trumpetting away is a real winner. One question we've never been able to answer at home: Who on earth is singing the title song? A masterpiece of adenoidal camp, here remembered in fragments: ""Hey look at Double 0 7, he's got a redhead in his arms.... Look who's here JAAAMES BOOOND! We've got him on the run, with guns and knives, We're fighting for our lives, at Casino Royale.... Have no fear, Bond is here, He's going to save the world, at Casino Royale. "" Yep, pure poetry. Who can really explain a joke and do it justice? You're just going to have to trust me on this one. ""Casino Royale"" wins hands down.",1015459200,11,2605,4.640692640692641

The highlight of the film is the opening score featuring the horn of the late Al Hirt. That's not to say that the film doesn't have it's moments. Various conventions and mores of the time are parodied, some rather hysterically, and Woody ""sleeper"" Allen and Orson ""Citizen Kane"" Welles are quite good in their roles.

The soundtrack is awesome and it was a favorite tune of mine way back when I was five. I still play it to this day. The movie is funny,hysterical, and just plain enjoyable. Mike Myerson got the idea of Austin Powers from Peter Sellers' Evelyn Tremble character. The goofy glasses and that awful chest hair. When Sellers is in the shower, you can see his awful physique and chest hair. Sellers is a comic genius although not the best looking leading man. David Niven is always a class act with his wonderful wardrobe and accent. The movie is not clear in the beginning with M's death. He is killed by SMERSH, but he gives a signal with his cigar to blow up James Bond's house. Is he with SMERSH or just trying to get Jams Bond out of retirement? That is the only thing I can't figure out after 30 years..... Enjoy the psychodelic 60's.",986688000,3,1122,4.42512077294686

HOWEVER, it is now a wonderful example of a period of time when movie makers often had a lot a money to spend on films, but didn't have much to say. That's OK, as we would get pretty tired of every film being anotherheavy handed masterpiece.
Similar to a film of the same year (or very close), ""Candy,"" it had a huge number of stars who were in it for laughs and (of course) the money. Probably a few parties at night as well.
It does manage to capture a certain sillyness of the time that some later movies try to recreate, but fail.  (The best recreation was in the opening scene of the first Austin Powers movie.)

476309,1,6302470021,"This movie is just too much! And that's not necessarily a good thing in the case of this film. Sir James Bond (played by David Niven) is brought out of retirement to battle the forces of SMERSH after the death of ""M"". Only now, all secret agents have the ""007"" mantle in an effort to confuse the enemy. Unfortunately, its the viewer of this film that ends up confused. This film suffers from having too many directors, too many screenwriters, and too many star actors. The story itself seems like a series of plot turns that have been smashed together to fill the runtime of the movie. However, it isn't completely horrible. There are some clever sequences that can be found amongst the chaos of this film. Peter Sellers is great in the role of Evylen Tremble, and Woody Allen really stands out as Sir James Bond's nephew and villain, Little Jimmy Bond. His plot for worldwide domination is absolutely fantastic! The visuals in this film are also very appealing (great Mod attire on all the female agents!). If you're looking for some mindless silly entertainment, then grab this film. But if you're looking for a plot, just walk away",969926400,6,1134,4.675
476310,5,6302470021,"Shgadellic, if I may say.  You can definately see the Austin Powers influence in this movie.  It starts as an aging James Bond is coaxed out of retirement after M is killed to smash a spy ring known as SMERSH.  He  travels to Scotland to give M's remains (his toupee) to his widow and  several daughters (all between 16 and 19).  All of these women are double  agents for SMERSH and are trying to smash Bond's celebet (yes, you read  right) image, they failed.  Bond continues on to London where he takes over  his spy agency.  Moneypenny's daughter is there (same name) and they get an  AFSD (Anti Female Spy Device) to help them.  This is to me two of the most  funny scenes of the 60's when Moneypenny 'goes for broke' picking out AFSD  hopefuls and then when they're training this AFSD.  All the spies are known  as James Bond 007 including the girls.  Another spy they recrute is Urusla  Andress as Vesper Lynd she's assigned to get a professsional gamber, Evylen  Tremble (played perfectly by Peter Sellers) to play a card game with the  notorious villian Le Chiffre (Orson Welles) After recruiting Bond's  daughter with Mata Hari, Mata Bond and a few others, they set out to  destroy SMERSH.  Toward the end Bond and Moneypenny are kidnapped by SMERSH  and it turns out the leader is Bond's nephew (Woody Allen) His diabolical  plan: to make all women beautiful and all men shorter than 4' 7"", as  Bond put it, ""A world full of beautiful women and all the men shorter  than you.""  Tremble (now 007) is captured and tortured by Le Chiffre.  During this mind torture there's a bunch on kilted Scotsman playing  bagpipes.  One of them stops Tremble and asks him, ""Are you Richard  Burton?""  Tremble replies, ""No, I'm Peter O'Toole.""  The  Scotsman returns, ""Then you're the finest human being that ever  lived.""  I would bet my life that that Scotman that asked Peter  Sellers if he's Richard Burton IS Peter O'Toole.  There's a big fight at  Casino Royale, and after Woody (he plays Jimmy Bond) swallows a thing that  ""looks like an aspirin, tastes like an aspirin, but it's not an  aspirin"" and is designed to blow someone up he ends up blowing up the  entire Casino killing James Bond (the original) Vesper, Mata Bond, Vesper  Lynd, Moneypenny, Cooper (the AFSD), and Evylen Tremble.  They go to heaven  while Woody Allen goes to a ""place very very hot.""
Casino  Royale is great fun.  It's my favorite spy spoof (2 kinds of 60's spy  flicks, spoofs like this and serious ones like Goldfinger and The Spy Who  Came in from the Cold).  It wasn't based too closely on the book because  after 5 Bond movies, everything from the book had already been used, except  the card game between Tremble and Le Chiffre.  So the producer Charles K.  Feldman decided to spoof the whole thing.  The end result is a hilarious,  weird at times, entertaining, hypnotic, and worthy of the Bond list.  It's  not on there, I don't think.  Here is a movie that is far above many of the  films made in the 60's or made ever.  It possesses so much more than meets  the eye, but special effects too (Sellers was angry with Welles after  Princess Margaret said hi to Welles before him so he refused to do any  scenes with him, the card game and everything else is the result of mirrors  and doubles) It's like the most beautiful ruby in the world, but only a few  people have the sight to see it.",955670400,4,3375,4.522537562604341

The original intent was to produce a serious screen adaptation of Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel; however, talks broke down between ""Casino Royale"" producer Charles Feldman and producer Albert Broccoli (who had already produced 4 incredibly successful James Bond movies starring Sean Connery). Broccoli didn't want Feldman's vision for ""Casino Royale"" even associated with the already-lucrative film series.

So, almost in defiance of Broccoli, Feldman produced ""Casino Royale"" as a spoof, an off-the-wall mockery of James Bond movies, instead.  Thus, 1967's ""Casino Royale"" was born.

There's no real way to describe this film except to say ""madcap"" and ""slapstick""...the twisting, winding plot and the parade of celebrities throughout the film make any succinct description pretty much impossible.  There are gigantic plotholes and continuity errors, making it appear that the various scenes were shot by several different directors.  In fact, that is the case...6 different directors worked this film.

While comic Peter Sellers gives a rather low-key performance, the funniest scenes definitely go to comedy veteran David Niven, who is both debonaire and absurd.  Longtime dramatic actress Deborah Kerr also lets down her hair and plays balls-out comedy like it was her first love.  These scenes are nothing less than a delight.

Again, Peter Sellers earns his pay in different roles, but he's not slam-dunking the comedy (there are no ""Inspector Clouseau"" moments for Sellers in this film, unfortunately).

The lineup of famous (and not-yet-famous) actors in ""Casino Royale"" is formidable and too lengthy for a brief review, except to note Ursula Andress, Orson Welles, William Holden, Charles Boyer, John Huston, Anjelica Huston, Peter O'Toole, George Raft, Woody Allen, David Prowse (yes, Darth Vader) and many others.

Warning you in advance, you WILL get lost in this movie because the story is disorganized and, let's just say it, crazy as hell.

But there's a reason why this film was nominated for an Academy Award, and that reason was the soundtrack, which introduced the wildly popular song ""The Look of Love"" by Burt Bacharach and Hal David.  Although it failed to win the 1968 Oscar for Best Song, it was covered by dozens of established recording artists for many years thereafter (and was even inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008).

Between ""The Look of Love"" and Herb Alpert's brassy ""Casino Royale"" theme music, the soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission.",1525219200,,2710,5.26046511627907
