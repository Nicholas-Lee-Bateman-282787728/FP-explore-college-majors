2648368,5,B000HWZ4RA,"I loved loved LOVED Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers as a kid, so I was really excited to get this DVD for my kiddos.  They're ages 3 and 5 so I wasn't sure how it would be received (cartoons are so much different in 2016!)  To my complete delight, they are in love with Chip and Dale.  We really only watch DVDs on long car trips, so this was a huge treat on our last family vacation.  They liked it so much they requested it over some of their favorite movies.

I've included a photo of the episode list.  The episodes are:

Disc 1
(pilot) Rescue Rangers to the Rescue episodes 1-5
A Creep in the Deep
Normie's Science Project
Seer No Evil

Disc 2
Chipwrecked Shipmunks
When Mice Were Men
Chocolate Chips
The Last Leprechaun
Whether or Not
One-Upsman-Chip
Shell Shocked
Love is a Many Splintered Thing

Disc 3
Song of the Night'N'Dale
Double 'O' Chipmunks
Gadget Goes Hawaiian
It's a Bird, It's Insane, It's Dale!
Short Order Crooks
Mind Your Cheese and Qs
Out of Scale
Dirty Rotten Diapers

The disc arrived quickly after I ordered it and was well packaged.

This set has 3 DVDs, each with 9 episodes.  The first disc includes the 5-episode Pilot (really more of a movie).  The rest are all normal 22 minute episodes of the show.  I had forgotten how cute these are...I'm falling in love with them all over again!

I highly recommend this if you were a fan of the show, or if you're looking for a cartoon for your kiddos to enjoy.  Mine have lots of giggles in the car!",1468108800,3,1467,4.338235294117647

Purchased this for our 7 yr old grandson because he got started watching Rescue Rangers on old VCR tapes that belonged to our boys (our youngest  son is his dad) when they were little. Needless to say, the DVD is much better quality than the old VCR tapes especially since they had been watched a million times before he got to watch them! Wish they just had them by season instead of breaking up the seasons into volumes.

2648449,4,B000HWZ4RA,"So, growing up watching this show at some point obviously made me push it onto my kids.  Luckily they like the show!  There is one gigantic complaint that I have with this one and that is the fact that I really think that most of these episodes should have been put on volume one.  It was actually my 4 year old that mentioned it and made me aware of the fact that they are pretty much introducing the characters in the first episodes.  He literally told me that the episodes should have come first.  For a 4 year old to recognize that then it must be pretty obvious that it's out of order!  That DID cause the kids to skip watching it the first time I got it out, but the next time I just put it in and didn't say what it was and they watched it without complaining.

Overall, it's just as great as when I watched it years ago but a little disappointing that the order is messed up.  I am glad we ended up getting those episodes, though, instead of them leaving them out completely!",1427932800,4,983,4.164021164021164

2648529,5,B000HWZ4RA,"The second volume of my other favorite Disney Afternoon series.  Although I bought this off of Amazon, keep in mind that I've owned a copy of this set since the day it came out in 2006, along with Gummi Bears Volume 1.  I just ordered it as a birthday present for a cousin of mine, since he went crazy when I showed him my Chip N' Dale DVDs & he wanted to see the origin story.

Again, I'm borrowing synopsizes for the episodes from somebody else (E. Burgess, this time.  Curse you, new Wikipedia!) & added a little commentary on each one.

28-32.  To The Rescue: The origin story for the Rescue Rangers.  This tells how Chip & Dale met Monterey Jack, Gadget & Zipper, as well as their first encounters with Fat Cat & Professor Nimnul.  Aside from Gargoyles' ""Awakening"", this is my favorite of the Disney pilots.  A+

33.  A Creep In the Deep: A deranged fish vows declares war on the human race and vows to free captive fish everywhere.  A great villain & a great script make this is a high point of the series.  A+

34.  Normie's Science Project:  Normie uses his Uncle Nimnul's record player which uses sound to disintegrate objects as a science project.  A pretty funny episode.  B+

35.  Seer No Evil - Chip gets a morbid prediction from a psychic at a carnival.  This is the best of the few episodes that focus on Chip.  A+

36.  Chipwrecked Shipmunks - The Rangers are wrecked on a tropical island and meet once again with the Pi-Rats, who are looking for a treasure that Monterey and Dale have already found.  A good episode, even if the moral is a bit heavy-handed.  B

37.  When Mice Were Men - The Rangers to go Mexico when Monterey gets a call for help from old friends of his; they are under attack by a giant bull with a personal vendetta against Monterey.  The worst episode on the volume, & possibly the whole series.  It just feels too derivative of Looney Tunes with the Mexican mice (Speedy Gonzales) & the bull fight (Bully for Bugs).  I have to admit, that bullfighting robot is pretty cool though.  D+

38.  Chocolate Chips:  The Rangers vacation in South America where a German man is using zombies to dig up the cacao trees and make chocolate.  All of the Rangers except Dale are turned into zombies themselves, and he must save the day and the other Rangers.  An excellent episode, with a great villain & script.  A+

39.  The Last Leprechaun: The Rangers go to Ireland where they meet the last leprechaun who is being hunted by a Banshee who wants his magical pot of gold.  I remembered this episode vividly, thinking that this was much better than the Ducktales episode where they met leprechauns.  And what do you know, I'm still thinking that.  A

40.  Weather Or Not:  The other Rangers think Monterey is crazy when his weather-indicating tail keeps predicting snow; however, Monterey's tail is out of whack because Nimnul has created a weather machine and is using it rob banks and jewelry shops.  Apart from a couple logic breaks here & there, this was an excellent episode.  A

41.  One Upsman-Chip:  Chip and Dale compete to see who can outwit the other last when Chip gets too competitive and Dale ends up in Fat Cat's clutches.  An excellent episode focusing the relationship between Chip & Dale.  A+

42.  Shell Shocked:  The Rangers vacation at a beach from which all the shells are conspicuously missing; Fat Cat is using them to simulate the sound of the ocean and attract fish.  Another great episode.  A

43.  Love Is A Many Splintered Thing - Monterey Jack's old flame Desiree returns, but is still using Monty and working for a bad weasel crime boss.  Monterey Jack's best episode.  A+

44.  Song of the Night'n'Dale - The Rangers end up in China where they find an Emperor whose sister is going to elaborate methods to convince him that he is crazy.  A good episode, even if the end was ripped off of Looney Tunes.  B

45.  Double 'O' Chipmunks - After hurting Dale's feelings, the other Rangers indulge him in his James Bond fantasies and dupe him into thinking that he is solving a case in which he must deliver microfilm. While the Rangers originally gave Dale a regular undeveloped roll of vacation photos, it gets swapped for real microfilm that is being hunted by rat thugs for their evil scientist boss.  This is another excellent Dale episode (he's my favorite character).  A+

46.  Gadget Goes Hawaiian - While the Rangers vacation in Hawaii, Gadget meets Louwhiney, who looks just like her. Louwhiney tricks Gadget into running survival tests for her, and Gadget learns that she has to choose one plan and stick with it.  A near perfect spotlight episode for Gadget.  A

47.  It's A Bird, It's Insane, It's Dale! - Dale finds a piece of Meteor that gives him superpowers but the other half is found by a criminal who steals world monuments and frames Dale.  I thought this was a unique episode.  A

48.  Short Order Crooks - Two thugs try to rob a bank through the diner next door, but the Rangers, mistaking them for average Joes, try to help them by making Monterey's famous cheese chowder.  Pretty entertaining.  B+

49.  Mind Your Cheese and Qs - Monterey's cheese craving finally catch up with him and he must overcome them in order to save his friends from Rat Capone, who is hoarding all the cheese in town.  The first & best appearance of Rat Capone.  A

50.  Out of Scale - Chip and Dale are captured by infamous crime boss Ratso Ratskywatsky who gives them as pets to his spoiled daughter Buffy.  Buffy was kind of annoying, but this was still a fine episode overall.  B

51. Dirty Rotten Diapers - The Rangers try to bust a criminal who looks like a baby and has set up a series of robberies through a fake adoption agency.  A good episode with some funny moments, but not as great as some people make it out to be.  B

Another good collection all in all.  I'm not sure whether this or Volume 1 is my favorite.  If only this had been 27 episodes long like the 2nd volumes of Talespin & Darkwing Duck, then Good Times Bat Times, my all-time favorite episode, would have been on DVD & I'd know for sure which one is my favorite.

2648593,4,B000HWZ4RA,"I'll review three things here: the show, the DVD content, and the packaging:

The Show - While not exactly brand new, CDRR is a very good series. As opposed to cartoons today, it didn't feel the need to be explicitly educational. It also doesn't have 1.4 kadrillion product tie-ins to tempt the kids. And, once you get over the improbable stuff, it's fun for an adult (or at least me) to watch. The 5 rescue rangers have their distinct personalities that work very well together and the gags are funny even when you see them coming. Think of a less spooky ""Scooby-Doo"" where the crime solvers have real personalities and a little MacGyver thrown in. One more mark in its favor is that it deals with some serious themes at times, such as loyalty and integrity.

The DVD content - They have the ""second"" 24 episodes and...that's it.  Seriously, there's no other content on there except a few Disney previews and some menus based on the show.  The audio/video is certainly good enough for the kids to watch.  The episodes include the original movie-length pilot broken into 5 episodes.

The packaging - Again, no frills here.  I like that they are thin cases and are fairly clearly labeled.  The front cover art is nice.  There are scenes on the backs of the cases that are screen shots from the episodes inside.

Overall - The show by itself is good enough to recommend a purchase and 4 stars.  The lack of extras on the DVD's prevents me from rating it higher.",1196380800,6,1459,4.573076923076923

Volume 2 has some of the best episodes from the series, but the pilot series is quite frankly enough reason on its own to purchase the volume.  Some highlighted episodes include; Gadget goes Hawaiian, Out of Scale, Chipwrecked Shipmunks, Shell Shocked, and A Creep in the Deep.  Those are just a few of the classic episodes in this volume.

Devoid of extras once again, however there was a flyer for The Adventures of the Gummi Bears on DVD in the case, but that is all.  Still the price is right for many solid episodes and I suggest to any fan of the series or Chip ""N"" Dale fan to buy this one right away.",1163548800,16,862,4.35
