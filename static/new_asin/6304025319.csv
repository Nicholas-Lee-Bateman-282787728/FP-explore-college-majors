7859036,5,6304025319,"This is honestly the best film I have ever seen, better than The Magnificent Ambersons (I have the complete cut it was given to me by a family member of Orson Wells), better than Ben Hur, better than Taxi Driver, even better than Solaris (not the worthless Hollywood remake with the guy from The Facts Of Life). What are you waiting for this movie is $.3.08 on VHS, click the box to place the order now! Don't listen to all the other reviews those dopes probably like junk like Adaptation and that stupid movie about lucid dreaming with the annoying chick from Juno!!! Wildman Steve is a genius it is just sad that none of these Philistines recognize greatness.",1308268800,,661,4.563025210084033
7859037,3,6304025319,SUPER SOUL BROTHER . I LIKE WILDMAN STEVE JOKES SO MUCH AND I WISH HE HAD A CONCERT FOR SALE. THANKS FOR HAVING TIHS VHS MOVIE. WILLIAM,1219276800,,135,4.037037037037037
7859038,3,6304025319,"I saw this mess when it first came out in 1978 under the title ""The $6,000."" Yeah, it's junk, but it has a kind of ""so bad it's kinda good"" quality. ""Wild Man Steve"" Gallon who was a low-grade ghetto juke joint comic who never hit the big time (for good reason) appears as a drunk bum who is given super powers by soem mad scientist crooks who plans to use his powers to commit robberies. That's the plot folx. But hey, any film where somebody with as little going for him as WMS gets the FINE girl in the end can't be all bad! Oh yeah, the guy who was accurately described as ""looking like Chuck Berry after a night of drinking"" was ""The Boss"" Lee Cross, who was a Dj at WPAL-AM in Charleston, SC in the early 70s.",992908800,,715,4.078014184397163
7859039,1,6304025319,"I rented Super Soul Brother after reading about Wildman Steve in blaxploitation books and articles, and after enjoying Rudy Ray Moore's films like Dolemite and the Human Tornado.
Unlike Rudy, Wildman Steve  isn't even funny. He's the black version of Joe DeRita, the least Stooge  ever.  Steve whines and blubbers through this film.  No one else seems to  do much of anything.  The acting is awful and most of the characters are  totally repulsive, especially Dr. Dippy and the crook who looks like Chuck  Berry after a night of hard drinking.
This is truly one of the worst  films ever made, and its not even enjoyable in an Ed Wood way.",959040000,,638,4.675675675675675
