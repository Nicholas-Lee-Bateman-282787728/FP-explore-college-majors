7952690,3,B00005RY9Z,"On the whole, I found this film depressing and strange.  I failed to appreciate the ""omnipresence of the cow"" and found some of the scenes gruesome.  The beauty of the film escaped me because of the disturbing and disturbed characters.  Definitely not an ""entertaining"" movie.  This one is strictly for the connoisseur.",1025136000,3,319,5.076923076923077
7952691,5,B00005RY9Z,"If you like foreign films you will certainly love this one. It is hauntingly beautiful. This is one of those rare gems that draws you in and doesn't let go until long after the end credits have rolled. Warning: Although this movie has no foul language or nudity, it contains two sex scenes. This is not for family viewing.",1017360000,13,322,4.47457627118644
7952692,5,B00005RY9Z,"This movie captures the beauty and misticism of the Basque country while showing the hard-working naturist spirit of the people. The story spans 3 generations in the life of two basque families who face the hardships of the Spanish civil wars starting with the 1st Carlist War. It all takes place in the lush isolated green valleys of Guipuzcoa. I have spent some time in Guipuzcoa and this movie is the best representation of Caserio (farm) life that I have seen. The script is remarkable and the filming techniques that Medem uses are quite fascinating. I have 2 minor complaints about the movie - 1)Some of the spanish dubbing is a little strange and 2)The use of Carmelo Gomez for a dual role of father/son. These were, however, only minor distractions to an otherwise beautiful yet haunting and disturbing masterpiece of Spanish Cinema!",1012089600,22,841,4.888111888111888
