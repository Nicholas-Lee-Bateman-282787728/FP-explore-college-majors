1612532,2,B00005K2XN,"Another disappointment from Timeless Media Group, maybe better named ""Clueless Media Group"" for once again recycling old newsreel footage that might have been impressive over a generation or two ago, but hardly today with the plethora of materials and the stardards of quality in animation, remastered footage, and subject-area experts we have grown accustomed to over the last decade or so thru the fine series of documentaries produced on cable like ""The History Channel,"" the BBC, including public television's, ""Nova"" and ""The American Experience"".
With poor narration and no remastering, this set is for purists only. The $26.99 charged by Amazon for this set is outrageous; this set can be obtained from other retailers like Ross Dress for Less for a mere $5.99-$9.99 if you must have it.",1210550400,3,794,5.2109375
1612533,5,B00005K2XN,"This DVD is a great value for anyone interested in WWII airplanes and air combat footage.
The single disc contains 3 documentaries covering:
1. Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress - A complete overview of the B-17 from inception to combat usage, with an emphasis on 8th Air Force operations against Germany
2. Consolidated B-24 Liberator - An overview with an emphasis on the famous Ploesti raid of 1942
3. Defenders of the Reich - An overview of Luftwaffe fighters, with an emphasis on daylight air defense
The main reasons I like this video are:
a. Accuracy - Most documentaries get the basics correct but miss out in the details. However writer John Bruning (Crimson Sky: The Air Battle for Korea, etc.) has ensured that the details of model changes, unit deployments, etc. are very accurate. Additionally, the video footage used during the narration is more often than not the correct model of the plane, which is a rarity among video documentaries.
b. More footage than face - Most documentaries spend as much time on the ""faces"" as they do the combat footage. This one has more combat footage with background narration and less face-to-camera interviews than is usual.
For anyone with an interest in air combat PC games, it should be noted that John Bruning was the official historian for Dynamix when it released the critcally acclaimed Red Baron, Aces Of The Pacific, and Aces Over Europe PC games in the early '90s.
The only negative I can think of is that there is no option to play all three documentaries in succession.",1047340800,44,1523,4.816793893129771

7942630,5,B00005K2XN,"I really liked this video.  He presented a good overview of the pluses and minuses of the planes for U.S. and Germany in WWII.  I also agree with the critque of Enrigue Bozzo who only gave it a 3 rating though.  But I had not seen these films on any other video which I have watched about WWII, so I thought it was a great buy and entertaining and infomrative to watch.

7942633,3,B00005K2XN,"The footage is good and fairly complete. Some of it is in color.
Now, regarding what is said and all the crap about ""precision bombing"",
it would hardly be acceptable as WW2 propaganda.
For real information, get the books ""Bomber Command"" by Max Hastings or ""Brute Force: Allied Strategy and Tactics in the Second World War"" by John Ellis.
Being this DVD inexpensive and 3 hrs. long, it is a rather good value for money.",1276732800,7,420,4.613333333333333
7942634,2,B00005K2XN,"The Warbirds of WWII is a horrible DVD, poor quality picture and poorer quality narration!!  Don't waste your money on this item (I already threw my copy away) and if you get it free, don't waste your time watching it!!! You would be better off using your time to wash your car or paint your house!!!!!",1252800000,,302,4.392857142857143

7942636,5,B00005K2XN,"I purchased this set as they have a feature on the B-24 Liberator which Grandpa served on.  The set also includes the Thunderbolt, Fighters of the RAF, Defenders of the Reich, the B-17 Flying Fortress and the Mustang.

What the set does really well is present a complete picture.  There is an overview of the aircraft, how the plane was used in combat and how this impacted the battles.  There are also invterviews with veterans who experienced the battles.

Overall, a good set for those who want to remember what out veterans endured and accomplished to protect our freedom.",1220313600,2,576,4.777777777777778
