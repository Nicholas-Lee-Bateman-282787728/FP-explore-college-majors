Marketed as the 'Oniroku Dan Collection' Switchblade DVD authoring has re-packaged 3 of its' previously released disks as a boxed set.  Oniroku Dan is a rather legendary figure in the world of Japanese erotica - a prolific author of 'mystery and S&M' stories - perhaps the most famous of which is ""Flower and Snake"". The plots of all 3 of these films are purportedly based on his published stories.

I would note that I have reviewed all three of the films contained in this set individually and would suggest checking out these expanded reviews on Amazon for more about the content of each movie - but, generally speaking, all three of these DVDs feature a fair amount of BDSM action and shibari/Japanese style rope bondage blended into their diverse plots. As those who are familiar with Japanese erotic cinema are doubtless aware - these are not overtly sexually explicit films but they do contain a lot of female nudity and (simulated) sexual situations, and, because they are of a relatively recent vintage, they are not plagued by the annoying digital fogging style of censorship imposed on a lot of Japanese ero-flix. The visual quality of all 3 movies is excellent (widescreen)- they are in Japanese language with English sub-titles.

Personally, I really enjoyed all 3 of these films when they were first released individually - wish I had known that they would become available in this discounted format - a heck of a deal!  If you enjoy viewing unclothed Japanese maidens decorated with rope, and fairly intriguing story-lines, I would definitely recommend this 3 pack!",1435968000,13,1693,4.926315789473684
