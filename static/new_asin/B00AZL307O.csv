5529666,5,B00AZL307O,One of the best dvd sets the WWE has done. Very well thought out and much more respect for Foley as a man and definitely a performer,1366329600,,132,3.925925925925926
5529667,3,B00AZL307O,"WWE & Mick Foley did a okay job on this release. I really enjoyed watching the 2 hour documentary about Mick Foley. It was well made. The collection of matches that are included aren't all that good. They should of put in some more top notch Foley matches. Also they should of included alot more matches to begin with. All WWE DVD versions come up short in special features, (the extras) & the exclusive content that, you only get with the Blu-ray version. I purchased this DVD for the documentary portion, & cause im a Mick Foley fan. If you're a Mick Foley fan, wrestling fan, DVD/Blu-ray collector, you'll love this. Nice touch WWE on giving us a (limited edition) Mr. Socko puppet. I liked the way they put the DVD or Blu-ray cases inside Mr. Socko.

Note: If you want the Mr. Socko puppet, get it before the first prints are gone.",1366156800,2,835,4.457516339869281
5529668,5,B00AZL307O,"Can anyone please tell me if this blu-ray is region locked as the UK version does not come with the Mr socko and the price is stupid high.

thanks",1366156800,,146,4.0344827586206895
5529669,5,B00AZL307O,"If it isn't obvious already, this dvd has the long-awaited Mick Foley Documentary, which much like The Rock & CM Punk's documentaries, is just absolutely awesome and extremely well done. It covers everything from days as a kid all the way to his stand-up career that he is currently working on. This highlights tons of memorable matches, tells stories that have been heard before as well as lots of stories that I've never heard. WWE takes the time to make a great show. This documentary is 2 hours and 14 minutes. Although there are several Mick Foley dvds, for a documentary this is the one to get.

There's already a match list here and to my surprise there are not very many repeats (only 2). And for those that are repeated (namely the Hell in a Cell Match) has new commentary by Mick Foley & Joey Styles. They also commentate on a few more matches as well. So this makes a great dvd even if you already own ""Greatest Hits & Misses.""

Great DVD!",1366070400,,950,4.454022988505747
5529670,5,B00AZL307O,"I have seen some reviews of this blu ray as well as some of the other more recent WWE blu ray releases where the reviewers are very critical of the content. Most of these reviews focus on the match selection on disc two or disc three of a three disc set. And there are reviews out there that will tell you specifically which matches are included and so if you are making your decision based on what matches are included that information is available. One of the reviews that I read complained about the fact that there aren't any Mick Foley/Sabu matches and that there aren't any Mick Foley/Terry Funk matches. I think that the reason for that is that there have been other WWE DVD and blu ray releases that cover that and so they tried to put together a set with matches that haven't been included in the other sets some fans are likely to own. To that end there are some gems here that haven't been put in other sets. But for me, really, the bottom line is that you get a full length video about Mick Foley that spans the first disc thats about 90 minutes plus. I don't remember how long it was. It may have been longer. And you get a lot of bonus interviews and promos and so that makes the documentary/biography portion about 2 hours. And the price of this two disc blu ray set is 19.99. So if that was all that I got for my 19.99 I would feel satisfied with that. Most of the movies that I buy on blu ray cost between 19.99 and 27.99 and most of those movies don't come with a bunch of matches with it. I know thats what you've come to expect with wrestling blu rays and so I'm not trying to be down on people for that. I'm just saying that I think that picking apart which matches they put on the set in addition to the bio and the promos and the behind the scenes stuff seems a little bit picky to me. You get something like 17 matches with the set and you get a Mr. Socko sock. That is a lot of value for 19.99 for me. I really liked it and I'm giving it five stars. But if you don't have other WWE or WCW DVDs or blu rays and you are making the decision on whether or not to buy this set on whether or not it has some of the classic Mick Foley/Raven matches or the classic Mick Foley/Terry Funk matches or Mick Foley/Sabu matches then you may want to pass.
But the biography is really good and really well done and it does have some really nice matches on it. A few hidden gems that aren't on other releases.
That's my opinion anyway. Have a nice day!",1365984000,18,2460,4.105809128630705
5529671,2,B00AZL307O,"I gave this a rating 2 not because Mick Foley was not a great performer but that we have seen 90 percent of these matches on other discs over the last 10 years. I,am interested in a few things if anyone can clear them up. Why are the WWE able to show The WWF logo when The World Wildlife Federation owns the rights to those three letters. Also why has no one delved into why Cactus Jack abruptly just stop using the cactus Jack Manson Name,was it his decision or was it the federation scared of what that name represented?Come on WWE give us what we want the AWA,World Class and CWF Florida video library on Blu Ray Discs. You have the material lets get it out to the fans in voulmes must like tv shows.",1365206400,3,703,4.176470588235294

Overall Thoughts: I kind of expected more out of this DVD than what was given. Although his ECW matches are right on the spot, it's his matches from WWF that aren't up to par. Now even though the ones that are supplied on the set are classics, there's still plenty that's left out that should've been put in. For example they should've had the debuts of Mankind, Dude Love, and Cactus Jack on here as well as a few matches from when he was WWF Champion. I also they could've supplied his matches with Steve Austin from 1998 on here. Even some segments on here from his WWF days and as Commissioner would do, but none of it appears on here. If you really want a Foley dvd with his WWF days really focused on then I'd recommend buying the Hard Knocks and Cheap Pops DVD. If anything this is perhaps a sequel to his DVD, Greatest Hits and Misses. All in all this is a good DVD that seemingly focuses more on Mick's early years rather than his career in WWF. Also, if you buy the Best Buy version of this DVD, you get a free Mr. Socko!",1360454400,9,3511,4.712396694214876
5529673,4,B00AZL307O,"Here's the complete match listing for Mick Foley's latest WWE DVD/Blu-ray set. The biography looks great, but the match listing is nothing to get excited about. I understand that they didn't want to have several repeats from Mick's previous set, but in this case, I think they needed to include some of those matches. No Sabu matches? No Terry Funk matches? Come on! At least we will finally be getting the Hell in a Cell match with the Undertaker uncensored with the original WWF logo intact for the first time on DVD or Blu-ray. Again, the documentary looks tremendous and in-depth, but the match listing is really lacking.

Updated on April 18th: I have just viewed the Blu-ray and I gotta say, the documentary is 'Have a Nice Day' the cliff notes edition. Most parts of Mick's life and career are quickly skimmed over or completely ignored. No mention at all about Mick spitting on the WCW Tag Team Titles during his ECW debut against Sabu which enraged the powers that be at WCW leading to his WCW departure; now Mick just leaves WCW after being disappointed with the way WCW failed to capitalize on his ear injury to push his feud with Vader further. That was surprising to see because Mick made a big deal about this on his original DVD match collection:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Mick-Foley-s-Greatest-Hits-Misses-A-Life-in-Wrestling-Hardcore-Edition/dp/B000MGBLVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE: Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses - A Life in Wrestling (Hardcore Edition)</a>. No mention of his feud with Sabu and how that helped to put ECW on the map. No mention of any feuds in ECW, just his hardcore promos, and unless you know the situation with Mick and feelings towards the ECW fans at the time, the purpose of those promos will go over the head of new viewers being introduced to Mick for the first time on this set. Plus, they kayfabed most of the story surrounding the Hell in a Cell match with the Undertaker. It's disappointing to say the least. I understand they have limited time, but a documentary on Mick deserves to be 3 hrs. in length, at least and they didn't come close to that. Now, with that said, the portion of the documentary where Mick starts writing his book and on, is great and it saves this release. So, while not perfect by any means, it's still worth picking up for the documentary. They actually spend the most amount of time on Mick's time as the WWF Commissioner. This will upset some, but the clips are great and Mick says himself that he thinks it's the best contribution he made to his WWF career, so why not feature it?

5529674,5,B00AZL307O,My husband is a big fan of Mick Foley and this DVD did not disappoint me.  I learned a lot about him.  It even comes with a sock cover.  As a not-so-big fan this DVD even entertained me.  I think he's a pretty interesting guy.,1412380800,,226,3.9555555555555557
5529675,5,B00AZL307O,Another great anthology of the career of one of the greatest wrestlers ever!,1404777600,,76,4.923076923076923
5529676,4,B00AZL307O,"You can throw out one or two big characters in the business with wrestling fans & it will always spark a conversation but it's rare when you can throw out four different characters & be talking about the same person. Mankind, Dude Love, Cactus Jack, or his real name....they are all one person in Mick Foley & this is his story told by such talents as Dominic DeNucci, Shane Douglas (you read that right), Terry Funk, Arn Anderson, Michael Hayes, Mike Rotunda, Jim Ross, Kevin Sullivan, William Regal, Vader, Paul Heyman, Joey Styles, Shawn Michaels, Triple H, C.M. Punk, The Miz, Sheamus, Big Show, The Rock, Randy Orton, Michael Cole, Kofi Kingston, John Cena, rock legend Dee Snider along with Mick's childhood friends & his children.

The documentry begins talking about Mick growing up playing various sports like lacrosse & doing things like eating worms to intimidate the other team before getting into amateur wrestling alongside Kevin James from ""The King Of Queens"" before going into how he became a fan of wrestling with such subjects as the impact of the Don Muraco vs. Jimmy Snuka steel cage match along with the concept behind the character he played as a teenager in ""Dude Love."" The story behind training under Dominic DeNucci was discussed next with details of how he tested Mick's will early on, the sacrifices Mick made just to wrestle, the first impressions from fellow trainee Shane Douglas, and how that led to his first couple matches that ended up seeing him with a dislocated jaw. His ventures into both the A.W.A. & USWA were briefly mentioned before going into who helped him get in the door & who sold him to WCW before going into how he was different than everyone else with his look & style followed by the details how he was gone & returned in under 2 years as a completely different Cactus Jack. This career making feud with Sting was discussed before going into details of the feud with Vader in how that started to give him support from the crowd before going into details of how he lost his ear with actual footage of the incident which ultimately lead to him leaving WCW. Mick's time in ECW was briefly discussed in how he brought credibility & what caused the heavy emotion he used in his interviews while also discussing his time in Japan in how that helped fulfill a goal he had in the business. The documentary continued talking about the creation of Mankind with the different suggestions he gave to improve the character, his feud with Undertaker, and the discussion of how the match at Mind Games was his greatest match up to that point with Shawn also commenting on how that match brought out a different side of himself. How Dude Love eventually came to WWE was brought up in detail such as how people started to cheer him despite him not changing anything about Mankind, who predicted the Jim Ross interview would turn him babyface, Triple H discussing fighting all three different characters during this time, and who's idea it was to do the video with all three characters at Madison Square Garden. The infamous Hell In A Cell match was talked about in terms of everyone having no clue what was going to happen when they were at the top of the cell, the reactions to when he went over, Vince's reaction to it backstage, and the effect it's had on the product today before going into how the Mankind character changed & how it took the interaction with one other person to put the character over followed by his relationship with the Rock both as a villain & babyface such as the importance of his first title win, how they went too far with their ""I Quit"" match, and the Rock N' Sock Connection. One of the biggest discussions came here in terms of how he ended up writing his own autobiography & the unexpected result it got when it was released before talking about his matches with Triple H leading into his retirement including him doing the one thing that he's sure no other superstar has ever done when it comes to a WrestleMania main event. Commissioner Foley was talked about next in detail covering such subjects as which other superstars set the tone for where he wanted this to go, the idea behind his ""office"", the significance behind of his orange dog ""Sarge"", and how he compares himself to Bret Hart in that position before going into what started to cause the tension between him & WWE that caused him to leave. His return matches Randy Orton was talked about next as far as why he was disappointed with his WrestleMania performance & how he made up for it the next month at Backlash before going into heavy details about the different types of charity work he does outside the ring to the point where it inspired rock legend Dee Snider & Mick even has a middle school named after him while also putting in a good word for wrestlers outside of the WWE like C.M. Punk followed by discussing his WrestleMania moment with Edge, thoughts on retirement, his stand-up comedy, an others reflecting on Mick close out the presentation.

Blu-Ray extras include 5 different promos, Foley talking about the amateur videos he made about ""Frank Foley"" & Dominic DeNucci's training school, Shane Douglas referring to the first time he met Mick & a rib he played on him during a trip, where the name Cactus Jack & the signature ""Bang Bang"" came from, his first wrestling tours of Africa, how he lost his two front teeth along with a funny story of how that came into play during his Dude Love run in 1998, Paul Heyman talking about a promo he did in WCW that got attention, the relevance of his ""Wanted"" Cactus Jack t-shirt, his flight back from the infamous japanese death match against Terry Funk, his anti-hardcore character in ECW along with the importance of his farewell from the company, William Regal recalling a dangerous move he took during a match against Paul Orndorff, the importance of Kevin Sullivan to his career, the effect his Rock N' Sock Connection jacket had on a sick little boy, Triple H recalling a spot Mick did at WrestleMania 2000, the relevance of Randy Orton spitting in his face, the story of his career as a color commentator, how his final in-ring appearance was ""classic Foley"", a more detailed look at his stand-up comedy career, various people talking about which ""Face Of Foley"" was their favorite, Sheamus recalls the first time he met Mick Foley, the importance of Christmas, his clothing style to the point where his youngest son says he looks homeless, talents telling stories about how ""cheap"" Foley was on the road, and Road Dogg talking about how Mick took his kids on road trips with him when he was traveling.

Matches Include:
Jack Foley & Les Thornton vs. British Bulldogs - This was Foley's first WWE match where he was ""enhancement talent"" against the current WWE Tag Team Champions that was the typical showcase of the Bulldogs at that time that unfortunately resulted in a dislocated jaw.
""Superstars"" September '86
Alternate Commentary: Mick Foley & Joey Styles
[Bonus Match on Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses]

Cactus Jack & Gary Young vs. Scott Steiner & Billy Travis - This was nothing more than a quick tag team match to showcase his time in the AWA with the only thing noteworthy being that Downtown Bruno (WWE's Harvey Whippleman) was his manager at the time.
""AWA All Star Wrestling"" Oct. '88

Cactus Jack Manson vs. Brickhouse Brown - Another match that really wasn't anything special past showcasing his time in the USWA but it was a good back & forth encounter for what it was.
""USWA Wild West Wrestling"" April '89

Cactus Jack vs. Keith Hart - Before I get started, I have to make this note that this isn't the same Keith Hart from the famous Hart family in Calgary. Foley commented before this match that this was to showcase that throughout his career he was always shown to take a beating but this was the first real match that he was able to deliver a beating which was true as Cactus just kept punishing Hart when he could have ended the match at any time including his clothesline over the guardrail & apron elbow over the guardrail onto Keith on the floor.
""WCW Power Hour"" March '90

Submit Or Surrender Match: Cactus Jack vs. Sting - This was a unique match for it's time as it was a combination of a Falls Count Anywhere/Submission/Last Man Standing match as the only way to win the match was by submission or knockout & the fall could take place anywhere. Cactus wore a Sting t-shirt to the ring with the brawling started on the floor with Cactus going into the guardrails & having a rubber trash can used against him to get beat on including a top rope splash before a mistiming on a leap frog by Sting allowed Cactus to take control taking the match back to the outside where he had to struggle with a fan to use a chair on Sting. They continued to trade momentum with Cactus delivering his trademark elbow onto the floor before a mistiming by Sting allowed him to take control sending Cactus off the apron onto the concrete. Mick Foley spoke before the match about how this was their best encounter throughout their initial series as they had already done everything to each other so they had to get innovative for this match including the more creative ways to use a rubber trash can & I can't disagree was this was their best match (to my memory) out of their initial series in 1991.
""WCW Power Hour"" Nov. '91

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Cactus Jack vs. Van Hammer - This match started off hot with Hammer using his guitar to hit Cactus before Cactus sent Hammer over the top rope taking the match to the floor quickly including attempting a sunset flip off the second rope but just ending up going splat on the concrete floor. They made their way fighting to the ramp where Cactus took some hard hits like a powerslam before going off the ramp with Hammer following as they made their way to the outside of the building fighting on the pavement to the horse holding pens using whatever they could including tire cones & a wooden board & a bull rope. This was definitely the best match ever in Van Hammer's career while it was the ""out of control"" type of match you'd expect from Cactus Jack to the point where nobody, including Missy Hyatt, was safe.
""WCW Clash Of The Champions XVIII"" Jan. '92

Barbed Wire Match: Cactus Jack vs. Sandman - Sandman wore his usual ring gear & Cactus was wearing his cowboy boots instead of traditional wrestling boots while the referee had his arms wrapped & wearing gloves to protect him from the barbed wire as both men started off trying to throw each other into it but able to avoid it until Sandman hit it crotch first before they brawled on the outside with Cactus using a trash can multiple times & later ended up back in the outside using whatever was around them from the guardrail to another fan's crutch. Both men ended up hitting the wire multiple times as Sandman hit back first while Cactus was suplexed onto it before both men started to use the wire as a weapon itself by raking body parts against it until it started to bleed like their faces & arms, an atomic drop across the wire, and Sandman wrapping himself in barbed wire using his body as a weapon while Cactus still resorted to using weapons like a trash can. This wasn't any different than a majority of the matches in their feud where it was just a slow paced brawl but this was the best match in their series.
""ECW"" May '95
[ECW: Best Of Cactus Jack]

Cactus Jack vs. Shane Douglas - This match was happening under unusual circumstances as Cactus Jack made it known that he was leaving for the WWE while Shane Douglas was coming back from WWE & they had unfinished business from when Douglas cost Cactus the ECW Title before he left months earlier. Cactus was in the middle of his ""anti-hardcore"" gimmick wearing his suit & cowboy boots as he wasn't expecting to be competing before Douglas eventually beat him out of his suit & dominated until Cactus had to resort to going hardcore using a crutch on Douglas. Douglas still kept coming after Cactus using the crutch himself along with suplexing him on the guardrail spine first followed by Douglas going aerial with a crossbody off the top rope into the crowd. Both men targeted previous injuries like Cactus working over Douglas' throat while Douglas worked over the leg as various elements would come into play for the rest of the match from the referee to who Cactus was calling for to help him & a point in the match with handcuffs & a chair that most become more famous (or infamous) with Mick Foley in WWE close to 3 years later.
ECW CyberSlam '96
Alternate Commentary: Mick Foley & Joey Styles
[ECW: Best Of Cactus Jack; ECW Unreleased Vol. 1]

Mankind vs. Rocky Maivia - Both men traded momentum early with Mankind resorted to brawling tactics like punches & rakes while Rocky wrestled working over the arm & power moves like the powerslam & top rope chop while both men get some offense in on the outside like a running cannonball off the apron or the Rock Bottom on the steel ramp. While this was their first PPV match against each other, it wasn't much past a solid contest between the two with the significance being that Rocky was so disliked by the audience that Mankind got the loudest babyface reactions in this career up to this point.
""In Your House: Cold Day In Hell"" May '97

Mankind vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley - A rematch from the previous King Of The Ring tournament finals that started off with both men trading fist right away with Cactus getting the advantage to the point where Hunter tried to walk away only to get suplexed on the ramp for his troubles before Chyna made her presence known using the steel steps while Hunter used a chair of his own to gain an advantage. Hunter heavily worked over Mankind's leg to the point with attacks & submissions holds to the point where he couldn't make it to the corner on an irish whip before Mankind started to fight back & including spiking Hunter on his head before the match got spilled to the outside & in the crowd continuing later in the show to the outside of the building. While their other series of matches throughout their career were more memorable (King Of The Ring finals, Steel Cage, Falls Count Anywhere, Street Fight, Hell In A Cell), this was still a quality match in that it continued to showcase the more aggressive side of the future ""Triple H"" that we hadn't seen before his feud giving Mankind had his first real challenge since his series with Undertaker months earlier.
""In Your House: Canadian Stampede"" July '97

Dude Love vs. Rocky Maivia - I can only assume this match was added for Foley to include every other match he's had with The Rock that has yet to make it to DVD as that's the only relevance here as the match didn't go long or wasn't anything special past continuing the storyline between Rock & Steve Austin over the Intercontinental Championship.
""RAW"" Nov. '97

Hell In A Cell Match: Mankind vs. Undertaker - You knew this match was going to be special the moment both men started at the top of the cage where they brawled & almost fell through at one point before Mankind was thrown off the top with Jim Ross yelling his now infamous line ""GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY, THAT KILLED HIM! AS GOD AS MY WITNESS, HE'S BROKEN IN HALF!"" The match looked like it was over with Mankind being put on a stretcher with a dislocated shoulder before he decided to go back up only to be chokeslammed through the cage with the chair on top hitting him in the face on the way down. Taker ended up twisting his ankle coming down from the top as one person who came into the ring to check up on Foley ended up getting chokeslammed out of his shoes before they continued the match with Taker ramming the steps into Mankind's arm multiple times but missed a suicide dive that busted him open allowing Mankind to take advantage using the chair before bringing out a back full of thumbtacks. This was probably the most famous Hell In The Cell match & the match that launched Mick Foley into wrestling immortality for the beating he took from start to finish.

Mankind & Kane vs. WWE Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws - This was just a short average tag match from RAW that saw both teams using teamwork with double teaming & quick tags but was more about plugging the other storylines at that time such as what was going on between Undertaker & Kane along with the presence of The Nation who had their issues with DX as well but wasn't relevant past the result.
""RAW"" July '98

Mankind vs. WWE Champion The Rock - Vince & Shane tried to talk Mankind out of the match earlier to no avail causing Rock to attack from behind before Mankind came back throwing Rock to the outside sending him into the announce table & barricade while using the steel steps to the point where Mr. McMahon had to step in threatening the referee to take control & also causing a distraction allowing Rock to take over with him giving a receipt on the outside using the cable cord to choke & later giving Mankind a slam off the ropes to the floor before doing commentary. Mankind fought back to the point where Vince got worried & attempted to use his power to get the same result from Survivor Series causing Mankind to take matters into his own hands to ensure that didn't happen but also allowed Rock to use a chair before the McMahon's got involved one too many times to where it backfired on Rock. This was just like the earlier match against Triple H where they've had more famous encounters (Survivor Series, ""I Quit"", Empty Arena, Last Man Standing, Ladder) that always overshadows this but it was still a quality encounter in it's own right.
""In Your House: Rock Bottom"" Dec. '98

WWE Tag Team Champions The Rock N' Sock Connection vs. Triple H & Shane McMahon - Outside of just showcasing ""The Rock N' Sock Connection"", this was your basic quick tag team match that saw Triple H & Shane single out Mankind with Triple H doing the work & Shane showing off building to the hot tag to The Rock.
""SmackDown"" Sept. '99

Hardcore Match: Mankind vs. Al Snow - Their friendship turned sour came to ahead here with both men getting ""hardcore"" from the start with Al Snow bring & using a baseball bat in the ring while Foley used a chair on the outside before both men ended up brawling at the announce table to around ringside with more weapons being used. The match made it's way back into the ring where Al Snow took a pretty hard ""strike"" to the lower area before making it's way all the back to the locker room where a camera man got knocked down in the process. Mick has gone on record saying that this was his best match during the period where his body had really broken down & wasn't having good matches and I couldn't agree more as the stipulation made this match both hardcore yet entertaining.
""SmackDown"" Dec. '99

Hell In A Cell: Cactus Jack vs. WWE Champion Triple H - This was ""Title vs. Career"" as Mick Foley's career would be over if he lost this match. Cactus promised weeks before the match that he would climb to the top of the cell & come off it onto Triple H however the door to the cell was mysteriously heavily padlocked to ensure that didn't happen. Triple H brought the pain here using anything he could get his hands on to dish out punishment such as the cell itself, steel steps, and a chair but Cactus was able to recover & use the chair himself for what J.R. called ""barbaric birth control"" along with the steps & cell to bust Triple H open before dropping his trademark second rope elbow drop using the chair busting Triple H open in the process. Things really began to pick up when Cactus ended up making a door allowing Triple H to escape the cage & end up on the top of the cage with Cactus following him with a barbed wire board. From here, things really got out of control with the barbed wire board on fire before Cactus, once again, took a dangerous fall. This match served told the story well of Cactus refused to quit & stay down fighting for his dream while elevating Triple H in a true main eventer who take take the punishment as well as dish it.
No Way Out '00
[Hell In A Cell; Triple H: King Of Kings]

I really enjoyed the documentary as it covered various subjects & went over 2 hours long with some of the subjects that I would have liked to seen discuss in more detail were talked about more in the Blu-Ray extras. I have mixed feelings on the match selection in that I'm glad he didn't reuse matches from his previous DVD collection without adding the alternative commentary to give it a different feel watching it this time around. I enjoyed that we got some rare quality gems (Sting, Van Hammer, Canadian Stampede vs. Triple H, Rock Bottom vs. The Rock, Al Snow) but some of the matches didn't really make any sense as to why there were on here as they weren't a quality encounter or had no real relevance to his career (Rocky Maivia matches, tag match vs. Triple H & Shane) while Foley matches were forgotten about such as the Halloween Havoc match against Vader or his Falls Count Anywhere against Paul Orndorff for starters. In the end, the documentary was great while the bonus stories & promos where one of my favorite selections on a DVD set in a long time but it was the match selection that stops this from being a perfect set but I still recommend.",1396137600,5,21465,4.528744521783965
5529677,1,B00AZL307O,"If the product advertises a special edition Mr. Socko to be included and it does not, that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",1394150400,,122,4.125
5529678,5,B00AZL307O,Bought this for a member of the family that has always been a huge fan. He still reads the book we bought him by Mick Foley every year as well.,1392768000,,143,3.8
5529679,5,B00AZL307O,"This is an absolute ""Must have"" for any Foley or wrestling fan. The documentary is fantastic and very in depth. I had it on and even the old lady was captivated by the saga of Mick Foley. It covers his whole career (minus TNA of course) and highly recommend this one!",1390694400,,267,4.254901960784314
5529680,5,B00AZL307O,"This DVD is something I've always wanted. As cheesy as that may sound. Anything to do with Mick Foley, I always love to watch and/or read. Definite Buy!",1390435200,,152,4.464285714285714
5529681,5,B00AZL307O,"It's great!  Watched this with my 4 year old son, he loved it!  Follow the story of Foley's entire career .. from wrestling, to becoming an author, to his stand up comedy .. and of course, it contains the famous HIAC match with the Undertaker!",1389139200,,243,4.377777777777778
5529682,3,B00AZL307O,Ordered the copy with the Mr. Socko and only received the basic version. Not sure what happened but enjoyed the DVD story a ton,1385510400,,127,4.333333333333333
5529683,5,B00AZL307O,My son loved it. It arrived a couple days later than promised but it was in great shape. Thank you.,1382918400,,99,4.0
5529684,5,B00AZL307O,"I grew up a wrestling fan in the 1980's - Hogan, Savage, Flair, Steamboat etc.  I used to read Pro Wrestling Illustrated religiously over WWF magazine because it gave a more complete picture of the territorial promotions.  I remember crazy photos of a madman named Cactus Jack, often with his smiling face covered in blood, and was very intrigued.  When he finally arrived in WWF almost a decade later as Mankind, he instantly won me over with his unique character, creepy promos and extreme bump-taking, brawling style.

This documentary is one of the better retrospectives that WWE has produced over the years and there have been many good ones.  If you've read Mick's first book, a lot of the ground covered here might be familiar to you, but framed in such a way that it is still very enjoyable.  Mick himself comes off as very likeable and is a natural storyteller.  If you aren't a fan going in you certainly will be by the time the credits roll.  The matches, on the other hand, leave a bit to be desired.  I would definitely recommend getting the Greatest Hits and Misses dvd set as a companion piece - it has the better selection of matches.  While I appreciate WWE trying not to duplicate, I would have loved to have some of those matches on blu-ray.  Not to be too nit-picky though, this has some great matches as well.  The audio/video presentation is what has come to be expected from WWE released.  The new, HD material is excellent while the older clips and matches from the 80's/90's/early 2000's definitely look dated and reveal the limitations of video.  Still nice to have.

I would recommend this to any fan of professional wrestling, or even someone with a remote interest in it.  Mick is up there with the all-time greats and has a unique, underdog type story that is very easy to relate to.",1378857600,2,1813,4.61875
5529685,5,B00AZL307O,This will be a Christmas gift and I know it will be a great surprise.  My son is a big fan of MIck Foley so I know he will be thrilled.,1377907200,,135,3.3548387096774195
5529686,5,B00AZL307O,I gave this to my husband for his birthday. He is a huge WWE fan and really enjoyed the special features in addition to the main documentary. The Mr. Socko puppet that the DVD comes in was also a big hit.,1376179200,,204,4.0
5529687,5,B00AZL307O,Mick Foley is a wild man!!  I'm sure his family is happy he's not wrestling anymore.  I can't believe some of the things he's done.,1376006400,,131,4.2
5529688,2,B00AZL307O,"While the DVD itself was amazing, nowhere in the description did it say mr. Socko was not included. Very let down when it arrived. I could have got it cheaper elsewhere had I known",1375574400,,180,4.323529411764706
5529689,5,B00AZL307O,I got this as a surprise for my husband and he was stoked! We watched it together and quite frankly I got drawn in. This guy had a really cool story and enjoyed him telling it.,1375056000,,176,3.9166666666666665

5529694,4,B00AZL307O,"This is a good story telling of mick foleys life, but there are no extra matches, lots of story's, but lack of extra matches might turn fans off, but still a must buy if your a fan",1371513600,,180,3.891891891891892

5529696,5,B00AZL307O,"It has so much footage, its worth the price. If you are a Mick Foley, Cactus Jack, Mankind or Dude Love fan, this is the DVD for you! It combines great documentary that comments on everything up to his latest ventures. Then it gives you a second DVD of famous matches and his favorite matches. They aren't just the same matches he talks about in the documentary. Lots of Variety.",1370390400,,379,4.428571428571429

5529699,4,B00AZL307O,"I really enjoyed the DVD overall especially the bio part of it. If I had one complaint it would be that there wasn't enough WCW matches. They are harder to find than the WWE matches. Other than that, a very good DVD",1369267200,,215,4.142857142857143
5529700,5,B00AZL307O,Fun and entertaining wiht a decent amount of matches and alt commentary to some of the matches with joey Styles.,1369180800,,112,4.65
5529701,2,B00AZL307O,I love the Blu-Ray and The Mick Foley documentary but didn't receive the Socko sock puppet which was my reason for ordering it instead of buying at a local store sooner.,1369094400,,169,4.483870967741935
5529702,5,B00AZL307O,"Honestly, out of all the retrospectives done by WWE on Mick Foley, this is by far the cream if the crop! You don't just get his greatest matches, you hear about his life story. Excellently produced and is one of the best WWE videos around, with CM Punk's coming in at a VERY close second! Keep up the great work WWE!",1368748800,,316,4.19672131147541
5529703,5,B00AZL307O,"True legend of the sport, has given so much to the industry very deserving of his HOF honour! Definatly  reccomend",1368576000,,114,4.7
5529704,5,B00AZL307O,A lot of what is contained here has been released before but Disc 1 makes this set a must own. If you are a Foley fan you will love the documentary and if you have never heard of Mick Foley the documentary will make you fan of him. I have  watched the previous DVD release and read his autobiography but to watch him tell it and get the view point from people who worked with him really did his story justice. This release is a must own that tells the story of the man and not just the wrestler. I am glad i didn't overlook this release just because i had seen the matches.,1368576000,,573,4.026315789473684
5529705,3,B00AZL307O,The DVD was great  but I wanted Mr. Socko. Mr Socko was supposed to have come with the D.V.D. Please send now.,1368489600,,110,4.0
5529706,5,B00AZL307O,"I already own all of Foley's DVD sets, so what makes me extra happy is that they've managed to put together a set of pretty much all new matches.  The only repeat you get if you already have his other sets (or practically any other WWE dvd) is the Taker HIAC match, but I was thrilled to see it comes with a commentary track this time around, so even that feels like new content.  His '80s WWF debut shows up again, but whatevs, it's like 5 or 6 minutes of DVD time, tops.

Bottom line (WHAT?!), it's 3 discs of rarely seen and previously unreleased (on DVD) Foley matches.  If you're a Foley fan, you already know this is a must-have.  And BTW, the interview segments between the matches are phenomenal.  Similar to how Bret's latest set was done.  I love that style and hope it becomes the new normal.  So thumbs way, way up from me and here's hoping they manage to dig out even more forgotten Foley fights for future discs.",1368403200,,926,4.312138728323699
5529707,5,B00AZL307O,Great blu-ray! Love Mick Foley!  Would definately recommend this to any wrestling fan!  Foley is God! Have a nice day!,1368403200,,118,4.85
5529708,5,B00AZL307O,I love Mick Foley. This was the Ultimate Collection of my wrestling Hero! Action packed and uncensored. I love this stuff!,1368316800,,122,4.857142857142857
5529709,5,B00AZL307O,"I'm writing this review purely as a word of caution for anyone considering ordering the Socko Limited Edition version of this Blu Ray set. The product itself is excellent and on-par with the best media WWE has released in the past few years.

However, Amazon seems to have a mixup somewhere in their inventory, or at least I ran into this problem, which causes the warehouse to send you the regular edition Blu Ray (no Mr. Socko). I contacted Amazon about this, they sent a replacement out immediately, and it too was a regular edition. I ended up returning both and going to Best Buy.",1368057600,,585,4.571428571428571
5529710,5,B00AZL307O,"This is a documentary that makes you feel better having watched it. Really interesting look into Mick Foley's life and career. The matches packed into the DVD are pretty decent choices, too. The DVD is done in a similar manner to CM Punk: Best In The World so if you liked that one, you'll probably like this one.",1368057600,,313,4.413793103448276
5529711,5,B00AZL307O,Typical WWE production ... lots of matches some not seen before but lots repeated from prior releases..overall good effort to honar a great performer and Hall of Fame inductee...Fans will love it.,1367798400,,196,5.15625
5529712,5,B00AZL307O,"So went a haunting early 90's WCW promo that would, for me, set Mick Foley, as Cactus Jack, apart from anyone else in wrestling. Sadly for me, that particular promo isn't on this set, but I'll have to give the producers a pass because the bio is arguably the best one that the company has ever done. Even casual fans know Foley's legendary willingness to push the limits of physical pain for the sake of entertaining the public. But it was the depth and believability of Foley's characters that gave that violence a context and a meaning. Despite the Japanese death matches there was always a profound humanity that transcended the stage.

The documentary on Foley's life and wrestling career is exceptionally well done and provides a wealth of rare footage that makes a nice companion to `Have a Nice Day' (the bestselling book that alerted the publishing community that wrestling fans could read, well, some of them anyway). The documentary and blu-ray extras provide footage of many of the stories documented in the biography. The production gives you the feel of sitting in a coffee house and listening to stories of a unique, bizarre, and well rounded life, well lived.  His humanitarian work for the RAINN network, Make a Wish Foundation and other non-profits makes a nice juxtaposition to the barbed wire baseball bats and C4 Japanese Death Match explosions.

The bonus features are excellent, especially that most of the selected interviews and segments are introduced by the author with a little bit of back story, which provides some really welcome, behind the curtain insight. There is a great selection of matches spanning the late 80's through any number of Foley's post millennium `retirements'. The matches are not a rehash of those previously released in the various `best of' collections. No ""cheap pops"" here, everything was earned the hard way.

I have read that the real trick in wrestling, the thing that puts butts in seats, is making the fans care about the characters. I can think of few wrestlers who made the fans care more than Mick Foley, and this DVD is a great testament to that.",1367452800,,2109,4.866295264623956

5529718,4,B00AZL307O,"You can throw out one or two big characters in the business with wrestling fans & it will always spark a conversation but it's rare when you can throw out four different characters & be talking about the same person.  Mankind, Dude Love, Cactus Jack, or his real name....they are all one person in Mick Foley & this is his story told by such talents as Dominic DeNucci, Shane Douglas (you read that right), Terry Funk, Arn Anderson, Michael Hayes, Mike Rotunda, Jim Ross, Kevin Sullivan, William Regal, Vader, Paul Heyman, Joey Styles, Shawn Michaels, Triple H, C.M. Punk, The Miz, Sheamus, Big Show, The Rock, Randy Orton, Michael Cole, Kofi Kingston, John Cena, rock legend Dee Snider along with Mick's childhood friends & his children.

The documentry begins talking about Mick growing up playing various sports like lacrosse & doing things like eating worms to intimidate the other team before getting into amateur wrestling alongside Kevin James from ""The King Of Queens"" before going into how he became a fan of wrestling with such subjects as the impact of the Don Muraco vs. Jimmy Snuka steel cage match along with the concept behind the character he played as a teenager in ""Dude Love.""  The story behind training under Dominic DeNucci was discussed next with details of how he tested Mick's will early on, the sacrifices Mick made just to wrestle, the first impressions from fellow trainee Shane Douglas, and how that led to his first couple matches that ended up seeing him with a dislocated jaw.  His ventures into both the A.W.A. & USWA were briefly mentioned before going into who helped him get in the door & who sold him to WCW before going into how he was different than everyone else with his look & style followed by the details how he was gone & returned in under 2 years as a completely different Cactus Jack.  This career making feud with Sting was discussed before going into details of the feud with Vader in how that started to give him support from the crowd before going into details of how he lost his ear with actual footage of the incident which ultimately lead to him leaving WCW.  Mick's time in ECW was briefly discussed in how he brought credibility & what caused the heavy emotion he used in his interviews while also discussing his time in Japan in how that helped fulfill a goal he had in the business.  The documentary continued talking about the creation of Mankind with the different suggestions he gave to improve the character, his feud with Undertaker, and the discussion of how the match at Mind Games was his greatest match up to that point with Shawn also commenting on how that match brought out a different side of himself.  How Dude Love eventually came to WWE was brought up in detail such as how people started to cheer him despite him not changing anything about Mankind, who predicted the Jim Ross interview would turn him babyface, Triple H discussing fighting all three different characters during this time, and who's idea it was to do the video with all three characters at Madison Square Garden.  The infamous Hell In A Cell match was talked about in terms of everyone having no clue what was going to happen when they were at the top of the cell, the reactions to when he went over, Vince's reaction to it backstage, and the effect it's had on the product today before going into how the Mankind character changed & how it took the interaction with one other person to put the character over followed by his relationship with the Rock both as a villain & babyface such as the importance of his first title win, how they went too far with their ""I Quit"" match, and the Rock N' Sock Connection.  One of the biggest discussions came here in terms of how he ended up writing his own autobiography & the unexpected result it got when it was released before talking about his matches with Triple H leading into his retirement including him doing the one thing that he's sure no other superstar has ever done when it comes to a WrestleMania main event.  Commissioner Foley was talked about next in detail covering such subjects as which other superstars set the tone for where he wanted this to go, the idea behind his ""office"", the significance behind of his orange dog ""Sarge"", and how he compares himself to Bret Hart in that position before going into what started to cause the tension between him & WWE that caused him to leave.  His return matches Randy Orton was talked about next as far as why he was disappointed with his WrestleMania performance & how he made up for it the next month at Backlash before going into heavy details about the different types of charity work he does outside the ring to the point where it inspired rock legend Dee Snider & Mick even has a middle school named after him while also putting in a good word for wrestlers outside of the WWE like C.M. Punk followed by discussing his WrestleMania moment with Edge, thoughts on retirement, his stand-up comedy, an others reflecting on Mick close out the presentation.

Blu-Ray extras include 5 different promos, Foley talking about the amateur videos he made about ""Frank Foley"" & Dominic DeNucci's training school, Shane Douglas referring to the first time he met Mick & a rib he played on him during a trip, where the name Cactus Jack & the signature ""Bang Bang"" came from, his first wrestling tours of Africa, how he lost his two front teeth along with a funny story of how that came into play during his Dude Love run in 1998, Paul Heyman talking about a promo he did in WCW that got attention, the relevance of his ""Wanted"" Cactus Jack t-shirt, his flight back from the infamous japanese death match against Terry Funk, his anti-hardcore character in ECW along with the importance of his farewell from the company, William Regal recalling a dangerous move he took during a match against Paul Orndorff, the importance of Kevin Sullivan to his career, the effect his Rock N' Sock Connection jacket had on a sick little boy, Triple H recalling a spot Mick did at WrestleMania 2000, the relevance of Randy Orton spitting in his face, the story of his career as a color commentator, how his final in-ring appearance was ""classic Foley"", a more detailed look at his stand-up comedy career, various people talking about which ""Face Of Foley"" was their favorite, Sheamus recalls the first time he met Mick Foley, the importance of Christmas, his clothing style to the point where his youngest son says he looks homeless, talents telling stories about how ""cheap"" Foley was on the road, and Road Dogg talking about how Mick took his kids on road trips with him when he was traveling.

Matches Include:
Jack Foley & Les Thornton vs. British Bulldogs - This was Foley's first WWE match where he was ""enhancement talent"" against the current WWE Tag Team Champions that was the typical showcase of the Bulldogs at that time that unfortunately resulted in a dislocated jaw.
""Superstars"" September '86
Alternate Commentary: Mick Foley & Joey Styles
[Bonus Match on Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses]

Cactus Jack & Gary Young vs. Scott Steiner & Billy Travis - This was nothing more than a quick tag team match to showcase his time in the AWA with the only thing noteworthy being that Downtown Bruno (WWE's Harvey Whippleman) was his manager at the time.

Cactus Jack Manson vs. Brickhouse Brown - Another match that really wasn't anything special past showcasing his time in the USWA but it was a good back & forth encounter for what it was.
""USWA Wild West Wrestling"" April '89

Cactus Jack vs. Keith Hart - Before I get started, I have to make this note that this isn't the same Keith Hart from the famous Hart family in Calgary.  Foley commented before this match that this was to showcase that throughout his career he was always shown to take a beating but this was the first real match that he was able to deliver a beating which was true as Cactus just kept punishing Hart when he could have ended the match at any time including his clothesline over the guardrail & apron elbow over the guardrail onto Keith on the floor.
""WCW Power Hour"" March '90

Submit Or Surrender Match: Cactus Jack vs. Sting - This was a unique match for it's time as it was a combination of a Falls Count Anywhere/Submission/Last Man Standing match as the only way to win the match was by submission or knockout & the fall could take place anywhere.  Cactus wore a Sting t-shirt to the ring with the brawling started on the floor with Cactus going into the guardrails & having a rubber trash can used against him to get beat on including a top rope splash before a mistiming on a leap frog by Sting allowed Cactus to take control taking the match back to the outside where he had to struggle with a fan to use a chair on Sting.  They continued to trade momentum with Cactus delivering his trademark elbow onto the floor before a mistiming by Sting allowed him to take control sending Cactus off the apron onto the concrete.  Mick Foley spoke before the match about how this was their best encounter throughout their initial series as they had already done everything to each other so they had to get innovative for this match including the more creative ways to use a rubber trash can & I can't disagree was this was their best match (to my memory) out of their initial series in 1991.
""WCW Power Hour"" Nov. '91

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Cactus Jack vs. Van Hammer - This match started off hot with Hammer using his guitar to hit Cactus before Cactus sent Hammer over the top rope taking the match to the floor quickly including attempting a sunset flip off the second rope but just ending up going splat on the concrete floor.  They made their way fighting to the ramp where Cactus took some hard hits like a powerslam before going off the ramp with Hammer following as they made their way to the outside of the building fighting on the pavement to the horse holding pens using whatever they could including tire cones & a wooden board & a bull rope.  This was definitely the best match ever in Van Hammer's career while it was the ""out of control"" type of match you'd expect from Cactus Jack to the point where nobody, including Missy Hyatt, was safe.
""WCW Clash Of The Champions XVIII"" Jan. '92

Barbed Wire Match: Cactus Jack vs. Sandman - Sandman wore his usual ring gear & Cactus was wearing his cowboy boots instead of traditional wrestling boots while the referee had his arms wrapped & wearing gloves to protect him from the barbed wire as both men started off trying to throw each other into it but able to avoid it until Sandman hit it crotch first before they brawled on the outside with Cactus using a trash can multiple times & later ended up back in the outside using whatever was around them from the guardrail to another fan's crutch.  Both men ended up hitting the wire multiple times as Sandman hit back first while Cactus was suplexed onto it before both men started to use the wire as a weapon itself by raking body parts against it until it started to bleed like their faces & arms, an atomic drop across the wire, and Sandman wrapping himself in barbed wire using his body as a weapon while Cactus still resorted to using weapons like a trash can.  This wasn't any different than a majority of the matches in their feud where it was just a slow paced brawl but this was the best match in their series.
""ECW"" May '95
[ECW: Best Of Cactus Jack]

Cactus Jack vs. Shane Douglas - This match was happening under unusual circumstances as Cactus Jack made it known that he was leaving for the WWE while Shane Douglas was coming back from WWE & they had unfinished business from when Douglas cost Cactus the ECW Title before he left months earlier. Cactus was in the middle of his ""anti-hardcore"" gimmick wearing his suit & cowboy boots as he wasn't expecting to be competing before Douglas eventually beat him out of his suit & dominated until Cactus had to resort to going hardcore using a crutch on Douglas. Douglas still kept coming after Cactus using the crutch himself along with suplexing him on the guardrail spine first followed by Douglas going aerial with a crossbody off the top rope into the crowd. Both men targeted previous injuries like Cactus working over Douglas' throat while Douglas worked over the leg as various elements would come into play for the rest of the match from the referee to who Cactus was calling for to help him & a point in the match with handcuffs & a chair that most become more famous (or infamous) with Mick Foley in WWE close to 3 years later.
ECW CyberSlam '96
Alternate Commentary: Mick Foley & Joey Styles
[ECW: Best Of Cactus Jack; ECW Unreleased Vol. 1]

Mankind vs. Rocky Maivia - Both men traded momentum early with Mankind resorted to brawling tactics like punches & rakes while Rocky wrestled working over the arm & power moves like the powerslam & top rope chop while both men get some offense in on the outside like a running cannonball off the apron or the Rock Bottom on the steel ramp.  While this was their first PPV match against each other, it wasn't much past a solid contest between the two with the significance being that Rocky was so disliked by the audience that Mankind got the loudest babyface reactions in this career up to this point.
""In Your House: Cold Day In Hell"" May '97

Mankind vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley - A rematch from the previous King Of The Ring tournament finals that started off with both men trading fist right away with Cactus getting the advantage to the point where Hunter tried to walk away only to get suplexed on the ramp for his troubles before Chyna made her presence known using the steel steps while Hunter used a chair of his own to gain an advantage.  Hunter heavily worked over Mankind's leg to the point with attacks & submissions holds to the point where he couldn't make it to the corner on an irish whip before Mankind started to fight back & including spiking Hunter on his head before the match got spilled to the outside & in the crowd continuing later in the show to the outside of the building.  While their other series of matches throughout their career were more memorable (King Of The Ring finals, Steel Cage, Falls Count Anywhere, Street Fight, Hell In A Cell), this was still a quality match in that it continued to showcase the more aggressive side of the future ""Triple H"" that we hadn't seen before his feud giving Mankind had his first real challenge since his series with Undertaker months earlier.
""In Your House: Canadian Stampede"" July '97

Dude Love vs. Rocky Maivia - I can only assume this match was added for Foley to include every other match he's had with The Rock that has yet to make it to DVD as that's the only relevance here as the match didn't go long or wasn't anything special past continuing the storyline between Rock & Steve Austin over the Intercontinental Championship.
""RAW"" Nov. '97

Hell In A Cell Match: Mankind vs. Undertaker - You knew this match was going to be special the moment both men started at the top of the cage where they brawled & almost fell through at one point before Mankind was thrown off the top with Jim Ross yelling his now infamous line ""GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY, THAT KILLED HIM! AS GOD AS MY WITNESS, HE'S BROKEN IN HALF!"" The match looked like it was over with Mankind being put on a stretcher with a dislocated shoulder before he decided to go back up only to be chokeslammed through the cage with the chair on top hitting him in the face on the way down. Taker ended up twisting his ankle coming down from the top as one person who came into the ring to check up on Foley ended up getting chokeslammed out of his shoes before they continued the match with Taker ramming the steps into Mankind's arm multiple times but missed a suicide dive that busted him open allowing Mankind to take advantage using the chair before bringing out a back full of thumbtacks. This was probably the most famous Hell In The Cell match & the match that launched Mick Foley into wrestling immortality for the beating he took from start to finish.
King Of The Ring 98
[Mick Foley: Greatest Hits & Misses; Hell In A Cell; Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker; Best Of King Of The Ring; OMG: Top 50 Moments]
Alternate Commentary: Mick Foley & Joey Styles

Mankind & Kane vs. WWE Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws - This was just a short average tag match from RAW that saw both teams using teamwork with double teaming & quick tags but was more about plugging the other storylines at that time such as what was going on between Undertaker & Kane along with the presence of The Nation who had their issues with DX as well but wasn't relevant past the result.
""RAW"" July '98

Mankind vs. WWE Champion The Rock - Vince & Shane tried to talk Mankind out of the match earlier to no avail causing Rock to attack from behind before Mankind came back throwing Rock to the outside sending him into the announce table & barricade while using the steel steps to the point where Mr. McMahon had to step in threatening the referee to take control & also causing a distraction allowing Rock to take over with him giving a receipt on the outside using the cable cord to choke & later giving Mankind a slam off the ropes to the floor before doing commentary.  Mankind fought back to the point where Vince got worried & attempted to use his power to get the same result from Survivor Series causing Mankind to take matters into his own hands to ensure that didn't happen but also allowed Rock to use a chair before the McMahon's got involved one too many times to where it backfired on Rock.  This was just like the earlier match against Triple H where they've had more famous encounters (Survivor Series, ""I Quit"", Empty Arena, Last Man Standing, Ladder) that always overshadows this but it was still a quality encounter in it's own right.
""In Your House: Rock Bottom"" Dec. '98

WWE Tag Team Champions The Rock N' Sock Connection vs. Triple H & Shane McMahon - Outside of just showcasing ""The Rock N' Sock Connection"", this was your basic quick tag team match that saw Triple H & Shane single out Mankind with Triple H doing the work & Shane showing off building to the hot tag to The Rock.
""SmackDown"" Sept. '99

Hardcore Match: Mankind vs. Al Snow - Their friendship turned sour came to ahead here with both men getting ""hardcore"" from the start with Al Snow bring & using a baseball bat in the ring while Foley used a chair on the outside before both men ended up brawling at the announce table to around ringside with more weapons being used.  The match made it's way back into the ring where Al Snow took a pretty hard ""strike"" to the lower area before making it's way all the back to the locker room where a camera man got knocked down in the process.  Mick has gone on record saying that this was his best match during the period where his body had really broken down & wasn't having good matches and I couldn't agree more as the stipulation made this match both hardcore yet entertaining.
""SmackDown"" Dec. '99

Hell In A Cell: Cactus Jack vs. WWE Champion Triple H - This was ""Title vs. Career"" as Mick Foley's career would be over if he lost this match. Cactus promised weeks before the match that he would climb to the top of the cell & come off it onto Triple H however the door to the cell was mysteriously heavily padlocked to ensure that didn't happen. Triple H brought the pain here using anything he could get his hands on to dish out punishment such as the cell itself, steel steps, and a chair but Cactus was able to recover & use the chair himself for what J.R. called ""barbaric birth control"" along with the steps & cell to bust Triple H open before dropping his trademark second rope elbow drop using the chair busting Triple H open in the process. Things really began to pick up when Cactus ended up making a door allowing Triple H to escape the cage & end up on the top of the cage with Cactus following him with a barbed wire board. From here, things really got out of control with the barbed wire board on fire before Cactus, once again, took a dangerous fall. This match served told the story well of Cactus refused to quit & stay down fighting for his dream while elevating Triple H in a true main eventer who take take the punishment as well as dish it.
No Way Out '00
[Hell In A Cell; Triple H: King Of Kings]

I really enjoyed the documentary as it covered various subjects & went over 2 hours long with some of the subjects that I would have liked to seen discuss in more detail were talked about more in the Blu-Ray extras.  I have mixed feelings on the match selection in that I'm glad he didn't reuse matches from his previous DVD collection without adding the alternative commentary to give it a different feel watching it this time around.  I enjoyed that we got some rare quality gems (Sting, Van Hammer, Canadian Stampede vs. Triple H, Rock Bottom vs. The Rock, Al Snow) but some of the matches didn't really make any sense as to why there were on here as they weren't a quality encounter or had no real relevance to his career (Rocky Maivia matches, tag match vs. Triple H & Shane) while Foley matches were forgotten about such as the Halloween Havoc match against Vader or his Falls Count Anywhere against Paul Orndorff for starters.  In the end, the documentary was great while the bonus stories & promos where one of my favorite selections on a DVD set in a long time but it was the match selection that stops this from being a perfect set but I still recommend.",1366675200,13,21494,4.528744521783965
5529719,5,B00AZL307O,If your a Foley fan get this dvd its well worth the money. I bought the dvd version and I loved every minute of it. Theres some really early Cactus Jack matches on this set. The documentary is the best I've ever seen its over 2 hours long and goes into great detail on Micks career.,1366588800,3,282,4.053571428571429
5529720,5,B00AZL307O,"""The Hardcore Legend"", ""Ms. Foley's Baby Boy"", he was Dude Love, Cactus Jack, Mankind, whatever you want to call him, fans around the world know Mick Foley as one of the most daring and risk taking people ever in professional wrestling. This set chronicles his career from humble beginnings to the stardom he earned through his blood, sweat, tears and sacrifice in and out of the ring.

The bio begins with his growing up, how he became a wrestling fan from an early age even doing some amateur wrestling in high school. He and close friends talk about how he did writing in middle and high school, which obviously influenced him to write three New York Times Bestsellers later in his WWE career. His love of wrestling really took off when he saw Jimmy Snuka do his famous dive off the cage onto Don Muraco in '83, sometime after this he began to train for professional wrestling in unusual fashion to say the least, jumping off of roofs onto matresses, for example. But he did end up going in to an actual training school to start learning the skills needed to succeed.

The bio then goes to his first run in WCW as Cactus Jack, including working with Sting, Vader, then talking about the incident where he lost his ear in Germany in a match against Vader in '93. Then his time in ECW and Japan are talked about before moving to his famous WWE run, where he began as Mankind and had rivalries with guys like The Undertaker, The Rock. His Dude Love and Cactus Jack characters came out later and he fought Stone Cold in an epic match at Over The Edge '98. Then his championships wins over the Rock and his feud with Triple H are talked about before going into his first retirement in Feb. of '00.

The funny side of Mick is shown when his time as the on air Commissioner is discussed, then his leaving WWE for 18 months, which still shocked me to this day that he left for that long. Loved the parts where he talks about his feuds with Orton and later Edge as both of those guys were really elevated by Mick's style. There's much more to this bio but it caps off with his return to WWE in 2011, throughout the whole documentary you hear from the man himself, close friends, fellow wrestlers and backstage officials like Terry Funk, Arn Anderson, Michael Hayes and others (even Shane Douglas, which stunned me) who all give their honest takes on Foley's career and what he's done to help the business.

Matches on Disc 1: *-Indicates this match has alternate commentary by Mick Foley & Joey Styles

*-9/1986, Superstars, w/Les Thornton vs. The British Bulldogs: Foley admitted during his bio he was inexperienced coming into this match and he took a good beating from both Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid. He took a clothesline that ended up busting his jaw up to where he couldn't eat solid food for a month. Foley ends up taking the pin here as the Bulldogs win. 2/10, cause it's a squash match.

-10/1988, AWA All-Star Wrestling, w/Gary Young vs. Scott Steiner & Billy Travis: Basic one here as Foley was still in the very early part of his career, he took a good amount of the bumps here, but does get in a few moves. Steiner and Travis shine here but Young hits Scott with a boot and Foley covers to win. 3/10.

-4/1989, Wild West Wrestling, vs. Brickhouse Brown: This is an okay one, Brown displayed some strength, Cactus Jack uses some dirty tactics to try and gain the edge and he does for a couple of moments, but Brown comes back with a swinging neckbreaker and a diving clothesline but the time limit runs out. 3/10.

-3/1990, WCW Power Hour, vs. Keith Hart: Before this Foley says he picked this match to show how even early in his career he could dish out a beating and he did from very early on. He hammered at Keith, stopping any offense he attempted, even pulling Hart up when he had him pinned. Outside he clotheslined Keith over the guardrail, then hit his elbow drop from the ring apron onto Hart and the concrete. Cactus Jack pins Hart for three soon after. 4/10.

-11/1991, WCW Power Hour, Submit or Surrender Match, vs. Sting: Shortly before this Cactus Jack had made his WCW return surprising Sting and attacking him, you can win the match when your opponent submits or can't answer the referee's 10 count. These two always had great matches, Cactus hammered at Sting, while the Stinger displayed his own mean streak and weapons were used by both guys including a trash can. Jack does ground Sting for a while, Sting comes back but does get hit with the elbow drop from the ring apron to the floor. Cactus falls off the ring apron hitting his head on the concrete, Sting locks on the Scorpion Death Lock and the ref calls for the bell cause Cactus is out cold. 8/10. Side Note: Pretty cool moment during Sting's entrance where he talks to a young fan and it shows how good of a guy Sting is.

-1/21/92, Clash of the Champions XVIII, Falls Count Anywhere Match, vs. Van Hammer: This was one out of control brawl, it quickly goes to the outside, they slam each other into the concrete floor, Hammer hits a big slam on the ramp for two. Cactus takes a spill off the stage, Hammer keeps up the offense but Jack won't stay down. The battle rages into the streets outside the arena, even into a pen holding some bulls, Abdullah The Butcher hits Hammer with a shovel on accident and Cactus covers to win. 7/10, Abdullah and Cactus fight it out, with one funny moment coming when Abdullah dunks Missy Hyatt in a water trough.

-5/1995, ECW, Barbed Wire Match, vs. Sandman: Much, much better than the Sandman/Cactus Jack match on Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses DVD, both men try to avoid the barbwire while attempting to inflict pain on the other. There's some good weapon usage in and out of the ring, Cactus takes a hard front suplex into the barbwire much to the crowd's cheering. Sandman does a couple of dives over the top, chokes Jack on the barbwire and both men continue to get torn up in the wire mess. In the end Cactus hits a DDT and covers to win, 7/10.

*-2/17/96, Cyberslam, Shane Douglas vs. Cactus Jack: Starts out fast with Douglas attacking Cactus who was in a shirt and tie which Shane grabs a hold of and throws him around the ring. Weapons get used like a crutch and this really is another wild brawl, Douglas hits a nice dive into the crowd which gets a good reaction. Shane then puts a chair on Cactus' right leg and hits a splash off the second rope, Jack does come back with some hard shots, even hitting an elbow drop driving a table into Douglas. A bit later Shane uses some handcuffs and a chair on Cactus multiple times (in a spot we would see 3 years later between The Rock and Mankind at the Royal Rumble). Cactus calls for Mikey Whipwreck who comes down, but Mikey wacks Jack with the chair and Cactus gets counted down for three. 7/10.

(Available on ECW Unreleased Volume 1)

-5/11/97, In Your House: A Cold Day In Hell, vs. Rocky Maivia: Decent one here as the fans really has turned on Rocky mere months after he debuted, the crowd here was practically sitting on their hands during his entrance. Rocky hits some good moves, even working on the arm of Mankind, however Mankind takes over hitting a nice rolling senton off the ring apron. The action goes outside to the stage and Rocky hits a Rock Bottom on the steel stage, Rocky hits a Shoulder Breaker but Mankind counters a crossbody into the Mandible Claw and Rocky passes out so Mankind wins. 6/10.

-7/6/97, In Your House: Canadian Stampede, vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley w/Chyna: These two had a pretty intense feud in the summer of '97 and this was about Mankind getting revenge on Helmsley for his actions at the King of the Ring the month before. The action does spill outside, even to the stage where Hunter takes a suplex on it, Chyna does make her prescense known even hip tossing Mankind into the ring steps. Helmsley works on the knee with a Figure Four Leg Lock, Mankind keeps fighting back but takes a chair shot from Hunter behind the refs back. They fight into the crowd and are counted out, Chyna even gets in on the action after the bell. 7/10. We see some backstage footage of the brawl continuing even outside the arena, Hunter gets busted open during the brawling.

Disc 2

-9/17/97, Raw, vs. Rocky Maivia: This was shortly after Rocky's turn and joining of the Nation, this was a short and sweet match with Foley in his Dude Love persona. Dude works on the arm, Rock takes over hitting a DDT, then what became later known as The People's Elbow but just for two. After the Double Arm DDT by Dude, the Nation attacks him and Stone Cold hits the ring hitting a Stunner on D'Lo Brown. 4/10, as it was more of a segment.

*-6/28/98, King of the Ring, Hell In A Cell Match, vs. The Undertaker: Without question the most famous cell match in history. Mankind takes a huge fall from the top through the announce table in the first couple of minutes, after some time he comes back up the aisle and climbs the cage, takes a chokeslam through the ceiling of the cage and almost blacks out from the fall and a chair smashing him in the face. Pretty brutal action as there's thumbtacks, blood and a tombstone that puts Mankind down for the 3 count. 10/10. I do like that the post match ovation was included as the crowd cheered big for Foley. I also enjoyed how Jim Ross very obviously broke character after the fall through the cage.

(Available on Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses, OMG The Top 50 Incidents in WWE History, Hell In A Cell Collection and Tombstone: History of the Undertaker)

-7/13/98, Raw, WWE Tag Team Championship Match, w/Kane vs. The New Age Outlaws (Champions) w/Chyna: Just 2 weeks after that barbaric Hell In A Cell match, Mankind is back in the ring with a chance at gold, Undertaker comes to the ring seemingly as an enforcer. The Outlaws work on the shoulder of Mankind. After a few Rock and Owen Hart of the Nation come to ringside, the action breaks down when D'Lo hits the Lo Down on Road Dogg then Kane hits the Tombstone and covers to win the tag titles. 5/10.

-12/13/98, In Your House: Rock Bottom, WWE Championship Match, vs. The Rock (Champion): We get a pre-match segment with Mankind, Rock, Vince and Shane McMahon, where Mankind wants Vince to admit he never heard him say I Quit last month at Survivor Series. When Vince talks the fans start the ""a-hole"" chant, Mankind rips up the contract and Rock tries a blindside attack but Mankind attacks the ribs of the champ. Vince grabs the mic and tells the referee Mankind will be DQ'd if he does anything even close to hardcore or dirty. Rock throws Mankind from the second rope to the floor, Rock then does some trash talking like only he can.

Rock then hits a DDT on a chair on the floor, in the ring is the Corporate Elbow but Mankind kicks out. After Vince tries to get the ref to DQ Mankind he hits the official with a piledriver, after a chair shot by Rock there's a Rock Bottom but no ref. Shane accidentaly hits Rock with the title belt, another ref comes down but just two, the closing minutes are gold as each man goes for the win. Socko comes out and is used, the ref calls for the bell and Mankind is declared the champion. 8/10, until Vince says since Rock didn't tap out he's still the champion, Vince gets Socko for his troubles, Shane uses a chair a couple of times then gets Socko. Rock and the Corporation beat down Mankind in the corner.

-9/2/99, Smackdown, WWE Tag Team Championship Match, w/The Rock (Champions) vs. Triple H & Shane McMahon: Trips and Shane attack Mankind before Rock even comes out, then he hits the ring and we are off and running. Mankind gets beat up for a few by both Trips and Shane, Chyna even interferes hitting a lowblow, Rock finally gets the tag and the pace picks up. Mankind sends Shane into the announce table, Billy Gunn attacks Trips, followed by a People's Elbow from Rock and he covers to win. 5/10.

-12/16/99, Smackdown, Falls Count Anywhere Match, vs. Al Snow: This match was based of Al's jealousy of Mick's friendship with The Rock and how Foley slammed Snow in his ""Have A Nice Day"" book. They battled all over ringside, chairs were used, a metal sheet, a trash can lid, even a bowling ball. The action goes into the backstage area, it ends up with both guys going into the DX dressing room, Al falls out, Mankind stumbles out and covers to win. 6/10. Rock appears and reveals it was his dressing room.

-2/27/00, WWE Championship vs. Career Hell In A Cell Match, vs. Triple H (Champion): After their brutal and great match at the Royal Rumble, these two followed up with a good, hard hitting cell match that saw some brutal spots inside and outside of the cell. Once the action spills to the top, a flaming 2x4 is used and Foley gets backdropped through the cage ceiling and hits the ring almost going through it. Once Triple H gets back into the cell, Cactus starts moving, so Trips hits a pedigree and makes the cover to retain his title and ends Foley's career. 10/10. Like his match against Taker the crowd gives Foley a big ovation as he leaves the arena for the last time.

As far as documentaries go this is one of the best WWE has produced, easily in the Top 10 best ever. Mick has a wealth of knowledge about wrestling and always gives his honest opinions on various things like his rivalires, favorite matches and how he felt about his own place in the business during the different parts of his career. It was very cool to hear from people like Douglas, Funk, Jim Ross, Joey Styles, Vader and many others, but Foley himself told a lot of great stories during the running time of the bio.

The matches are good for the most part, some of the choices are a little questionable, I do wish a match or two with Vader was included since they talked about the rivarly some during the bio. But since this was his definitive career retrospective I can understand having earlier contests along with some rarely seen matches. Sure we've all seen the 2 Hell In A Cell matches countless times before, but they were both very important to Foley's career. The blu-ray extra promos are good and the extra stories are really telling of the kind of man Mick is. It's well worth picking up especially if you're a long time Foley fan.",1366588800,3,19685,4.49076664801343
5529721,5,B00AZL307O,"Let me start with the Blu Ray itself. It arrived from Amazon on its release day (much appreciated Amazon!).The Blu ray itself is packaged inside Mr Socko . Very cool, and original. Might want to snag this limited edition while you can. Im guessing itll be hard to find soon enough.

The set itself? I enjoyed it. The documentary is a little over 2 hours. Mick had a long career, so how ""in depth"" was it? Enough for me.... Mick seems (and always has) like a very sincere person. Listening to his career experience , and various involvements (charity etc) outside the ring was very interesting. The risks he took that ultimately shortened his career are also discussed in depth.

The 2nd disc of matches, and some Blu ray exclusives wasn't a let down for me. Some fans wanted more of ECW , WCW etc, and I understand that. Ill just focus on what was on here. Most , if not all of his classic WWE matches. In blu ray quality! Yes they are in full frame mode , as is the case with anything this old being put on Blu ray. Not a big deal. All my favorites are here from that time ....watching this 2nd disc actually made me wish Foley wasn't the daredevil he was. The Undertaker match alone woulda put most into retirement!

Foley is a legend....whether its Mankind, Dude Love, or Cactus Jack. They are all represented well on this Blu Ray set. Id recommend it to any WWE fan. Definitely the best WWE set Ive watched recently.",1366416000,4,1420,4.391634980988593
5529722,5,B00AZL307O,"Whether he is Cactus Jack, Mankind or Dude Love Mick Foley can always put on a great match with anyone. Mick did a great job digging into the WWE video library and finding great matches from he's early carrer before WWE. Whether its Barbed Wire, Falls County Anyhwere, Submit or Surrender, Hell In A Cell or a Street Fight Mick can always find a way to entertain the fans.",1366416000,,372,4.405797101449275
5529723,5,B00AZL307O,"Being a fan of Mick FOley and appreciating his contributions to the industry, I have been waiting to get this. Finally got a chance to see it and it really made me ""Have A Good Day"" literally.

Disc 1 covers one of the WWE's best produced documentaries on an individual. If you're a fan of wrestling and documentaries, add this to your collection as its the usual in depth documentary you'd expect WWE to do.

Disc 2

*Only covering what I saw.*

Cactus Jack vs. Sting - Submit or Surrender (WCW Power Hour - November 1991)
Being a fan of both guys, I had a feeling I'd like this match and I LOVED it. Only made me wish the silent crow Sting would have gone to WWE to face the deranged Mankind.

Cactus Jack vs. Van Hammer - Falls Count Anywhere Match (Clash of the Champions - January 21, 1992)
Not really sure why I didn't enjoy this one. But it might have been to do with me not knowing the back story to this match, if there was one. I can't get into matches unless I know everything that happened leading up to it.

Mankind vs. Rocky Maivia - IYH: A Cold Day In Hell
Wasn't a bad match. But could have been replaced by their I Quit match at Royal Rumble or Empty Arena match during Halftime Heat.

Mankind vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley - IYH: Canadian Stampede
I did enjoy this. But their match on RAW in Spetember of 97 where HHH fought Cactus Jack at MSG along with their Street Fight at the 2000 Royal Rumble should have been here too.

Disc 3

Mankind vs. Undertaker - Hell In A Cell (King Of The Ring 1998) - Alternate Commentary from Mick Foley and Joey Styles
I felt all of Foley's matches with Rock, HHH, and Taker should have been on this set as they brought the best out of Mick in my opinion. But if there is only one Taker match to have on a Foley set, this is it. Words really cannot do this match justice. Mick became a legend, an icon during this match.

Mankind vs. The Rock - WWE Title (IYH: Rock Bottom)
Great match during a great rivalry. Worth a viewing or two.

Hell In A Cell - Retirement Match
Cactus Jack vs. Triple H - Hell In A Cell with Cactus Jack's career on the line(No Way Out 2000)
Aside from the first two Hell In A Cell matches along with Taker vs Edge and Taker vs HHH, Cactus vs HHH at No Way Out was one hell of a memorable Hell In A Cell. Mick sold his retirement to perfection. And honestly, his ring days perhaps should have ended there.

BLU RAY EXCLUSIVES

Cutting Edge - 08/01/08
Mick said he wanted to leave WWE on a high note and he did just that. Great segment.

Relevancy with CM Punk - 09/24/12
One of Mick's best promos. ""Do you wanna become a statistic or a legend?!!!"" One of the best lines in a promo, ever.

What follows is a series of stories told. They were all unique in their own way. But I opted not to watch them all. SO only sharing my thoughts with the ones I saw.

Frank Foley

Snowed In

DeNucci Training School

Arrested in Italy?

Cactus Jack - The Name

Africa

Birth of Bang Bang

Losing Teeth

On the Spot

Wanted T-Shirt

Smoking Flight?

Anti-Hardcore ECW

Farewell in ECW

Vicious Suplex

Kevin Sullivan - Mentor

Rock `n Sock Jacket

Disneyland - OMG! I NEVER EVER though HHH would get as much laughter out of me as he did here! If you are in serious need of humor, WATCH THIS! HHH will really bring it out of you!

Loogie Heard `Round the World

Commentator - I always wished Mick remained with WWE as a commentator thinking he would have grown into it. Hope he gets that gig again although I am sure because of his past experience, he'd decline the chance to return to the role.

Mr. Socko vs. The Cobra

Comedy Show - Showed me a how good Mick is at performing stand-up. I might have to see one of his shows.

Favourite Mick Foley Persona - For me, its a tie between Cactus and Mankind. I can see why Cactus is most popular though among many.

Sheamus Meets Mick

Christmas Cheer

Wardrobe

Thrifty Mick - Funny story. As funny as the story was, Mick was also being very smart here as Big Show pointed out. HHH really brought the laughter out of me.

Great Dad

All in all, great set. It was what I expected - documentary being the main selling point with believing match selection should be left up to Mick ans the fans only since it
s Mick set and the fans are gonna be the ones who are buying it.",1366329600,,4276,4.188725490196078

8559644,5,B00AZL307O,"This is a good set for any Foley fan. BUT, I was extremely annoyed that the WWF Championship match: Mankind vs. the Rock (1999 on Raw) wasn't on the set. Not only was that match epic and a win for Mankind, but it was also historical because it was the loudest pop in wrestling history. Why the hell wasn't it on there? (Note: it isn't on The Rock collection either!) Aside from that, great collection. Worth the money.",1512864000,,418,4.371794871794871
