8532035,5,B008XAYSZW,Loved it!! It's about creating optimum nutrition from the bounty of vegetables and nuts. I bought the video because I saw the amazing results from the clients I referred to her.,1417132800,2,177,4.741935483870968
8532036,5,B008XAYSZW,My Acupuncturist shared this video with me years ago. It is amazingly right on when it comes to healthy lifestyle and healing. I was not ready to commit to the changes 8 years ago. I keep going back to the video to remind myself of what is in my highest and best interest. I now see a large movement into 70% raw food and other eating styles. Her DVD is leaps and bounds beyond any fad diet and has clear and useful information. I have chronic health challenges which were making me quite tired feeling. I went to this way of eating and 10 days later I am now full of energy and feel ALIVE. Many thanks to Dale for her wisdom and desire to share this information.,1352246400,5,663,4.1875
