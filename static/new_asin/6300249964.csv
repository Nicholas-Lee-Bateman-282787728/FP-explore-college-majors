273569,5,6300249964,"This movie examines fatherhood from many angles, and how a male progresses from boy to man to father--and how some fail to progress. ""Father"" is examined in many aspects: the benign father, the  angry (and terrifying) father, the aged father. Wonderful comedy and  thoughtful move.",914371200,4,281,5.222222222222222
273570,5,6300249964,"This movie is much more than an outrageous and unique comedy.  One reason for its cult following has been consistently missed by the critics: repeated viewings reveal surprising layers of meaning and an intricate web  of symbolism.
At the heart of this film is the timeless debate known as  ""nature vs. nurture"": are we more a product of our genes, or of  our environment?  How much of an effect does our upbringing have on our  likelihood to turn out as either a law-abiding member of society (a society  which in this movie is of dubious merit, as represented by Hi's job and his  unctuous boss) or as a criminal deviant from its norms?
The symbolism in  this film is rich and evocative--while always contributing to the comedy.  Note how often the adult characters cry and carry on like infants.  Note  the way the escaped convicts are ""born"" into the outside world.  Note the marriage of a convict and a police officer, and the difference in  their families visible in the brief wedding shot.  Note the juxtaposition  of milk poured over cereal with the infant's feeding bottle, as Evelle  observes, ""Ya don't breast feed him, he'll hate you for it later.  That's why we wound up in prison.""  And note the frequent use of  phrases such as ""that's natural,"" as opposed to ""you're not  being true to your nature"" or ""mother didn't love me.""  As  Hi observes, ""maybe it's my upbringing, maybe it's just that my genes  got screwed up, I don't know.""
The quasi-biblical, poetical and  aphorism-laden language the characters use in the-state-adjacent-to-Utah is  both touching and funny.  Every word of the film is a finely polished gem.  Ed's little plan is ""the solution to all our problems, and the answer  to all our prayers.""  Her infertile womb is a ""rocky place where  my seed can find no purchase.""  And as Hi later writes in a touching  letter to his dearest Edwina, ""I feel the thunder gathering even  now...I cannot tarry...better I should go, send you money, and let you  curse my name.""  On the other hand, the crotchety Arizona characters  also have a remarkable literalness of expression.  A packet of balloons  does not blow up into funny shapes, not ""unless round is funny.""  And as the old codger in the bank robbery points out, ""If I freeze, I  can't rightly drop, and if I drop, I'm gonna be in motion!""
Even the  music in this film is perfectly executed, from the hilarious yodeling and  whistling of the main theme to the way the chilling accompaniment of a  nightmare is later revealed to be a haunting children's nursery song, and  then mutates into an ethereal melody in the film's final scenes.  The  characters, despite their flaws, are all surprisingly sympathetic.  And the  film is tightly constructed, without a single unnecessary scene or moment.  It ends with a bang, not a whimper, its final words resonating with  significance and yet leaving one wanting more, like a swift exit after a  great punch line.
At the deepest core of this film lies a mystery wrapped  in an enigma: who is the once-orphaned ""motorcycle demon from  hell,"" and what is his relation to Herbert I. McDonnough?  The answer  to this puzzle relates intimately to the ""nature vs. nurture""  theme.  While I think I know the answer, I'll leave it for you to figure  out, based on the clues (""show the tattoo!"") liberally scattered  throughout the film.  ""Okay then!""",912384000,95,3367,4.751304347826087

273758,3,6300249964,I love this movie.  Everything about it is funny.  From Nicolas Cage playing a convict facing the parole board.  Marrying police officer Holly Hunter.  They play a couple who cant have children.  They decide to kidnap one from a couple who had quintuplets.  They figured that couple had more then they could handle.  There are car chases.  Double crosses.  A lot of thing that you wouldn't expect in a movie like this. Easily Nicolas Cage's best early movie.  It just so happened that I watched The Light Between Oceans last night.

273948,5,6300249964,"This is the first Coen bros. movie I ever saw, and it's hard to express the impact it had. It was one of those experiences in a movie theater that was so fresh, so unexpected, so over the top that I could hardly believe what I was seeing. It was so new and so perfectly done in its own outrageous terms. And that applies to everything about it--the script, the bigger-than life acting, the Biblical language, the visuals like the chase across the yard into the house that was so berserk I nearly fell out of my seat with delight. But three things to follow on that. First, one has seen a lot of Coen bros since then, and the boggling originality of this one has lapsed into a familiar place, Coen-land. Second, this is a comedy, but it doesn't move like traditional comedy (well, maybe like traditional farce sometimes). Their earlier Blood Simple is a bloody crime story but it's full of laughs--some that stick in your throat, such as the baddie buried alive. I think all this flowers in Fargo, which is a particularly violent and crazed abduction story at which you're laughing steadily, though perhaps shocked that you are. That's what the Coens do. Finally, the times I've seen RA on a TV screen since the first time in a theater have only shown how this needs to be seen on the big screen, or the biggest possible. Visually it's too big for a small screen, which dilutes its impact. (In fact the same can be said for most great movies.) I'm going to watch it on my new huge HDTV and I'm hoping for the best. Man, Nicholas Cage was so much more interesting then. He's at his best playing more or less pathetic yet likable schlemiels.",1492387200,,1638,4.445182724252492

274002,5,6300249964,"I knew this was going to be a good movie within the first minute of the opening scene. It's the only comedy I've sat through in which I actually laughed out loud - a solid belt of laughter - within the first 30 seconds. Comedies don't normally do that to me. They normally wait a while. They build up to the big joke, and it's not always even that funny.

Raising Arizona began on a good note for me. Towards the middle, I was beginning to think it would wind up in a less-happy way, and admittedly I felt a little disappointed. But the movie really is touching, and the ending is fabulous! It makes up for the doubts you'll have, if any.

Nicholas Cage, who I'm not actually a great fan of, does a superb job - as does Holly Hunter. (She was also great in ""O' Brother Where Art Thou""). I really think they played their parts well.

I would definitely recommend this film to you. It has a little bit of a ""Married With Children"" sort of tone to it, but the jokes are intelligent and witty. It'll sometimes catch you off guard with a really funny scene and you'll really laugh out loud! I love movies like that!

I like a comedy who doesn't feel it has to continually make you laugh, like ""Scary Movie"" does or ""American Pie."" They're good those films, but it's almost like they can't pause to tell you a story. They have to try and force-feed you jokes all the time. And that's the difference between those types of comedies and this one. Raising Arizona tells you a story. And makes you laugh a whole lot along the way.

Don't worry if when you're watching it you start to think it's going down a certain path, because it changes. And it ends up in a really good place...",1484179200,,1672,4.261829652996846

274162,5,6300249964,"This 1987 film gives us a young Nicholas Cage and thinner John Goodman than we're used to seeing, and is quite a fun film.  It is a film having fun with itself and of course has quite a few unrealistic scenes.  If your familiar with later Coen Brothers films you can see their style developing in scenes in Raising Arizona, which was their first film.  This is dark and has taboo subject scenes but not to the extent of later movies.  It's just a fun film, about a guy who keeps going to back to prison who somehow forms a relationship with the cop who takes his mug shot pictures.  They marry but can't have kids, so decide to take on of the five babies born to an unpainted furniture tycoon.

I thought this might have more of a couple of not to bright adults having to raise with issues with a baby they as unfamiliar parents, but it is more on a couple of equally dimwitted escaped prisoners (one is Goodman), and a bounty hunter who appeared to Cage's in a dream but is all too real.  Still it's a fun film.",1468022400,,1012,4.212435233160622
274163,5,6300249964,"This was my first Cohen Brothers movie. I can't believe it was so poorly received when it came out. By the end of the hysterical prison opening scene, the four other people in the theater that night had moved away as I was laughing so hard! And I became a die hard fan. I have owned the VHS and DVD. I concur with other reviewers. This movie never stops being funny. Every actor, line and facet of this movie is a polished gem and the story is an enigma within an puzzle. It also has my favorite chase scene of all time. I still see Whitey and his gun in my dreams. I love dropping a favorite line at a gathering or party.

274201,5,6300249964,"How can you not love Raising Arizona? It was the Coen brothers first comedy, and it's hilarious if you enjoy their brand of dry, dark humor. It has Nicolas Cage acting as a redneck halfwit, and he nails the role perfectly. Jason Lee seemed to be channeling this character directly on his show My Name Is Earl. Holly Hunter co-stars as his cop wife and gets almost as many laughs as he does. John Goodman has a truly memorable supporting role from early in his career. This is such a twisted comedy, with Cage, a repeat offender, and Hunter, a police officer, trying to establish a stable family life after stealing a baby from a millionaire. What a premise, right? This is one of the most fun movies I've ever seen, and it never gets old. I recently saw the DVD on Amazon for five bucks, and the nostalgia trip alone was worth that. But this is a great movie, so for anyone who hasn't seen it and is thinking about getting it, if any part of my description appeals to you, you surely won't be disappointed.

However, I had to make an exception in this case since this movie isn't available for streaming at the moment, and when it is it cost as much to stream as it does to buy a copy. ""There's what's right, and there's what's right, and never the twain shall meet."". Ed Jr. would approve.

274599,5,6300249964,"This is simply put...an excellent film.  It is well made, creatively conceived, smartly constructed and directed, and quite wry, witty, and amusing.  It is NOT a film for everyone.  The story line is perhaps too dark or edgy for some people's tastes, I would imagine.  The story is about a convict who hooks up and marry an officer; since they can't have any children of their own, they wind up taking a dark turn and stealing an infant from someone who just had 5 babies at once.  That's the story, no spoilers there.  The story progresses absurdly, and many would find it ridiculous, unreal, and just not much to it.  To anyone who likes HOW a film is made, though, it is a spectacular film.  To people who like films that make you FEEL and THINK a bit, it is a curious film that will delight.  To people who like DARK stories that tell something beyond the surface, they, too, should like this film.  VERY funny story.  GREAT characters portrayed.  VERY entertaining, AND a real pleasure to watch!  The brothers who directed this film have sustained themselves creatively speaking over many fine films, and this one should NOT let any Cohen Bothers fans down!  There is so much more beyond the superficial premise of the story that touches on humanity's core, if you look a bit.  Enjoy!",1433203200,4,1289,4.616740088105727

274725,4,6300249964,"If the Coen brothers' first movie, ""Blood Simple,"" was the earliest example of their brand of nail-biting but thrillingly imaginative violence, ""Raising Arizona"" is the first full realization of their knack for wordplay. Several of their later works, notable ""Fargo,"" would blend the two components in more or less equal measure, but here the dialect and dialogue are front and center. The supporting character played by Frances McDormand uses an imperative tone, with eyebrows raised in pre-judgment, to ask new mother Holly Hunter about the baby's future matriculation: ""You are going to send him to Arizona State."" She is not an exaggeration; the question marks her as a type familiar to anyone raised near the clannish land-grant colleges of the south and southwest.

Though this line is sufficiently believable, and though McDormand and Hunter prove their command of accents (not for the last time), there is of course a great deal of affectation in the way the Coens' characters speak. Yet it is not correct to say that the archaic poesy the Coens put in the mouths of countrified people is a pretension or a ridiculous jest. When Nicholas Cage's character substitutes ""slumber"" for ""sleep,"" ""ether"" for ""air,"" and ""twain"" for ""two,"" he is speaking in a way folk really spoke once upon a time. His letter to his wife reads almost like a letter home from a Civil War soldier. There is a great deal of ridiculousness in ""Raising Arizona,"" all of it intentional and some instances of it more successful than others, but the emotions of the characters and the language they use to express them are as heartfelt as they are playful.

Some critics have accused the Coens of punching down with their humor, but in ""Raising Arizona"" all of the comedy is the kind that puts the audience on the side of the desperate and downtrodden. The ""hayseeds"" in the local grange easily out-argue a pair of robbers (who are themselves sympathetic enough, in their turn). The only really dislikable person in the film is a relatively well-off factory manager, and it is he, not the man who lives in a trailer park, who shows himself to be a racist and a degenerate.

Coen brothers films are not known for social commentary, but ""Raising Arizona"" contains some light critique of society's treatment of individuals with convictions on their records. Nobody in the movie believes that prisons exist to rehabilitate people. A frequent offender opines in a marvelous opening monologue and montage that their purpose must be revenge. At the other end of the movie, the victim of the central crime bookends this idea by declining to press charges since ""there's no harm done.""

What doesn't work as well as the Coens' crackling script and characters are their action sequences. The editing is a little rough, which is understandable since much of the drama involves a live baby whom the director cannot actually put in harm's way. The introduction of a motorcycle-riding, grenade-tossing villain is funny at first, but when he starts talking (through a voice-stifling fake nose for some reason) he loses much of his appeal. Holly Hunter carries herself well as a twice-decorated police officer, a presentiment perhaps of Marge Gunderson in ""Fargo,"" but she is given too little to do in the final set piece.

""Raising Arizona"" is a very good movie in its own right, but in comparison to the Coens' later masterpieces it can also be viewed as a working out of principles and patterns that would take several more years to come to their fullest fruition.",1423094400,,3528,4.922689075630252

Roger Ebert is usually highly perceptive, but his negative review of this film is beyond understanding. He says it has ""a forced and mannered style"". Well, of course it does. It's stylistically appropriate for this sort of material.

Apparently Mr Ebert was so busy reviewing films that he never bothered reading books. One of the things that makes ""Raising Arizona"" so wonderful is that the Coens have perfectly captured the forced and mannered style of crazy comic novels.

I have to say something about the superb BD transfer -- NO grain reduction, NO edge enhancement.

There was nothing like it before and nothing like it since because quite frankly the Coens do not repeat themselves.

This film combines some off-elegant, poetic dialogue juxtaposed with zany comedy theatrics.  However, the overall impact of the comedy is moderate at best.  Some of the irreverence hits home, but a lot has worn rather tritely.  The motiffs praised by some as insightful are rather superficial, providing only a mesotrophic layer of insight.  The cheesy furnitures salesman and the B.O. challenged biker were cute though wore-out their welcome.  For me, the Coen's are creative without breaking through.",1263254400,2,642,5.057142857142857
275430,5,6300249964,"I've said this before, and I'll say it again; The Coen Brothers are really a `love em or hate em' kind of duo.  Their films are really distinctive all to themselves and run the gamut of over-the-top in a good and a bad way.  As the years go by and I see more and more of their films I am coming to the realization that my personal love for them outweighs my hate.  In fact, there are only two films they've done that I can think of off the top of my head that I hate (`Intolerable Cruelty' and `The Man Who Wasn't There') and a slew of films that I absolutely love (`Fargo', `Miller's Crossing', `Blood Simple').

That said; `Raising Arizona' may very well be my FAVORITE Coen film!

That may be a pretty bold statement, and quite honestly it may not be entirely accurate (notice I said `may very well be') since I am a huge lover of all things `Fargo' and `Miller's Crossing', but the fact of the matter is that `Raising Arizona' is the Coen's at their finest.  It is absolutely hilarious, completely engrossing and it capitalizes off the brother's stylistic incorporation of political humor, dark undercurrents and simple yet uproarious character development.

It is a complete package.

So, I'll be clear and state, as I did in my title, that stealing babies is not funny, at least not when it's showcased on an episode of `Snapped' (OMG did you see that episode?!?!?!), but it is rather hilarious when the crime is committed by Nicolas Cage (in one of his best performances) and the hilarious and totally brilliant Holly Hunter.  As love-struck police officer Edwina, Hunter is deadpan brilliance here.  Edwina falls for professional (and rather dimwitted) bandit H.I. (call him Hi) when she's booking him.  Next thing you know they are married and wanting to start a family.  The only problem is that Edwina is infertile.  So, instead of thinking of a rational alternative (been there, and rational is not where your head automatically goes) they decide to kidnap one of the highly publicized Arizona babies.

Big mistake.

If you follow my reviews you know that I am not a huge fan of Nicolas Cage.  He is a conundrum for me, because when he is good he is REALLY good (look at his marvelous performances in `Adaptation' and `Leaving Las Vegas') but all too often he is just so one-note that I struggle to connect with him.  Thankfully he loosens up drastically here and delivers a sharp and hilarious comedic performance.  He is matched (and even topped) but the marvelous Hunter, who is comedic gold here.  She manages to capture the real maternal instincts without ever overly sympathizing her character's comedic arc.  She is supposed to be over-the-top and irrational, and she never loses that.

Supporting players like John Goodman and Frances McDormand are stellar (just STELLAR), but for me it is Trey Wilson who blows them all away with his take on Nathan Arizona, the vengeful father.  He is a perfect blend of sarcasm, wit, ferocity and (oddly enough) charm.  It's the perfect support to the crazed lead performers.

From start to finish this is one fun, entertaining and rewarding ride that just further proves the fact that these brothers (Coen's that is) know how to make a unique and engaging film!",1258416000,3,3218,4.725806451612903

275432,5,6300249964,"Young people cannot resist. they have to get married, then they have to have babies, then they have to have all that comes along with these enslaving devices called children. The Coen brothers are of course inventing a situation that is so complex that building a frame house on Mars would look easier. The man has been in and out of prison so often that he hardly knows what non-criminal living is. He has fallen in love with the cop that has been taking his police pictures every single time. But let's be more bleak (I would like to say more bleaker  la Michael Jackson) than that. She is sterile. And a dumb furniture dealer named Arizona has quintuplets exactly at the same time. So the man will steal one of the five babies, since the Arizonas are over-provided and he is under-provided, in fact deprived. Add to that a married couple whose husband is sterile and who have adopted five kids. they propose a swap for fun and love. No way. Bang Bang. Add to that the arrival of two apes who have just escaped from the prison by digging a hole and who come to their ex-inmate-friend to survive for a while away from the cops. And then the drama is total. The kidnapped child is kidnapped by the two prison escapees when they are told to beat it, and then by the motor-cycled bounty hunter who is running after the reward for the kidnapped baby when he gets on their back, and then back by the initial kidnappers, and then finally, what can they do with that child? A little bit of suspense for your own sake. Only the Coen brothers can invent such a bleak and sickening story. It is not hilarious, except if you like sick and sickening humor, but it is somewhere deep about the incapability of society to really provide everyone with a fair chance to do something worth living, and first of all a vision of life that could be better than the hell of an unavoidable purgatory from which there is no exit, escape or way out, a purgatory in which you are forever pampered with infantile childish punishing nappies in the shape of diapers.

275435,5,6300249964,"The Coen brothers are not known for monotony. Each film in their repertoire is different to the other. They can do action and comedy equally well as separate projects, but in Raising Arizona, they combine the two to good effect. The storyline is not very complex - Nicholas Cage (H.I.) and Holly Hunter (Ed) find that they cannot have a baby by natural means and conspire to kidnap one of the quintuplets (Nathan Junior) of the richest man in town, Nathan of Unpainted Arizona furniture stores fame. The only problem is that H.I.'s past as a convenience store bandit comes back to haunt him in the form of two of his colleagues from prison who want him to take part in one last `job'.  This is crazy enough, but you also get a crazed bounty hunter on a motorcycle.
There are plenty of laughs on the way as everything doesn't exactly go to plan. There are some genuinely sad moments too. The Coens even give us a dose of action here and there to keep the momentum going. At the end of the day, everything works well to keep the viewer entertained for around 90 minutes.
Nic Cage looks young, thin and different in this film. It reminds us that he can do comedy well although he has become an action star. Holly Hunter too gives a superb performance.  Nathan Junior the baby is simply gorgeous, though I do not whether any CGI effects had been used for some of the sequences involving the five babies. Cage and Hunter have not been paired again as far as I know. The (mainly outdoor) photography is also excellent.

The narration of Nicholas Cage needs a MAJOR upgrade - I just couldn't wait until he finished his final one so I could ""shut it down"".

No Country for Old Men, I think.

I liked a lot about this...Nicholas Cage is wonderful and Holly Hunter is too.  The story...well, it seemed like they might have written it as they went along.  It was mostly an excuse to make a film, I think.  There are some genuinely funny moments and I laughed out loud quite a few times, mostly in the beginning.  It seems like they started this film with some good ideas and then they ran out and had to figure a way to tie it all together.  Not a very satisfactory ending, but better than having everyone bleed to death, which one could well expect from the them.

I don't know what the male equivalent for ""chick flix"" would be....""guy films?""  Lots of fights, none of which are mildly funny to me, but then I'm not a guy.  I keep thinking that the Coens need to be psychoanalyzed and then maybe they'll iron out the kinks in their wierd  shared psyche and make some really good films.  One can hope.

The wacky characters and outrageous story, of course, are the attractions here but I also enjoyed the low camera angles employed here by the directors, the Coen brothers, and I've always enjoyed Nicholas Cage's strange dialog in the narration.

Everyone in this film - everyone but the little babies - are totally insane, beginning with the lead people, the husband-and-wife team played by Cage and Holly Hunter. I got most of my laughs, however, from the supporting cast of John Goodman and Bill Forysthe as escaped convicts, Trey Wilson as the father of the quints and Randall ""Tex"" Cobb as ""Leonard Smalls."" For a pro boxer, Cobb turned out to be a pretty good actor.

275461,4,6300249964,"Comedies don't normally age well because there are only so many times you can hear a joke without getting sick of it and so films of that ilk normally represent sort of a time capsule of what the key events and issues of the time were that concerned people and hence what was funny to them at that time.  For those of us that are not of that time dated jokes leave us asking ""huh?"".

Once in a while though, we get the exception that still manages to retain its humour despite the years and just like that other sleeper and underappreciated gem ""Cat Ballou"", ""Raising Arizona"" is one heck of a great film.  The scriptwriting is first class and the theme of a desperate couple feeling the anguish of not being able to have children is timeless making this comedy relevant for all times unlike the vast majority of comedies that are out there.  ""Tootsie"" has been ranked by AFI as the funniest comedy of all time and I did think so myself when I first watched it many years ago but when I revisited it recently, I had to say ""huh?""  I guess men in drag has become so common these days that the film has become a dated time capsule of the early 80s while I still thoroughly enjoyed ""Raising Arizona"" and I think it's much funnier than anything that is currently listed on the AFI top 10 list.  By the way, ""This is Spinal Tap"" is another film that should be on the top ten list but is inexplicably not there.

What makes is film work though in addition to the brilliant script and direction is the great cast.  Holly Hunter was excellent and John Goodman, Nicolas Cage and the rest are not far behind in terms of great acting.

This dvd version is also very good in that both the picture and sound quality is very good despite not being restored.  There are no special features to speak about though like interviews or making-of documentaries which is the only downer for this very entertaining and enjoyable film.

Their attempt to have a child is thwarted by her infertility and his criminal history.

275463,4,6300249964,"RAISING ARIZONA has never been my favorite Coen film, but I recently re-watched it, and with an unusual sense of obligation (for me) took in the special features,read all the notes, researched it a bit online--and found myself developing a budding affection for the film.  In fact, I found myself wondering why I had had such an active dislike for the flick in the first place.

Now I want to see it again.

The thing about shaggy dog stories is that you have to be in the mood for them.  Absurdities can seem a little precious and kind of irritating if you're in the wrong frame of mind.  As the Amazon man (above) says, some people will find this movie this movie utterly ""original"" and captivating, and others will find it ""over the top.""  And some will keep changing their minds, depending on whether their lumbago is bothering them or something.

I think maybe I wanted the Holly Hunter character to be a little more grounded, you know maybe like Marge in FARGO.  Her ""Ed"" seems like she should be Nicolas Cage's ""Hi's"" rock, until you realize that her baby hunger has gotten her as far off HER rocker as her oft-wayward hubby.  Once you accept HER craziness as an essential part of the plot--once you realize that the women are just as loopy as the men--well, you can sit back and enjoy this ride through LaLa Land.

It occurs to me now that the Coen's essentially cast Hunter in a similar role in OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? (albeit her character is considerably more fecund in that film).  In the later film, she also exerts a certain womanly power and influence over her similarly wayward hubby.  And she can be just as stubborn...and as stubbornly crazy. The Coen's obviously see something in Hunter that they don't mind tapping into whenever it's called for.

Which is true of their casting decisions in general.  Nic Cage has not been one of the Coens' recurring castmembers (as it turns out--although never say never), but his H.I. McDunnough evokes other comic parts (often as a hapless, good hearted loser)that he's done masterfully throughout his career (and the fact that many of these came AFTER ARIZONA suggests that the Coens were actually pretty prescient in their casting of him in this 1987 black comedy.

(In fact, if you look at his resume, you might note that back in the 80s,  most of his successes were COMEDIES.  The action-adventure stuff, that seems to have brought him his biggest commercial successes, came later.)

I've been running my own little Coen Brothers film festival of late, and it's been a process of discovery.  I always knew I liked them, but I didn't quite realize how much--or why.  Re-watching ARIZONA, there were only one or two scenes that I was actually bothered by; the chase scene with the snarling dogs was one of them.  I can't say for sure, but I suspect that when I watch it again, I'll start to see it as an integral part of the film and not comprehend why I didn't ""get it"" before.  Or maybe not--you're not going to embrace every move your favorite filmmakers make--but you do start to see how it all fits together.

275476,5,6300249964,"The Coen Brothers' Oscar-winning triumph for ""No Country for Old Men"" seemed to me as much recognition of two decades of excellent, if quirky, filmmaking as it was celebration of that specific film masterpiece. Their films defy categorization, although I think it is safe to say that most of the films lean more towards ""comedy"" or ""drama"".  One of their trademarks is adding humor to their dramas, and few comedies come with darker moments than theirs.  For me, ""Raising Arizona"" represents their best and most outrageous comedy, and since their list of comedies includes ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""Burn After Reading"", that's saying something.

Nicolas Cage leads as a dim but good-hearted small time convenience store robber named H.I. McDunnough.  Holly Hunter plays Edwina, a policewoman who meets H.I. over and over again, taking the booking photographs and fingerprints of repeat offender H.I. in the brilliant prologue.

Robber H.I. and cop Ed marry and set up homestead in a trailer ""on the outskirts of Tempe"" (when establishing shots show they are out in the western desert, far from any sign of civilization.)  But Edwina's insides are ""a rocky place"" where H.I.'s ""seed could find no purchase"" so they are left childless.

While Ed is going through the heartbreak of infertility quintuplets are born to the King of Unfinished Furniture, Nathan Arizona, and his wife Florence. Trey Wilson gives an absolutely brilliant performance as the blustering, tough-talking furniture man.

In a stretch of logic common in Coen movies, H.I. and Ed decide that the Arizonas have more offspring than they need or can handle, so since they are childless it is acceptable to take one of them.

The rest of the film deals more or less with Hi and Ed's attempts to achieve domestic tranquility with little Nathan, Junior, while a manhunt is initiated to recover the high-profile infant.

Along the way we meet a pair of brothers, Hi's friends from prison, and recently broken out of said prison in a scene that is both hilarious and epic at the same time.  This was the first film role that I remember seeing John Goodman, and he is a presence as Gale Snoats.  Brother Evelle is played by an early William Forsyth, who tells Edwina that they haven't broken out of prison, they've ""released themselves on their own recognizance.""  Goodman adds ""we felt that the institution no longer had anything to offer us.""

Former boxer Randall ""Tex"" Cobb adds a surreal touch as a shotgun-toting, harley-riding, cigar-smoking, rabbit hand-grenading, post-apocalyptic bounty hunter, Leonard Smalls, who offers to recover Nathan Junior for the Arizonas, but only for twice the $25,000 reward.  Smalls, who is later called a ""Warthog from Hell"" by Edwina, is after all only a capitalist and he informs Nathan Arizona that he knows plenty of people willing to pay more than $25,000 for a healthy baby.  You don't doubt that he does.

The soundtrack is Coen Brothers perfect and features a flailed banjo which is accompanied by yodeling and occasionally breaks into Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"".  Did I mention their movies are quirky?

It would be difficult to say which is quirkier, the Coen's hilariously surreal dialogue or the unbelievable plot, but both are part of the joy of this film.

H.I.'s boss Glenn (played by Sam McMurray) and Glenn's wife Dot (played by Academy Award winner Frances McDormand, Mrs. Joel Coen) show up so that Dot can work Edwina into a maternal frenzy over little Junior and whether or not he has been vaccinated with his Dip-Tet.  Glenn meanwhile suggests wife-swapping to H.I. who responds by cold-cocking Glenn.  Glenn fires H.I. who is tempted to return to his previous life of crime.

Later the Snoats brothers bust in on a hayseed bank and order everyone to ""freeze"" and ""get down on the ground"".  All of the people raise their hands and turn silently towards the shot-gun wielding brothers. An old-timer asks ""Well, which is it, young feller? You want I should freeze or get down on the ground? Mean to say, if'n I freeze, I can't rightly drop. And if'n I drop, I'm a-gonna be in motion. You see...""

In fact, I never realized that this fun movie was actually Raising Arizona, as it was always one of those movies I just happen to catch on cable dozens of times, never in the beginning. As I watched it this time, probably the first time in ten years, it all came back to me. Just as an old video game, in all its levels and enemies, comes to you if you were to play it now, I must have said, ""Oh yeah!"" in my brain about 20 times.

Though, filled with 70's and 80's colors, this movie somehow leaves you with an impression of rather vibrant colors, no doubt the handy work of Barry Sonnenfeld.  The scene where John Goodman and William Forsythe are bombed by blue paint in the car, not to mention there scenes screaming as they escape prison and screaming as they realize that they have forgotten the baby. The color of the Arizona Family's nursery also echo's in the brain after the movie is long over.

The acting, well, your so tied up in the whole situation, that this does not even cross your mind.  And so I believe it's safe to say, all the actors did a terrific job, though Cage and Goodman stood out for no other reason than, it was simply the nature of their characters.

The yodeling/folk music is perfect, though I had a flashback of watching the end scene as a child, where Cage's character is dreaming.  Though the mood is serene and he is dreaming of his future and everything is perfect, I felt as a child as I do now, that the music is slightly creepy and scary. I was also slightly afraid of Randall ""Tex"" Cobb, but now his character simply becomes such a great part of the movie comedically.",1204761600,,2281,4.835897435897436

275511,5,6300249964,"""Raising Arizona"" is a gem from the 80's made by the oddball Coen brothers who definitely do not have any particular style of filmmaking. Who would think that the makers of something as dark as ""Blood Simple"" could make such a screwball comedy as this? Raising Arizona has a unique style of comedy that doesn't appeal to everyone, particularly if you have no knowledge of the ways and people of the American southwest, since the film is full of thoughts and lines that hilariously exaggerate the customs of the area. For example, after kidnapping an old man at gunpoint, taking him on a wild ride while running from the police after a robbery gone bad, and then falling through the front windshield onto someone's front lawn, the main character takes the time to say ""much obliged"" to the old man before continuing his wild run from the police. Manners are still important in the Southwest, even to a felon on the run.

As the film begins, we see what appears to be a different kind of love story. Convenience store robber H.I.  (Nicholas Cage) falls in love with a beautiful deputy, Ed (Holly Hunter), who continually takes his mug shot each time he returns to prison. Once married, H.I. promises to stay out of trouble for Ed and they decide to start a family. Unfortunately, they discover Ed is ""barren"" and unable to have a child. They try adoption, but H.I.'s past felonies raise a red flag at adoption agencies, prompting H.I to note that ""nature and the prejudices of others had conspired to keep us childless"". It just so happens at the same time the wife of rich businessman Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson) gives birth to a set of quintuplets. Ed comes to the conclusion that the Arizona family has ""more than they can handle"" with their new children and decides to kidnap one of the babies, with the help of her husband. And this is all before the opening credits.

Things become even more complicated when two of H.I's prison buddies break out of jail and decide to stay at his place until they can come up with a plan that will be the start of ""a crime spree that will encompass all of the Southwest proper - or we'll get caught - either way we're set for life."" They invite H.I. to join them admonishing him that they know he's ""partial to convenience stores, but the sun don't rise and set on the corner grocer"". Note that one of the escaped felons is played by John Goodman. If you haven't seen this film since it first came out in 1987 you might have forgotten this, since this is one of his early pre-Roseanne film roles. Eventually Ed and H.I. come to their senses and return the baby, and we get the impression from the conclusion that someday in the future Ed and H.I. will have children of their own.

This film is full of sight gags and inside jokes that you have to watch carefully to get. For example, Nathan Arizona's commercials for his Unpainted Arizona furniture stores have a tagline of guaranteeing his merchandise is the best and cheapest ""or my name isn't Nathan Arizona"". As it turns out, we find out his name isn't Nathan Arizona, it is Nathan Huffhines. He changed it because ""would you buy an unpainted dinette set from a place called Unpainted Huffhines?"". This movie is a light comic piece. Don't let some of the Coens' other darker works dissuade you from seeing this film - there isn't a dark moment in the entire thing.",1169337600,5,3357,4.552980132450331

The basic story involves an ex-con and his wife who's a cop.  They kidnap an infant from a set of quintuplets.  The deadpan narration teamed up with Nicholas Cage's hapless expression and disarranged hair is the perfect foil for all the mayhem, car chases, robberies, as the infant is kidnapped again and again by a zany cast of characters.

Sure other movies have incompetent bank robbers, dogs chasing criminals, and lovable babies, but this one puts them all together with Nicholas Cage for a comedy classic.",1168646400,5,757,4.456521739130435

In terms of cheerful stories, witty dialog and the creation of a coherent, plausible fantasy world peopled by vivid characters, their ability to work original and entertaining variations on a genre indicates well for the future...

Opening with a brilliant pre-credits monologue, ""Raising Arizona"" tells of an incompetent, compulsive petty criminal's love for his prison warder: married but infertile, the couple kidnap a baby, whose tycoon father hires a crazed biker to find and kill the culprits... A surreal, slapstick satire, it takes intense pleasure in exciting plotting, showy and cheap colors, and hilarious screwball characters...",1168473600,2,760,5.551724137931035
275514,5,6300249964,"While The Big Lebowski (1998) is probably my favorite Coen Brothers film, Raising Arizona (1987) is a very close 2nd.  Written and directed by the Coen Brothers (Miller's Crossing, Fargo, O Brother, Where Art Thou?), the film stars Nicolas Cage (Wild at Heart, Ghost Rider) and Holly Hunter (The Piano, O Brother, Where Art Thou?), in her first starring feature film role, a part written specifically with her in mind (apparently Kevin Costner was first offered Cage's role, but turned it down).  Also appearing is Trey Wilson (Twins), John Goodman (The Big Lebowski), William Forsythe (Out for Justice), Sam McMurray (Addams Family Values), Academy Award winner Frances McDormand (Fargo), who's married to Joel Coen, and former professional boxer Randall 'Tex' Cobb (The Golden Child), who, apparently, once took such a brutal, prolonged beating in the ring from heavyweight Larry Holmes during a 1982 match at Houston's Astrodome that it caused a disgusted Howard Cosell to swear off announcing boxing matches for the rest of his life.

Cage plays H.I. McDunnough, a career criminal who has a penchant for robbing convenience stores, along with getting caught.  During his various incarcerations he falls for, and eventually marries, a police officer named Edwina aka Ed (Hunter) and the pair move into a starter home (a trailer) while H.I. goes on the straight and narrow, taking on a respectable job.  Things go well, that is until the couple learns, while trying to start a family, that they can't have a baby due to the fact Ed's `insides were a rocky place where H.I.'s seed could find no purchase'.  Not only that but adoption isn't an option, given H.I.'s checked past.  As despair over their situation sets in, the couple learns of a local businessman named Nathan Arizona (Wilson), `the owner of the largest chain of unpainted furniture and bathroom fixtures throughout the southwest', and how his wife just gave birth to quintuplets.  From disparity comes a plan to snatch one of the babies and raise it as their own, the thought being perhaps Arizona and his wife have more than they can handle, and won't miss one too much.  They snatch the baby and return home, only to soon be visited by a couple of H.I.'s jailbird buddies, the brothers Gale (Goodman) and Evelle (Forsythe) Snoats, who've recently effectuated themselves an early release from prison.  Matters are further complicated as H.I. loses his job and soon finds himself reverting back to his old, criminal ways (seems Gale and Evelle are planning a bank job, and want H.I. in on the heist).  Eventually things come to a head as a large, dirty, greasy, hairy bounty hunter aka the warthog from hell named Leonard Smalls (Cobb) makes the scene, his intent being to collect the child by any means necessary.

This is one of those movies where everything works in terms of the writing, dialog, direction, performances, casting, and so on...the best aspect, in my opinion, is the unique writing as there's a ton of quotable lines from the film, a few of my favorites listed below (for context on most, you'll just have to see the film)...

`Son, you got a panty on yer head.'

`Now, what's it gonna be young feller? You want I should freeze or get down on the ground? Cause if'n I freeze, I can't rightly drop. And if'n I drop, I'm gonna be in motion.'

`Anyone found bipedal in five wears his a** for a hat!'

And then, of course, there's the classic line that comes as Nathan Arizona, after the abduction, is being questioned by local, state, and federal authorities.  At one point someone asks him what the baby was wearing at the time of the abduction and Arizona replies, in an agitated state, `I don't know - they were jammies! They had Yodas'n s**t on 'em!'...and there's a lot more where that came from...something else, what makes the dialog work as well as it does is the delivery, not only by the main performers but also by the supporting cast members.  Both Cage and Hunter are excellent in their roles, as are Goodman and Forsythe as the criminally dimwitted, slovenly Snoats, and Trey Wilson, as Nathan Arizona.  Frances McDormand also does very well as the wife of H.I.'s boss, but know her role is fairly small, at least compared to her part in the Coen Brothers' Fargo (1996), for which she ended up earning her an Academy Award.  I also really liked Randall 'Tex' Cobb in his role, which presented him more as a malevolent force of nature rather than your average, on screen villain.  As far as the direction, I thought it was done extremely well, especially during the opening sequences prior to the opening credits, which sets up a lot in a relatively short amount of time, and subsequently sets the tone well for the rest of the film.  There are so many great scenes throughout the film but the one that comes to my mind is a short one, and features Gale and Evelle, who've absconded with the baby after learning his true identity, as they stop at a gas station/convenience store to pick up supplies.  Evelle's interaction with the store attendant in terms of diapers, balloons, and whatnot, is worth the price of admission alone.  All in all this is an extremely funny, entertaining, and even thoughtful film, and one definitely worth owning as, if you're like me, you'll most likely watch it more than once.

The picture, presented in widescreen (1.85:1), on this DVD is very clean and clear, and the Dolby Digital Surround audio, available in English and French, comes through very well.  There's really not much in terms of extras, except for an original theatrical trailer, subtitles in English and Spanish, three television spots, and previews for a couple of other Coen Brothers releases including Barton Fink (1991) and Miller's Crossing (1990).  Actually, I'm somewhat surprised, at the time this review was written, that a newer DVD release of this film, one packed with extras, including a commentary or two, has yet to come out, but perhaps we'll see one sometime in the near future.

With that, Smalls vanishes from his office.

Nathan further redeems himself from his original nature at the end of the film when H.I. and Ed are returning Nathan Jr., thru yon window by showing love, mercy and understanding to the wayward kidnappers.

Holly Hunter, in her best role, is his suffering wife, a policeofficer who is infertile. They decide to steal a baby, Nathan Arizona Jr, with funny and sad consequences.

The key behind this film's success (critical success anyway) is the gift the Coen's have at the smaller things that fill up the bigger picture. The detailed mannerisms and quaint oddballness some of the characters have give them a rich texture which makes them unique and unforgettable.

This film brings the talents of Coen brothers to the front and the writing is sharp and tight, not one second of celluloid, nor one spoken word, is wasted. Even the music is inspired - a stirring banjo rendition of Beethoven's Ode to Joy.

275548,4,6300249964,"If I had it to do over, I'd give this movie five stars. It is hilarious. Yeah, the Coen brothers can have their dark, black comedy, bloody side (e.g., Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing and Fargo); but this film is from their light, witty, innocent side - and totally outrageous. These guys are masters at styling a film according to a certain time and place; and, in this case, the style is 1970's Arizona desert trailer park.

The basic plot idea is that Cage and Hunter, who are married, can't have kids. But they read about a couple named Arizona that just had quintuplets, and figure, that's more kids than they can probably handle. So, they decide to kidnap one of the toddlers for themselves. Because Cage is an ex-con and Hunter a policewoman, this leads to some pretty bizarre situations. There are two classic scenes in particular. The first is the baby diaper chase sequence, which involves a gun-toting convenience store attendant, a package of Pampers, the police, a pack of rampaging dogs, a shooting spree in a grocery store, and a chase through people's homes. The second is the baby seat chase sequence, in which little Nathan Arizona, Jr., strapped pleasantly in his car seat, is up for grabs: first by negligent bank robbers, who unintentionally leave him sitting in the middle of the highway; then by a motor cycle babyhunter-from-hell, who snatches him up and rides off with him sitting on the front of his motorcycle; then by his adopted parents, Cage and Hunter. It ends in a showdown with the babyhunter-from-hell. Cohen humor is always outrageous and always hilarious.

Like most Cohen brother films, Raising Arizona is full of outlandish characters that are well portrayed. Nicholas Cage is priceless as a Hawaiian shirt-wearing, hair-mussed bum, which he continued to play in other films, including Moonstruck (made that same year). Holly Hunter is fabulous as his tight-lipped, policewoman wife, later to play a similar role in O Brother Where Art Thou. John Goodman is consistent as one of two beer drinking, jail-bate ""friends,"" and played a one-eyed version of the same character in O Brother. There never has been a cuter little boy in film than T. J. Kuhn, who plays Nathan Arizona, Jr. And Trey Wilson is perfect as Nathan's dad - a wheeling, dealing, furniture store chain owner.

Raising Arizona is the beginning of a trend of wild, quirky, hilarious films by the Cohens that has not let up, most notably O Brother Where Art Thou, Hudsucker Proxy and Fargo. You'll recognize the seeds of some of the characters and gags from those films in this one. Enjoy!

275549,5,6300249964,"That quote is something I once heard to describe Jim Jarmusch' ""Stranger Than Paradise"", another benchmark in American indie filmmaking.  Raising Arizona is flat-out hilarious, don't get me wrong.  It is like a human cartoon, brilliantly realized by the Coen Brothers and their talented cast.  Critics like Roger Ebert didn't get it when it came out and now I'm sure he feels sheepish.

But beneath the manic surface of this comedy lies deep philosophical significance!  Mel Brooks said comedies are serious business.  He's right!  I recently saw this film again for the first time in eight years.  I feel the need to point out some of the genius of this film, despite the fact that I may be preaching to the converted:

H.I's ""adoption"" of the Arizona tyke is followed by the ""birth"" of his old buddies, who emerge from the mud like it were a womb and they newborns from hell.

History repeats itself, that to me is an underlying theme of Raising Arizona.  Just as H.I. had to reach under the cradle to pull out the tyke, Leonard Smalls had to pull H.I. out from under the automobile.  And Smalls has the same tattoo H.I. has.  Smalls represents the demon of H.I.'s past that he must vanquish to become a responsible human being who can care for his wife and kids.

So please, don't take this review too seriously.  This film is meant to be laughed at.  But Ethan Coen, a philosophy grad, and Joel Coen, film student from NYU are no dummies.",1125446400,6,1442,4.596078431372549
275550,5,6300249964,"""Raising Arizona"" is one of what I consider to be the five instantly classic films by the team of Ethan and Joel Coen, the others being ""Blood Simple"", ""Fargo"", ""Oh Brother Where Are Thou"", and ""The Big Lebowski"".

But ""Raising Arizona"" is my personal favorite, and probably the most quotable films I have ever seen, with some of the best dialogue ever written for film.

The story in brief: H.I. (Nicholas Cage) and ""Ed"" (Holly Hunter, in one of my favorite roles of hers) portray, respectively, an ex-con and a cop who meet when he keeps getting arrested for robbing convenience stores. They fall in love, get married, decide that ""there is just too much love"" between them, and they need a ""critter to share it with"". Upon finding that ""Edwina's insides were a rocky place"" where H.I.'s ""seed could find no purchase"", they try to adopt, but are turned down because of H.I.'s record. Then they read in the newspaper about local unpainted furniture storeowner Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), owner of ""Unpainted Arizona"", and his wife having quintuplets as a result of fertility pills, and who joke that ""They got more than they can handle"". The couple hatch a plan to take one of the babies and raise it as their own.

What results is an ongoing, fast-paced, hilarious set of misadventures, complicated by the appearance of a ruthless, heartless outlaw named Leonard Smalls (Randall ""Tex"" Cobb) Nathan Arizona hires to find the missing baby, and two felon friends from H.I.'s past (John Goodman and William Forsythe), who make a childbirth-like escape from prison. Sam McMurray (the smarmy dad in ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"") is H.I.'s....smarmy boss, Glen. Frances McDormand (real-life spouse of Joel Coen, and star of other Coen films such as ""Blood Simple"" and ""Fargo"") is his excitable wife Dot. M. Emmet Walsh (""Blood Simple"") has a scenery-chewing cameo role as H.I.'s talkative co-worker.

When Ed finally opens up her 5'2"" can of Southern-fried whup-ass, throwing her badge to the dirt, striding towards Leonard Smalls as she bellows with all her might, ""Gimme back that baby, you warthog from HELL!!!"" I always fling my arms up and shout ""You go girl! Kick his ass!""

And the way Hunter cries is hilarious.

Holly Hunter was great in this role, as one would expect. She's a very talented actress, in both serious and comedic roles.

Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter made a great onscreen couple, Cage with his hair standing out in every direction, looking like a hapless, browbeaten puppy half of the time, and Hunter as his diminuitive firecracker of a wife who loves him and tries to keep him honest (oh yeah except for that little kidnapping excursion).

I could go on and on about this film but suffice to say that so far I haven't met anyone who didn't find ""Raising Arizona"" hilarious. And as any great Coen brothers film, it has a certain mythic quality that's hard to describe, but is present all of of the brothers' best efforts. When I was single, I often used Coen brothers films as a barometer of sorts for prospective boyfriends. For instance, I remember seeing ""Fargo"" on a first date, and when we came out of the theater, the guy (whose name I have since forgotten anyway) remarked ""Huh, I didn't think much of that"", while I was thinking how blown away I was by the film! I immediately thought to myself ""So much for him! This relationship won't last long.""

For more great Coen comedy, check out ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"" (2000), which is loosely based on Homer's epic poem ""The Odyssey"". Another great Coen comedy is ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998), which also includes my favorite singer/songwriter Aimee Mann in a brief cameo, and boasts a cult following that has resulted in an annual ""Lebowskifest"" for fans of the film.

""Blood Simple"" (1984) is probably my favorite film noir modern-day classic tale of lust and betrayal, and is my personal second-favorite Coen brothers film. ""Fargo"" (1996), which won the Screenwriting Oscar, and an Oscar for Frances McDormand, is another must-see Coen classic.",1125360000,5,4017,4.851094890510949
275551,5,6300249964,"A deft, very funny screwball comedy starring Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter as a married couple who can't have kids so decide to steal one. Cage is a petty thief who has been to the slammer a number of times; Hunter is the prison photographer who always takes his mug shot. They fall in love, get married, and Cage tries to go straight - in fact, succeeds, until the babynapping occurs. Quintuplets have been born in Arizona, and they decide to take one. It's one crazy thing after another from that point on. The dialogue is terrific, and Cage is at his best with his Buster Keatonish deadpan mannerisms. A real treat of a movie.

275552,4,6300249964,"While this movie wasn't totally hilarious, there's always good fun with John Goodman in it. H.I.{Nicholas Cage} is a criminal, and his wife {Holly Hunter} is a cop. When she can't get pregnant, there isn't one adoption agency around that can give them a kid. So, they just kidnap a baby and pass it on as their own, because they want one so bad, and things don't go so easily after that because that's when John Goodman and his partner {who are both also escaped criminals} have to live with them for a while and later in the movie, things still don't get better because of Leonard Smalls, a tough biker who can probably crush anything with his hands and destory anything else with his grenades. Loosely, I'd give this just 4 stars, because while it was funny, John Goodman was my favorite guy, because I thought he was funny. This movie was not bad at all for a good comedy. Just the way he appeared in one scene, yelling as he crawled out of the mud in the pouring rain just like a monster or something. He is very funny. This movie was pretty neat, and not all that serious. There was never a sequel, though. It doesn't need one anyhow.",1124755200,,1139,4.377358490566038
275553,4,6300249964,"I enjoyed watching this movie last night as it was fun and quite funny. The acting is great notably by Nicolas Cage, Holly Hunter and John Goodman. The jokes were great and memorable and I found myself on the floor rolling with laughter at some parts. The music is a little too crazy at times but it's hilarious. The janitor is so funny! I love thee manhunter guy who throws the grenade at the rabbit! That was absolutely hilarious!!!!!!!

The movie is about Hi and Ed, a newly married couple who cannot conceive a child. No adoption agency will give them a baby as Hi has a criminal past. So, they steal Nate Jr. the son of the rich and hilarious Nathan Arizona. So now everyone is on the lookout for this baby and there's a huge reward. The manhunter is one guy trying to get the baby and even two excaped convicts and once friends of Hi are trying to get little Nate Jr.

The movie has many memorable hilarious scenes like when the police is running after Hi. Priceless fun. ""You've got a panty over yur head!!!!!!!!!!"" Ha Ha !!!!!!!!!

But, my favorite line was when one of the Snoat brothers tells the owner of a store at a gas station to count to 850 and back. At 799, he's like ""bull sh**"" when suddenly the Snoat brothers drive full blast down the road screaming at the top of their lungs because they forget Nathan Jr. The owner freaks out and gets back on the floor and counts again!

The movie may be cheesy and the music may be annoying at times but it's still great fun and you'll be laughing nonstop!

This is how I rank the 3 Coen Brothers movies that I saw:

1. Fargo- By far the best!

2. Raising Arizona- Awesome! Hilarious!

3. The Big Lebowski- pretty funny but too many cuss words!",1122076800,,1702,4.313479623824452

Just take my word for it and many other reviewers on here as well: ADD IT TO YOUR COLLECTION, PRONTO!

275555,5,6300249964,"My favorite Coen Brother film might be Raising Arizona. It is the story of a convenient-store robber named Hi (Nicolas Cage) who falls in love with a police-booking officer named Ed (Holly Hunter). And for love, Hi goes straight until about page ten when Hi and Ed decide that they need a child to complete the ""family unit."" Unfortunately, Ed is ""barren"" and Hi is an ex-con, so they are unlikely either to conceive or to adopt. But Nathan and Florence Arizona--owners of the Arizona Unpainted Furniture dynasty--have just had quintuplets, and according to the headlines, it's ""more than they can handle."" Ed persuades Hi that they should take one, and so they do, stumbling into a story spiral that will never quite let up. They take Nathan Jr. back to their ""suburban starter home""--a trailer in a largely empty expanse of desert--where they are visited in turns by Hi's boss, Glen, who brings his wife and frightening tribe of children, by escaped convicts Evelle and Gail Snopes and by a bounty-hunter on a motor cycle. Each proves a threat to the integrity of the newly, if illegally, formed family unit--if only by critiquing their parenting skills. Glen feels Hi needs to lighten up and swap wives. Glen's wife feels a shrieking panic when she learns that Nathan Jr. has yet to have his ""Dip-tet."" Evelle and Gail think breast-feeding is an absolute must without which the child will end up in prison just as they did. And the bounty-hunter wants the child in order to claim the $25,000 reward though he kindly intends to rough up the kid-nappers for free. In the end, they all recognize Nathan Jr. and want the reward of his love or the reward for his return. And when he is, then, kid-napped from the kidnappers, it results in a chase that ends in kindness, charity and an explosion--after which the movies' epilogue gently lowers our expectations down onto the sad, sweet melancholy of Hi's last dream.

When you look at the filmography of the Coen Brothers, you may wonder at their variety, at their breadth. They seem to be able to work in any number of genres. But, in truth, they have only ever worked in but one: a zany film noir. And while those who love them, like myself, can provide you with a rather long list of objects, character types and thematic elements that regularly occur in their films--hats, vomiting, kidnapping, howling fat men, dreams--I am rather more interested in their portrayal of a world inhabited by psycho-social fundamentalists, who take everyone at his or her word--literally--and who are incapable of suspicion, of divining ill-intent. They are, more often than not, people who dream of having what is really no more than the ordinary fare of ordinary people; people who dream of living in what other people seek to escape. Hi and Ed are a warm trailer trash version of the farm couple in Grant Wood's American Gothic. And Hi is probably the better example. Is he an innocent or a well-meaning, conscious-less idiot? Terminally straight-faced, he describes his life and story in long, calm periods with Dickensian qualification whether he is being fired at by a convenient store clerk with a gun many times bigger than his own; is being chased by police who fire non-stop and indiscriminately down residential streets, into occupied homes and through busy super-markets; or is being beaten senseless by the warthog from hell--none of which, incidentally, is as frightening as Glen's pre-schoolers. When you add the rush and erratic veer of the shaky cam shots and the distance-distorting wide-angle lenses, the result is an overwhelming visual for a life swiftly picking up speed in its downward spiral. But Hi is forever deadpan and earnest with only his hair to signal a kind of frenzied surprise at the unexpected mysteries of just getting through another day.",1112745600,7,3809,4.869029275808937

Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunt give excellent performances...and it is easy to see there is more to come for these folks.  One can also see a younger John Goodman as one of HI's prison buddies who breaks out of jail and comes to stay with HI and Ed.

275561,5,6300249964,"""Raising Arizona"" tells the story of an ex-con with a penchant for robbing convenience stores, H.I. McDonnough, played by Nicholas Cage and his new wife Ed, short for Edwina, played by and expressly written for Holly Hunter by the Brothers Coen.

 Ed and Hi find themselves together after Ed takes Hi's mugshots and while Hi serves three months in prison then paroled , they marry. The film has some great scenes and one liners galore like the prison scene where a group is receiving counselling:

 Prison Counsellor: Why do you say you feel ""trapped"" in a man's body.
 ""Trapped"" Convict: Well, sometimes I get the menstrual cramps real hard.

 After a couple months of wedded bliss the McDonnough's need to concieve a child but with no luck, their failed attempt at adoption and their subsequent kidnapping of Nathan Jr. nathan Jr. is one of the famous Arizona Quintuplets who belong to furniture mogul and owner of all Upainted Arizona stores, Nathan Arizona, Sr.(Trey Wilson) & his wife Florence. The kidnapping highlights the plot.

 Enter Hi's prison buddy brothers, Gale and Evelle Snoats, freshly escaped out of the pokey and ""the finest pair that ever broke air,"" according to Hi. The brothers Snoats are played to the hilt by John Goodman and William Forsythe. They have a plan to get Hi back in the business with a bank heist of the local hayseed Farmers and Merchants Bank down the way.

 Also in the McDonnough's social circle is Hi's work buddy and swinger, Glen (Sam McMurray) his swinger wife, Dot (an excellent, albeit small part for Frances McDormand)and their bratty passel of kids.

 The hunt for the baby Arizona is on with Randall 'Tex' Cobb playing Leonard Smalls, a bounty hunter who is hired by Nathan Sr. to find Nathan Jr and bring him back home to his mamma.

 Many hilarious and touching scenes occur in this fine movie from the Coen brothers with some top-notch acting and fleshed out characatures.

 Highly Recommended For Multiple Viewings!

 Happy Watching!",1090454400,24,1989,4.866071428571429
275562,4,6300249964,"One of the earlier films of the Coen brothers (Joel and Ethan), ""Raising Arizona"" nevertheless lays the foundation for the Coens' later, more polished efforts.
H.I. (""Hi"") McDonough, played with an earnest romanticism by Nicolas Cage, is a classic Coen protagonist.  He means well, even if he can't get his master plan to quite come together (this is a man of dreams, forced into the life of a small-time hood by trickle-down economics), and he is prone to speaking in fits of poetry that often go awry (""There's what's right and there's what's right, and never the twain shall meet"").  In one of the most inspired courtings ever to be put on film, Hi woos and wins Police Officer Edwina (""Ed""), played by Holly Hunter in a career-defining role, while being booked on numerous occasions.
Denied the joys of parenthood by Ed's infertile womb (""a rocky place where my seed could find no purchase"") and Hi's criminal past - Ed's police service doesn't quite ""cancel out"" Hi's record like they had hoped -- Hi and Ed can't really enjoy their ""salad days"" in their trailer in the Arizona desert.  That is, until the Arizona Quints are born to unpainted furniture magnate Nathan Arizona.  Deciding that old Nathan and his wife have more kids than they could handle, Ed and Hi decide to kidnap one of the little nippers.  In a scene that parodies ""Jaws,"" Hi snags Nathan Jr., and Ed and Hi are parents.
Unfortunately, Hi's criminal past catches up wtih him as Gale (John Goodman) and Evelle (William Forsythe) break out of prison and hide out with Hi at the family trailer.  Soon they are on to Hi's kidnapping, and they decide to pursue their own agenda.  Unfortunately for all concerned, bounty hunter Leonard Smalls is on the hunt for the kidnapped youngster, too -- and a nasty bloodhound from hell he is, too.  Surely casting ""Tex"" Cobb in this part is one of the most inspired bits of casting ever!
The movie is chock full of surprises, from the chase scenes involving what seems like ten packs of hounds and more gunfire than one could possibly imagine, to a fight in the trailer that won't be topped until ""Kill Bill, Vol. 2,"" and an over-the-top cameo performance by Frances MacDormand as a nosy neighbor with a fondness for bibical names and a trove of baby advice.  The dialogue is rich, filled with comic inspiration and a touching devotion to family.  And, like most Coen brothers movies, things generally turn out all right for our heroes, they definitely don't wind up the way they planned.
For fans of the Coens, off-beat comedies, Nic Cage and Holly Hunter (which should describe an awful lot of folks), this is a heck of a film.",1085702400,4,2639,4.680345572354212

I'm normally a big fan of Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter, however this movie just didn't deliver. The plot was original and it could have had the potential at becoming a real classic, amusing film, however the hysteria overshadowed the entertainment value of it. There was too much predictable shrieking, screaming, and yelling that it just got annoying after awhile. I thought the worst part was towards the end when things just starting dragging on. Because it's a typical Hollywood movie, the storyline climaxes towards chaos and turmoil, but you can predict that in a typical fashion, there will be a few carchases, some yelling and screaming, some explosions, and then a happy ending (surprise). This movie could have been outstanding if the humor were more carefully thought out and skillfully crafted.",1076630400,4,927,5.105263157894737

275575,5,6300249964,"The Coen Brothers followed their successful film debut of BLOOD SIMPLE with one of the most original and strange comedies ever to be made in America.  From the very first shots, as career petty criminal H.I. McDonnough (Nicholas Cage) meets and woos police photographer Ed (Holly Hunter) with each arrest, the film announces that it is not going to dwell much in the world of realism.  In fact, the whole film seems to dwell in its own alternative universe with its own logic.  Everything works together to confirm this, from the strange camera angles, the deadpan expressions on the faces of many of the performers, the tongue-in-cheek delivery in every scene, the inventive outrageousness of every segment.  There are hundreds of brilliant moments, from Leonard Smalls's tattoo (""Mother Didn't Love Me"") to the convenience store clerk who interrupts his counting (""One Mississippi, Two Mississippi, Three Mississippi . . ."") only to see the bandits returning in their car to Nicholas Cage leaning out of the car to snag a package of Huggies to the strange, weird yodeling that reprises throughout the film.
The film perfectly blends the near perfect script that the Brothers created, with perfect direction, and a bevy of amazingly effective performances.  Cage, Hunter, John Goodman, Trey Wilson (who died only a year or two later after this film came out), William Forsythe, Tex Cobb, and a host of supporting performers manage to generate one great scene after another.  I have probably seen this film 8 or 9 times over the years, and every time I see it, it strikes me just as fun and as fresh as before.
Every fan of the Coen Brothers is going to have a different set of favorites, but this is probably my second favorite of all their films, following only THE BIG LEBOWSKI.  What amazes me after repeated viewings is how the Coens managed to take a large number of elements that could very easily not have meshed, and make something magnificent out of it.",1068336000,6,1963,4.859281437125748

Cohens' characters and stories are usually built-up, bizzare ones, but one usually soon admits the characters and the story to be consistent in itself, there are many subtleties. However R.A. characters are so raw, they lack depth, they do not blend.
Scripting, directing, cinematography, acting, all are 3rd class. Is it a college graduation project? I wonder if Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter ever want to rememeber acting in this. I know why directors' comments are missing in the DVD. It's because they don't even want to comment on it.
Narration is of the too-ordinary Hollywood style, these guys were independent filmmakers weren't they?

Nicolas Cage plays Hi, a repeat inhabitant of the Tempe, Arizona prison, where he meets police officer Ed (Holly Hunter) and falls in love with her.  After Hi's third parole, he agrees to give up his life of crime for Ed, and the two get married.  Before long, they decide that they want nothing more than to start a family.  Ed, however, is barren -- and they find that it's not exactly easy for a repeat offender to adopt a child.
When Nathan Arizona, owner of the furniture chain, Unpainted Arizona, is blessed with quintuplets, Hi and Ed decide that the Arizonas have more than they can handle -- so they decide to take one of the babies.  But before Hi and Ed can settle into their new lives with little Nathan, Jr., Nathan Arizona offers a reward for the baby, and suddenly everyone's after him.
I honestly can't remember the last time I laughed so hard while watching a movie.  I laughed so hard that I choked.  I almost died -- but really, can you think of a better way to die?  I can't.
Raising Arizona is bizarre and quirky -- and just the expression on Nicolas Cage's face throughout this movie (not to mention his wild hair) will keep you snickering from start to finish.

This plot is so wacky and the characters are so disgustingly funny, yet somehow they seem to become more and more believable as normal people towards the end. Such as the two escaped convicts who at first seem to be a couple of slobs with cares for no one, then at the end you realize they end up caring for the baby even more than themselves. All the performances are top notch, and the ""Huggies"" chase scene that takes place in the middle of the film is classic and had me laughing so hard it gave me a headache for the rest of the night.

275581,5,6300249964,"Once in awhile, you see a movie comedy that almost exactly matches your sense of humor, and RAISING ARIZONA certainly did that for me.  Almost every moment that his presented as funny IS funny (at least to me).  Yes, it is the story of a rather hapless couple (an ex-con, barely, and a cop) who can't conceive and can't adopt, and thus kidnap one baby from a set of quintuplets.  It sounds unpleasant, but is far from it.
The baby is absolutely charming, and softens and charms the hearts of everyone he meets.  Not for one instant do we feel the baby is in danger, and thus we can sit back and enjoy the antics.
The Coen Brothers have made lots of stylish movies (FARGO, MILLER'S CROSSING, BLOOD SIMPLE, etc. etc.) but RAISING ARIZONA is stylish in a loose way, if that makes sense.  They use stunning camera work and amazing angles, which we are all VERY aware of as viewers, but they serve to add to the humor and tone of the movie.  Midway through, there is the funniest chase sequence ever, where poor Hi tries to get diapers for his baby, and gets caught up in a police chase involving cops, vicious dogs, shopping carts and one very ticked off wife!
The movie begins with a fifteen minute opening sequence, quickly telling us the story of how Hi (Nicholas Cage) a three time loser for petty armed robbery (never used live ammo) meets policewoman Edwina (Holly Hunter) as he's having his mug shot taken, and falls for her, gets out of jail, marries, they're happy, then can't have kids and fall into despair.  After the opening, the credits start, and we realize, in an amazed way, that we've already seen more story and had more laughs than most movies deliver in their entire length.
The Coens don't waste any energy. Every single line is obviously lovingly crafted for maximum humor and to establish character.  Everyone has a rhythm and way of speaking that shows their obvious intelligence and then contrasts that intelligence with their VERY poor choices in life.  For example, John Goodman plays one of a pair of brothers who escape from prison (in a hilarious, unforgettable rainsoaked scene) and come to ""visit"" Hi just a day after he's gotten Jr., the new baby.  Goodman will speak wisely with Hi about the shackles of marriage, and then launch on a totally stupid bank robbery.
Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter have never been better.  Cage, in particular, is touching, frustrating, hilarious and at his hangdog best.  He's done flashier roles, of course, but seldom has he been more perfectly cast.  The wonderful Frances McDormand has a small, but hysterical role.
My friends and I can now quote whole passages of this movie.  If you like RAISING ARIZONA, you'll love it.  There doesn't seem to be a middle ground.  I know a few people who hate the movie, but many more who watch it at least once a year, regular as clockwork.  If you haven't seen it, try it.  You may make a friend for life!!",1049328000,8,2910,4.595744680851064

275594,5,6300249964,"The first five minutes are as funny and economical as any on record. The main characters reveal themselves hilariously, while Nicholas Cage's voice-over regales as classic understatement. The dialogue remains offbeat and original,with only occasional lapses. Cage and Hunter often sound as if they've watched too much Oprah, rambling on about the family ""unit"", or his description of her infertility as ""insides too barren for my seed to get a purchase"". With this film the Coen Bros. prove they can do comedy as expertly as melodrama, as does Cage, whose mix-master hairdo and bewildered expression reflect the social rules he just can't seem to get right. Only businessman Nathan Arizona remains a sane sensible voice throughout, a departure for the usually anti-business world of film. Almost stealing the show is William Forsythe as Evelle the quarter-wit brother of half-wit John Goodman. His gap-toothed grin and eternal high spirits amidst a starkly blank expression remind me of a demented Cheshire cat. The movie as a whole amounts to a light-hearted jape at family obsessed America, where by Hunter's logic some peoples has too many kids while others ain't got enough, so it's okay to take from them that has too many. Sort of like socialist logic applied to child distribution. On a more ominous note is a Keystone Cops indictment of gun-toting America, where too many civilians and cops alike come armed and ready to shoot, except Cage who reveals a benign inner nature by refusing to load. Only the epilogue and Randy Cobb disappoint. Cobb certainly looks the part of cartoon evil, but can't project the menace to go with it. With these dim but lovable characters, it's obvious the Bros. were at sea in figuring out how to end. It's as though they're suddenly embarassed with the liberties taken with the institution of family, so only a Norman Rockwell level of smarmy apology can compensate. Too bad, because the compensation is already there in the characters of H.I. and Ed (Cage & Hunter). Nonetheless, the movie remains fresh and rollicking, thrusting the Coens to the forefront of independent filmmakers, and presenting the audience with a good number of belly laughs along the way.",1026950400,11,2202,5.052197802197802
275595,4,6300249964,"I hope i can do this film as much justice as the editorial reviewer and others have done. I can not tell you how much I laughed at this movie. 'Now Hi, you go right in there and get me one of those babies'. I thought that was one of the funniest lines in this movie and well,  yes i guess it does tend to be black comedy. But, Holly Hunter was very, very funny in this film. And the way she pushes Nicholas Cage around in this film was quite comical. It certianly did invoke my wilful suspension of disbelief and i can almost see this whole scenario taking place although i'm glad it is just fiction. The bad guys are so hilarious that we start to side with them a little. This Nathan Arizona guy from the unpainted Arizona Furniture store, 'or his name is not Arizona' (actually it is not). Well, he has so much and this poor family of police officer and repeat offender hold up artist have so little that it seems like the rich folks should want to share one of their babies with these characters. Oh poor, H.I. why didn't he just go in and ask old Nathan for one of those babies. Oh well maybe him and Hunter will conceive one of their own after all since the baby does get back to its family.

275596,5,6300249964,"I realize that a title like the one above can seem like hyperbole, but this is not overstatement.  I have watched hundreds, maybe thousands of movies in my life and this one always stands out.
An offbeat comedy about a childless couple who kidnap one of a set of quintuplets so they can have a complete family, this movie is close to perfect from beginning to end.  Much as I enjoy all the Coen brothers works, this one always stands out as their best.  It is an early gem of theirs, and stars people who were really at the beginning of their careers:  Nicholas Cage, Holly Hunter and John Goodman.
From the courtship of Hi and Ed to the kidnaping of the Arizona baby to a botched convenience store robbery to a confrontation with a bounty hunter from Hell, this movie is filled with great moments.  This movie is a modern classic and is one of the all-time best comedies.",1020902400,12,872,4.425
275597,5,6300249964,"The Coen Brothers.  You either love `em or you hate `em, right?  There's very little middle ground where these boys are concerned.  And that includes the professional critics.  Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? gets either an F or 500 Thumbs Up.
Me, I'm firmly entrenched in the love `em camp.  Sure, their work presents a decidedly grim view of human nature, even in the comedies.  Sometimes a little tenderness and humanity do manage to peek through, but that has nothing to do with why I am a fan and student of theirs.  What I love is the sheer brilliance and depth of creativity that they continue to demonstrate on all fronts.
Take Raising Arizona, for instance.  I've seen it 15 or 20 times by now, and I'm still mining its riches.
Sometimes I watch it for the obvious things, like the camera work; the trademark low-to-high angles, the framing and composition of nearly every shot, the character's eye views when Hi is being twirled over one of his prison buddy's head or lying on his side on the floor of the trailer, the saturated, hyper-realistic color of the daytime Arizona desert or the nighttime interior of a convenience store.
Other times I focus in on the writing. Maybe it's the dialog and it's context, like the bank robbery scene.  ""All right you hayseeds, freeze and get down on the floor.  Well which one is it gonna be? Freeze or get down on the floor?.... Where'd all the tellers go?  They're down on the floor, like you told `em.""  Or the convenience store escape scene, where Hi and Ed alternate between near hysterical argument and Hi calmly giving driving directions to Ed.
Or maybe it's the richness, subtlety, and attention to detail of the storyline; the shopkeeper who starts counting when commanded to (""one Mississippi, two Mississippi, ...) and who is still counting when we drive back by later (""971 Mississippi, ...), the convict buddy who steps back into the trailer to pick up a copy of Dr. Spock after kidnapping Nathan Jr., the growling inmate who is still mopping the floor every time Hi returns to prison, making progress at glacial speed.
Or take my favorite recent example.  I'm watching the movie with my wife, who is in my opinion, the most talented continuity expert not working in Hollywood.  In the middle of the c-store holdup scene, when Hi runs out and jumps in the car, she says, ""Where are the Huggies?""  A minute or two later, Hi reaches down out of the speeding car and gathers in the Huggies, which were lying in the road.
This last time, it was the sound that caught my attention.  Not just the music, but the entire sound package.  Don't get me wrong.  The music by Carter Burwell, especially the banjo, yodeling and whistling, ranks right up there in awesome inventiveness with the zither music of Anton Karas in The Third Man and the work that Bernard Herrmann did for Alfred Hitchcock, and anyone who includes a smidgen of Ode to Joy on the banjo over the closing credits certainly has my vote.
But wait, there's more!  Pay attention when Glen comes to Hi's trailer to fire him.  After Hi tells him to lower his voice, Glen says he'll talk ""... as loud as I PLEASE!""  When he raises his voice on the word Please, it is the only word that produces an echo from the surrounding desert.  Is that subtle enough for you?
And I've only scratched the surface....",1015372800,7,3313,4.608177172061329

Chaos ensues!
One of the looniest comedies this side of Wile E. Coyote, ""Raising Arizona"" combines clever dialogue with slapstick to produce a memorable gem. Cage is woderfully kooky as the hopeless felon, the right mix of rube, redneck, and good intentions (which always go astray). Hunter's low-key,  nuanced performance is the ideal balance to Cage's; their argument over the personality of their pilfered child is a hoot: she sees a sweet boy, he (of course)sees a little outlaw. Most of the humor is tied to characterization and the Coen's clever dialogue (one of the best lines: a farmer's statement to John Goodman's character during a hold-up). The film's eccentric cinematography (the chase segments in particular) is by future ""Addams Family/Men in Black"" director Barry Sonnenfeld; combine it with Joel Coen's surefooted, intuitive direction and we have a movie full of wild angles and dizzying chases.

H.I. (Nic Cage) is a reformed convenience-store robber who marries Edwina (Holly Hunter), a policewoman.  They try to conceive a child, but with no luck.  They become bitter and despondent.  H.I.'s reformation ends when he and Edwina decide to kidnap one of the many infants of Nathan and Florence Arizona, a couple recently blessed with quintuplets.
Hi's relationship with Edwina takes a turn for the worse when Gayle (John Goodman) and Evell (William Forsythe), freshly escaped from prison, invite him in on one of their schemes, a bank robbery.
The baby's father, Nathan Arizona, then hires a bounty hunter to get the boy back.  It's a madcap comedy from start to finish, but the pace just gets wilder and wilder as the movie progresses.
This movie is chock full of hilarious dialogue and crazy action scenes.  Absolutely none of it is believable; it's just an hour and a half of magnificent entertainment.  All the actors get big laughs from me... possibly Frances McDormand most of all, as Dot, the jabbering lunatic wife of H.I.'s boss.

Both Cage and Hunter have gone on to become huge stars but it is wonderful to see them so long ago in such an affectionate comedy.

Frances McDormand is hilarious as a ""swinger"" and her husband is flawless as the typical redneck with a horrible sense of humor.

Cage was still wonderfully attractive and playing in small, offbeat movies when he acted in this (oh, glory days) and Hunter was virtually unknown. Hunter plays a policewoman who marries one of the cons she jails, Cage.  She has a huge problem though: babies.  She wants a baby in the worst way possible and all of their efforts to conceive have not worked.

They thus decide to kidnap a baby from a couple who has had multiple infant births from fertility drugs, figuring they can spare one.  They learn of this couple on the tv set where the husband does all his advertising as a succesful retailing entrepreneur.  Things get wildly comic with this kidnapping, featuring yet more oddball characters encountered in their road show.  John Goodman was also fairly unknown at this point and he plays a hilarious con who has literally tunneled out of prison.  Then there's the matter of high speed chases and forgetting where the baby is.  The Coens have a view of the world that is all their own and it is filled with the absurdities of modern life.  This is them showing all the promise of what was to come in later films that the public finally discovered.

275632,3,6300249964,"I thought John Goodman was the funniest person on the screen in this one. He has a quality in his acting that could turn comedy to drama or horror in a fraction of a second. He did that a couple of times in this film, and of course with TV's Roseanne it was a weekly chore. I wouldn't be surprised to see him cast as some kind of really mean heavy one of these days. He could do it.
Holly Hunter proves here and elsewhere that she is more than just a pretty face. Her almost painfully true to life portrayal of a nice but not overly bright cop was perfect. Normally almost too cute for words, she was here almost plain. I think she was working on her career for the second half of her life. (She was twenty-nine when this film was made.) She knows that there is nothing deader in Hollywood than a ""cute"" actress past her thirtieth birthday. (Meg Ryan and Goldie Hawn providing cases that test the rule.)
I thought Nicolas Cage gave his best performance in Mike Figgis's Leaving Las Vegas (1995), but without the gorgeous Elisabeth Shue, I would never have watched that good but rather depressing flick. I thought he was tolerable in Honeymoon in Vegas (1992), but I didn't think much of the film. In David Lynch's Wild at Heart (1990) he certainly gave a creditable performance, and maybe even a very good one; and the movie wasn't bad, but I just thought that he and Lynch pandered too obviously to their young, outsider audience. None of this is anything against Cage; it's just that the character he usually depicts, a sweet, dumbed-down/but lovable outsider, just doesn't appeal to me. (Of course Cage himself is anything but dumb.) It's obvious that the movie-going public likes him a lot, and I imagine that women find him sexy, cute and just the kind of non-threatening guy they'd like to snuggle up to. Still Cage is worth keeping an eye on. I think with the right material, he may one day give a performance worthy of a great actor. One thing I can tell you for sure, if you like Nicolas Cage, you'll like this movie because his presence and style dominate throughout.

275645,5,6300249964,"The Coen brothers have not made a bad movie, and I am hard pressed to name a favorite.  This is the first of their movies I ever saw so it holds a place in my heart for getting me hooked on their movies.  Funny beyond  belief yet touching on many levels.  My only complaint is Holly Hunter's  accent which ironically seems fake to me yet she has a Southern accent.  Go  figure.",958262400,5,377,4.152777777777778
275646,5,6300249964,"This movie has the longest cold opening in the history of film, that I know of.  The first 20 minutes (before the titles) grabs you like a harpoon and you're off on the wild ride!  This film has some of the best camera  work and editing you'll ever see, evidenced by similar long, wild tracking  shots in Sonnenfeld's cinematography.  While working at LA's Mark Taper  Forum with actress Susan Egan, she told me that Raising Arizona had been  made into a stage musical featuring a song ""Gotta get his  Dip-tet!""  Wow.  Note: these songs are not in the movie, just a play  by some students; the Raising Arizona movie soundtrack by Carter Burwell is  fantastic.

275648,5,6300249964,"I've seen this movie countless times and it never loses its appeal.  A classic of an almost undescribable nature, part comedy, part adventure, all fun.  About a couple unable to conceive children who decide to take one of  a highly telivised set of quintuplets off its parents hands (they have more  than they can handle).  A pair of dimwitted but generally kindhearted  escaped convicts, a bounty hunter straight out of a Mad Max movie, a chase  scene involving cops, a gun toting convenience store clerk, and lots and  lots of dogs make for one hell of an entertaining movie.  What adds more to  the greatness of this film is the truly cerebral dialogue and the essence  of morality in almost every character (no matter how shady they seem).  A  true classic from the 1980's if there ever was one if you haven't seen this  movie you are missing a treat, if you have seen it then you know what  others are missing!",955929600,11,915,4.561728395061729

Hilarious performances by Holly Hunter, Nicolas Cage and John Goodman. The opening sequence and the  chase scenes are brilliant, and the whole film is bursting with energy.  Kinetic pace, hilarious situations and a fun score make this one extremely  entertaining if you like your comedies bizarre. The Cohen brothers have a  lot to offer and I hope they keep on making good films. From a scale of  1-10 I give this film an 8!",955238400,3,545,4.6947368421052635
275650,5,6300249964,"This movie made me laugh out loud, which not enough comedies do. It is filled with dry, almost throwaway lines that make rewatching the film a pleasure as you detect and savor the ironies and skewed views on life. I  bought it on VHS, and now DVD. I was astounded when a friend of mine told  me he didn't like it at all - one reason he gave is that the plot is about  kidnapping a baby in order to create a ""normal"" family, and he  thought that was sick. But then I found out that my friend likes A Fish  Named Wanda which has so-called humorous scenes involving killing dogs and  pet fish. Well, to each his own. In this film, the stars are weird but not  bad people. And it has a happy ending without killing animals or people!",950659200,7,729,4.127659574468085

NO EXCEPTIONS. Every single line. The bank robbery scene is pure  genius.  This is a credit to the Coens.  The amazing part is that they have  found a way to make such a funny movie without being offensive or obscene.

This movie is just hilarious! Of course you do need one thing  before you watch this, A SENSE OF HUMOR.  If you go into this movie  expecting a RoMaNtIc CoMeDy, then you don't know the true art of JOEL AND  ETHAN COEN. We are lucky enough to have these two making these great movies  that represent the majority of us that look at life with a sort of BLACK  COMEDY.  Not only is the dialogue hilarious, but the chase scenes, HOLY  CRAP!
""Don't watch this movie, it's a total waste of my hardearned  money.""  Maybe you should spend some of that ""hardearned""  money, on a brain with a sense of freakin humor. This is the one movie that  I respected Cage as an actor in.  ""HEY NICHOLAS CAGE CAN ACT.""  Then he went on to ""Bigger fame"" with Con Air.  I think he needs  to talk with JOEL AND ETHAN, and maybe they'll forget about his current  ""rotten acting credits"", and put him in another movie like RASING  ARIZONA. For those that liked this movie, which is the majority of the  population of the WORLD, then you will also like BARTON FINK, and FARGO!  JOEL AND ETHAN COEN are the directors of the century, and I hope they  continue to make these types of movies for many years to come.",940636800,13,1335,4.281124497991968

This was the  stranges kind of crime farce.  I think it is the Coen's best, although I  think many people will argue with me about that.

275659,5,6300249964,"Put simply, this story could've been, and definitely should have been, set in the deep south. While references to life in ""Paradise Valley"" seem pretty accurate, These characters--every one of them--are the nutcases  that populate the novels of O'Connor, Faulkner and, hell, Ludlow Portch.  The likely reason The Coens did not set it there is that they might of been  unsure if they were portraying southerners correctly. Oh, but they did.  They really did. Besides, ""Raising Alabama"" isn't catchy enough a  title.  Anyway, this movie endures for its endless supply of cool quotes  and catch phrases. ""Guv'mint do take a bite, don't she?""....
