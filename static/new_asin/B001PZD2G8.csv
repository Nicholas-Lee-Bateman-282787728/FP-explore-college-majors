8334907,5,B001PZD2G8,"I totally love the YogaFit DVD videos.  Having been thru the Yogabutt and Yoga Abs DVD's I was ready for a bit more challenge. This video has where you can choose what area of the body you wish to work on specifically or they have a total body workout that is 18 minutes long.  This is more than just poses, this DVD makes you ACTUALLY sweat! Beth Shaw gives really great instruction on how to do the poses and also gives verbal customization cues to adjust to your level of fitness.  The only section I dislike on this DVD is the lower body workout- the instructor does not quite give clear directions and also the exercises are not even for both sides of the body- other than that, I highly recommend this video!",1337040000,,714,4.353383458646617
8334908,5,B001PZD2G8,"This is an excellant yoga video with four included work outs that pinpoint different parts of your body. I find it gives me a fantastic work out and is not too easy or hard to do. I am a beginner at yoga, but i love this video! I can see myself using if for many years to come.",1260489600,,277,3.793103448275862
