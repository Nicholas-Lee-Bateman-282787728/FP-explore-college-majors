8712344,5,B00W6OFHQU,"Maybe not a film for everyone, but Here Is Your Life is a great snapshot of growing up in Sweden in the early 20th century. The story follows a teenager as he leaves his home and sets out to find work and make something of himself. The plot is nothing complicated, though sometimes the film can feel as if it's plodding. But it's easy to get wrapped up in Olof's story as he progresses into adulthood, and all in all this is a great first feature from a director (Jan Troell) who would go on to make some incredible films. This one is definitely worth a watch!",1510790400,,560,4.242990654205608

Influenced by the French new wave, the legendary Bergman, and silent films, Swedish director Jan Troell's coming of age masterpiece ( his inaugural film!) is still a treasure of Swedish cinema fifty years after its release.  He directed, wrote, filmed, and edited HERE IS YOUR LIFE -- rarely ever done -- giving it a unified ""feel"".  Somehow, the director makes every character our hero meets interesting and three dimensional -- most directors NEVER come close to achieving this.

The director tells the coming of age story of a teenage boy growing up in the working class in WW1 era rural Sweden.  Based on a famous novel by a Swedish Nobel prize winning author.

The studio was surprised when the director screened it for them -- STRANGE and LONG.  But it became a big money maker AND a critical success.

Recommend for its humanism, cinematography, masterful storytelling style, elision, perfect era music, great cameos, the first and last 30 seconds, his benevolent world view, and a remarkable color dream sequence.  The longest film in Swedish history.

My favorite film discovery of the year so far.",1461369600,7,1344,4.7956521739130435
8712347,5,B00W6OFHQU,"In 1966, before the ""coming of age"" movie was a recognized genre, Jan Troell came up with this one -- his first feature -- which he co-wrote and in which he acted as cinematographer as well as director.  The familiar American formula won't be found here.  For one thing, the movie is set in northern Sweden in the period of the First World War, and it covers the life of Olof, the protagonist, from the ages of 14 to 18 or 19.  There's nothing like conventional closure -- the film both opens and closes with Olof in transition, as it were, in winter.  At the opening, where he leaves a foster family to return home, his immediate future isn't clear, and when he leaves at the end, walking along the snow-covered railroad tracks (beautifully shot from overhead), his future isn't clear yet.  By this time, though, we know that he's intelligent and resourceful, watchful and willing to learn, even though the jobs he has had -- in a sawmill, as a logger clearing tree-trunk blocks on a river, in a cinema, on the road as a traveling projector operator, and in a railroad depot -- are neither high-paying nor easy.  He's a working class kid, but he has enough sense to start teaching himself to read and think, and by the end, he has concluded that the jobs he has had amount to exploitation and that maybe Marx was on to something.  All the same, the movie doesn't overstate his political understanding, or abilities, or influence, and we don't really know how his burgeoning intellectual life will play into what he makes of himself later.  The cultural and historical specificity of the movie seem important.  In rural Sweden, there's the weather and there's hard manual labor -- but Olof's jobs in the cinema and on the road as a projectionist give him a glimpse into a world beyond -- we see him watching as he projects newsreels of events on the Western Front and shows movies of Christians being eaten in the Colosseum and hears his boss talking about ""culture,"" although the boss isn't himself particularly cultured.  But he watches how people behave -- he learns how to use a knife and fork and he learns about sex from a free-spirited but rather pathetic older woman (Ulla Sjoeblom).  One feels that he's taking it all in and not, at this stage, giving much back -- in other words, he's credibly immature.  There are no great revelations or moments of moral crisis -- rather, we have a quiet ""Bildungsroman"" that doesn't overdramatize ""growth.""  Not that there aren't powerful moments -- but they tend to be experiences of others whom Olof meets, and the movie has a rhythm that doesn't lead to your expecting them.  That's partly because Troell -- in a movie that is quite long -- doesn't waste time on connective tissue.  It's not important how Olof gets from job A to job B or C -- if it were, we would have been shown it.  The options open to him are curtailed by his class and the geography -- this isn't spelled out; it's clear from what we see -- but by the end, we feel that other possibilities are open -- depending, of course, on how far down the railway line Olof gets.  It's this open-ness that suggests why Mike Leigh says that this is one of his favorite films, and the sense of class and the economic imperative to work clearly are things that inform Leigh's movie-making too.

Eddie Axberg must have been around 18 or 19 when the movie was shot, and he's altogether credible, even playing a 14-year-old.  Max von Sydow and Gunnar Bjornstrand have small roles.  Of the supporting players, Allan Edwall as the old log-roller August perhaps makes the strongest impression, and as he tells Olof his story, Troell employs a bold double-flashback AND color for just about the only time in the movie.  The significance for Olof of August's story and of his present life isn't spelled out, but one can see how it might give him a sense of his good fortune (for all the hardship) and also stir a need to move up and out.  We don't learn much of the history of the other characters, but it speaks to the economy and sure-ness of the writing that they all come across as memorably distinct and alive.  Visually, the movie is a treat -- the landscapes are stunningly filmed, and the symbolic curlew belongs to it.  The question for Olof is -- is he no more than a part of the natural order like the bird?  or can he press the idea of flight to mean that he can perhaps get beyond that landscape and its limitations and connect in a larger way with culture and history?",1448409600,12,4480,4.521685254027261
