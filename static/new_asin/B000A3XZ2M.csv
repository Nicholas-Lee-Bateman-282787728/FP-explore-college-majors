8074216,5,B000A3XZ2M,"This is not a complete ballet, but short pieces from various performances.  Ninety minutes of wonderful ballet dancing by ""the best"", including Baryshnikov and Nureyev.  I was acquainted with the talents of Baryshnikov and admired his grace for years.  Sadly, I knew nothing of Rudolf Nureyev until seeing him on public television.  Needless to say, I was completely entranced by his grace and incredible leaps.  It also includes, interestingly, ballet exercises c. 1920 in black and white from that time period.  All in all a very enjoyable DVD.",1215475200,32,546,5.1477272727272725
