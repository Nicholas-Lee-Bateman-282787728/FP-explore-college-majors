8758403,5,B01EEGUAT6,"This is a magnificent anime.  It has both historic and literary allusions.  Its picture of a small Japanese island that Russia conquered after World War II was over and its effect on the small Japanese population, as exemplified by two small boys, is touching.  The animation is superb.  The story is bittersweet.  And the overarching reference to ""The Galactic Railroad"" is its constant theme.  When I first saw it, I did not think I wanted to own it.  But I could not resist.  As soon as it came in the mail, I watched it again.  A remarkable experience.  I highly recommend it.  It is both magical and sorrowful, sweet and nostalgic.",1469836800,,636,4.63963963963964
