8641026,1,B00ID6O9AA,"This movie has NEVER officially been released on any format. Thus, any copies of it that ARE out there are bootleg copies, copies individuals have recorded off some cable channel for personal viewing and unofficial copies sold by Movie Hunter which are supposed to be from the studio but which have really been recorded off some cable channel. With the exception of a rather nice, classic, but historically inaccurate whipping scene this is a really cheesy movie. As a mauer of fact, this movie is so boring and so cheesy and so obscure that it's not even listed sometimes in books or websites containing Telly Savalas's filmography. I wish they WOULD release a real copy for hardcore fans.",1473379200,,690,4.8559322033898304
8641027,5,B00ID6O9AA,I hadn't seen these movie since the 70's when I watched it as a kid.  It was as good as I remembered with alot of action and great story line and characters.  Guy Stockwell and Doug McClure play great roles as the good guy brothers and Telly Savalas plays a great role as the ruthless and heartless Sgt. Major Dagineau.,1404432000,2,319,4.3
8641028,1,B00ID6O9AA,"This is presented as a new issue of a great movie but it is a bootleg home-made copy of a cable/satellite broadcast on ACTION MAX, which is part of Cinemax available on Direct TV, Dish Network and Verizon FIOS. .  This is in old TV 4:3 aspect ratio, low definition and the logo for ACTION MAX appears throughout the movie in the lower right hand corner.  Didn't watch it as I already ave a commercially produced tape copy of the movie.",1402531200,6,435,4.3580246913580245
