8010264,5,B0001CXSF6,"I hadn't seen this movie in years, but it's one of Coburn's best!  Lots of intrigue and mystery.  No way you can guess the ending until you get there!",1524009600,,150,4.137931034482759
8010265,4,B0001CXSF6,"Professor Robert Elliot (James Coburn) is about to come into a new position of power in the government. The people that are placing him there insisted that he correct his past intercessions; to do this he must see that several people with intimate knowledge of his nefarious dealings are to be eliminated.

In the original plot written by Mort W. Elkind, Robert was a soviet sleeper. Screen play writers Barry Levinson and Jonathan Lynn changed it to industrial espionage.

The plot is not unique but the execution is unique. It is also fun as we go along for the ride. Will Robert succeed in The Internecine Project?",1502409600,,617,4.757009345794392

8010270,4,B0001CXSF6,"Good thriller with an unusual premise (I won't give it away). This was basically ignored in theaters during the mid-70's which is a shame, because it is an involving thriller. Great picture quality in its original aspect ratio add to the enjoyment.",1391040000,,248,4.928571428571429
8010271,3,B0001CXSF6,"This is an old-school action/thriller circa 1974.  That is why I watched it plus, I remembered how cool James Coburn was, back in the day.  The plot is a wee silly, and the tension is not so tight, but I tell you, they certainly liked to drink and smoke in that era.  I think Coburn has a glass of scotch in his hand through the entire film, even in the most critical moments where he needs his sharpest acumen.  Lee Grant was always kinda hot and she is seemingly ""air brushed"" in her scenes.  There are other oldtime actors you will most certainly recognize.  The conspiracy aspect and oil futures issue is still relevant today.  Don't expect quality picture, because it is that old.  I did not care.  It made me feel old and semi-nostalgic.",1352332800,3,743,4.444444444444445
8010272,4,B0001CXSF6,"A dark tale of murder and intrigue, The Internecine Project (1974) stars James Coburn (Our Man Flint, Hard Times) as Robert Elliot, a brilliant economist living in London, who serves as an advisor to the US Senate.  With a solid supporting cast, the film directed by Ken Hughes, is a tense drama where four of Elliot's associates in unethical activities, are maneuvered into murdering each other, as part of a twisted and brilliant master plan, to clear the way for Elliot's appointment to a politically sensitive job.

Coburn shines as the cold calculating Elliot, who smoothly sets up the players, to knock each other off.  David Baker (Michael Jayston) a research scientist, civil servant Alex Hillman (Ian Hendry), masseur Albert Parsons (Harry Andrews), and Christina Larsson (Christiane Kruger) a high class call girl, are the unwitting players in Elliot's ""project"" who are set to eliminate each other on one particular night.  Rounding out the cast are Keenan Wynn as a high powered lawyer with the connections to advance Elliot's career, and Lee Grant as a reporter who becomes romantically involved with Elliot.

Once the plan is set in motion, a relaxed Elliot waits in his darkened study, smoking a cigar and drinking brandy.  Studying a map of London, he checks off items on a list, as his associates complete their assigned tasks in the precise order planned, highlighted by a brutal murder in the shower.  Most of the scenes are filmed in low light, with the action nicely punctuated by Roy Budd's musical score.  There are a couple of sticky spots, but things go almost exactly as planned, and the film concludes with Elliot on this way to the airport bound for America.

For those that enjoy watching a sister scheme unfold, The Internecine Project is a pretty good watch, at least the first time around.  Repeat value may not be very high, in this heavy on atmosphere, but rather low on action affair that rates 3.5 stars.  There isn't a lot of dialog, but Coburn's suave performance as a calculating schemer is enjoyable, in this fairly nicely executed production from Barry Levinson (The Natural, Rain Man).

8010273,3,B0001CXSF6,"Popular screenwriter Barry Levinson wrote this interesting spy tale where James Coburn plays an advisor to the president. He plans it so four associates who know of scandals in the president's past kill each other off, the twist being that the second last to die first plants poison for the last one. But, poison paper is the key to end Coburn himself. Obvious inferences to Nixon and Watergate are what sparked the film into production. The death scenes are at times gruesome, including a Hitchcock-style shower strangling and torture with loud noise.",1269820800,4,552,5.010869565217392
