2128642,5,B0002WZS94,"I recently had the opportunity to view this film in its original IMAX format and it was quite an amazing experience.  As someone who has recently taken a strong interest in the sport of skydiving, as well as BASE jumping (which I have yet to try), I found this movie as intriguing as any I have ever seen.  Not only does this movie provide continuous outstanding shots of professional skydivers and BASE jumpers from around the globe, but it also takes you in great depth, into what goes on inside a person's head, and body, when they take life to the edge.  Adrenaline Rush is a fun ride, and provides spectacular insight into what makes people push life to the extreme.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who as ever thrown themselves out of plane, off of a cliff, or anyone who has even the slightest bit of Adrenaline Junkie in them.",1096761600,21,840,4.470588235294118

8033755,4,B0002WZS94,"I saw this movie at the Clark Planetarium IMax theater in Salt Lake City, Utah, the largest IMax screen in the state. Shown in 3D, it was like you were there jumping off the cliffs and flying around.

I liked it so much I purchased it but don't care to watch it much out of the IMax theater. Obviously, the MAJOR downside is home screen size, then 3D availability. I have watched it on a 47in HD tv.

As far as content, I think the video has been disassembled and re-edited and a lot of the good content is in the special features and credits.

As with most IMax movies, this movie would be great for science classes and field trips. I wish IMax movies were longer and recycled through the IMax theaters often.",1389657600,,710,4.2835820895522385
8033756,5,B0002WZS94,I bought this while actively skydiving and years later still relive the rush while watching it. Wow is all I can say!,1377043200,,117,4.363636363636363
8033757,3,B0002WZS94,"The title is a little misleading. It should have been titled something like ""A Study In Skydiving"" or ""A Skydiving Story"". There was no ""Adrenaline Rush"" to this video and I watched it on a 46"" HDTV. The vid itself does not convert to the full screen. It's not a bad movie it's just that the title has you expecting something much more. You would think for an IMAX movie it would have some awesome skydive views but no, movies a little dry. I've seen better skydive vids on YouTube. If you can borrow this movie from someone or buy it for $5 or less then I would recommend it but not worth what I paid (less than $20) and seriously not worth the $40 plus being asked for it now. Now I've been tandem skydiving and that was an ""Adrenaline Rush"" and that I highly recommend at least once in your life time.",1322352000,,804,4.2272727272727275
8033758,5,B0002WZS94,I had seen this movie a few years ago at an IMAX and it was awesome then and just as good now!  Well worth the small price for this good DVD.,1304294400,,141,3.5483870967741935
8033759,5,B0002WZS94,I first saw this movie at an IMAX theatre at the AIr & Space Museum in DC.  I loved it then and I love it now too.  It touches on some of the science involved in risk and also has gorgeous shots of different jumps.  I recommend it to all of my friends and bought it just so I could show it to everybody.,1264982400,,303,3.703125
8033760,4,B0002WZS94,"I give this four stars simply because the sky-diving and base jumping shots are awesome.  Loved those. Didn't care much for the scientific explanations behind adrenaline junkies...really wanted more IMAX photography of the jumps themselves.  Overall tho, v. cool.",1235433600,2,263,5.717948717948718
8033761,5,B0002WZS94,"Okay I am new to the sport of skydiving and eventually I will get into BASE jumping, but watching this DVD gave me the chills. Absolutely amazing. The IMAX footage could not be better. Even if you have the slightest interest in BASE jumping or skydiving BUY THIS DVD! It's worth every penny.",1228694400,,291,4.509433962264151
8033762,4,B0002WZS94,"Being the first WMVHD content disc I've purchased, I can't speak to how it might compare with other titles out there in this format, but it didn't disappoint and in fact it has inspired me to get back into skydiving.  I did find it to be a little short in running time especially considering the little 'history of Adrenaline' segment which wasn't in keeping with the rest of the content.  It's for these two reasons that I didn't give it a five star rating, but if you're after HD program content to play on your computer, and you don't suffer from vertigo, then this is an excellent choice.",1194134400,,592,4.472222222222222
8033763,5,B0002WZS94,"Realy realy good...
