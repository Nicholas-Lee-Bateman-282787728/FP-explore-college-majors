8520840,4,B007PXYWUO,"The Gymnast is 5 star - excellent movie.  Everything Relative is an early attempt at lesbian chic a la The Big Chill, and eminently forgettable.  Maybe a 3 star, but closer to a 2 in my book...",1504656000,,193,4.1891891891891895
8520841,5,B007PXYWUO,Awesome!  Love Dreya Weber. Her gymnastic capabilities are amazing. The story The Gymnast is poignant and well acted. The story moves quickly and keeps your attention. I highly recommend it.,1444435200,,190,5.333333333333333
8520842,5,B007PXYWUO,Beautiful. Sensuous. Delightful. Not filled with women ooohing and aahing. and swooning in lesbian pleasure...that wears thin. This is different.,1386374400,,145,6.3

8520844,4,B007PXYWUO,"This is a huge bargain for us Dreya Weber fans.  Everything Relative is the story abt college friends on a reunion trip who discover some unsettling changes in their group dynamic.  They were militant feminists 10 years ago but time has robbed of some of their fire.  Does growing up mean growing apart?  Will different goals affect friendship?  And how long should one mourn a long-dead lover--and would she want that, anyway, for someone she loved in return?  The story will move you and stay with you for days afterward as you reflect on your own answers to the questions it raises.
Fans will be moved by the story and appreciate Weber's growth as an actress.  The Gymnast shows her versatility for character interpretation, as well as her fantastic physical skills as an aerialist in a Vegas-style act, which is part of her real story.  These two films are a good addirion to your library.",1360454400,3,893,4.716129032258064
8520845,5,B007PXYWUO,"Its a wonderful movie with touching issuses. Im a big Dreya Weber fan anyway. However like books don't judge it by its cover, give it a try and decide for yourself.",1360022400,,164,4.32258064516129
